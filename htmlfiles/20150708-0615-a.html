What do you think?</br>  <br>t's censored, but it's not noticeable censoring, like there are no black bars or beams of light, but instead it's like her hair covering her breast, so the anime is still enjoyable</br>  I`m going to watch this shit, but I will think it never happened, like any other shit adaptation.  <br>Really? because the color looks really off, though perhaps that's the stream fault.</br>  <br>wait 6 months you mean</br>  <br>Anime of the year anon<br><br>Based crab sensei has a Cinderella story with this</br></br></br>  The fanbase is already Jojo tier  How do you even fuck a snake.

Your pants are almost drenched in her secretions before you finally get them off, finally plunging into her sensual folds as she pants, begging for more. Her powerful hind legs do most of the work, thrusting against you again and again. The musky scent of her pheromones fills the air, arousing you further as her lust reaches an almost feral state. She screams, desperate for release, as your savage mating reaches a peak. Finally, she slams against you one last time, taking you to the hilt, your member touching her most intimate inner reaches. Her upper body tenses up, fully enraptured by orgasm, but her pussy clenches around your dick, rippling, as you, too, reach your apex. She milks every drop of cum out of your rod, for what seems like an eternity. Finally, you both collapse, exhausted. Covered in sweat, fluids, and smelling of bestial sex, she leans in to your ear and whispers,  "Horse pussy!" <br><br>WE ANIMU NOW BOWS.</br></br>  <br>Oh man she beat a Boar! A Boar! What an amazing accomplishment! I'm sure EVERYONE will stop shitting on her vaginal location cause she beat up Bacon.<br>Oh wait, no it doesn't, it didn't even make up for her looking stupid for the rest of the chapter.</br></br>  <br><br>I was not prepared for her being a redhead on top of short hair and surgical scars/stitches</br></br>  <br>It was a dude having sex with a snake.</br>  <br>i prefer the Enchantress version</br>  <br>sorry no<br><br>horses smell horrible with no exceptions</br></br></br>  <br><br>I understand your opinions but respectfully disagree<br><br>Tio is most certainly the cutest and the best waifu</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not very much animation in there.

Usually at spoiler week I can't focus on anything at all...</br>  <br>He already is a cuck because of Mikasa's delusions around Eren.</br>  <br>That's because you have shit taste. Mikasa is much worse though.</br>  "There is a chapter in July. The August issue will be released in July, it has always been 1 month ahead.

The rest of the world seems to agree that manlet is the best too.</br>  <br>Hopefully he dies soon.</br>  <br>Exactly.<br><br>It's an endless circle of cuck.</br></br></br>  <br>The rest of the world has shit taste.</br>  <br>They actually have answers to titan mysteries while all manlet does is kill imotous and have family drama.</br>  <br>8th at 5 pm by CR</br>  <br>America time?</br>  <br>Why are Shitkasafags so retarded?</br>  <br>No need to be so butthurt your favorite isn't as popular.</br>  <br> Why everyone here is so retarded <br><br>Here I corrected for you.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm a manletfag and even I agree he's shit.<br>You fatty whales need to fuck off back to tumblr.</br></br>  <br>Only underage fujos like the shitlet.</br>  <br>All manletfags need to fuck off back to Tumblr, yourself included.</br>  <br>No, I'm an exception.</br>  <br>Isn't that the same for Bort and Pigner?</br>   manletfags <br> LMfags </br>  <br> mikasafags </br>  <br> Keith was the one who broke Eren’s belt <br><br>Well I guess that plus the other revelations in this chapter kills the "Mikasa is keeping Grisha-related secrets from Eren and is holding him back!" theory.</br></br></br>  <br>No, you really aren't. You're just as retarded as the rest of them and pretending you think you're not as bad isn't working.</br>  <br>Why are shitletfujos so obnoxious?</br>  <br>Why are BRfags always so butthurt?</br>  <br>They think that popularity makes a character good. They're also in constant anal pain that no one likes the manlet here.</br>  <br>Erwin and Levi are both good characters even while being popular.</br>  <br>They also get butthurt when nobody wants to talk about him</br>  <br>Levi is shit, don't lump him with Erwin.</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>Erens mom used to be a hooker!?</br>  So, who is in the cucked list?<br>Keith<br>Erwin<br>Rod's wife</br></br></br>  <br>Sure thing.</br>  <br>Barmaid apparently</br>  <br>Ymir</br>  <br>What makes Erwin any better than Levi? For the same reasons you complain about Levi, Erwin qualifies for most of it too. Fujobait, takes up screentime, "boring" etc.</br>  <br>Grisha was handsome too.</br>  <br>Just wondering, how do you explain all her suspicious behaviour now that that theory has been sunk?</br>  <br>You.</br>  What's with Isayama and his cuck plot lately?  <br>Erwin doesn't take up screentime and he isn't shoved in your face all the time. He's a stu but he's less of a special snowflake than the manlet.</br>  <br>Jealous gf syndrome? puberty?</br>  <br>autism</br>  So will Mikasa win the Erenb owl in the end or not?  <br>She is on a slap on titan.</br>  <br>All of this explained by jealousy?</br>  <br>Levi has more flaws than Erwin.</br>  I want to cuck bort!  <br>Mikasa</br>  <br>And yet his fags with defend all of his fuckups</br>  <br>She has a lot of headaches. Maybe someone tried to forcefully erase her memories but she's an Asian/Ackerman combo.</br>  <br>Too late, Armin is on it already.</br>  <br>That's just her worrying about him or trying to keep him from pain</br>  <br>MT pls.</br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>Again?</br>  <br>Hopefully not.</br>  <br>Best OTP</br>  <br>4chan version of attack on titan parody.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PpQ<wbr>RcADhDv4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Eren's mom is a whore in that parody.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're not real flaws, more like typical stu flaws. Oh he has no appetite, he has no friends, he can't talk like the high folk, he is an underdog, common people hate him even if he doesn't deserve it, so on.</br>  <br>The hand holding and extra page is missing.</br>  <br>I think that it would technically be impossible for her to have her memories erased as it's already been confirmed those powers don't work on Ackermen and nips. So I am inclined to believe her memories are caused by something else, most likely her Ackermen powers.<br><br><br>I see. I guess I might be reading too much into it.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Eren, please.</br>  <br>Erwin's daddy issues makes him more awkward than abnomarl manlet doing abnormal cute things.</br>  <br>It's missing that one extra page.</br>  <br>Maybe she's not completely immune, but her memories aren't completely erased either. The Reiss were also supposed to be immune to memory wiping but Frieda still managed to erase Historia's memory.</br>  <br>"&gt;Grisha told Shadis: “This child isn’t like you. This is my child. Please, stop meddling in our affairs.”<br><br>For whatever reason it reminds me of Beardwins situation when he smiled ina creepy way almost crying. Looking at Grishas eyes, they tell a different story, he was almost crying while telling Keith to fuck of. To me he was harsh to him because he doesn’t wanted to involve him with his own “affairs” I think there spoke the guild of Grisha to sacrifice himself to Eren causing him a trauma.</br></br></br>  <br>A new level of autism.<br><br>Why not?</br></br></br>  <br> the Reiss were also supposed to be immune <br>?</br></br>  <br>The reiss were never mention to be immune. No one from the riess beside the holder know the history of the walls. THe only immune race were the ackerman, asians and nobles family.</br>    <br> abnormal cute things <br>Like what?</br></br>  <br>Good autism is what make it great.</br>  <br>Is Isayama shipping them too?</br>  <br>She's a bastard, it’s not the same if her lineage is" pure".</br>  <br> Why not? <br>Because it would be terrible for Mikasa's character out of universe and terrible for Eren in-universe.</br></br>  <br>unless they are marring cousin, no one is pure reiss.</br>  <br>I don't. I probably complain about him the most here. Only the fujoshits think he's perfect and can't do no wrong. You can like a character while acknowledging they could be shit at times, but a lot of his fags can't comprehend that and flip out over justified insults about his canon fuckups and flaws.</br>  <br>Tossing womanlets, telling shitty jokes, making tea, being cucked...</br>  <br> "I can't see you" <br> Will Eren see him?! <br>I don't know why but that made me giggle.</br></br></br>  <br>Sure.</br>  <br>I don't know anon, both Asians and Ackermen were said to be completely immune to mind fuckery, whereas this was never specified about the Reiss themselves. <br>Also, even if we assume that merging two immune bloodlines, by some miracle it results in a child that is susceptible to mind fuckery, why would anyone want to mind wipe Mikasa and how would they be able to do that when the coordinate is inside Eren?</br></br>  <br>That’s true, I wonder if Rods wife was a distant cousin.</br>  <br>And the nobles families</br>  <br>Y-yes, and the nobles, I forgot about that.</br>  <br>Tastes like trying too hard.</br>  <br><br>They probably are cousins. They're both fat and sort of look alike.</br></br>  So is Grisha related to MT?  <br>No, mama Reiss is blonde and skinny. She looks nothing like Rod.</br>  <br>we don't know</br>  <br>Is the coordinate the only one who can erase memories? Rod seemed to know a bit about returning Eren's memories himself. And the nobles were threatening Zackley about erasing their memories even after Frieda was long gone.</br>  <br>Rod could had been told that secret by URI. Nobles heard the news that rod had gotten eren back.</br>  <br>She worries about him.</br>  <br>More like heavy backpedaling.</br>  <br>I agree with this. Even Isayama calls Erwin the perfect man.</br>   LM <br> implying Mikasa would ever fuck manlet <br> EM <br> implying Eren isn't more interested in manlet's ass <br> EL <br> implying main character yaois will ever happen in this series </br></br></br></br></br>  bruh  <br>Back to tumblr with you.</br>  <br> see filename <br>But of course.</br></br>  Yes or No?  <br>Right into the trash.</br>  <br> tfw everyone is a cuck </br>  <br>No science book raws for this thread then.</br>  <br>Eren's lost memories are about one big moment: his father's death. While Frieda's and Grisha's memories probably are related to the fact he doesn't know how to use the Coordinate. Frieda and Uri were trained, Eren didn't even know he had it.</br>  <br>I can't even tell which character this is supposed to be.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127733105 <br>You're stupid</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127733105 <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127733105 <br>We had those in previous threads.

I don't care about Bort.</br>  Karla is the best girl.  <br>I love your scans and your efforts, but /snk/ only cares about shipping and shitflinging, I bet no one would even read the science book.</br>  <br>Carla won the erenbowl.</br>  <br>That's it. Thanks.</br>  <br>Is it just me or does she look like Historia</br>  Manlet and Eren are related.  <br>Don't disrespect scanfag. He shared interesting stuff with us in exchange for cute Berts. Show some gratitude.</br>  <br>It's mostly an excuse for Bertfags to circlejerk about how cute Borty is anyway</br>  <br>Yes. Although I would rather say she looks like Frieda, because of the hair color.</br>  <br>No one is forced to like Bort just because scanfag does, you entitled little faggot.</br>  <br>I really don't care</br>  <br>Why do all the babies look like Rod?</br>  <br>eren look a little fat</br>  <br>Rod being the father of everyone confirmed.</br>  <br>Because Rod is a giant babyman</br>  <br>He's a baby. All babies should be fat.</br>  <br>You say it like he only shares Bert related stuff. He scanned the whole Brutus, Chuugakkou and the science book. I guess people here just don't care about this stuff.</br>  <br>Rod had a knife shove down his throat and he didn't cry. He had a strong belief but too bad the first king was too powerful.</br>  <br>No one is forcing you to like Bert. He wanted to know if people wanted him to post the science scans and you or another anon was rude about it.</br>  <br>Eren reminds me of those Reiss brats</br>  <br>Looks more like it's to build up a reputation.</br>  <br>Not all anon are mean to him just the newfag.</br>  <br>Carla also has the same eyes as Historia and Frieda</br>  <br>not all babys are fat. I was less then 2 pound. I guess carla had a lot to eat during the pregnancy.</br>  <br>Most of use don't. Especially when you fags like entitled whiny brats.</br>  <br> he <br>Nice one, Bertfujos.</br></br>  <br> Most of us don't <br>Wrong. A lot of anons were grateful for his scans. Him being a Bertfag has nothing to do with the content he shares.</br></br>  <br>Way to miss the point, retard. Who the fuck cares what character he or she likes as long as he shares this shit with us? I know I'm not willing to pay for this shit but I still want to read it, just like the manga.</br>  <br><br> less than 2 pounds <br><br>You poor malnourished soul</br></br></br></br>  Eh anything but this. Two pages. Technological timeline in the walls.  <br>2 Bertfags samefagging is not a lot. And just because he scans shit doesn't give him a pass to act like a faggot.</br>  <br>I sure as hell don't care about Chuugakkou.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>premature 7 month baby. Smaller then a football. I was surprise manlet was so big since his mom was so poor. We do have to wonder the medical technology in snk. How does Hanji get over a burns in one week, and a torn shoulder in 2 months?</br>    <br>everyone here is a faggot. you are just an angry faggot.</br>  <br>I just find it weird that he always has to make clear he is a Bertfag.</br>  <br>Asking if you want scans or not is acting like a faggot now? Fucking kill yourself.</br>  <br>pumps were invented before 20th century.</br>  <br>Does being productive like scanning content or posting a Bert pic makes someone faggot?</br>  <br>Then is the SnK world taking place after 1912?</br>  <br>No, acting like a brat because someone said they wouldn't fuck Borty is.</br>  <br>He didn't ask if you'd fuck Bort, get over yourself.</br>  <br>Yes, I like to think the coordinate is the only one who can control and erase memories. I think Rod was just planning to trigger Grisha's memories to surface into Eren's mind by touching him. Who knows, maybe this was because even dormant coordinate memories act up around the Reiss family blood, but this is just me grasping at thin air.<br><br>Also, regarding the nobles, they were planning to wait until Rod stole Eren's coordinate and erase everyone's memories using Historia.</br></br></br>  <br>Considering all the stuff that didn't get invented and how it's compared to the "real world" it probably doesn't take place on Earth.</br>  <br>How is it that only Bertfags like what he posts when some of his scans have absolutely nothing to do with Bert? How is he acting like a faggot by asking if we wanted the scans?</br>  <br>That's what I thought. Also them both looking like copies of their mothers could indicate Grisha had a weak seed.<br><br>Or Isayama just can't draw babies.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe he should have made the question more clear. I know he's always using that pic when he posts scans, but it also could have been just circlejerking, since he just asked yes or no.</br>  <br>What if it takes place in a post apocalyptic future where all of humanity's technological advancements were rendered useless, so humanity had to start over in that regards?</br>  <br>Newfag please leave. He always posts that picture when he gives links to his scans. When he asked yes or no he was obviously asking if he should post more.</br>  <br>Most likely it is a case of sameface. After all, even 3D babies look alike, so no surprise that 2D ones don't have a lot of unique features.</br>  <br>So Isayama isn't following a timeline, he's just conveniently placing what he wants in the series? They don't have steam machines, electricity and gasoline engines but they still have pretty much everything else.<br><br> Hey, thanks. </br></br></br>  <br>That's a popular theory but wouldn't it be cliche?</br>  <br>I think what this chart is sort of implying is that the walled humanity in MRS has mostly a pre-industrial level technology, but all the more advanced technology or tools in this series seems to be connected to Grisha and the Reiss family(they also had a syringe and a serum beyond their capability to analyse) so most likely this is meant to imply that the outside world is/used to be much more advanced than MRS, almost as if they are like an Amish community of sorts.</br>  <br>Maybe they had the knowledge to construct these things but it was seen as dangerous and got erased.</br>  <br>I guess it is not ideal but it would make more sense to the reader if this was the case, as opposed to an entirely different universe. After all, what are the chances of a completely alternative universe where people devise such strikingly similar technology to our own? <br>So the most likely explanation is that it takes place in our far future but some tools and technologies were somehow preserved in the popular knowledge.</br></br>  <br>Some one was working on bullet and a revolver. Plus a hot air balloon.</br>  <br>Isayama says not too expect too much of his series so I wouldn't be surprised if he does pull that.</br>  <br>The snk world is very steampunk-esque. They could create complex inventions like 3DMG, guns, cannons, etc, but electricity and other modern machinery is still an abstract concept.</br>  <br>The government were confiscating technology too.</br>  <br>No one was dumb enough to grab a kite and fly through a thunderstorm?</br>  <br>Yeah, so the conclusion can only be that the government/the Reiss wanted to prevent the walled humanity from advancing further technologically, and this is most likely connected to the will of the first Titan King.</br>  <br>Does anyone else think the gun maker and Kenny were linked? He was making a gun that was said to be able to "kill the king" and we don't know who the source was where Kenny got his information. He also had a pretty weird gun when going after Uri.<br><br>It's probably not at all important now unless gun-guy is linked to any of the cast, but it's just something I've thought about.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe Hanji would if she wasn't so focused on the titans.</br>  <br>Those sorts of worlds exist in a lot of fiction</br>  <br>Someone probably tried, but the government might've stopped them.</br>  Maybe they'll pull an M. Night Shamalama and find out everything outside the wall is totally normal and modern.  <br>True, but I doubt that Isayama would come with something super special unique snowflake in terms of his explanation of the SnK universe.<br>So it's either post apocalyptic future or alternative historical universe. And I am more inclined to believe the former.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's what the forth wall theory is about. I personally like that one.</br>  <br>Considering how some people said that how MT dresses looked modern I wouldn't be surprised.</br>  <br>It threaten the king because it was using modern bullet and had 6 shot aka a revolver. Kenny was using those old one shot pistol, everyone in the military had those *armin used one too*</br>  <br>Maybe not to that extent, but the outside world does seem to be more advanced than the humanity inside the world, at least in terms of vaccines, glasses, syringe and so on.</br>  <br>I wouldn't say normal and modern but there's definitely better technology out there.</br>  <br>Considering the Reiss family has created the walls and they seem to have been the ones in control of all titans, I really doubt they would lock themselves in a fourth wall and have no other titans in the rest of the world.</br>  <br>Man, how could Grisha forget his name and origins but still remember that he's a doctor?</br>  <br>Or maybe he won't ever explain what kind of world it is and leave it up to interpretation. I like to think of it as a post-apocalyptic future too.</br>  <br>maybe he just awoke after eating a shifter. aka ymir</br>  Taken from your friendly neighbour<br>• Hange told Eren &amp; co. that Shadis was the 12th commander<br><br>• Eren &amp; co. along with Hange, Levi, and Erwin visit Shadis in his office<br><br>• Sasha was reluctant to go since she used to get called into his office a lot<br><br>• It has been a few months since the graduation, and Shadis commented that they all look different now<br><br>• The last time Levi met Shadis was 5 years ago (1 year after ACWNR)<br><br>• A flashback of Keith’s memories shows of Erwin, Levi, and Hange 5 years ago<br><br>• Shadis commented that Levi has changed as well since then<br><br>• Shadis said that he’s the only former commander of the SC who passed down his title while still being alive; he remarked that it’s a good thing that now the SC is in hands of someone with competent brain [Erwin]. He feels that his only achievement is giving his position to Erwin.<br><br>• Shadis commented that Eren really looks like his mom, but the passion behind his eyes the same as his father’s<br><br>• Eren asked Shadis what he knows, but Shadis replied that in the end he is in fact still clueless. But he offered to tell his story, if it can maybe help them, because he doesn’t want to be much of a bystander anymore<br><br>• [flashback] Shadis met Grisha 20 years ago in the Shigansina district, outside the wall gate. At that time, while returning from anl expedition, they had less encounters with titans [compared to now] so Grisha was outside the wall.<br><br>• Grisha was clueless about the existence of SC, and Keith was surprised about it, he wondered where Grisha came from and why he looks awkward.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the source of information was someone on the king council told kenny. That guy was killed after kenny switched side.</br>  <br>Selective mind wiping or he was just pretending. However in the panels we got so far, he seemed to be genuine in his claim that he can't remember anything. What bugs me is that whomever left him the memory of him being a doctor also left all his medical knowledge intact, meaning that he knew/wanted Grisha to use those advanced medical skills in MRS. Whom or why, I can't yet figure out.<br><br><br>Yeah, I also doubt he will take too much time to explain things. He seems to get a kick out of leaving his fans dumbfounded and without clear responses regarding a lot of things.</br></br></br></br>  <br> [Scene change to inside the wall] Grisha is in jail. Hannes and Shadis were talking, apparently Grisha doesn’t have birth records or family registery but he remembers that his name is Grisha Yeager and he is a doctor.<br><br>• Grisha asked Shadis to teach him about this world’s customs and about the SC.<br><br>• [Scene change to them having drinks at bar] Grisha commented that there is something strange with the history of the city within the wall, the origins of regions’ name, and even the money’s value in the city. Also the gap between rich and poor was strange.<br><br>• Carla was the waitress at the bar and said that Shadis was trying to recruit people again (Grisha)<br><br>• Grisha commented that only the chosen ones with a special presence can become a member of the SC, and that he aimed to become commander so he can bring change for humanity<br><br>• Carla was infected with the epidemic and Grisha cured her. He saved everyone from the epidemic<br><br>• Not long after that Shadis became commander and he attended Carla &amp; Grisha’s wedding<br><br>• [Flashback of Erwin devising the long distance formation] Erwin stressed that to achieve a higher rate of survival, instead of fighting the titans they should avoid them instead<br><br>• After a series of expeditions with poor results and complaints from citizens, Keith decided that he should make Erwin commander, although at that time Erwin didn’t have a lot of power<br><br>• Grisha &amp; Shadis found Eren at the refuge camp when they found out Carla had been eaten by a titan. Shadis was devastated and Grisha asked Eren to avenge her, and he is sure that Eren would be able to do it since Eren is ‘his child.’<br><br>• Hange was pissed that Shadis kept all this important information to himself all this time</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>acnwr isn't canon. That would mean he meant shadis in 845. He joined the sc in 844 supposely. so he didn't meet the sc commander for over a year?</br>  <br>•Eren said that he isn’t special at all, but Shadis remembered that Carla said that being special doesn’t mean that other people have to acknowledge it; just like Eren, his existence makes her happy, and that’s why he is special. People don’t need to be great to be special.<br><br>• Keith remembered 3 years ago, during Eren’s 3DMG training, watching Eren try to keep himself upright, Shadis realized that he is in fact more suitable as an observer because he is unable to really change things</br></br></br>  <br>You're talking about a family that failed to rid the titans even though they presumably had the power to do so. The kings will could've been to toss a bunch of humans into a cage and research how they behave. Reiss coordinates could be brainwashed by his ideals for all we know. There needs to be a good reason or brainwashing involved or else it wouldn't make sense that they would let humanity carry on like this.</br>  <br> acnwr isn't canon <br>Notto this shitto agein</br></br>  <br>not written or mention by Isayama isn't manga canon.</br>  <br>I guess it'd make sense if he lied about losing his memory since he still knew about the Reiss, the coordinate, Eren being special, and etc.</br>  <br> not written or mention by Isayama <br>And this time, my friend, you should probably dig into the archives.</br></br>  <br>I think all parents thinks their child is special. But waiting 20 years to carry out a mission of eating the reiss doesn't make sense.</br>  <br>why to listen to more people arguing about it.</br>  <br>Isayama offered ideas and approved of it, but that doesn't make it canon. He also supervised the live-action movie and helped write the script. Again, his involvement in an adaption doesn't make it canon.</br>  <br>Was the First King a Reiss or were the Reiss kind of like his chosen disciples?</br>  <br>This family's will, or at least the will of the first Titan King, seems to be that humanity being locked inside the walls is for their own good as it brings peace and stability. They also seem to perceive whomever tries to change the status quo as a danger to said peace and a possible harbinger of humanity's downfall.<br>With those kind of beliefs in mind, I find it impossible to think they just want humanity inside MRS to go along with everything just for the sake of a 4-wall social experiment. It sounds like something bigger and more serious is at stake.</br></br>  <br>He looked desperate. It's probably because the wall fell.</br>  <br>Jean</br>  <br>First King was a Reiss himself.</br>  <br><br>  Shadis realized that he is in fact more suitable as an observer because he is unable to really change things <br><br>Cuck</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is nothing from ACWNR that contradicts current canon events nor does it offer some sort of alternate routes. In fact, now we're getting more spoilers supporting acwnr timeline with Keith mentioning Levi and rest's appearance before the wall breach.<br><br>Why the fuck we keep having the same retarded argument for ages; I don't understand.</br></br></br>  <br>So the names of all the locations in the walls is going to mean something somehow?</br>  <br>Erwin and Levi's meeting is reflected in canon, that's pretty much the only important thing about ACWNR at the end of the day.</br>  <br><br>Thank you for these.</br></br>  <br> implying flaws make a character shifty </br>  <br>Wait until the chapter is fully released before you used it to defend acwnr. Beside which version is canon? If i had to pick, it would be the VN. Not the manga or ova.</br>  <br>I'm not saying it contradicts anything. Petra already confirmed Levi was recruited by Erwin in the underground in the manga. I'm saying the story itself isn't official. I personally like ACWNR and I see it as Levi/Erwin's background, but it's still not canon because it's not part of the canon manga. I don't think you fully understand what canon means. We argue about it because a lot of anons like to bring up adaptions, the anime, and spin offs to prove shit but only the manga counts as canon.</br>  <br>What I think he means is that the way regions are named is very haotic.<br>Some of these names are asian, some have greek influences, other have nordic influences and others sound slavic and germanic. Considering as each of these influences are scattered rather than follow a geographical pattern, these districts really seem to be named haphazardly.<br><br>For further examination, if you wish: <br> Shinganshina <br> Trost <br> Mitras <br> Karanese <br> Stohess <br> Orvud <br> Quinta <br> Utopia <br> Ehrmich  <br> Klorva  <br> Yalkell </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> anons get to pick and choose what's canon and what's not <br><br><br> but it's still not canon because it's not part of the canon manga. <br>Ok this is getting into nasuverse-tier retardation I'm out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but manga and interviews with Isayama=canon and everything else is not canon/taken with a pinch of salt.<br>As easy as that.</br></br>  <br>I would like to think the VN. The anime was screwed up because of Araki and the manga one made things too corny. <br><br>The VN actually had a twist at the end that was interesting and made way more sense as to why Levi followed him, but it's sadly the least well known.</br></br></br>  <br>Both version contridict each other. Canon is something that is 100 percent true. You can't pick and choose. Go back to tumblr then. Next you say the anime is canon to the manga, or the <br>3rd ova, or the 4th ova,</br></br>  <br>That been my point the whole time. The manga in the begining just said he was an underground thug, first it was assume the underground was under sina district. But later it was changed to under the capital.</br>  if Shadis was in love with my mom who had the same exact face as me except for a little bit longer hair, I would be a bit nervous.  What are the chances of Grisha and MT being related?   <br>Yep the vn had the essence of snk. The other two feel like cheap adaptions.</br>  MT looks a lot like Erwin's dad  <br>By blood? Unlikely. They could be part of the same faction though. <br>My question now is whether Ymir used to be the leader of MT/BRA's faction in the past, and if not, then whether Grisha is a relative of hers.</br></br>  <br> Both version contridict each other <br>Anon can you sentence your points properly<br> You can't pick and choose <br>m8 u wot<br> G-go back to tumblr, anon-baka! <br><br><br>Sina is the walls' capital.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Keith/Eren fanart when</br>  <br>You're the only retard here for not understanding what the meaning of canon is. Nothing but the original source counts as official, and I'm saying this as a fan of ACWNR. You can personally see it as their background story if you want, just as I do, but you need to realize the story itself and the OCs are not included in the original manga. It's not that hard to understand.</br>  <br>It could be that MT took over Ymir's faction and that MT invaded the Warriors after she was disposed of. Bert did give a description of an invasion of sorts.</br>  <br> whether Ymir used to be the leader of MT/BRA's faction i <br>Not likely, otherwise BRA would have known about her.</br></br>  Friendly reminder that ACWNR was drawn by EL doujin artist Ninjin. I really wonder how Hajime came to pick her.  <br>mitras is the capital. the underground is down their. But before it was discus in the flesh out in the manga, it was place under Stohess_District.</br>  <br>She's probably really cute and Isa spotted her during a con or something</br>  Whose eyes are those _________?

I hated that fucking battle scene. It would have been better if there wasnt one. If they wanted to start with a battle scene, it had to be glorious.</br>  <br>that right there would be a hilarious outcome for Ainz</br>  Can't find the subs on Nyaa, are they only on Funimation/another streaming site for now?  <br>So, how many eps are we getting?<br>also does anyone have the full op?</br></br>  Is the light novel good?  <br>6 BD's so 12-13 eps usual disc jewing practice.

Usually 2 cour seasons are 8 discs on average. 10-12 when they think they can easily jew it.</br>  <br>Konno Light novel is Sugoi!</br>  <br>Yeah, HS said it will be delayed for a few hours.</br>  <br>What do you think? Better than both anime and manga.</br>  <br>Yes although the translation is funny sometimes. But better than nothing.</br>  <br> 60 bucks for 2 eps <br>I will never understand.</br></br>  <br> light novel <br> good <br>If you consider the fact that most light novels are garbage, then this is slightly less garbage than a lot. Still bad by normal standards, but not bottom of the barrel.</br></br></br>  <br><br>To actually explain what this guy said, a part of YGGDRASIL was brought with him when he was transported to a different fantasy world. The game mechanics still work for him and his guild (like having an inventory), although I doubt that, that's a part of the natural order of the world he's been transported to.<br><br>As for there being other players,  others have appeared before him and made big waves which have shaped the world's history. Who knows if there are any other players currently living in the same time period as Ainz, though. </br></br></br></br>  Chances of this being more than 1 cour?  <br>Zero.</br>  <br> most light novels are garbage <br>Well, there are some good light novels like ___________ and _______________. Of course you can't forget ______________.</br></br>  <br>That wasn't what I meant, but I see your point. However the parallels you pointed out are all kind of skewed and not too similar.<br><br>Rou is climbing his way up the ladder of the world. Ainz is basically just trying to keep his place on the top of that ladder. <br><br>If you can make parallels to Re:Monster then it's no different with The New Gate where Shin is the strongest and leads his npc supporters who are also the strongest among the world to do silly shit.<br><br>The only strong similarity between Ainz and Rou is both are aiming for World Domination, and the former isn't whole hearted nor planned for it while the other is taking it as natural almost.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> _______________ <br>Oh, man. I love _______________</br></br>  <br>all you need is kill</br>  <br>Most likely, the 8 kings are said to have reincarnated so they are most likely grinding levels and shit secretly since they are disbanded.<br><br>Fluder's lifespan alone pretty much proves you don't need to give a shit about dying of old age so long as your level is high, and the 8 kings are hinted at being former max levels as well.</br></br></br>  <br>Fate/Zero and Kara no Kyoukai.</br>  <br><br><br>Whom to believe?</br></br></br>  Other players probably used world items and that is reason MC guild cant learn martial arts.  <br> Overlord  <br>Never heard of this before, but it looks promising. I trust the manga is good as well?</br></br>  <br>That's Narbel you retard</br>  <br>Manga skips alot of stuff so while it seems to look great to anyone that reads it they're really missing out on the LN which is even better by far.</br>  <br>Glorious. Papa Bones satisfied completely.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127734305 <br>Why do you keep calling it a VN?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127734305 <br> VN <br>Written by Nasu right?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127734305 <br> original source material <br>Does the manga differ to the point of being important? No spoilers please.</br></br>  <br>Watch it and find out.</br>  <br>no, its the same. Its just too rushed. Everything happens too fast.</br>  <br>Manga cuts out shitload of character related information and dialogue.

GO GO GO</br>  <br> gogo </br>  <br> Spending too much time on Albedo's Albedos <br>10/10 episode.</br></br>  It makes me sad knowing that the anime will ultimately kill the LN translations like it always happens.  is hs release censored?  <br>There isn't any fanservice except skeleton groping tits and that is done below the edge of the screen. She is bouncy as fuck though.</br>  <br>The anime will end before it catches up with the translation.</br>  Maruyama and so-bin did have a hand in the production right?<br><br>RIGHT?</br></br>  <br>does the hs release show it fully?</br>  So, is it good or just another Sword Art Online clone?  <br>No, its good LN ruined by Badhouse.</br>  <br> it's morely a Cross between Log Horizon and RE:monster than being like SAO <br><br>Except that in Overlord, the MC actually owns all that gold in Log Horizon's game treasury and the MC owns a nearly uncountable number of great magic items and has incomparable skills just as his minions also have more powers than anyone else in the world.<br><br>This is the first anime in decades to start out the MC so overpowered and wealthy and with so many followers and advantages. It's a real self-insert gary stu fantasy particularly since the MC is allowed to and does behave in evil fashion. Ethics and the sense of "good" behaviour are not part of his vocabulary. If he does "good" things it is out of convenience for future plans.</br></br></br></br></br>   Madhouse <br>There goes any hope of ever having a second season.<br>Prepare for shitty anime original ending.</br></br>  <br> good LN <br>So nothing of value then?</br></br>  <br>that's not for sure. From the OP it seems it at least reaches vol 4.</br>  <br>Yes, but the translations always stop after a short boost when the anime is over.</br>  Ehh, just noticed that the Opening also shows scenes from 5th and 6th volumes. Sebas in capital and Demiurge (without Black Knight next to him). + Lizardbros and Cocytus fighting with multiple weapons.<br><br>All the wrong gear too, so I damn hope those are teasers for OP only.</br></br>  autotune aside I kinda liked the OP.   download TerribleSubs <br> first 40 seconds of Company logos <br> first second after shows the text "massive online multiplayer blablabla" <br> hardsubs <br>I stopped the download.</br></br></br></br>   Yes.<br> No.<br> Maybe. <br> I don't know.<br> Can you repeat the question?<br><br> Sasuga /a/. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably, since they don't do shit in the first three volumes.<br><br>I think it'll end with Shalltear fight.</br></br></br>  The camera panning is hurting my eyes its so fucking choppy.  <br>another SAO crap.<br> DROPPED </br></br>  <br>Vampire Hunter D, I suppose...<br>Though that's probably considered low tier around here.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, we'll see how the first volume pans out, if it takes 3 or even 4 eps, they wouldn't have enough room to do 4+ volumes. Unless they want to totally butcher the pacing.</br>  <br> It makes me sad knowing that the anime will ultimately kill the LN translations like it always happens. <br><br>First of all, the light novel is very far ahead. There is enough LN material for many cours already.<br><br>Second, this anime is by MadHouse so it will only get one season. Since OverLord is announced for only one cours for its first season, that means the anime is done at 13 episodes. Therefore, it will never catch up to the LN.<br><br><br> &gt;Spending too much time on Albedo's Albedos <br>Albedo and Narberal have character goods sales potential, so of course the anime will show them off. The merchandisers are bound to be on the production committee for this type of LN conversion to anime. Thus, the anime plot will be influenced by what the merchandisers need in order to promote and sell products.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  did anyone who watched the at-x raw notice anything different in the horriblesubs release? any scene missing or blackened/blurred?  <br>Lol, EOPs and their problems. <br><br>It's fine in raws btw.</br></br></br>  <br>You don't understand, anon. After the anime is over, the translations will surely slow down a lot. It always happens, it's inevitable.</br>  <br>Yeah that's what you get for watching FuniShit.</br>  Poor One Punch Man fans. This is demonstration of what awaits you.  <br> The camera panning is hurting my eyes its so fucking choppy. <br><br>In other words, you'd like to have 100% CGI which reduces the chop from panning fast. Of course, that means you have the small subtle chop all the time of certain types of movements (and essentially no chop from some types of movements).</br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of merchandise<br><br>Lizardbros with real kung fu grip when</br></br></br>  <br>Why would it be?</br>  <br><br><br>Kino's Journey, Boogiepop Phantom, Spice and Wolf, and bam, all the decent ones named, at least out of the ones people here generally know about.</br></br></br>  Wait what ? How can they anime it when there are so few chapters ?  <br>Nah, there's no motion/panning judder in at-x raw, it's funishit fucking their shit up again. And that's what we get from Horrible rips.</br>  <br> Reading butchered manga from a longer source and even prior start test on web. <br> Believing that the manga is the original. <br><br>You don't visit Papa Bones threads often do you?</br></br></br></br>  <br> You don't understand, anon. After the anime is over, the translations will surely slow down a lot. It always happens, it's inevitable. <br><br>Even without an anime, translations slow down over time as the TL or staff get tired or older or graduate from school and move on with their lives. You have been spoiled in the cases where the translation was started by graduates who were blessed by good financial position and friends to help them or they already had level 2 skills. You should also exclude those fast and long translations done for profit. One fan site has over 10 million views per month and a slew of donations, so of course it keeps churning out the material so as long as the donation money keeps coming in.</br></br></br>  <br> liking Badhouse <br>Bet you liked Parasyte too</br></br>  SEMEN DEMON  <br>Fuck off back to &gt;&gt;&gt;/ln/<br><br>Oh wait... you dont even have own board HAHAHAHA. /a/ is anime and MANGO</br></br></br>  <br>I bet you didn't like it.</br>  <br> Wait what ? How can they anime it when there are so few chapters ? <br><br>There are very many chapters published in the original language. Do not assume the number of english translated chapters is anywhere close to the number of original language chapters already published. Translation is far behind....</br></br></br>  <br>So, what is your point?<br>I just stated the fact that LN translations always stall after the anime is over, even when they started before the anime, e.g. Maoyuu or Sakurasou.</br></br>  <br>No need to be so hurt, just report the evil trespassers for violating you and it'll all be well.</br>  <br>dat ed, my penis.<br>http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>x299p_overlord-ed_music</wbr></br></br>  <br>You're retarded, the manga is already caught up.<br><br>Also, lurk the fuck more.</br></br></br>  <br> Mahou Sensou <br>Thanks for letting me know to avoid this shit</br></br>  <br> ... </br>     another "MC is sent into a video game world" <br>Dear god, how many more of this shit can they produce before people are bored of it ?</br>  <br>They won't stop until  you stop being a faggot. </br>  That Mare landing and skirt tug with his running animation.

I's abit shit innit</br>  <br>I thought it was alright. I'll give it a few episodes atleast.</br>  They only needed to add some thickness into her to make her perfect.  Where did the bunny ears come from?  <br>I want to hatefuck bunny.</br>  <br> Best <br>Yeah, no. <br>I liked it tho. I can't remember the last time they had Mayans/Babylonians or whatever fantasy as the setting.<br><br>Also, meido the  only  girl so far.<br><br><br>I think it's part of the ribbon or some shit. She looked better without them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's a better fantasy anime from the last few years?</br>  <br>expect shitstorm after bunny true personality is revealed<br>i'm expecting at least 3 maxed out threads during the release of that episode</br></br>  <br>First ep was a bit too infodumpy, but that tends to be the case for LN adaptations.<br><br>Otherwise it was okay, I guess.</br></br></br>  Don't generally like fantasy but I thought it was great. Best first episode I've seen in a few seasons.  <br>Leave before you get spoiled.<br><br> Cat  is the traitor.</br></br></br>  <br> true personality <br><br>She's evil or something?</br></br></br>  <br>To compare first episodes, Bahamut's had a lot more promise.</br>  <br>Can't wait for bunny orgy.</br>  <br>nice troll m8<br>hans is not the traitor(s)</br></br>  <br> Remember what happened to the potential braves? </br>  This anime is about heroes trying to kill the demon lord, but that is not the main plot. It's about how, during their adventure, a commander is joker levels of evil and decides to fuck the team up internally by sending traps and imo probably sending the traitors. <br><br>So basically the anime will be about the team fighting among themselves and solving nothing until they find out the mystery and rush to the demon lord and kill it.</br></br>  No spoiling guys please  <br><br>They were in a tournament, of course they will get shafted.</br></br>  This will be a climax point in the anime, Hans gets killed, then gets revived.  <br> tournament <br>yer kiddin</br></br>  I started to watch it, but MC seemed to be an insufferable cunt. He probably didn't enter the tournament through normal means out of fear of his parlor tricks getting used up.  Is it a game world or anything to do with RPGs? If yes I will just leave the thread and move on.  <br>Dunno about that. I feel like fantasy adventure has seen a bit of an upswing in the last couple of years.</br>  Watched it as well, OP. Looked like typical shonen shit then he actually did become one of the Six Braves. I'm interested in where this goes.  I want to give my life for the old mountain hag.  <br>Turns into worst girl after her kid is kidnapped.</br>  <br>If I pulled those off would she die?</br>  Plan to watch but drop it because it isn't advanture fantasy.  <br>No, he didn't enter because you can't use concealed weapons in the tournament.</br>  Bunny  <br>Nope, pure fantasy, heroes being chosen and on their way to defeat an immortal evil lord who keeps resurrecting.</br>  <br><br>Or maybe because he just arrived when it was about to start.</br></br>  <br>No, he mentions  in the novels.<br>He's 'the strongest man on earth' but needs his weapons.</br></br>  Breakdancing MC was pretty nice.  <br>watched the opening and dropped it.</br>   People dropping something after watching the first episode. <br><br>More retarded than the people who enjoy SAO.</br></br>  <br> Wasting your time on anime you don't like </br>  <br>Isn't that her in the back though?</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure everyone who isn't a down syndrome kid got that the first time, anon.</br>  <br>Same hair color and all the maids have the same style.</br>  <br>mind = blown<br>She probably killed the real blades princess.</br></br>  <br>Do you just not look at any threads and then post shit like this?  Rabbit's the traitor. </br>  <br>It was alright<br>I don't like how they didn't give any time to the other characters <br>I also hope they don't go overboard with the fan service<br>Like this episode had a little which is about as much as it should have <br>I do not like typical MC having a fear of women like most Japanese men</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck meant to quote </br>  Seems alright so far. The Aztec setting was nice surprise.  <br><br>Choke on my dick</br></br>  <br> I do not like typical MC having a fear of women like most Japanese men <br>At least we didn't get a retarded pervert MC. It's not like it was a full blown allergic reaction like in other shows either. I think MC handled it quite well.</br></br>   Be hyped up to see Aztec architecture and clothing in a fantasy setting <br> Whitey everywhere <br> No brown women <br><br>You think they would at least include one brown woman.</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck off frogposter</br>  <br> Bahamut <br>not really fair, Bahamut had an awesome 1st episode but It keep getting downhill from there</br></br>  <br>Episode one was good, but not as good as the second or even the third. It was erratic and had some flow and pacing issues. Episode two was where it really showed promise. And even later on there was a good couple episodes which were better than 4th, more eventful than 3 and so on. 11 is probably the most exciting and fun ride in the entire series.</br>  <br>I really liked it and decided to read the LN.<br>Finished the first one right now.<br><br>It's completely different from what I imagined it would be.<br>Some of the characters acted pretty irrational in some situations and weren't using their brain (especially Mora), but overall it was okay.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its part of the armor/uniform/outfit, Aztecs had Warrior Orders like Jaguar warriors, Eagle warriors etc.</br>   Generic bland designs <br> Obnoxious yoloswag mc <br> Fear of woman <br> petty tricks as fighting style <br><br>If the next episode doesn't introduce some interesting and likable characters it doesn't have any redeeming values.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Try SAO, it has excellent characters and designs. And the MC is Alpha</br>  <br>Nice meme, still doesn't change that the first episode was shit.</br>  <br>You will get a stupid, selfish loli (worst character).<br>A bright, edgy cat.<br>Muh princess knight.<br>A bitch who thinks she's the boss.<br>Abandoned gunner (a best once some time passes).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've read the novels, it's fun stuff even if volume 3 made me want to murder someone.</br>  <br>What do you think had a good first episode?</br>  <br>Vol 3 makes me want to murder everyone.<br/></br>  <br>Gangsta.</br>  <br>Akagami no Shirayuki-hime had a really good first ep, first 10 minutes of Charlotte were great, Gangsta was alright but that's more because I like the setting in general.</br>  <br> the first episode was shit <br>fuck off with the hyperbole</br></br>  I liked it. I don't see why people hated the first episode so much, had enough exposition and moved the plot just enough to get stuff started.<br><br>Bunnytits was lovely so far.</br></br>  <br>She's a lovely  fiend .</br>  I liked the first episode, but this is one series where I feel like being spoiled has actually kind of ruined it for me. Spent the whole episode looking for hints of the spoilers and not just enjoying it for what it is.  Best Rokka?  <br>It would be extremely painful</br>  <br>Best Rokka is the seventh.</br>    <br>3rd epsiode of bahamut is where it began to drop in quality imo</br>  <br>thanks asshole, fuck you. tag your spoilers k? k</br>  <br>No nigger.</br>  <br> not giving it a chance to prove itself <br><br>go die fuckwad</br></br></br>  How can this guy claim to be the strongest in the world when he fights dirty.  <br> muh honor <br><br>There is nothing wrong with fighting dirty.</br></br></br>  how did she get the seal if she's a bad guy?  <br>Any answer I can give you involves a million spoilers.</br>  <br>what is spoiler tag?</br>  <br> She's a traitor. </br>  How is the adaptation? If it's good I'll wait until anime ended to read the LN.  <br>So far, good.<br>And they can't really adapt this properly without paying attention to all conversations and details, so it should stay good.<br>Should.</br></br></br>  <br>He is the strongest if he can beat others</br>  <br>He can claim whatever he wants to, doesn't mean it's true. He doesn't even know how strong all other strong people in the world are.</br>  I mean it looks better than anything that has aired already. Plus the OST was really amazing. I felt like I was watching a Disney movie for a moment. The only other anime that I think came close was maybe Non Non Biyori Repeat.  <br>Fuck off</br>   1 episode <br> the OST was really amazing </br>  <br> The only other anime that I think came close was maybe Non Non Biyori Repeat. <br>I would agree, but actually for me NNB Repeat was by far the best</br></br>  <br>Sure. But even without quality of production it shown, Akagami manga still makes it the best show this season.</br>  <br><br>Felt I was watching Atelier Sophie more than watching a disney movie.</br></br>  Bones is the best.  <br>Definitely the most solid episode of the season. Very pretty too.</br>  <br>That reminded me of Disney Movies with a character's over expressive movements.</br>  It certainly looked amazing but besides Raj (who was hilarious) it was incredibly boring. Zen is the dime a dozen nice guy shoujo lead and the lead is just as bad, your dime a dozen nice girl heroine. They have absolutely no chemistry together and I found myself zoning out during their scene in the forest.  <br> your dime a dozen nice girl heroine <br>That's just not true, Shirayuki was much more proactive and interesting than your average nice girl heroine</br></br>  <br>So much wrongness and shit taste in a single post.</br>  <br> your dime a dozen nice girl heroine <br><br>Oh how so very fucking wrong you are, it's not even funny. Also did you not see her slap the Prince? She's not your everyday submissive female that needs a males help.</br></br></br>  <br>Well yea<br> It's the only thing i watched so far, shit tier season not counting left overs. </br></br>  <br> shit tier season <br> only watched one anime except leftovers </br></br>  <br>Based Ando</br>  <br> I need to watch it to know i won't like it <br>Browsing /a/ and reading spoilers of first episodes is enough.</br></br>  <br> She's not your everyday submissive female that needs a males help. <br>And yet, she needed Prince Charming to break through the door and save her.</br></br>  <br>This isn't the season for faggots like you<br><br>MANime has come back<br><br>MAN<br><br>not faggot shit like jojo</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is anyone other than Funi subbing it?  <br>It isn't, but enjoy your ignorance.</br>  <br>Taking charge of her own feelings doesn't make her unique, it just makes her a normal girl.</br>  <br>Do you actually see that many female characters that are actually independent in anime? Heck no most female characters are always shown as submissive damsel in distress and are for just fanservice. Yeah there may be series that do have independent females but it's really less compared to all the garbage shit that's out there.<br><br>Shirayuki basically got character development in the beginning of the episode by basically cutting her hair and leaving it for the Prince as a way to say fuck you.</br></br></br>  Dragon Ball Super had the best first episode.  <br>No she didn't. She was handling herself just fine.</br>   tfw it took me hours to find this thread <br><br>So another underrated show nobody talks about huh?</br></br>  <br>The best shows are always the least talked anon. I mean look how many threads of shit like Monster Girls and Gate.</br>  <br>I had high hopes for this anime and I wasn't disappointed with the first episode. I loved the setting and the music. Definitely comfy.<br><br><br>The scene in the forest was really cute though. I thought the scene where Shirayuki hurt herself with the sword so she could show her intentions with the poultice was interesting. It gave a bit more insight into Shirayuki's character. Also, rather than Zen trusting the MC off the bat, he was weary of her. <br><br><br>It's not like she was kidnapped or something. She went on her own and gave herself to get the cure for Zen.<br><br><br>I think the fantasy/fairy tail setting, shoujo tag, and comparisons to a Disney movie turn people off from it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Kohaku did nothing wrong.  Best TM  Here's hoping she reclaims her number one Turkeyhandle position from Arc in the next popularity poll.  <br>She always looked so evil to me in that CG</br>  <br>Yeah you know, except everything.</br>  <br>Forgot pic</br>  <br>She had her own route, that's what she did wrong.</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>She sought revenge instead of improving her life and caused unnecessary suffering to others in the process. Truly a juvenile girl who brought nothing of benefit to the whole situation.</br>  <br>I don't know which instance freaked me out more: this one or when she was masquerading as Hisui.</br>  <br>why everyone hate kohaku?</br>  <br>Only people with shit taste</br>  <br>She was living her life incorrectly.</br>  <br>some saber clone by the look of it<br><br>just forget her TBH</br></br></br>  <br>Literally everything is her fault.</br>    She failed and became normal. In becoming normal she became uninteresting and as such, she lost her value.  <br><br>Who are Kohaku 2 and 3?</br></br>  Mecha Hisui is the best TM.  <br>Dry robot vagoo.</br>  <br>it's mech-hisui not mecha hisui you fucking pleb</br>  Are palette swaps acceptable?  <br>Nothing made by Takeuchi is at all acceptable.</br>  <br>What the hell TM</br>  <br>I'll swap something with her palette if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>It looks good so it's fine</br>  <br>The problem with the new designs isn't the sameface (even though it's obviously shamelessly drawing from the same exact sketches and Takeuchi is a lazy hack), but the designs themselves.</br>  <br>Please<br><br>I just want to forget that this exists and pretend that the Melty art is forever canon</br></br></br>  <br><br>Out of the fucking way, nerds.<br><br>A real man coming through.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That is, a real man knows when to be fashionably late.</br></br>  <br>Well some of us have to live with our problems instead of getting amnesia, Touma-kun</br>  <br>Shiki really is now a black hair Arthur but he looks hot so I'm fine with that</br>  <br>Shiki had the fluffy hair first and then Shirou got it. It's the official TM protag hair.</br>  <br>Shiki's fine as fuck now. <br>Takeuchi did well</br></br>  <br><br>I prefer the manga artist's rendition.</br></br>  <br>He was always sexy anon<br>Especially in Nanaya form<br><br><br>I think I miss his dork glasses and his dark purple hair more than anything. My second biggest problem with the remake besides Arc losing her vents is probably the dulling of colors absolutely everywhere and the unnecessary changes in color scheme for rhe characters.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd go gay for Shiki, but not for Shirou. Why is this?</br>  <br>Who is mystery character X a palette swap of?</br>  <br>His new glasses make him look like a dumb hipster now<br><br><br> the dulling of colors absolutely everywhere and the unnecessary changes in color scheme for rhe characters. <br>Agreed so hard. Melty has so much better colors<br><br><br>Tohno gland<br><br>Hi Ayaka</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't wait to see his Nanaya persona with the new design. <br><br><br>Literally Saber again. The only one that doesn't look like Saber is Kohaku.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sup Sayjou</br>  <br>Ayaka who doesn't look completely bland.</br>  <br>Yeah I can't wait for the Nanaya scenes to get a Mahoyo treatment <br><br>The new designs suck ass but I'm still going to love it anyway if it gets Mahoyo tier action scenes</br></br></br>  <br><br>The best.</br></br>  <br><br>Shiki's skin was darker before. He looks rather pale in the new design. Not that I have a problem with that. He's more stereotypically attractive now. I guess that once you lose the eroge part they need to omnipander so the MC can't be plain anymore.</br></br>  <br>Nanaya is the sexiest man in TM, nobody comes close.</br>    Shiki is a second-rate hero because he couldn't SAVE EVERYONE.  <br>Can someone photoshop meodp on Shiki's new design?</br>  <br>Well Shiki is rather sickly and is having his lifeforce drained on occasion. He should look pale.</br>  <br>It is common knowledge that Tohno gland &gt; The BAR. <br><br>Also, since Shiki is a complete deviant you have a better chance of getting to fuck him.</br></br></br>  <br>I know plenty of dark skinned people who are very sickly though.</br>  <br>Is there anything Shiki wouldn't fuck?<br><br> Except Satsuki </br></br></br>  <br> Shirou saved Kirei <br> Shirou saved the maids <br> Shirou saved Bazett from Manjew <br> Shirou saved Ayako when she was raped by Rider <br> Illya ended up saving Shirou <br>Nah.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is Kirei there?</br>  <br>Shiki would fuck anything female. That's the essential point of his character.</br>  <br>Wannabee Vampires.<br> Like Satsuki. </br></br>  <br>If it moves, he can fuck it.</br>  <br>I'm incredibly disappointed by the change of local from a shitty small city because that was the best they could do with their shitty small doujin group to a big metropolis with big everything and fancy CGs that they can make thanks to their Fate/bucks. It's going to be a completely different game without the middle of nowhere feeling</br>  <br>You anon.</br>  <br><br>He didn't sleep with Hanepin did he? At least, not that I recall.</br></br>    <br>Rude</br>  <br>I don't think Ciel looks bad here, but there's a pretty glaring issue with this hair change. If you think about it, all five of the main heroines all have very homogenous hair styles now. All five have straight bangs that extend down to their eyes for their front hair, and Arcueid, Ciel, Kohaku, and Hisui all have extremely similar back hair now. Akiha is the only one with long hair, after all, but at least before Ciel used to have a completely different front hair than the rest of the cast, and her back hair was short, but rather spikey unlike the rest of the cast. Arcueid had her very unique and visually interesting hair vents to differentiate her style well enough from the rest of the cast, but now those are gone too.<br><br>The thing that concerns me most about the remake is the homogeneity of everything. Takeuchi can only draw one face, so he used to make up for it in eyelash, iris, hair, and outfit differences. It's a shame it's become so sterile, almost in a production line fashion.</br></br></br>  <br>Shirou is in Kirei's harem. Not the other way around.<br><br><br>Never forget that Nasu said Shiki has a more mature feel to him now because teens of this age have access to the internet. This remake will change lives.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can he sleep with this?</br>  <br><br>Didn't they say they wanted to make it a huge sprawling metropolis because it makes the story more "believable"?<br><br>As in, "The city is so large that anything can happen and for the most part, the city will still live on and it will go unnoticed except by a few". As opposed to being a small city in which word would spread fast among it's citizens and the whole city would be on alert.</br></br></br></br>  Time for the end of arc party and heavy exposition chapters.  And Luffy x Rebecca's engagement.  <br>God no, although I will admit I think she's joining the crew.</br>  <br> Rebecca joining </br>  <br> Rebecca won't join </br>  <br> I will admit I think she's joining the crew. <br><br>You're retarded <br><br>She has NO REASON to leave Dressrosa. Why the fuck should she hang out with pirates if her biggest ambition in life was getting her father back?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>People are finally starting to believe Rebecca will join the SH crew.<br><br><br>Her father is still young. She can live with him after she goes on an adventure with Luffy. That's what being a young girl is. She lived her whole life in a coliseum. She needs freedom, not a so-called home where she would be stuck until her forties.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be free since she's been a prisoner most of her life.</br>  <br> her biggest ambition in life was getting her father back <br>She didn't even remember him for half her life.</br></br>  I think Zoro will leave the crew soon  <br>Why? Get lost on the way back to the boat?</br>  Okay, fuckers, time to put everything into perspective.<br><br>- Law attacks Ceasar, to bring SAD down<br>- SAD gives Dofla ability to create SMILE<br>- SMILE is a manmade DF that gives you zoan powers<br>- One of yonko already has an army of SMILE zoans<br>- Law wants to fuck Ceasar, so he can fuck Dofla by bringing the yonko on him<br><br>Right now it seems like Luffy defeated Dofla, but Ceasar, the person who stood behind SAD and production of SMILE, was probably captured by another yonko - Big Mom.<br><br>So, possible clash of two yonko incoming?<br><br>Also - what's the possibility that Bepo is one of these zoan SMILE users?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>hopefully Rebecca stays put,while Leo,Manshelly and Kabu sneak aboard the ship. The healing and stitches are just too convenient .</br>  Will Law actually finish Doflamingo or will he leave it to Kaido?  <br>To avenge fell-down-some-stairs-girl.</br>   2015 <br> liking bread </br>  <br>Law sure is weird, harming a monkey over bread<br><br><br>Honestly there's too many factors because the treasure bomb will still be sent to Big Mom, we need to find out what will happen with Sanji and Co. Even if she is Lola's mum that doesn't mean she will immediately be an ally.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm really hoping next arc is a meanwhile arc of the others and has the crew from last arc away fighting Don so they get more focus and time to make up for their long absence. Then a big grand reunion.</br>  <br>The Marines already have Doffy. I doubt Law will go after him now that he's down from supporting Luffy so hard.</br>  As someone who got back into OP due to the hype around gear fourth, and reread the entirety of Dressrosa as of now, I must say it was a good arc to read through, but I honestly can't say why it was so long and what even happened over those 100 chapters, and I can't imagine waiting for two years to read all of this bit by bit.  Why does Dressrosa have so many princesses? Four in a single arc is a freaking overkill.  <br>Well, because the king had family? Not every princess is supposed to fulfill the same ltierary roll.</br>  Guys. Iceberg build a pool in Australia.  <br> Party <br> While half the crew is fighting a Yonkou <br> The weaker half <br><br>I wonder how Luffy's hunger matches up against his loyalty to his crew</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Viola has a higher chance of joining since she worked as an officer for the Doflamingo family for 10 years.</br>  So who was Spandam's backer? WG? Doffy? Kaidou?  <br>Shanks.</br>  Soon Law will be out of crews.  <br>She has zero chance of joining with being omniscient for fucking miles around.</br>  <br>Also she looks pretty much exactly like Robin.</br>  <br>That mustn't happen. Luffy will adopt him if that happens. Law needs to stay with his beloved crew.</br>  <br>but she got dem dick lips. Rebecca is a literal Nami clone and people think she has a better chance of joining.</br>  <br>Rebecca serves no purpose. Boring, weak, nothing to contribute. It would be better to have no new member at all.</br>  <br>Well they are retarded aswell.<br><br>I honestly don't know who would join at this point. Kinemon seems too, dunno, generic of a character, even though he is pretty helpful, but then he would be the third sword fighter on board.<br>The next likely would be Bartolomeo, but I don't think he would have good chemistry, and his personality gimmick would take the Sanji route of being fuck annoying pretty quickly. Plus, he has his own crew.<br><br>I think this arc won't have someone join, but rather make the Strawhats get alliances with other pirate crews of the new world.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How did a kingdom manage to be peaceful and passive for multiple centuries in the fucking New World?  <br>It's not like having a sword instantly makes you boring; a huge portion of the One Piece world uses swords, certainly more than 3/10. Kinemon can light his on fire, which is pretty cool. Different, at least. And if he ends up being a kitsune zoan user, he'd be perfect. It's not like Sanji was superfluous because Luffy already kicks things.</br>  This arc isn't about getting someone to join the active crew as much as it is building Luffy's future armada.<br><br>Though I due think we're overdue for the 9th member. It's been like seven years or something since Brook joined</br></br>  <br>I don't know. The coast guard?</br>  <br>I wish we'd focus on giving Brook some time to shine first... Maybe he'll get his own enies lobby one day.</br>  <br> It's not like Sanji was superfluous because Luffy already kicks things. <br>Not nearly as much as he punches things. How often does he even use Axe, Whip and Spear compared to his like 10 variations of Pistol?<br><br>Sanji is all about kicking from introduction</br></br></br></br>  Pica has a point here. Riku is a shit tier king  <br>Brook has had like one fucking full arc as a crewmate!</br>  <br> And if he ends up being a kitsune zoan user <br>He already has that clothes devil fruit though. A fox zoan would have been interesting though.</br></br>  <br>Zoro and Brook don't set things on fire nearly as much as Kinemon would.</br>  <br>I agree with this. Law did state that surviving in the New World means you should either be under the protection of the Yonkou or beat them. If you're going for the latter, it can't be done with a single pirate crew. Maybe this is how Luffy gets his alliances for survival?</br>  <br>Kitsune have a similar "leaf/stone on the head" disguise ability. Maybe he just doesn't understand how the transformation works, like momo</br>  <br>Cobra doesn't fight.</br>  <br> Mfw Thriller Bark was originally supposed to be before Enies Lobby </br>  So guys, what did Belammy did on Skypia?

Get lost on the way back to the boat? <br>I think Oda got rid of all those nasty time consuming thing like character traits and use it for far better things, like more and more characters.</br></br>  <br><br>Which route did he take to get to Skypia?</br></br>  <br> panda scans </br>  <br>There were routes other than the knock-up stream that were safer, but I don't remember what they were. But considering Bellamy was the only survivor from his crew, he may have used the stream.</br>  <br>You realize before Roger there was no great age of pirates, right? There were no Yonko, all these civilizations just existed. It was because Roger conquered the Grand Line that everyone else came into the New World and began taking countries for themselves and when that happened, Doffy took Dressrosa so they didn't survive being passive in the New World as we know it now for more than a decade.</br>  <br>How is Rebecca deconfirmed?<br>How is Bellamy deconfirmed? I mean he's more likely to join Laws crew for a new era of Donquixote pirates</br></br>  <br>New World still must have been pretty intense if only Roger ever made it to Raftel</br>  <br>Exactly, that's why nobody would have ever conquered Dressrosa, the SEAS were intense, not the lands. Nobody wanted to sail the seas and nobody had fully done so before Roger and it was thought impossible so nobody was even trying to conquer these countries.</br>  <br> Rebecca <br>"My daughter, you will never have to fight again"<br> Bellamy <br>Cause he's dead? (Not that I believe he is, though I still doubt he'll join anyone)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bartolomeo would make the perfect cabin boy, though, Luffy needs his Shanks/Buggy if he's going to be Pirate King<br><br>And someone already explained that in Japanese culture cannibal is basically their term for troll, he doesn't eat people, he trolls them as seen in his first appearance</br></br></br>  <br> Knock Up stream either kills all or brings all up alive <br> Others routes people tend to die on the way </br></br>  <br>Who is Momonosuke?</br>  <br>A fucking piece of shit character that needs to die.</br>  <br>For the thousandth time, those were Kyros words, not Rebeccas. People still can't see that we truly havent' heard her opinion on her own nature, especially considering she went after Doffy at the end.</br>  <br> Bartolomeo would make the perfect cabin boy, though, Luffy needs his Shanks/Buggy if he's going to be Pirate King <br><br>Momonosuke.</br></br></br>  <br> Why does he wear the mask? </br>  <br>I always thought this is bullshit.<br>Of course there can people fall from the boat and die.</br></br>  <br> getting ntr'd by a fictional child </br>  <br>Are you actually retarded, all she has told Luffy in the time they were together in the Colosseum is how she dreams of one day living with the toy soldier. She never wanted to fight, he made her get stronger because he might not always be there for her. Now he is there. They will be together or Oda's a terrible (as in inconsistent) writer.</br>  <br>Didn't she herself at one point say she didn't want to fight?</br>  <br> People still can't see that we truly havent' heard her opinion on her own nature <br><br>I think we got a pretty good view of her character.<br>She refuses to directly kill anybody.<br><br>Not very useful trait for a pirate.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Good points she probably won't join after all then. Only way it's possible is if she saw herself as useless and saw the Strawhats as a way to get stronger.</br></br></br>  <br>Straw hats never kill anybody.</br>  <br>They've killed thousands of mooks.<br><br>They've not killed many named characters.<br>Not for lack of trying, just once you have a name in the world of OP, you have nearly invincible plot armor even as a secondary or tertiary character.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not that she refuses to kill, everyone does that, it's that she refuses to fight offensively or strike a person. It's like Sanji and Zoro are with women except she's like that with everyone.</br>  <br>This. Scarlet was wet over Kyros. Wouldn't surprise me that a sixteen year old would do the same.<br><br>Actually, I'd be surprised if she DIDN'T have any feeling for him. It'd be funny to have someone swoon over Luffy that's not an aging Christmas Cake(I love Boa, mind you but the age difference is grating).<br><br><br>To make her own decisions. To become an adult and to be free and live with someone who acknowledges her existence and bloodline in a good light. Do you read One Piece, nigga?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>shes so fucking weak though, what use would she be to the crew?</br>  <br>Okay, what kind of decisions would she want to make? Why would she join Luffy out of the blue? She doesn't even have a dream.</br>  <br><br> mfw if Oda was a different kind of shounen mangaka, this would be the start of a love triangle between Luffy, Hancock and Rebecca </br></br>  <br> To make her own decisions. To become an adult and to be free and live with someone who acknowledges her existence and bloodline in a good light <br>Okay so what kind of decisions would those be?<br><br>Did the citizens of Dressrosa suddenly stop not hating the Riku family now that they know what happened? Why wouldn't they view her in a good light?<br><br>You're making things up for the character that you want to see and aren't actually there</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dunno if that's even quite right, though she manages to ring out opponents in the coliseum it's not like she doesn't know she's dooming them to be fighting fish food, could rationalize it like saying a body slam isn't a direct attack, you're letting the ground do the damage. As for her thing with toy soldier, super unclear because of the whole memory shit.</br>  <br> powerlevel fags </br>  Bellamy ;_;  <br> tripfags </br>  Big Mom or Kaido?<br><br>Who will turn out to be stronger?</br></br>  <br>Her love Doffy and her sister Sugar.</br>  <br>She's a CoO user that nearly kept up with Hakuba, seemed to impress even Sabo, the overpowered fuck.</br>  <br>Why do you think Kaido is called the strongest creature in the world?</br>  <br>The point of Rebecca having CoO is to show that Haki is freaking common in the New World. Same goes for Chinjao.</br>  <br>Some bullshit I'm sure. No way he's stronger than Whitebeard or Kizaru or whatever</br>  <br> Her love Doffy <br><br>I want shipperfags to leave</br></br></br>  <br>With Oda's sneakiness, if she told her dream to Kyros or someone else before they became a toy, she may not have remembered it until very recently, but they had things to do so there's been no time to chat about it. Course that's just a guess, but an easy out if Oda makes hell anyone in this arc have a sudden desire to do something seemingly random.</br>  <br>Except no one else could dodge Hakuba. barto had to use barriers, and Robin was lucky due to her distance, if she was closer she may not have reacted on time.<br><br> inb4 speed means nothing to her, she would still have to react and use her powers </br></br></br>  <br>Big Mom will probably be the weakest of the Yonko cause shes female</br>  <br> I want shipperfags to leave <br><br>This and Rebeccafags</br></br></br>  <br> nearly kept up with Hakuba <br><br>Because getting whacked in the helmet so hard it flies off, your head starts bleeding, and fall you to the ground from shock is nearly keeping up. She couldn't even keep up with Diamante.<br><br>It was plot stupidity that Hakuba slashed everyone in their stomach or back, but only Rebecca got hit in head, the only part of her body with armor. Otherwise she jobs harder than Dellinger.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Unfortunately that will be the most likely case.</br>  <br>Think about it. Violet never really befriended anyone in the crew, he saw Baby 5 as a sister and Jora is too old. <br><br>Her being Doffy,s lover is not far fetched at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Out of all those gladiators who are supposedly big names in the new world only the Rebecca had it? Super fucking common right?</br>  <br>Whitebeard is dead though.</br>  <br> Her love Doffy </br>    <br>I'm still waiting for him and Ace to pull a desert hawkman and turn out to have survived.</br>  <br>Why aren't mono and kinemon in the same tier?</br>  <br>Rebecca's hopefully not getting in, her character arc's been wrapped up and she doesn't really contribute anything to the crew.<br><br>Bellamy would be cool to see, he's my favourite candidate, but I think he's more realistically going to join Law's crew, having a Doflamingo tattoo and all.<br><br>Viola's good, her role would make sense as a scout as well.<br><br>Mononosuke's probably going to stick around as a cabin boy.<br><br>Barto and the rest of the side characters are probably going to end up forming a Strawhat fleet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> it was all an act! </br></br>  <br>Bellamy needs to get rid of his "senpai notice me" complex, he's better off not joining anyone. He should remain a loner or gather himself a new crew.</br>  <br> who is whitebeard? <br> who is ace <br> who is vergo  <br> who is Monet </br></br></br></br>  <br>They don't have to join together. There's a theory that they're not even related.</br>  <br>The four dead named characters,  two of whom are alive </br>  <br><br> two of whom are alive <br><br>Yeah, Ace and Whitebeard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not going to happen, he wants to survive the great wave so the Heart Pirates or the Strawhats would be the best option for him. Or perhaps he realises that they are the great wave?</br>  <br><br><br>You really don't read One Piece, do you?<br> Prisoner due to her bloodline <br> Everyone hates her <br> Fights against her will in a stadium where her name is cursed and scorned <br> Suddenly some adventure loving simpleton comes in and shows admiration for her simply because she fed him <br> Sees that her situation was the same as Ace's, gets angry because of it, also reminds him of where he grew up in, a slum <br> Finds out Doflamingo was behind her and her grandfather's situation, wants to stop him <br> Tells her explicitly to stay near his crew, he'll take out Doflamingo <br> She wants to do her part, but Kyros and Viola say otherwise, telling her what they want her to do <br> Luffy unsurprisingly keeps to his word, takes out Doflamingo, she runs to his side, cries over him excessively <br><br>Source, the fucking manga. I'm sick of you people</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That doesn't say anything, she's still useless.</br></br>  <br>Violet can see everything going on for a huge radius around her, would spoil Luffy's fun too much, really she's like a weird spinoff of Otohime who could geel her subject's distress, Violet can see it.</br>  <br>So? She likes Luffy like everyone he's ever fucking met. He helped her. That does't change the fact that for the first time in a decade, she has a happy home and a loving family to return to. A much better alternative than being liability tits on a pirate crew with much better alternative options in this arc alone</br>  <br>So you want Luffy to accept her out of pity? I'm sick of you.</br>  I'm going to be the next Strawhat Pirate crew!<br><br><br>Can't wait to see Nami's tits!</br></br></br>  <br><br>Noice.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, u jelly?<br><br><br>I'm gonna take #selfie with Luffy and Zoro after I finish packing up and settle down in Thousand Sunny and post it on Facebook and Twitter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He was already kind of impressed with her haki and he didn't even see the Hakuba part.</br>  <br>But kinemon has a higher chance to join. Since its canon that he's momos dad he won't let his son go on a pirate trip. Also when Shanks and buggy joined they were around 14-15 maybe even 16. When luffy wanted to join shanks denied him because he was 7. Momo is only 8. He's too young to be sailing with them.</br>  <br><br>fuk u m80, i'll shit on ur mum, pls.</br></br>  <br>I agree.</br>  <br><br>u fukin wot m8 i'll smack u in the gabber and rek ur gran m8, ye ur gran m8 I swear on me mum</br></br>  <br>Not everyone has to be a powerhouse like Zoro and Sanji. Remember Usopp? He was weak and look at how far he got. Tactics and strategy can win fights too, you know, the two things people criticize shonen series for dropping in favor of pure power? Robin doesn't fight much for a reason.<br><br><br>Same can be said for Nami. She didn't have to stay with Luffy. She had her village back. She could have stayed home and then decide to go back to map making.<br><br><br>Where did I say anything about pity? He likes her simply because she fed him and she's nice. Plus, she has skills in combat. You think fighting is all about killing and attacking. Note how when some characters joined the Straw Hats they suddenly gained a new trait or two?<br> Chopper becomes cowardly and more childlike <br> Sanji's love for women gets cranked up <br> Zoro having no sense of direction <br> Nami being a gold-digger for the sake of it and not because she wants to save her home <br>You think Rebecca's gonna stay the same? You know for a fact she'll remain 'useless' as you state?<br><br>I reiterate: You faggots don't read the manga. I bet you don't even watch the anime and just spew shit based on what other people say without even looking for a source.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nami had already been traveling with Luffy for 3 arcs previously, had a dream that involved accompanying Luffy, and had skills which would be useful to Luffy. She was also an interesting character  back then . None of these things can be said about Rebecca.</br>  <br><br>Never said powerhouse - I'm not talking about fights, I'm talking about use.<br><br>She's useless - even Brook at least has a use.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Agreed but you could have typed  a bit better. But yeah she still has room for character development, I'll be severely dissapointed if Dressrosa is the end of character completely because she never had a satisfying resolution in her character arc.</br>  Guys please stop arguing, I'm the next Strawhat Pirate crew. Being talked and praised does not make me happy at all!  <br>She'll certainly come back in some context-- One Piece is great about revisiting stuff. But she is not an interesting enough character to join the main cast. Not even close.</br>  <br> even I am not aware of it <br>So what? Didn't Spandam get the last devils fruit reference catalog like Blackbeard and Sanji?</br></br>  <br>Also Robin's dark and cute obsessions.</br>  <br><br>When will people learn</br></br>  <br>Fair enough. I'm just sick of faggots thinking every character has to fill a role to become a Straw Hat or have some insane ability to join. Usopp joined simply because Luffy considered him a friend. Luffy gives no fucks about what you can do. Brook was asked to join before he knew of his music or Laboon's relationship with him.<br><br><br>But Barto is, right? Gotta love that tired sempai gimmick, right?<br><br><br>Honestly, she could have went with someone else who wasn't a pirate. Hell, she saw what kind of person he was and still ditched him until he beat Arlong. And your spoiler brings me to ask this: If she's not interesting now, what's the harm in bringing in another uninteresting character? Hell, she looks like her, and is fairly new. Out with the old.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Rebecca thread   I wouldn't necessarily have a problem with it if they replaced Nami with Rebecca. It would still be dumb, but that would be preferable than just adding her on. But obviously Nami wouldn't get replaced, and we would have two characters on the crew who are a walking pair of tits taking up twice the time they already do now. And who the fuck was Nami ever supposed to meet in East Blue who was not a pirate, but also planning to travel to the end of Grand Line?  <br>Robin isn't a walking pair of tits?</br>  <br>B-but the poneglyphs</br>  Cool Robin.

He has a unique design, an interesting ability that makes him useful but not overpowered, a better developed personality even if you don't like his quirk, and some fucking reason that he would want to join the crew in the first place.<br><br>But Bart isn't even the only other option. Cavendish, Bellamy, Violet, Leo, Law, Ceasar... there are many other characters from this arc alone who would make better strawhats than Rebecca, for more than one of the above mentioned reasons. There is no redeeming quality about Rebecca that makes her a good candidate. You're basing this entirely on her liking Luffy, and the possibility that Oda will make her less boring in the future. You could say the same about Kyros. Or most of the people Luffy has ever interacted with.</br></br></br>  <br>But guns killed Whitebeard</br>  <br>Robin is the only person in the world who can read poneglyphs, has a unique and interesting personality, has an interesting devil fruit power, knows more about the world than anyone else in the crew, has a connection to the revolutionaries, has a compelling reason why she has to stay with Luffy and company, and has tits.</br>  <br> Everyone hates her <br>No one hates her.<br> Finds out Doflamingo was behind her and her grandfather's situation, wants to stop him <br>This problem is over.<br> Tells her explicitly to stay near his crew, he'll take out Doflamingo <br>So what? He wanted to protect his friend, of course he's going to want her to stay close to his crew. Doesn't mean he wants her to join.<br> Luffy unsurprisingly keeps to his word, takes out Doflamingo, she runs to his side, cries over him excessively <br>Once again, so what? Her conflict is solved, she has no reason to stay by Luffy's side. What reason would she have to travel with a group of pirates? She said herself, her dream was to live with Kyros.<br><br>And like I said before, she's weak. Just because she has Observation Haki doesn't make her an automatic candidate to join the crew. Her fighting style is boring as hell, and her personality is boring as well. What is she going to do, trip all her enemies to fall into the water? She doesn't even wield and actual sword for fuck sakes. I just can't wait for Luffy to leave Dressrosa without Rebecca to demolish you autistic rebeccafags.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Robin is my favorite christmas cake!  <br><br>Post Robin.</br></br>  <br> I bet you don't even watch the anime <br>opinion fucking discarded</br></br>  <br>Nice one, bro! Upvoted!</br>  <br>strong world robin best robin</br>  <br><br>Fuck yes.</br></br>    <br>The everyone hating them thing is kind of abstract yet seemingly how the crew fit together, they were all sort of misfits in some way in their home before the SHs, Rebecca would fit as the hated gladiator in the everyone hates her regard, but it's not like there's an official checklist.</br>  <br>Vivi had a better chance of joining. She had tits bigger than nami. She was different from nami. She could fight and probably beat rebecca. She even interacted with all the crewmembers. But rebecca has only interacted with luffy and robin. All of the strawhats that joined interacted with the strawhats that were already there. Now I know she could not see the Sanji team because they weren't there but what about zoro and ussop and franky? She hasn't said a word to them. I don't think she's even seen franky. Also after 10 years she gets to see her dad, aunt and grandpa again. Why would she leave. And by joining the crew she will have to pick up a sword and fight. Last time I read the series her dad ain't cool with that. Plus if she gets a bounty she just can't return to the island when the adventure is done. They will be risking their power by protecting her. And king riku wants what's best for the people and would not want to risk losing his kingdom AGAIN. Also she doesn't even own a personal weapon. It was broken. And what about the gladiators that were kept in the colloseum until they won 1000 battles? She hasn't even seen them to ask how their enjoying their feeedom. And luffy won't be on dressrosa for long. He might stay for a party but it will be as short as the feast they had on punk hazard which only lasted one or two hours. Also this whole dressrosa arc happened in ONE DAY. when did she have time to properly have a reunion with her dad? Or the other prison gladiators? Or the rest of the family? Luffy also can't stay on dressrosa with all the the marines around. It's just like in alabasta when tashigi and the marines helped the strawhats stop the battle between rebels and the kingdom. After that crocodile was arrested and they went back to to trying to capture the strawhats and would have succeded if it wasn't for Bon clay. So luffy doesn't have time to wait for rebecca. He hasn't invited her at all and she hasn't ever implied she wanted to join</br>  <br>All of those are reaching. Especially Caesar and Cavendish. Barto's quirk already made me dislike him and he'd be no better than Brook with his bone jokes, which people hate. You want another Brook on the crew? And he has his own crew and state in fucking 773 that he won't join. Do you read the manga?<br><br>Law the only one you get, and even then, he has his own crew as well. Viola is the princess, she can't join and her ability makes Luffy's purpose for adventure null. You'd know that if you read the manga, but you don't. Caesar is irredeemable at this point and has a connection with Big Mom and Kaidou. He's either gonna get killed or get turned in to the Marines. Bellamy, I don't think will join. He may go on a path to find himself and a new purpose.<br><br><br>All I said in that post was during the entire arc. And the rest of your post is funny. But what else to expect from faggots like you who can't string a good argument together?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm afraid I would have to disagree anon-kun</br>  <br>2 of those are not even princesses</br>  <br> Sees that her situation was the same as Ace's, gets angry because of it, also reminds him of where he grew up in, a slum <br> She wants to do her part <br>That was never said. Stop pulling things out of your ass.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think any of these people will join, Rebecca included, but Rebecca is at the bottom of the list. She serves absolutely no purpose, and you have yet to confront that in hours of shitposting. I would take a dozen extra Brooks before a shittier Nami.<br><br>But, you're just making insults now, so I'm done with actual arguments. Hurr durr you're a dumb faggot you don't read the manga etc etc You can come up with these yourself buddy</br></br></br>  <br>The first part was heavily implied when Luffy got all mad at the spectators hating her for her family ties or some such.</br>  It's unlikely, but i'd like it Caesar to join the SHs.   Doflamingo  is the next SH crew  <br>Luffy got mad because they were offending a person that was nice to him. The rest is just your headcanon.</br>  <br> All of those are reaching. Especially Caesar and Cavendish. <br><br>I don't think he meant they WOULD actually join, just that even they have a higher chance of joining than Rebecca. <br><br>Personally I don't think anyone will join this arc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Proof you don't have anymore to say.<br> Hurr you insulted me ;_; <br>Same with you. I got a life outside this shithole.<br><br><br> I don't read the manga, but I know what I'm talking about! <br><br>I'll end with this: If she doesn't join, so be it. There's way more for me to look forward to that I won't get angry and pouty over her joining. I got Jinbe coming in, and all the other world building events to follow. One little disappointment won't deter me from the rest of the story.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but anon! Caesar has already joined the SHs</br>  <br>*over her not joining</br>  <br>Just because everyone hated her doesn't mean much. No one hates her now. Besides, only a few crew members were actually hated, or at least disliked by everyone (Franky, Usopp, Robin). I don't know what you're getting at.</br>  <br>you dont insult people that feed Luffy<br><br>He tried to kill Zoro when he thought Zoro mercilessly killed his benefactors</br></br></br>  <br>  I got a life outside this shithole. <br><br>If so why keep shit posting?</br></br></br>  <br><br> I got a life outside this shithole </br></br>  <br>That would look nice and all if it weren't for the crappily photoshopped background.</br>  <br>if he didn't do that shit with the children i'd be pretty sure that he'd be likely to become a friend at least. <br><br>anyway, he'll still be part of the next arc (maybe even next two) so it's fine, because i like him as a character.</br></br></br>    <br> I got a life outside this shithole. <br>Then leave?</br></br>  <br>Perhaps they'll keep him until they meet Vegapunk, then leave him behind as Vega's new pet/assistant</br>  Baby 5 is joining the crew, she thinks luffy said she's here to save her. And I seriously think oda has to fix her.  <br>  One little disappointment  <br>Yeah,that's why you are replying at every single post doubting her entrance in the crew. Because you clearly don't care much about her joining. I hope someone screencaps all of these posts so we can remember how retarded rebeccafags are.</br></br>  <br>Luffy being opinionated is a thing that never quite stops being a thing<br><br>that Rebecca is in his thoughts at all is because she fed him</br></br></br>   This guy will still think Rebecca will join even after they leave   <br>Please. B-5 is going to disappear with Sai, only ever to be seen again on a cover 100 chapters off<br><br>Oda isnt interested in fixing his perfect idea of a waifu</br></br></br>  <br>That is an oddly specific memory to conjure up for someone that just bought him food. But sure, don't acknowledge that confirms a detail brought up.</br>  <br>Don't worry, it's only a chapter or two more before Rebecca is confirmed gone forever</br>  <br> she thinks luffy said she's here to save her <br>She's going with Sai anon</br></br>  <br>Sai will fix her  with his dick </br>  <br> I don't care about Rebecca joining and I have a life which is why I reply to everybody who doesn't think the same way I do and have been for months now </br>  <br> for someone that just bought him food <br><br>how did you manage to type that whole sentence out and still not realize how stupid you were being?</br></br></br>  <br>How is this related to Ace or the slums,at all<br>There he's just thinking at how his grandpa is different to him but he doesn't hate him for that</br></br>  <br>Reminder that Sai will bang this now whenever he wants</br>  <br> Do you think full-boy haki makes their dick black and hard as well? </br>  <br>That lucky hideous bastard.</br>  <br>not even mad, Sai is a pretty swell guy</br>  <br>Not the one that brought that up, but it's loosely tied together, the gladiator prisoners could remind Luffy of the trash heap and slums he lived in, they're the rejects and such of the upper class and all that, and Ace was resentful of his connection to Roger because people shunned him for it or some such, though not sure if he told Luffy much of it.<br>Even those, it was already a connection Luffy felt shared I suppose for whatever it's worth.</br></br>  <br>If it was like that,Luffy would have thought of Ace and Roger,not Chinjao and Garp.</br>  <br>He still compared Dressrosa to his home country and the Grey Terminal.</br>  <br>As I said, loosely tied, and as my last statement pointed out, he still felt a connection, not sure why the original poster thought it necessary to connect that much as Luffy already seemed to feel some kinship having to read into it.<br><br>That I don't entirely recall exactly, that might have been in reference to the toys, I think. Always helps to find the page and post it so we don't have to dig so much.</br></br></br>  <br>Thinking she won't become the straw hats 1st division commander</br>  <br>Ah, found it.</br>  <br> giving her Bartolomeo's role <br><br>nah. First and Second division are reserved for Romeo and Cabbagedish. Third will go to Bellamy since it'd make him happy. Then Chinjao, the giant I forget the name of, Ideo, then Blue Gilly, Abdullah and Jeet, then maybe uh.. Duval, then Moocy<br><br>Gatz will be honorary, Kyros will be the rich uncle who sends the SHs checks for ridiculous amounts of Berries. Rebecca gets to lick the stamp. Maybe.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can someone remind me again, what the point of him as hostage was?</br>  <br>No, re-read Punk Hazard and it's ending</br>  <br>Caesar is Doffy's pet cashcow (or goat, whatever)<br><br>he's needed to make Smiles.

Considering that Kaidou needs 1000 animal zoans just to increase his power against Shanks a little bit, how fucking strong is he?  <br><br>When Roger got to Raftel, Buggy and Shanks had a fight. Buggy knocked Shanks onto the pedastal that the One Piece was situated on.<br><br>Touching it caused Shanks to obtain Yonko-level intimidation powers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't think pirates are exactly against having a harem, though it's questionable if Luffy has any sex drive.</br>  Why didnt the marines search for viola and especially baby 5? When they found the executives they said something along the lines of "All eight exeutives found" which suggests that they knew the structures of the Donquixote family. So why didnt they include viola and baby 5 in their list of wanted executives? <br>It doesnt look like the executives werent mysterious unknown individuals with them being advertised in the colliseum matches and all, Viola left the family just earlier in the morning and baby 5 got engaged to Sai mere hours ago so information couldnt have spread that fast.</br>  <br>Didn't Luffy take out a few hundred in FI with CoC? Shanks can probably do more at higher strengths.</br>  <br>It could be a small one like on punk hazard</br>  <br>Riku would pardon Viola, Sai would be forced to run away with Baby 5 without saying his goodbyes. <br><br>No real point in Oda wasting panels on that.</br></br></br>  <br>There were probably a few marines nearby watching, and the allies would vouch for the ones they are unsure of. I think Fujitora was with Violet for a whole since she was basically calling or what was happening.</br>  Why is chapter 233 so good?  <br><br> sai trying to break through marine lines, defending baby 5 with his life <br> Chinjao and Boo helping out because shes now a part of the family <br> random marine asks why theyre defending a criminal <br> says they just need to detain all executives including baby 5 <br> "they need me" <br> baby 5 runs towards the marines and cuffs herself <br> everyones confused <br> marriage canceled <br> baby 5 rots in impel down <br> happy anyways since she was needed, by the entire marines/WG <br><br> not worth wasting panels on <br> countless other possibilities </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I get the feeling that that was supposed to sound depressing but it comes off as kind of dumb</br>  <br>Which one is that?</br>  <br> Buggy is searching for Cpt.

Her personality isn't distinct enough either.<br><br>Also, Luffy hasn't referred to her as nakama or asked her to join and there hasn't been given any special emphasis towards her dream, which means he's not interested. Plus, she's too nice to be a pirate, even a "good" pirate. She's set to be queen of Dressrobe after Riku, too.</br></br></br>  <br>well good job not explaining how a barely there romance is well written and not just slapped on at the end</br>  <br> who will be the man behind the curtain? <br>Vegapunk<br><br> Toto? <br>Any zoan user on any of those crews with model: small dog...lol<br><br> what about all the witches? <br>No thoughts on this one</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dont rile them up again<br><br>they only JUST settled down again</br></br></br>  <br> Any zoan user on any of those crews with model: small dog...lol <br><br>What if:<br><br> Dalmation goes after Bonney <br> Bonney turns him into a small child <br> carries him around like a pursedog </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you talking about SAO or FMA?</br>  <br>He saved a bunch of pirates. Also Doffy called him God so they may think he's actually the most dangerous of the crew</br>  <br><br>Daily reminder that Vegapunk will be a vegan.<br>He will be Luffy's opposite extreme. Meat-eating dumbass vs. vegan genius. Expect lots of bickering and mutual hate.</br></br></br>  <br>FMA<br><br>never did finish SAO</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Rebecca will join but<br> Her face isn't distinct enough, her personality isn't distinct enough either <br>This is Oda we're talking about. The guy who thinks cloning Nami and giving her braids makes for a brand new character design.</br></br></br>  <br> Rebecca gets to lick the stamp </br>  <br>Waiting for it</br>  <br>No, Cesar Clown was fodder. Doffy is just a gradual stepping stone to Kaidou.</br>  So I think we can all agree that this guy has an ant zoan devil fruit. Ants are after all the strongest organism. Also it would make a lot of sense and tie into drake. When drake was a kid he followed a weakling captain. Dinosaurs are usually stronger than ants. This is probably a mental thing drake has and supports kaido being an ant zoan. Also In Hunter x Hunter the strongest character was an ant.  <br> implying the WG isn't going to twist the news and blame Dressrosa on God Usopp to save face </br>  <br>But not a crew member. Not someone who will be a consistent character and around all the way to the end of the manga</br>  <br>All the SH look distinct as fuck, even though Nami and Robin have the same bodytype their faces are blatantly different. Side characters get a lot of sameface but a main character is going to have to have her own look.</br>  <br>Thing is Fuji already admitted WG fucked up though</br>  <br>I have a feeling that Wano arc will be preceded by Zou micro arc, as well as maybe having Kaidou arc be concluded in another location as a small follow up arc (similar to Water 7 and Ennis Lobby). Or there's also a possibility that Small but considerable Big Mom arc will take place before Wano.</br>  How do you guys get the weely Viz translations?  <br>What Fujitora says now and what the WG will end up putting out may be completely different stories, though. Fuji is an honourable man, but the WG is not and would likely prefer to save face and their "official" report will likely implicate the SH pirates in the chaos.</br>  <br>Mature women don't dress like strippers, girls do. The only reason she's wearing that outffit in Z is because she's ten years younger and the skin of her belly doesn't sag.<br>The green sweater is the most mature outfit, by the common acceptation of the word.</br></br>  <br>But it's not ara~ ara~ enough</br>  <br>Hopefully you're right and I'm wrong. I'm pessimistic about Oda's willingness to work on his female designs though. These days it seems like hourglass Nami clone + new hairstyle are his only standards.</br>   movie Robin outfit discussion <br> no mention of gangster gunslinger Robin </br>  <br>Buggy is the fraud behind the curtain<br>Big Mom is the Wicked Witch<br>Good witch and Toto are more plot devices than characters</br></br></br>  <br>It's shonen. You've got to lower your standards.</br>  <br> hellsing <br> romance <br>Nigga wat. Everyone in that show was blueballed, nothing ever came of anything. It was an orgy of violence, written by a hentai artist with clothes/glasses/gloves fetishes. no actual sex/bodies are necessary for him to get off.</br></br></br>  My favourite Robin is Armani Robin.<br>I know I'm the only one though.</br>  <br>Too late, Fuji and Elizabello have already spread the news all over the world. WG won't be able to cover it up with lies even if they try.</br>  <br> tiger and bunny  <br>What romance was there beside Tiger and Bunny's</br></br>  <br> Hipster Zoro <br><br>Jesus</br></br></br>  <br>No, I was asking a question and the answer obviously is "there are basically none".</br>  <br>Glasses do suit him though.</br>  <br>I have this bad feeling he will be involved somehow</br>  <br>He's perfectly capable of drawing weird looking women, and women that are odd looking but still attractive.<br>For example, Perona is very visually distinctive, and still conforms to "hot".<br><br>Unfortunately my faith in him doesn't extend to a "non hot" female MC, despite how much I love characters like Miss Monday's design.</br></br></br></br>  <br>All their gang-star outfits in their movie were great. This is still my favourite luffy design.</br>  <br>Alucard/Integra is my only  het  ship<br><br>Celes and the dude with the hair was cute but  absorbing the fucker  isnt exactly a romance i'd consider to be written well</br></br></br>  <br> miss monday <br> not hot </br></br>  <br><br>This.<br><br>This is Fuji's entire motivation for hating the shichi system.<br><br>Doffy really is Croc 2.0</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Unfortunately my faith in him doesn't extend to a "non hot" female MC <br>Exactly. It's such a shame. I love Miss Monday's post timeskip's design too.</br></br>  <br>I meant "non hot" in the sense that Oda only likes to draw women he thinks are hot/are conventionally hot, hence the hourglass figures and pretty faces.<br>I would personally let Miss Monday crush my pelvis, but that's neither here nor there.</br></br>  <br>Blue Rose had that one sided crush on Kotetsu. Other than that I don't remember.</br>  <br> beside Tiger and Bunny' <br><br>uh.  Non- oh! Tiger and his dead wife? Keith and the robot girl he killed? <br/> <br>Bunny was thirsty enough to satisfy anyone's craving for romance</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, damn, I forgot about it, that was so annoying.</br>  <br>they're all so cute<br><br>Luffy's shorts are way too short there though. Not sure how I never noticed</br></br></br>  <br>   Keith and the robot girl he killed?  <br>Why did you have to remind me of this<br>Okay I'll give you that one</br></br></br>  <br>The only one I can think of is fma but not brotherhood.</br>  <br>Oh yeah! Sadly both were given only a single episode though</br>   instead of fucking around like Hitman Reborn <br>What, did he just, fuck a bunch of whores left and right before settling down for the short haired chick ?</br>  <br> I went to find the Sky High will Wait video but it's gone <br><br>Poor Keith</br></br></br>  <br>You mean Dante and Hodenheim?</br>   read more mature stuff like tokyo ghoul <br><br>They're different genres</br></br>  <br>Aren't they both shonen ? Or do you not consider shonen to be a genre ?</br>  <br>valid points...</br>  <br>I remember reading years ago about how some people criticized Oda for not drawing "pretty enough" girls or some such.</br>  Sunny Day Song &gt; Angelic Angel. By far, it's not even funny.<br><br> Can't wait to actually watch the 200+ idol performance in the movie. </br></br>  <br>The Heartbeart song is shit though.</br>  <br>All the class-designated songs are shit. I can't even try to listen to the earlier 2nd year song on the Angelic Angel CD.</br>   Honk   What should imouto call her brother?  <br>Onii-chan is kinda childish but always good, other acceptable choices are nii-san, aniki and name-kun. Onii-sama is by far the worst.</br>  Tch and other clicking tongue sounds.  Onee-chan  <br>*Onee-sama</br>  Onee-shama  "No! Please don-"  I'm no Nip, but if I was I'd feel kinda weirded out if my sister didn't just call me by my name.  <br>Aniki I like the best. Nii-san is OK, onii~ is good aswell. And there is the obvious onichan</br>   Koibito   Gomi-kun  Niinii  Nothing because an Imouto should only open her mouth to insert a dick or food inside.  <br>I feel like aniki is kind of rare. I like it.</br>  My imouto calls me 'dude'.  <br>That's not a imouto that's a monster.</br>  <br>Best imouto.</br>  Nissan  <br>You're lame.</br>  <br><br>What do little girls ride?<br> Their Nissan. </br></br></br>  <br> cockslave </br>  Nii nii!  <br>Nii-sama</br>  <br>*pomf*</br>  <br>cunt nugget</br>  <br>Dude</br>  Hentai-Oniichan    <br>fam</br>  Aniki  <br> my imouto calls me slave <br>funny to play with her though becasue she get embarrased while trying to give orders. No sexual thoughts so dont go think weird shit.</br></br>  <br>bruh</br>  <br>Aniki.</br>  Aniue<br><br>Get on my level, plebs</br></br>  <br>underrated post</br>  Onii-chan is the best.<br><br><br>This one is good as well.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't hear it anymore.</br>  <br>I miss the days when my Imouto had a cute name for me. Everything becomes rotten eventually.</br>  <br><br>My imouto calls me by my childhood nickname  when she wants something from me , she sometimes will even deliberately use a childish voice imitating the way she used to speak when she was little.<br><br>It's SUPER EFFECTIVE.</br></br></br></br>  Nii-nii  <br>That's cute, I envy you.</br>  <br>It's about as weird as calling your parents "mom" or "dad", using a first name would either be too disrespectful or too intimate.</br>  Always onii-chan  <br>Poor Miya</br>  <br> Onii-sama is by far the worst. <br><br>Onii-sama is a perfectly acceptable choice.</br></br></br>  <br>Why has nobody checked these yet? Check em.</br>  <br><br>#1 imouto</br></br>  Onii-chan during sex. Nothing else matters.  <br> during sex </br>  <br>Imoutos are meant to have sex with their onii-chans</br>  <br><br>Not actually sex with her onii-chan, silly boy. She calls out "onii-chan" while being plowed by the captain of the football team.</br></br>    <br>Yes. An imouto fucking her onii-chan only makes her purer.</br>    <br> 127727777 <br> 7777 <br>YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</br></br></br>  <br>Then why is it that best imoutos are the ones who do not have sex with their oniichans?</br>  <br>An imouto remains eternally childish which is why it works so well.</br>  <br> Onii-sama is by far the worst. <br>I think you mean the best. Just the best.</br></br>  <br> cunt nugget <br><br>Sounds like you got a defective imouto. You should take her back for an exchange.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't like that weird NBR but not really shit they pulled.</br>  Why do we hate her again?  <br> being THIS new </br>  <br>So Maeda is going to do the Okamoto Lynn thing now? <br>Kids with superpowers in research facility?
