The initial prototype. So they are not the same. TNH was lighter and had different armament.<br>Pz 39 aka LTH is moreover based on LTL tank, which was smaller and even lighter than TNH.<br><br>Ironically enough, the very LTL tank never entered service as it was meant, thanks to Soviet annexation of Lithuania, and was later redesigned into LT-40 for Slovakia.</br></br></br></br>  <br> what is foreshadowing since episode motherfucking one? </br>  <br>Different info that I had.

Not being a dick. That's the actual answer right here in front of you.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Constant near misses are historically accurate, while also being good for drama. Remember that almost all shots in GuP are taken on the move on a moving target which is never a good way to actually hit something.<br><br>Also that, again for the sake of drama, the tanks are faster that real life across the board while the tank engagements are usually closer than they would have been.</br></br></br></br>  <br> thinking size matters in GuP </br>  <br>My point is that I am German. I can't really tell what's parody and what not because I am German.<br><br>I see the portrayal of the Soviets and the Americans and British and that's nice and so forth but with subs this shit is impossible to figure out for me. I just want to know what non-aryans think about it.</br></br></br>  <br> actually realistically expected result <br> plot armor <br>Choose one. It would be plot armor if you were depicting a character standing in the open in front of multiple automatic weapons at 10 meters and somehow not being mowed down (every Rambo movie, I'm looking in your general direction). But if you're depicting WW2 tanks firing on the move, they actually hitting anything would be... unexpecetd. Kindly notice not only , but even the very thread caped in the post you quote actually comments on that.<br><br><br> speed <br>To make it a bit more specific: the tanks are SAID to be moving at their real historical speed (example, episode 8, they're said to be going 20 Km/h), yet they are DEPICTED as if they were moving at roughly twice as fast for aestetics purposes. They don't give some tanks "boots of seven leagues" and not to others.<br><br><br>also<br><br>Of course the depiction of German-themed school is stereotipical as fuck. That's the series' whole point.

She's a pet.</br></br>  <br> WORST x Accelerator <br>Muh dick.</br></br>  <br>I actually hate her.</br>  <br>why?</br>  <br><br>Worst girl please go and stay go</br></br>  <br> How he managed to make ichiruki <br><br>Their relationship is no different from regular bros in shounen. That's why. Rukia just has a vagina, but she acts like a typical second male main character to Ichigo (as foil).</br></br></br>  <br>Too bad  she died. ;_; </br>  saibah  <br>This. I don't know why people make such a big deal out of the Ichi/Ruki relationship, at this point it's not much different than Ichigo's bromance with Chad, but with more bickering.</br>    <br>One of the most messed up endings I've ever witness for this genre.</br>    <br>Last Order please get off of /a/.</br>  <br>Sounds like your average person in the average country.</br>  <br>And that's ok. You.her and I know that he's a chick magnet and if you don't keep tabs on him he starts putting new girls in the harem. <br><br>No problem in taking care of what's hers</br></br></br>  So comfy.  Best  <br>Mikoto is just a cockblocker that ruins close moments Touma is enjoying with other girls.</br>  <br>Shh it's okay. Have one of these. It will make you feel better.</br>  <br>Sae and Hiro-san.</br>  <br>Give the pretty bishounen a vag and suddenly it's a refreshing relationship!</br>    <br>He better treat my waifu well.</br>  <br> healthy relationship <br>Any anime couple that doesn't end in perpetual harem shit.</br></br>  Not from an official series, but still a great couple.  <br>Yeah, I liked these too. That artists is great, I'd fapped to some of his stuff before but never really payed any notice to who it was until I started reading Kyokou Suiri and thought it looked familiar. <br><br>I hope the bunny girl ones get translated soon.</br></br></br>  (it could happen)  <br>I've always wanted this, since as long as I can remember. I think I shipped them before I even watched Black Lagoon.</br>  <br> like one doujin where they fuck where they actually look on model <br> the art isn't very good and it's not translated <br><br>They'd be pretty cute together. The size difference especially.<br> Though I wouldn't mind keeping her for myself. </br></br></br></br></br>  The only ones in a series overflowing with relationships    <br><br>By far the best girl in black lagoon</br></br>  <br> couple </br>  <br> Orihime is basically Kubos ideal waifu <br><br>and Ishida is Kubos self-insert<br><br> personal wish fulfilment <br><br>yeah, that is what'll happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>this is not the way you look at your bro m8.</br></br>  <br>Isaac and Miria from Baccano!<br>Edward and Winry from FMA<br><br>Weird coincidence that Winry and Miria share the same VA in the English dubs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes a lot</br>  <br>First shounen? Homolust between the male characters isn't unusual. That's a selling point.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>That's not a side couple.<br><br>Friendly reminder that IchiRuka fags are the NaruSaku fags of Bleach.</br></br></br>    Best  <br><br>so you mean they are like gay but with hetero?</br></br>  <br><br> Check out Kyokou Suiri <br> 2 chapters in and the main girl has already been deflowered by the main guy <br><br>Now this is something I can get behind.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the healthiest</br>  <br>Nothing about their relationship is how you treat your bro.</br>        <br> relationship  <br> alien that can't even keep his head for more than a day <br> healthy <br>Talk about delusional.</br></br></br></br>  <br> any relationship in madoka <br> healthy  <br>The whole central point of the series might as well be how relationships cause everything bad that happens ever, especially with Rebellion in the mix. Shitty, shitty example. Just terrible. Here's one that's actually good.</br></br></br>  <br>Had the plot not forced them apart they would have been the healthiest relationship in the show. Anno and Shinji agreed, don't bother them about it.</br>  This is a pretty healthy relationship.  I'm a saberfag.   <br><br>Its nice to have a male protagonist that isn't a asshole, perverted dumbass or harem punching bag.</br></br>  <br>Nothing weird about looking kinda longingly at your bro</br>  <br>She was tough enough to rip a dude's eyes out of his sockets. She's got backbone. She's just been in love with him since they were about six or seven.<br><br>It's a way better relationship dynamic than Sasuke "I need to get some ninja cigarettes. See you in 12 years" Uchiha and Sakura "I'll punch down a house if I get upset" Haruno</br></br></br>  <br>Kyouko is quite literally the one who gave Sayaka salvation by shower her that there was someone who truly cared about her. One thing Sayaka really wanted to was to loved and acknowledged for her attempts to fight for justice, you can see this in the "Love Me Do" heart. And that's exactly what Kyouko does. Show her love, and acceptance. Sayaka may have died with regrets in the series, but when she went to the LoC and saw the past timelines and what Kyouko did for her she became truly happy.<br><br>And how their realtionship helped Kyouko is rather obvious. Before she meet Sayaka she was jaded and hated the world, out to spite everyone. Sayaka reminder her that are actually good people still in the world.</br></br></br>  <br>Agreed.</br>  Apples are healthy. Therefore any relationship based around apples is healthy.  <br>Who knew that we were to take all those sequences literally.</br>  <br>God damn that entire anime was a trip.<br> SIT DOWN. </br></br>  <br>How good is Spice and Wolf? I remember when it was airing and /a/ was gushing over economics and alcohol.<br><br>Also these two were always a good team.<br>Shame there's no PVP in the original IMOQ games for some delicious combos ala G.U.</br></br></br></br>  The healthiest  <br>Pretty good. Read the LNs</br>  <br>Not actually a couple, but they really fit the bill.</br>  probably not healthy but here you have to argue about ying and yang and philosophy (ore you can just rage over homu)  <br>Reminder that she got raped by a giant wolf.</br>  <br>Welcome to the N.H.K.</br>  <br> healthy </br>  <br>Where is this meme from anyway?</br>  <br>neither of them are dead, anon<br>that's a healthier relationship than it could be</br></br>  <br>They're pretty much a couple in the novels now.</br>  Quite literally made for each other  The healthiest and the purest.  <br>I know, it's just that I don't want to risk eririfags barging in and being so fucking angry like usual.</br>  <br>When Araragi said he love Hanekawa to snail in Nise even as a joke it made me uncomfortable  of course saying he'd marry snail was fine to me though </br>     Implying any couple can healthy without a healthy sex life. <br><br>By that logic, hentai-canon couples are inherently the healthiest couples.</br></br>  <br> healthy sex life <br>Check</br></br>  <br>This entire family.</br>  <br>Do 3somes count as a healthy sex life?</br>  Can't get a healthier relationship than this.    <br>Dumb shits think that Lawrence got cucked by the young wolf deity in episode 13 of season 1. Lawrence implied that but Holo interrupted him. Apparently she actually just got on her knees and begged the wolf pack to let them go, which was very difficult to do since she has a lot of pride as Holo, the wise wolf of Yoitsu.</br>  <br> relationship without kissing <br> healthy <br><br>Yeah fuck that ending and fuck you for reminding me about it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>All the fanart that depicted this was pretty gud.</br></br>  <br> Soon </br>  Not Asuna and Kirito obviously..    <br> ocha <br> es to es to madobe to etc. <br> kyokou suiri <br><br>mindblown.jpeg</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>"Tell me what is true love cause I got to know if this is real.<br>So glad that I've found you baby. I'm glad You've met me.<br>...<br>Say You'll share with me one love"<br>Man! Thoses scenes with Masquerade. Zero Requiem Special was fucking touching. I cried like a little girl.<br>Not my OTP in Geass but I accept them as an official couple thanks to that silly cupid's day.<br>Although I think it was better she died. The girl would have gone crazy to see him die.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The healthiest of relationships  <br>So healthy that they even share a man &amp; everything's alright.</br>    It's a good thing Mikiya kicked his addiction to SUPER MARIJUANA, otherwise drugs could've ruined yet another promising relationship.   SOON   <br>But when will she bite him?</br>  Surprisingly so    <br> They move towards each other enticingly <br> Heads pass each other <br> They fucking hug <br><br>WHERE WAS MY GODDAMN KISS</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Again,  Soon </br>  <br>They probably wanted to go someplace where a dismembered dude wasn't lying on the ground first.</br>  Starts off rough but gets much nicer as time goes on.  <br>This guy knows what's up.</br>    <br><br>Who homo here?</br></br>  NOT pic related  the healthiest        <br><br>He does love Hanekawa though, that wasn't a joke.<br><br>They should have put the scene from Nise where he said she is a second mother to him.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Whoever said it wasn't genuine? They both still have issues which could have impacted the relationship if they didn't have good friends. Koi pretty much proved that.</br></br>  <br>new chapter soon friend</br>  <br>Nothing that alien science can't fix. Give it time.</br>    Almost no decent art of these two. Fucking japan.  Shin and Kyoukai are pretty adorable together.  am I doing it rite?  <br>I'm still mad.</br>  <br>This scene was way too brief. I would have liked at least one more page or her reacting to the whole situation. That said, it was nice to see her treated like a princess for once in her life. Always remember to keep a protective eye on your waifu when out in public.</br>  <br> Which anime couples are examples of a healthy relationship? <br>Technically speaking, they're twice as healthy as regular couples.</br></br>   all this yurishit <br><br>Disgusting.</br></br>          <br> she fucks off at the end for dramu~ <br>Totally healthy.</br></br>  <br>anime adaption when?</br>  <br>Gay couples are better.</br>  <br> Gay couples are better. <br>Only trap x male is healthier than yuri.</br></br>  <br>Traps are shit, if you want a dude you get a dude.</br>  <br>Your taste is shit.</br>  <br> Bring up a valid point <br> Y-you're shit <br>Nice meme</br></br></br>  <br><br>I want trap x reverse trap<br><br>all other pairing archetypes are shit in comparison</br></br></br></br>  <br>This was so heavily implied on Japland internet that when he published the side stories he went back and explicitly said there was no wolf sex. She just had to bow down and humble herself before him.</br>  <br>gtfo</br>    healthy relationship here  <br>Came here to post this.</br>  <br>Isn't Beato  his third removed cousin? </br>  <br>Physically and emotionally abusive. Chiaki literally can't be nice to Nodame until she starts to treat him as shittily as he treats her.</br>  <br><br> third cousin <br><br>u wot m8<br><br>that's probably less related than most people</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Right there in the feels. I cried like a little bitch at their reunion.</br>  <br>But still, it's kinda weird to be in a relationship with  your grandfather's lovechild. </br>  <br>RUNNING THE WORLD</br>    <br> tormaid <br>RIP Faggot.</br></br>    All those years of suffering finally payed off for him.  <br> Great Chemistry <br> Natural around each other <br> Could easily make the transition into husband x wife territory with no problem <br>Best coupling anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not to mention all of the great fanart of the two of them.</br>  They lived happily ever after.<br><br>That is how it fucking ended.<br><br>Healthiest, happiest relationship.</br></br></br></br>    <br>my nigga</br>  <br>The other options doesn't even have half the magic.</br>  <br>It's not healthy until there's a season three.<br><br>Where is it.</br></br></br>  They didn't start out that way but by the end, they were OTP.  <br>I'm sorry anon, the anime was only created to promote the books</br>  My waifu x me is the healthiest relationship.  <br>ur waifu  ___________________________________<wbr>___________________________________<wbr>_____________A SHIT____________________</wbr></wbr> </br>     not posting obvious answer <br>come on guys</br>  <br>THAT IS HOW IT FUCKING ENDED</br>  WOOOOOOOH<br>WOOOOOOOH<br>TADADADDADA<br>OMAETOOOOOO<br><br>Why does /a/ so quickly forget the best couple</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> abuse <br> healthy <br><br>I did like the doujin where the Dark Flame Dick awakened and fucked them both into submission</br></br></br></br>  Drawfag Thread 1535<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1529:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1534: </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  /r/ing Aika in a full body shot with her eye-to-eye length duct tape over her mouth, please.

Not at all! Save the $20, or go to a medium tablet.</br></br>  <br><br><br>that sound nice, I take it</br></br></br>  <br>And a drawing of her masturbating intensely because she's alone and desperate.</br>   commission artist 4 months ago <br> does requests in the threads <br> still no wip </br></br>  <br>That dude is stalling.<br>Say something.</br></br>  <br>Im pretty defeatest about it now. Not even worth the effort. He would rather circlejerk</br>  <br>If you already paid for it, you deserve to either have your money back, or tell him that he needs to hurry up.<br><br>If you only suggested the idea of what you want, and haven't actually paid him, then yeah, you might as well go commission someone else.</br></br></br>  <br>about what was your comission?</br>  <br>I paid him but it really isnt worth the headache. If the peanuts are worth that much to him so be it</br>  <br>No, no, go fucking say something.<br>You gave him your money to draw something for you. If that person has not drawn somethign for you, he's broken an agreement that you had with him.<br><br>At the very least, go ahead and ask him, "Is there a WIP at all?"<br>If he says no, you can ask for your money back.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck yeah, anon! <br>Fuck yeah... <br>https://<span>youtu.be/0p_1QSUsbsM  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>I tried to be as rough as possible.</br>  <br>You're too nice, mr boa</br>  <br> commission an artist <br> he stalls a lot, people who talk to him mention him feeling down <br> discounts me half the price because he feels bad about being slow <br> still slow, occasionally shows up in drawthreads here and there doing the odd request <br> long gaps between hearing from him, send him an e-mail every other week or so to see if he's done any progress <br> only responds sometimes <br> eventually stops responding entirely <br> nobody else has heard of him <br> it's been over a year now since I first made the commission <br>F-fuck...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The suggestion makes it sexier.</br>  <br>And that's why I'm afraid to commission anybody.</br>  <br><br>Publicly shame them, they deserve it for being shitty with no commitment.</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure the first one is dead</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>It isnt worth it to me. Chances are if he does have a wip they will just finish it with a half hearted attempt</br>  <br>I've commissioned plenty of people before, it practically always goes well, I may not be 100% happy with the end result sometimes, but I try to be grateful anyways, most artists are willing to work things out and do edits/changes as we go along, and I'm always willing to pay half up front, it tends to work 9 times out of 10.<br><br>At this point, I don't even care about the picture, it was just 35 dollars, I hope the nigga ain't dead, I'd feel really bad about it because he seemed like such a nice guy.</br></br></br>  <br>I-I can't do that, I'd feel terrible about it!<br><br><br>NO! Don't say that ;____;</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yess thanks boa, the suggestiveness I think is really nice. Cheers!</br>  <br>rather not run the risk of a huge mess especially given how the threads have been lately. it will only ever backfire</br>  <br>Did you pay them already?<br><br><br>Fuck the police.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think it's something worth mentioning in these threads.</br></br>  <br>id rather not run the risk of having my waifu shitposted into the ground by artists and requesters alike. with the way these threads are some entitlement card will be pulled out or something or I will be put on some blacklist</br>   Weekend soon <br>Is your request ready?</br>  <br>I paid him half upfront, but after a long while of not hearing from him, he said that he felt bad that he was taking so long and that I didn't have to pay the rest. I don't remember exactly, but he even mentioned the possibility of a freebie I think, like at some later date.<br><br>We kept going some back and forth, he kept showing progress, we talked some back and forth, all that.<br><br>But now I haven't heard from him in several months, he's not responded to any of my mails in that time and nobody else has heard from him. I'm legit fearing that he's killed himself and I sort of feel really guilty about it for some reason.<br><br>Do I want to hear from him again and see my commission finished? Yes, of course, but if he just responds with "I'm sorry, I can't do it, I've got too much shit going on my life right now, I'm sorry I've let you down" I'll take that and be happy because I liked him and don't want him to die.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tons and tons of requests stockpiled <br> not requesting this weekend </br></br>  <br>you paid this guy money. If anything hes gonna be the one getting shitposted</br>  More or less done with the expressions of the sprite, that was pretty fun to make. And ended up making some kind of character profile card with the background of the ps3 game.<br><br> I wanted to continue right away with Rena but I suddenly remembered I have a family "reunion" today far from my house and computer that will last until next wednesday, fuck me </br></br>  <br>maybe he got frustrated with art and quit completely</br>  <br>where is full version?<br><br><br>boa pls</br></br></br></br>  Can I commission 34?  <br>I wish I could believe that. there are far too many excuses used in these threads that favor everybody being totally innocent</br>  <br>Nice work.</br>  <br>Gotdamn, I wanna slap you.<br>Stop being a nigga and pm the dude.</br></br>  <br>http://3fourdraws.tumblr.com/post/9<wbr>1824663106/commission<br><br>She's asian and draws 30 hours a day, guaranteed fast delivery</br></br></wbr></br>  <br> tfw can't decide whether you're going to pick a request from your normal request list or from your list of loli waifu request </br>  <br> She </br>  <br>Looks cool.</br>  <br> he still doesn't know 34 is grill </br>  <br> he </br>  Requesting sad Cecilia with no drills  <br> $30 for a full bodied watercolor <br>This motherfucker...<br>I'm commissioning 34 for sure.</br></br></br>  <br> 9 times out of ten <br>whats the story for that 1 out of ten?</br></br>  <br> 150$ dollars for a drawing <br>Goddamn it's expensive but seeing my waifu like that.I'm conflicted.</br></br>  <br>You sounds like a nice person. I think if you told the guy exactly what you posted he would be more than happy to try and wrap things up for you. <br><br>I took commissions for a while and tried really hard to just keep in contact with people but after picking up a job 6 days a week I couldn't get anything done in less than a month and I felt really guilty about everything. Stopped taking them and just dropped off the map after finishing up things. I might just do like dollar commissions for fun but it got mentally stressful<br><br>I think both parties get way too guilty for no reason way too easily</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It would actually be $262.50 if you wanted it to be a full body pic.</br>  Requesting Kotomine Kirei in this pose, text optional  <br><br>I've got  $125 in Amazon.ca giftcards  so the medium is quite a bit out of my budget.

Fuck jew.</br>  Should one learn to draw 3dpd before drawing waifus?  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Eh, I paid $350 for my favorite artist. He's pretty famous so it was worth it getting waifu in his gallery, although he did it with traditional media which I found somewhat less exciting than his digital works.<br><br>Well, my point is that $150 is reasonable.<br><br><br>Full body is overrated unless you're a footfag. All you do is complicate the composition for the sake of some shins.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no but it definitely helps.</br>  <br>... hes just posted it?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> tfw that's 1/10 of my monthly wage <br> tfw I would still pay for that <br>And I'm a fucking stingy man.</br></br></br>  I want a picture of Cobra (from Space Adventure Cobra) and Dandy (from Space Dandy) hanging out together. What is the progress on this?  <br>Well her highest tier picture looks fucking stunning. I could see a company commissioning her for promo art. So the price might not be too bad.</br>  <br>But I want to see my waifu's cute feet and shins.</br>  I'd like Ravel or Koneko from DxD<br>As lewd as possible</br>  <br>i've head good things about huion but I have never used them personally, maybe someone here has.</br>  Requesting Satou Shouji and Aoki Daigo from Shokugeki no Soma engaged in yankee behavior. Anything from fighting over mirror space fixing their hair in the morning, to squatting in front of a Williams-Sonoma giving people the stink eye would be fine.  Requesting these two fucking like http://imgur.com/a/YWsZE or http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=31057 or or something competitive like mud wrestling; alternatively this with any of the other goddesses and their counterparts (ie Vert, Blanc)</wbr>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Yes. Its part of the basics.</br>  A drawing of this please  <br>No, that takes too long<br>Anime drawing is easier than 3dpd.</br></br>  <br>Yes, and don't listen to any schmuck that says you can learn both at the same time.<br>It will only pollute your fundamentals with stylistics.<br>As  is demonstrating, it's just a shortcut.</br></br></br>  This one is for drawfags. Where does one start learning how to draw ? My skills are pratictally 0 where I can't even draw a stick man properly. Which sources should I look for and what absolute necessarities should I learn first?  <br>Nah man, that just proves you're a lazy faggot.<br>Trust me, I studied anime drawing more and because of that stupid fucking choice I fucking suck at drawing especially proportions. <br>Don't be like me, start from the basics.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck that, i'm not commissioning.</br>  <br>R<br>e<br>a<br>d<br><br>L<br>o<br>o<br>m<br>i<br>s</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>never underestimate mechanical practice, circles straight lines, ellipses, gradients, etc.</br>  <br>But that's only for the highest tier option. I'd pay the $80 for the clean color soft shaded full body one. That's comparable to other artists.</br>  <br>If you learn to draw from anime you will only learn that particular style, not the mechanics that it's built on. <br><br>Everything in anime is stylized which means a lot of detail was removed. knowing what detail to remove when comes from drawing 3d stuff. <br><br>Like for instance the nose is usually just one line. But knowing what that line represents is only possible if you know the human body and thats the only way you'll be able to place it properly from every angle.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Considering it takes about a day to do something like that 150 isn't really much.</br>  Am I the only cheap bastard here that wouldn't pay more than $35 for a commission? I mean I paid more for my fig from bupi but also I got a physical product in return so that was a little different in my mind. I understand the artist's time is valuable and all, but $80 - $250 for a single picture is way too much, especially when they only sell you personal use of the picture.    <br>Awesome</br>    <br>If you consider the time it takes and apply a reasonable hourly wage to it, it doesn't sound unreasonable to ask for 80+ dollars. <br><br>I feel you, in pretty stingy with money to</br></br></br>  <br>COOL<br>O<br>O<br>L</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>sweet</br></br>  <br> I understand the artist's time is valuable <br><br>Well then do the math<br><br>More often than not you're paying them barely above American minimum wage, unless they're very well known.<br><br>One of 34's highly rendered $150 whatevers is like $12-15 an hour</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not OR, amazing. Can we just call you Untitledfag?<br> Once again, thank you for drawing my request. </br></br>  <br> If you consider the time it takes and apply a reasonable hourly wage to it, it doesn't sound unreasonable to ask for 80+ dollars.  <br><br>Yeah I understand that much, but as a utilitarian I would only justify buying someone's time like that if they were producing something I really needed or could use in some way. Hell if I could get something physical out of it like a quality printed picture in a decent frame I might pay $80 but I start to panic when I imagine forking that much cash out just to save a megabytes-large PNG that I can look at every now and then on my computer.</br></br></br>  <br>awwww shit yeahhhhh</br>  <br>Dayum, great render anon.</br>  <br>Fuck.

Learning anime first isn't necessarily bad but it won't do you any good if you were looking to extensively learn anatomy.<br><br>The fact of the matter is you should learn what you want to know, it doesn't matter how. People telling you "3DPD first, anime second" is merely a standardized flowchart for pretty much everyone so we don't have to deal with idiots who gets stuck somewhere and we have to pick up their slack with "yeah that arm is wrong."<br><br>Some people start drawing anime first and then move on to real life studies, and they turn out just fine, others start off abstract and move more to realism, that's fine too. As long as you're not sitting there doing the same exact shit practically every day and wondering why nothing is changing then you'll be fine.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even if you fix the eye there's a world of difference between that and an artist who know what he's doing. Any asshole can draw like a minimum-wage Korean.</br>  <br>No the point is you literally can't draw proper 2D without knowing 3D. You can copy it and learn it and then that particular pose and perspective you can use over and over again but you wouldn't understand how it works. 2D works by abstracting 3D. If you don't know how 3D works and start copying 2D of other people you will basically learn nothing but how to draw that exact thing you are copying.</br>  When does the WDD start again?  <br>friday 12:00am 4chan time (est)</br>  <br>6 hours and 50 minutes from now.</br>  <br><br>Ah, thank you very much anons.</br></br>  <br>EST here, it's usually 7:00AM, but who knows, I don't start these.</br>  <br>Blame tharja-fag</br>  <br>When people pay me $35 for a commission, I make about $7 an hour</br>  <br>Not yet, but almost.</br>  <br>weekly drama drawthread?</br>  <br>O-Oops, my bad.

How would they know if they're going the right way?<br>Or is it best to get that elsewhere like /ic/ or a different site/community altogether?</br></br>  <br>Personally, I'd recommend getting into the habit of drawing even if it means doodling dicks on a notebook every day.<br><br>Before hopping into Loomis, Hampton, Vilppu, or whatever, you probably want to understand simpler stuff, like visualizing 3D volumes and drawing analytically. I know there are some books for that out there, but I'd recommend Draw Box.</br></br></br>  Requesting Issei from High School DxD with his full Balance Breaker ( Ddraig and Albion arms) doing Hell And Heaven move from GaoGaiGar<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EnV<wbr>lcBXpTtc</wbr>  [ ]</br>  I'm finally ready.  <br>i dunno, my stuff is middle of the road but i know that well, i still like to chill in these threads and deliver from time to time, i know what my deficiencies are and i'm working on getting better but it's a slow process.</br>  <br>This place is more for incentive than critique.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Thank you. I have another question. Aren't these books for people who want to improve their techique rather than using it as your first source to learn how to draw? I'm feeling like they are a little advanced for me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, they're mostly for improving specific skill sets like figure drawing and such. I think Draw Box would be your best bet (it's just a website) for learning he basics. Plus if you do the homework assignments the webmaster will critique your work. Loomis (Fun With a Pencil) would probably be better for refining those fundamentals.</br>  <br> Is she your waifu? </br>  <br>Absolutely not, I just felt like requesting art of her.</br>  Requesting  <br>disgusting, take that shit to /d/</br>  <br>fucking hell man double spoiler that shit</br>  <br>What has sciene done?!</br>  <br> waifus in labcoats and writing on clipboards while other waifus hold hands with their husbandos <br> Occasional "hmm"s and "yes"s <br><br>I want to see this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Waifu and anon hooked up to computers and shit and other waifus/anons observing and writing notes with erections?

The setting seems interesting enough to follow the 3 episode rule.<br>Also is it going to be 12 or 13 episodes?</br>  <br>I haven't dropped it yet, but it suffered from a pretty bad first episode. I don't know or care who any of the characters are, the guy they rescued even pointed out how wasteful it was to rescue him, the setting isn't very interesting yet (uh, people have terraformed city's loyal to countries on earth, that's it lol).<br><br>I'm going to stick with it for two more episodes, but I don't have high hopes for it to improve.<br><br>The only show I've actually dropped so far was the one about the guy who could take over people's bodies for a few seconds. Dropped it in a few minutes of the first episode because it was so God Damn awful.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> if a character doesn't slam her emotions in your face she is bland </br>  <br>Well shit. Maybe they'll warm up to it.</br>  <br> implying the other girl (MC imouto) is not bland too <br>All the characters are bland so far</br></br>  <br>At least his getting more work in the industry, but I don't know if it'll help or hurt his reputation in the long run.<br><br>One thing I can say is that Maruto needs to work on creating an more impressionable introduction to his works. The problem is that most of his stuff seems bland and generic at the start and only shows it's quality as the story progresses. It's especially an issue in anime where people make judgements much earlier.</br></br></br>  How many of you plebs are waiting for the best girl? the one who stay on top and even the author of shieldbro says she's the best. <br><br> Mature <br> Bondage <br> Legs, tons of legs <br> Boobs <br> Pseudo-ass </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Cerea is best girl  <br> HORSEFUCKER.</br>  caaaan somebody give me the pussy please  <br>That isn't Cerea, sorry to break it to you.</br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Still is best girl</br>  <br>Should start next one with the Suu "not done till I say so" pic.</br>  <br>hahaha, nice meme.<br><br>I swear the anime has attracted the worst kind of people to this series.</br></br></br>  <br>Newfags?</br>  <br><br><br>All these horse bully's get pretty annoying.</br></br></br>   Reminder Ms. Smith is Best Girl.

In all seriousness, why can't we just agree that all girls are amazing. All of them have their specialties, and their disadvantages. No one girl can be best. Learn to appreciate all girls as best.   Papi can meet her dad anytime she wants as he is still with her mom <br> Cerea most likely could easily find her dad and would most likely be happy to see her <br> Miia will never meet her dad as her mom is a slut and he most likely hates Lamias <br><br>Isn't it sad?</br></br></br></br>   Yu doing an EXTREMELY calm and cool voice <br><br>Holy fuck what? I know she can do that but it's on a different level here.</br></br>  <br>Err, I like it and all, but how you guys don't get tired of have a 24/7 thread?</br>  <br>Protomen<br>The Good Doctor<br><br>www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vgGYwXYt3J0<wbr></wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>She can just call Darling dad during sex</br>  Do nut forget  <br>Yes</br>   #<br>He already amounted to something, anon; he's the hero that Monster Musume deserves, but not the one who's the main character right now... So we'll bully him because he can take it... He's not our protagonist... He's a nervous guardian... A wheeled protector... A bike cop.</br>  <br> All of them have their specialties <br> Papi a useless </br></br>  <br>Best girl<br><br>And she doesn't have a brain scouring voice like Miia</br></br></br>  <br>Because as logical as it may sound, nobody likes the harem ending. It can only be one girl and no one else. Then again, it's less about whether or not the girl is best and more about your opinions on the matter and how they're superior to others.<br><br>At least that's my understanding. I've been known to be completely off base on a few things.</br></br></br>  <br>someone sacked it</br>  <br> Am I the only one who's hyped to finally here Zombina's full voice in the anime? <br> No. </br></br>  <br><br>You're assuming that all Monmusu species have the same psychological need for a father that humans do.</br></br>  <br>LMFAO, the horse fucker is rigging the votes</br>  <br>Yep. Another carpet bombing is in effect.</br>  <br>She's a natural born leader.</br>  MIIA BEST GIRL  <br> there will never be a dark knight spoof with bike cop </br>  <br>At first I thought this was supposed to be joke lyrics to the OP and tried to fit them. When are we going to get the lyrics translated?</br>  <br> Anal </br>  <br>I find it hilarious that Tio and Polt have yet to get a single vote.</br>  <br>Monstergirl wedding dresses gotta be a bitch to design.</br>  <br>Based on Miia's personality you can tell she would like one.<br><br>She wants Darling for herself and not share him with the snake pit.</br></br></br>  So we all agree that Centorea is literally /mlp/ tier trashgirl, right?  <br>I am so ready!</br>  <br> Horse fuckers are THIS insecure </br>  <br>No she is S+ teir. All girls S+ teir.</br>  <br>no , fucking retard you are as bad as the assholes that kept saying horo was furry.</br>  <br>How many weeks more till we get best girl?</br>  Can spiderlady ward off other spiders from entering darling's home? I dislike spiders (a lot) but like her. How would she feel if someone killed a spider in front of her?  <br>FUCK YEAH!</br>  <br> best girl <br> can fly, can carry you, can give you eggs <br> useless <br>I'm afraid sr. That your opinion is utterly shit</br></br></br></br>  What kind of monster girl would you like to see added to the harem?<br><br>On top of that, what would her personality be?</br></br>  <br>The only thing I agree to is that it's impossible to like her without being associated with that inhuman subset that had to be exiled to their own board.</br>  <br>Probably as bad as Mero would feel about eating fish<br><br>Or Papi about eating chicken<br><br> Not at all </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>7 if they keep doing 2 chapters per episode.</br>  SPOT THE PILLOW SEIYUU  <br>I find it hilarious how Cerea tries to act all chivalry with her boring shit even though her whole race including her mother have a cucking tradition. That's pretty much why she's one of the worst girls along with Miia for being a jealousy gag.</br>  <br>Eyes went straight to Yuu.<br><br>She really is a force of nature.</br></br></br>  <br>Cow<br><br>With the existing Cow's personality<br><br>Just not as stupid</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy crap, is that actually a thing in the manga? /a/, would you eat a delicious Papi-laid omelette?</br>  <br>Quite a few.</br>  <br>She'll eat you once you're done mating</br>  <br>Only one choice here, any other answer is objectively wrong.</br>  <br>Alraune seems nice. Though the tree lady counts as that doesn't she? <br><br>Moth girl? <br> Non-yandere version please </br></br></br></br>  <br>has this series ever had a Character Poll?</br>  <br>And I find it hilarious that the horse fucker has to rigg the votes because otherwise Cerea would be the same as Tio and Polt. 600 votes and counting LOL</br>   anime finally depicting gyaru as the disgusting as fuck girls they actually are <br><br>Based</br></br>  <br>What else do you expect from /mlp/?</br>  <br> is that actually a thing in the manga? <br>yeah<br>the egg laying scene was pretty lewd<br>I heard the author had to tone it down when thinking about the possible adaptation.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bee/Wasp/Octopus/Flower<br><br>Fuck knows about personalities though</br></br></br>  <br>It had two. <br><br>Cerea won the first, Rachnera the second.</br></br></br>  <br>A few. Miia and Rachnee constantly swap for the number one spot. Strangely enough, though, a recent poll had Manako as the most popular MON member.</br>  <br>I can't wait till Kii lactation<br><br>How are they going to do that?</br></br></br>  <br>6 more after episode 2!</br>  <br>She has got the most developed character out of all of them?</br>  Episode 2 when?  <br>Okayado has been going through this list so far of girls.</br>  <br>Ushi Oni</br>  <br> Miia and Rachnee constantly swap for the number one spot <br>When did that happen?</br></br>  Why are people so jealous of the horse girl?  <br>Anime's been making fun of ganguro for years. They're basically the "dumb blondes" of Japan.</br>  <br>we salute you crabman</br>  <br>I know this is the work of one angry dude with a bot, but I like to think that if I were to go to /mlp/ right now, I'd see a thread linking to this poll with a plea to spam it for the good name of horsekind.</br>  <br>Because she is pretty popular and probably one of the most attractive ones. But that's my guess</br>  <br>Given how Seikon no Qwaser went, probably just do it straight up with some nipple fog.</br>  <br>What? No. They make them seem ditzy/slutty, but generally sexy/sexual. The girl from this episode was ugly as FUCK.</br>  <br>Still can't handle the stress though.</br>  <br>  Anyone Jealous of Horse pussy <br><br>Yeah I like good hygiene not filthy shit.</br></br></br>  <br>But the manga did exactly the opposite anon kun</br>  <br>I'd like to see Tomo as a cowgirl<br><br>It would fit extremely well</br></br></br>  <br>Don't even like horse all that much but i really don't get why people always hate on her she is pretty cute.</br>  <br>there's a part where the FOG gets clear and with contrast abuse you see Miia Titty in the fog</br>  <br>Hornet.<br> queen hornet and her worker slaves tries to take over the world and rid it of all other monster girls <br> only mon can stop them  <br> darling gets kidnapped like the dopey fuck he is, has to defeat hornet army with his harem <br>Series needs an antagonist, it's becoming stagnant and cliched.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, I forgot you can't reply to your own posts.</br>  <br>You must have trouble looking in the mirror then.</br>    <br>Who da fuck voted John the Baptist?</br>   airing the same season as jitsu wa watashi <br><br>How unfortunate are they?

I'd make one, but I'm on a phone</br>  <br>What are you even talking about most of these girls are horribly one dimensional. For the most part only Cerea, Mia and Rachnee have actual characters to them besides just boobs. I mean Cerea's character is that she wants to come off as a strong person but is deep down inside pretty shy and goofy also she is pretty clumsy. What you are saying is completely false and just incorrect.</br>  <br>Nice dodge. Though you don't deserve those quads. Besides, I only have eyes...well, eye, for one girl, and it ain't Cerea.</br>  <br>Will this get animated?</br>  <br> implying Centorea would sully herself and her master's name by having such poor hygiene </br>  <br>At least Cerea has a personality, even if chivalry isn't your thing. <br><br>But Miia's pretty much just "I Want Darling's Dick: The End."</br></br></br>  <br>Oh yes the girl from episode 1 it was. I was referring to the other gyrau character that you definitely know because you had read the manga already</br>  every girl is the best girl<br>except the one you like<br>she is the worst girl</br></br>  <br>Not sure why, but half of them look to me like they're doing the thumb through fist gesture, even though I know that's just them with clenched fists and thumbs on top.</br>  <br>This guy seems to get that most of the girls are really just a pair of boobs.</br>  <br> like all girls <br> they are all worst girls </br></br>  <br>  Cerea and Miia have actual character. <br><br>Well this is a new one because they're the shittiest characters in the series that suffered from the harem curse.</br></br></br>  <br>Miia cooked and ate it because someone put it in the fridge. Indirect cunnulingus.</br>  <br>Even Papi?</br>  does anyone have a picture of what crabman actually looks like in real life?  <br>Isn't it true that at the age foals start galloping, human babies can't hold their heads up yet? What would happen? Would their heads be dangling while they run around?</br>    <br>Yes, we wouldn't want to destroy the sanctity of a fucking harem manga with waifu wars.</br>    <br>Christ I hope so. For Cereafags and Miafags.</br>  <br>thats a scorpion you dumb bastard</br>  Played through all of MGQ but never got into the monster girl theme.<br><br>Is the manga worth picking up?<br><br>First episode was alright, sad it was just one girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They showed Darling pondering lamia bathroom habits, so probably.</br>  <br>Your just the same faggot who keeps saying over and over again how shit Cerea and Mia are.

Same question goes for mermaids.  <br><br> Fantasy-Cyborgs <br><br>12 Beast already has the Fantasy equivalent of Robots.<br>A race of naturally-occurring cyborgs with primitive cybernetic implants would be kind of cool.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Miia <br> interesting personality <br> Mero <br> bottom-of-the-barrel personality-wise <br>How can someone be this wrong?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Still waiting for a fairy-girl. </br>  <br>Arachneras lay eggs but just one or few, unlike spiders that lay hundreds.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127861286 <br>My prediction is that her mom is a completely pure, non-lewd super-doting grandma type who, while disapproving of Rachnera being a "wild child", dotes on both her and Darling and sues her silk to knit sweaters for Darling. She also constantly urges Rachnera to make a move on him because he is such a "fine young man".</br>  <br><br> Papi <br> more interesting personality than Cera <br><br>Literally what.<br><br>Papi's characterization has been almost exclusively "retard with a heart of gold" up until this point.<br><br>I don't even like Cera, but come on man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   hens lay unfertilized eggs all the time, also THEY EAT THEM  <br>One does not "fuck" the centaur pussy. One makes love to it, with plenty of tender  finger-twining , along with  hand-holding , and finishing off with  arm-swinging .</br>  <br><br> But that's not what characterizes bestiality. <br>It's what characterizes it psychologically.<br><br> Either all monster girls are bestiality (because they are not fully human) or none of them are (because they are able to reproduce with humans). <br>Wrong. There are shades to this. And no, something doesn't have to be EXCLUSIVELY animal to appeal to people with a penitent for bestiality.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>anon pls<br><br><br>Still better than "generic female paladin #2947".</br></br></br></br>  <br>I am really creeped out by spiders. I prefer papi, suu, the dullahan who's name I can't remember right now, and   Ms Smith .</br>  <br> It's not gay if its a girl with a dick!!! </br>  <br>because only retards get in the box, and only a retard wouldnt have taken the rapey spider by now</br>  <br>exactly. Best girl never wins.</br>  <br>Hopefully this one looks less shit than the job I did with Tio.<br><br>Now back to trying to finish Doppel.</br></br></br>  Y'all betta be watching in glorious 1080, quality bigger than Centorea's tits  <br>It's not animated in 1080p, so who cares? Just hit full-screen, it'll look the same as an upscale.</br>  <br><br>Arachnaes lay eggs, and similar to how spiders sometimes lay eggs in the corpse of a dead insect in their web, Arachnaes lay their eggs  in the rectum and intestines of their lover with an ovipositor, complete with a nice big enema composed of fluid nutrients, and let the male carry the eggs to term until their ready to hatch in a bastardized but somehow sexy version of pregnancy .</br></br>  <br>Kaiju girls when?</br>  <br> It's what characterizes it psychologically <br>That's even more equivocated, because centaurs have human minds and you can actually connect with them in a psychological level. Sure, you're fucking a horse body at the end, but what if you're getting a tailjob from a lamia, or even a blowjob as they also have inhuman tongues? Neither of these things are bestiality per se, despite the fact you could interpret them as such.<br><br> And no, something doesn't have to be EXCLUSIVELY animal to appeal to people with a penitent for bestiality. <br>Isn't that another issue though? Lamias and other species might as well appeal to people who are into bestiality, since their inhuman features are also presented in a sexualized manner.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's the opposite of what I'm saying. I'm saying that, yes, if you want to fuck horse-pussy, you have a penitent for bestiality.</br></br>  <br>Whelp.. I am glad there is no Wasp Girl<br><br> That's a big bitch</br></br></br>  <br>well hello boner!</br>  <br>For you</br>  <br>So if you want to fuck any monster part of their bodies you have a penitent for bestiality?</br>  <br> He hasn't read Chapter 20. </br>  <br><br>When the Monster-part is identical in shape, size, texture, biology and structure to an animal, yes.</br></br>  <br>I have. I meant girls that are kaiju-sized in their natural state.</br>  <br>So a wing-job, a spinneret-job, a throat-job, also bestiality?</br>    <br><br>It could potentially be argued to be, but personally I don't consider it anywhere near on the same level.<br><br>Again, there are levels of abstraction to these things.<br>What you listed has many degrees of abstraction away from intercourse with an animal.<br>Fucking a centaur in their centaur pussy which is indistinguishable from a horse is not quite as far away.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That last one's necrophilia.</br>  <br> personally <br>Well, that explains it.</br></br>  <br> implying that fucking snake tails or spinnerets isn't bestiality because they are bigger </br>  <br> tfw you will never fuck an otachi girl </br>  <br>So classic Harpy(like the ones in that Torii-Kiss cafe manga, girl's head on bird body) would be bestiality to you?</br>  <br><br>Now try to Imagine rachnee explaining that to MC while they make sweet arachno-love.</br></br>  What times does this air?  <br>What, you never jacked-off an anaconda by the tail while exploring the Amazon?</br>  <br>Right now nigga, get hype.</br>  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/anichart/</br>  <br>It saddens me to say it, but  no. ;_; </br>  <br>That pregnant belly is a nice touch.</br>   Licensed by Sentai <br><br>Well...fuck.</br></br>  <br>I recommend fingering its cloaca, maybe even stick your sharpie in.

It's because they are these weird, scaly things that slither around and hiss at you.</br></br></br>  <br>I would still prefer Coyote Tango or Striker Eureka</br>  <br>Kaiju monstergirls when</br>  <br> It's because they are these weird, scaly things that slither around and hiss at you <br>And because they have no legs.<br><br>What kind of unholy beast has no legs?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Mero having a bigger bust than Miia <br><br>....Is this cannon?<br>I know Mero has Mermaid Blubber, but I thought Miia's were still supposed to be bigger.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dear Anon's Penis,<br><br>No.<br><br>Signed,<br>Loen<br><br>Never nipples and vagoo anon, sorry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The girls bust sizes are the most inconsistent part of the manga</br>  <br>Where is that yandere doll?</br>  <br> They are, snakes are widely considered to be repugnant creatures. <br>What a fucking retard</br></br>  <br>Do you live in India or something?</br>  <br>that's why I like Papi, you cant fuck up A cups too badly.<br><br>then again Smith and Spider are fighting for best girl in my mind.</br></br></br>  <br>Cerea seems like the safest to submit to in this case. At worst she pins you against the wall until she's satisfied, or she orgasms and falls asleep on top of you.</br>  <br><br>I can compromise for 1/4 of a nipple.</br></br>  <br><br> snakes are widely considered to be repugnant creatures <br><br>Even ancient cultures were man enough about snakes to deify them.<br>They had more reason to fear snakes in their primitive culture than we do today.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i.imgur.com/4fNb5lU.jpg<br>She's still a sketch. I will have time for her after Miia and Rach.<br> Dont worry fellow dollfag, I will get her done, I promise. </br></br></br>  <br><br> Never nipples and vagoo <br><br>Any particular reason for this?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I like you guys.</br></br></br>  <br>Just not my thing.

All she'd have to do is step on you to injure you, let alone fall on you.<br><br>Also, I'd legitimately take Lamia-constriction over a Centaur kick any day.<br>For one thing,  I have a Constriction-fetish .<br>But more importantly, for a second thing, a horse-kick is a tremendous amount of force exerted quickly over the very tiny surface-area of a horse-hoof. These have been strong enough to instantly kill people who got a horse-kick to the chest due to it severing an aorta. While Lamia-constriction involves more muscle-mass applying pressure, it seems like it would be applied over a larger surface-area and applied slower. At least slowly enough for you to at least beg for mercy before she accidentally kills you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If she fell asleep on top of you then you would be dead</br>  <br><br>...I need to make a Screamer-gif out of this...</br></br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/556505/ecf0b5<wbr>006d/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/686653/a742e5<wbr>90d8/</wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br><br>I was thinking it was a statute to keep your portfolio clean for submission for review or something.<br><br>I'm thinking all the curvy Monmusu-women would be enough to piss your girl off anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Works for me.</br>  <br>Based /a/non, thank you.</br>  <br><br> Just not my thing. I preffer ecchi that way. <br><br> Me too. :) </br></br></br></br>   MC gets horse-kicked in the head several times <br> doesn't die of internal injuries <br><br>Now I see why LaLa likes him so much.</br></br></br>  Miia's reaction faces are so adorable.  <br>I was thinking more in the context of full moon snusnu. Papi could rake you or take off with you in her claws then drop you halfway. We've seen what Miia's coils do to parallel bars. The worst Cerea could do during sex is what I mentioned above. And it's easier to get a padded room than a full padded suit that can accommodate sex. At worst, wear steel-toed boots in case of accidental stamping.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Hey Loen, while I know you're in this thread, I wanted to give you a heads-up.<br><br>I'm the guy that's been doing requests for graphics and vectors in these threads.<br>I'd like to make any for you if you have a request or suggestion.<br><br>Basically I feel like I owe you something for the fantastic art you entertain me with. I can't do much, but I can offer.<br>Not that I doubt you couldn't make whatever you come up with yourself, but I'm guessing you're more of an illustrator than a vector-graphics guy, so I thought I'd go ahead and put the offer out there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> No. <br><br>So it's war then.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Usually it's Papi making the "&gt;_&lt;"-faces in this series.</br></br>  <br>Pic related.<br><br>She doesnt approve but she knows its my hobby. So in return for her acceptance I wont go too far, not interested in that anyways.<br><br>Hey anon, you are doing God's job done, and sure I will let you know if I anything crosses my mind.

It's more than some species of fish share with each other.</br>  <br><br> wanting to contaminate Monster Musume with one of the most cancerous and annoying stock-characters that is currently ruining modern anime <br><br>No, seriously, fuck tsunderes and their bullshit.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Too generic. I want normie haremshitters to leave.</br></br>  <br><br>I think that's her point.<br><br>All we have in common with cows and pigs are being warm-blooded mammals that live on land.<br>All Mero has in common with fish is that they both live underwater, as Mero probably isn't in the same genus as fish and is a mammal instead.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tsun <br> ever good  <br>Get out! GET OUT!</br></br></br>    <br>Nice dub dubs. As for your comment, MonMusu would actually benefit from a tsundere, if they introduced an actual tsundere.<br><br>There hasn't been an actual tsundere in anime in decades.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes, because if there's one thing MMnIN needs, it's some shitty stock-character going "baka, it's not like I like you" while acting like a cunt.</br></br>  <br> the same genus as fish <br>what</br></br>  <br>That scene was quite the wild ride.</br>  <br><br> However, as long as the gills are wet, they can breathe above ground. <br><br>This is pretty fucking lame.<br>It's weak enough for Mermaids to be immobile on land, but they should at least have amphibious respiration that works just as well in the water as out of it.<br><br>With shit like this, all it would take to kill Mero is a lack of fucking moisture.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> tsundere <br>We already have one.</br></br></br></br>  <br> fish lady would die in the desert <br>Oh no, that doesn't make any sense.</br></br>  <br><br>What did Kii do to Suu in that second-to-last panel?<br>I'm having trouble reading the action here, which is rare for Okayado's layouts.</br></br></br>  <br>Used a root/vine to cover Suu's mouth. Sort of like how Miia whips out her tail to grab Darling by the head.</br>  <br><br>Anybody would die in the desert.<br><br>My problem is that according to this data, Mero would die in a fucking greenhouse.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Covered her mouth with root-tentacles to keep her from divulging the secret that she likes Darling.</br>  Well this is it /a/.<br><br>Today's The Day.</br></br>  cuck day?  <br>That is a nauseating image.</br>  Ugh..don't you think that thing is too big?  there's a butt on her chest  <br>I feel so let down from the PVs.<br>Same with monster musume. These should both have been ecchi, not this cencored bullshit. Too bad our current anime-industry is more concerned about money than making good stories. Prison School could've been great, but I think we'll be sorely dissapointed</br></br>  <br>Who the fuck was the one that put JC. Staff in charge?</br>  <br>Wait, its censored? In a buy our BDs way? Or censored period?</br>  <br>Monster Musume was barely censored at all. It could have been much worse.</br>  <br>Not black bars and fog, but they just don't show tits.<br><br><br>I sort of agree, but there are focus on breasts in MonMusu, like where they suck the stuff out of that tree-thing, but (un)fortunately, they probably won't cover that in the anime adaption.</br></br></br></br>  Getting ready to blow my brains out.  <br>Pretty sure Japanese people are the flattest on the planet and don't have boobs like that.</br>  <br>Prison school rarely shows gential, and even when it did it was later in the 100+chapters</br>  <br> Today's The Day <br><br>You really think they won't censor this at some point, do you?<br><br>I will watch it out of curiosity, but I already know I would shot in the head person who choose Hana seiyu.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon, you have gone full retard and beyond saving.</br>  <br>Picked up.</br>  Its going to be shit.  <br>Just like the manga.<br>You fucking simps that like fendom are scum</br></br>  <br>I see the shit tier trolling already starting.</br>  <br>/pol/ please. I know you guys think femdom is a jewish created fetish but it existed since ancient times.</br>  <br>Like the manga is shit tier<br><br><br>/pol/ is shit Im saying you are a fucking pussy and probably a cuck</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because JC Staff got Mizushima Tsutomu as director</br>  <br> Implying this manga is solely femdom <br><br>But you wouldnt know that anyway would you troll.</br></br></br>  <br> actually hyping yourselves up for censored garbage <br>No seriously, im expecting Terraformars level of censorship here. Is there any reason you faggots arent just sticking to the manga?</br></br>  Prison School is a garbage manga with shit tier designs and premise anyway  Anyone know how long the show gonna be? 12 or 24 ep  <br>Its also some stupid plot about a prison in a school<br><br>Its fucking retarded its what it is.<br>Went full retard when the boys finally get out anyways</br></br></br></br>  <br>This. None of the girls are cute.</br>   26 posts <br> 19 IPs <br><br>Gee i wonder which faggot is trolling.</br></br></br>  <br> 8hrs remaining  <br><br>how long till subs?</br></br></br>  About time, I've been waiting for these breasts for a long time.  <br>Lmao shit taste confirmed, it got way better when they got out.</br>  <br>Hot &gt; Cute</br>  <br>Yeah it turned into "which girl will win?" garbage<br><br>Fuck your shit taste</br></br></br>  Why does japan hate foreskin?  Western brainwashing  <br>Phimosis</br>  <br>Whose fault do you think it is?<br><br>Hint: Japan surrendered to them.</br></br></br>  <br> Western brainwashing <br><br>But nobody cuts their dicks in Europe</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> bumping and replying to a tripfag </br></br></br>  <br>American brainswash.</br>  <br>because you're a faggot. Foreskin is disgusting and unhealthy as fuck. Good luck with your STDs.</br>  <br>Look at this brainwashed ameritard, thinking foreskin causes STD"s<br><br>Enjoy your lack of pleasure</br></br></br>  <br> Liking having an ugly dry dick that you can't even use to masturbate without spitting in your hand. </br>  <br> 2015 <br> Still having a cut dick </br></br>  <br>Didn't know people were still retarded. Oh wait, this is 4chan. It's been scientifically proven that having foreskin attached increases your risk of getting HIV transmission and incidence of STDs. <br><br><br> Needing to fap when you have a woman. <br><br><br> 2015 <br> Still thinking backwards </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What? You think that you are just gonna stick your cut dick into a girl with aids, and walk out without having aids?<br><br>Silly American, keep being upset that you have a damaged penis</br></br></br>  <br> implying I would be stupid enough to fuck a girl with AIDS without having her get checked first </br>  <br> Having a woman </br>  Maybe not.   Tfw German <br> Tfw even though we lost Amerifats didn't manage to brainwash us and make us hate our foreskin <br><br>Japs are just beta fags</br></br></br>  <br>Why do germans always use tbh tfw and shit like that? You don't sound smarter you autistic retards.</br>  I've never seen my dick with the forehead pulled back.  <br>Back to /b/ please.<br><br>Or Reddit, it's basically the same.</br></br></br>  <br>Apparently having one's foreskin cut augment the risk of weird chromosome number.</br>  <br>Really? Even when soft?</br>  <br> foreskin <br> unhealthy <br>What?<br>If you're concerned about hygiene, you literally just pull it back and wash it with soap and water like any other bodypart.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Look you can choose to have a foreskin, but denying the benefits of having a circumcision is ludicrous. There's so much science that supports getting a circumcision is healthier for you. It's not a matter of opinion which one is better from a health viewpoint, it's a fact. That being said, it's still your opinion to keep your foreskin or not.</br>  <br>And those health benefits can be solved by simply by pulling it back and washing it. Not that a fat american would understand how to do that</br>  <br>That's his fucking point tardmongler, it's fucking inconsequential.<br>If you want to avoid STDs, you either wear a condom or avoid fucking them in the first place, whether or not you're cut doesn't even factor into it.</br></br>  <br> Look you can choose to have a foreskin <br><br>Yeah, looks at all those American babies that gave their approval.<br><br>The only reason it happens, is to make it so we can't physically distinguish Jews from Americans thus can't get shoah'd anymore.</br></br></br></br></br>   mfw kikes actually cut their penis <br> expect everybody else to follow their ways </br>  <br>That sounds like a case of phimosis and I strongly encourage you to see a doctor about it, getting it fixed (which doesn't neccessitate circumcision), will dramatically improve your quality of life, sex/masturbation will feel amazing (whether you're cut or not), instead of painful, which it commonly is with phimosis. Cleaning and maintenance also becomes a breeze, thousands of times easier and faster.</br>  <br> muh science <br> implying the science behind circumcision being good isn't vague at best and that every argument for it can't be countered with simply just washing like a civilized person or using condoms <br>Being cut/uncut really changes odds VERY LITTLE, if at all, in terms of sanitation or disease risk.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I wonder how many people actually do that. How many little kids or old men who are uncircumcised, remember to always wash themselves or don't do a good job of washing themselves then end up with a UTI or Penile Cancer. What about the people with phimosis who literally can't pull their foreskin back? <br><br>It's a lot more efficient and easier being uncircumcised.</br></br></br>  <br>Spoken just like a 15th century monk</br>  <br>Schedule an appointment with a doctor, you wont regret it.</br>   Sex for pleasure   <br>Moshe pls go.</br>  <br>Well, being cut makes cleaning easier, if nothing else.<br><br>I'm not for or against it, just making an objective observation.</br></br></br>  <br> Being cut/uncut really changes odds VERY LITTLE, if at all, in terms of sanitation or disease risk <br><br>Got a source for that, retard?</br></br></br>  <br> more efficient and easier <br>And that's all this boils down to. Science be damned, you're just too fucking lazy to take care of yourself<br><br>Enjoy not feeling any sort of real pleasure, simply because you can't be arsed to clean yourself</br></br></br></br>  <br> in shower <br> pull back foreskin <br> lather with soap like any other bodypart <br> rinse off <br>Oh shit it's so hard and difficult!<br>Again, it's seriously not an issue if you're even remotely capable of taking care of yourself.<br><br> inb4 smegma <br>Practically never had it in my life and it washes away in a snap anyway.<br><br> phimosis <br>A medical condition that can commonly be cured by itself over time, or by having a very simple and brief surgical procedure which doesn't have to involve the removal of the foreskin at all. There, your dick is fine now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  ITT: Worst girl in their respective series          <br>You're waifu</br>    <br> implying you wouldn't lick her belly furiously </br>  Are you ready for the crappy ending of 2wei Herz?<br><br> Where Miyu is captured to another world. </br></br>  I can't wait for the doujin and lewd images from pixiv.  <br>Isn't there supposed to be a 2wei OVA?</br>  <br>It was delayed until July 25th.<br><br>Also the new season starts July 24th and new chapter of 3rei comes out July 26th.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm waiting for Gil myself.</br>  <br> All they have left is the fight against Gil <br>They can't do 13 episodes of this unless they go into 3rei</br></br>  <br/>    Who is the VA of Ko-Gil?  <br>It's 10 episodes again.</br>  Any chance of getting delicious Angelica animated?  <br>Best bet is just at the end where they world transfer over.</br>  <br>We should get a cameo of her and Thor-chan as they show up to get Miyu and the others to Ainsworth world at the end</br>  It's 10 episodes again, right? Do they have enough content?  <br>They can pad it out with some of the side chapters from 3rei.</br>  <br>If they make a cliffhanger end  and announce 3rei , yes<br><br>they used 16 of 27 manga chapter in the first part, they need to use Side chapters of zwei and drei (like Rin remember kid Shiro) and add more fanservice/extra Scenes (Like Luvia Butler v/s Bazet )</br></br></br>  <br> bigger bust than Leys <br><br>Oy vey<br><br> Why the fuck are Luvia's measurements still unknown </br></br></br></br></br>  Will we get this chapter?  I'm surprised you guys are so sure that SL would do 3rei. It's obvious that they enjoy animate the cute lolis / fanservice part of Prisma the most while battle is just side dish, 3rei is the opposite with pretty much non-step action so I doubt they even have the budget for it to not look like shit.  Why are all the best Type-moon not written by Nasu?  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if they went with an anime original ending to the series. Beyond what you said, 3rei is a big investment. It's as long as 2wei at this point and it keeps on going, so that's two whole seasons to factor in.</br>  <br>When is Gil going to appear? mid-seasonish? I don't follow the manga beyond spoiler pages in Fate threads but I've heard good things about the Gil alter (?) fight.</br>  <br>Endou Aya if they keep the old VA.</br>  <br>I'm waiting for them to exploit Kuro's underlying pranalust for Gil</br>  <br>They can make a original ending for zwei and if they make drei they can make a original start episode (like they need to check the zone where Illya fight gil)</br>  <br>I hope you're not talking about Prisma here. Other than fanservice for TM audience and pedophiles, this series has nothing else to offer. Flat characters, failed attempt at serious plot in 3rei, aweful humor.</br>  <br>He's the final boss of 2wei<br><br>Then he becomes a protagonist in 3rei and eventually peaces out because the writers didn't know what to do with him anymore</br></br></br>  <br> The first to tip a fedora </br>  <br>Aside from the beach shenanigans, the rest of 2wei is fighting against Gil, there's a couple of good fights, especially the one involving Bazett.<br>The fight people usually talk about is one of Ko-Gil vs an homunculus using his card in 3rei.</br></br>  <br>That is a good option, we won't be left with a cliffhanger and they can still start 3rei later if they feel like it. I prefer them to gather enough budget before touching 3rei at all.<br><br>However if they didn't go to the alternative world right after the fight then what would to Gil and his card?</br></br></br>  <br>He's been way for like one chapter, just give it time, I'm sure him and Kotomine are up to something.</br>  <br>I feel like they're going to make KoGil show up for more than he did in the manga, in terms of not being his Alter form and talking to Illya and the crew. I feel like they'll add a few scenes for him.</br>  <br>It's so weird that he just left like that. At the start I thought him and Kirei were scheming something together for sure but nothing came out of it. Part 3 sure have lots of anti-climax situations.</br>  <br><br><br>Man Ilya a cute</br></br></br>  <br>The first priority right now is info dumping, we really don't know a lot about what the fuck happened in that last fight. Then I'm sure some Gil and Kirei shenanigans will happen.</br>  <br> info dumping <br>I was really expecting this, but when I was rereading the manga I realize there's really not much to tell, Miyu has already given quite a lot of information during the 3 series.  Miyu's Kiritsugu is dead, for example. </br></br>  <br>Still better than drei. Shit goes more over the edge forgetting about sol parts and fanservice. I got into this for lolis not this holy grail bullshit again.</br>    Next chapter when?  <br> Flat characters, <br><br>You mean delicious flat characters.</br></br></br>  <br>26th.</br>  <br>That's an impressively-sized black knight greatsword.</br>  this and carnival phantasm are the only good things to come from the TM franchise  <br>Or they can just adapt as is since 3rei has a potential for more character goods.</br>  <br>Why does Miyu looks so serious there? She's surrounded by Illyas in slutty clothes, that's like her heaven.</br>  So well get<br><br> Episode 1: Beach Party <br> Episode 2: Attack on MudGil, end with him breaking free <br> Episode 3: Attack on MudGil pt2, with ZweiForm Illya <br> Episode 4: Drawback into the parallelworld <br><br>?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>        <br> Miyu's puffy vulva outline  <br>Lewd</br></br>  <br>Miyu is without a doubt the lewdest Prisma.</br>  <br><br><br>Is this the first time takeuchi has drawn miyu?</br></br></br>    <br> not Kuro <br>Kuro is also a slut.</br></br>  <br> Mimi most popular among Illya's friends <br> Illya, Kuro, and Miyu head and shoulders above everyone else <br>All is right with the world.</br></br></br>  <br> Rin above Luvia  <br><br>Legit great taste from Japan for once.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck yeah Illya</br>  <br> best girl in a three way tie for last <br>Fuck you two, Japan.</br></br>  <br> two <br>Time for bed.</br></br>  <br>OHOHOHO Rin pleases studio staffs for votes!</br>  <br>Jesus Christ is her pussy trying to eat its way out of her clothes?</br>  <br>They skipped some shit from 2wei already though. I just want the Shirou beach episode, dammit.</br>    <br> Shirou beach episode <br>I'm sure they can still adapt that.</br></br>  <br>I think I'm getting my timeline mixed up. The beach is pretty much right after the first Bazette fight, right?</br>  <br>wont it be the first episode?</br>  <br>They already showed a bit of it in the trailer.</br>  <br>Most people are just waiting for the shit that happens after this season especially Shirou, Gil, Kotomine, and all the other husbandos<br><br>Although the Extra chapters are probably the ones people want the most.</br></br></br>  <br>Tatsuko doesn't have nearly enough votes.</br>    <br>They'll probably skip around some parts though. I'm pretty sure Shirou is not as prominent in the anime as he is in the manga.</br>  Who do you think they're going to pick to eventually voice Tanaka? I could actually see  Chiaki Omigawa  working out.  <br> Fate／kaleid liner PRISMAILLYA.zip  https://mega.nz/#!TwtU1LCJ!7_4QMbN3<wbr>YHZli4W_IaHXva4QNSfc4i8t8WjwO3PoRfo<wbr></wbr></wbr> <br>Complete up-to-date manga.</br></br>  <br> doujin-artist-turned-mangaka is more skilled than a longtime professional VN character designer <br>Takeuchi needs to step it up and move beyond his same-face problems already. It's been over a decade now and he gets more work than ever.</br></br>  Where was Miyu during UBW?  <br> to another world <br>Yeah, to a world of some actual fucking proper action. Ikuzo, motherfuckers!</br></br>  <br>Probably was never born or died in the fire.</br>  <br>wait so shirou the fucker had a lil sis called miyu that died in the fire and he forgot?<br><br><br>That would be some serious plot twist</br></br></br></br>  <br>We don't know. She's never mentioned anywhere outside of Prisma. She might have simply not existed.</br>  <br>Someone should abduct the writers of both fate and prisma illya and hold them hostage until they answered all of /a/´s questions</br>  Next ch is finally supposed to address Miyu and her Shirou's past right?  <br>Yep. Should be a doozy. It's got a lot to cover.</br>  <br>yup<br><br>wanna see more imouto-miyu</br></br></br>  <br><br>I thought in F/SN Shirou mentioned a Sister who died in the fire.</br></br>  <br>If he does, I certainly don't remember. Hardly anything on his life before the fire is brought up.</br>  <br><br>If memory serves, he was taking about walking through the park where his house used to be.<br><br>Fuck knows what route that was though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't matter because Miyu is basically the Type-Moon verse equivalent of xxxHOLiC's Watanuki; exist just to be the suffering substitute.</br>  <br>so Miyu is this?<br><br><br>fine with that</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't watch it for the plot</br>  will there be much luvia in this one? I'm hoping appearing in the ubw anime will increase her popularity.  <br>I should reread 3rei now that I've actually played a bit of the first Dark Souls. See what I missed.</br>  So, 2wei finished the Bazett stuff. Wasn't that pretty much the end of 2wei, with the whole Gil and Miynapping being almost directly after?<br><br>Also, they better animate the fujo chapter. Illya and Kuro's reactions to Mimi being a closet Fujo were priceless.</br></br>  Look  <br>And</br>    <br>Are they adapting the swimsuit shopping episode?</br>  <br>i hope so!</br>  <br>They showed it in the pv.</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=TeV<wbr>W6O1C8g0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>Crunchy made a lot of that sort of mistake in both Prisma and UBW. Apparently the word for "association" and the word for "church" are the same in Japanese, and the people translating this shit aren't actually that familiar with the Nasuverse.</br></br>  <br> association" and the word for "church" are the same in Japanese, <br>How does that make sense? They're different organizations.</br></br>  <br>教会 refers to the Church. 協会 refers to the Association. Both are pronounced "kyoukai".</br>  <br><br>Seems like a common mistake. Manga scans did the exact same thing.</br></br>  <br>Probably because "church" is a more common word in casual Japanese than "association."<br><br>Then again, anyone familiar with Bazett's character knows she works for the Association, not the Church.</br></br></br>    <br>Bee Hell It</br>  Zodd is Guts' father  <br>Thanks for spoiling the story, fucker.
