[ Fuck fansubbing. It's been like two weeks and this shit is still not subbed. Absolutely useless. Fuck you all.  k  <br>How about you learn moon, lazy fuck.</br>  Just wait like everybody else.<br><br>2 weeks is hardly long stop feeling so entitled.</br></br>  <br>How about I don't waste my time on pointless shit, huh?<br><br><br> just wait <br> implying it will ever get subbed <br>It can't be ripped from CR or Funi so no one will do it. Fansubbing is dead. Fuck them all. Cunts.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't we just discuss how delicious new girl is?</br>  <br>Download Horriblesubs, they're a fansub too.<br> I just wanted to at least make one shitpost today. </br></br>  <br>It will be subbed eventually.<br><br>It's not like you're having to wait months like some people have for subs of OVAs</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, and btw you can translate it from Spanish or whatever. You literally do not need to know Ching Chong.<br><br><br>No one cares about stupid OVAs, literally nobody.</br></br></br></br>  <br>don't worry anon, when duolingo launches english to japanese we will have a new wave of fan subbers and nothing will go unsubbed again</br>  <br>You need not watch it. It's shit anyway.</br>  What can we guess about newgirl based on the shit in her bedroom?<br><br>She has a bunch of little paintings along her upper wall. Maybe she teaches art to kids? They aren't all paintings, though. Some look like framed awards or something else official-looking.<br><br>Has a makeup mirror on her table, so she probably takes time to make sure she looks good.  What a slut. <br><br>Is that a festival shirt/robe/thing hanging off her door? I don't know, but if it is then it might be something she does in her spare time.<br><br>Teddy bear on the right. Child at heart?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She seems like a normal girl, Anon. I don't think she draws though, or she would have a tablet laying somewhere.</br>  I want to pin Rui on the hood of his car and fuck his boypussy while X watches.  <br>did you even check the wiki to see who is doing it? I don't know maybe the group that subbed the first series is doing it.</br>  <br> Commie?, Crunchyroll?, Cthuko  <br>The first one will obviously not translate episode #0 and I've literally never heard of the last one. It's over man, episode #1 airs this Friday and it will make watching #0 pointless.</br></br>  <br> How about I don't waste my time on pointless shit, huh? <br>And this is exactly why your pointless shit hasn't been subbed. Let that sink in.</br></br>  <br>How about you stop watching anime then? Go do something productive</br>  <br><br>If I could just punch people through my monitor, you two would be the first to have your faces decorated with my fist.</br></br>  <br>Are you going to do that yourself or beg others to do it for you again?</br>  <br>Others, of course. It's below my level to get involved in such menial work.</br>  Good job OP, what a great thread.  <br>How about I slice you with my katana, huh?</br>  Just watched it. It's not worth subbing. Gatchaman is shit to begin with anyhow.  I watched the first person and I wanted to strangle Hajime. She is by far the most annoying anime character to date. She single handedly destroyed that show. Probably still would've been bad without her, but still.  <br> having shit taste <br><br> not liking genki <br>I'd recommend you return to /v/, n00b. This animay business is definitely not for you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>what, it's airing now? the fuck?</br>  <br>An episode 0 aired, mostly a refresher with about 7 minutes of new stuff.</br>  Your posts in this thread show, that you're an entitled cunt. I legitimately hope that you die in a horrible and excruciatingly painful way. Sage  <br> sage is a downvote <br>Back to Reddit with you, pal. ;^)</br></br>  <br>Not him, but there is such a thing as too genki. Hajime is all sunshine, no shade. She's boring.</br>  <br>Don't let people know that you're saging their thread.</br>  <br>She may change thanks to the malevolent alien soul that she's housing.</br>  <br>But Katze is pretty much as genki as her.</br>   the enemy is VAPE <br>brilliant</br>  God, EOPs are dumb.  Learn japanese if you're not content with the subs we get. Stop complaining, and fix the problem if you care about it so much. <br>Not to mention that you're basically getting all of fansubs for free, you're not in a place to complain</br>  Name one reason why you hate it without using the words Mary and Sue.  But I don't hate it.  <br>Not funny, hurts my eyes.</br>  <br>shit.</br>  <br>Literally Reddit the anime</br>  <br>Not enough focus on Jibril</br>  <br> not being acclimated to positive-aligned planes </br>    <br>Gary and stu.</br>  <br>Shit art.</br>  <br><br>IÂ´m not into stories where mains win just because the plot focuses around them.</br></br>  <br>You must not like a lot of anime then.</br>   No nipples.   <br>The story feels pointless.<br>I don't hate it though, it's fun.</br></br>  <br>I want a Jibril war stories spin-off. With her just going around wrecking shit and getting really aroused</br>  <br>It made sense if you watched that episode. They basically got magically removed.</br>  <br>I don't hate it, but I dropped the manga because I got bored of it, and I'm so incredibly fucking stupid I didn't understand the rock paper scissors tie. <br><br>Friends laughed at me and explained it, and I just didn't like it.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a series about game logic for games with bullshit rules. It's basically Kaiji but for children, made up of all the things children love like bright colors, in your face fanservice, and related nerdy main characters who also happen to be the smartest people in the entire world. <br><br>I had fun watching the show but in no way would I ever hold it in high regard. The only half way smart thing the show ever did was the rock paper scissors game at the beginning and that was only because of the way the game's rules were worded.</br></br></br>  <br>It was fun and deserves a second season.</br>  I only like SERIOUS anime for SERIOUS people  <br>Not enough loli fluffy tail voiced by Sawashiro Miyuki.</br>  <br> every thread </br>  I want more.  I dont like the bloom they use<br>Shit hurts my eyes, feels like someone smeared vaseline on my eyes</br>  It's basically SAO in that the premise sets up inherent rules but the actual characters go fuck the rules and they do whatever they want<br><br>There's no real conflict when the writing directly makes it so they win or lose at any point for almost no reason</br></br>  <br>This. The game with Jibril was the best in the entire anime.<br><br>Maybe if they do a S2  ;_;  we'll get to see the other Flugel and their Sora &amp; Shirou fanclub.</br></br></br>  <br>It was my favorite anime that season</br>  But I liked it. Not enough Tet though. He was pretty hot  <br>No nipples.</br>  <br>Aaand /thread</br>  <br>But I like it, it's simple, light and fun.<br>It's the type of anime you can watch with friends and not think too much</br></br>  <br>Reddit: the anime, the experience.</br>  <br>It wasn't good, but I liked it. Guilty Pleasure.</br>  <br> Implying I hate it <br>Why would you do that?<br><br>Shiro is best girl.</br></br></br></br>  I'll just leave these.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Okv<wbr>xvHNhClQ</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=UWe<wbr>ULiYQbak</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=69n<wbr>yEcQ112o</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>      <br>The show thought it was clever while it really wasn't</br>  <br>Please tell me that's a fandub....</br>  <br>I thought it was an enjoyable Japanese animation and I would appreciate if they renewed it for a second season</br>   Asspull: The Anime <br><br>Is there a single game excluding Jibrils where people WERENT pulling shit out their ass to win<br>It got to the point of who could shit the most to counteract the other shit people were using to win<br>Shit</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not enough seasons.</br>  <br>Well, the R P S game i believe had an explanation to it.</br>  <br>not enough porn of steph</br>  <br> Forgetting how half of /a/ couldn't comprehend the rock-paper-scissors scene </br>  <br> It got to the point of who could shit the most to counteract the other shit people were using to win <br><br>That didn't stop Kaiji from being great.</br></br></br>  <br> Asspull: The Anime  <br>That title can belong to one anime alone, and I don't recall Sora having a phone called the "escape diary" with the power to materialize motorcycles.</br></br>  <br>I am talking about the world setting, which was the dumbest shit ever. <br><br>A world with no violence would not resort to some dumb games it would use the same systems of control we have today.</br></br></br>  <br>But can she forcibly tie a coin flip?<br><br><br>Also after that rant, I still enjoyed the whole thing and want a second season, it's just objectively not a good anime</br></br></br></br>  <br>It didn't "resort" to anything. Everyone was specifically told to settle their disputes with games or incur God's wrath.</br>  <br>Seeing as he just had to aim for it to land between the tiles, it wasn't that much of an asspull. It would have been if he had made the calculations for something like that.</br>  <br>I liked it. Sure it was stupid, but it was fun stupid, and the word association bit was great.</br>  <br>Define "dispute" and define "settle" <br><br>Economic pressure, propaganda, starvation tactics, backroom deals, legislation....<br><br>None of them are disputes, none of them can be settled</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except all of them easily are. You can have all the shady backroom deals you like but the moment Thuggy G feels like a big man and trys to push his prices up a bit suddenly everybody's gotta play a game.<br><br>'Course, "game" is pretty broad so they might play five finger fillet or something that might get somebody cut, who knows. Tet's rules didn't make violence impossible, you just can't use it by itself. A beastman could rip your arm off just fine if you went and challenged him to an arm wrestle.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget you can also bet your life in a game.</br>  <br> country A exports product into country B and sells it cheap destroying country B's economy  <br><br>Tell me what gives country A the right to label this a dispute? <br><br>If I start building a wall around your country, on my soil, how are you going to stop me? <br><br>How the fuck would tax collection even happen in this system? <br><br>How the fuck would countries even exist? <br><br>But yeah I don't have time explaining basic legal and political theory to people like you, so enjoy this garbage show</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want that colors in S2</br>  <br>Except all of those are disputes. Any disagreement is a fucking dispute.<br> Economic pressure <br>"I demand that you lower your tarrifs on goods from my nation."<br>"Nah, get fucked."<br>"Alright, game for it."<br>"Fuck, fine."<br><br> propaganda <br>"Oi, this rag is a load of bullshit, I did not have sexual relations with that woman."<br>"Nuhhuh, you so did."<br>"Well let's see what the dice say about it."<br> starvation tactics <br>"HEY YOU!

The answer is your pic.<br>To appeal to the worst kind of permavirginal otaku scum on the planet.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Tell me what gives country A the right to label this a dispute? <br>Nothing, of course, because they're the ones doing it. Country B can dispute it all they like because 1) it harms them, and 2) you don't need a right or standing to dispute something, the games are enforced by universal law. Any dipshit on the street can call the king out and force a game over absolutely anything. The whole point is that the people who end up king are the Ines who can kick average Joe's ass all day every day without breaking a sweat.</br></br>  <br>What's the point for living without a bit of fun, Anon?</br>  <br> being several steps ahead of everyone (including the one who created the rules) <br>Reminds me of Ultima Online, really</br></br>  <br>that's just taking convenient censorhip another level by incorporating it into the plot. also lazy way to tell you that there will be no nipples in BD.</br>  <br>lack of thighs</br>  <br>What kind of thighs?</br>  <br><br>There is no law in place that forces you to accept a game <br><br>You can simply refuse, as you have no apparent dispute with the other party, it has to challenge you to a game, which you simply refuse over and over.</br></br></br></br>  No nipples, no S2.<br> It was my favourite from that season </br>  <br>the best kind ;)</br>  <br>1 All murder, war, and robbery is forbidden in this world.<br>2 All conflict in this world will be resolved through games.'<br>3 In games, each player will bet something that they agree is of equal value.<br>4 As long as it doesn't violate pledge three, anything may be bet, and any game may be played.<br>5 The challenged party has the right to decide the rules of the game.<br>6 Any bets made in accordance with the pledges must be upheld.<br>7 Conflicts between groups will be conducted by designated representatives with absolute authority.<br>8 Being caught cheating during a game is grounds for an instant loss.<br>9 In the name of god, the previous rules may never be changed.<br>10 Let's all have fun and play together! <br><br>Number 2 seems to rule out waiting-them-out<br><br>I guess you can try to scare them away with a big bet, but as long as they're willing to challenge you and accept the terms/wager something of equal value, seems like it's game-on<br>There's no rule for refusal</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Gary Stu  <br>It's just Mondaiji without the good characters, action, or likability<br><br>females are sexier though</br></br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but almost every challenge they went through ended with MC revealing he had actually predicted everything that happened 3 episodes ago because he's so unbelievably smart.<br><br>It may have been fun the first time, but it was also repetitive and got old really fast for me.</br></br></br>  <br> Dropping the issue isn't resolving a conflict <br>It's when two people want to solve an issue is what it means. You're not allowed to resort to physical violence but you are certainly allowed to say "fuck it, I don't really want to deal with the issue of our borders, leave them as is, no game"</br></br>  <br>the MC. that's one reason and really the only reason. without him it would have been great.</br>  <br>conflict isn't resolved, one party's still very much wants to game<br><br>And who do you think Tet wants to encourage, the gamer or the staller?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, the party who wants the game can fuck off and ask the other party to do the game over and over, and that's it, you can't force anyone to take part in a game that's half the point.<br><br>Tet wants people to have fun, the moment he lets people strong arm people into playing games they don't want to play is the moment the flugel, elves or anyone else with broken abilities decides to steam roll everyone else.</br></br></br>  <br>shiro a shit. no seriously, and I fucking love lolis, but SHIRO A FUCKING SHIT</br>  <br> the moment he lets people strong arm people into playing games <br>how do you think the road-side bandits worked?<br>even they had to get your stuff through games</br></br></br>  <br>The bandits worked because people stuck in the mountains obviously have no choice but to play their game, I mean sure you could refuse but you're in the middle of god knows where, if you dont get the map they have on them somehow you're not getting home is the idea.</br>  <br>Gary Stu.</br>  <br>the games were boring</br>  This Show &gt; Gundam  <br> Name one reason why you hate it without using the words Mary and Sue. <br>Gary Stu</br></br>  <br>gary stu</br>  Unfunny eyecancer starring Stu, Gary.  <br>Blank boobs with no nipples</br>  I'm not from reddit.  <br> hate <br>This and reddit meme needs to die. Who give a shit if reddit, ANN, MAL, AS, or whoever the fuck likes it? Those fags like a lot of stuff we like that happens to be popular. Before NGNL got the trolled by a determined group, it was fun and decent for most fans, and that is still true for me.</br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>No wrrrry, they fucked up</br>   BD still no nipple   <br>Gary and Stu</br>  <br>Oh my fucking god no</br>  <br>No YGO reference<br>Everybody plays shit normie games like poker and chess.</br></br>  I loved it, it was entertaining  <br>Are you, the guy that calls Megumi Reddit too?</br>  <br> No YGO reference <br>Are you blind?</br></br>  <br> series about playing games <br> they all suck ass except the Shiritori one <br><br><br>How do you fuck up this badly? The "chess" match was probably one of the dumbest things I have ever seen.</br></br></br></br></br>   this thread again  <br> implying people hate this  <br><br> implying i can forgive you for posting this  <br><br>Poor Steffu deserves better ;_;</br></br></br></br></br>  Boring<br>Not funny<br>Shit characters<br>Shit plot<br>Shit animation<br>Shit artstyle</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No fucking nipples why cover the fucking breast then, fuck how they can fuck up an anime so much I hate this trend where are my fuking nipples in my fucking anime!!!!</br>  <br>Liar Game would be a better example. I like Kaiji mainly because even though he's smart enough to bullshit out of the situation, by the end of the day, he's pretty much a gambling addict who can't stop himself from getting into the shit, and to use the same words as the series, a 'human scum' who won't mount to much. He may win the games, but they're all Pyrrhic victories.<br><br><br>I don't hate it. I just don't think it's that good either. It falls under the same pitfall of people trying to write stories about super geniuses. You know, the sort that's like 'MC has IQ 10,000,000'. The games and strategies aren't really 'smart', they're more like a bunch of elaborate Calvinballs where the protagonists twist the vague rules to whatever just because.<br><br>Overall, I had fun watching it, but I treat it in the same vein of the typical Hollywood action flick; nothing really memorable, enough to just watch once. Still worth the watch, just far from AOTS like what many made it out to be.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> what is all anime? </br>  <br><br>It works both ways, dipshit. A skilled diplomat could easily annoy a foriegn king into dealing with him because what's the king going to do? Kick him out? He can't unless he wins a game.</br></br>  <br>It didn't get enough porn</br>  <br>It thinks its being smart when it really isn't</br>  <br>MC is a boring as hell Gary Stu. Poor man's Mondaiji.<br>All those fine bitches and lovely visuals, wasted on this piece of junk.</br></br>  <br> MC is a boring as hell <br> shirouf <br>sasuga /a/. Unless you're a VNfag in which case you're a fucking cancer even among your own community</br></br></br>  <br> only likes serious anime <br> oregami gif </br></br>  <br>Kaiji never wins, never really.<br>He survives, it's in the title.<br><br>If you'd put Akagi, Kaiji, Saki and Koizumi on a Mahjong table, he'd still place second with a positive score.</br></br></br></br>  <br> MC is a boring as hell Gary Stu. Poor man's Mondaiji. <br> Has more personality and less Gary Stu traits than Izayoi <br> poor mans Mondaiji </br></br></br>  <br>Agreed, more Steph is needed.</br>  <br>where is it anon i didnt see it prove it</br>  <br>name one anime of the last 2 years that doesnt have this</br>  <br>Too much Steph bullying. She deserved love.</br>  I enjoyed the anime because it was enjoyable and was only simple wish fullfillment fantasy with strong main characters.<br><br>I lost all respect when I read the rest of the novels though, the shit they can do becomes fucking supernatural and retarded and you can tell a lot of solutions and answers are thought up at the end of a chapter and the author goes back to earlier points to insert clues about the solution so it doesn't seem like the asspull that it is.<br><br>Jibril still has a rocking design though</br></br></br></br>  <br>Which is pretty much what I said...?<br>I mentioned Pyrrhic victories for a reason.</br></br>  <br>I'm not going to spoonfeed you</br>  <br>where can i read the rest of the series is it a manga?</br>  <br>Retarded MC.</br>  <br>What the hell kind of newfag question is that?</br>  Expectation of anything remotely intelligent from No Game No Life is utterly foolish. It is an absolutely preposterous parade of otaku cliche wrapped up in a nauseating wish fulfillment fantasy. This is not to say that wish fulfillment is an inherent flaw in storytelling, but the glorification of hikikomori in No Game No Life is not only nonsensical, but also infuriating. While it might be nice for such socially dysfunctional individuals to imagine themselves as the heroes of their own story, No Game No Life effectively only undermines itself and the people it tries to champion.<br><br>The key underlying issue here is that No Game No Life purports an immature world view through two poorly conceived main characters. Both Sora and Shiro profess to dislike the real world because reality does not conform to a set of clear cut rules hence their decision to flee to some fantasy world where everything is a game. Sora in particular speaks extensively throughout the show about the weakness and cruelty of humanity as if he if is a paragon of wisdom regarding human nature. Naturally this all raises the question of why Sora and Shiro act the way they do, but no adequate answer is ever given. Beyond the patronizing feelings this generates, it is hard to take the show at face value when the character espousing such ideas is just a shut-in who probably has not been through much of anything.</br></br>  Came for gaming shenanigans, stayed for hot sexy demon Jibril  It is even doubtful whether Sora and Shiro truly reflect the behavior of social recluses in the first place. This is because it is difficult to believe that someone like Sora would ever encounter major difficulties in real life given his abilities. Besides a few scenes of unfunny comedy that pokes fun at his issues, Sora never encounters any serious problems in interacting with others. He is able to psychologically corner just about everyone he meets and has the charisma to make grandiose speeches to crowds that can move their hearts. No Game No Life attempts to sell its audience these two super intelligent NEET characters who are absolutely awesome in so many ways, but in the process it erodes its very premise.<br><br>Degrading the showâs credibility further is how hypocritical Sora and Shiro reveal themselves to be. Despite their preaching about the real world having no rules, they have zero qualms about exploiting and skirting around every rule imaginable in the alternate world. These underhanded tactics they employ to win in essence make them no different from the society they so loathe. Additionally, they act extremely mean spirited to anyone who does not see everything in the world like they do. Sora and Shiro are far away from being understandable, let alone sympathetic protagonists.<br><br>No Game No Life is the ultimate form of a self-insert fantasy story gone terribly wrong. It trivializes the condition of hikiomori individuals by crafting protagonists that are portrayed to be cool and amazing without any real exploration of what the label itself means for them as people. Moreover, their dubious and outright distasteful characterization reflects poorly on any cause the show could have had as well. The worst offense, however, is not that No Game No Life failed to treat these subjects with any sense of intelligence or maturity, but that it is does not manage to be entertaining in spite of this. For that I cannot express anything but great disdain for this anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah i dont read much manda kind of newfag i only watch anime  can`t you show me a page? </br>  <br>games are shit,there is no tension and the protagonist always wins by pulling out of his ass a masterplan that apparently thought all along but nothing even hinted at that before. The only justification for him doing impossible shit and having exceptional social skills despite being a NEET is "it's because he's smart"</br>  This series got axed, right?  <br>There's this thing called google,it's very useful</br>  <br>Here's an idea for you newfag. Check the same places you download anime</br>  <br>This is a fan dub, r-right?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>But I read somewhere that the mangaka for this got caught tracing his designs from some other manga<br>So it must have probably gotten axed</br></br>  <br><br>the same amount of time it takes you to be mean and dont give me anything rather than just point me to it</br></br>  <br>Then the same people will keep asking for the same stuff and half the posts in a thread become spoonfeeding because people don't know how to be self-sufficient.</br>  So what's the real reason they killed her off  She was too watery  forced drama  <br>best type of drama</br>  <br>She's waifu to scorpion guy.</br>  wait did someone actually die in this series?<br><br>oh it's just Aquarius</br></br>  <br> just Aquarius <br> just one of Layla Heartfilia's final three keys she kept <br> just one of the strongest of the celestial gate keys <br> just one of the key figures of Lucy's childhood <br> just a member of Fairy Tail. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> wait did someone actually die in this series? <br> Lucy's father <br> Igneel </br></br></br>  <br>thousands of other people as well if you actually take the time to count<br><br>Also the only reason the killed off Aquarius is for forced drama and muh plot. There was no reason to do it otherwise apart from her being a big fucking tsundere</br></br></br>  <br>Is there foreshadow to breaking golden key = summoning King mustache?</br>  Berserk.<br><br>Please discuss the manga.<br><br>I miss Hawk.<br><br>Where is Hawk? I have not posted on /a/ for half a year. But I was hoping for a Berserk thread with Hawk when I came back.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  None knows.  Nice bait. Berserk threads are ruined forever because of her and that noname sperg  <br>No I genuinely like and miss Hawk. The last time I posted in a Berserk thread was also to say that I like and miss Hawk (just like I do now).</br>     tfw Berserk will not end in our lifetime   <br> No I genuinely like and miss Hawk. <br>The thirst is real. Consider suicide</br></br>   literal retards still suck the dick of literally retarded random irrelevant shitposter <br>What a surprise.</br>  <br>Berserk threads are dead. Even SnK threads are better now</br>  Is Ilya rescanning and editing other Berserk Volumes? I downloaded a torrent of them but they're all the official Dark Horse translations, with the stupid not-Europe names like Chuder, Iith, etc.  <br>Wow, I've been out of it for a long time.<br>I thought that the Berserk threads were still at the point where mentioning Hawk, or simply invoking her name was enough to completely ruin a berserk thread.<br>They're better without her, I even recall people mimicing the trip, although not getting it perfectly just to further shit up the place further.</br></br></br>  <br>Perfect place for my shit theory.<br><br>Guts gets consumed by the armor when facing Griffeth/Falco and becomes the next skull knight, with Schieke taking Flora's place. Also the God Hand loses a member and has to recruit a new one, making the whole thing cyclical.</br></br></br>  <br>Griffith/Femto, but I do prefer the first one.</br>  <br>If it's cyclical, god would have to die, and there should be a reason that the universe would reset itself.</br>  <br>/a/'s attention whore's are worse than /mu/'s. I actually hope Hawk killed herself</br>  <br>Not even that would be enough to atone for such a crime</br>  <br>is anything even happening in this anymore<br><br>like its all just a bunch of bullshit</br></br></br>  <br> Kentaro Miura <br> caring about Berserk nowadays </br></br>  <br>Ilya doesn't even put whole volumes up anywhere for download.</br>  <br>Please don't... It honestly hurts, and I have no idea why.</br>  <br>Why would god have to die? The cycle could just be one of the mortal world/civilization resetting itself through its own fuck ups. Essentially the world comes to a "golden age" founded by apostles and an incarnation of the god hand, but it's brought down by someone outside like Guts or the skull knight. Afterwards lore of it is lost, but some of the apostles remember and others involved who have extended lifespans. The vitality drain of the berserk armor would make sense to turn guts into something like the skull knight.</br>  <br>It's okay. We're all on this boat together, aren't we?</br>  <br>Fuck the boat.</br>  <br> butthurt <br>He's going to finish Berserk anyway.</br></br>  <br>You know you love it</br>  WHATS THE FUCKS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT?  <br>find out next time</br>  <br>k-kentaro?</br>  <br>I stopped reading Berserk when the guy with the super-long lance appeared. Just skewering five people at once *without even moving forward*. Like, using it in semi-close-quarter combat. How the fuck does that even work? You have to hit them with the tip, but how can you do that if the tip is twenty meters away and the guy is at five meters? Fucking bullshit.</br>  <br>its because he's a demon you fuck <br>wait <br>SPOILER <br>(fuck you not going to use actual spoiler text) <br>Him and that whole army of people are demons that serve grifith</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What a retarded reason to stop reading a series like this. I stopped reading when the snake apostle hit Guts into a wall with his tail and Guts spit out blood but didn't die. Suspension of disbelief shattered forever.</br>  <br>If they actually showed the lance curving back and snaking around to skewer the fuckers, I would be TOTALLY FINE with it. But as I recall, it's rigid. Heck, I would be even be ok with it teleporting into people's chests, but it doesn't even do that. It shows up in there and it's implied that it entered from the front, yes there is no way it could have done that geometrically.</br>  <br> and Guts spit out blood but didn't die. <br><br>It's because his breastplate is a solid piece. He didn't get squished but the concussive force rattled him</br></br></br>  <br>Might as well have stopped reading Berserk when the guy with the giant sword appeared retard</br>  Griffith did nothing wrong  <br> I miss Hawk. </br>  First three volumes getting here Thursday. I'm hyped AF  friendly reminder that griffith did nothing wrong and that miura will end up marrying and having children before completing berserk  <br>gattsu is a bit shorter than the demon slayer</br>  Reminder that guts and griffith should have butt fucked to avert disaster.  <br>oops meant to say dragon oh well might as well kill myself at this point</br>  <br><br>The dragonslayers size always varies</br></br>  Is Miura dead?  <br>Hey look a random irrelevant shitposter using the same images in every thread. Get a trip so I can filter you.</br>  Kitauji FIGHTO!<br><br>Final episode today</br></br>  <br>That's borderline ahegao face.</br>  <br>I'm curious, what are you hoping for an ending?</br>  <br><br>Supposedly some Key animator said he saw it and it's the best thing he's ever seen done for TV but that's just an opinion of course.</br></br>  Please give Asuka the perfect ending Kyoani.  <br><br>Forget Oboe arc, Asuka arc is a must.</br></br>  People don't fear god, fear itself is god.  Why does Doflamingo has such great following anyway<br><br>I don't remember past villains having so many fans</br></br>  Final boss of an arc worship is cool and all, but when it gets to this point: http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Donq<wbr>uixote_Doflamingo where the wiki reads like a fan fiction, that's just not cool, anons.</wbr>  <br>Probably because he had so much hype behind him even as far back as Skypiea. He had a huge bounty, he shat on Bellamy and crew, said some cool stuff, controlled some Vice Admirals, Didn't get touched in the War, said some cool stuff there too and even post TS, he's been kind of a badass. Is he the epitome of perfection ? I don't think so. But he certainly deserves some of the attention he's getting.</br>  What were they talking about?  <br> huge <br> pink <br> cocky <br> secretly a family man <br> always smiling even when he's upset <br><br>could also be the aesthetic. The man wears a Vneck and capris under a featherboa coat and old lady glasses<br><br>could also also be the decadence</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Old times. Obviously.</br>  Fuck Oda, he actually believes Rubber is unaffected by Electricity. I couldn't even believe Oda would bullshit an opponent like that. One Piece gets shitter every time a boss battle happens. <br><br> Hypes of bad guy to be unbeatable and worlds ahead of luffy in power <br><br> MUH NAMAKA AND PROTECTING PEOPLE <br><br> Plot Armor and bullshit logic activates killing the OP villain.  <br><br>Just like a shonen, at this point I don't even care anymore. There's no point in even bitching, and yet the Japs made this the most popular anime of all time? USA should have nuked them more.<br><br>Wow I sound so edgy but damn, facts are facts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>is that  Scopper ?</br>    <br> arguing logic in shonen </br>  <br>Either him or Shiki</br>  <br>Who knows? But that is definitely a Wano hat.</br>  <br>shit-tier pasta</br>  <br>He's so fucking hot.</br>    bretty gud fanart  <br>Don't be shy, you know you want him as much as I and Roci do.</br>  <br>that's not even the issue though. That picture you posted is disgusting</br>  <br>I'll try to live up to your standards next time.</br>   come back to /a/ after a year <br> one piece thread is a general now <br> tumblr fujofags <br>welp</br></br></br>  <br>Cya next year Anon.</br>  <br> now <br>yeah no, that's your first day here, newfag. OP threads are generals since ages</br></br>  Why has one piece become awful?  <br>Because chopper stopped being a actual character</br>  <br>That image made me all warm and fuzzy inside.</br>  <br> less than 2 years <br> ages <br>Nah cunt, nah.</br></br></br>  <br> complaining about cartoon logic <br> complaining about plot armor for a protagonist of a battle shounen <br>please be bait or shitty pasta</br></br></br>  <br> not liking Armored Franky or Gear 4th </br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>because you obviously like edgy designs more than goofy ones, but then you should not even read One Piece in the first place</br>  <br> less than 2 years <br>seems like you really are new whore and you basically admited that you were lying, now fuck off</br></br>   You will never be part of Doflaminga's family <br> You will never have hot sweaty sex with her after a day of illegal traffic of weapons and pillaging. </br>  <br>6 months or 9, what's the difference, not that big a time. OP threads used to be on chapter release, and then maybe on sunday.<br>If you don't remember this, or actually prefer the cancerous general, then you're the newfag mate, not me.</br></br>  <br> Implying I want to be part of the biggest job fest of the entire series even for Doflaminga. </br>  <br> OP threads used to be on chapter release, and then maybe on sunday. <br>that was like three years ago or more iirc m8, what the fuck and I belive we had more threads back then not just on those days, but yeah not like now.</br></br>  <br> the biggest job fest of the entire series <br>that is Hodys crew though</br></br>  <br>Doffy and Mihawk look beautiful, Crocodile looks decent, everyone else are nightmare fuel.</br>  <br> that was like three years ago or more iirc m8 <br>Wait what? That can't be right.<br>Too lazy to check the archives myself though.</br></br></br>  <br> genderbent Shichibukai <br> Hancock is still the hottest </br></br>  What the hell kind of beast can withstand a kong gun?  <br>I even think more than that dude.</br>  <br>King Kong</br>  <br>Jesus Burgess.<br> tfw your memory is shit </br></br>  <br>No, they were made to be utter shit. Doffy's crew should have been incredible. Top notch. Not a single shitty jobber. But nope. I mean, I understand why they were jobbers but I still don't want to be a part of that.</br>   Sai gets to bang that   <br>I swear that this is becoming spam/bait/bs like that "Lucci pasta"</br>  <br> Jinbe:"Nice body" <br><br>well then. Jinbe potentially has some hidden depth</br></br></br>  <br>They met average expectations. You forget that most villains have garbage underlings and one-shot, one-kill fights are common.<br><br>It's not like the Strawhats even 1v1 the DonQuixote crew, famous New World pirates did most of the fighting/jobbing.</br></br></br>  Ok everyone! Its that time of the thread! Time for Sanji hate!<br><br>Sanji is the worst character in all of One Piece, all he is, is a beta white knight. He's the most disloyal member of the crew and he'd gladly betray Luffy and the other Straw Hats for a pair of giant tits. <br><br>Post timeskip he's gotten even worse, all he did was nosebleed over a bunch of mermaids. On punk Hazard he couldn't even kick down a door. <br><br>I can't wait until we see him lying in a pool of his own blood after jobbing to big moms crew. Hopefull we'll see him next chapter. <br><br>Oda should either give him an okama mode or kill him off</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd tap FemLaw tho. And She-Killer has nice boobs and sexy neck.</br>  <br> posting pasta that is not even stale but dead by now </br>  Okay, here is the deal: I want to reread Dressrosa, but I just noticed my go-to page for OP only has the latest 30 chapters due to copyright reasons. Where should I go for rereads?  <br>Download from nyaa.se and read in mangameeya.<br><br>Alt. bato.to</br></br></br>  <br>I'd say kissmanga since you can scroll down through pages instead clicking through.<br><br>http://kissmanga.com/Manga/One-Piec<wbr>e</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Alright, thanks!<br><br><br>Thanks, but I don't feel like downloading stuff. Just a habit of mine, and kissmanga seems less convoluted aswell.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is magnificent.</br>  <br>The most annoying thing has to have been that fucking golden ball that should incinerate Luffy completely since it was molten when it touched him.<br>Also, holy shit the horsepower and traction on Nami's scooter.<br>But I agree with the others, you are getting 3 autistic 5 me</br></br></br>  <br>He had the best lines during Marineford<br>Only reason I can think of, I personally think he's a faggot</br></br>   tfw we will never see him again   <br>him being a faggot might actually make him more popular.</br>  <br> on the visually appealing side. <br> psychotic but protective of his family. <br> Got some background to his character <br> Might not be the most complex character but just enough to question if he would've turned out differently in different circumstances <br> despite opinions of the final fight, he still comes off as a strong fighter <br> built up hype carrying over </br></br></br></br></br></br>  You know what I'd like to see? More logia users (or paramecia for all I care) that use their abilities to keep machines running or something. I don't mean that their ability has to be machine-related or anything, but sorta like Enel powering his arc, he just sits in the middle sending his electricity inside to keep it going.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127354642 <br> What happened to him anyway? <br>Clearly, he returned to Sniper Island, where he lives to this day.  In our hearts. </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127354642 <br>You can melt a rubber band with a fucking match, gold's melting point is like 1.1k Â°C.

Maybe they helped the rest of the strawhats escape.</br>  hes going to die from the internal bleeding right?  <br>I forget, was smoker's bike in the manga?</br>  <br>At least it ain't Fem!Trebol or Fem!Pica (Gravely Voice)</br>  <br>If he isn't pronounced dead then oda is truly a hack</br>  <br>I think it will just be a copout of "strings fixed it and then it grew back together".<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127355793 <br>Yes, the symbol of tricks and memery.</br></br></br></br>  <br>did you already forget Pell?</br>  <br> Honestly it was the only thing that bothered me that arc. <br>it should not bother you at all since you should have noticed long ago that One Piece does not follow real life physics and laws</br></br>  So, Zoro actually did kill someone, hu?  I need u Nami  <br>Because his design is fucking amazing</br>   Real fight never <br> He won't be challenged till Shilliew or Mihawk </br>  <br>It would be strange for Luffy's first conscious kill to be one that does the tenryuubito a favor.</br>  <br>Vista<br><br>Also, come on, he was probably the most fucked up after every fight pre-timeskip, in every arc. I think he deserves this small break, though only if he actually gets to have a proper opponent in the next arc.</br></br></br>  <br>If you're a homosexual or a transvestite, maybe.</br>  <br>k.</br>  <br>Not even a b8 m8, I'm serious. He looks like he is about to attend the pride festival.</br>  <br> Big Fat Ugly Bug-Faced Baby-Eating O'Brien </br>    <br>L</br>  <br>I am neither but I think his design is pretty cool.</br>  <br>That's because you're a closet homo</br>  So, if Elizaberro got the mera mera no mi, would he have been able to charge up his king punch instantly due to the heat, and become a yonko killer?  <br>This page transribes Bartolomeo as "Balto Romeo".</br>  <br>If the punch didn't kill them, the wave of heat in front of it would give them a shock.</br>  <br>well, that sucks. didn't know that. if you don't mind mangastream translations then you can read it here too<br>http://www.mangastream.to/one-piece<wbr>.html<br><br>or bato.to has powermanga translations but they only have up to chapter 789. They translate slower, but probably have the best translations.<br>http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/one-p<wbr>iece-r39</wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>No, it's no big deal. I just found it funny.</br>  Kaidou &amp; his crew are going to have to really shine to outdo this guy.<br>Not to mention he may be a broker now.</br>  <br>Just imagine hundreds of luccis. That's kaido's crew.</br>  <br><br>shhh you can't talk about him here.</br></br>  <br> that shit trigger discipline </br>  <br> He seriously thinks Doffy is going to die <br><br>I mean, I think Monet's dead and even I'm sure Oda's gonna bullshit some way for him to live</br></br></br>  <br>He's fought literally only three people so far (I'm not counting that bullshit against Hody) and Pica did give him a hard time, I mean its not like he one-shotted him, he did have to actually put on his headband again.<br><br>Wano is literally the sword island so he'll have to get a real fight there</br></br></br>      <br>pretty sure he has both hands, the hook is just a weapon</br>  <br>Kaidou arc is not gonna be anytime soon. Too early for Luffy to fight a yonko yet.<br><br>Next arc is probably Kuma. It been implied already that the straw hats are gonna fight him again in the new world.</br></br></br>  When?<br><br>It's now the most pressing plot item...after having a party.</br></br>  <br> Hey guys! Look at me! I'm American :D </br>  <br>Why has no one shopped a "ur" at the place of the BIG on the sail yet?</br>  <br>I'm Canadian and I don't own any guns though.</br>  <br>Probably in a month or so</br>  English VAs for the Supernovas were announced if anyone still cares  <br>I saw. Levi is Law<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/sPyUUi38_U4?t=2m4s<wbr></wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Link pls</br>  <br>jesus christ<br>this is so awful <br>only the supreme commander is fine</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah and Yusuke is Kidd.<br><br>Honestly, I actually like his voice and I think that one would be better suited for Law</br></br></br>  <br>I doubt Zoro will ever fight Vista. I can't see Vista having a beef with Ace's brothers friend, all those Whitebeard fags care too much about family and stuff. Don't say he has to fight everyone to be the #1, he can just beat Mihawk and be the de facto top.</br>  <br>Because Vista is a bad guy!<br><br> No, really, that's an existing retarded fan theory, because he has a tophat and "evil" moustache, and only joined Whitebeard's crew to get the diamond fruit to be an invincible sword fighter and his now Blackbeard's henchman and in Zoro's fight with him Zoro will learn to cut diamond. </br></br></br>  <br>Urouge is the link between seeing Eneru again. I can feel it</br>  <br>Why would they fight Kuma? He has no agency beyond what the government tells him to do. Kuma will have a big role when the Revolutionaries or Vegapunk do<br><br>Wano will probably involve Kaido indirectly, with the big boss being someone samurai related or one of his underlings</br></br></br>  <br>jozu has the diamond fruit<br>do these people even read the fucking thing?</br></br>  <br>Could he kill Mingo?</br>  <br>Yes, he wants to kill Jozu.</br>  So, it's been a like two years since Law's shichibukai status was removed, will we get to know his succesor soon?<br>I mean, there are two unknown ones now, and I am afraid Oda is kinda running out of ideas for these guys, seeing how he gave the job to Buggy.</br>  <br>It's been 2 hours in story since we learned Doffy lied about his Warlord status. Nobody could be chosen yet, and nobody probably will be. Shichibukai will be disbanded before a new 7th could matter</br>  So now that release day shitposting is (mostly) gone, who else actually liked that last chapter?  So, Doflamingo was called the strongest of the shichibukai (I think when he showed up against Smoker), which means he is stronger than Mihawk. Mihawk used to tie with a yonkou, Shanks, though maybe Shanks did not use his haki during those fights, and only his sword.<br>What does that tell us?<br> powerlevels </br></br>  <br>Honestly all I could imagine was how it would look in the anime.<br><br>That said, anybody who can't feel for Kyros as he smiles and then finally sheds tears for the first time in a decade has no soul</br></br></br>  <br>when and where was Doffy ever called the strongest Shichibukai?</br>  <br> So, Doflamingo was called the strongest of the shichibukai <br>No he was not</br></br>  <br> read more mature stuff like Tokyo Ghoul <br><br>what the fuck</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, it depends on what the original japanese phrasing was here, and if it can be taken as face value.</br></br>  <br>I'm quite sure that isn't insinuating he's the strongest, just that he's the biggest asshole</br>  <br>I think the stongest will be the 7th one that we haven't see yet.</br>  <br>Worst does not mean strongest, it can mean most cruel.</br>  <br>Yeah, probably.</br>  <br>It is in chapter 699, just in case any moon speaker feels like looking it up. Though I suspect it ro probably just mean "cruel" or "giant dick", as those other anons implied.</br>  <br> ããã©ãã³ã´ï¼ä¸æ­¦æµ·ï¼ææªãªééããã­ã§ãï¼ï¼ <br> Doflamingo? Shichibukai? Saiakuna yarÅ ja nÄ ka! ! <br><br>Usopp is saying that he's the worst as in he's a nasty evil bastard. Not the he's the strongest person in the shichibukai.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Agreed, it says he's the nastiest. Fucking translators.</br>  <br>Worst and nastiest are synonymous in English. Nasty doesn't read as well</br>  <br>Still, it's more appropriate than worst.</br>  <br>Worst is fine in that situation. I have no idea why anybody would think that would mean strongest especially since Usopp is the one saying it</br>  <br> Pica did give him a hard time <br> Literally never landed a single attack </br></br>  <br>Yeah but it's not like Zoro was able to easily deal with him like drunk fish guy and Monet</br>  What penguin was there on that island that needed a good boy gun to be put down?   this lil shitter never became nakama <br>MAKE IT CANON ODA</br>  <br>that's just because pica kept running away like a bitch. Pica couldn't do shit to Zoro and neither did anyone else post-timeskip. I hope he actually gets a challenge in Wano where there are real sword masters.</br>  How NIPPON DAMASHI are we going to go with Wano?  <br>Mondo nippon damashi.</br>  How BTFO would Lucci be if Luffy used King Kong gun on him?  You guys like dub cast announcements, right?<br><br>http://onepiecepodcast.com/2015/06/<wbr>29/the-eleven-supernovas-english-du<wbr>b-cast-revealed/<br><br>The Supernovas:<br><br>Trafalgar Law â Matthew Mercer (Levi, Jotaro Kujo, Chrom)<br>Jewelry Bonney â Laura Wetsel (no notable roles)<br>Capone Bege â Kyle Hebert (Kamina, Teen Gohan)<br>Basil Hawkins â T.

I really sympathized for him since he wasn't absolutely evil, he was only groomed by his current family to be who he is.<br><br>I kinda hope Oda pulls a Lordgenome with him and makes him a SH ally for mariejois if he's not confirmed dead in the next chapter. He could fuck shit up there since he hates them too.</br></br>  <br>Was wopple a world noble</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Doffy's own flashbacks indicated that he was always going to be an evil little shit even without his Family's help</br>  <br>A thousand good boys, you say. Hmm</br>  <br>Yeah this. Remember in 782 that even the family were surprised that he fucking decapitated his father's head and took it to Mariejois. Then when Law mocks Trebol telling him that Doffy is just stringing the seats along like puppets, Doffy yells at Trebol not to listen.</br>  So what happens thursday?  <br>Either realization that half the crew is missing, or a party</br>  Did all the doffyfags leave the thread finally. Did they all finally realize that their worthless character got permanently destroyed?  <br>Sabo's fight with Burgess needs to be resolved.<br>Doffy's body needs to be claimed<br>Fujitora could let everyone go or decide to take some people with him<br>Bellamy might still be dead<br><br>I'm really excited for anything that's not a party or Sabo showboating. I do really like the idea that Sabo tries to kill Doffy for his crimes and Luffy is ideologically opposed to the RA's extremism though</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those brief scenes of the executives finding a 10 year old Doffy and decided to pledge themselves to him need to be expounded on. It still looks like Trebol was masterminding something. Is he even alive?</br>  <br>Speaking of the dub, why is it so terrible?<br>I mean, I know dubs arent held highly on /a/ but usually actiony kind of anime are at least passable.<br>But its all just so awful. Everyone just sounds bored all the time.</br></br></br>  <br>that's because you're dumb<br><br> Hook <br> has Crocodiles <br> has poison <br> 'dies' under a giant clock <br><br>why the fuck wouldn't Captain Hook have a hook for an arm?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Since Kuzan lost a leg and has a lot of burn scars, what does /a/ think happened to Sakazuki's body after the 10-day battle?  <br>I can't believe I never got the Captain Hook thing before<br><br>Oda still hasn't shown the bottom left side of his face or his left side, so he could be pretty fucked up</br></br></br>  <br>Sucka didnt lose so nothing<br><br>Kuzan's wounds were probably Suckazuki being a shit and trying to kill Kuzan after he couldn't fight anymore</br></br></br>  <br>im also fairly certain that Mister 3 is Mister Shmee<br><br>there are probably more reference but i've never actually read the books</br></br></br>  So any ideas what this guy's been up to in those two years? Any chance of running into him in the new world any time soon?  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=63n<wbr>_5TyTVUA</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>We have seen him. And we saw him lose his cool.</br></br></br></br>  You're all faggots    What kind of slave would adult Koala be?  <br>Only Chopper has turned to shit, Luffy is fine and Frankys post timeskip design grows on you over time.</br>  <br> Implying Wano won't give him a challenge </br>  <br>The arc that made me drop One Piece 6 months ago.</br>  <br>I wouldn't classify it as terrible. Compared to the 4kids dub, it's definitely better.<br><br>While I agree that the dub is nowhere near the original version (after all, Oda designed several characters with their voice actors in mind), it does its job well enough.

Oda got off his ass and directed Z (and Strong World) himself</br></br></br>  <br>Characters are canon events aren't anon</br>  <br>can you source your info?</br>  <br>why not</br>  <br>What the fuck are you talking about<br><br>Oda wrote the script and a bonus chapter for Strong World and came up with some character concepts for Z. That's it. Shiki is a canon character that exists in the One Piece world, but nothing that happened in the movies is canon.</br></br></br>    <br/>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/enc<wbr>yclopedia/people.php?id=31129<br>http://myanimelist.net/people/12867<wbr>/Nagamine_Tatsuya<br><br>Holy shit, I can't believe somebody is actually stupid enough to believe Oda directed two movies. Especially since the movies explicitly contradict canon. When the fuck do you think Film Z even takes place?</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>This is drawn by Oda, right ?</br>  <br>There's no way oda would create anything where Kizaru would get that flustered but someone like Z</br>  <br>bullshit, we always have moments like that between arcs</br>  <br>this gif should be updated so it has Robin dancing with the SH's, after this arc she definitely belongs with the goofs</br>  <br>It's signed 'Takumi'</br>  <br>good catch</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>So Z isn't canon but Strong World is since Oda wrote the script?<br><br>THIS scene is canon</br></br></br>  <br> Oda wrote the script and a bonus chapter for Strong World and came up with some character concepts for Z. That's it. <br>Aohige clarified a while ago at APforums that Oda said himself in the guidebook that came with Film Z that he was the supervising producer/wrote the story and characters himself/wrote and oversaw character lines. If you want the specific page where Bluebeard states this I'd have to search, it's bookmarked on another computer of mine that's out of reach.</br></br>  <br>it's not canon just because it makes you wet</br>  <br>but Oda did that scene himself<br><br>He WROTE Strong World. How is that not canon?</br></br></br>  <br>D: Odacchi! Congratulations! They're doing another One Piece movie. But this time, it's your script, right? I'm really looking forward to it!! ...and, when I was watching the movie trailer on my computer I heard the word "Kinjishi" come up - but isn't that the flying pirate who broke out of jail 20 years ago that Sengoku mentioned in chapter 530!? There has to be some connection, right!?<br><br>O: Yes. "Kinjishi". Actually, I really wanted to have his name come up in the scene where Shirohige talks to Shanks in volume 45. But I thought at the draft level that I was handing out too much information and confusing the readers, so I took it away - but in my mind, I have determined that he is one of the legendary pirates who played a big part during Roger's time. Though I didn't think I'd make a movie about him. In any case, "Kinjishi" escaped from Impel Down, and now that 20 years have passed, he's finally starting to make a move, and that's what the movie is about. There's an announcement on page 192.<br><br>Strong World isn't canon, but Shiki as a character is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Let's say just the events of Z really aren't canon does that change the plot of OP as a whole. And vice versa</br>  <br>how does this prove Shiki isn't canon? It says right in your quote that Shiki was always meant to show up but Oda didnt do it when he wanted to</br>  <br>Shiki*<br><br>Strong World</br></br></br>    <br><br>Like I fucking said in the post, Shiki's backstory is canon, but Strong World the movie did not happen.<br><br>Here's a really simple metric: Is it in the manga, or an SBS? If no, it's not canon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It proves he is, you misread what that anon said</br>  <br>Neither Shiki (Roger rival) or Zephyr (former Admiral) lived up to their reputation.<br><br>Oda has to stop making Luffy take down these big shots, he's ruining everyone else's hype.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>saying movies can't be canon is dumb when Oda writes the movie himself</br></br></br>  <br>There's a couple timeline errors just with the amount of time the SH's have spent in the new world, and the new marine headquarters in the film is different than the one in the manga. That's about it that I can remember offhand. Not too big a deal but enough to make it not quite match up with the manga.</br>  <br/>  <br>Whether or not Strong World is canon isn't too big a deal, as it more or less fits in between Thriller Bark and Sabaody, but there's a couple of things that don't quite match up, such as Brook mentions that it's his first time fighting as a Straw Hat against the flying fish riders, Zoro seems completely unaffected by his Kuma injuries throughout the movie.</br>  <br>I see so then to resolve the issue Oda would either need to out right address the conflicts or make the two films in questions non-canonical</br>  Who the fuck is this girl?  <br>there's a pic somewhere of Rayleigh pestering Drake but I have no idea where it is</br>   mfw shanks has the time time fruit   <br>girl from skypiea</br>  Would Oda be willing to make a legitimate stoner character?  Just once i want a OP thread that doesnt devolve into faggotry. They already got gay marriage in the states. Cant you leave One Piece alone?  <br> I'd fuck iva </br>  <br>shanks can swim though</br>  <br> posting Rebecca <br><br>no. Fuck you</br></br></br>  <br>Id give anything in this world to bash your head in with a rock. Id let myself be skinned alive, burned, stabbed, anything at all, just to be given the opportunity to mutilate one fujoshit for ruining the only thing i have on this planet.</br>  <br>Not too bad, Matthew Mercer was one of the VAs I hoped would take Law's role. I was so afraid it'd be JYB.</br>  <br>Maybe he wanted to eat the gomu gomu no mi at that time?</br>  <br>I think you're beyond hope if One Piece is 'all you have'</br>  <br>he was going to sell it for 5 mil</br>  oda made it so obvious that nami will get the yuki yuki fruit in one of her mums fruit  <br> mfw Shanks has an ocean Logia </br>  <br><br>fuck me then</br></br>  what power does ben beckman have?<br>kizaru shit himself when he pointed his gun at him</br>  <br> law and levi have the same seiyuu <br> law and levi will have the english va <br><br>the lore is getting too deep</br></br></br></br>  <br>I really dont care. Id take any punishment or ridicule. I literally have nothing but a show. And id gladly do anything just to feel my eyes roll back in pleasure and drool drip from my mouth to slam a blunt 35-50lb stone against a fujoshits head until the cranium shattered.</br>  <br>haki-imbued bullets</br>  <br>Fishman Island, Punk Hazard, and early Dressrosa had them goofing off with each other.</br>  <br>I really dont see how your lack of a life(social or otherwise) means I can't like what I like<br><br>you a christfag or something?</br></br></br>  <br>Oda already made One Piece gay with characters like Doflamingo.</br>  <br>Would break the devil fruit pattern that Oda indirectly confirmed.</br>  <br>He was bluffing, Kizaru went ahead and ignored him with no reprisal from Beckman.</br>  <br>Don't forget the okama, that is what he really thinks of all you homos.</br>  <br> kizaru shit himself when he pointed his gun at him <br><br>m8, Kizaru was being flirty. He did the same thing with Marco</br></br></br>  <br>whats the pattern?<br><br>why dont the marines have sea stone bullets?</br></br></br>  <br>No im not. I dont even have a problem with homosexuals. Its just something about people taking away the pure shonen aspect about this show makes me wanna do it. Like catcher in the rye and john lennon. One piece was my comfort after i lost some things. And i cant even go to a thread for speculation without someone trying to force relationships that dont exist in a show that doesnt need them. I could honestly say if i ever met someone irl who was a fujoshit for OP, I would end up in prison. Its not even rational, but thats how its.</br>  <br> trying to imply being compared to bon clay is a bad thing <br><br>I'm not even gay, but you should at least read the manga before talking shit.</br></br></br>  <br>that's just a cover<br><br>Look at Bentham and Inazuma</br></br></br>  <br><br>why didn't blueno door-door to the raftel?</br></br>  <br>That's almost slightly reasonable for a mentally ill adjusted person having the urge to bash somebodies head in.</br>  <br>I suppose. You lose enough people, and find something to use as a crutch just to keep some hope, so you dont blow your own head off, then have people constantly smear shit all over it, and see if you dont wanna crack a few skulls.</br>  <br> taking away the pure shonen aspect <br> trying to force relationships <br><br>M8 you may want to consider you have other issues if you feel that something is being taken away from you or forced onto you by seeing a picture with two dudes being cute together<br><br>Seriously, are you from texas/bible belt or something? You should maybe ask yourself why other people enjoying something you don't enjoy upsets you so much</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fujoda found his true passion with drawing cute boys such as Dellinger and Cavendish.</br>  <br>you should maybe seek help<br><br>If you realize its a crutch then you should know its stupid to inflict your mental bullshit on others</br></br></br>  <br>my my, where have YOU been recently?</br>  <br>Not from texas. I dont care about religion. I sont care about who wants to marry who. I just want luffy to find One Piece without becoming everyones bottom, or rayleigh coming out of no where to molest children out of character which doesnt have to do with the plot, or whoch MALE character isnt a WOMAN. I just wanna see shit get fucked up and some lasers and a t-rex in a hat without everyone tripping over a dick every five seconds.</br>  <br> is that you, anon that wants Dellinger more than Robin? </br>  <br>Or maybe people should stop corrupting the damn story with perversion</br>  I guess the thread is dead and the worms are festering now <br>good job /a/</br>  <br> being this defensive about being a fujoshi legbeard </br>  <br>Do posts like I want to fuck Nami bother you as well? Or is it just the homoposters?</br>  <br>then why are you here in this thread?<br><br>If you just read the manga and ignore what other people are talking about, you'd be much happier<br><br>seems like you're inflicting punishment onto yourself and getting mad when you see something you dont like.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah it annoys me. I just wanna talk about the fucking story, and every goddamn thread derails into debauchery and perversion, and its always the fujoshit tumblr/reddit posters that start it. Its old as fuck and annoying.</br>  <br>how is fanart corrupting the story? How is people talking about ships and shit corrupting the story?<br><br><br>this guy just has me intrigued. The bullshit coming out of his posts is unreal. Wanting to kill someone for posting fanart is kind of extreme</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can like like fan art, but i cant like bashing someones brains in? What if thats art to me? Who are you to decide what is and isnt art?</br>  <br>because it makes no fucking sense to the story<br>you are making shit up with no bases, if you are hellbent on annoying people go make your own fucking thread about fanfiction and fan art, stop shitting up these threads<br>not even the guy wanting to kill you but I agree with him with you fags being annoying as fuck <br>you are the reason stories get bloated with fan service and shit like that</br></br></br></br>  <br>The only kinda ship talk should be about the thousand sunny or laws submarine or some goddamn coating.</br>  <br>nah sorry, just a random who yanks everything you post that has Bellamy in it<br><br><br>that doesnt make it less extreme. Honestly I think you're just homophobic. I never see anyone posting shit like that when its girls or even the beastiality pics that have been posted here lately <br><br><br>says who? This thread is for talking about One Piece and that's what's being done</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> because Tumblr is in the filename <br>More like because you are tumblr.</br></br>  <br> because it makes no fucking sense to the story <br><br>what does it matter though? It doesnt actually affect the story, it's just fans doing fan things<br><br> you are the reason stories get bloated with fan service and shit like that <br><br>everyone likes fanservice, not just fujo so you cant pin that on just fujo</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>your fan fiction is not related to one piece<br>you are just using characters designs and names from one piece and distorting them for your own fan fiction <br>go make your own fucking thread and stop shitting this one</br></br></br>  <br> D: Odacchi! I noticed an amazing thing!!! It is that if you show the Straw Hat Devil Fruit users in numbers, it will be the numbers from 1~10!! <br><br> LuffyâGomu Gomu (5.6.5.6.), ChopperâHito Hito (1.10.1.10), RobinâHana Hana (8.7.8.7.), BrookâYomi Yomi (4.3.4.3.) <br><br> (1.3.4.5.6.7.8.10), but there is no (2.9), so is the one who ate the Nikyu Nikyu (2.9.2.9.) no Mi, Bartholomew Kuma, gonna be a Straw Hat next? Please tell me!!! P.N. SHANKUS.LOVE <br><br> O: WHAAAAAT?! (shock) Gosh that surprised me! Why was I surprised?! NO COMMENTTTTTTT!!!!!!!! NEXT!! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ive been here longer than Tumblr has existed tho. The aspies only flare up because they see the filename</br>  <br>well that's a nice opinion you have but you trying to make up rules for what should and should not be talked about is what gets you ignored</br>  <br>Because i have a job, and i come to the threads after work. I just responded to what i saw the most of which has NOTHING to do with OP discussion. And no youre not talking about One Piece. Youre talking about Fanfic and Fan art based off of a fictional idea that doesnt pertain to the original story. As far as being homophobic, i am not. Im against deviating from the original story or speculation about the future of the original story. no where is there a romantic side story between the main characters. Luffy isnt interested. Neither is zoro. Nami wants money. Rayleigh is old and doesnt fucking care. I could go on and on but youll never get it because you want to corrupt and pervert something.</br>  <br> Why was I surprised?! <br>Why would he respond like that, that practically gives it away, he should have been at least a little ambiguous, now it's so easy to guess who will join.<br><br><br>Is Gin dead, or if not, will he ever appear again?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think they'd let him wear it in impel down if it wasn't a prosthetic.</br>  <br> . Im against deviating from the original story or speculation about the future of the original story. <br><br>see this is a personal problem of yours. It isnt actually against the rules to speculate on things in the story that can or may happen in the future. No matter how convoluted you find it</br></br></br>  <br> the cover stories will never be animated as filler </br>  <br> well that's a nice opinion you have <br>There's a board designed to contain hazardous people like you, since you aren't discussing jackshit I say leave this pace.</br></br>  <br>he might be dead but we'll probably see something of him or Krieg in the future. Even if its only a flashback to Gin's burial at sea/gravestone</br>  <br> &gt;not wanting to see speculation or deviation from the canon <br> &gt;goes onto a discussion board full of anime fans <br>alrighty then</br></br></br>  <br>If you'd stop haranging me about shit you dont like to see maybe we could have actual discussion instead of your opinion on what YOU think can be posted in these threads</br>  <br>Good fanworks, though increasingly rare these days, can adjust the characters but maintain somewhat of a resemblance to their actual personality. Too often fans kind of create these alternate personas in their minds that bare no traits of the original.</br>  <br>I'm telling you that if you want to discuss gayshit then there's a board for it, that's it.</br>  <br>Holy shit its a shounen. SHOUNEN. look it up! Do you look at shounen and just see the words romance novel? There is no fucking romance. How can you not understand this? You want romance? Go read rurouni kenshin or some shit. Hell go read some harem manga i dunno. The vision is so fucking clear in this story yet you gladly throw sand in your own eyes to avoid the truth: NO ONE WANTS TO FUCK IN ONE PIECE. THEY JUST WANT TO GET TO RAFTEL AND BE THE PIRATE KING AND FIND THE TREASURE. Holy fuck.</br>  <br>Bellamy a cute.</br>  <br>That's the worst part, it wouldn't be filler in amny way, over half of them have had a direct impact on the story, and the other half foreshadow future story events.<br><br>Toei is so fucking stupid, Ace was so popular they inserted him into Alabasta filler and Oda handed them a canon Ace side story.</br></br></br>  <br>you say the same damn thing for any pics with tumblr in the filename though<br><br>there have been times where im discussing something completely innocuous and still get told to leave because its 'gay'<br><br>you guys just complain for the sake of it and shouldnt be surprised when you get ignored</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oda has no problem with the fans doing what they wish, he accepts he accidentally attracted a peripheral audience but says he won't ever consider their input on his story for teenage boys.</br>  <br> It isnt actually against the rules to speculate on things in the story that can or may happen in the future. No matter how convoluted you find it </br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Actually I think Sanji and Franky might definitely want to fuck m8. Uh but not each other. And not like dudes either.</br>  <br>i dont remember ussop having such long arms</br>  <br> there's nothing gay to discuss in OP canon <br><br>okay</br></br></br>  <br>this artist has a thing for long arms it seems<br>didnt really notice until you pointed it out though</br></br>  <br> can <br> may <br><br>Said it yourself, its not against the rules to speak of what can and may happen.<br><br>But it wont. Im sorry. I really am. It sucks really bad and im so sorry. But none of this fujoshit, or straight shit is gonna happen. Ever. Its gonna be a great story with literally zero romance except a "man's romance" which refers to Adventure, not a relationship or sexuality. And im so sorry for you. But that means youre speaking of things unrelated, which is against the rules. So please.<br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you say the same damn thing for any pics with tumblr in the filename though <br>I'm I (or any anon) supposed to be nice from someone who comes from there?<br><br> im discussing something completely innocuous and still get told to leave because its 'gay' <br>People get's their files deleted on /e/ when there's penetration or dicks in general, because there's a boards for it called /h/, why would people not complain when you like gayshit, come from tumblr, implied fujoshit, when you are supposed to keep that shit away?<br><br> you guys just complain for the sake of it <br>We don't call your shit and then this will be a SnK thread.<br><br> and shouldnt be surprised when you get ignored <br>I'm surprised you haven't left yet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It isnt actually against the rules to speculate on things in the story that can or may happen in the future.  <br><br>nothing about your post negates mine</br></br></br>  <br> I'm I <br>Wanted too write "Am I"</br></br>  <br> can <br> may <br><br>Reality:<br> won't <br> ever <br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm I (or any anon) supposed to be nice from someone who comes from there? <br><br>maybe stop believing in every boogeyman 4chan creates?<br><br> People get's their files deleted on /e/ <br><br>nothing I ever post gets deleted for being in the wrong place.

Are you even a fan? If you were you'd know there isnt a possibilty for any type of relationship gay or straight, because thats not what the story is about or has to do with. How dense are you? Are you just fighting reality?</br>  So, was Kyros, like, a secret the entire time? Because Oda did not implement his character into the original Dressrosa flashback.<br><br>I mean, we see the king, we see the king talking to Tank, but Kyros is nowhere to be found.<br><br>Do we just chop it up to Kyros being a toy and being erased from the flasbhack?<br><br>This arc was pretty good, but it seems like things were just strewn in.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you put that goalpost back RIGHT now</br>  <br> Kenshin is also a shonen you autistic piece of shit, fuck onepiecefags are the most cancerous motherfuckers in existence. I hope you get raped and burned alive with lighter fluid by a bunch of niggers.<br><br> Now broaden your fucking horizons and start reading some actually good series or fuck off of /a/ you casual scum.<br><br> P.S. being a faggot or a woman should be a bannable offense.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fine. How does luffy being a bottom get him to raftel? How does rayleigh being a creepy pedophile explain rogers past? How about nami sucking cock? Does that explain the florian triangle? Law fucking Bepo? Is that the secret to the five moons in the story?....wait... NO!? NONE OF IT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE PLOT!? HOLY SHIT!!! MAYBE WE SHOULD STOP POSTING FANART LIKE RETARDS!!! OH MAN!!! Never would have thought of it..</br>  <br>Never mind, I'm stupid.<br>I forgot that Kyros went and married Scarlet and left the kingdom.<br><br>Fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Suggest one better you fat fuck and maybe i wouldnt have to be in this shit thread. Calling the kettle black you mongaloid.</br>  <br>I mean you can jump to extremes if you want<br>you can not like ship talk<br><br>but it doesn't mean One Piece discussion is plot only.

When the characters are represented properly compared to their personalities in the story. You posted ZORO.... Hugging....

I'll wait</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  choosing OPM out of all the series i've mention <br>  not reading oyasumi punpun because of the name <br><br> Yes you are pretty fucking autistic actually, you could at least give it a chance instead of simply dismissing it because of the name you stupid nigger you might even find yourself enjoying it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>because he doesn't know where it is, dipshit.<br><br>and doordoor fruit obviously has limits in the distance it covers, which is why Blueno had to ride the train to Enies Lobby otherwise the CP9 would have just teleported instead.</br></br></br>  <br>Fred Phelps please go and stay go.

Fucking day of the rope when?</br></br></br>  <br> Defending Fred Phelps <br> Fucking day of the rope when? <br>What are you on? No, seriously.</br></br></br>  <br> throwing a fit because someone posts fanart <br> shit up the thread for two hours <br><br>you ARE kind of garbage, anon</br></br></br></br>  Welp I think we all know what it's time to do.  <br>  implying i'm the autist that was shitting up the thread  <br><br> Actually no i was simply pissed off at the whiny faggot saying someone is literally Fred Phelps for complaining about gay fanart.<br><br><br> <br> I never defended Fred Phelps you stupid fucking faggot are you literally incapable of basic reading comprehension?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I just found out Vivi has the same blood type as Luffy, yet another parallel between her and Jinbe, I'm not so sure he will join.  <br> Actually no i was simply pissed off at the whiny faggot saying someone is literally Fred Phelps for complaining about gay fanart. <br>Fred Phelps is that kind of person, "IN THE NAME OF OUR GOD LETS GO BITCH ABOUT THIS ON 4CHAN.", not that the WBC would stand a chance here of course.<br><br> I never defended Fred Phelps you stupid fucking faggot are you literally incapable of basic reading comprehension? <br><br>I looked over what you said, and I realized I'm an utter toolshed, sorry about earlier.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Ill shit on anything when someone insults me for having a favorite manga, then when i ask for something better all i get is a list straight from edgelord-r-us and babbys first manga you fucktard. <br><br> It's not my fault that your favorite manga is casual normalfag shit even worse than the series i have just mentioned, with the exception of toriko maybe.</br></br></br>  <br>Their homes both need them for stability.</br>  <br>FI doesn't need stability now that it's under Luffys control.</br>  Just finished the episode where Kyros becomes human and lops of Doffys head<br><br>Fuck, I've re read the previous chapter 12 times now.<br><br>This is so exciting</br></br></br></br>  <br>it's nice to see someone enjoying this arc</br>  <br><br>I love this arc too. I've reread the last 20 chapters in a row about five times now. It's just so good when read all at once.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I kinda want Oda to do more Arc finales like Dressrosa, Alabasta, and Sky Island.<br><br>Where Luffy is either in the sky or the villain is in the sky for all to see.</br></br></br>  <br> Where Luffy is either in the sky or the villain is in the sky for all to see them as they really are. <br>ftfy</br></br>  <br>Please, don't post the rest. Artwork is seriosuly disturbing even for fujo standards.</br>  <br>dude I posted that 2 hours ago<br><br>I was going to post the set, i'd have done so already</br></br></br>   binge read one piece last week <br> try to watch the latest anime episode <br> that sound mixing quality <br> that static image battle scene <br>Okay, /a/. Now I understand why you don't watch this anymore and stick to the source material.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Enel pls go</br>  If you look at the last page of 791 it looks like Kyros is crying on Luffys face, which is funny because Rebecca is crying on his face, and Kyros and Rebecca are father and daughter.<br><br>Was this intentional?</br></br>  <br> when you realize luffy could take out all of cp9 in minutes at this point <br>More like CPjobber</br></br>  <br>Ahh the old timeskip bias strikes again. re-read anon and you'll see plenty of it.</br>  <br>One Piece anime is good literally at random points.<br><br>http://sakuga.yshi.org/post/show/15<wbr>877/animated-effects-explosions-fig<wbr>hting-fire-one_piec</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Toei is pretty much trash because they don't care about their fanbase, they only want money. But at least they aren't as bad as Togashi and are at least giving us SOMETHING.</br>  You can tell when they actually try with the animation when Luffy's attacks move all slippery like actual rubber<br><br>http://sakuga.yshi.org/data/b92a35a<wbr>a705db22076607b160b92d1f9.mp4</wbr></br></br>  <br>Honestly I still thought that was animated like garbage, its just like the Dragon Ball Z movies at the moment where the camera just moves all over the fucking place and makes a huge mess</br>  <br>So, ke knew how to get a fruit that already eaten ? just like BB?</br>  <br> newfag is the strongest </br>  <br>How is that animated like garbage? You can actually tell the characters are physically moving.<br><br>Do you know how rare that is for Toei's fight scenes?</br></br></br>  <br>same</br>  <br> Do you know how rare that is for Toei's fight scenes? <br><br>But that's exactly it, that's the best they can do and it's still crap. It could be way better but it depends on their director at the time since they rotate them around so much.</br></br></br>  <br> Luffy's attacks move all slippery like actual rubber <br><br>It's funny because Doffy's attacks are doing the same in this webm.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This is exactly the least quality I'm expecting, but I guess keeping distance between the manga is more important to the studio.<br>Like seriously, instead of burning money on fillers, they should have postpone airing and use said budget to make more decent effects. I wouldn't mind that.<br><br><br>Ooh, Anon. You made me chuckle.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Like seriously, instead of burning money on fillers <br>Funny thing is they don't do that anymore</br></br>  <br>Oh come on, what progress does 699 actually make to the story? Just to immobilise Luffy so Doffy can do flashback. I don't think that should require 20 minutes. I don't mean fillers that went outside the source material, but anything that prolong the episode for no other reason but to keep the anime from lapping the manga in general.</br>  <br>yeah that's obviously not how it goes anon.</br>  Holy fuck would you tumblr fags fuck off back to your cesspool please?  <br>oh god, the truth makes me laugh hard sometimes</br>  <br>you're right he obviously was in fucking panic that time</br>  <br>Just report them and move on</br>  <br>you can fuck yourself m8</br>  <br>what power does shanks have for that matter</br>  <br>I think people wouldn't argue about logic if Oda didn't justify Luffys protection and only way to win against Enel with pseudo logic.</br>  <br>the power to stop wars.</br>  <br>Shanks doesnt have a DF ability <br><br>He's either just that badass or he rubbed himself all over the One Piece when he made it to Raftel with Roger<br><br>I think Dragon has something similar</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> arguing pseudo logic in a shonen <br><br>that's worse though. Once you realize Oda is bullshitting a little bit, that's the point where you let it go</br></br></br>  <br>He might have swordsmanship skills on par with Mihawk and then some shit on top of that to elevate him from mere "badass pirate tier" to Yonko tier. I'm one of those people that hope he got a nice DF after he saved Luffy but then again it may be just insane CoC Haki that makes him so fearsome, who knows.</br>  <br>The power to loose arms against fodder sea monsters.</br>  <br>right, mabye we'll never see shanks crew fight but im not sure how without devil fruits there fighting style is usually non df users are swordsman or have some weird fighting technique i just couldn't imagine his crew doing that, yassop's supposed to be extremely strong but as a sniper i cant see him being that great</br>  <br>didn't he lose his arm to impact ruffy to give him the drive to be great or something?</br>  <br>I thought there was a rumour long ago that says Dragon's ability has something to do with wind.</br>  <br>Yasopp has probably insane CoA and CoO feats seeing that Usopp slowly goes down that way too. Some of Shanks Crew surely have DFs and I think we will see some in action too but just not that much in spotlight as the other Yonko. The most common theory is that Blackbeards crew fucks them up some time later in the story but it's merely speculation this early</br>  <br> rumour <br><br>well there are plenty of those going around. I wouldn't put much stock into them</br></br></br>  <br>that sounds pretty likely but it would be stupid as fuck, they hyped shanks up so much if i dont get to see one serious fight with him i will be pissed</br>  <br>yeah you may lay it out that way but it still seems very anticlimatic since we know he's literally one of the four strongest pirates in the whole god damn world<br><br><br>it's pretty much a fact that it has to do with wind, where it originates from is the other thing though. Some say it's one of the acient weapons, others say it's a dragon or a weather DF.</br></br></br></br>  <br>idk im pretty sure oda changes the feel of shit as he goes like with haki</br>  <br>If Shanks is a DF user, it will be awesome if it's gravity.</br>  Just who is this fucker and why is he so much  trouble?
