[ YUGO A BUMBLEFUCK<br><br> goddamn fucking zefras </br></br>  R-Ruri?  Reposting<br><br>Reiji's accomplishments so far:<br> Making bootlegs <br> Brainwashing his subordinates <br> Stealing Yuto's duel disk <br> Letting Yuto die <br> Pissing off Shun with Heartland field and joking about it <br> Muh Serena <br> Getting Mitchie and Teppei killed with penalty <br> Creating propaganda to get child soldiers <br> KEEPING PENALTY WHEN GOING TO SYNCHRO </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuuto's death and the fact that Ruri will never see him again breaks my heart.<br>I wonder how Shun will break the news to her in their eventual reunion</br></br>  <br> I wonder how Shun will break the news to her in their eventual reunion <br><br><br> Oh by the way, that annoying guy who used to stalk you is kinda dead. Not sure on the details. </br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Ruri and Yuuto weren't head over heels for each other <br>Yuri/Serena is the only exception to the Yuu/Ruri rule</br></br>  <br>But he also gave Yuya his first real defeat that broke Yuya's EGAO. While Yuya lost to Yuzu before, that was when Yuya didn't know what the Pendulums did and the duel itself had no actual consequence or impact. It was just something that was irrelevant in the long run.<br><br>Even the Sora vs Shun rematch, while Shun never seemed to care he was almost carded before he could save Ruri, was still relevant. It caused Serena to save Shun and resulted in Serena learning more about the Heartland invasion and herself joining the Lancers.<br><br>Whereas when Yuya got BTFO by Reiji, it had a far greater impact since Yuya was forced into the Lancers, suffered his first real loss, and it was Reiji's third duel across 50 episodes.<br><br>Though Reiji is quite possibly the WORST STRATEGIST EVER when it came to the Lancers. Then again, Reiji is the guy who thought he could recruit Sora into the Lancers (see episode 26, and less so in episode 35) despite Reiji knowing he is from Academia. Sora being from Academia while not being a counterpart of Yuya/Yuzu basically solidified he wasn't joining the Lancers.<br><br>TL;DR: Yuya vs Reiji rematch was a good duel, and Reiji is dumb for trying to recruit a kid drunk on Fusion Dimension nationalism to fight against the Fusion Dimension.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuto maybe. Ruri probably only hung out with him because he had no other friends except for Shun and her.</br>   Zefras <br>I'd really rather you be quiet.</br>  <br>Reiji is no better than Leo with how he operates, I hope he'll be called out on it.</br>  <br>I swear he has some bullshit card that'll activate when he has to pay the 2000LP intrusion penalty.</br>  <br> Rewatchng episode 26 to see what you're talking about <br>sweet jesus look at that ass.</br></br>  <br>Yuri noticing how similar Reiji and Leo are would make sense considering Yuri is Leo's strongest subordinate. What if Yuri tries to get Reira on his side similarly to how Noa ended up using Mokuba as leverage over Kaiba? Though that all depends on Reira's opinion of his father, as well as whether Yuri is forbidden from carding Reira due to Reira being Leo's pure child.<br><br>Reiji will be called out on his shit, similarly to when Tron basically called Kaito a hypocrite who enjoyed taking people's souls. Its just a matter of who will get to call Reiji out. My main guesses are Yuya, Shun, Serena, or Yuri.</br></br></br>  <br>Does LP intrusion penalty count as effect damage or what?</br>  YAMEROOOOO  <br>The penalty at least has the cool factor</br>  <br>Not sure, to be honest. Common sense would dictate it's a payment, but "penalty" usually carries a posteriority, which isn't usually payment. But the Covenants are contracts yet they deal damage even though payments would make more thematic sense.<br><br><br>It'd be hilarious if it's considered damage and he uses it to SS Leonidas and go back to 4000LP the moment he enters a duel. But if so, Dennis could also abuse it with that flame eater.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That only applies to japanese electric batman.</br>  <br> This was back when Yuzu wasn't in Synchro Dimension and able to cheer Yuya on. <br> This was back when Sora wasn't an obviously evil Academia scumbag and actually helped Yuzu get good. <br> This was back when best dad had his daughter by his side and wasn't suffering ZETSUBOU from being told that his daughter was trapped in another dimension. <br> This was back when best mom had not gone full retard with her EGAO filler bullshit in episodes 52-53. <br> This was back when the three useless kids served as the useless characters. <br><br>To think there was a time when Yuya was actually happy and not an annoying Yuzufag, Yuzu was ARC-V's best girl because Serena didn't exist yet, and Sora was just a pure boy who taught Yuzu how to Fusion even though most of us expected him to be evil.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was something of a simpler time, back when the animation was terrible and the cards were worse.</br>  <br> To think there was a time when Yuya was actually happy and not an annoying Yuzufag <br><br>Reminds me of Judai being a Johanfag<br>in season 3. Although next episode Yuzu.wav will be put aside, and will be all about 'Protect Tau-sans Ideal'</br></br></br></br>  I love how everyone has their weird headcanons with Arc-V like Yuto was friendless or Ruri liked watching birds which explains Shun's deck.  <br> Yuzu.wav being put aside <br>More like the writers are remembering he has other issues than that The Yuzu.wav isn't stopping until Yuzu is back in Yuya's arms.</br></br>  <br>My favorite is Sawatari being Serena's snack butler.</br>  <br>Well both Shun and Ruri has bird names so it makes sense they like them.</br>  <br>Feel sorry for him, by far the most yugioh protagonist with psychological problems   Although that's how I like my MC's to be  </br>  <br>It was commonly accepted that the Johanfag Judai was best Judai</br>  <br>Caring for the main girl<br> Not best </br></br>  When the fuck did this come out?<br><br>WANTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT</br></br>  <br>I actually don't mind Yuya sacrificing many things for the sake of Yuzu. Probably the compensation for too much homo in the past series</br>  <br>Wanting to protect your waifu and forsaking everything in the world to protect her are different. <br><br>I'm all for him trying to save or protect her, but he gives no fucks about anything else, Reiji and Crow both have told him to put a lid on it for now and he's still just MUH SADNESS, MUH YUZU!!<br><br>It took Jack calling his entertainment fucking garbage to snap him out of him for a little bit. Thank you based Kingu, his entertainment is garbage compared to yours.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>NEVER<br>EVER<br>Tewart won't let it get released in the TCG, because he's got stupid ideas about iconic designs.</br></br></br>  <br>It's summer, go read a book or something.</br>  <br>so it's basically this faggot's fault?</br>  In hometown. Reading old Yugioh manga. Apparently on Duelist Kingom deck size limit was maximum of 40.  <br>Tewart and the head judge iare everything wrong with the TCG actually, everything.</br>  <br>Fuck you, gimme the fucking list.<br><br><br>Can't we just hire some assassins or something?</br></br></br></br>  <br>spoiler that faggot</br>  <br>Kojima probably already has against everyone at Konami, I wouldn't worry about it.</br>  <br>Thank you based kojima</br>  I want to card this fucking xyz scum.  <br>Yuyas inheriting it as well<br> Tfw Yuzus butt is less squeezable than her husbandos </br></br>  <br>I love hungry Serena in general. I like to imagine she was pouting in prison because the food sucked</br>  <br>I think we all like to imagine that Anon. She probably just watched the Food Network on her fancy prison TV.</br>      <br>So, how are they suppose they abuse that in DK era?</br>  <br><br> we want the bioshock audience </br></br>  <br> This tomato hate </br>  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  when the fuck will Yuto's laundry get printed?  <br>I like the Tomato, he just needs to chill out.</br>  Arc V is the first series that has both best boys AND best girls, wich is kind of refreshing after all the previous series being boys club and the girls generally being fanservice devices (especially in ZeXal). Sure, Aki was nice to look at AND she had a personality but that kind of went south after the dark signer arc. Does anyone know if Yoshida is returning to the Yugioh anime or are we safe?  I found Ruris. A village of them!  <br> you will never live in a village full of Ruris </br>  <br>Shun.... you are getting me really worried.</br>  Reminder that Yugi's deck will be the Gaia, Black Luster Solider and Silent archetype support with Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl will be savedfor the duel against the villain character.  <br> Silent archetype support <br>We all know that it won't happen.  ;_: </br></br>  <br>Reminder that Kaiba is the main character of the movie and he has knee guards.</br>  <br>The people who saw the actual trailer keep saying they saw Silent Magician and Silent Swordsman in their manga looks.</br>  <br> annoying Yuzufag <br>I hadn't found his Yuzufaggotry to be annoying in the slightest, honestly. It's super refreshing, you'd never expect a Yu-Gi-Oh! MC to be this concerned over a girl (Yugi cared a lot about Anzu's safety, but not to the point of screaming her name to end the episode) and it's not a one-time thing, it is just yet another problem that Yuya continuously grapples with.<br><br>It's also nice that the -faggotry is reciprocated for once, you know?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is the high level Silent Magician a celibate cake past her expiration date. Ultimately feeling jaded from what she have missed?</br>  <br>A Christmas Cake so old she was a Halloween Cake of the next year.</br>  <br> Ruritania <br>How do I move there?</br></br>  <br> An English gentleman on holiday, who fortuitously resembles the monarch, is persuaded to act as his political decoy in an attempt to save the situation <br><br>Do you look English? Do you resemble a monarch? Are you at all politically aware?</br></br></br>  <br> Do you resemble a monarch? <br>What do you think?</br></br>  <br>It'll be good if what you wanted is a gigantic amazonian Ruri.</br>  Holy crap, I'm dense. Yugi's deck is Warriors and Mages. Too bad there is no such archetype that exists.  <br>You're more of a Funky Comedian, I'd say</br>  <br> Yugi's deck is Warriors and Mages <br>Little Yugis deck was more rock and machine, with a couple spellcaster and warrior bosses</br></br>  <br>But Yugi's deck is magnets?</br>  <br>He mostly had Warriors, Spellcasters, Fiends Machine and Rock and a couple of oddballs here and there</br>  <br> No Marshmallon </br>  <br> no DMG </br>  <br>These monsters all like like shit from a generic RPG game. The Warrior and the mage look main character=ish while the marsh marshmellow looks like a generic level 1 enemy with the dragon and golem looking like dungon bosses. I'd love it if Kaz used new versions of them</br>  <br><br>EVERY<br>SINGLE<br>TIME<br>You post a deck list, someone WILL tell you what's wrong with your deck list.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dark Magician Girl is only magnetic in her...personality.</br>  I'm from the future<br>Yugo duels Dennis and wins, Dennis accidentally reveals he is a spy to Yugo because pawn of fusion<br>Crow beats Gongenzaka<br>Sawatari ties with Yuzu<br>Shinji beats Ninjabro barely<br>Reira duels ENJOY</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No DMG is fine since this seems to be based on Ceremonial duel deck and Yami had that. But Marshmallon is one of Yugis few decent cards</br>  Jack's new cards are just so incredibly good.  <br>Oh, neat, you can actually see the fucked up right horn on Scar right.</br>  <br> deck from duel arena <br><br> DMG <br> in Yugi's deck </br></br></br></br>  What's the point of Shinji? He hasn't done anything other than bringing junk food to the kids and being Crow's useless friend.  <br> in Yugi's deck <br><br>Unless Yugi retired from dueling in those 10 years before GX starts Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl are still in his deck. Then again, he may of just stopped competing in national tournments and just uses a deck of his own for Eago duels every once and a while like Yusei does after 5D's and put the one he and Atem built together on world tour.</br></br></br>  <br>They've foreshadowed his upcoming rebellion in multiple episodes now anon, his episode is in 2 weeks</br>  <br>What old shit will they shill next after Jack/Crow becomes irrelevant in ARC-V?</br>  <br>Kotori.</br>  <br>Hard to say until we really establish what he's about in his duel. He could function as a more extreme revolutionary to force Crow to balance his current hatred of Tops to eventually work towards peace</br>  <br>Jean-Michel please, you are not even part of the Council.</br>  <br>Best girl only gets fresher with age</br>  <br><br><br>I still like Gadgets the most.</br></br></br>  <br>Cyber Dragons and Red-Eyes</br>  <br> that little peek <br><br>Huh, didn't expect that.<br><br>Too bad Yuma's so incredibly gay to the point that the next series' MC had to be almost obsessively straight, huh?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ojamas, Armed Dragon and WVXYZ</br>  Crimson Dragon appears in Arc-v<br>Yuya, Yugo, Crow, Jack, and Shinji become Signers later on in the Synchro arc</br>  <br>Nice fanfic</br>  How long until I can hear Reira's boku no turn again?  When is the manzai?  <br>At least a month.</br>  <br>I wonder what crazy hairstyle he is hidding under that cap.</br>  <br>Spade inspired no doubt to go with the suits theme of his family.</br>  <br>What is Reiji's symbol ?</br>  <br>It's a Jump promo.

Is he relevant?</br>  <br>That nigga ran three different decks I think. Or he combined them all together and it just magically worked...sometimes.</br>  <br>I'd like it if he voices someone outwardly antagonistic but is actually kind-hearted in the inside.<br><br>Also not pining after a girl who's clearly into someone else.<br><br>And hates grapes.</br></br></br></br></br>  You know, I was wondering for a while now, Who actually owns the fusion card Black Skull Dragon, Yugi or Joey?  <br>None they both magically make it</br>  <br> Implying Duelist Kingdom fusions actually existed in card form </br>  <br>Actually, 7 with the manga.<br>Chtonian, VWXYZ, Armed Dragon, Ojama, Meca-Insect, Light warriors and Dragon</br></br>  <br>With Asuka in that outfit it's no wonder Manjoume's dragon is roaring out bright red.</br>  All of this Black Luster Solider support and envoy of the beginning is still a better option. Why? If the next set has cards for Magician of Black Chaos I'm gonna run a muck with a leaf blower.  <br>And not one of them are actually playable. Sad.</br>  <br> a muck <br>Is amok you dumb nigger.</br></br>  <br>Shut up. I know what it is, I just wanted to be unique instead of being another one of the sheeple.</br>    HOLY FUCKING SHIT.

For example the Djinn lock and the Clownblade engine liked to go into this first turn and dump Djinn or Clown from deck to set up plays. My Melodious deck will miss this card for ease of setting up the grave.

Thinking of giving this one a shot.  <br><br>It's basically 5D's 2.0<br>Especially starting with episode 64. Arc-V episode 64 is literally 5D's episode 1</br></br></br>  <br>Good.</br>  <br>Better than most of the series, save season 1 5D's and maybe DM if you think highly of DM</br>  <br>Good. Surprisingly less filler and no restriction on summons makes for nice duels.<br>Fun characters.<br>Watch up to episode 7.<br>If not hooked by then, maybe not for you</br></br></br></br>  So /a/rc-v, if you were shitty self-inserts in this show, what would the summoning chant for your ace be?  <br>Good, be prepared for relationship drama/trauma though</br>    <br> not being the odd guy who never chants </br>  <br><br><br>Good, I watched a bit of Zexal and found it dull, mainly the main characters.

You're in for a ride next episode.</br></br>  <br>LIKE I SAID, KIDS ARE CRUEL  JACK.  AND I'M VERY IN TOUCH WITH MY INNER CHILD!</br>  <br>Probably the second deck listed would be best, but Arc-V characters don't have all their cards out yet, so for the Arc-V ones the last one listed would be best.</br>  <br>WARRIOR OF RIGHTEOUSNESS<br>ITS TIME TO RISE TO THE SKIES AND BURN AWAY ALL THAT IS UNHOLY<br>FUUGO SHOKAN<br>ITS TIME FOR JUSTICE<br><br>ELEMENTAL HERO NOVA MASTER</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!<br>I want to tell you a story.

ODD-EYES REBELLION DRAGON!</br></br>  <br>for everyone interested, I just posted decks for those signed up for the animu tourney<br>http://challonge.com/tomo10<br>make sure to check it out and look for your deck!<br><br>there's also still a few slots available, and a couple days to sign up and tweak your decks</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ugly as fuck</br>  <br/>  <br>Fuck off Tomo, no one gives a shit.</br>  <br>Fam what has your brother been doing to you and why are you so sad all the time b</br>  <br>mhm.</br>  <br>Not my brother, fam, my mommy. Now that Daddy's running that Academia place, Mommy gets... lonely sometimes.</br>  <br>I see. Should I just wait until the anime finishes in a year or so and then build a deck then?

Also the unbanning of Synchro Trish means that a reprint of it will happen in the near future since it only came out in HA04 and DT here, probably in the next gold series.</br>  <br>I KNOW RIGHT</br>  <br>I fucking hate chunni's especially the bad ones.</br>  <br>Wait, doesn't the manga manjoume run a Dragon deck whose ace is Light and Darkness Dragon?</br>  <br>More interaction between Tsukikage and Reira when?</br>  <br>I play IgKnight, it's too much of a Glass Cannon and still has slight issues with Qlis and Shaddolls, it especially has issues with TellarKnights. <br><br>If anything gets a large boost thanks to this it's RR.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Dark End and Light End were tribute monsters but they got made into Synchros IRL.</br>  If you look too much into how serious the syncro monarchy is taking dueling it kinda becomes sick. It's borderline roman gladiators shit with how they use them as slaves for their shows and treat them well only if they win. Also acting like dense retards in regards to actual academy threats. Syncro dimensions needs to be cleansed.  <br>With theese two level 4 monsters being treated as level 7, I construct the overlay network!<br>Oh leader of the mythical planes<br>Descend from the sky and let your engines roar<br>Let no sacrifices be in vain<br>XYZ SHOUKAN<br>Mecha Phantom Beast Dracossack</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>synch trish<br>summon k?<br>eff trish<br>response?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shoot forth with your burning shots. <br>And drive into hell with burning fury. <br>Witness their glorious sacrifice. <br>IGNAITO BURSTO DRIIIVER<br>PENDULUM SHOKAN<br>IgKnight Avenger<br>PENDULUM YUGO SHOKAN<br>First of the Dragons</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is everyone in syncro dimension such annoying faggots? Be it elitist pretentious aristocrats or even the filthy common peasants. And let's not even get started on that king asshole. <br>Also are they seriously going to go in the direction of Yuuya was too selfish and not entertaining enough and that's why he lost the duel AGAIN? Wasn't this shit used like 4 times already? Literally nothing changes in between.</br>  <br> And let's not even get started on that king asshole.  <br>Salty af</br></br>  <br>Because that's how New Domino City was in 5Ds. Also Yuya lost because he's too focused on his own ideals of Entertainment, that's why he is wrong. Synchro does not work the same way Standard does as far as Entertainment goes. Jack was right. <br><br>That and Yuya is gonna get everyone carded because of Entertainment.wav and Yuzu.wav.</br></br></br>  <br> Mammoth <br> Dinosaur <br>Triggered.</br></br></br>  <br>But you can say the same about Jack as well.<br>Who even fucking judges the entertainment values anyway. People fucking see three new summoning methods + bullshit action cards and nobody calls cheats and just act mildly surprised. King doesn't even bat an eyelid at all.<br><br>And yes, Yuuya's constant talk about entertainment is really fucking annoying because he seems to always go back to square one which is muh Yuzu and never learn anything.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jack determines the entertainment because he's the King of Games, simple as that. That's why people were horrified that it looked like he was going to lose. Nobody gives two shits about anything but Jack and D-Wheels.</br>  <br> Also Yuya lost because he's too focused on his own ideals of Entertainment, that's why he is wrong <br><br>but he lost because Jack beat him? what the fuck does entertainment have to do with it</br></br></br>  Hey, give me some good dueling music for DN!  <br>Duel of Rebellion / Yuto's Passionate Soul<br>Wavering Feelings<br>The Evolving Falcon</br></br></br>  <br>fuck op spoiler that shit, im getting goosebumps looking at his face</br>  <br>He did not entertain the audience in any way, he just said "MY ENTERTAINMENT DUELING WILL WIN!" and then proceeded to get his ass ripped apart by Jack and did not hype the audience up in any way.</br>    <br> He did not entertain the audience in any way <br>They got really hype for his fusion combo wombo</br></br>  It has been one month since the last time anyone called Yuto 'Edgeplant'  <br>This. It was reflected perfectly when Yuya first came to Synchro dimension. When he tried to use his entertainment duel, none of them actually entertained, even Reira think that was pretty cringey.<br><br> Personally though, Yusei's duel really entertaining for me. </br></br></br>  <br>They was more hype at a new summoning method than it was Yuya or his specialized dueling. Hell Sawatari could have fucking fusion summoned and they'd have been hype.</br>  <br>OH GREAT DRAGON OF A TWISTED DIMENSION<br>I PAY NO HEED TO YOU BEING ACTUALLY A PARROT<br>BREAK FREE FROM YOUR LOONEY CHAINS<br>ACCEPT THE SACRIFICE I OFFER FOR YOUR GAINS!<br><br>ADVANCED SUMMON<br><br>PARROT DRAGON!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> entire dimension using the most retarded way imaginable to duel <br><br>No wonder they have shit taste</br></br></br>  Here is something to fill if you're bored.  <br>Why the fuck did i read this in Dota2's Warlock voice?</br>  <br>Going back to the archives is really fun</br>  <br>Shame, it was such a great nickname, all the subsequent attempts at fruit nicknaming didnt even come close</br>  <br>Nice draw, close but not enough<br>See, i believe in the heart of the cards, draw!</br></br>  <br>Well, Purple Kotori and Egaoman is funnier</br>  <br>People forget Jack was an antagonist for the entire fortune cup arc of 5D's. Dude is straight up a selfish asshole with an entitlement complex. He only gets better because Yusei rekts the shit out of him in front of the crowd and hey what do you know, no one gives a shit about Jack Atlas anymore because he lost once. Outside of a few die hards like Carly and that one kid, the general public moved on to the new King Yusei who proved that even Satellite scum can duel like the people of New Domino City (although his real intention was just to get Stardust, he didn't give shit about rich snobville until Dark Signers showed up.)</br>  <br>Tomato and Citrus have stayed pretty consistent.</br>  <br>Wave the Flag of Rebellion and Reiji's Theme are good too.</br>  <br>starting with mine</br>  <br>I don't think it's the same Jack though. It's an alternative universe or some shit. But still, the way he acts indicates he's still the most selfish asshole there is and he has the balls to somehow talk about someone else being selfish. Hell the whole point of the exhibition duel is to show off so everyone can jerk off to his majesty.</br>  <br>this seems like more of a dng thing.</br>  Vector is so based jesus christ    <br> Tomato <br> Citrust <br> Banana Hammock <br> Dragon Fruit/Plum  <br> Crude and Strong <br><br>All the fruits and ruris still have their names, Serena and Yuri a little less so.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Yeah I never got that last comment to Yuya about self-satisfaction. He's the most self-centered person of all 5D's and probably all of the Synchro Dimension. This Jack not being the one from 5D's can only mean he'll stay being a dickbag unless Yuya fills in for Yusei and gives him development.</br>  <br>there's a way better template than this out there<br><br>I used to have it but I can't find it anywhere</br></br></br>  <br>I tried going really far back once, to the very first threads after Arc-V was announced, and this one anon called Synchro dimension really damn early.</br>  I don't see why people think there are only 4 dimensions.<br> Arc-V <br> V=5 <br> FIVE </br></br></br>   tfw Kingu retained dickishness and bashed on Yuya's entermate dueling <br><br>Kingu still got it FUCK YEAH!</br></br>  <br>The 5th dimension will be the result of fusing the 4 dimensions.</br>  <br> Yugioh 5Ds <br> 5=5 <br> There were 6 dragon </br></br></br>  <br>It's the Pendulum dimension son.</br>  <br> inb4 the fifth element comes to be by fusing a summoning methods </br>  <br>Sinister eye that sees all.

That fucking sucks. I don't really pay much attention to YGO anymore, kinda getting back into it now b/c of the movie, but I have the original JUMP version of the card back when it was still forbidden.</br>  Did Sakurasou bomb? Whenever I look for pictures of specific characters there's way less than there are of other series, and the boorus are also way understocked with stuff from it.  <br>It is like that for a lot of shows. Sometimes even popular shows have barely any fan-art.</br>  Awful Korean propaganda.  Did Sorata get autismo-chan prego?  <br> Did Sakurasou bomb? <br><br>It was just shit. Plain and simple</br></br></br>  <br>Yes they put a Korean dish in around episode 6 and the nips went apeshit. It never recovered and the entire second cour was a clusterfuck.</br>  <br>There's always that one person who honestly hates good shows.</br>  <br> everything up to and including the Christmas episode <br>Really liked it and actually found myself becoming invested in the characters<br><br> everything after the Xmas episode <br>Utter shit. I've never seen a show fall from grace to drastically.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kek really?</br>  Rinnosuke best girl.  <br>I felt it was near the end that Sakurasou got good. When it committed 100% to be about something instead of being another show about fooling around in high school.</br>  <br>Who keeps making these threads?</br>  <br>What the fuck are you talking about, anon? The ending was the archetypal open-ended rom-com adaption "conclusion" that was melodramatic and generic as fuck.</br>  <br>Mmm. But it's a show about growing up, right? And Jin has to break it down to his girl (name that I don't remember) that being adults is about more than being all lovey dovey, and you cannot live just from your loved one's love.<br>And Sorata gets his plants fucked to shit, he doesn't give up, and his last project goes well because of that experience. And he finally puts his passion to something of use like he wanted at the end of the series. I think I remember autismo girl learning something about human relations too, but I'm not sure.<br><br>Like... the romance plot is kinda sidelined, but the characters do grow up a lot during the show.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Sakurasou did around 3k or so, so it probably broke even or was close to it.<br><br>Shame about the second half. The first half was genuinely my AotS for that Fall, then it just went downhill so hard.</br></br></br>  <br> Like... the romance plot is kinda sidelined, but the characters do grow up a lot during the show. <br>I'm not denying that, but you can't just build up the romance element to ridiculous levels for the entire first 3 quarters of the series and then just sideline it for the finale. <br><br>Don't get me wrong, I like the characters and the way they individually grow/develop. But the ending is barely even an ending. The melodrama was just turned up to 11 and the status quo remained almost the exact same.</br></br></br></br>  <br>As expected of JCuck Staff.</br>  What's this hairstyle called?  <br>Sexy forehead</br>  <br> What's this hairstyle called? <br>"Do I look like a bitch?"</br></br>  "Fuck me like it's the last thing you'll ever do"  <br>Too short.</br>  <br>"shit"</br>  Anal queen   Be me watching attack on titan  <br> When suddenly the intro comes  <br> "Having sex with the bees and the eagles""hot"hot" <br> LolWhut <br> listen to it again  <br> cant unhear it </br></br></br></br></br>  This will be a good thread.  lol xd  Literally cancer    I laughed  <br> KEK KEK KEK <br> LOL LOL LOL <br> KEK KEK KEK </br></br></br>  <br>Why would you do this anon?

I think Miura heard the complaints, he's most likely going to wrap up the boat ride.</br></br></br>   Waiting to get off the boat for years <br> Hell yeah, seems we're finally gonna get off this time <br> Been a hell of a long ride, I guess I can finally stop worrying abou... <br>   Realize I completely forgot about Bastard! and HxH <br><br>Hiatus is a blight on humanity.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>working on the same story for 25 years would burn you out, i cant blame him for taking breaks<br><br>and you've seen the detail Miura puts into every page, shit takes time</br></br></br>  <br>I know man, most of my favorite mangaka are the ones that release once in a blue moon so I'm used to it, but sometimes you do look back and think about how many years has it been since the last volume.</br>  <br>Wait he's only 49 ? Thank god, he still has time to finish before dying</br>  <br>inb4 he pulls an Iwata and dies at 55</br>  <br>DELETE THIS</br>  <br>Who dies in japan at 55 ffs ? They have the longest lifespan on earth.   Iwata was too weak </br>  <br><br>iirc, wasn't it 100 pages coz several of the previous chapters were included to refresh readers' memories?<br><br>Anyways, what's more important is we'll be getting A NEW CHAPTER EVERY MONTH.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Too late anon, it is set in stone</br>  <br><br>I recently downloaded a torrent and a page in volume 21 was corrupt and half of it is showing when I converted it to rar.<br><br>I tried redownloading it, but I just ran into the same problem.<br><br>Does anyone have a fix?<br>I think I have old-fashioned rip scans somewhere, but it's really bugging me</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to believe, but I fear he will go on hiatus again after 3 months</br>  <br> 100 pg chapter this month <br> 100 pg chapter this month <br> 100 pg chapter this month <br> 100 pg chapter this month <br> 100 pg chapter this month </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Cancer is a welfare disease.</br>    <br>79 pages of them are the last four chapters, by the way.<br><br> Are all of you /v/irgins? Berserk threads seem to inspire a level of retardation not even seen in Casca. </br></br></br>  Will mermaid McGee join them or stay with her people  <br>You won't be surprised to find that Berserk is basically everything a /v/irgin wants in a manga.<br><br>And I kind of like those threads, certain people don't show up there.<br><br>DON'T DO IT.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You like threads with /v/irgins? But, they're so vulgar.</br>  <br>This may come to a surprise to you, but<br> Most people browse more than one board </br></br>  <br>Cancer fucks up everybody, man. It's just praying to RNG that you don't die.</br>  <br> being a filthy crossboarder </br>   yfw the last page of the cause chapter is Guts looking off into the distance from the ship and seeing a magical looking island.   <br>Who is this seamenu deamonu</br>  <br>Anon, you are the semen demon.</br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br>Kon was too apparently.</br>  What will elf island be like?  <br><br>WILL SHE EVER FIND HER GOLD?</br></br>  <br>Sweden</br>  <br>You mean that's where remnants of Ganeshka's army retreated?</br>  <br> The gold is at Elfhelm <br> Casca is cured as soon as she touches it <br> she thanks Guts for guiding her there and uses it to purchase a massive supernatural army against Griffith and the God Hand <br> Casca still has a tendency to say Auau from time to time <br> anon's face when <br><br><br>Where was it said that Ganishka's army retreated to Elf Island? Didn't Silat and pals break into Griffith's palace?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> COCK GOES HERE.png <br><br>back of the knee maybe</br></br></br>  <br>I'm just conjecturing.</br>  I have Bloodbourne sitting here and haven't played it, does it include much Berserk references like Dark Souls did?<br><br>Should I just pin my hopes on Dragon's Dogma Online for the quintessential Berserk game experience?</br></br>  <br>Heaps<br>The "messengers" are literally the dark spirits that speak to Griffith <br>And the Hunters Mark is the Brand</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'll have to jump on this then, I haven't looked into the game at all it's just sitting there and I have been put off this entire time by it seemingly moving away from swords, shields, armour kinda of medieval combat.</br></br>  <br>Curiously enough the brand didn't occur to me.<br><br>The Tonsil Stone is probably the most obvious for me. I even misread the description the first time I read it.</br></br></br>  I'm just glad we're getting a new chapter. We'll probably be stuck in Falconia for a little while longer but if we get something about Rickert I honestly don't mind it.<br><br> EVEN IF I'D RATHER GET TO ELFHEIM </br></br>  <br>Personally I prefer Dark Souls much much more, Bloodborne is too dark. Literally not thematically, everything is black.<br>But its ok, bit short.</br></br>  yfw when the chapter starts on/near Elfhelm, skipping the remainder of the ride  <br>unlikely. We'll probably get a 'OH SHIT LAND!' chapter where they reach Elfheim and then the one after it when they get ready to pack their shit.  Before they get interrupted by the pirates and stall out for a few chapters. </br>  <br>Oh and one of the bosses is basically Guts' inner beast</br>  <br>Please do not use this website any longer.</br>  <br>I really want to see Farnese molest Guts again, mainly because I'm a sucker for femdom.  How is her name pronounced? All I know is that Isidro sometimes calls her Farnie. <br><br><br>The pirates died alongside the Sea God, remember? They were assimilated shortly after the World Transformation.</br></br></br></br>  <br>nigga don't play with my heart. It's been a while since I've last read that part, but I remember those stupid motherfuckers running away and saying 'we'll meet again!'. Although yes, they were part of the Sea God so it would only make sense for them to be fucking dead already</br>  <br>Far-Nees</br>  <br>Crossboarding is considered to be practiced only by the vilest of shitposters, and only complete newfags or retards would dare admit to it.<br><br><br>No he didn't, he literally became a tentacle.</br></br></br></br>  <br>thank fucking god. No more pirates. The world feels better than ever now.</br>  <br>I frequent a bunch of boards nigger, i only post on a and v though</br>  <br>Have you any other major opinions, anon? I like getting to know my fellow Berserkfags that little bit better.</br>  <br>So you're a complete retard then. Good to know.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br><br><br>Anons pls, stop your shitposting. If you want to bump the thread post something relevant.</br></br></br>  <br> Lost Children or Conviction  <br><br>Lost Children is IN the Conviction arc holy shit why does NOBODY know this<br><br>Lost Children is just a series of chapters</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay then. I think crazy Farnese and sane Casca are the best girls in the entire manga. Luca is a woman, so she stands leagues above and beyond.</br>  <br>Two out of three baby</br>  <br>Don't get started with Griffith morality or the thread bill become a gigantic meme.</br>  <br>will*</br>  <br> they get on the island <br> magic elf god nigga cures casca and whatnot <br> 10 chapters or so later they're done with their business <br> they get back on the boat </br></br></br></br>  <br>well let's see...<br><br> Irvine best new apostle, Raksas comes second <br> Ubik best god hand member hands fucking down <br> Berserk armor is a necessary evil <br> Griffith is a glorious motherfucker. He's a piece of shit but he's fucking great both as a character and as a villain <br> the gradual change of mood of the series doesn't disturb me as much as it does to some people <br> judeau best old band of the hawk member <br> there won't be a happy ending, I'm sure of it <br> goddamn fucking pirates jesus fucking christ <br> falconia is just a masquerade, there's no way in hell that place isn't going to end up being reeeeally bad <br> guts is THE man <br> &gt;luca best girl </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because nobody cares. Lost Children's plot is completely separate to Conviction's, and Guts doesn't get the conviction (hue) to rescue and protect Casca until a good while after the arc concludes.<br><br><br> the gradual change of mood of the series doesn't disturb me as much as it does to some people <br><br>I think that's because most of Guts' party are likely to stick around for the endgame. None of them (except Serpico, Roderick and maybe Isidro) are instantly likable, so that had to be built up over the course of many years, supplemented by the security that Schierke brings to the jRPG party. This is in contrast to the Band of the Hawk, who were supposedly invincible grim reapers of the battlefield, and mainly likable (except Corkus) from the get-go.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Why bother calling it an arc then?<br>It literally says Lost Children (1) Conviction Arc</br></br>  <br>Maybe Miura is like Araki, and forgets to plan ahead. It's easy to get caught up in Lost Children's eerie brutality.</br>  I hope Casca will cured of her insanity at least.  <br>Dude Conviction is an arc<br>Lost Children ans Tower of Conviction are two parts of the Conviction arc<br>Golden Age is an arc, it covers several series of chapters</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Far <br>far away<br> ne <br>One-san<br> ze <br>zed<br><br>Bunch of the names are Italian or Italian derived.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My career (which I studied for and graduated during the boat ride) involves working with a lot of dementia addled patients, I feel like it's given me a new perspective on Casca's condition. Skully's been talking about what Casca wishes for, but I think it's more than not necessarily wanting to be brought back to normal. She already remembers the Eclipse to some extent.<br><br><br>2 and 2 equals 4, the sky isn't always blue, what are you on about? Lost Children is stated to be a part of the greater Conviction arc, but has no connections to it outside of introducing Farnese, Serpico, Azan and the rest of the HICKs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly, I think it would be best if she died. It would create drama and tension between Guts and company, as he would likely blame them for her demise.<br><br>Despite the loss, Guts continues on a mission with the group to infiltrate Falconia, who becomes progressively more irritable and unstable. The group begins to fear him more and trust him less, which further exacerbates his already anguished mental state.<br><br>Once inside Falconia the hound consumes him completely and the city begins to fall apart as he rips through both apostles and men while a desperate Schierke tries to direct him towards his target (Griffith or whatever).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That would make the previous arcs seem pointless. I doubt Miura would dispose of her just like that.</br>    <br><br><br>We can have big arcs<br><br>And then we can have little arcs that live underneath those big arcs</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't sound like it would be for the best at all. Casca has been insane for nearly twenty years now, it'll be a big middle finger to everyone who has waited (or died waiting) for her to recover.  Miura loves drawing her, too. Can't do that anymore if she dies. </br>  <br>That sounds really cute, anon.</br>  <br>This is Berserk anon.<br><br>You have to let go of everything you know and love.<br><br>Except Isidro. He's gonna make it until the end.</br></br></br></br></br>  Will Guts transform into a beast-man like creature if he overuses the Berserker Armor? If Skully transformed into what he is due to that armor.  <br>Nobody in Berserk has been raped or engaged in on-panel sexual conduct for over ten years now. You have to let go of your edginess and accept the healing.<br><br><br>Depends, is there a spooky beast physically inside Guts?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope not, we already have millions of those.</br>  <br>What's the chance that Guts and the Beast will fuse and transform into a new being?</br>  <br>I think the 'ne' part should be pronounced as in 'never', assuming it follows the 'italian' pronunciation</br>  <br>The Beast is a part of Guts psychologically, but if you mean the armor, I don't think it'll make him into a being that can defeat the God Hand. Even if fate decrees it, then Guts will still be subject to IoE's whims.</br>  <br> The soul child will fuse with the hound <br> Berserker armor enters paladin mode <br><br>Yes</br></br></br></br>  <br>Couldn't think of an other example where the 'e' sound wouldn't turn into an 'i' for an English speaker.</br>  <br>I can't imagine Guts wear some tacky white and gold.</br>  <br>Nah, he's supposed to wear dark colours in contrast to Griffith.<br><br> How come the Beast didn't physically manifest after the World Transformation? </br></br></br>  <br><br>It did. It's called Guts and it's just waiting to break free</br></br>  <br>The beast isn't magic.</br>  Berserk is edgy crap for edgy teens. Guts is like a non-ironic embodiment of the "psssh nothing personell kidd" concept.  <br>Is the beast a being of the Ideal? It's like IoE in that it feeds off negative emotions, specifically Guts'.</br>  <br>Yes, Sword Art Online and Akame ga Kill are intellectual and insightful anime compared with this edgy crap.</br>  So wait, all you guys are cumming in your pants because he's releasing one chapter? Don't you realize it'll probably be another year before he does anther 21 page chapter? Why do you think he basically never puts them out anymore? It's because he's lost interest in the work. He would probably have ended it years ago if he didn't hink he'd be torn apart by angry fanboys. The whole "Miura's going to die before he finished Berserk" thing may have been joke at one point, something you posted half in jest, but at this rate it's not a joke, it's the mostly probable outcome. Berserk has been dead for years, what you're reading now its just its shambling corpse. You need to let it go so the healing can begin.  What if they never get off the boat and the entire manga takes place on the boat from now on? Guts and Griffith have their big retirement party on the boat  <br> The Final Battle takes place on a magical boat. </br>  Bet the new Mad Max made him want to draw again<br>10 bucks on the author corner comment being about it</br>  FUCK. I just realized something.<br><br> What if Skull Knight is Guts? <br><br> What if Void is Femto/Griffith? </br></br></br></br>  <br> It's the eclipse all over again <br> The boat dreamed of owning its own shipyard <br> Sacrifices guts and his party again <br> Rapes the cute little life raft <br> Founds Falcboatia </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Skull Knights horse confirmed for Ken-OH's horse. Skull Knight is actually Bat in the far future.</br></br>  How big is Griffith's ego?  <br>the size of the Great Sloan Wall</br>  <br>What the fuck am I looking at?</br>  <br><br>I hope the boat is destroyed, or is that too far and edgy?<br><br><br><br>They will always be voomers in my heart.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Fear kept me from reading Berserk that Ill get into it and never finish <br><br> The movies got me into it and I realized how amazing the manga is and how whether or not it's still worth the read <br><br> still scared he'll die before he finishes though </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's not the crossboard image though! The crossboard image has fucking nevada-chan in it!<br><br><br><br>What if it all ends in a  cock rampage ? Just Guts  fucking the entire place  up</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Legit quesiton: should I hunt down a translation of chapter 83, the proverbial "missing chapter" that miura's kinda decanonified and not had republished in tankobons and other collections?</br></br>  Is there a more fascinating character than this one in Berserk ? I don't think so.  <br>Are you not curious about the reason he had for doing it?</br>  <br>Eh, it's not that bad of an infodump.</br>  <br>It isn't hard to find, but you can definitely see why Miura would think it was too much too soon.<br><br>What I want to know is how much of it is still canon.</br></br></br>   chapter comes out <br> they are getting off the boat <br> sticky on /a/ and forces on autorepeat <br><br>if only mootles were here</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to see him fighting Serpico</br>  <br>Almost any monosyllable. E only changes to the Romantic I sound if it is followed by another letter, generally I or E.<br>Feed, Greed, Mead, Seed, Reid, Keep, Seep<br>compare<br>Fed, Red, Med(ical, icine), Led, Tred, Bed, etc.</br></br></br></br>  <br>/v/ got Earthbound for Iwata.<br><br>I believe in mods,  but I also want Moot back </br></br></br>  <br> but I also want Moot back <br><br>Who?</br></br></br>  <br><br>the founder of  fuck you </br></br>  <br>Too soon.</br>  <br>I see a penis gooing cum</br>  What if the spirits of the Band of the  Falcon  return and aid Guts as spectres that can fight against apostles while Guts fights Griffith in one large battle between the old and the new?<br><br> Then Guts can finish his job as the struggler with SK and kill all the Godhand. </br></br>  <br>They would still be only spirits of soldiers against mosnters with unhuman strength</br>  <br>I go on /a/, /co/, /tv/, /b/, /g/, /o/ and /x/.</br>  Its been too long since we reveled in the glory that is Serpicos tits.  <br>The first thing I thought when I saw him was that he is probably going to join guts in a few decades. <br><br>But now that I think about it wouldn't he cause guts to period all the time?</br></br></br>  <br>Far too long, I'd actually forgotten about it.</br>  I miss Corkus, Pippin and good ol' Judeau.<br><br>I wish the old band could be saved from damnation. Going to hell because of someone else and not your own is fucked up.</br></br>  <br>You're a whore.</br>  <br>Corkus was a right wanker.</br>  I just really hope that that annoying kid monkey will be killed soon. Hate this character  <br>I'm 216% sure Isidro is Gambino's kid with a random whore. You can actually see him going off with the mother when wise magical negro comes up to him.</br>  <br> Isidro is Gambino's kid <br>That explains this timeskip art.</br></br>  <br>That's just fanart.</br>  <br>Nah I don't think so</br>  <br> Casca at 39 looks better than Schierke at 29 </br>  GUYS IM FROM THE FUTURE I DONT HAVE LONG BEFORE I GET PULLED BACK BY THE TIMEPOLICE<br>IM WRITING THIS SO MIURA DOESNT TURN INTO A HACK IN THIS TIMELINE<br><br>GUTS DIES AND CASCA BECOMES THE MAIN CHARACTER FOR THE LAST 10 CHAPTERS AND SHE KILLS GRIFFITH</br></br></br>  <br>It never gets old   he </br>  <br>Japanese give me the impression that they don't take care of themselves properly, especially concerning disease. I'm not sure if it's because they are fatalistic, or just don't see it as a big deal.<br><br>He probably put off getting diagnosed, then didn't take treatment as seriously as he should have.</br></br></br>  <br>Nice one.</br>  <br>What's fascinating about him?<br>I find all those 'noble' good looking Apostles to be hypocrites just pretending to be human as a way to pay back their 'horrible' lack of judgement by accepting to sacrifice at their weakest moment.</br></br>   Shit hits the fan <br> Someone from the crew uses Puck's behelit <br>Will it happen?</br></br>  <br>Heh, this actually pretty good</br>  <br>S-sorry, anon.<br><br><br>That's fanart done by Skullnight.net</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is Guts always winking?</br>  <br>his eye got fucked up in the eclipse</br>  <br>9/10 I laughed out loud.</br>  <br>The beast is just Guts' alter ego<br>The symbol of a beast is just meant to symbolise his hatred and rage, it isnt actually a physical or spiritual being. Guts is the beast. He went slightly kooky after the eclipse but not completely bat shit like Casca.</br></br>  <br>I can only imagine Farnese realistically using it. <br>I mean Guts might be tempted to cure Casca and/or kill Griffith but he ultimately wouldn't use it.<br>Serpico is just an appendage of Farnese.<br>Casca needs to be cured first. And for what would the kids and the elves use the behelit?</br></br></br></br>  <br> I-its symbolic! <br> G-guts isn't using a giant sword, it's all a c-comatose kid's dream! <br>Oh go fuck yourself. The Beast of Darkness is an Ideal being.</br></br></br>  <br>I have a strange feeling that we'll see them again. In one realm or the other.</br>  <br>Its Guts' behelit, the behelit finds its owner sorta like the one ring. If anyones going to use it itll be Guts.</br>  <br> le Guts has a nice side and evil side <br><br>Nigga, it's all PTSD from the eclipse you fool. It's just his undying rage towards Griffith, and it takes the form of a hound because of past issues he has with himself, like being nothing but a "mad dog" or a "beast" etc. Guts doesn't need any of that bullshit. They are all a part of him.</br></br></br>  <br>So the idea of evil wasn't real either?<br>I think this is just how Miura likes his symbolism. <br>Very literal and actually existent in the the story.</br></br></br>   berzerk came back before hxh   <br>Bruz its literally just Guts ego. Did you not read the parts where he attacks Casca? He is losing it ever so slowly. You would too if you lived his life. If he loses the current JRPG company i doubt he will retain his sanity.</br>  <br>The thing is actually talking to him. Guts can hear it physically speak.</br>  <br> Its Guts' behelit <br>How do you know that?</br></br>  <br><br>Sucks when you can't even say RIP when you fucking know they aren't.</br></br>  <br><br> Guts gets off the boat before Gon gets on the boat </br></br>  <br> both hands in picture <br> eye still fucked up <br>It's the little things that ruin it.</br></br></br>  <br>That's how I feel as well. I really wonder what brought a dude like Zodd to his knees. They always act so tough and noble...</br>  <br>He was OUR wanker, though. That's what counted. ;_;<br><br><br>I refuse to debate with you, fuck off.<br><br><br>IOE is like the man-made god of the world. The hound is just a literal personification of everything horrible that has happened to Guts; it is a part of him, not some separate entity. If it was a separate entity or some demon possessing Guts, he would have had a corporeal form after the World Transformation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cos he took it? And he has refused to tell Skully about it even though he knows Skully would wanna eat that tasty morsel<br>Behelits are quite the delicacy in Midland you know</br></br>  <br>Well, that's your right, but I'm not gonna leave.</br>  <br>How about it his inner beast born out of his dark desires and it both is part of him but also its own entity.<br>I don't see how it can't be both.</br></br>  <br>Filtered.</br>  <br>What if magic nig nogs semen evolved in Guts' poop hole over the years and became the Beast?<br>I see no reason to discount that theory</br></br>  <br>Judeau deserved [s]better ;___;[/s]</br>  <br> its own entity <br><br>It isn't. It's like how in cartoons, a character gets an angelic version of him on the right side and a devilish version of him on the other.<br><br>Guts is a human with problems and recurring PTSD. He isn't some magical hero with a evil side</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ctrl + S bro!</br>  <br>So why did the berserker armor turn into a similar shape when it is just a representation of his dark side?</br>  Do you think Guts is able to beat this apostle ? He seems to be one of the most dangerous.  <br>Holy shit</br>  <br>I imagine he might end up being killed by Serpico or Silat. purely because no other apostle matches their fighting style.</br>  <br>What has he done so far that was dangerous? I don't remember. Apart from being really sneaky.</br>  <br>You just answered that question for yourself. It's the representation of his rage towards the demonic, and Griffith.<br><br>The hound was mentioned pre eclipse. He used to be called a "beast", a "mad dog" etc.<br><br>It's the same with SK as well. If he's gaiseric, he always had skull armor before Void's eclipse.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>who knows, we still have to see him fighting properly against someone.<br><br>Could guts defeat THIS guy?</br></br></br>  Everyone please filter Hawk, noname and tane. Your threads will be better that way.  <br>Honestly, I don't think guys like Irvine or Locus comited terrible crimes in the past like torturing or kill children/women/old men. It seems they have no interest in that kind of activity. They're are not psychopath. More... warriors.</br>  <br><br>Griffith is a white hawk/falcon, Guts is a black wolf, Gaiseric is a skull, Zodd is a minotaur, ect.<br><br>Not everything has to mean something deep. Sometimes its just there cos it looks cool.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Calling it now, Sonia and Irvine will either create their own neutral faction, or join Guts' side in the finale.</br>  so even if casca stopped being retarded, would there still be a chance she won't remember shit?  <br>being retarded is her version of not remembering shit. There was no other way to escape the trauma.</br>  <br>For now, it's pretty obvious that the most dangerous apostles are Zodd, Irvine, Rakshas and Locus. I don't think Guts have a chance against them in his human form. If he wants to defeats them, the beast inside him has to take control of his spirit (in this form, he's incredibly fast and savage and nothing can really stop him, so he could kill the strongest apostles, but he'll pay a bloody price)</br>  <br>Just be happy there hasn't been any "Griffith did nothing wrong" fags in these threads.</br>  <br>about her journey from the rape up until elfheim? It's a possibility. About everything that happened before and during the eclipse? Unlikely, or well, maybe the very moment when Femto rapes her may be too traumatic to be recalled clearly but the rest should come to her</br>  Griffith did nothing wrong, to be honest.  <br>Agreed</br>  <br>There's no chance she'll remember anything post-Eclipse, at the very least. However, she still remembers getting tortured by demons even in her Spas Cas state, though that only arises when she's under extreme pressure.<br><br><br>Yeah, but he did nothing right either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That, and she isn't Guts.<br><br>Surviving the eclipse is some heavy shit that I imagine would turn anyone into a retard.</br></br></br>  <br>Now that you mention it<br>Griffith did  plenty wrong. <br>But revenge is childish either way. I don't think anyone still cares about it, even guts.</br></br></br>  <br><br>don't. Just don't.</br></br>  <br>This<br><br>I couldnt say it properly cos im a retard <br><br>What i was trying to say is everyone important seems to have some kind of symbol<br><br>Like anon mentioned he's always been a "beast". The inner beast only really came to the fore once Guts started to lose his marbles. Also a berserker, according to myth is a warrior that transforms during battle into a ferocoius beast. Fun fact.<br><br>Its definitley symbolic. Not everything in Berserk is literal, theres a lot of implications.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh come on. You actually want it. You like it.<br><br>Just like Casca liked Griffiths dicking.</br></br></br>  <br>Irvine, Raksas and Locus are only dangerous right now because Guts has absolutely no way to defend against their fighting style. I imagine defeating them will fall into the hands of other party members current or future working together with their own specific skills.<br><br>But i think a berserk mode Guts and Zodd are finally equally matched now. Hell, if Guts goes dogserk he might wind up being the more bloodthirsty one for once.</br></br></br>  <br>They ride the b o at all the way to Griffith</br>  Reminder that Miss Luca is best girl  <br>you have no heart. We were doing so well too.<br><br><br> that fucking pic </br></br></br></br>  <br>Revenge is childish, but in Guts case I can understand why he would want it.<br><br>Griffith's wrongs went to such an extreme that Guts has every reason to want him dead.</br></br></br>  <br>Reported, filtered, saged, called the cops.</br>  <br>I expect big things from these three.</br>  <br>Shes good but pre mindfuck casca is best</br>  <br>Damn, this pic !<br><br>Am I the only one to think that Zodd is a fuckin cheater ? Each time he meets Guts, he say "c'mon let's fight honorably like two men, two real warriors !" but when Guts begins to take the advantage, Zodd transforms into demon. He's a cheater.<br><br>Same thing for Grunbeld.<br>"Hey, fight me like a man Guts !"<br>*he's beaten*<br>"Come on my soldiers, I authorize you to help me !"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope Miura's pedophilia stops him from killing Erica because I have this feeling she is going to die soon.</br>  <br>Shes going to get rape-slaughtered and you know it<br>Kill the lolis!</br></br>  <br>God, she was great.</br>  <br>I wonder how big Guts is<br>Totally straight but i wonder<br>Dude looks like hes packing a foot long<br><br>Maybe hes got two cannons uknowwhatimean</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With Zodd you get the impression that the fight is all about him, he just wants to test his limits to the absolute max and that's exactly what you go in expecting. Fighting in human form is just tryouts. He's even held off killing Guts if there's potential for a better fight later on like finding him after the Eclipse and after they just defeated Ganishka together. Hés still a massive selfish dick in all regards but at least he's sort of consistent. <br><br>Grunbeld is an absoloute faggot however, who pretended to be le honourable knight until he faced the tiniest chance he could lose.</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, Guts can easily wreck regular Zodd.<br><br>Guts is reaching a point where fighting demon Zodd can be a fair fight.</br></br></br>  <br>I would really like to see serpico fighting this guy</br>  <br>The only Apostle I respect is Zodd.<br>The rest can go die.</br></br>  <br>I've already predicted her death anon.<br>She's as good as dead and you should accept it while there's still time.</br></br>  <br>It's already a fair fight if you include the armor.</br>  On the topic of Zodd i never noticed he threw the mangled corpse of the subordinate, who's face he crushed, in front of Skully to block his path off. Fucking ruthless.  <br>It was that guys fault that he let himself get crushed.</br>  Reminder Skull Knight fucked everything up  Hey, where can I read all mangas from first to last volume released? People tell me about berserk for 15 years and it's about time I give it a chance..  <br>most reading sites use shit tier fansubs that completely mangle the story and characters so your best bet is downloading the bakabt scans.</br>  Grunbeld you suck  <br>What he did wrong was not being able to control his emotions about Guts</br>  <br> 10 days <br> only on volume 17 </br></br>  <br>I still don't understand what happened. How did his miss? There was nothing preventing his Behelit sword from striking Femto's back.</br>  <br>Nigga, fuck you doing?<br><br>I left off on volume 4 several years ago, and just started back up again 2-3 days ago.On volume 23 now. You have more than enough time.</br></br></br>  <br> Grunbeld is an absoloute faggot however, who pretended to be le honourable knight until he faced the tiniest chance he could lose. <br><br>Holy schitt, this.<br><br>As soon as he knew he wasn't shit, he turns into a crystal dragon and still got rekt. <br><br>Another Frodo question<br><br>When people who become apostles to sacrifice their beloved or whatever, do they eat them in their new form?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SK may have done a good thing in the long run though. Guts doesn't need to go to the ideal world anymore. He can just kill all of them here.<br><br>I want a short gaiden for each godhand about how they reached demonhood.</br></br></br>  <br> When people who become apostles to sacrifice their beloved or whatever, do they eat them in their new form? <br>Yes.</br></br>  <br>I don't really care about the two midgets, but i would really like to see voids past</br>  <br>Femto warps space and dimensions or some shit like that.</br>  <br>Ubik is the most interesting character in the manga, if only for his personality and tendency to mindbreak people.</br>  <br><br>When did this happen?</br></br>  If we're asking questions, can someone explain to me what the fuck happened during the part where  Guts was saving Casca from the church? <br><br> How did Mozgus become an apostle?  <br><br> How did the Egg-Shaped Apostle sacrifice his world? <br><br> Did God Hand orchestrate Griffith to be reborn through the Egg-Shaped Apostle? <br><br> Why did the town become consumed by evil? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm fully expecting this <br>I'm expecting the rpg party to die, guts go full rage beast and still not be able to kill Griffith.</br></br>  <br>those look more like (early concept) abyss souls that parts of the slug count. I think they're the ones that do the deed.<br><br>  just like the do to the apostle when they die. </br></br></br>  Shouldn't his human form be little more down to earth? Even without transformation he was so over the top.  <br>I think much of the appeal of the God Hand is the mystery surrounding them. I think I would rather if they origin stories were hinted at or implied rather than explicitly shown.</br>  <br>you. I like you. Ubik best nigga in the whole manga.</br>  What would be things in the new chapter that would piss you off. Mine would be<br><br> they finally get off the boat and one of them says "wow, that sure was one fast boat ride!" </br></br>  <br>I don't know, we see abyss souls in the same volume just a few pages later, and they look very different.</br>  <br> the egg injected evil into him, his followers and into the cult leader with the goat head <br> that was his ability, he used the twisted guts fetus as fuel for femto to be reborn human <br> yes they did FATE <br> it was a site of thousands of bodies that were tortured to death. all that regret, anger, fear c'mon bro </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why does Zodd seriously believe he can hold Skully off?<br><br>Fucking delusional.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably join so she can get some ishi dick</br>  <br>second last chapter released. when Locus gives Rickert the tour of the apostle gladiator ring.<br><br><br> How did Mozgus become an apostle?  <br><br>The egg apostle pricked him with his needle thing while they were holed up in the church by the sludge. Most apostles can do this.<br><br> How did the Egg-Shaped Apostle sacrifice his world? <br><br>It was an extra special situation because he had literally nobody else in his life to sacrifice.<br><br> Did God Hand orchestrate Griffith to be reborn through the Egg-Shaped Apostle? <br><br>Yes. however it's important to note that they DID NOT intend for the egg apostle to consume casca's child and throw him into the mix.<br><br> Why did the town become consumed by evil? <br><br>Most in-universe characters attributed that to having two branded souls in an area with astronomical strife and mountains of dead. But it could just have been godhand trickery.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He wanted to drag the gosh and to the deepest parts of hell<br>Pretty sure he says it at some point</br></br>  <br>What I'm expecting?<br><br> On the way to elf isle, then enter a demon portal <br> Basically have to go through hell on the boat <br> End up killing an apostle in the end <br> Then they find they end up half way around the world when they exit, only to arrive on another continent <br> Then hundreds of chapters of hijinx ensue on a strange new land <br> Recruit a army there somehow <br> Get all prepped for war <br> Then Guts says "Hold on, we've got to quickly go to elf isle to fix Casca, and get the elf kings blessing!" <br> The boat ride begins for a new age of readers <br> The next generation will know our pain </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop replying to Hawk.</br>  I downloaded berserk ages ago but I heard now some of the translations are pretty bad so how can I figure out if what I got are the good ones.<br>Is there a specific page I can check?</br>  <br>Are you me? I fucking love irvine and rakshas. I hope we get to see his demonic form.</br>  <br>Fixed.</br>  <br>I should check nametags more often. Thanks for the heads up</br>  <br> Are you me? <br>I don't know anon. Are YOU me?<br><br> I hope we get to see his demonic form. <br>does that motherfucker even have one? He can do some pretty crazy shit as he is, I can barely believe he's fully human</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's fine. Just trying to better your Berserk Thread experience.<br><br>Dayum that art is good. Got more?</br></br></br>  <br>I think that he's just in his normal form, which considering the others we've seen it is still beyond human, and he's just a really talented figure in general. I mean if you're too crazy for a cult of assassins you're probably awesome.</br>  <br>not by that particular artist, but i may as well dump some more fanart.</br>  <br>Maybe he just has like 100 copies of himself with top notch agility</br>      <br>I want more comic style berserk</br>    <br>This guy's been going through the whole cast in this style.</br>    The demon-form of Raksas will be a huge black spider.      <br> Huge guts </br>    <br>This is fucking hilarious.<br>Zodd literally just puts himself between plot points simply to fight the best</br></br>  <br>I need that Casca in a reaction image, stat</br>    So do the godhand all have powers related to space and time? Femto alters space, Void can make wormholes and Ubik opens up time windows to see the past.  <br> What should I do, What should I do ? <br> I know better to climb up on a rock and squat on it with a sword on my shoulder. <br><br>Picture that doesn't make sense</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fanart always overdo the ears. It was a unique design at the start of the series and I guess Miura stuck with it. Guts is definitely human. He doesn't have any super special bloodline.</br>  <br>How autistic, it's just a rendition of Guts hanging on the boat mast.</br>  <br> in berserker armor <br> actually thinking "what should I do, what should I do" </br></br>              <br>I don't think we'll ever get their origin story but considering how every final Apostle fight ends with some flashback of their lives, it might be possible.<br><br>We can already guess most of their backstories to a certain extent.<br>Void was the wiseman 1000 years ago who built a cult and then got sent to prison for torture after he became a threat to Skull Knight.<br>Slan was probably an insanely beautiful woman whom people would kill to sleep with. Plus would commit pegan orgies and whatnot.<br>Conrad seems like the type of Minister Foss who manipulates and can change people's ideals simply by talking to people. (like he did with Griffith at the Eclipse). I also somewhat think he used plagues and disease to fuck around with other kingdoms.<br>Ubik is the only one I can't figure out. He seems like a Freud type of person who probably ran a mental asylum and fucked with people's brains and mental state. The issue I have with this is that all other God Hand seem to have been very important people who likely fell from grace just like Griffith. But Ubik doesn't seem that important if he was just in charge of an insane asylum or was just a doctor who fucked around with people.<br><br><br>That's pretty cute.<br><br><br>That's pretty badass.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>        <br>yeah, there's probably something more to Ubik that we can't possibly know about right now.</br>  <br>This would be my favourite if Guts wasn't so off model.</br>  <br>most of the rest is just the stuff that gets posted all the time so may as well cut it off here.</br>  <br>My biggest gripe with these artists is that they always mix up golden age Guts and black swordsman Guts.</br>  <br><br>how can you mix up the 2 versions of guts?</br></br>  <br>they seem to always want to put him in a red cape.</br>    <br>Yeah, probably.<br>I just don't want a flashback of his life because it would break the mystery they have honestly.</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't mind a very brief flashback or something, but to be honest I expect Miura to give us a hint or two about him. Unless of course he wants him to stay shrouded in mistery and ambiguity</br>  <br>They always give him the one eye look, but they give him his old broadsword and red cape.</br>  <br>I would prefer ambiguity. <br>Though the only one that I'm sure will get a flashback will be Void.</br></br>  Elven King and Gaiseric confirmed for chums.  <br>Here's some proper translations, though you're probably still right about that.</br>  <br>that gave me a strange vibe as well. Puck be clearer next time you stupid chestnut</br>    <br>Yeah the torrent I used a while ago has a mixture of Hawks and Dark Horse stuff.</br>  <br>bit more evidence.<br><br>  skullknight confirmed to be elf piloting suit. </br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't it Ubik who fucked with Griff during the Eclipse?</br>    daily reminder this will never ever happen<br><br>NEVER<br><br>EVER</br></br></br></br>  <br>No but it was Ubik who fucked with the Count.</br>  <br> that shitty small handle bar.  <br><br>any Greatsword with a tiny handle bar makes it even more impossible than already is to swing. completely ruins it for me</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, this translation is more accurate, even the  italian  version puts it more in this way<br><br><br>fucking Skull Knight man. I hope we'll see more of him in the near future.<br><br><br>ubik and conrad give me the vibe of being bros who like to take turns to fuck up with people just because. Even though Ubik does it with style. Time travel shenanigans fuck yeah</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hopefully not. Casca instantly becoming teary eyed and embracing guts like a generic love interest is a disservice to her character and a waste of potential for some great elfhelm moments between them down the track.</br>  <br>we know anon, we know, there's no true happiness on the guts ride</br>  <br><br>no, at another point Puck mentions he feels like an elf. Skullknight being a the elf king is stupid. people also think that Puck is royalty too but i doubt that too. im guessing Puck saw a ship or something and snuck on in his early days.</br></br>  <br>Skully is the old Emperor, the one who imprisoned the man who became Void.</br>  <br>I'm positive Scully will be at Elfhelm, Miura's set it up perfectly<br><br><br>Yeah that page got posted a little after. never heard the skullknight theory before and yeah sounds ridiculous. <br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if everyone (or just one disgruntled wizard) got sick of puck and just shipped him off to the mainland. It would keep with his current character without the cheesy drama of him being a king or prince and we have some evidence that he was a bit of a menace at elfhelm through his memories.<br><br>Also calling it now, Puck will spend 90% of his time at elfhelm in a comedy B-plot with magnifico about the becoming elf king.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Miura dies and passes on all of his artistic talent onto you.<br>How would you end berserk?

Her feelings were pretty clear even before Griffith got mutilated. But it is just so much fun to defend Griffith on /a/. </br>  <br>Why would Casca prefer the guy who raped her and sacrificed everyone they knew to demons?</br>  <br>But look at this. In the end, she never gave up her dream. To become Griffith's sword  and woman. </br>  <br>Because she never stopped loving him. Before eclipse, she had made her choice to be with him.<br>Damn, even Gaston didn't hate Griffith after everything all he did.<br>Casca is uncapable of hating Griffith.</br></br></br>  <br> this is what griffithfags actually believe </br>  <br>I'm sure their backstory will do them justice.

Why kill him when he's the most fun its had in years?</br>  Anyone know what chapter it was when we see Femto for the first time at the slug demon's eclipse, and Guts charges at him only to be overwhelmed by the pain on his brand or some shit?  So is Gaiseric gonna turn out to be Void or Skully? While Skully actually wears the emperor's helmet, Void's actual face is a skull. It would make sense if Void was already a godhand by the time of Midland's destruction because the fairy tale mentions four angels, but if the populace was sacrificed by Skully why didn't he become a godhand as well? And why would the two of them have history if Void didn't try to sacrifice Skully?  <br>here my dear anon-kun</br>  <br>volume 3, page 54. 'Guardians of Desire 4', is when God Hand first appears. Ten seconds with google.</br>  <br>my bad, 54 pages may also refer to the lenght of the chapter. In any case, it's in volume 3 that's for sure</br>   moot didn't live long enough to see Gattsu get off the boat   <br> guts had the shittiest life, period <br>What about Stannis? I'd say it's pretty close between them.</br></br>  <br> Casca did, in fact, NOT enjoy <br>laugh at this guy, fellas.</br></br>  <br>Guts' is worse, by fucking far. Stannis had some seriously shit brothers, Robert mainly, but he was a noble, a general and lived an overall decent life for quite some time. He only had it rough in Storm's End's siege and well, after Robert died. Guts on the other hand lived through a fucking nightmare</br>  <br>This is sad but true. There are some treatments, but if you're screwed, you're screwed.<br><br><br>What about Vargas?</br></br></br></br>  <br>We all know on the inside she loves both of them in a way.<br>but she would have to forget the rape and completely just be a animalistic being for her to choose griffith. <br>Do you have that low an opinion of women that you think there is even the slightest chance she would chose griffith?</br></br></br>  <br>Gaiseric doesn't represent the ambition for knowledge.<br><br>Also Gaiserics helmet of yore was the berserk armour not the skull knights helmet which the witch discovered.</br></br></br>  <br>She would because she was ready to die for him, anon. Anything Griffith wanted, Casca was ready to do for him and his dream.</br>  <br>She didn't stop guts from leaving. She could've.</br>  <br> Casca was ready <br> was ready <br> was <br>Anon, things have changed. This was all before Griffith  had all of his friends murdered, raped Casca, and doomed his best friend </br></br></br></br>  <br>Guts had just rekt'd Griffith. Casca couldn't have done shit to stop him.</br>  <br>She insisted on it though.<br><br>Well, we can't be sure because she doesn't have her memories. But even if Griffith is a scummy fuck, Casca could never hate him, of that I'm certain.<br>They even had a discussion about this. Wait a little, I'll try to find it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She didn't stop him for the same reason no one stopped him. <br><br>Guts had just won against Griffith in one quick move, and they all knew his mind was made up. No one was about to stand in his way.</br></br></br>    <br><br>To simplify something more complex: <br>In northern Italian dialects when an 's' is between two vowels (such as in 'Farnese') the pronunciation is /z/ (the inverse happenz as well with 'z' becoming /s/). This disappears when going south, but standard Italian is based predominantly on northern dialects.</br></br></br>  if only Griffith hadn't tried to play the cool guy with Charlotte near the fountain none of that shit would've happened, probably. Shame on you Griffith.<br><br> jk, he had the conqueror's bejelit, it was bound to happen somehow, but still </br></br>  <br>So is Farnese properly pronounced "Far-nez" then?</br>  <br>I'll post the whole thing. Fuck it.</br>  <br> Casca could never hate him <br>This was before God Hand was known to exist. It's easy to say you could never hate someone when the worst possibility in your mind is rape. I have no doubt Casca could forgive rape, but you seem to be forgetting the other mountain of sins Griffith committed. <br><br>You're right that we can't be sure because right now she is mentally retarded, but I still think saying she could love him after everything he did is stretching it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's Far-nay-zay. I heard it in an Italian video once.</br>  <br>not him, but you have to pronounce the 'e' after the last letter just like you pronounce it at the beginning of the word, and it's not a z but more like an harsh s</br>  <br>Will reverse centaur bowmen ever fuck the gypsy loli?</br>  <br>the final 'e' is not silent</br>    <br>I don't think you understand how deeply she loved him. Remember, Casca prepared and commanded the hawks in his absence for his sake, even if it meant danger and death, she'd do anything for him.<br/></br>  <br><br>Knowing moon does seems convenient after seeing the differences in translation.</br></br>      <br>remember the reason she was so devoted to griffith? <br>He saved her from a rape as a child. <br>Does that somehow make a rape okay? <br>And honestly the killing of all the band of the hawk and the betrayal always seemed worse to me. <br><br>It is like you can't fathom that someone might change their opinion of somebody else.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>From rape and from a life of servitude for a disgusting noble.</br>   reformat PC <br> go to install CCCP  <br> see pic related <br><br>so CCCP didnt update over a year now?<br><br><br>please tell me what to install to enjoy my anime</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  MPC-HC pack. <br>Or the SVP player</br>  KCP  <br>You do not need CCCP or KCP anymore. MPC-HC now comes with LAV Filters installed. All you need is MPC-HC, MadVR and xysubfilter, and you can use ffdshow audio instead of LAV if you like for advanced audio features like virtual surround for headphones, Winamp plugin support, etc.<br>Set MadVR chroma upscaling to NNEDI3 64 neurons, image upscaling to Jinc, and under remove artifacts, set debanding to high if watching Horriblesubs. Turn on smooth motion. If this shit is too slow switch NNEDI3 to super-xbr, sharpness 100 for chroma upscaling. Doubling/quadrupling luma/chroma resolution with super-xbr or NNEDI3 can help a lot for upscaling if your computer is fast enough.</br></br>  <br>Thnaks for writing all this but i have no idea what you said, im PC dumb.</br>  <br>Just use CCCP. There hasn't been a need to update in over a year, but it's still the same everyone uses.</br>  <br>Then install VLC and never ask this question again.</br>  Compile mpv with vapoursynth.   so CCCP didnt update over a year now? <br><br>It still plays anime the same way it did a year ago.</br></br>  <br> please tell me what to install to enjoy my anime <br>I'm still using it and I haven't ran into any problems.</br></br>  <br> codec pack </br>  <br>I didn't even understand 20% of that, I'll just stick with KCP. It just works.</br>  <br>i might be dumb as a rock but even i know to stay away from VLC</br>  <br><br>Well of course you don't understand it if you've never even used MadVR, but it's not like it's difficult to install the software then play around with the options while reading that post and be like, oh, that's what he means.<br>How in the hell are you people even able to operate a device well enough to post here?</br></br></br>  <br>What overlay/ebuild can I use?</br>  <br>http://haruhichan.com/forum/showthr<wbr>ead.php?7545-KCP-Kawaii-Codec-Pack</wbr></br>  <br><br>If you guys do not care about improving picture quality with MadVR, then simply install MPC-HC and xysubfilter. That's it. KCP and CCCP are unnecessary and may complicate/break future operation of MPC-HC.</br></br>  <br>Why do codecs and all that technobabble Star Trek buzzwords even exist? What's the point of all the different packs? Do they each play anime in a slightly different way? What's the point of it all? Why not make something that just works?</br>  Use VLC.  <br> Why not make something that just works? <br>VLC is exactly that.</br></br>  <br> What's the point of all the different packs? <br>There literally is none now that MPC-HC comes with LAV filters pre-installed. MPC-HC will play all of your Chinese cartoons as-is now. You do not need to install anything else at all to watch Chinese cartoons with MPC-HC. xysubfilter is nice, though, for rendering subs at your monitor's native resolution, and MadVR is nice for improving picture quality, especially when upscaling.</br></br>  <br>I bet you play games in sub 60fps too.</br>  Hey guys OP here<br><br>i found a beta build of CCCP from May 2015 so im gona install that<br><br>here is the link if anyone wants <br><br>http://www.cccp-project.net/beta/Co<wbr>mbined-Community-Codec-Pack-2015-05<wbr>-04-RC.exe<br><br>if this doesnt work im goign for the KCP thing, cheers all</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Internal LAV filters are shit though. It works better with separately installed ones.</br>   Windows   <br>Video playback is more complicated than you appreciate.<br><br>If you don't know what you're doing just use stock mpc-hc, but if you care about this hobby you should educate yourself until you understand why madvr and xysubfilter are things you should want.</br></br></br>  <br>That's not true. I had to switch from VLC to MPC-HC not because of peer pressure from anons bullying me whenever I posted a VLC filename screenshot, but because every now and then I'd run into an anime that wouldn't play or would work terribly on VLC, and MPC-HC never had any problems so I switched over.<br><br>English please.<br><br>I only play map painting autism simulator PC games, I don't know on how many FPS those run.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not Windows </br>   still using cccp <br><br>Nigger just get KCP or fuck even mvp at this point.</br></br>  <br>how so</br>  <br>But whats wrong with CCCP tho?</br>  <br>Uh, yeah, you're going to have to provide source on that, as I'm fairly sure that's trolling bullshit.</br>  MPC-HC is old and busted. Install MPV, faggot.  <br>Are these settings good for live action movies as well?</br>  <br> Winamp plugin support, <br>Dohoho</br></br>  <br>You're cheating on your waifu by letting Microsoft pound you from behind.</br>  unless you are rocking a 5.1+ channel audio setup or a projector that requires proper color calibration to enjoy your chinese cartoons, MPC-HC is the only thing you really need now.<br><br> Although i do use SVP manager for CG heavy shows that have horrible framerate issues like knights of sidonia, but that's a matter of personal taste. </br></br>  <br>I've been using mpv for a while now but recently I've started noticing some frame tearing, specially in panning scenes, I don't know if it's because my laptop is shit or actually an mpv issue though</br>  <br>Believe it or not, I actually use this for headphone crossfeed.<br><br>Not sure. Not really my area of discussion. Only one way for you to find out, amirite? MadVR is fun to play with.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This. <br>When there's a need for an update, they'll release one. That's what they've been doing for years. <br>If you really need to feel you're an advanced human because you update your beta builds every night and convince yourself you made a difference, then you should never have installed CCCP in the first place.</br></br></br></br>  What's the best media player for windows 8?

That's a big difference imo. I remember trying to use NNEDI3 with Avisynth before MadVR implemented it and it killed my i7 even.

They all have the normal op/ed with NC versions separate</br>  "mpv is the media player of the future" -- Daiz  <br>It most certainly does mean that. I'm sorry that your tiny fucking brain can't understand simple things.</br>  <br>Uninstall everything (not Windows). Reinstall MPC-HC, MadVR and xysubfilter WITHOUT KCP. Try it again. Come back and ask again if you still have the problem.</br>  <br>Smooth motion not soomt, damn my spelling.</br>  <br>You certainly don't have a solid grasp on basic English.</br>  <br>I do. But I've been using it for...uh, since I started watching anime with /a/. 2007? Its been a while.</br>  <br>Firmer than yours.</br>  <br>L-lewd</br>  Kazaa-Lite is where it's at.  <br>Download 128kbps mp3s and 240p porn all day erryday on Napsta nigga.</br>  MPV  <br> There's been more /a/ and /g/ threads here in the past week than there had been in the previous two months. <br>The sentence would mean that retard if you removed <br> /a/ and <br>To get<br> There's been more /g/ threads here in the past week than there had been in the previous two months. <br>As it is now it means there have been more /a/ threads and more /g/ threads. /a/ and /g/ threads doesn't imply a combination which is what I assume you are trying to say it does.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Commit suicide.</br>  <br>Heh, I couldn't really care less about animu using ordered chapters tbh. Where it really shines is having multiple cuts of one movie in a file. <br><br>Releases like this are perfect<br> Alien (1979) 2in1 1080p Bluray DTS x264 - CtrlHD </br></br></br></br>  Quick if any Diaz tier autist are still here<br><br>Smooth motion in MadVR on or off? <br>I get frame dropd but not too much when its on, shoud i turn it off?</br></br></br>  <br>Off.</br>   bickering about grammar for over an hour <br><br>These threads really bring the autists out into the light don't they</br></br>  <br>Maybe if you do first retard. Go back to your ESL class.</br>  <br> I get frame dropd <br>Are you sure? Open up a file and start playback. Hit cntl-J to bring up stats in the upper left. Wait a couple of seconds for shit to stabilize. You WILL see dropped frames counted in the upper left. It always does this when you first start a file. Once playback has stabilized, do you see the dropped frames counter continuing to increase? If so, use less demanding settings. If not, you're good. Also, smooth motion shouldn't have that drastic of an impact unless you're on a toaster or already using demanding upscaling like NNEDI3.</br></br>   mpv   <br>Retard-kun, you can't blame others for the fucked up way you formulate your sentences.<br><br>You can't blame others for the simple fact that you have trouble expressing yourself.<br><br>Seriously, just how stupid are you?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I get 1 dropped frame every 3 seconds when its on. Is that bad?<br><br>I think ill just turn it off.</br></br></br>  VLC just kicked in yo  <br>I prefer not to have any dropped frames past those first few seconds. Smooth motion certainly isn't as important as the upscaling options anyways, so sure, leave it off. By the way, you may not realize this, but MadVR is always chroma upscaling, even if you're watching a 1080p file on a 1080p monitor, as Chinese cartoons these days tend to store the chroma information in a lower resolution.</br>  <br>Stop using VLC.</br>  <br>Not that guy but I didn't get your sentence either.</br>  <br>Coalgirls usually does ordered chapters.<br><br>Speaking of BD groups: why does SallySubs always use CR sub with typesetting from a fansub? Why not just go the whole way and use the fansub? It doesn't make any sense to me.</br></br></br>  <br>Well don't fast forward it dumbo.</br>  <br>Hey good lad.<br><br>In KCP should i set the madvr thing to highest if i have a good pc? Im confued because it said the low preset is default.</br></br></br>  <br>Define good pc.<br>Just set it to maximum and see if there is any frame drops.</br></br>  Is there a way to automatically set MPC-HC to default to Japanese audio over English?  <br>see<br><br>I'd advise a clean MPC-HC and MadVR install minus KCP to prevent future problems from occurring. I personally had a playback problem with CCCP which was fixed when I realized new versions of MPC-HC had LAV filters pre-installed, uninstalled CCCP and installed a clean copy of MPC-HC then added MadVR and xysubfilter to it manually. KCP and CCCP are unnecessary bloatware which can create playback issues.</br></br></br>  <br> What's the point of it all? Why not make something that just works? <br><br>Digital multimedia encoding and playback is a highly complex area of computer science. There's a myriad of combinations possible to playback video, audio, subtitles, etc and not all of them are compatible. Some are better than others and not everyone has the same opinion. That's why you see various codec packs.<br><br> something that just works <br>Something for the masses you say? Something that doesn't need technical expertise? They created DVDs and Blu-ray for that. You go to the shop, pay for them, get home and plug them into your player and you're set.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nice virus you got there</br>  <br><br><br><br>All of what he said is in the MadVR settings you lazy fucks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>zoomplayer<br><br><br>this too is acceptable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>The last update was 1 month ago, just use the beta versions if you are that insecure.<br><br>The last stable update works just fine.</br></br></br>  Guys, let's be clear. What is the best madVR config for sharpness and image clearness? <br>Specs:<br>i7-4790<br>GTX 970<br>16GB RAM</br></br></br></br>  <br> Burn Up! Excess <br>is this anime good?</br></br>  I just configure SMplayer to use mplayer2. I probably did this because of VDPAU or something, as I used Linux for a couple years.<br><br>I tire of people who think Windows Media Player v6 from Windows 98 was the be-all, end-all of video playback; which is basically what all these "Media Player Lite HD Ultra HD-HC Hyper Fighting" apps are.</br></br>  Because you don't fucking need CCCP anymore, MPCHC has LAV Filters integrated into the player already, you only need to download madVR.  <br>Crank up NNEDI3 as far as you can.</br>  <br>lel 3.5cuck</br>  <br> and under remove artifacts, set debanding to high if watching Horriblesubs <br><br>Just set a shortcut for that. Going into options every time is retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>Why don't BD groups just include multiple group's subs? That way everyone is happy. Some people want meme sub and others don't , since they don't need a translator they can just time multiple tracks and get everyone's dl</br>  <br>That would involve retiming each groups subs to fit the BD and they probably just don't want to do the work.</br>  <br><br>Jinc<br><br>And remember to turn AR filters on.</br></br></br></br>  <br> What is the best madVR config for sharpness and image clearness?  <br>There is none. It's source-dependent.  is a decent general starting point. You're going to have to learn yourself through trial and error. In general, NNEDI3 &gt; super-xbr &gt; Jinc &gt; Lanczos &gt; anything else, but there will be source-dependent exceptions to this regarding the different upscalers' artifacts and how they handle source defects.<br>I've found that the LumaSharpen filter under image enhancements and upscaling refinement, when set to its lowest possible strength, default settings otherwise, produces an extremely subtle sharpening effect with no noticeable artifacting with most sources.</br></br></br>  Is GOMPlayer still a thing?  <br>Thank you for your help anon-kun</br>  <br>I have the same GPU as you, as well as a worse processor and RAM, and I can run NNEDI3 64 neurons fine on chroma upscaling, and Jinc AR for image upscaling.</br>  <br>You ll get better results by using google.</br>  I think I fucked up because I had the correct MPC things installed thanks to the  Bloatgirls  guide but at some point my dumb ass seems to have downloaded and installed the CCCP thing and possibly fucked it all up.  <br>Here's the thing that sucks, anon. I'm not aware of a way to make it always do the proper subs because there's usually two identically named tracks, one with "signs" or something like that at the end, on these dual-audio releases, and shit is always set to the signs only one by default.<br>/rant</br></br>  How oudated is http://files.nyaa.eu/HOW_DID_I_PLAY<wbr>ED_BACK.txt cause this is what I did.</wbr>  How correct is this?  <br>Huh. I guess this could be done via .bat file that copypastas a MadVR settings file. Good thinking.</br>  What sharpening options do you use? (note: madVR 0.88.18 here - if you are at least 7 versions behind these settings are different for you)  Niqqa Im using the cccp i downloaded for my anime shit in like 2011 and its fine.  <br>Outdated. super-xbr and especially NNEDI3 are superior to Jinc with most sources if your computer can handle it.</br>  <br>How about killing your self anon-kun?</br>  <br>My computer can definitely handle it, but I get assloads of presentation glitches whenever I switch to super-xbr or nnedi3.</br>  <br>maybe 1-2 years outdated</br>  <br> What sharpening options do you use? <br>Highly source-dependent, especially FineSharp, which really shouldn't be used for anything but properly encoded 1080p BD rips. AdaptiveSharpen also produces a fairly strong effect even at its weakest setting, so it's definitely not for all sources. As I noted earlier, LumaSharpen with its strength at minimum can be quite useful due to the lack of artifacting it creates. None of the sharpening options will have much of an effect unless you turn on SuperRes and apply SuperRes first.</br></br>  <br>AdaptiveSharpen 0.3 in image enhancements and 0.6 in upscaling refinement. Also SuperRes 2, 1.00, 2.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Trolled.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Also, if you're upscaling, I'd recommend attempting luma doubling/quadrupling before going to the sharpening options. This will have a less destructive effect on the image while still having a nice sharpening effect.</br></br>  <br>CCCP is still under active development*; expect a release release at some point this year.<br><br>* http://www.cccp-project.net/beta/?C<wbr>=M;O=D</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Also, the sharpening filters are significantly more destructive to live-action video than anime.</br>  Can you actually notice the difference between upscalers in live video, or is it just something you see by comparing screenshots?  <br> I-I was only pretending <br>In your dreams retard.</br></br>  <br>There's barely been any development in X264 in 3 years. It'll just be minor updates to MPC-HC and maybe xy.</br>  <br>The differences can be extremely subtle and the differences can be drastic. Depends on the source and the upscalers involved.</br>  <br>What does the development of a H264 encoder have to do with a media player and subtitle filter?</br>  <br>Update drivers, if problem persist your gpu is shit.</br>  How do I get the Play/Pause text to not show up in the corner every time I press play or pause? I'm using KCP  <br>The point is that all the components are finished, there's literally nothing to update.</br>  <br>Do I apply SuperRes before sharpening or not?<br><br>Could you please tell me the config you use?</br></br></br>  <br>thought so, my gpu is indeed shit, I can't update my drivers or else my computer shuts down because it overheats</br>  <br><br>this<br><br>its driving me crazy now</br></br></br></br>  <br> Could you please tell me the config you use? <br>It's source-dependent. You're going to have to learn MadVR yourself through trial and error. Again,  is a decent starting point.</br></br>  <br> Do I apply SuperRes before sharpening or not? <br>Not him. The sharpening filters work much, much better with apply SuperRes first turned on. BTW, MadVR updates your anime instantly when you hit apply, so, even in fullscreen, you can access MadVR through the right click menu then see the changes in real-time as you click apply in MadVR.</br></br>  <br>Well, do you use multiple configs instead of a unified one then?</br>  <br><br>It's in basic madVR settings for a while.</br></br>  How do I combat this? I'm using xysubfilter and I watch at 1440p. Some particular subs give me problems. Like this bit in the Himouto op, the episode titles in orz's sb69, some of Chbiki's deremas insert song karaoke.<br><br>I get loads of frame drops for the duration of it. Sometimes MPC-HC even crashes - usually this happens if the cpu queue is raised further than 48, as for some reason that makes MPC-HC's memory usage go above the 32bit limit when fullscreened.</br></br>  <br> Do I apply SuperRes before sharpening or not? <br>If you want to use such high AdaptiveSharpen setting in upscaling refinement like me, SuperRes should always go last since AS is pretty destructive without it.</br></br>  <br>Mind blown.</br>  <br>You can't, ASS wasn't supposed to be used like this, It's one giant hack.</br>    <br> memory usage go above the 32bit limit <br>Use 64bit MPC-HC. Complain to subgroup for stupid multiple MB typesetting.</br></br>  <br>I find it works better to turn SuperRes on, set apply SuperRes first, then start from minimal sharpening settings and increase the sharpening from there until you get noticeable artifacting. I find that this will produce a sharper image than SuperRes last and higher sharpening settings can without noticeable artifacting.<br>I could be wrong on this and it could be a source-specific thing, but this was the result of my experimentation with this.</br></br>  <br>So I just have to deal with it not working or switch to xyvsfilter? <br><br>Really groups should stop overdoing it with the huge gradients and shit. Why even add all the "slackster" tape to the title anyway?</br></br></br>  <br>Is that a recommended thing these days?</br>  <br><br>Because some sub groups are fucking retarded.</br></br>  I get this on some files with madVR. Any ideas how to fix, or should I just make an account on doom9?  <br>OtaKing77077.mkv</br>  K-Lite Standard.<br>Seriously.</br>  <br>Also,<br> high AdaptiveSharpen setting <br>I really wouldn't recommend doing this at all with HorribleSubs files. Source defects will be very distracting.</br></br></br>  <br><br> just works <br>Top kek</br></br></br>  <br>Why not, just try it out. If it fixes your OOM crash then good. If not then the crash lies somewhere else.<br>madVR and xySubFilter both have x64 versions so I don't see any problem switching over.</br></br>  <br>looks fine to me</br>  <br> Just use CCCP. There hasn't been a need to update in over a year, but it's still the same everyone uses. <br><br>CCCP updated in May 2015 with a new release candidate, but it wasn't formally released at the site. You find it by clicking on forums, then checking out the BETA subforum. Follow common sense and eventually you will see a release candidate file for May 2015.</br></br></br>  Hey can you come over here?

Why are you interpretting it as third person? ありえない just doesn't make sense here. 無理 would be okay, but of course that has the same meaning as 出来ない</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why would you think the grammar would need to change for 出来ない <br><br>Because 弱くては出来ないis not grammatically correct, putting はとても in between won't change that. <br>無理 would be okay yes, but it's not interchangeable with 出来ない</br></br></br></br>  Any other clinical depressionfags here?<br><br>What methods have you used to keep up with your studying?<br><br>I want to get back into learning Japanese as I haven't done shit in over 6 months and I just can't bring myself to actually study when it feels like there's no point to it and it feels like a huge chore.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I still read for a couple of hours every day. I'm just at a point where the only thing stopping me from becoming Japanese is vocabulary.</br>  <br> Because 弱くては出来ないis not grammatically correct <br>If it is grammatically incorrect, so is 弱くてはありえない. Neither is grammatically incorrect though. The difference is just that 無理 and 出来ない make sense, and ありえない doesn't.</br></br>  <br>Look up Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy by David D.

Is sooner the better?  <br> So I wana know how important are radicals? And If I wanted to learn them. Is sooner the better? <br>They're somewhat important. It's between minor and moderate. If you draw a few common kanji according to proper stroke order a few times, you'll get a natural feeling for what a radical/component really is. Some radicals have meanings, but the overwhelming majority don't. If you see a radical several times, in a lot of similar words, it's good to look it up, just in case it means something.</br></br>  <br>Blow through RTK as quickly as you can. You will get tired and most likely won't finish but you'll learn enough about radicals that when you eventually revert back to studying kanji like normal Japanese people do, you'll have as much of an understanding about them as you'll need.<br><br>Seriously it will become super discouraging after a few times when you've studied kanji for hours and then you realize you still can't read or even coherently tell Japanese people what you studied</br></br></br>   hai means yes and no   <br> I_bet_the_jews_did_this.gif </br>  <br>It also means what</br>   is means both　は and が   <br>"Did you not go to the store yesterday?"<br>"Yes."</br></br>  <br> is means だ、です、である、であります、じゃある、じゃあるます </br>  <br><br>Please don't do this</br></br>  ユウシャデハアル   still no messages from qts on hellotalk   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Mye<wbr>MatSsC-I</wbr>  [ ]<br>What the fuck is being said at 10:37?<br><br>Do Japanese just decide to speak gibberish every so often to confuse foreigners?</br></br></br>  <br>He's actually speaking spanish.

Tried Imabi but it's a bit too wordy in my opinion though referencing some of its in-depth articles is worth it for tricky concepts that aren't in the DOJG.<br>- Listening: Nihongo Sou Matome series and (Shin) Kanzen Master series for systematized study that goes from easy to hard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128160185 <br><br>Thanks anon.

Because I was not sure if I should buy JLPT books intead of a textbook but now a textbook would help more right?</br>  <br>I'm not.

The Sou Matome and Kanzen Master series are musts if you want to keep doing systematized study after the beginner level, and even then you're not going to find much difficult material (as in complex grammatical structures) in shounen manga, moege, etc. so these ease you into reading more advanced material like plot-driven VNs, novels, etc.</br>  I've seen JS最高 written somewhere in a doujinshi, my guess is that it means something along the lines of little girls are the best, but what does JS stand for exactly? 女子小学生?  <br>See, the story is basically about two factions(one scientific group and the other is savages), the planet is divided in two parts and they land on the savage part.

Though I guess they expect you to do all of them in parallel.<br><br>The Sou Matome books are structured to be a six week course for each level (N3, N2, N1) with a single lesson a day (the chapter names reflect that). You can of course go at a faster pace if you want to, I did the listening book of N3 in 2-3 days, for example.<br><br>The Kanzen Master series is different in structure to the Sou Matome series. First, it's structured by lessons not by days. Second, it's all written in Japanese, no English whatsoever. Third, it's harder than the equivalent Sou Matome series.<br><br>You can go through both series as they're both pretty good. You can use Sou Matome as preparation for the Kanzen Master equivalent.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>証明できるの？</br>  Filling out the JLPT entry form, and it makes me question myself why I even bother  <br>[X] With Google Now</br>  <br> ネトゲする人 </br>  <br>If you're going through the DoJG deck (or using the reference in general), realize that it's mostly to use as reference or to refresh your memory. If you want actual explanations, you're supposed to read the entry in the DoJG as it goes much more in depth. CoRくん himself said that's how the deck is supposed to be used when doing new cards (reading the entire DoJG entry for each new concept as you go along as the notes and explanations are not in the deck or reference page).</br>  <br>Yeah CoRくん (I assume - or was it you) told me the same thing a few days ago. I got the pdf and have been reading Japanese the Manga Way too. I also plan on reading Tae Kim soon. Thanks for the concern.</br>  <br><br> And now got the "real" DoJB books, I only just noticed the online version/.pdf was only a simplified version. Thanks. </br></br>  I've been reading お気に入り as おきにはいり for a whole year.<br><br>Fuck.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's what I meant by reading the entry, since the stuff in the grammar reference page is basically just the headers of the entries and some example sentences / sometimes a formation table. There should probably be something somewhere to make that a little more clear.<br><br>It's still very useful for finding the entries you're looking for / quickly refreshing your memory on concepts you've already read through (though the deck is there for the latter), but it isn't intended to be a replacement to DoJG; just a large reference/index that includes example sentences and formation tables.</br></br></br>  I'm 5 months in and I'm finally starting to feel comfortable to talk like a babby.  Typing in Japanese with Windows IME is starting to fuck up my English typing. Like I might type "cyo" instead of "cho" or "si" instead of "shi."  <br>Maybe that's bad but I always typed し as shi and so on. I'm too used to it to channge now. Only exceptions are things like づ (du) ぢ (di) でぃ (dhi) etc.</br>  <br>I just type the full way.</br>  what is advanced japanese grammar?  <br>は vs が</br>  <br>You seem to be confusing the question with "what does someone on mount stupid thing is advanced grammar".</br>  <br> mt stupid <br>nice meme dude</br></br>  <br>I see you're still on it.</br>  <br>http://www.j-cat.org/</br>  <br>It always confused me why people make such a big deal of は and が. They don't even matter. It's just about feel. Once you have the feel for it you won't mess up. People overthink grammar and I don't understand why.</br>  i'm always fucking up basic sentence structure while using rikaichan to try to understand a sentence. My mind is too used to the english sentence structure any advice?  <br>  Once you have the feel for it you won't mess up.  <br>This is just wrong though. Sure, you may not mess up often with simple sentences, but you will certainly mess up when writing complicated sentences that use multiple はs and がs</br></br>  <br>Stop translating in your head.</br>  <br>Simply more exposure as you can guess.</br>  <br>It's because people on mount stupid think doing production is somehow useful for language acquisition when it's been shown in plenty of studies that comprehensive input is really the only variable that determines how much quickly one can acquire language. That is why retards who just start out think knowing the difference is useful, when all that really matters is if you understand and the rest will come with that understanding.</br>  <br>And the problem is that that "feel" takes several years to develop.</br>  <br>what am i supposed to do then?</br>  So when is it appropriate to use Nippon versus Nihon?  <br>Lol, you're accusing other people of being on mt stupid when you don't even produce? So your claim is just that you'll never mess up if you never actually try to use Japanese?<br><br>Hilarious.</br></br></br>    <br>What I don't get is why people pretend it's such a foreign concept. It's quite similar to the difference between a/the. It's not the same but it's similar enough.</br>  <br>Learn Japanese.</br>  <br>I never mentioned myself anywhere in my post. I'm saying language acquisition doesn't happen from production, but most inexperienced language learners think that it does and so they focus on usage of grammar rather than understanding and they waste a ton of time which could be used for exposure.</br>  Oh boy, here we go again.  <br>Nippon when you want to sound extra patriotic and fancy.</br>  <br>You expect to learn Japanese in a few months? Good luck.</br>  <br>I thought it was the other way around?</br>  <br>Meant for </br>  <br>Why did you end a statement with a question mark?</br>  <br><br>he said to stop translating in my head, which is what i do when i try to read, and i always fuck up, what am i supposed to do instead when i read?</br></br>  <br>It's much more nuanced than a/the. <br>Xが好きでYは嫌い<br>is correct while<br>Xが好きでYが嫌い<br>is not. That should be enough to show that you need to think about the whole sentence and can't just use a simple rule.<br><br><br>Okay, so just a red herring.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, they yell Nippon at sport events for example</br>  <br>It's true.<br><br>I just focused on reading for many hours a day. I then met a japanese person in a video game and managed to speak to him fairly quickly without practicing production much before then.</br></br></br>  <br>People on mount stupid do, yes.</br>   mfw someone on /djt/ didn't realize that people not only learn at different rates, but also learn better using differing methods, and that there isn't one true, proven method of learning Japanese quickly   <br>I can't explain it. You just read Japanese without a middle man in your brain.</br>   almost no posts in a whole hour <br> explosion of shit posts in last 10 minutes <br>diarrhea is the worst</br></br>  <br>Actually there is, and it's called  Rosetta Stone </br>  <br>Cause I was indicating a request for confirmation or perhaps a sarcastic, rhetorical tone, like this example?</br>  <br> thinking learning styles aren't just a justification for being lazy and having no will power </br>  <br>fuck off with your tumblr shit</br>  <br>Don't believe him. Yes, massive input is necessary, but it is not sufficient. <br><br>Speaking fluency is a separate skill in sense, and it does take practice. If you do nothing but read VNs for 5 years you will still be behind people who went to Japan and have N3 level vocabularies.</br></br></br>  <br>You managed to speak to him quickly but did you manage to speak to him correctly?<br><br> You don't know the answer to this question yourself, only a native could tell you </br></br></br>  <br>Nippon is like saying The United States of America. Nihon is like saying the US. One just sounds more formal than the other.</br>  <br>The truth is tumblr...</br>  <br>He assumed I was Japanese for a long time. It might have just been that he didn't expect a foreigner would be able to speak his language, though. I copied the way he was speaking, which was ultra polite keigo crap.</br>  <br>It does take practice, but it takes significantly less time if you can already read fluently. Plus I was talking about language acquisition, are you retarded? Can you not read? Or are you just trying to argue with a point I wasn't making on purpose?</br>  <br>I should also add it was just typing.<br><br>I've never spoke at all.</br></br></br>  So if は/が isn't the hardest part of Japanese grammar, what's a single structure that's harder? What other structure takes years of experience to get right consistently despite being one of the most common parts of the language?  <br>Grammar isn't that difficult. Just read.</br>  <br>We aren't talking about whether grammar is difficult or not. We are talking about which part of grammar is the most difficult. Perhaps you should work on your reading comprehension.<br><br>And as was mentioned before, nothing is difficult if you never actually try it.</br></br></br>  I almost got my VN to work. I got the Unicode fixed but now it won't even start up anymore...<br>Why is life so hard?</br>  <br>He might also have just been flattering you. All natives will tell you your Japanese is great even if it's shit.</br>  <br> change system locale to japanese <br> never have a single problem with japanese software <br>It's only hard because you're making it so.</br></br></br>  <br>Stop thinking of the English in your head.<br>So next time you see raikaichan's new word, the eyes see a word like 服, the head understands 服. It helps me if I think of the action or thing so in my head such that I'll picture myself putting on clothes for example</br></br>  <br>well, my Japanese roomie has a thick accent and I still tell him he speaks well cause I wanna encourage him and not be a brash asshole.</br>  How do you get to the point where you can understand spoken numbers fluently?  <br>Try setting up a texthooker and then you'll have an actual reason to complain.</br>  <br>practice, my wapanese friend</br>  <br>practice how<br>listening to random stuff isn't enough</br></br>  <br>Advanced grammar is mostly unfamiliar dialects and accents. Whether is Miyazaki-ben or it's attempting to read Tale of Genji for the first time, that is what I would consider advanced grammar.</br>  <br>Yes it is. You just have to do it enough.</br>  <br>That's not advanced, that's just different dialects.<br> attempting to read Tale of Genji for the first time <br>Yeah and the hardest part of English grammar is reading latin :^)</br></br></br>  <br>Yes it is, you just haven't listened to enough stuff yet. Stop posting stupid questions with answers you already know.</br>  Losing motivation because I can't read anything. What do I do?  <br>So basically you can't do it yet either? Then I don't need your advice.</br>  <br>は and が isn't advanced, it's just は and が :3</br>  <br>lingQ. u can refer urself for an extended trial</br>  I really can't make out what the 4th character is.<br>I'm thinking ん, but I'm not sure.</br>  <br>go download a random VN and read that shit, my first ones were owarinaki natsu and できない私が、くり返す both werent really that difficult.</br>  <br>If you don't see the difference between the two situations you must have an IQ of 80. Nonstandard != advanced. Most dialect stuff is just simple substitutions that work exactly the same way as the comparable thing in standard Japanese.<br><br>古文 is more difficult, but if you can't bring up an example in standard, modern Japanese then you should just admit defeat.</br></br></br>  <br>つまんなそう as in つまらなそう</br>  <br>Play the Rockman EXE games if you like them. That's what I'm doing.</br>  <br>ah thanks, I thought the つ was a「 since the sentence also ended with a し that looked like 」</br>  <br>ROKUMAN EGSAY!</br>  <br>"Advanced vocabulary isn't advanced, it's just more obscure."<br><br>Yeah that's what advanced means retard.</br></br></br>  <br> ad·vanced (ăd-vănst′) <br> 1. Highly developed or complex. <br><br>No, it is not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't listen to that guy. You have to start out translating in your head, and eventually it just goes away. The only way to fail at learning a language is to quit. If you keep going, you will make it.</br>  <br>Monolingual detected.</br>  <br>Please stop shitposting, nobody is going to praise your amazing Japanese skills just because you insult everyone and post mt stupid pictures every thread.</br>  <br>so i'm supposed to just fuck up the sentence structure till it goes away? There's nothing i can do to improve it?</br>  <br>You can't learn Japanese. Just give up.</br>  <br>fuck off shitposter</br>  <br>Eventually you'll get to the point where you don't have to think "This is お手洗い which means restroom" and will just know お手洗い is お手洗い.</br>  <br>Yes, just keep reading and you'll get it eventually. You could also try reading through grammar again, that might help.</br>  Don't let the shitposters bring you down.  I feel like translating things is extra strain on your brains and it's way harder than just reading and understanding the sentence, how do you even manage to translate things in your brain? <br>Right now I can just understand what's written in your posts, but if I had to properly translate them in my native language it would take some time, and I most certainly wouldn't be able to do it just in my head. I always thought ability to translate on the fly is a skill that comes with a high level of fluency, not the other way around?</br>  <br>My thoughts exactly. I can communicate in English all day long (both spoken and written) without problems but if a family member asks me to translate something from our native language into English I am going to doubt and struggle slightly.</br>  <br>when i was like 8 one day i just GOT french. when that happened, I started translating everything into english to understand it. I remember that, and recently i checked to see if i still translate in my head, and i don't, i just get french as french.<br><br>What i'm saying is the need to translate just fades over time.</br></br></br>    <br>i'm talking about sentance stucture, such as which adjectives affect which nouns, etc.<br><br>it's the same thing right?</br></br></br>  <br>Mind if I ask if you watch a lot of anime, listen to a lot of Japanese music, ... well, consume any Japanese media in general?</br>  <br> What i'm saying is the need to translate just fades over time. <br>And what I'm saying is that I don't even has the ability to translate, so I don't understand the need. <br>I can read a page of manga just fine, but translating it would make my head explode.<br>Well, I guess it's just different for different people.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, i read VNs a lot, and watch anime sometimes.</br>  <br>Maybe if you reading or listening to Japanese rather than complaining about it on an image board, the problem might start to get better.</br>  <br>I'm not complaining what so ever, i'm just looking for advice. I do read, and i fuck up which is why i'm here in the first place</br>  <br>Fucking up is natural, ignore fuckups and move on as long as you get the general idea. The more you read the clearer it will get.</br>  <br>normally i look at the english version, and try to understand why i fucked up. Am i not supposed to do this and just move on?</br>  <br>If what you're saying is true then how come you even finished reading single VN? Don't tell me you're using a texthooker that automatically translates the VN in "English" or something.</br>  <br>Translated VNs, not raw. I'm learning to read the raw ones. Long way to go</br>  <br>Just stop asking stupid questions and DO IT.</br>  <br>No, after you make any mistake while reading something you should put it down and try something easier.</br>  I'm in a catch-22 situation here. If I don't read I won't be able to get good enough to read the good stuff, but if I don't read the good stuff now I won't find the motivation to keep reading and get good.  <br>I think i'm doing the easiest i can find. Besides, how am i supposed to know i made a mistake if i don't have a translation</br>  <br>Read the stuff you know is good that you've already read in English.</br>  <br>Where's your guarantee that the translators didn't fuck up or reworded something to make it more suitable to gaijin readers?<br>Anyway, checking if you understood correctly is pointless and counter productive, this isn't a test.</br></br>  <br>Please stop posting. Seriously, we really do mean the best for you by saying this, stop it. It's clear enough you're an absolute beginner, go read the guide and build yourself a good study schedule.

I still review to make sure everything sticks but has anyone had any issues when reading something in moon but it takes a bit for it to process in your mind like regular words or engrish even though when you are trying to read something and translate it in your head but it takes a more than a moment compared to your average native and/or non-native speaker? am i rushing it or is it just more of a "me" issue? i mean know the word and how its spelled in the kana but i just seem to keep getting lag so to speak even though i get it. do you have any advice that you can give me?  俺の国には＄５００でセックスを買える　しかし　タイ王国には＄５０でセッ<wbr>クスを買える！　それ言っても俺の国からタイ王国までの飛行機の切符が＄１<wbr>０００代だ　それならどっちのほうがいいのか？　ったく俺がセックスしたい<wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>  Can you use a text hooker with VNs on Steam?<br><br>I just bought Higurashi and I can't figure out how to into it.</br></br>  <br>そい子<br><br><br>There's no point in comparing, you need to read more shit and comparing slows you down.</br></br></br></br>  <br>really, i'm comparing to make sure i'm not completely off</br>  <br>Should have bought it from MG's site.</br>  <br>３匹女を買えばお得じゃん。</br>  <br> が </br>  <br> Today once again I'll act as if I'm doing my best </br>  <br> 俺がセックスしたい <br>Not him but it should be は right?

How come I can understand everything after just 2 moths of learning?  <br>It really just sounds awkward in general.

I feel like I'm not putting all of my focus.  <br><br>Try learning Japanese.</br></br>  <br> 愛しき人の面影を探しては、貴方の夢を独り見つめてる <br><br>How would you translate this?

I can't exactly explain it with word, it's just something I learned how to feel with time. Try to visualize that particule encompassing what's behind it if that helps.</br>  <br>It would seem so.</br>  <br>ては is a basic grammar construction.</br>  <br>It has more than one meaning. It can sometimes be used just to indicate order or multiple actions<br>AしてはB<br>Doing A then B<br>or<br>Doing A and B<br><br>It can also mean "if"<br><br>I can't think of it being used as "in order to"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>は here means these 2 actions are being done repeatedly, one after the other.</br>  Where can you pirate Japanese books?  <br> random particles <br>There's nothing random about the は.</br></br>  つい先月まで住んでいたにも関わらず、都会の賑やかさに圧倒すれた。<br><br>I'm a bit confused on the 住んでいたにも part.

Granted, after the first 2k words in Core it does get easier. 1k kanji in the first 2k words, 800 over the next 4000. Really just involves new combinations and new pronunciations. RTK is still pretty neat depending on how you're reviewing it, though; I've definitely noticed it helps with recognition, since if you review by production (various kanji meanings on front, kanji/stroke order/heisig and koohii stories on back) you're basically getting 100% recall on what components the kanji uses and there's never going to be any you mix up due to a small difference.</br></br></br>  <br>More or less the same thing as that guy  happened to me, you should try to integrate RTK again to your routine (with a deck), doing a litte of it everyday. If you don't care about writing you can even get done with it in only a few weeks.</br>  <br>Not that guy but I don't understand what your point is. Are you implying you never mix up words or what?</br>  <br> just use the Core 2k/6k deck <br> (optional) Kanji <br>You all always do this shit to discourage newcomers into dropping nip for good or something?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, I'm not that far in yet. <br><br>I'm just going through Core2k/6k. <br><br><br>I'm retarded, obviously.<br><br><br><br><br>I'll try this out, thanks guys. I assume I should go ahead and just make my own RTK deck since most won't be to your specifications? (which I really like since they make sense)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ignore them, RTK basically does nothing. The people who recommend doing it are the people who are still using it. Once you're finished you will realize how much of a waste of time it all was. If you go to the koohii forums which was originally a forum for RTK they will almost all tell you it wasn't really worth the time unless you want to learn to write.</br>  <br>see </br>  <br><br>So when you learn new kanji, how do you do it? Just brute force it in?</br></br>  Why don't you guys just spend your time watching anime instead of wasting time learning Japanese?  <br>Answer: Do it fast enough so that it's worth. 2 months, bitch.</br>  <br>This, only with KD instead of RTK. Took me 2 months, now I have 95% retention rate in 6k and can read most words the first time I see them.<br>Fuck every anon here who recommended brute forcing 6k to me.</br></br>  <br>Don't make your own deck. A few threads ago an anon linked a RTK deck that seemed interesting, I haven't tried it myself but look into it maybe?<br>http://japaneselevelup.com/japanese<wbr>-level-up-rtk-mod-anki-deck/ otherwise grab the deck from the anki website.<br><br><br>You're the cancer of djt.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Yes, that is how most people do it. If you do RTK you will notice afterwards you will either forget the mnemonic completely for just recognition, or you will try and recall the mnemonic constantly and slow yourself down. The only time the mnemonic is useful is when you are recalling it without seeing, and the only time that is useful is for writing. That is why RTK goes keyword &gt; kanji and not kanji &gt; keyword. It is for remembering the radicals from scratch. It is not worth it if you want to read / type, which is recognition only.</br>  <br>We told you, anon. Learning Kanji individually improves vocabulary retention, it's a short-term investment for a long-term reward.</br>  Japan Guy here.<br><br>Anybody have any questions they need to ask?</br></br>  <br> you will either forget the mnemonic completely for just recognition <br>That's what it's supposed to happen anyway. Read the introduction.</br></br>  <br> you will either forget the mnemonic completely for just recognition <br>You pointing that out as a negative shows that you don't understand what it's supposed to do.</br></br>  <br> That is why RTK goes keyword &gt; kanji and not kanji &gt; keyword. <br>That's why you ignore the fucking book and just use RTK anki deck.</br></br>  <br>are you getting laid</br>  <br>You "learn the kanji" by just learning words though. You do not have to explicitly go out of your way to learn anything.<br><br><br>You forget the mnemonic for recognition in the same way that you would just learn it through recognition in the first place though, making RTK a useless exercise.</br></br></br></br>  <br>安全保障関連法案についてご意見を</br>  I have to say I'm more confused now than when I asked the question in the first place. <br><br>I guess I have no choice but to at least try the RTK thing all the way to completion while doing it brute force for the kanji I haven't reached yet. <br><br>No sense in not doing both.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Would you also tell japanese guys that they don't have to learn the alphabet first and should just start with vocab?</br>  <br>Not him but posting that image only gives his argument more credibility by your lack of one.</br>  <br>There are a lot less kanji than there are words. When you know kanji you don't have to learn words, you just can read them.</br>  <br>I hope you don't actually believe that. Go finish RTK and try reading something, you will fail miserably.</br>  could horrible subs be wrong? that is thursday, not tuesday (mokuyou, kayou)  i wish i started this like when i was in highschool, it would have been amazing.<br><br>seriously get into this shit early, youll regret it later if you dont</br></br>  <br> You forget the mnemonic for recognition in the same way that you would just learn it through recognition in the first place though <br>Except the part where it's much harder to reach that point with brute force. You don't need to read the introduction, you need to read up on mnemonics. Recognizing the Kanji isn't the only benefit it leaves you either: radicals for searching and distinguishing Kanji, meaning for vocabulary acquisition, stroke order for searching and reading handwriting better.</br></br>  <br> When you know kanji you don't have to learn words, you just can read them. <br>無知乙</br></br>  <br>Consider trying KD. The mnemonics are shit, sure, but it gives you more context, actually useful readings and example vocab words for each kanji, which I found more useful than writing.</br>  <br><br>I decided to give RTK a whirl after about 7000 words of bruteforcing core and my own mined decks.<br><br>Like you, I didn't stop reading / learning new vocab, I've only mixed RTK into my daily routine. I'm about halfway through it now and the results have been fucking astounding. <br><br>The words in my deck that contain kanji that I haven't covered yet are still constantly lapsing and fucking up as usual. The ones that contain only kanji I have names for, I'm retaining with ease. The difference is crystal clear. <br><br>Not only do you not confuse kanji with one another, but you gain a complete mnemonic system to assist with vocab. There is no drawback to it; it's really easy, and it helps a lot. It's pure win. <br><br>If you look closely at the anti-RTK faggots, they're usually pummeling a strawman that spends 2 years doing RTK before even learning hiragana, or they're trying to call you retarded because you don't have autistic rain man memory for kanji. Just ignore them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because I can do both</br>  <br>Remember that the Reviewing the Kanji website exists, don't waste time creating your own mnemonics likely made a story better than the one you could've come up with. Also, try to do it fast or in conjunction with grammar.</br>  <br>He's one of the few people constantly arguing over RTK in every single /djt/ thread. It doesn't have anything to do with him but he still does get triggered, that's how teenagers are.<br>There is nothing to argue about, like  said, doing RTK/KD is short-term investment for a long-term reward and it's worked for many people. That's all there is to it. Anti-RTK faggots are cancerous and they should fuck off.</br></br>  <br>You get the meaning through the words that they are in. Knowing a word that contains the kanji is worth way more than a single English RTK word, which are often times not perfect because of the way RTK goes out of it's way to not have similar meanings for kanji, etc.The other two things you listed are incredibly irrelevant. You can learn stroke order by itself in like 15 minutes, and looking up kanji accounts for such a small amount of time that it's irrelevant anyway.</br>  <br>I've taken japanese classes since middle school<br><br>it took one year for us to learn hiragana</br></br></br>  <br><br>Anon, I don't mean to refute you.

Which one tops?    Movie spoilers from yesterday.<br><br>In a post-apocalyptic future where only a fraction of humanity has survived to live humbly amongst the rubble, Eren Jaeger dreams of more. His brainy friend Armin tells tall tales about deserts and oceans beyond the massive walls that guard their civilization, and his girlfriend Mikasa is equally entranced by the birds that soar over those untouchable barricades. Unfortunately, Eren's wish to see the walls opened to the outside world comes at a devastating cost. Enormous humanoid monsters called "Titans" come stampeding through the walls and immediately start eating every man, woman, and child they can find.<br><br>In the aftermath of the tragedy, Eren joins the newly minted "Titan Survey Corps" alongside hundreds of other young adults. Some of these new soldiers are hungry for revenge, but most are just plain hungry due to the ensuing famine. While facing down his demons and fighting through past trauma, Eren will have to rediscover what "freedom" means to him in a new world ruled by fear.<br> Eren and Mikasa were dating before the first attack <br> Mikasa gets separated from Eren and Armin and is presumed dead <br> It's implied that Shikishima saved Mikasa's life <br> During Eren and Mikasa's reunion Mikasa is butthurt towards Eren since she thinks that he abandoned her after the first attack <br> It becomes evident that Shikishima holds romantic feelings for Mikasa <br> Armin and Sasha seem to have a thing going on <br> Eren and Mikasa's relationship starts out as cold after their reunion but Mikasa slowly starts warming up to him <br> At the end of the movie Eren gets eaten and he shifts, Mikasa is the one who pulls him out of his titan form and she hugs him tightly <br><br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128163299#p128163299">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I still wonder why manlet opened up to Nifa. It seemed out of character for him to tell someone something specific about his past. He could've just had an inner-monologue to fill the reader in on his relationship with Kenny, but him opening up to her still feels kind of odd to me.  <br>Oh yeah, Petra 2.0<br>but seriously why are there so many short light haired white girls gettin wasted</br></br>  <br>There was no relationship. He later told everyone about Kenny and that he was an Ackerman like Mikasa.<br><br>Manlet only cares about Erwin and pic related.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget Hanjo the banjo.</br>  <br>What? He clearly said he lived with him as a kid, that's called describing a relationship to someone else. I never said they had a caring relationship. I just said him bringing up Kenny and telling Nifa that he knows him is strange. <br><br>And I don't think he told anyone in his squad that he's an Ackerman yet. The first time he actually referred to himself as an Ackerman was when Kenny was dying. It's doubtful Isayama would pass up illustrating Mikasa's reaction when she finds out.</br></br></br>    <br>You can't fool me.
