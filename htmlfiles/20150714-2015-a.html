[ Tell me about Uiharu. Why does she wear the flowers?  <br>If I smelled them, would she die?</br>  Why does she wear the flowers?  <br>Uiharu rape doujins should always have the flower band symbolically destroyed through the sex act.</br>  <br><br>That's disgusting.</br></br>  <br>start drawing</br>  So LNfags, is this bitch really a traitor? Spoil me, how did she betrayed the group?<br><br>Also I'm really digging Adlet's fighting style. Action/fantasy anime needs more Trickster.</br></br>  <br> Be you <br> start my blogposts with 'be me' in case it wasn't clear who was writing the post <br> deserve to get spoiled </br></br></br>   Huur durr the heroine isn't like my other seasonal waifus and doesn't suck the MC's dick <br> She's a shit, A SHIT! <br><br> The Majin doesn't die, he needs to be sealed within a month every century which is not an effective solution. They need a permanent one, like finding a way to kill him for good or just go with her plan (not the let's unite the world, that's just delusional) which is coexistence between kyouma and humans.<br><br>Sometimes you need to see the situation from another point of view. She's trying to save the world with another method than the one the heroes always used.<br/></br></br> </br></br></br>  I thought  Goldof  was the traitor. I\ll just keep reading until I hit a wall.  Later on you find that there's another seventh once the rabbitgirl is revealed to be the first seventh.<br><br>Adlet is actually the other seventh, but he's not evil. He just got brainwashed into being a whitefag for fremmy. Also fremmy is a ticking time bomb, if she's killed, then everybody around her is kill or something.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  Here's your new thread.<br> Still no news on vol.11 ch.2 </br>  <br>On the record I am in for incest.<br>It is just that genuine love must be something that will last wether you are family or not and 8man and komachi would never have even be fríends if they were Not siblings</br></br>  <br>Well if you remove the family relation from the equation thats's what genuine love is, I'm not saying Komachi herself is the genuine I'm just defining what it is.<br><br>The kind of love Komachi has for 8man if you remove the obligation of family, that would be what actual genuine love is.</br></br></br>  <br>But is not komachi always trying to do what she thinks is bes for 8man? That can Not be genuine love</br>  <br><br><br><br>Genuine Love, 1/3</br></br></br></br>  <br>This has been posted already <br><br>OreGairu has little to no good art, I feel as though I've seen the exact same image over a dozen times. Not just Komachi.</br></br></br>  What did you think of this weeks episode? Is anyone else hoping a super lewd romance develops between Ayame and Tanukichi? Because I sure am!  <br>Especially since she was dead at one point.</br>  <br>I miss Fuck Quest already.<br>But I'm not interested in /tg/ enough to want to lurk there to look for the next Fuck Quest-like story.</br></br>  <br> I miss Fuck Quest <br>Get the fuck out</br></br>  <br>Why is Kajo so BEST Shimoneta?</br>  <br>Nah, go choke on a dick.</br>  Hey. Dumping some supernatural shogi manga. It looks like those who died a heroic death are chosen for a shogi tournament, or something. 2013, ongoing.            It's like I'm watching Nanoha A's all over again.<br>I hope we get cartridge-fueled fisting.</br>  <br><br><br>It's sped up slightly to avoid the copyright filter and labelled as "nightcore" for the flimsy excuse that it's a legit remix. It seems to work though.</br></br></br>  The amount of times and the way she said Tsurugi in this sentence was sexy.  <br>I think she's one of the more interesting characters. She's struggling for real and she's trying this hard even though she kept failing in S2, which makes her really likeable in my opinion.</br>  <br>That whole highway was sexy that night. About to become even sexier with Tsubasa getting stripped.</br>  <br>Is this from the manga or a doujin?</br>  Leaks soon, lets wait together.<br>Soon the fate of the series will be known. <br>Also happy birthday to Hayarin (28) for yesterday.</br></br>  <br>the chart of the bonuses for the manga volumes is well filled already (not sure if it's the last one, since I didn't check futaba lately).</br>  <br> Ritz probably doesn't want the captains match to be rushed in time for an anime <br><br>I don't read manga, but what the fuck it's not even captain's match yet?</br></br></br>  <br>It started a few chapters ago, and it will probably end at the end of the year or the beginning of next year, depending on the length of the match and the breaks that she will take.<br><br>But it's possible that the anime series will be announced, but it will only cover the semifinals of Side B.</br></br></br>  <br>No Wonder Zenkoku-hen ended where it ended. Ritz's pacing is fucking horrible.</br>  <br>Well Zenkoku ended there because it was the end of a complete arc.</br>  Are you faglords ready for the next episode with tons of Papi's ass, Smith Legs and HORSE PUSSY? <br><br><br>also  there is any page for the live watch? </br></br></br>      <br>It's the zombie-girl's development arc from Hitomi Sensei.</br>  Can anyone name a better type of monster girl than harpies? Specifically black harpies?    NEXT G<br>http://g-tekketsu.com/</br>  cool  Hope it will be better than the last few Gundam series.  Reconquista　is For children   next g <br>Worry.</br>  Hopefully this Gundam does a football tackle at least once.  Why are you still 3D world, hurry to this side before its too late anon.  Don't worry about me, I already managed to transform into a 2d girl.    <br>yukari isnt real, though</br>  Well, it hasn't been a good life, but I suppose it probably won't get any better from here on out.<br><br>See you soon, anons.</br></br>  <br>I already don't, so now I just have to drink and drive.</br>  what do you do?  Make a thread about it on /a/.  Masturbate.  Source nigger.  Me on the left  <br> you turned into an oppai loli </br>  Read the guide before asking questions <br>buyfag.moe</br>  <br> my world view is so fucked up that I find a blonde haired obese nigger attractive </br>  <br>You'd probably like the anime Popipo</br>  <br><br>I thought it was pretty good. I liked that they actually played Street Fighter and not some Wacdonalds version.</br></br>   cordelia fig <br> "oh cool, i love fire emblem" <br> 168k </br></br>  <br><br> I love Fire Emblem <br><br>And you support Awakening?</br></br></br></br>  i just started this today and holy shit<br><br> when was somebody going to tell me it was so good </br></br>  <br> that moderate aftertaste of strawberry is the only reason I eat this shit <br><br>Okay.</br></br></br>  <br>Wrong.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128053064 <br><br><br><br><br><br>These aren't even spoilers. This shit has been known for literally years.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yamada, this is normal family skinship!</br>  Yamada a shit and useless  We Went to Look at the Stars<br><br>Was pretty underwhelmed by first episode, but the ruler game was somehow exciting, and the origin of Hotarun's crush was very sweet. This episode felt like a return to form to me.<br><br>Any guesses how they'll get motivated during Holiday Break? Natsumi-centric episode next week?<br><br>Non-shit NNB thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   second season does not take place after season 1  <br><br>I don't like this</br></br>  I don't understand.<br><br>For some reason i'm not really enjoying S2, even though it's not different from S1 at all. S1 was my AOTY back then. Why am i not enjoying this as much?</br></br>  <br>I really liked both episodes in this season. I feel like Komari's character is finally falling into place. In S1 she was often used for more standard jokes than the rest of the cast. Same thing with Hotaru's obsession with her. In S1 it was jarringly otaku-ish in an otherwise very grounded series, but this episode was sweet.</br>  <br>Well I was expecting a continuation. Renge's loli-buddy showing up, the girls going on a trip to Tokyo (though that would be great as a longer ova), stuff from S1 forming traditions for the next year.<br><br>It's not bad, but it's a bit disappointing knowing the basic idea of what happens over an entire season from ep 1.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I was expecting (and hoping) for a continuation too, though honestly I don't mind so far. Both episodes of Repeat so far have been fun and adorable</br>  Will you bail out Greek Goddess Hestia?<br><br>or<br><br>Watch her suffer the consequences of not paying denbts.</br></br></br></br>  Outbid the rich guy and fuck her</blockquote>]
