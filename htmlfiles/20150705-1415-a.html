[   <br><br><br>Mah niggas</br></br></br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #4<br><br>Remember to relax, take it easy, and celebrate FREEDOM<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Who is your waifu?</br>  <br> animooted qt waifu  <br><br>Whoa and full color too! I can't wait until Sunday night to say goodbye now; thank you  Kusugu?  </br></br></br>  Requesting Josuke barbecuing steak in an apron that says "Kiss the Pomp".  <br>Oora!</br>  <br>tamabro please continue being a qt</br>  Read the guide before asking questions: http://buyfag.moe<br><br>Previous Thread: </br></br>  <br>then fuck it, get it for free nigga.</br>  <br>it's a private sale if he wanted to cover his arse he should've added tracking himself</br>  <br>It'd be perfect if she was bigger.</br>  <br>What the fuck. You need to email them and ask if that is right. A 14 inch pvc figure should not cost that much with EMS. Unless you are in South America or Asia accoding to their shipping rates. http://www.amiami.com/top/page/t/fa<wbr>q2.html#2<br><br>According to most sites, that megaman figure is 1.3kg or so not including packaging weight. You are getting jewed.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>No, it's on you to choose tracking. You had the option and you declined, now you shouldn't be able to come back crying for a refund.<br>Try taking responsibility for your actions for once. Chances are you'll get it anyway.</br></br>   boy   <br>The first episode was pretty weak, I think even NotAldnoahZero's was better.</br>  <br>Yes<br><br>Some people just can't handle that it was an introductory episode. Make me wonder if they thought it was going to be Another or something</br></br></br>  <br>Trapfags have always been a vocal minority on /a/</br>  <br>Pic completely unrelated</br>  <br>Pic completely related.</br>  Seriously, why Boomer is so underestimated ? I mean, I don't think is weaker than a phantom troup's member. He has one of the best power for a killer and if you don't know his hatsu, he can take you an arm or a leg very easily at the beginning of the fight.  <br>I'm not that anon, and i doubt he's posting you to oppress and harass you either.<br>You're making a huge issue out of someone pointing out that someone else's posts are awful, you should relax a little.</br></br>  <br>that's only true of Gon because he loves him so much it makes him retarded<br>he hasn't pushed anyone else away</br></br>  <br>No it's true for Alluka as well, in fact he's not even close to Palm or Ikalgo, they just happen to be there when he was going through an emotional breakdown.</br>  <br> because he loves him so much <br>Killua was sad, not because Gon was traumatized, but because he couldn't help him.<br>Killua only liked Gon because he felt important to someone else, and went away the minute he focused on something else. Killua is legitimately, objectively, empirically shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Killua wasn't sad that he couldn't help Gon, he was sad because he wasn't the center of Gon's attention.</br>  These are the best selling series of all time.<br><br>Thoughts?</br></br>    <br>All I see is retards like you</br>  <br> best selling anime TV series of all time  <br> hipster bullshit <br><br>I don't think you know what the word means.</br></br></br></br>  are waifus really the only thing people like about monogatari? because i wasnt interested in any of them and was bored out of my fucking mind (dropped after i finished bake, and the only reason i watched that long anyways was because of the podium people hold the series on)<br><br>like jesus at least nge and madoka were interesting</br></br>  <br> inb4 m-muh character development <br><br>then the characters should be interesting</br></br></br>  I just watched the directors cut of episode 12 to prep for insight. Are there really no decent BD releases of the first season? It's been a while already.  <br>true but reddit isn't a cheap Chinese copy of their most popular website.</br>  <br>Japanese interest boards are a minority of boards on 4chan, both in number and in popularity.<br>If 4chan as a whole was wholly dedicated to "otaku culture", then maybe you could argue that despite being a less popular site, Japs might be more familiar with it.<br>But as it stands right now, I doubt even 10% of people who go to 4chan are "weebs".</br></br></br>  <br>Not that guy but to add onto this I should mention there was at least one instance where 2chan linked one of our threads. I think it was regarding symphogear.<br><br>That is possibly one of the smallest pieces of evidence regarding one nation's interest in a website, but I've seen that and I can't say I've seen them do anything like that with reddit.<br><br>Gonna google looking for that</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I doubt even 10% of people who go to 4chan are "weebs" <br>You should try lurking other boards, fast boards.<br>Anime girls and posts like "Who /a/ here" are everywhere. 4chan is a weebsite.</br></br></br>  <br> Not appreciating the Washington Redskins </br>  Episode 7: Chaos! God Cloth VS God Cloth<br><br> With the 7 chambers as the stage, the all-out battle between Gold Saints and God Warriors has finally started. <br> Taurus Aldebaran goes up against the God Warrior Hercules, whom he has fought before. <br> Hercules has become extremely violent from the power of the Odin Sapphire given to him by Andreas. <br> Hercules unleashes a vicious attack, but Aldebaran, after discovering “true strength,” responds with an even greater power. <br> Meanwhile, in the Ice Chamber, a battle of Gold Saints between Shura and Camus has begun. <br> Both men hold their ground, until an extreme battle unfolds from the transformation into God Cloth. <br> Then, AFTER the battle against Miro and Shura, Camus realizes HIS TRUE FEELINGS for God Warrior Surtr, who was his friend. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is this thread still alive? Soul of fat threads cannot last more than the 12 hours in the zodiac clock.  <br>This is an abomination.</br>  Makes as much sense as anything else here.  <br>I'm sure I will enjoy Shaka getting rekt by a nobody :D</br>  <br>It happens all the time.</br>  Finally, a show about bros being bros.  <br>what a manly jaw that small guy got.</br>  Ouran highschool host club meets Sabagebu.<br>Also I don't even know if this shit is supposed to be considered Yaoi or not. You can call it a girl all you want, but that is 100% a boy.<br>I kind of enjoyed it, but there is so much room for them to fuck it up.</br></br>  <br>It's not Yaoi. Episode Two even has Hotaru peeping on girls and shit. <br><br>This isn't /co/. Three guys can be friends without it being gay.</br></br></br>  First episode was pretty mellow and enjoyable. Light friendship, light pandering, light comedy, and decent action scenes. It doesn't overreach by dwelling on anything too long or relying on one element to appeal.<br><br><br>It had a nice mix of omnipandering thanks to reverse trap being breastgroped by pink slut and lipfondled by fuccboi slut.</br></br></br>  I couldn't resist making another  <br>Nope, most of us do not.<br>But making comparisons don't do harm.</br></br>  <br><br> le maymay bait of volume 8 </br></br>  <br> I have no arguments so I call their comments memes <br>alright delusionfag</br></br>  <br>That's why Iroha was in the final scene right? <br>That's why Iroha had barely any scenes in Vol11?<br>Do you actually think she's a main character on par with YY?</br></br></br>  <br> Iroha is probably the most genuine relationship 8man has <br>This keeps getting funnier every time I see it.</br></br>  Which Karlsland witch is the hottest and why is it Marseille?  <br>That isn't going to help.</br>  <br>She did nothing wrong!</br>  <br><br> Dominant Lynne <br>That's kind of hot to imagine, you think Lynne would be like that in the bedroom or would she be her usually submissive self?</br></br></br>  <br>But you have to imagine.</br>  <br><br>She'd probably trick you into thinking she's submissive then turn the tables surprisingly in an unexpected manner.</br></br>   you will never wake up to sabers' voice knowing that she watched and protected you while you were asleep. <br>There really is no point in living is there?</br>   Saber dies in every relevant ending <br><br>So much for strongest servant.</br></br>    <br> Gilgamesh invading Caster's temple </br>  <br>well according to Hollow Ataraxia, thats what happened, he showed up at the Ryuudou temple, killed Assassin and kuzuki, and caster ran away to the emiya household for the scene where caster and Gil first appear on the fate route</br>  <br>It'd be an interesting way to introduce him for the Fate route.</br>  old thread <br><br><br>soon</br></br></br>  <br>Your point?</br>  <br>No, jacking off once a week is weak.</br>    <br>Whoosh.</br>  <br>doesn't that mean not good</br>   it's a "Madoka teaches the girls about American culture" episode <br><br>Seriously, why is Gen such a hack? I mean the Thanksgiving episode was pretty good due to the Sayaka-Homura truce shenanigans but the July 4th, MLK day, and handegg episodes were utter shit. UTTER SHIIIIIIIIIIIIT</br></br>  <br>Hello.</br>  <br>Too much freedom is going on outside right now.</br>  <br>Ugh...</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> &gt;it's a "Madoka teaches the girls about American culture" episode <br> American culture <br> FREEDOM culture <br><br>Hmm...</br></br></br></br></br>   wanted sci-fi or /m/ <br> knights of sidonia season 1 was okay <br> mfw this shit <br>Convince me not to drop season 2 right now</br></br></br>  <br> what does Sol mean? <br>Slice of life</br></br>  <br>It's not even about being special, it's just that it fits very well with the themes and doesn't feel tacked on or excessive. The 908497862 scenes of moe Tsumugi making squeaky balloon sounds don't really bring anything.</br>  <br>  3D <br>  Anime <br>Choose one</br></br></br>  <br>it was awful at first but you get used to it pretty quickly and tbh space scenes are gr8</br>  <br>Nah, I don't think so. Why would he answer Nagate's question with something completely unrelated, especially since Nagate has no idea Kanata even exists in the first place at this point?</br></blockquote>]
