[  Precure thread   I want to pafu Pafu's pafus.  I'm going to marry Haruharu!    I want to undress Towa.  Haruka is a unique and interesting character in her own right who even now continues to fail and work hard to overcome that and achieve her dream.  I really can't bring myself to like Minami no matter how much I try. She's quite honestly, boring as fuck and it's easy to tell that even the staff itself does not care about doing anything with her.<br><br>Maybe they will do something with her in the future, but by them, I'd be way too far for me to start caring.<br><br>One is supposed to want to see more development or an end of a character arc during those stages, not to want for anything to be done with the character itself.</br></br></br></br>  If anyone says anything bad about Mana in this thread I'm going to cry.  <br>I'm so glad Minami got the short end of the stick instead of Kirara.</br>  <br>Funny faces don't make you unique or interesting unless you're Erika.</br>  I want to like Gopri, but I know Kirara's not gonna have much screeentime or relevancy to the overall plot other than being the yellow cure.  <br>Mana a shit. A SHIT.</br>  1-hour drawing incoming.<br><br>Last thread was kinda too heated, so I waited until this new thread. So, today has a pair theme with the following pairs being the attention: Mushiban &amp; Sirloin  (what the hell is this kind of name?) , Momozono Love &amp; Aono Miki, Kenzaki Makoto &amp; Davi, Tsumugi &amp; Zeke, Pafu &amp; Aroma.<br><br>http://sakuramochi.mydns.jp/precure<wbr>/1draw-collections/date/2015-07-11?<wbr>lang=en<br>http://togetter.com/li/846033?lang=<wbr>en</wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Erika wasn't very interesting asides being comedy relief.</br>  <br>We are literally getting a Kirara + Towa arc just now. I'm not sure what more else you fucks could want. Be grateful because had this been another series none of the girls but Haruka would have interacted with Towa in any meaningful way.<br><br>At this point I'm still amazed people bitch and complain about muh screentime and muh relevancy for non-pinks after 3 fucking years of Precure being PINK, PINK, PINK.<br><br>Maybe things will change next year now that that chucklefuck of Shibata will probably finally be gone but just in-case mentally condition yourself to pre-emptively like next year Pink the most. You'll get all your screentime and relevancy that way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, but it means that it will have the classic archetypes that little girls like, there are literally no cure that isn't an achetype, the important is the execution.<br><br><br>That is your opinion.<br>Personally I never liked the genky archetype and I love the silent introvert girl archetype.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> arc </br>  <br>Yes, arc. If you had bothered to read the spoilers you'd see it's like 3 episodes of nothing but Kirara + Towa.</br>   the redemption of kid with huge chin <br>how</br>  <br>Kirara and Towa are roommates. With Towa being the second most important Gopri Cure after Haruka that means Kirara is sure to gain more relevance than she currently has.</br>  <br>I love how she chases after her childish dream wholeheartedly, and puts in the effort necessary. Unlike what people guessed at the beginning, she doesn't keep jumping from thing to thing, and is focusing on mainly violin and ballet, not tennis or tea pouring or whatever. I like how much she values her bond with Kanata, and how last episode when she wanted to save Towa, it wasn't because of some sense of justice or wanting to fight against Dyspear, it was simply because she wanted to keep her promise with Kanata. I like her antics and clumsiness, and how she doesn't immediately win everyone over. Does she share traits with past pink cures? Of course, that's why she's the leader, but it's her specific personality and combination that makes her Haruno Haruka.</br>  <br> she wanted to keep her promise with Kanata.  <br>I liked this part too.</br></br>  <br><br>Even the Crimson Chin admitted his wrongdoings.</br></br>  Favorite silly Precure fanart? I really like this one, the way the skin is drawn looks very soft and smooth. Like a marshmallow.  <br>What? Smile gave good screentime to Miyuki, Yayoi and Akane; only Nao and Reika got shafted. Only DD and HaCha's second half were PINK PINK PINK.</br>    Fresh: KANPEKI and Animal Girl get shafted<br>Hearcatch: Itsuki gets shafted after Moonlight joins<br>Suite: Kanade gets shafted<br>Smile: Nao and Reika get shafted<br>DD: There are characters not named Mana?<br>HaCha: Everyone but Hime gets shafted in the first half, everyone but Gumi gets shafted in the second half</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really like this one.</br>  <br>Sounds about right.</br>  <br>This.<br>What makes Haruno good isn't her super original archetype, but the way she has been handled.</br></br>  <br>This one.</br>  <br>This is completely unrealistic</br>    <br>Oh wait, I missed the word "silly". If so, this one.</br>  I know an easy way for a young girl like Towa to earn some money...guehuehue.    <br>Which shafted Cure hurts you the most?</br>  <br>I was about to get mad thinking you thought her suffering was silly, but then I saw you posted , which is cute.<br><br> Peace signs <br>Can't stop associating it with hentai, though the art is high quality.</br></br></br></br>  <br>White.</br>    Some nice one-draws today.      <br>Nao and Reika.<br><br>I'm still mad about no NaoRei episode. God, I fucking hate Yonemura so much.</br></br></br>  <br>Rikka and Minami.</br>  <br>Hime.</br>  <br> Hime <br> shafted </br></br>    <br>I want to impregnate Reika.</br>  <br>We all want.</br>  Reika is top gang bang material.    I want to save Reika from neethood.  Daily Minamin!!  If you had the skills to draw any precure art you wanted what would you draw?  <br>porn</br>  <br>Yayoi doing yayoi things.</br>  <br>Iona as the aunt to me and Maria's kids. That or me married to an adult Rikka/Towa/Iona.</br>  <br><br>Tons of futa porn.  Including futa-on-male. </br></br>  <br> vanilla  porn</br>  <br>A good wallpaper of Precure Rainbow Rose Explotion, since it is imposible to find one.</br>  <br>Cute girls doing cute things, like this. I love this artist and his Cure cats so much.</br>          <br> This late already <br>Fuck</br></br>    <br>On-time Bukki is best Bukki!</br>  I haven't watched this since episode 12. Did they handle the bad guy switching sides thing better than in Fresh?    <br> everyone makes a big fucking deal about Kayano <br> after she starts going to school nobody really gives a shit </br></br>  <br>What makes this way more bearable than HaCha's/Ace's make up?</br>  <br>shit taste</br>  <br>I wouldn't say better than Fresh. But not a terrible blunder either. Interestingly enough she seems to be the Yellow's companion rather than the Pink's.</br>  <br>She's a toppu moderu.</br>      <br>Ace had nice looking make up though.</br>  <br>I'd shaft Nao and Reika if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>Kirara x Minamin confirmed.</br>  <br><br>She learned from the best.</br></br>  <br>But the spoilers say it's actually Kirara x Towa. I'm confused.</br>  <br>Kirara aint no one-woman gal.</br>   lez-baba   <br>Thank you for posting my favorite GoPri daily.</br>  What would you teach Towa in modern world?   no elf jokes pls   <br>sex</br>  <br>The pleasure of being cummed inside.</br>  <br><br>Do you think that they don't know how to make love in Hope kingdom?</br></br>  <br>camwhoring</br>  Wow was there ever a lot of bile during the livewatch.  <br>I mean. Maybe.<br><br>Towa and Kanata are clearly from different parents. Maybe they were adopted from a neighboring kingdom.</br></br></br>  <br>Good thing I missed it then.</br>  <br>I guess it's the one time of week there's a real risk of it looking like /a/ in here.</br>  <br>Don't kid yourself. This shithole isn't any better than /a/.</br>  <br>I strongly disagree.</br>  <br>you were probably one of those douchebags stinking up the thread last night, weren't you</br>    <br>Why are suffering Precure so arousing?</br>  <br>Because you are bad person</br>    <br>It's okay, anon. I'm a bad person too. Let's just stay inside and make sure society doesn't have to deal with us too much before we die, okay?</br>    <br>gross</br>    <br><br><br>Shut up, nerd.</br></br></br>  <br>Lots of All Star stuff, just things between the Cures of various series.</br>  <br>Good thing I was there to fight the shitposters.</br>    <br>I like how most of those fairy dolls are about the actual size they would be save for Sharuru who voices Haru Haru.<br><br>How much for a sloppy one with that make-up on?</br></br></br>  <br>I really want to fuck that cardboard cutout of Cure Honey.</br>  <br>I really miss when Hime was the star of HaCha</br>  <br>Hime did everything wrong and was undeserving as a main character. Why would you open the box of all evil?</br>  <br>We all do, anon. I think maybe she charged my happiness too much and broke it so now it's leaking all the time and making me sad.</br>  <br><br>I really want to fuck that Towa kig.</br></br>    <br>Hah. I totally see it. I love Erikas hair.</br>  <br> Wow was there ever a lot of bile during the livewatch. <br><br>Weren't they just waiting for DBS?</br></br></br>  <br>Cure Seaweed.<br>Or maybe Aquamarine</br></br>  please do not rape the haruharu  <br><br>That's probably for the best. The pressure and attention was one of the reasons she got her anxiety disorder in the first place.</br></br>  Holy shit I fucking love Doremi, thank you precure thread.   Open new ep <br> See this <br> What do? </br></br>    <br/>  <br>the thumb goes in the hole<br>it's a metaphor for  sex </br></br>  http://www.amiami.com/top/detail/de<wbr>tail?gcode=FIG-COL-9288&amp;</wbr>  <br> sex <br>That thing with the tambourine?</br></br>  Which cure would be least shocked if you came up behind her loud enough for her to hear and suddenly applied a well-lubricated shocker?    <br>You mean like a defibrillator? I'd say Peace would be the least shocked, since she is the one used to it the most.</br>  <br><br>I love Mana :((</br></br>  <br>No, that's not what I meant at all, but I still think you might be correct.</br>    <br>Thank you Haruyama</br>  <br>I called that gap being too large, sasuga haruyama.</br>  Precure one-hour draw:<br><br>http://sakuramochi.mydns.jp/precure<wbr>/1draw-collections/date/2015-07-12<br><br>The theme is Haruno Haruka. Again, meh.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> Putting Towa in Kirara's room <br>Big Mistake<br>In a matter of time, she will be ....</br></br></br>  So here are the unconfirmed toy spoilers. There's no image or anything, but the fact that multiple very similar information popped up around different websites gives them some degree of credibility, kind of.<br><br> September 12: Music Princess Palace <br> November 7: Royal Dress-up Key(s), Music Princess Palace + Royal Dress-up Key set <br> The palace looks like the picture of the Hope Kingdom used in the anime and it's a music box. <br> There are 4 slots for the keys. <br> If you rotate a certain part of the palace, the door opens. <br> If you spin the music box mechanism a rainbow colored light illuminates the door and the melody starts. <br> If you insert the 4 keys and spin the music box mechanism the melody changes and the voice track with the finishing move starts playing (Resonate! Power of all*! Precure Eclair Espoir!). <br> If you put the individual dress-up keys (sold separately) in the center, the respective finishing move voice plays. <br> 8 game modes to play with the music, the keys and the other toys (perfumes, crystal rods, violin). <br><br>*I'm aware this sounds rather horrible in English, but that's literally what it says, it's not "the power of us 4", or "the power of everyone", it's literally "the power of everything/all"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Haruharu a cutest pink!<br><br>I like this kind of thing, art of civ form and cure forms together.</br></br></br>  <br>Improved? Bettered? Enriched?</br>  <br>Is it wrong to hope for an idol song finisher?</br>  <br>Haruharu a leggiest Precure!</br>  <br>If we get more spoilers it will probably become apparent whether the "melody" is an actual song or not. I'd certainly like hearing Miyukichi singing voice.</br>  How do you have a breakfast as a princess?<br>- Yui's style<br>Ham and Egg, Potato Salad &amp; Bread<br>- Haruka's style<br>Katsu and Rice, Miso Soup &amp; Salad</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is she eating a Japanese meal with a knife and fork?</br>  <br>Princesses don't eat with sticks.</br>  <br> Resonate! Power of all* <br><br>You're right that does sound weird. I wonder what sort of fun Commie will have with it.</br></br></br>  <br> -Southern European style: a couple of biscuits/bread with jam and/or fruit with either coffee/coffee with milk/milk or just water. <br>Otherwise I'd rather starve.</br></br>    <br>Pancakes with homemade syrup and at least one of my friends (must be wearing cute outfit) accompanying me out on the veranda. No boys allowed.</br>  <br>A bowl of cereal/apple cinnamon flavored oatmeal. Alternatively orange juice, eggs, bacon, grits, and biscuits.</br>      <br>SUTEKI!</br>  <br><br>So, the power up toy is gonna be a doll house?</br></br>  why was this not a movie  What is she implying?  <br><br>Just a wild guess, but I'd say she's talking about Kirara's ability to take three at once. She's talking about donuts, of course.</br></br>  <br>Did you watch the Motto movie yet? It's pretty good.</br>  <br>It was okay</br>  <br>It's probably too small to even fit nendoroids in it.</br>  <br>That's a fun Hana episode though. The one with her and the dog right? I remember thinking it was super super cute when she was riding him and then when he saved her. There's lots of fun Hana stuff in Dokkan too.</br>  <br>Not to mention the Hana and Pop episode in Na-i-sho.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9E2<wbr>IfmU-9-Q</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>When are we going to do something like this? Except maybe with Gopri.</br></br>  How does one manage to be more of a alien than Mako3.14?  <br>She's probably never seen a truck before.</br>  <br> BRAAAAAAACKUUUUUUUUUUUUUU <br>Gets me everything</br></br>  <br>BRAKU will never not make me laugh<br><br>I must see this then.<br>Because I think most thought that MakoP had full blown Assburgers even when it came to stuff from the Trump Kingdom.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least she can read and learn. Wait, how did she get that book if she had no money?</br>  <br>The officer probably gave it to her so she doesn't get run down by a Japanese Truck</br>  <br><br>I'd be down to produce/contribute it, but I doubt anyone else is willing to submit recordings.</br></br>  <br> a Japanese Truck <br>She really didn't realize just how dangerous of a situation she was in. Those things are much more fearsome than the villains.</br></br>  <br>Villains can be fought at least.<br>Japanese Truck will just appear if you happen to be around a road and will wreck your shit.</br></br>  I'm not sure why I like the Doki episode title cards so much, but I do. Cute little ditty, the character montage, I know it's nothing special but I find myself looking forward to it.  Did you hear that, /pc/? Rikka's smart, so it must be true.  <br>She's right, Mana is an object that everyone owns.</br>  <br>Rikka is an object I want to own.</br>  What good is being smart if you're not going to actually use your brains?<br><br><br>A few days ago I'd be with you but I'm teetering right now. Regina is such an awful little brat but I feel myself strangely drawn to her all the same.</br></br></br>  <br> A few days ago I'd be with you but I'm teetering right now. Regina is such an awful little brat but I feel myself strangely drawn to her all the same. <br><br>Mana is that you?</br></br></br>  <br> Regina is such an awful little brat but I feel myself strangely drawn to her all the same. <br>Anon, I think it simply because you are a lolicon.</br></br>  <br>Nah, I just like broken things.</br>  <br>Why not have both?</br>  They went through a lot of trouble to show that this whole back-and-forth wasn't supposed to be a deep and nefarious plot, it's an awfully big commitment that kind of makes me wonder how long they'll do this for.  And I can see why the Ace thing probably stings a lot more because of it...   Oh great, not this shit again. And just when we finally got another school episode.  <br>whoops, image</br>  <br>Treasure that episode. It's the last one Marina ever gets</br>  TUXEDO KAMEN!<br><br>Er, I mean... ONII-SAN!<br><br>I know it's different, but it's still more than a little convenient.</br></br></br></br>  Will he die next? <br>From what we saw this episode he seems stronger and more evil than Dyspear.</br>  <br>They have some fun with this in about four episodes.</br>  <br>I thought he was going to be the final villain, as did some others here, but I'm pretty sure now that he isn't, he "revealed his true self" too early. Still not sure whether he or Shut will die first either.</br>  <br> not voiced by Erika <br> not even cheeky </br></br>  <br>What? No! It can't be! And it was just getting good with cows and male friendship!</br>  <br>We need to execute all soccer fucking shits in Doremi<br>Nothing good comes of them<br>I suggest starting with Kotake</br></br></br>  <br>Why Dyspear get out?</br>  <br> &gt;Ugly </br>  <br>There is an episode of Dokkan which seems like it was originally going to be a movie but they decided against it for some reason. <br><br>The staff was like three times as big.</br></br></br>  <br>Her story didn't get resolved properly just 2 second still with her family.</br>  A princess and a tomboy?! That's preposterous.<br><br><br>How stronger? If you're talking about beating them off individually, Twilight did that pretty handily too, even if they asspulled the ending of that fight. It's a bit of a shame they couldn't have just left that one, I think it would've been a better build-up.</br></br></br>  <br>That was her motivation, her development was independent of it.</br>  I have literally no idea who this guy is<br>I wanted Fumihiko Tachiki, he did good replacing Matsuo as the dad in Super Gals</br>  What if he's Dune 2.0?  <br>Toe would die.</br>  <br>Did you watch Na-i-sho yet?</br>    <br>Series chronology is for gays<br>Production order is the best order</br></br>    <br>True but her goal was to save her kingdom and family. I atleast wanted a good reunion with Hime and her parents. Maybe they mention how much she has grown as a person.</br>  <br>Actually production order is for people with autism. But whatever. Enjoy it however you want.</br>  <br>What is Sango doing in Doremi?</br>  <br>I bet you watch Haruhi in chronological order too.</br>  <br> No one will ever say this to you </br>    <br>I watched that as it was airing so I didn't. Sorry.</br>  <br> muh ultimate dis pear <br>I will enjoy it properly</br></br>   that Minamean   <br>Well you're not enjoying the story properly. You're just going along with your weird autism to watch them in the order they were made, instead of the order in which the story progresses. Like that's gonna enhance the experience for you or something. <br><br>But like, it's not REALLY important. You'll just be happy instead of sad when you finish it.</br></br></br>  When did you realize that Reika is actually a qt and barely a bitch at all?  It's actually more laziness then straight up autism. You can't be bothered to figure out when to watch Naisho in the middle of Motto, so you just save it for last. I bet you don't watch the movies until the end too.  <br> Kirara and Hime have the same exact face on both shots <br>Soul sisters.</br></br>  <br>During the first season in the episode about her dad.</br>  I'm not sure this is worth arguing about.    <br>Subs when?</br>  <br><br>Okay nerds, I will be the lazy autist and you can have fun watching Gundam and Votoms in the order that the events happen because that's how it was meant to viewed. You win<br><br><br>She was always cute</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree.</br>  <br>If this is a burn I don't get it. <br><br>Would watching Gundam in order of events somehow ruin the experience?</br></br></br>   Poor little Red Princess   <br>Absolutely hidoi. As expected of the worst ojamajo.</br>  <br>General powerup is kind of deathflag. I don't like it because then the villain band will consist just a Shut which sucks.<br><br> stronger and more evil than Dyspear. <br>Dyspear can create powerfull artifacts and negated trio finisher without sweating.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey, in terms of suffering she at least beats out Hana. I was fully expecting that  elephant to die. </br>  <br>We're done arguing so I'd rather not explain, but if you must know, it would entail watching a 39 ep TV series or 3 movies, then a 13 ep OVA made 15 years after the TV series, then watching a four episode OVA made a decade after the TV series, then a 13 episode series made after the 4 ep OVA, then a 50 episode TV series made eight or nine years after the TV series, then a 40 some episode series that immediately came out after the last TV series, then a movie that comes immediately after that, and then you go and watch a seven episode OVA that was made fifteen years after this last movie, after this you go watch another movie made after the last movie and then you go read a manga about pirates before watching another 40 some ep TV series made after that last movie<br><br>Gundam is an extreme, but the point is if something is good enough for little girls it's a good enough way to watch for me</br></br></br>    <br>I dunno I think it being so extreme kinda hurts your point. <br>Doremi is just "watch these episodes in the middle of season three and then continue as normal". <br><br>And ideally those Naisho episodes would have been in Motto to begin with. They're just stories they thought of later and don't really build on anything plot related. Like I said, it really doesn't matter beyond how you wanna feel when you finish it. Saying one is better than the other isn't worth arguing about.</br></br></br></br>     2015 <br> Still arguing about when to watch Naisho <br><br>Bitch please I watched that shit in the middle of season 1 because it was all we had.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Aroma a cute.<br><br>A CUTE.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I had to watch something out of order because nothing else was subbed <br><br>That's your own fault and not relevant. <br>Also the argument was over.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Naisho was subbed way before my time. Goodness how the years fly by, huh?</br>  <br>aroma a fat</br>  <br>The real question is when we're gonna get those awful Doremi 16 novels translated fully.</br>  <br>Nah, the real question is when am I gonna get off my lazy ass to finish the v2s. The novels would be up to Lad or Mace I guess. I'll bug them later and see if they are interested.</br>  <br>It has some high tier drawings.</br>  What's an accent consultant?  <br>They  can't use magic and everyone except Doremi and Onpu all have boyfriends is all I know about it. Maybe the drama is good. </br>  <br>Awful in what way? Is this a Gogo situation again where one person says it's bad until everyone can read it?</br>  <br>What about the audio dramas</br>  <br>A long story. The gist of it is I had a guy helping me re-write some of Aiko's lines because I wanted to put her accent back in. It was present in Neclos's releases, but once Lad took over, pretty much vanished. Then the guy lost interest and the idea kinda got pushed aside.<br><br>Come v2 though, I've been tweaking Aiko's lines a bit more.<br><br><br>No plans, currently.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Daily Minamin!!  <br>That's a shame.</br>  <br>I can talk to Lad and Mace and see if they are interested sometime.</br>  Did they change the music composer mid season?<br>The new tracks sound very different from what we had these last three seasons.</br>  <br>Hey I don't know if these things are actually good so don't stress about it too much.</br>  <br>What the fuck is that microphone and karaoke machine guy lol<br><br>Yeah I'm not too worried about the supplementary stuff like the drama CDs. Our main goal has always been to get the anime subbed and we did that. Since I'm a hopeless loser and can't escape from this amazing show, now it's all over again with the v2s.</br></br></br>  Too lewd for Kiriya.  Actually while I'm here, has anyone been watching and enjoying the v2s? Does anyone really give two shits? I don't have a good gauge for what the overall response to them has been, I've just been releasing episodes then moving on to the next. Anything good, bad, indifferent to say?  <br>I would drink beer with her.</br>  <br>I wish I saw them<br>I bet they have even more banter TL notes and denotations of what episode something happened when characters talk about it</br></br>  <br>I appreciate the effort, but I'm not personally watching them. <br><br>Hey if you have a good RAW for the first movie I wouldn't mind it though.</br></br></br>  <br>No, heh, I've been removing a lot of really unnecessary notes and other stupid shit. I don't like TL notes, so I've avoided them when possible, and if something has to be explained, I try to have one or two words in parenthesis in the line, or on top.<br><br>I honestly forgot that stupid shit like in that screenshot slipped through. I apologize for that.<br><br><br>That's fair. It's a hard pill to swallow, rewatching a 200+ episode series, but there was a LOT of early stuff I was not satisfied with, especially since how the very early S1 episodes conflict with later episodes due to improved translations and whatnot, so part of the goal was to go back and fix that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>10/10 Of course I appreciate it!</br>  <br>I've started watching Doremi because of those v2s and will watch through it with those.<br><br>Thanks Doremi.</br></br></br>  <br>I I haven't watched them beyond just checking out the technical quality. Already watched everything up to the middle of Naisho (Naisho is really good). I do badger newcomers to get it over the old releases though. I have S1 downloaded and seeded to 40+ though. I'll check out the first episode tomorrow, because it's a really nice episode.</br>  <br>I don't even remember any translation errors from the first season.<br><br>Only animation errors.</br></br></br>  <br>But I like them<br>I don't wanna watch Precure if you guys don't do that, I need my guidance and wisdom and bantz from the top of the screen</br></br>  <br>I sort of like them. Gives the feeling that the guys working on it were young and unreserved.</br>  <br>What about TV-Nihon?</br>  <br>Awesome, thanks for your support.<br><br><br>Also awesome. Glad to see new people getting into it.<br><br><br>Oh, well, we haven't done Naisho v2s yet, just S1 and the first tiny bit of Sharp. Let me know how S1 looks to you.<br><br><br>There were a handful, such as the Witch World being called the Magic Kingdom, Witch Frogs being called Magic Frogs during the -entire- series, the Magical Stage spells being untranslated (The final word is an actual word, as opposed to magical gibberish), and lines that while they may not have been -wrong- they were just lacking a bit of polish or detail.<br><br><br>lol<br><br><br>The guy who added that line is like 45+. Still though, most of us were pretty young when we were doing this show. I worked on it through half of high school and all of college, pretty much.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Aishiteru.  <br> &gt;Naisho V2 will get released after Dokkan V2 as a big fuck you to antiproduction order fags  <br><br>Calling it. <br><br> This is a joke by the way. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Heh. You're actually partly right. Naisho v2 will be last yes, but that's primarily due to technical reasons. I need to source out better raws and we're missing like half of the original scripts, so those either have to be dug up from the netherrealm of Mace's/Lad's computer or remade from scratch. Most of them were remade a few years ago, but we're still missing some.</br>  <br> There were a handful, such as the Witch World being called the Magic Kingdom, Witch Frogs being called Magic Frogs during the -entire- series, the Magical Stage spells being untranslated (The final word is an actual word, as opposed to magical gibberish), and lines that while they may not have been -wrong- they were just lacking a bit of polish or detail. <br><br>So nothing actually offensively bad</br></br></br>  Erika no Tsubomi  <br>Why not just set up a donate thing for people to just buy you the DVDs? <br><br>And unlike with TV-N we know you'll actually release something once you get the money.</br></br></br>  <br> I want to use magic to help them, but that's now allowed. <br><br>Aside from a now/not typo (in regards to mind control magic) in Sharp 4, no, nothing super bad. The only other really bad mistranslation I can think of was in Onpu's debut episode, where her skipping over exams was kinda glossed over and not really articulated properly. Ironically, the 4kids dub of all things alerted me to the kinda ech lines.<br><br><br>Nah, our new raw guy for the v2 project, Puto, is a fucking sorcerer and has the entire series on DVD. Pretty sure he has Naisho too, but if not, I know he can get it, so we're covered. He's just been very busy the last few months due to his new job and other anime projects, so he can only get out about 2 newly encoded Ojamajo episodes per week. The man's help has been most welcome, though.<br><br>Damn captcha expiring.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I guess I'm just used to truly, awful subs, for old Toku shows. So nothing in Doremi V1 really stood out as being poorly subbed. <br>...I don't even remember Onpus voice in the 4kidz version. Only Aikos screeching. And Doremi making fart noises.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, you'd only really notice some of the less-good lines in the v1s if you knew what you were looking for or if you had an average grasp of Japanese. Really it's just cases of "Oh, the subtitle is kind of a paraphrased, less-detailed version of the dialog" or it's reworded slightly differently. It's definitely not Toku quality haha.<br><br>I don't remember Onpu's voice either and I'm glad that I don't. Aiko's screeching straight up gave me a fucking headache. I honestly don't think I got through a single full episode.</br></br></br>    <br>I am erect.</br>  <br>I had the hardest fucking time finding Motto RAWs, I ended up downloading this 24 part Rapidshare thing over like a three day period. I still haven't found a creditless version of the second OP for Motto.</br>  <br><br>I wish I could remember where we got our original Motto raws. I know that I got a set of raws from Tokyo Toshokan, and they were originally going to be used in the v2 project before Puto showed up.</br></br>  I nearly forgot it's Sunday.<br>Will we ever see my Angel again?</br>  <br>Perfect threesome</br>  I swear this thing looks less and less like a bow and more like something else entirely every time I see it.  <br>No. She's a fuckng shit.</br>  <br>Considering tennis guy will be back, Ranko will probably be back too.</br>  <br>I want to drink her first period.</br>  <br>The heart shape at the other end is my favorite feature.</br>  <br>It actually looks like Salami there.<br><br>Where did we here that?<br>Nip TV Guide or whatever that told us there would be swimsuits and Pafu and Aroma's Human Forms?<br><br>Okay but I call  Her First Kiss </br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>What could she be reading?</br>  <br>It was in the latest magazine spoilers, I don't know which mag exactly.

Should be getting a new one end of the month iirc. Then the wait for subbing begins.</br>  <br>Considering how many OVA's we've gotten it'd be more like season 4.</br>  Was it autism?<br><br>Also, did they just undo the "Vegeta accepts Kakarots strength" plotline for like the third time?<br><br>Also, was this entire episode a slideshow? Fucking hell Toei.<br><br>Dragonball Super 002</br></br></br></br></br></br>  just because Goku is stronger doesn't mean he won't want to overcome that.<br><br>Saiyan's be all about overcoming obstacles.</br></br>  <br> Also, was this entire episode a slideshow? Fucking hell Toei. <br>you didnt expect anything better did you?<br><br>They animated the snake fight in episode 1</br></br></br></br>   Your face when that Caveman creature was probably stronger than Freiza   How is [inert]'s release    Is it true the manga is monthly?    <br>comprehendible mostly</br>  I don't think Vegeta was accepting that Goku was stronger than him during the Kid Buu fight. He was more realizing why Goku was strong.  <br>yeah</br>  <br>Damn then the show will surely surpass it quickly</br>  <br>Like he finally realized why Goku is far stronger than him, but that doesn't mean he's going to stop trying to surpass him anyway.</br>  Why is Dragonball even a thing anymore? Even Z lost its luster pretty quickly because it was the same old routine of<br> strong villain appears <br> heroes are defeated <br> heroes receive powerup, beat villain <br> villain receives powerup, beats heroes <br>ad infinitum<br><br>They reached so many new transformation stages for the saiyans that reaching a new stage isn't even anything special anymore.<br><br>The whole show is just a parade for old characters we grew fond of for the sake of nostalgia.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree with you but I'm basically watching for the slice of life stuff</br>  <br> never killed his enemies <br> Piccolo, Raditz, how he thought a Spirit Bomb would just really hurt Vegeta is beyond me, Freiza <br><br>You might wanna actually sit down and talk with Kakarot about his childhood sometime Vegeta.<br><br> Vegeta's face when he finds out a little girl android is stronger than Goku <br><br>I dunno which would bother him more, the little girl bit or the android part.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he finally realized why Goku is far stronger than him, but that doesn't mean he's going to stop trying to surpass him anyway. <br> Just because you're right doesn't make you right! </br></br>  Since the afterlife fillers never happened in Kai, wasn't King Kai revived by the dragonballs when everyone killed by Cell was revived?  <br>yup should have ended in freeza</br>  <br>Nostalgia</br>  If the manga passes the anime which it already has what are they basing this on<br><br>Why have the manga lag so far behind?</br></br>  <br>This follows the anime, and in the anime he chose to stay dead</br>  <br>Does it matter?<br><br>That is after all, a promotional manga.<br><br>It's not like actual Toriyama manga.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This<br>Goku was stronger at that time and Vegeta accepted it, but Vegeta pride wont stop him from training to be the best</br></br>  <br>is super just a prequel to the lord beerus movie? i dont get it. why is beerus talking like he hasnt fought ss god yet. the movie are out.</br>  <br><br><br>The manga isn't meant to be a substitute for the show; it's just promotional material, a teaser for things to come. The manga will likely just skip ahead instead of following the story linearly. <br><br>This isn't like the other shows, Toriyama is pretty much dictating everything directly to the anime staff, instead of the anime staff just working off his manga and occasionally asking him questions. The manga is based off scraps and scribbles of pre-production animation work. and it's drawn by a mimic-Toriyama artist.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is absolutely no reason to think that</br>  <br>That's what I wanna know. It seems like they're going to retread covered ground.</br>  <br>god you fate secondaries are fucking thick<br>that line referred to logic and morality</br></br>  <br><br>For the 17th time, Super is gonna retell the movies and then go to an alternate universe.</br></br>  <br><br>Not quite a prequel. Super is adapting the events of the two films into arcs, but there will be discrepancies between how things happened in the movies and how they will happen in the show. So Super is basically forming it's own timeline of events independent of the movies, and the goal is to tie this stuff all together and move beyond it.</br></br>  <br> toriyama is dictating everything <br>Yeah,no. He did the basic plot outline and the designs,nothing more.</br></br>  Subs when?<br><br>Dubs when?</br></br>  <br> an entire episode of tsundere Vegeta <br><br>I fucking love Super</br></br></br>  <br>[citation needed]</br>  Revival of F when?  <br>I hope never<br>but most likely in 15 episodes or so</br></br>  how can anyone NOT love Vegeta?  <br> &gt;Vegeta's face when he finds out a little girl android is stronger than Goku <br> I dunno which would bother him more, the little girl bit or the android part. <br>HOW LONG UNTIL THIS HAPPENS</br></br></br>  <br>I might've been overreaching when I said "dictating everything". Scene composition, visuals, and choreography probably have more of the directors, key animators and storyboarders hands in them than Toriyama, but he definitely has more involvement than a basic plot outline. Especially with Kaio making shitty puns like "Heiwa ga hei wa!"</br>  How come no decent sub group has picked this up?  <br>He accepted his strength. That doesn't mean he won't want to surpass it. <br><br>Did you miss that he reiterated the Numbah Wan speech from Kid Boo fight?</br></br></br>  <br>No one except spics give a shit about DBS</br>  <br>He is the ultimate manlet tsun and I love him dearly.</br>  <br><br>I wonder how many times I'm gonna have to post this link that tells the whole initial plot<br><br>http://www.kanzenshuu.com/2015/07/0<wbr>1/dragon-ball-super-complete-showca<wbr>se-event-reveals-series-plot/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> How come no decent sub group has picked this up? <br>http://the-moonlighters.ml/pelican/<wbr>dragon-ball-super-001.html<br><br>These guys are a good group</br></br></wbr></br></br>   on vacation with his family <br> all he can think about is Goku </br>  <br>Dragon Team. They are slow to release, but they understand the series and have better translations for Super than you'll find for just about any other series. They are great.<br>http://the-moonlighters.ml/pelican/<wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> Two days is slow to release <br>Come on man.</br></br>  <br> Also, was this entire episode a slideshow? <br>Was there anything that particularly needed to be animated besides the fights?<br><br>This part was pretty good</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They're okay. They don't translate enough proper nouns and leave honorifics in, though, which is entirely unnecessary.</br></br>  <br>That fucking sucks. I wanted to read manga week to week to see what would happen ahead of time</br>  <br><br>What a badass<br><br>Now, I want to see more of him. T_T</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, I was around when they were Baaro-subs and were doing Kai, and they would go weeks without releases sometimes. In fact, they never actually finished Kai.</br>  What the fuck is wrong with Bulma? Why is she even with Vegeta who clearly doesn't like other people, especially humans? This whole thing is just reinforcing the stereotype that women go after the assholes.  People bitched about Bingo Vegeta.<br><br>They retconed the old one.</br></br>  <br>No, it reinforces that fact that morons fall for tsunderes.</br>  <br>Considering the alternatives, I'm not really bothered by that at all. Even Funimation's official subtitles for DB do that<br><br><br>Vegeta loves his family very much. He's just incredibly tsundere about it. That's what Vegeta is, a male tsundere and Bulma sees that. I think Trunks said something about it during the Cell saga that both he and his mom love him for being the kind of person he is.</br></br></br></br>  <br> This whole thing is just reinforcing the stereotype that women go after the assholes. <br><br>but that's true</br></br></br>  <br><br>TL note: tsundere means asshole</br></br>  <br>They didn't retcon shit. He says the same thing he was saying during the Kid Boo fight about how he thought Kakarot was #1. Except here he says that he knows he's #1 but he's not going to stay #2 forever.</br>  <br>To be perfectly honest, I was hoping for the same thing. I can barely stand Sumitomo's music, and I am wary of Toei's pacing and quality issues. So I'd much prefer if I could just read a manga instead. But so far, the show hasn't been as bad as I feared.</br>  <br>Vegeta gonna Vegeta guy. Don't know what I can say.<br><br>He's not acting like how he did during the Cell saga anymore when he didn't give a shit about his family so this is a much better improvement.</br></br></br>  <br>rewatch the scene when he blows himself up to kill Buu</br>  So is AnimeRG the best subs we can get at the moment? I'm not that well versed in the language but I've still noticed a few grammatical errors here and there.  <br>Its the only subs</br>  <br>Fucking Pui and Yakkon was Stronger than Freiza.<br>At this point I'm willing to believe that Freiza was basically shit in the actual scale of the Universe as a whole</br></br>  <br>Patience is a virtue. See </br>  <br>Show proof that they were stronger than frieza</br>  <br>They are for now but the best subs will be Dragon Team<br><br><br>I don't think you can really prove that</br></br></br></br>  <br>What about DeadFish edits?</br>  <br>Deadfish is just Dragon Team's subs but scaled down in size for phones and shit</br>  How are ElSpark's subs?  <br>watchable</br>  <br>Elspark's subs are done quickly and haphazardly. In the new episode, they mistranslate "Beerus has been asleep for 39 years" as "Beerus has been asleep for 30 million years."<br><br>I don't think that qualifies as watchable. Not with the amount of time I will now have to dedicate arguing with retards online who think Beerus was asleep for 30 million years now.</br></br></br>  <br>dragon team is the best Ive seen. The DBsuper subs I just saw are full of errors and even missing lines</br>  <br>Bulma wants the strongest. This is reinforced in the Namek saga where Bulma makes a comment to the tune of, "Maybe I went after the wrong man," when referring to Yamcha in comparison to Goku.<br><br>She couldn't get Goku, though, so she went after the second-strongest: Vegeta.</br></br></br>  <br>My bad. All this time I thought they did something other than convert to mp4.</br>  <br>maybe she just wanted a man as abrasive as she is. <br><br>its implied they conceived trunks in an act of passion anyway</br></br></br>  <br>Yea, literal whore. Disgusting.</br>  So we're getting BoG next week already?<br><br>Good stuff.</br></br>  <br>And to continue on this line: It also explains why Bulma is the antithesis to Chi-Chi when it comes to their wants for their husbands. Bulma is constantly shown assisting Vegeta with his training, trying constantly to make him stronger by building the gravity room, flying that jet in this Super episode haphazardly, and (in GT so not canon) blasting Vegeta to help him achieve SSJ4 status.</br>  <br> People bitched about Bingo Vegeta. <br>I'm pretty sure most people loved it.</br></br>  <br><br>Viz scans where?<br><br>I can only find LQ shit</br></br></br></br>  I stopped watching Kai after the Namek Saga but I just checked the wiki and realized that DBS aired like a week after the final episode of Kai. So it really is like a continuation for everyone who's been watching Kai.<br><br>I guess they were testing the waters with the two movies and Kai, decided the demand was there and fucking went for a new series.<br><br>Sort of off-topic but how long do you guys think DBS will run for? Are we looking at a whole new series of arcs, or just a 4 cour?</br></br></br></br>   <br>Bulma and Vegeta's personalities are actually compatible: they're both jerks, stubborn, vain, smart and deep down have a noble heart. <br>They don't need to be around each other all the time and they can support and care about each other in their own way. I think that's why it works.</br></br>  <br>They stopped Kai after the Cell saga and only did the Buu saga after BoG proved succesful as well. That movie really gave some life back to the series.</br>  <br> decide to say dead <br> hang around Goku <br><br> get revived by the DBs <br> still hang around Goku <br><br>I don't get it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can see it having legs. Seeing as how Toriyama came back to the series after 20 years away and has already written two movies and has plans for a new arc in the series, I don't think it'll be ending soon. We got<br><br> Battle of Gods arc <br> Resurrection F arc <br> Super Dragon Balls arc <br><br>The Super Dragon Balls takes this shit to a whole 'nother universe. Toriyama's got ideas, and I think that so long as the money keeps coming in, the show will keep going until Toriyama fucking dies.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Kakarots victory over Buu <br><br>but everyone knows Gohan's stronger right?</br></br>  <br><br>I have a feeling that he's going to try to tie the Super Dragon Balls Arc to BoG and RoF arc, considering that we've already seen a few animated scenes of fat Beerus.</br></br>  <br> and has already written two movies <br><br>*cough* supervised *cough*</br></br></br>  <br>Gohan WAS stronger but Goku caught up pretty fast, like he always does. Vegeta was stronger too.</br>  <br>Even Toriyama said, "Gohan was a mistake." Not his exact words, but near them:<br> Akira Toriyama: I intended to put Gohan into the leading role. It didn’t work out. I felt that compared to Goku, he was ultimately not suited for the part.  <br>http://www.kanzenshuu.com/intended-<wbr>end/majin-buu/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>He should still be stronger...<br><br>I mean gohan was kicking super buu's ass and Goku was getting his shit kicked in by the weaker kid buu<br><br>I mean I guess they could use the excuse Gohan slacked on his training...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I loved this guy the moment we saw him. I hoped he will be somebody important, too bad he's DEAD. <br><br>And what the fucks about the story? Is it BEFORE the movies? Or Beerus had amnesia or what <br><br>Literally what the fuck is this shows about?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only Battle of Gods. He is the screenplay writer for Resurrection F.</br>  Is there a decent quality Frieza's return anywhere? No shakey-cam crap. Have looked around a bit but after 2 DLs both were Russian.  <br>Here's how Dragon Ball Super will work:<br><br> First Arc: Battle of Gods <br> Second Arc: Resurrection F <br> Third Arc: Search for Super Dragon Balls </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice source. Mystic Gohan doesn't suffer from ki drain or anything that would lower his top level. Nigga's basically SSJ3 full power.</br>  <br>Toei really has crafted a sort of renaissance for Dragon Ball, although I don't believe it was their intention from the very start. <br><br>Nothing has been said at all about the show's episode count, so all we can really manage is baseless speculation. For one thing, they've said that the movies will be adapted into arcs, but there doesn't seem to be the slightest hinting at Freeza's return in the show. It almost looks as if we'll go straight from the Battle of Gods arc into the Universe 6 arc with Champa and Girl Whis. Maybe this new arc will be inserted between the events of the two films? <br><br>If they will finally do what I'm hoping they will do, to go beyond the end of Z post-Uub, I can't see this having any less than 4 cours.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Third Arc is going to be Universe 6 vs 7</br>  <br>I believe in a Xenoverse arc happening.<br><br>I want to believe.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you have a source for this?</br>  <br>I really hope you're wrong. Those fucking japs can't be this assholes. The really doing series about movies we already saw? what's the point</br>  <br><br>Oh, nvm, I'm dumb. <br><br>Here you are:<br><br> Dragon Ball Super” is a complete continuation of the Majin Buu story arc. It’s got a bit of post-battle aftermath, continues with the “Battle of Gods” arc where the God of Destruction Beerus appears and the “Revival of ‘F'” arc where Freeza comes back to life, and then, I’ve written a strange new story where they finally depart from this universe. They’re fighting against their neighbors, Universe 6! They’ll yell at me if I give away too many spoilers, so I’ll keep the rest a secret, but they’re chasing after giant Super Dragon Balls; I think things will unfold in a bright and simple way, that will be really fun and exciting! <br>http://www.kanzenshuu.com/2015/07/0<wbr>1/dragon-ball-super-complete-showca<wbr>se-event-reveals-series-plot/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Character development in DBZ is always being reset in every arc.<br><br>Look at Gohan now. He's a loser again when a couple of arcs ago he was hot shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Kid Buu is more or less on par with Super Buu.</br>  <br>Mystic Gohan is still weaker than Goku.</br>  <br><br>No, it's going to be more like<br><br> Battle of Gods <br> Universe 6 <br><br>we've already seen animations of Fat Beerus and Fem Whiz, which means they should be showing up soon.<br><br>Only Battle of Gods mentioned the other Universes, so we probably have some time before they redo Resurrection of F, if they ever do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Vegeta doesn't know shit about Gohan's powers as he was dead and even still he hasn't trained for six months probably</br>  <br>They weren't even close. Goku was scared shitless to fight Super Buu.</br>  <br><br>Toriyama is probably going to tie all those into one another somehow.<br><br>We should be seeing Universe 6's Beerus in just a few episodes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because a) it's safe as fuck, b) Even if everybody's seen BoG, RoF has not come out on home release yet and won't for a while and c) since they want to go past RoF eventually they have to lead into it. Also they will fill gaps that were left hanging</br>  <br>Upcoming episode spoilers:  Goku faces off against Beerus on Kai's planet in episode 5. </br>  <br> No, it's going to be more like <br><br> Battle of Gods <br> Universe 6 <br><br>Toriyama said in the showcase event that they are doing the Revival of F arc after the Battle of Gods arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking shameless fucks. <br> T-there will be something g-great I swear, but first here's 90 episodes of slice of life, and shit you already know the outcome of <br><br>Just, why.</br></br></br></br>  <br>For one thing, there have already been considerable differences between the way things happen in the movies and the way they are happening in the show. So it's not things we've already seen. It's retelling, reworking, and tying all these things together. Well, that's the optimistic way of looking at things. They might not give a fuck, and just end up cutting and editing the movie footage down into episodes. I can't see Toei spending money on more new animation for such a thing.</br>  <br> 90 episodes <br>I'm guessing ~20 at the most.</br></br>  <br>Again, nice source. But in a realistic fight Goku would fight just so he could stay SSJ3 while Gohan wouldn't have dropped a sweat.<br><br><br>Nah, he was just worried about the people down there.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 90 <br>I will say its at max something like 24-26</br></br>  <br> They might not give a fuck, and just end up cutting and editing the movie footage down into episodes. <br>Bulma's party is on a cruise ship and some of the cast is wearing different clothes so I don't think that's possible.</br></br>  <br> implying Mystic Gohan vs Goku is even mentioned somewhere in the manga or by Toriyama <br>There's no official statement on who's the strongest, but clearly Goku prevailed. And that's for a reason. Also, you could go back and read this: </br></br>  This new series is boring as hell.  <br>If they recap battle of gods, it better be fucking quick. I don't want a 90 minute movie to be spread over 10 episodes which would take 10 weeks just to watch something we already saw. <br>Same with frieza arc if they did that too</br></br>  <br><br>Lets say you're right, and it's 26 episodes at most. It's still a lot of time, waiting on shit, that already happened. <br><br><br>Dragon ball never bothered with plotholes. don't even get me started on them. <br><br><br>Guys, for fucks sake, I just want to see some crazy DB action against wacky enemies, doing crazy shit, like blowing up planets. <br><br>I don't care about Vegita still being an angry prick to his family, or Goku still being autistic, or how Beerus decides NOT to destroy earth, and Goku going SSJGSSJ agains Golden Frieza. <br><br>Actually I'm surprised you guys defending this</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, you're right. All the information we have is pointing towards us getting a fairly different version of events from the movies. I have to wonder how much they might change in RoF... I hope Freeza-kun survives this one....</br>  <br> but clearly Goku prevailed <br>I think we've read different mangos, because I remember Mr. Satan saving the world. Also:<br><br> leading role <br> having anything to do with power levels </br></br></br></br></br>  Why do people think the SoL will continue for so long?<br><br>Hell next week is already about Bulma's birthday</br></br>  <br>are you from 9gag? fuck off summerfag.</br>  <br> I don't care about the characters gib explosions </br>  <br>I wouldn't even care for the SoL if it was good, nicely paced SoL (today's was somewhat acceptable SoL). And it it had some remarkable music.<br><br> I miss Kikuchi. </br></br></br>  <br>If they want to go past the movies, there is an audience who may not have seen them. And its not like everything is the exact same, that's why its a reimagining<br><br> doing crazy shit, like blowing up planets. <br>Uh<br><br> Actually I'm surprised you guys defending this <br>Well it's not like it's done anything actually bad</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm nearing the end of the Freeza arc right now and I think it's kinda bullshit that Goku is so much stronger than Vegeta. Vegeta's getting his ass kicked non-stop in order to become stronger and all Goku did was train at ultra-high gravity. <br><br>Vegeta should be so much damn stronger than Goku right now.</br></br>    <br>Zenkais&lt;actual training<br><br>Goku got to actually train AND get beat half to death. Vegeta just kept on charging through everything and get his ass kicked</br></br></br>  <br>he also died, trained on king kai's planet and put himself through 100x gravity training throughout the whole time he was on his way to Namek. It was even explained that Goku is stronger than Vegeta because King Kai's training is faster than normal.</br>  The animation quality for this show while still being pretty bad it's still somewhat tolerable, why the fuck can't toei put at lesat this minimum amount of effort into One Piece.I mean it's still their most popular show and their main cash cow and with a bit more effort it could actually become a far bigger success.  <br> there is an audience who may not have seen them <br><br>Point taken<br><br> Uh  <br><br>I mean, while fighting against each other, should'we been more specific <br><br><br>I said I don't care about shit we already know. <br>We know for like 20 years that Vegita is an angry manlet, and Goku has brain problems <br>And we already wasted two weeks about these<br><br><br>thanks doc</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks doc</br>  <br>Who did he get beaten half to death by? That shit only happened when he wasn't in his own body -- it shouldn't count.<br><br>But, then again, I'm arguing DBZ power level bullshit, it doesn't have to make sense.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, it seems fairly believable to me. Definitely easier to accept than "We get a kajillion times stronger just from almost dying". Imagine being 100 times heavier and doing pushups and hitting yourself with energy beams, definitely seems like a way to get way stronger.</br>  <br>DELETE THIS</br>  Was King kai voice always like that in the jap ver?, it sounds like an 80 yo man, he can't scream or raise his voice anymore.  <br> I said I don't care about shit we already know. <br>Well you can also take it on that filling the gaps part. BoG starts with Goku on Kai's planet for reasons and Vegeta training for reasons. These episodes showed how they got there and what the other main characters have been doing since Boo. I'm looking at it from a narrative point of view, not from the fact that I've seen BoG already. And again, I don't think the episodes have even been bad or anything.</br></br>  Episode 3: Bulma's birthday, Beerus visits Goku, Beerus visits Earth<br>Episode 4: Beerus shenanigans, Goku tries to become SSG, Beerus threatens to destroy Earth<br>Episode 5: Vegeta fights Beerus, Goku saves the day, Goku becomes SSG<br>Episode 6: Goku vs Beerus, victory, we learn about the other universes<br>Episodes 7-8: SoL<br>Episodes 8-12: Resurrection of F<br><br>That would be the first cour</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>gohan is actually alright. He was never going to stay a badass because he didn't like fighting</br>  <br>Nope.<br><br> Beerus fights Goku for the first time in episode 5. Episode 4 involves Pilaf. </br></br></br>  <br> That shit only happened when he wasn't in his own body -- it shouldn't count. <br>Well it's still his body<br><br><br><br>Episode 3 is going to be before the beginning of the party and also about Beerus remembering his dream<br>Episode 4 is about Pilaf<br>Episode 5, from the title is going to be that part of the movie where Beerus slaps Goku's shit on Kai planet.<br><br>Considering that is about 30 minutes in the movie, it's looking like somewhere around 12 or so episodes for BoG arc</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that's too fast. this is dbz we're talking about. the pacing is going to be shit like always. it's going to be 1-12 First half of Battle of Gods. 12-24 Second half battle of Gods. Then preview of Resurrection of F, which of course if Dragon Ball Super is not to everyone's taste, will not happen.</br>  <br>we know episode 5 is about goku vs beerus in king kai's planet</br>  Why are they remaking the movies into this series ? That's fucking bullshit honestly.  <br> Then preview of Resurrection of F, which of course if Dragon Ball Super is not to everyone's taste, will not happen <br>But we already know it's happening. We know the first three arcs of this show already</br></br>  <br>Even if ginyu was in gokus body while getting beaten up, Gokus body still got the zenkai boost. It's genetics in the saiyan body not gokus soul</br>  <br>He is an 83 year old man, actually. Joji Yanami. He didn't sound so bad in Battle of Gods, but he has definitely been in poor health lately. It's really depressing, you can hear him trying, but he just doesn't have it in him anymore. I hope he doesn't end up an hero like Daisuke Gori.</br>  <br>You're absolutely right, my mistake. But I still believe the pacing is going to be shit.</br>  <br>Because they want to do a story past RoF but RoF hasn't come out on DVD yet in Japan so they have to lead into it properly</br>  <br>and I will calm down, and enjoy the fuck out of the show, if the other Anons are right, and shit will be done in 5-6 episodes. <br><br>But my whole point is, since my original post, that this shit will take fucking forever to get over with, calling it now. <br>I hope I'm wrong anyway Anon.</br></br></br></br>  jesus christ why is vegeta such a constant asshole?<br><br>can't he just relax for one fucking day?</br></br>  <br>Bulma is a selfish asshole, Vegita is a selfish asshole<br><br>they both get shit done when they are forced to.</br></br></br>  <br>How cute anon<br>It will take at least twice as much episodes</br></br>  <br>Shitty reason tbh. Why not wait until it's out on DVD then? That will be what? One month of wait?</br>  <br>he was the incumbent king of a planet of the universes strongest warriors<br><br>it got blown up by an effeminate lady-boy<br><br>i would be pissed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I can see the first 26 episodes being dedicated to BoG/RoF.<br><br>Now what I wonder is if there will be any breaks in the series or if we'll go right from RoF to new material the week afterwards. I'm guessing there won't be any breaks as there's no manga to wait on and they want to keep Dragon Ball's popularity going.</br></br></br>  The reason Dragon Ball and Z's anime pacing was so bad was because the manga was coming out at the same time. This is anime-original so that problem doesn't exist. Even GT had them already get their first Dragon Ball by like the 5th episode. <br><br>This won't have unbelievably long power up sequences and long moments of staring because they don't have that as an issue</br></br>  <br>Try to see it like this: <br>You know you're a manlet tsundere asshole, who's also stupid as fuck, maybe can't even read, let alone work at some normal place. <br><br>You're only good at one thing: blowing up things, and fighting Android-alien demons. <br><br>But you defeated the strongest of Android-alien demons, and now you're supposed to enjoy life, the thing that you're terrible at. <br><br>I would be agitated</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>RoF doesn't come out in Japan until October.<br><br>You think they're going to wait 4 whole months and lose the hype they have from RoF's film ticket sales and the ending of Kai? This isn't Sailor Moon Crystal</br></br></br>  <br> implying Dragon Ball is not the best when it's about SoL shinnenigans <br><br>I want newfags who only saw Z to leave</br></br></br>  <br>what's a DVD?</br>  I haven't watched the ssg movie. I feel like it's a good thing because now I'm experiencing new stories in the anime. Should I keep not watching the movie?  <br> love SoL shenanigans but hate the fact that it's shit we already saw/know for 30 episodes minimum  <br> mfw i have no face </br></br>  Fuck, that picture looks so much better than the current style. <br><br>Painful.</br></br>  <br>epic</br>  <br>...nigger you fucking serious?</br>  <br>The movie will most likely end up having way better fights.</br>  <br>Everyone look smaller and chubbier.</br>  <br>I miss the older animation style. My favourite shit is the animation during the namek saga. I miss how the ssj hair used to be a pale yellow rather than piss gold like they are now, and there weren't harsh black lines to make it look spikey. Also why do faces look so shiny now?</br>  <br>Battle of Gods might not be a part of the continuity they're building within Super, but I think it's still a very enjoyable film and definitely worth a watch. I think sometimes people get too hung up in canonicity and continuity to enjoy the narrative being presented right in front of them. If the fact that BoG may not mesh with the continuity of Super makes it impossible for you to care about the movie, then you might not enjoy it.<br><br>I personally couldn't give a fuck about a canon. I hope Paikuhan and Garlic jr fuse to hold off Fat Beerus, while Goku recovers from a near fatal wound dealt to him by Golden Cooler.</br></br></br>  <br>The movie and series will be different so you can look at both.<br><br><br>There are many shots in the old anime that are good, but that one isn't one of them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>True. Watching episode 2 of dbs Vageta looked really really short to me. And I like how in the OP picture his hair is just a block of black. The hair in general was cooler imo in back then</br>  Its funny, Beerus is supposed to be the least villainous of the villain and yet so far he's come off as the MOST evil of all of them.  <br>I'm not sure who Vageta is but yes.</br>  <br><br>You can have Beerus. I'll take Champa.</br></br>  <br> implying mr.satan isn't the champion </br>  <br> I miss how the ssj hair used to be a pale yellow rather than piss gold like they are now <br>Toriyama has it as gold though. Also the anime started making it golder by the Boo arc</br></br>  So currently there's 3 subs out for this. inert, DBSuper and SeNsUi subs.<br><br>Which one's the best?</br></br>  Is there any link for that orchestral version of "Cha-la" that plays during the recap at the beginning of each episode?  <br>None. Seriously, all of them are rips of the same subs and they are shit. <br><br>If you want to see subs that are complete shit but give you a basic idea of the episode, it doesn't matter but you really want to wait for Dragon Team for actually decent subs<br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=iAd<wbr>uwaFCk_c</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I still prefer the pale yellow</br>  anon's RF subs where?  <br>Ahh, only a minute long. Oh well, hopefully there'll be a longer version on the OST. Thanks.</br>   new dragon ball anime <br> two episodes out <br> both are filler episodes <br>I mean, I'm not really complaining. I'm happy to get anything that's both Dragon Ball and canon ever since Z ended, it's just kinda funny to see that even the new anime is going to have filler out the ass.<br><br>Dragon Ball anime will never be able to escape the filler.</br></br></br></br></br>  can someone please give a link for the stream of the 2nd episode ?<br><br>i only find jackshit sites selling magic donkeys that wanna steal my strawberrys</br></br>  <br><br>I do not think that word means what you think it does</br></br>  <br>That is not a flattering shot of Goku there.</br>  <br> filler <br>You don't know what filler is, do you?</br></br>  <br>Do you even know what "filler" means?</br>  <br> filler <br>Do you even know what that word means? Protip: it's not episodes you don't like</br></br>  <br> Anime original series <br> Filler <br><br>I bet you think anything that wasn't in the movies is going to be filler</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>I do know what filler means, memesters. The first two sagas are based on the last two movies, and we're getting episodes based on finding Videl a birthday present and a family vacation with Vegeta.<br><br>Meme all you want, those are filler episodes. The only thing that might not count as filler is the last minute of the 2nd episode.<br><br>If it doesn't advance the plot, it's filler.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i agree they should fight from 0:01 until the end without talking to each other.<br><br>same with people complaining about dialogue in walking dead OMG WHY DONT THEY SHOOT ZOMBIE ALL TIME MAN</br></br></br>  <br>Autism</br>  <br> If it doesn't advance the plot, it's filler. <br>I guess you don't know what filler is then.</br></br>  Everything that isn't punching bad guys in the face is filler apparently. It's a little depressing, the state of discussion in DBZ communities. You'd think the fans would be older, wiser... at the very least understand what storytelling is.  <br>That's a pretty elaborate way to say that you don't know what a filler episode is but okay.</br>  <br> meme <br><br>There's another word that you apparently don't know the meaning of</br></br></br>  <br> If it doesn't advance the plot, it's filler. <br><br>So you don't understand what filler means. Thank you for your interesting input.</br></br></br>  <br> If it doesn't advance the plot, it's filler. <br>Confirmed retard<br><br> If everybody disagrees with me, it's a MEME </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>How did I even miss that song being Head Cha-La is beyond me.<br><br>Still pales in comparison to this<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vr1<wbr>f0JjHIpg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Looks like you're the ones who doesn't know what filler means.<br><br>Either that or somehow all 20 of you turboautists are confusing filler and canon.<br><br><br>Ebin troll, newfag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You'd think the fans would be older <br>I guess<br> Wiser <br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</br></br></br></br>  <br> canon <br>Look, another word you don't understand.</br></br>  <br>it looks like no one has a stream for the episode</br>  <br>You think filler is anything that doesn't advance the plot which makes no sense. The turboautist here is you<br><br> canon <br>Nigga this isn't even the same as the movie</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this the part where even if I explain to you what a filler episode is you'll deny it because you've already dug yourself too deep?</br>  <br> storytelling <br>Looks like you don't know what the word filler means, little memester.</br></br>  <br><br> Turboautist <br> meme <br> Ebin troll <br><br>Feel free to go back to  at any time</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>tfw he probs thinks most of db and shit like pre-majin saga in the manga are fucking filler</br></br>  <br>No, it's the part where he claims he was just trolling</br>  <br> being this butthurt because you're wrong and think a dragon ball show should be about finding birthday presents and going on wacky family vacations <br><br>All of my keks.

I'd tell you about torrents, but you're probably too dumb to figure out what to to do with a torrent file, so streaming is about your speed.</br>  <br>This show sucks.</br>  <br>I admire your tenacity, if nothing else.</br>  <br>I HATE IT<br>RADITZ WAS IN THE FIRST EP OF Z<br>WHY WASN'T THERE ANY FIGHTING IN THE FIRST EP OF SUPER?!<br>BECAUSE TORIYAMA IS A FUCKING HACK, THAT'S WHY</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's enjoyable so far. I got quite a few laughs out of the last episode.<br><br>With that being said, I don't think we can really determine how the show is until we get to the Super Dragon Balls arc.</br></br></br>  <br>How ironic</br>  <br> implying i said it was bad in the first place <br>Autists confirmed for being unable to read and getting so buttmad about my post that they'll be whining about it until way after this thread ends.<br><br>It's filler.

I mean, they are in their early twenties when they have Pan.</br></br></br>  <br> Christian anime <br> every person in the world praising Satan </br></br>   Next episode is the party <br> No Pilaf episode <br>What the fuck, Toei?<br><br>Dumpster-tier animation aside I really enjoyed that episode, though. The Vegeta stuff was fun, and I like Beers and Whis going to planets.</br></br></br></br>  <br> i've never seen dragonball <br><br>Don't want to be that guy but tons of stuff happened just in the first two episodes of DB. I kinda liked the Vegeta fanservice but let's not kid ourselves now.</br></br></br>  <br>always forget Big Greesn age</br>  <br><br>It's called establishing a status quo. We are learning about what our characters have been up to since Z ended and we see how it's all leading into the series first big plot.<br><br>In Z, the first big plot was the arrival of Vegeta and Nappa coming for the Dragon Balls. So, what, were those first couple episodes with Raditz just filler? It helped lead into the plot, but since it didn't advance it, is it just filler?</br></br></br></br>  <br>If Pan is indeed four by the end of Z, then Gohan should be at least 24 by RoF.</br>  <br>Is this saying Piccolo is 4 years older than Gohan? Wasn't Piccolo jr. Born 3 years before Goku and Chi-Chi got married. And didn't they have Gohan 3 years after the marriage? Correct me if I'm wrong</br>  <br> Filler = non-canon fluff  <br>usually but not always<br> written by a separate person  <br>not always<br> to buy time until the actual author is done writing.  <br>no, but this is mostly why filler exists<br> May often clash with the canon of the narrative. <br>irrelevant.<br><br>The problem is that people confuse the word canon and filler. For instance, manga can have filler, but it's still canon since it's the original work. Anime filler is usually not canon, but since DBS is the original work and is just using parts from the movies, the filler is canon.<br><br>Filler is everywhere and is not exclusive to anime and manga. Comics have it, movies have it, TV shows have it, books have it and Dragon Ball Super is full of it.<br><br>And no, showing off what the characters have been doing with their lives since the end of Z is not filler, but going on a wacky family vacations and trying to find the right birthday present is. Doesn't make it bad, it just makes it filler. The Piccolo/Goku driving lesson episode was filler, and it was fucking fantastic. Same with the Tao Pai Pai episode.<br><br>Ready for the memes, autists.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How is the plot not advancing? How could you know it's meaningless? We're only 2 episodes in. The story is re-stablishing the characters at the very least. Filler is just to 'fill in' the periods between manga chapters that take too long to release. There's no original manga for Super so it's impossible for there to be filler.</br>  <br>Gohan was four when Raditz landed so they had him an year after 23rd Tenkaichi.</br>  Quit recommending Dragon Team. Their encoding is absolute shit.  <br>And their subtitles are retarded. The typesetting is pretty bad too. It's just one or two people shilling them like crazy on /a/.</br>  <br>Come on, dragonball has never been very subtle<br>If that water bottle was going to have any relevance later on in the show, we'd know already<br><br>I'm not saying I agree with the definition, just that I think that's what he meant by it</br></br></br></br>  uub and pan were at the end of z, right?<br><br>why aren't they in super and the movies?</br></br>  <br><br><br>Alright, I gave SeNsUi subs a go. They're the best so far. They're an edit of AnimeRG but the guy actually knows japanese so he fixed up the translation and added the missing lines. They're pretty good.</br></br></br>  ITT: The gang falls for bait  Why are you guys even downloading subs? Just watch the raw. The language isn't that complicated.  <br> There's no original manga for Super so it's impossible for there to be filler. <br><br>There is, and the anime already got past it.</br></br></br>  <br>ITT: Autist can't handle different opinions and thinks everyone's out to troll him.</br>  <br>It's set after Buu, before the Tournament.</br>  <br><br>The end of Z took place years after the defeat of Buu. It also seems that ending has been considered non canon, unless Bulma is going to be pregnant with Bra during the BoG arc instead of Videl with Pan like in the movie.</br></br>  <br>Pilaf gets an entire episode in episode 4.<br><br>And next episode is the beginning of the party</br></br></br>  <br>Because movies and Super happen before the end of Z.</br>  <br>I should have mentioned that I'm only talking about DB filler. It can become canon if the author likes it enough, see Gregory for example. <br><br>I think we have different definitions of filler, what you're describing is just side stories. Filler is tied to canonicity, I haven't confused the two.</br></br></br>  <br> So, what, were those first couple episodes with Raditz just filler? It helped lead into the plot, but since it didn't advance it, is it just filler? <br><br>Are you stupid? Of course the Radditz story advanced the overall plot.</br></br></br>  <br>No there isn't. The manga is based on the anime and only exists to promote the anime. It's the same sort of deal as NGE. That manga started before the anime, too.</br>  Noticed Deadfish uploaded episode 1. Are they a good group? They released several days afterwards though, so does that mean it'll be a while before episode 2?  <br>If you're talking about this, this is a promotional manga. It was already explained up here  so I'm not going to repeat it. Promtional manga for anime original series do not work the same as regular ones. An example would be like the promo manga that come with Pretty Cure</br>  <br>Deadfish just reencodes for easier file playback.</br>  <br>Deadfish have some of the best subs. Definitely recommend, broseph.</br>  <br> 5 years after Piccolo vs. Goku <br>OK thanks. For some reason I thought it was 7 years</br></br>  <br>The manga is adapted from the anime, not vice-versa like for DB and DBZ. DBS is the original source material this time.</br>  <br><br>See<br/></br></br>  <br> unless Bulma is going to be pregnant with Bra during the BoG arc <br><br>Dude we're totally on the BoG arc and it's still set 8 months after Buu. Original manga is out of the games.</br></br></br>  <br>He better. Pilaf and his gang are like the main reason I'm even watching this show.</br>  <br>Puipui thought that 10x Gravity was a big deal. He was Cui level at best.</br>  <br>I tried, and while I got the general gist, it wasn't because I understood the words</br>  Alright so I just want to watch the show with English subs. What is the best available out of all the shit that's been uploaded so far? <br><br>It doesn't have to be an absolute 10/10, just to where I can enjoy the show each week.<br><br>I'm not downloading Dragon Team because they are absolute shit, and they don't even have episode 2 out yet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So English dubs in 2018???</br>  <br>The water bottle gift established the connection between Goten, Trunks, and Videl, while also showing these kids are not too bright, but kind and good. It's just a plot device.</br>  <br>Then Supreme Kai is retarded.</br>  <br><br>Yes, and? Anon was concerned with the ending to Z and based on how things appear to be going, it looks like that ending is being rendered non-canon. Bra was older than Pan and since according to BoG Pan is actually coming first, well that's that for Z's ending.</br></br>  <br>Just download AnimeRG and don't bother with all the other shite.</br>  <br>Maybe they picked up the series now.</br>  <br>This is stuff we already knew from the last like 100 episodes or something of DBZ, though</br>  <br>I thought they were already working on the dub</br>  <br>From what I hear, Sensui seems decent.<br><br>Do not use AnimeRG. They are shit and there are entire lines unsubbed and wrong<br><br><br>They don't even have the license</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>AnimeRG itself pure shit, lots of missing lins, grammar mistakes, awful timing and general poor translation. GoGo picked up their subs and fixed up a bit, it has better timing and fixed grammer, but he doesn't know japanese. Like I said here  SeNsUi subs picked up from GoGo and cleaned the translation, fixing mistakes and adding in the missing lines. So they're the best so far.</br>  <br>Right, but this is a new series for a new audience. Some people may have never seen DB or DBZ. Super might interest them to go back and read/watch it though.</br>  Everyone's sucking this Gogo guy's cock, but he's honestly not that good.  <br><br>I'm confused as to what's wrong with Dragon Team? They had actual typesetting and no obvious mistakes I could think of. Only real issue being the honorifics but that doesn't bother me as even Funimation's subs for DB have those.</br></br>  <br>I understand the words and they really aren't anything you can't figure out just buy watching. Especially if you've already seen the movie.</br>  <br> Everyone's sucking this Gogo guy's cock <br>No we're not. He doesn't even know Japanese.</br></br>  <br>That's true, but to those who already saw DBZ, DBS has, so far, been kind of underwhelming and a little disappointing<br>Even though I get why it's done this way, I don't exactly like it</br></br>  God, why are anime private trackers such shit? <br><br> still no episodes of super in any anime private tracker i'm in <br> 6 gorillion of them are on every single public tracker </br></br></br>  <br> I'm confused as to what's wrong with Dragon Team? <br><br> both posts list issues <br>Are you fucking retarded? Fuck off, your little group is SHIT.</br></br></br></br>  <br>after dragon ball goku didnt kill anyone until Buu saga</br>  <br>He doesn't know japanese. He only fixes timing and grammar.<br><br>Honestly GoGo, the phrosty guy or whatever he's called who does AnimeRG and Sensui should team up. Their combined results are pretty decent.</br></br></br>  <br>Why dont he use the suer dragon balls to bring his people back, since he cant stop bitching about being a prince?</br>  <br>I don't think they even started with the majin buu saga: dragon ball z kai dubs yet.</br>  I remember when Kai started there were like a bunch of groups subbing it. By the end of Kai there were like...two maybe? Then by Boo, there was literally only one. Wonder how many will actually stick with the whole thing.  Sensui released confirmed best so far.<br><br>Just finished watching it. <br><br>Everyone download theirs. I'll be using them every week from now on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holding Raditz down for Piccolo to kill him is the same as killing him. Raditz wouldn't have died if not for Goku doing that.</br>  <br>This is an actual new series, Kai was a pure rehash.</br>  Uh, you guys said Sensui's subs were good<br><br>Why is this line still wrong?</br></br>  <br><br> the city of funimation </br></br>  <br>I've been a DB fan for a long time and I'm enjoying it. I am excited for the action too, but episodes like these build up the wait and make the fights more enjoyable since we are given context. Just my 2 cents.</br>  And why is the word accessory in English being translated as necklace when that is clearly not a necklace?  <br>They are the best out of the shit released so far. Not a single decent group has subbed this series yet.</br>  Can one watch this without having seen the Frieza movie?<br><br>Also, is there a non-shakey cam of the movie floating about somewhere?</br></br>  <br>What is this and where can I get it and why the fuck isn't this public knowledge? Is this a joke or is there really a search engine with every torrent site?</br>  <br><br>Extreme nitpicking. Still WAYYYYY better than anything else so far for DBS.</br></br>  <br>So, what are the implycations of being dead, except for the halo part?</br>  <br><br><br>Nobody's saying they're perfect, they're the best so far, which is not saying much.</br></br></br>  <br>Shut up, mighty Akira Toryama makes no mistakes.</br>  <br>I'm not nitpicking, these are just the AnimeRG subs with a few differences and actual sub timing<br><br> 30 million is the same as 39 <br> Clearly saying different words here <br><br>I mean, I don't mind using them but they are about the same as the other ones</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Getting fcked in the ass daily.</br>  <br>dumb baraposter</br>  <br>Those few differences make it stand miles above the rest.</br>  <br>if you die while you're dead, you cease to exist.</br>  <br>It's Buu with cat features.</br>  <br>I'm enjoying it because it's DB and because I like Vegeta, but episode 1 was a big let down<br>Such a weak start for such a highly anticipated show<br>It's like an EVA sequel without robots or Asuka\Rei for the first 2-3 episodes, yaknow?</br></br></br>  <br>Look if this guy who is ripping the AnimeRG shitsubs makes another mistake for something actually important at some point it'll be a pain in the ass. There's already people wondering why Elder Kai knows about Beerus from 30 million years ago despite him being in the sword for way longer because of those bad subs even though he actually says the timeframe we know of 39 years. <br><br>Who knows what the rest of the series will do?</br></br></br>  <br>Are you feeling it now vegeta?</br>  <br>You can think of Episodes 1 and 2 as prologue to the actual movie events we know and is just supposed to show what the cast was doing in between Boo arc and the BoG arc.</br>  <br>Do you speak English?</br>  <br>We need more pics like this.</br>  <br>I know what you mean. More Beerus action in the first episode would have been nice.</br>  <br>Bullshit.</br>  <br>Alright fine, we'll ignore the issue. I just hope nothing major gets stupidly translated.<br><br>On another note, this fucking scene</br></br></br>  Did anon ever finish subbing RoF?  <br>It was in the anime and they made a big deal about it when Kid Buu started killing people in the afterlife.<br><br>Not sure if it's in the manga.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No this is definitely canon. It's cause for concern when Vegeta is technically dead and fighting Buu towards the end.</br></br>  <br>It's brought up when Vegeta goes to fight Boo and Goku tells him not to or else he won't know where he'll end up if he dies again</br>  <br>Those Kid Buu scenes were not in the manga, however Goku clearly stressed it out to Vegeta when he was buying time.</br>  So I guess Episodes 3-10 will be Battle of Gods, amirite?<br><br>^_^</br></br>  Maybe Toriyama doesn't do animal people anymore because he figured out he can just make a bunch of wacky designs for aliens instead  <br>Would he just become one of those white soul cloud things and lose his body? Most dead people don't get to keep their bodies, can those souls be destroyed too? This was probably never adressed by Toriyama but I'd like to know.</br>  <br> I'm not downloading Dragon Team because they are absolute shit <br>the dragonteam subs are literally the only good subs</br></br>  <br> that <br> good <br>They might be slightly better than the rest but they are also days late. making them pretty much the worst.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Weren't the clouds for people that had already lost their body before they even got to be judged?</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the length of time=!the quality of subs as clearly seen by AnimeRG<br><br><br>The white soul things are before you get judged so probably not</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's strange, I remember scenes from DBZ, the afterlife tournament ark. They've been "killing" each other, and after few seconds "killed" guy would come back to life. Goku was amazed, others were joking about it.</br>  <br><br> The Filler Tournament Arc <br><br>there you go</br></br></br></br>  <br>Weren't that only exceptional people get to keep their bodies?</br>  <br>Dead killing dead is OK, living killing dead fucks dead.</br>  <br> Filler arc <br> mattering <br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't read manga. I thought Afterlife Tournament was canon.</br>  <br>Nothing wrong with AnimeRG. Yes they have a couple of mistakes and two or three missing lines, but everyone should be able to pick up what's being said. This is the simplest Japanese possible, targeted at children and whatnot. If you need a couple of days refining the script for a show of this level, then you clearly are doing something very wrong.</br>  <br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!EIgQUA5B!u0Ku<wbr>U6VXc76GKeb6eeGGYQ</wbr></br>  <br>Well it's not.<br><br>Neither is Garlic Jr. or that time Bulma became a frog in case you were wondering.</br></br></br>  <br>they take their time but deliver good subs<br>most fast subs are terrible (just look at those spanish subs that come out an hour after the episode)</br></br>  <br><br>No, it and the Garlic Jr. saga are both 100% anime only<br><br>it was shown in a "what happens next?" bit at the end of Kai's first run and Paikuhan and some of the other dudes weren't cut from their minor appearance in Buu Kai so I guess they could still show up in Super</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yes they have a couple of mistakes and two or three missing lines <br>They are literally making up sentences for what characters say at certain parts and I'm pretty sure if you have missing lines in your subtitles at all, it is not good subtitles.</br></br>  <br>It kinda is, at least Goku getting on Grand Kai's planet.</br>  <br> Garlic Jr <br> not canon <br>Wait what<br>Isn't Kai 100% canon<br><br>I'm not saying you're wrong, I just thought it was entirely canon<br>I thought that was the point of Kai</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Goku getting on Grand Kai's planet. <br>I don't think that was in the manga either. <br><br><br> Isn't Kai 100% canon <br>It started that way but then they started putting some in<br><br>Garlic Jr. was not in Kai though. They completely dropped those episodes</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No, there were a bunch of things that Kai didn't cut that didn't appear in the manga. Gregory is an anime-only character, but he's in Kai. So are Satan's disciples that fight Cell right before he does himself. These characters have all shown up in Super so far, though.<br><br>Garlic Jr. saga and the Afterlife Tournament being two of the most notable stretches of anime original material is pretty standard knowledge, though</br></br></br></br>  <br>What?<br>Wasn't Garlic Jr the one coming out of that portal, only to be promptly sent back by Popo?</br></br>    <br><br>I'm sorry but what lmao</br></br>  <br><br>Am I misremembering hardcore over here?<br>I could have sworn that shit happened while I watched Kai</br></br></br>  <br>Grand Kai isn't in the manga either. Well, he's mentioned but he's never seen and it's never implied Goku met him.</br>    <br>I don't know how to tell you this, but you're thinking of a scene from the Abridged Series. It appears that you're a huge faggot. I'm sorry you had to find out like this.</br>  <br>O-oh<br>Thanks, memory, you're awful</br></br>  <br>He likely did. Toriyama actually outlined that whole filler just like he's currently doing with Super. No need to be this picky.</br>  <br>Looks like you don't know what filler means.<br><br>Filler is when you stick your dick in an anime's vagina.</br></br></br>  Im so happy dragonball super is here.<br><br>Guys, get everybody you know hyped for this so they can all watch from the beginning. If you got grandchildren or little brothers/sister or even kids yourself, watch the show with them. This is amazing, we've been waiting for this for years and now it finally happens. New episode every sunday. hype!</br></br>  <br>Toriyama also wrote the whole Tuffle backstory for the Saiyans but that's clearly not canon since the technology they were created to explain was later explained to be from Frieza. <br><br>Anything that isn't a manga by Toriyama isn't fully canon.</br></br></br>  Link to Resurrection F?  <br>piratebay.se</br>  <br>He didn't outline that filler. He just said how the Kaios worked. Everything else is pure Toei. It doesn't even make sense with how the afterlife works</br>  <br>http://pastebin.com/tGPsm6nx<br><br>I think the sub file to the whole movie is down, but that's fine because the timing was shit on it anyways</br></br></br>  <br>Because they haven't being conceived/born yet.</br>  I must be super slowpoking here, but is this episode the result of Vegeta FINALLY making good on his promise to take Trunks to the amusement park way back during the start of the Buu Saga?  <br>Yeah</br>  Why the Kaioh World exist again?  <br>For the same reason why you're living under a roof right now, just god style.</br>  Is Pikon canon he was awesome  <br/>  A good laugh was had.  <br>All of his appearances were filler<br><br>He was kept in Kai, but only for a few seconds and never said anything, if I'm not mistaken</br></br></br>  <br>He's not canon but he was designed by Toriyama.</br>  Who okay'd King Kai's voice actor? Kai is yelling half the time yet the old man voicing him sounds bored out of his mind. Fucking Funi better get to work quickly on the dub.  <br>I wanna eat some tasty octopus.</br>    <br>he's dead</br>    <br>sucks that Gohan stopped training, I mean it's great he's got a family now and all but I wish he stuck with it, mystic gohan was the shit, but once Goku became a god, even if gohan had trained as hard as goku did over the months, super saiyan god goku would probably be miles stronger.</br>  <br> Gohan has a family <br> Stays with them and doesn't train <br>What a shitty Husband and father.</br></br></br>  <br>Mystic gohan was stronger than super saiyan 3 goku</br>  <br><br>Why Toriyama hate animal people so much?</br></br>   gregory is in king kai's car <br><br>super confirmed not canon</br></br>  <br>The entire Odin arc in saint seiya is filler, but it has more going on than some of the manga arcs.</br>  <br>well Gregory was just in super so theres a possibility, dont count on him ever being relevant though</br>  <br>Super confirmed canon to kai where he also appeared</br>  <br> Beerus comes to destroy the earth. <br> Instead of capsule corp he ends up in penguin village. <br> Earth is saved. </br></br></br>  <br>More like<br> The entire universe is destroyed </br></br>  <br>arale needed a karate chop to split the planet in half beerus only needed his finger</br>  Ok, so what IS considered filler? This thread confuses me.<br><br>in b4 lurkmoar</br></br>  <br>So it's Dragonball GT 2.0?</br>  <br>Bulma has always had a thing for bad boys. She also found herself attracted to Goku after he grew up. Vegeta just happens to be a perfect amalgam of what she liked about Yamcha and Goku. A hot blooded monkey man bad boy.</br>  <br>anything that's in the anime and isnt' in the manga.<br><br>besides the driving school episode, movie 9, 14 and 15</br></br></br>  <br>well it was the stuff that wasn't in the manga, but since the anime is probably going to be done before the manga, we don't know, but i'm talking out of my ass here so I don't know.</br>  <br> anything that's in the anime and isnt' in the manga. <br>so this</br></br>  <br>There's basically two ways to look at it<br>Either it's non-canon material<br>Or it's all non-essential material not furthering the story in some way</br></br></br>  <br>The manga won't even be covering a lot of this at all.</br>  <br>Nah, the whole idea of going to another world to search for "super" dragonballs seems like Freeza Saga mkII.</br>  <br>Why? I mean DBZ was basically an animated version of a manga we already read. I'm assuming Super will expand on it. As long as it doesn't drag on too long, I'm all for more stuff, especially if it doesn't involve Goku and Vegeta. Let's see what Krillin's up to.</br>  I hope with this trend of including anime-only stuff that they don't revert back to the Toei version of hell. That shit is stupid.  <br>Ew, why the Bojack movie? That was such shit inbetween two decent movies.</br>  <br>She was barely trying.</br>  <br>Toriyama's influence is apparently enough to retain Mystic Gohan, hopefully this means he'll keep the other stuff straight too.</br>  <br>I can't remember if this is ever said or not, but apparently that's just Arale playing around. Who knows what she's capable of if she actually gets serious.</br>  <br>Yeah, don't know why he's mentioning Bojack. As far as I know it has never been considered officially canon.<br><br>I liked the movie though, and it even fills in some of the plot threads that the manga never touched (like Trunks coming back after killing the Androids like he said he would and Vegeta's post Cell depression and return to battle, which is just completely ignored in the manga comes the Buu arc)<br><br><br> Toriyama's influence is apparently enough to retain Mystic Gohan, hopefully this means he'll keep the other stuff straight too. <br><br>I'm pretty sure that's not Toriyama, considering how he was the one designing SSJ Gohan for RoF.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, suppaman broke a few plates with a chop and Arale was "Oh I can do this too"</br>  <br>Vegeta is still stronger than Goku at that point at base level, he just doesn't have Kaio-ken. It isn't really until Cell that Goku actually surpasses Vegeta on an even field.</br>  <br>toryiama was actually involved in that movies production besides approving shit hence why you get actual original shit like trunks fighting tien</br>  <br>UNDERAGE B8</br>  <br>Goku kept training himself to near death then eating a senzu bean on his way to Namek. That's how he got so strong. Then his body got wrecked while Ginyu was in it and his power shot up even more.</br>  <br><br>Goku is stronger than Vegeta during Namek. The explanation is Goku gets Zenkai from Vegeta almost beating him to death in saiyan saga. Then, while on his way to namek, Goku trains in SUPER high gravity training himself to the point he almost kills himself, and then revives himself with senzu. He does this several times, not realizing he's exploiting the saiyan loophole. So by the time he gets to Namek he's out zenkai'd Vegeta by a bit.</br></br>  <br>You know you people keep saying Toryiama was involved with this, Toryiama was involved with that. quite frankly I think you're a lying sack of shit. Next you're gonna tell me Toryiama was the script supervisor for GT.</br>  <br>It's episodes made with the purpose of not letting the anime catch up with the manga</br>  <br>Isn't that what this is?<br>The manga needs to catch up right now, correct?</br></br>  <br>Nah, I don't see any extra credits for Toriyama there aside from the usual "original creator", which is used for anything DB related.</br>  <br> He does this several times, not realizing he's exploiting the saiyan loophole. <br>It's specifically said by Vegeta that hurting yourself doesn't count though, which is why he asks Kuririn to do it.</br></br>  <br>He could spend some of his free time training and still have plenty of time with his family, its not like he needs to train all day or go to another planet like Goku.</br>  <br>I think you mean Gregory confirmed canon.</br>  <br>He's stronger because of Kaio-ken, his base power level is weaker than Vegeta's almost the entirety of Namek.</br>  <br>There is no manga to let catch up. The Super manga is just promotional material, the anime is the main story.</br>  <br>Could've swore it meant asshole who after times becomes a little better.</br>  <br>Because being crushed under 100xs earth's gravity doesn't count as injuring oneself, anymore than being crushed by water pressure would be a self inflicted wound.</br>  <br>I don't remember that kayo ken when he bitch slapped Recoome to death.</br>  <br>Because it was a plot point not to show it, which is why when the dead crew is talking about goku still using weights and shit, and king kai tells them "no he has been fighting using kaioken all along."</br>  <br>Wasn't he using short bursts of Kaio-ken against the Ginyu force? I thought I remembered him doing it but they were too shitty to realize. Anyway, as soon as Goku gave him a senzu bean he shot up high enough to toy with Jeice so that was a short time period anyway.</br>  <br>If that's true then why did he have to announce he was using the Kaio ken against Freezer?<br><br><br>No, he was doing what everyone was doing, where he suppressed his power until the second he landed a hit and then suppressed it again.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Tori stated that he hated Vegeta popularity by the end of DZ however over the years he started likening the character more and more, to the point he feels he needs to be the hero of at least a small arc.<br><br>This is probably the reason for this episode.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, Tenshinhan says that Goku should be able to take Kaioken up to 10x, and Kaioh says that he's already using it.<br><br>In the manga though, there isn't any invisible Kaioken going on. Goku initially fights Freeza without any kind of aura, but after they agree to fight for "real" you can see Goku using burts of aura through the battle. It's just that in the manga it's easy to only notice that it's Kaioken in retrospect, while the same couldn't be done in the anime, which is why they had to do that whole "invisible Kaioken" bit to bring a similar surprise to anime viewers.</br></br></br>  <br> No, he was doing what everyone was doing, where he suppressed his power until the second he landed a hit and then suppressed it again. <br>Just reread the chapters where he beats them, its too ambiguous to say for sure. All they say is that hes boosting his power for a moment but thats essentially what Kaio-ken is anyway. At one point he definitely has an energy aura but I'm not sure if its just a regular aura.</br></br>  <br>I think what he said was that he wanted Vegeta to be the protagonist of his own movie.<br><br>The reason for this episode is to follow up on that promise to take Trunks to the park and foreshadow his eventual Bingo dance</br></br></br>  <br>Nah man, his actual power level floated around 60,000 (actual number stated by Ginyu, some sources say 90,000).<br><br>That's why he gets 180.000 after powering Kaioken, he either went 2x or 3x.</br></br></br>  <br>What were Recoome/Burter at? I thought they were close enough to 60k that it wouldn't be enough to dodge them like that.</br>  <br>Recoom I think was 40k, while Burter reached 44k, around that level.</br>  You know, he is commiting genocide.<br><br><br>We don't know any of their levels</br></br></br>  Alright someone help me out so far this is how I see it<br> DragonBall <br> Dragonball Z <br> BoG <br> Frieze movie <br>Then there is DB Super which I haven't watched yet but I heard it is about alternate dimensions(?) <br><br>So DB and DBZ with the last 2 movies are one dimension right? so Is Super a whole different universe?<br>Fuck speaking of, how many different timelines where there in the Cell Saga, there was 2 time machines and shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Super is a direct sequel to DB and Z. <br><br>The new movies are being retold in the series. The alternate dimensions thing is that they will go to one of the different universes after the RoF arc, specifically Universe 6. Super is not an alternate universe.<br><br>Don't bring up the Cell saga, that's some timey wimey bullshit that will confuse you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's<br><br> DB <br> DBZ starts <br> Super starts <br> BoG <br> RoF <br> Super ends <br> DBZ ends </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dragon Ball<br>Dragon Ball Z episode 1-288<br>Dragon Ball Super<br>Dragon Ball Z episode 289-291<br><br>The first episodes of Super will retell the events of BoG and RoF.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Also, was this entire episode a slideshow? Fucking hell Toei. <br><br>A slideshow? No! There is now way Toei would bring back a popular franchise only to give it a shit budget and piss on the original</br></br></br>  <br>The worst the episode had was some stills. It still looked way better and consistent than that hot mess.</br>  Dragon Team subs when?   [Doki] Joukamachi no Dandelion - 02 (1280x720 Hi10P AAC) [59CD22C8].mkv   Anyone know where to watch the second episode in good quality since kissanime doesn't have it  so the bro wants kanahana to get rid of the cameras so they can fuck, right?  Did Doki remove the torrent?<br>Can't seem to find it.</br>  <br>Read the thread and you'll find it in less than a second.</br>  <br>I bet you looked on nyaa, faget</br>  Does anyone wanna explain to me how the fuck Guts lifted the Dragonslayer with his teeth? <br><br>  also does anyone have a picture of that panel? </br></br>  <br>Gut's pure unadulterated badassness allowed that to happen.</br>  <br>Lots and lots of milk.<br><br>Strong bones and teeth will come with milk.</br></br></br>  <br> lots and lots of milk </br>  <br>He used his magnetized prosthetic hand to apply force to the blade while gripping the hilt with his teeth and springing with his whole body..</br>  <br>I thought only the palm of the hand was magnetic through</br>  <br>I kek'd</br>  I have that pic somewhere in my folder. Let me look for it.<br>Was it before this scene? It's between pic 1 and 900.</br>  <br>before<br>In the slug count fight I think</br></br>  <br>It was when guts was fighting the count's apostle form in the black swordsman arc</br>  <br>It is. Miura went 'fuck physics, this is too awesome for that'.</br>  <br>Who should be asking how is he swinging that sword in the first place</br>   morons who think they're funny and try to fit in still shitpost in a Berserk thread <br>What a surprise.</br>  <br>*You</br>  <br>I just left it as suspension of disbelief, but after he picked it up with his teeth i was officially bothered. Still the best fight in the series tho.</br>  I have something to admit, /a/...<br><br> I skipped a lot of the manga. I watched the golden age movies, and picked up the manga from there. I'm saving it for when we have to go another half year without new chapters. </br></br>  <br>Huh?</br>  Can't find it.  <br>don't you have anything better to do? have some sense man, I am actually starting to get sad for you</br>  <br>Shitposter-kun has always been present in Berserk threads.</br>  <br><br>yeah they should take a cue from Miura and go play Idolmaster instead</br></br>  <br> i did too. I read some of the Black Swordsman arc, read gutts' childhood, watched the movies and then skipped until it was current time. Forgive me based gatts </br>    <br>Get out.<br><br>Leave.</br></br></br>  <br>Chapter 6 i think</br>  <br> Magical negro blessing. <br>   He is half demon/monster </br></br>  <br><br>You guys know that the movies cover literally like 30% of the golden arc, right?<br>You skipped what's arguably the best arc in manga history. I don't have any comment to make.</br></br></br>  <br/>   morons got butthurt because I put them in their place <br> they can't even defend themselves <br> all they can do is shitpost because they're retarded and butturt <br>What a surprise.</br></br></br>  <br>Beautiful</br>  <br>What's this miura and idol master i see people saying all the time? I even saw a pic of guts holding copies of idol master.<br>What gives? COuld someone spoonfeed me.</br></br>  I started with the anime, switched to the manga on when Griffith has gone to the prison, and oh shit, the manga was so much better, but I don't regret anything, it was fun, better than the movies I think<br><br>[/spoiler] TELL ME WHAT, TELL ME WATCH, TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT </br></br>  <br>I read a lot of it.</br>  <br>Morons like to blame The Idolmaster for Kentaro Miura's lazyness to fit in.</br>  <br><br><br>I don't come to /a/ often, could someone explain this specific form of shitposting? Is he like pretending that someone is shitposting the thread so that he could post pics of generic girls? I don't get it.</br></br></br>  <br>He's trying to kill all berserk threads through advanced aspergers</br>   butthurt morons who talk about me are retarded <br> they just want to shitpost because they have nothing else to do <br>It's okay that you're all retarded butthurt objectively inferior subhman pieces of shit who are jealous because I'm an intelligent objectively superior human.</br></br>  <br>File it under "general autism".</br>  Guys, can we stop replying that applefag shitter? Seriously, you're just giving him more reasons to post.  I feel like a good berserk anime could never be made.  <br>Naw, it would just take a lot of effort to live up to the manga.</br>  <br>It could be done if it actually stuck to the manga, although I guess you could say that about any anime.</br>  <br> Gatts </br>  <br>Pic will explain it.</br>  Post smug Guts  <br>I wish they did it on multiple ovas, like Hellsing Ultimate, but after seeing the last three movies I am not sure about it, its probably better to accept that no good animation will ever come of it.</br>    <br>I still don't know why they used so many CGI and why no one told them it looked bad</br>  <br>Holy shit that is the funniest shit I've seen all week</br>  <br>Was this in the beginning of the manga I don't even clearly remember this shit happening fuck that was awhile ago.</br>   [FFF] DATE A LIVE II - Vol.01 [BD][1080p-FLAC] <br><br>Where were you when Hell froze up?<br><br>Also  http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/20<wbr>15/150713e.pdf</wbr> </br></br></br></br>  <br>   http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/20<wbr>15/150713e.pdf</wbr> <br>Stop spamming this shit everywhere and fuck off back to .</br></br>  <br>I haven't seen it anywhere though</br>  There was a second season of DaL?  <br>Yes.

She did it in S1, in G, and now she is doing it again.</br>  <br>huh? can you refresh my memory?<br><br>you mean keeping the symphogear a secret from Miku in S1?</br></br></br>  <br>In S1 and G her expectations were so ridiculous that they were even more dangerous than Hibiki's very own martyr complex, to the point where even Miku herself understood that after a while.<br><br>There's a much better argument to be made for GX, but Hibiki dodged a massive bullet by not transforming anyway given what we've seen happen so far and we don't even know if Miku herself is going to be jumped in ep3 yet.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Didn't she get her arm bitten off and eaten or am I remembering that wrong?</br></br>  <br>I'm really really digging maria's gear design in GX, at least what little we've seen of it in the op so far.<br><br>As a diehard chrisfag, I'm honourbound to stick with her as bestgirl, but maria is edging closer to 2nd place</br></br></br>  <br>Hibiki=Chris&gt;Tsubasa=Maria=Kanade&gt;&gt;<wbr>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;DMJii</wbr></br>  <br>It got better in the first five minutes of the next episode.</br>  <br>I want more messy eating and more moe from Chris this season.</br>  <br>If Miku would be honest with her feelings for once Hibiki would instantly stop all the dangerous shit. But since she just acts Dere around her all the time you got to cut her some slack.</br>  Can we agree that the whistling in the full version of G-Beat is fucking incredible?  <br>Sakuya</br>  <br>There can only be one.</br>  Would you?  <br>Wrong show for this buddy</br>  Chris is best girl and best gear hands down, but she's perfection so being one step away from perfection is pretty good.<br><br>That said, these trips are right<br><br>Motherfucking Wild ARMS whistling was the greatest thing I've ever heard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>「ＯＲＢＩＴＡＬ　ＢＡＩＴ」</br>  <br>Yes I would give her a blanket and pat her head.</br>    <br>No. I don't want to make her remember bad things.</br>    <br> [Listen to my Baaaait] </br>  <br>which flac torrent is the better one for this?<br><br><br>I'd  feed her a nice big homemade meal, watch scary movies on a giant beanbag chair and then fall asleep under a nice wool blanket with a fire crackling and a cracked window in the winter to promote lung health <br><br>..yeah<br><br><br>the best</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My heart and my dick are for Hibiki only.</br>  Do we ever get to see more of her butt?

Chris's symphogear headpiece reminds me of that one Kancolle enemy. Does it look like that to anyone else?  <br>Nah, that would just make Hibiki fight even harder so that she could protect her wife. Miku is already a huge motivation for Hibiki to fight as it is, half of her songs reference "the future" which can also be read as "Miku." <br><br>Also I think that given what happened to Chris and Tsubasa, Hibiki not transforming was actually the right choice. She probably would've taken a lot more of a beating.</br></br></br>  did nana sing enka in this season yet?  <br>They're all shit</br>  <br>I wanna stick it in.</br>  Hibiki needs to get some common sense. Her strategy of talking things out rather than fighting is okay and all if they were already well acquainted, but nobody is going to spill their guts to a complete stranger.<br><br>She needs to earn the 2hus respect before that.</br></br>  Reminder Hibiki is the ugliest symphogear.    <br>The very best.</br>  <br><br>Then put a bag over it<br><br>That ass was made for riding</br></br></br></br>  <br>Say that to my face fucker.</br>  <br><br>I like Hibiki's body when she's kicking ass<br><br>For some reason she always looks sickly thin when she's in uniform</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not her fault. The others are just cuter by miles. It's the reverse of the one eye'd man being the king of the blind. In this case, she's the blind man in the land of the one eye'd men.</br>  <br>Why bother with trying to look good when you can just punch shit all day? Besides, she has a wife already anyway.</br>  <br>fine wearing nehushtan disagrees<br><br>now that was a wasted design opportunity<br><br><br>poor genjuro, he just wanted to love ryoko<br><br><br>phonic gain</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why have one wife when you can have multiple?

This has the potential to be the best season yet if they don't fuck up the pacing like they did in GX or get too heavy-handed in the suffering.</br>  <br>S1 Chris was da best <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=cuo<wbr>SFsIrdIA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>    <br><br>Uh, no<br><br>Unlike children. if you croak your ward doesn't get shit unless you have a certified will stating that your possessions go to them.Same goes for any number of legal issues that can affect marriage, credit, travel and citizenship.<br><br>So yeah.

Her conversation with Carol was hilarious. Carol shut her down so hard and fast with a few words and Hibs looked like she was gonna cry.  <br>I don't know what you thought I was replying to, but I agree with you.

I hope it doesn't get too depressing.</br>  <br> At least Carol's dad loved her. </br>  <br>Hibiki's dad was probably fairly pleasant before he hit the bottle and bitched out</br>  So which one will be the first to get a boyfriend?   Hibiki will never become an aggressive girlfriend with alcohol issues for Miku   <br>Chris, but only because I'm going to marry her and before that I have to date her.</br>  <br>What are you gonna do when Genjuro breaks both your legs tough guy?</br>  Do you think Hibiki's grandma is a total bro and the source of her positive outlook, or a strict cunt?  <br><br>Yes</br></br>  <br><br>Fucking sick</br></br>  <br>OVER THE LINE.</br>  <br>I hope she dumps you on the first date. Only to go lesbian, then thanks you for letting her realize it. Leaving you with relationship issues for the rest of your life. Then when you die an early death, I will stand above your grave and piss in it.

This is some of the creepiest shit I've seen.

None of the gears are scumbags like you, and they wouldn't sleep around and act depraved.<br><br>Bet let's be real, it's obvious you're just shitposting and baiting like you always do.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder how she reacted  as she was raped when she was a kid </br>  <br>You must be new. <br><br>Lurk more.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I remember that reference and offer you a steak in appreciation</br></br>  <br>Miku pls</br>  <br>Don't be upset</br>  <br>Go away Miku.</br>  <br>While you are here, how do you feel about TsubasaxMaria now?

This of course manifested itself as a massive inner rage which is why she's so angry in S1.</br>  <br> Waifufagging triggers me <br> I've been here since 2007 <br>Ok kid.</br></br></br>  <br>None of us want to deal with Miku but I'll send your family some flowers.</br>  <br><br>Too dark<br><br>Send it back<br><br>Waste of good meat</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Samefag some more would you? Getting some realy good laughs over here.</br></br></br>  <br> Hibiki and Miku will never be in a broken, alcoholic relationship <br>Why does the show even ship them together if they aren't going to go all the way?</br></br>  <br>Denied</br>  <br>No, at most he probably just lazed around and yelled at her.</br>  <br> 21:02:20  <br> 21:03:05 <br>Time to stop posting.</br></br></br>  <br>Where did all these Chris-YrYr pics come from? I need more.</br>  <br><br>How do you live with yourself being as pathetic as you are?<br>The sad part is that you really are so pathetic you think it's one person and you honestly think you're smart enough to spot type styles. The only thing you do is accuse people of being against your shitposting and crack spamming as being one person. And unlike "me" you do have an obvious tell. And that's how you always reply with meta shitposting rather than actually addressing what's said in the post.<br><br><br> the characters have two lines together <br> OTP OTP OTP <br>You're retarded, that's what.<br> OMGEEE she blushed <br>Tusbasa blushed at the producer as well. Guess they're fucking.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That would have required him to care about her in some way</br></br>  <br>How you're gonna stop me from hugging your waifu?</br>  <br>El Buen Asado Argentino</br>  <br>You're obviously new if you're getting annoyed by standard waifufagging.<br><br>Only the second one was me by the way, and the first two posts were less than 60 seconds apart.</br></br></br>  <br>You don't exist.</br>  <br>They said if they knew Chris was going to be so popular they wouldn't have given her the tragic rapeslave backstory, so Hibiki is probably okay in that regard.</br>  <br> gets triggers by waifufags of all things  <br> says he's not new  <br> throws out samefag damage control  <br><br>It's time you left already.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Da fuck with that gif</br>  <br> Neither do you </br>  <br> Ogawa and Tsubasa fucking <br><br>Well, it would put some heterosexuality in this gayfest at least.</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking tertiaries.</br>  <br>---------DAILY REMINDER---------<br><br>Hibiki never loved Miku<br>Madoka never loved Homura<br>Yuuna never loved Tougou<br>Nanoha never loved Fate<br>Minato never loved Subaru<br>Sakura never loved Tomoyo<br><br>---------DAILY REMINDER---------</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well it can't be much darker than that right?</br></br>  <br> It's time you left already <br><br>Thanks but I like it here.</br></br></br>  <br>You are mixing shitposters.</br>  <br>To be fair, there is rabid crack shit poster in these threads who samefags like there is no tomorrow.<br><br>One time he was shitposting in an "your favorite anime couple" thread. And he was having an argument against someone who's against crack. And what he would do is every time he would reply he would post from a second device to post a crack picture with in one minute of his reply to the actual argument. So it would end up being like 20 minutes, then suddenly two posts in under 30 second. And he honestly thought no one would see how he was samefagging.</br></br></br>  <br>Did you actually read that somewhere or was that just posted in one of these threads and you believed it?<br><br>Because I've heard people claim all kinds of shit about Chris' past and the writers and interviews and whatnot over the years, but I've never actually seen anything concrete.</br></br></br>  <br>OVER THE LINE</br>  <br>All that exposed Sword skin. Please tell me she is going to stay in this all next episode.<br><br> Maria is so lucky </br></br></br>  <br>No he's right. You need to fuck off.</br>  <br>!Akemi, I still want to know how much you laugh whenever you see someone who posts against crack get banned while you are shitposting and ban evading right in the same thread.</br>  <br>It's either that or go naked I guess</br>  <br>Nah I'm good.</br>   Bikki getting her shit rekt even when Miku warned her to stay safe <br><br>Who wants to bet Miku is getting that Dainsleif Relic and kicking ass?</br></br>  <br><br>Five seconds on one side<br><br>Five seconds on the other<br><br>Any more and you might as well be eating these</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Minato never loved Subaru <br>The fuck are you on about? I think you mean Aoi. Minato  doesn't exist. </br></br>  <br> Please tell me she is going to stay in this all next episode. <br>I hope she doesn't and her outfit disintegrated along with the geah. Something like those Jackie Chan scenes where he has to survive being naked.</br></br>    <br>It's confirmed that he was a decent fellow before he was fired from his job.</br>  <br><br> eating almost-raw meat </br></br>  <br>Nah, Minato's just a coma patient in Subaru's universe, and she had tears in her eyes at the end because of her traumatic memories of Subaru mouth-raping her.</br>  <br> Maria running around the streets of London carrying a naked Tsubasa <br>I have faith in them.</br></br>  <br>How red can Maria possibly get</br>  <br>Alright, that's all I wanted to know.</br>  Tsubasa x Chris?<br>or<br>Tsubasa x Maria?</br></br>   People insulting Chris <br> Symphobros insulting Symphobros <br> Hibiki has an abusive dad <br> The /u/ in this show is cancerous <br><br>Why the fuck are these threads so terrible outside of Airdates? Even the "pre hype threads" where better than this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Both.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure once the gear is disabled you go back to wearing your old clothes unless you use something like AHMAH PAHGAH<br><br>Then again you never know with this fucking show.</br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br> implying Ogawa doesn't just magically ninja into the scene with a set of clothes </br>  <br> Hibiki has an abusive dad <br><br>But that's true. He hit the bottle and started getting abusive before fucking off all because of the concert incident. Read the keywords nigga.</br></br></br>  <br>Tsubasa x me<br>Maria x me<br>Chris x me</br></br></br>  <br>Hibiki actually did have an abusive dad, though.  Before he bailed, that is.

Questions over Questions.</br>  <br>Kanade pls</br>  <br>Noise please.</br>  <br><br>Oh ok I didn't knew that. Well they did say they wanted to go darker this season.</br></br>  <br>Because acting contradictory and obnoxious sure shows you're a quality person.<br><br><br>How is it not obvious?

You clearly don't even like the characters.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you implying that:<br>1. Ogawa would be able to deduce Tsubasa needed a new set of clothes<br>2. Find a properly fitting outfit<br>3. Find where they went<br>4.

He'll get back into the fray  right before Zerbikki murders him in episode 7. </br>  <br>I think you mean:<br> Genjuro is literally going to job for plot reasons and might even die <br>Why is this allowed?</br></br></br>  <br>He is a ninja you know</br>  <br>Nana apparently commented at her live today that Tsubasa and Maria are going to be getting even more intimate this season. So we're either going to be getting massive amounts of dere Tsubasa or alpha Tsubasa this season depending on their relationship.  I want more dere Tsubasa so badly </br>  <br>He's a ninja. Ain't gotta explain shit.</br>  <br>If you care about his wellbeing you should hope it stays that way. No reason for him to fight aside from showing how strong the enemies are, which would result in him losing and possibly dying.</br>  <br><br> ruining a choice cut of juicy meat by turning it into a shrunken, dry, wrinkled thing that looks like Maria's ass after she fell asleep in a tanning booth <br><br>Seriously I bet you're one of those pussies who can't even stand to see blood on the plate</br></br></br></br>  <br>You do realize that when you don't cook your steak thoroughly, you body can't disgest and absorb all the proteins and nutrients from it, therefore making it the actual waste.</br>  <br> doubting Ninja Jesus <br>Shit, he probably already has a more suitable outfit + footwear for Maria so she can run better too.</br></br>  <br>It kinda is though.

Heating proteins can denature them completely while the enzymes in your stomach (the ones that got there from millions of year of evolution) can break them down just fine to appropriate levels.<br><br><br> Even Hibiki wouldn't eat that <br>You're a faggot.

It's a caveman thing.</br>   all this steak talk <br>At least talk about who would cook the best steak.<br><br> It's not Tsubasa. <br> The best steak is Medium Well; this is literally fact. </br></br></br></br>  <br> watching the fucking grisaia anime </br>   implying any meat other than medium rare is acceptable <br><br>I have no interest in eating my meat raw or having it taste like a fucking rubber. My taste is objectively right and if you disagree you have no idea what you are talking about.</br></br>  <br> Serving your friends drymeat <br>You're a monster. I just cooked for 20 people at a cookout and cooked medium rare steaks for everyone. As a courtesy I asked if anyone wanted a well done steak and they all responded with an emphatic "fuck no."</br></br>  Chris is a miracle.  ITT: how would the symphogears eat their steak?  <br>There's nothing wrong with that.<br>The anime is good.</br></br>  <br>Japs aren't amerifats so they probably don't even know well done is a thing</br>   liking steak at all <br>I bet you fags like cowtits as well.</br>  <br> My taste is objectively right and if you disagree you have no idea what you are talking about. <br><br>4chan</br></br></br>  <br>Hibiki would love a big, meaty. juicy steak. Gotta get dem gains.</br>  <br>Hibiki would eat medium rare, Chris would eat rare. Tsubasa wouldn't care as long as she got to cut it with her sword. Maria would eat it well done because she's useless, and the lolis would complain and ask for chicken fingers.<br><br>Genjuro and Oogawa would raise a cow themsevles, feed it grass, massage it and then punch it into a pile of steaks while singing to it. They would proceed to eat the steaks raw.</br></br></br>  <br>This isn't subjective retard, though your degenerated tastebuds might lead you to believe otherwise. Like that myth you tell yourself to avoid facing the fact that you're a subhuman without taste.<br><br> us rubber tire eaters are human too! <br><br>There's a reason restaurant chefs give you shiteaters the oldest and lowest quality pieces of meat.

I think they just wanted to put a feminist angle in there.<br><br>But the review specifically called the girls 'hams', because they're like pieces of meat or something.

At the very least, what shows are going to get the three episode rule?<br><br>New shows: http://beta.strawpoll.me/4832999<br><br>Sequels: http://beta.strawpoll.me/4833001</br></br></br></br>   Wait for BD <br>TLR<br>Prison School<br><br> 3 Ep rule <br>Everything else</br></br></br></br></br>  Does the new beta strawpoll better than the auto spam proxy old one ?  <br><br>Looks like it. It comes with captcha.</br></br>  <br> It comes with captcha <br>Fuck this garbage.</br></br>  <br>Honestly absolutely none of the new shows has me impressed, interested or excited. I will watch NNB and Gatchaman second series though. I didn't watch that bones shoujo yet.</br>  <br><br>Finally, strawpolls will be useful again.</br></br>  Is it me, or are you forgetting NNB in your poll?<br>Anyway, I picked up more shows than I thought I did. I dropped Gate (read the manga), Gangsta, and Rokka no Yuusha.</br>  <br> Wanting to gauge shitty opinions </br>  <br>Oh wow I fucking did. God damn it. Which is all the more ironic because it's one of my favourite shows this season.</br>  http://beta.strawpoll.me/4833010  Surprised there a decent amount of people watch and like Rokka  <br>It's bretty gud.</br>  <br>Its okay. I dropped it myself since it seems like it will have a large cast, which I generally don't like but usually can handle but then I was spoiled and didn't like what I see.</br>  Wait, is Rokka no Yuusha actually good?  How does it feel knowing the end of the hiatus is coming soon?  <br>Why was 2011 so mediocre?</br>   implying the hiatus is ever going to end    2016 <br> WSJ announces that HxH will resume with a brand new chapter <br> Japan goes batshit, the Prime Minister declares a National holiday so people can go buy their WSJ fix <br> The fate day finally comes <br> People flock over stores for a copy, endless lines of faithful fans <br> They get to read it <br> The ''chapter'' is a 5 page epilogue saying that Gon and Killua had much more adventures and even married different women in the future, then it ends with a big ''THANK YOU!'' while Gon and Killua are walking towards the sunset. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that there was nothing wrong with Pouf's motivations and no one was truly in the wrong, therefore supporting either side is retarded.  WHENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN<br><br>TOGASHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII<wbr>III</wbr></br></br>  <br>He was a much better character than Meruem and his brothers.</br>  <br>Because of what its based on.</br>  <br>the best anime since FMA brotherhood is mediocre?</br>  <br>Togashi wouldn't do this, right?<br>Togashi is on the shotacons' side, right?<br>Right?</br></br></br>  <br>honestly if he had just ended the phantom troupe arc with Kurapika getting his revenge, then the manga stopping at Gon meeting Ging would have been perfect. I don't even feel the need to have the dark world exploration arc.</br>  Togashi is busy with Tokyo Ghoul Re right now so I don't see him having time to start up HxH right nowm  <br>How come? I thought they were all great.<br>Almost everything about Meruem was empirical, except for his innate instinct to subjugate other species. It made him interesting to me because instead of having a pre-determined set of morals and values, he explored every new emotion he was feeling. He also was a genuinely kind person, which makes him very likeable. <br><br>I agree there wasn't much to Pitou, but the way she was loyal to the King while also caring deeply for his growing empathy was something really unexpected, i believe it's part of why Gon lost his shit so much. In the end it was a shame Pitou had to go, because all that situation was based on misunderstandings and past actions. It really was an unfinished character.<br><br>Yupi was also really interesting, because before the invasion we didn't know anything about him except that he perfectly fit the enhancer archetype. Even against Shoot, he didn't rely on any sort of strategy. But like Meruem, he started exploring all the new emotions he felt during the course of his sparring with Knuckle/Morel or Killua. I think he was a good person too, after seeing what happened to Meruem i believe even Pitou would have been on Pouf's side.<br><br>They weren't bad characters at all, they just had so much more potential for change, and that's a bit sad considering they all died prematurely.<br> Sorry if anything of the above doesn't make sense, i'm pretty drunk. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>shit director who didnt understand the material</br>  <br> I don't even feel the need to have the dark world exploration arc. <br><br>Of course it's necessary. Togashi's end game is to kill Jump. He's obviously going to continue siphoning money out of them for doing nothing as long as he possibly can.</br></br></br>    <br>Nah he understood it alright, it was a very faithful adaptation. That being said I prefer 99 because of its atmosphere and cel shaded animation. Really gives an old classic adventure kind of feel, but there's also a lingering darkness in the back that you just can't shake off and it grows and grows until you reach the Yorknew City arc where you realize you're not really watching the same anime anymore. 99 impacted me in so many ways.</br>  <br> there's nothing wrong with manipulating your loved one's life if they aren't the kind of person you'd prefer them to be <br><br>Okay anon</br></br></br>  <br>killua is such a qt, id go gay for him any day of the week</br>  At least we have Black Clover, right guys?  <br> projecting human values onto literal bugs <br>Okay anon<br><br>In a way it was great, because it really blurred the line between human and ant nature. He wanted what would be best for the king of the ants, but jealousy and selfishness also are very human emotions.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This.<br>I think the Hanzo "fight" scene really marked me as a kid, because i remembered it perfectly even before rewatching it.<br> I also thought the battleship filler episode was canon for the longest time. </br></br></br>  <br> Nah he understood it alright, it was a very faithful adaptation </br>  <br>2011 had terrible directing, what made it so good was the story aka the source material. Brotherhood was a similar situation.</br>  <br>He understood it so well that he failed to properly depict the MC's personality. Honestly it seemed more like the director believed that he was adapting a straight-forward shounen series. <br><br>2011 also isn't as faithful as people like to believe, it adds in things in weird places, removes things, as well as interprets others in it's own way.</br></br></br>  ITT: Citations needed  <br>I don't know, it had a few scenes with pretty decent directing, like Gon's flashback about the Pitou/Kite events, fading into a vision of Kite's mutilated corpse into his eye. It made it perfectly clear that it was a traumatic experience for him.<br>There was also episode 134. I think they had one good set of directors, which is a shame because it could have been a fucking excellent adaptation if they were in charge of everything.</br></br>  <br>Why would citations be needed for an observation?</br>  <br>A few scenes that have decent directing out of over 100 episodes doesn't change the fact that the series has shit directing overall.</br>  <br>Very few. So few it's pathetic.<br><br>Episode 134 was definitely the stand-out episode though, good taste there anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Name a show that's over 100 episodes long with god tier directing all throughout then. <br><br>Protip: no such show exists.</br></br></br>  <br>Urusei Yatsura</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Fuck you I almost cried during this scene when I realized I have been with my little sister for 22 years and I hated her guts ever since she was born but alluka and killua were together for like what 3-4 years and they could tell each other they love them like wtf this shit isn't real but why does it make me realize I'm such a trash of a person and I should kill myself<br><br> thanks for reading my blog </br></br></br>  <br>Feel free to try again.</br>  <br>How is that changing the fact that 2011 has shit directing?</br>  <br>Feel free to stay wrong.</br>  <br>Chimera Ant arc adaptation was very good. <br><br>Maybe it was because I read skimmed the manga because the art back then was so bad, but I didn't truly understand the rift between Killua and Gon until I saw the adaptation.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh yeah, i agree, that's not the point i was trying to make at all. I just wanted to point out that that it had much more potential.</br></br>  <br>The CA arc had terrible pacing.<br><br>Out of curiosity what do you believe caused that rift?</br></br></br>  <br> shit director who didnt understand the material <br>Nether did Togashi.</br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but did it? I don't really remember because it's been a while since i watched it, but the only parts i remember having shit pacing are episodes 115, 130 and the first half of 125.<br><br>What</br></br></br>  <br>Togashi is the one who wrote the series dipshit.</br>  <br>I remember looking for these scenes in the manga and I was surprised to find out they were anime original, it really was much needed creativity.</br>  <br> I think that's the joke. </br>  <br>Im not disagreeing with you but i think most sports anime i've seen do a good job, Diamond no ace, hajime no ippo</br>  <br>It's not hard to get a sports anime wrong.</br>  <br>Believe it or not I've actually come across people who genuinely believe it.</br>  <br>beacause never had a father figure in his life so he was a selfish brat from the start. Mito can't even handle gon as it's mentioned that she puts up with gon's faults.<br><br>During CA arc though gon meets Kite who he sees for the first time as a father figure even related to his real father so when pitou fucked up kite gon as the selfish brat he is puts kite as his priority and everyone know that when gon makes up his mind no one else can change it. Now when Killua picks up something is unusual about pitou he wanted to stop gon and confirm but gon is focused only on kite and killua realizes that gon will disregard everything and everyone else if he had set his mind on something<br><br>every arc before AC proves this</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah hate to break it to you but that's wrong, you should probably go read the manga. Starting from chapter 1.</br>  <br> what do you believe caused that rift? <br><br>I think even after Killua removed the needle he was insecure about himself. His assassin upbringing did some permanent damage, making him more apathetic. He can still make friends but I don't think he'll ever connect with someone as deeply as with Gon. <br><br><br>On the other hand Gon is completely on the opposite spectrum. He can feel strong emotions for anyone, not just Killua. Which is why he went through all that for Kite, who he met just once before. <br><br>So when Gon told him to stay out of the fight with Pitou because it didn't concern him that really hurt. Remember when Killua told him to calm down, Gon said "it's easy for you"? that's the key moment</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Took me 10 hours but It finally finished, can't wait to watch it all over again  <br>Same as this person <br>Go read the series from chapter 1. Because hate to break it to you but that's wrong.</br></br>  <br> FLAC <br><br>for what purpose</br></br></br>  <br>if you're talking about how gon meets kite for the first time or the bear then I don't see where I'm wrong</br>  <br> level 1 reader <br><br>Hate to break it to you but you need to fuck off back to reddit</br></br></br>  <br>a /g/ meme</br>  <br>You are. Again go read chapter 1. <br><br><br> says the person who admitted to not really reading the manga <br>Never been on there, never going to . Also not changing the fact that you're wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you even speak english you illiterate retard?<br><br> Which is why he went through all that for Kite, who he met just once before.  <br><br>Yeah, I implied they've met before.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> During CA arc though gon meets Kite who he sees for the first time as a father figure <br>I don't know if you're implying that Gon met Kite for the first time during the CA arc, but you're wrong if that's the case.<br><br>Also i don't have the same interpretation as you. Gon felt guilty and weak for being a liability to Kite and playing a role in his death, two things he didn't know how to handle (see the exam arc after Hisoka's punch and the scene after he cries when he fails to defeat Knuckle). When he was denied of his revenge, he felt even weaker and powerless. I think Gon-san was a manifestation of his desire to "be strong", but even he knew it wasn't solving anything and was solely for revenge and self-punishment.<br><br>About what he said to Killua, i'm still having a hard time understanding. I think it's related to the fact that Killua changed his course to help Ikalgo a few moments before that scene, but there's definitely more to it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Have you actually read the series or did you just wiki the summary?</br>  <br>First off, I don't know why you keep repeating "chapter 1" like it's some obscure nugget of information tucked away that nobody knows about but you.<br><br>They've recapped the fact that Kite met Gon way back even at the beginning of the ant arc.<br><br>Secondly, do you honestly think Killua would go crazy and sacrifice everything for revenge for anyone else besides Gon?<br><br> They have two fundamentally different personalities.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess Gon noticed Killua didn't really care about Kite? Killua even confirmed it in his thoughts.</br>  <br>I've read the series, that's why I said that you're wrong. Again you yourself admitted to merely skimming the manga and not paying attention, if you did then you'd know what really caused the rift.</br>  <br>It's not that Killua didn't care about Kite, it's that he's just incapable of feeling strong enough motions to sacrifice himself like that, needle or no needle. <br><br>Replace Kite with Kurapika or Leorio and you'd get the same thing. Gon would sacrifice himself. Killua would be angry and want revenge but still be able to think things through collectedly.</br></br></br>  <br>You're not talking to same anon, also this may come as a surprise to you but the 2011 adaptation actually changed Gon and Kite's first meeting, and then every scene afterwards when Gon talks about Kite, that's why I say to go read the first chapter.</br>  <br> I've read the series <br><br>Then go back and read it again. And when you're finished, get a dictionary, find a couple of people who aren't retarded, and ask them to help you read it once more. <br><br>After that you may retire back to reddit and kill yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't mention chapter 1 anywhere anon. I even suggested that i might have misunderstood what that anon meant. Calm down. <br>Also they didn't "recap", they changed the story.<br><br>Also i don't see how what you said about Killua has anything to do with my post.</br></br></br></br>  Who is the best character and why is it Leorio?  <br>He outright admits to not caring in the manga.</br>   end of the hiatus <br>Bullshit.</br>  <br>No anon, you gotta believe we're getting SIX whole chapters this year before Togashi-sensei needs another rest.</br>  <br> Being this retarded </br>  <br> says the person who outright admits to not reading the arc in the manga <br><br>Is it really too much to handle the fact that anime just didn't adapt it correctly or changed things which is why I say to actually go read the manga?</br></br></br>  <br>First of all, my point wasn't based on 2011's adaptation of Gon and Kite's first meeting. You're attacking a strawman. <br><br>It sounds like you're implying that Gon wouldn't risk his life for anyone besides Kite because they have some special connection.<br><br>Gon would have done the same for just about any other character he has spent time with. The meeting with Kite doesn't matter. That's just how he is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't remind anon. That way it doesn't hurt as much when it ends.</br>  <br>No idiot. You keep implying that Killua's mad because Gon and Kite met at the beginning of the series without him? Do you have any idea how retarded you sound?</br>  <br>  would have done the same for just about any other character he has spent time with. <br>Are you sure? I doubt he'd react the same way if he hadn't played a role in their death. If Pitou just killed Kite in a way that had nothing to do with Gon, i don't think he'd have flipped out nearly as much.</br></br>  <br>where was I wrong I've read the manga and seen the original up to GI final, just elaborate yourself instead of pointing out suggestion so we can have an actual discussion</br>  <br><br>Gon would've blamed himself no matter what the scenario was. That's just survivor's guilt.</br></br>  <br>Except you're the one who brings up the episode recap of the 2011 anime, also you're attempting to change the subject. <br><br>Your idea on why he's mad is wrong.<br><br><br>Never once implied that though, is you're reading comprehension that bad?<br><br>All I said was that Killua admits to not caring about Kite, which is true he doesn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is literally how retarded if things went according to your interpration<br><br> Killua: Wow I can't believe Gon met Kite before. I'm so jealous! I can't believe he has this special connection with Kite that I didn't know about. I'm so cross with him! <br><br>You have the reading comprehension of a 5 year old seriously</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>It's what this person said,<br> <br>Something to remember is that 2011 Gon is actually different from manga Gon. 2011 also did a bad job of showing Killua's mindset during the arc. It wasn't the removed needle causing the insecurity, it was there before Killua removed it. The insecurity was caused by Killua himself overthinking things.<br><br>Also over the course of the CA arc we do see that Killua is quite capable connecting with others, he just chooses not to. <br><br>To Gon, Kite was an important person, the manga nails this point home by constantly having Gon talk about him over and over again (which 2011 cuts out). Kite was Gon's mentor. <br><br>What made Killua so upset during the arc was that he genuinely didn't care about Kite, but just wanted Gon to be at the center of Gon's attention, to the point that he ignored and even enabled Gon's traumatized state. Then when shit hit the fan, and Gon was broken, Killua finally told Gon to stop, but by then it was too late. Killua even admits that he's tantrum at the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  And go.  <br>He's not wrong,though.</br>  <br> Start talking about Danna ga Nani wo Itteru ka Wakaranaiken <br> "What does that mean" <br> "I don't know" <br> "OH" </br></br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with Kino no Tabi?</br>  <br>You're the only faggot in this case,though.</br>  <br> he still hasn't watched clannad <br> he watched Mikagura instead </br></br>    <br>Well, technically yeah.
