Making graphics better, taking the scenartio to another level, but the base stays the same. <br> They want to make the player think "nostalgic but fresh" about some things they see in the game, move his feelings by some things, suprise him, and to give it all Type-Moon has. <br><br>[About the setting change]<br> The setting now change from a city that resembled "vaguely Tokyo suburbs" to pretty clearly "Tokyo metropolitan area". The scale of the incidents doesn't change, but the new scale of the setting might affect the story in some way, pls look forward to it. <br> Long talk about how different settings might feel. Original Tsukihime and Mahoyo are kinda like "what if something happened here" to new "big cities are scary, isn't it, things like this happen in big cities". <br> Takeuchi says a big city is more fit for modern vampire stories.  <br> They're talking about how they did location scounting around Tokyo, but won't say which specific places are inspired by. They don't want the players to know what to specifically look forwatd ro yet. <br> The Toono mansion and the school are being remade in details. The mansion will still be Western style and will feel like the best place for murder incidents to happen.  <br> They're talking about the 3D image of the mansion that's on a different page. Takeuchi is making a 3D model of it, which makes drawing easier, but it's also hard, since he needs to create all the details and mind object collisions.  <br> Nasu says that when you add the characters and text it really feels like a proper mystery/horror etc. and is really happy to be making a hype of game he likes. <br> Talk about how the mansion doesn't really look scary at night, but gets ominous at night, like Resi 1 mansion. <br>(cont.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>(cont.)<br> They're asked if there'll be elements of local folklore/traditions - basically what people talk about between themselves and pass it. Since the scale of the setting has changed, it might be about how Toonos got the mansion and th lands around.  <br><br>[About the character design change]<br> Takeuchi says he created a more modern designs while for example keeping the image of Arcueid as "pure white" vampire.  <br> Also pls get used to the new designs already.  <br> Nasu asks if because of the change of setting he gave Arcueif a miniskirt.  <br> Not really, but...

Remake won't be out for 4 or 5 years and translation will take at least 1 but more likely 5 years.</br>  <br>Read Hollow Ataraxia</br>  <br>Read DDD.</br>  <br>He's always done that.</br>  <br>Please don't remind me.<br><br>;_;</br></br></br>  <br> translation will take at least 1 but more likely 5 years <br>Depends on who's translating it, Mahoyo's Thai translation only took 9 months, and F/HA was translated into Italian in less than two years.</br></br>  <br> Their nature is close to the evil gods of a certain fictional mythology popular in the 20th century. <br>It's even mentioned directly, I don't know what the fuck he was smoking.</br></br>  <br> DDD3 won't happen until after Mahoyo 3 is released </br>    <br>If /a/ knows how to edit and program I wouldn't mind live translating it.</br>  <br>I hope the shirt is still in.</br>  <br> Kouma was never really trained so much, <br><br>In his on-screen appearances (that aren't imaginary), yeah. He did eventually get it, though. His current whereabouts are off training in the mountains by punching boulders apart. Hrm, perhaps "training" is a misnomer - honing his skills/innate talents, basically.<br><br>But yeah, that's kind of what I was referencing before. Even without training and while insane, he was still a considerable threat. Although, I would actually say the reason he's so able to kill while Akiha isn't is because the inversion impulse has shucked away his inhibitions. I can't imagine him taking on Ciel or Arc or a Servant even if he was lucid. That's actually why I mentioned his MEoDP which works on similar principles to Akiha's plundering - absorbing odic force. If he was actually primed for combat beyond his base mentality, he actually might be quite dangerous because he does have a means of attacking on a conceptual level.<br><br>However, nothing beats a fully-incarnated Roa in his body.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not using the Melty Blood designs <br><br>shit nigga what are you doing</br></br></br>  <br>These designs are five years old</br>  DDD2 ending was full trainwreck. I glad last chapter was a dream<br><br>Tell me how to draw different anime faces.<br>Shiki for example. Everything is about eyes and hairs.</br></br></br>  When should non-leak scans start coming through?  <br>Wait is Mahoyo translated?<br><br>If so, where do I get it?</br></br></br>  <br>I think he confused DDD's True Demons with Nasuverse's ones. They aren't the same.</br>  <br> DDD2 ending was full trainwreck. I glad last chapter was a dream <br><br>Oh please tell me it was a dream. That last chapter was so fucking dumb.</br></br></br>  <br>If you know French then it is,</br>    <br><br>It was definitely a dream. But it spawned some side stories explaining the powers of the people in the Ward D.</br></br>  <br>Yes but in acknowledging them it acknowledged the same concept of god was in play basically.<br><br>If demons are fallible and pointless, then god is perfect and flawless. Demons can't help fucking around with humans since they're flawed and stupid, but the more perfect an existence is out there the more on its own it is there.</br></br></br>  <br>A new character making its appearance into the world of Tsukihime. That cheerful expression may give a friendly impression, however....<br><br><br>B-but he got a call of Tomato saying Origa was going crazy. There's a chance it'll happen. It was an interesting chapter, I liked it. Hirumiya a cute.</br></br></br></br>  <br> however.... <br>Oh boy here we go<br>Also what about red text, it's something she said right?</br></br></br>  <br>True Ancestors?<br><br>They're alien vampires that sometimes are closer to the existence of a planet than a vampire. There were a lot of them, they couldn't all be on the level of a planet, but Arc was supposedly the best or something as she killed the others. When she regained her sanity she got in contract with Gaia, and they made a contract so she was given access rights.<br><br>Gaia used to know her Pappy after all</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Demonic presence in DDD is still mystery. It's 100% not "psychology" phenomenon.</br>    <br>C-cute</br>    <br>I mean TA as in Archetype earth or arcueid<br>So the Types aren't god in any sense? I thought at first because the post mentioned piece of planet that Types = god</br></br>  Is there someone willing enough to edit some proper vents on remake arc when the vn comes out?  <br>TAs are more fairies than aliens or vampires. They don't make contracts with Gaia, they are born as part of Gaia.</br>  <br>Most gods are basically elementals, which are below the planet in nature. Since they're parts of the planet that gained worship to stand out, but they still cannot surpass the planet itself.</br>  <br>Looks better in my opinion.</br>  <br>Make it without glasses</br>  <br> Alien vampires closer to the existence of a planet <br><br>Not even.</br></br></br>  <br>No, they are higher than gods.

"Al-right. Calm down and take your seat, monkeys. It's great that you're so lively, but if you're not going act human Sensei won't be able to go easy on you, and that'd be terrible."</br>  <br><br>This is inaccurate.<br><br>Essentially, Gaia needed help creating a tangible counterforce. It created Primate Murder at some unspecified time in the past, but Gaia had other "plans" for humanity (insofar as it as a force is capable of planning) and so culling them whenever they became unruly was not ideal. Enter Crimson Moon Brunestud, who agreed to allow Gaia to create agents of its "will" based on him/itself. True Ancestors are the "touch of the planet," they're sapient sensory organs for a force whose existence is beyond human comprehension, that of our planet itself. Brunestud, however, had ulterior motives (he wanted to use them as additional bodies to incarnate into should he be destroyed), and all of the True Ancestors inherited a key imperfection of his - his hunger for blood. This is what leads to Demon Lords (note the parallels with Demons who are spawned from corrupted Elementals).<br><br>For Brunestud to incarnate into a True Ancestor, they must be a "perfect" equivalent to him. Arcueid was the closest shinso to this definition and also the most powerful of them all. She was created specifically to have no real self of her own and only to carry out the necessary destruction of Demon Lords and rampant DAAs. However, the True Ancestors tried to get Roa to teach her and all the bad shit went down with him feeding her blood (this is apparently a retcon, though), ending in the destruction of almost all of them.<br><br>Arc made no contract with Gaia. She has an innate connection. All True Ancestors do. They're like elementals but on a much, much higher level.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not even. <br>True Ancestors are technically spawns of Crimson Moon, given form by Gaia.</br></br>  <br>Live-in Student<br><br>1<br>Gray: Good morning, master.<br>2<br>Waver: Morning, Gray.

Original Arc's hair and skirt had length enough to swirl about her when she moved, new Arc's don't.  <br>Have respect for Takahashi.</br>  <br>arc is so much more attractive with that skirt and those shoes<br><br>fuck miniskirt shit</br></br></br>  <br>This shit has so many bs scenes... kinda weird that this one is the only that i think that can actually happen.</br>  <br> being this new </br>  <br>BB threatening to unplug the whole thing and getting lots of complaints from other alien lifeforms, I don't remember the exact point but it was near the end.</br>  <br>Arc is probably the only redesign that I really don't like.<br><br>Maybe Ciel too, since she turned into a generic megane slut.</br></br></br>  <br>Shiki &gt; Shirou in hotness</br>  <br>arc photoshops when?</br>  <br><br><br>My body isn't ready for Nanaya.</br></br></br>  <br>That is one ugly ass courtyard. Even symmetry doesn't save it.</br>  <br>Well she's supposed to be cute school girl and not a snarky sick killer.</br>  <br>I'm actually okay with Arc in a miniskirt, just not one that's as short as it is.<br><br>It hadn't even occurred to me that something was off with new Arc's footwear until now, but as much as I like the boots the original shoes are superior. They certainly wouldn't work with any kind of miniskirt, though.</br></br></br>  <br>The whole Enum Elish vs Nero thing also kinda makes sense.</br>  <br>MOOOODDDSSS</br>  <br>Is Arc's lust for dicks greater than her lust for blood?</br>  <br>It looks like a pokemon arena.</br>  <br>I never understood that ending. Aren't Gil and Hakuno still trapped within the moon cell in the normal end? Or how did Gil break out and Hakuno retains her memories?</br>  <br><br>Someone do one with MEoDP</br></br>  <br>Well yeah, despite people posting it a lot as proof, it is just a doujinshi. A lot of things that happen there aren't how they should play out according to interviews, and even Crazy Clover admits they're bigger Tsuki fans so they tended to push that side in the first few issues before trying to dial it back near the end.<br><br>Which created its own problems as we had shit like Shirou having to be the one to take Prime Roa down, which was odd as well. Ciel outspeeding and beating Medusa who's on Bellerophon, when Ciel can match a servant with an average NP when she's fighting defensively at best, it made the Tsuki side really dominate early on in a bad way.<br><br>It was well drawn, a lot of shit really would not turn out like that, but as long as its taken for the doujinshi it is its fine. It will always have an odd rap since that's the doujinshi that launched a million power level discussions since Shikifans posted the Berserker page on a daily basis for a year or two as it always turned out the same way.<br><br>It's like an autism magnet</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And still no anime. Such a pity.</br>  <br>tfw when he is Archerkles.</br>  <br>I mean that originally, she looked more 'homely' and geeky. It was a good contrast with her real self as a professional killer. <br><br>New Ciel doesn't give me the same impression at all. She's too pretty.</br></br></br>  Do you think we will get an OP animated by a big studio?   2015 <br> People are still obsessed about granny Arc design. </br>  <br>It specifically says he saved a lot of people in a battle with his bow, so probably other guy.</br>  <br> a million power level discussions since Shikifans posted the Berserker page on a daily basis for a year or two as it always turned out the same way. <br>Proof that they are fucking cancer.</br></br>  <br>Hopefully Ufotable gets to do it.</br>  <br>The possibility exist.<br>they kinda look alike</br></br>  <br>It's a Gilgamesh-Shirou mashup</br>  <br> wanting ufotable to touch tsukihime after the shitshow that was F/SN:UBW </br>  <br>They're 1500 light years from Earth, but still within the virtual network.<br><br>However they're in the virtual network of another planet, since the Mooncell Network goes throughout the galaxy or more.<br><br>http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthrea<wbr>d.php/3574-Fate-Extra-CCC-Translati<wbr>ons-SPOILERS?p=1273825&amp;viewfull=1#p<wbr>ost1273825<br><br>Just read it here</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not liking granny skirt </br>  <br>Herkules Main weapon was the Bow.</br>  <br>Doesn't Gilgamesh represent a part of Shirou anyway?</br>  <br>It doesn't fit his description at all though.</br>  <br>Arc is a pure!</br>  <br>Mostly about skirt really. <br>As  shows, it does have it's perks.

I really liked them and would gladly see Tsukihime get something similar.</br>  <br>Yeah I know, but he doesn't fit the description or that very specific thing.

It also gave Arc's design an ambiguous age, making it easier to accept her being centuries old, while the new one just makes her look like a typical schoolgirl.</br>  What happened to the BD subs for Symphogear G? I'm trying to finish the series but there are no subs to be found.  <br>Ask commie.</br>  <br>It's not like Commie has to be the only group that does it.

It does have some yuri, yes, but it would be just as amazing without it.</br></br>  <br>Symphogear has the same writer as WA and is full of references to it. You should try actually watching the shows you have an opinion of.</br>  What does it mean?  <br>Wait until TGS.</br>  <br>It has sitting on my HD for about a year now and just can't mustered the desire to watch it. I like magical girl shows but I can't stand yuribait.

But DP was still a great season.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So the explanation for how they got out is finished that quickly that they can chill with the rest of the girls on the first episode?

That was really useful.</br></br>  <br>It's pretty straight forward and you can figure out what it's trying to say.</br>  <br>As for singing while singing anyhow, in regard to fighting there is a self-confidence which is not defeated by anyone<br>or<br>Singing is singing anyway for that fight is confident that he will not lose to anyone.<br>or<br>I have confidence while singing anyway nothing to sing fight when it comes second to none</br></br></br></br></br>  Why is Chris so perfect?  <br><br>Fucking hell I hate this picture so much.</br></br>  <br>Something about zenbus.</br>  <br>How can anyone watch anime with subs in their native language? I pity the english native cucks, I know I wouldn't be able to bear all the cringe.</br>  <br>I rend pussy asunder at simple singing, of course, but even at singing and fighting at the same time I am still the child genius.</br>  <br>I think any language is okay so long as it's not overly localized.<br>I have trouble reading subs from Spain, and I can imagine murricans would have trouble taking subs in britbong speak seriously.</br></br>  <br>さすがこども先生</br>  <br>Same.

Loved the ones in G.</br>  <br>No. That is a completely normal feeling.</br>  <br>It's only healthy my friend.</br>  <br>I'm always hype for those.

It's said only  Hibiki 's new battle song is in episode 1.</br>  <br>What, really? What's the context then? Karaoke with Maria?</br>  <br>Interesting. I can already imagine when  Hibiki  will sing but not  Tsubasa  Makes me wonder when will she find time to sing if not the battle.</br>  <br>maybe it's a solo concert and maria is a surprise guest</br>  <br>That'll explain the  my friend  comment since it can serve as an introduction.</br>  <br><br>That's plausible.</br></br>  <br>It would also make sense that the song has an english title, her other idol-song "flight feathers" also had one</br>  <br>It would be weird if you weren't</br>  <br> COMMUNICATION </br>  ・G最後に宇宙に行った遺跡からマムの遺体と一緒に帰ってきた <br>アメリカのスペースシャトルが制御不能で墜落危機 <br>・響翼クリスで救出（PVの合唱曲） <br><br>・みんなで学校パート（切歌調はリディアンに転入済） <br>・翼マリアがロンドンでライブ（響たちはクリス宅で視聴） <br>・視聴中に火災？事故？っぽい連絡、響クリスが対処に向かう <br>・ロンドンでマリアがファラに襲われる <br>・助けた翼とファラの戦闘 <br><br>・響が火災現場から子供を救出（このへんで響の変身バンク＆ソロ曲） <br>・救出後、響がキャロルと遭遇</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So,  the shuttle scene  is this season equivalent of G's train scene?</br>  <br>Story spoiler<br><br> <br>UN's space shuttle went to the ruin on the moon and carried Mom's body back.

Why would they attack her? Unless they let her keep her relic because it's broken.</br>  <br>Aoi is the best</br>  <br>Huh, I thought they'd just forget the body up there, never bring it up again and move on. That's surprising. I wonder what they want it for.<br><br><br>  Maybe something related to Mom and why they felt the need to bring it back? Hibiki was attacked too. Maybe it's a gungnir user thing. </br></br></br></br>  <br> Maybe they want to clone it and create a 17 year old mamu to cause Maria more suffering. Or her dead body is inhabited by custodian parasites. </br>  <br> Implying it won't be Shin Symphogear </br>  <br>She kind of saved the earth, and if they were up there investigating Custodian tech anyway (as suggested by that text scrawl in the PV), it's worth recovering her corpse while they're there and bringing it home.</br>  <br>Why is Aoi so perfect?</br>  <br> I wonder what they want it for. <br>I'd send a space shuttle up there to get that sweet as fucking transforming jetpowered wheelchair and you sure as hell would too</br></br>  <br>Wait, shit seriously? <br><br>I mean I guess what little Naruto I watched was the dub, but I never would've guessed</br></br></br>  <br>  Mom becomes an anti-spiral and joins up with Ver again. </br>  Re-birthday preview this Thursday.  <br>The hype never ends!</br>  <br><br>I'm afraid of   Mom's body becoming a plot point and blowing up on their faces. Like it becomes the reason why a big disaster happens and really is infested with custodian mumbo jumbo and they have to "kill" her to stop the spread. Bringing back corpses from alien places seems like they're asking for trouble. </br></br>  <br>Or  Mom is turned into a doll and Maria has to destroy her. </br>  <br>It's well seeded on Animebytes</br>  <br>And that's the reason why they only have 4 dolls + Carol when there are 6 geahs.</br>  <br> After Hibiki saved children she met Carol. <br>Cliffhanger?<br><br>inb4  Elf9 is a loli clone of Mom. </br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127389357 <br>I don't think you need to spoil the idea of an episode of Symphogear ending with a cliffhanger.</br>  <br>A first episode of a Symphogear serie without jam...<br>This is a delusion</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that's because Kirika and Shirabe are counted as one</br>  <br> I can't speak to the quality of JustCuz's <br>I can. It is garbage. Do not waste your time. The included link does not have all of the required fonts either, so you will have to extract the rest from Commie's release.</br></br>  <br>More like because Airgetlam is still broken.</br>  <br>One angsty flashback to Serena or Kanade and you got your jam quota.</br>  I can't wait to see the Symphogear Live 2013 with everybody commenting on it.  <br>   After Hibiki saved children she met Carol. <br><br>And that will be the first of exactly twelve Cliffhangers.</br></br></br>  <br>Please no more G/Geass R2 levels of retarded cliffhangers.</br>  <br>What if  Tsubasa  gets injured since the enemies are said to be strong? Protecting a powerless ally and getting hurt is common to portray a heroic moment while also giving the powerless ally a good reason to be stronger. They said she doesn't sing the battle song on the first episode so she can make a comeback on a later episode for the rematch. <br><br>Something like   Tsubasa gets hurt. Then Hibiki gets attacked for the cliffhanger. Usually, Hibiki getting attacked like that for a cliffhanger won't really surprise people but if they show another member getting hurt bad by an enemy underling and then showing the boss herself attack Hibiki, then I think it'll raise the tension. </br></br></br>  <br>We Symphogear Force.</br>  Are DMJii going to be active geahs? Weren't they linker junkies and better off finding someone more compatible to their relics while they can go enjoy a normal noiseless life?  <br>   Elf9 is a loli clone of Mom. <br><br>That should be added to the bingo.</br></br></br>  <br>They might bullshit an excuse like the x-drive from the end of G making them naturally compatible with their relics.</br>  <br>The fact that Tsubasa will be wounded is quite called... <br>In all the interviews they said that this new enemiea are fucking strong...</br></br>  <br>I bet trouble's coming for them so they have no choice. Also, I doubt they'll want to stay on the sidelines if their new friends are getting attacked and it's been said that   Maria herself gets attacked even without a gear so I don't think retiring your relic is an option right now. </br>  <br>The organization doesn't care that much about compatibility beyond minimum settings anyway. Kanade was on linker too right?</br>  <br>It's literally gonna be Force<br><br>I bet the villains are somehow gonna be immune to Symphogear powers<br><br>Prepare to see your favorite characters get humiliated</br></br></br></br></br>  It seems like King Records won't let series end in season 3.  <br>How so?</br>  <br> I bet the villains are somehow gonna be immune to Symphogear powers <br>Didn't they already have a phrase from a poster about how their "song doesn't work"?</br></br>  <br>As long as they don't force some stupid sob story on the villains and they only exist to be utterly destroyed at the end, then I'm okay with it.</br>  <br>Yep. The Symphogears were only made to fight Noise.</br>  <br>They created a Symphogear youtube channel. If they wanted to end the series they will just throw the PV to niconico as always.</br>  <br>Nephilim wasn't a Noise, and it worked pretty well.</br>  <br>Oh well, Kaneko already said they wanted to work on a movie if possible on the future.</br>  <br>Nephilim was destroyed by this way, though.</br>   people properly using spoiler tags  <br><br>After so many shit LN threads I'd forgotten what that was like.</br></br>  <br>I don't really have a problem with it if it's done well, which is rare.</br>  <br>The problem with Force was that the villains looked and acted like fanfiction inserts and yet the story expected you to sympathize with them.

Yui is just too cute and perfect and sweet, just the type of girl who doesn't win ever.  tottemo bijin  <br>S1 = fun<br>S2 = drama shit</br></br>  <br>God the old art style was gorgeous. <br><br><br> Did S2 feel like a drag while it was airing? <br>I will personally thank everybody who acknowledges this. Compared to how much I enjoyed season 1, season 2 was a tiresome, unfunny drag and I'm sick of people told by it's rabid fans that I obviously just didn't understand the retarded melodrama.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why she is so loveable? Do such girls even exist?</br>  <br>This anon knows the score.<br><br><br>She's also the only main character who didn't become retarded in season 2.</br></br></br></br>   muh real thing   <br> muh genuine girls </br>  <br> muh drama queens </br>  its amazing how much better the first 6 volumes are to the latest 5  <br>Because she was preemptively retarded?<br>[sp] We still love it though [/sp]</br></br>  <br><br>I miss this beautiful chara design.</br></br>  <br>I struggle to understand people who say the new character design is better.</br>  <br>Well, at least she is not a childhood friend and not MC's initial crush either. That alone increased her chance significantly.</br>  Remember when Yahari was fun?  <br><br> tfw you remember the 3 main characters actually used to go on interesting adventures as part of their club </br></br>  <br><br><br>The only charm that was there in S2 was by the new blonde girl, (and pales to S1 Y and Y). The only interesting character was Hayama. <br>Apparently there was supposedly an iconic moment where 8man breaks down in front of the girls, and all he can talk about is "muh real thing." I get that what follows is figuring out what this real thing is, but in this delicate moment where the trio finally reconnect, I don't even know what to feel about it.<br>I get continually teased by potential drama whenever Yukino's sister comes in when Yukino is also on the scene, but then it goes nowhere. <br>S2 was just unfulfiling.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yukino's sister went from being an interesting character to an annoying villain.</br>  <br>Haruno was right though.</br>  <br>I'm not denying that. But she was far more nuanced in season 1 and a bit less of an outright bitch.</br>  <br>Right about what? She's a fucking cunt sticking her nose where it doesn't belong because she's a no life loser with nothing better to do than insert herself into the lives of high schoolers. Haruno is fucking sad.</br>    <br> She's a fucking cunt sticking her nose where it doesn't belong because she's a no life loser with nothing better to do than insert herself into the lives of high schoolers. Haruno is fucking sad. <br>All of this is true, but she is right. A cunt. but right.</br></br>  <br>I've only seen up to episode 12 at the moment, but I don't see what she could possibly be right about. She's simply a sadist who gets off on other people's suffering.<br><br>What she needs is someone to fuck with her.</br></br></br>  <br> What she needs is someone to fuck with her. <br>Or somebody to just fuck her.</br></br>  <br><br>Even if her character lost her subtlety, I wouldn't have minded as much if there was more focus on Yukino's thoughts and behaviour. As much as I can tell, she didn't grow at all in S2, and in those scenes with both of them, all they did was establish that she needs 8man and Yui to protect her.<br>At least Yui showed a little growth by wanting both 8man and Yukino to stop putting the burdens on themselves, and willingly put herself out there to do so.<br>I'm just dissatisfied by how little growth there was to the two main girls.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I wouldn't have minded as much if there was more focus on Yukino's thoughts and behaviour <br>True. She was sidelined for a lot of S2, even though large parts of the plot related to her. It was just people discussing her rather than actual focus om her. I found that quite boring for one thing. <br><br>Also, where they hell did the classic Yukino dry wit go in S2? It was one of the primary sources of comedy on S1.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why live?  ;_; </br>  <br>Yes.  my gf </br>  <br> Also, where they hell did the classic Yukino dry wit go in S2? <br><br>Ice Queen Yukino is dead. Enjoy your stupid moeblob Yukino.</br></br></br>  <br>Its the eyes. Most distincitive part of ponkan's art and they completely remove it for s2.</br>   mfw Im deployed and I cant watch along with everyone <br><br>Who's winning?</br></br>  <br><br>Now here's the weird thing. The basic idea of Haruno's anger comes from Yukino being a total doormat, and Yukino doesn't become this until season 2, which just so happens to be when Haruno dials up her bitchiness. <br>It's like the author decided to change his fucking mind on what Yukino was about. <br>What happened to the girl who rejected Hayama's friends request because that dude was being disrespectful to 8man?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Komachi</br>  <br> alumni coming back to high school <br>I browse 4chan regularly and even I'm not that much of a loser.</br></br>  <br>I watch this only for Komachi.</br>  <br>Komachi looks so cute in season 1 compared to now.<br><br>What happened bros? What did we do to deserve this fate?</br></br></br>  <br>Why must imoutos always be best girls? Can't authors just write shitty imoutos so the MC can actually have a chance at winning best girl?</br>  <br>That she is.</br>  <br> God the old art style was gorgeous.  <br>I remember a lot of people bitching about the first season art style and saying Feel's is better.</br></br>  <br>but when they write shitty imoutos they get the worst girl anyway, or none at all, just look at oreimo.</br>  <br>Hit the nail on the head there, anon. I think the hair is also important though.<br><br><br>Not the fans anyway, anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br> It's like the author decided to change his fucking mind on what Yukino was about. <br>Which is why she's probably the only anime character to go from one of my favourites to a person that just irritates me, all in the space of one season.<br><br><br>Those people are retarded, anon. That said, Feel's animation was of a better quality - I will give them that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That said, Feel's animation was of a better quality <br><br>Different try, but I want to weigh in. It's weird because I'm even willing to concede that feels art style fit the tone of s2 better than the old style would have. Maybe that's why I miss the old style so much, it's because I miss the tone of s1?</br></br></br>  <br>Different guy*<br>Excuse me, throwing absurdly expensive phone into lake.</br></br>  <br> It's weird because I'm even willing to concede that feels art style fit the tone of s2 better than the old style would have. Maybe that's why I miss the old style so much, it's because I miss the tone of s1? <br>Very well put, anon. I would struggle to deny that the art style of S2 (as much as I hated it) gelled well with the type of show S2 of Oregairu was. Similarly, S1's art style suited the type of show S1 was. But this alone goes to show the disparity between the 2 seasons - they're almost like watching 2 different shows. <br><br>And while I'm aware that it's trite to mention it, S1's art style adheres closest to the source material - infer what you will about that and the tone etc.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yep.<br>S1 was fun, S2 was genuinely bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Subtle..</br></br>  <br> S2 was genuinely bullshit. <br>Yet /a/ and other less savory anime sites are in love with it. And any time you call them out on it, they go "2deep4u" and run away cackling to themselves.</br></br>  <br>I don't think adhering to the art style in a LN holds much importance, that's the area where you get the most freedom from the source material. Sometimes LNs have god awful art and a studio has to ignore it entirely.</br>  <br>True. I concede that it was a weak point.</br>  Why did they have to completely assassinate Yukino's character in S2. She's goes from confident and independent in S1 to being unable to make any decision and completely pushed around and dependent on everyone around her. Almost completely different characters.  <br>She's a suicidal penguin.</br>  <br> Why did they have to completely assassinate Yukino's character in S2. <br>Drama. <br><br>Well, Melodrama to be more precise.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm surprised you didn't say  forced drama </br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  Did the OST for this get released yet?  <br>Who writes an entire fucking essay on this shit? If you can't follow the cryptic melodrama shit stop watching the show, don't wait for sums autist like that guy to spell it out.</br>  <br>Y'know, when people don't pick up on a character trait as fundamental as that it either means the exposition is very bad or the audience is retarded. Normally I'd go with the latter option, but given how bad S2 was at explaining the motivations of many of its characters (seriously, unless you'd read the source material S2 is a headscratcher from episode 4 onwards), I think for once retardation may not be the cause.<br><br>It would also explain why i see so many different Secondary theories about character motivations floating around the place.</br></br></br>  <br> sums autist  <br>I take back what I said earlier, I will not throw the phone in a lake, because that is a beautiful thing it has just done to my post.</br></br>  <br>I can understand the development, but spending 1 season developing a character one way, only to pull a complete 180 the next season is jarring and ruins the story flow. This is on top of the complete change of pace of the plot as a whole.<br><br>And besides, the whole car accident thing was bullshit anyway. She was sitting in the back, she has literally 0 responsibility for the event.</br></br></br>  <br> If you can't follow the cryptic melodrama shit stop watching the show, don't wait for sums autist like that guy to spell it out. <br>Or more accurately, if you need an autist to explain a rom-com to you, either than rom-com is bad or you're just retarded.<br><br><br> She was sitting in the back, she has literally 0 responsibility for the event. <br>Yeah, but muh melodrama.<br><br><br>That's a dirty word these days, anon</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm an anime only watcher, most of this shit was based on my knowledge of the first season. Because I understood the first season very well and what the characters were actually about, it was very easy for me to glide into season 2 and the themes they were exploring.</br>  <br>Well you're a better man than I in that case. Early in season 2 I came to the discussion threads looking for autists to explain in overly verbose ways what the fuck was going on, but as the season progressed I just got sick of it all. I did finish watching it though - clutching to the vague hope that the season might improve when Yukino stopped being mopey all the time. Boy was I wrong....</br>  <br> autists understanding human relations <br>You should pick a better buzzword to use.</br></br>  <br>I'm the same. I know that makes a prime target for people who use the term "2deep4u" unironically, but I think people are failing to consider how different S1 and S2 are. This distinction alone would inevitably cause many fans of season 1 to dislike season 2 and therefore just not be willing to commit the effort to understanding all the melodrama. <br><br><br>Eh, there are certain types of autist who are very good at analysing human relations, but can't hack them in reality at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Who writes an entire fucking essay on this shit <br>I did.<br><br> but spending 1 season developing a character one way, only to pull a complete 180 the next season is jarring and ruins the story flow <br>But that's wrong. Yukino has always been a fragile girl with self-esteem issues. Listen to what Sensei and Haruno have to say about her during the first season. She only covered her weaknesses with the Ice Queen personality she created in order to push the world away from her. After allowing friends into her life, she has slowly started to lower said walls, but now she has become a bit too dependent on Hachiman and Yui. The final episode ends basically, with Yukino having to find inner strength and having to find a happy medium between S1 Yukino and S2 Yukino.<br><br><br><br>Well the problem is, that Yahari threads have been going on 24/7 for the past couple of months. A lot of it has been memebullshit, however a lot of it has also been actual discussion about what's been going on. But, since the threads go so fast, if you've missed it, you've missed it. Also people get tired having to explain the same shit over and over again, which is why they resort to things like: read the LN, go do this, go watch it again etc. Not entirely fair, but eh.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> however a lot of it has also been actual discussion about what's been going on. But, since the threads go so fast, if you've missed it, you've missed it. <br>Yeah, I thought as much. That and the fact that if I have to actually have things explained to me in a rom com on a regular basis, I'm gonna start losing interest in that rom-com and any discussion of it.</br></br>  <br>Well it basically transitioned from a romcom to a romance melodrama without really admitting to it. I can completely understand why people would enjoy s1 and then want to bail during s2. It's not exactly what they signed up for. Some people like the guy you're responding to and myself have just taken it in stride. In my own case at least it's due to how likable so many of the characters are, which makes you think about why the change occurred in Yukino, and in turn makes you look for the way she'll come out the other side of this more likable again.</br>  <br> Well it basically transitioned from a romcom to a romance melodrama without really admitting to it. <br>Well said. The tone shift was off the wall. Even the way the show is structured was changed. Season 1 had 3 episode arcs focusing on tasks assigned to the club, with over-arching plot threads progressing in the background and during key scenes. Personally I'm a fan of that structure. What I don't like is a never-ending wave of melodrama surging along for 13 episodes, which very little in the line of arcs.</br></br>  <br>In that case the show may just not be for you anymore. I'm lucky in that I happen to enjoy cryptic melodrama stuff, so the show hasn't lost its appeal.</br>  <br>Yeah, if there's a season 3 I probably won't watch it.</br>  <br>Not that guy, but I'm following your posts.<br>It was always a given that Yukinos strong persona was a front, and that her mother and sister saw through it.<br>My problem is that it became the 8man show, and that not enough attention was given to Yui or Yukino to detail their development. There were a few instances where Haruno gives shit to Yukino, and all I gained from that is that Y needs 8man and Yui to save her. Yukino also seemed to switch her natural response to uncomfortable situations, where she used to deflect with caustic remarks, now she just clams up. She also regains her best friend after the real thing talk, but she doesn't have a meaningful conversation until the end of the season.<br>I don't know what the author was trying to do with Yukino and Yui in S2.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that might be a good way to put it, the second season was focused on 8man's development more than anything.</br>  <br><br>The story was told from 8man's POV, m8.</br></br>  <br>The first season detailed yui and yukino's developments better though. Season two focused on his own. The perspective did not change, just the focus.</br>  <br>But so was season 1.</br>  <br>Is it? For me it's still the same though. Well, maybe because 8man himself is not really an empty character and does anyone remember what Hiratsuka sensei said by the end of school festival?<br><br>So, Yui and Yukino did have their development and it actually as vocal as 8man was. But because the POV and 8man himself went trough dramatic change, so it felt like 8man's character overshadowing the other two.<br><br> Actually, I felt that Yui had far more prominent development though? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Up until episode 8 with muh genuine, since then the development has been in Yukino's court. And before you start saying "what development, she's only regressed as a character", well she has started to be a lot more open with her emotions towards her friends. However, she still suffers from low self-esteem and there's her family problems. Pretty much every time Haruno or her mother interact with her, she clams up. During episode 13, right up until the last 2 minutes or so, Yukino was at her lowest point in the series. She shed her ice queen facade/lowered her defenses and became more vulnerable, Haruno and her mother have been wearing her down for the last couple of episodes and her relationship with her friends (Yui and 8man) has been very fragile. She has started to develop romantic feelings for 8man, but somewhere during the last episodes, becomes aware that Yui also has feelings for him. Confessing said feelings could ruin her friendship with these two, in which case she'd be all alone again. Clearly she doesn't want that (this feeling also goes for 8man and Yui). They start preserving the status quo like Hayato's group, by pretending that nothing's going on, but Haruno kicks them back into gear saying that what they're doing isn't genuine, something 8man (and Yukino) have made such a huge fuss over. So, in the last episode Yui pulls a Hachiman and forces Yukino and 8man to either stay with the status quo and stay together but in a fake way, or to risk it all, but come out with genuine bonds at the end.<br><br>Yukino's final character development will be finding a happy medium between Cold Ice Queen competent Yukino and fragile dere Yukino. Because she has friends now, they can give her a confidence boost to finally stand up to her family. The final stretch of the series is definitely going to be Yukino-centric.</br></br></br>  Yui is going to turn into her mother in 20 years.  <br>This face sealed the deal.</br>  <br>Yukino has the most development, but it's so extreme that it's probably jarring to some people. Hence the complaints between season 1 and season 2.<br><br>Volume 11 definitely irked me with how extreme Watari is handling her, but if he can wrap it all up excellently and then some, I'll be a happy camper. Then again, I'm not sure if I should expect that much from a light novel author.<br><br> I hate this. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You say that like it's a bad thing.</br>  She makes me want to hug her.  <br>I'm not gonna fap for today anymore.</br>  <br>Because, with most other anime, there isn't a whole lot to discuss.<br>Yahari ended in a cliffhanger that will be decided not by deus ex machina (hopefully), but by the actions of the characters. The characters inner thoughts aren't entirely revealed, so the ending is uncertain. That's why there's so much talk.<br><br>That said, S1 was definitely more fun. S2 had Hayama vs 8man, so it wasn't all that bad.</br></br></br></br>  <br> S2 had Hayama vs 8man <br>I found that it became tiresome after a while. All they did is say the same things to each other repeatedly.</br></br>  <br>Don't worry, she'll come out stronger and more  genuine  than ever.<br><br>The only huge uncertainty is who Hachiman is going to end up with, if anyone.</br></br></br>  <br>does S2 have sensei?</br>  <br>Technically - an uglier, less funny sensei.</br>  <br>I'm not denying that Yukino underwent development, she clearly did, but so much of the story in the second season focused on 8man's development, much of which took place before muh genuine, and we're left to watch Yukino's developments occur in jumps.</br>  <br>are we talking about the same person?</br>  <br>You tell me.</br>  <br>yeah<br><br>they made zero headway into that particular subplot, though it probably is connected to yukino's family situation.<br><br>they just presented it, left it out in the sun, and let it stagnate.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok. That's fair, I personally also had some trouble following what exactly was going on at some points (as an anime only watcher), but after re-watching a couple of parts/episodes (definitely if you have knowledge of future episodes) a lot of things become clearer.</br>  I will marry Yuigahama Yui!

Dumping a 3-volume superhero manga by Takao Saito (Golgo 13). Crunchyroll published this a while back, along with a few other Takao series. A kind anon ripped them.<br><br> Takeshi and Kentaro are two friends who have been together since they were infants. They were born in the same hospital on the same day, have shared every class in school and even vie over the same girl. However, soon the two friends become closer than they'd like when they discover they are the Chosen Ones that will defeat the powers of an evil being and his minions who are currently wreaking havoc on mankind. Together, the two merge and become a super fighter known as Barom One, capable of taking down monsters with ease. Can Takeshi and Kentaro band together to save the world? </br></br>                        Is it actually any good?

KnB takes the cover. I do see a color sample, but even ants would complain.  Forced animation.  New chapter of RP. <br>It's rather cute. Kaijou goes on a group date  and ends up getting carried away in bball talk. <br><br>http://plus.shonenjump.com/client_i<wbr>nfo/SHUEISHA/html/player/viewer.htm<wbr>l?tw=1&amp;lin=1&amp;cid=SHSA_JP01PLUS00001<wbr>850_57</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Are you ready for kiseki on the beach next chapter?</br>  <br>Kise in Extra Game looks like old Haizaki...</br>  <br>You must be new then.</br>    <br>That Reo lust</br>  Visual for Kurobas Cup 2015.<br>What do you think of the ts? Rather nice step up from last years'.<br><br>That would be sweet. We've had little sol in this series.</br></br></br>  Good bye kisekis  Thanks for everything, Kagami.<br><br>Everyone else too, but Kagami in particular. It wouldn't've been the same without you.</br></br>  <br>They're in middle of a match, dude.</br>  <br>Were you here all this time?</br>    Sunma has been sharing some pics of the VAs.  Up on Daisuki.  <br>Same here. I'll finish off with the last official birdies of the season. <br><br>It's been a blast these past few years. Thanks for the fun, bros.<br><br>It's weird. I know we still have EG, but it's like the series ends today instead of a new chapter. I'm not sure why. Maybe it's just the change of pace. <br><br>Anyway, if there's one thing we get from the sequel, I'd love no drama streetball time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I feel empty.  <br>He's still scared of that dog?</br>  <br>Thanks to Kuroko's training, Kagami has made progress but he can get startled when taken by surprise. I'm sure that also warms Kuroko's heart.</br>  http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>06641</wbr>  <br>Some super good americans came to Japan and shit on everyone, and of course they're assholes who talk about others as "monkeys". To counter that, a new team is formed and GUESS WHO is in the team ? The whole generation of miracles + super mario.</br>  Is Extra Game monthly or what? It began back in December, but there are just 3 chapters.  Is this series worth watching?<br>How gay is it?</br>    <br>not as gay as free!</br>  <br>Aomine is still mad that noone wants to grope his ass.</br>  <br>Next only runs ever other month.<br><br>More like no one dare to.</br></br></br>  Kaida Yuki shared a close up of her sign board.  Will HorribleSubs release this episode?  <br> fist bumps, protected sex <br><br>The fist bump was the ultimate sign of recognition and respect that Kuroko had to gain from Aomine and Kagami after dedicating his whole body to the bball. No protection when you reach that level.</br></br></br>  <br>yes, they take a while to up it tho</br>  <br>No I'm just not here all the time but lately I haven't seen a single thread in a few months.</br>  Does that mean there won't be anymore playing with balls threads anymore?  <br><br><br>See you every two months.</br></br></br>    By the way, subs are out. Go and get them form nyaa.  OH FUUUCK<br>This the loudest Kuroko ever<br>I CAME</br></br>  <br>Satsuki with her ponytail looks so pretty.</br>  <br><br>Actual Basketball harem when?</br></br>  <br>Isn't Extra Game exactly that?</br>  I will miss them.  Check the official accounts for pics. Looks like their final episode viewing party was fun, and these two have clearly become the best of bros.<br><br>Don't be silly, they're just bros looking out. <br><br>Except for that 3p.</br></br></br></br>  Long time no hear Can Do  <br>Not super good. Just a decent street ball team. I think they beat a Japanese college team or something</br>  <br>Why the fuck my nigga wearing a tonic water shirt</br>  ;_;  <br>He likes to drink it.</br>  <br> Purple drinking anything with zero sugar <br><br>What? <br>Though I was happy to see him in winter gear. Truly prime nap-upon and get warm material.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit, I confused tonic with seltzer.</br>  Are there any other sports anime/manga or just any anime/manga with a mostly male cast similar to KnB? Like this anon  said, almost everyone I've seen is some faggy shit where the cast might as well been girls.  <br>I'm surprised to see anyone say that about Baby Steps at all. I do only watch the anime, but I have found none of the guys to be like that.</br>  <br>Major<br>One Outs<br>Slam Dunk<br>Hajime no Ippo<br>Ashita no Joe<br>Ping Pong</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Towards wasn't all that daffy either.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br> Towards  <br> daffy <br><br>YowaPeda and faggy.

Best team.</br></br></br>  <br>That was awesome.<br>The very first opening in the final episode of the anime, happens very often on animes but never ceases to amaze me.</br></br>   KnB dead <br> DnA threads dead as fuck <br> no new sports anime next season <br>Well shit</br></br></br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  It was a fun ride guys.<br><br>This is the end.</br></br>  The cutest.  <br>Tl out or you listened on your own?<br>But I do love that team. It was great to see Midorima finally start to develop some camaraderie with his mates. Damn good game.<br><br>Yeah, it's the first time in a while since we've been without. On the other hand, I will have a chance to marathon the rest of Daiya and a few others. See you around there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kuroko is love, Kuroko is life.</br>  <br>At least Haikyuu is starting up again in Fall</br>  <br>A link was posted on weibo. <br>http://www.bilibili.com/video/av249<wbr>9163/<br><br>Also, Green playing Catal Rhythm on piano with Takao singing along.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>There have been a thread every saturday for the past two months, are you blind?</br>  <br>6 months actually</br>  So, I suppose I'll see you all again in the Haikyuu/Yowapedal/Homo threads, right?  <br>I find this pic more disturbing than the lobster one. What am I even looking at?</br>  <br>Dead of mister cicada.</br>  <br>Maybe not Haikyuu, but those and the other sports.<br><br>Didn't you know that the purest basuke goes hunting for both crayfish and cicadas?</br></br></br>  <br>True love.</br>  Daily reminder that Akashi won the Kurokobowl and it's also the second best boy.   YFW THEY PLAYED CAN DO <br><br>MY HOPES AND DREAMS, THEY CAME TRUE</br></br>  <br>Yeah OK.</br>  <br> purest <br>You mean the sluttiest.</br></br>  <br>He's in a healthy and loving marriage. How is he a slut? He's no Yellow.</br>  post yfw /a/ was wrong<br><br> mfw everyone said cowboy bebop was entry level toonami shit <br> watch it <br> its the best anime I see </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Can we include the movie?</br></br>  So, might as well ask here.<br><br>1. What's the metaplot/pretext of CB? Like, with Spike getting killed once before by some chick, then getting killed again by her?<br><br>2. How would I figure this out from the show itself? That is, where did I miss it?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>1. How is it possible for one to<br>2. Be such a fucking summerfag</br></br></br>  <br>Friendly reminder to ignore /a/'s opinion on any critically acclaimed anime. That's not the say the majority of the board is wrong on these shows but watching for yourself is the only way.</br>  <br>Spike was in the syndicate with Vicious and fell in love with Julia, who was Vicious's woman. Spike wanted to run away with Julia, and left her a note after getting to know her so that they could run away together. Although Julia's true answer to spike's request is never known, vicious finds the note and forces Julia and gunpoint to refuse Spike's request, which she does by ripping the note up and throwing it through the window which Spike sees. Spike, in anger, betrays the Syndicate and is attacked by Vicious and the rest of the red dragon clan, this is where he loses his eye. He escapes, wounded, where Julia takes care of him, and then they all run away from the syndicate which was then after Spike for his treachery and Julia for assisting him. Vicious in particular feels betrayed by Spike since he thought Spike was a cold blooded, merciless warrior like himself, and now feels ostracized by Spike's change in behavior. Almost all of this can be deduced from the first story episode, The ballad of fallen angels, with the conversation between spike and vicious and the flask back sequence</br>  Previous thread Aereus said he probably do the Live translation of 2 chapters in a row, lets hope if that happens and he doesn't get drunk or go to the 24hrs store.    <br>Oh, I get it now...</br>  <br>Mayonegg</br>  <br>What the hell.</br>  <br>I don't get it</br>  Despair awaits you at   /ai/ idle activities     that terrible encoding on Pripara OST <br> not the DX version so we can have NCOPs <br><br>let me die</br></br></br>  Why did they sing "Hey little girl" at the wedding? Why did Akari and Sumire even do that song? Really, it should be a Kokone or Yuu song.  I have to hand it to you, these threads alway start neatly and continue to be pretty good until the end.  <br>Thanks! I think?</br>  <br>I'm still pissed it wasn't a Seira song. They brought her back, and then in the same episode stole her brand stage for a lackluster performance in outfits that didn't suit the song or stage. They at least could have used Yuu.</br>  Madoka is for _______      I like all megucas seriously  Is Moemura totally dead and nevermore after Rebellion?  <br>Yes</br>  So what is the overall /a/ opinion on Kekkai Sensen anyway?  <br>Durarara!! knock-off.<br>Characters are as generic as you can get.<br>Setting is as generic as you can get.<br>No substance at all.<br>Stylish.</br></br></br></br></br>  /v/ tier shit  <br> The threads have become awful though. <br>I agree. I usually just leave as soon as somebody starts dumping manga pages.<br><br>I think I wouldn't have been this disappointed with the show if I hadn't visited the threads, because almost every moment or arc from the manga was overhyped and then fell flat for me.</br></br></br></br>  When they are looking for a restaurant was a good episode, and i'm sure it was a filler  <br> So what is the overall /a/ opinion on Kekkai Sensen anyway? <br>20% of /a/ hate it<br>15% really love it<br>30% dont care</br></br></br></br></blockquote>]
