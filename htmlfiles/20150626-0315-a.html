[ Previews are out.             Now that I'm done posting those,  I want to kill that fucking cunt.               Daily reminder.   I really need some sleep, I forgot this one.    I want to kill this fucking cunt.   Thanks for your work, captain. See you on the other side.  Show's over, Yui won the 8manbowl.  And Yukinobowl, and the bet, and the Komachi, and the Gahamomma.     but is it alpha?   dropped at ep 6 or 7 at the boring school rep meeting with those from the other school.  did it stop being boring forced drama? I loved season 1.      Actually she didn't.   Finally, The Yahallo was protected. That ship which looks like sinking was actually just submerging.  Stay strong, brothers. It will end when it's end.    This only really occurred to me now, but Iroha's basically been feeling 8man out for a relationship for the last few volumes hasn't she?   Asks him if he's seeing anyone   Takes him on a "practice date"   Asks him if he's into younger girls   Senpai, do you dislike this sweetness? (not talking about the chocolate though) Also blatantly flirting with him   8man has reacted well in every single instance too, especially the last two.   It seems extremely likely that the last exchange was her final "check", and she's going to resolve to give up on Hayama and confess to 8man next volume.            christ where are this picture from    who is this semen demon    Read the LN.   WA2 averted  Threesome ending confirmed for TV  RIP other girls        Read the LN.  I read the kyoto chapters and found the translation to be horrible and not smooth at all.  I'd rather ruin my eyesight for some real literature.        Yukino and Yui in wedding dresses in the foreground   8man in standard uniform in the background   Yuri end confirmed.       Original with Yuckyno.   Good Irohasu, everyone!   That's what I think too, she'll show up next volume and Watari will closer her arc for good. Whether that's good or bad, depends on which ship you'll be on then and what happens.     Too bad that era of Sawachika Eri ended and it is going to end like Sakurasou    Yui's song for the next character album leaked  https://<span>youtu.be/Jmd4OLzhQw0  [ ]     Reminder   “Huh? W-What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, it won’t work out. There’s someone I like.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, you’re aiming too high. It’s creepy too and not possible.”   “Ha! Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, for an instant that made my heart skip a bit, but now that I think about it rationally, it really wouldn’t work out.”   “…Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, I do like them older, but it really wouldn’t work out.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me while I’m heartbroken? I’m sorry, it’s still not possible just yet.”   “Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a boyfriend just because we went out to have fun for a bit, I’m sorry, please do that only after we do this a few more times.”    “In any case, today turned out to be a good learning experience. Thank you very much.”   Isshiki lightly bowed, honestly expressing her appreciation. Taken aback by her earnest and mannerly behavior, I replied back awkwardly in a fluster. Isshiki lifted her face and laughed in amusement.   “…Senpai, make sure to keep today in mind, okay?”    I was interrupted by Isshiki’s sliding movement towards my side.   “That’s why, for now…”   Isshiki stopped her words there and moved her lips to my ears as if to say something secretly with deceiving eyes at the end.   She added some spice smeared with sugar.   “You’re the only one that I’ll act this way with, senpai.”   These were flirtings.                      nnnnnnice   uhhhhhhhh   Will the LNs end like Sakura-sou LN and 8man fucks Yukino   RIP Yukinofags. Yui is has won it all.   Doesn't matter    Yeah yuckydrama mainly fucked off for now. Although pieces of it still remain. The rest of this drama shit will be in the last volumes, not last 2 episodes, I think.    no Iroha   DROPPED    hahahaha no fucking irohaslut in today's episode    lol  only part that could be similar is if HachixYuki happens and they split, only to reunite years later       At least in True Tears main autistic girl didn't win.   What was this I heard about 8man VA and the author?    Fuck off with your false flag shit.  Yui a best, so her BFF a best too. If Yukino has lost the 8bowl we need to be there for her fags just like Yui will be there for her.        In the last novel Iroha will confess her love to 8man in tears of joy and relief.  8man will turn to her, his eyes locked with hers, mere inches from her lips, and whisper   “Huh? W-What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, it won’t work out. There’s someone I like.”         CIVIL WAR yumiko vs saki then yuki vs yui      Fuck you, fuck off and die     forced drama   I loved Season 1  You won't enjoy season 2 then. Hachiman actually tries to face the fact, he isn't happy with his life.     Haruno's plan is coming together perfectly. Can anyone stop her?    Yukino is part of Yui's harem.  She wants it all.        yuckyshit sucking up to Yuibros who they shat at previously  Fuck off.     Eiguchi is actually Watari's kouhai, and Watari   walked him home gently    All in one.   If this happens I will go to Watari's house and literally suck his dick     yui at the end  yui end confirmed     Only 8man can. She's pretty much a person with the same views as S1 8man, but that went down the wrong path somewhere. Instead of changing people, she manipulates them.    Best girl.   dem tits      True BFF  Be vigilance, because the spam and false flags will be intense for the next 40 hours.      That's what the Noefags thought too.    Holy shit this would be incredible.     hiki.badass      that komachi salute  Komachi REALLY needs to meet Iroha.     Pretty much guess what happened...Goodbye Yui bros; It was a fun ride.      Doubtful. Not only did 8man not object to further dates with Iroha at the end of 10.5, he practically said he likes her in 11.  Iroha has a very strong backing from 10/10.5/11 alone, let alone all their prior development.      This shit writes itself      saamefagging so hard      I'm the one who posted the reminder and I admit if WW does this he's the alphaest of the alpha writer       Mah nigga        Even after 100 years Noefags still mad.     This is the end of vol 11 right?    Or Yukimurafags Haganai volume 11 released on 25th August. And people thought Yukimura won...      Yeah, this is the end of it all.    Not as alpha as if he has 8man fake-confess to Yui and then pretend it never happened the next day to get her to stop bugging him.    "I want something "genuine"   I'll help you find that something "genuine"   Is what I want really "Genuine"?   I wonder if "genuine" things really exist.   Since ancient times, every civilization's ruler has had the same idea. When people unite under one will, they become stronger than the sum of their parts. And what do rulers use to bring people together? Language.    "Genuine"    Haruno is actually mental projection of Hachiman's worst ideals come to life, that he can see and interact with              I can imagine in the future, 8man at his wage slave job, having foolishly tossed aside his chances at love in highschool for muh friendship, gets the news he'll be getting a new manager, and in comes Yumiko.  After a hard day of getting grilled and having an unusual amount of attention to every detail of his work inspected by his boss, he goes to the local bar dive owned by Saki, and drinks his worries away.       Really?   Haruno needs to get fucking laid. Bitch just needs some dick.    &gt;And people thought Yukimura won...  You mean they weren't just shitposting?     That's just to make it more painful. Too many sudden attention means nothing good.   Now it's Yuifags turn to be delusional, I see.    Haruno is actually mental projection of Hachiman's worst ideals come to life, that he can see and interact with   Sasuga best onee-san      Isn't that epilogue       If Iroha wins somehow I expect this to happen, and 8man to slowly throw all the variations of this she's done to him, as she continues her hunt.     Contradicting your own writing doesn't make things more painful, it just makes it stupid.    It really seems like Rika should win. They're actually friends    Hiromifag reporting.     No need to have some stupid arguing within the legion. It's painful enough that she won't show up today.    Or death    It's the last fucking episode.  Why don't you go all out in a blast of fun for once?        my waifu lost and I pretended other girls never had any flags, author is a hack!    Do you think Yuidad is ready to kick 8man's ass since Yui talks about him so much?     I love Rika with all my heart!   gets kissed by reversetrap slut   Rika who?        But why just get fucked if you can NTR your sister in the process without her even realising it is NTR?     implying Iroha wont jump in and kiss him like crazy after that.     Because it will bite you in the ass later. Besides it's clear that Yukino will win.     If her mother is any indication to how Yui will turn out, he better before she gets TEEN PREGNANT.     Who are you quoting?    They'll be mad for 10,000 years at least    That or wants to convince him to take over the family business.     Besides it's clear that Yukino will win.   That's the spirit!  Yukino can enjoy her win every night  in Yui's bedroom handcuffed to the bed rail, while she watches 8man, and Yui's dog spitroast Yui         You are a sick person    Yui talks about Hikki to her mother all the time  I wonder what Yui says. Do you think Gahamama knows that Yui really wants the 8? How long do you think she has been doing it?    Nah, Yui needs someone to sit on her face while 8man fills her with fish-eyed children     Don't worry Yukino will get double-no, triple the love!    Yuimom    fucking cuck is 8man if he goes for iroha. i prefer yui right now.      How long do you think she has been doing it?  Since they meet  I think Yui might talk about him even before canon start, but only start speaking openly after she knows him better.       8man copying the "making passes" schtick would be a pretty good setup for a kiss interruption.     Probably since he saved her dog.      I have no preference between these two fucks, but goddamn that art is cute.    So, cookie man confirmed 8man then?  Is there a love triangle currently? 76% don't think so  http://strawpoll.me/4731955      bright red face   "are you making passes at me? I'm sorry that's.."   kiss  I didn't know I wanted this so much       Noticed how she talk to Yukinon after they had exchange in class? Yes, something like that.    Well fuck you, not again.     Genuine thing   I don't get it, what could she mean?      I don't know man. It kinda hard to predicting how Yukino end will be without feel it like asspull ending right now.  especially she is kinda lagged in romance development compared Yui and Iroha.  Any thought how Yukino will 8man bowl without felt it as asspull at ending?        At least you're more honest about your statistics than the US govt.     I know she probably mentioned it him but when did it become obvious to Mama that this is the boy Yui likes? Was she exited to see Hikki-kun or Yukino-chan?       Take your shit taste and meme back to /v/.    You're easily among the most pessimist irohabros out there.   Since Haganai been brought into discussion, obligatory.   * will win    Promise exchange + Time skip    TOTSUKA END CONFIRMED    Still fucking  based     I don't have that image saved, but "two people who become comrades because of their similarities fall in love because of their differences"  Iroha is the closest ending to an asspull right now.       that way of suddenly kissing  Sounds awfully like a certain sly character in this show.     Yukino's problem isn't just that she's lacking romance, she's downright emotionally incomplete.  Romance is simply not a feasible possibility when her broken personality is a major ongoing plot point, the series would need to go on a while longer for her to have any real chance.       I'm preparing to the worst but hoping for the best. It's just an ambush, Iroha laid foundation for certain strike in v12.       secondary detected     3 hrs left before live watch   What happened?     Hikki-kun  Oh man that is adorable, thinking of Yui talking about Hikki all the time to her family with mom smiling and dad preparing his golf club.  I wonder if she lets on that she is in love with him.      By 8man rejecting Yui first after Watari spend almost all Yui character development for improving her relationship with 8man?  I don't think Watari can pull it out without feel inorganic?     ETA ?   Timeskip/wait for me ending is what will happen for YukinoxHachi. Im seeing too many signs for it to occur. Actually thing that is what is going to happen regardless of whether she wins in the end or not (her leaving for a while)  Anyways, oregairu is more or less Yukino's story from here on out (well it has been for a while since she's pretty much the sole vehicle for adding plot to the story)  Yuki's interesting in that she's probably the only main character that Watari actually puts through highs and lows in terms of char developement. All of Hachiman's growth has been mostly positive since the series began, Yui's has been mostly unchanged but she honestly just fine as a character from the beginning of the series (hence why she can bridge the other two when need be)  With Yukino, she had good development up to Vol 6 when she stood up to Haruno at culture fest, Vol 7-9 Watari made her character ultra drama fueled and 10/11 we got the dependency/identity issues.   I just want a good end for Yukino              Yui and Yukino in bed   Wait, is 8man also in the room? He should be right? Since the story is in his perspective.        The protagonist ended up with someone he's already been on a date and actually had fun with? What an asspull.   Burgerland must be waking up.      We're all preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. Doesn't mean we should behave like we're inside davy jone's locker already.      Nah.  Yukino already has found her answer. Just look at her at the end of the culture festival. She's not emotionally broken. She just needs to rediscover herself.  It's not going to take years of time, just the right words and the right moment.          Any thought how Yukino will 8man bowl without felt it as asspull at ending?  Just like Rikka and Mashiro     where did the snow come from?  There was no snow last episodes.      Forced date that he can't be arsed to take seriously    Yukino is so cold that she's freezing the place in an attempt to kill people.       Iroha confesses with YY looking   8man answers "I'm sorry, I have someone I like, she's Y..."   Iroha steals a kiss   "Go out with me senpai"   "Ah, um, okay"   Cold stare from the YY            Yet he actually had fun with it, unlike the forced dates he had with the other heroines.    Here it is.    The thing is, both girls love 8man, and if he loves Yukino enough to want to wait, that's game over, and I think Yui will respect that.  I still think Yui end makes for the better narrative, but Yukino end can still work out well enough.      That's why I said "time skip". After all bags feeling and aftermath been subsided. And we're talking hypothetical situation here.  I'm fully aware that Yui only has her romance subplot going and shafted it after 12 vol (not counting *.5) will really makes WW a big-ass hypocritical asshole.     Gahamama going yandere after 8man refuse her daughter    Nandatte?    She already acknowledged she had a problem and it seems like she has an idea what to do. That aquarium scene is big.  Do you think there will be war?       stolen from right before their eyes   That would be some next level cruelty      holy shit that's really deep      Don't samefag, that's just fucking sad.    He doesn't have any forced date outside Iroha.   That's the point, they all just go out with a clear goal (buying present) without pretense. Iroha has to use Hayama card for everything.      I wasn't.   I honestly don't care who wins as long as it is Iroha or  Yukinon    The one where she talks about finding a home when looking at fish? Anyone got the TL for that scene?    Just like he had fun with komachi    You think that if Yukino wins there will be bad blood all around from the losers? I think Yui could handle a loss and not take it poorly.   And then Iroha finds herself at the bottom of a river or in a sleazy hotel getting raped by a wild pack of niggers. Yukino has a mean jealous streak and Yui is halfway to yandere.        Iroha has to use Hayama card for everything.  Are you even reading the novels? She used the 'work' excuse to get him to go.   He doesn't have any forced date outside Iroha.   Right, going with Komachi just to have her dump them in there without their consent is totally not forced. Not to mention that people showed up and stopped those 'dates'.  Burgerland really is awaken.           Does anyone have a link for the streaming? It's been ages since the last time I watched a live stream   Oh that's funny   It's funny because she fucks like a dead fish.    Seems legit.    Prime example of a Yuifag. Unnecessary cruelness to other girls because they aren't his favorite.      Yurpoor = Irohafag  Everything makes sense now. Especially the allahu ackbar bit.    Will we ever get a better arc than WW3?  This isn't over yet?  Not a complete arc, but NT9 as stand alone book is better written.   Why would it be? 35 volumes strong.    Too bad it's follow up conclusion novel was trash.     NT9 is just a part of an arc though.  Overall WWIII wins because they had more pov from the other protags like Accel and Shiage.  Gremlin Arc isn't that good, Touma doesn't shines and the antagonists aren't appealing except for 2 besides Othinus (Thor and Bersi) but one is dead and the other fulfilled his role and left.         Not an arc though, and NT10 was a total mess in terms of pacing and execution. Whoever Kamachi has as editor, he/she sucks and needs to be replaced.   Za Edge.    Miki-san   being replace  You'd have an easier time replacing Haimura.       posting lightnovel shit on the anime/manga board  fuck off back to /jp/ faggot    Best girl.  Is there anywhere to read the older novels? Baka-Tsuki took them down.    needs to be replaced.   Replacing Miki-san means no more Misaka, and no more sales.      Just   Who /oniichan/ here.   Indeed. I hope we get a sequel to NT11 later on from Misaki's POV again. Also hype for Misaka/Misaki Christmas escapades soon.     Second* best girl       I wish Dengeki let Mahaya be this lewd in his novel illustrations.     Mikoto   making a move instead of cockblocking            dat best girl figure   It sucks being a poorfag ;_;        Looks really rough, and the paint-job is obviously a work in process but it's nice. This is incomplete, right? Or is it just worn?    Misaki is one of the most popular Raildex girls, right? So why is there only one or two official figures for her?  is someone going to dump the new accel?   One was personally requested by Kamachi.    Is that white Shuuzou?      It also looks horrendous. I wasn't aware that there were more, please tell me it's her in the normal Tokiwadai uniform.             Purple is my way of life.   Reminder novel was shit and essentially wrote her out of the story. Also it served no purpose in the overall plot, except the part about Noukan which was irrelevant to Misaki. Just a reminder.          I laughed.         Why can't this happen? ;_;    I'm honestly afraid to read these things because I fear my Misaki will get hurt or killed.  I know I'm selling her short, and that she can easily hold her own, but still, I worry.         You must be new here.      Because she is shit and so us your taste.  Touma's never going to have a romantic relationship with any girl. Ever. Get over it.     I miss edgy Accel.    she can easily hold her own  You kidding? One punch to her tummy and she's on the floor Literally the only Level 5 who would be helpless when facing a rabid dog         implying Itsuwa won't become his wife      she is shit   She is the best fucking female character in the series.          Yeah she's shit but to be fair you'd be hard pressed to punch her. You'd have to be able to avoid her Mental Out     She is the best fucking female character in the series  Okay not that guy but it's one thing to like Othinus and another to say she's the best in the series           Speaking strictly about character, yeah she is.     opinions   Even if your opinion is fact it won't get her a romantic relationship with Touma. No girl will.      Itsuwa will.         You were supposed to reassure me she'll be fine, not make it worse. Oh god.        NT13 WHEN FUCKING WHEN?   Man why is this so bad? What happened, Kamachi?          You're breaking my heart.       2 weeks.    Some Zashiki Warashi illustrations are like that though?    10th july     So why does it take a month to scanlate Accel? Is it because of the spreads?   Fucking headcrab cockblocker.      no it is because they only got the raws last week    Its hard to write a story about accel, we got our wishes of accel being a main mc, but then you will realized that accel is only good when he suddenly appears to rekt shit up and to warn that things are going the fuck down.    God damn that's some pretty shitty shipping service.        Didnt Touma like lectured index when she tried interferrig itsuwa from cooking and sht?    Yeah.    Mikoto did it first.   Build up anon, it's just the first arc.  Animee when?           Why she don't just transfer memories and knowledge from some martial artist to herself?      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Vjb<wbr>WYXGkMZk</wbr>  [ ]       Index immediately lost to her hungry stomach and started to bother Itsuwa, who was cooking. Seeing Index like this, Kamijou Touma got up, and then got into a dashing position before getting over to Index, grabbing her waist with both hands before pulling her out of the kitchen. After that, without knowing where he had learned it from, he habitually used a professional judo throw to toss Index onto the bed, shouting as he threw her onto the bed,    “STOP DESTROYING A MAN’S DREAAAAAMMMMMM!!!!”    “WAAH! Tou, Touma, what’s going on!?”    Due to shock, Index’s eyes continued to twirl in confusion. Hearing her shout, the calico cat put in some distance in irritation.    Kamijou didn’t make a reply, and wordlessly grabbed Index’s head with one hand, turning it towards the kitchen.    “LOOK, INDEX!! THIS SHOULD BE HOW YOU BEHAVE WHEN YOU LIVE IN SOMEONE ELSE’S HOUSE!!”    “OWOWOWOWOW!? Why is Touma acting so weird today!?”    “If I’m to calm down and think, why is it always you who’s over there eating and sleeping, and then watching the television!? FROM TODAY ONWARDS, YOU’RE GOING TO WORK! HURRY UP, GET A SPONGE AND CLEANING DETERGENT, AND CLEAN UP THE BATHROOM!!!”    “Eh, but it’s about time for Magical-Powered Kanamin Integral to start, right?”    “Good, HURRY UP AND GET TO WOOOOOOOOOOOOOORK!!!”                         Knowledge must synchronize with the body. If you had a skinny person learn a fat person's martial arts knowledge, there's still a disconnect.    fucking kaworu    she would still be out of shape and weak    because an earbud is probably as big as her head    He really is a 1st rate VA now. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Zd6<wbr>96BPQzgU</wbr>  [ ]     Ever heard of taichi? And she could just program herself to do some exercisers?    Accel16_0038.png<br/>   when will accelerator finally wipe out all the normies?   Never. If you knew anything about him you'd know this.   What was that sad Index song people were listening to when NT9 and Touma's It Bothers Me rant came out?  No one gives a shit about the Accel manga.  Any chance at all of decent NT13 threads? Or is that not possible?   Damn whats that track playing there?    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ESK<wbr>ga2SMlss</wbr>  [ ]    No one cares about your opinion    The only way for them to be decent is if Kamachi drops the shipping bullshit and has Mikoto fight like in NT6.  Shitstorms always happen due to shipping shit.       implying that wouldn't also cause some shitstorm     NT6 didn't have any major shitstorms. The threads were quite decent even when the Mikoto parts were translated.    Even then they could say "how dare this weak and irrelevant bitch do something useful she's so weak that's an asspull"    thanks    I usually avoid threads until the volume gets fully translated, I'm missing something out? I guess NT9 had great threads, I guess.   Is NT13 on Amazon yet?   Not yet.    Yeah i want to know too. It bothers me that i dont know song it is    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=y1_<wbr>j-NZ1kac</wbr>  [ ]    No its shitstorm gurranteed  If misaka did confess and ges rejected? Shitstorm ensues  If misaka confessed and gets accepted? Shitstorm ensues   Touma and Misaka winning against a magic god? Shitstorm ensues No escape from the storm              I could honestly see them both dying, Aleister getting what he needs from Touma's corpse, and then keikaku doori with IB, Accelerator and the Will. But I know this will get shouted down    PLOT ARMOR is going to keep Touma alive till the bitter end.   Actually could they just get on with fighting Aleister, his keikaku doori can only go so far before I start to get disinterested. Isn't he like trying to make heaven on earth or something?      Well it'd be the end of the series in that case     Touma   dying  His gonna be kept alive to suffer and suffer.      Told you my post would get shouted down even though it makes sense    Even if he do die Aleister is gonna put him in one those tubes used to let kakine live.    A C R O B I K E C R O  B I K E           I'm ready for Touma to BTFO of Mikoto.    Bang the fuck out of Mikoto? That would be great.    No, b ite  the fuck out of Mikoto. Someone has to pay for all the Index abuse after all.    First time reading the Accelerator manga  Damnit Last Order, you're way too hnnnng in this.    Thankyou anon.    My sides.   Raildex so ded   No volume yet No anime  Railgun manga is currently not worth reading Accel manga finally got its mc to appear  So this is to expected         Don't worry, the shitposting during NT13 will be unimaginable.    how the fuck the VA make that sound    He sounds like a dying frog. Always makes me want to laugh my head off.    What if "Misaki" isn't actually the real Misaki? What if she's just a flesh doll the real Misaki uses to interact with the world?      every almost death by each character was really the character dying and having a new body generated by the New Testament machine making a new body with the help of the Heaven Canceller's skill  I watch far too much Doctor Who for my own good.     That's kinda dumb. At least the Misaki thing makes sense.  And Touma did die once already and it took a lot more to bring him back.      Othinus a shit  Accel a best   Why isn't accel just killing these scrubs already?   Because he'd end the manga in two pages. And that, folks, is why you never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever invent a character so OP equipped with storybreaker powers to be your main character.   Not in fanfic.

When the hell does it get good?     volume 16-17    Can I just skip to that without missing anything important? Not that there's anything important, the story for the first volume was incredibly bland and generic.   http://mangakansou.com/【ネタバレ】暗さつ教室%<wbr>e3%80%80145%e3%80%80感想【注意】/</wbr>    What the fuck is going on  Lastly  bump  Let's keep discussing the theory revolving around Rebecca's tears falling on Luffy's sleeping face.  Rebecca is best for baby making.   Is there any legendary creature that can force people to tell the truth?    Violet can just read people's minds although it's different from forcing them to tell the truth.    It's not perfect either if they're an idiot like Sanji.    I meant is there any mythical zoan Kaidou or his crew could possess that they could use to interrogate prisoners.   I don't think wukong had that power but maybe the sphinx could do it?      Doesn't Sanji makes it even better since he's honest with himself?    No, his mind is full of only one thing that you can't read anything else, that was the point.    Vivi was able to hypnotize people even if her power was really weak, so yeah, there could be one. What kind of information Kaidou could need, though?    Does truth serum exist in One Piece?    Information is hugely valuable to pirates in the new world. You would always want to know what the other yonkou are up to as well as the navy.   You can do it the old fashion way with plants like Vergo and doffy but that is fairly risky and the information will be filtered/slow   Or you can interrogate people you capture. Torture gives you unreliable information so I would assume most of them have something like Viola's powers to gather information on what other crews are up to. Kaidou seems to be almost entirely Zoan based to the point he wanted 500 pseudo versions. I am assuming all of his top crew members have mythical versions with varying powers similar to buddha/phoenix  I am trying to figure out what possible mythical zoan could be used for intelligence gathering          I really can not understand the hate on her.    Was hyped as an "undefeated woman" and said she wanted to help Soldier, ended up being a crybaby who needed to be saved three times.     undefeated woman  In the Coliseum she was, because of her CoO     I don't, either.   What the fuck is wrong with you people? Do you really hate a character that much that you'll go to that measure to ruin a thread? Forbid that every character isn't a damn powerhouse, or some fighting genius. I'd go as far as to say Chopper showed that same 'uselessness'. While I'm at it, Nami and Usopp, too. At least Rebecca didn't run away from her fight in the coliseum. She ran from Diamante, granted but wouldn't you stiffen up from knowing your mother's killer on the spot?  Seriously, calm the fuck down.        Rebecca's only accomplishment is delivering a key to Luffy, which could've been done by anyone else. Each one of Straw Hats has a specific set of skills, and you'd have to be insane to put them on Rebecca's level.    tfw they will make this chapter last an entire episode    why do you still watching the anime?    Cause they can make scenes so delicious     specific set of skills  See, what does this mean? Having skills means jackshit when it comes to Luffy. He wanted Brook on his crew for being a skeleton. He didn't know he played music or knew Laboon. When will you people realize that Luffy doesn't care about that type of shit and will ask anyone he likes to join his crew? Granted, it's played off as a gag sometimes, but the last thing on his mind is what role X will play on the ship. We got the shipwright, at this point anyone else is because Luffy likes them.  And I'm pretty sure Luffy likes Rebecca, simply because she fed him. Remember what series you're reading, kid.       I used to, but I dropped it for this reason.    How many episodes OP has so far? I stopped to watch the anime in the 15º episode.     698 episodes.    almost all of the budget for that scene     Robin is the archaeologist   Luffy wasnt even aware of that when he accepted her   Chopper was the emergency food supply   Usopp is the liar           Luffy may not have been aware of what they can do, but we, readers, are. We can guess who will join the crew based on what Oda shows us. He showed us nothing that could make Rebecca a viable candidate for becoming the next Straw Hat. Suck it, Rebeccafags.     new chapter   it's fucking nothing!   I guess they need a conclusion chapter but damn those feel so wasted.       She won't be looking like that once this is all over     She will be god looking in average costume too.     Yeah, those armor pieces will be off and we only see Luffy's back.    When will Luffy return to Windmill village and give his hat to Makino's son?    luffy boning rebecca    not boning hamcock       Robin is the archaeologist  wut      Really it was just bad luck aka a bunch of asspulls. What are the chances of all this shit (a dwarf rebellion, Kyros + all the other toys returning to normal, Sabo coming, etc) happening in the course of a day?  You forget, the reason any of this shit is going down if because of the "Doffy isn't a Shichibukai" fake out. Had that not happened, the Tontatas and Kyros wouldn't have risen up.  Sabo was pretty out of nowhere though. He really fucked everything up   That is her job title on the ship         So what's going to happen with Law from now on? Will he stick around?  Watching Kyros' flashback and then reading this chapter is absolutely killed me.   With these tin arms I can't even feel your warmth as you die   With these tin eyes, I can't even shed tears for you   LIKE POTTERY       What's the first thing that comes through your mind?   that one anime where the MC was in fifth grade but looked like a 20 year old dude.   Calling the FBI now.   Ghost cunny.    I think they're used too much. I mean, you don't need that prop to show they're e--ary students, that should be obvious from how they already look   Puffy vulvas   Quzilax    [x]Smooch loli tummy    Those look really uncomfortable.  Who the fuck makes a backpack out of non-breatheable material?  3DP VC         i'm thinking there's this one company that produces all the randosels in Japan, and they got some lobby/bribery scheme with all the schools to keep it that way.    How the hell every Japanese family can afford one? They're like five hundred dollars each.    They don't have to replace them and japanese families usually have 1 or 2 kids    Tradition   It's cheaper in Japan. Also it's strong. They can use it until they finish Elementary/Grade school.       These backpacks look so comfortable to wear.    rape   That thing is erotic as fuck, I would buy one if I had a little girl around here.   Raep.    Why is that backpack 3dpd?   This is pretty likely.       This. My first thought was. Expensive Bags.      It's cheaper in Japan   No: http://ranking.rakuten.co.jp/daily/<wbr>301055/</wbr>       Oh, it's backpack sized. I thought it was a belt-pouch or something.  This thread makes more sense now.      Holy shit, no wonder nips don't want to reproduce. That's insanely expensive.    loli porn    We had ransel back in elementary school, but they were all brown and wider.  Fuck ussr female school uniform, it sucked.     Please translate I cannot read moonrunes. I can see a varying prices ranging from 1000+ yen to 54000+ yen. Tell me that the 54000 are the posh ones while the 1000 ones are the common plebian bags.     nice blog, post pics    Symphogeah is so popular yet its subs are never consistent. Truly suffering.  Remember that bullshit with commie not subbing the final episode until month+ later   A little boy wearing nothing but white socks and ransel, waiting on a desk  Excitement!!   It's high quality backpack and can last through your entire grade school session(which is like 6 years), I wouldn't say it's expensive at all.    The question now is "how strong is it?"  I imagine that unless you got run over by a Japanese truck, that bag should last forever.      The word 'randosel'.  Does anyone else actually visualize the spelling of the word first, or do they jump straight to associated images?     St. Margareta.   Yep. Made out of 200 components fabricated using Japanese technology. I've watched some parts of a show about how it's made (The Mark of Beauty on NHK World) and it shows how autistic Japan goes when it comes to aesthetics and detail.   Honestly, I started thinking about how nice it would be if I could have someone like Lili from DanMachi in Diablo 3.   And then I thought a little bit about how that role wouldn't work for a character in an MMO because no way in hell would anyone let someone else pick up all the loot. It just makes no sense in game design but it does make a bit of sense in the context of the story.  Sorry, I gave more than the first thing.      I am going to jail and it's going to fucking suck and not even be mildly pleasant   I didn't even know the word. And also, no.     Very Loli.   I keep hearing that it's sturdy and will last until the kid is in middle school (when they stop using them), but even the cheap ones seem to be around 220 USD. For six years, that's around 36 a year, that's way more than replacing the backpack when needed  Am I just dumb or are these that much cheaper in Japan?    Worst fucking prop. I want my rape victims to be intelligent enough to fully process what's happening to them. Elementary schoolers don't cut it.    that one anime where the MC was in fifth grade but looked like a 20 year old dude   Cardcaptor Sakura?      Apples.      You did not just talk about Sakura like that.    Pretty sure it's Yoiko Funny anime. Like SYD but good     Tiny, undersized backpacks.    Recorder to Randoseru     Amatuers     I'd stick it in her fanny pack.    swimsuits and thigh-highs    Cash.    Looks like a mailbox    You can get a $40 Jansport backpack that lasts 6 years. This sounds more like a way to show off to the other parents.    its even in the name    kawaii as fuck http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ui_a<wbr>7ahBaDU</wbr>  [ ]    Why do my kids keep leaving their backpacks in my room?    That I want one, solely for the fact that they're so commonly used and so expensive. They must be really amazing somehow. But I won't get one because I'm not a little kid and don't like using backpacks.      "I wonder if Jlist still sells those"is my thought.    This photo of Aoi with a red backpack that resembles a randoseru.   This      Kyon-kun Denwa       That's been made impossible by the number of adults who look and sound like e--ary students running around. We need extra confirmation.     e--ary  What is e--ary?     小○生   <br/>    uncut  My sides      hop on faggot, we're going to the playground     Would I get bullied if I went to school with an Eastpak as a loli in Japan ?       using durable gear  It's like you don't even want to shopping with your loli friends!     Here, take this: 〇    You can get them for a lot cheaper than that. I can look up school uniforms, etc. as sold to Americans online and the prices would be a lot higher than what people actually spend.   Now factor in this: most Japanese schoolkids don't drive cars. In America it is common for highschool shits to have a car. Also factor in the difference in annual food costs between western kids and Japanese kids. They spent thousands of dollars more on junk food for the family than the average Japanese family spends.   http://ランドセル人気.jp.net/kakaku.html 5th most popular is in the $160~$200 bracket. Now how much is a laptop? A cheap car? Brand clothing? An average school backpack will be used for average about a year, and will run between $25~$100 bucks. Compared to the randoseru which lasts for around six years of daily usage western backpacks are starting to look even more expensive. The randoseru is also given to kids as a special thing for entering school and not treated like an everyday throw away object.    Instead of making kotaku grade out of context comparisons be a little honest next time.           Cute girls that needs protecting.   I hope to one day save up my cum in bottles and then get one of those bags. I'll wataproof the inside of it, and empty the contents of my multiple bottles into it. Then I'll try to walk around town with a vibrating bullet in my trying as hard to not to spill my cum filled bag.      But that's a zero.   Little girls   Wow, the're pricey on eBay..$150 is for the genuine line. If I had a kid I will buy one for her... yes her.     〇 zero ○ maru ◯ big maru      Are they allowed to use other type of school bag? Or the school regulationim impose them to use randoseru?  生意気な子供は早々にランドセル使わなくなるんだよね     Todcon    The TV series even comes with a red backpack DVD case.    You're going to call the FBI because of a picture of backpacks?    Fun Fact: Japanese school backpacks are actually based on Japanese Army backpacks back in WW2. In a funny way, could be a symbol of "indoctrination or nationalism" if you want to call it that.    They are comfy indeed   I got mine for 4000jpy (+shipping and proxy)  I'm a girl and I'm fairly small so I can get away with wearing it; people don't know it's an elementary school bag unless I let them know        nyanpasu    In a funny way, could be a symbol of "indoctrination or nationalism"  You mean like how they also adopted western attire as worn by the British and Dutch?   In a funny way, it could be said you are a fucking idiot.       L O N D O N O N D O N         wot    randosero  Because that's what it is. Closely followed by "lolis".     Shingeki no kyojin thread.

They can't even enter a dungeon, and even when they do they can't use their powers. It would be hard to make having a God MC enjoyable in this series. However, I'd love for a spin off of an up and coming God building a familia/Harem and just hanging out with other gods and getting into SoL shenanigans while his cute familia risks their lives to support his dumb ass.       http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/event<wbr>s/boob-ribbon  Within the first 3 weeks, Hestia fanart on the Japanese image sharing website Pixiv increased to more than 1,000.[1] According to Pixiv’s daily view tracker (shown below), the views peaked on April 9th, 2015, with 722,886 views. In that same period, on the online image boards Danbooru[2] and Gelbooru,[3] Hestia’s tag had surpassed 1,300 images, making up the largest quantity of the fanart for the show which contained 1,400 images  what do you expect?    </wbr>     linking that website  This will not turn out well for you.

Not garbage, but worse than this    Just like all other studios. Your point?    brown is best taste    Don't get me wrong. Hephaestus is fine too, but Hesita just has more to offer. She is the goddess of fertility you know.    Anyone got a clean stitch of that?     Hephaestus is fine too   No she isn't.

How about Curry and Megumi instead. She's his type.    They don't have a history together, unlike mad dog has with Megumi. Their polarizing characters could mesh well there.

Implying its not done on purpose   Implying Mad dog doesn't break her like a lobster when he finally snaps    Implying this doesn't happen   DOUJINS FUCKING WHEN?!        Tosh has to do it. He's the only one capable of drawing out such a scenario. I'm not surprised if he has a stash of SnS porn, waiting to be released, once his contract with Jump's up.   This is so fucking retarded, but why did I watch everything and catch up with the manga?   Their babies would look magnificent, think about it. A win-win for both.    It's okay because she looks like a loli.    Curry wouldn't be happy once she reaches menopause.    How did this pairing even happen?   Do you think Alice is gonna flirt with curry in front of mad dog to make him jealous? I really want to see this happen.   That's what I am wondering about, too. Isami has had little to no contact with her, &amp; yet there's fanart of them, coming out from nowhere.    but curry is into his stepmother.    Ryou doesn't really care about romance. So I don't think it'll matter to him, at all. Whereas for Curry, he wouldn't be so easily swayed by her; guy's as faithful to Jun as a doting husbando.    Since fujos like SoumaxTakumi, they pair Isami and Megumi as well.    Megumi is Souma's support. Isami is Takumi's support. SoumaxTakumi-&gt;IsamixMegumi      Ryou couldn't care less, Alice would just look like a retarded slut. Trying to make someone not interested in romance be jealous.       Ryou   Giving a fuck that is not alice        we don't really know how Ryou feels about Alice, he was all "for milady" in tournament, but it's more like he's proud of both their skills and doesn't see her romantically. It will happen though, I have no doubt about it.      I want to pair Takumi with  Fumio　　　    Nope. Ryou has a fetish for 'weaklings' like MehGoomy.   Yuuki probably has a larger chest than Megumi. I only know she notices Ryouko obviously outclassing her though.  So he attacks mainland China food with Taiwan food? Nice.   Takumi &amp; Isami open a stall with friends in the street district   Takumi &amp; Isami    having friends  fake spoilers confirmed       super chinese restaurant vs cart   China vs Taiwan  It's perfect.      Takumi is an autist, but Isami is pretty sociable guy.   Quit spamming already. This isn't the waifu thread, and posts like it get contained for a reason. It's roll crap too.  What should I make for lunch?  Nothing too hard please, I'm a beginner     They are probably Isami's friends.    Wonder what sort of spin he'll add to it?     Mapo Doufu    did chuuka ever cover modified styles outside of china?   Raku?!    They're high school freshmen, plenty of time still to make memories together.   Thanks, janitor/mod-kun.  Anyway, how long until we have canon confirmation of Ryou/Alice? There's no way they aren't already fucking like rabbits.     No, Yugi    Is Kuga the penultimate Yugi lookalike?     A scene with Tsukasa, Momo, Rindou,Kuga   Singing the school song (Soma is surprised everyone can sing the school song)   Kuga has made some sort of promise with Tsukasa   Tell me more. It's getting interesting for the 2nd graders to interact with the 3rd graders, as we never seen it in the E10 intro.       So from all the dishes they made in the anime which one is the easiest to do in real life?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127157071   xD    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127157071  I meant chicken breast*   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127157071   xD  Where do you come from? Leddit? Tumblr?    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127157071   xD  Fuck off faggot.     Takumi's only an autist around Souma. He's pretty cool otherwise.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127157130  It's obviously a preview and not a scan. Sucks for you, Ryou.   I know Hong Kong sort of has a presence for different dishes, never really saw Taiwan. Don't really know how much each location considers themselves as being away from China. IIRC HK may pretty much be China though.   Hong Kong is officially part of China since 1997. As for Taiwan, it depends on how you view it, people can argue it all day long.     I made the steak with onions, shit is easy to do, though I didn't follow the recipe for the fried onions and sauce because I didn't understood how to make it, and how much wine to put and I didn't have soy sauce. Still it was pretty cool.    Takumi doesn't interact with other characters much, but he was pretty awkward around Hinako too.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127157264  You can't use emoticons on /a/, except ;_;    It's how the people think though. For example even Chinese hate how language should be used. There are "HK" dishes but I don't know if they should be part of the "Chinese whole", even if HK people don't want to be a part of China. Too much potential drama to be understood I guess, so I'll stop giving a fuck.     -Isami is supporting Megumi's shoulder  Tsukuda preparing Megumi's rebound for after eventually not winning Somabowl?    Ha, talking about going on a roll    This:   I found most of them in Souma/Takumi imagedumps.       Did he interact with Hinako without Souma present at one point?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127157351   I miss old /a/.      &gt;manga is giving some Isami/Megumi.   &gt;drama cd is pushing Takumi/Megumi.   W-what should I do? Should I just follow my heart?  I see. Someone figuratively needs to die!       I loved how so casually and without realizing they friendzoned the sluts.    Why do random girls call Aldinis by their first names? Isn't it a big deal in Japan?    I think they make an exception for twins.     It's how the people think though. For example even Chinese hate how language should be used. There are "HK" dishes but I don't know if they should be part of the "Chinese whole", even if HK people don't want to be a part of China. Too much potential drama to be understood I guess, so I'll stop giving a fuck.   Well Hong Kong and Macau (&amp; perhaps others) are basically States whose Rights to Statehood were taken away by sheer pressure. (Nice small State you have there, would be a shame if something were to happen to it. Do you want to defend it, or can we take it.)  Taiwan is basically China's Original Government in Exile.  Republic of China ... Can only act on Taiwan, because they were unable to hold the Mainland. Peoples Republic of China ... Current communist rulers of the mainland           They have the same surname so what would they call them?    These chapters are the best in the manga, I hope we get another soon.    Aldini-kun and Aldini-kun? Souma calls both Erina and Alice just "Nakiri".   Threadly reminder about the best girl   To be fair, these two are essentially perfect for each other.  New OTP achieved.     Why? I don't even see the chemistry between both of them.    Both are after Soma's dick and will get friendzoned forever. You can't get more similar than that.    Well, Souma just doesn't give a fuck and call them Nakiris(Nakiri-tachi, I presume? don't have the raws) when they are together. When you have two or more people with the same surname together it's acceptable to just use their first names.    Nakiri-s is just Souma speak. There isn't a facet of that in the Japanese grammar.     Isami   after Souma's dick  Wrong Aldini, mate.      http://imgur.com/a/a8NNl He essentially says it in English.     actually anon the characters are pretty versatile they could interact with the other characters and they could have a very interesting chemistry between them cept for Erina she seems to only show those amazing reaction faces to Hisako, Alice and Souma     New OTP achieved.  This.     It'll become a VERY big deal once Erina addresses Souma by his first name, &amp; vice versa. Expect the MehGoomyfags to be on suicide watch once that happens.    Is weird since Isami is more irrelevant than fucking meat.    So we have Isami-Megumi, Alice-Ryou and Akira-Jun. Still need some more.    How soon would that be?    I predict Isami to beat Takumi at least once during the story.    Best arc   How do you think about my Otp /a/nons?    Isami will win Mezzaluna back from Souma     I predict Isami to be the better Aldini once they're out of school.    Not so soon. To call him by his first name would be a VERY big deal to her. She has to fully accept him as a cook &amp; a rival, &amp; has to know who his old man is.    I doubt it will happen to obvious.    Isami has had development hinted at since the Autumn Election.    Get your fucking tumblr-tier fanart out of here.    Like Yabuki?    Yeah, he's as based as Yabuki, IMO.    He'll beat Takumi once to show him how much he's grown and inherit the restaurant so Takumi can look towards higher goals.  He's also going to get expelled for Takumi's growth.      His fat -&gt; slim to slim -&gt; fat gimmick has to stop. He should just remain slim, for the rest of the story. MehGoomy doesn't like fat guys, I'd reckon.    Why would he get expelled?    It's OK.     Forcing her adopted son to pretend like he has friends  Jun a cute.     God Damn it, I want both of them to release their porn stash already. There is no way in hell they don't have some porn made with their characters.    Isami has a canon childhood European waifu. Takumi always had qts after him but if Isami is wed locked in an OTP, Takumi will be in need of a replacement.  Ergo, you are now realizing that Megumi is literally Japanese Femsami and therefore would be the perfect cheese to his macaroni.  She's gentle, warm, and closely affiliated with Soma. The perfect grill for the runner up bowl.   TakuMegu end is a good end.        it's good, but not the best    L-Lord Slaine ?    Good taste.     Takumi wants a waifu that resembles his brother  That's pretty fucked up Anon.      Takumi jobs to his brother  Well, I won't be surprised. It's kinda sad that Takumi is literally a fucking joke at this point. He is weakest among top-8 and doesn't have any special talent or ability unlike most of them, even his specialization is shit. He only manages to stay kinda relevant thank to fujos, and now when some new fujobaits like Yugi and Eishi are introduced he may lose even that.      I made the Nanchatte Roast Pork and it was surprisingly easy to do.    Lets get real, those 2 will never fuck. Mostly because Hinako is a loser and Shinomiya an autistic faggot.  Just like Soma and Megumi    Where the fucking spoiler pics?   Tomorrow.    Fuck you. Either Megumi ends up with Souma, or she dies a spinster. Muh girl ain't gonna have some dirty Italian cock shoved into her pure pussy.     Lets get real, those 2 will never fuck    Just like Soma and Megumi   Lets get real  anon, pls stop with the delusions already      don't they light novels written by the manga author ship Alice and Ryou pretty hard? and also Hinako and Shinomiya. I have no doubt they will happen at some point.   Takumi is not terrible enough to be compared to Slaine.   I want to fuck her so bad.    don't they light novels written by the manga author ship Alice and Ryou pretty hard?   The manga itself does, anon. I've said this before, but in what world would 2 hormone-filled, attractive, extremely close and competitive 15 year olds who live under the same roof not be on each other like white on rice?       If I remember correctly volume 3 has a chapter about Ryou and Alice at Christmas in Copenhagen, they even go to a amusement park together. After that she asks him to go to Japan with her.  Translations never.     I want more Hisako and Kurokiba fire! They need to clash more often   She isn't on his level, lest we forget. She got her arse kicked badly by Curry.      Well Kurokiba got his ass kicked by Curry too.    Kyya so cu-cute!    By the power of LOVE    Marginally. If Hisako wants to prove her worth, she should Shokugeki with Curry again.    Megumi is weaker than him. And he'll be fine. He was Souma first rival and the one who made him realise why his dad sent him to Tootsuki after all, the author has plans for him.     !  Fuck off back to tumblr.      not posting the "shut up"panel  One job, anon.      Copenhagen   amusement park  Tivoli?      the judges agreed that the 3 dishes were equally delicious, their abilities are on the same level, I doubt Hisako is on that level.   I've never bother with any Souma thread before and I just come here to ask this; you guys agree that Erina is best girl right?   Ryou very barely lost to Curry. Hisako got crushed.    She isn't; Curry totally annihilated her. It was an absolute blowout.  A person who got a 92 didn't even come close to him. That's the level of difference between her tier &amp; the monster-tier (Curry, Souma, &amp; Ryou).  Alice is still a big question mark, since she jobbed pretty badly to Souma. She needs to do something significant to redeem herself.        yes    Enough of the best girl bait. This thread is for serious discussion only, not for filthy secondaries like yourself.     there actually are people who like Erina  Get out shit taste is probably contagiuous.     Fuck off MehGloomyfag.   :^)        secondaries  Nice try but I read the manga too.     Just for you.    Since you said you didn't bother with any SnS threads, you can fuck off from here.    Probably.    Kuro's only special because he's a better cook than all the other aides. Better than Alice, situationally.   Lobster &gt; Megumi = Hisako &gt; Isami &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Hinako      Where did MehGloomy come from?    I'd rank Hisako over Megumi, by some margin.    No. I initially planned to do just that but I think I'll stay after all.    Fuck off with your shitty ranking.    Hisako is stronger than Megumi, and only barely stronger than Isami. She scored an 88 while he scored an 87.     and Megumi is only barely stronger than Isami  Fucked up that sentence.    how can Hisako be so bad when she has someone like Erina near her? I assume she just doesn't want Erina to teach her anything?   She's probably got more technical knowledge than Megumi.  Unfortunately her only real dish so far was rekt so badly by Curry kebab it made her look scrubbier than Houjou.     No, just fuck off with your iie senpai meme.    Have you seen the two in the kitchen? Hisako practices cooking while Erina just dorks around.     And ability, really. What she did to the turtle&gt;what Megumi did to the fish. She's simply better than Megumi.      She got a fucking 92, you tool. It just that she got matched up with the worst possible opponent.    They probably do stuff together when Hisako isn't busy preparing her stuff.    I'll be here as long as you're mad.     Hisako will never be real   even if she was real you wouldn't be worthy     2 more days to go.  Why does Kurokiba doesn't sound like he's talking about food more than half the time he does.   It's reverse power levels Alice's aid is better than her and Erina's aid is obviously weaker than her.    Hoh sorry I forgot "?"   Does this look like the face of mercy?   It looks like the face that makes me want to suck on his tromboner.   Looks like a face of a slut.   Reina, please.   I want to punch sensei.   The face of my husband   Does KyoAni get off on baiting/trolling /u/fags?  First there was Tamako Love Story  Now there is Hibike with episode 8 into sensei confession.   Next there was episode 11 into adding filler scenes of Shoe1 sucking at trombone to give a way to bond with Kumiko again into Reina getting jealous over spending time with Taki.  Why do they do this?           Where did these come from?   Like moonlight   Not him, but found this one too. No clue where they're from though.     Jesus Christ, Kumiko. Get good you fucking scrub.       As far as I can tell, yuri implies explicitly lesbian attraction, romance, relationships and so on. The yuri crowd in Hibike threads certainly hoped as much.   But the thing is, yuri can be both. It can be both explicit lesbian attraction, and strong friendship with romantic subtext. Most of the yuri is of the former category.  The same applies to this show as well. Look at the arguments yuri crowd is making right now, posts like  and  - they're saying that they're "winning" since they're getting the subtext.  It's clear to everyone that they wanted the explicit kind of yuri to happen, but since everyone considers both kinds of yuri yuri, now they can try to fall back on the other kind of yuri and pretend they were happy with just subtext all along. Because in the end they're both equally valid kinds of yuri. If yuri was considered exclusively explicit lesbian content, they would not attempt to make these arguments.         He's still barely had any screen-time. I don't really know what the fuck Kyoani are doing with him at this point. Are him and Kumiko supposed to be friends again now that they've practised together and shouted at one another? Is his "arc" over? Will they suddenly give him more focus in the very final episode? Shouldn't they instead focus on tying up the band performance and the Kumiko-Reina relationship, seeing as those have been given much more significance? I'm worried that they're going try to put too much stuff into the finale.         BDs     Despite the band supposedly playing for 12 minutes during the competition, I can't imagine half the episode being music only. At best we'd get half of that time, meaning there would still be some ~18 minutes to spend on everything else.  Maybe we get some flashbacks or Kumiko's inner monologue during their play time.      The're really good.  guess I am buying BDs       The're really good.  Check out Asuka's hands.    Will you remember the Etotamas when they're gone?   I will.  I don't expect /a/ or Japan to do the same though.     I will  S2 never ;_;7     i will never forget cock butt, for it was fat and glorious   If you watch it, buy the BDs.   This  Never S2      JAANE    忘れないですです   I'll try to. If I can still remember the Rolling Girls, I can probably remember this.    As much as I love the show, Nya gets on my fucking nerves like nothing else.   I'll remember it as the only show to use CG right, that is, as a fun and colorful medium that clearly looks like 3D, as opposed to shows using it to skirt on animation costs.  Other than that, I doubt I'll hold dear the abysmal humor, the two-dimensional (har har) characters, the annoying co-MC and the forced heartstring-tugging moments.  I wish someone compiled just the 3DCG parts so I could relish in how nice they looked without having to suffer through the shit that the rest of the show was.      Rabbit? More like RabBest.   You and me bro.    Looks embarrassingly childish A show that would air on nickelodeon or disney channel    How many tears will you shed when we get the full dance for the final ED https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5UK<wbr>fMF9vYjI</wbr>  [ ]    Source? All I'm getting is knowyourmeme shit but searching the full page isn't getting me anything    I really don't remember, all I can recall is it was a doujin maybe.    Nevermind thanks I found it      GEMINI by Higashiyama Show      I will just put some pictures in my etotama folder (bunny cock and dess dess) and then forget about the shitty anime.     footfag bait   best anything      I don`t get this "footfag" thing. are you retarded or something?    don't argue it.  Those two posts are mandatory in every etotama thread      I don't even get where this came from since she has no notable feet scenes. Like, at all.      watches anime   bashes things for being childish      It makes even less sense since Cow is an actual admitted footfag.    I thought she was just a smellfag.     no foot scenes   literally cums automatically from having her feet massaged  footfags when will you learn     Think of all the effort they put into making those CG models.  Now think about how the data is just going to be stashed into some server, and never to be touched again. Or worse, they delete the models.     But they never even touch her feet. It's always her ankle.  Also her bare feet are never shown or focused on which is kind of a requirement for this fetish.     Cat Rat Ox Tiger Rabbit Dragon Snake Sheep Monkey Rooster Dog Pig  I'll remember and miss them all.     Just her booty? All her body was glorious.    No shots of her feet whatsoever. mad/10   That part of her gloves that only goes over her middle finger is pretty hot.       quints confirm it.    They should sell it. People will probably buy it too.   Number of Etotama threads in the last 24 hours that had less than 100 posts:        5 Etotama threads! Ha! Ha! Ha!           The fuck, why you guys doing this? Just make one thread people.     implying they were all made at once  One guy made a thread, it soon died, another guy came too late, saw that there was no Etotama thread, made one, soon it also died, rinse and repeat     Each one was one thread. Each one died quick deaths.  Not surprised though, there is nothing to talk about until the last episode and no ome will talk about etotama a week or 2 after that.  It will be forgotten and no one will remember it as everyone here latches onto the next waifu show.         Don't you mean 'Sayonara'?      Anon, no please   ;__;   Jaa nee is fine.     Yes.    Actually I saw 2 or 3 threads open at the same time, since there were so many I just ignore.    there is nothing to talk about until the last episode  I think that is sadly true now. I miss the old threads.   waifu show.  You talking about the other 30 series airing every season? Please, Etotama is the only series trying to be original and well, you can see the price of that, if is not waifushit, shippingshit, /ushit, shonenshit, haremshit and more, it won't sell, and then you see people complaining anime industry is shit.          Should I even bother trying to 'clean' these scans anymore? I am not sure this is how you clean them up, but HOLY SHIT look at all these fucking dots   Maybe she has acne?     Will you remember the Etotamas when they're gone?  I'll probably archieve it for now, it might merit a potential rewatch.     What happened to the rest of the chapters? Or the guy translating die?    I shared the mega link to my scans a few weeks ago. An anon who kept posting with Usa-tan reaction images said he would TL them at his free time, but there hasn't been any news from him ever since.  So either the guy really died (if so, sincerely RIP), or  footfags   best anything          Slut   Best girl.      ...unless you're talking about the 'cleaning' I've been doing, which is being done independently from his TL and straight out of whims of an amateur who has never done anything like this before.  Here, have a picture for comparison.      Where are you reading, anon?    https://mega.co.nz/#F!itESTKzD!uN4r<wbr>JYYaMGjrv8JHLKA1kA</wbr>    Amazing, where is the other stitches?    Only other one that I've done is Nya-tan.    You know what I'll remember after they're gone? ne ushi tora u tatsu mi uma hitsuji saru tori inu i  I ain't got room in my head for the chinese version though.        still 6 more than the characters in the show       The first 6 of them yeah       dat weird blue-green tint as the night turns to day  On one hand it looks disgusting, but on the other it feels comfy      Fuck it, maybe if the TLs are not up by the time I finish 'cleaning' Chapter 7 I'll TL the chapter myself.  If I can still remember Morita-san wa Mukuchi and the threads that /a/ had for it I can remember Etotama.  Cock is love, Tiger is love, Cow is love, Dragon is love, Horse is love.  One autist, a paintbrush and a couple hours later.  I want to commit a crime against the gods.    I don't get it     Take a wild guess.     Very nice work.     Yes, but only because I'll have the character songs downloaded to remind me.    I love that Rabbit has a little apron on her bikini bottom.    Who let the cow-titted hag in this image?    third character song mini album released on Japanrecords   track titles are wrong  This seems really suspicious.     45 seconds until I know    And it works.    SMUG AHEAD    What exactly am I looking at?     the etotama protects specific regions of japan.     I must say Piyo-tan fans are really devoted.    Piyo-tan is a treasure and everyone should like her.  Every girl should be loved though.   Except fatties.           a shogi piece appears on her back suddenly  being animator is suffering.     Nyaa, Uri, Moo, Piyo, Mei, Chuu, Usa, Shima, Dora, Shaa, Kii and Inu. They're all best.          Maybe it's cause of the framerate.            I want to make horse feel wanted, if you know what I mean.    I'd  race  with her.    Well, I'd mount her.    I'd whisper her name in her ear over and over again until she starts to think it sounds good.     until she starts to think it sounds good.   I don't think you can live that long.      With or without a bridle?    Not sure why she thinks 'Uma' doesn't sound good, isn't that what Japan calls Caramelldansen?     So, do the etotamas who has ear things over their head, do they still have ears where it would normally be or no?  Like , in that pic you can't see any 'ear' because it's covered by her side hair, same with all the other etotamas (except dess dess) who has ears on top of their head.       Paca-tan S2 never  Why?   Only show I actually really enjoyed this season. Rest have just been really average or not exactly enjoyable. If it weren't for Prisma coming out summer, I'd probably have dropped the cash on the BD's.    I would have totally bought the BDs   But I didn't.   Thank you for your ultimately pointless post.   Feel free to reply to me, just like I replied to you.         Why?  Do you even need to ask that question?     I'm not him but okay    What happened to the brown Etos? I want my collection complete.     I will easily forget them, what a bland boring show. Okay, it's not that bad, 7/10 at least.    I hope we see something Nendowise from Wonderfest this fall.   I wonder how they will play this joke on the bluerays    I hope the rabbit scene is replaced with her thanking the viewer for purchasing the BDs and supporting the industry.   It was a good ride guys.  Glad to share these moments with you all.    which of the etotama would say yes if you just came up to them with a straight face and asked to have sex with them   All of them except the one you like, because you're waifu a shit.     I'm sure dess dess would say yes if you slathered yourself with sesame oil beforehand, and injected sesame oil into your testicles     She should also shit on people who are just pirating the BD in the same scene.    Mo, Shaa, Kii, and Shima seem like they'd be game.      ejaculate sesame oil   Give her what she wants and render yourself permanently sterile at the same time, where is the bad in this        Cow couldn't   Cock couldn't twice   Rat couldn't   Combo of Sheep, Snake, and Rat couldn't    Rabbit could   Best           All of them, if I'm being honest with myself.  If I had to choose the most sexual though, it would be Kii, Shaa, Uma, Nyaa, and Shima.      It helps that this thread asks a relevant qiestion considering the show is ending with no sign of it ever getting a S2.  But yes Usa-tan a best.       Usa-tan seems to be the marmite of the etotamas.  I think she's unbearable, and others have expressed the same opinion. I respect your opinion though.         Mo-tan  Only if you are a cute girl anon.     Please, this thread was dying yesterday, Cock save it     Well I read that question completely backwards. Now I sound like a narcissistic sociopath.  None of them, if I'm not allowed to use trickery.       Cock couldn't even save either of her own threads.     if you raped cock and forced her to take 3 steps every time, will it lead to a mind break     depends.  She will either instinctually learn to crave your cock or instinctually do all she can to rip it clear off any time she sees you.  high risk high reward.         I'm sure it'll be easier if you gave her some form of classical conditioning a la Pavlov's Dog experiment.  Except instead of conditioning a dog to salivate to the sound of a bell, you make cock salivate to a good dicking.  since she forgets the experience every time it's even easier, considering she wouldn't realized she's being conditioned           you could take it a step further and make her associate everyday things to dicks, so when she's doing something like drinking water she'll crave sex.     I don't want it to be thursday yet  What if.... ova.     character specific OVAs that is about them and not about fucking recaps   I can dream       I was thinking more of a catch up ova this fall, with Nyan-tan helping out Chu-tan and  loli Mo-tan  care for the world.    We're getting those OVA shorts. I wouldn't expect anything else.    Still waiting for those manga translations. Some anon said he was going to do chapter 7.  Cock.  You got to take to a date and spend one day with your zodiac, how does it go?    rat  I'd rather kill myself      Kii-tan   I dunno, I wouldn't mind playing around with her but she'd probably miss Inu-tan quickly. Can I take them both?       Kii-tan.  It would end in sex because she's easily tricked, and she really turns me on.       Cock.     I probably won't.  It seems like one of those shows that are fun but forgettable and you barely remember their name a few years later, like Kyouran Kazoku Nikki.      We talk about deep things and end up cuddling.     Dora-tan  Would be fun      Dragon   That's fine. She's cute. And if she's patient enough to deal with Nya-tan's shit then she probably won't have a problem with me either.       We'd play shogi all day and eat KFC.     Rat  Is rat still batshit insane or have the others already cured her at that point?      implying we will have a healing ending  oh anon       Cock.  We'd play board games for awhile. Then I'd take her out to see the town, so I would have to princess carry her around for the day so she wouldn't walk anywhere.   We'd end up getting close, and I'd finally confess my feelings for her. We'd move in close for a kiss, but she'd suddenly trip, take three steps, forget who I was and fly away.       Gonna miss this desdes  I would "Eto" all of the Tamas, if you know what I mean.  That special was cute. Inu-tan x Key-tan OTP       dog  I'd commit a crime.      that thigh gap  I want some porking.      Those hips   That gap   The way her stockings make her thighs bulge a bit   I'd take her for a roll in the mud.        I will, just like i still remember eto-rangers. Gonna love them zodiacs.     Monkey  It would be a fun day, I would take her some nice places, see what she likes, invite her some tasty things, I bet she would want a banana split, the amusement park is mandatory to have more fun and get closer, then walk her back home holding hands, it wouldbe funny, I bet she wouldn't realize we are holding hands after some time have passed and then she would blush, so cute, and by the time we get home I would tell her how much I liked to spend all the day with her and then move close for a kiss, but just in the most important part of the night, Inu-tan would jump out of nowhere and surprise us, we would just burst out laugh and then say goodbye, then turn around and walk away while I hear Inu-tan asking her lots of things, but just in that moment, I heard someone running towards me, and get a surprise kiss on the cheek from Ki-tan, that said to me to see us again some other day.  Sorry for the bad english.       Cute.    If there are good doujins than the memory of Etotama will live on in my penis engine for years to come.    There won't be any doujins and you know it.    We don't know that. There might be one or two.      Well spank my cock and call me in the morning    I don't know about your cock, but I'd spank this cock    Just kidding, I'd spank yours too.      I [simple present form] [insert etoshin]   That's a nice cock, now check my cock having some pussy.   Remove [insert etoshin]   Cow    Already been done  you monster     Ratshit, fuck that stupid whore    ratatats.    Suck cock     Breasts in picture   Ass in thumbnail   MAGIC      [insert etoshin animal]? More like [first half of etoshin animal name]Best.    [fetish] bait   best anything      I would serve her cheese    Snake   Mei-tan a cutest  A CUTEST     She truly is, but I doubt we get any screen time of her in the last episode, really, 12 episodes for this series was too little, for the least 24 to explore every Eto-shin more in deep, we just got sample test from all of them.   I want last episode to show whatever possessed Chu-tan spawned some sort of dark minion after Chu's downed  so the rest of the Etos can have an excuse to enter combat fully armed (Shima's nunchuck, Kii's staff etc) at last     I'm sorry, your picture distracted me to such a degree that all your words look like a jumbled up mess   I'm still waiting for the Onsen King to be the surprise final boss, ripping out Chuu-tan's Sol/Lull Seal and trying to give humanity a spot on the Zodiac.  It's revealed that he's actually a time traveler and was born on the year of the cat, but despises it because most people born on that year turn out to be assholes.    [insert etoshin] did nothing wrong.   Kii-tan and Inu-tan did nothing . Yes, they did nothing.    What?    COCK!    Are we ready for out true love to return?  Boar and Horse is best   I hope she stays ded     Snake  I'll probably spend the entire date trying to leech investment advice off her. I don't think I'll get very far romantically.     Snake is just odd, I like her but she never had enough time to be really show her troll.   But damn that body.      It would be impossible to tell if she was into you.   Welp, less that 12 hours for this wild ride to end. It's been fun.  Why do everything I like doesn't sell  Why the fuck am I getting these ISP ban messages when I haven't fucking done anything, I don't want to miss the last episode discussion   Never mind, all is well.  Have some hamsters as an apology for the out-of-discussion post     The final day is here, such misfortune.   Mei-tan  Why can't my parents have sex a year later or earlier. I want to be born under Monkey, and Horse is atleast fun to bully.        I can't decide between Shaa-tan and Shima-tan. They're both best, along with Kii-tan.     Shag a sheep   It's your last chance to make Moo-Tan respawn!   Finally! The last stitch, thanks.    there is no zodiac portal in my room     ribbons-colon-three  But there are four ribbons in that picture.     Five.     QUICK, SOMEONE ADD THIS TO PIC RELATED     You couldn't just let me shitpost in peace, huh?      Saved     THE LEGEND CONTINUES     Not looking in the right direction. Stop trying to force extra faces in to this image.    <br/>     Up, and to the left   Not the right direction   wat        I like this one better than     羊  She is absolutely not my type, but I have no malice for her and since she's such an friendly, positive girl, I suppose we could just spend the day agreeing on nice things and enjoying stuff. We would listen to an album, something bright and nice, like Pet Sounds (sequel album Zodiac Sounds when?) and drink coffee. We would smile and part ways and I would remember to keep in touch in case I needed medical advice.    I don't want it to be over     Tiger    We hit up a nice bar and grill and she drinks me under the table and has her way with me. WOO HOO!      Soon, my friends  Dancing when   They're... ehrm... cute. Yes. They're cute.   I guess. Probably cute.       Man is the real monster after all.     Etotama will be over in a few hours     With BD Vol 6.   which you'll buy, right? Right?      Tiger is sex, I bet she fucks like one.   I would buy it if it were released in the west to a reasonable price, bundled with other BDs.    She fucks like sex?    It will probably get localized. I've seen less popular things get localized. Pic related.  Don't expect any of the extra content though. I've heard that localized releases are usually bare-bones.       That's okay, I'm sure the full MV will be posted somewhere in the Internet soon   SeolLalBOBVEVO when       Ah, hamsters, aren't they cute?  Little rapist cannibals murdering each another and traumatizing little kids since Hamtaro       Shows skin   Becomes sexy instantly    That's just being a slut anon.       Unfortunately, we all know that she will return.   The CGI on the BDs is still 24fps right?  Wish they'd render these parts at 50 (TV standard) for the BDs.     ToraDora otp    you will never see another episode of Etotama after this week  Why live?   ufufu   Because there are other more enjoyable things to do. Etotama was just a mediocre show in the end. Enjoyable to some degree, but nothing to get sad over when it ends.   Perhaps some dedicated fan will one day make motion interpolation enhanced 1080p 60fps sequences of the show's CGI sequences and upload them on youtube.     2 hours until literal 'Let's mou ikkai'.  You guys ready?     Only if we see breast girls return.    This. Show started off somewhat amusing and just fell over itself when it tried becoming SUPER SERIOUS.   Why isn't there a bear eto musume?   Wish Watanabe did more porn, jesus christ.    okaeri     Jaa ne.     I just want more Mo~      This. And put Show By Rock up there beside it. What disappointing shows with a surprising amount of instantly loveable characters, and bland MCs.      it tried becoming super serious   implying it became serious       TRIED you moron, can't you read?      implying it ever tried       Ready for the finale?  So, why is Rat doing all this shit again?   Never.    I'm curious what a crocodile Eto-musume would look like. Doesn't sound like a workable concept.     something about her etotama being corrupted by negative feelings     I would think like Dora-tan concerning the tail with green hair or some shit like that     If japan can anthropomorphize a horseshoe crab and a cockroach they can make a crocodile eto-musume.     With crocodile hat?  That's true. I guess it can go those two's route and just have it look like a normal girl with giant crocodile on the back.       Hell, Paca-tan is just a (probably) white-haired girl wearing a parka that says 'Alpaca', how hard to make could a Croco-tan be?    Is desudesu shirt the only one sold out?  Original designs look pretty different.    Bottom right  ARE THOSE???     They are.     I'm glad they changed Shima tan to make her paw things into nunchucks   dat bottom right        What are they gonna do with all those unsold I ♥ Nya-tan shirts?      Nya-tan with slightly longer hair   muh dick       Just put them in the old clothes collection.     How much do the Uri-tan figures cost? That's the real question     Aye, seem so. She's surprisingly popular. There quite a few merchandise there.    Not only DEATH DEATH, but those little things next to the shirts are also running out on Uri.  Fantastic taste right there  dess dess        Uri-tan is an oldfag, of course she's popular    So, are you guys gotta make a stream when the new episode airs?   Those seem to be keychains. I want to buy all of them.   Why didn't they make dess dess the main heroine?   She's basically the deuteragonist, what with all the merch, screentime and  manga     It seemed like a good idea to make cat the main character at the time.   It could have worked. You just need good writers.      Eto-musume figures were planned as an annual line, starting with Uri-tan.   didn't work out, only Uri-tan is in circulation    Anime airs in 2015, 8 years after the idea for eto-musume was conceived   business model is complete shit, BDs release before anime even started airing on TV   Etotama is such a 'failed' series, I feel bad man.        Should they have made this a kids' show instead?   I really sometimes wonder how this kind of stuff comes about. It's not that one guy somewhere thought this was a good idea, it's that there surely must have been dozens of people that could have stopped it.     at least it'll be known for its kickass 3D  if in the future 3D is more prominent in anime I'll think of etotama as the stepping stone      Usual stream, right?  Soon will be time for sayonara and not matane  Starting   There was a trailer for an upcoming kids CGI anime series set in a typical fantasy world where a boy/lad, a strong guy, and a girl go on an adventure to fight a gorgon. Can't find it anymore on youtube, since I don't remember it's name, but it looked helluva lot more impressive than Etotama's choppy CGI.    Post stream please!       streaming anime        Forgot to optimize the canvas size.     Them  bird   feet   Cat is kill   noooo   Christ my connection is super laggy today, can't tell jack shit   How does tail work?    nooo     So  Nya-tan betrayed Chu-tan first.   I can't either, wonder if it's the stream or not.     More like Chu-tan is kill.    Wait wut  Fucking stream I swear, maybe I should wait for HS     DID RAT JUST MELT   Rat a cute.    I'd still love her even if she was a puddle    Yay, Chu-tan's fixed.   That was reveal in the clockwork arena scene,  apparently Cat strike first against Rat because Nya-tan want Chu-tan to finally rest, but Cat fucked up and only partially broke Chu-tan's etotama - making her go berserk with negative energy.         Is chu-tan gandalf     you where criminally underused and underdeveloped    I chuckled.    She still dress like a slut. A sluuuuuut.     let's just make her wear white   Oh come the fuck on.     And so  Nya-tan didn't get to join zodiac in the most anti-climatic way ever.  Oh, and,  Moo-tan's back.    SHE'S BACK.   Shirochu is cute   Season 2 confirmed.  S2? S2?  S2---------?!?!    Fuck, the lag literally skipped 80% of the whole anime.  Anyone can explain what exactly happened after the credits?      So Chu-tan became best gril?  WELL, THAT'S IT, GUYS. IT'S OVER. EVERYONE GO HOME.  See you later in the occasional "anime nobody watched" threads.     Truly an art.    cow return     anime nobody watched" threads  I think a lot of good shows this season are going to get dumped in there. Too much Danmachi and Kekkai Sensen taking up everyone's attention. Besides the other obvious franchise shit of course.      matanya   ;_;      It'll be fun to reminisce about Etotama with all the other shows in that category.    All I saw was a mysterious figure wrap in cape standing in a desert(?). I wonder if they had plan for season two or is this just the usual tease ending a few anime have.   Thank you!!    Thank you for all the Sol/Lull   See you again nya!!  And now I'm sad again. Fuck everything.        Can we all take a moment to appreciate how  SHIT  Takeru is and how much  better the show would have been without him    I wouldn't go that far.  As long as we replaced him with manga Takeru.     But he's literally Homuhomu    Manga Takeru would've taken all the spotlight and become best girl.   It's over ;-;    So you want all the other girls to get outshined by his and Uri-tan's banter? Oh and Paca-tan never.  ;_;       It ain't over till the fat lady sin-  Rat ED  FUCK     I checked http://etotama.com/story/ out of habit ;_;   It's not over until HS come out in about half an hour.     More love for the best etoshin.   So, Cat did literally everything wrong.  Sasuga      So what happened? Did the 60 day period end and Nya-tan get denied her Eto-shin pass?    Why is Tiger flipping me off?    Didn't mean to quoote.    You mean the ending?  Chu-tan tell Nya-tan that she can't give Nya-tan her seal because she want to stay as part of the Eto-shin and set thing right by protecting people again, this heartfelt declaration moved everyone (except Nya-tan) and everyone told Nya-tan that she's fine the way she is, being free from responsibility. Chu-tan then offer her hand to Nya-tan and said that they should protect humanity together again,  Nya-tan refuse.     So Cat was a bitch all along.    offer her hand  Oh MY     Cat really is the worst girl.    What?  pig is not. boar desu desu      So she isn't really a cat?    It's done in a comedic fashion, no mean intention.     refusing living a life of adventures with Chu-tan   Worst cat ever     They really put in effort in designing background.  It's here    eventually pass on  Why ought they?   Even from the hazy metaphysical framework of AB, souls seem to just be recycled into new lives, so from the point of view of someone aware of this process they simply have to weigh whether their memories are bad enough that they will prefer to leave them behind via disappearing or whether they can simply come to terms with it and continue a very fun afterlife. From a point of view of someone entirely unaware of what happens after disappearing, one ought treat it with the same kind of wariness one treats death with, and therefore tend to avoid it.  There is, of course, kind of an arbitrary and capricious being who will make you move on even if you don't want to by sending scary monsters out to get you, but then you ought consider whether moving on is objectively good because LOVE guy says it is or whether this is in fact just arbitrary and capricious.   That is not a valid reason to live in a delusion forever.   Says you.            Those little kids in the park seems to be having so much fun. But that is no good, they need to realize that this world is fake. ALL FAKE Ha...ha... But don't worry, big brother is here to save you! Now let me return you all to heaven to meet father!   Shh... don't cry, little boy. Be brave! You need to move on, this is for you own good.       Haruhi looks good in this game.      or whether they can simply come to terms with it  Which means moving on. That is what happens when they accept their shitty life as being real and worth living. It is a wonderful thing being alive, and that was what the afterlife was trying to teach you.  continue in a very fun afterlife  We know what happened to the last person who tried that shit. It didn't end well for him.   From a point of view of someone entirely unaware of what happens after disappearing, one ought treat it with the same kind of wariness one treats death with, and therefore tend to avoid it  That is utterly untrue. It may be at first when people didn't realize why the fuck they were in that world for. But after finding out the truth, they accepted that moving on was what was best for themselves. Every last one of them. Even Hinata believed Otonashi was doing the right thing after helping Yui get past her regrets and said that they have many more friends that needs help. Yuri needed time and friends to get over her trauma and that's what the afterlife gave her to help her move on.         I mean let's face it, the SSS pussied the fuck out. If they had held the fort while Yuri went full operatah and solved the whole shadow crisis, they would have been able to live in a paradise for as long as they wanted, plus the ability to  make  love.  How do you feel about Sakura?  Did Sakura actually imply at the true end of HF that she and Shirou were fucking like crazy to transfer that excess mana off of her?    Yeah, she needs to release mana and Shirou is the perfect guy for it.     Worst couple.   I don't like her. I don't even know why.   She's a badly written character and that's it. I don't particularly hate her but I don't give a fuck either, I personally think people's reason for hating her are petty. She's extremely beautiful with long hair, though.  But honestly I got Fate/Zero flashbacks with her, she's like Kiritsugu 2.0 with all the sob story and the 24/7 pity party.     O_O  Sauce   i see this pic in facebook is real ?   Great thread   His hair and forehead kind of look off. Not sure what it is. Also his stand looks shorter than he is, even though they float a foot off the ground usually.  I never noticed the hand on his lapel badges, was that foreshadowing for Okuyasu?   Oh yeah, inb4 What the fuck did you say about my hair?      Fake. It's been posted for months maybe even a year   ITT: Gay couple  I don't get why you fujoshis get off on pairings and shipping. Why don't you just self insert?   Miho x Yukari    If you must, would be more accurate for the thread's participants.    Shit could not be gayer.     grabbing images off google   not even changing filenames   calling others newfags  Tumbrfaggots at their worst       Nikaido Kaho is a daughter of a rich family and her whole life everyone's been nice to her. When moving to her new high school dormitory, she almost gets hit by a truck but is saved by a boy. It's love at first sight for Kaho but when asking him his name, he tells her she's weird. Kaho is shocked since it's the first time anyone's ever said mean things to her. Soon enough, she finds out that the boy who saved her lives in the same dormitory and so she bravely confesses her love. The boy says his name is Kanade and agrees to go out with her. Unfortunately, the following day Kaho finds out that her first boyfriend is a 5th grader.   http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/650<wbr>09  What  </wbr>  </blockquote>]
