[ Bleach 633  So anything of merit worth talking about this chapter? <br><br>Toofsy's sternritters when</br></br>  <br>Oh, look, two of the characters worth caring about, neither of whom were in this chapter.<br><br>No, there's no need for this thread, and there's no need for a constant Bleach thread on the board.</br></br></br>  Here we have a version of Bleach written in Afro-American Vernacular English:<br> &gt;http://readms.com/r/bleach/633/28<wbr>44/1</wbr> </br>  <br> No, there's no need for this thread, and there's no need for a constant Bleach thread on the board <br>Bugger off.<br>If no one cares it dies. There's no reason for people like you to bitch about it.</br></br></br>  My favourite page for a while  Wait, that was it? That was the whole flashback?  <br>I like how kubo could have made this whole flashback into one chapter and lost nothing</br>   next chapter starts <br> ichigo and crew are still chasing askin  <br><br>I like how grimmjow is acting like he could even hurt the guy if he caught him</br></br></br>  <br><br> askin wanted Mayuri to follow him <br> mayuri was too smart and said no thanks <br> ichigo and the retard crew can't help themselves </br></br></br></br>   Quincy genocide was 200 years ago <br>KUBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br><br> the quincy genocide was done because the shinigami wanted to kill the next would-be power-sharer <br><br> ywatch-like power sharers is also the reason being a shinigami substitute and also Rukia lending powers to Ichigo was such a big deal <br><br> the first shinigami substitute, Ginjo, has power sharing abilities </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OOOOOOO FUUUUUUUCCKKKKKKK</br>  <br> I like how grimmjow is acting like he could even hurt the guy if he caught him <br>But what if Grimmjow got a piece of Ichigo's soul during his fight with Ichigo? and that soul fragment has been evolving and enhancing Grimm's power even more. What if Grimmjow is Ichigo's letter D 'The Destroy' Star Knight?</br></br>  Well, that was over faster than expected    <br>was probably the worst flashback in the entire series solely because they could have done it on one page or gave us a bunch of chapters covering the ancient history of the quincies<br><br>instead he went shitty version of both outcomes</br></br></br>  <br>Is that why Aizen is stronger now? Because of Ichigo's soul piece? Are all the people around Ichigo gonna die at one point when he decides he needs his power back?</br>  <br>FUCK<br><br> you are now aware that, in order for Ichigo to restore his power after Mugetsu, had to take a spirit sword made of power from lots of people he influenced before <br><br>KUBOOOOOOO</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>WAIT A MINUTE THIS MAKES SENSE<br>KUUUUUBBBBBOOOOO!!!!!!!!</br></br>  <br>Indeed. But I've taken to the belief that with Kubo 'everything is possible, until it's not, and even then it might still happen'. Basically around Kubo never Relax or you'll get caught off guard.</br>  <br>So where they really giving him his soul back because he has the power sharing ability or ala rukia is this just a common ability?</br>  <br>And was pierced in the same place like Ishida after he lost his powers</br>  So Juhabach is at least 1000 years old<br><br>He says special Quincy are only born every 200 years....even though he says there was never one before so how did he decide that.<br><br>Bazz says they're supposed to happen every decade but there hasn't been one since Flashbackception McGee here. <br><br>Juhaback got sealed 900 years ago<br><br>Genryusai failed to kill him 1000 years ago<br><br>Just trying to figure out the timeline.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So Juhabach is at least 1000 years old <br>Do you not remember the whole "999 years, 11 months and 30 days" bullshit?</br></br>  <br>try to fit the quincy genocide and all the rest of the quincy births in there and gets even worse<br><br><br><br>that's why he said at least</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is that why Aizen is stronger now? Because of Ichigo's soul piece? Are all the people around Ichigo gonna die at one point when he decides he needs his power back? <br>I wasn't really serious about that post, but if it is true, then it could be the reason Aizen got stronger even though the HG had made him weaker pre-timeskip. And if Ichigo did impart his Soul to everyone and is going to gain those cultivated pieces back for the Final showdown; I doubt anyone will die and that the worst that will happen is they'll lose their powers.<br><br><br> So where they really giving him his soul back because he has the power sharing ability <br>Even if what that other Anon said was true the Shinigami wouldn't have known that, but Urahara might have had an idea as he was the one who made the Spirit Sword for everyone to put their power into.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So Ichigo is going to absorb all the power he has lent out.<br><br>This will include Bach as he had been giving young bach power the whole time which fueled current bach to reawaken<br><br>so Ichigo will absorb everything and become god</br></br></br></br>  So being the Uber Quincy enhances the powers of those around you. The Hogyoku does the same thing. Is it a ball of crystallized Uber Quincy?  Spoiler week continues here<br><br>Eren's height is actually canon Edition</br></br>  <br>Worst shingekis.</br>  <br>eremikadefensesquad please go back to tumblr.</br>   still no leaks   <br>I like how this picture has their heights in it too.<br><br>Like as if it's saying "hey look Eren is 7cm bigger than her! so it's definitely ok for the two to be a couple!! nothing wrong with being a subhuman (sub 6ft) manlet!!!"</br></br></br>  <br>ackersexual pls.</br>  <br> HELM mentioned <br> EMfag gets butthurt <br>Why are you so insecure?</br></br></br>  <br>He's not taking it so well after canon EH blushing &amp; handholding and canon LM kissing and cover all in the same month.</br>  <br>EM BTFO for the millionth time.</br>  <br>Just wait for the movie. The trailer looked more like EM.</br>  <br>Coolman229 please.</br>  <br> EM  <br> not BTFO </br></br>  <br>I'm not interested in the movie because none of the characters I like are in it.</br>  <br>fuku-shuu pls.</br>  <br>I guess we should let him have fun and post his shitty fanarts. It's all he has left. <br><br><br>Watch the trailer in HD and pause it. It's definitely not Eren. Plus the actress that played Mikasa said she doesn't see EM as romantic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Same. Although I got a little interested after Isayama was mentioned. I might watch it to have good laugh though.</br>  <br>I'm not talking about the kiss, but the trailer in general. The kiss looks kind of forced and Eren will probably go full rageturd on him or some bullshit like that.</br>  <br> EM were screaming each other's names and Eren was jealous after Shikishima kissed Micucksa.</br>  <br>Maybe the story will be better than the actual manga</br>  <br>Is it karma for chapter 70 now that Eren is the cuck?</br>  <br>Well at least shippers get the romance fantasy they've always wanted.</br>  <br>The guns already make me sceptical.</br>  <br>Eren's too busy holding hands with Armin or Historia to care what Mikasa does.</br>  <br>But it doesn't Mikasa, who is stronk, didn't push him off and even closed her eyes.</br>  <br>Why would he? It's not like Shikishima was raping his sister.</br>  <br>She doesn't have her strength in the movie.</br>  <br>Maybe Eren will push him away. We already saw a pic of Eren arguing with OC guy. She also makes a strange face before it happens.</br>  <br>I was talking about movie Eren getting buttmad. Historia's not even in the movie because no aryans.</br>   an OOC 3DPD movie had to be made to give EMfags what they want <br>How sad.</br>  <br>[citation needed]<br>Eren is still a titan, and she's still the first of her class.</br></br>  i hope my fellow ymirbrothers will follow me in mass suicide if Isayama actually dares to continue going this het road with EH  <br><br>Why are so many people saying Eren was jealous by the kiss? What part of the trailer showed that?</br></br>  <br>He was seen arguing with Donut Steel later. But it could be a different scene entirely.</br>  <br>Mind posting pic? And that's Kiko overall face, really.</br>  <br>If she was in the movie he would tell her how amazing she was while Mikasa is getting kissed by some shitlet OC.</br>  <br>The EMfags and LMfags got everything they wanted in the movie.</br>  <br>But she is. Her name in it is Hayana or something like that.</br>  <br>Too bad she's not and now Eren is stuck in kebab cuckland.</br>  <br>Yes, a shitty adaption. Feels good being an EHfag.</br>  <br>The scene where he goes in to punch the OC guy. You can see the background is the same scene.</br>  <br> google hayana shingeki movie <br> get indian porn star in results </br></br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>   Series with actual plot <br> everyone is talking about shipping instead </br>  <br> My nigga </br>  <br>You can't really see the background of the kiss scene, and they are with the clothes all the movie, probably.</br>  <br>I'd say wait until the actual chapter comes out but there'd probably be shitposting anyway.</br>  <br>Who cares? It's an OOC adaption anyway. Don't waste time in analysing something insignificant.</br>  <br>I doubt Eren would punch someone above him in rank for kissing Mikasa.</br>  <br>Still related to the series and allowed.</br>  <br>Here.</br>  <br>It's Hiana.</br>  <br>Maybe movie Eren is different. He's a shitty plot device in the manga after all, he could actually have character in live action.</br>  Whats EM and LM?  <br>Glowing titty.</br>  <br/>  <br><br>Eren x Marco and Levi x Marco</br></br>  <br>Cute.</br>  Are you guys ready for some troubles?  <br>I thought that was movie Annie since she's apparently canon with movie Bert.</br>  <br>The ships eremikadefensesquad and ackersexual fight each other for.</br>  <br>Lili or whatever is annie.</br>  <br><br> canon with bert <br> not with armin <br><br>What is this shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it true that his name is  Remus? </br>  <br>That's Lili.</br>  <br>Annie is Lil. Bertholdt isn't in the movie.</br>  <br>How is punching someone for a kiss considered having character? If they were going to change him that much they were better off changing his name and calling him an OC too. The whole reason why certain characters had their names changed was to avoid pissed off fans so why would they have a main character named Eren in love with Mikasa? You can't be that OOC and still share a name with a canon character.</br>  <br>I really hope we actually get his name next chapter.</br>  <br>Then who is Colossal</br>  <br>More than ever.</br>  <br>Armin.</br>  <br><br>No idea, haven't heard it yet.<br><br><br><br> inb4 his last name is Jaeger </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But he's also a rageturd in the manga.</br>  <br>His name is Chaz.</br>  <br>Not Bert is Fukushi.</br>    <br> You can't be that OOC and still share a name with a canon character <br>Says who? Mikasa looks pretty OOC too.</br></br>  <br>Why is Annie kissing Krista?</br>  <br>He still wouldn't be obsessively jealous of Mikasa and punch a guy for kissing her, even in the manga. His brain just isn't programmed to care about shit like that.</br>  While we're on the topic of troubles, who had it worse?<br><br>Nick or Mike? <br><br> I vote Nick because he was a god-fearing man who didn't afraid of anything </br></br></br></br>  <br>You didn't watch the movie to know. She even do the cruel world speech and all.</br>  <br>Because short blonde girls have to stick together</br>  <br>Maybe that's the only OOC part about him.</br>  <br><br>That's not Krista its Reiner.</br></br>  Will we get something like this again this month, brothers?  <br>Damn, Nips are really really ugly people compared to their anime characters.<br><br>I guess you were right when you said that anime is based on white people.</br></br></br>  <br>Just that he didn't punch Levi, they were just talking.</br>  <br>Maybe he would. Who's to say he wouldn't react that way.</br>  <br>Nips are on average very ugly.</br>  <br>We didn't see the whole scene. Just a pic of him arguing with OC guy.</br>  <br>Does Ackerman talk count?</br>  <br>If they didn't care about characters looking OOC they would've put manlet in there and actually used his name. So far movie Mikasa has said the same lines she said in the manga so I don't see how she's OOC.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Again, pic pls?</br>  <br>So much our dreams of going there and becoming English teachers and live the dream of eating ramen and sushi and bento and buying Shingeki no Kyojin merchandise all day long.</br>  <br>Shonkishima grabbed his fist.</br>  <br>Bert getting NTRed is a miracle of the universe.</br>  <br>I was thinking more about the lines of eh moments. But EMfags getting BTFO would be nice too.</br>  Which characters other than Levi weren't in the film?  <br>I fear Isayama is going to toss EH's relationship away.</br>  <br>Do you even read the manga? Eren didn't get the whole Marlo/Hitch thing and he didn't even realize Jean was in love with Mikasa even after he practically said it to him. Eren doesn't care about romance and wouldn't care about someone kissing Mikasa. He'd probably just tell them to hurry up so they can get on with the mission.</br>  <br>Probably, since a new arc is starting.</br>  <br>That's not gonna happen. Though they might not interact this chapter.</br>  <br>BRAY, Erwin, Connie, and Marco.</br>  <br><br>Truly the purest form of justice.</br></br>  <br>*BRAYH</br>  <br>Who the fuck were in the titans then?</br>  <br>Everyone, except EMA.</br>  <br>Will Historia give Eren a good luck kissu?</br>  <br>i'm just wondering how this asshole beat the armored titan</br>  <br> the kids look like chimpanzees <br><br>Hetfag fanart always delivering the worst quality possible.</br></br></br>  <br>Why? Historia is obviously going in the next scouting, so I don't see they being separated soon. She's still part of the top 10.</br>  <br>EH child looks like it has downs.</br>  <br><br><br>Don't even care about the Hetfaggotry, just liked the crazy AA kid.</br></br></br>  <br>Connie is in it though. So is Annie.</br>  <br>She is the queen. She cannot do this anymore, she has to wait in the orphanage for Ymir, her true love.</br>  <br>Mr. Hanji was in it.</br>  <br>Maybe the OCs?</br>  <br>After the reader learned about their connection it would make sense if they had a scene together. There's not much to discuss though. He could tell her he's an Ackerman too. Knowing how Isayama handles awkward moments it has the potential to be pretty funny.</br>  <br>Ymir is kill and Historia isn't a lesbian anyway.</br>  <br>Eren's more focused on Titans than on women. That's why Annie is the perfect girl for him.</br>  <br>I and the EMfags will probably die if that happens. Me from hapiness.</br>  <br>That's not an OC, that's the guy based on a Japanese general responsible for the genocide of Korean people. They changed his appearance / name so the movie sells better in Korea.</br>  <br>No, they're changed with Lil and Souda(?)<br>Like how Levi is changed with Shikishima and all</br></br>  <br>Annie likes Armin.</br>  <br><br>muh nigga</br></br>  <br>She has to take care of people inside the walls. They'll probably barely interact from now on, since the political arc just ended.</br>  <br>Oh, so he's Pixis? I thought he was Erwin.</br>  <br>Me too, from keking.</br>  <br>That means they aren't in it.</br>  <br>They can share each other. I'm sure none of them would object.</br>  <br>It's ok, they don't have to interact anymore. We'll get the surprise 9 months later.</br>  <br>She will carry their child and wait for Eren's return.</br>  <br>Yeah. I was saying they aren't in it.</br>  Dumping best couple.  <br><br>nice</br></br>    <br>Most of the people who lost their homes might go too, since Wall Maria's fixing is certainly by their point of view. And Historia wouldn't stay on the background doing nothing, she proved it with the chicken titan.</br>  <br> Mina/Annie <br> not Hitch/Annie </br></br>    Annie is a slut.  <br>Chicken titan was a personal thing.</br>  Arminfags are the worst shitposters, I wish they would just die.    <br><br>EH confirmed.</br></br>  <br>Anyone have that comic where Hitch challenges Historia to a contest for Annie's attention?</br>  <br><br> worse than Ymirshits and Hisfags <br><br>You're kidding right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't lump me in with Ymirfags and Arminfags.</br>  <br><br>Wow thanks. I didn't expect anything from this, but this Japanese perception of what Germans are like actually gave me cancer!</br></br>  <br>That was in Chuugakkou right?</br>  <br>You are still cancerous.</br>  <br>Historiafags did nothing wrong.</br>  <br><br>thanks</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br><br> the main shitposters in every single thread since chapter 60 did nothing wrong </br></br>  <br>Just having fun like everyone else.</br>  <br> main shitposters in every single thread <br>That's Ymirfags, dumbass</br></br>  <br>There's no such thing as a non-shitposter in these threads.</br>  <br><br>Ymirfags, Hisfags. What's the difference?</br></br>  <br>Yes, they did.</br>  <br><br>Says the Hisfag.</br></br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>That would be the netherfag, and that since way before ch 60.</br>  <br>http://imgur.com/a/gZSnO</br>  <br>What exactly did Historiafags do that makes you so butthurt? Act the same as any other characterfag here?</br>  <br><br> netherfag <br><br>You mean allahfag?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him but thank you.</br>  <br><br> Yes <br><br> There also more annoying than Ymirfags, at least they give up after posting some shitty tumblr art </br></br></br></br>  <br>What.</br>  <br><br>Yes.</br></br>  <br>Marry me.</br>  <br> There will never be anything this good in the actual series </br>  <br> Annie's nose </br>  <br>Why is Chuugakkou Bert such a miracle?</br>  <br><br> Y-yes <br><br> Also holy shit I forgot what happened to Slutty? </br></br></br></br>  <br>You should just stay in /u/ then.</br>  <br> caring about Wesley </br>  <br><br>I don't b-but did he died or something?</br></br>  <br>Wesley is probably still shitposting here, just without the avatarfagging and soc shit.</br>  <br>He and his twin Dick are back to /co/ now.   Saw one of his drawings in a gravity falls thread once </br>  <br>Someone posted a new pic of him recently.</br>  <br>And yet you call others shitposters.</br>  <br><br>pls no bully</br></br>  <br><br>RIP slutfag literally no one will miss you.</br></br>  <br>What if I bully you  sexually </br>  Levi a shit.  <br><br> That's lewd and inappropriate <br><br> so don't stop </br></br></br></br>  <br>What if he's the Ymirfag/Islamshit everyone's been complaining about?</br>  Apparently the OST tracklist of the live action is this:<br><br>01.

Annie and Historia are european and theyre practically midgets.</br>  <br>The most accurate post ITT.</br>  is ymir a reiss ancestor?  <br>Ymir = the first king</br>  First king wants everyone to be a titan because<br> everyone's having a nice dream <br> everyone gets to live forever <br> peace <br><br>but why did he make a cage for humans?<br> because </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ymir is the first king's hippy cousin that wanted to stay out and daydream all day</br>  <br>He didn't wanted everyone to become titans, he wanted his people to have a place with no wars.</br>  <br>how can you have no wars when you have titan shifters out there?<br><br><br>did he round up all the shifters in the whole entire world and mind raped them all?<br>are BRAMT rebels or people from the other side of the world?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't he just kill all mindless titans?</br>  <br>That was probably MT. I assume MT and first king had one common ancestor, then MT decided to go his own way and Grisha and Ymir are the result of the family line that decided to branch out. MT really is over a hundred years old. Even Grisha is older than what it seemed.</br>  <br>he knows they're all just innocent people that are just having a nice eternal dream</br>  <br> nice <br>Could also be nightmares.</br></br>  <br>Eren was actually having a nice dream in the Trost battle.</br>  <br>In that case it's probably different for every person.</br>  <br><br>True, though Ymir said that she only had nightmares whereas Eren was dreaming of his family. <br><br>The latest chapter made it seem as if they were all inside a nightmare.<br><br>So let's assume that some of the mindless titans do have beautiful, comfy dreams, what if the first king's dream was for humas to live for eternity inside an illusion?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>the smiling titan was also having a nice dream</br></br>  <br>why didn't he want to have one too? <br>why did he take away the chance for everyone else in the walls to have an illusion?<br>sins?<br>why didn't he just kill 'em for sinning?</br></br></br></br>  <br>That moment when your name is Eren your Turkish and you live in japan. Everyone goes oo just like snk!</br>  <br>Must be cool have a turkish slave.</br>  <br> 7 cm taller <br>The coordinate cancer is sapping Eren's life force, he'll die at 170 cm or less while Mikasa keeps developing</br></br>  These threads are shit<br><br>you retards wait for every first of the month to post worthless shit<br><br>Worse than desperate Berserk fans at this point.</br></br></br></br>   Strong prey on the weak <br>Marlo's going to get that serum and be shitEren</br>    <br>it's so ironic that you said worthless</br>  <br>Is this that one game collab?</br>  <br>No its not I'm just retarded to and suck at my own language</br>  <br>not short hair. 0/10</br>  <br>Mike. Nick a shit.</br>  I want to abuse the Bert.  <br>Bert is pure.</br>  <br> how can you have no wars when you have titan shifters out there? <br>Maybe he didn't predict that titan shifters would be used as war machines later on?</br></br>  <br>His emblem is unicorn.<br><br>No point in trying to find 1:1 matches, most OCs are just OCs. Even Shikishima who's meant to be a stand-in for humanity's strongest doesn't really have anything to do with levi as a characters.</br></br></br>  <br> doesn't really have anything to do with levi as a characters <br>Did you watched the movie?</br></br>  <br> tfw King-kun's motivation turns out to be MUH PEACEFUL PARADISE <br>Still shitty if most of the people have to live as starving peasants.</br></br>  <br>Not him, but he already looks extremely out of character.</br>  <br>Because he kissed Mikasa, or because of the other scenes no one didn't saw yet?</br>  <br>He-he is going to be daijobu, right?</br>  <br> He's dying anon </br>  <br>In general. Looks like he's going to be some smug asshole.</br>  <br>So like Levi. Just that he doen't smile, like Levi.</br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br>So tell how do you think he isn't like Levi. Because Levis's an asshole. You can see it by the way he talked to Annie and how he treated Nick and Historia.<br> cravat <br> humanity's strongest <br> name who relates to Mikasa </br></br></br></br>  <br>He isn't acting smug at all. He's just a manlet placeholder with changed personality.</br>  <br>Weren't there character descriptions of the movie cast or something and the only thing Shikishima has in common with Levi is that he's the world's strongest and fujos got mad because he's not cool and aloof anymore?</br>  <br>Haven't seen these.</br>  リリ    At what time dreamfag delivered last month?  <br><br>That is absolutely fucking disgusting.</br></br>   ID:HBWv1IEB <br>Dreamfag's ID on 2ch.</br>  <br>Prolly late, it's 2nd only, we have to wait 2-3 more days anon.</br>  Anyone else HYPE?  <br>You do know that IDs change all the time, right?</br>  <br>I know, browse boards with ID. But sometimes old IDs come back, and this happens often.</br>  <br>6th in nipland</br>  <br>Depends on if he has static or dynamic IP. It's nice to keep the ID in mind, but it doesn't mean that if someone claims to be Dreamfag it's not him.</br>  anons say that Mikasa's kiss scene looked forced.<br>But if the person was Eren instead of the OC character will you still say the kiss scene was forced, or completely ignore the comment you stated.</br>  http://blog.livedoor.jp/isayamahazi<wbr>me/archives/8879656.html<br>Looks like Isayama enjoyed Mad Max</br></wbr>  <br>The kiss was not forced, Mikasa didn't react negatively from it.</br>  <br>Why people overreact about this movie? I found it meh.</br>  <br>I was replying this to the anons that through the kiss scene was forced.</br>  <br>That's because you have mediocre tastes.</br>  <br><br>Mikasa has a frown on her face and you can see that it's Shikishima that pulled her towards him. If that was supposed to be Eren I'd also think that she didn't want the kiss. or that she at least had no intention of kissing whoever's kissing her.</br></br>  <br>Did you seriously claim the live action movie is decent? Did you seriously claim that any live action movie is decent?</br>  <br>It's mad max.</br>  <br>Sounds like you're the one who does if you think this shit movie where everyone is a Nip and replaced is any good.</br>  <br>Do people here really care that much about this</br>  <br>Nevermind then, I suck cocks.</br>  <br>We're talking about Mad Max faggot.</br>  <br>Yeah I misread. Mad max was okay figures Isayama would like it.</br>  <br>What is Old Boy? What is Snowpiercer?</br>  <br>That is Kiko overall face though. And Shikishima don't pull her, her head stay in the same place, he just put his hand behind her head.</br>  <br>Pay closer attention, he not only places his hand on her nape in order to pull her towards him but he also forcefully drew his lips towards hers. You can simply tell that Mikasa was taken by surprise.</br>  <br>You guys sure go autistic for a scene that lasted less than a second.</br>  <br>I don't even care about EM or LM, it's just that LMfags take this scene as confirmation when that's not even the manlet in the first place.</br>  <br> lips open <br> eyes closed <br> doesn't show surprise. </br></br></br>  <br>LM is fucking retarded. It is the definition of forced pairing just because they stand in the same panel together and on top of that they have zero chemistry aside from fighting together as clones. I don't even like Mikasa or the other two involved but EM makes more sense.</br>  <br>No one here is saying anything about comfirmation, only a few fags who says the kiss was forced and fingerpoint.</br>  <br> tumblr <br>Of course, LMfags are tumblrwhales.</br></br>  <br>So why so much insecurity that you feel the need to keep saying it was forced, when it makes much more sense and he's not Levi?<br><br><br>Nice comeback retard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not the one calling it forced. I'm just saying I think LM is retarded but I expect such retardation from people who like Manlet or any of his pairings.</br>  <br>What is with the fujo obsession with anorexic manlet?</br>  I feel really bad for the EMfags. They're not taking this new direction gracefully.  <br>I'm loving all this obnoxiousness from someone who browses tumblr.</br>  <br>Why use the japanese title?</br>  <br> all these LM fanarts of Levi just as tall or taller than Mikasa <br>Kek, is manlet standing on a stool?</br></br>  <br> I don't know what to say, so here's some ad hominem <br>Have you ever been on google images?</br></br>  <br>EH?</br>  <br>That's his titan form after injecting himself with the serum.</br>  <br>I wonder what the fujos see on Levi, and I mean it. Do they really picture him like a tall, slender dude?</br>  Did they reach that cabin yet?  <br>Thanks for fixing the picture anon but he's way shorter than that<br><br>The top of his head should reach her nose at most</br></br></br>  <br>Mikasa is kneeling.</br>  Why do LMfags pretend Shikishima is manlet when it has been made clear he's an OC character whose only common point with Levi is that he's humanity's strongest. If they wanted to have manlet in the movie, they would have, just like they kept EMA and Hanji. I understand you want to validate your ship but Shikishima kissing Mikasa in that movie does'nt equate manlet doing it.  <br>Why are you so defensive? <br> If they wanted to have manlet in the movie, they would have <br>No, they wouldn't have. Can you imagine the shitfest had they named him Levi and kept the kiss scene?</br></br></br>  <br> Shikishichi kissing Mikasa in that movie doesn't equate manlet doing it <br>Not a LMfag, but who cares? They all look the same.</br></br>  Can we all agree that Levi is one of the worst characters?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>You know is bait, anon. The movie is going to be shit but people still are going to watch it because minor irrelevant romantic conflict.</br>  <br> that manlet face <br>Absolutely perfect.</br></br>   reading wiki stats <br> bimbong is 4'9" &amp; 92lbs <br> mfw </br></br>  <br> Comparing the best, most intelligent and most Alpha male poster in this thread with a pathetic Ymirfag who wants to become a woman. <br><br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.

Just a year or two ago she was one of the hottest properties in anime. Now she's doing almost zilch. What happened? It's not because of her age: she's just 25 which is still pretty young. Plus, HanaKana is older than her by almost a year but is a lot more popular.  <br>Some people like those comforting eyes, and her smile is objectively wonderful.</br>  <br> no Tomatsu <br>So that is why she took slutty pictures showing her ass?</br></br>  <br>I agree completely.</br>  <br>After she lost some weight she gets better looking i think<br><br><br>She does Yokai Watch MC, a big shot there, late night anime is nothing</br></br></br></br>  <br>OH LAWD HAVE MERCY!</br>  <br>No idea what she looked like before, but I seriously doubt there was weighed much.</br>  <br>I-is that REALLY Hayamin?! That can't be! It's gotta be a lookalike! Whatever, all that matters is that I have a massive erection right now.</br>  <br>She voices some of my favourite girls but I can't for the life of me get over her fat lips.</br>  <br>She doesn't even look like her.</br>  <br>No, that's just because she's a slut.</br>  <br>No, she is not, that girl is  Asuka Kishi, Hayamin is here you can clearly see the difference</br>  <br>To be honest, the cover really plays on that lookalike thing, while the girl looks quite different in the video. I guess it's intended since it somehow magically appeared right when Saori became a lot more known and popular.</br>  <br> Tomato <br>Gate anime, for one. (She's the imperial Mexican cocktail.)</br></br>  Where's my Hayamin at?<br><br>Aside from CG 2.</br></br>  <br>Akagami no Shirayuki-hime, Castle Town Dandellion and Boruto movie</br>  <br>I remember somebody on 2ch discovered a Maaya Uchida AV but it just turned out to be a lookalike.

I'm also curious of what Sakura/Zouken would be doing while this happens</br>  <br> Shirou's not part of the destruction of the Great Grail. <br>He's not mentioned, that doesn't mean he couldn't be part of it, It would make no sense he's not part of it neither post fate or UBW unless he's dead at that point or something.</br></br>  <br>Does not matter, the details of the dismantling of the Grail are deliberately vague. It is said only that it degenerates into conflict worthy of an holy war for magnitude. Velvet and Rin come first, but then, it become a war between two factions, therefore, others join them. They can invent the rest as they want, as well as add servants summoned in an unconventional way, creating monsters that do nothing but worsen the situation.</br>  <br>This is problematic, I really want at least a spinoff novel of these events, but then again Nasu said he would want to work with the butcher one more time, imagine urobuchi writing some event like that. it could be really catastrophic.<br><br>I mean the plot devices are there<br> Avenger still around <br> Zouken possibly still around <br> Shinji still around <br> Sakura definitely still around, the older you get, more unchangeable you become <br> Caren possibly still around <br> El Melloi II hating japan <br> Adult Rin <br> Shirou already full grown and after suppasing Archer (with his sassy attitude as a plus) <br> Nothing say servants can't be summoned again <br> Even more broken servants can be summoned since the grail is even more broken than the last two wars. <br> Luvia can be either faction depending on her motives <br><br>And if you wanna asspull some Fanfic material to troll the audience<br> El Melloi II own saber clone apprentice coming too. <br> Modred trolling Shirou/Rin summoning via Avalon x Excalibur <br> Apocrypha servant faction system <br>   maybe Zombie Kirei, for the keks <br> Rin getting Cu   She came back when she got older <br><br>Just get a new protagonist and voila. The setting is really rich. You just need a good writer.<br><br>Actually if Case files can be a prequel to the 5th war, why can something like this come out of it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> garden of avalon is shit its just saberwank and merlin is a whiteknight faggot this the reason why BL dont bother do translate it <br>What? Merlin is always described as a pervert and a troll by saber</br></br>  <br>can you fuck off</br>  <br> the reason why BL dont bother do translate it <br><br>Since when do Beast's Lair translate anything? It took them 12 years to get Fate/hollow ataraxia out of the door.</br></br></br>  <br>Best stories are always the ones that are not narrated.</br>  <br>but this one is already partly narrated in a side material. So it qualifies more as an unfinished one.</br>  Now that UBW is finished and HF movie is on the way, Fate route readaptation when  <br>Aren't they still trying to figure out how to adapt HF without messing it up?</br>  <br>that'll depend how many movies it'll get, even then most people only care about the last 3 days of that route, with some stuff from the previous days here and there</br>  Unpopular opinion.<br>I preferred the movie UBW than the TV series.<br><br>50 episodes were absolutely too many and the second part unsatisfactory the film, while cutting a lot of stuff, managed the whole much better than Ufotable.</br></br></br>  <br>They will really rush the first half anyway. It's pacing gonna be even worse than ubw</br>  <br>Managed what better mister Bait?</br>  <br> partly narrated <br><br>Explains, exactly, how much is told of these events, please.</br></br></br>  <br>Takeuchi's chuuni travel diary about visiting the homeland of his waifu</br>  <br>I would buy even Nasu's underwear to see something like this some day.</br>  <br>I dunno, man. The movie had some great music but everything else was a shitshow. Take another look at the Berserker scene with Gilgamesh, especially when he uses Chains of Heaven. So fucking dumb.</br>  <br><br> eating again </br></br>  <br> that pic <br>Smile status<br>Not saved</br></br></br>   that moment of hesitation  <br>Pretty dank.</br>  <br>I'm not even sure if the music really worked that well in hindsight. Watching the movie it just kind of pounds away at you constantly. <br><br>Like, it's trying to constantly force you to be excited to make you not think about how terrible everything else is being handled.</br></br></br>  <br>Takeuchi needs to chill</br>  <br>Shirou, the housewife man, Modred the tomboy, I can dig this</br>  Why is Saber such a best?  <br>Takeuchi is allowed to do anything he wants<br><br> Let Nasu lived with him while he was working on getting their company started <br> Sold a bunch of his collection to help support Nasu <br> Talked Nasu into having maids in the series which resulted in Kohaku and Hisui (prototype of Saber) <br> Talked Nasu into giving Fate another shot after they left a event where they sold Tsukihime <br> Over a decade later they are still best friends <br><br>If he wants to do things with Saber let him do things with Saber.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because even sakura fags and rin fags love her equally</br>  <br>Resistance is futile.</br>  <br>Actually I don't care for her much, she's really overrated.</br>  <br>The probleme of this novels is that rely on Naruto fanbase level who get angry in original details has not been met to perfection, details often ridiculous. (As combat occurs, or some side scene). I dont fucking care. <br><br>The movie contains all the major events necessary to understand the story. The relationship between Shirou and Archer works without the excessive autism of the TV series (which reaches the pedantry during the duel between Archer and Shirou). <br>At the end is a good movie with a good rhythm and heroic atmosphere. <br><br>An adequate synopsis. <br>I personally approached the Novels from the movie and still now that I know the side material I think they did a good job. I especially like how they handle the timing of events.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  S A B E R<br>A<br>B<br>E<br>R</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think she works okay as a mother-like figure to Shirou, like how Nasu was going with her in UBW.</br>  <br>THE CUTEST KING</br>  <br>It sounds like you have the attention span of a 10 year old and shouldn't be watching anything Fate related in the first place.</br>  <br>Are you actually serious? The movie simply does not work from a narrative standpoint. It has none of the rhythm you're talking about. I actually figured out the timeline of events in the movie a little while back. Excuse the copypasta.<br><br>I just rewatched the UBW movie for shits and giggles, and I just realized something. Shirou has the craziest week ever.<br><br>I wanna break this down. Due to the truncated nature of the narrative, stuff happens sooner than in the VN. Everything starts normal, Shirou summons Saber, and then the Berserker fight happens, but the very next morning has Rin moving into his house, then them going to school, finding the boundary field, fighting Rider, going back to the school, seeing it's full of skeletons, and ultimately finding Rider dead and having the boundary field dispersed.<br><br>What has to be just about 24 hours after dealing Berserker- maybe less, Shirou gets hypnotized into coming to the temple and seeing Caster. He then gets lectured and almost killed by Archer. By the time he gets back to the house, wound still on his shoulder from Archer, Caster has nabbed Taiga and Rule Broken Saber.<br><br>This means Shirou had Saber for essentially one day in the movie. I'm serious. That very same night, Caster invades Kirei's church, takes it over, and then Rin and Archer attack her and the betrayal happens. The sun doesn't even come up before Caster gets another servant.<br><br>At this point, it's morning, and they head over the Einzbern Castle, so we're on essentially day 5 of what would happen in the novel, but the rest of the movie plays out like it would if they were on day 14-16, but at most, it all ends on the actual day 7.<br><br>What's funny is that they all act like time has passed, particularly early on, but if you look, it doesn't added up, especially with the nods to continuity they give to past scenes, like Shirou's wounds.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking Mordred.</br>   You will never hold Saber <br>;_;</br>  <br>UBW should've been 18-20 episodes.<br><br>Split cour with 10 episodes would've been perfect. Learn from Prisma Illya.</br></br></br>    <br>It was fine. It really wasn't any slower than Zero.</br>  <br>Did you see the bit with Shirou deflecting Caster's magic with his wooden sword? The new fans have no idea what they've got before they had ufotable take over.</br>  <br>Man there's tons of shit in the movie that just shows DEEN gave no shits.<br><br>Pic related. This is a shot from what should technically be day 4, but Shirou has all his command seals.<br><br>In the UBW route.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i liked the romance, just change some things here and there and its great, love the whole soulmates thing they have going on<br><br>Even the RN replacement of the second eroge scene is the most romantic scene in the entire VN.<br><br> Shirou calling Saber, Arturia... <br> Sword rests in her sheet <br> talking separated by the sliding door <br> kissing under the moonlight <br> sleeping together in the same futon and handholding under the covers <br><br>Fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm looking at it now and see that Shinji happily revealed himself when he wasn't supposed to. I'll continue to find other 'fascinating' content.</br>  <br>Deen and JC staff need to burn down to bankrupt for what they did to typemoon franchises and many others</br>  How is the mana transfer explained in the all ages version?  <br>DOLPHINS</br>  <br> autism <br>Stopped reading there, go back to </br></br>  <br>Gilgamesh can't teleport, can he?</br>  <br>Archer predicts Lancer's next moves and prepares Rho Aias. By the way, he never trash talked Lancer so I have no idea where this is going.</br>  <br>One of the weirdest things is that they, early on, is that Rin moves into Shirou's house. You know, like in the Fate route?<br><br>This doesn't happen at all in the actual UBW route, though, but even if you just go with it from a movie original kind of point of view, it literally serves no purpose. It never adds anything to the plot other than having a SoL scene where Saber, Rin, and Sakura eat while Taiga freaks out.</br></br></br>  <br>You'll also notice that Archer doesn't get hurt by Gae Bolg at all. He just tanks it.</br>  <br>Fucking JC Staff only now got a bit good, but did a lot of BULLSHIT with Index before that.</br>  So, how was the best Arturia fanboy of the Round table? All this knight absolutely in love for their King, and none of them able to dent her armor like a certain Japanese student.  <br> nothing personnel kid </br>    <br> One piece and two piece swimsuit version of SEIBAH <br>TRULY SHIROU IS THE OWNER OF ALL SABERS.</br></br>  <br>She just looks so cuddly and adorable. Oh well, it's okay, as long as someone else who truly loves her gets to hold her, then it's all daijoubu.</br>  <br>Why does a random chinese doujin VN have such nice art.</br>  <br>I would hesitate to call this the highlight of the movie.</br>  <br>You wanna talk about big swords? Bakuya was half-way to Overedge in this shot.<br><br>Keep in mind, this scene is where they put the money.</br></br></br>  <br>This certainly is the highlight: Gilgamesh being a maniac.</br>  <br> You will never make Shirou smile. <br><br><br>I was disappointed that UFO didn't give a take on Gil's crazy face.</br></br></br></br>  I've been thinking about trying to recreate the DEEN movie using scenes from ufotable's UBW. Would it be possible?  <br>Why did the thing on his shoulder disappear? Was that supposed to happen?</br>  <br>So cute... I would like to see Saber playing at Dark souls.</br>  <br>Mostly, actually. One thing thing that I think DEEN did that Ufo didn't was have Shirou walk Sakura home at the beginning of the story.</br>  <br>Shirou has Saber's sword while Gilgamesh is parrying him. For reasons unknown he chose not to use the Gate of Babylon or a mighty powerful shield.</br>  <br>I think so actually. It disappeared in the Ufotable version too. It was to show he was out of mana.</br>  <br>The DEEN version of that fight is just ridiculous compared to Ufotable's. Shirou summons UBW, and proceeds to use it for jackshit.</br>  <br> Gilgamesh: "Impossible!" <br><br>It really is impossible, Shirou shouldn't have this weapon in stock.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't that a catalyst of Heaven's Feel?</br>  <br>Gilgamesh's sword shattered against the weight of Saber's Caliburn that Shirou shouldn't have? Nothing to say here, really.</br>  <br>One of them. You have to get a certain amount of Sakura points</br>  <br>One of them, but DEEN seriously just didn't care.</br>  <br>I think it is. Walking Sakura home and going to visit her before going to work and find Zouken.</br>  <br>Look, there it is! It's Ea!</br>  <br>No hesitation in the movie.</br>  <br>Shirou carefully decides to drop Caliburn to trace on Kanshou and Bakuya: Gan Jiang and Mo Ye. Wonder if he knows what all the swords in the ground are here for? Decoration? Scenery?<br><br><br>Shirou with Caliburn is not a mess to be trifled with, clearly.</br></br></br></br>  I remember the chills I felt when Shirou summoned UBW in the TV series. I laughed when it happened in the movie.  <br> Decoration? Scenery? <br><br>Mostly</br></br></br>  <br>Goddamn, it looks like shit, what the hell?</br>  <br>Gilgamesh tries to catch his arm that flew onto the other side of UBW. Unlike the recent version, Angra Mainyu rips this reality marble apart while Shirou just kinda watches and wonders what to cook for Fuji-nee and Sakura.</br>  The only thing I think the movie did better than the tv series were archer shooting his bow when Saber was fighting Berserker - The hill seems far cooler than the building, not only that but the pan out was really cool too, you could really feel the scale of the shot.  <br>I just remembered there's a Dead End where Shirou jumps in with Gilgamesh for some reason. Shame they didn't animate that here, it certainly would have been an interesting ending for sure.</br>  <br>They got caladbolg's design wrong in the movie.</br>  <br>Everything else was so-so, but at least Sakura got a cameo!</br>  <br>They both fall into the Great Holy Grail there.</br>  Was this picture actually used in latest Type-Moon Ace?<br><br>Damn.</br></br>  <br>I'm talking overall execution, not the nitty gritty details, technically the TV series is the right version since the CG didn't fit the text written, but I feel the movie version was just much cooler.</br>  <br>Well, now I am left here to wonder who this movie was aimed at. I hope it was financially successful for Type-Moon and Studio DEEN, I guess.</br>  <br>What the fuck is this?<br>So that must be where Shirou gets the JACKHAMMER from.</br></br>  <br>TM doesn't recognize it exists. In the interview for the UBW BDs, the TV show is referred to as being the first time it's been adapted.</br>  <br>I don't blame them. This 'movie' and the 2006 TV series are on the same level as J.C staff Tsukihime, surely.</br>  <br>Im under the impression that DEEN realized they were most likely about to lose the franchise and wanted to get 1 more thing out before so they can make some quick money.</br>  will we ever see her smile being protected  <br>What's wrong with the current state of England?</br>    <br>It's not "her" kingdom. Her kingdom has been destroyed and is now just a portion of a all new state. <br>There is nothing wrong with the current state of England, it's just that Arthuria has nothing to do with it.</br></br>  <br>Oh yeah... I forgot about these faggots.</br>  <br>The trigger for HF is that Alzheimer bitch seeing Shirou and remembering he wanted Illya because of his dad.</br>  <br>why would you spend so much time on turning gold into shit?</br>  Should Otokojuku get a new anime?  <br>nah</br>  Absolutely.  <br>Nah, personally the dated animation is what adds to old shounen like this.</br>  <br>What do you mean?</br>  No, it was at its best as a gag series   1 day <br> 1 volume <br><br>Tonight, the journey ends.</br></br></br>  <br>Vol 1: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126090820 <br>Vol 2: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126134576 <br>Vol 3: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126170387 <br>Vol 4: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126210675 <br>Vol 5: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126301935 <br>Vol 6: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126350748 <br>Vol 7: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126350748 <br>Vol 8: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126398685 <br>Vol 8.5: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126439797 <br>Vol 9: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126451940  <br>Vol 10: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126479736  <br>Vol 11: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126492070  <br>Vol 12: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126580717  <br>Vol 13: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126625015  <br>Vol 14: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126669133 <br>Vol 15: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126716477 <br>Vol 16: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126751816  <br>Vol 17: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126782614 <br>Vol 18: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126815333 <br>Vol 19: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126899624 <br>Vol 20: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126941851 <br>Vol 21: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126979074 <br>Vol 22: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126984804 <br>Vol 23: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127026070 <br>Vol 24: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127068709 <br>Vol 25: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127110200  <br>Vol 26: <br>Vol 27: <br>Vol 28: <br>Vol 29: <br>Vol 30: <br>Vol 31: <br>Vol 32: <br>Vol 33.5: </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>                    <br> archive doesn't have page 15 <br> Neither does Batoto nor other manga readers. </br></br>              <br> No 23 or 24 <br>I guess the numbering is just off in this one</br></br>                        <br>This hurts so much, damn it</br>                                  <br><br>Fuck yeah, one of my most favorite moment.</br></br>                <br>Tora x Mayuko OTP<br>This is an indisputable fact.</br></br>                              <br><br><br>Fujita was drawing "JSDF vs monsters" way before it was cool.</br></br></br>                                    <br>A collage with all Hamumen´s rape faces would be quite epic</br>      <br>There goes the stone armor...</br>    <br><br>Was this the thing that allowed him to fly?

The twists we fun, but by the third time it's fairly obvious that it's all a red herring<br><br>It's like people never got used to Kishi after so many years</br></br></br>  <br> red herring <br>That phrase does not mean what you think it means.<br>A red herring is an answer to a plot question that seems plausible at first glance, but when you look deeper into it, it's full of holes. The real answer is something else that's completely sound.<br>This is the opposite: the supposed answer was completely sound and would have explained everything, and the actual answer explained almost nothing at all.</br></br></br></br>   cuckfags mad all around me   In a few hours, the ride will begin once again. Let's see if we make it there.<br><br>Info:<br>  EVOL vs. Genesis OVA will air on tv before LOGOS' first episode, stay tuned <br>  LOGOS first episode will be a 1 hour special just like EVOL's <br>  May'n is singing the OP song Yamaidare Darlin' <br>  Aquarion Shush is a thing and is real <br><br>Character and world info below.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  new zessica  <br>As soon as I'm convinced that I can't spin it that way in my head somehow, I'm dropping it.</br>  Timestop  <br>You know that can't happen  ;_; </br>  This new stream site is giving me cancer the quality is so bad why did cc die.  why the fuck did a demi god lost to mere mongrel?<br>gil could have killed a high schooler with all his noble phantasms. fucking UBW asspull and shirou is suddenly an expert in close combat. fucking PLOT ARMOR</br>  <br>FSN pulls shit like this with every occasion it gets, the story makes no sense at all. I have a hard time remembering an anime with more ridiculous asspulls and irrational characters.</br>  <br>I agree with you. I personally never gave a shit about the power levels so it never really bothered me.</br>  <br> with more ridiculous asspulls <br>Well, the fact that it did so much damage was an asspull, but the sword itself was foreshadowed long before the fight with Berserker.<br> irrational characters <br>They're not really irrational, just really fucking weird at times. And the ones that are really fucking weird are treated as being really fucking weird.</br></br></br></br>  <br> By possessing yourself with a previous self </br>   Berserker is definitely not a simple mad dog. The Heroic Spirit that became Berserker is a master warrior with amazing skills that even after his Mad Enhancement, he still possessed such an extraordinary ability. <br><br> As soon as he lets go, Berserker will butcher everything it sees, and it will not stop until all of its prana is spent. If the battle had continued for much longer, all would have been lost. Kariya would be drained into a dry husk by the worms as he would have been forced to supply more prana – more than his body would ever be able to handle. <br><br> To Kariya, the battle among Servants was truly risky. If he couldn’t endure to his limits and stop Berserker, the only thing that’s waiting for him is his own destruction. <br><br> Berserker has been hit by Rider’s Noble Phantasm. The damage was enormous. Without question, in order for it to fully heal it would take a great amount of time. And prana. The prana Berserker requires to repair its body can only be obtained from the worms in Kariya’s body.   gross </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Thanks mods for deleting the thread but we're back.
