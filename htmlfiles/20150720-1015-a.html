[ So how hard would the post-timeskip version of this crew beat up th current Strawhat crew? Also rociante a dead  Secret Trafalgar D. Water Law a sad thread   <br>Which side is Luffy on ?</br>  Why is Skypeia the most interesting arc?  <br> both<br><br><br>because of the adventure-type feeling and enel</br></br></br> </br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>I don't know, I mostly felt the mystery of the place before they arrive there, and the reveal of it's connection to Jaya afterwards was really cool and fascinating.<br>The rest of the arcs are mostly about power struggles, this was more about discovering stuff.<br>Of course, it escalates into a power struggle, but it also has the religious twist to it, so it feels fresh.</br></br></br>  <br>In that case Strawhats win. Jinbe, Crocodile and Ivankov are the real threat and we only only Jinbe's strength Post TS.</br>  <br>Adventure's are usually about discovering stuff so that's not surprising.</br>  <br>Marineford Croc alone would probably off half of the current crew not even kidding</br>  <br>Alabasta Croc would off half the current crew, no problems.</br>  This is the single most beautiful scene in One Piece.<br>Prove me wrong. You fucking can't.</br>  <br>We're talking about a normal One Piece-esque battle. Which means mostly 1v1s. Jinbe/Crocodile/Ivankov can fight the Monster Trio. Franky can take Daz Bones. Brook is fast enough to deal with Mr. 3. Bon-chan might give someone trouble but Chopper could probably take him. Buggy can be defeated by pretty much anyone but the easiest would be Robin.</br>  <br> BAR <br>Was Law meant to be Doffy's bartender?</br></br>  <br> Shachi's a slut. </br>  <br>Done and done.<br><br>This scene was fucking beautiful.</br></br></br>  <br>Any logia-user would wipe the floor with more than half of the strawhats.<br>For crocodile is different tho, since nami can make it rain and cancel his intangibility. Then they could beat him</br></br>  <br>luffy would fight luffy<br>There's a good chance that Post-timeskip croc coud keep up woth zoro<br>Ivankov would off Sanji<br>Jinbei would rape Franky<br>Daz Bones alone would get the rest of the crew with Mr2 helping him here and there for a bit</br></br></br></br></br>  Luffy vs Luffy = tie<br>Zoro vs Mr 2 = zoro wins<br>Sanji vs Bonclay = Sanji wins<br><br>Now for the other pairings:<br><br>Ivankov, croc, Jimbei win vs anyone they fight.<br><br>Buggy, mr3 and Scissors dude could win or lose.<br><br>So that makes it:<br><br>3 wins Impel down team<br>2 wins SH<br>1 tie<br>3 uncertain.<br><br>Overall I'd say Impel down would win but we never know for sure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I should really re watch Skypiea as a whole someday. Just for that pay off. It was very moving to watch.</br>  <br> There's a good chance <br>Nope. Not even going to go there. If we're going to have a bullshit battle that will never happen, we do it with the facts we know. Besides, a lot of them are rather old, compared to the Strawhats.</br></br>  <br>consider it done, also <br> Sachi and Jean not invited to party with the cool kids </br></br>  <br> Besides, a lot of them are rather old, <br> implying age means anything </br></br>  <br>Why the hell would Zoro fight Mr 2? Thats a dumb suggestion. Do you mean Mr 1?</br>  <br>Mr.1 is Daz Bones, Mr.2 is Bon-chan. <br><br>And why they would fight the weakest members is beyond me. Zoro and Sanji would fight Crocodile/Jinbe/Ivankov. Hell, or even Luffy. And Luffy can fight the other three.</br></br></br>  <br>Yea I mean the sword dude.<br><br>Sanji fights mr 2.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm saying being young is better than being old.</br>  <br><br> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;being so mean to Shachi, and also Jean Bart <br><br>for what purpose???????????????<br><br>There is literally nothing impure about Shachi (or Jean Bart). <br><br> &gt;Select all bread <br>Now even captcha is being impolite.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You are all forgetting one important thing<br> Buggy &gt; Strawhats <br><br><br>Doffy would have raped law one on one and he was twice as old as law is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was. Luffy's dedication to doing that was touching. So was Norland's flashback.</br>  <br>Because Oda matches styles not strength. He just happens to make it so that strength and style are in the same hierarchy.<br><br>but in general zoro fights a swordsman and sanji fights the 2nd strongest melee fighter.<br><br>The swordsman there is Daz Bone. The melee fighter that kicks is bon clay. <br><br>Sanji could fight Ivankov, he probably ended up at almost his level since he trained under him during the timeskip.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They were never in the same to begin with though ? Luffy raped Doffy's ass and I'm well aware of how crippled Doffy was.</br>  <br> &gt;Sanji could fight Ivankov, he probably ended up at almost his level since he trained under him during the timeskip. <br> luffy is as strong as rayleigh <br>no<br><br><br>I was speaking about law mister</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Zoro had no qualms about fighting Monet and destroying Pica. I'm sure he'd have no qualms over fighting Crocodile or Jinbe.</br>  <br> Zoro had no qualms about fighting Monet <br>In what universe ? Because I'm interested in living in it.</br></br>  <br>Yes, I know you were talking about. You gave me one example, I gave you another. <br><br>Also you're implying that the difference between Luffy and the right hand of the bloody Pirate King is the same as the difference between Sanji and Ivankov.</br></br></br>  <br>that's why I say almost. <br><br>Zoro got closer to mihawk<br>Luffy got closer to rayleight.<br>Sanji got closer to Ivankov.<br>Franky got closer to Vegapunk.<br><br>Chopper and brook got better.<br>Robin ???<br><br>Nami and Ussop can now asspull shit at Oda's convenience.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know damn well what I meant. Point is, she wasn't a Swordsman and Zoro raised his sword against her. The fact that he didn't cut her doesn't matter because that's his morality.</br>  <br>Robin definitely got closer to Dragon.</br>  <br> The fact that he didn't cut her doesn't matter because that's his morality <br>Oh, so not cutting her meant he took her seriously ? My bad then.</br></br>  Luffy with the strawhats, otherwise they wouldn't stand a chance.<br><br>Main fight:<br>God Usopp and his 8000 followers &gt; Pirate God Buggy<br><br>Side fights:<br>Luffy &gt; croco-boy<br>Zoro = jimbe (unsure, maybe zoro can pull through)<br>Sanji &gt;= iva-chan (iva gets owned by everyone, sanji sometimes wins)<br>Furanky =&lt; Mr 1 (if mr1 didn't get any better franky wins easily)<br>Brook &gt; bon-bro<br>Choppa &gt;= mr3<br>Inazuma creates the ring. Also we didn't see him/her fight properly so we don't know how strong he/she is.<br> Nami and Robin play with themselves watching god usopp being God </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well with your example you basically proved that I'm right and that age does not matter in the least.</br>  <br>Sorry, when did I use the word ''seriously'' in any of my posts ? He cut her, showing that he's not above hurting girls. Afterwards he absolutely wrecked Monet and made her unable to even stand up straight. I don't know about you but that's a victory in my book.</br>  <br>Wat ? In my example the younger one rapes the older one.</br>  <br> He cut a logia in two without haki, showing that he's not above tickling girls <br>FIFY</br></br>  <br>Look dude, I don't care what your fucking issue is but Monet lost. That's a fact. Monet is not a swordsman. That's also a fact. That's all I'm saying.</br>  <br>yeah and doffy would still rape every other strawhat one on one which further proves that winning has nothing to do with age</br>  <br> Monet lost. That's a fact. Monet is not a swordsman. That's also a fact. <br>That's not even what I was debating about, but okay.</br></br>  <br>Except they're not in the same league. That was my point, I put people against each other, who, imo, would be in the same league. And in that scenario, I would think the Young would win over the Old.</br>  <br>then you should have wrote it like that, because it really seemed like you were saying that age decides who wins which is pretty retarded considering One Piece</br>  <br>Oh god no, I'm not that retarded.That's my bad, I'm sorry. Have this. One old guy hyping up two other old guys.</br>  <br>Seeing as I Vancouver pushed back Again and Kuma his side would auto win. Remove her and Luffys's side wins. Usopp could beat Crocodile.</br>  <br> I Vancouver <br><br><br>Well SOMEone's on their phone</br></br></br></br>  <br> Usopp could beat Crocodile. <br>listen I know that we all love god, but it wasn't serious okay. The god usopp hype was never meant to get out of control like this</br></br>  <br>This entire post.</br>  <br>What</br>  <br> Again and Kuma <br> Again <br><br>Again? Akainu?</br></br></br></br>  I just reread everything from Sabaody to the current chapter.<br><br>What should I reread next?</br></br>  <br>Every thing from Sabaody to the first chapter.</br>  <br>How about the whole fucking thing?<br>One thing I've noticed after rereading one piece is that you notice a lot of stuff you didn't the first time. Always nice to discover something new.</br></br>  <br><br>Nah, I don't feel like going through the Buggy chapters and before. I reread the very beginning just before marathon reading sabadoy+. I think I will reread the Don Krieg arc.</br></br>  <br>what is he reafearing with two legends ? i only remember rayleigh</br>  <br><br>  I Vancouver </br></br>  <br> I Vancouver <br>Anon are you drunk?</br></br>  <br>Whitebeard, ya dingleberry. They were hyping that shit up near Sabaody.</br>  <br>Whitebeard was a legend, you silly</br>  <br>That guy they killed. Some dude with a moustach.</br>  <br><br>Some yellow lion too, sounds weird.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>thanks i though he was talking about two in shabody</br></br></br></br>  <br>oh yeah that roger guy. Wonder what he has to do with anything in the first place</br>    <br>I heared he was pretty rich!</br>  <br>I mean, his first name was Gold. That's a pretty good start.</br>  <br>His name was Gold after all.</br>  <br> There's a good chance that Post-timeskip croc coud keep up woth zoro </br>  <br><br>More.</br></br>  <br>He should have a okay-tier haki after the timeskip, so I think that a logia is a good match for Zoro, because unlike Monet Croc is a fighter.</br>  <br> you fucking can't <br> what did you just call me? </br></br>  BEST<br>E<br>S<br>T</br></br></br>  Why was Condoriano so based?<br>I know it was just filler, but i wish we could see him again.</br>  <br>Post timeskip Luffy vs pre time skip Luffy ( no chest wound in the picture) <br> Post timeskip wins <br>Zoro vs Croc<br> Zoro wins <br>Sanji vs Ivankov <br> Ivankov wins <br>Franky vs Jimbei <br>  Jimbei wins <br>Inazuma vs Brook<br>  Brook wins <br>Mr. 1 vs Robin<br>  Robin wins <br>Chopper vs Bon clay<br>  Chopper wins <br>God Usopp vs Mr. 3 <br>  Usopp <br>Buggy vs Nami<br>  Buggy <br>Over all six to three for Strawhats</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> OP literally says the post-timeskip version of the crew in the picture <br> no chest wound in the picture <br>wow</br></br></br>  <br>the cutest</br>  <br>Shit my bad</br>  <br>How would Robin beat something she could not even touch without being cut? Grow a finger in his trachea to choke him?<br><br> Distract him by creating free to use cum toilets on the wall? </br></br></br>   Shishishisonson <br>what the fuck is that attack name</br>  <br>Looks like you already answered your own question</br>  <br> Mr. 1 vs Robin <br> Robin wins <br>I'd be interested to hear a justification for this one</br></br></br>  <br><br>Lion's Song.</br></br>  <br>Lions can't sing, silly, and if they could we could not understand them anyway.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, unless she has CoA I don't see how.</br></br>  <br> Robin can fly <br> Robin can stomp him until he's underground <br> But Robin's hands can't clutch steel balls <br>I'd say it's a maybe for robin</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah well that's what it means.</br></br>  <br> Inazuma vs Brook <br> &gt; Brook wins <br> Mr. 1 vs Robin <br> &gt; Robin wins <br> Chopper vs Bon clay <br> &gt; Chopper wins <br> God Usopp vs Mr. 3  <br> &gt; Usopp <br>wait now that I look through it, are you drunk?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I hope Zoro gets an actual fight soon that makes him<br><br> break a sweat <br> use actual sword fighting rather than flying slashes <br><br>Seeing how we are going to Wano I have high hopes.<br><br>Him simply cutting Monet in half is the best post timeskip Zoro scene so far.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Chopper vs Bon clay <br> &gt;&gt; Chopper wins <br> &gt;God Usopp vs Mr. 3  <br> &gt;&gt; Usopp <br>These actually make sense. Monster chopper would probably stomp Bon-chan into the ground. And Mr 3. is not much of a fighter anyway, Lysopp would find creative ways around his defenses.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bon Clay would rape monster point just like he raped the animals in impol down and Mr.3 vs. Usopp is really a wild card, I don't think it's easy to decide that one</br>   yfw big mom gets offscreened by Mr.Prince   <br> yfw Sanji stays in dressrosa and becomes the next joker to support luffy's quest to become the pirate king from the shadows </br>    <br><br> not Okama Kenpo </br></br>  <br> Seeing as I Vancouver pushed back Again and Kuma his side would auto win <br>what what was</br></br>  <br> he thinks croc is weak </br>  <br>fuck off</br>  <br> l look at me everyone I cant come up with my own name </br>  I don't think people understand. Bon-chan is as fucking strong as Sanji. <br><br> hurr durr Sanji is a jobber <br>Fuckin' whatever. He's strong as shit and Bon-chan would be just below Sanji.You can't underestimate it.</br></br></br>  <br> look at me I'm unironically a tripfag for literally no reason besides derailing the thread and e-peen </br>  <br> it <br>Him. You can't underestimate him. Bon-chan.</br></br>  <br> liking sanji <br>Name anything good he's done at all in the new world</br></br>  <br><br>Bon-Chan would shit on Sanji.</br></br>  <br>I really can't see anyway of that helping. <br> Can't snap his neck (Or any of his body parts really) <br> Can't lay her hands on his body cos he'd just sprout blades under them <br>On top of that he's far more of a fighter while she's an assassin, and he'd likely have Haki on top of all that. Daz Bones would be a pretty awful matchup for Robin.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off gay poster you're just shit posting</br>  <br> name anything good he's done at all in the new world <br>Stopped doffy from massacring the SHs that were on the sunny<br> b-but he jobbed <br>So did law, so would luffy had he fought a completely healthy doffy.Hell sanji didn't even know shit about doffy's DF.<br><br><br>He also fought vergo, the strongest executive, with a wounded body and managed just fine.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's right though, you're cancer.</br>  Reaction face thread.                  <br>literally some of the best doujins.</br>      Does anyone know what episode this image is from?

Well those are just your opinions and assumptions about a drawing.  Define "bad"  <br>Just like ur mom</br>  <br> and probably smells bad <br>Old man sweat.</br></br>  <br>The picture doesn't help me believe in your words.</br>    The thought of never holding Rin, never stroking my fingers through her hair, never keeping her warm at night, never being scolded by her, and never being hugged by her really makes me sad.  I LOVE RIN<br><br>SHE IS THE BEST</br></br>  <br>She ages like fine wine.</br>  Tohsaka Rhino.  Reminder that Tohsaka Rin, a clown without a shred of natural human kindness, is canonically said to be the worst Japanese in the world.  <br>Can't wait til the rest of the adaption is on BD so I can sit down and watch it.</br>  Post more sleepy Rin  <br>Yeah, something about that pic just makes me think she smells like stale shit</br>  <br>All girls smell like sweat when they wake up, especially if they wear pajamas to bed  especially the 2D ones </br>  <br>That's hot.</br>  <br>Opposite day?</br>  You will never  <br> that light scent of sweat from the night before still clinging to her hair <br> cuddling up to her under the blankets and breathing in her scent <br> her getting embarrassed by it, coyly demanding that you stop <br> following her into the morning shower just to wash her hair for her, gliding your fingers along her scalp <br> washing her body clean so you can enjoy the smell of her fresh skin, too <br> a list of things ill never know <br>Fucking kill me, please.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank god. I can't stand either of them.</br>  I want to smell her feet.  <br>I can't stand never holding either.</br>  Rin is smart, beautiful, and definitely smells like roses.  <br>Shut it Luvia, you only ever tie with Rin; or lose to her. You are comedy relief.</br>  <br>You can smell my ass, it smells the same I promise</br>  TOHSAKA RIN PLEASES OLD MEN FOR MONEY  <br>I very much doubt it.</br>  <br>Go away Luvia<br>Nobody luv ya</br></br>  <br>I want to lick them so badly</br>  <br>That reminds me I need to watch <br>FATE<br>Then I'll shitpost about it.<br>^_^</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have no interest in this series, I just want to do lewd things to Rin, Rider and Casters feet.</br>  <br>Unironically still better than Luvia even if you described Rin completely wrong.</br>  <br>I just come here for the cute pictures.<br>From what I understand, the only shit girl is Sakura. Because she uses worms as dildos and eats whitefish.</br></br>  <br> Rin is flat here <br><br> Rin has a modest chest here. <br>I hate this kind of inconsistency</br></br></br></br>  <br> No OHOHOHOHOHO <br>You're losing it Luvia.</br></br>  <br>it's called perspective</br>    Rin is the best girl in F/SN<br>Unfortunately that doesn't mean much because all the other girls are just shit in general. Rin is just less bad</br>   ITT: Rhino thread   <br>The second one is not from the show or VN.</br>  Why is Rin so much inferior to her sister?<br><br>Is it because the Matous are better at raising children?</br></br>  <br> falling for forced memes <br>Sakura is love.</br></br>  I want to bully Rin until she tears  <br> Sakura is shit <br> forced meme <br>Anon, I have bad some bad news for you.</br></br></br>    <br>just like op</br>    <br>That your shit taste is genuine?</br>  <br>That /a/ hates used goods, no matter if it is her fault or not.

I know because shitposting with something that was retconned from hell and back is something secondaries would do. <br>They have no idea what the fuck they're talking about</br></br>  <br>If only she didn't have those fucking stockings.

Taking RN as the real source, is the same as taking DEEN's fate/stay night as a reliable source. You are just going to be laughed at.</br></br></br>  <br>No. Because RN retconned the eroge you retard. <br>Fate is not a porn game anymore and everyone knows that, the fact that you don't know it shows that you're retarded secondary piece of shit.<br><br> Taking what you say directly <br>What did I say? you're changing what I said.<br><br>I clearly said : Blood was always a method of transferring manga<br>Because you said it changed how the universe works, it's doesn't. Akiha had blood for that reason.<br>Semen is a forced way of having sex scenes and it's not retconned or not valid anymore, they just don't do it because why force sex scenes when you can drink blood?<br>Shinji doesn't rape Sakura in RN. <br><br>Also sending people to /v/ to talk about a game is retarded you dumbfuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If she leglocks you and force you to impregnate her. Will you take responsibility?</br>  <br> Coming inside her is my biggest failure to date <br>topkek</br></br>    <br>Why Deen's Rin so sexy?</br>  <br>Overall better design.</br>  <br>Agility stat doesn't make you that much faster. Fake Assassin had A+ agility and didn't manage to speedblitz Saber, same with Lancelot against both Saber and Gilgamesh. EX Agility wouldn't be much faster than that.</br>      <br>Well, not everyone is immediately fine with possibility of becoming father. And Shirou was also afraid of Rin's reaction once she realise what happened. Good for him, that Rin quickly made clear that she is fine with anything.</br>  <br>Because DEEN &gt; Ufo</br>    <br> EX agility wouldn't be much faster than that <br>EX is fucking OP, there's a huge difference between EX and A.

I don't think Rin was that size.</br>  <br>Yeah, if I remember she should arrive after the next Bazett&amp;Avenger segment.</br>  <br>Did someone say JETS?</br>  <br> shitposting on both Saber <br>That completely invalidates your opinion because that isn't true. <br> Starting waifuwars <br>You make me sick.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128307722 <br> Sakura baitposts <br> maymay <br> caps <br> xDD <br>Kill yourself</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Japanese women are pretty awful, so by those standards she's good.</br>  Best  <br>If we're just going off who has better stats, then Gilgamesh wins because Noble Phantasms are undeniably the most important aspect to a servant, and its not like your Archer can buff up his Noble Phantasm ranking. Hundred Faced Hassan can have EX in every stat, it wouldnt change the fact that Saber, Iskander, and Gilgamesh could all take them out due to their NP's.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128307722 <br>Those are the Sakurafags newfag. Rinfags love Saber unlike you faggots.</br>  <br>I'd disagree.<br>If only because the only non-moonhax-bullshit EX-rank stat we've seen was fucking retardedly powerful.<br>And even that was only because of his NP.</br></br></br>    <br>You can't really compare EX stats though, they're EX because they can be measured. EX can be anywhere from infinity to just barely above A++. For example we know that the Gates of Babylon is a ridiculously overpowered Noble Phantasm, whereas Ionoi Hetaroi is overpowered, it's not nearly as OP as GoB. So you can't say Archer would have the durability of Berserker of Red because we have a set measurement for one, while the other has no measurement.</br>   tfw no rin gf   <br>Remove Luvia</br>  I love Rin!

He even had time to wonder if they were building a new underground mall while they were at it. <br><br> There was a lot he wanted to say, but he only spoke the first phrase that came to mind. <br><br> “Misaaaaka.” <br><br> “B-blame the map!!”  <br>This whole thing feels like some crazy cartoon chase and I fucking love it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  She will win right? She just have to close the gap right?  <br> B-Blame the map!! <br>I swear I've heard this phrase in another show from this season.<br><br><br>Fuck off with your reverse trolling.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She'd have to fucking confess first, and we all know NO ONE in this series has the guts for that. No one will win because every fucking heroine is a fucking coward.<br><br>I don't root for losers who don't even fucking try. She should just cry in a corner somewhere. If she actually grows a spine, maybe I'll reconsider her worth.</br></br></br>  <br>The mummy was to good for this world.</br>  <br> She'd have to fucking confess first, and we all know NO ONE in this series has the guts for that. <br><br>Index</br></br></br>  <br>She has no guts to confess AGAIN.</br>  <br>She already confessed in NT2 and NT3. But Touma too dumb to understand it.</br>  <br>She did it once she can do it again. Index is no coward like Misaka, Index will win the Toumabowl or Othinus will. We all know that for sure.<br><br><br>She never confessed she wanted to share Touma's burden which is ironic since she became the burden.</br></br></br></br>  <br> which is ironic since she became the burden <br>Nice meme!</br></br>  <br>she literally just said it herself.<br><br><br>its not even a meme<br>its the truth she realize</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> she literally just said it herself. <br>"I’m just a high school student!” (c) Kamijou Touma<br>Something like 0/8</br></br></br>  <br> fiamma fucking failed against HP hard <br> touma and misaka are gunning for an open space to deal with this shit <br> they both just rode into a giant chasm <br>well their lives collectively suck right now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Now if only that development would stick with Misaka and not be shrugged off next volume like with what happened with NT3. Instead of following up on sharing the burden, she was saying on what a good woman should be like in NT6 which that development was shrugged off and thrown out next volume. Hell I believed it happened in the same volume cant recall what happened after. <br><br>In fact, what happened with the rings Misaka bought? Pretty sure that they never came up again or even mentioned. I guess its just the golden rule for kamachi to have her character forget any type of development. <br><br>How about some more index? Starting to really miss her be part of the story.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This volume references Aleister's dead daughter, pretty soon they'll reveal Index as her clone. :^)</br>  <br>Don't disappoint me, anon.</br>  <br> yfw Aleister and Laura's daughter looked like Index <br> yfw she dies thanks to magic god shenanigans <br> yfw Aleister turns his back in magic angering Laura <br> yfw not only did she have the Anglican Church hunt him down she preserves their daughter's DNA <br> yfw Laura experiments on creating the perfect clone of their daughter out of spite towards Aleister, continuing this she has her suffer with the inputting of the grimoires and yearly memory erasures because she despises her for her appearance <br> yfw she later releases Index in Academy City as a mocking gesture to Aleister, whom she believes may be the Aleister she once new and love <br> yfw Laura gets her own pawn within Kamisato Kakeru as a counter to Aleister's pawn within Kamijou Touma <br> yfw Raildex's plot originated from a couple who didn't go to marriage counselling </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   “Ah, wait!! It’s dangerous here, so please don’t run! Oh, honestly. If I could see, I could at least teleport over, and…Uiharu! Is the power still not back up!?” <br>But Kuroko is DED.</br>  <br> what happened with the rings Misaka bought? <br>Holy shit, I've completely forgotten about those. What DID happen to those rings? We're never going to see them again, are we?</br></br>  <br>if thats the case laura is a spiteful cunt and seriously needs to get her shit wrecked.</br>  <br> “Misaka, can I make one – just one – incredibly selfish request?” <br><br> “What is it?” <br><br> She urged him on even though she was pretty sure she knew what it was. <br><br> The boy gave the exact answer she had been expecting. <br><br> “I want to save that girl right this instant.” <br><br> She smiled without meaning to. <br><br> It came out of nowhere. He was ignoring their current predicament. The fear of the High Priest had to have permeated his very being, but he still looked away from the approaching mummy. <br><br> However, Mikoto did not need to analyze why she was smiling. <br><br> She simply gathered strength in the arms wrapped around his waist and gave her answer. <br><br> “Don’t worry. I would’ve had to punch you if you hadn’t said that.” <br><br> Nothing more was needed. They did not even need to discuss what they would do.  <br><br>The best.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She simply gathered strength in the arms wrapped around his waist and gave her answer. <br>Very cute. But somehow people will find a way to complain/shitpost about this.</br></br>  Isn't this pretty much the first time Touma and Mikoto have stuck together for an entire volume?  <br>Yes. Unfortunately, it also means that next time we get a Touma-Mikoto team up it will be in NT23. Fruit cola.</br>  <br>Wait js06.exe already finished chapter 2?</br>  <br>yup, and we are mostly through part 3.<br>robots work stupid fast mind you.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, js06 is amazing.</br>    <br>Yeah, and this volume seems pretty fast paced if you discount the misadventures of whatsherface and the liquid diamond.</br>  <br>Laura is probably his other daughter Lola Zaza, and not his lover.</br>  <br> This whole thing feels like some crazy cartoon chase and I fucking love it. <br><br>The next picture thread, someone needs to request Touma and Misaka as Road Runner and High Preist as Wile E. Coyote</br></br></br>  <br> yfw Raildex's plot is just a daughter acting out because daddy has a new daughter </br>  Wow Fiamma jobbed hard.   “Uho hoi”  <br><br>I love this priest.</br></br>   What happened in that instant was extremely simple. <br><br> An acrobike running at full speed collided with the college student holding the liquid diamond’s storage tube. <br><br> It may have been a light bicycle, but it was still moving at over sixty kph. <br><br> The front wheel dug into Kenzan’s side and he really did bend into a shallow V shape. <br><br>Man I'm really liking Touma this volume. Also using High Priest so that he could indirectly save Mie</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What was even the point of bringing Fiamma, only for him to job and to never get mentionned again?  <br>Comedy.</br>  <br>I'd imagine he'll show up again before the end.<br><br>As things currently stand, he's pretty much the only one on Touma's side who's even remotely capable of standing up to a Magic God. The fact that he can't win against one more or less means that no one can. Even Ollerus is shit tier now, thanks to that Fairy Spell.</br></br></br>  <br>fiamma thought he was hot shit for landing a lucky shot on othinus, so this was to cut down his ego some.</br>  <br>Fiamma's ego isn't entirely misplaced. If he can't beat someone, then most likely very few others can. Even nerfed, he's still one of the most powerful characters in the series, barring Magic Gods and Aleister. He's certainly the strongest one on Touma's side.</br>  <br>The new Stiyl</br>  <br>Not like it's the first time a character jobbed like a bitch the moment they got on the protag side.</br>  <br> defeated by a magic god <br> jobbed </br></br>  <br> guts <br>ToumaxGunha Confirmed.</br></br>  Wish this whole chase scene was animated.  <br> animation outsourced to Warner Bros. </br>  <br>  NO ONE in this series has the guts for that. <br>Challenge accepted</br></br>  Thought this volume was gonna be shit but it's actually pretty good so far.   yfw Touma using lethal methods <br> endangered those punks by putting them in High Priest's path <br> Misaka is totally okay with this <br><br>Misaka following Touma even unto his fall confirmed?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mikoto never really cared about thugs, she's been frying them since before she met Touma.</br>  <br><br>She's so callous toward harming thugs that Touma tries to save the thugs when he sees thugs near her.</br></br>  <br> Touma saved the thugs by putting them in High Priest's way instead of Mikoto taking care of them </br>  <br>Looks like someone made a wrong turn.</br>   But he was not the only person who had gotten her heart worked up. <br> There was another. <br><br>Who is it /a/?</br></br></br>  <br>I think you're taking this shit too seriously. Kamachi is trying to have fun with this.</br>   Fiamma got trashed that quickly   <br>Fiamma?</br>  At this point I just cheers for Fiamma trying to be relevant and on Touma side. Can respect him for this.   Chapter 3, part 3 <br><br>Is this like, the worst NT volume by far?</br></br>  <br> the worst NT volume by far? <br>Gr8 b8.<br>Better than 1, 2, 7, 11, 12.</br></br></br>  <br>Not when NT 1 and NT 12 exist.</br>  <br>That's not NT10.</br>  <br>NT10 was most based volume in entire Raildex.</br>   “Ho ho. Are you youngsters having an intimate discussion on methods of murder?”  <br><br>Magic gods was the best thing that happened to this novel. First came NT9 and now we got this.

Anyone got a good representation/illustration of the wind tunnel thing Misaka did on high Priest? Can't imagine it.    <br>He won't, only we readers will know.</br>  <br>Saints are pretty shit.</br>  <br>And tell him that the person who ended the world over a billion times is living inside of a dollhouse at his place?<br>...Did he actually ever get that dollhouse?</br></br>  <br>Well, look where we at now with magic gods. it's not that weird that saints aren't that big of a deal anymore.</br>  <br>Magic god is the new hotness</br>  <br>  this is my friend Adolf Hitler he is gonna to help us to find final solution of our problem </br>  <br>I get it now.

It wasnt just one or two Lethal tactics, he even went through a though-process on how he would act if it was a saint chasing him.

She was always strong. Kamachi just never lets her do anything to prove it. Nothing she's done in NT has come even close to the sheer destructive output she used on AIM Burst way back in 2007. Stiyl would piss his pants.</br>  Season 3 when tho?  <br>Awaki comes to mind</br>  <br>Whenever they feel like it.</br>  <br>Whose this semen demon</br>  <br>demon lord touma when?</br>  <br>When the LNs sales goes down.

Magic will never met science. Never.</br></br>    <br>Fuck it might as well watch the fillers for railgun s that nigga seems hilarious.</br>  <br>You need to be defeated before power up. Misaka is always wins so no reason.</br>  <br>But can you held all of incoming DEEP DARKNESS OF STUDY?</br>  <br>She hasn't been working hard, though. Her whole schtik was 'got there through hard work'. But she hasn't been working hard. She's been writing thousand-page volumes of fantasy about having violent BDSM sex with Touma and becoming his slave. So her training has slacked.</br>  <br>Why work hard when you've reached the top level?</br>  <br>That reminds me of this guy who used grimoires as armor. Was it Birdway enemy? Actually if you think about it Birdway like most hardworking character of raildex.</br>  <br>She needs guts</br>  <br> She's been writing thousand-page volumes of fantasy about having violent BDSM sex with Touma and becoming his slave. <br>No, this is about handholding and cumming inside.</br></br>  <br>Orentz Tryce from Kanzaki SS.</br>  <br>useless</br>  <br>Fiamma btfo.</br>  <br>She probably just thinks that what she did was hard work when in reality it was nothing compared to even the lv zeroes.</br>  <br>Citation needed.</br>  <br>Becoming a level 5 is easy as fuck right?</br>  <br><br>Parameter list.<br>We've seen in this series time and time again that lv has almost nothing to do with personal effort.</br></br></br>  <br> lv has almost nothing to do with personal effort. <br>Parameter list just means that your maximum level is set, doesn't mean hard work is useless. The misaki novel showed that it's not easy to achieve lv5 regardless.</br></br>  <br><br>Unless you have GUTS</br></br>  <br>Its not your maximum level that's set. It's how much effort AC itself is willing to put in.<br>Lv 5 might not be a complete cakewalk as you study up on how to use your powers but progress is entirely in AC's hands. Your mental effort has nothing to do with the physical effects caused by AC messing with your brain.</br></br>  <br> Its not your maximum level that's set. It's how much effort AC itself is willing to put in. <br>I'm pretty sure its both.</br></br>  <br>Nah. The price rises the harder it is to raise your level but in the end it's really how much of a shit AC gives about raising your level. <br>It's basic economics where they weigh the cost of leveling a person vs how much they want a person at that level. If Saten was a lv 3 accelerator you bet your ass she wouldn't be lv 0.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I know.<br><br>I just meant that I think that there is an element of hard limits.<br><br>Using the Saten example, if Ac was willing to spend the money on it, Saten could be a level 3 Aerohand. But no mattter how much they spent, they'd never be able to push her up to level 4.<br><br>There are actually multiple reasons why Leveling up Saten is unviable.<br><br>First would be her low lvl potential.<br><br>Second would be how she'd be a money sink.<br><br>Third is the fact that her power isn't exactly uncommon. <br><br>Heh, Fan girl probably took away all of Satens potential resources.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, Parameter List does include a hard level cap. The resources needed to reach that cap is another story.</br>  <br>I'd have to reread the LN it was presented in just in the off chance my memory of it mutated but to take your example; they totally can take Saten up to lv 4 but they don't want to actually spend the amount of money or time that it would take to begin with(it could even be possibly be more than they have) and they could upgrade Kongou instead.<br>The list is what they CAN do before upgrading becomes what they consider a money sink. The actual current levels are what we get after they allocated resources based on the list. <br> <br>Another line of reasoning is that if it was an actual hard cap then noone would be trying to make accel hit lv 6.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's been implied as early as in Index vol 1 and vol 3 what it takes to be #3. Misaka hasn't been calling herself a monster back then and now without a good reason.</br>  <br>They probably raised based on how usefull to Aleister keikaku you are. I mean, if someone like accel and his vector powers had low lvl potential they just wouldnt give a fuck and spend a shit ton of resources on making him lvl 5.</br>  <br>Everyone in AC calls the lv 5 monsters simply due to the power gap and that's before i accidentally derail by pointing out that the lv fives aren't known for being mentally stable by the adults to begin with. There are tons of perfectly legitimate reasons for Misaka to get used to using the term monster to describe herself unrelated to personal effort.</br>  <br>Misaka, gunha, misaki and pierce are never shown to be unstable though. At least not that I can remember. Well maybe Mikoto gets a bit crazy when touma is around another girl.</br>  <br> pierce </br>  <br> A little <br>Misaka stalked him to RUSSIA in the middle of a world war via hijacking a military jet.<br><br>Misaki is fairly high on the sanity scale now but she also was moments from suicide before Touma ran into her. I think she's a bit more frail than she lets on.<br>I don't know what Gunha is. It's hard to gauge sanity when dealing with a person with the power to do whatever he wants.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aogami is the Observer. Headband girl is just a decoy.</br>  <br>Toppest kek. Parameter list just shows your level-cap. No efforts = No level.</br>  <br>Gunha is insanity itself <br>That guy is not sane</br></br>  <br>If effort was all there was to it then lv 0 would be able to attain lvup on their own. You are trying to attribute mental effort to a psychical alteration done by other people.<br><br>That's the thing. Sure it might seem insane to us to stop gravity via shout but when you can actually do it is it really crazy?</br></br></br>  After re-reading Vol 3, both the fantranslation and YP release, I can surely say that:<br>Regarding SISTERS Arc:<br>Railgun manga = Railgun Anime &gt; Index LN &gt; Index Anime.<br><br>This is the objective truth.</br></br></br></br>  <br>he is as sane as Himegami.<br>both Gemstones</br></br>  <br>Railgun S anime had nice soundtracks in that arc so fuck the manga.</br>  <br>That's the thing.<br>In lots of parts I consider Railgun S adaptation to be the best, but in others it was weaker. So they're about equal.</br></br>  <br><br>Isn't Misaka also kind of sadistic person?</br></br>  <br> stop gravity via shout <br>Gravity does not work that way.</br></br>  When did index turn so shit?<br>I used to really like the novel, but now I can't even force myself to keep reading.<br><br>Something is being done really wrong, Othinious Arc was the last good volume.</br></br></br>  <br>That's the point. Gunha gives no fucks about physics. The bar for what's sane and insnae for him is actually an M. C. Escher painting</br>  <br> talking shit about Fuyukawa </br>  Has Misaka fucked Touma yet?<br>Has Accelspammer returned to save our souls yet?</br>  <br>Its a mix between sadism and being excited that someone is on her Level.<br>Than she can go all out.</br></br>  <br>The Misaki/Mitsuari thing should had settle this debate already<br>If left alone they would naturally cap at level 3 but with AC's help they both had the potential to reach 5, the thing being that the city only had money for one or probably only wanted one Mental Out so they choose to invest in Misaki.</br></br>  <br>No, nothing romantic or sexual will ever happen.<br><br>Nope he did an hero.</br></br></br>  <br> If effort was all there was to it then lv 0 would be able to attain lv up on their own. <br>This is so hard to understand?<br>Parameter List says you can be Level 5 =&gt; Little efforts =&gt; Level 1 =&gt; A lot of efforts =&gt; Level 5<br>Parameter List says you can be Level 5 =&gt; No efforts =&gt; You're a shit<br>Parameter List says you can be Level 0 =&gt; Little efforts =&gt; HURR DURR I DON'T SEE A RESULT =&gt; End of efforts =&gt; You're a shit</br></br></br></br></br>   In fact, to Nayuta, the AIM diffusion field around this guy was rather unstable. Even <br> when he was not doing anything obvious, she still couldn't visualise him in this state. <br> Maybe there was some power obstructing the sighting of the AIM diffusion field. <br>So there is his actuell power and the power which hides his Aim diffusion field.</br></br></br>  <br>On the other hand that filler was 2deep4me</br>  <br> pushing up glasses <br>Was this Nagai retarded on purpose, or did he unironically think that it looked cool? If it's the former, why did he decide to make a mockery of Academy City's darkness?</br></br>  <br> only the cute girl doesn't fixes her glasses <br>;_;</br></br>  <br>Only Accelerator and Kakine are capable of reaching Level 6. The others are growing in a different direction. There is a hard cap. Kamachi himself calls the Parameter List a wall.</br>  <br>More like <br>Parameter List says you can be Level 5 =&gt; do nothing =&gt; Congratulations you are the strongest level 5 Accel! now go and kill this clone<br>Parameter List says you can be Level 5 =&gt; AC shits on you =&gt; Sucks to be you, Takitsubo <br>In fact wasn't Accel supposed to reach level 6 just by chilling out for 200 years or something</br></br></br></br>  <br> just by chilling <br><br>No? If he continued with the current curriculum he'd attain it in 250 years.<br>The "current curriculum" means getting experimented on every single day, testing your shit every single day, and so on.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Parameter List says you can be Level 5 =&gt; do nothing =&gt; Congratulations you are the strongest level 5 Accel! now go and kill this clone <br> Parameter List says you can be Level 5 =&gt; AC shits on you =&gt; Sucks to be you, Takitsubo  <br>I'm tired of your fanfiction.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't the big plan to have Misaka evolve to lvl 6?</br>  <br> why did he decide to make a mockery of Academy City's darkness? <br>I don't know, that scene with Gensei calling study's masterplan a summer project was hilarious</br></br>  <br> stop gravity via shout <br>He never did that. Learn to read properly.</br></br>  <br>No, that was just Gensei's scientific curiosity <br>Accel is the plan, Kakine is the back up</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>I am pretty sure he did it when Kuroko tried to throw him</br>  <br>Thats routine in AC<br>Nothing different to the kind of shit he had to deal with on a daily basis</br></br>  <br>No, he didn't. He shouted and righted himself after being flipped, but nowhere does it say that he stopped gravity. Also, the translation of that SS is iffy.</br>  <br> He shouted and righted himself after being flipped <br>Gravity was probably one of the many forces acting on him that he decided to ignore because of guts</br></br>  <br><br>Until Aleister confirms it himself, that is.</br></br>  <br> Kakine <br>Assumption<br><br> “Academy City has seven Level 5s. However, the predictive calculations of Tree Diagram have established that there is a single one of them &gt;who is capable of reaching the as yet unseen Level 6. The other Level 5s are either growing in a different direction or their bodily balance &gt;would be lost by an increase in dosage.” <br>#1:Reaching Level 6<br>#2:Body balance lost<br>#3:Body balance lost.Did happen.<br>#4:Body balance lost.obvious<br>#5: Dont know<br>#6: Dont know<br>#7:different direction</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure?<br> With a roar of hot-bloodedness, the surroundings started to be affected by the wave. <br> The vibration of the atmosphere echoed throughout, and everyone hurriedly covered <br> their ears even though they knew that it was too late. <br> He didn't even need to use his hands. He just used a shout to prevent himself from <br> falling down. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He was flipped. If he just "ignored" gravity like you said, he wouldn't have been standing on his feet afterwards.<br><br>No, he didn't ignore anything. He simply moved super fast.<br><br><br>No. Kakine is the spare plan (and the only space plan) for a reason. If he isn't even capable of reaching Level 6 then there should be no spare plan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even if he can't he is still the second best option</br>  <br>He cushioned his fall with a shout. Who knows, everything's basically possible with Guts</br>  <br>Agreed. Mikoto is like a bitchy version of Onodera.</br>  <br>He didnt ignore gravity but used his shouting <br>to work against gravity.<br> He just used a shout to prevent himself from <br> falling down. <br>And even that makes as much sense as ignoring gravity.<br>And about kakine being the spare plan.We dont even know if Aleister needs Level 6.<br>and being the spare plan is something that kakine invented because he is Number 2.The official dokuments say accel is the only who can become a stable Level 6.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why do people say that Mikoto and Touma's interactions suck? This volume has been great so far.</br></br>  <br> like a bitchy version of Onodera <br>Just say Chitoge and be done with it, because even the inevitable winner of Nisekoib Owl gets shafted every time.</br></br>  <br>Yes, this volume</br>  <br>Because Kamachi almost never has them interacting beyond the typical violent tsundere antics nearly everyone is tired of.</br>  <br>Spare Plan was first mentioned by Accelerator. Kakine didn't invent shit.<br><br> makes as much sense as ignoring gravity <br>No. "Shouting" to work against gravity and fly is the same concept used by rockets.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't knew rockets were powered by GUTS</br>  <br> Spare Plan was first mentioned by Accelerator <br>Yea again because Accelerator is Number 1<br>and Kakine Number 2.When Number 1 is not anymore<br>Number 2 becomes Number 1.But that doesnt mean Number 2<br>is as qualified Number 2.And again.<br> “Academy City has seven Level 5s. However, the predictive calculations of Tree Diagram have &gt;established that there is a single one of them who is capable of reaching the as yet unseen &gt;Level 6. The other Level 5s are either growing in a different direction or their bodily balance &gt;would be lost by an increase in dosage.” </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except Kosaki could have one day one if she even tried. Now her ship has already sunk so the only thing left for her is the inevitable heartbreak when she finally does confess.</br>  <br>They're powered by guts strong enough to melt steal beams. They lift off by continuously "shouting" at the ground.<br><br>And if you want actual shouting, there's this:<br>http://science.time.com/2014/01/03/<wbr>watch-scientists-suspend-objects-in<wbr>-midair-with-sound-waves/<br><br><br>You have no idea what you're talking about. Both Kakine and Accelerator are qualified. If Kakine wasn't qualified, there would be no spare plan. If the other Level 5s were qualified, they would all be spare plans. Stop taking the vol 3 report in a vacuum.</br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> there would be no spare plan <br>who says there is a spare plan.<br>kakine was as much a spare plan to Accelerator as Mikoto to him.<br>Dont misunderstand me i believe that kakine can reach Level 6 now as much as <br>Accelerator.But originally he couldn´t</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mikoto isn't a spare plan. You have no idea what spare plan means.</br>  <br> Mikoto isn't a spare plan <br>Thats the point.<br> kakine was as much a spare plan to Accelerator as Mikoto to him. <br>I am not realy sure about the spare plan thing.Accelartor also believed if he kills all Sisters he<br>will become Level 6.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't get it. This is what we are talking about:<br><br>Parameter List:<br>Hard Caps:<br> Level 6 <br>Accelerator, Kakine<br> Level 5 <br>the rest, including Rikou and Awaki<br><br>Relative investment needed to reach hard cap:<br> Accelerator (Level 6) <br>Low<br> Kakine (Level 6) <br>High<br> the rest (Level 5) <br>Medium<br> Awaki (Level 5) <br>High<br> Rikou (Level 5) <br>Very high<br><br>Accelerator is the main plan. Kakine is the spare plan. This isn't just something they believed in. This is fact. Aiwass acknowledged Kakine and Accelerator, and none of the others. Aleister needs something beyond Level 6, so they have to at least pass through Level 6 first.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nothing she's done in NT has come even close to the sheer destructive output she used on AIM Burst way back in 2007 <br><br>Except what she just did to HP</br></br></br>  <br> Aiwass acknowledged Kakine and Accelerator, <br>I forget that sorry,</br></br>  <br>And Even with added effect of water the best she got was a saint MIGHT not come out unharmed.</br>  <br> &gt;Kakine (Level 6) <br> High <br> &gt;the rest (Level 5) <br> Medium <br>that does not makes sense.</br></br></br></br></br>  Kakine don't exist atm  <br>He does and he doesn't, volley ball kakine is still alive and beetle is alive. But from what mugino and accel say in NT6 all of them including the one they fought might just be different facets of original kakine's personality.</br>  <br>Raising Kakine to Level 6 is harder than raising any of the lower ranked Level 5s to their current level when starting from scratch.</br>  <br>Best Kakine took his place</br>  Why nobody mentions that Kuroko just revived since who knows how many novels  <br>it was mentioned last thread and nobody cared</br>  <br>Kuroko is a worthless character.</br>  <br>Didn't she have a cameo in NT5 or something already?</br>  <br> Worst Kakine took his place <br>Fixed.</br></br>  <br>She's too busy being the main character of Railgun.</br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>  <br> meme </br>    <br> Fiamma and anyone below Fiamma <br> Relevant </br></br>  <br> Implying Fiamma will ever be relevant again after jobbing this hard <br>Also why is Marian with Dáinsleif so high?</br></br>  <br><br>Read the chart again, current Fiamma is below the line.</br></br>  <br>TEN APOCALYPSES <br>That dagger would kill most people on the draw attempt and if she had not made a barrier any one of those summons would destroy the planet.</br></br>  <br>With that logic shouldn't Toudad be on the same level?</br>  <br>Even La Persona Superiore a Dio would be worthless right now. Wasn't he only barely stronger than an archangel?</br>  <br>Just this volume she is listed on the same level as thor and god's right seat.</br>  <br>Didnt sekrit club think aiwas was shit?</br>  <br> Accelerator <br> Relevant <br>My siderinos.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, my bad.<br><br><br> any one of those summons would destroy the planet. <br>So could Birdway with the Gungnir immitation.<br>And I'm pretty sure 50/50thinus and Ollerus would still be above her.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. But their opinions kind of don't matter when they're busy laughing at how Aleister can't hurt them, and then hurt them.<br>Their sekrit club was also found out easily by Aleister.<br><br>What has the sekrit club even done right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Everybody who isn't in pic related is worthless right now</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>blah blah blah not a who beats who. Well the gods are/were certain they couldn't be beaten and crowley had to make cryptonite to weaken them and from what we have herd noukan's armor is also anti MG tech. the nips list them above aiwass and crowley.<br><br><br>It was a spell they made even his data collecting would have been useless if they didn't make the nerf spell and cast it on themselves first.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sekrit Club also laughed at Aleister and yet they are the ones that got shat on.</br>  <br>They also thought that Aleister couldn't hurt them, so we don't really know.<br><br><br>Well he'll probably reach level 6 one day.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait a minute. Laura and Alister are a couple?</br>  <br>Just speculation, anon.</br>  <br>She needed index's help to do that and that is just one planet buster. Still this isn't who beats who.<br><br>5050 othi is the lose option, based on her thing with ollythor if she fails the spell bounces back on her while still doing its job. As for ollerus, who knows how strong he actually is. On won hand being a half god made othinus magic go to draw mode when it came to him so he technically wasn't her equal, on the other they literally bent space and time when they attacked each other.</br></br></br>  <br> won hand <br>one</br></br>  If Fiamma hadn't gotten caught off guard by Aleister could he have beaten him in a 1 on 1 fight? Just how strong would the Holy Right have become?  <br> So could Birdway with the Gungnir immitation. <br>I'm pretty sure that she would replicate the same thing that Touma witnessed e.g. the destruction of all phases.<br>World doesn't mean planet you know.</br></br></br>  <br>I say yes<br>If Aleister is anything like his real life counterpart the dude is a badass</br></br>  <br>iirc it literally says it can't do anything on par with the original.</br>  <br>If I'm not wrong, that's the most recent, NT10 chart.<br>Where do you think Kihara Doge, gimped Gods and St. Germoney should be placed? And whatever-her-name-was that was mad at Misaki?</br></br>  <br>He wouldn't have bothered to personally go cut the arm if he didn't think it was some serious threat.</br>  <br>I only remember that she (Birdway) actually doesn't know what will happen when she throws the lance, but since both Touma and Othinus witnessed what Gungnir can do, that will be the end result.<br>Then again, it's been a while since NT10 , so I could be wrong.</br></br>  <br>Kihara should be at least between Rensa and the invisible thing, the weakened gods near vanilla Othinus, St Germain was a normal magician so maybe around Stiyl tier and Mitsuari is a lv3 so around Kongou's friends</br>  <br>as the vol goes the more touma loses more of his expressions</br>  <br>Since Crowley hasn't made a lot of moves personally (even if he states he's in control) I would assume that anyone he goes after personally would have to be either an actual big threat or the very real possibility of a big threat.</br>  <br>He is ded inside.</br>  <br>I thought Mitsuari was a level 4? Maybe I missread</br>  <br>aftet nt9 he looks more grumpy and edgy looking with a fluffy hair</br>  <br>http://toarumajutsunoindex.wikia.co<wbr>m/wiki/Mitsuari_Ayu#Abilities</wbr></br>  <br>Worst boy.</br>  I still think Touma's working with a severe amount of hubris and self-importance, even if he isn't like Fiamma with his "glorious one" or the Level 5s with their "I'm a monster" shit. He'd have to have a lot of pride to think he "won't allow something". Whining about how you don't intend to be a hero and just wanna live your life doesn't change the fact you thought you were strong enough to stop a magic god in the first place  So could someone snipe accelerator's head and kill him if he doesn't turn on his chocker?    <br>I've wondered about that too. I assume there's a way around it, considering it hasn't happened.</br>  <br>Yeah.</br>  <br>Touma's only smile in this picture was right before punching his loli imouto.<br>I guess he was really happy that he finally could hit a little girl again.</br></br>  <br>That being said, I think it should theoretically be possible. I still wouldn't try it because if there is a way around it you're fucked</br>  <br>I wanna say yes but he has some insane reflexes <br>I mean he managed to turn on the choker and kick the immortal loli in a fraction of a second</br></br>  <br> Everybody who isn't in pic related is worthless right now <br>I just realized headband girl is there three times</br></br>  <br><br>Can Misaka WORST produce a radar field like Mikoto? Since she's a level 4 unlike the other clones? Or is radar sense only possible with a level 5's power. With Misaka WORST nearby she would be able to intercept the bullet before it hit him if he wasn't paying attention.</br></br>  <br>nah, its just his usual selfishness bullshit</br>  <br> thought you were strong enough to stop a &gt;magic god in the first place <br>he never thoungh that</br></br>  <br>He's pretty vulnerable when i think about it.</br>   http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/<wbr>index.php?title=Toaru_Majutsu_no_In<wbr>dex:NT_Volume13_Chapter_3#Part_7</wbr></wbr> <br><br>HOLY SHIT<br>IT'S HERE<br>BASED JS06</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is she a program like Kamachi.exe?</br>  <br> Worst <br> taking a bullet for him </br></br>  <br>Really funny</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128312920 <br> meme </br>  <br>Pretty sure that post didn't say anything about Worst actually taking the bullet, just cutting it off</br>  <br> le WORST and LO's feelings are fake meme </br>  <br>Ee, zutto.</br>  <br>It is a meme.

It's been ages. </br></br>  <br>I think js06 is trying to be consistent with the time. All translations have come out about the same time every night this week</br>  <br> delusional <br><br>Can't wait for the moment in which Accel dies and the last thing he hears is LO and Worst saying that they never cared about him and declaring their love for Touma.</br></br></br>  <br>Methinks you are the delusional one if you think that is going to happen.</br>  <br>Same reason no one sniped Touma probably, no one deep in the dark side is planning to kill him. The ones that he fought usually weren't preparing for him specifically or had other methods (reverse punch, lolphysics, capacity down, magic backlash etc), and random thugs that go after him don't have access to more than shitty handguns.</br>  <br> Strongest man alive <br> Dying  <br><br>Top kek.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just caught up to the latest part translated. Seriously someone needs to restrain touma and mindwipe him again to stop him from becoming brutal, it would be bad if he became evil or some shit if he snaps at someone.</br>  <br> jokes on you brat I also love Touma </br>  <br>Autism.</br>  <br>He's just baiting.</br>  <br>He's only done two lethal methods and one potentially lethal method. Hell, Mikoto's tried to kill HP more times already and she didn't go through a billion hells.</br>  <br> to stop him from becoming brutal, it would be bad if he became evil or some shit if he snaps at someone <br><br> he doesn't want this </br></br></br>  <br> You will never be Accel <br> You will never wake up to Last Order jumping up and down on your bed <br> You will never be annoyed by WORST but secretly enjoy it <br> You will never walk in on Yomikawa and Yoshikawa in the shower </br></br></br></br>  <br>Every single turn he made was a lethal method</br>  <br>Accelerator has the best harem. Pity he had to   live long enough to see himself become the villain  to get it.</br>  <br>Is Nitrogen Spears considered part of Accel's, or Worst's?</br>  <br>I'd say both, to be honest.</br>  I wonder what happened to that pregnant lady Accel saved in OT  <br> helicopter method <br> metal pole method <br> extinguisher methor <br> acrobike to the head method <br><br>i dont think trying to push HP at the school rooftop is acceptable.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's probably fine</br>  Remind me what's the purpose of this crutch again?  <br>Yes but his plot armour is too thick and if that doesn't instakill him he might just white wings-&gt;put everything back in the way it was.<br><br><br>Don't level zeros regularly have to take tests where they aren't allowed to leave until it's passed and the average time before a level zero lucks into passing the esper test is 8+ hours?<br>It's no wonder that the level zeroes are trying to have leisure time when out of school and even then they still try to study.<br><br> implying Worst isn't part of Touma's. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck forgot pic related.</br>  <br> Seriously someone needs to restrain touma and mindwipe him again to stop him from becoming brutal, it would be bad if he became evil or some shit if he snaps at someone. <br><br><br>No, no should restrain him</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope she wasn't in one of the buildings <br><br><br>walking and jamming signals</br></br></br></br>  <br>To look cool. Also to fuck over people that try to cut him off from the MIsaka Network.</br>  <br>Worst doesn't give a shit about Touma and he invalidates her existence.</br>  <br>He got brutal immediately after the first mindwipe. You can't get rid of it, its as much a part of him as saving people.</br>  <br>Worst is most definitely part of Accel's harem.</br>  <br>I am pretty sure that was Komoe being S and not a regular procedure</br>  <br>Nah. She's afraid of him because the fact that he'll make her heart go doki doki invalidates what she views as her reason for existence.</br>  <br>Worst is not a part of Touma's harem. Worst and Last Order aren't going to betray Accelerator for a guy that doesn't have the time or room in his life to acknowledge them. Get over it</br>  <br>Nice delusion.</br>     Raildex thread isn't garbage <br> I don't believe it. </br>  Is Worst's arm still broken?  <br> metal pole method <br>The what?<br><br> extinguisher methor <br>Again, the what? You mean fire hydrant? All that did was get him wet. Mikoto was the one doing the actual lethal method.<br>Getting covered in concrete could also count as lethal, though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No</br>  <br>Since when has she been an S? If you said she was trying to hard to ensure they had a future it might make sense but i've never gotten an S vibe from her. <br><br> Betray <br>You do realize that the only reason she didn't kill him back in WW3 is because he found her a better target for her hate to go after that required her to leave him alive first right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jinxed it.</br>  <br>It just became garbage.</br>  <br><br> Isn't it only two people griping over what Worst and Touma's relationship is? </br></br>  <br>She is the S of Aogami's M</br>  <br>No it's a few people telling this one guy he's wrong</br>  <br>Doujins fucking when</br>    <br>Nope. it's one guy baiting and a few taking it.</br>  <br>Touche</br>  I know we disagree on many things, but can we at least agree that Agnese is the worst Magic Side girl?  <br>That's not Birdway.</br>  <br>That's not Itsuwa.</br>   Accelcucks in denial <br><br>Top kek.</br></br>  <br><br>I said WORST faggots, not candidates for best.</br></br>  <br>But orsola is the worst, screw that dumb bitch.</br>  <br> Itsuwa <br> worst </br></br>  <br> Touma fags deluded </br>  <br> How to derail a thread: The Post </br>  <br>It's funny because even if what the Accelbaiters are saying is 100% true, it's not like Touma would accept them. Touma doesn't have the time or energy and he wouldn't be okay with taking happiness from someone that made it for themselves. So really they are asking for ignored clones</br>  <br>But Saronia is best.</br>  <br>Nonsense, Laura is.</br>  <br>Nah. I just forgot that Accelfags get enraged at a different opinion than what they have just as easily as misakafags.<br>Then some random guy showed up </br></br>  <br>Touma would accept them before accepting Mikoto anyway.</br>  <br>Maybe but it's a big firm "not going to happen"</br>  Who's the weakest God's right seat member?  <br>Probably the dead one.</br>  <br>The one that's dead.</br>  <br> vent the front <br>kek <br>but jokes aside Terra's powers were shit</br></br></br>  <br><br>Aqua a shit, filthy traitor.</br></br>    <br>Vento.<br><br>Your dog is shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Why are they all so cute</br>  <br>Aqua.<br><br>He let a half dead Touma get the jump on him.</br></br></br>  <br>The one that's a normal magician who got beat by a normal high school boy.</br>  <br>So all of them?</br>  <br>Season 3 when? I want to see terra arc animated already.</br>  <br>Terra is theoretically insane since he can declare himself above magic, but since he can only do one thing at a time he's easily counter able. Vento without her auto knockout on people feeling hostility to her is shit tier and even with it people like Amata can screw her over hard.<br><br>It's a toss up between them but I'd give it to Vento</br></br></br>  <br>goldenface.jpg</br>  <br>Touma didn't defeat Aqua</br>  <br>Because they are living the dream.</br>  <br>Hng damn. I think I'd have a waifu if she'd appear just a bit more.</br>   we might see Touma going crazy after Othinus is kill <br> Touma will literally rip off his right arm to murder the shit out of someone <br><br>What a time to be alive.</br></br></br>  Has any one have nt13 illustration yet ?  <br> Touma rips off his right arm <br> No dragon shit comes out  <br> He's just bleeding a lot and then eventually dies from blood loss </br></br></br>  <br>Based on what almost happens toward the end of NT13,  he'll probably just will his arm to burst into dragons. <br><br>Come to think of it, that means the  Limb Exploder  joke might actually be somewhat legit.</br></br></br>  <br>At level 4 a radar field should be possible. Wasn't it explained somewhere where Mikoto's radar was explained? Basically as a Level 5, Mikoto's radar field was so insane that it wasn't limited by walls and corridors since it incorporated reflections making it practically impossible to surprise her.<br><br>And then Nagai decided that having one guy sneak up on her with a gun made sense.</br></br></br>  <br>Nagai doesn't even know what the fuck he's doing. Mikoto lost to a fucking robot in Nagai space. She's fucking throwing 20 story buildings around and fighting a fucking magic god in NT13.</br>  <br>"Fighting" is a little generous</br>  <br><br>I thought she was split between Hamazura and Touma.<br><br> What a slut </br></br></br></br>  <br>She is fighting him. She's not winning, but she's fighting him.</br>  <br>Still not as retarded as the stungun</br>  <br>NT9 showed up that it doesn't even need to be severed, it started stirring from finger damage.<br><br> Touma will punch someone until his hand his a bloody broken mess <br> dragons pop out <br> he just keeps punching them WITH the dragons until they crawl back inside </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry, she can probably swap out a broken hymen for a new one.</br>  <br>If Touma can block anything with his right hand, why isn't he a level 5?</br>  <br>Neither she nor Touma is actually fighting him. They're just distracting him really</br>  <br>She got better?</br>  <br>Because he is a level 0</br>  <br>When did she get stungunned? The only time I remember was the eyebrow girl, so even Nagai knows that doesn't work on her.<br><br>Did you mean the drug scene?</br></br></br>  <br>Because i could reck his shit in a fight.</br>  <br>That was explained in the very first novel. He has no AIM field and the scientists are too retarded to figure out a way to measure his power.<br>It probably also doesn't help that alister probably wanted him to be a secret for a while.</br></br>  <br>She didn't get stronger, she's just not nerfed by Nagai's autism.<br><br>I'm not trying to argue semantics with you, I'm just pointing out how unbelievably large the difference in opponent between a Magic God and a Nagai robot is.</br></br></br>  <br> He has no AIM field <br>Didn't one of the SS's say that he had one and it was weirdly powerful or something?<br><br>Also rensa revealed that some scientists did figure out he had that power, they just didn't care much.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And I'm just pointing out how stupid it is to claim she's fighting a magic god. If you leave that out your first sentence about "tossing" (holding) around buildings would have worked just fine as a comparison for Nagaispace and nonNagaispace. Adding that suddenly makes her sound ridiculous when reasonably anyone could be "fighting" a magic god with the way he's acting right now, Tsuchimikado could be "fighting" a magic god</br>  Is Mikoto arrogant? Does she count LVL 0's as a shit?  Is this like the Buu arc of Dragonball Z?  <br>I mussed have missed that SS or forgotten. Either that or they simply lied to Touma because as far as he knows he has no AIM field due to his own power negating it.</br>  <br>But they are, besides a select few.</br>  <br>Nah, this is actually good.</br>  <br>She thinks low level espers (and especially lv 0) are lazy shits that aren't trying since if they did they could be lv 5 like her.</br>  <br>Ok buddy, whatever you say. Still, Mikoto is "distracting" and "blocking attacks" from a "Magic God" and she can control hundreds of Five_Overs, fight entire armies, intercept missiles, fight saints, etc. And Nagai has her struggle with small groups of shitty bots that shouldn't even be able to get within 100 ft of her.</br>  <br>probably the invisible being possessing him and going on rampage.</br>  <br> because as far as he knows he has no AIM field <br>Where does he state that then? I don't remember.<br><br>I believe they talk about his field in fanfare.</br></br></br></br>  How is anyone a burden to Touma when he is just a shitty human with an arm that has a special ability? <br><br>Wouldn't any help actually help him?</br></br>  <br>Anon please, he is a normal highschool student.</br>  <br> fight saints </br>  <br>It's confirmed, stay mad.</br>  <br>I don't actually remember Touma being in fanfare at all, are you thinking of Gunha?</br>  <br>Touma knows his shit<br><br>His been doing it for years and years in the nt9 hell.</br></br></br>  <br>Someone needs to beat the shit out of him and put him back in place.</br>  <br> Wouldn't any help actually help him? <br><br> strongly implying anybody legitimately gives a shit about him other then finding a way to exploit the bullshit that is IB. </br></br></br>  <br> Also rensa revealed that some scientists did figure out he had that power, they just didn't care much. <br>Kind of.<br><br>The data base was saying he has no powers or AIM field to speak of, but Comments had been left that he could negate things.<br><br>Rensa immediately dismissed them as lies.<br><br>Its a case of the equipment saying one thing and rumors sayong another.<br><br> Didn't one of the SS's say that he had one and it was weirdly powerful or something? <br><br>Are you thinking of Gunha?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br>This. I don't care if Touma pulls a fag win in the very end just as long as he gets his ass kicked hard</br>  <br>It's Saronia.<br>Or did you forget how she had Touma cornered and fucked up so hard?</br></br>  <br>Yeah, because NT9 and NT10 wasn't enough, right?</br>  <br>He lost just last volume though?</br>  <br><br>Oh yes, it was gunha the chick in fanfare was talking about.<br>Checking the rensa novel now to see what she said about touma's aim.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope, it really wasn't. NT9 wasn't his fault but he got off way too easy for NT10</br>  <br>It's confirmed that Brunhild wasn't even using magic or fighting seriously while Mikoto was only defending, and any minor distraction would have got Mikoto splattered on the ground.</br>  <br>also<br> throwing building instead of magical attacks <br> blocking magic god moves </br></br></br>  <br> Kamijou Touma’s power was Imagine Breaker. <br><br> According to the System Scan results recorded in the Bank, he was a true Level 0. But unlike normal Level 0s, the precision equipment had truly not been able to detect anything. <br><br> However, a comment had been added saying there were reports of him being able to negate other powers. The odds were high that the information given in the comments field was based on false rumors he himself had spread to make himself sound more intimidating. Normally, she would have simply ignored it. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kazakiri said that if He had AIM she could not exist it was near the end of her arc.</br>  <br> but he got off way too easy for NT10 <br> implying that getting beaten into a bloody pulp wasn't enough <br><br>I get that you are one of those anons that read Index only because you like Touma suffer, but come on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That was a shit fight.</br>  <br>It's as they said. Magic side trails him by tracking the negated mana track left by him. It's more or less the same with science side and aim. Hell, he could possibly negate Kazakiri, the personificated AIM field.</br>  <br>Sure, it's confirmed that any Saint who fights her only with a huge hunk of metal on a field she's pre-prepared with iron sand and given knowledge of by Thor Mikoto can not instantly job to. Others not so much</br>  Monster Musume? Papi Thread?  <br>I need to redo the "shit taste" copypasta I made last thread because this is the sort of shit you horsefuckers do.</br>  <br> What a cuck. <br>a doodle doo</br></br>  What would your ideal date with your waifu be like /a/?  <br>In one of the monster girl doujins, it's shown that a male human can satisfy a centaur of he hits her G-Spot and treats her gently.<br>In fact, horse dick are actually LESS pleasurable because they don't have any technique, they just pound her until they cum 'cause they only care about impregnation.</br></br>  <br>I am a pretty boring person so I would probably just do whatever she was up to.<br>Considering she's mainly waiting for me to die I don't think it would be that easy. <br>Does she even eat?

But who is actually the mother and sister  I'd do it just for the money.  <br> Not wanting to love Wakaba and make her your gyaru <br>Come on anon.</br></br>  <br>She's too precious to not marry.

It honestly pains me to see Wakaba lose her purity. It was funny seeing her confuse "galgame" with "gyarugame" and then seeing her buy it in her misguided attempt to become gyaru, but it's sad. She gets to high school and becomes corrupted? Honestly, fuck Nao, that fujoshi piece of shit, I hope she gets hit by a truck. Why the fuck does she feel the need to spread her disgusting sickness to a beautiful flower like Wakaba?  <br>I'd do it for free.</br>  <br><br>I love the OP and this anime in general.<br><br>It's really fun.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Ok, sure.</br>  Who are these faceless men playing jump rope with Moe-tan?  <br>The anime should have ended there, with Wakaba's mom transferring her out of the school due to fear of her mixing with bad friends.</br>  <br>Instead of ending, why not just a show about Wakaba + her mom and sister?</br>  <br>I think the only kind of person who would spend hours of their time stealing and editing chinese cartoons are the ones who like to feel recognized and special. Hence they prefer manga with protagonists who have special powers or something so that they can self-insert, rather than cute sol. It's also why we keep getting escalator drama and credit pages and stuff.</br>  I want this.  <br> wishing terrible thing on schoolgirls <br>Wakaba would be appalled. Also she is just getting a bit of real life exposure, it's to be expected.</br></br>  <br>no, fuck you. She's not being exposed to "real life" she being exposed to the seedy, disgusting underbelly of real life and it's equally appaling subcultures.<br><br>She should be leaning about history, tea ceremonies, and equestrian matters, not BL porn games and disgusting gyaru whores.</br></br></br>  Mao &gt; Wakaba &gt; Moe &gt; Fujoshi  <br><br> Mao &gt; Wakaba <br><br>Wakaba is the greatest.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I should be dull to it by now, but i still get a tingle whenever I see a poster so low-functioning autistic.</br>  <br>Mao is cutest and lewdest.</br>  <br><br>Nopan?</br></br>  <br>What if  they were joking? </br>    <br>What if  you're the autist? </br>  So how long until the compensated dating episode? It's a very important part in the life of the gyaru after all, Wakaba won't enjoy her highschool life to the fullest without it. Mao can introduce her to her clients, I bet Moe has one or two for sharing too.  <br> If a person possesses any tolerable amount of common sense and experience, his own mode of laying out his existence is the best, not because it is the best in itself, but because it is his own mode. </br>  It's hard to explain, but I've never felt the way I do about Wakaba with any anime girl before in my life. <br><br>I just feel like I want to love her and protect her for the rest of my life and I never ever want to be without my darling Wakaba-chan. <br><br>I can't be the only one who feels like this right? <br><br>Who /killingthemselvesafterwakabagirlfi<wbr>nishes/ here?</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The fujoshi probably gets the really weird customers. The fat old men that like to have their stinky unwashed dicks stepped on and kicked while she calls them trash. And the ones that like it when she ignores them and plays her otome dating sims while they fuck her and try and fail to get her to moan.</br>  <br>Have you watched Hyouka? The main heroine is a lot like her.</br>  <br>Please leave Pin Pon playing on repeat when you an hero</br>  <br>What? they're not at all alike when it comes to personality.</br>  <br/>  <br>I'd do it too, gladly.<br><br>B-but only if it's direct to my mouth.</br></br></br>  <br> KyoAni shit </br>  Mao a shit.

I really want to hear this one.</br>  Serial killer Wakaba.  <br><br><br>R-rused<br><br> I was sure the subs messed it up somewhere, though. </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>are you serious? it's a classic japs purnouncing "L"s as 'R's joke. <br><br>Gal sounds like Garu, which sounds like Gyaru<br>Galgames are dating sims and shit like that<br>she heard two dudes talking about it and heard 'Gyarugame" instead<br><br>I don't understand how you could think it was translation fuck up when they go so in-depth into the joke</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ギャルゲ<br>ギャル<br><br><br>They're identical. "Gyaru" is just romanji for "gal". The whole joke should really be about "galge" and "gals".</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The mother is flat and has bright hair while the daughters has dark hair while the onee-chan has big breasts<br>Meaning that he is a hambeast</br></br>  <br><br>I understood the joke. I'm not seeing how translating the two guy's conversation about galge into gyarugame is an acceptable translation.</br></br>  <br>Wakaba is pretty stacked herself.</br>  <br>If "Gyaru" is acceptable romanisation for ギャル, then Gyaru-game is an acceptable translation for ギャルゲ.<br><br>The issue here is that Japan took the word "gal" and used it for both a subtype of trendy girls who slut it up, and as shorthand for girl, which means it's not translatable because there's no English equivalent.<br><br>They couldn't have really done anything with the translation, sometimes you just have to use your ears.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> seeing how translating the two guy's conversation about galge into gyarugame is an acceptable translation. <br><br>are you honestly being retarded? the translation plays no fucking part in the joke. They said Gal, she heard gyaru, that's why she bought the game.<br><br>can you no get that? the joke is the same in japanese and english.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would become a better person for Wakaba-chan.</br>  <br>The joke doesn't work in English because "gal" isn't pronounced "gyaru".</br>  <br>but that's how it's pronounced</br>  <br>I suppose. Why not just use "galge" for the dialogue using it correctly and "gyaru game" for what wakaba thinks is being said? <br>A google search for galge, gyaruge, and gyarugame shows that galge appears an established translation of ギャルゲ, while gyaru game doesn't really seem to have a meaning. In my opinion that would've worked better.</br></br>    <br>Say the phrase "one of the gals". Then say "gyaru". If you think they sound anything alike, you're fucking deaf or have a severe speech impediment.<br><br><br>Then you're expecting plebs to know that -ge is shorthand for game.</br></br></br></br>  <br>ギャル is how they pronounce Gal.</br>  <br><br>I'm convinced you're trolling at this point, no one on /a/ can be this fucking dumb</br></br>  <br> this is a stick up, hand over the register </br>  <br>Which is why I'm talking in terms of English, genius. These are subtitles.</br>  <br> hand over all ice cream </br>  <br> Then you're expecting plebs to know that -ge is shorthand for game. <br>I doubt they know what a gyaru is either, but a simple google search reveals the definition of both galge and gyaru. CR already assumes the viewer knows what a gyaru is, so galge wouldn't be out of the question.</br></br>  <br> CR already assumes the viewer knows what a gyaru is <br>The point is that CR is lazy, and a large part of their userbase will be people that don't know these terms.<br>The whole point of the translation is letting the viewer understand what he's watching, forcing them to google things so they can understand what they're watching is the worst thing you can do.</br></br></br>  <br>The entire gag this episode relys on 3 points. Knowledge of galges, knowledge of gyarus, and understanding that gal=gyaru because nips can't talk right.<br><br>Without heavy rewrites, you can't really make something like this EOP friendly.</br></br></br>  <br> Implying you have an educated concept of what autism was meant to be. <br> Not having fully grasped that. <br> You actually being a tool for using that buzzword like every other basic bitch. <br><br>Yeah, we're done here.</br></br></br></br></br>  I want to love and protect this creature and save her from any further corruption from Blue. Is this what having a daughteru feel like?  <br>I think so, I feel it too. <br><br>Though I wouldn't mind marrying her once she gets older TBH</br></br></br>   see screencaps <br> looks fun <br> torrent it <br> it's a short </br></br></br>  <br>For fucks sake, it's a single-volume manga that is finished. There are only a few choices they had in adapting this, a short batch of normal-length OVAs, the approach being used now (short episodes), or 12 full-length episodes packed with boring filler (ala A-Channel).<br><br>Besides, the light-hearted sketch comedy approach is well-suited to shorter episodes. That's why Umaru episodes are way too long.</br></br></br>  <br>Is there something wrong with short anime?</br>  <br>there isnt enough source material. Its kind of the same with Kinmosa now, after 2 Seasons they burned up most of the available stuff and need to wait for new stories to even begin S3 <br>Wakaba Girl has only 1 manga or something</br></br>  <br><br>B/a/bies are obsessed with 23+ minutes anime.</br></br>  <br>Why was it canceled after one volume?</br>  <br>There are some manga that are only meant to run for one or two tankoubon volumes.

That's unusual to be drawing two series at the same time.<br>I wonder which of the two series was the one she showed to Hobunsha to get hired?</br></br>  <br>I'm presenting the worst case scenario, otherwise nobody would even reply.</br>    Mao a shit  How gay this show?  Moe-tan is so fluffy.  I don't understand if some of you guys seriously dislike Mao.  <br>Not at all.</br>      The wait for more Wakaba every week is agonizing.  <br>Very surprisingly, since this is the same person who did Kinmoza.</br>      <br>There is literally nothing gay in KinMoza</br>  <br> nothing <br>Yeah, sure. You keep believing that.</br></br>  Have you ever played analog games, /a/?  <br><br>Wakaba trading card game when?</br></br>  <br>Moe maids are the best.</br>  <br>What was she thinking?</br>  <br>I bet kids these days play cards over mobile phone apps.</br>  <br>Sure thing.</br>  <br>Ayaya is pure</br>  <br>Straight</br>    <br>It's funny hoy everyone puts Ayaya as an example of gayness in Kinmosa when Shino and Alice were more obsessive  and annoying </br>  <br>Ayayas relationship with Yoko is more fun to post about. Alice and shion are like a married couple who are honest about their feelings. Ayaya and yoko are spilling spagetthi left and right together, omoshiroi.</br>  <br><br>This girl is fucking cute.</br></br>  <br> you will never melt into a moeblob <br>Why live?</br></br>      <br>But she is rotten.</br>  <br> 50% </br>  <br> upscaling the chroma </br>  <br> cr and funi aren't the same thing <br><br>L M A O<br>M<br>A<br>O</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One has hardsubs and fucks with colors, so taking screenshots of backgrounds is annoying.</br>  Which Wakaba would you walk home gently?  <br>Wakaba. Long skirts are best skirts.</br>  <br><br>This, she's so cute and I love how she's taller than all the other girls and has a much longer skirt.</br></br>  <br>Learn to read Japanese already you fucking pleb and stop expecting the rest of the world to cater to your mediocrity.</br>  <br>But anon there are lots of cute rotten girls, is not mutually exclusive.</br>  <br>Wait, you're getting upset about credit pages? Just how fucking entitled are you? If someone is willing to spend all the hours shitting around scanlating something out of their time and pocket, they are free to put whatever the fuck want up for a credits page. <br><br><br>Jesus fucking christ you cunts are like spoiled children.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't remember Oguie looking that fucking ugly in Genshiken, I swear the artstyle was never that bad.</br></br>  <br>They may be cute but they want to see you having gay sex.</br>  <br><br>If the girl was going to watch and masturbate I'd fuck another cute boy.</br></br>  Moe~  <br>Actually responding to that bait...</br>  <br>Why is she screaming?</br>  <br>She saw Wakaba's  girly dick </br>  <br><br>Wakaba's sister.</br></br>  <br><br>HS is correcting the colors now.</br></br>  as long as she gets a fat inheritance i don't care how dumb she is<br><br>i want to be rich</br></br>  <br>Mao please leave Wakaba alone.</br>  <br>Fuck off, Trace Adkins.</br>  <br> marrying Wakaba just for her money <br>You sicken me.</br></br>  I thought I'd start watching Wakaba as a makeshift to help with the waiting struggle between KinMosa S2 and Gochuumon S2 but I was positively surprised. It would be perfect if it had full length episodes, I'm already enjoying it as much as I enjoyed KinMosa now.  <br>the money is just the plus, i would rly have her tipe by fiance...</br>  <br>Be glad it's not Teekyuu tier short</br>  <br>Autistic children would be fine of they were all cute, autistic 2d girls.</br>  <br>No shit, you don't send your kids to school if you're afraid of them being corrupted.</br>  <br>If it was as fast as Teekyuu I wouldn't mind.</br>  I would marry Wakaba for her money<br>In time she might grow on me.</br>  <br>There's no need to use the interrogation signs when you say "desu ka", it literally means you are asking a question.</br>  <br>This reminds me of FOE for some reason.</br>  Way to fucking ruin the entire sketch, CR. Next time, differentiate between gal and gyaru in the subs, so the EOPs don't miss out on the fucking joke.  <br>Yeah.<br>Of all episode for Mori to leave on.</br></br>  <br>Going to be painful without Wakako-zake too.</br>   You'll never experience this.   <br>Thank god for that; ghosts scare me.</br>  I want to use her chest as a cushion.  <br>boo</br>   You will never experience a ghost blowjob <br><br>Why even live?</br></br>  What comes next?

She very much wanted to tap that but he said no.</br></br>  <br>incest is bad m'kay?</br>  <br>He doesn't want children with 11 toes.

He probably realizes that since their father knows about how they're actually related that it would only cause trouble. Besides, Serpico still cares for her deeply, he just wouldn't put his dick in her. And can you really blame him? Bitch is crazy.</br>  Wait, I thought Berserk getting updates was just us memeing again.<br><br>It's really happening is it? I guess after all this time of little to no updates I've become jaded that I can't even summon any excitement for it anymore.</br></br>  What if the next chapter is the boat sinking and nobody can do anything about it?  <br>We're getting a 100 page chapter in a little more than a week and it will continue from there with monthly updates.</br>  <br>He's always aware of how Farnese looks at Guts...it hurts him.

Witches and wizards also train there, while Schierke speaks of elves that can predict the future. All of Griffith's apostle army were focused on fighting Ganishka anyway, even if they were told to burn down Elfhelm they'd probably take the time to shipwreck the jRPG party in the process.<br><br>tl;dr - Anons are retarded to think that the island is just some sitting duck for demons.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't the moon child Guts and Caska's son?</br>  <br>No, he might be either:<br> Griffith's son <br>or<br> A guide sent by The Elf King. </br></br></br></br>  <br>That is also possible. I like to go both ways by speculating that the Elf King gives the soul of Guts and Casca's child a blessed body during nights of the full moon in order to steer the former on the right path. Whatever it may be, the child certainly has no demonic aura, which Griffith cannot help but give off.<br><br> Why do some anons spell her name as Caska? Do you drink alcohol from her? </br></br></br>  <br>It was as its best between 14 and 19.</br>  <br> it's those dastardly Hawk scans, i get it mixed some sometimes as well </br>  <br>Casca is what we call Easter here, and it's the exact same pronunciation as well.

Too bad Griffith only wants a meal ticket.</br>  <br>I'm calling it, Casca will become Griffith's only weakness.<br>Oh the irony.</br></br>  This was one of the best fucking pages ever made in manga. Damn miura, DAMN yu.  <br> Casca must die for Guts to defeat Griffith <br> Guts insists on finding another way <br> Casca sacrifices herself <br><br>nothing would prepare me for this</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why are her arms trying to hug him? is she enjoying it?</br>  <br>Kamiyan should voice him.</br>  <br>Of course. She even kissed him back.<br>Griffith became an expert at it after all. Add to that the fact she's always been madly in love with him.<br>I think part of why she's so fucked up now is because she enjoyed the rape in front of her lover. She became the bitch she always knew she were.<br>The shame and disgust was too much for anyone to handle.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Literally copypasta from the 3-Gatsu Lion spread tribute <br><br>Lazy faggot.</br></br></br>  <br> She became the bitch she always knew she were. <br>You're taking this a little far. Why do you hate Casca so much?</br></br>  <br>She always knew it mang</br>  <br>I think that anon was trying to insinuate that Casca would cause Griffith to hesitate if he were about to land the killing blow on Guts during the final battle, which would allow Guts to finish him off once and for all.<br><br>Then they have sex over his dead body.<br><br><br>It's just bait. People have been raging over the rape for decades. Even I, the honorable Cascafag, had the same problem, but then I had the best fap in ages to it and saw the light. Now I just tell people that Casca can give you more orgasms than the average hentai, but don't go fapping to webm related.<br><br> b-but Cascafag, that doesn't sound right <br><br>It doesn't really matter if she enjoyed it or not. If she did, then I wouldn't really blame her for it, wise magical rape raven and all that. If she didn't, then Femto can give the Rapeman a run for his money. We should just want what's best for her at this point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking Guts... He is literally perfect in every way.</br>  <br>Casca would never attack Griffith though. She'd probably kill herself if he dies because of her.</br>  <br>Why does Casca look whiter in the movies than in the manga?</br>  <br> Caska <br><br>le trashman face</br></br></br>   trying to stream Golden Age Arc 3 <br> can't go full screen <br><br>HELP</br></br></br>  <br>Post the rest</br>  <br>Now, here's the thing people take too far - Casca's worship of Griffith. They all say she'll return to him or attempt to justify the Hawks' sacrifice, but she recognizes Griffith's betrayal during the Eclipse and asks him (obviously with no response) if this was "the nightmare you wanted". When most of Casca's plot during the Golden Age was her trying to accept herself as more than just a pawn under Griffith's thumb, it'd be kinda boring for her to to take a step back. I'd prefer for her to come to terms with the reality of her situation, connect with the rest of the group and attempt to talk Guts out of his suicide mission against Griffith. Obviously it won't work, but with Griffith and Charlotte having tea parties in Falconia they could also take some time out to recuperate and train for the fight back.<br>Making progress, moving forward, growing stronger, these would be good things for her character. Even if she did want to come back, it's too far, she doesn't know where he is, and the amount of Apostles around Falconia would result in her dying instantly.<br><br><br>Because Studio 4c are hacks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First you should  kill yourself </br>    <br>Did you miss the part where she literally prefers Griffith over Guts and her desire to change went to hell because Griffith is all she's ever lived for?</br>  <br>http://kissanime.com/Anime/Berserk-<wbr>The-Golden-Age-Arc-III-The-Advent-D<wbr>ub here you go anon</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>I feel like Red Saber and Wyald would get n pretty well.</br>    I wish there were Mongolian Nomads in Berserk. <br><br>I like to see how Guts can fight off horse archers.</br></br>    <br> Making progress, moving forward, growing stronger, these would be good things for her character. Even if she did want to come back, it's too far, she doesn't know where he is, and the amount of Apostles around Falconia would result in her dying instantly. <br> Casca nad Guts fighting together again <br>I need this to happpen</br></br></br>  <br>That was a textbook bros before hoes situation. You'd have to be a major cunt to run off with your lover when the guy who brought you up from nothing is a few bits of skin away from being a spooky skeleton. However, now Griffith is back to full power, he doesn't need her anymore, and Guts and Casca have now unknowingly fulfilled their promise of running away together.<br><br>tl;dr: lrn2plot</br></br></br>    <br>post this one</br>  <br>Did you forget the part where Casca called Griffith her dream and she still couldn't her over her jealousy despite having Guts?</br>    Reminder that Miss Luca is best girl  aight imma find that page  <br>You mean the part that's being dumped now? The one with the shitty Hawk scans? I think it's very realistic for her to not immediately "get over" Griffith, and courageous to admit these feelings to Guts. A part of Casca will always love Griffith, but that doesn't wash out her love for Guts. The two of them are equals.<br><br> no more nitpicking pls <br><br><br>Luca is a woman, not a girl. Show more respect.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>No, I mean this part.<br><br>You know what? I'll go and make a college just for you.</br></br></br>    <br>Nobody will trust collages based on shitty Hawk scans. Go on Bakabt and download the proper stuff, then get back to me.</br>  <br>the message gets across for crying out loud, don't be dense and accept Casca never stopped loving Griffith.</br>    <br> Such differences in dialogue! Hawks scans fucking sucksss <br><br>I know it's a thread meme by now but it gets old when you are told they don't help to support your claims</br></br></br>    <br>Yeah, I said that. Casca would always love Griffith, deep down, but it's the kind of unconditional love anybody would have towards him for saving their life and honing them into a strong, proud warrior. You're dense to think that Casca can't think of anyone else, that Griffith is the only person she cares about.</br>  I'm 30-35 chapters away from the last one, does Guts appearence ever improve? Man he's completely destroyed just look at his face.<br><br>I'm legit feeling sad for him although I've felt sad for him ever since golden arc but this is going off the charts.<br><br><br>Not only that but he seems to start getting signals that he's getting blind due to the armor. I can't see this ending well.<br><br><br>Caska is also starting to piss me the fuck off</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Judeau is cute</br>    I'm still mad there are no RAPE HORSE doujins.  <br>She realizes there's a difference in worship and love, anon. Read here<br><br>What she feels for him is deep-rooted love. And this will never change, because it's what shaped her as a person, it's the core of her character. Even after having lost her virginity to Guts, even after having him deciding to stay with her, she still prefered they part ways. In the end, her love for Griffith was greater than anything.<br>And even when she yells at him "this is the nightmare you wished for?" you can see desperation in her face, but not anger, even if what Griffith did what all she cared about ath the moment.<br>There's never anger in her, not even when she's being raped, not a single "damn you".</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>somehow, yes. i guess magic can heal burnscars.</br>  <br>Guts is best piggyback</br>  <br> those thighs <br>damn grffith u luckyyy</br></br>      Where were you when Casca realized where her heart belonged?    <br>What do you think about Skull Knight being Emperor Gaiseric theory?</br>  <br>He'll be a full-blown cripple by the time he gets off the boat at this rate.</br>  <br>It's obvious.</br>  <br>Not as beautiful as Guts.</br>  Who's this kid?  <br>small oopsie</br>  <br>Guts' bastard child.</br>  <br>PLEASE</br>  Wait...is that a...  What would Griffith do if he saw Casca again?<br><br>Apologize?</br></br>  <br>ye, who the fuck is he? He just dissapeared and we were never told shit about him ever again.<br><br>I'm guessing he's the elf king or some shit</br></br></br>  <br> There's never anger in her, not even when she's being raped, not a single "damn you". <br><br>I think that may have more to do the fact that she's barely conscious.<br><br>Anyway, seeing as you refuse to see how important Casca's love and acceptance of Guts is for her as well as him, there's no point in continuing this argument, everyone knows Casca x Farnese is the canon ending.<br><br><br>I don't understand what this image is trying to convey. I told you not to use the shitty Hawk scans, but nobody listens to the Cascafag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Take that motherfucker out of my sight.<br><br>This is how beautiful real man look.</br></br></br>  <br>i think it's reincarnated flor</br>  Who did it better?  <br>here's the DH one if you want<br><br>for best woman</br></br></br>  <br> I think that may have more to do the fact that she's barely conscious. <br>She still managed to say "don't look", anon.</br></br>  <br>I love how there are little details like that. In most things, they might describe how the protagonist's abilities/equipment fuck them up in some way or another, but short of being bisected or something the small things never get shown.</br>  <br>This is beuty</br>  <br>It's the behelit and Casca's child</br>  <br><br> that what have I done face <br><br>hngh my heart</br></br></br></br>  <br>I forgot, she said no a few times as well. Pic related is when she sees Guts being mauled by demons after trying to rescue her.</br>  poor Guts    <br>He was asking for it tbh.</br>    Was there anything better than Rickert slapping Griffith?<br><br>Miura still has it, gang. This is the greatest series of all time.</br></br>  I've been re-reading the last arc, and I forgot just how many glorious two-page spreads of Falconia Miura drew. No wonder this shit takes months, what the fuck - he's more or less architected the entire city layout.    <br>Does anyone else cringe when they see insanely detailed pages like this in Berserk because of how long it must of took? <br>I don't mean cringe in a bad way but I just feel like oh shit that must of took forever.</br></br>  <br> both Guts and Casca were asking for it <br> they're both branded <br><br>Genuinely made for each other. Griffith x Casca fuckers have been BTFO'd for years.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yet she still came</br>  <br><br>Fuck this! I'm more angry than before!</br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, all the time. I know it's an incredibly popular and well-received series, but it still feels like Miura goes under appreciated.<br><br>Spreads like that take so goddamn long, I can't imagine how much it must hurt to make progress and realize you messed up something and need to do it over.</br></br></br>  <br>You sure it isn't 90% by assistants?</br>  <br>Griffith came, and you're shit at collages. Kill yourself.<br><br><br>People like you are the reason these shitheads keep posted. Stop getting baited.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. The last couple chapters in Falconia are doubly ridiculous on that front - he'll put anywhere from 5-6 of these motherfuckers in one chapter, all with the same level of detail.</br>  <br> Griffith came,  <br>So did Casca, look at her. She's wetter than an otter's pocket.</br></br>  <br>You think what's dripping on the floor is Griffith's cum? KEK</br>  <br>You guys are less cynical than I am. I respect the effort it takes for something like this, but I think he and his team do so many of them because they're not sure where the story is going.<br><br>They're just filling up space.</br></br></br>  <br> wetter than an otter's pocket <br><br><br> using kek <br><br>No, it's Slan's cum.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most girls just get normally wet in intercourse without even squirting.</br>  <br>Griffith hadn't come yet when Miura focused on Casca's trembling foot and the love juice on the floor, anon.<br>Casca came, and she came hard.</br></br>  <br>Do you hate her for it?</br>  anyone else think that other manga miura drew with the muscly fat guy drinking the loli her pussyjuices to heal? Made him seem very pedo  <br>That's so not true. In order to get wet, you must get horny. Believe me, if it's something you absolutely don't want there's no way you'll get wet, only repulsed and nervous as fuck which will make your walls tense the fuck up, which difficults the penetration. Thus, making everything hurtful and awful. You can't cum under such circumstances, you can only feel pain.</br>  <br>Miura does not use many assistants</br>  <br>Of course not, Casca is my favorite girl and I don't try to make her something she's not and ignore all her flaws. I love her for what she is.</br>  <br>So was it five angels or four?<br><br>Also are they the Godhand we already know?</br></br></br>  <br>He didn't even last a minute.</br>  <br>Rickert wasn't even raped and rejected the new Griffith. Why people think that Casca would come back after being raped into retardation is beyond me.</br>  <br>Will the heavens destroy Giffith's city?</br>  <br>I am aware, but you talk like fluids directly mean orgasm.</br>  <br>Because she loves him and his dream. She understand that the end justifies the means, she was prepared for anything, anon.</br>  <br>Her body is pretty much excited. I mean, wet is normal. But dripping wet? that's something else. You just have to look at her, she trembles and drools at the end.</br>  <br>You should be kinder to the anons who are still sensitive about it, then. Not everyone has no name's fetish for rape.<br><br><br>Is this the face of being prepared for anything?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really. But then again, it was a fucked up situation, not even Griffith saw it coming. <br>But of one thing I'm certain, she was prepared to die for him. If she were to understand what the fuck happened, if Griffith were to explain what all that was about I'm 100% Casca would understand him and even forgive him.</br></br>  Well, congratulations Griffith! You just take Midland Kingdom! Now what's the next step in your master plan?  <br>Casca was raped, bloodied and full of demonsemen even beofre Griffith touched her.</br>  <br>Crashing this boat.</br>  <br>I'm the only person who thinks rape is far better than dying?</br>  <br> She understand that the end justifies the means <br>She watched everyone she care for die, and was raped by her idol in front who made her lover watch. <br>Even Casca can't be that devoted to overlook it all in favour of Griffith.</br></br></br>  <br>But not wet, anon. Only bloody.</br>  <br>To be subjected to so much pain for him and still want him in the end would say a lot about Casca's mental condition. She's be more reasonable in her potato form.<br><br><br>It's pretty hard to read through this again when you realize that Casca was pregnant the whole time.</br></br></br></br>  Who is he, /a/?  <br>Women have reported orgasming during rape despite themselves. It's still physical stimulation. Now imagine physical stimulation by Satan, who once reincarnated, is able to reduce grown (ish) men to tears with his mere prescence.</br>  <br>Are you forgetting the part when Guts was first introduced to the hawks and how he killed members and nobody seemed to give a fuck? they're ready to throw their life on the line, as long as it's for a reason. <br>Nobody but Guts could Witness how Griffith did it, or what happened to him. So it seemed as if they were dying for nothing. <br>I'm sure Casca would've given her life away if it mean Griffith would accomplish his dream, but she was left to wonder and make sense of the mess she experimented. Then she was raped by monster, and later Femto, who also happened to be love of her life, that made her cum in front of her significant other. <br>Honestly, retard Casca is better that way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>some vessel of the elf king<br>to watch shit go down and make cute pictures with casca</br></br>  When will we stop discussing this rape shit? What's the point? Why can't we all view the rape as prime fap material and still want her and Guts to get back together?  <br>A manifestation of Guts and Cacsa's child, only made possible by Griffith's rebirth.</br>  <br>Nah, dude. In 500 years, when someone can just pick up and read Berserk from start to finish, they'll be marveled at Falconia in all its splendor. These images will compliment the story, in the sense that we're seeing all this greatness before it all comes tumbling down tumbling down tumbling down.</br>  <br>I can't tell if you're serious or not. You never bother to use the right translation either.<br><br><br>Or elf king magic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd believe this if the woman was experimented. After all, orgasms by clit stimulation are the most common and why you see most porn actress rubbing it so fucking much in order to reach an orgasm. <br>Otherwise, there's just no way. Penetration alone won't cut it. And Casca isn't experimented at all.<br>Most of female orgasms are a mental thing after all. It heavily depends on who you're having sex with, or if it's part of a taboo fantasy you've always had.</br></br></br>  <br> Are you forgetting the part when Guts was first introduced to the hawks and how he killed members and nobody seemed to give a fuck? they're ready to throw their life on the line, as long as it's for a reason. <br><br>How can you even compare Guts offing some Hawks that attacked him first with Griffith sacrificing all of his loyal followers? Not only that they all died a gruesome deaths, but also are they damned to suffer in some hell dimension. I wonder how Rickert can even stay sane, when thinking of Corcus, Pippin and Judeau suffering for eternity. I doubt that no one will fill Casca in on the details of their branding, once she should regain her sainity.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm 100% serious, and the translation is trustworthy. What are you so afraid of?</br>  <br>I'm saying that anything Griffith commands it's done by the hawks, even if it means losing their life.</br>  Guts and crew ride the ship up onto land and up into Griffith's new kingdom, where they continue to ride it into Griffith and crush him to death.<br>The series then ends.</br>  <br> What is the G-spot <br><br>Also, women aren't a monolith. All women are different - some can be brought to orgasm easily even by penetration alone, some will never orgasm unless rub their clit at 9000RPM.</br></br></br>  <br> are you a woman? have you lost your virginity? </br>  <br>I just think Casca is better off with Guts, that's all.</br>  <br>Who is Oscar?</br>  <br><br>The ones on Mangareader are better quality</br></br>  <br>Now you're just bein petulant. I don't deny that the Hawk's were not ready to give their live for Griffith in a battle. However they were betrayed by him and given to feast upon by abominations and can't even rest in peace in their afterlife. I doubt anyone would have signed up for that shit.</br>  <br>Which is okay, I think they're amazing too. But I also believe her and Griffith could've worked and given the circumstances, Gutt's later train of thought, Casca's feelings that can still be perceived in her retard state and Griffith's condition. It isn't unlikely to happen.<br>Let it be what Miura wants it to be, which will most likely end in rape anyways.</br></br>  <br> unless you rub their clit at 9000RPM <br>iktf</br></br>  <br>*that the Hawks were ready to give their lives</br>  <br> girls <br> browsing and shitposting in /a/ <br>Retarded ugly permavirgins like you will never change.</br></br></br>  <br>you're such a dumb boy!</br>  WHERE IS THE NEW CHAPTER<br>WASN'T IT SUPPOSED TO BE OUT TODAY</br>  <br>5 days, my friend</br>  <br>NOOOOOOOOO</br>  <br>By give their lives I imagine that means they're willing to fight and die for him, you know... In a normal battle<br><br>Not be eaten alive by monsters and sacrificed in evil rituals and be damned to hell forever to suffer forever</br></br></br>  <br>They all knew what they were getting into when they decided to follow this moterfucker</br>   you now realize countless anons have started reading berserk since the hiatus started and only recently caught up with the manga without having have to deal with years of torment waiting for them to get off the boat.   <br>Yeah, I know and agree. I just corrected my sentence in the previous post by that post.</br>  <br>Hell no, they did not. People didn't know what abominations ran around the world and thought everything supernatural was just fantasy. They were ready to die for Griffith in battle and fight for his dream, not be eaten alive and be tortured some more in a hell dimesnion. How can you be so dense?</br>  <br>guilty<br><br>been non-stop hype train since i started berserk, feels good mayn</br></br></br>  <br> I can't imagine how much it must hurt to make progress and realize you messed up something and need to do it over. <br> not sure if stupid </br></br>  <br> They all knew Griffith would become a demon lord and be sacrificed to monster to be eaten and go to hell for eternity  <br><br>That's some God Hand tier manipulation you've got yourself under there pal</br></br></br>  <br>.........<br> ill fucking kill you. </br></br>  Sorry for the /r/ but where the fuck can I download some translated scans with good quality? Everything I found so far looks horrible.  <br><br><br><br><br>Look at this shit, despite everything Gaston did not hate, he was only reminiscing about Griffith. <br>He understood, he got it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>4 actually. The 24th in Japan will be the 23rd in America.</br>  <br><br>What the fuck are you even trying to say?</br></br>  <br>There's actually at least one girl here, probably more.</br>  <br> Void, Slan, Ubik and Conrad fucked Gaiseric's Kingdom <br>Skull Knight is a branded one too?</br></br>  <br>i just got the one on TPB with volumes 1-37</br>  <br><br><br>Despite having been betrayed and killed because of Griffith they couldn't bring themselves to hate him because that's how it is! the risks of being killed, tortured, massacred or anything in between in a world full of chaos and demons for his name were always present!</br></br></br>  <br>No way man, this is an all boys club.<br><br>Also, I miss tits or gtfo. Whatever happened to tits or gtfo?<br><br>4chan, I despise what you have become.</br></br></br></br></br>  what chapter was the duel between serpico and guts ?    <br>That retarded ugly permavirgin wishes that at least 1 girl would browse and shitpost in /a/.</br>  <br> Projecting this hard <br>Anon, you're such a silly boy!</br></br>  <br>Intercourse in missionary postion for procreation purposes. But thats doggie style so its rape.</br>  <br>You'll like it eventually, anon.</br>  I hope my nigga Silat and the boys join Guts's shitty party  <br><br><br>these three queers are my favorite musketeers</br></br></br>  <br><br>Quit posting shit scans.</br></br>  <br>None of those things are going to happen. One of Guts' friends should wield katars, though.</br>  <br>I love those giganiggas. I hope we see them in action again soon.</br>  Am I the only one who foresees Guts gathering an army by how his group has been increasing lately?<br><br>I don't how the fuck he manages to endure all the shit he's been through though</br></br>  Guts will reach Griffith but go blind, never be able to defeat him, and then die. A side character like Rickert will finish off Griffith and the series will end just like CB.  <br>NO LISTEN<br><br>CASCA WILL FUCKING DIE<br><br>GUTS WILL BE CONSUMED BY THE HELL HOUND<br><br>SOUL CHILD WILL FUSE WITH IT AND THE ARMOR WILL TAKE AN ENTIRELY NEW FORM</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I see this likely happening. The army has been growing and I think that they will raise an army to fight griffith.</br>   this translation <br><br>ayy</br></br>  <br>I hated Corcus, but my heart broke a little when he just said fuck it and his mind broke.</br>  <br>Guts is the good guy in this story. He did nothing wrong.</br>  ayy lmao  <br>Wanna play a nice game of rape?<br> No. <br>That's the spirit!</br></br></br>  post moments your dick exploded  <br>Rather than going blind, he is getting astral sight from the looks of it. He thought he saw streams all over the moon.</br>  <br>I think it's implied they did.

They'd set apostles ablaze.</br></br></br>  In which volume is the Farnese flash back?  <br>Someone said Casca is another language for shell, hinting she's a shell of her former self. Not sure if true.<br><br>Is she black or what?</br></br></br>  <br> Skellig is also an island off our coast <br>wut</br></br>  <br>He's been getting a lot of Saiyan powerups since he got the armor. Used to it was man vs. monster, but now even in his regular form he's basically a monster.<br><br>HURR EVERYTIME HE USES ARMOR HE BECOMES STRONGER BECAUSE ELVES HEAL HIM seems a bit bullshit to me, but whatever works.</br></br></br>  <br> there's actually people who think a human Griffith could stand up to a human Serpico </br>  Why is that, whenever Casca gets scenes of the rape during eclipse, she only remembers monsters raping her and not femto?  <br>The monster rape didn't break her mind, Griffith did.</br>  <br> We're getting a 100 page chapter in a little more than a week  <br>HOLY SHIT THAT'S AWES-<br> and it will continue from there with monthly updates. <br>Okay know you are just shitting me. Thanks for getting my hopes up asshole.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Casca is shell in portuguese</br>  <br>If she's able to recall those moments, shouldn't the most significant one also be parto f that?</br>  <br>Anon, I...</br>  <br> shell <br> penetrated easier than a turtle. </br></br>  Ok so Berserk is great and all but what exactly sets him apart from the generic main protagonist?  <br>You got some sauce on that 100 page chapter? My desk just rose 4 inches</br>  <br><br>Shell of her former self.</br></br>  YO PEOPLE. Never read Berserk before, so I got bakabt torrent and apparently there are no seeds. Anyone willing to help a selfish anon? By the way, my connection is not that good.   they arrive at the elf land <br> it's all destroyed <br> guts and caska continue on <br> some magical elf shit tells them that to cure caska and kill griffon, they have to get the magical item <br> 6 years later, the chapter where guts starts preparing for the fight comes out <br> another 6 years later, he gets to griffon <br> miura dies </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What sets him apart?<br> born from a corpse hanging from a tree <br> sold for 5 silver by his psuedo father <br> raped by black man <br> kills psuedo father <br> defeated Busuzo. THE Busuzo. <br> Is the raid captain for strongest forces in midland <br> 1v1 basically Ifrit. <br> sole survivor outside of a woman from an isolated apocolypse/rape fest. <br> solo'd 100 man army <br> 1v1 worlds strongest general and decapitated him <br> 1V1 crystal dragon and won <br> 1v1 demon albino gorilla <br> massacred entire troll cave <br> 2v1 thunder god <br> 1v1 cthuulu <br> survived 6yr boat ride. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> another 100 years. Miura is cloned.............................<wbr>........................... ................. ............... ............................. and we have to wait another 30 years because the final battle takes place on a boat.</wbr> </br>  <br>See now thats all really cool but the same could be said about the fella from Bleach</br>  <br>It's a regular size chapter and a reprint of the previous couple chapters, because it's been so fucking long they need to refresh people on what the plot it.</br>  <br><br><br>Why is Anna so based?</br></br></br>  <br> in between in a world full of chaos and demons for his name were always present! <br>No, you shit. people were not aware of demons and monsters before the realms merged. Did you even read the same manga?</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure Ichigo never watched Rukia/Nel/Orihime get raped by demons, and then his ex best friend who sacrificed all his other friends to be devoured mercilessly by demons.</br>  <br>Please, Gaston is the emphasizes everything what is wrong about the eclypse and Griffith's choice.</br>  <br>Oh yeah because this never happened</br>  The only thing worse than Griffith apologists and "Casca loved every second" posters are people that fapped to the rape.<br>End your life you disgusting cunts.</br>  <br>Anon, please...</br>  <br> not MalaysianAirlines.jpg <br><br>one job anon</br></br></br>  <br> This triggers the normies </br>  <br>second that</br>  <br> not enjoying watching your beloved fictional characters get their lives destoryed in a torrent of obscene sexual voilence <br> normie <br><br>No I just think you're a heartless horny freak</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> &gt;bakabt .me/whitelist.php <br> you are using the wrong torrent application/version </br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather have that than a dead Casca</br>  So, how about some Berserk's Colored Adventure?  <br>Because Guts has the most tragic backstory in history, and while he's fighting all his struggles for revenge and the woman he loves, everyone thinks of him as a villian wherever he goes and his enemy that damned him (who used to be his bestfriend and he killed/cursed everyone Guts loved) as some shining white knight. He is a tragic anti-hero who pushes through everything.</br>  <br>Do you have reading comprehension problems? I never said that there were no monsters but people were not quite aware of them and their multitude. Remember how Guts lost his shit when he first saw Zodd? Or even the reaction of Rickert in your pic? They were not a 100 percent clear on all the things that were going on in the world and did not sign up to be eaten by sluglords and whatnot. For the majority of the time apostles kept low profile like the count. The Hawks agreed to fight and die for Griffith in battle and not to eventually end as demon chow</br>  <br>Guts is my hero.</br>  OH SHIT WAS THERE ANOTHER CHAPTER?  I don't understand this anime at all. First it claims to have an internal logic. The anime clearly establishes that servants are much more powerful than any human. Why does Shirou then defeat Archer, who clearly is the most op servant? He never had any significant training. Back in middle ages they trained knights from small children. Compared to even normal knights Shirou is a fucking nobody. And what is this this bullshit about his body being made swords? So is he a human born out of a woman or is he some just some sort of deus machina? This anime is like first explaining the rules of chess and then Shirou just flips over the chess board and says he won.  Which Archer?  <br> confirmed to be busy sucking dick while watching this <br>they outright say when he fights archer he gets stronger each time they clash swords since some magic bs + Avalon, and he broke archers spirit</br></br>  <br><br> they outright say when he fights archer he gets stronger each time <br><br>That's not a reason why he gets stronger. You can't just establish some new rule in the world of anime in the last episodes where the weakest faggot just gets stronger the more he loses</br></br></br></br>   archer <br><br>Oh yeah sorry meant Gilgamesh. But oh well the same logic applies to archer to since he still would lose 100-0 vs a normal middle age knight. Because he has no training</br></br>  <br>ok. heres the deal<br>he got magic circuits, some inactive since he haven't learned to open/use them yet.<br> time paradox <br>his magic circuits gets opened up when he fights "himself" learning to use them since he can copy and paste shit.</br></br></br></br>  lowqualitybait.jpg<br><br>Report and hide.</br></br>  <br>Against Emiya Archer he wins because Archer was really weak and it was more a battle of ideals.<br><br>Against Gilgamesh he wins because rock paper scissors.</br></br></br>  Let us discuss the greatest SoL anime there is and ever will be.<br><br>What is your favourite episode of K-ON?<br>What is your favourite HTT song?<br>And, most importantly: what is it that makes Azusa so perfect?</br></br></br></br>  Alright kids, hold on to your butts because this is about to get ugly. I know some of you dickwheels think your waifu is hot shit, but think again. Let's pretend a girl from K-ON came alive and started dating you. If that girl isn't Mugi, you just got FUCKED. PERMANENTLY.<br><br>Why? You're shit. Fuck your life, kid. You need someone to take care of you, that's why you're still living with your mom. Guess what, the ONLY bitch capable of that in K-ON is Mugi. Yui’s in the same boat as you, Ritsu’s batshit insane, Mio’s high maintenance, and Azusa would get pissed at how you don’t work and leave you, just like your last girlfriend.<br><br>Even ignoring that, you still have to entertain your waifu. I bet you can’t entertain any normal person, that’s why you have no fucking friends. The only K-ON girls you could please are Yui and Mugi, because they are easily amused. The difference? Yui likes simple shit because she’s on the border between retarded and braindead. Mugi adores homely things because before high school she lived a luxurious but lonely life. Not only that, she actually LIKES taking care of people, which means that you make her happy BY SIMPLY EXISTING AS THE DEPRESSING EMBARRASSMENT TO YOUR LORD(S) THAT YOU ARE.<br><br>And another thing. She’s RICH. With Mugi you wouldn’t need to work a day in your fucking life, yes that’s right you could finally silence that voice in the back of your head saying you’ll never amount to anything cause you just hit the god damn jackpot. Mugi’s so smart, she actually recognizes that a life of wealth is unfulfilling. That’s right; she can see that the simple beauty of humanity is more precious than money, something you’ll NEVER UNDERSTAND. Choosing a waifu other than Mugi is like saying “hey /a/, I plan on shitting on my own dick when I get my ribs removed to self-fellate better so I can recycle my bodily waste as food.” So choose Mugi you pig-dicked minge, or get fucking killed.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not a NEET though</br>  <br>'k</br>  <br>No, of course you aren't, you just don't make an effort in class because you are on another plane of existence when compared to everyone else at your school. <br><br>Stop lying to yourself, Anon, Mugi is the only one who can truly offer you what you need. <br><br>The sooner you accept it, the better off you will be in the future.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty rude imply that Mugifags are all pathetic NEET hikikomori neckbeards,<br>even ruder to imply that Mugi's standards are that low</br></br>   there are unironically people on this website RIGHT NOW who are unaware that azusa is the best girl   <br> tfw no retarded Yui gf <br><br>It hurts.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw no bossy Azusa gf <br>suffering</br></br>  <br>I just started watching K-On because I hated moeshit. <br><br>It's amazing, I'm just smiling throughout the whole show. I'm watching every moeshit now. I don't even remember why I hated them.</br></br></br>  This is a Boy  <br>And? I could tell from the cover.</br>  This is Nepgear.  Boy in a cute frilly dress.  I want this.  <br>TOP NEP XDXDXD</br>  <br>This is a girl.</br>  <br> this is a president</br>  <br>Problem?</br>  <br>But we alredy knew you're homosexual.</br>  <br>The best kind of girl.<br><br><br>The best kind of guy.</br></br></br></br>  This is a boy  <br>Looks like a girl tbh.</br>  This is Akechi    <br>This is a genius*</br>  <br>Is he using Soft &amp; Wet?</br>  What is the new season even about?<br><br>Why are those girls from season two suddenly in prison but in the next episode, free?<br><br>what the fuck is going on</br></br></br></br>  <br> Some of us have nice headphones <br><br>Did you miss the part where FLAC is only really worth it for archival purposes. If you can afford such nice headphones to actually be able to spot the difference between FLAC and the mp3 rips I'm sure you can drop the $20 to import the CD yourself</br></br></br>  <br>Just said it doesn't top Fushidori then.</br>  Hey, I have an idea, what if it was Gungnir that gave Hibiki her over the top fighting spirit, and since now it's gone, the psychological effects wore off?  <br>Not him but Hibiki is a miracle of the universe and has always been the greatest thing about Symphogear in general for me. Personality wise and hot-blooded hero wise.</br>    Why they want to kill the qt3.14  <br>Really sucks when a decent show has low budget and shitty harem series gets twice as much. Anime is dead</br>  <br>Because that fucking bunny is a traitorous whore</br>  <br>Because she is the Hero Killer.</br>  <br>Episode looked decent. <br><br>That's just an inbetween, like all the times shitposters try to falseflag.</br></br></br>  <br>Did you watch the episode? She's the one who's been killing the potential heroes. If anything Adlet is the stupid one.</br>  Why do the Japanese make anime girls look white and not asian?  <br>Only SE Asians and some Chinese have those nigger-tier wide noses. Japs and Koreans in general don't.</br>      <br><br>it's not deliberate, it's subconscious. they draw desirable features and intuitively make them white, then deny it.<br><br><br><br>yet they look completely white and nothing like any pacific asian. that's the point.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>touche</br>  What do you guys think of DBS so far? Three episodes thus far and it has a slice-of-life feel, episode two with Vegeta's family vacation was enjoyable to me. I know this is just setup but I almost wish we could get past the BoG stuff and start progressing with new material. So far episodes follow a pattern of focusing on SoL stuff and Beerus wrecking things.  <br> DB was made by Toriyama and was a borefest. <br>You have the worst taste imaginable.</br></br>  <br><br>How can you understand anything with just the raw? I think you guys take your weabooism a bit too far.</br></br>  <br> Hair changes colour from gold to pinkish red; it doesn't even change shape or anything <br> BREATH OF FRESH AIR </br></br>  <br>Beerus is best qt</br>  <br><br> Goku reks New 52 Supes <br><br>Superman in the New 52, has been ridiculously overpowered.<br>For example, he can temporarily power up to his "Superdoom" form (adds the power of Doomsday) and also do an additional power up where he gains the powers of Brainiac. Superman could literally just will Goku out of existence if he wanted to at that point.<br>Or he could use his recently acquired "Super Flair" power (unleashes all of his power at once, but loses his powers for 24 hours afterwards) once he's in his Doomsday/Brainiac form. That would be equivalent of like a trillion of Goku's maximum powered spirit bombs.<br>pic related</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>]
