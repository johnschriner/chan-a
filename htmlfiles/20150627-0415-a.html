[ Hey there. Dumping a manga from 1976.   This series is self-titled “Fleshbomb Masterpiece.” The first chapter is full of flexing muscles, sweating, flowers, and more flexing.                 <br/>    This is already something else        Enjoy the ride.        Internet's shit at the moment, so this will go slowly.   uho~                        He looks like a fucking balloon/human hybrid.     He's having a long day.              I'd say he looks like melting ice cream.  Look at that smug. He's made of ice cream! Has to be.           At this point, I'm not gonna lie and say this is shit because I'm obviously fucking enthralled but what the fuck is even going on?       Man with muscles and amnesia wanders the world. Or, something.       [dramatic foot entrance]       man          Talk   STICKY   LEG (?) CLOSEUP!   BACK(?) CLOSEUP!   STICKY FOOT CLOSEUP   Pull back, capture that ass!   I'm having a bit of a Wiseau feeling about this thing. It's surreal.              It's a fleshbomb masterpiece.        EVEN A KID, IT DOESN'T MATTER  I swear, if this turns into shota fucking I'm gonna go do something I'll regret.                     Proteins are one hell of a drug. Is this /fit/'s bizzarre adventure?           wat     We may never know.                             What the hell is going on?                               I don't even...          Anon, first I must thank you for dumping this. Second, what the flypidity flipdegpiujdfng fuck is all that about?          This thing is like Cho Aniki turned into a surreal drama instead of surreal comedy.                             i swear to fuck araki not only wrote this series, made a drug that can get immortal vampires to trip really badly, but he took said drugs and OD'd extremely hard. this is the only possible explanation i can think of for this manga to exist.                                          What in the fuck is even happening                                                                               this weight is made for me                                                                                                      What the fuck?        What happened to Mo-tan to become so tiny? Did she only manage to reincarnate partially?  Is she not part of the zodiac anymore then?     Why the fuck would she be traveling around the world with Nya-tan in the first place, doesn't she have the whole Tokai region to protect?   inb4 it turns out there WAS somebody that missed Rat's radar and won all the Eto-seals in the last moment to become an Eto-shin.    Hooray Paca-tan          Her soul got ripped out and shattered. Give her SOME time to heal    she's on sick leave   what I want to know is Pretty Mode tiny in general or is Mo-tan just like that because of the aforementioned soul ripping          Rabbit? More like RabBest.   Well there's the manga.  Which deviates so much from the anime that it is practically a different story just with characters that look the same    You're early today      I, for one, welcome our new CG overlord.    well that is smaller but hardly pocket sized     Nya-tan is travelling the world to find a cure to restore mo-tan's body.  Mo-tan is too weak to protect a region and just tags along with Nya-tan.   season 2 never indeed        Boar is best  Reminder that Meitan was confirmed best girl last thread.    Mission accomplished     I feel sad for you Sheepfags since she gets BTFO in manga    So, uh, did they explain what the deal is with Takeru? Did I miss something?   What was wrong with him?    He was just a small town boy    I'm still wondering how he's able to barf out Sol/Lull like it's no big deal.     does anyone else feel like the ending was a tease for second season/OVA where they will have 3D segments with more realistic body proportions just like in OPs pick?  it felt like that to me.   muh sales!   there are plenty of low-sales shows that get second seasons or OVAs           List a few  because I would like to believe      there are plenty of low-sales shows that get second seasons or OVAs  Because they are for promoting the source material. If the publishers think an anime increased the sales of manga, VNs, or merchandise, even if the anime itself sold badly, they will consider it a success.  Etotama was just a commercial disaster.      Now my ears can rest in peace and heal from Nya's voice.    Etotama was just a commercial disaster.  Exactly. And it makes me fucking happy.     You could marinate a whole cow with such saltiness  not that it would be difficult now that Mo-tan has become chibi     Living in a lonely world?    Why chuu-tan looks so HIGH.    Because Murakawa subconsciously hates Rat  or her VA  deep inside     Not anymore, he has a floor boar, a monkey and a dog on his roof, a horse and a sheep taking care of his home, a tiger and a dragon keeping him company, a rooster waking him up in the morning, a snake cooking for him, a cat with a cow, and a rabbit occassionally visiting him, and now he also acquired a sexy loveable rat who hangs around him to relax. Must be awesome having such great Soul/Lull.       Shitty drawings being showcased in anime is my biggest hnnnngggggghhhh    Well that was cute.   What does her VA have to do with it?   damn, that was a totally worthless final for a worthless series   That was a joke.  A retarded one at that, sorry       Matsui Eriko and Ozawa Ari are talented as fuck.     Mo-tan  That VA can art, dang.      I like Chu-tan's and Shaa-tan's, and nya-tan's  like they know they can't draw for shit so they don't care       Usa-tan&gt;Mo-tan&gt;Uma-tan&gt;Inu-tan&gt;rest<wbr>  Usa-tan has the most character, Mo-tan is more polished but the drawing itself ain't as good  </wbr>   Favorite Pretty Mode designs?  My top 3 is boar, snake, and tiger.       nope, Mo-tan drawing best and then Shima-tan   Piyo-tan has best pretty mode        Piyotan, Uritan, Shaatan.      footfag bait   best anything       Well, finally finished whatever autistic thing I've been doing for several days.  https://mega.co.nz/#F!L1FUkAyR!sz2d<wbr>uWsfLq1-1LtM558L8w  Feel free to step up and translate.  No, fuck it, SOMEBODY PLEASE TRANSLATE    </wbr>    te plot was too similar to first neptunia game  Who the hell is drawing all these 2D Pretty Modes and how is he making them so fucking cute  Can we all agree now that Etotama is AOTS? If not, it's probably the most surprising anime this season.   The 3D animation done fucking right.    GOAT 3dcg. Is this the future of animation?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4Ws<wbr>pe9AxHng</wbr>  [ ] https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Rdm<wbr>-Xab7kHs</wbr>  [ ]    We just have to hope studios outsource their 3D to shirogumi    Maybe not AOTS, but surely is the hidden gem I'll remember fondly. Like The Rolling Girls last season.    They were always cute, anon.    Where is her nose?    Watch Short 4 and tell me if you still think Mei-tan is best    The rat took it.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127207004  Fuck, I need some sleep.   Did they complete the music video with the Etotamas singing in pretty mode yet?      Don't you want to hear desu desu sing anymore?    Comes with BD Vol 6, which comes out late July.     No subs so far.     Had to reword post to make sure I didn't fuck it up a third time desu desu.   Thanks, I'll be looking forward to it.       It's kind of obvious what they say.  Mei-tan's devotion for Takeru goes a little too far and spooks the shit out of the Takeru-house residents     that second left, top-most   ;_;     I just realized after posting, that was made by Nya-tan's VA. She must have had fun voicing her     Where's this located?   Would you?   Would I!    Damn you, Anon! Connecting LAN thread is too lewd for our board!    AIIIIE    Yes, I'd let Daedalus fill my holes   I finished the YEEART compiliation for episodes 3 and 4 of the dub  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-a-<wbr>FbmXlKgc</wbr>  [ ]   wish the original yeeart compilations weren't taken down by king records        Is this show good or is it Inferno cop 2.0?      is this show good or is it really great   it's pretty good     DOOMO, Mina=SAN. Translator=SAN desu.  Last week, I promised to translate an episode from the LN that features Yamoto. And guess what, I'm here to deliver. http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OsOI<wbr>-aIA9uo</wbr>  [ ] http://pastebin.com/ZVH0sFfz A few words to say about this one.  - The episode is broken into five parts. The second one will probably be ready today, with the last three coming next week.  - I'm not a native English speaker, and I don't even have an editor, so some phrases might sound wrong (and not just because this is Ninja Slayer). Feel free to correct me, and I'll edit the pastebin.  - This episode is guaranteed to be in the anime, but probably not in a few weeks. Enjoy comparing it to the source material when it airs.  - Sorry if some Ninja Slayer phrases don't match the official translations, it takes too much time to compare them to my own translations.           It's so inviting.   I thought this was supposed to be about ninjas or something    She's CIA.    It is, but once a gainax, always a gainax    She's got a big bust.    I tough anime was for kids    Nice.    For you.  tfw her bust is not for me ;_;     How much does Nancy charge an hour?  Would I what?   Nan Shiri.    I feel as though I need to pick this up again.     Domo Arigato Mr. Roboto for your work Translator-san.  I found a couple errors like ""It has come to this", the ninja grumbles and unsheaves the katana hanging on his waist."  Overall, it's good, though maybe too many phrases were left in Japanese, pretty sure the official translations made sure to translate words like kowai         That's true. I changed "Scary" to "Kowai" right before uploading it, mostly because my personal rule of thumb is to leave everything that's written in katakana in Japanese, to reflect the foreign feel they have in the novels (as these words are usually written in hiragana/kanji). Guess it should depend on the situation.   Nah. That dude is creepy as fuck.  Does she want his dick?  Less than 20 minutes until the new episode airs, and my proxy won't let me watch Nicovideo again. Guess I'm stuck waiting for subs with you guys.     Yeeart compilation for episode 5 of the dub  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4fj<wbr>vAK16vs4</wbr>  [ ]       How about that screen time.  Ah, so it's Menace of Dark Ninja, just as expected. I suppose that means it's Back In Black next time.   She got some.      Only when Nancy agrees.    Will wait for complete YEEART COMPILATION when the show ends.  Also YEEART!!      Hoping for her to get more screentime.  Also reminder that Koki won the Fujibowl in the daughteru class.  Now only Nancy and Yukano are left fighting for the Fujibowl.  And I heard there will be a tomboy detective later...           Oh yeah, that's a thing I should do  Might make a new account and pick up where the guy who did it for the original version left off before getting DMCA'd       And another one. With said tomboy detective...    Is this drawn by Warui Naku? Cause it looks familiar.     another one  The detective and the tomboy are two different people. Though the detective does have a bespectacled assistant.   Yes, it's by Warainaku.       Would you pay?   She is too ample for screen time.      YEEART!!   Has Nancy ever done anything useful or is she just worthless fapbait?   She did give Ninja Slayer the cure for Sensei.  Right before he got slain by Dark Ninja.     Have you not been watching the last three episodes?  Nancy is a boss. As expected of the CIA.      I wouldn't.  okay, that was a lie     I would most certainly.  Well, Viewster's up, guys.  http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>04867</wbr>     ARIGATO, anon-san.     no, I stopped watching a few weeks ago    w-w-what happened?!   This was the best episode yet too.    Holy shit I never noticed that moon before.    This is lewd. I can almost see her butthole.     YEEART!    What's Nancy Lee's tag on pixiv?   2spooky   I'm so glad this garbage show is getting canned badly.   It was in the very first episode.    I didn't notice until now.    TAKE THIS!        Implying    Oh my...      For the first time I guess we're seeing Fujikido's full face clearly this episode.  Let's see if the Japanese Twitterspace is still going to say he  used to be a Producer.     Today, will we get an answer to the real question: which bust is best?  AMPLE   ABUNDANT   ABSENT       YEEART!    http://www.pixiv.net/search.php?s_m<wbr>ode=s_tag&amp;word=ナンシー・リー</wbr>     Think you can get a blog/tumblr/etc. so you could post updates outside the one or two threads we get after the episode airs?     They really dropped the ball on Koki's VA. That is just awful.    If the price is reasonable.    Ample.   HS subs be out  So I feel retarded because I know this is all a giant joke thing from Trigger, but the light novel was released to promote the anime, right? To continue to "Yea, this was from America and we brought it to Japan" image they started with from the teaser stuff?   The LN is the source material. This is an adaptation.   How many points would you give her?   Thanks anon   Domo Dark Ninja-san, Ninja slayer desu.  Can anyone beat him?  slayer using his soul the right way is just like ichigo and his hollow.    those peach tones have never been so lewd    My fucking sides.  Very good episode. Probably my favorite episode so far   Fucking stock footage...though they actually used it smartly here.    Would doing it by a Twitter account be authentic enough?   But yeah, making a dedicated account shouldn't be too hard. I might also post the Imaishi interview over there, so people don't have to look for it again and again. I just need a good service, because Tumblr is a piece of shit both in content and structure.        Would doing it by a Twitter account be authentic enough?    I'd follow it    I just need a good service   blogspot? or wherever everyone hosts their blogs nowadays  you can even use shittier sites like deviantart since that allow text submissions.           YEAAAART  KUAAAA  YEAAAART  KUAAAA  YEAAAART  KUAAAA  YEAAAART  KUAAAA  YEAAAART  KUAAAA  YEAAAART  KUAAAA                This whole episode was great, the must have no money left after this one.      Darkninja is freaking knight of cerebus.  He even has a explosion behind him as powerful as that what Ninja Slayer has.       And every piece of media ever where the MC has some kind of evil personality that makes him stronger when it's on control. Bleach didn't invent characters taking control of the powers of their evil personalities, retard   Dem Ninja Taytays  So is Dark Ninja-san the NIPPON STRONK true ninja? He actually uses a weapon, stealth techniques,  teleporting behind you .     I like how they're being accurate to the novel  “Yeeart!” Throw! “Yeeart!” Muteki attitude defense. “Yeeart!” Throw! “Yeeart!” Muteki attitude defense. “Yeeart!” Throw! “Yeeart!” Muteki attitude defense. “Yeeart!” Throw! “Yeeart?” Muteki attitude defense.               people unironically thinking this is good.  Idiots.    SAYANORA     muh triggers  stay salty /a/      You mean    people AIEEEronically thinking this is good.           Ampule   Ample      This episode was great. Also, while it's obvious because he didn't SAYONARA and explode, the credits confirm Dark Ninja-san is still alive    Are you a NINJA!?      people unironically being buttblasted by a low budget 15 minute show   This is delicious.       dat cute as fuck Yukano's "Yeeart!"    Stay buttblasted , Dark Ninja-san Your physics-bening Katana made with True Nippon Steel forgeed over a 1000 times is inferior to Ninja Slayer-san's karate.     Whose this semen demon     God I want her to land on me and feel those two chest pillows softly envelop my face.     Like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde?       pic related     Ninja detected    One of the oldest examples.  But then we have even older like in case of people affected by lycanthropy in medieval folklore.  And there are probably even older examples.        Arigatou, Ninja Slayer-san!  YEEART!       So who do you think will win the Slayerbowl?     Both With Koki as their daughter  And Suicide as her boyfriend, but Fujikido will not approve that      WHERE THE FUCK IS KOKI  FUCK SHIT DAMN HELL  THAT'S IT. THAT'S FUCKING IT. DROPPED.        This moefag so buttblasted that the show doesn't focus on his moeblob high school girl  I like Koki, don't get me wrong, but seriously getting this mad because she hasn't shown up is retarded    Fucku shimasu    not liking NINJA Slayer-san    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127166609     I like this       today's dub episode will have her   I hope they don't fuck up her voice but they probably will.     1-2 days ago, people were talking about how disappointing this was, and that it lacked the heart of Trigger's previous anime.  Now, the meme brigade is out talking about how AWESOME and DANK it is.      Trigger's previous anime  Inferno cop is the only decent thing they've created, and that was only because it was different. KLK was a crime against humanity.       it lacked the heart of Trigger's previous anime.  Ninja Slayer has Inferno Cop written all over it.     chadou  My sides just recited their death haiku   So who here recognices the Alabama drop using his historical knowledge?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127166609  I like it unironically. Fuck off.     Izuna Otoshi     Confirmed retard. Work on your comprehension.  It's one thing to unironically like it, it's another to unironically think it's good.      I unironically think its good.  Hell, its my AOTS.     Because the shitposters try to shitpost all week, while we fans comment about each episode when they come out. That will be true until NS finishes at the end of the summer season    I like it and its good. Happy now?    Why do you care so much if some people think that low-budget weekly ONAs that last 15 minutes is AOTS?     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127166609   Le ebin "I was just baiting and pretending to be retarded"  Doing that is still retarded, and shitposting Fuck off       It's a very dangerous martial arts for assassination so it has been forbidden for hundreds of years. Nowadays, only tea ceremony , a element of mental training, still remains.   Dragon Gendoso, last successor of Chado initiated Ninja Slayer into secret technique of it.   [original Japanese spelling] 茶道(Sadou)   [original Japanese meaning] Tao of tea ceremony(Of course, it's not dangerous martial arts.)  http://wikiwiki.jp/njslyr/?%C9%F0%C<wbr>6%BB%A1%A6%A5%EF%A5%B6%A1%A6%A5%B8%<wbr>A5%C4#pd146364</wbr></wbr>        <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127166609  Oh you troll them hard kid!   Big breasted silhouettes are my fetish.   I'd look after Yukano, if you know what I mean.  Marriage, of course         KLK was a crime against humanity   2013 AOTY  Go fuck yourself      Ninja Slayer From Compilation "Nin"   ニンジャスレイヤー フロムコンピレイシヨン 「忍」   Release Date Jul 22, 2015  soon.png     I guess it's time to go look for more Yukano porn on pixiv, damn that ample bust. And holy shit, another instrumental ED. I think I unironically love this show.    NIN!    Now now, KLK wasn't that bad, but it wasn't THAT good either.     KlK   AOTY 2013  I loved the show, but Gundam Build Fighters, Majestic Prince and Samurai Flamenco were better     If you think about it, this is the most weeaboo anime to ever exist.   Little Witch Academia was good too   This episode finally reaches to the height of ep1.  This is what I'm waiting for.     That's the point They LN is advertised as the translation of a novel written by two american weeaboos     Talking about LWA What's this I've been reading about a LWA and Inferno Cop crossover?      That's the point  I know, but its still a weird thought. A Japanese animation that is western trying to be Japanese.      Wishful thinking    That's some fine shit taste.    you will never marry and fuck a titty ninja    taimanin asagi-tier doujins of Yukano and Nancy and Koki when      ALL MY MONEY    Since the whole concept of Ninja Slayer is based on those corny ninja B-movies from the 80's, you can bet your ass on yes she want it badly.    Keep telling that to yourself faggot.    She didn't have to unzip it all the way...    Man, I think Ryu and Fujikido would be drinking buddies.   I think this should be good enough. Feel free to follow this for more translations when the thread is down. I'll also be posting the manga translations as it gets done by Typesetter=SAN. yeeart-translations. (blogspot is apparently spam) .com Now, to finish that chapter 2.     I wish you'd return to reddit already, retard.    I didn't even notice that    Dear me.  She'd be the mother of a clan worth of ninjas if she had a man.  Hoping that she and Fujikido become a pair, but then there is Nancy around as her only rival in this situation.        Thank you, Translator=SAN    That is why it's so hilarious    I agree.  Yukano's too much woman to end alone.      implying I lurk in reddit  I prefer you BTFO you presumptuous cunt.     New objective: getting a big breasted gf and making her cosplay Yukano.    Why can't he have both?     New objective: getting a gf  ftfy      tfw ugly small breasted gf  kill me     Are you at least  happy ?     tfw no gf  end myself     Better than nothing but feeling like my life is fading away.      Fuck off to leddit       all the YEEART      still shitposting  Idiots.    Here's the OST that came with BDv1 that released yesterday. Pic related highest res cover I could find since I forgot to put it in the zip   https://mega.co.nz/#!dFJ1mTwC!meuP<wbr>YIrksGIROnJj1tt-sf2b9Bcq2fbUBYcda-i<wbr>_soY</wbr></wbr>    I would be grateful if someone made a torrent and put it on Nyaa.       Context?    I'm grinning like a silly girl the whole scene.    Thank you, kind Sir      Arigato anon-san.    She doesn't fit into the screen.    So it doesn't include the EDs after all?     DOMO ARIGATO, Anon=san.  I shall proceed to  YEEART  myself with this.       Short they showed at the AX panel or something like that.     not 96kbps  one job, anon-san  AOTY anyway, untill ed album that is      <br/>    Are these just the songs from before or is there new stuff?     I'm a sucker for chuuni pseudo-Western weebshit like this and if this show was exactly the same storywise but had a real budget and full length episodes it would have been unironically my anime of the decade.    It's all new stuff, no repets from the old OST.     big ass   pants have a large hole for the ass   thong   squatting   almost visible asshole  ALL MY FETISHES AT ONCE        I can't believe that was only 12 minutes   Thank you for the context.     Is there a source for the old OST? Have been trying to find that.      squatting   Are you slav?        Oh shit nevermind I asked. The old torrents are back alive again. The last time I tried them they were mostly dead.      I highly doubt it but maybe the TV rebroadcast will have full animation.     not finding a woman with a nice ass and thighs squatting hot   also no      What?    Namu Amida Butsu! Arigato, Anonymous=SAN.    Wow, this show is absolute garbage.    Arigato, Anon-san    0/10 bait harder    This isn't the euphonium thread     神回     Dat 12 and 15   So he's now dead for real? That's sad. The ample ninja is an orphan now ;_;     What about the animation in the OP where he kicks Fujikido in the face?   His smile and optimism gone.   Probably something from when they first met All we know is that Sensei saved his life Maybe he was out of control and fully possesed by Naraku Ninja, and Sensei snapped him out of it?      That was apparently a flashback when he saved NS for the first time.    I think it's from the past    I assume we're going to see it next week.    Beautiful  that 15      YEEART!   fucking Scarf! Edna Mode was right!   Here's the English tracklist, since it's all in katakana and easy to translate:  Naraku Within From Animation   Gaion Zen Trance   The Girl Awakes   Roshi Ninja   Karate Of The Old Dragon   Crow Flies Away   Survivor Dojo   The Parade   Ninja Briefing   NRS   Cold Futon Awaits   Enter Karate Storm   Hunt Of Shadows   Kiken Emergency   Fast As Lightning   To Be Ninja Or Not To Be   Ninja Must Go Alone   The Godfather Of Soukaiya   Kirisute Gomen   Soukai Syndicate                         It will heal. Fujikido is like Batman at this point. Only that he still has a chance at life. Something Batman has difficulties with.   I really would like to know how it was when he met ninja grandpa Thanos and his ample hot granddaughter.        Does she actually get violated? My dick needs to know.    That was some great episode but is Dragon really gone for good?    YEEART!     Looks like it, but I suspect he will show up in flashbacks and maybe as a Force ghost.   Yukano a cutest    and maybe as a Karate ghost  Fixed that for you.     I think it's the one they put the most effort in so far.   Has there ever been a more visually offensive design choice than these neon green outlines?   I want to fuck her ample bust    SSY bugeyes.     not liking Trigger's art style     YEEART!!   lil b curse  thank you based god  http://sp.sportslist.com       what the fuck is this      SK:EV cameo when?        Son of a bitch! I finish my own list and refresh only to see this!  Well, at least now I know my translation was pretty much spot on.      They wouldn't do her ample bust justice. All the Senrans' in-game tits look smaller than the 2D art.    HOLY SHIT this OST is awesome  thank you OST-san       Euphonium anime character designs.    I feel like if I touched any of the Euphonium characters, my hands would be covered in grease.       What ninja speed!     I want to touch kumiko's hair.    It just kept getting better     Implying Fujikido and Shogo won't bro it out after having an intense fight right before.     I dunno, man. Ninjas must be slain, and unlike Yamocchan, he's not a cute girl.    Seems his goals have changed.  If Suicide=san can convince him he's changed his ways, perhaps a NINJA FRIENDSHIP can be established        she is so hnnng  need a sound webm of that scene badly        This guy seems scary.   Best cyberpunk in a decade.   Not like it has much competition, but yes, agreed.     in a decade   like tears... in rain.      I'm impartial to Un-Go, but it really is worth stressing that the cyberpunk aspect of Ninja Slayer is excellent. The acid rains, the corrupted government, the inhumane experiments (go read than LN translation if you haven't) - it all comes together in a very solid world. Sometimes you don't even care about the ninjas.    And dont forget the airships with propaganda and commercial advertizing.  And the crime and powerful syndicates.  And the city-scapes, as well as the Noir-settting at times.  fucking great.         I wish to be the chosen one who marries Koki and is allowed to penetrate the tightest, most delightful pussy on earth.  Nancy Lee figure when?   that whole fight  I need a new pair of sides    It's not that tight. Trust me.    Never  ;_;    <br/>   yukano's voiced by risa taneda  That explains why she sounds so cute.    YEEART!!    YEEART!   WASSHOI   Who?    You're a filthy liar who should consider seppuku to restore whatever tiny amount of honour he may once have had.    YEEART!!    A seiyuu with a very cute voice.    KUWAAAA   The YEART to end all YEARTs. 10/10 battle.   Hold the phone. Are people ACTUALLY still watching this monkey shit?    Why would I not watch the best anime of the season?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127184822  It's the truth.   Your face when?  You know shit is getting real.     Hold the phone. Are people ACTUALLY still baiting?     Oh please. Liking Ninja Slayer is LITERALLY a meme.     I was anticipating Dark Ninja-san for 11 episodes and his debut was glorious.    Sure thing bud.   English rocker, 'Nam veteran, Texan revolutionist, what next?    Says the guy posting old ass reaction images     PTSD Guy who helps homeless people   Daughter zoned?    Yukano is cute. Cute I tell you. Cute.   No, he wants him to take care of her by giving her the D   Dark ninja is kind of a bitch, isn't he?   And yet, her bust wasn't in the ED. I guess it was just too ample to properly fit the screen.   Based on what another anon said in a thread a few weeks ago,  "I AM BEATEN" is practically his catchphrase, so yeah, he kind of is.       Why is she crying?   Tears of happiness, especially because she probably thought it would be impossible to find an antidote.    Maybe her bust hurts.       Implying any of the OP animation will actually appear in the show    wwwww    LN Naraku Ninja is a God Warrior?    What is her purpose?  Koki and Nancy have been far more important thus far.     Her ample bust is her purpose.   I felt like this episode's ED was a bit worse than the others. What did you all think of it?    It was okay. The past couple ones haven't had any vocals though so it was a bit of a letdown.   I like how the old guy was basically, "naraku' a bitch, don't be a bitchs bitch."    all Nancy's done is repeatedly get almost raped     YEEART!    I've loved every OP, especially for how they relate to the tone and focus of the episode.  The return to Boris for this one after all the HAPPENING and Fujikido's realization that Darkninja was the one who killed his family back in the first episode felt like a nice bookend      You gay son? Shit was rockin     I haven't cared for any of these instrumental ones      English-translated Anime [AnimeRG] Ninja Slayer From ANIMATION 06 (Dual) 1080p [Phr0stY].mkv    Dub's out  English Yukano isn't as bad as English Koki I guess  also   manly tears of blood           Why is top down bottom up the best thing ever?   DEWA FUCKISHIMAS   Yeeart! Aaaargh! Yeeart! Aaaargh! Yeeart! Aaaargh! Yeeart! Aaaargh! Yeeart! Aaaargh!            YEEART!   Did he just abandoned the boobies to the gangbangers from all those helicopters after sensei told him to take care of her?   He probably lost trace of boobies and had no time to stick around looking for her.    this anime is getting dubbed right? cant wait to see how censored to shit it gets    There's a simuldub right now. Haven't heard anything about any censorship, though.    ARIGATO GOZAIMASU, Anon=SAN.  no artist on tags  NAMU AMIDA BUTSU!      Helicopters will wreck your shit, mate. Ninja Slayer went to go lose them and will probably search for cutie Yukano next episode.    Are those helicopters armed with JIGOKU NO HONOO? TN: JIGOKU NO HONOO are NINJA HELLFIRES.     No just Hydras.  I can see my old barracks in that pic.     No censorship. They've been swearing up a storm.   This fucking show.    JIGOKU NO HONOO are too expensive man, we're in the ninja recession.       Too bad he died anyway.    That mask transition was cool.  ED11 webm where?  Dewa, fakku shimasu    Ninja Slayer is going to look for her, and he won't like what he finds.     Tits quota.    Yukano's a communist?     I'd rather not say anything else, I've said too much already.  On a completely unrelated note, here's a Soukaiya ninja called Amnesia.       Rape? Drugs? Rapedrugs?    She really fits in Senran Kagura or something. Is her design supposed to resemble that kind of sexy anime ninjaboobs?     so Yukano get's AMNESIA somehow, probably helicopter related and get's evil'd? I don't think I like this development   she's too cute to become evil.      The soundtrack "Naraku Within" is bit different in this scene. I can hear some back vocal in this version. Is this just a mix or there's a proper title for this version?    I hope they don't brainwash the ample bust.    Is that from Ninja Slayer Kills?  Is Yukano even in it?       She is, it covers both Menace of Darkninja and Back In Black (the OP episode).   Does Nancy have more appearances?  Anyone know the band from this ep's ending?   Best one so far imo.     YEEART!    It's Boris, the one that performed ED 1.    She does, though maybe not in the anime.                   GWAAARGH!               Is Koki a slut?   Is the original material still ongoing?      Yes it does, and it's still being posted on the official Twitter account.    SAYONARA!!  *SOUND OF EXPLODING NINJA*      No, she's not.  Although I'd see her and Shogo/Suicide/Punk Ninja as a pair.       *action*  What happened to this board?      Thanks. They're not too bad.  Different, but in a good way.     Koki sucks dicks to make ends meet.  YEEART compilation for ep 6 of the dub:  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bNF<wbr>BBIrZf7E</wbr>  [ ]     YEEEAAAAART    since when was this shit dubbed     It's NARAKU WITHIN FROM ANIMATION, track 1 of the just-released anime soundtrack, rather than the CD drama soundtrack.     Didn't mean to quote. Anyway, been dubbed since about six weeks ago. Ninja Slayer is Vegeta.    Just realised they reused scenes from EP 4 in this episode   Cute/10.    They use that animation a lot.you can see it in ep6 and other episodes as well    It took a bit longer than expected, but part 2 is done, and we finally get lots of Yamoto. You can read it over here  .  I got even less time to proof-read it, so let me know if some typos got through. Also, there is a good reason for Yamoto's "Me is" quirk, which I'll explain later today if this thread is still here.     "...Doomo. Ah..." Silver Karasu nods. "I am Kagi Tanaka." Kagi Tanaka is an alias of his. That is also the name he used while buying the house. "Doomo", the girl returns the nod. "Me is Yamoto Koki."   Shit, you know it got real when he had the accompany explosion and double fist greeting.  WASHOI   I thought Ninja Slayer first met DarkNinja at the oil painter arc and they had this fight in midair. They didn't even bothered with aisatsu at that time. What happened after that fight?     That's actually from later on, but it can stand alone.     Is Dark Ninja going to get a figma/revo/scale/whatever?     Dark Ninja is badass     But it directly mentions Hugeshuriken and pals going to attack the dragon dojo  or did the anime add that?       Daily reminder that this show is bad and you should feel bad.    YEEART!!    SAYANORAAAAAAAAAAAAA     best anime of the season  This is what TriggerNiggers ACTUALLY believe.      Darkninja also greets his opponents politely and respectfully like Ninja Slayer, you know he's super hardcore.  Shame he went down like the Hindenberg, though.       Go back to sleep Zoidberg. You still didn't get that jelly off you.    On my second watch I realised the dragon on Sensei's blanket looks like it's gasping and dying. Which reflects his condition pretty well.    No explosion or Sayanara says he's alive.    I think part of the story was told in the OP. Fujikido went full-possession by Naraku Ninja and attempted to kill Yukano, but since Naraku Ninja is weak vs Real Ninjas (like Sensei and Yukano), Sensei managed to beat him back to his senses and Fujikido begged for forgiveness once he realised what he did.    Yeah, I know he's alive. Just saying he went down like a chump, although he was totally schooling NS until Sensei taught him how to properly use the power of Naraku Ninja.  Maybe I should have said "went down like the Titanic" instead.      I really want to see this and the training arc.    How come Koki doesnt have a problem with her ninja soul,then? In fact, she seems strong as hell as a ninja even through all she did was kill some rapist thugs and fight Sonic boom for a bit.    Ninja Slayers soul is the ultimate soul m8 You cannot tame it quickly     Her Ninja Soul is calmer when compared to Naraku who is the anti-ninja ninja.      Naraku Ninja is not a single ninja, but the conglomeration of countless vengeful spirits of people murdered by ninjas in the past. Since they were killed by all kinds of karate they can see through the techniques of most ninjas, and since they are the embodiment of a hateful grudge against ninjas, they can "burn" a Ninja Soul and cripple a Ninja in combat. I'm also assuming that they can predict a ninja's actions by the soul within them and target his weak points in a similar manner.  However, this sort of hatred needs a very strong mind to control. And it is useless against real ninja (like Sensei) because Naraku has never seen Sensei's technique before.<br/>        Naraku Ninja is just a dick, that's honestly all. Shi Ninja enjoys killing, sure, but she respects that Koki's mind and body belong to Koki.    Yamocchan is still a weak-ass girl who has to be trained the basics of karate. As for her ninja soul, we just don't know what it wants: I assume if she gets as close to its goal as Naraku does to slaying ninjas, she might lose control of it, too.    That's actually a good explanation.         So cool, So very cool, I'm icing over here.         According to the Ninja Slayer wiki there are three main classes of Ninja Souls; Lesser, Greater and Archninja. Nobody cares about the first two classes but Archninja all have individual names and are very powerful; i.e. their souls are worthy of bearing a ninja name, like Sonic Ninja, Punk Ninja, Shi Ninja, etc.   This is different from the Soukai-bestowed codename like Suicide, Sonic Boom, Earthquake, etc.   Shogo (Punk Ninja/Suicide) is an archninja, so is Koki (Shi Ninja). Ninja Slayer is just the name given to Fujikido Kenji who bears the Naraku Ninja soul, which is definitely archninja class.  Something was mentioned about a mythical Legendary Ninja class, but I don't think any have appeared in the story yet.          Yeah, he's just a mass of hatred. Shi Ninja is more controllable because... eh, I don't know. She just wants to live again, I guess.    Koki has little to no combat experience, so she got blindsided by Sonic Boom. She was putting Sonic Boom on the defensive until he had to order a clone yakuza mass attack on her.   However, she has a strong bond to Asari=SAN, so maybe she can use that to control Shi Ninja if it runs wild.         Darn. Those wikis are getting more and more accurate.    It's the original japanese wiki, which covers a whole lot of stuff. I just read it off there. However, my theory about Naraku Ninja was proven right when I read it.   If you can read moon, you might want to check it out.  http://wikiwiki.jp/njslyr/?%A5%CB%A<wbr>5%F3%A5%B8%A5%E3%A5%B9%A5%EC%A5%A4%<wbr>A5%E4%A1%BC%A4%C8%A4%CF%A1%A9</wbr></wbr>        An interesting point to note, from Last Girl Standing novel:  This is the Wind Ninja Clan's greater ninja.   I'll give you an instruction. To seal Sonic Karate, stay at the one-inch distance from him. At that distance, he will be scared of his own shockwave. This tactic will render most of his skills useless, just like it has led to the Wind Ninja Clan's demise in the past.   This basically means that the ninja clans destroyed each other, which means that some of the lesser/greater ninja souls might have become part of Naraku.        Sadly I can't into moon.     It would certainly explain why Naraku knows so much about their techniques. The anime doesn't seem to touch on this much, but even in the fight against Beholder he mentions that Beholder uses Kanashibari, states that he's a Snake Clan member, and talks down to Beholder like an old guy scolding a kid on his lawn.    Google translate will let you spoil yourself quite adequately too...      Who is your favorite loli?   Illya.   don't you mean shota? You can see his balls right there.    loli   clearly balls  you are the reason why middle eastern countries hate us...      That's a puffy vulva, you fucking imbecile, and together with loli it's the greatest thing to be drawn.    I want to touch her puffy vulva.      puffy  balls is balls anon, you will learn to accept your true feelings......some day.       ........   Kill yourself     Vanilla  Is she too big to be called loli?   Every loli. I even wait in front of a local school. Man, Gradeschoolers are the best.   There are simply too many outstanding lolis it's impossible to choose.   Cute trap dude.     loli     Let's post all of them!  Posting #1 on my list: Loli Nanoha.   Now a MILF she really doesn't count anymore. But hardcore fans of her series will always reminisce about how she shot this spin-off into fame in her first series.         I heard she adopted so she isn't really a MILF   VN Illya &gt;   I'm not really in a mood to argue since adoption = becoming a parent = becoming a mom. And since MILF means "Mom I love to fuck", it fits.   Second we have the girl who everyone loved to hate recently, just because she isn't Nanoha:  Vivio         Unless she pops out a baby from that slit between her legs then she hasn't earned the MILF title.    Every vampire loli in existence.    there can be only one     cannot unsee     wrong one        <br/>       unfinished    DA BEASTO     Whatever  My #3      Try making the outer curve of vulva less visible. And delete the outline on the lower part while you're at it.    Keeping this thread alive with more best lolis    this       Mikan         What? This is a loli thread, if you hadn't noticed or something.    My waifu.    They made a fucking movie of that trash? And yeah, she is real cute.  I want her to curse my dick if you understand my implication-      Surprised she wasn't posted yet.   Would louise count?    I'm not sure if I like her smiling like that.    She hides her motherly side underneath a layer of domination and sexual deviance, but she is still good at heart.   Good. No Hestia bullshit in this thread.   Don't summon it    Papi of course!      Good vampire loli, awful series.     They made a fucking movie of that trash?  Yes, as well as several LNs, manga, a VN for girls and a second season that will air this fall.     How? Didn't it flop hard?    Oh I hope they're all about Anna, the only good thing left in the show since you know, the other thing worth a fuck committed suicide.      But that's a man    Not when he has twintails he's not!    Thouars pls    Every Rie Kugimiya Tsundere counts.    /a/ is my favorite loli.     We are all little girls here!  Love you too, anon.      I'd say they're about 2 inches too big from being lolis but that's just me.     The anime sold decently from what I remember. Also it was planned as a multimedia project from the beginning.   Unfortunately not since some of the LNs and manga focus on the other clans, but she got a few cute moments in the red clan's manga at least.       fucking love puffy lolis.    You say it like Nanoha and Fate can't and don't use shapechanging magic in bed the same way that Vivio does in combat, but backwards.    Would pet the puffy vulva   What's a loli?   Someone small and worth protecting.     meme girl     Girls with a prepubescent body type (short, small breasts, round face, etc.)     After all these years and despite me having a small Shinobu phase, she is still my Lolifu.       Diet CP    Read a small summary of this. Sounds nice actually, will give it a look    You're just seeing what you want, homo.    Evil bitch    Best GJ-bu. Though I can't think of any other series with high school lolis.      It's actually really good, It's a shame they only made anime for the first part of the manga though.     And even that was barely allowed     Pubescent lolis a shit     Let's all love Lain    Dead loli    Sexy little girls    That's some sick shit. Interesting.     They even forced the girl who was writing the manga to change the ending. It's a shame, i feel 12 y o Rin was ripe enough for love and marriage.     Oppai loli ftw.     I wonder if it's even possible for a 10 y o girl to have such massive tits.     Oppai lolis are the best.    underrated post    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/<wbr>18291739</wbr>     killing the oppai loli      no pics  The fuck is this shit     An adorable pile of lewd     They were probably full of stretch marks and saggy as fuck.      I want to have sex with Rin so badly  She is one of the girls who turned me into lolicon        She turned an entire generation of 4channers into Lolicons.     100 posts in  You never fail to disappoint me, /a/    http://www.jprasurg.com/article/S17<wbr>48-6815%2808%2900015-6/abstract  At the bottom says...  Purchase access to this article   $31.50 for 24 hours  Why...     </wbr>    I don't think she is classified as a loli, but I'm no expert.       alternate ending  More info?     Fucking Jews    Pubescent lolis are pretty shitty    Regardless of that i would've still like to see       She is 12, so she is still a Loli.     She wanted Rin and Daisuke to consummate their love when she was 12, however editorial pressure forced her to write the ending we know          But enough talk pomf at you!    Don't forget about Neptune!     /v/ says Nep isn't a loli because she isn't a prepubescent   Fuck them.      Next time you have an opinion, can you please slam your head between a door and it's frame?    Fucking newfags can't even recognize Illya, do an hero and record it for, us Summer bitch boy    What a cute neptune!     lurking/posting on /v/   NepNep is always cute.       /v/ has better lolis than /a/     Lies.    Barely. Too tall IMO.   My "You have to be this tall to be a loli" chart is not saved in my phone.   suffering        Only if Visual Novels are games   Age and height people are here, time to bail on the thread  Rika-chan, now and forever.   Hebe, pedo, it doesn't matter. I'm still considered a creep for having feelings for a young looking girl. Then again, I don't fucking care.     It's about proportions Mikan is the upper boundary of loli development  and yet also the most perfect loli     Where is my oniichan? https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ujE<wbr>X3Fsnipo</wbr>  [ ]    Do we have body stat for Nep? I can't decide if she's really kid's size.   Someya Shiiko https://vndb.org/c4482           manga canceled   forgotten by /a/  I'm so sad I could die         My feelings are that loli is modern slang and is open to interruption. What I some might consider a loli, I may not, but the character still probably has loli-like characteristics.  Any way you slice it, I have an overt interest in young girls.     Oh baby look at all those tags    Good taste. Vanilla is the girl that turned me onto dandere.    Its the truth    Why does she go down in size?    No it isn't.    How tight is Uni?   Mikan is as loli as I get   To maximize sex appeal.     146 cm   Mirai from Senran Kagura is 150 cm yet everyone considers her a loli.        She's the tightest.     Posting a shit loli   You're not really convincing,      Tight enough you can't slip a pinky in.    All the better to break her.    Let's see... 146 cm? She's a loli.     Fuck off back to /v/. We love all our lolis here.    My raging diamonds would kindly ask for sauce     Horay? I honestly don't know how to take this in. I guess I'll embrace my inner pedo.      Have you tried the magic source buttons? Because I did, faggot.    Got nothing, hence why I asked faggot, I'm not autistic     Fuck, why did that manga have to get canned?     Why is Uni so fucking sexy?    I guess you better try harder.  As a hint, one of the source buttons provides more source buttons for you to try.      But the title is right there on the pic itself. Surely that is enough for you to google it?    She's a better version of Noire. Plus her flatness and petite frame.     149 cm  She's 2 cm away from being an old hag.  Good thing she shrinks when changing form.       thumbnail looks like she has a dick poking out    I swear, Tsunako is a fucking wizard.    I cant read Nipponese and Ive been googling Mint Varen for 20 minutes with no results whatsoever    Was there any doubt?  I'd smooch on his lolis' tummies forever if I can.       Not knowing GA      his      I apologise for not having watched every anime to have ever existed     Why are loli artists usually women?    Well that's a surprise, I honestly didn't know.    GA is pretty famous, watch more shit.    I would happily if I knew what GA was    Because they can draw from memory of their own bodies plus not as creepy as compared to a guy drawing it.  She wants to be 2D. I don't blame her.      You don't need to watch every anime to know, you just need to have watched enough to be aware of the prominent or popular ones.  For instance, not a fan of books is no excuse for not knowing famous titles and authors.      I found it pretty easily. I searched "Mint" and lolicon in sadpanda, then filtered to only doujins. Found it.   Illya &lt;3   Tokyo Mew Mew it looks like.    https://vndb.org/v860 enjoy.       You posted her.    Ren-chon is my daughteru, but Mashiro is a more fun character. Best loli.   this manga just finished.   that ending thou       Best loli.  At being shit?     Nep is really sexy. I like to imagine she isn't wearing anything underneath that hoodie of hers.    It's pretty obvious that she isn't , well besides panties.   All vampire lolis are great, but this one is by far the best.   Yeah that's what I meant, I wish she was actually nopan in game though.     I wish she was actually nopan in game though.  Overkill, m8. You might as well ask for a whole scene where she's totally naked.     No one gets aroused at Nep's naked body anyway so they should go for it.    Except us.    I don't get aroused at a little girl's naked body,   I love you, /a/!   I don't believe you one bit while posting in a loli thread.    How about a big girl?    I'm here for loli's cuteness. Lolis aren't sexy    Not 10, but close enough  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=559<wbr>1R3f6dBQ</wbr>  [ ]      Shut your trap, furrybait.     They're both and more. That's what makes them so amazing.      furry     Sure you are.  I bet you don't find this loli sexy, right?       boobs that are approx 10kg     That's really cute,both the lolis and underwear, I don't feel the "sexiness" though.   Not really, its just a cute loli in the beach        That's probably because you're gay.     How's this one anon?    Very cute but she should be embarrassed her skirt is see-through.       Prepubescent   having breasts        Do you have a link to this image set      Nipples are part of the breasts, if they have nipples then indeed they do have breasts.    this thread lacks vampire lolis    Hebe is still loli in most cases.      best lolis    Fake loli a shit    Yes, I know.    d'awww    Too bad she isn't going to end up with her beloved probably.  Maybe her and ragna will end up dying together or something.      with her beloved   Platinum?      I hate you Mikan, burn in hell!      She looks like a goblin now   When I get down to it, it is really eternal lolis in general for me. Eternal lolis are the best.   That whole series man.     Eternal lolis are the best  Eternal lolis are the only choice, otherwise it's a few years of bliss followed by a lifetime of sadness. Only the eternal loli is free from the terrible disease called "growing up" that afflicts all the other lolis.    I want to lick a loli's  armpit    I want to like a loli's  navel     Kuro &gt; Illya, but I don't know if I can say Kuro is my favorite loli overall. She's definitely my favorite loli for sexual purposes, but then again she was created to be the show's sex toy to begin wtih.    Kuro is unsexy    are you gay    No Kuro just isn't sexy    you are gay   Only correct answer.   sounds gay to me    me too   best loli hentai anime ?   probably nothing      Ah I remember this one. She has really good hentai, I nutted ultra fast the first time I seen the one where she's sleeping and some guy undressed her PJs and masturbated to her naked body and then came onto her pussy.   Giant loli!    She has really good hentai    Pretty much anything except your choice.  Please remember to love all loli equally!  Here is a trap loli along with Illya. Big balls are big balls and this is way beyond puffy vulva. It's at the big balls level.  Miu.   Who is that even? Please don't post irrelevant lolis.     HA HA HA   Fuck off, casual.        don't you mean shota? You can see his balls right there.   That picture was drawn with Kuro having balls instead of just puffy vulva. That's why they are so big. The artist made it clear that when you see it, you'll know it is well beyond puffy vulva level.         Now it's like an optical illusion for me. One time it looks like puffy vulva and another it looks like trap gay bulge. Maybe it's on purpose to pander to both tastes?     Eternal lolis are just oldhags in a young girl skin, it's because the time is brief that we can appreciate it.    Prisma Illya is the best Illya.   Fuck no.  Your loli, in example, looks like some autistic retard with down syndrome. She deserves no love.       hating on tinkle  You must be new around here.       She's λΔ    rude    No, I am not. I've been here since 2008.   Probably Ilya and/or Kuro. Evangeline, Shinobu and Miyu are great too. Mikan would probably be up there too, but I consider her too tall/developed to be one.   The lesbian kind with puffy vulvas.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127201790  Please leave your shitposting on /v/.    ロリと可愛いは正義   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127201790  :^)   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127201790   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127201790  Is this your new tactic radfem anon?     11 years old   Too sexy for an 11 year old       new tactic  All feminists have ever done throughout history is bitch and scream at people till they got their way.      Every vampire loli in existence.  amen.     Why are bloomers so great?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127201074  It is a sexuality. You are probably a hetrosexual teleophile; would it be fair to assume you have a sex life? Not something I'd be willing to put a wager on.    because they're the purest type of undergarment    Fate/Zero Illya    I'd say the same about Nana and her being 4 but I'd be lying.     Nana giving birth   And that is how my pregnant loli fetish started      What if I like 'em all?     not as creepy   More than that, it's just plain HAWT.      Better question, is it even possible to have the body chemistry that causes such things without also having a massive libido?     to the point of causing physical impairment and respiratory compromise   ;_;      But Rin said it was too big.    What is it?     ld   ?      Her name is Lambdadelta   Mitsuba is my pudgy mistress.   What's that supposed to mean?      34   Eyebrows       I don't get it.

Not shave off completely, just trim them a bit as she is crying.    show up for 1 episode   get wrecked   forgotten for all eternity   Literary garbage bin is suffering        Chaotic neutral   befrendable   The moment something clicks in her cakebrain, she'll turn you in to taffee      Alright, I get why Rokkenjima was shrouded in the catbox thus resulting in a whole bunch of magic and whatnot, but why did 1999(or 1998?) have magic? Is it because we saw things from anges perspective? I realize that it was needed in ep 4 to explain the way magic works, but ep 6 and 8? You have the switching between featherine and the actual writer woman (forgot her name) and constant switching between magic and reality. It feels like a different kind of magic than the ones used in 1986.   She was fun to have around.     Speaking of magic, is hanyuu featherine and has hanyuu completely lost it, or was she insane from the start? Kind of a coincidence when rika was about to lose all hope and die mentally that K1 somehow magically remembered a memory he should not have from a previous fragment, even though that had never, in a 100+ repetitions happened before. Coincidence or divine intervention?   Why don't you like old hags, /a/?  They're called christmas cakes  But i love em, theyre the peerfect breeding material   Got any source? Tried various times, and all it leads to is /r9k/, with no leads. Sorry for being a faggot    The artist is Redrop faggot.   I personally prefer Christmas cakes to MILFs. But they're both great.   i thought it was the same    Cakes are 25+ with no kids.    I Smell NTR     like MILFs   don't like NTR   What a terrible mixture.       Not him, but I just like older women. If it has to be a MILF, why can't she be divorced or a widow? Why go through the trouble of introducing a husband purely so he can be cheated on? Divorce is (way too fucking) common nowadays, you can easily use it as an excuse to have a single MILF.  What the fuck is it with the Nips and NTR?       they're aroused by shame?     I don't give a shit about cheating when there isn't this perverse and obvious sexual thrill from watching some guy's life shatter.  It's attention better spent on the actual sex      only if they're over 24 and unmarried   and i do   because of this          Yeah. I guess I wouldn't care about a throwaway line like 'Oh I hope my husband doesn't find out~'. But NTR just makes me feel bad for everyone involved.   My favorite.  Best MILF ?   it is the most popular fetish among betas and nips are genetically beta    Is Step-MILF a thing?     I guess I wouldn't care about a throwaway line like 'Oh I hope my husband doesn't find out~'  Why? That line has to actively be thought up and written. You could just as easily NOT mention a husband. In fact, that's even fucking easier.     I don't know. Give it that 'forbidden lust' appeal or something. I don't care for that stuff but I can deal with it when it's that minor, but it rarely is. I just don't get the fetish or why it's so widespread.   Old hags are not cute.   Do you get to fuck them all in the VNs?    Yes.    Cool.    I guess I will play the VNs, but not because of this.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127198389  Makeup, photos hop and plastic surgery   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127198389   Demi moore was a shit even as young woman, there are better example.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127198389  is that picture supposed to look good      well a christmas-cake marrying a man with a child might be it, there's actually a manga that revolves around a story of one living with a NEET    when's the release date anon ?

Not liking MILFs and disliking NTR  Shit taste     I want to bag a baabaa   hags are gross   MILF &gt; lolis Hotness &gt; cuteness     Is this anime worth watching if you're into older grills tenderly loving younger men?   IMHO (2D) MILFs generally aren't hot as much as they're mature and respectable.      Cakes are for vanilla Milfs are for NTR    Sad but true.    Perfect.    Not even the best 2hag     sauce on this cake? Google didn't help     But she's not a mom.   Unmarried old hags are mirracle of  dunya and akhirat.      http://exhentai.org/g/318606/5ab936<wbr>a200/</wbr>      Hush now, making widows happy is a perfectly acceptable form of lovemaking and doesn't have anything to do with NTR.   http://exhentai.org/s/8c420ae687/75<wbr>0511-126  Widow discovers SM mags, gets frisky with trap maido. Happy story for those who like em.  </wbr>  I have a soft spot for cake teachers.   Widows are honorary Christmas Cakes. New Year's Eves?  I knew a widow called Eve. This is weird.       I'm really happy about figuring out the artist by the eyes and the blushing type alone.    all females are for NTR that is why you don't go near them     Widow milfs are top-tier; all the benefits of a milf without the infidelity aspect.

New Year's Eve is already used to describe single women 31 and older.   Year End Soba.

Also, betafags chime in if you dream of a cool beautiful office lady dominating you after work.     Why can't cakes win more often? I'm not asking for a lot, maybe one or two more anime, three or four manga. I know we have VNs, but even then incest seems more common than cake routes.    http://exhentai.org/g/779073/1d661<wbr>7bf09/</wbr>  i beg to fucking differ a large onee-chan is fine too http://exhentai.org/g/373352/fd04f9<wbr>ce60/</wbr>      All of my love for Kaede.

Chiba Toushirou&gt;Takasugi Kou    She's gorgeous. Been thinking about picking up Idolm@ster just for her but as far as I can tell she's not really that prominent in it.    MILFs calling themselves "old lady", not in the "Do you really like an old lady like me?" kind of way, but in the desperate older woman who hasn't had sex in years and is degrading herself for any cock that offers itself to her way   alternatively, young fit men with older, MILF women, constantly calling her "old lady" to degrade her    Ara ara, come wash my tail anon-kun.

Iri is MILES better than Illya    What?    You and your loli cancer, take this the loli thread.     I don't know what your definition of loli is, but  isn't even DFC.     How the fuck is Mamizou a loli?     I think you guys need both your eyes an brain checked if you consider this a "grown" woman.      she has a tail, cat ears and claw   no furry   looks like a teen   no loli   no denial         Full retard.

Who's this faggot trying to ruin the thread?    Don't pick on a invalid anon.    You do realize that milf has nothing to do with age, right? It's whether or not she's a mother, which she is.  Also   Akiko   Not best milf   Your shit taste has reached glorious heights.          Milf isn't a body type. Pic related is a milf.      Not with idiot western media. To them she's loli     You do realize that milf has nothing to do with age, right    Of course it does  Even on porn sites and everywhere else people don't care is she is a mother or not they always associate milf with middle-age woman.  Don't be stupid anon.          I hope your trolling. Are all lolicons this retarded?     That's a cougar, dumbass.    She is a loli, loli is a body type. She's a loli milf.     The best.     Hahahahahahaha   NO       She's old enough to have high school daughter.    Fuck off, retard.      tfw like MILFs and NTR  Literally the best combination      It doesn't matter idiot people just associate milf with older woman of course its based on age as much as apearance.  And I'm sorry but a mom with the same face as her underage daughter, that doesn't hold any credibility.      Stay angry and stupid, it suits you.   I can't help but feel that this thread is filled with crossboarders.      /a/ people only browse /a/   Get original anon crossboarder is barely a meme it doesn't mean anything     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127207446  Oh sweet! I just got promoted!     tfw /a/ won't stop shitting up threads on other boards and then hide behind "4chan is for anime" excuse when called out       I Smell NTR   implying wives don't give their husbands erotic pictures of them when they go on long business trips   It's like you don't even have a wife waifu.       Damnit /a/, I just fapped last week.   The overlap between interests is huge on 4chan. The population liking anime has always been large, and half the boards here existed specifically to keep off-topic shit out of /a/ and other Japanese related boards.  It's not /a/ shitting up anything, the same way it's not /pol/ ruining threads with politics. This is 4chan. Anime gets posted. On the other hand, people will argue about politics anywhere, anytime. It's not /pol/. Of course, posting /a/ or /pol/ or /v/ or /etc/ specific memes in a board is off topic shitposting, but that's a different issue.      I can't even understand what you're trying to say. Please use some punctuation.    I love that one. "This board is for us so leave" when all they do is post moe garbage.    Okay lets settle it   Takasugi Kou Kai Hiroyuki Hidemaru Fue Shunjou Shuusuke Toguchi Masaya Tatsunami Youtoku Chiba Toushirou  Who draws them better? Throw in anyone else you feel qualifies.              It's not easy on phone keyboard. I'm sure you can work your brain enough to read it good.    Would you a tanned milf on the beach?   Because they're shit. Now fuck off.   When was the last time you cried during an anime?   Watched Diary of Anne Frank again recently that is pretty sad. You know she is a jew.   I cried at the end of pic related  End of SoreMachi.  Plastic Memories tomorrow   only faggots crying     This.     The end of death parade.   Never, I'm too jaded lol   anon, this is /a/, you dont need to lie    Glad im not the only one  An anon told me they cried after finishing Punchline earlier     Had a few moments while watching Ippo Rising. Teared up pretty often while watching Your Lie in April.    I cried at the second half of ep10 too. Something about how jarring the mood changes are helped a lot    Ding. Still not entirely sure if they were happy or sad tears.   At the end of toradora, the time i lost watching that crap is never going to come back  I cry very easily to the point of it being ridiculous. So the last time was today.  I was watching Ore Monogatari.    I kinda teared up during Plastic Memories last week. To be fair, I also thought it was the last episode.  Felt like crying a bit during the Pleiades finale last night too.    I don't cry often but I kinda wish I did, it actually feels good. I don't remember the last anime, it was not this season.   You cry when you see shit?    I want to hug you too, anon. Too much fucking drama     Hah, I need to check this out. Looks like this 'Anne Frank' girl has waifu potential.    What?   I cry intermittently and without warning when watching Aria. Nothing particularly triggers it, the tears just fall out of my face.  It's like an emotional hypobaric chamber, and all my sadness, anger, and frustrations just boil to the surface.      This.    Yesterday  Emotional scenes always make me cry    I don't cried because of the anime itself, I cry because it reminds me of what I don't have.  When finishing Origination yesterday.    This.      btw I'm a girl    Oreimo.  Embarrassing, right?    when the chick in hhh triple ecchi got pregnant and had the baby.  Who /specialsnowflakeedgemasterthatcan'<wbr>tcry/ here?</wbr>  Yesterday to K-On!!'s last episode.  Sae and Hiro graduation OVA  I watered up a little bit while watching Welcome to the NHK, and at the end of Initial D when they had Rage Your Dream playing.   I cried while reading the novels and then while rewatching the anime during episode 14, 15 and 16.      What a fag, if anything you are suppose to laugh.     Shed a few stray tears earlier today when I watched the finale of Houkago no Pleiades. Beautiful series. Mahou Shoujo shows make me cry more frequently than any other genre, not sure why.  I'm a grown man.      S1 was quite funny.    More like grown manchild. A real grown man don't cry.     Oh, OK then. Thanks for correcting me.     I cried a little when Haru was suffering at the end of Free s2     Crying over magical Subaru girls     I've never cried...Probably teary eyed with OP a couple times.   Code Geass had me tearing up near the end. Never flatout cried though.    Yep. I'm glad I didn't dismiss it as a worthless car commercial. It was an excellent show. Worth watching for the astrophysics porn alone.     Not to mention it's last series by Gainax until who-knows-when. Yes, I also shed some tears there.    Where exactly to you guys even draw the line between crying and tearing up?  For me, it's officially crying territory if a tear streams down my face. Even if it's only one and I'm not really sobbing.  I feel like some people define crying as bawling like a baby in a fetal position or something.      I am more prone to crying while watching anime, while i'm stoned. Any other fellows anons, experience the same thing ?   Episode 1 of Ninja Slayer.   The Archer and Rin scene in this last episode. Even my mom teared up and she's a filthy secondary.   I consider it crying even if my eyes just water.    Was it the part with Suna in the hospital?    During the last ep of Gatchaman Crowds. I just wished shit in this world were not as bad as they are and could be solved more easily.      Watching Fate with your mum.  Anon I....       Well yes, but I actually teared up when Yamato got all close to Takeo on the recent episode.   When I rewatched Madoka. That series is one of the few I've seen where it has more emotional impact on a second viewing.   NHK had the same impact on me.     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=trr<wbr>oxGoaenI</wbr>  [ ]  which reminds me i have to rewatch the series now.    zankyou no terror bro moments hit home for some reason   When Caesar died in Jojo  I've never cried to anime, but KEY VNs usually do it for me. AIR was so sad I almost felt physically hurt, I don't even like to remember it.   Made me cry just as much as when I read the VN.   Watching the Steins;Gate movie about half an hour ago. Before that, when watching the PunchLine finale about 6 hours ago.  I cry all the time, I think there's something wrong with me.    All the time. The shit quality of anime brings tears to my eyes. Also every cryfest like Keyshit, Anohana gets me cause I'm a big pansy. I cry at everything basically.    Wow damn your mum has terrible taste in anime.     I got absolutely destroyed by the second ep of sotsugyou hen.  I tear up reasonably often, not at sad moments but at moments that I think are really good or emotionally impactful. So I guess crying out of happiness or something? But  was the last time I genuinely cried because I was sad. The entire last season, hell, most of Aria was beautiful.  I cried Steins;Gate, teared up during Eva, and got sad during LAIN. I'm eternally crying inside because a show I really liked isnt ever going to get a second season.   tfw season final week   tfw gonna cry at least five times this weekend   The ride never ends ;_;      I have an idea. If you mention what it is, one of us will dutifully tell you why it's shit and free you from your eternal struggle.    Because he waited until the autistic girl was half dead already to fuck her?    You wont be able to convince me that Yuyushiki is shit, anon. I'm a rational human being.   Episode 9 of YuYuYu Maybe it's just because I have five younger siblings.   I get teary eyed pretty quickly when it comes to anime,but anything else and I'm cold as ice. Just today I felt empty and teary eyed during the punchline ending.  I was fine watching the anime, then I played through the VN. I cried like a bitch at least 3 times   At the ending of angel beats, that made me tear up a bit.   Straight up lost it when Illya started talking about how Heracles was like a father to her.   It didn't hurt this much when the played the VN. Why?    A few minutes ago when I rewatched iDOLM@STER episode 20.  Fuko disappearing.  Then she reappeared as a joke character and I dropped it.      not episode 15    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qiN<wbr>RO5H3AfI</wbr>  [ ]  Ashita no Joe ending  Some months ago during  Free .  i cried like a bitch when kaiji narrated that everyone's actually on the narrow bridge in the competitive society  Grave of the fireflies...  I cried just now because my allergies are so bad.  I only ever get close when I rewatch something for some reason.  I think it has to do with knowing whats coming and setting myself up to be sad or something.  Happened with both Texhnolyze and Bebop most recently.       Plastic memories gets good? I dropped it ep5.   During episode 265 of Gintama.   It's going exactly where everyone expected it was going, for better or worse.    When KinMosa ended    No, it got worse.   An absolute shitshow which will try to save itself with a sad finale.  and I will still cry anyway. fucking japan       I haven't watched the last episode yet, so it's still airing in my heart.    It was very average. No musical by the way.    Yeah, they cockteased us with the end of Ep11 and then delivered a wow it's fucking nothing finale  I want my money back      This.  Season 3 never ;_;    Today. Cowboy Bebop Ep10.   Got hit with the ex gf feels. inb4 &gt;3dpd     Every last episode of a comfy SoL.  got teary when I watched Shirobako, that was about a month ago  When Chihayafuru S2 ended and I know it won't get S3. ;___;  Almost today with the end of Houkago no Pleiades.  ;_;  Its not an anime, but  when Bing Bong died in Inside Out     What's with these faggots    Yesterday.  End of Gosick.  This thread is full of pussies.   waltz in bashir ping pong  And this beautiful thing https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rCd<wbr>MVkVR-WY</wbr>  [ ]        Same here. Especially since the threads were so good   Anohana i think.    muh poor jews   David Irving is right. The Anne Frank story is another kike fraud.      Illya heart surgery    Surely got sad or nostalgic few times, but I haven't cried once because of a fucking anime.  There's one movie that got me to cry though and it's The Shawshank Redemption     I'd always managed to hold it together before. But I cried like a little bitch at this.   Same, I was on the brink of sheding a tear    Aria the Animation ep 12.  Flashback   Symphony insert song   Farewell, my Avvenire   Rainbow -acoustic ver.-   They just dropped all the bombs at once.         hibike yesterday, that episode felt really good.   Yesterday at the end of Houkago no Pleiades.   I don't know. I almost cried when Renchon cried in NNB.  I used to cry to every drama I watched but I guess I've grown up or something.    I dont know how you can possibly not cry to this   Name of girl in pic?   The only correct answer.   Rewatched this masterpiece recently, still gets me every time.    Oy vey.    HnK had loads of these great moments.    I cried too but out of laughter, even though I knew Kirino was going to win the ending came unexpectedly in both the LN and anime.     Reading this.   It's feels weird seeing how vulgar it is compared to most of the medium, but at the same time it makes the entire thing feel more real and heartfelt.    Angel Beats, I will never watch it again due to the emotional impact it left on me.  That end scene with Kanade disappearing was just too much     2 episodes left for me. God damn last time I cried was on little busters!    Boku no fuck off. First image in google   Teared up a litte when that faggot MC was overworking himself for the sake of shitty tsundere. I cry easily when someone's hardwork for others goes unnoticed then it hits them and all the emotions. I teared up when best girl/boy Suna was suffering in oremonogatari.  You know when that guy takes the blame or gets hated by something he didn't do but doesn't bitch about it and that ungrateful bitch finally notices it. Yeah that shit really hits me hard.   At  I got teary, but the last time I really cried was back in January when I marathoned Sakamichi no Apollon.   &gt;when they cry on the roof of the hospital   &gt;when they're all reunited at the end       Cried like a little bitch. Manly tears were shed. Also Angel Beats!   Episode 10 of Angel Beats!  That shit hit me hard.       https://<span>youtu.be/RB8dPFgzrTU  [ ]  This fight always gets me.     My updated list.  5cm/s Angel's Egg Aria (several episodes, mostly Origination) Binchou-tan (first episode) Dennou Coil (last 3 episodes) Diebuster (final scene) Disappearance (final scene) Gunbuster (final scene) Grave of the Fireflies Haibane Renmei (second half) Kaiba (Chroniko arc) Katanagatari (last 2 episodes) Madoka (TV, final scene) Mawaru Penguindrum (final scene) Monogatari S2 (Snail's farewell) Mushishi (several episodes) Natsume Yujinshou (several episodes) Princess Tutu (final scene) Rozen Maiden (Hinaichigo's death) Serial Experiments Lain (final scene) Sora No Woto (several episodes) Sora no Method (first episode) Soremachi (last episode) Squid Girl (first mini-Ika episode) Tamayura (several episodes) Texhnolyze (last episode) Usagi Drop (first episode) YKK Yuri Kuma (last episode)                                 why would you cry at that? it wasnt sad or anything? just curious   This scene man. I never asked for these tears when I first started with this series The manga is better overall, but the anime just pulled my heartstrings with this episode better than the same scene in the manga.    might as well put a hashtag on that    It was horrible. Once Setsuko started hallucinating, i just started bawling. I'm so glad I live alone   The chapter after Ai's death, when it showed how dead Ikuru was without her. Jesus christ, i haven't cried that hard in a long fucking time. We knew it was coming, it was said in the beginning that both would die, but I still wasn't ready for it when it happened. Thank god they didn't show how Ikuru acted when he found her, dead beside him   Hell Girl was hit or miss, but goddamn, this episode...  The old man, doomed for hell, spending his life painting the girl he hopes to see in the afterlife.     yfw the true hero in this series is his stick    All the works from this author are the same    Same here.    Not really. Ai-ren is much more tragedy based than the others.  It's also one of my all time favorite manga, so watch your whore mouth     Too pure for this cruel world.  ;_;     Last NGE episode   Last Gunbuster episode   Last Diebuster episode  Those are the most recent ones. They weren´t even primarily sad. Just filled with such strong emotions. Damn Gainax.        babby's first tear jerker episode    Does this count? DOES THIS FUCKING COUNT ? God, fuck everything about this heartbreaking, depressing VN. There is no happiness to be found here, even  in the single ending where Kana survives      Gainax  I almost forgot how Gainax ruined Christmas     This and Samurai X OVA   I used to have a heart of stone but I seem to be getting weaker to feels brought on by anime. Teared up yesterday at the end of Punchline, flat out cried at the end of the burger episode of Kekkai Sensen earlier this season. Sure I'm gonna have a few salty beers this weekend.   You just reminded me of that showd existence and the fact that it made me cry. That reunion was one of the most beautiful moments I've seen in years    I got the ending where Taka loses his mind out of grief. Then i got the snow endin. I broke down like a fucking bitch   I legit cry very rarely which is weird because I'm pretty emotional and get moved by a lot of things. It usually just stops at the almost-but-not-quite lump in the throat stage. I'm hard pressed to remember anything specific. I think latest was mango a while ago when reading Kokou no Hito. Can't remember if talking about anime. I get much more happy tears.       I finished the last episode of Gundam War in the Pocket yesterday and cried all the time in the second half, it was so sad to see Bernie dieing, it had too much of an impact on me, I couldnt concentrate on university stuff  Bernie ;-;      I didn't cry during Grave of the Fireflies. I actually laughed a little.  What the fuck is wrong with me?    Doremi has made me misty a lot of times while watching it.  "granma said I only can cry in the bathroom and  in my father's arms"   every fucking time     KyoAni always finds a way to make me cry while watching their seemingly innocent moeshit shows.    You have a severe case of the Edge.    Oh fuck, same here. Also, Reiko's death in Parasyte.      Why is it always the episodes with the dogs?  This was probably the stupidest thing I have ever cried to.       newfags will never know what you are talking about   Like a bitch.   The end of Death Parade. I'm a sucker when the characters are parting with each other.    I don't know, it wasn't a laughing at them kind of laugh, more a laughing because it was the only thing I could do to avoid feeling disgust towards myself for not crying.  And laugh is a bit of an overstatement, they were closer to chuckles than anything.  For what its worth, I did get serious about taking my SRI regularly after watching it.       Don't know why but the final episode made me cry.     mfw he smiled       I cry at anime all the damn time. Most recently I started tearing up at episode 8 of Pleiades when she sees the alien as what her brother drew when he was a kid.   I watched this with my brother (non-anime watcher), and fuck, I don't want to watch anime with normalfag again, they always comment and make fun of what they see on screen, it's annoying. They tend to underestimate what a cartoon can do. I should watch this alone.       S;G Movie   Damn, if you cried from the trimmed down suffering in there, how did you manage with the main series? Have you read the VN?        Brought tears to my eyes too. Though by most people's definitions I guess it wasn't "crying". Damn close though.   It just wasn't fucking fair.         Most of the time it's more like they don't seem to want to suspend disbelief. I think there's also an expectation as a guy to not want to just take emotional things at face value. Most guys who aren't in tune with their emotions are pretty tsundere towards being honest with themselves about how they feel to anything even remotely sensitive.    Which DD would you x?  Mai waifu   You mean mine.     Koneko     No, mine    Neither! Xenovia is best waifu   <br/>   Koneko doesn't have any D's though.    No....Mine.    But that's wrong     I never liked the D's in DxD they just look like implants from the 90's.     Left   We still have a thread use it.<br/>   It's correct.    Rias, Akeno and Irina at the same damn time.    Ross.   Serafall is best DxD    100 yen coin   not fine ass rias and sexy ass akeno  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ne8<wbr>DgiJdzCk</wbr>  [ ]     rias and rossweisse are best but rias is best   Silly rabbit, Akeno is for me.   Guys stop fighting over Akeno, her breasts are big enough for all of us.  I call dibs on Sona.    That's a negatory     It is fact.    This. Xenovia is best DXD.    Followed closely by Koneko.     asia for some reason.    This thread needs more Zenovia.      It's funny how they had to make Rossweisse a useless retard, so that she wouldn't steal the best girl status with that dynamite body.              You guys need to find yourselfs a new girl Akeno is mine             Anyone else waiting for BDs before they watch this for the first time?    Ophis.    Back the fuck out, m8. She stays with me    There can only be one.    Does she show up in the anime? I just started season 2. I don't know who she is but my penis is certainly familiar with her.    Posting best doujin   She does, she is in the 3rd season. I can't remember if she appears in season 2 though.    Eh, I've only ever read one ntr doujin that turned me on. Most of the time it's just too silly to be hot. HOW DO YOU ENJOY BEING FUCKED BY A TRUE MANS COCK INSTEAD OF HIS TINY LITTLE PECKER YOU FILTHY WHORE       Whatever, Issei impregnated his harem canon now.     Most of the time it's just too silly to be hot.  That one is even more hilarious considering it gets nothing right about DxD´s world, and the idea of a runt like Raizer ever being considered as leader of the underworld is just too funny to take seriously     in manga?   This one. After casting resurrection ofc.  And yes, M&amp;M Resurrection restores eradicated bodies.    Extra scene for the last episode in the Bds of S2 she shows up outside Issei´s house with Vali, its how they teased that S3 was going to happen.     Which DD would you x?   There is only one answer to that anon, all of them.  ALL OF  THEM except  ashy tits               Author confirmed on his blog.   http://ishibumi.exblog.jp/      I would like to bully Valkyrie. anyone else?   LNs   Only of bodies that matter. there is still no reason what so ever to bring back that pile of ashes back, specially considering that even asia can probably one shot her and turn her to ashes again        Stop being delusional   I'd like some Irina chan myself.   I would bully her by taking her to super expensive stores and buying her everything she sees    Usually, girls like Rias are my fetish, but for this show, I'm more interested in Koneko than all the others.   I love a show that has really.... eye catching eye catches.  What does it feels like?   bretty cruel mane.    Are you really asking what boobs feel like?  Boobs feels like a cantaloupe.      Bags of salty milk   Is this FAT TATS: the anime?   Pretty much    more like  ALL TATS: The anime.  the range of sizes is pretty good, even if the main focuse are big fat tats.       whichever one has the biggest DDs     Poor Sona looks so sad it's practically heartbreaking.    MAY DAY... MaY... daYy  THIS IS THE QUEEN XENOVIA      that view     Left is too yellow.    Its karma, Sona used to steal Ria's toys when they were small. But don worry Issei will give her a piece of the DxD from time to time to keep her happy     Small perky breasts are fine too.    I don't think Ishibumi is that cruel to Saji.  Otherwise we will see child who can control dragon water      Sona is great in threesomes because she balances out the girls she is usually paired with    I seriously hope not. Sona is a bitch for neglecting Saji.     Sona is a bitch for neglecting some one she never liked as anything but a brother    anon expecting her to like Saji is like expecting Rias to like Kiba.  And Saji neglects momo and twintails even harder, so i guess you dont want anyone to be happy.         why this season of dxd is so bad ? it feels like watching naruto fillers    Superior nordic girl    That's because it is fucking filler.    Saji tries so hard, but in the end, it doesn't even matter.   Rossweisse is not alone for C88, Rias getting another one. Can't post pictures because of lewd. http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51068763</wbr>   Loki ruined the anime. Fuck Loki.    becuase they decided to mesh together a bunch of arcs, and skip a couple others, so they could use the second half of the season for a shitty completly anime original filler arc that will have no fucking impact on the actual story because  LOL they wont remember anything that happened  but it will impact the audience becuase it steals the hype from some of the events that would happen in S4 if it ever gets made.     Would you let a horny cat suck your dick?   Dude Saji tries but in all the wrong ways, the mother fucker basically does backflips into the friendzone and then dives deeper and deeper into the otoutozone and puts weights around his feet just to be safe.  And its not like he doesnt have help, Issei tries to bring him up any time he is talking alone with Sona, but she has no interest at all in saji as anything but a member of her peerage.  Saji should have taken the two girls that are after his D and then get them to help him convert Sona, but instead he ignores them which in turn makes them plot agaisnt him ever getting together with sona and makes them shove issei more into sona's face so she will go after him.       https://jerutz.wordpress.com/slashd<wbr>og/</wbr>   Rias always gets a couple so thats no surprise.  lets hope the Ross one is good and not like the Irina one we got when S2 aired, the cover was pretty great and then it got scanned and it was shit.      Yes, whilst I pat her on the head.     Yes, whilst I pat her on the head.  and she grabs your hand with her tail to keep it there on her head     that explains everything  its not just him, overall new characters and the plot is weak hell i'm not watching this show for plot but god damn this level of story writing should be banned, even PLOT didnt deliver.   S4  After what i have just watched i'm not sure if want.  Also all girls are best girls Rias and Sona just happened to be my favorite             Well it isn´t totally bad, half of the season was good, we got neko sisters    Yes because it's her fault he keeps chasing her when she's never shown any interest.    That's not true.  What happened is a typical scene between two children.  one doesn't want to lend her toy. (Rias)   the other wants to play with it. (Sona)    In the end, the teddy bear's ear was torn off as they tugged on it and both cried:   Rias because the toy Sirzechs gave to her was damaged.   Sona because she was sorry for damaging the toy.             the level of fuck ups in the last 3 epiosodes overshadow the good things from the first half, hell not even the Oppai Dragon song took the shit taste off of the last episode.   yes at least we got Kuroka, and genki koneko out of it, and i guess a half assed soft Akeno  though that just pisses me off because there was no real build up or payoff either because of all the shit they skipped     Well at least now they are fighting over a much stronger teddy bear who can just fuck them both and keep them happy.           A cat is fine too.     Where is a japanese anime Gordon Ramsay when you need him  Someone needs to give a lesson to that studio     Ravel.   A cat is more than just fine.          I didn't like it because it made Issei look more than the typical oblivious harem protag he usually is in the LN. And that says something.    showdown with Sairaorg  New mobage event is teasing season 4 god damnit.          PLEASE MORE    The artist making the Ross one is pretty good in my opinion. I particularly liked the Daimidaler doujin he made.     THE ASS WAS FAT     tfw Rias doesn't do it for me   tfw can't fap to Rias at all   Only DxD I have yet to fap to   Other than me possibly being gay as fuck what the fuck is wrong with me?         <br/>      And that's all I could find for this event.    red heads might not be your thing?...but even then anon, i would be seriously worried, the gay might be starting to take you over.    You don't like motherly girls.    Red heads may not be your thing. She may be too much of an Onee-san.         YES        Season 4 when?   Sometime between Winter and Fall 2016.    I myself don't like Asia. Not because of her cockblocks (I know that won't get anywhere anytime even without her because harem series), but probably because she is too much of a nice girl without any thing else.    Irina     See? No one would post like this a few years ago. The cancer people bring from generals is astounding.     sauce?    his ass.     but probably because she is too much of a nice girl without any thing else.  I dont mind girls being too nice, but yeah she is too nice AND boring .  hell her tits have more personality than she does.      ITT: pairings that absolutely no one wanted    Everyone tried to get me to watch this show in high school. I have no idea how anyone could tolerate the two main characters.   You first, OP.    The very definition of the childhood friend/worst girl wins. She's even tsundere.    I was watching the comfy anime when I decided to read the manga.  How I cringed so hard when I read the ending.       If you separated it into two different series, I would have enjoyed a father/daughter romance because I'm a deviant, however I was quite enjoying guy-raising-kid until the timeskip, and ultimately wasn't especially happy with anything after that.   I thought the possibility of incest was the only reason anyone followed that series.    We came for the imouto moe, and when there was none of that we stayed for the Kuroneko.    The problem was how it was handled. The series went from a very realistic, if idealized depiction of a man having to learn to be a father. It was very straightforward in that regard. Then, ten years later, their relationship boils down to, "It turns out we're not blood-related, so we can totally bone even though it's never crossed my mind before!" If the series was actually ABOUT a little girl developing romantic feelings for her adopted father, it would have been different. It's like the author tricked everyone into indulging her fetish.    Maybe in volume 1. But then literally every other girl was better       Nigga you are crazy. Yukimura is the best.    I loved the anime but I wasn't expecting this pairing, similar to OPs both characters acted like father and daughter through out the series until Sensei came out and admitted that he loved her in the last three episodes.   Manga isn't real, just ignore it.   I can't be the only person that changed the channel whenever they were on-screen together.   Oh, this is an easy one.   All these years later and I still don't understand it.    A lot of people wanted those pairings.     Kirinofags are not people     It's almost like something's missing from this thread.   Every time I see her face I want to kill.  I tell myself that she is just a cartoon character and there is no logical reason to be so upset, but it doesn't help.      Wrong        yeah sure I bet you where rooting for ms. psycopath childhoodfriend or agressive model bitch. or maybe loli cat evil. kirini is the only pure girl in the series. accept it     mfw      ms. psycopath childhoodfriend  The hero we didn't deserve, but needed. Manami did nothing wrong.     Kuroneko was the only realistic option    Manami is literally a psychopath. Nobody can say something like this with that kind of tone of voice and expression and not be fucked up in the head and a right cunt as well. Rarely do you see characters as vile as her in anime, even the supposedly "evil" guys are usually far more noble. at least she kicked off the incest route, but goddamn is she hateable.  Back in S1, she was a bit plain compared to the others but still a nice and homely girl, some people just want a normal relaxed life with a cute girl you know. Now she's just pure evil.  She is also obsessed about the concept of being normal, every single thing she does is for the sake of being normal, if she makes some meal she will not be happy until she does a "normal" meal, she says herself she can only do the normal thing in every aspect, she will do it again until it tastes normal, she hates everything above normal as much she hates things below her messed up normal standard, she is also the reason Kyosuke ended up with Kirino, is common for little girls to be very attached with their relatives to the point of saying they want to marry them in the future while they are unaware of the full meaning of the marriage, because Manami, brother and sister turned out detached from each other to the point Kyosuke perceived Kirino as a stranger, also made Kirino tramatized person, traumatized with her complex making her unable to forget childish play, then when they got close again Manami got a healthy male living close with a model level beauty as the best romantic option, and made the childish brother complex of Kirino grow into full blown romantic love, I am pretty sure to say Manami is a psycho who messed things up for herself due her obsession.   Pushing other girls onto kyousuke to keep him from spending time with kirino with full intentions to break their hearts later anyways.   she is evil I tell you            Senseless pairings? Here's your king and queen of that bullshit.   How the fuck did Relena end up being a much more likable character than Heero, anyway?     Nobody can say something like this with that kind of tone of voice and expression and not be fucked up in the head and a right cunt as well.  Saying the truth like that is what heroes do.   Pushing other girls onto kyousuke to keep him from spending time with kirino with full intentions to break their hearts later anyways.  Yeah, doing everything to prevent someone from ruining their life. Sounds like a hero to me.        Heero felt too static. He did change but not as noticeably as Relena.    She was never likeable, that was just you buying into her psychopathy.    yet her actions are all for selfish purposes    Doing good for selfish reasons is totally something only a psychopath would do.    Do you think she collects the hands of her victims?    Better that then Yamucha   Just a reminder that Kyousuke and Kirino would be normal siblings if Manami hadn't stirred shit around.   I remember watching this for the 2nd time and being really fed up with all the POLITICS and Relena sipping coffee.     implying  Kuroshit fags still butthurt.  God I loved those threads right after the last LN released.         Here to prove this post bad and wrong.    Are you really this autistic about some girl you don't like?    Funny how the manga got a whole lot better after that stupid bitch more or less disappeared from it.    Why  Why must you bring all these feelings back  what a goddamn rage-inducing series that was        You'll understand when you are older.   Which ending was most disappointing?   Now you're nitpicking when it's going to be done exactly which was never the point in the first place? The point is Vers isn't giving away shit, the plan is to give rights to everyone but sell the thing they're used for, so this benefits (or will benefit if you're going to flip a shit over tenses) both sides, not just Earth.    Considering it only took 15 years for them to develop KATs, them finding out how to crack the code won't take that long, especially since they aren't starting from scratch.    Let me get this straight, you  think you're talking to the same people   making incorrect assumptions   arguing semantics  You are trying to find holes where there are none.         The point is Vers isn't giving away shit,  They are,    the plan is to give rights to everyone   On Earth   but sell the thing they're used for, so this benefits (or will benefit if you're going to flip a shit over tenses) both sides, not just Earth.   Wrong again.     DAT BACKPEDALING                   They are,  They're not giving away Aldnoah. They're selling it.   On Earth  According to what, your fanfic again?   Wrong again.  Watch. the. fucking. show.          Sento that is all      blushing in the bathtub    She just itched the ditch to Kanye, didn't she?   Yeah, just came out.          Literally perfect.   Sento is good for nothing but breeding.   All-female cast   No actual lesbians in the cast   Threads are nothing but yurifags and art is nothing but yurishit    Why is this bullshit allowed?       Yurifags latch onto platonic friendship like stink on shit.     two girls live together   two girls say they love each other   not gay       Yurishits are just as bad as fujoshits.     Two rocks on the same planet   Two rocks   Not amazing love &amp; lust rockmance.        Mad waifufag detected    This Power Level placements are correct, right /a/?   He was defeated by himself, not by someone's attack.    Iihiko is a fictional character Therefore Iihiko was defeated by a fictional character     They managed to beat his body andd force him to possess Shiranui.
