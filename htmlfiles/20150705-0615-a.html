Chrissie <br>Disgusting. Commie is fucking with us.</br>  So when do we get the fisting again?  <br>And look how well it worked, now people thinking some playful banter is more than it was.</br>  <br>Rainbow Flower &gt; Gekisou Gungnir &gt; Watashi to Iu &gt; G-Beat = Seigi wo Shinjite</br>   Here's your new thread. <br><br>What are the chances of a 10.5 OVA?</br></br>  <br>Fuck off with that pasta already.</br>  <br>You know, thinking about it made me think that Yui wouldn't really be bothered that much by it. Sure she might be put off for a little bit but in a weeks time she would be cool.</br>  <br>Okay okay okay, I got it this time. What if 8man writes a love letter to Yui explaining his deep love for her and that she shouldn't confess to him. It also says that she should keep it on the down low and to not bring it up until he says so.<br><br>There, a completely neutered Yui that won't pursue or confess. Hopefully it turns her off completely. <br><br>If she brings it up he will feign ignorance and if she pushes it he says that it isn't his and that it is probably a prank.</br></br></br></br></br>    Irohasu~  Drawfag Thread 1530<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1509:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn (embed)<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1529 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Better bump before it reaches the bottom  <br><br>here's what i got. hope you like it.</br></br>  <br>Hmm, looks kind of abstract, maybe a little surreal, with those colors, I like that.<br><br>She looks a bit mad for some reason, but that's not a bad thing.<br>Thank you Mr. Drawfriend!</br></br></br></br>   I'm back, friends <br>Requesting Rikka watching fireworks!</br>  Can any drawfriend tell me if there's anything that I need to fix before I try and move on to coloring?  Will Rebecca join the SH crew soon?  <br>Me neither. I miss Doffy and Croc and if Kid is going to end up a villain he's undoubtly going to get his ass kicked, too.<br> mfw Kid ends up in jail </br></br>  <br> Even Marco with his fancy ass fruit power managed to do fuck all. <br><br>hey now hey<br><br>Marco is a Tank not a DPS</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Viola is a hardass. You think they gave her that scene where she stood up to doffy for no reason?</br>  <br><br>I think it's kinda obvious that the ship carrying him to Impel will get intercepted by Kaido so we get an introduction to him and see just how much he outclasses Doffy and his captors.</br></br>  <br> So I think we can all agree that this guy has an ant zoan devil fruit. <br>I'm so sick of people, usually tripfags, insisting that everyone automatically agrees with their bullshit headcanon.</br></br>  Why are reverse traps so pure?  <br>We opposed his "habits" for a long time. Hard for a party to go well for you when there's the ugliest woman you've ever seen constantly invading your personal space.</br>  Ero-manga-kun or host-kun, /a/?<br><br>You have 10 seconds to explain.  Hotaru is out, because she has an obvious leg above them. </br></br>  Thought this was yaoi at first, but I was then treated to reverse trap Komatsu. Probably the best misunderstanding I've ever had.  <br>This is ok, but I would rather have more Sabagebu</br>  <br>If I can't have Hotaru I'd rather have death.</br>  Charlotte hype thread? Charlotte hype thread.  It begins  <br>Of course, wait until she falls for him and goes dere.</br>  I hope he keeps being a bit of a jerk.  <br>Yeah what the fuck kind of slow pace was that. <br><br>First ten minutes is MC going all Lelouch on life and then gets chased by a literal 2fast2furious</br></br></br>  <br>Could the dream shit be labeled as trauma?</br>  Which Karlsland witch is the hottest and why is it Marseille?  <br><br>Being Heidi's friend would be pretty cool and somewhat romantic, staying up all night to talk about different things while star gazing and drinking fancy tea is what I'd imagine it to be like.<br><br><br><br> Marseille's ass <br>Anon, as much as I like Marseille and her body, you have to admit she has some pretty Godly breasts. Trude's the Karlsland with the nicest ass.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes please</br>  <br> Trude <br> not Minna <br><br>I mean, I know Trude's ass is hard enough to not even jiggle when spanked, but Minna's ass KILLS the enemy.<br><br>It'd be a hard battle between those two.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Both Minna and Trude have fabulous bodies and personalities that the battle is pretty much even between them.</br></br>    Are they really a lesbian couple. Or the girls just can't have boyfriends because it would anger those who have them as waifus?  <br>It does though.</br>    nah symphogear isnt lesbianshit but it's just a shit show.  <br>How the fuck does a gay act being socially accepted and considered "fine" make it less of a gay act?</br>  <br>and then there's this guy</br>  I just watched the directors cut of episode 12 to prep for insight. Are there really no decent BD releases of the first season? It's been a while already.  <br>Fuck this gay earth, I thought it was going to air tomorrow.</br>  Did we ever get a clean render of Rui's gatcha suit?<br>it looks kinda like a butler from what I could see in the 00 episode</br>  <br>I thought it was airing tomorrow.<br>Is it getting subbed? HS?</br></br>  <br>It's similar to Sugane's?</br>  <br>That's a cool OP.</br>  First episode less than 30mins to air.<br><br>Let's see how will it done.</br></br>    <br>It's the standard chosen heroes going to defeat the demon lord with his minions stopping you along the way with a time limit</br>  <br>Except this one is a mystery series first and foremost</br>      In celebration of a great first episode, I'm going to dump the first chapter of the manga. And maybe more if you're interested.  <br>I honestly hope they show us, but I doubt it.</br>  <br><br>I like how they made campaign patches for their soldiers with Rory on them just to remind people that yes, God is not only on their side but actually fights along side them. It must be really demoralizing knowing Rory is part of their army, like if Norway deployed Thor to fight ISIS.<br><br>I wonder if they will address the fact that after she appeared on TV Rory probably has tens of millions of followers on Earth. It is logical to consider that with that number of believers on earth she might be the most popular God by a large margin at this point.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  demigodesses gets stronger the more followers they get after reaching godhood </br>  <br>Tracer round probably</br>  <br><br> 75402▶  <br>I liked it too.</br></br></br>  Tomboys are for _____  <br>I have already seen it but cannot wait nonetheless.</br>  <br>THATS FORBIDDEN</br>  <br>Is there something wrong with it? I don't usually use that word, so sorry for the mistakes.</br>  Sex with Tomo-chan. would she enthusiastically take the D and scream or be limp from embarrassment?  <br>ban the naruto threads then bitch</br>  1st Saturday of the Month<br><br><br>IT's TIME /a/, MOGRA SATURDAY!!<br><br><br>GET IN HERE<br><br><br>ustream tv / channel / mogra1<br><br><br>START 23:00PM - END 05:00AM (Japan Time)<br><br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127585281#p127585281">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  U S A <br>S<br>A</br></br>  OH SHIT, EVEN IN JAPAN.<br><br>USA USA USA</br></br>   4th of july <br><br>Doesn't get more American than this</br></br>  I WAS MADE TO EAT IN AMERICA.<br><br>Happy Freedom day to all the fags from Freedomland.</br></br>  What was that song with the passionate male voice? Before the NGE/Vivaldi remix.   90 minutes <br><br>sakurafag status: RUINED</br></br>  <br> Also why do people act like this is some kind of war? it's all the same game, it's Fate the one going to shit with bad adaptations.  <br> Jesus this is why I hate Fate's fanbase on /a/ they're retarded. <br><br>I bet you've never seen a shithole called MAL and CookingPriest</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because people stopped waifuing characters long ago. They're instead in love with routes of visual novels associated with respective heroines and consider them better than any aspect of the rest. Rinfags for example consider final fight between Shirou and Kotomine so shit it needs to be rushed or preferably non-existent (That's actually not true, since most of them are secondaries, so they've never read the fight and don't know about it. They're just shitting on it to fit in).<br><br>I'm a Saberfag, I enjoyed UBW, I'm gonna be sad if Heaven's Feel is rushed, if I want to cuddle with my waifu for forty hours I can read the fucking VN. I want to watch a cool fight in the end with 光と闇 playing in the background and I want to hear "KOTOMINE KIREI――――" even though I hate wormslut.<br><br>Grow the fuck up, faggots.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would you bump the shitposting thread</br>  <br> Shiki has personality! <br> Its not a self insert! <br> Tsukihime best novel! <br>Yeah, sure.</br></br></br></br>  About to finish HF True. Kotomone is fucking awesome.<br><br>So the reason he wants to protect Angra Mainyu is because he relates to it? Defective from birth, etc.</br></br></blockquote>]
