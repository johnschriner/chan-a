Why din't Rohan just write in Kira, "I can't kill anybody".?  <br>What the hell happened to the BGs in this chapter?</br>  [guitar song]  <br>What about them?<br><br>What's the consensus on Karera? Enemy or ally? How long will she live?</br></br></br>  <br>JOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br><br>JO!</br></br></br>  Can Rohan write "I have a stand" in someone and give them stand powers?  Kujo Josefumi has stupid hair.  <br> those hentai protagonists in the background </br>  Who is the undisputed best character in Jojo and why is it Buccellati?  Man, Johnny must've slept around a lot because nearly every male character looks like him.  so the new Kakyoin Dies will be Rohan Dies right?    <br>I don't think you believe that yourself. Even early Josuke already looked different from him despite Jojos always starting out looking like the previous one.</br>  <br>Why does she walk like a south park character?</br>  <br>Who knows, the SFX points it out too.</br>  <br>Ally</br>  <br>I don't see why not.</br>  <br>Gotta get close first</br>  <br>her stand's shit, she admits it herself<br><br>she won't be a threat to josuke</br></br></br>  <br>I bet the reason she says the user has to be the one touching the head is only because otherwise it would be Karera's hair and not the costumer's. <br><br>I'll be surprised if she doesn't turn out to have much more freedom with it outside of those situations. She might even be able to control the hair like Yukako.</br></br></br>  <br>either way, josuke can remove hair with bubbles as well</br>  <br>If you're going for  real  spoilers, I guess.<br><br>I prefer this one.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, a hair stand can't really be much of a match for S&amp;W either way. All I'm saying is that it could be a far better ability than it initially seems, and it's also always handy to have a humanoid form for your stand.</br>  <br> shit stands can't be a threat </br>    <br>Best husbando/waifu.</br>  <br>No. That's like Gappy stealing someone's Stand with Soft &amp; Wet. It's too abstract.</br>  <br>That gave me sticky fingers.</br>  <br>Why didn't Kira just wrote down the names in the Note?</br>  <br>Goddamit why are genderswapped Jojo characters so fuckable?</br>  <br>Because they're already adorable AND look like traps.</br>  Guys, what chapter did the "Get a feeling so complicated" quote come from?  <br>They just are.</br>  <br> Giorno is the worst JoJo by far <br> Female Giorno is the best by far </br></br>  <br> Giorno is the worst JoJo by far <br>Weird way to spell best.</br></br>  <br>  all of the porn and sexy pics are for the genderswapped dudes <br><br>Why is this allowed. Where the fuck are the HP and FF fanarts.</br></br></br>  <br>FF is too pure for that sort of thing, anon.</br>  <br>He wouldn't kill the alien dude</br>  <br>  canonly shown to be able to increase the size of a part of her body <br>  drinks a lot <br>  not lewd material </br></br></br>  <br>I'm more surprised with the lack of Jolyne material, considering we see her masturbating in prison and then that thing with the snails.</br>  <br>Just before the end of Yukako's</br>  Why does everyone in part 4 have such huge-ass legs?  <br>They just wear really baggy pants</br>  <br>The bad art from the early chapters doesn't help either.</br>   part 4 <br>never ever</br>  <br> crazydcantfixshittaste.jpg </br>  <br><br> 14 year old cousin starts asking me about jojo out of the blue today <br> says stuff like "You ok reatard?

It was also funny</br>  <br>this video was made by /a/</br>  <br>Whats so bad about him tweeting something he likes? Literally who is joel?</br>  <br>from vinesauce</br>  <br> July 28th <br>Nope, delayed to September 22nd. You're right about the other stuff though.</br></br>  <br>The fuck is vinesauce? Just looks like some 4th tier casual vidya site like dorkly</br>  <br>are we supposed to care? there are 100 left and they really should have just translated the color scans</br>  <br>If your stand is your soul you already have it, you just aren't able to manifest it</br>  <br><br>What the actual fuck<br> I never knew that Joel tweeted my fucking video and later deleted it, what the fuck is going on?<br>Pic related , if you dont believe i made the video(all the images are fucked up because i organized my folder after the video sorry).</br> </br></br></br>  What the fuck happened to Bucciarati after he got "Killed" by King Crimson? He was dead but he wasn't?  Guise<br><br>Why didn't DIO just punch through Jotaro's spine while he was frozen after his 2 seconds passed like he did with Kakyoin?</br></br>  <br>Bruno was supposed to die there but Giorno's healing brought back his soul into his dead body slowly deteriorating.</br>  <br>He did,Jotaro had manga armor.</br>  <br>Because good guys don't die, faggot</br>  <br>He was too slow and full of himself.</br>    <br> jojo died for me after the worst part <br>I understand,but don't worry the next ones are better</br></br>  <br> JoJo died for me after i'm too pleb to read the manga </br>  <br>True but if Jotaro died then there would be no one else from stopping Dio and he would take over the world.</br>   part which could benefit the most from clear action during fights gets the least color <br> part 6 which has the clearest artstyle and straightforward fights gets fully colored </br>  <br>I'd let her roll my stones.</br>  <br>It's all fully colored, retard. All of the parts are being translated by different people, i'm just guessing the guy who did part 6 isn't a lazy cunt</br>    4 &gt; 3 &gt; 6 &gt; 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 7 &gt; 5 &gt; 8<br><br>I haven't read non-shit Vento Aureo scanlations so that's the main reason 5 is rated so low for me. <br>I also don't get the hate on part 3 besides Autism: The JoJo, enlighten me, /jojo/.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah sorry, that's what I meant. I think the people translating the color scans of part 5 translated 6, though.</br>  <br> 1&gt;7 <br> 6&gt;7 <br> 3&gt;7 </br></br></br>  <br>King Crimson had the opposite effect of Golden Experience on Bruno and instead of injecting him with life and accelerating his consciousness when it punched him, it slowed it down.</br>  <br> 3 above anything </br>  <br>  Part 8 last </br>  <br>Likely she'll be an ally but one that doesn't show up much beyond this arc.</br>  <br> 7 so low <br> 8 at the end <br> 3 so high <br> 1 above the rim of the trashcan </br></br></br></br>  <br>7 would be better if Johnny wasn't so shitty compared to Gyro.<br><br>Yeah. Punch ghost people out to fight DIO and his minions. Plus Star Platinum is one of my favorite stands. I don't get the hate.<br><br>Gappy is putting me to sleep. I can only deal with Alzheimer's Sailor running around doing fuck-all for so long.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> monster of the week handled horribly with terrible pacing  <br> Jotaro's fights being the worst of the bunch,literally just resolves things by ORAORAing harder <br> DIO turning completely retarded and the final fight being absolute horseshit <br>It's by far the worst jojo part. In every other part fights are handled way better and the MC isn't a talking brick.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him and he has shit taste in almost everything but Araki really, REALLY can't do mystery, the pacing is terrible and there's a new mystery every chapter, with no resolutions and he'll probably change his mind about the original solution so it'll make no sense.<br>Also MC is kinda boring. It's not as bad as part 5, but that at least had cool fights instead of constant joestar family techniques.</br></br>  <br> I also don't get the hate on part 3 <br>It's mostly about the uninteresting monster of the week enemies and stands. The main cast is also inferior compared to those of the subsequent parts.<br><br>Besides, older readers are probably already sick and tired of all the MUDAMUDA and ORAORA, since it's pretty much the first thing that gets you into JJBA.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 1 <br> anywhere near Trashcan <br>Puh leaze</br></br></br>  If Karera had Harvest she could rob the entire Morioh in 2 days  <br> johnny  <br> shitty </br></br>  <br> thinking part 1 is anywhere near as good as any of the other parts.  <br>Its redeeming factor is Dio throws a dog to its fiery death.</br></br>  <br>Oh. Well, dicks.</br>  <br>rip in pieces harvest, you were so interesting araki had to kill you</br>  <br>Part 1 is only above 3 honestly. It had nothing especially bad but nothing especially interesting either.</br>  <br> not liking Johnny "I will fucking murder anyone who disagrees with my path of righteousness" Joestar <br><br> thinking Gappy isn't one of the best Jojos <br><br>what the fuck is up with you</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This has to be the most retarded post I've read recently about part 8.</br>  <br> awesome introduction <br> Jojo and Dio's boyhood <br> Mansion Fight <br> Zeppeli's death <br> Bait and switch ending <br> Jonathan is general </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please explain why, unless you're too retarded of course.</br>  <br>Gay Priest used Whitesnake as another body more than he ever actually used the stand power.</br>  <br> Oh man dio sure is a cunt <br> Look at Dio continuing to be an absolute cunt <br> Why don't we make him a cunt vampire <br> Hey that dude punched a frog <br> oh no hes dead <br> yay dios dead <br> oh wait hes a head <br> end <br><br>also Jonathan is the worst fucking most bland ass jojo of them all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>3 is rated low because all Jotaro fights equal up to "i'm just gonna punch harder until it gets punched." So most of the good fights are carried by the rest of the cast. Even Dio's World's amazing fights gets soured by this in that jotaro just punches his way through rather than figuring out a way to win like every other jojo. <br><br>It breaks from the theme of other Joestars who always use their mind while jotaro uses just brute force. Even his Stands Stats are better that every other stand including the world from the start.<br><br> Jotaro vs Kakyoin <br>Just punches through emerald splash then punches more<br><br> Jotaro vs Dark Blue Moon <br>Just suddenly develops star finger and instakills enemy when trapped<br><br> Jotaro vs forever <br>Literally just does the same thing as last time<br><br> Jotaro vs Rubber Soul <br>Literally the only fight jotaro doesn't just power through. He actually used strats tactics to win like a joestar. <br><br> Jotaro vs Wheel of Fortune <br>so-so, still sorta powerhoused, but did use a little joestar trickery.<br><br> Jotaro vs enya <br>sucks up a stand that literally covers the entire town in fog somehow with only the lung capacity of a human.<br><br> Jotaro vs the sun <br>OHKO<br><br> Jotaro vs both anubis <br>Punch to win<br><br> Jotaro vs Alessi <br>7 year old physically beats up man with a stand, an axe, and beefy arms, even though Jotaro was a kind and gentle boy when he was 7.<br><br> Jotaro vs DIO <br>Punches Dio in the leg and makes him explode without being able to recover somehow.<br><br><br>Giorno is guilty of this level of asspull too, which is why he is normally rated low. But all other joestars use the enviroment, circumstance, and their minds to outsmart the enemy with the tools they have. Thats what makes their fights great.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> oh no, too many mysteries in a mystery setting <br> I can't handle monthly issues so that means the pacing is terrible <br> it also means we'll never see the resolution of the mysteries either, even though we're still years from the actual end of it <br> why can't we go back to shonen battles instead? </br></br></br></br>  <br> also Jonathan is the worst fucking most bland ass jojo of them all. <br><br>Puh leaze</br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't he just use Whitensake to tell him where the spikes were during Heavy Weather</br>  <br>You should've put 1 real one and kept the animefags guessing</br>  <br>Sometimes I feel like you guys just pull random numbers out of a hat or something when making those dumb ranking lists.</br>  <br> Giorno is guilty of this level of asspull too, which is why he is normally rated low <br>Giorno is Joseph with Cars as his stand, it's hardly his fault.</br></br>  <br> I can't handle monthly issues so that means the pacing is terrible <br>Why doesn't Araki just use The World and finish jojo while time is stopped?</br></br>  <br> monster of the week <br>Wasn't that because the volumes were released...weekly?<br> terrible pacing <br>Explain<br> Jotaro's fights being the worst <br>Besides the fight with DIO, I kinda agree there. Autists can't do much except rage harder. Remind you guys of  /a/nyone ?<br> DIO being retarded <br>Seemingly immortal vampire was too full of himself. His pride was his downfall.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Damn...those asspulls...yknow maybe I'm lovin on Part 3 more because I just recently finished the animu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because The World  Isn't real </br>  <br> Wasn't that because the volumes were released...weekly? <br>1 and 2 weren't like that, they had training arcs, exposition etc. and the characters had personal growth, but Jotaro didn't. He was born cool, which is bad for stories.</br></br>  <br>It was a request from an anon to re-add the same panels but in color.<br><br>I kinda fucked up Johnny's panel cause he got shot 3 different times during D4C.</br></br></br>  <br>Ally, swinging the death flag hard and probably moments before she drops a big info bomb.</br>  <br>I can't take this part seriously. His hair looks like the sole of a shoe.</br>  <br>1 and 2 weren't like that because there weren't enough enemies to do the MotW deal. Jotaro is pretty bland in 3 though.</br>   Alessi <br>As Polnareff spent almost the entire arc showing, the mind doesn't regress instantly. Jotaro still had his aggressive attitude from being a 17 year old. <br><br> DIO <br>DIO can't recover because re-read Shooting DIO and the fight as a whole.</br></br></br></br>  <br>for<br><br><br><br>somehow forgot to quote.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But there could have, that's the point. I was kinda expecting to see endless lists of killers turned vampires.</br>  I can't get over how good High Dio looks in the anime. Seriously they nailed his design.  <br>If only their regular DIO was a little better</br>  <br>My dick still twitches a little when I think of that ROAD ROLLER DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</wbr></br>  <br>I think she will be an ally.<br><br>I can't wait for the banter between her and Yasuho</br></br></br>  damn, part 7 colored looks like ass, the coloring ruins some scenes, like Mountain Tim's death scene.  <br><br> Alessi <br>Even if he was still a gruff delinquent, the first chapter shows PHYSICALLY jotaro was a sweet and gentle boy. Not some macho man-child nor did he was any ripple to bad this up. So it is just bullshited that Jotaro somehow at the age 7, even those then he was just a sweet and gentle boy, beat up a grown man who was ripped, had a weapon, and a stand, just by punching him. No matter what way you turn, its a complete cope out. That arc should have been Joseph showing up, being in his prime, and winning through ripple hijynx, not baby punches.<br><br> DIO <br>Star platinum punches the worlds hand and forearm to pieces, but they recover in a few moments because high DIO has the same regeneration rate as part 1 Dio. <br><br>And even if the explosion did get his head, as shown by Straights getting blown up and even part 1 Dio getting his head sliced in two, Vampires can nearly indefinitely recover as long as they have some fresh blood. <br><br>So why destorying the world would lead Dio to not be able to regenerate doesn't make sense. If nothing else they could have bullshited Dio regenerating but being comatose because "his spirit was killed" or something, but no, the punch just kills him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Everyone knows the correct order is 7 &gt; 4 &gt; 8 &gt; 2 &gt; 5 &gt; 6 &gt; 1 &gt; 3  <br>Who cares, get over the fact that part 3 was shit and move on.</br>  <br>You should post something else like bites za dusto for Jotaro, people will understand it's Boingo and not Jotaro since they already saw the scene, this face doesn't fit him at all nor makes it like it's an actual death but something clearly comedic.</br>  <br> 5 above 3 <br> 1 above 3 <br> 8 above anything before it's finished </br></br></br>  <br>Where did "I am the fucking strong" come from anyway? I know it's not the Duwang line for that panel.</br>  <br>  Not 7 &gt; 6 &gt;= 4 &gt; 5 &gt; 3 &gt; 1 <br>8 isn't finished yet.</br></br>  7&gt;4&gt;2&gt;6&gt;3&gt;1&gt;5  <br> 5 above 3 <br> literally a better part 3 <br> not above it </br></br></br>  <br>You have clearly misunderstood the entirety of SC, honestly.</br>  <br>Part 3 had DIO and Jotaro wasn't Giorno.</br>  <br>You mean Josefumi</br>  <br>Josefumi is dead.</br>  Is the Araki Collection mediafire ever going to get updated with the new scans? I don't think there's a way to really download all of Part 4's good scans at once.  <br> Part 3 had DIO <br>And?<br><br> Jotaro wasn't Giorno <br>Of course not, Giorno wasn't autistic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> anything other than 8&gt;7&gt;6&gt;5&gt;4&gt;3&gt;2&gt;1 </br>  <br>You've been here too long, anon</br>  If Jojo had to have a probably very stupid and forced crossover with something else, what would you choose?  My Killer Queen died.<br>RIP</br>  <br>Hokuto no Ken</br>  <br>How's this? I feel like the BtD one wasn't as good as this one.</br>  <br>Yes and it would be called  Phantom Blood. </br>  <br>Dresden Files<br><br>it just works</br></br></br>  <br>What about the bites the dust moment where everyone "dies" ? Just crop it to just show Jotaro.</br>  So... what exactly is this niggers stand power? Bubbles?  <br>That scene was orgasmic</br>  <br>a stand that starts off more OP than gold experience and is only limited by imagination</br>  <br>It's a good panel but his death isn't as brutal.</br>  is pucci gay  <br>ARE YOU GAY</br>  <br>What does GER even do?</br>  <br>Keeps the cause but erases the effect.</br>  <br>See the stands that just works ? They don't work at all now.</br>  <br>resets anything to 0, even the user's life, will, whatever you can think of<br><br>if you're thinking "well that's just an "I win" stand", you're right</br></br></br>  <br>What makes it broken?</br>  <br> can turn anything into animals, can punch people into retardation, can reflect any damage to the user </br>  <br>What exactly is the 'fura' sound effect supposed to indicate</br>  <br>Swaying or wobbling.</br>  <br>The fact it can just take the property of an object such as sound. It also has range through bubbles and has good close range power.</br>  <br><br>I thought it was the different fabrics rubbing against her</br></br>  <br>Things like completely raping the laws of physics and removing the friction from an entire room.</br>  <br> <br>yeah after that part happened I'm not entirely sure of the limit of what it can "take" away, or how the taking mechanism even works (other than just saying I can take whatever I want) - why can't he just "take" someone's life??</br></br>  seeing all those stand doujin covers got me thinking, so Toshikazu Hazamada(user of Surface) from part 4 could turn his stand into the girl he wanted to bang but he couldn't deal with the attitude of his pwn stand<br><br> what if some no name dude in the JoJo universe has a stand with a similar ability and actually fucks it? </br></br>  <br>Doraemon.<br>Hey, you said stupid and very forced.</br></br>  <br>I think cloth rustling more typically has a sa or za sound.</br>  does anybody have a download link to the mad videos?  <br>Stands are a representation of one's psyche.<br>It would have to be someone very narcissistic and willing to literally fuck a part of himself.</br></br>  <br>www.checkthepastebin.com</br>  <br>Too abstract. What is someone's life? Their pulse? Their consciousness?</br>  <br>Well since he can take air why not blood? or the heart?</br>  <br>how different is it compared to fucking your own hand?</br>  <br>it's not gay if it's god</br>  Shouldn't the new spoilers be Shigechi dies?    <br>Comes too to soon. Need end game spoilers and technically everyone does die so bites za dusto is perfect</br>  <br>Yea but who cares he literally dies within a dozen chapters of being introduced and he's an autistic fatass middleschooler</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the bubble needs to make contact with whatever he's taking</br>  <br>shigechi dies immediately after he appears</br>  <br>You have a good point.</br>  <br>Could take friction from skin. Or something else vital just from skin. I don't really recall his bubbles going down the stone guys throat.</br>  <br>They did. He stuffed them straight in his mouth.</br>  <br>Guess I'm retarded then, still doesn't stop skin contact from being dangerous in many ways.</br>  Which of the part 3 Hired Stand users do you think got paid the most? <br><br>Rubber Soul said he was promised a 100 milllion$ reward for killing Jotaro, and Steely Dan says that he got paid by Dio up front.</br></br>  <br>Would be funny if he stole the sharpness of a knife or something.<br>"lololol u can't stab me"</br></br>  <br> That shitty Jotaro fake <br>At least use the one from MiH</br></br>  <br>Maybe if you've read the rest of the thread, you'd be able to see why I used that specific photo.</br>  <br>Rubber Soul was an idiot and Dio was probably planning to kill him and make him into a zombie once he came back.<br><br>Steely Dan was smarter and more dangerous. If he got Lovers into Dio things could get sour so Dio probably didn't want to fuck around with him.</br></br></br>  <br>David made High DIO attractive.</br>    <br>Why does Rohan look like a pedophile?</br>  hey doc, lets get a folder going for the most out of context jojo panels. I got a some friends who just watched part 1 and are asking "what is jojo all about." Pic related.

She just forgets things.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The real question is, what would she play? For some reason, I imagine her playing the handbells.</br>  <br>Triangle, cowbell, clapping, singing "la la la" or the song that never ends</br>  Just a little over a week.  <br>Oh shit, even more new images? Is that all of them?</br>  <br><br>I will never get over how cute this is.</br></br>  <br><br> Papi isn't retarded. <br><br>That's pretty debatable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>When is going to air the ATX version?</br>  <br><br> Animated-Miia actually has the proper amount of length and mass to her tail. </br></br>  <br>From July 7, every Tuesday 24: 30 ~ repeat broadcast: every Thursday 4:30 p.m. to 17:00 　　　　　　　every Sunday 20:30 to 21:00 　　　　　　　every Monday 8:30 to 09:00</br>  <br>GET HYPE</br>  <br>Miia best cuddler</br>  <br>Can't wait for animeonlyfags and people claiming waifus to start flooding the threads.</br>  <br><br>We've waited so long for this day, someone to take the pain away.

I really can't see her as a club music or hip hop kind of girl.</br>  Anyone knows what does it says here?    <br> Current points <br> World/overall rank <br> Papi(or your girl, for others) rank. <br><br>Below that is world top three, followed by your girl's top three.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hnnnnggggh</br>  <br>Yoj got brain problems, son.</br>  <br><br>Miia's cute little efly-ears almost look a little too narrow and pointy in these screen-shots compared to the Manga.</br></br>  <br>thanks</br>  <br>I hope it will be as funny as the manga.<br><br><br>I would choose Lala if she were available. It would be even better if the other girls outside the harem were available too</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then I would need even more accounts.</br>  <br>A drawfag should draw Cerea with the Megamilk T-shirt on. Blushing of course.</br>  Why does papi's ass fluctuate in size like someone's panic paper bag?  Did anyone find where the web shorts are on the nip site?  <br><br>Is anybody else disappointed that Cera doesn't continually produce milk, unlike the Minotauress?<br><br>I totally wouldn't mind milking her if she were my waifu.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm o'k with her not having milk all the time. Just means you can only milk her at special times(when having new born Centaur baby) PLus it makes it more special when the baby goes to sleep and you get your fill of milk strait from the tap.</br>  <br>Human milk tastes horrible and I assume that since she has human breasts she has human milk.</br>  <br><br>Cathyl also has human breasts and they say her milk tastes amazing.</br></br>  <br><br> Human milk tastes horrible <br><br>......How would you know that?.....</br></br></br></br>  <br>Experience</br>  <br>Mero said it was thick.

Here's a good introduction chapter:http://kissmanga.com/Manga/<wbr>Jitsu-wa-Watashi-wa/Vol-004-Ch-028-<wbr>-Let-s-Go-Grab--Em-Limited-Editions<wbr>-?id=204308</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br> hair down <br>I need more of this in my life</br></br>  <br>Why, and yet again, why not</br>  <br><br>Miia's tail length vary scene by scene<br><br>calling it</br></br></br></br>  <br>How many images do I have to post before you start reading?</br>  <br>WHY'D YOU TELL HIM THE SOURCE!? IT WAS FUN TO TEASE!</br>  <br>Shit. I thought he knew and wanted reasons to read it.</br>  <br>Mah nigga</br>  <br>But l know now, it was all part of my master plan.<br>I bet nobody remembers this was a monster tiddies discussion. Papi best grill. That is all.</br></br>  This thread is suffering from a serious lack of best girl.  <br>I've seen so much Cerea that I forget that she always has it in a ponytail<br><br>Girls with really long, straight hair are my favorite.</br></br></br>  <br>She has two pony tails.</br>  <br>You have goo taste anon. <br><br>Oh shit. You are right.</br></br></br>  <br> goo taste </br>      <br> goo taste </br>  OGRE<br>TITTIES</br>  <br><br>Fuck *Good</br></br>  <br>I THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE</br>  <br>It was a mistake joke. Like " Muh Duck=Muh Dick" I fucked up.</br>    <br>Freudian slips speak the truth. Embrace best girl.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Can't wait to see if they picked the same color choices that I made when I colored this back in 2012:</br></br></br></br>  <br> Monmusu shaming <br>Yes, perfect.</br></br>  <br> monster tiddies. <br> Papi <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br>Suu's been officially colored for a long time.</br>  <br>Fried my brain</br>  BTW, for those waiting patiently for more Jitsu... we're going to have a bonus for you all in honor of the anime starting. Look forward to it Tuesday.  <br>Probably, who cares though, it does in the manga as well<br><br>Pic related, her tail length isn't even remotely the same</br></br></br>  <br><br>When I colored Suu, I just did traditional slime colors. No one knew her hair color at the time, so I guessed that wrong.<br><br>I colored vase blue because I thought she'd pay attention to something the same color she was. I made the cup pink because I saw one in an office depot catalog. I also chose red for the bug spray (Thanks google translate) and the alarm clock (also color referenced from the same Office Depot catalog).<br><br>Imagine my surprise when Suu was holding a BLUE vase in the preview. If she has a RED alarm clock in the show, I will lose my shit...<br><br>That or the crabman/animators like fan art?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   in a perfect world <br> there's gonna be an ending for every girl <br> even the shit ones like lala <br> and everyone will be happy </br></br></br>  <br> Lala <br> Shit <br>Pick one<br> perfect world <br> ending for every girl <br>Pick one<br> Everyone <br> Happy <br>Pick one</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Everyone <br> &gt;Happy <br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>jej</br>  <br>mem</br>  <br> Lala <br> Shit <br> Pick one <br><br> No </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>vev</br>  <br>LOOK AT THAT SNOUT</br>  <br>geg</br>  <br>xex</br>    <br>cec</br>  <br><br>This.<br><br>Not sure how ANY Monmusu-race can compare with Lamias for top-tier cuddling.</br></br></br></br>  Is Polt the strongest Pokemon?  <br><br>It only struck me just now how huggable Mero looks with those big droopy ears and large, round eyes.</br></br>  <br>You ever heard of the Venus fly trap? Draws in unsuspecting flies into its maw with the scent of sweets, then kills them?<br>That's what's happening right now to you</br></br>  <br> You ever heard of the Venus fly trap? Draws in unsuspecting flies into its maw with the scent of sweets, then kills them? <br><br>B-But I'm not a fish, she wouldn't want to eat me.</br></br></br>  <br> polt used tail whip </br>  <br><br> Mero can be scary when she wants to. </br></br>  <br>She slapped Papi? Get fucked Papi.</br>  <br><br><br>Pokemonmusu, gotta catch em all!</br></br></br>  <br><br>Mero's fishy-ears are awesome.<br><br>They're second only to Miia's snakey elf-ears. Centaurea's horsey-ears are OK too, but not quite as exotic.<br><br>I wonder if they serve some purpose like allowing her to hear speech underwater when other Mermaids talk.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Papi threatened to harm the couch that makes people turn to mush, and Mero instinctively defended the thing she loves.<br><br> Imagine Mero actually getting worked up. </br></br></br></br>  Anime improved all of them.  <br><br>Back when the Monster Girl Encyclopedia was new, it was compared to Pokemon relatively frequently simply due to everyone wanting to seriously catch them all.</br></br>  <br>She's not that kind of pervert. She just wants to poison you so she can roe to the depth of love she shows by taking care of you though it's hopeless.</br>  <br><br>EAR RANKING:<br><br>Ninetei &gt; Miia = Mero &gt; Cerea &gt; Polt &gt; Everyone else</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not about the eating, it's the death that is assured<br>It has already begun. You have been drawn in by Mero's charms. Look at you. Already falling for her cute droopy ears and large round eyes, urging you to give her a warm embrace<br>But the: what's this? Suddenly you feel cold! A wetness in your side, followed with an excruciating pain! Oh, what is happening? Your vision is going dark, and next thing you know it Lala's leading you somewhere</br></br></br>  <br> what's this? Suddenly you feel cold! A wetness in your side, followed with an excruciating pain! <br><br> Mero <br> Stabbing you <br><br>Nigga the thing with Mermaids is they drag you into the water.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> and Mero instinctively defended the thing she loves. <br><br> I like to think that she'll do the same next time she's around when Darling is in danger. </br></br></br></br>  <br> Tio <br> Purple horn <br>Wat<br><br>Otherwise good, though</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Zombina not having her sickly-looking dark-green hair <br> improvement <br><br>No.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sometimes you've got to improvise when there's no water around<br>I mean, if all murders were near water, then people would avoid large bodies of water. You have to mix it up</br></br>  The questions in the game the last few days have been pretty ambiguous.<br><br>I know its "Japanese herbivore simulator 2015", but goddamn.</br></br>  <br>Please get your eyes checked. You're not the same person who thought the anime threw out Zombina's heterochromia, are you?</br>  Since MMniN basically prints merchandising money, does that mean an S2 is guaranteed eventually?  <br>All depends on how the anime sells</br>  <br>Zombina looks ginger. Perfectly reasonable considering that she has no soul, being a zombie and all.</br>  <br>Red is for hotblooded oni, she's blue until she develops a problem with authority or a calmer oni joins her hierarchy.</br>  <br><br> Blue <br> Purple <br>Am I in a colour-blind thread?</br></br></br></br>  Hey guys, I hate to muddle the thread with self-advertisement, but I wanted to go ahead and let you know that  I'm the graphic-designer guy that's been constantly promising to get my shirt-designs uploaded somewhere for purchase, and I've FINALLY started uploading my shirt-designs for purchase. <br><br>I finally decided to stop being an indecisive faggot and start uploading my designs to RedBubble.<br>If I end up finding a better site, I'll move them eventually, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.<br><br>I went ahead and got my first design, the Rachnera Emblem, uploaded and available for purchase on a t-shirt (or a number of other things, actually).<br><br>http://www.redbubble.com/people/log<wbr>anagle/works/15378617-rachnera-skul<wbr>l?grid_pos=1&amp;p=t-shirt<br><br>I'll get the English version of the Suu Warning Sign corrected and uploaded tomorrow, as well as my other designs that I've been polishing.<br><br> I also understand that linking personal information anywhere on 4chan is a gamble, but Hell, I don't even have my own website yet, so there's not much to doxx if someone decided to be an asshole and do so, so whatever, I'll take my chances and say that anybody who cares enough to look at my page is a nice enough guy to not bother with stuff like that. <br><br>And once again, just a reminder:<br>I'm still taking requests for ideas for graphics and t-shirt designs. If you have one, suggest it, and I may be able to make it for you free of charge.<br><br>Here's hoping this jump-starts my little graphic-design career.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>STOP GIVING HER IDEAS</br></br>  <br><br> Since MMniN basically prints merchandising money <br><br>Have we had confirmation of this in any tangible sense?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I still want my hats. But if you really wanted to go full scale on the designs and shit we could make a "community" googledrive/pastebin with various MonMonsume threads' OC</br>  <br>based</br>  <br><br>This list should include Merino, Tonn and Cott.<br>Sheepy-ears aren't THAT cool, but they're still pretty nice and fun to pinch.</br></br></br>  <br>I guess I'm doing pretty good then</br>  <br><br><br>Ears should be ranked according to how expressive they are and how cute they look on the character.<br><br>Ninetei undoubtedly wins in both cases since almost every panel involves her expressing emotion with them, and they're cute adorable fox ears, while the others generally have floppy barely-expressive ears that look varying degrees of cute on them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>MM doesn't have a SINGLE Figma!<br>you know a series is financially popular if it has FIGMAS</br></br>  <br><br> She just wants to poison you so she can roe to the depth of love she shows <br><br> roe <br><br>Did you mean "row"?<br><br>If so, this was a Freudian Slip.<br><br>Guess what the word "roe" connotates:<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm just saying. When the police come in after hearing a stuggle or someone calls them and they find a dead body surrounded by or drenched in water, obviously all eyes are going to go to Mero<br>But, say you "trip" and fall down the stairs, breaking every bone in your body. Who could have done that? I mean, you could brush that off as an accident, or maybe Papi or Cerea's massive horse butt bumped into him<br>Or, what if they find the body in the kitchen with an obvious wound created by a sharp pbject. Rachne could be blamed. Miia's been trying her hand at cooking and probably miss-held a utensil.<br>And while we're on the topic of food, what about poisoning? Miia's food looks like something straight out of The Thing--maybe that killed him<br><br>Murder is all about planning ahead. It's not something you do on a whim. You must plan it out, the intricate details down to the wire. Unless you want to get caught, you must find a way to hide evidence or pile them onto someone else<br>Oh god, wait a tick. I think I got too into this. I sound like a psychopath. I knew watching murder mystery films was a bad idea</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey there, I'm the guy who gave you the idea for the suu design.<br><br>If you still feel like shooting me a shirt once you get it uploaded, I'd be appreciative.<br><br> gairwise@gmail.com </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just want to say that your stuff is pretty cool, but be on the watch out for C&amp;Ds probably from whoever picks up the anime, especially if it's FUNimation. Seven Seas doesn't gave a shit, since they haven't bothered with scanlators, but the anime companies are way harsher about this stuff.</br>  <br><br>Yes</br></br>  <br><br>I will do my best, but I'm broke as fuck.<br><br>I do get a 5$ discount for ordering my own shirt, but even that isn't super great.<br><br>Believe me, if I weren't a clinically broke loser still looking for full-time employment, I'd send you one pro-bono without a second thought. But as it stands, I'll have to wait and see what my finances allow.<br><br>Once I'm a globe-trotting CEO with a tennis-court on his yacht, I'll send you a bunch of free shirts. How about that?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If she's a zombie how come she still has fair skin and is able to blush? Logic says she shouldn't have blood pumping through her body for that to happen, she has a heart but it's not beating, through I did find it strange that her right breast fell off with no blood splatter at all, yet she was shot full of holes in her debut chapter and there was blood everywhere.</br>  <br> FUNimation <br>Don't even mention it. I can only imagine the hell that will happen if funi picks it up and the anime watchers will be split between people with sense and the faggots who stream or use HorribleSubs and actually don't have the sense to realize that funi is unwatchable shit.</br></br>   Yurika Kubo as Tionishia <br><br>Japan can't cast for shit, can they?</br></br>  <br><br>This is true, but most of my designs are so simplified, ambiguous or abstract that it's hard to even prove where they came from.<br><br>So long as I'm not appropriating copyrighted concept-art or the like (all of my images are hand-made originals, just arguably "inspired" by things in the media), I should theoretically be fine unless they just have a massive all-consuming hard-on for C&amp;D's.<br><br> But barring that, maybe you're right. In that case BUY MY SHIRTS NOW BUY MY SHIRTS NOW BUY MY SHIRTS NOW, WHILE THEYR'E STILL THERE, HURRY BEFORE THEY DISAPPEAR, TIME FOR IMPULSE-PURCHASES. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Get a job, you hippie. <br><br>I have a grade 8 education and make 15 burger coupons an hour. There's literally something for everyone out there.</br></br></br>  <br> telling someone to get a job <br> on NEET central /a/ </br></br>  <br><br>Oh, I have a job. It's just that most of it goes towards rent until I can find a better one.</br></br>    <br><br>I expected MON uniforms to be not so bright and obvious.

I'm sorry you've got nothing to hold onto but fanfiction and fanart.</br>  Kinda funny how many yurifags laid down the Reinahating because of last ep.<br><br> critically BTFO </br></br>  <br>If you want to blame someone blame KyoAni  for picking this up. </br>  <br>Exactly 20 years later</br>  <br> Reina's relationship with Kumiko makes her seem sweeter and more human <br> Reina's "relationship" with Taki-sensei makes her seem like an obsessive idiot <br>Fuck this, I'm not a yurifag but Kumiko/Reina is a lot more positive for Reina's character.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm not a yurifag <br>See, now you are trying too hard.  Not that I'm disagreeing with the premise. </br></br>  <br>That's precisely my point, however.<br>Let the anime do it's thing. This isn't to say that the novels are inherently bad or that Takeda is a bad writer or anything, but KyoAni's just doing a better job.</br></br>  <br>I honestly want them to pick a manga. They do great shows with manga as source.</br>  <br> Implying the character won't keep their canon love interests. <br>Anon please.</br></br>  <br> When Taki sensei tells her about his dead wife and his dream, she's incredible hurt. But she decides to work even harder to reach the nationals, because Taki's hapiness is her hapiness. It makers her a noble character with a strong will. I love her. </br>  <br>I'm more interested in Mizore and Nozomi. I hope KyoAni if they do a second season development well that and Asuka.</br>  <br> for Taki. <br>Not for Kitauji like the rest of the students.</br></br>  <br>I'm not. <br>I'm saying that should we get to the second novel where Reina's personality is reduced a bit closer to a gimmick, she'd likely be better written.</br></br>  <br>Her forehead is too huge.</br>  Reina's love reminds me weirdly of Sakura's.  <br>Mizore x Asuka for s2 otp<br>Apparently the return of Mizore's flute gf irritates the otherwise hollow Asuka.</br></br>  <br>Duh, he's the reason why she's in that school in the first place.</br>  <br>KyoAni is gonna focus on Mizore and Nozomi. They are the main plot after all.</br>  <br>That's selfish, and pathetic. At least the others are doing it for the school.</br>  <br>But KumikoxMizore is OTP.</br>  <br>Asuka/Mizore/Nozomi/Kumiko promos when?</br>  <br>look at this commie</br>  <br>She wants to go to nationals. She's wanted nationals before she went to Kitauji.</br>  <br>No, they're doing it for themselves. Kumiko is playing because she loves Eupho not because she wants Kitauji to win; she wants to win herself.</br>  <br>So working hard for the person you love is bad? geeh, hopefully you'll never love anyone and have a family of your own.</br>  soon...™  <br>I think KyoAni's the one that knows what KyoAni will do, including whether or not they'll make a second season at all. <br><br>We can make guesses sure, but if I'd read the first novel before watching this season, there's no way I would have predicted what KyoAni did with the story, except in a very broad sense.</br></br></br>  <br>She wanted to become special for Taki's sake before she even met Kumiko</br>  <br> before she even met Kumiko <br> Not in the anime. </br></br>  <br> He's known her since she was 10-11 </br>  <br>She met Taki in middle school. She went to the same middle school and was in band with Kumiko. She's known them for the same amount of time, pay attention.</br>    <br> Psst.  Not in the anime.  </br>  <br>As expected from specialist girl.</br>  <br> she wants to win herself. <br>And that's fine.

Good enough to the point that she'd fight on behalf of her juniors, among which Ribbon belonged to. She's brave, but allowed herself to be a sacrifice and was at the mercy of slacker upperclassmen taking her spot. She's strong, but also someone you want to protect. <br>And on top of all that, there's this  scene, THIS SCENE where Ribbon, giving Kaori an honest complement on her abilities which we know she had/has, and is answered with humility on Kaori's part, stating that she's only doing it out of love for the instrument. And it's that moment that Ribbon realized that Kaori wasn't just a "good person", but that she was the purest form of good she'd ever find in this lifetime, and was powerless to stop herself from falling in love with her. <br><br>And before you think I'm special or am getting any of this from the novels, think again, because they don't go jack shit into their relationship.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Reika pls</br></br>  I think we can all agree Natsuki has been our savior this season  <br>Initially I disliked her. I still do, though for different reasons. At least she's interesting now.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2G-<wbr>eViqPhfg</wbr>  [ ]<br>According to the OST, Rikka or some school will play Rimsky-Korsakov "Scheherazade" at the concert tomorrow. Most likely Rikka though since Azusa said they'll meet again at the tournament.</br>  <br>Buchou has been the saviour of this season and will lead us to Zenkoku</br>  <br>I love her so much. But  Seeing her saintly behavior makes me disgusted about myself </br>  <br>Her development has quietly been one of the best this series.</br>  <br>Natsuki is overrated as fuck. Don't get me wrong, I like her, but she's one of the least interesting characters and barely gets any screentime or development. She's just there to be cute and sleepy, which is fine, but there's not much more to her character.</br>  <br>I hear she gets more stuff in the second and third novel.</br>  <br><br>I disagree with you about least interesting character.<br><br>but i know to trust you when you say you like based natsuki because sleepy natsuki is best natsuki</br></br></br></br>  <br>can't wait for tomorrow, going from<br> I'm such a bad president <br>to<br> KITAUCHI, FIGHTO </br></br></br></br>  <br>This is the best edit so far.

I've seen so many people praise KyoAni as the pinnacle of anime. Though content wise these have been adapting series with mediocre writing. Animation wise they look appealing but it isn't considered good animation because it mostly backgrounds, shot with massive amounts of light everywhere. And it's known that KyoAni have below average production values. Now they do have a few gems such as Haruhi, Disappearance Movie, Full Metal Panic especially Fumoffu, and Hyouka which can be subjective because the story is really boring depending on the person. However they do adapt a lot of mediocre series that have terrible writing in it.<br><br>Now I'm not saying KyoAni is a bad Studio because they are far from it, but why do some people think they are the best Studio? If you look at their content it says otherwise.</br></br>  <br>Not him, but while I agree that they should be praised for that, I wouldn't look at the project and say "Wow, how embarrassing for all the people who didn't try this specific and never-before-done format," you know. <br><br><br>  Extreme opinions on absolutely everything <br>Coming from the guy with the most extreme opinions in the thread, nice. Also, congratulations on finding a way to fill a paragraph without saying anything except that people are stupid and don't exchange ideas well enough.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like you.<br>Get a trip, pls.<br><br>Also, do you have a blog or twitter?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't even bother, this thread is already worse than TMSposting. You'd be shitposting in a sewer.</br>   people still replying to the Aniplex guy <br><br>Really?</br></br>  Only the ultimate masochist weeb would say they enjoy any Kyoanus work, they are trying too hard to look cool using filters and shiny colors, yet they make the same mistake at using boring and uninteresting source material like Hyouka and Hibike, they should just go back to comedy  Absolute perfection  <br><br>I want to have sex with her.</br></br>  Where did she get the squid?<br> Captcha of fish </br>  Wish the OVA had more scenes between Kanye and Sento.<br><br>Season 2 when Kyoani?</br></br>  Why are KyoAni girls so perfect?

You've never slept wrong and fucked up your neck before? It can happen, Why this one time, a couple of years ago, I thought it would be a brilliant idea to try and sleep upside down like a bat by going to sleep with my legs up against the wall ended up nearly suffocating due to the position I was un pushing my boobs up against my nose.</br>  I prefer LATIFA SAMA  <br>Is this an accurate portray of two betas trying to flirt?</br>  I just watched it. Season 2 soon I hope, I don't bother with light novels.  Episode 6 and 7 of the mini theater when?  <br>Episode 6 is already out</br>  <br><br>Holy fucking shit dude. Why couldn't you keep your fucking mouth shut.<br><br>God fucking damn it, that honestly looks painful.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She shlicks so hard to Kanye every night her fingers have deformed</br>  <br>The fuck is wrong with her right hand (our left)?</br>  <br>Maybe her butt hurts.</br>  After long term inner debate about all of the girls in Amagi Brilliant Park, I've come to the conclusion that Earth would respond the most positively to being dicked.<br><br>One, she's already reading dirty, dirty fujoshi material. We all know that yaoi is only a gateway for these types of girls. This is only a cover for them, giving them the power to lie to themselves as they quickly move on to secretly indulge in their deepest, darkest hetero fantasies and break into new fetishes and levels of kink.<br><br>Why it wouldn't surprise me if this fairy has amassed all kinds of fetish doujinshi, raiding the Amagi Brilliant Park world's own version of Sadpanda, gathering a collection measured in gigabytes and furiously rubbing herself every night with her eyes closed, imagining Kanie finding her stash and ravishing her body in the various ways pictured within. For a lewd girl like her this won't cut it for long, and she'll have to experience the real thing for herself.<br><br>It will start innocently enough, perhaps asking him to help her in her room. Using the wiles learned from her choice reading material however, she'll soon lure his hands to her firm and supple body. Of course, his hands will only do so much for the curious girl. Before long she'd be completely nude and on her back, Kanie kneeling between her legs, his furiously raging erection gripped hard in his hand as he lines himself up at her soaking entrance. As he pushes into her with one long stroke, she'll involuntarily arch her back and push back against him, taking him as deeply as possible, unsatisfied until every bit of that hard dick is inside her. Her hand will quickly cover her mouth, stopping a deep feminine moan at being taken from emanating and alerting the other girls to their actions.<br><br>Then, the intense mating session will begin in full. There will be no condoms for this lewd fairy, and no rest until every drop contained in his balls is deeply inside her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is Silphy so  fucking stupid?   <br>You could say she's  an airhead </br>  <br> not childish </br>  Air is an airhead<br>Earth is dirty<br>Fire is NOT a hothead<br>Water is ???</br></br></br>  <br> Wind <br> Stupid <br> Recognizes the superiority of the katana <br> Knows she'll be be targeted first by any invaders of the park as they fear and respect her killing potential <br><br>Sure, sure.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Water is  life </br>  <br>I'd like to make some new life right here.</br>  <br>I'm calling the cops.</br>  <br>high test</br>  <br>Water is love.</br>    <br>I wanna roll my tongue all over that</br>  <br>Just because Earth is the kind of girl who would peep on changing shotas and make them rub their cocks together while watching is no reason to call the police.</br>  <br><br>Shame they'll never get together, even in the books.</br></br>  <br>Silphy is so randum xD the character.

The story is really wtf. I don't know if I'd be able to read the story and not be bored.<br><br>Did anyone here read the LN? Is it better than what I imagine?</br></br>  <br>How did anyone except Sylphy even get their roles?</br>  <br>Park is desperate, Musu may be the leader of the group but Slyphy is the most popular one at the park, she's even got a podcast.</br>  <br>inheritance</br>  <br>Pillow fairies.</br>  <br>Slyphy is a literal meme character.

Anyways if you have even a basic understanding of japanese, it's clear the TL has no idea what the characters are actually saying. It's simply not questionable word choice or editing that's the issue, but plain out getting lines completely wrong. Take the text message Muse sent Sento for example, you could easily guess the contents but what he wrote doesn't make any sense considering the text is clearly written there with no room mistake.</br>  <br><br>now you're just making shit up</br></br>  <br>it's her rifle</br>  <br/>  <br>Enjoy your ignorance.

We were only around to witness a portion of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah what last episode stated was that UBW continues on its own. They can always give more info on the dismantling of the grail 8 years after this episode.</br>  <br>Enough with your rhino queen, now it's time for her imouto to shine.</br>  <br>I was referring to Last Episode.<br><br><br>Pass-o</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sakura doesn't really shine in HF though.</br>  <br>Sakura never shines. People like HF for Kotomine and Illya. Sakura is barely a character, she's more like a walking plot point.</br>  <br>What if it had been Matou Rin and Tohsaka Sakura?</br>  <br> Sakura never shines. <br>Well, duh. Black Holes don't let light escape.</br></br>  <br>Well, we already got a  Rin clone and Waver doing mage shit FOR the Clock Tower </br>  <br> Shirou dies as he isn't saved, the end. <br>There that's pretty much all there is to it.</br></br>  <br>After HF<br><br>Do you really think it's over after the success of the first two?<br><br>This is Fate we're talking about here. Unlimited Milk Works</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou, if you become a bad boy, I will scold you.</br>  <br>Rin steals Shirou's virginity after falling for him and then kills herself to take down Zouken before the war. Sakura Tohsaka won't search for a fight in school or even try in the war so Shirou doesn't need a heart fix. Since Shirou never gets his servant, Illya kills him. <br><br>BAD END.</br></br></br>  <br>Young adult Rin is a miracle of the universe</br>  <br><br> Sakura <br>The talented master of the Thosaka family. Kinder and less cunning than OG Rin, but her decisions tend to backfire less too. Doesn't put up the perfect girl facade, but she's nice to everyone and well loved among her classmates.<br><br> Rin  <br>The real master of the Matous and school's queen bee. Cold hearted and with an iron will, has managed to build a symmetrical relationship with Zouken. She can't get rid of him but her powers allow her to keep him from making her comply, it's a perpetual chess game between those two. Abuses Shinji and pretty much everyone around her, and doesn't take part in the war just to mess up with Zouken's plans. Until she takes an interest in Shirou, that is.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's what I've been telling you fags all along.<br><br> Hair down is best hair style. </br></br></br></br>  <br>This ending was too much, fuck UFO and their cocktease.</br>  <br>Blonde+green eyes please, like Saber.</br>  <br>I can't believe we actually got London shenanigans, it's like Ufo read our threads.</br>  <br>You have Extra Rin for that.</br>  <br><br> Tohsaka Sakura <br> passive <br>She'd be Luvia-tier in smug arrogance.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>The sad fact of Rin as a Mage is that she simply doesn't have the mentality to achieve the goal of all Magi - she's far, far too human. Her dad was similar, although he at least knew he needed to detach himself from the human experience to stand a chance, however shit he was at it. Rin will probably die having recreated a perfect copy of one of Zelretch's relics or something, an achievement in its own right, but she won't be able to properly communicate what went into its making, let alone use it to reach the Maelstrom of Origins. She'll leave her work, the mounted progress of the Tohsaka lineage, to an heir who is not guaranteed to be a prodigy like her, and with the steady decline of Magecraft, may even be of inferior overall talent.<br><br>The only way to reach Akasha in this day and age is to throw away your useless humanity and surpass mortal perception. Only monsters willing to embody an ideal - throwing away everything in pursuit of a single transcendent theory - like Araya, Kurogiri, Roa, and Nrvnqsr have what it takes.<br><br>So the rest of Rin's life probably isn't all that interesting.<br><br><br><br>There is this, though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The real master of the Matous and school's queen bee. Cold hearted and with an iron will <br><br>That's fucking stupid.<br><br>Penis worms would break Rin just the same.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder who had the bright idea. Not only did they read the threads they went beyond, the most I could envision for the ending was a 10 second airport scene implying they were going to London.</br>  <br> She'd be Luvia-tier in smug arrogance. <br>Eh no, Sakura does have some of those traits but to the minimum. Her true personality is the one you see already.</br></br>  <br>Her true personality was fucked up by worms.</br>  <br>Sakura's personality in FSN is not all based on the fucking dick worms. You are stupid.</br>  <br>She really is.<br>I forgot how much I missed her before.</br></br>  <br>No it wasn't, nice fan fiction though.</br>    <br><br>Stay mad and wrong.</br></br>  <br>Nasu did.</br>  <br> The only way to reach Akasha in this day and age is to throw away your useless humanity and surpass mortal perception <br>That's a nice headcanon you have there.</br></br>  <br>Rin really does not care that much about going that far with her magic. Yes she is dedicated as fuck but it is hard imagine her going to the point where she would sacrifice her life and leave Shirou alone just to push the lineage even further. Like you said Rin is too emotional/human to be a all or nothing mage.</br>  <br>I am not wrong, the only time she had her personality fucked up by worms was before she met Shirou were she was a dead fish.</br>  <br>Adult Ilya &gt; Adult Rin</br>  <br>What if it had been Tohsaka Sakura AND Tohsaka Rin?<br>I'm sure Rin would've been fine with sharing her crest with her imouto.</br></br>  <br><br>There's literally a bad end where Rin gets subjected to penisworms in Sakura's enclosed shadow space. It fucks her up.<br><br>It doesn't matter how strong her will is, she's still a loli when it'd begin. It'd still traumatize her. It'd traumatize anyone.<br><br>The best she could do is act rebellious like Kariya, but it's not like that sort of temperament has any meaning in the long run, not until the Fifth Holy Grail starts and she gets the slightest opportunity to take control like Sakura did.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Better than Rin.    <br>Pretty sure Illya is considered to 17/18 in the novels...</br>  <br> So the rest of Rin's life probably isn't all that interesting. <br>Maybe for HF Rin but UBW Rin will follow her husbando and she still has a grail to dismantle.</br></br>  <br>You know the biggest difference would be that Zouken doesn't need to change Rin's alignment via wormrape because with Average One she already includes Water.<br><br>Also their personalities were already distinct when the seperation happened</br></br></br>  <br>It fucks everyone up, that doesn't mean it changes your fucking personality you retard.</br>  <br><br>Okay, that's not QUITE true. You can also be like the Aozakis, but even then there's weird shit going on.<br><br>The only EXPEDIENT way is to throw away your humanity, I mean. And not any of this half-assed "hurr I sacrifice street urchins for magic crystals" idiocy. All of the closest fucks to Akasha who aren't True Magic users are out of their fucking minds. Actually, probably them too, considering how True Magic seems to eat at one's identity, as mentioned with Aoko and Zelretch, and the Einzberns aren't even human anymore, just an experiment desperately trying to come to its conclusion)</br></br></br></br>  <br>And she stopped growing at like 8</br>  <br> Years of continuous trauma and isolation can't affect your personality </br>  <br>Illya's whole appeal is that she doesn't stop being a loli.</br>  <br><br>But it certainly doesn't mean Rin would turn out remotely dominant in the Matou household. You are seriously overestimating Rin's capacity to rebel against Zouken here. That's what I take issue with.</br></br>  <br>You know through all of TM it shows that people who throw their humanity away fail at reaching the root.</br>  <br>Not for Sakura, that's the whole point of her character.</br>  <br>I always thought her appeal was being completely and totally perfect<br> Though being a loli is part of that </br></br>  <br>But he'd still do it, because what he needs is a doll , a doll who becomes the grail.</br>  <br>That's what Sakura has to make her special. Rin would just break and be Zouken's pawn since she has none of that.</br>  <br>I wasn't this anon<br>In the first place, if you have issues with that quote him. My only argument is that the worms aren't completely what shape Sakura's personality, and thinking She becomes a Luvia clone is even more retarded.</br></br>  <br>someone's gonna get bullied. This is Isshei's worst nightmare</br>  <br>you are retarded.<br>Creating a grail was never his plan.</br></br>  <br>I am not Nasu so I don't fucking know. Rin hasn't shown to be weak either and thinking she will break is as much fan fiction as the guy thinking Sakura is Luvia but raped.</br>  <br>So basically Rin wouldn't even get the purple hair.</br>  <br>Who the fuck knows.<br>It's magic</br></br>  <br>Well obviously she has to try if she wants to MAKE MONEY</br>  <br>She'll be a Saber soon enough.<br>All life will eventually be Saber.</br></br>  <br> Rin hasn't shown to be weak either and thinking she will break is as much fan fiction </br>  <br>That's all Luvia has over Rin. Luvia can't even get a sword husbando.</br>  <br>Most romantic scene in the entire anime</br>  <br>Same shit happened with Sakura at the start for 3 days straight, your point?</br>  <br>Should I remind you of the scene in Zero?</br>  Tsundere's tsun sublimates into simply becoming even hotter when they go through college, and begin losing the tsun.  I want to marry Rin. She would be a perfect wife.  <br>Did anyone get a Shoujo MC vibe from grown Shirou?</br>  <br>Rin may be crude and strong but she does not have Sakura's ridiculous ability to endure horrific conditions. She'd break after Kariya the failure chunnibyou dies in front of her. In fact, I get the feeling she wouldn't last the ten years Sakura did.</br>  <br>It's beautiful.</br>  <br>Rin's tsun is nothing special though, most of the time she was friendly.</br>  <br> She'd be Luvia-tier in smug arrogance. <br>Yeah, because one or two gag scenes in the fandisc defines her personality better than everything we've seen in the original VN.</br></br>  <br><br>Ilya rute when?</br></br>  <br>That's prisma.</br>  <br> does not have Sakura's ridiculous ability to endure horrific conditions. <br>kek.</br></br>  I wonder if Sakura could of pulled the infamous "Tohsoka smile" if she were raised with her  <br>Probably, or she might just have a different variation of her evil gloom.</br>  <br>Sakura's body had to be fucked up a lot for her to adapt to the Matou magic's "water" alignment. <br>Rin already has that atribute because she's an Average One, so she doesn't need the Matou treatment in the first place.<br>All it's left for her is to learn how to use that magic to control the worms.</br></br></br>  <br>Rin is old and busted. Luvia is the new hotness.</br>  <br>Oh God, is she dead/dying there?<br>Is this form HF?</br></br>  <br>That's a stubbed toe next to what Sakura went through every day.</br>  <br>The worms are supposed to control the host. Even Zouken says that the older sister would have been better. Sakura is just too much trouble.</br>  <br> Luvia is the new hotness. <br>More like the new fatness.</br></br>  <br>She's gonna be alright,right? Because it looks like her torso exploded. Then again, Sakura gets torn shreds by Gilgamesh and comes out of it fine and I think Shirou was scoping up his intestines at one point, The novel is pretty gory about injuries now that I think about it.</br>  We knew Rin and Luvia were hostile to each other in the original VN endings that mentioned the rival Rin had at the Clock Tower.<br><br>Either they made the rivalry fun, or they made them actually hate each other's guts like Blue and Dirty Red.</br></br>  <br> The worms are supposed to control the host. <br>No they aren't.<br>The worms work as a "crest" of sort to teach magecraft</br></br></br>  <br>That's Fate.<br><br>Yeah sure, because you know what worm rape feels like right?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, and Zouken just wants someone he can control, to eventually do whatever he wants to do with the body.<br>Breaking her spirit was part of the training.</br></br>  <br>Yeah she uses her magic to repair herself somehow unlike those two who had bullshit auto repair because of circumstances.</br>    <br><br>The purpose is to train the body not the mind. The mind is a nuisance. Zouken doesn't want something that can resist him.</br></br>  <br> The worms are supposed to control the host. <br>The worms are supposed to be controlled. <br>The crest worm is the only worm that can somewhat influence the user, and that's Zouken's own addition to Sakura's body.</br></br></br>  <br>The crest worm only made Sakura horny in HF, she wasn't a mindless vessel for Zouken or anything close to that. <br>The mind control thing is part of your own headcanon.</br></br>  Rin would kill herself and Zouken if she was a Matou is plain an simple. It's how her character works, she doesn't mind dying if she takes down her enemy.  <br> The purpose is to train the body not the mind. <br>That's the whole Makiri magecraft was set up to begin with even before Zouken.<br> The mind is a nuisance. Zouken doesn't want something that can resist him. <br>Zouken's entire goal outside of HF is having Sakura have talented children that are more compatible with Matou-magecraft to win him the grail.<br> Also he's a completly nice granpa outside of the magic lessons </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She'll be a Saber soon enough. <br> All life will eventually be Saber. <br>You say that as if it were a bad thing?<br><br> Redesign <br>Seems like an original character. Or is that supposed to be currybutt?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That ahoge seems out of place.</br>  <br>Currybutt loses her original design and her hair partitions. Now Rin is even more unique, while everyone is a Saber clone. Sasuga Takeuchi.</br>  <br> That ahoge seems out of place. <br>Never paid attention to Saber designs?</br></br>  <br>But Rin is an Akiha clone</br>  <br>I was talking about the hair partition and hair design.</br>  <br>Akiha is a Saber clone now. They even have the same bust size.</br>  <br>Is Saber's ahoge an erogenous zone?</br>  <br>What? why did they upgrade her boobs?</br>  <br> That Hassan Saber </br>  <br>Nah Rin is a fusion of Akiha, Ciel and Kohaku.<br> tomboy, ojou, sensei,tsundere wearing a "mask" while having Kohaku's attitude </br></br>  <br> wearing a "mask" while having Kohaku's attitude <br>This is dumb. you're dumb.</br></br>  <br>Prisma isn't Ilya route, it's her "game". She's the MC there.</br>  <br> Prisma isn't Ilya route, it's her "game". She's the MC there. <br>Actually, given that it's implied that  Kuro is FSN-Ilya  it's not even her game but her  twin's/clone's </br></br>  <br>   Kuro is FSN-Ilya <br>Far from it. None of the Illyas in prisma are actual FSN Illya.</br></br>  F/GO release when?  <br>Two years post-UBW Rin looks like a beautiful girl her age.<br>Two years post-HF Rin looks like a grandma.<br><br>Is that the power of Emiya Shirou's dick?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Before Tsukihime remake, that's for sure :^).</br></br>  <br> Two years post-HF Rin looks like a grandma. <br>What? <br>Did you miss the gazillion times Sakura said "It's spring again"?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, without him the stress probably gets to her.</br>  <br>But the Tsuki remake is coming in 2020.</br>  <br><br>She looks fine to me.</br></br>  <br> tfw I won't read the translated remake of Tsukihime until I'm 30+ <br><br>I should just kill myself</br></br></br>  <br>Sakurafag here. <br>This makes me doubt my loyalty to mai waifu, luckily Rin will never look that good in canon.</br></br>  <br><br> not being 100% loyal to Sakura <br><br>Nigga, we've yet to see Sakura's HF design by UFO, she looked really good in the anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Caring husbando that cooks <br> Spoils her <br> Watches her back against Mages <br> Makes her feel safe at night <br> Jackhammering <br> Gives her a goal besides Mage shit <br> Has something over Luvia because Shero is hers <br><br>VS<br><br> Lonely repetitive mage life tormented by OHOHOHOs <br><br>The answer is obvious.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The fact that you would consider abandoning your waifu even if she is Sakura is disgusting, but that is what Rin looks like in canon as she ages. You've seen her at the end of HF right? She's simply younger than .png you're looking at.</br>  <br>Jesus christ, they would eat Shirou alive.<br>Would it be worth the crazy sex?</br></br>  <br>Rin wouldn't need the dickworms nearly as much, since she already has the required Water element.</br>  <br> Understated, minimalist design <br> Gives off an air of power like Touko or Aoko <br> Manages to look both young and wise <br>   Jackhammers like a tiger when you get her out of that coat <br><br>I like it, definitely preferable to some generic kawaii magic girl design.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's also the fact that she'd break way quicker.</br>  <br> Lonely repetitive mage life tormented by OHOHOHOs <br><br>not<br><br> getting to be the best possible you alongside your well endowed rival/  friend<br/> <br> recreating the Gem Sword and the Second Magic  <br> getting a place among the top 100 magi in history <br> knowing your imouto is safe and sound and not being raped or filled by old worms anymore <br> occasional mana transfer with Rider <br> endless hatesex sessions with Luvia </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sakura cried for 3 days. Also getting raped is not something to be joyous about.</br>  <br>Sakura broke on the first hours too, read Zero, filthy wormfag.</br>  <br>The top one is still better.<br><br> knowing your imouto is safe and sound and not being raped or filled by old worms anymore <br>Doesn't apply as this is only known in HF.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought you were comparing Rin's end in UBW vs. HF</br>  <br>I think his point was that Tohsaka doesn't know about worms in UBW.</br>  <br>I wasn't talking about UBW</br>  <br>I was being more broad also <br> recreating the Gem Sword and the Second Magic  <br> getting a place among the top 100 magi in history <br>I don't think she gives much of a fuck about this.<br> endless hatesex sessions with Luvia <br>Already happens.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Literally trash tier.</br></br>  <br>As a VS it doesn't work because UBW Rin doesn't know of it so it's not like its hunting her.</br>  Daily reminder that ilyashit is a no route cancer shit.  <br>What?</br>  She's going to be in the HF epilogue.  Taiga will be married and there will be baby.    the HF epilogue will show Rin's bald, fat, wealthy husband she was forced to marry because the line must go on <br> Shirou won't care <br> mfw waifufags' response by then </br></br>  <br>Daily reminder that taboo origin is suffering.</br>  <br>With all the time constrains she might make a 3 second appearance.</br>  <br>I'll could see everything but, Taiga getting married. She's a wandering cloud.</br>  <br>No it won't, stay mad.</br>  <br> MTSP doujins confirmed canon </br>  <br> trying to pit Sakura and Rin fags against each other <br>Come out, Sabershit.</br></br>  <br>Come on, it would be fun.</br>  <br> Sakurafags </br>  <br>  &gt;there will be baby  <br> this is enough for me</br></br>  <br>It's True end not Normal.</br>  <br> Taiga will never take a trip to London and reunite with her childhood husbando. </br>  <br><br>Sister alliance stronk, a shame everybody forgot about shortly after the UBW/HF revelation.</br></br>  <br>I don't think you understand the definition of childhood.</br>  <br> childhood <br>She's well past that age</br></br>  <br>You mean everyone went full shitposting after that.</br>  That beach doujin by Shiwasu has Taiga look alike. I don't particularly like Taiga, but I had a good fap.  Do people actually like sakura, or is it just a meme to piss off rinfags/saberfags? <br><br>I can understand not liking rin/saber, but i cannot for the fucking life of me understand why anyone would like sakura. She's just so fucking uninteresting.</br></br>  <br>Below the age of 18? Although:<br><br><br>Apparently I'm wrong on that. She's in a HS uniform so I figured she was still a teenager during the 4th War.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A wall has more character than Saber.</br>  <br><br> uninteresting. <br><br>For you.<br><br>If anything, I find Saber the most boring one. Skipped a lot of her scenes in F/HA.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigger she can do magic and she's with a living armory who's made it his mission in life to become a superhero. They play off each other well and there's still a lot of dangerous shit out there they need to deal with. I don't know how much better of a premise you need.</br>  <br>The fact that Sakura still has her purple hair and eyes while the worms didn't change Rin's apperace at all triggers my autism.</br>  <br>It's obvious some truly like her.</br>  <br>This is lewd.</br>  <br>Your autism triggers mine.</br>  <br> adult Ilya  <br> implying her body won't fall apart in a year at most </br></br>  <br>Purple Rin</br>  <br>So does Shirou still have PTSD?</br>  <br> i cannot for the fucking life of me understand why anyone would like sakura. <br>There's this thing called taste, and Sakura does not suit your taste. Now, imagine someone who likes the things about Sakura that disinterest you. Perspective is a wonderful thing.<br><br>After the UBW finale I'm really excited to see HF.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think you're looking at it wrong, Sakura is the one with black hair. Remember she uses her hair in two ponytails when she's a kid too.</br></br>  <br>He has survivor's guilt.</br>  <br>Except it's explicitly stated that he doesn't.</br>  <br>Was this line in the original VN? Because I'm pretty sure Shirou has smiled before in his character sprite.</br>  <br>That's denial it's common.</br>  <br>And in other instances it does</br>  <br> Falseflagging Saberfags, the nicest fanbase in Fate <br><br>Okay.</br></br></br>  <br>That's just how he rationalizes it. <br>The diagnosis still stands despite what he has to say on the matter.</br></br>  What would happen if Shirou met pic related?  <br>Overrated shit.</br>  <br><br>You guys are retards, that guy was an Illyashitter.</br></br>  <br>He kind of was that for all of F/SN.<br>If the viewpoint was from Rin's eyes the whole time, Shirou would be this mysterious, dark-past Shoujo crush who slowly grows to love her over time.</br></br>  <br>Thanks Takeuchi!</br>  <br>Fate route. Kotomine shows up and beats the ever loving shit out of Rin for Shirou and Saber to find when they come home.</br>  <br> streaming </br>  <br>Not only does he kill Tokiomi but he also kills RIn in Fate? fuck Kirei and his chuuni bullshit.</br>  <br>He wasn't wrong.</br>  <br>She doesn't die. In fact, Rin passes on the Azoth Dagger to Shirou.<br>Shirou then confronts Kotomine and stabs it into his chest.<br>What comes around, goes around.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, only route Rin dies.<br><br>This is bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br> Rin <br> Dying </br></br>  <br>Maybe he wasn't any of the above and just a shitposter.</br>  <br>Sure is.</br>  <br>Well design wise he wasn't until the timeskip. So you don't really think he is one until the timeskip happens and it hits you.</br>    <br> luckily Rin will never look that good in canon. <br><br>That's from the Heaven's Feel epilogue</br></br></br>  <br> hating the best fate </br>  <br>No that's concept art.</br>  <br>He is only good in Zero and in the last parts of HF.</br>  <br>Bless UFO for they have made her better.</br>  NANA FUCKING WILLS IT<br><br>Exterminate is up on youtube.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=659<wbr>x2xV0RBY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>4 more days</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I hate Nana Mizuki fans.  Tomorrow is the EP1 premiere with Aoi/Iguchi/Hikasa, so just be aware that spoilers will start surfacing by then.  Another thread?<br>Fine by me.</br>  Reposting theory on /m/.<br> Director said Hibiki will face a new problem related to her "echoing root". <br> "Hibiki" literally means "echo" <br> Going around helping people is just her "echoing" Kanade's action, not what she truly want to do herself. <br> Hibiki's berserker mode is her suppressed rage being released. <br> "Exterminate the darkness inside your heart and become a new you" <br> Darkness: "echoing"/copying Kanade's action to justify her existence <br> Hibiki exterminates her "echoing root" <br> Let her emotions freely "soar to the heaven" <br> Goes berserk and proceed to destroy the world. <br>It'd kind of explain the logo too. Kaneko said G was the story of Hibiki after she became a hero, GX will be "the end of the G", a.k.a "the end of Hibiki's heroism".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm Fine.</br>  <br>I didnt see another one. Its Fine though</br>  <br> echoing kanade <br>not really though, the whole kanade was the 'dont give up living' or whatever not go be selfless. the whole giving her body for the public was more of a survival guilt thing than a kanade thing.</br></br>  <br>She goes around telling people not to give up their live while ready to give up her own at the moment of notice. It's exactly what Kanade did.</br>  <br>She specifically denies that.</br>  Was it all PR?  <br> CRS-7 <br> 7 <br>Yes.</br></br></br>  <br> inb4 there's a space shuttle going to fall down in GX </br>  <br>in after you mean</br>  EXTERMINAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE  <br>Subs never, fuck Commeme</br>  <br>Zoid9000 or w/e his name is is subbing it. So subs 3 days after release.</br>  <br>3 days would be pretty good by Symphogear standards.</br>  <br>For sure. We wont have many of these since we wont be waiting for a week for commie.</br>  So wait, are that H&amp;D group the same as the Zoid group?  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Oh, okay.<br>Well, good luck to them.</br></br>  <br>UNLIMITED BLADE WORKS</br>   mfw I've been putting this off on my backlog for years and finally started watching for season 3 <br><br>This show is a fucking trip. I just finished season 1 and the first episode of season 2.<br><br>Does anyone have any webms? Sakugabooru only has a handful.<br><br>sage for requestshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>God, I thought she was some kind of female Shirou during the whole series. That post and the previous ones really could be about him.<br><br>Shirou doesn't have Hibiki's bikkis and doesn't EAT; WATCH MOVIES AND SLEEP though so he is inferior.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Most I have are from s2 and have sound</br>  <br>Well I mean if you're worried about spoiling shit, I don't think it really matters. I'm definitely not watching this for the gripping, deep, and intricate plot.</br>  <br>I'll dump a few.<br><br>Also get the fuck out.<br>S2 is a wild fucking ride and you don't want to be spoiled.</br></br></br></br>  I want to wait until the episode airs to listen to it.<br>But I want to listen to it now.<br>How do I make the episode air right now?</br></br>  <br>You realize it might not play in the first episode right?</br>  <br>You mean they put more effort into more things than the animation for S2?</br>  <br>You don't understand. Some crazy shit happens.</br>  <br>You don't know how to enjoy a show, do you?</br>  <br>You'll enjoy it more going in blind. Trust us on this.</br>  <br>It will just after Phara introduction</br>  I want to fuck Kirika.  <br> inb4 instead of Exterminate, they played Radiant Force first </br>  <br>Some shows you watch for the engaging story. Some shows you watch because they're really fucking hype, even if the story is predictable. If something like Disappearance is a fine steak dinner, than so far I'm finding Symphogear to be a big fucking chocolate cake.<br><br>I'm sorry if I'm enjoying it for the wrong reasons, gatekeeper.</br></br></br>  <br>Shirabe pls. Your gay duet with her wasn't obvious enough?</br>    <br>Just watch it then come back to thread. You don't need to spend your time on 4chan while you can watch anime.</br>  <br>It'd be fitting, the very first line of Radiant Force "The beginning song" after all.</br>  <br> not shitposting while you watch anime <br><br>Why do you think people buy two monitors when they don't do any photo/video editing or programming?</br></br></br>    Has Maria ever had sex?  <br>I want to fuck Shirabe.</br>  these threads are as bad as klk ones  <br>playing the track on loop since last thread.<br>Wonder if I will hate it when the anime starts in 5 days.</br></br>  <br>Bipolar disorder.</br>  <br>Well okay then.</br>  <br>I don't think so. I doubt any of the geahs even know what sex is, aside from one obvious exception.</br>  How could I have forgotten all these nano desu  <br>I don't think you can hate it if you understand the lyrics.<br>I don't know why but the whole things made me hope for a HibiMiku end.</br></br>  <br>I don't want to get my dreams crushed by hoping for something like that.</br>  <br>Maria is an Idol in the Geahverse, so no.<br>She must remain pure or her fans riot.</br></br>  <br>Are you still pure when you become a terrorist? I know Nana fans would probably stand by her but is Maria that popular?</br>  <br>She's getting another concert so I don't think the symphoverse civilians care about it that much.</br>  <br>Judging by the crowd at the concert in the PV, yeah.</br>  <br>About her being a terrorist I mean. I'd be pleasantly surprised if they show the lasting repercussion of her terrorist life on her new life.</br>  <br>They said in an interview that the first two episodes would address why she's still able to be an idol.</br>  <br> Nana wills it </br>  <br>I can't wait to hear their excuse.</br>  <br>Me too. But if you replace all the "you/your" in the lyrics with "I/my" except for sentences that specifically use the word 君, it kinds of sound like Hibiki's singing about her feelings in the past and present.</br>  <br>That broadcast in the final episode probably helped.</br>  <br>Japanese idols need to be pure but Maria is a American idol which means she's definitely a slut.</br>  <br>I want to date background character-chan.</br>  Only 3 episodes into the first season and this show is already so good.<br>Does it have good doujins too?</br>  <br>She needs a sword inside her sheath.</br>  <br>She's probably dead.</br>  <br>Yes, about 40.</br>  <br>Not at all.</br>  <br>I guess I should get started on that too.</br>  <br>I'm thinking it'll be about her making a deal to work and make up for their crime on the condition that FIS are constantly monitored by Genjurou's team so they don't try anything funny. So Tsubasa sticks with Maria and Kirika/Shirabe have to go with Hibiki and Chris in their school. That's gotta be the best deal ever.<br><br> be a terrorist <br> get out of jail <br> "forced" to spend time with Hibiki, Chris and Tsubasa </br></br></br></br></br>  SOON  <br>Good  non-h  ones.</br>  watching season 2 before 3 comes out<br>god damn why are Chris's bazooka's so big if you know what I mean</br>    <br>Only about 4 of the H ones have good/decent art. Rest are shit art+shit fetishes.</br>  <br>They got massaged a lot when she was growing up.</br>  <br>I can totally see it, man... future Hibiki coming back to the present to stop Hibiki from ever wanting to become a hero.</br>  <br>But Hibiki refused to become a hero.</br>  <br>If Illya had summoned Hibiki as Baasaakaa rather than Heracles, how fucked would Gil be?</br>  <br> Hibiki about to make a decision that will most likely fuck everything up <br> suddenly a portal opens and Future Hibiki flings herself out of it and superman punches Present Hibiki while shouting "YOU'RE NOT LIVING YOUR LIFE CORRECTLY!" <br><br>I want this. It's not going to happen but I want it.</br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Maria and Tsubasa are old hags who don't deserve love.  <br> He doesn't want to love a sword <br><br>How can someone be so completely fucking faggatrocious?</br></br></br>  <br>Please no bullying the elderly.</br>  I finished watching both seasons a few days ago since it was in my backlog for the longest time and I regret not watching it earlier. Currently listening to all the songs nonstop.<br><br>I'm glad I'll be able to enjoy S3 with you guys since it'll be a wild ride.</br></br>  <br>The Nana has funny lines and not just "Mommu!" though.</br>  <br>Maria has funny lines in the ova</br>  <br> just "Mommu!" <br>But  she also says "Serena"! .</br></br>  <br>Guess I'm not coming to /a/ for awhile. Thanks anon.</br>  <br>See you this Saturday.</br>  <br>Sounds pretty shitty to be honest. Maybe it's just because of source. Calmly waiting for download.</br>  <br>Yeah but can Hibiki cook and do the high jump?<br>He's also made of swords, bonus points towards Tsubasa affection.</br></br>  <br><br>Sorry, but this song doesn't get my hyped.<br>It's nowhere near Synchrogazer or Vitalization.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe I've listened too much to her, but this time it sounds like she just sings something that always sounds the same without taking a breath. You know, apart from its melodic aspect, it sounds like she's talking very fast to herself. I find it kinda boring.</br>  <br>I got this. Which is the scene that got me to watch Symphogear.</br>  <br>Its okay, but still Synchrogazer is the best Shinfogia OP.<br>This is starting to become like Dog Days OP, it gets shittier every season.<br>I hope Re Birth day is good.</br></br></br>  <br> Dog Days <br><br>Please, no!<br>That would also mean that the show gets worse with every season, and I don't want S3 to be worse than S2.</br></br></br></br>  <br> he doesn't like the glorious sword <br>Look at this faggot.<br>Maria is the only character that doesn't deserve any love unless she does shit.</br></br></br>  <br> they open Elfnein's box <br> it reveals a secret song <br>  LA LA LA LA LA LA </br></br></br>  <br>I also pray that it doesn't become Dog Days 2.0.<br>I believe in Nana, but never in King Records.</br></br>  <br>NO<br>O<br><br>NO<br>O</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hell, if I will get "forced" to stick with Tsubasa and her friends just for being useless I'll even volunteer to kill people to be jailed and be "forced" to be with them.</br>  <br>I honestly prefer the second season OP if not solely for the way it builds up while the recap is playing.</br>  <br>Maybe Tsubasa blew holes on her already because her assets are as big as Kanade's.</br>  <br>Well, its both nice.<br>Exterminate is kind of, well, like Dog Days"`s No Limit, you know what I mean.<br>I just hope the Auf. form of Exterminate is good.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they're really trying to kill her now, if she flies and sings that in the fucking air I doubt she'll leave without any problems.</br>  <br>God, I hope it did.</br>  <br>They'll send her up so much that she'll just take off one day and show up 100 years later with her alien idol fans.</br>  <br> Nana gets launched into deep space then comes back with the custodians <br>Why does this seem so plausible?</br></br>  S1 Tsubasa was pretty fluffy.  <br> Nana flying around in her next live singing Exterminate <br> gets to the final "EXTERMINAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE" <br> concert hall erupts into flames <br><br>I don't know why I got this in my head but whatever.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shhh! That's the plot for the movie, Symphogear: Do you Remember the Awakening of the Trailblazer?</br>  Maybe because of something that happened recently.  <br>Meant for .</br>  <br>Who would want to remember that shitstain of a movie?<br><br> Actually, giant space flowers sounds surprisingly fitting in the context of Symphogear. </br></br></br>  <br>Exactly, hate on it for being the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull of Gundam all you like, but in the case of Symphogear, it wouldn't be out of place at all.</br>  <br> Tachibana (立花) Hibiki <br> 立花 == Standing Flower <br>   Hibiki will get transformed into a plant-based space elevator <br> yfw this was foreshadowed all along </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh boy, I remember that manga.</br></br>  Reminder that the pre-screening will happen tomorrow.    <br>Last action hero plz go</br>  <br>I doubt we'll get any spoilers.</br>    <br>Oh you will</br>  <br>I'm more interested in what the seiyuu will talk about.</br>  I'll never understand this.<br>Was the track team in Vietnam or something?</br>  <br>Miku is secretly an olympics gold winner.</br>    I want to cum inside Chris multiple times  <br>Her suddenly changed from track to music always seem strange to me, especially when she has the talent for the first.</br>  <br>She quit for Hibiki's sake. Survivors of the Zwei Wing concert were subject to extreme bullying; it was so bad for Hibiki's family that her father ran away forever.<br>Hibiki had literally only one person (aside from her mother) who cared about her in the 2-year period after the concert: Miku.</br></br>  <br>Her grandma supported her too, but yeah.<br>It's kinda fucked up since stuff like this happened in real life too.</br></br>  <br>Cute sword</br>  <br> Radiant Force is the beginning song <br> Exterminate is the ending song <br>Welp<br><br> Her father ran away forever <br>To be honest his life was kind of ruined as well.<br>If I remember right, he got harassed at work and fired from his job before descending into alcoholism and then just disappeared</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Is this mainly a japanese thing or does "survivor's guilt" happen in the west too?</br></br>  Watching s1 for the third time made me actually understand why Miku got so fucking mad, she's not to blame at all if you think about it.<br>For the whole serie Hibiki treated her pretty awfully.</br>  <br>I've seen it in western movies here and there<br>"I should have been the one to die that day!"<br>It's generally done with lovers or family members, though I can't think of an incident in burgerland that's had the kind of shit where survivors were harassed and treated like murderers.</br></br></br>  <br>Why does Tsubasa have 3 pairs of the same yellow-orange pantsu</br>  <br>Shit man, this isn't survivor's guilt. This is borderline psychopathic behavior. <br><br>Survivors of terrible events in the west are called heroes. Not harassed until they kill themselves.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder.</br>  <br>One of those package deal sales. Like buy 2, get one free.</br>  <br>Well, to be fair, 2/3rds of the deaths at Zwei Wing were from being trampled or crushed by other people, not being Dusted by Noise.</br>  <br><br>that can happen in real life too, like fires in nightclubs</br></br>  <br>Or Freedomland shopping holidays.</br>    <br><br>I want to have a thre-foursome with all the gungnirs.

Felling guilty about random people dying which you had no control over is one of the most retarded things anime does.</br>    <br>That's not syrup.</br>  Is this the kind of show where you're not chastised for not watching the first 2 seasons?<br> inb4 Secondaries get out </br>  <br>No. Fuck off.</br>  <br><br>not starting from the beginning isn't being a secondary, it's being an idiot</br></br>  <br>You have plenty of time, dork.</br>  <br>Why would you start with the 3rd season?</br>  <br>Go and watch the first 2 seasons. You still have some time before the first episode.</br>  <br>What's wrong with eggs? It's really unlikely to get salmonella from eggs in a modern country nowadays.</br>  <br>It's less chastising and more why the hell would you watch a sequel without knowing how we got to that point. It's not because there's GX in S3's title that it's standalone series like Yugioh.</br>  <br>This isn't a SoL anon, and the anime doesn't really try to explain what's going on during the first ep to people who didn't watch the past seasons.<br>You have time before the first ep airs so go for it.</br></br>  <br>There are only a handful of series where watching the prequel isn't necessary.  This isn't one of them. </br>  <br> It was a joke because Commie </br>  <br>The things with Hibiki's a bit more complicated, though. People needs someone/something to blame when shitty things happens to them or people they care about to "stay sane". Those who care about that dead soccer guy needed to direct their anger at something and Hibiki was conveniently there. Once she's become a bullied victim then no one really gives a shit about why it started or if she deserved it anymore. More and more opportunistic bulliers will jump in just because.</br>  <br>How do you even eat big waffles with chopsticks?<br>You stab them until you manage to reduce it into pieces?</br></br>  <br>No one uses the term secondary here did you crawl over from some shitty LN thread? Watching the 3rd season of a concurrent series is just completely retarded.</br>  <br>You pick up the waffle with the chopstick and bite off.<br>This isn't rocket science.</br></br>  <br>It's not complicated though it's just fucking stupid. I fully understand what happened to her but the Japanese take on survivors guilt is plain nonsensical.</br>  <br>Except Bikki didn't feel bad for surviving, if anything she implies she's glad for being alive and thankful to Kanade.<br>She felt bad because she received countless death treats for surviving by the families of the other victims, specially since in both seasons the enemy character has to remind her so (Chris and Shirabe saying she doesn't know shit about pain), hell, even Tsubasa treats her like garbage once she discovers she's the survivor of that incident.</br></br>    Just asking in advance, where would we go to livestream GX when it starts airing? Same place we went for Jojo?  <br>I'm not talking about Hibiki in season 1 but the people in her flashback in season 2. I don't have a problem with Hibiki my issue is with other people acting in such an insane way and that retarded loli calling her a hypocrite which makes no sense either.</br>  <br>Where did all the civilians evacuate to?</br>    <br> evacuate </br>  <br>She's indeed a hypocrite, though, not in the way Shirabe meant. She genuinely wants to help others but the thing is she tell them to not give up their live while she's ready to give up her own. I believe Tsubasa calls it "positive suicide impulse".</br>  <br>Shirabe calls her a hypocrite because she has no idea of Bikki's past so she thinks she's a cunt for telling everyone to hug each other when she didn't go through the shit Shirabe went during her childhood.</br>  Anyone has screencap of Chris where she was kidnapped as a child.  <br>But she will come back and if it kills her!</br>  <br>Pretty sure everyone was already evacuated due to the big carrier noise showing up around the tower the day before.</br>  <br>This one?<br><br> You dirty girl.  </br></br></br>  <br>But that translation is fucking wrong. Objectively. Stop posting stupid theories and making people think they're valid.<br><br/></br></br>    <br><br>Thanks you.</br></br>  <br>To be fair, it's things like this that made G's plot excruciating. Almost every single fan theory was better and more thought-out than what ended up happening.</br>    <br>Eh, aside Bikki getting a mechanical arm and Ver not being that crazy almost every theory was very similar to what we got.</br>  I want to marry Chris.  <br>And even then, Miku wasn't really angry at Hibiki but rather afraid because Hibiki felt the need to keep secrets from her.<br><br>And we already know that Hibiki felt like shit having to treat Miku like that.</br></br></br>  <br>I was just saying people here tend to treat that one episode like "Goddammit Miku" when she's actually understandable.</br>  <br>I still don't get why Shirabe was such a cunt</br>  アイアイとゆっくりの経済講座番外編４「シンフォギアの経済ネタ」 (00:06:27) #sm26537812 http://nico.ms/sm26537812<br>A Japanese made a speculation from economic perspective that he said maybe in Symphogear universe, Japanese government reduced the budget of health insurance so people were angry about that the survivors can get compensation from government while most people have to pay a lot of money to doctors.<br><br>And it's true that some survivors from Fukushima nuclear disaster got bullied or were teased by some people on the internet just because they got compensation from Japanese government.</br></br></br>  <br>Both of those were pretty fucking close, too.<br><br>Did anyone even die directly as a result of Fukushima?</br></br></br>  <br>I want to adopt Chris.</br>  <br> Enemies aren't noise anymore <br> Genjuro can go all out </br></br>  <br>Teenager with shitty life, aka the "geez mom you don't know shit about me stop trying to say you want to help me you fucking cunt" mentality.<br>Except she did went through some shit in the past.</br></br>  <br>She was just having a hard time, okay?<br><br><br>There were... those guys who stayed behind to try to fix the shit who are going to be dead in a decade?<br><br>Yeah.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>literally kill yourself</br>  <br>I don't think you can call it directly but at least 789 people died due to the disaster.</br>  <br>If it makes you feel any better, I'm downloading the BDs for both seasons.</br>  Maybe track team is a codeword for the army.  <br>this is how hell would probably look like.</br>  <br>it does.</br>  I can't be the only who wants a fucking turntable to control my computer. <br><br>FUCKING MICROSOFT DROP METRO AND DO THIS INSTEAD.</br></br>  <br>Shirabe was kidnapped when she was a child.

I'm so fucking slow</br>  <br>Remember S1 aired almost 4 years ago.</br>  <br>As far as I know Bunny Chris doesn't sell very well but mediocre because fanbase want gear version more.</br>  Yep, this will save the city.  <br>Time has no effect This Hype Train</br>  <br>After that fight Lydian and its surrounding area became a desert.</br>  <br>Fine died for Kirika's sins.</br>  <br>I want nendos of F.I.S.  mostly Dr. Ver but that isn't happening. </br>  <br>There are few things that I wouldn't do for a Kirika nendo.</br>  <br>Doesn't have as much impact as Vitalization but it still brings the hype.</br>  Why is Fine so moe?<br><br> I don't care if they so have to hamfist it in. I still want Fine back. </br></br>  is this weird if my dick react to singing nana mizuki ?  <br>Rule of cool</br>  <br>It would be weirder if it didn't.</br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/hwmsnnngiv.web<wbr>m<br><br>Reminder that Symphogear will never again have an asspull of this magnitude again.</br></br></wbr>  <br>That wasn't even that bad considering what singing does out there<br><br>The whole Fine, moon and sudden religious undertones deal being shoved down your throat in like 5 minutes was worse</br></br></br>  <br>I dunno. Hibiki regrowing her arm, having her fatal cancer cured by a death laser, catching Gungnir with her bare hand and stealing Maria's relic by singing. Ver using a giant magic hand to physically pull the moon toward earth. Miku throwing the cane like a mile into the sky. Some real ridiculous shit happened in G.</br>  <br>What are you talking about, the hype at that moment made the asspull amazing, I was sure that at least Chris was dead at that point.</br>  <br>Why is Aoi so good?</br>  <br>That scene was hilariously over the top and perfect. The music buildup, the screaming, the silly yet crazy armour designs</br>  <br>All that stuff in the first sentence was not that crazy considering the information we already had and many anons called them. Not one knew about Xdrives in S1 and we thought two characters had died.</br>  <br>What are you talking about? Not only was that part the best one in the series so far, but given the whole 'insane number of locks' thing, you can pretty easily chalk the asspull down to a different use of the S2CA or a similar technique.<br><br>If anything, Tsubasa and Chris not being dead at that point would be bad writing.</br></br></br>  <br>I believe they can do it again. I have faith in Satelight.</br>  <br><br>If you spend a minute past "How I shoot angst" Bikki and "Anger is the only stage of grief" Tsubasa, Miku is getting a pretty raw deal and dealing very well with it.<br><br>Bikki has been screwing up for months; Miku's got the patience of a saint if it took her that long to crack.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah come on, did you really guys thought they were dead instead of going for the most used cliché ever? Don't get me wrong, that part is one of my most favourite moments but the stuff that anon listed are more ridiculous asspull-wise.</br>  <br>If anything, them being dead and revived would be an even bigger cliché</br>  <br>It was an anime original and plenty of people including a gear user died that season so yes.</br>  <br>I still find it weird that the existence of god is proven in the symphogear universe, yet noone cares</br>  <br>No cute girl but the protagonist can die at that point in this kind of anime.</br>  <br>The city had noise proof bunkers installed everywhere.</br>  <br>Forgot to mention Tsubasa is voiced by Nana, she can't die unless you want a revolution.</br>  <br>That kind of reasoning is weak beyond belief</br>  <br>Gotta save it somehow.</br>  <br> Noise proof <br>I thought that's impossible.</br></br>  <br><br>The noise aren't particularly bright when they aren't being directly commanded.<br><br>The bunkers are probably standard, enough strength to block collateral damage, deep enough to prevent incidental discovery, It's not like the noise make a habit of digging for prey.</br></br></br></br>  How much do I need to pay the studio to make Zombie Kanade a reality?  <br><br>Why pay, they're banking that shit.<br><br>It'll come out when they run low on suffering.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I couldn't resist.</br>  <br>What did Tsubasa do?</br>  <br>Held her determination to fist too strongly.</br>   tfw Nana is getting old now <br>How long until she starts funding anti-aging genetics research and makes herself 20 again?</br>  <br>God is voiced by TMR and is the head custodian.</br>  <br>I'm very okay with this</br>  <br><br>Kanade must be rolling in her grave seeing her girlfriend mingling with low lives like Chris and singing duets with that talentless hack Maria</br></br>  <br> I liked Maria's voice and Fushichou no Flamme a lot more than Kanade's and Gyakkou no Flugel </br>  <br>Shit taste</br>  <br><br>Kanade would wreck Maria at singing, fighting and fucking.</br></br>  You guys convinced me to go and finish s1. Even though I knew everyone was alive in s2 I thought everyone had died like 5 times in the last 3 episodes. Now time to move on to s2 for more hype<br><br>  Also, Chris a best  </br></br>  <br> singing <br>Down to personal preference by virtue of the voices<br><br> fighting <br>Kanade's objectively the weakest geah to date when she's not ODing on LiNKER<br><br> fucking <br>Tell that to Ver</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maria is much better at living.</br>  <br>Wrong, Maria survives but Kanade lived.<br><br>Big difference.</br></br></br>  <br>Kanade's compatiblity is higher than FIS when FIS girls don't use Ver's LiNKER.</br>  Speakong of compatiblity, Japanese fan's speculation is Carol can deprive gear user's compatiblity as Hibiki can deprive it from nowhere.  <br><br> ODing. <br><br>I've got some bad news for you, she was jonesing hard for LiNKER during the concert.<br><br>Something about worrying about LiNKER disrupting the phonic gain, but she was cold turkey that night.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Rewatching S1.<br>It feels really weird to see Nehustan Chris again.</br>  <br>I'm talking about the events before the concert, when she was genuinely only good because the normal LiNKER had extremely strong effects on her and she could handle puking a little bit of blood now and then due to how legitimately strong both her determination and her body were.<br><br>As for the concert, I thought Kanade not taking her LiNKER was Fine's plan.</br></br></br>  <br> I thought Kanade not taking her LiNKER was Fine's plan <br>Sort of. LiNKER user will create garbage in their song. This is one of reasons FIS couldn't activate Nephilim while they fought Hibiki and co..</br></br>  <br>Good point.</br>  <br>First love song is still the best song</br>   tfw staff confirmed GX's action scenes are more heavy than previous seasons.    strong, determined  <br> but caring and supportive when Tsubasa needs comfort <br><br>Kanade was best husbando<br><br>Why did she have to die?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Am I the only one who is okay with Kanade dying because her death had so much meaning?</br>  <br>Too good for this sinful world.<br><br>Also this </br></br></br>  <br>You are not alone.</br>  <br> inb4 even more QUALITY now. <br>I hope they started the production early enough to not suddenly run out of time.</br></br>  <br>The ep. 6/7 Nehustan/Ichaival battle is probably my favorite part of the whole series.</br>  <br>I'm okay with Kanade dying because  I don't like her. </br>  <br> Satelight <br> has enough time and staff <br>Never. Especially when Aquarion s3 comes out in the same season again.</br></br></br>  <br>i completely forgot about that, holy shit<br>as long as Tsubasa's animated I'm fine though</br></br>  <br>The ichaival scene is what sold me on the series and it's concept.<br><br><br>No, then again i like her enough that her return would make me happy aswell.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn she looked much better in S1</br>  <br>Fine please go.</br>  <br><br>Those were better times, when the dere was hidden deeply under many layers of hatred and  HA HA SAA-AA IT'S SHOWTIME </br></br>  <br> updated ending for EVOL <br> the OVA <br> 27 episodes of Logos </br></br></br>  <br> Macross Delta in fall or next winter </br>  Here's what I irrationally want to see this season:<br><br>- Six-part counterpoint battle.<br>- Two-sided six-part counterpoint battle (all 6 main gears vs. Carol + Elfnein + the puppets). (Astronomically unlikely but I will cry forever if this happens.<br><br>- Since the final mega-attack of S1 and S2 is named after the opening, it makes sense that the final attack of GX will be titled Exterminate. Incredibly stupid left-field prediction: somehow Hibiki will tap into the energy hand thing from the Frontier and hold the hand of everyone in the world to power the final attack. Exterminate loneliness.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>27? That's a number I've never seen before</br></br>  <br> hold the hand of everyone in the world <br> turning Hibiki into a super turboslut in the final episode <br><br>Why would you want that anon?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I would like to see Berbiki becomes the final boss.</br>  <br>I don't want my Hibiki to hold hands with dirty pakis.</br>  <br><br>/pol/-chan pls go</br></br>  <br>Not even. They're just gross.<br>Indians too. Their hands are literally covered in shit.<br>Hibiki doesn't deserve that.</br></br></br>  I want to see Hibiki showing she doesn't need her geah to kick ass.  <br>She softened a bit too much for my tastes<br><br> Also her bonkers got too huge </br></br></br>  <br>Tsun~ Tsun~</br>  <br><br>Symphogear threads are always half anime half nana/aoi wank.</br></br>  Does anyone have the 4koma of the episodes?  <br><br>Needs more Ayahi/Yoshino wank</br></br>  <br>Why is Aoi so perfect?</br>  I wish I could have been there for S1.

They got comically huge in G<br>Like something out of Senran Kagura</br></br>  I thought I was watching a Nana live.<br>So why are there so many tap dancing men on stage while they play folk music.</br>  <br>Because  NANA WILLS IT , obviously.</br>  <br><br>Because even Nana needs breaks, or time to change costumes. Though I prefer that intermission with Jupiter. <br><br>Still my favorite Nana concert.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That looks fucking great.</br>      <br><br>True, I know Aoi a kawaii princess-hime and everything but she's probably the  least talented singer of the group </br></br>  <br>I agree.<br><br>But you can hear her screaming her fucking heart out every goddamn time she's voicing Hibiki, and that's why I love her.</br></br></br>  <br>She sounded like she was going to suffocate in the live after Rainbow Flower.

Cell was pretty much the last prominent one.<br><br>Saiyans age slower, and kaoiken is worthless and has been for a long time<br><br>Not retconned they just changed some things, but they will link up at some point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  /a/ being autistic as fuck about Dragon Ball again. Figures.   mfw 3 posters <br> mfw im one of them <br> mfw op doesnt deserve to see mfw <br><br>mfw dumbass bumps shit thread back up to the front page, increasing the poster count<br>SAGE</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> arn't they in their 50's? <br>Goku dies all the time, so he's in his early 30's.<br>Vegeta is in his mid 40's, but Sayians stay young for a very long time.</br></br></br>  <br> if friezas in his normal body in hell during the ending of the kid buu saga, why is he a cyborg in the movies, is the kid buu saga not cannon? inb4 manga <br><br>Because his soul isn't cyber</br></br></br>  <br>The first 5 posts were OP.</br>  <br><br>Is it explained why Frieza can be revived in Fukkatsu no F? Or is it just ignored.</br></br>  I haven't paid attention to any details because fuck it, but is Toriyama heavily involved with Super?<br><br>If not, it's gonna be trash. If so, there's some hope.</br></br>  <br> zenkai <br>They stopped being very big after ssj. Ue actually ecplained it.<br> saiyans <br>Groups of people more than a year dead can't be revived. I guess you didn't read or watch Dragon Ball well enough to get that. Why do people act like Toriyama is stuoid because he has a retroactive community which doesn't follow their stuoud headcanons?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him but Toriyama fogets about a lot of thing he did, like Lunch.</br>  Basically they wanted Toriyama to give them new toys to sell, so he made a bunch of recolours as a tongue in cheek gag.  <br>It wasn't really explained but when he's revived his body is still in pieces like Trunks killed him.</br>  <br>He's revived into the chunks he was cut up into, which is apparently good enough as space medicine has advanced far enough in the passning years that they can completely regenerate his organic body instead of having to cybernetically reconstruct him.</br>  <br> Plot-hole-Z, toriyama forgot some story and character details, so he came up with some inconsistent bullshit <br>You don't understand the point to a series like Dragonball. Pic somewhat related.</br></br>  <br>also if they could regenerate body parts in the healing tank, what was the point of making him a cyborg? even if it saved his life they could have tossed him in a tank after.<br><br>the regenerating tecnology was invented when he was dead</br></br></br>  <br>If /a/ was being autistic about it then they would bother to get the details correct. What /a/ is being is retarded.</br>  <br> if not, it's gonna be trash <br><br>Toriyama is the reason it's trash. Get a nice Marvel/DC writer to write DBZ properly.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't think I'd live to see the day where blueper saiyans are a thing even GT's SSJ 4 was much more credible.</br>  <br>Toei filler</br>  <br><br>Hah. Good fucking luck. They'll never get rid of Goku. Ressurection F proves they haven't learned a thing and have time travel BS so Goku can sucker punch Frieza just so Vegeta doesn't beat him instead because nobody can look better than Goku.<br><br>It'll be just like fucking GT all over again.</br></br></br></br>  lol you guys are fucking angry  <br> Marvel/DC <br>Aren't comic books incredibly cheesy and poorly written, even compared to manga?</br></br>  <br>They need a Marvel/DC writer not for the plot, DBZ has no plot. They need him to make some creative fights that aren't this lackluster early DB-era shit. Two Gods are fighting each other and it looks the same as Goku vs Frieza the first time around.</br>  <br> lackluster early DB-era shit <br><br>The fights from the original Dragon Ball were by far the most entertraining.</br></br></br>  <br>vegetafag detected kek</br>  <br>I meant in terms of the scale of destruction. How the fights can be so tame at this point is ridiculous. Every random ki blast they fire should be blowing up the planet. Shit, Beerus did exactly that with a tiny no-name blast in the chapter prior to the movie.</br>  Does it exist?  <br>yes, but without love it cannot be seen<br><br>;_;</br></br></br>  <br>In the same way that witches exist.</br>  Takeuchi's latest teaser.  When you actually post an image that isn't blank we'll see.  <br>Is this some kind of philosophical question OP? If your referring to your thread existing then that sure is true but for some reason there's no image attached to your post.</br>  is she supposed to be a 10 years old?  <br>It doesn't service me right, and I'm fan!</br>  <br>It services me enough for both of us.</br>  <br><br>None were her size in the kids department</br></br>  <br>Source</br>  <br>boku non pico</br>  Do you like healthy girls, /a/?  <br> chubby <br><br>It's fat you fucker.
