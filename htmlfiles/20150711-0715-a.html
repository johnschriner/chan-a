This a million times.      Without question.  <br>You just have a severe case of shit taste.</br>  <br>Worst op in respective universe.</br>  <br>While there is a very strong case for her, let me present someone worse.</br>  <br>She's down there. I don't know if I'd put her below cat, but they're both certainly the bottom two.</br>  <br>Thats not Sae</br>  <br>Yomi wasn't bad, someone had to be the tsukkomi in azumanga. I appreciate Yomi for doing her job</br>  <br>Who is this  cuck lord ?</br>  <br> using Kaoru as bait </br>    <br>I don't follow this series at all, I don't even remember it's name at the moment, but I know that sex hair girl definitely can't be the worst in it because I masturbated to her (out of the series) the most.<br><br>Just came here to say that.</br></br></br>      <br>You're ok anon, you're ok.</br>  <br>thanks for speaking the truth, OP<br><br>Too many people on /a/ love her for no fucking reason when she's objectively the worst girl, she's the only one who makes MC's life worse rather than better<br><br>Picture is two (superior) but still not best amagamis</br></br></br></br></br>      <br><br>OP's a funny guy.</br></br>   OP is a faggot yet again <br>What a surprise.<br><br>Posting worst Hibike.</br></br></br>      <br>How did she made MC's life worse? The epilogues and specials with her are great.</br>  <br>she ruined his fucking vacation and she's a dumb poor slut with no real skills, unlike literally everyone else. Even the Yandere side-bitch.</br>  <br>Every tsundere, ever.</br>  <br>you fucking scum of the earth shit. She was the best part of that show</br>  <br>But that's not  Reina. </br>  <br>But those are the best girls.</br>  <br>I see a theme here: Sluts.</br>  <br>KyoAni does it better than the rest</br>    <br>I came here to say this same thing.</br>      <br/>  <br>Nigga I'll fight you</br>  <br>Yeah, no way she's worst.<br><br> Just, catastrophically out-classed. </br></br></br>    Shimikaze is fucking useless. She serves no purpose.    <br>your waifu</br>  <br>My penis disagrees.</br>  <br>pls</br>  <br>Here's the awful one for an awful series.</br>  Obvious  <br>I'd say the first chick was the worst one, can't remember her name. She said wow a lot.</br>  <br>Nigga you wanna die?</br>  <br>Ok, that's the best one I've seen yet.</br>  <br><br>no</br></br>  <br>Yes, boring and pointless to the series</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>I like Sawashiro but it amazes me that her fans seriously repost this picture that looks like it was made by reverse troll.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>all wrong</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best girls</br>   You can preemptively eat my dick.   <br> Trigger1235 <br> in charge of math <br> in charge of taste </br></br></br>  <br>Obvious best girl</br>    <br><br>I'd run my fingers through the knots in her hair.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Horrible taste, kill yourselves</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are a piece of shitty taste shit.</br>  <br>Too each their own anon</br>  <br> Kallen is worst girl <br> Not Shirley  <br><br>What the fuck is wrong with you anon.?</br></br></br></br>  <br>maximumbait.png</br>          Absolutely terrible  <br><br>Monkey is worse than those two for sure.</br></br>    <br>Here is your reply.</br>  <br> You're </br>      <br>slut</br>    <br>Where is the lie though?</br>  <br>They are both shit</br>  Now that Yamada can't switch bodies with her, she will forever remain shit.  <br>Yes. Yes. Yes. <br><br>At first I was alright with her, but they really made her annoying as fuck. <br><br>I get the ditzy girl type character but overdoing goes from being "cute" to just being annoying as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If I ever switched bodies with her, she'd never get it back.</br>  This bitch. Even with Eri being a totally spoiled bitch, she grew on you and Yakumo was the superior sibling. <br><br>Tenma was just stupid. No redeeming qualities at all. <br><br>Still pissed at them ruining the ending of that series.</br></br></br></br>  Every blonde to ever live.    <br>Can you imagine how weird it would be to have sex with her and switch bodies in between every time you lock lips?</br>    <br>Agreed, even the random side characters were better. The interaction between her and the rest of the cast was still hilarious though.</br>  <br> long black hair, blue eyes </br>  <br>Or how awesome</br>    <br>The only good one is the bitch from chu2, everyone else is sorta meh.</br>  this cunt    <br>Yeah, she was great as far as comic relief was concerned and she was arguably the most important set piece in everyone else's story but her story (the co-main) never progressed from the starting point.</br>    <br> Ilya  <br><br>Its like you're a faggot or something.</br></br></br>      Maki a big<br>giant<br>smelly<br>shit</br></br></br>  I don't know why everyone has such a hard on for her  <br>She's nice, cute and girly</br>  <br> sluts <br>not<br> suffering <br><br>You don't like suffering girls you little faggot?<br><br>Every single one of this unfortunate vixens is a best</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  There's no need to bait if you want a Sexhair thread    <br>Fuck you you fucking whore. Don't you dare say Yukiko isn't perfect. Go back to sucking dick you faggot sucking faggot.</br>  Fuck this bitch. Why does she hate fun so much?  <br> posting a truck </br>  <br>The worst opinion I have ever seen</br>         Exia     What a bitch.  <br><br>Nekofags begone</br></br>    <br>say that to my face and not on the internet and see what happens.</br>      <br>Take that back you bitch.</br>  <br> watashi <br>I'll gut you and and use your head as a football.</br></br>  <br>You spelled "best" wrong.</br>  <br><br>You first, OP</br></br>  I hate her so much. Yes she is the only one who makes the show worth watching, but only because I want to see her lose and cry.    <br>I'll fucking sue you for that. <br>Rin is easily worstgirl by a mile.</br></br>    Worst girl she's just disgusting tier<br> Kirisaki &gt;&gt;&gt; Kosaki </br>    <br><br>You both have shit taste.</br></br>  <br>His cousin was the better girl.</br>    <br>Silly anon, OP said worst, not best.<br>Good taste though.</br></br>  <br>only because  he 's the only  "girl"  in the series</br>     bait thread still alive <br><br>this board is fucking dead</br></br>  Backstabbing whore.  <br>That's Sekai's legally married wife you're talking shit about.</br>    I don't think a more perfect blonde exists in all of anime. If one does, I'd sure like to see it.  Sena is shit tbh  Miki is a better blonde.    Miyako is the sunshine in Sunshine Sketch.  <br>Fake blonde.</br>  Does Texan anime count?  <br>Not in the anime.</br>  <br>肉<br>What ending　do you want as for Haganai Anime SⅢ?</br></br>  <br>What would happen if I take her butterfly off?</br>  <br>Garbage character from a garbage show.</br>    <br>She would lose all of her tsun and become deredere.</br>  Pic related is about a thousand times superior.  <br>Too bad nigger, Yukimura already won the novels.</br>  <br> I know it. But I hoped that Sigma Rika had won.</br>    Is this blonde enough for you ?      Is that right OP ?  <br>It would be extremely painful.</br>  <br>Fuck yes.</br>  <br>How about you go ask your banal question of /c/ or /h/ instead</br>  <br>Lets be of friends brother</br>    Haganai has the most horrid blondes I've seen in anime and manga. Except Stella, she's fine.  Is this considered a blonde?  <br>Yui is love</br>  <br><br>I want to do horribly lewd things to Stella.</br></br>    Ka~Ka~    <br><br>how did this shit now really end? was there a decent epilogue?<br>everyone was like "OMG YUKIMURA WON" and then it was just kinda dead on /a/</br></br></br>  <br><br>These niggas get it. Batfag reporting in.</br></br>  <br>Here you go.</br>    <br> You'll never be Marseille and fuck yourself through the team </br>  <br>That was a misunderstanding on /a/s part. It's been a while since I looked at it, so I don't know if anyone has actually won yet.</br>  <br>blonde milfs are always the best</br>  Nancy Lee. Based Trigger done it again.    <br>Fuck off EOP. The last page of the novel had the MC and Yukimura passionately kissing before MC accepts her confession.<br><br>It's over, Sena BTFO.</br></br></br>    <br>Sena get Yozora anyway</br>  <br>Correct answer, you can all kill yourselves now.</br>  <br>Mah nigger</br>  <br>You dont even need to be gay to acknowledge Gil as the one true blonde</br>  <br>Too much hips</br>  <br>My fellow brother of African descent!</br>  <br>She wasnt even best girl in her own show, let alone best blonde</br>  <br>What's gay about thinking Gil is the best?</br>      Surely she offers a good fight...    <br><br>meat is neat</br></br>    <br>Right here anon-kun</br>  blond girls will never win , like you guys ! a losers    <br>Blondes shouldn't be compared and fight each other. Blonde are a miracle of the universe, they should be admired by all. People need to come together and agree to admire the beauty of all blondes without fighting and comparing one to another. Blondes are life, blondes are love.</br>    Why are rich blonde girls always best?  My waifu &gt; you're waifu  <br>Best blonde</br>  <br>my nigger, I love seein ranpha raping my waifu.</br>  <br> Today I'm being a huge gigantic mammoth gargantuan fucking bitch!  <br><br>No wonder MC didn't get with her. Unlikeable whore.</br></br></br>  Are blondes superior to black haired girls in terms of sexual attraction?    <br>I find brunettes and dark haired girls to be more attractive.</br>  <br>the novel is not finished! we'll have a niku ending</br>  Where my Cecilia bros at    OP is either trolling or...well is just blind.  Why do people keep sayim Yukimura has won? The novel isn't fully translated yet right? It's still stuck at them riding home in Pegasus' car    <br>Dark hair is best with light skin, and light hair is best with dark skin.</br>   Unlimited Opinion Posts: The Thread         <br>Trash.</br>  <br>How can an anime so horrible do such good things for my dick?</br>     not a single Nero in this thread <br><br>Plebians, all of you.</br></br>  <br>that's a redhead</br>       censoring <br><br>Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo<wbr>oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo</wbr></br></br>  <br>I don't see anything censored here.

They don't even get uncensored for the BDs anymore; see Crossange for example.</br></br>  This and TLR:D were my hopes for this season. Am I gonna have to wait for BDs for both?<br><br>Please save us based ATX</br></br>  <br>How new are you that you've never read a non-h manga with nipples?</br>  <br>Up to some guy betraying the group with flexslut OP posted, manga only was that far and I'm too lazy to continue reading it<br><br>Post some example</br></br></br>  <br>No. Read it yourself or fuck off.</br>  <br>Triage x bd when?<br>It supposed it came out last month</br></br>  BD it is, then  <br>There's literally no point in watching this then.</br>  <br><br>That's some worst case scenario censorship.<br><br>Good thing I didn't expect anything good from the adaption.</br></br></br></br>  PUREASU ROOK FOWARD TO OUR BURUUURAAAYZU  I don't understand. They kept some parts uncensored.  God fucking damn it.<br><br>God damn it.<br><br>I was so excited for this show. BD when?</br></br></br></br>  <br>But then censored stuff like this.</br>  <br>I do rook forward to pirating your BDs, yes. See you guys then.</br>  <br>Chiyo is too pure to be censored.</br>  <br><br>This is bizarre. I guess as long as the show is good besides this, we have the BDs to wait for.</br></br>  <br>Some nice faces in there.<br><br><br>Are you trying to ruse me?</br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck, they could have drawn the ass a little less lewdly for TV and aired it uncensored.<br>There's no point in even watching this anymore.</br></br>  <br>Are you fucking retarded and didn't expect this? Is this your first ecchi anime?</br>  <br>Unfortunately this is no ruse.</br>  <br><br>You know, there's more to this show than just T&amp;A. Plus the white beam censorship was known weeks ago (Mizushima tweeted about it).<br>So don't be a baby and drop the show. Just rewatch it when it hits BD</br></br></br>  Stream link?  well there's one less thing I have to watch this season  I've just watched. still excellent.  <br>Well why the fuck does High School DXD fly under the radar and come out uncensored and shit like prison school not?<br><br><br>No. See  and <br>This is asinine. Even if there was a reason to watch it, I don't want to watch something where half of the screen is obscured by a dumb fucking white line 50% of the time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>THANK YOU JC STAFF YOU TALENTLESS FUCKFACES</br></br></br>  So /a/what will you choose?<br><br> tv rips that have censors <br> horriblesubs rip that will be uncensored but moves at 12fps </br></br></br>  <br>Are you really blaming a studio for censorship?</br>  Because this show isn't all about tits and vaginas, amirite?<br>God, I'm gonna laugh like crazy when the BDs turn out to be censored as well, the tears will be delicious</br>  <br>Censoring is fine if done tastefully - through angles, various foreground objects, some lock of hair or something. Just doing an explicit shot and blocking all the stuff with beam of light is absolutely retarded and basically means "buy BD"</br>  <br><br><br><br>Do Nips actually watch this shit? It's unwatchable in this state. How does it even get ratings?</br></br></br></br>  <br>DxD airs on multiple channels, one of which allows uncensored. As far as I know this doesn't, and won't.</br>  <br> They don't even get uncensored for the BDs anymore </br>  <br> You know, there's more to this show than just T&amp;A. <br><br>Would say the impressive art of the manga and the T&amp;A are two very important things of prison school and now you are missing both. So don't be a retard.</br></br></br>  Great first episode  <br>Well, I'd rather get the explicit version eventually rather than never.</br>  guys they would show nudity on television if it were not _fucking against the law_ to show nudity on television. <br><br>it's not a le evil conspiracy to trick you.</br></br>  <br>Yes, unless there's dick or pussy on screen there's no reason for it to be censored.</br>  <br>Are you fucking retarded, have you never seen an uncensored ecchi anime air?<br><br>Maybe you need to lurk more, anon.</br></br></br>  it's just censored on Tokyo MX faggot<br><br>Just wait ATX: http://prison-anime.com/on_air/inde<wbr>x.html</wbr></br></br>  <br>Yes so is this your first ecchi anime?</br>  Fast pacing and ok-tier art and animation, but the direction and atmosphere are great.  <br>That shit isn't common though you retard.</br>  <br>You're a class A retard, anon.</br>  <br>It's censored on ATX as well?</br>  <br><br><br>ATX is censored.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I don't get why a TV station would be okay airing this, it's like "this anime has no worth until the uncensored BDs come out, let's see how much advertisers will pay for the drooling imbeciles who would still watch it on a weekly basis"</br></br></br>  <br>How can someone be this retarded?</br>   BU THE BDs   <br>What is mosaic? You're the retard friend.</br>  <br>ATX is censored but not in the web</br>  <br>Why is there no doujin of her in cowgirl position jiggling her sweaty tits already?!</br>  Guess I won't be watching this until the BDs gets ripped.  <br> how much advertisers will pay for the drooling imbeciles <br>But Anon: The Studio has to buy Airtime. Airtime is not free.</br></br>  its 2015 and we as civilization still haven't evolved past dark ages mindset and think that seeing pussy or dick helps the satan to eat your soul.  The only reason you should be watching the anime is for the ass or titts scene. Aren't you niggas not satisfied with the manga?  CR will be uncensored,  right ?  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br>Blame America.</br>  <br>do you even read?</br>  <br>How do you know that</br>  <br>Hopefully there will be some next month.</br>  <br>for some reason, I am reminded of Michelangelo's Creation of Adam</br>  <br>Women should be covered.</br>  I'm getting pupa flashbacks.  <br> There is no uncensored.  </br>  <br>Absolutely haram.</br>  <br>Did you expect any better from backwards as fuck Japan and America? No better than Middle East.</br>  <br>in the civilized part of the world (europe) no one cares about nipple and stuff</br>  What the hell is the point of watching this shit? Even the swimsuit got white lighted smh  <br><br>Something something about slavs something something about yuropoor something something about muslim immigration and hamburgers.</br></br>  <br>Skydaddy will be mad if you see genitals</br>  <br>Mizushima already confirmed on his twitter BDs are gonna be uncensored.</br>  <br><br>Are those implants?</br></br>  <br>Is that a dude?</br>  FEMDOM<br>E<br>M<br>D<br>O<br>M</br></br></br></br></br>  this kind of series was meant to be read imo .. not to be watched censored and "hope" for an uncensored BD   tfw girls here started to go topless just like guys go without shirt in summer <br><br> too bad they aren't 2D </br></br>  <br>No, it's a cartoon.</br>  <br>Do you live in France?</br>  <br>Even ATX monster musume was censored m8, it's over.</br>  <br>Some people read it for other shit that isnt purely the ecchi.</br>  <br>yes</br>  Meh, will still watch it, already read the manga and the fanservice was boner inducing because of the godtier artwork. Not missing much given animated fanservice isnt as detailed as the manga in most cases. I just want to see some of the scenes actually voiced  <br>That's why we have legal designated nudist beaches. There is a fair bit of censoring assuming something is going to be on tv before 9pm in uk, I think it's earlier on the continent. Probably isn't even one in Spain with their age of consent at 13.</br>  Pretty good episode.<br><br>Thinking on reading the manga when the anime ends.</br></br>  SUBS FUCKING WHEN  /a/ complaining about their free cartoons like always  <br><br><br>k.</br></br></br>  <br>Its 16 since 2013, still no one gives a fuck about that and is not going to stop girls go full slut mode</br>  <br>People are too intimidated by the original art!<br><br>Also lewd stuff rarely gets doujins for some reason.</br></br></br>  Thanks Japan  <br>Anon, just be strong and mature and proclaim that only kids care about sex anyways.</br>  <br>The general rule is adult content is after 9pm yes<br><br>You're allowed nudity up to erect cocks/spread vagina<br>Flacid dick is okay though</br></br></br></br>  <br> Absolutely haram. <br>Fuck off. Its not my fault that they got themselves a ideological Dictator in times past.</br></br>  <br>That fear of something I like becoming popular.</br>  [HorribleSubs] Prison School - 01 [1080p].mkv  Fucking jedi blocking my anime vagoos  FUCK THAT PACING !!!!!!   92.1%   I never expected much from JC Staff and they still managed to disappoint me.  <br>I expect this shit to increase as we get closer to the 2020 olympics.<br>Can't scare off all that dericuous normie gajin tourism money with their shamfur firufee cartoons.</br></br>  <br>You mean exactly like the mangas pacing?</br>  What the fuck are these texturing effects? What the fuck is this Sidonia 3D shit?<br><br>It's like everything that could have gone wrong with this adaptation went wrong.</br></br>  <br>Try colour settings to PC, as you should with any Funimation rip.</br>  <br>Words to live by, honestly.</br>  I was sort of excited. Sort of. I mean fuck, some of the shots in fucking Dungeon were lewder than this. <br><br>This censoring is garbage and someone is out to get prison school.</br></br>  <br>that looks weird.<br>but they made some good use out of it like this<br/></br></br>  I can deal with the bad textures but the censoring is awful.<br><br>Does anyone know if the web release is censored as well?</br></br>  <br>Luckily Monmusu only had 1 censored scene, but this is a completely different level of butchering.<br><br>dropped till BD</br></br></br>    Worst show of the season.  <br>Nice blog.</br>  <br>Not even close.</br>  <br>Is that the one with the naked dude holding his hand out towards god in the sky?</br>  <br>everything that's not BDs is censored.</br>  <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=torrentinf<wbr>o&amp;tid=710192<br>Now it would seem.</br></wbr></br>  <br>Because it's JC staff fault for censorship right?</br>   there won't be the scene of Mari having sex with Kate <br><br>Literally what is the point of watching</br></br>  looks like i will wait for the BDs   Caring about censors so vehemently  <br><br>Jesus fucking christ you're on the internet, go watch porn or wait for bds and get over it.</br></br>  <br>The first half of prison school is infinitely better than the second except a few scenes like that one and hand holding intensifies.</br>  <br>Censorship is just one of the many problems.</br>  <br>Theres no fucking reason to watch this shit with cencorship you fuck</br>  <br><br> he totally misses the point </br></br>    <br>I follow this series for the comedy and detest the ecchi. What now faggot?</br>  <br>Don't lie you're truly just pissed about the censorship right?</br>  <br>HS should now be automatically fixing the color.</br>  <br>okay i laughed</br>  <br>Since when?</br>  <br>Since this season.</br>  <br> and detest the ecchi <br>I mean if thats your thing then okay. But you're still reading prison school? FUCKING REALLY?</br></br>  <br>Oh, I see, FUNI rips auto detects to PC instead of TV.</br>  <br>99% of the comedy is or is related to the ecchi though...</br>   JC Staff <br><br>Auto-dropped.</br></br>  <br> detest the ecchi <br> call others faggot <br>Huh.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  I don't know why people are surprised that it's censored.  Is there even a point for watching this show if i don't have a masochism fetish?  <br><br>Ill be more specific. I don't like  meiko ecchi . Too fucking much of it all over the first half.</br></br>  <br>I'm not surprised, but that doesn't mean I'm happy about it either</br>  <br>You could watch it in order to acquire a masochism fetish!</br>  Wait some people are saying the adaptation is faithful but rushed. Is that even possible?  <br>I don't know why you haven't killed yourself yet</br>  <br><br>People expected censoring. They didn't really expect it to be this retardedly aggressive when other shows are getting away with worse.</br></br>  Expecting full censor during Meiko's parts in the jail.<br>I suggest you go read the manga, for one the characters are drawn 10x better and there is no censor.</br>  <br>underrated post</br>  <br>this.</br>  <br>Its the idiots that don't go back and reread it. The anime followed the panels exactly as they were.</br>  <br>see Yamada-kun</br>  <br>Is the manga animated and has voice actors?</br>  <br>Not the same guy, but it's not really the same.<br><br>I didn't read the manga, and just watched this episode. I really enjoyed the first half when it was basically just dumb jokes about guys being stupid and pervy, but then the second half was basically just a pair of giant tits beating up a bunch of S&amp;M fetishists</br></br></br>  <br> why can't anime be more civilized and let me have my cartoon fap material sans censoring? </br>  <br>nobody gives a shit if its animated when half the screen is white <br><br>just wait till BDs</br></br></br>  <br>Plenty of shows still have nipples and panty shots.</br>  <br>It's because retards don't realize that the manga is mostly page spreads and reaction shots.<br>They just see that it's 5-6 chapters in 1 episode and yell "rushed"</br></br>  <br>Prison School is better than porn.<br>Censorship is always a bad thing, fuck off with your backward mentality, please.<br><br>Oh boy, here we go.</br></br></br></br>  Why are the panty shots censored?  Is this the new terraformars?  <br>It doesn't look too bad in some shots.</br>  What was it? JC Staffs attempt at making Attack on Titan?  This direction is terrible  <br>not even close, terraformars was overrated from the start<br><br>prison school is gold, especially that dime mari</br></br></br>  <br><br>Terraformars is the Ghost in the Shell of this generation deal with it.</br></br>  <br>youre not fooling anybody with b8 as obvious as this rookie</br>  Daily reminder there were some faggots that thought Prison School anime would be AOTS let alone AOTY.  <br>JC Staff is not as bad as LIDEN but still are pretty damn bad</br>  <br> Censorship is always a bad thing <br>Never said it wasn't. Fuck off with your assumptions. Go cry to the liberal trash that wants to protect people from everything.</br></br>  <br>What kind of idiot would think that about a show blatantly meant to be softcore porn?</br>  <br>But my chinese softcore porn!</br>  <br>Then Shingo confirmed for faggot.</br>  <br> Censorship is always a bad thing <br>I used to think the same when I was a horny teen.</br></br>  <br>It's not 暗闇三太 but is pretty good</br>  <br>Why the fuck does the background art look so mismatched with the character models? It looks bad.</br>  <br> detest the ecchi <br>Faggot.</br></br>  I thought it was going to be terrible with the art and aggressive censorship, but it did still make me laugh. I guess I'll keep watching this unless it gets unbearably bad  Gonna watch this shit even if it's censored as fuck need my prison school fix since 1 chapter a week for the manga isn't enough.  <br>and now you're a dumbass adult. Why the fuck would giant white bars across the animation eve, under any circumstance, be a good thing?</br>  <br>Dropped as soon as any filler shows up.</br>  I'm convinced that they don't give a fuck about the anime, they only want to sell the manga.  <br> Why the fuck does the background art look so mismatched with the character models? It looks bad. <br>CGI.</br></br>  <br> The Studio has to buy Airtime <br>I'm not convinced studios have any real revenue. Isn't the budget allocated by their financiers, such as major publishing houses wanting to adapt their product. <br><br>The only time a studio makes money is when they own the IP and then it's though merchandising.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You should criticize it then.<br><br>And then you enrolled in the Hitler Jugend.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this you're first anime?</br>  Well atleast they made it easy for me to decide whether to drop this or not.  <br>What'd you expect goyim? Buy the Blurays if you want your precious fanservice.</br>  <br>I don't see a point when the bds are coming. I have to wait to see nipple shots..so what? Nothing we can do about censorship until idiots are purged off the planet.</br>  this is shingo's bitch, right?  <br>Aren't you suppose to make your advertising material good if you want to sell something? Shitty anime will only result in shit manga sales.</br>  <br>Thats kind of the point of an adaptation are you retarded?</br>  Do they overlook her panty shots on purpose?  <br>Yes, why? I just finished streaming it on Funi and I wanted to discuss it with you guys.<br> What I meant is that they don't give a single fuck about the sales of the anime. </br></br>  <br>yes</br>  can someone explain this?  <br><br><br>is it because cameltoe? so it means the studio only had to remove a few lines and everything would've been fucking fine? kill me</br></br></br>  <br>To protect the children from indecency. It also helps the company sell their BDs. I could list more but yeah fuck you for being an idiot</br>  <br>Yea she looks kind of off though</br>  <br>the point is that the animation studio doesn't add the bars - they have absolutely no say in the matter.<br><br>the tv station handles all censoring, this is why you usually have uncensored raws coming from other stations.</br></br></br>  <br>fuck off and read it<br><br>There are so many nipple it is fucking insane, there is even a full blown lesbian sex scene showing everything but the vagina</br></br></br>  <br>Not really, just make people interested. It's not like a magazine or even tankobons are expensive.<br><br>No, that's only one point of an adaptation.</br></br></br>  <br>Kek</br>  Why is Funi doing every anime this season?   there are japanese niggas who pay for cable to see these white laser beams   <br>but they could censor it themselves with some kind of animation trick, anything would've been better than light rays<br><br>so it's their fault</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127883057   <br>I'm watching 11 shows and not a single one is Funi, stop watching garbage shows like this or Gangsta.</br>  It's not like everything about the anime was bad though.<br><br>The comedy was good and the seiyuu were all perfect. I didn't really like Gakuto but I guess it makes sense for him to be like that because he's supposed to be disgusting.</br></br>  <br> gangsta <br> garbage <br>jesus christ /a/ this thread is fucking shameful</br></br></br>  Holy fuck this is bad. VAs (except Kamiyan), pacing, art, censoring, fucking everything. The adaption couldn't be worse. <br><br>Well at least Kamiyan is doing a good job</br></br>  <br>Its entry tier trolling.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br> I don't see a point <br>That's your problem. Censoring has always been a cancer.<br><br>For every single one of us to be able to be here one time a penis had to penetrate a vagina and shoot sperm inside of it, why the fuck can't we see a drawn ass in an anime?<br>There is something really wrong about this.</br></br></br></br></br>   added to Plan to Watch <br> tag BD <br><br>See you faggots in six or so months. I'll pick the manga up again after that.<br><br>Waited for Yuushibu BDs and got maximum enjoyment.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, noone could do this author's artwork any justice anyway.<br><br>Unless Bones adapted this and went all out with their budget, this was going to be shit no matter who made it.</br></br></br>  <br>VAs are fucking terrible</br>  <br>It's one of the worst shows this year. It's gangsters chopping people in half with katanas while dodging bullets with dubstep blaring. It's "how do we get 14 year olds to watch this?": The anime</br>   Wasn't even hyped for the anime <br> First episodes are usually the best when it comes to animation to hook the audience <br> This was only the first episode <br><br>Good luck J.C. Staff</br></br></br></br>  <br>You really think so?</br>  Never know this may be like terraformars and they may chill with the censorship in the later episodes.  they should just release this and TLR:D as BD instead of airing them  i'm glad they're going with best pairing right away  I'm not even enjoying this but I want to see more of Andre's stupid fucking face  <br> It's "how do we get 14 year olds to watch this?": The anime <br>That would be Prison School</br></br>  <br>Even they know that censoring the main cast would take away too much.</br>  <br>You mean just like the manga...?</br>  the voice actors though<br>was I watching prison school or monogatari?</br>  <br>I'm sorry it doesn't have enough loli schoolgirls for you, anon</br>  <br><br>Wait a minute, this show is pandering to femdom cucks? Absolutely disgusting</br></br>   mfw they spent all their budget on the ass or tits scene   <br> cucks </br>  <br> It's one of the worst shows this year. <br> one episode in <br> not decent <br>I'm not saying its the greatest thing ever, but its more watchable than many of the shows that have come out this season.<br>The source material doesn't try to be "2deep4u", sure, but it is respectable for what it is-an action oriented series</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now it makes sense. They didn't censor Chiyo or Mari, just the mob characters. There's still hope.</br>  <br> 6 chapters adapted in 1 episode <br><br>Bravo JC Staff</br></br></br>  <br> I only watch MANime <br>You've probably unironically watched Jojo as well. No, but Gangsta tries way too hard to be serious. It makes it kind of cringeworthy, it's a very similiar feeling to SAO.</br></br>   mfw Hana voice  <br>At least zetsubou sensei is actively saving this shit from being utterly unwatchable</br>  It can't be worse than Shaft censoring more in the BD  <br> he hasn't read the manga </br>  <br> Mari <br>That should've been Meiko.</br></br>  <br>Gakuto's voice is annoying, Andre too slow, Shingo's voice too deep<br>Jo is alright<br>Kiyoshi is perfect</br></br></br>  Son, ore wa dissappointed desu.<br><br>This show is rekt infested.</br></br>  <br>How can someone shamelessly say that while posting otakubait?<br> I have nothing against Working or loli. </br></br>  <br>Do you realise how dumb you are?</br>  <br>They are not to blame for the censorship itself but for the lazy and obnoxious way they did it.</br>  <br>Why do JC Staff shows always have the most generic voice actors</br>  <br>it will be worth it</br>  <br>Gangsta may be bad but you're the fedora one. Maybe the other guy too, I don't know.</br>  <br> "how do we get 14 year olds to watch this?": <br>Appeal to maturity is the worst argument you can make, especially when you post shows with little girls in them.<br>I liked that episode of Working, by the way, before you try to call me out on being an anti-lolifag.</br></br></br>  It's been a while, angry HanaKana  <br>What?</br>    <br>Not just femdom fags, although Andre antics and VPs sweaty cunt are VERY present throughout the manga(the 'main' part of the series is essentially her talking cooch).<br>There is also pandering to piss fags, ass fags, yurifags, legfags, bondagefags.<br><br>But yeah, its mostly BDSM type shit</br></br></br></br>  Show me your desktop, bitch  <br>Damn I forgot what a horrible Monogatari ripoff that show was</br>  From seeing Prison School's Website it seems it's gonna have 6 Vols which means it's gonna be 1cour. 2 episodes for each Vol. since the first episode covered 5 to 6 chapters they are probably trying to finish up the first arc. This doesn't give me any hope, it might turn out to be a rushfest.<br><br>You might as well read the manga.</br></br>  <br> same studio <br> rip-off <br><br>what the fuck are you smoking</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least it's not Tera Formars.</br>  Digital production and CGI killed anime.<br>This is so soul-less.</br>  <br>I almost forgot how much of a Nisekoi ripoff Monogatari is.</br>  <br>You talk as if those chapters had heavy content.</br>  <br>Gakuto's my favorite character and I'm somewhat disappointed that his voice is so raspy.</br>  <br>It's still a ripoff. Just like Hibike is a ripoff of K-On</br>  This show is pretty hilarious<br>Hope its atleast 2 cours</br>  <br> filler <br> when there's like four cours worth of material </br></br>  <br>point went over your head<br><br>rip-off implies it's by a different studio<br>same studio means its just their style</br></br></br></br>  Am I seeing that properly? Those are dicks, right?  <br><br>It's probably just me but especially with the latest half of the manga I expected Gakuto's voice to be more gentlemanly.</br></br>  <br>It's gonna be 1cour looking at the BD Vols.</br>  what happened to this scene?  Censorship aside, episode was good until the second half. Hopefully they slow things down now that character introductions are out of the way, give everything a little more room to breathe.  <br>So they wont even get to the boys release since thats volume 9?</br>  <br> 2015 <br> still believing the dark ages were a thing <br> applying a euro mindset to fucking japan </br></br></br>  <br>If they try to reach to that arc in 1cour it's gonna be rushed. 9 fucking Vols in 1cour is stupidly idiotic. That would be Tokyo Ghoul all over again.</br>  <br>Except porn got banned in the UK.</br>  <br><br>Joe is packing</br></br>  <br>Not just you. He adresses everyone with dono and is generally the first one to come with a plan when a problem occurs. At the very least I expected a more calculated voice?</br>  <br>No it's not fucking idiot the chapters in the prison school manga are not heavy in content like ghoul. The anime really should end when they get released.</br>  <br> 6 volumes <br>Great,we'll have a shit season finale on top of that<br>Sasuga JC staff</br></br></br>  <br>children shouldn't watch this in the first place. it's the very reason for which rating systems work in order to inform parents to the contents of it all.<br><br>this is just a good example of the incompetence of new parents who instead of actually taking proper care of their children expect it to be done for them and blame tv an games for their inability to educate their children and manage what they see.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Way to ruin the hype.</br></br>  <br>Don't forget small tits. Fucking cowtitsfags spoiling fun for everyone.</br>  I liked it.  <br>BDSM too so this show is banned from the get go.</br>  <br> children shouldn't watch anime  <br><br>Kek.</br></br></br>  <br>Animeonlyfag?</br>  <br> children <br> watching anime at 2am <br>You are retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>So they can sneak dick past censors, but panty glimpses are too much. Nippon is really really gay.</br>  <br>No.</br>  This went from the most hyped anime this season to dead in the water<br>I'll see you when the blurays come out</br>  <br>Yeah the hardons were in the manga too,not as evident though</br>  Despite the story, this series doesn't really pick up until a little ways in, where they trade the hijinks for an actual plot.  <br>If they're doing 6 volumes they are most likely ending when shingo comes and cant open the gate expelling them all.</br>  <br><br>Will Prison School air on AT-X?</br></br>   BGM fucked on another funi rip <br>Seriosuly, again? FUCK funishit.<br><br><br><br>This. It is was 2 cour we would have had the perfect pacing. It felt rushed as fuck, worse than Yamada-kun's adaptation. <br> anons actually trying to defend the pacing by saying it was lax on content <br>Go fucking re-read the manga, the pacing was abhorrent. You don't even get a chance to take in what happened because it's already halfway into the next chapter. The light beams are just the icing on the cake.<br><br><br>BD's won't fix the terribly rushed adaptation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Too many exposed legs for tv buy the BD, perv.</br>  <br>i see you haven't learned to read properly yet. it's fine you'll manage one day.<br><br>i didn't mean all anime retard, i meant shows that are clearly not meant for children and could be deemed "improper" for them.</br></br></br>  <br> children not staying up till 2 am to watch cartoons </br>  <br>Holy shit, I didn't even notice that.</br>  Wait, is this really what Kiyoshi says? Is his mom a sumo otaku like Chiyo?  <br>I'm also a manga fag and I enjoyed it, even with all the censoring.<br><br>They are different mediums so it's not going to be translated the same way. However the comedy is still there, so I'll enjoy it. The censoring is annoying as hell though.</br></br></br>  <br>No, hes bullshitting. Hes just glad his mother bought him the eraser because he got to meet a girl with it.</br>  <br><br>Certain types of porn got banned from being PRODUCED in the UK.<br><br><br>You're confusing Australia with the UK.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>THIS</br>   Ok fuck me, I'm stalling on qbt for days. And I got a shit ton of rss setup so I don't want to uninstall, can somebody help me? I know it's offtopic, if you give no shits just ignore me.   <br>Source material is not from the same guy<br>So yes, it is a rip-off</br></br>  <br>This. Also I found the peeping scene to be one of the weaker parts in the manga but they managed to make it funnier. They really fucked up with Hana, though.</br>  <br>They'll probably end it at the end of the first arc, it will just be rushed.</br>  <br>24 episodes would make the pacing slow as fuck if they were gonna end it after the prison break.</br>  <br>This. Episode should have been about the first half of the first volume,ending with them getting imprisoned. Stretching it until Hana clovers fucked the pacing beyond belief.</br>  <br><br>He doesn't say it, he thinks it. His mom likes sumo.</br></br>  <br>Fucking this.</br>  <br>He's talking to himself. I don't remember that line being in the manga.</br>  <br>So you're saying they should have added filler all over the place to introduce the characters? They followed it panel by panel.</br>  <br>No,it was in the manga,I remember it.</br>  Why can they show some pantsu but not others? There were definitely some of cow tits panty shots intact  Holy fuck this was hilarious, The comedy is on point., Gakuto is the most based nigga you'll ever find.<br><br>Starting the manga right now I can't wait any longer.</br></br>   all these niggas getting beaten up by women <br><br>Literally worse anime of 2015.</br></br>  <br>In it's defense, it looks like only the background characters get censored. Hopefully it stays that way.<br><br/></br></br>  <br><br><br>Holy shit dropped<br><br>Fucking dropped. <br><br>dropped with the force of 1000000 suns</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Vice President dies</br>  Damn, Gakuto is hot.  <br>Prepare for tiddy</br>  <br>It wasnt. In the manga he first hates thats his mom buys him this sumo shit he thinks will keep her away from him then does a complete 180 when the eraser is what worked.</br>  <br>He looks better with character development.</br>  You guys do realize that the manga is mostly reaction shots and each chapter has very little actual content right?<br>Stop looking at the chapter count and yelling "rushed". It was fine</br>  <br>double picked up</br>    <br>And gets revived</br>  <br>Is she genetically engineered or just the result of superior German breeding?</br>  Fuck you manga faggots, it was great.  <br>She doesn't</br>  <br>totally agree with you anon</br>  <br>Because backgrounds are taken from Google image search, and all modern anime is disgusting CGI.</br>  how can the manga be so much better than the anime, gee whiz<br><br>vp best girl and most fappable</br></br>  <br>Kiyoshi dies</br>  Garbage anime.<br><br> hurr b-but COMEDY <br><br>What are you? A retarded 12 years old kid? Is this shallow "comedy" possible able to entertain you? Kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  the adaptation is bad compared to the manga, it always is.<br>but I am sure this series is a blast for those animeonly.</br>  <br>Filtered not censored<br><br>If you mess with your contrast you can see the nipples just fine</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> newfags replying to att whore tripfag </br></br></br>  <br>That line definitely was in the manga (bottom right balloon). Though it probably was translated like shit so you didn't notice.</br>  <br>But it did end on the first half of the first volume you fucking moron. They were imprisoned in chapter 3.</br>     mfw my friend is finally gonna read this shit after seeing the episode  <br><br>Thanks for the excessive censoring japan.</br></br>  <br>How can people watch utter fucking horse crap like this?<br><br>Fucking 5 seconds into the show the art style, horribly blurred drawing, voice acting, and the basic attitude/speech of the characters is yelling THIS IS CHEAP WORTHLESS CRAP STOP WATCHING IMMEDIATELY and if I give it 10 more seconds my whole body begins to cringe.<br><br>Skim through the ep in 20 seconds, maybe watch some select scenes, and it's just full of the absolute cheapest, most garbage, trash, worthless kind of fan service you could ever find in an anime.<br><br>How the fuck can you watch this and not have to almost LITERALLY vomit?<br><br>For fuck's sake.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>This shallow attempt at trolling seems to entertain you so that speaks volumes about your retardation.</br>  Wow they censored so much that they even put a bleep when he said fuck<br>I'm pretty sure the time this comes on their is no need to bleep out words like fuck</br>  <br><br><br>Jesus, Prison School threads are gonna be awful.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't give a shit about that, I'm ok with it actually, but, is there an ''alpha'' in the series? Or everyone is a beta fag? Because this ''I love getting hit by women'' thing is just so annoying, there are no series that do the opposite.<br><br>A friend told me that the director is a pretty cool guy, is he different from the other faggots?</br></br></br>  <br>Because not all of us are allergic to fun or basic bitch prudes</br>  <br> posts Mirai Nikki <br>You're trolling, aren't you?</br></br>  <br><br>There is an alpha. Won't spoil more though.</br></br>  Should I just read the manga or is the anime good?  <br>All of the men 'level-up' throughout the story, it's pretty great.</br>  <br>Read the fucking manga<br>The anime is rushing the jokes.</br></br>  <br>Elitist Manga fags will carrying on just acting all retarded.</br>  <br>You dont even need to read past the 4 first words of his post to know hes a shit tier troll.</br>  <br>I want Tien shopped into every flare censor now.</br>  It's friday, which means that Yamada will get spoiled today!  <br> You'll never get to spoil Yamada <br>Why even live?</br></br>  <br> Go back to work Yamada.</br>  <br>fuck you Yamada get back to work</br>  <br>I want to spoil Yamada, and give her everything she desires.

Would Yamada pay for being spoiled with anal sex?  <br>That's a funny way to spell Popura</br>        Did someone say Yamada?  <br/>  <br>This is horrifying.</br>  <br><br>good grief</br></br>    Remember that the show is native in 1080p, if you're watching this in anything lower you're missing out.  <br>Proof or fuck off.</br>        <br>It's pretty great that they will always have those exact expressions on their face.</br>  I hope there's more Izumi this season, she's 2cute.    <br><br><br>perfect</br></br></br>  Apathetic sex!  <br>Sounds alright.</br>  <br>I hope she gets lots of boobs to rest on.</br>  <br><br> Wants to spoil someone as useless as Yamada <br><br>Why bother?</br></br></br></br>  <br>because someone has to do it</br>  What a great episode.

The conclusion for the show effectively had nothing to do with the main themes, which was about sacrifice in the struggle against inevitability. <br><br>Like, they didn't really have a plan, did they? They expected to all end up retarded and crippled, until it was magically fixed. In fact, we had no reason to believe that they were going to be healed. <br><br>I don't know, man. It's like, in Mori Kitoh's Bokurano, the final battle had all the dead children showing up at the end with the explanation of "Oh, now the battles are over, everyone who died was resurrected."</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Should I watch this or read the manga? I'd prefer to read it, but if the adaption is good I might watch it too.  <br>They apparently don't have iPS technology in the Shinjuu dome. She wanted a baby, so she had to journey down the hetero route.<br>She didn't seem adverse to skinship with other girls, and she probably should be considered bisexual. But she already knew what she wanted, which was to be a mom, which in turn would require partnering with a guy.</br></br>  <br>There is no manga, just light novels.</br>  <br>Oh.  MAL tags it as manga so I just assumed it was one.  I guess I'll just watch this then, thanks.</br>  Daily reminder to sexualize the Yuushas  <br>Can do.</br>  <br> the date when Gin. <br><br>Who?<br><br>Should I even care?

For me it's always been the former.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Latter for me.
