[ Which SCP would you fug.  682 and 173  Adding 166 as well.<br><br>But anyone would fug her.</br></br>  This would be the fucking cool but then I remember all the fucking scary SCP there are.  Can you fuck a box of pizza?<br>Because 458 is best SCP.</br>  <br>173 is damn scary.<br><br>And disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br>As someone whose favorite pizza place closed down several years ago, I wholeheartedly agree.</br>  <br>Fuck, why cant that be real?<br><br>http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-458<br><br>Also, SCP anime would be great.</br></br></br></br></br>   You will never carry out Procedure 110-Montauk   I would Candy. 1548 will me along with the rest of the human race.  105 of course  I wrote the original, and yes I wish it were not so shit.   <br>You know, SCP-166 could be used as a way to determine if the universe considers trannies to still be male depending on whether or not they react to her.</br>  Why dont they just give 682 a picture of 096's face and let them kill each other?  <br>Because it would probably end up just like when they tried to use 173 to kill him.</br>  <br>What happened?</br>  <br>It's been a while since I read the log, but I believe 173 got driven into a corner, and 682 grew a few dozen extra eyes, then made them bulletproof when the researchers tried to shoot them out.</br>  <br>http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--<wbr>files/scp-682/682.mp3<br><br>Because 682 just won't fucking die. They tried crystallizing the damn thing and it didn't work.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br><br>But could 096 actually have died to either 173 and 682?<br><br>Because I think that 096 is actually one of the worst SCPs, especially because of all the photos that were spread around it in the world without people realizing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>would be a great idea.</br>  <br>If they really wanted to terminate 096, then I'm sure they would have done it by now.</br>  <br>076 vs 682 or 096<br>what happens?</br></br>  <br>/a/ would be the perfect recruiting ground.</br>  <br>Shit you wrote 105? That's one of the most recognizable ones now.</br>  <br>to be honest I like to concept, but looking back now I don't like the execution. I've asked some of the writers still around for a rewrite but they said people wouldn't be happy if they did.</br>  <br>What, preggo raping until she miscarriages?<br><br>Not my cup of tea tbh.<br><br>But I'd volunteer donating the daily sperm for 166.</br></br></br></br></br>  I stopped following this because there was a giant amount of shitty SCPs when it started getting more well known. Has there been any big developments in lore or anything lately?  <br>This. I remember following it about 3, maybe, years ago, but stopping because the influx of new users due to the game (Which was actually cool, it was pretty fun) and it was hard to filter out the shit.</br>  <br>The author is adamant that it is not rape, and is much worse than rape.</br>  <br>What could it be?<br>Slowly cutting her, or taking her organs out and dancing on them or something like that?</br></br>  <br>Probably the more painful kinds of torture. Drilling into the bones, small repeated acid baths, things like that?<br>Nothing is scarier, as it were. It's never going to be explained clearly.</br></br>  <br>It's hard imagining something worse than rape that won't leave any permanent damage and that you can keep doing week after week for years.</br>  <br>"Permanent" damage has a different meaning when you have all the sciencemagic in the world including a reusable regenerative pendant.</br>  <br>Seconded</br>  <br> 076 vs 682 <br>Ended up with 076 having 60% of it's body destroyed<br><br> 682 vs 096 <br>Dunno, 682 would probaly win.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why is 682 so strong?</br>  SCP-999 if it turns into a slime-girl.  <br>682 was also completely fucked up after the fight<br><br> why is 682 so strong? <br> Bad writing. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't mean it can't include rape.</br>  <br>Plot armor. Any number of SCPs should have completely removed it from existence already.</br>  <br>Because it's virtually indestructible. It's normally kept suspended in a cell flooded with acid. They tried to crystallize it, which was painful but ultimately not lethal. On top of that, it's just very strong and can grow stronger from eating.</br>  <br>Then they probably torture her until she is nearly dead and then heal her afterwards.</br>  <br>Nah, the joke of 999 is that he looks like an abomination but everyone finds him cute.</br>  Reading the SCP-231 article makes me feel like shit.  <br>That much is obvious. The question is, what kinds of torture?</br>  <br><br> All persons within the wave’s range collapse into crippling fits of laughter, allowing SCP-682 to escape and slaughter all in its path. Meanwhile, SCP-999 quickly rescues as many persons as it can, taking them to a safe place to recover from SCP-682’s "laughter wave" while agents suppress and recontain SCP-682. <br><br>Holy shit, SCP-999 is such a bro.<br><br>I really like SCPs that aren't unimaginable horrors, they get boring after a while. I like the camera one where it takes a picture of your truest desire and the other machine that gives you any kind of drink you want.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bookkeeper SCP is the best.</br>  <br>076 is just a really strong guy with respawn hax.</br>  <br>My favorite is the clockwork one that modifies stuff based on the input.<br>It's the coolest shit.</br></br>  <br>Stupid regeneration that breaks physics.</br>  <br>Same thing, to this day i still wanna know what happens if you put a monkey/human on it, the parts with it were all [REDACTED] or censored.</br>  <br>I like the experiment logs of that one and the greenish sponge sphere.</br>  <br>what number is that?</br>    <br>http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1230<br><br>Nicest SCP ever.</br></br></br>  <br>I want SCP-1230 to be my husbando. I'm gay for a magic book.</br>  <br>Yeah, that guy is boss as hell.</br>     http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-076 <br> SCP-076-2 resembles a lean Semitic human male in his late twenties. Hair is black, and eyes are gray, skin tone olive. Subject is 1.96 m in height and 81.65 kg in weight. Numerous tattoos depicting arcane and occult iconography are present all over the body (mostly in the form of leering demonic faces) and ranges from subtle to openly ostentatious. Subject, when encased inside SCP-076-1, is technically dead. <br>  <br> SCP-076-2's most unusual ability, however, is its ability to apparently materialize bladed weapons out of nowhere. Slow-motion video footage reveals that the blades in question are actually pulled from a miniature dimensional rift described as a "small hole in space." Where this portal leads is unknown, as is how SCP-076-2 is capable of generating said rifts. Footage of the blades in question shows them to be made out of a completely non-reflective black material appearing as a "black void in space." As the blades rapidly vanish after leaving the subject's possession, no structural analysis is possible at this time.<br>Wait a second, isn't this just Gilgamesh+Avenger?</br></br></br></br>  ID on all?<br><br>Gelbooru still is incomplete with that.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, he's basically Gil, but more hax.<br><br>He's actually Abel or Cain, cant remember.<br><br>Also, most SCPs are capable killing Servants.</br></br></br></br></br>  And why was 953 suppossed to be deadly or scary again?<br><br>She's basically a 2hu</br></br>  <br>Just finished reading the article<br>If only there were people so nice in real life</br></br>  Boy their shithole really went to hell. From what I see now anyone who has been around the longest now exists within a huge circle-jerk which is padded by "fans" and they have this whole group peer pressure shit going on to keep their crappy OC in while booting out any dissenters. <br><br>What's more is they have a monopoly on the entire thing by making it incredibly iconic. I remember back when the logo was half a cat, it being somewhat of a mascot. Where's the cat? <br>Now the place is fanfiction.net-tier garbage and nobody can reclaim its once former quality because if anyone were to create anything similar they'd be seen as a shoddy rip-off by their shitty subcommunity that has never watched the Friday the Thirteenth series. <br><br>Get out, /v/ermin.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Less hax. Mary sue awesome swords, not bullshit plot hack macguffins that can do anything that he needs at the moment.</br>  man what would be /x/ and  /lit/ 's reaction to this?  <br>How did Japan even know about SCP?<br><br>there's quite a bit of art on pixiv as well.</br></br></br>  <br>SCP was created in /x/<br>/lit/ would have your average reaction, some are good, other not.</br></br>  <br>http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/</br>  <br>Youkai are all deadly and scary. The Foundation would have a hell of a time rounding up Gensokyo.</br>  <br>/x/ has long since disowned SCP; go there and ask right now. As welcoming as they are of shitposting you'll be surprised at how quickly they'll tell you to shut the fuck up and leave.</br>    <br>SCP is pretty creepy though, anyone on japan with too much free time will discover SCPs.</br>  <br>results:<br><br><br>2hus cant be contained.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I only recognize 073, 076, 096, 105, 173, and 682. At least, those are the ones I'm sure of.</br>  Which SCP would be the best waifu?  <br>But 2hus are good girls.</br>  <br>999, the guy who makes Guro toys (forgot the number) and the eye ball things (that i also forgot the number) are there too.<br><br><br>I don't know waifu, but see  for husbando</br></br></br></br>  <br> but upon opening SCP-1230, all its pages were soaking wet with the same message on every page: “I’m so sorry. I never intended for this to happen. I just wanted to make people happy.” repeated over and over. SCP-1230 remained in this state for three weeks and its desk  <br><br>Oh god, that's so sad.</br></br></br>  I like 106 and the one about the furry murdering korean foxgirl. <br><br><br>that's horrible, but funny. My favorite is doctor bright's things he's not allowed to do</br></br></br>  <br>That's the fate of any community that got too successful/popular for its own damn good.</br>  So 073 and 076 are ancient astronauts or something?  Which one is the little girl that telepathically compels people to rape her?  <br>I thought that was from the Monster Girl Encyclopedia thing</br>  #11-18.  <br>191 is carrying the calculator and digital camera.</br>  They need to purge every humanoid SCP and animal SCP. The ratio of shitty ones to good ones is too high to justify. <br>Of course it will never happen because 90% of them are written by esteemed members of the community's hierarchy.</br>  <br> The camera that photographs your truest desire <br><br> Subject: SCP-173 <br> Photographed Activity: Standing in its container. <br> Photo Result: No change. <br><br>Either it's not truly sentient or  it's exactly where it wants to be.  I'm not sure which is worse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see what's so bad about the latter.<br>Maybe it doesn't want to kill people.</br></br>  <br>Evidence from any time someone blinks while in its presence suggests otherwise.</br>  <br> Subject: SCP-451 <br> Photographed Activity: Weeping in Site-19 cafeteria. <br> Photo Result: SCP-451 lies awake in a bunk in the Site-19 sleeping quarters, surrounded by other staff members. SCP-451 exhibits a look of relief on his face. <br><br>Oh god.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Could be an unwilling reflex response.</br>  <br><br>According to her case file, no other SCPs, drugs, or procedures are allowed to be used on her aside from Procedure 110 montauk and the Class A Amnesiac she must be administered weekly so that the emotional pain she must endure is always at it's peak.<br><br>It's just rape, at worst, it's gang rape and beating. Nothing she couldn't survive on her own, but definitely shit that causes her a lot of pain and possibly very minor permanent damage. She's not allowed to be given anesthetics either.<br><br>Shits fucked. At least they're trying to find a cure for her.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's worse than rape.<br>The foundation is just more imaginative than you.</br></br>  <br>It's not.<br>The author is just full of shit. gotta go for that true horror factor mate.<br>They aren't mutilating her. They're emotionally torturing her.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not torture if it's for science</br>  <br>it's not rape if she can't remember</br>  <br>Then why do the doctors assigned to SCP 231-7 commit sudoku as result of merely witnessing the procedure.</br>  Is there a loli SCP?<br>Can't remember.</br>  <br>The scientific data is just too much for them to handle.</br>  <br>It'd clearly have to be much worse than rape to induce that.</br>  <br><br>I love the friendly SCPs. Because despite their power, they still strive to be decent things in a world of fucked up monsters and horrors.</br></br>  How come sometimes I see japanese artists doing SCP shit?<br>How do they find out about it? Most jap artists are terrible at english.</br>  <br>Sometimes it's the japs who translate our shit and not the other way around.</br>  <br/>  <br>The one that befriended 682, the cyborg and the reality warper spring to mind</br>  <br>231 probably counts. <br>She's between the ages of  [REDACTED]  and  [REDACTED] <br><br>You think some people wouldn't kill themsevles if it was their job to to watch an innocent, probably underaged, be repeatedly raped/beaten. <br>Not everyone gets as much pleasure from watching that as you do.

It's a total of over 80 cities, with 51 locations announced so far which was a lot more than LAST. Looks like they're anticipating a lot more people. Screenings start Oct. 10 which is also Naruto's Birthday. Hopefully they have some decent giveaways.

Of course I wouldn't be caught dead going to see a nardo movie. Still, this basically guarantees a camrip if both the nips and shitposters fail us.</br>  <br>I thought this was a bootleg<br>Looks shit to be honest</br></br>  <br>Won't the chinese in the states have this on a good 'quality' DVD once it releases?</br>  <br>I hope I can get some tickets for the Houston Alamo draft house one. For The Last I had to drive to Shit Antonio to watch it.</br>  <br> Of course I wouldn't be caught dead going to see a nardo movie. <br>What's up anon, you're shy to tell others you like chinese cartoons?</br></br>  <br>How does one attain the title of Meme Master?</br>  <br> Houston guy calling San Antonio shit. <br>Not like your city is better. Heck all Texas cities are shit especially Dallas with it's brown outs.</br></br>  The Last was really boring. Naruto jobbed for 3/4 of it, while everyone else looked OP as fuck. <br><br>Here's hoping that there's a bit more action in this one.</br></br>  These threads are slowing the fuck down even without the shitposting. Nothing much to discuss until the movie is out uh?  <br>From the few nip bloggers who talk more about the movie and not just certain characters it seems like it.</br>  <br>There's an interview/sneak preview on the 5th like there was for The Last.<br><br>Until then there's nothing we can do but wait. I don't even think there'll be any more teaser trailers.</br></br></br>   Actually according to TV Tokyo's main site the BORUTO Complete Guide airs <br><br> 2015年8月4日(火) 25時35分～26時05分 <br><br> Though once you convert the time it ends up as 08月05日（水） 01時35分〜02時05分 <br><br> http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/program/<wbr>de...508042535.html</wbr> <br><br> It's a variety show. They see clips and a segment with Kishi interview.  <br><br> He will answer questions such as: <br><br> * The reason behind the names of Boruto, Himawari, and Sarada <br><br> * Why he made Sasuke as Boruto's shisshou <br><br> Among other things.  <br><br> FC2 and Miomio uploaders have the complete video in 360- 720p usually within a few hours after it airs live. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The NYC screenings are already sold out. Both of them. </br>   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=FF<wbr>PbqldBAwQ&amp;feature=youtu.be</wbr>  [ ] <br>Fuck.</br>  <br><br> Let's watch it together anon </br></br>  <br> that trailer at the end <br>Well shit. Looks like just about every spoiler we got was correct.</br></br>  <br> Fuck <br><br>something about the new footage, or is there something bad spelled out in moonrunes in there?</br></br></br>  <br>I pulled two all-nighters hoping for preview spoilers, and then this shit drops.</br>  heyyy lmao any word on where it's airing in Australia?  <br>Bolt is very cute.<br><br> that face of despair </br></br></br>  <br>Looks like Burrito and his dad really don't get along.</br>  <br> Bolt is very cute <br>Normally I'd say he got it from his mother but after seeing shota nardo in the latest Shippuden ED, I'm not so sure.</br></br>  <br>Goddammit.<br> It looks really good. </br></br>  <br>noice</br>  <br>She just doesn't fucking age. She's a woman in her 30s, and she looks 16.</br>  <br> The reason behind the names of Boruto, Himawari, and Sarada <br>We already know that Boruto was named afer Neji and Himawari because Hyuuga clan member have names related to the sun, now Sarada, I´m really curious about her name origin.</br></br>  <br>Fuck, man. It's been 9 years since I started reading/watching Nardo and Fuck. This really got to me.</br>  <br>most of the original kids don't look too bad, but not everyone was so lucky...</br>  <br> now Sarada, I´m really curious about her name origin <br>He was hungry?</br></br>  <br> that Salad <br><br> please select all images with salad </br></br></br>  <br>Nah. Naruto stopped being cute before 12. Boruto's already 12 or 13. He definitely gets it from his mom. "Gentle features" and all that.</br>  <br>He's Nurudu and Hinata's son alright.</br>  <br>I think it´s because SAsuke and SAkura but they just could name here Sayuri or something like that, they don´t had to name her after a dish.</br>   Gohan had one arm and trained Trunks <br> Sauce has one arm and trains Bolt </br>  <br>anyone know when tickets go on sale or have they alreay? I've never seen any anime movie premiers before so I'm not sure how this works</br>  I went to the Madoka Rebellion showing in LA but I wouldn't be caught dead for a Nardo one.<br><br>The only way I would even consider going is if Kishi was there and we could ask him questions.</br></br>  <br>Fuck.</br>  <br> Looks like they're anticipating a lot more people <br>Considering how when The Last came out in America, it was sold out literally everywhere, that's not surprising</br></br>  <br>He takes it after Minato.</br>  <br>Just like the rest of that shitpile.</br>  <br>Aw man.</br>  <br> I wouldn't be caught dead for a Nardo one. <br>I'm enough of a fan that I would like to watch the movie, but I wouldn't go to a theater unless they allowed patrons to wear ski masks.<br><br><br> if Kishi was there and we could ask him questions. <br>when is his US appearance? I seriously hope he gets some /a/-level questions from the audience and not just death threats from hamplanets.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I seriously hope he gets some /a/-level questions from the audience and not just death threats from hamplanets <br>I wouldn't be surprised if a few of you autists show up and start bombarding him with shit he doesn't care about.</br></br>  <br>they could probably offers more than 2 showings at each art-house theater and still sell out.<br><br>should not be a fucking surprise to them</br></br></br>  <br>  implying kishi has cared about anything for the last decade </br>  <br>Jesus Christ Lee. What the fuck did they do to you?</br>  <br>Minato's facial features where a bit too sharp. It's definitely from his mother.</br>  Anyone wanna dump that plot summary from the other day?  <br> not just death threats from hamplanets. <br><br>Considering Supernatural landwhales do stupid shit all the time at comic con, you should expect a few NScucks to do some dumb shit. <br>They might even scare Kishi off from ever visiting the west again.</br></br></br></br>  So who will be get caught in the inevitable future love triangle for the inevitable sequel with the new generation?<br><br>There's like 2 girls surrounded by boys and apparently Sarada has become "popular with the boys of her class."</br></br>  <br>He cares about some things. He is just a bad writer.</br>  <br><br>https://www.reddit.com/live/vay7eyg<wbr>l1zj3/<br><br>read here</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Should be in the archives. Go look there.</br>   The Last -Naruto the Movie- topped both the Japanese Blu-ray Disc and DVD charts from Oricon during its first week of sales after July 22. In the July 20-26 week, it sold 19,335 copies of the limited complete Blu-ray edition, and it also sold 18,565 of the limited complete DVD edition and 4,706 of the standard DVD edition. <br><br> The movie set franchise records for first-week sales on both the Blu-ray and DVD charts. It is also the first time that the Naruto franchise topped both charts simultaneously. The previous franchise record holders were the limited complete edition of the Naruto Shippūden: Blood Prison film (#3 on the weekly DVD chart in 2012) and the limited complete edition of Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie (#11 on the weekly Blu-ray chart in 2013). <br><br>How NaruSaku hambeasts are gonna explain this now?</br></br></br></br>  <br> leddit </br>  <br>Yeah, I kinda didn't want to go there</br>  <br>They will just say it proves that Kishi caved into Naruhina demand or something like that.</br>  <br>that's fucking cute</br>  <br><br>theyve been on suicide watch since the cuckening<br><br><br><br>its right fucking there you massive faggot. literally the first 2 lines. fuck what site its from, its got the info you want you piece of shit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I firmly believe Mitsuki is asexual.<br><br>If I had to guess out of all the boys we've seen as a koi no raibaru to Boruto, it would probably be the one that seems to be portrayed as the closest thing to a bishounen, Inojin.</br></br></br>  <br>The magenta text at the end says<br> The battle is over, <br> and until now all of the time I have spent has been poured into the manga. <br> Truly, the Naruto movie I wanted to make is here. <br> Lastly, I have one thing to say... <br> I cannot write/draw anything greater than this... <br> -Director of production, Kishimoto Masashi </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is not our fault that Organic Dinosaur chosed Reddit of all sites to share her traslations.</br>  <br>He says that Boruto was like the best thing he's ever written so he cares at least a little bit.</br>  <br>FUCKING<br>BAKERSFIELD</br></br>  <br> All those shots of the early chapters  <br>All this trailer did was making me sad that Naruto turned to shit halfway through.<br><br>At least it looks like it's gonna end with an okay movie</br></br></br></br>  <br>Denial. What else?</br>  <br> Considering Supernatural landwhales do stupid shit all the time at comic con <br><br>And they always gets BTFO by the cast.<br>Kishi will probably do the same, probably even worse since NS shippers have ascended past the insanity found in fujoshis.<br><br> Kishi: Sakura never loved Naruto more than a friend <br> a pod of landwhales trample over his security and he gets murdered <br> Japan never allows another mangaka to visit the US afterwards </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Mitsuki will be in that.<br><br>Maybe Shikamaru's son who is his 'official' rival in the movie?</br></br></br>  <br> They have been trying to prove Nips hated The Last for months now, this destroy all their arguments.<br>Also, Estelle best Kiseki.</br></br>  <br> So who will be get caught in the inevitable future love triangle for the inevitable sequel with the new generation? <br>Himawari.</br></br>  <br> How NaruSaku hambeasts are gonna explain this now? <br><br>mistaken preorders from a year ago only made because of misleading sauce appearance in commercials</br></br></br>    <br>If you asked me to tell you which of these two designs was the older Hinata without prior knowledge, I probably wouldn't be able to tell you.</br>  <br> I don't think Mitsuki will be in that. <br>I know. I'm excluding him</br></br>  <br> be the one that seems to be portrayed as the closest thing to a bishounen, Inojin <br>The real question is whose pants would he be trying to get into, though: Salad or Bolt's?</br></br>  <br>I really want that some NScuck try some crazy shit so their fandom could die for once.</br>  <br>Same.</br>  <br>If ChouChou becomes like her mom, muh dick won't be able to take it</br>  <br>Well, to be fair it seems a lot better than most of the schlock he's put out ever since the series turned to shit. And the plot is fraught with all of the "Kishi-isms" you'd expect.</br>  <br>They hint that Sarada is popular with the boys recently, seems like a foreshadowing Boruto will have competition.</br>  <br> Hey Sauske I'm hungry, get me some salad before you go off to buy ninja cigarettes </br>  <br>He should get ChouChou.</br>  <br> It's a gender reverse of this <br><br>By the way, I always liked that fan theory of how the girls said Sasuke liked girls with long hair so Hinata kept hers short</br></br></br>  <br> so their fandom could die for once. <br><br>Why would you want that? Their insane delusional rants are the stuff of legends.</br></br></br>  Sasuke and Sakura grew up like all right adults, even if I didn't care for them as characters in the manga, they seem fine to me now.  <br>Does that bitch have a ginger Afro with a shuriken sticking out of it?</br>  <br>she has the ham genes though, only when she goes butterfly mad she could become tolerable.</br>  <br>The correct answer is everyone.<br>He is the Prince of Sluts and heir of the Slut King and Slut Queen.</br></br>  <br> how the girls said Sasuke liked girls with long hair so Hinata kept hers short <br><br>How did that rumor started? Did they saw him fangirling over Itachi and thought he was a girl?</br></br></br>  <br> they seem fine to me now <br>Pink is still Pink, but Sauce (at least when it comes to people other than his daughter) is doing alright.</br></br>  <br>i'm having the thing from watching this. I've been following this shit for 10 fucking years.</br>  <br>Yeah I give you that, also it´s funny how fujos wank don´t bother me that much, maybe because Naruto and Sasuke were indeed pretty gay.</br>  <br>What a fucking nerd.</br>  <br>I think either Sakura or Ino asked him what his type was</br>  <br> They have been trying to prove Nips hated The Last for months now, this destroy all their arguments. <br>Yes but those guys will try to shift goalposts again.<br>Estelle is indeed the best.</br></br></br>  <br> Sure is nice hanging with Naruto's kid <br> Makes me wish I had a kid of my own <br> Ah well <br> Maybe I should give Karin a call </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> saskue <br> liking girls </br></br></br>  <br>No, Sakura's fine too. She raised Sarada well, runs a hospital, and does shit with the constrains Kishi allows her. Let go of that hatred, you're just as bad as the bitter NScucks.</br>  <br>Fucking this <br>And you know what i miss the most? <br>Old Sasuke before he became master edge lord <br> pic related  <br>the Zabusa act was the shit<br><br>now that i think about it i don't thik we ever see something this graphic in shippuden it's all shitty DBZ fights</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> When I have my own kid, I will spoil them like this every day </br>  <br> Let go of that hatred <br>Sorry, anon. With the exception of The Last she'll always be Pink Shit to me.</br></br>  <br>I find it funny the front three girls bullied Sakura calling her names and Ino put those bitches in their place.<br><br> tf Sakura ruined her friendship for some dick <br><br><br> tf Sauce would have stayed if Sakura pushed out a boy <br> let's name him Itachi </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> ignoring Sarada had to ask Sasuke to not give up on Bolt <br> ignoring Sasuke's staying home </br></br></br>  <br>Did he bang Matsuri yet?</br>  <br>Yeah</br>  <br> maybe because Naruto and Sasuke were indeed pretty gay. <br><br>That's because Kishi can't write friendships for shit.<br>Even Ino and Sakura's friendship as kids seemed like carpet munchy.<br>Usually when fictional friendships seem gay to everyone (not just fujoshits/but I do mean everyone), it means the writer fucked up or is a shit writer.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Old Sasuke before he became master edge lord  <br> pic related  <br> the Zabusa act was the shit <br> That's basically Sauce's character in the movie, except without the avenger part. He even does a callback to Zabuza with Bort by turning him into his sword and throwing it at Momo. There's even a flashback. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>they where just think ice picks you fucking nerd lol</br></br>   only 2 weeks until Narutards are forced to leave /a/ indefinitely  <br><br>Can't wait.</br></br>  <br> Even Ino and Sakura's friendship as kids seemed like carpet munchy. <br><br>Wasn't in a Gaidan said Ino and Sakura would have hooked up as true love if one of them had been a guy? It WAS carpet munchy. Sakura wasn't a lesbian, unfortunately. Ino seemed bi.</br></br></br>  <br>Only if she is dressed as Naruto.</br>  <br>In one of the novels he gets forced into an arranged marriage but then she cucks him for her bodyguard or something like that.</br>  <br><br>Does momo die?</br></br>  <br>We are never leaving faggot. <br>This board, /co/, and /pol/ are my main boards.</br></br>  <br> for some dick <br>A dick which, even to this day, we have no objective proof that she ever got. <br><br>Hell, they don't even talk in the movie. Maybe a line or two, that's it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> walk it off lol XD </br>  <br> implying <br>You said that about The Last, too.</br></br>  <br>That's fine, neither do Hinata and Naruto. Their only conversation is about if Bolt's cheating or not.<br><br>Thank fuck two shitty pairings got shafted. Boruto and Sarada are better.</br></br></br>  <br>It was Konoha Hiden and I quote<br> If they’d been a man and a woman, they might very well have fallen in love. Maybe tiny hearts would’ve been popping and flailing around them. </br></br>  <br>Bort slams pic related into his face, so yeah. He dies. He dies hard.</br>  I'm curious.<br><br>Does Hinata STILL call Naruto, Naruto-kun? Or Darling? The summaries are confusing me.<br><br>She definitely calls Sauske without the kun now though</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure having an actual conversation about their child indicates a better lifestyle than not even having a discussion at all</br>  <br> Meanwhile Naruto and Sasuke are princess carrying each other in the final fight. <br><br>Kishi truly wrote this movie.</br></br></br>  <br>Ino should have grown a dick. Then they'd both be happy.</br>  <br> Sasuke and Hinata have more conversation than Sakura and Sasuke and Hinata and Naruto <br><br>Top kek</br></br></br>  <br> Naruto never killed a single person <br> his 12 year old son just killed someone without giving a fuck  <br> hurrr he is a clone of his father </br></br></br>  <br> Does Hinata STILL call Naruto, Naruto-kun? Or Darling? <br>He probably makes her call him "Lord Seventh" just like he does with his son, and everyone else who isn't called Sasuke.</br></br>  <br>fantastic</br>  <br>It means it's not a shipping moment, it's about Boruto.<br><br>Hinata gets BTFO and off-panelled pretty soon too. When she's not just acting like The Housewife.</br></br></br>  <br> Their only conversation is about if Bolt's cheating or not. <br><br>actually, no, naruto leaves his seat to sit with hinata and watch the match with her and himawari</br></br></br>  Naruto is a gateway anime of the worst kind. It's a bad series, a clusterfuck of story and characterization that isn't very well done by any aspect, but which attempts to compensate for its weaknesses by adding in excessive shipping faggotry and DARKNESS. The normal anon can see this as the shit it is, and may enjoy it, hate it or be indifferent to it, but all the while recognizing that the series itself, regardless of their opinion, is plain bad.<br>However, these very aspects that try to smear over the shit of its core make it a breeding ground for aspie, unsociable underageb&amp; faggots who engage in every kind of faggotry both online and in the real world. The superpowered characters all trying their hardest to look cool, the jutsus, peculiar, colorful clothes, the whole ninja faggotry and everything about the Naruto world fuels their escapist fantasies, while the pity-party character backgrounds, emphasis on revenge, and overall preachiness of the series make it fit just right with the mary-sueish drives of your average preteen and his sense of unwarranted self-importance towards the world. Exactly the kind of shit that makes little kiddies and underageb&amp; retards eat this shit right the fuck up.<br>Naruto is basically THE series to attract the most hated anime fanbase known to /a/, which is why, regardless of individual opinions, it is the responsibility of every anon to troll the fuck out of this show and everyone who likes it, and ensure that no Naruto threads ever encourage the newfriends to show their faces here.</br></br>  <br>Actually, that's the funny part. They tell him to make his hax Rasengan again, but he says it's no good against Momo, so nardo pours all his remaining chakra into it and lets his son do the dirty work.</br>  <br> Naruto never killed a single person <br>Kakuzu got rekt though</br></br>  <br>Sakura addressed him as Naruto in the Gaiden.</br>  <br>Hinata and Sasuke have only one conversation which is equal to the amount Naruto has with her.<br>Most of her conversations are with her children.<br>Sakura is the one who seems to only have conversations with her child.</br></br></br>  <br>Kakashi killed him tho. stabbed him right in da head</br>  <br>Kakashi technically finished him off. Even though he was dissolving on a molecular level and was pretty much fucked no matter what.<br><br>But hey, details.</br></br></br>  <br> still no vegas <br>fuck you too<br>the second time I care about fucking naruto besides the last and you tells us to fuck off again<br><br>thanks a lot<br> thank god I'm going to be in LA for the month of its release. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They actually talk? For the first time in 15 years? Fucking incredible. This is the highlight of the movie.<br><br><br>Between their small talk, their cute family pictures and the Hokage auguration spinoff, we atleast know NaruHina are having a decently healthy family life atleast.<br><br>SS doesn't get shit even when it's actually canon. Top fucking kek.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And their conversation was about what was Bolt-doing.</br>  <br>Kakashi basically gave him a mercy kill now that I think about it.</br>  <br>Apparently they are both now BFFs with Temari. <br><br>Though pretty dick move not to invite Karui to the Konoha MILF club.</br></br></br>  <br>#whocares</br>  <br>The only reason anyone comes to your shithole desert state is to lose money, drink and catch STDs.</br>  <br><br>In the movie she calls him dearest/darling<br><br>She mentions him as her husband too. So she dropped the whole Naruto-kun thing</br></br></br></br>  <br>that comes later</br>  <br>SS get watching the kids as the sun sets which is a romantic scene and Sasuke's staying. So seems they are doing fine.</br>  I'm not impressed with this guy at all.<br><br>Kirito would murder him without fail.</br></br>  <br>Haha, did you see the lasct chapte? Kweeheehee! No. Just no.</br>  Maybe <br><br>it's Touch Me! that is Overlord's version of Kirito, not Ainz</br></br>  <br>Most likely since Kirito was the embodiment of the authors wish fulfillment and made to be basically unbeatable while Ainz was a maybe a above average player in a really good guild.</br>  silly anon you can't kill skellies they're already dead  <br>Kirito won from the admin.<br><br>I doubt this guy could do the same.</br></br></br>  <br>This is too obvious, anon.</br>  <br>Not obvious. Kirito beat the admin.<br><br>Kirito is above god level.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Your bait is faulty and crude, anon.</br></br></br>    <br>He's pretty god-tier so far.</br>  <br>That because he is the equivalent of a high level end game character in a low level area so of course he seems godly.</br>    <br><br><br>Like I said before. Kirito could bend the rules, just like Neo from matrix. And then he beat the admin.<br><br>Obviously Kirito can rape this skeleton guy easily.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We don't know how the game mechanics would link together anon, so there is no point talking about this.</br>  <br>Oh, I see. <br><br>I'm loving the anime so far. Can't wait until he meets some strong opposition.</br></br></br>  <br>Nobody ever said he couldn't and learn to bait better.</br>  <br>Kirito is a poorly written shit character.</br>  <br>He's the  spookiest  MC around.</br>  <br>You should go read the novel it's pretty good and we get a newly translated chapter every Saturday.</br>  All this bait and obvious samefagging.  This anime is a power fantasy designed to appeal to people whose self-esteem is low enough to gain feels of power from it, prove me wrong.  <br>Thanks, anon. I might check it out if the wait gets unbearable for the next episode.</br>  <br>MC was a salaryman and one of the requirements of his guild was "being a Riajuu"</br>  <br><br>He implied that he hated his life because he just worked and then went home and slept though.</br></br>  <br> Riajuu <br>whats that?</br></br>  <br>normalfag</br>      <br>Riajuu is internet slang for somebody who has a good life. It's typically used by otaku and such on message boards like 2chan to refer to people who have girl/boyfriends and are popular with their peers.</br>  <br>But Ainz was a normalfag.<br>Also, he's got some serious paranoia issues.</br></br>  overlord is shit! SHIT!  <br>In the older days of Ultima Online, some players could beat the insta-kill teleporting npc guards<br>Then that got patched out. It's not always about bending the rules, sometimes it's about finding the loopholes</br></br>  <br>like that guy who managed to assassinate lord british.</br>  Maybe he would, maybe he wouldn't... how do you know he wouldn't get warped in has a normal human. One of the lizardmen in the later chapters would fuck him up then... if he was a high level paladin anti-undead kinda character then yeah, Ainz would get so rekt. He doesn't have the back-up of his PK guild. <br><br>Another thing to consider, wouldn't they join forces? if you think about it, they would be the only two earthlings on this fantasy plane. I think they would recognize this and screw around and such.

BUt can he beat Uciha Madara?</br>  Kirito loses by default unless he can pull off something on the same level as a sharknado.  <br>Bones isn't in a game. It's an actual fantasy world.

Was it his real face?  <br>That's what I'm thinking too.</br>  <br>Probably since everyone comments how average and unpopular is and how Ainz himself says that his own self-evaluation dropped by few grades later on.</br>  <br><br>At least we will get a new LN chapter in 4 days.<br><br>The bad news is that  it is a climb chapter. </br></br></br></br>  <br>4 days to new chapter, s-so it's not all that bad right?<br><br> It's all that bad. </br></br></br>  <br> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</wbr></wbr> </br>  <br>It was face of old japanese man with some wrinkles and scars buti'm not sure about the last one</br>  <br><br><br>I think it mentions him using an older mans face or something.</br></br></br>  <br>God that was graphic, i hope they dont censor any part of it</br>  <br> &gt;&gt;Shallchair <br>kek<br>Any place have vol 5 translated?</br></br></br>  <br>   it is a climb chapter. </br>  <br>The same place as usual nigga.</br>  <br> Ainz took off his helmet after finishing, surprising the four of them with his looks.<br>"Black hair and eyes just like Nabel-san, you don't seem to be from around here. I heard people like Momon-san are common in the south, do you hail from there?"<br><br>"Yes, we came from a land faraway."<br>“He is older than expected, old enough to be called 'uncle’.” <br>- Vol 2 Chp 1</br></br></br></br></br></br>  CLIMB IS REALLY INTERESTING  So far we've seen that the guardians are capable of acting outside of Ainz's direct orders due to various reasons.<br><br> Demiurge willing to fight Shalltear after being told not to. Shalltear losing control due to Blood Frenzy and then attacking people she had no business attacking because she was afraid of failing Ainz, Sebas who doesn't fully prioritize Nazarick above saving people. And finally Cocytus who wants to spare the lives of worthy lizardmen. <br><br>Does PD have anything he can actually work with here if he's cunning and pokes at these characteristics? While the guardians would probably never purposefully betray Ainz, I think there might be some flames to fan if PD plays his cards right.</br></br></br></br>  WHEN IS HAMUSUKE?    <br>Me too. I loved reading that part.</br>  <br>Maybe 2 weeks</br>  Being a skeleton must feel really nice  <br><br><br>It's not like Nazarick's servants even hate humans though. They just think of them as lesser beings, because, for the most part, they are. They respect strength, and the only truly strong humans would be other Player Characters.<br><br>Disregarding that, anyone who Ainz said was to be treated with respect would be. Full stop. Even if they were a cripple.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Narbel but older and male.</br>  repost from last thread<br><br>I wonder who would suit her more. Personally I kind of pictured Kana Asumi would do her the most justice.</br></br>  Is there any reason why the manga is sporadic in release dates for english translation?  <br>It's a monthly manga.</br>  <br>Even if the manga is released monthly it still depends on the translation release by the guys translating it.</br>  <br>pretty sure they're just mobs that spawn on her floor and she drags them with her because she's to lazy to walk on her own. That, and her personal sex toys.</br>  <br><br>This. Most of Nazarick evaluates the world like so:<br><br>Supreme Beings &gt; Direct Creations (Mostly Floor Guardians or people like Pandora's Actor) &gt; Lieutenants &gt; Named Mobs &gt; Automatically Produced Mobs &gt; Worthy Enemies &gt; Random People &gt; Enemies<br><br>There's a few exceptions, like Cocytus valuing the Lizardmen more than the mass produced mobs and Sebas in general, but for the most part, anything with a Nazarick label on it is more unimportant that anything without for any inhabitant of Nazarick.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  At this point in the anime, is it even clear that Ainz is ACTING how he believes the leader of Nazarick should be acting?<br><br>I feel like telling those quibbling about the "cliched" exchange between Ainz and Nigun or Ainz "showing off" that they're completely missing the point.</br></br>   Touch Me had a brother who played a Human Mage <br> Said brother is   the only surviving member of the Eight Greed Kings and wants nothing to do with the world <br><br>Man, awkward.</br></br></br>  HITTEN MITSURUGI RYU<br><br>KUZU RYU SEN</br></br>  <br> double Tsubamegaeshi </br>  So I really love this so far don't get me wrong, but  how is this any different than Mahouka gary stu bullshit? It's basically the same thing but with good characters and no useless bullshit masturbatory writing <br>Is the MC ever getting any good conflict or opposition? Honestly I find the worship scenes kinda creepy, even thought that's how Kings are, it's been 3 times so far with such scenes in the anime.</br>  I've read all the manga so far, where would that place me for the LN? Like volume and chapter wise?  <br> Is the MC ever getting any good conflict or opposition? <br><br>Yes.</br></br></br>  <br> Ainz has a sense of smell and touch despite being a skeleton. <br><br>That's not fair, he should have to sacrifice important aspects of being alive like the rest of us.</br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty much the same to be honest.<br><br>We're just here for Albedo and Narberal. The novels aren't really that good either.</br></br></br>  <br>Less incest.<br><br>Fuck you nerd I'm hear to see the fights. Why are they so much clearer than everything else?</br></br></br>  <br>Probably because a lot of the fights are from the villains perspective.</br>  <br>sykthewood's blog, the mega or the googledrive.</br>  Can someone tell me if the color palette on the picture is actually correct?<br><br>This looks way too red for my tastes.</br></br>  <br> with good characters  <br> no useless bullshit masturbatory writing <br>That's literally enough to make a world of difference.</br></br></br>  <br>Here's another picture for comparison.</br>  <br>Well yeah that's why I really love it anyway.<br><br><br>Great, thanks.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What's that red orb Ainz has below his ribcage?<br><br>It's not his fucking phylactery is it? What kind of Lich carries his phylactery on him, rather than buried in an admantium chamber buried ten miles beneath the surface of the earth, surrounded by magma.and guarded by the most powerful (and utterly mindless) guardians possible?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you talking about that one  lich? </br>  Why did spoopy skeleton let soldiers die if he was going to kick theocracy ass anyway  <br>Because he doesn't really care.</br>  <br>He's not dead<br>...right?</br></br>  <br> He wasn't going to do shit till they said they were going to kill the villagers. Pay attention.</br>  <br>I meant the random nameless soldiers</br>  <br>What it is hasn't been mentioned as of vol 5. It seems unlikely liches even had phylacteries in Yggdrasil.</br>  <br><br>Why do you have the need to see anime with bullshit shounen fights?<br>Try thinking past the individual fights. it's not about IF he wins or loses, it's about HOW</br></br></br>  <br> What kind of Lich carries his phylactery on him, rather than buried in an admantium chamber buried ten miles beneath the surface of the earth, surrounded by magma.and guarded by the most powerful (and utterly mindless) guardians possible? <br><br>The ones that don't want to revive trapped into a adamantium chamber buried ten miles beneath the surface of the earth, surrounded by magma.and guarded by the most powerful (and utterly mindless) guardians possible?<br><br><br>Didn't you heard? Humans are like insects for him. Just those to which he talked are being upgraded to "small animal" status.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a World Class item.</br>  <br>In the LN he had more intrest keeping the villagers safe so he went and made sure they were safe before doing anything else.</br>  <br> forgetting overlord has one of the most bullshit shonen fights ever. </br>  <br>Oh. Literally who cares?<br><br><br>Of course, and? The way he defeated anything so far was excessively simple.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>These:<br><br><br>In that order.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He's a fucking Lich. By definition, he's a powerful spellcaster. If he can't even cast teleport, he shouldn't be a fucking Lich.</br></br>  Could someone make a .webm of Albedo freaking out because Ainz got damaged/  <br><br>Nigger, please, this is an anime about an all powerful skeleton and his Eldritch abomination pals putting humans in their place.<br><br>How can you not think that this is pretty motherfucking cool is beyond me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>lol</br>  <br> What's that red orb Ainz has below his ribcage? <br>same this that  skullgreymon  got</br></br>  <br><br>I got a boner while reading it.</br></br>  <br>Thank you anon for telling me which answers were real.</br>  <br>If you place your phylactery in a location where everyone who can teleport can go you could just as well take it with you, at least it would be under your eyes and there wouldn't be an adamantium chamber to protect any teleporting invader from the lava and the guardians.</br>  <br>Is that a later vol spoiler? I can't recall him mentioning anything about that orb at all.</br>  So which do you prefer /a/?<br><br>Playing as a powerful evil overlord from the get-go, or playing as a an inexperienced adventurer with no insta-win abilities but becoming a legendary figure through hard work, wit and effort?</br></br>  <br>Well, considering the Death Knight scene showed decapitation and some other cool junk, we might get a watered-down hug scene at the very least.</br>  <br>See this is what I don't get. Did Ains suddenly lose all empathy and whatnot, and if so, is this something that will be addressed later?</br>  <br>Do I have to be evil?</br>  <br>I never said it wasn't fucking COOL as fuck nigger.<br>It just need more opposition to make things more interesting on top of the COOL<br>And it apparently will, so it's great news</br></br></br>  <br>I want to start as a no-body weakass warrior who becomes a powerful allmighty lich later.</br>  <br><br>Why would you tell anyone about the location? Why wouldn't you place an artifact in there that prevents inward teleportation but allows outward? Think, anon.</br></br>   Lv1 D&amp;D spells <br>I fucking love this show.<br><br>What race was Touch Me, btw?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Is that some Quest for Glory?<br><br>Because holy shit that might be the best game series ever made.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Did Ains suddenly lose all empathy <br>Why do people keep asking this? He literally says that is what happened to him. Are you people even reading or are you just looking at the pretty pictures?</br></br>  <br><br>Dragonkin with a human base form.<br><br>Basically the same as Sebas.<br><br><br><br>Fucking hell, is that Quest for Glory? I haven't played that in years,<br><br>Wizard Best Class.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dragonkin.</br>  <br>Hasn't been revealed yet as of vol 5</br>  <br>It was mentioned in the web novel versions of the events in Vol 7.<br> In the WN the priest thinks the red orb is Ainz's weak point and tries punching it, does nothing, then Ainz goes on a long explanation about what the orb is and how it's not an actual weak point, etc, etc. </br></br>  <br>Dragonkin, as far as I know.</br>  <br> Why would you tell anyone about the location? <br>Scrying nigger<br> Why wouldn't you place an artifact in there that prevents inward teleportation but allows outward? <br>Then how would you get there in the first place?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Everyone creates a cool NPC. <br> Touch Me makes himself as an NPC <br><br>Why?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br> Because fuck you, he's Touch Me.</br>  <br>The man was a extreme paladin.</br>  <br>Because nobody could think of anything cooler.</br>  <br>In the novel is more evidenced, but even in the anime he already said that being in a Lich bodies is influencing him, and that he found disconcerting the fact that could see the massacre without feeling anything. <br><br><br>Yeah, just know that while this anime season is gonna end in one helluva fight   against the red knight in the opening   who is a mind controlled Shalltear    the true enemies aren't gonna appear still, and they work much more behing the scenes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dayum, Albedo going crazy is tasty.</br>  <br><br>Where's all this dragonkin stuff coming from? I don't think anything pertaining to Touch Me's race has ever been revealed.</br></br>  So does ainz ever meet the surviving member of the eight kings of greed?  <br>I haven't read the source material, is this an actual plot point which will be addressed later?</br>  <br> Wanting people to oppose Ains-sama <br> ''COOL'' </br></br>  You spawn on the New World as the last MMORPG character youve played as.  <br><br> not putting in an anti-scry spell <br><br>That's basic shit.<br><br> spend a few years reading a book while Thralls build a chamber around you <br> then TP out <br><br>Honestly, the magma is just for the atmosphere. Any character past lvl 20 can fucking swim through that shit with the right gear. It's just to keep out the plebs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Motherfucker he says it in the anime pay attention.</br>  <br> Elin buttslut priest <br>Yes please.</br></br>  <br> level 60 White Mage <br>Oh boy, time for EXPERIMENTS</br></br>  <br>What does he say it is? I'd like to know the long explanation.</br>  <br>What do you do if someone finds out about it and gets there ahead of you? What do you do if someone just wishes to know where it is?</br>  <br> I would be a human warlock who looks as if he was in his 70s. Cool.</br>  <br> orc enhancement shaman with the herod axe <br><br>I will spin till the world ends</br></br></br>  <br><br>Male Human Warlock.<br><br>Summon my succubus, have sex, move on to setting up a mountainside retreat where I can advise future heroes on how to do shit and shape the course of history over centuries without actually doing anything.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather be one of the Guardians.</br>  <br> Duke Nukem knockoff <br><br>Okay. Time to chew ass.</br></br></br>  <br> Capped RO Ranger  <br>Life is good.</br></br>  Reading ahead of the releases.<br> Evileye, stop being cute. This will only end poorly for you. I don't care if you're okay with the idea of him having one or two concubines. Stop. </br>  aots by far  <br>An unreliable narrator making an off-hand statement does not seem like the end all be all of a MAJOR character development.</br>  <br> Never played a MMO <br>Welp.</br></br>  <br> my level 40ish fem TERA goat demon <br>The hell did I do to deserve this?</br></br>  <br> Summon my succubus, have sex <br> You are dead.</br></br>  <br>level 90 mithra from ffxi. At least I could do everything and have yagrush I guess. Being a catgirl could be interesting.</br>  <br>The only MMO I ever played was Tera for like 10h in the course of a week, a friend asked me to help since he needed an extra healer<br>so I guess Im a lvl 20 elin healer</br></br>  <br> Something about how it's an item that costs levels to use (doesn't actually specify what it does), and that it was used to deliver the finishing blow to the all the people that invaded Nazarick's 8th floor. </br>  <br>Finally a girl who isn't Ainz "child", maybe she'll win the Ainzbowl.</br>  <br>He literally says he didn't feel bad about watching people die and killing people or feel much strong emotion in general. He just doesn't care that much about it because being a lich affects his mind.</br>  <br>It is so very satisfying because for once the cunt gets what she deserves.</br>  <br>Christ dude</br>  <br><br>Not in WoW. Warlock Succubi are literally all Albedo.</br></br>  <br>And thats leaving out the bit about not getting a boner.</br>  <br> female mage that teleports all the time and kills enemies by snaping <br>YES</br></br>  <br><br>Well shit, I'll swim in pussy in no time</br></br>  <br>Considering players could customize almost every aspect of their characters, I'd say it's there cause Ainz thinks it looks cool.</br>  <br><br>They'll probably just be puking blood to a cut away with squishing sfx. Doesn't mean I'm not very looking forward to seeing how it plays out though. It definitely wont be as detailed as the novel though.</br></br>  <br>My old RuneScape character. Great, just when I thought I forgot about that time sink of a game.</br>  <br> lv 3  <br>You'll be dead in no time.</br></br>  <br>souce, looks cool.</br>  <br>He has no libido, so he's never getting laid.</br>  <br>I want to serve underneath a powerful lich.</br>  <br>Its a hover device. Becoming a semidemilich caused his legs to crumble into dust,</br>  <br>What I am asking is if this will be a running plot point in the series. <br><br>It seems to have been completely forgotten in EP4.</br></br></br>  <br>Beginning Reality mmo.</br>  <br>Is it final fantasy?</br>  <br>Does destiny count?</br>  <br>How is it forgotten? It's not addressed because there hasn't been a change. He states at the start of the episode he likens the h7umans to small animals at least. Which is an improvement from seeing them as insects. <br><br>Yes, FF14</br></br></br>  <br>Pathfinder 20th level Skald. Time to get people to LISTEN TO MY SONGS.</br>  <br>This was a pretty good chapter. Is Ains like this in the LNs?<br><br>I usually avoid them because they're terribly written, is Overlord LN better than most?</br></br></br>  <br>Did you miss where he called humans insects and later upgraded a few to small animals? Why would he talk about it? He doesn't care much.</br>  <br><br><br>Yes, FFXIV. There's a 15 day free trial on Steam.<br><br>I played it for about 3 days and decided not to buy due how dull it was, subs and paying for the expansion (You have to buy the game, the expansion and pay for subs).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> last mmorpg <br> eve online <br>well this should be easy</br></br></br>  <br>My Lyn Blade Master<br>Time to spin</br></br>  <br>Lvl 75 Caseal Ranger. Do robots have sex drives?</br>  <br>Unlimited spawning toys. The great thing about being an unnamed NPC.</br>  <br>Do you spawn with your ship though?</br>  <br><br>I guess I am just wishing there was more introspection.</br></br>  <br> Mid level undead warrior with whirlwind axe <br><br>I hope I can still climb the ladder</br></br></br>  <br>I'd immediately proceed to fuck a lot of girls.<br>Even as a girl.</br></br>  <br> It seems to have been completely forgotten in EP4. <br><br>Sure Buddy</br></br></br>  Now that I think about it shaltear is the only one (non lizard) it ever mentions having sex isn't she? At least someone gets action.  <br>More like ROKU RYU SEN</br>  <br><br>you see hes been saying this in presence of his subordinates so its hard to tell if its just him playing the part or not</br></br>  <br> level 70 Tauren Hunter with stats in all the wrong places and shit gear <br>goddamn it</br></br>  <br>Four reasons, <br>1. He doesn't give a shit about the soldiers <br>2. Didn't really feel the need to get involved in the fighting between other nations<br>3. Was more interested in protecting the villagers, his new source of information<br>4. He didn't want to jump in a fight unless he knew he could win. <br>After seeing Gazef fight them though, he realized #4 wasn't even an issue though, then he heard they were planning to kill the villagers which interfered with #3. At that point though, the soldiers were already dead, so #1 was pointless. So he decided #3 was more important than #2.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> the last MMO I played was Tibia more than 5 years ago <br> level 150 Royal Paladin, with my Backpack filled with Assassin Stars and Infernal Bolts <br><br>Hahaha, headshots everywhere.</br></br></br></br></br>  On a recent /v/ thread, someone asked which game you can play as a lich. Nobody there mentioned "Might and Magic 8", but that is the only RPG I've ever known that lets you:<br><br>1/ Start as a mage<br>2/ Join a necromancer guild<br>3/ Complete a long line of quest in order to turn yourself into a lich<br><br>You can also play as a fire-breathing, non-armor-wearing dragon, but that's just icing on the cake.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I dont think there's a cooler MC this season than mr skeltal  <br>There is here and there but in general why bother think about something you dont care about?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Touch Me's actual race is unknown as of yet. Everyone just assumes he's the same as Sebas since Touch Me made Sebas and both Touch Me and Sebas are "Good Justice Alignment". For all we know, Touch Me could be a doppelganger or a vampire or a slime under that suit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The armour is Touch Me </br>  This anime really makes me want to plunge myself back into MMOs but I know they're all shit.  <br>The left out the part where he apologizes to Albedo for wasting her special protection for a lowly Angel. But they kept the projectile part in at least. I hope people saw the after credit scene. Too bad we will never see Vol 7 animated.</br>  <br>in the end they're mindless grindfests, fun during the leveling part.<br>if only that could last forever..</br></br>  <br>They'll never not be shit, even the one in the anime is dead and clearly P2W</br>  <br>skythewood blog</br>  <br> You'll never play your first MMO again and have mindless fun not knowing what you were doing. </br>  <br> He has no libido, so the girls are never getting laid <br><br>ftfy</br></br></br>  <br>Damaged....yeah like 1 or 2 HP. Seriously it was like when Kirito was regenerating faster than he was taking damage but way more awesome since Ainz was doing EVIL SKELLY LAUGH. I just wish the BGM was more epic, it would be doubly better.</br>  <br>feels bad man</br>  <br> Elin BAMhunter/Crowd control archer build <br><br>I'm okay with this</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, I guess it's fine.</br></br>  <br> undead rogue in this set <br>i mis tbc</br></br>  <br>Looking past the nostalgia vision, common first MMOs such as Runescape and Vanilla WoW were seriously awful and only excusable because they came out 10+ years ago.</br>  <br>Shalltear does, just not with the bone.</br>  <br> with what? </br>  <br> mis <br>tfw making typos<br>im tired ;_;</br></br></br>  <br>Just waiting for virtual reality to become a thing. Even though I know it is going to be bad at least it will be a new experience.<br><br>True but those years held some of the fondest memories.</br></br></br>  Was it this guy ainz turns into a lich? I don't remember who it was.  <br>He kinda hinted at it very early in the beginning. When Ainz first mentioned about world class items that the guild got, he mentioned that since he was the guild leader, people in the guild agree that he should have one world class item in his possession, the first thing I thought of was the giant red ball in his Rib cage.</br>  <br>Fuck. I haven't played an MMO since WoW BC, I think it was a female Blood Elf mage. No idea what level she was, but far from the cap, so I'd be fucked.</br>  <br>I'd be a mnk/drg. Not what I would prefer but pretty good.</br>  <br> Tera Elin berserker  <br>God. Fucking.  Bless Tera </br></br>  What the fuck was up with Nigun's eyes?<br> Did he smoke magic crack or something?</br>  <br>Because it's not their usual moe shit nor as edgy as it could be, nor their usual pretentious pandering insertbuzzwordshere Monogatari-esque show, but something else, not too cliched but digestible enough while being creative.<br><br>Therefore it's good, therefore, to "them" it's shit.

Not when he was hiding so much, not when their circumstances were so different. <br> So once she's accepted into the tomb, Sebas has no reason not to accept her right? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Second to Cocytus anon.</br>   ***,156 / ***, # 150 (***, 725 pt) [*, * 40 Reservation 2015/09/25 [Amazon.co.jp limited] overload 1 (whole volume purchase bonus: "anime illustrations drawn use benefits novel storage BOX" with exchange serial code) [Blu-ray] <br> (***, 283 pt) [*, ** 3 Reserved] 2015/09/25 Overload 1 [Blu-ray] <br> (***, * 78 pt) [*, ** 2 Reserved] 2015/09/25 Overload 1 [DVD] <br> 1086 total. </br></br></br>  <br>dragons ball so hard bitches want to find them</br>  <br><br>is dat good?</br></br>  <br>The only one with any hope is  Landfall. <br><br>She isn't a human, and she can't be daughter-zoned by Ainz.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't understand this.

I intend to level a tank class so I can switch roles to whatever is needed, but if I'm going in as I am now then the above listed classes are all I have.

Shit! I did let Simmering Teapot’s kids saw that kind of scene— Eh, it should be fine. Ignoring Albedo, Demiurge… will probably explain it from a medical angle… That will be the back up plan. Shalltear… she seemed to be fine. Anyway, I will remember this as an issue to be resolved later. <br><br>Ainz disagrees.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sith Sorcerer?<br><br>I haven't played an MMO in years, too bad The Old Republic was such a bust due to EA being as inept as usual.</br></br></br>  <br> Playing as a powerful evil overlord from the get-go, or playing as a an inexperienced adventurer with no insta-win abilities but becoming a legendary figure through hard work, wit and effort? <br>The latter is more satisfying. Sadly only few RPGs make you feel really powerful at the end. Few games besides the Baldur's Gate series do a comparably good job at it.</br></br>  <br>They are 76 years old.....</br>  <br>In elf-years.

One chapter translated per week.<br><br>Read it, it's worth it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Vol 5 chapter 3.</br>  <br>Eh, I'd rather have willing companions than slaves.</br>  <br>And how many volumes are there, or is it still ongoing?</br>  Is the web novel translated as well?  <br>The don't want them. They also don't have anything to buy since everything in the tomb is free anyway.</br>    <br> everything is free <br><br>That seems horribly inefficient.</br></br></br>    <br>In what way.</br>  <br>In that it's burning guild funds.</br>    <br>9 volumes published so far. Still ongoing I believe. <br><br>By the way, the manga stops about 70% of the way through volume 2 of the novels, by the way.</br></br></br>  <br>Most stuff is auto generated.</br>  <br>I might just pick the LN up.</br>    <br>Their wages are guild funds, so how is paying them a wage saving you any money?</br>  <br>For the price of 5 levels, your heart's desires can be achieved. And bbarring that, there's always Ouroboros.</br>  For some reason I REALLY like this scene right here.  <br> Aura forces Mare to take baths with her and then abuses him under the guise of washing him thoroughly <br><br>fuck the femdom doujins write themselves.</br></br></br>  KONO BEE CHI  <br>Well, now they're getting paid in Ainz Land Fun Bucks. So it's all good.</br>  <br><br>He then ponders about creating "Ainz-bucks" so the NPCs can use them to get things they want inside Nazarik, then he realized that everyone is just going to want to pay to have his bone.</br></br>  <br>What about the NWN series?</br>  <br>I loved it too, when I first read it in the manga.<br><br>It's cause of the power it conveys. He no-sells their attacks then questions them about where they learned their magic, like he isn't in the middle of fighting them. And the way he asks has this impression that he's much older and more powerful, and surprised that such weak children know magic. <br><br>it's intimidating as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  What MMO would you say this show is most like?  <br>Lineage2</br>  <br>DDO? They both have D&amp;D spells with mana instead of the per day system. Not sure about the level progression though.</br>   Just started watching <br> Liking the harem so far <br> But you know what would be great... <br> Get to episode 2 <br> See this <br><br>It just keeps getting better.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That would be true if they were selfishly pursuing their own goals.<br><br>But in this communistic paradise everybody eagerly dedicates themselves to the glory and happiness of Ainz-chairman<br><br>Surely you're not implying that there is joy outside of ainz, Anon comrade?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can become really powerful in NWN, especially Hordes of the Underdark, but also NWN2 with Mask of the Betrayer, which are both epic level campaigns, but for some reason it never quite feels so in my opinion. Maybe to a certain extent in MotB, due to the Spirit Eater powers, but it's lacking the grand and literally epic scale of Baldur's Gate, which is lengthy enough to make your journey and character growth believable, and also makes you truly savour the moment where you become really powerful - especially as a spell caster, where you can do all kinds of cool things.</br>  <br> She "conveniently" slips a little bit while washing with lots of soap and falls right on his penis <br> Makes him lay there in the bath like a good boy while she investigates these new feelings </br></br>  <br>It's a trade off. They scale the enemies to match the player so the game play is still engaging and marginally difficult the whole way through, instead of becoming face-roll easy at the end (read: TRY to do this, they don't always succeed). <br><br>The downside to this is, as you noted, makes it feel like the player is just treading water not getting more powerful. MMORPGs get around this problem via level perks. You lock good game features behind level requirements and it gives people a tangible goal plus a visible sign of progress, even if it doesn't translate at all to actual gameplay. <br><br>A few people realize it's hollow rewards and become disillusioned with the game, but most people only need the slightest encouragement to continue playing if they have friends in the game. The fact that each of those friends probably only bothers because his friends play makes it a veritable house of cards, a single person dropping out could cause an entire cluster of people to stop playing, so the little incentives are necessary to keep people hooked.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> harem </br></br>  <br>It seems more like D&amp;D than an MMO to me. In MMOs spellcasters are really boring and the systems are pretty generic due to balancing.</br>  <br>Its not gay if its an elf. Everyone can feel relieved now.</br>  <br> Still feeling conflicted about it <br><br>I gave up on that a long time ago.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Anon, stop...<br><br>I'm getting a  boner .</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think MMOs do a particularly good job at the whole role playing thing in general. You can't tell epic stories with thousands of Frodos venturing to Mt. Doom. It always ends up bland and boring because the individual player can't stick out too much.</br>  <br> last thing I played was ArcheAge months ago <br><br>goddamnit I'm a magical korean pirate</br></br></br>  <br>The spells are lifted straight from D&amp;D in some cases, and I can't see some of them having any use at all in a typical MMO. <br><br>Also some of the spells clearly only work for roleplay purposes or specific quests and you'd never see a spell like them in a real MMO (like the mind-wiping spell Ainz mentions).</br></br></br>  <br>NWN had a really nice thing going for it, particularly HotU. Come to think of it my first playthrough of that was actually as a blackguard overlord type character with a living greatsword. MotB was neat as well, and really got extreme when you decided to just go full spirit eater. In general the evil endings ended up making you much more powerful than the good or neutral ones where you'd just end up wandering the world looking for adventure or fucking dying next to your ghost waifu.<br><br>NWN1 had the online worlds too, which would let you become pretty damn powerful depending on the server. Some would allow players to own housing too, so there was that as well. Shame it looks like we'll never get another game like it. It's always static single player campaigns with mediocre modding and player made content.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget, they probably have no orgasm control Aura is definitely taking that first load inside.</br>  <br>Isn't that super dead now? /vg/ doesn't even have a general for it anymore.</br>  So if Ainz meets any Yggdrasil players out by their lonesome, is he going to invite them to Nazarick?  <br>I have a feeling Ainz is going to betray her and she will die in absolute despair as Entoma eats her starting with her larynx.</br>  Spoil me, LNfags. Does Ainz ever find any other players?  <br>Probably<br><br>I got to max level stole some shit then uninstalled because doing anything but combat was impossible without spending dosh.</br></br></br>  <br>I doubt, he would probably end killing him or not doing anything at all out of paranoia.</br>  <br>Yes anon. Read the Novels to find out.</br>  <br>Maybe mind-wipe would temporaly erase some ability from the target in the MMO.</br>  <br>As hyper-paranoid as he is I doubt he would without some thorough background checking. And even the I suspect he doesn't really want to associate with any players other than his friends.</br>  <br>Yes this is something I realized a while ago. MMOs first and foremost are social games. If you want a story that lets YOU feel powerful and special, playing a game built around working with others isn't your best bet. <br><br>That's why at the start of Overlord, it was an MMO where Momonga wasn't really that strong of a guy, despite being level 100. His character was built for roleplay, and he rolled with a really strong guild. He himself wasn't famous except for being a part of that super famous guild. If he wasn't the leader of Ains Ooal Gown he'd be nothing but a roleplaying skeleton probably.<br><br>But then he genre shifts and comes to a new world, and it's effectively a single player RPG now. Only he started beyond max level with godlike power.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ainz might be extremely evil, but I don't foresee him betraying anyone just to please his underlings. Unless they threaten Nazarick of course.</br>  <br> ArcheAge <br><br>An utter failure of a game.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much. I only check in once a day because I own some land that my guild can use and am their alchemy and printing provider. If my guild disbanded I could quit for good no regrets. Server merges in a few months though, which means everyone loses their lands and have to go land-grabbing. I'll definitely be free when that happens.<br><br>Real shame. Showed promise. Had stuff like guild-building, the whole crafting thing, trade-runs, owning land and guild politics. I'm not even sure what killed it or why I lost interest. Another game with features like it but better would be nice.</br></br></br>  Does anyone know if there are HQ raws for the chapter 1 of the manga?  <br>A lot of them would be at home in Everquest.<br><br>Everquest actually has some of the class stuff as well, since once you hit 50 in EQ your class names started changing every few level.</br></br></br>  I want to protect this smile.  <br>He was actually mid of the top tier, in his word, only because of his excellent equipment though. Your point still stands, I do wish that Ainz eventually find a even foil just because I want to see him and the npcs actually trying.</br>  <br>Yes, it is. He progressively gets further and further from being human/being 'himself' and it causes him a lot of mental stress.</br>  <br>I want that smile to protect me.</br>  <br> NWN had a really nice thing going for it, particularly HotU. Come to think of it my first playthrough of that was actually as a blackguard overlord type character with a living greatsword. MotB was neat as well, and really got extreme when you decided to just go full spirit eater. In general the evil endings ended up making you much more powerful than the good or neutral ones where you'd just end up wandering the world looking for adventure or fucking dying next to your ghost waifu. <br>I would argue that due to the encounters being so boring the player never truly got to fully savour his powers. Also I think the 3D engine somehow made everything look kinda same-ish. Within the plot the player got to do some cool things, e.g. devour the souls of important NPCs (even companion's and a god's, assuming he made the right decisions), but within the game itself things weren't that great.<br><br>Maybe it's just me, but in Baldur's Gate 2, things just feel more powerful. e.g. casting a reflected image of yourself to have access to twice as many spells, immunising the image to dispels, wearing items such as the Robe of Vecna to get faster cast time, stopping time, barraging the whole room with horrid wilting or so many magic missiles that even a modern computer begins to struggle, ... things like that were simply lacking in later games.<br><br>Gothic is another game where the player can do some cool things, such as the Wave of Death spell (which allows you to murder entire cities if cast at the right spot), assuming the player studied under Xardas the Necromancer in the first game. Or the Army of Darkness spell to summon a fuckload of skeletons.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He had to try to conquer his Chair at least.<br><br>That was an extremely engaging battle.<br><br>I also liked how they did volume 4, where you really end up rooting as much for the Lizards as you do for the Nazarick army.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Albedo a cute.</br>  <br>This anon really understands.</br>  <br>I've heard there's a bath scene with him.

What  not dead  MMO allows me to do this?  <br>Yeah he's already shown that his RP job "overlord" has some unexpected perks in this new world. The fact he's so used to playing the role of the evil lich ruler of Nazarick has let him fit into the role of Supreme Being pretty easily despite him flying by the seat of his pants too.</br>  <br>none of them</br>  <br> lvl 85Hunter <br><br>I miss BC so much</br></br></br>  <br>What is that?</br>  <br>Age of conan allowed you to be Mr.Bones and chill in a brothel, but dat game's ded</br>  <br>Well then how about just the skeleton lord thing and I'll use my imagination for the other parts?

Tear can be two different words, so it's confusion.  I lost interest halfway through Volume 2, but I keep watching anyway solely because of who voices Albedo.  <br>MMOs don't really allow you to stick out as a character. There are thousands of characters who all look like you and have the same abilities. They're also designed to take a fuckload of time to make you pay subscription fees. If you're looking to live out a power fantasy, you're better off with a single player RPG.</br>  <br>At best I think we'll get a writhing silhouette with some squealing + Blood/spit + some agonized eye-movements.

You could literally be untouchable once you get enough defensive spells if you really felt like putting in the effort and do crazy things like cast all your low level spells in the span of a few seconds.l. But yea, it's a shame you can't get great effects like Time Stop or Improved Alacrity style spells anymore. It felt like you had way more freedom in BG when it came to spellcasting.</br>  <br><br>Yumi Hara is love.</br></br>  <br> Forsaken <br> "misunderstood" <br><br>Most of them are evil as hell and got more and more blatant about it as time went on.</br></br></br></br>  So does anyone else watch secondaries review the episodes and laugh at their theories of the series?  <br><br> fantasy macroeconomics <br>Oh man, haven't been able to enjoy that since Spice and Wolf, time to pick up the LNs.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. It's kind of refreshing to be honest. We're too deep to give opinions on it really.</br>  <br>Easily.</br>  God, I want to play a game similar to YGG. Anyone here play Life is Feudal? If so, how is it?  <br>Well shit, there go my hopes her survival. I guess Entoma will be enjoying some fine dining in the near future.</br>  <br>There's very little amount of fantasy macroeconomics or economics in general in Overlord.</br>  <br>Do it. It's really neat. Doesn't actually add that much once you're done since lich mode has nothing to really offer that you might not already have, and nobody ever treats you differently for being an unliving abomination and general insult to everything arkay stands for, but it's a neat little goal to set yourselves while playing a low to mid-high level necrobro.<br><br>It's a shame this game is overall garbage though. I need a good game with the modding capacity and community as the elder scrolls series that won't be a horribly buggy unoptimized overall flawed mess.</br></br></br>  <br>I know, I kept going back only to resub for a month, max my level and be gone again.<br><br>Cata killed it for real</br></br></br>  <br>I'm just waiting for someone to accidentally make full AI and put that in charge of a game since otherwise we will never get real secret classes.</br>  <br> Well, wizard spellcasting in Baldur's Gate was broken depending on how much cheese you felt like employing and still really powerful without it. You could literally be untouchable once you get enough defensive spells if you really felt like putting in the effort and do crazy things like cast all your low level spells in the span of a few seconds. <br>Exactly. And I don't see a problem with that. In a single player RPG things don't need to be balanced, since you're not competing with everyone. In D&amp;D, Wizards are usually extremely powerful past a certain point and this is one of the few games which did the whole thing justice.<br><br> But yea, it's a shame you can't get great effects like Time Stop or Improved Alacrity style spells anymore. It felt like you had way more freedom in BG when it came to spellcasting. <br>Yes. In most contemporary games things are too balanced, and too "generic", with every spell falling in a certain category, getting rid of the more "flavour" type spells which may end up redundant, but at the same time taking all the experimentation away from the player, to find out on his own which spells are useful and which aren't, perhaps finding new usage to a previously thought useless spell, which under certain conditions turns out useful after all, etc. with mages being human artillery rather than toolboxes with all kinds of spells at their disposal, forcing the player to find the right one for the right opportunity.<br><br>tl;dr - developers need to stop being afraid of having things turn out broken and let the players experiment, potentially breaking the game in the process and living out their retarded power fantasies.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh that's right. Life is Feudal is that game they were discussing putting AI peasants or some shit in. That sounded pretty interesting.</br>  <br>I think it's fun to drop hints here and there to see their reactions. In the previous thread a guy devolved into gibberish when I put up a Sharknado picture when talking about the  Shalltear fight , it was absolutely adorable.</br>  <br>Eh, I'll still pick it up, from the sound of it the LNs are quite worthwhile.</br>  <br>I like this idea.</br>  <br>Just so you don't end up disappointed, there isn't really any, if you're thinking of S&amp;W type stuff. I enjoy the 30-35% of it that is Papa Bones being a crafty motherfucker and I am quite bored by the 60+% of it that's just the NPCs of Nazarick reinforcing their character tropes ( let's be honest, it's gary stu / harem stuff with a bit of spice ). Whatever's left is the npcs actually being interesting.

It's not a joke filename. It's just room 101 actually being empty.</br>  <br>I like this meme.</br>  <br>Guess they are saving the trip for the next ova  or season 3 .</br>  This past episode was just perfect. The teru teru bozu arc was absolutely hilarious and the Flatty-san arc was simply beautiful, from its mono no aware to its heartwarming climax illustrating the innocent, youthful realization of the miracle of life. The climax in particular, the way it was directed with the music and the interspersed shots of nature and the cycle of life... just fucking stunning. Why is this so AOTY?  <br>This episode demonstrated the transient beauty of life in a way I haven't seen since YKK.</br>  <br>Terrible.</br>  <br>I will always remember this scene as the exact moment she became my waifu.</br>  <br>Didn't you see her sniffle and wipe her eyes?</br>  Is there going to be a season 3?   Next episode will be an anime original featuring school pool <br><br>Besides being surprised that the school actually has one, does this mean we will see Hotaru in a school swimsuit  and more Koma-chan misery? </br></br>  <br>I sure hope so. I'm just about ready to move this show into the 1a/1b slot of GOAT SoLs along with ARIA. One more episode this season the quality of S1E04, S1E10 or S2E04 and that should do it.</br>  why isn't Komari wearing her sukumizu?  <br>They appeared fully clothed, not even in swimsuits, while in the pool in the preview.<br> Thank God. The last thing we need is these threads next week circlejerking over middle and elementary schoolers in swimsuits. </br></br>  <br>Since you seem to favour the Renge episodes, what did you think of the OVA? I thought that was around the same level of quality and high amount of Renge-focused introspection.</br>  <br>This hitted me hard, since my dog is sick and getting surgery tomorrow.</br>  <br><br>Well, we technically had that when S1 aired didn't it?</br></br>  <br> S1E10 <br>That episode was magical.</br></br>  <br>I have no mouth and I must scream.</br>  <br>I love every NNB episode and loved the OVA but I'm not sure the OVA lives up to those three episodes I mentioned. I may be biased because the OVA was &lt;720p. <br>I feel that Renge is the show's most unique, entertaining character by a good margin. I don't think those episodes are the best episodes because they're Renge episodes, though. I think it's more that the writing and directing of this show really seem to excel when they're focusing on heartwarming moments and they seem to focus these heartwarming moments around Renge.</br></br>  <br>only if they cry from below.</br>  <br>Good answer. I guess you can't just say all the episodes are great but I agree with what you're saying. I personally find the Natsumi/Komari sisterhood moments to be some of the best heartwarming stuff too, but it might also be a personal bias owing to it reminds me of how me and my sister were as kids. But just the understated thoughtful moments are the best, like when they run away and Natsumi sees that a cat stole food from them to feed her kittens, and that's what finally makes her think "we should go home."<br><br>I hope for more Natsumi/Komari stuff this season, at least one or two episodes.</br></br></br>  Best girl. She'll become a great mother and wife.  <br> She'll become a great mother <br>Will probably need C-section.</br></br>  <br><br>That's not Koma-chan</br></br>  <br> giving birth to children is only something 7 feet tall giantesses can do <br><br>No, anon. No.</br></br></br>  Holy FUCK this show looks depressing. I've never watched this but is this the show's selling point?  <br>Komari is the one who needs a C-section and a 7th-month delivery, Natsumi will be fine.</br>  <br>People will claim otherwise but all the depressing episodes are also the most popular ones.</br>  <br>What a depressing edit.</br>  <br>She was always best girl. If you rewatch S1 and pay attention you will notice that Natsumi is usually very aware of social situations and the feelings of the people around her and acts accordingly. More often than any other character she does small things and gestures that makes others feel good about themselves and have fun. This episode was just the most obvious example.</br>  <br>This post contain so much truth</br>  <br> entire anime original episode <br><br>Does the school really have a pool in the manga?</br></br></br>  <br> the temptation of the shovel <br>She's so used to digging graves for Vietnamese children that it's become a reflex.</br></br>  <br> crop her shop her <br>CROP HER SHOP HER DROP HER TOP HER BOP HER COP HER MOP HER HOP HER</br></br>  <br>Give me templates.</br>  <br> Tfw the only time we see Renge smiling is when she's wearing a mask she made herself <br>This shit is too heavy for me.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I don't understand but I like it.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br><br>I thought that was Koma.

This means that any HS 720p files are downscaled by Funi or CR. This means that, in most cases, any HS 720p files are downscales of upscales. In Funi's case, the downscaler they use is terrible.

I wasn't kidding about the lineart that Sentai fucked up on the HS release.<br>http://screenshotcomparison.com/com<wbr>parison/134114<br>I haven't experienced Vivid's subs for this show as I can't wait for their releases as this is literally tied for my favorite show ever now, but Vivid's release is the best in terms of video quality despite losing about vertical pixels of resolution because it lacks source defects that the HS releases have, especially the fucked up lineart.</br></wbr></br></br>  <br><br> lawsuit <br> ip <br> public tracker <br><br>How about not living in a retarded country?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Torrenting was not involved.<br> implying putting your IP on a private tracker is safe </br></br>  <br>how's life in donbass?</br>  <br>How many rotten VC ears did she keep hidden in the closet?</br>  <br>Yes we know whay XDCC is.<br>Thing is nobody fucking cares because you downloaded a few shitty animes.</br></br>  <br>I'm Amerifat and I cannot argue with this post.</br>  <br><br>FTP or DC?</br></br>  <br>My little klansmen can't possibly be this cute</br>  <br> Jordan? </br>  <br>That difference is small enough for me not to care about it, seems like it'd be impossible to notice in motion without A/B testing it.<br><br>Thanks for the comparison though.</br></br></br>  <br> how the fuck do you know my name? </br>  <br>They're coming to get you Jordan.</br>  So guys <br>Which is better ARIA or Non non biyori<br>I personally prefer ARIA, akari is best girl</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I don't notice it in motion, but I mention it anyways because some people are really autistic about this sort of thing and I'm just trying to be helpful about it.</br>  <br>I'm coming around to accepting NNB as ARIA's equal, anon. This past episode helped a lot. It was as well-done as anything in The Origination.<br>Akari is amazing. I think Renge is equally amazing as a character.</br></br>  <br>Aria is better but NNB has it's own appeal aswell</br>  <br>They are both worse than gochusa and kinmosa</br>  <br>NNB isn't finished, will have half the episodes, and won't be able to conclude like Aria did.</br>  Wait, what? Hotarun arrived again? What it's going on?  <br> kinmosa <br><br>I disagree, NNB and ARIA have struck me more heavily and more emotionally than that gay shit ever will.<br>It is not comparable.</br></br></br></br>  <br> and won't be able to conclude like Aria did. <br>In terms of literal method or quality? If quality, there's a hell of an assumption, as it's a hell of an assumption to assume that this season will be the last season of the show.<br>I think if you go back and rewatch the first 17 episodes of ARIA and NNB, you'll find that NNB, in this case, is quite a bit better.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Flashbacks and/or timetravel. Possibly drugs.</br></br>  What's wrong with Vivid? "memes" is not an answer, I'd like tangible replies and examples.  <br>And none of those will be remembered in the next 5 years<br>Aria is start in 2007, it's been 8 years and it's still regarded as one of the best iyashikei<br>I can see people will talk about NNB in the next 5 years<br>I'm not even sure if you're baiting</br></br></br></br>  <br>NNB isn't very emotional though. It's comfy and healing, same as kinmosa and gochusa. (Those those 2 have more comedy and less comfort)</br>  <br>I've been disappointed far too many times to believe that anything will get a complete adaptation.</br>  <br>I have Hidamari Sketch as my all time heavyweight champion of SoLs, but Aria and NNB are also good, as are all SoLs. I don't think we should enter into a heated discussion about which one is best, but simply enjoy them in our own way.</br>  <br>S1 certainly sold like hotcakes. I expect a sales boost from this past episode as well. I know it wasn't just me and this ANN reviewer talked about in another thread right now who thought this past episode was extremely special.</br>  <br>Not him but im curently re-watching all three sesason of ARIA, it's still as enjoyable and as relaxing as the first time i watching it<br>NNB has it own charm but ARIA is still the best in the last decade</br></br>  <br>I think the main advantage ARIA has is the soundtrack. I love them both so much.</br>   "Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until their death. I shall take no cycle ride, hold no flute, father no shrimps. I shall wear no twin tails and win no test. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the tank. I am the shield that guards the realms of tadpole shrimps. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come."   <br>Kinmosa and Gochiusa might actually be talked about 5-10 years from now as SoL trendsetters. They've practically carved out a new subgenre for themselves, a subgenre with yuri as a primary draw and seemingly painstakingly engineered to be as hyper-cute as possible, even moreso than in the past of Japan's famously kawaii-obsessed culture.<br>I'm not saying they're great anime. They're cute so I like them but they're not great. Outside of their cuteness, and Karen, they're fairly average.</br></br>  <br>No, anon. Just no.</br>  Not gonna lie, this episode felt a bit forced, it was cute and all, but the funny part and the sad part both felt like they were trying too hard with the given situation respectively.<br><br>Even so, great episode, but is gonna be very difficult to top keitai or ruler warfare.</br></br>  <br>Terrible taste.</br>  <br> this episode felt a bit forced <br>It was pretty much the least forced-feeling drama I've seen in a long fucking time in anime. Opinions.</br></br>  <br>I liked the funny part, but yeah I agree the sad part felt a little forced.</br>  <br><br>They're the best, so of course trolls be trollan. Just check their releases for yourself and see the difference to the competition.</br></br>  <br>Well, yeah, if you gonna compare it to the rest of anime, it applies NNB as a whole.<br><br>For NNB standards this episode was jut a tad forced, but this is my opinion.</br></br></br>  <br> a little girl is sad because her pets died <br>yeah too forced better kill off Hotaru that is real drama</br></br>  <br>You know nothing Ren-chan.</br>  <br><br>How was it forced? It was a simple, plausible mono no aware story about how life is short but beautiful in its simultaneous transience and permanence.</br></br>  <br><br>That was the given situation, nothing forced about it, but the delivery felt a bit forced.<br><br>Notice how I use the word "feel", something about it that I can't quite put finger on.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw oniichan knows where to hide the body, needs not say a word </br>  <br>What was Hotaru's crime for her to be sent to the shacks?</br>  <br>I just learned that Tadpole Shrimp are shitty pets.

I'm working on Heavens Feel and I'm at the point where Kotomine is surgerizing her, but I have a question: Why does Sakura feel guilt towards Shirou? I mean she's the one that got raped, does she blame herself for being impure and wanting him, or what? Or am I thinking in the wrong context and she feels guilty because she kept her being a master from him?  <br>It's the latter of what you're thinking, the master thing</br>  Takeuchi's libido.

Prove me wrong.  <br>30% was Arc(normal) when she's using 70% of her power to suppress her blood-lust, 6% is after Shiki cuts her into little chunks iirc.</br>  The White Princess.

Shiki cutting her up decreased that remaining 30 to around 7 percent after having to stitch herself up again. Then as her arc proceeds, she loses even more energy trying to stop Shiki from getting killed by Roa Shiki.</br>  If there is a Type Moon, does that mean there is a Type for every moon of Jupiter and Saturn?    wouldn't Void Shiki be potentially stronger than Types?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Her face just says "Fuck with me.

Kind of a waste.<br><br>UBW Shirou does a lot more fighting.</br></br></br>  <br>Tohno can in fact kill servants.<br><br>When he killed Arcueid, 17 cuts landed in "an instant".<br>This is on the same level as 5th grail war Asassin's Tsubame Gaeshi. This is in fact canon. Not only that, but Arcueid was not able to notice she was being followed, nor feel any killing intent from Tohno until the blade already killed her. This is on the same level as assassin servant presence concealment.<br><br>In the official Tsukihime manga, Shiki was capable of slicing and killing lightning shot at him by Roa. A low estimate of the speed required for this would land at 96,000MPH, which is the atmospheric discharge of lightning at denser levels (closer to lower altitudes.)<br><br>Tying together presence concealment, Zelretch level ability (flash sheath), and A class speed, Shiki could in fact stand a chance against most servants. His trump card that would place him above anything summoned under assassin card would be that he essentially has an instant kill move if he ever gets near, making him a very deadly opponent.<br><br>To use concrete evidence of Shiki proving himself time and time again, we can look at who in fact he has killed.<br><br>Nrvnqsr Chaos the 10th apostle.

Tohno severed his connection to Akasha, erasing his existence.<br><br>It's good to take note here, that Servants are tied to the Akashic record in the throne of heroes, which is what allows them to be summoned in the first place. When Shiki kills a servant, they can no longer be summoned. Sounds like just the kind of person Archer was looking for.<br><br>In the "Talk" side story for Tsukihime, Tohno manged to kill the forest of Einnashe, the seventh dead apostle.

I assume its going to be a timeskip after a few chapters of setting up the school.  <br>What is paying attention to the story for $200</br>  <br>so you're not sure either?</br>  <br>We getting to important point from where manga started, so maybe 1-2 more chapters. Probably 3. After that it's hard to guess, since obviously Kazuya with unsealed memory is something else entirely. Maybe he will use amasogi instead of some new tsukumogami because of pic related.</br>  <br>wait so the black obi was originally kazuyan's tsukogami?  the plot and PLOT thicken </br>  Is kiriha still dead. Pretty sure thats the reason why I stopped reading this  <br>It was already stated that Kazuya created the black obi.
