[ 355 days to go  <br>Something's off but I can't put my finger on it.</br>    SZS anime will be coming out to celebrate the 7 years but I can't tell much info as of yet.    <br>Does your uncle work for Shaft?</br>  http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>14859<br>Naruto The Last Movie BD/DVD Torrent is out</br></wbr>  <br>Because the majority of people on /a/ came here in 2011-2014 when dub spamming Naruto threads were a thing.</br>  <br/>  <br>Why is char doing a wicked thing?</br>  <br>Wow, you actually linked to it? I was expecting boku no pico.</br>  <br> 1 seeder <br> 150 leechers </br></br>   You were born just in time for this miracle to be animated <br>Fuck exploring earth and space</br>  Is Fate as bad as /a/ makes it out to be?  <br>This anon speaks facts.</br>  <br><br>post more smokey rins</br></br>  <br>Encouraging shitposting is against the rules.</br>  <br>Rin owns two Shirous, every other heroine only has one Shirou. Rin is best confirmed.</br>  <br>They're both shit along with every other girl from the VN</br>  This watered down, censored butchering, is why the anime industry sucks so bad now days.<br><br>I can deal with 95% of the new animes every season consisting of moe/ecci/shounen/mild shounen-ai pandering for female otakus, usually devoid of any depth whatsoever. That is, if they didn't fucking tone down and censor the rest of the 5% that actually has some sort of interesting premise. Hell, why not turn the MC and his soldiers into fucking high-schoolers while you're at it... If you moeify, censor and remove any adult &amp; mature themes, you might as well adapt another fucking Light/Visual novel aimed at beta faggots. There are thousands of those out there, go make animes out of those instead of showing us this butchered crap.<br><br>Remove the gore, violence any sort, nudity or any sort of mature themes, and the series suddenly looses any appeal it had from the start. What's Berserk, Gungrave or say Black Lagoon without it's graphic violence and devoid of any mature and explicit content whatsoever? Fucking boring and pointless! Might as well watch swordshit moe online instead, because the difference is suddenly minimal.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If an adaptation is decent there's no point in praising it so no one touches the subject<br>himouto is airing right now and it's been excellent as an adaptation so far<br>monogatari series was fine too</br></br></br>  <br>They changed design for the sake of changing, same as with Kuribayashi and others. They could lower detailing and still stay close to original.</br>  <br><br>That is terrible. The anime version is far superior. <br><br>Overall I think the show is fun enough. It's not going to be AOTS, but it will be enjoyable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Spoken like a true pleb of shit tastes.</br>  <br>If they don't cut the Itallica scene then you'll get just that.</br>  yu-gi-oh!
