I wonder how many crimes you have unknowingly committed in the past.<br><br> probably none because even though 13 is considered loli by the laws standards, you still can't get none </br></br></br>  <br>my gf was 14 when we got together<br>and damn if you think 13y old girls can't look like this  you should get out of your room from time to time mate</br></br>  <br>Do you even know where the term "loli" comes from? Ever heard of Lolita?<br>You fucking plebs should just kill yourselves.</br></br>  <br>Lolita =! "loli" if we're talking anime. Lurk more instead of shoving your rotten knowledge into others' face. If we follow your logic then 95% of the girls in anime are lolis and we're all pedos? Also, never wondered why loli threads have to be hosted on /b/ and not /h/?<br> fucking pleb </br></br>  <br> 13 <br>I thought she was like 17. Holy shit.</br></br>  <br>sorry but I don't spend my time scopin out the 13y/o girls when I leave my house. <br><br> my gf was 14 when we got together <br>righttt anon admits to having a GF. what cartoon is she from?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Inuyasha is a flaming paedophile  <br><br>lel based Rumiko</br></br></br>  <br>  Kagome is into beastiality </br>  <br>Faggot spotted.</br>  <br>yep. 13 seems like a big number when you are at that age or younger. <br><br>I think I always knew just wasn't affected by the number because it was so long ago. now that i'm a lot older, it seems really overwhelming</br></br></br>  Doesn't have the body type of a loli, so it's not considered a loli.  <br>the correct term is hebephile</br>  <br><br><br> Loli <br> Having anything to do with age <br><br>Mcfucking kill yourselves</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She was 15 when the series started. Same age as Fuu though I expected both to be at least 17</br>  <br>you would know, pedo. <br>and being a hebephile is a catagory of pedephelia. <br><br>that's like saying being a lesbian doesn't make you gay</br></br></br></br>  <br>so does she not show ass till she turns 16?</br>    <br> that's like saying being a lesbian doesn't make you gay <br><br>Yeah, because 13&gt; are the same as &lt;13.<br>The two are not interchangeable simply because they are within the same category.<br><br>There is a huge difference in wanting to fuck a 7 year old and a 14/15 year old.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Basically yeah. No idea where this 13 years old stuff came from.</br>    <br>so are you trying to say lolism isn't associated with pedophelia?<br><br>because if so then that's not the case. you are still considered one or the other if you commit acts of pedophilia</br></br></br>  <br><br>Plenty of lolis would fall under hebe and other lolis would fall under pedo.<br>However a hebephile is considerably more natural than a pedophile, so natural even that a lot of countries have an AoC of 15 which is within the range of hebe.</br></br></br>  <br>We aren't talking about commiting any crimes here, we are talking about sexual attraction, which cannot be controlled and is perfectly natural.<br><br>Your brain doesn't automatically decide whether a girl is fuckable based on her age.

It's not unlimited.

She ain't perfect so there are things she can't do well, but she is the type that can get a hang of it after trying and learning. One of her flaws is that she is hot-headed though, so it takes time for her to come around. This will hold true in regards to her sword canon she wants to use. She isn't good at using it yet, but she has the aptitude.</br>  MC is just took a little vacantion once in a while and some nerd already lusting after his cute kouhai. <br>Why is this allowed?</br>  <br>There's something else that's also hot: her body.

So this is just gonna be a fucking flashback episode, huh? Guess we'll have to wait for next week for the bathroom scene.    <br>I don't understand <br>I keep refreshing it but it just says the channel is currently offline.</br></br>   Anime original content <br><br>For what purpose<br>How far is this adaption going to reach</br></br></br>    <br>Should have really expected that when it's titled "Back Then" or whatever.</br>  <br>Thank you based spoonfeeder</br>   megu-nee episode <br>What a waste of ep3. They should have delivered the exciting parts as soon as possible.<br>That's why it will fail.</br></br>    <br> Complaining about the anime expanding on canon </br>  <br>Some channels are fucked up like that, no idea why. Maybe it limit viewers.</br>  Oh snap it's this moment  All that blur.  Did the bathroom scene not happen?    <br>They better still do graduation. I'm fine with anime original content, but not at the expense of the best manga scenes. <br><br>They'll still have room if they cut out the mall, but I'm starting to think that between the Kurumi being bit arc, whatever they're gonna do with the dog, and a potential mall flashback they won't have room for helicopter of graduation.</br></br></br>    <br>This episode is just a flashback to z-day told from Megu-nee's perspective. Expect bathroom next week.</br>  rip stream  <br>It's not entirely anime original though, is it? I mean they didn't show anything in the manga, but I remember a few lines about when this happened.</br>  <br><br>Thus it came to pass.</br></br>  <br>That was just the first half though. Bathroom might be in the second half, would make sense to make the first part Megu-nee centered.</br>    <br>This ep is chapter 4 + a flashback to the outbreak it seems. It kinda fits though. They're expanding a lot on Megu-nee's character for next episode, at this pace though they won't make it to graduation for sure.</br>  Rip GG.<br>The anime will fail hard. Because they didn't deliver that basement arc in ep 3.</br>  Fuck this shit.  <br>Who would kill the stream. CC allows anime, only thing that could happen is this thread could be deleted for advertising/</br>  that bedroom eyes  <br> Because they didn't deliver that basement arc in ep 3. <br>You want them to adapt the basement arc now? That wouldn't fit at all with the pacing and would be sorely out of place without developing all the characters first.</br></br>  Screen getting distorted big time.  Are we going to do this every single episode?<br><br> WHY ISN'T THIS EXACTLY LIKE THE MANGA WAAAH </br></br>  gay  <br>It's your delusions breaking.<br>The stream never existed.</br></br>  <br>Is this your first day on /a/ faggot?</br>  Wasn't a terrible episode, but was kinda lackluster. I appreciate the expanded setting though.  WHY ISN'T THIS EXACTLY LIKE THE MANGA WAAAH  <br>so yuriii!</br>  WHY ISN'T THIS EXACTLY LIKE THE MANGA WAAAH   Kei in the preview <br>wat</br>  WHY ISN'T THIS EXACTLY LIKE THE MANGA WAAAH  Next week is fucking Kei.<br>They're not gonna show the bathroom scene till episode 6 at this fucking rate.<br><br>GG GG</br></br></br>    <br>The viewers wanted to see it delivered in this ep.<br>It doesn't sell as is so they needed to do something about it.<br>Now many people will just drop it and bam it will fail the sales.</br></br></br>  They really want this series to flop, don't they?  The first half was extremely boring and unnecessary. Why even cut out plot parts if you're replace them with this shit.<br>At least we got a bloody shovel this time, I guess.</br>  <br>MIKI A BEST</br>  It was alright. I think I've become too accustomed to episode 3 of any given manga being the episode where they drop the hammer.<br><br>It's pretty clear they did this episode to make it  seem like Megu-nee is actually alive.  If they did the twist this episode, it wouldn't have as much impact for anime-only watchers as it would now.<br><br>KEI NEXT EPISODE (wait, what)</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're retarded</br>  <br>Still best girl</br>  <br> no neet comments about the zombie apocalypse flying through the screen </br>  <br> any given manga <br><br>Anime, obviously. Are we actually getting the mall episode next week? Flashbacks on top of flashbacks would be a bit too much I think.</br></br></br>  <br>Let's see anon<br>Be sure to be here when the sales data is released</br></br>  SHUT THE FUCK UP FAGGOTS, Gakkou is still AOTS stop hating on new things that develop the setting more  Bathroom + Kei flashback next episode.<br><br>Mark my words.</br></br>  <br>That's Youtube.</br>    <br>There may not be mall anymore.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br> getting this buttflustered that manga fans are comparing the adaptation to the source material <br>Go back to reddit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you fuck off back to MAL or whatever</br>  <br>Seems like too much for a single episode. I have no idea how they're planning on going with the show at this pace. I don't dislike it though, in fact I thought animating the rooftop scene was very nice.</br>  <br>Thank you anon!</br>  The last scene had Megunee writing in the basement. Must find it earlier in this adaptation.<br><br>They're shuffling things around enough that mangafags won't be bored with a straight adaptation at least.</br></br>  <br>"It's different, therefore bad." is not a criticism that should ever be entertained.</br>  <br>Anime original end, the heli gonna rescue them.</br>  <br>It should just have followed the manga<br>It's always like this when they mess with something just werks and fuck up it hard.<br>You knoe no one gives a fuck about megu-nee or her relationships with her students<br>People were in it for the suffering and it didn't deliver it at ep 3.<br>Also they fucked up Kurumi's character quite a bit by making her butchering the senpai just like that.<br>What a disappointment.<br><br>FUCKING DROPPED</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So It's confirmed that before the outbreak happened, Yuki was bullied and depressed. Adds a lot more weight to some things in the manga such as Yuki commenting how bullies are bad.<br><br>I'm calling it right here, Yuki will be the one to save the school life club by using past rage/stress from bullying after seeing the uni girls/bikers 'bully' the club, drawing first human blood.</br></br>  So are thy gonna just skip Miki's character arc? I know she isn't the most relevant one of the main four but still, she's a cute character.  <br>Well, if the scene with Megu writing in the basement was based on this moment here, then bathroom is pretty much right after that.</br>  <br> this entire post </br>  At least we know now how sempai got into the roof with them.<br><br>If it was a 1:1 adaptation we'd never know.<br><br>Think about that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe there is a small change that this will be one of those split cours. They usually don't announce this from the very beginning. I don't know how much manga material there is, though.</br>  <br>No one is bored watching the shit even if it's 1:1 adaptation source material.<br>It's like you don't know anything about the animefags</br></br>  <br>If my opinion as a mangafag was relevant for the author, I'd have prefered to be a straight adaptation considering wha he has done so far. I don't know he thinks what he has done so far was a good idea, but hopefully the sale will give him a hint.</br>  <br>Did you even watch the fucking preview?</br>  <br>Maybe because this isn't a straight adaptation we'll find out how Megu-nee got infected.</br>  <br>You mean the sales of the manga that have more than doubled after an almost entirely anime original first episode?<br><br>Yeah, maybe that was a big hint for him.</br></br></br>  All the changes aren't all that bad. I just hope they don't fuck up pic related.  <br>No, the anime sales.</br>  <br>I don't come from anywhere else though anon.<br><br>People haven't been saying it's bad because it's different though. You sound like one of those retards that think any criticism is shitting on something</br></br></br>  <br>You know that the anime sales are barely relevant so long as the manga gets a big boost (which it has), right?</br>  <br>Yes it is. Changes are always bad and should never be accepted.</br>  If this anime aired 10-12 years ago then people would like the changes, because of the novelty it delivers I think but now it is no more the case.<br>The changes are triggering the people.<br>And tbh they are a bit not good...</br></br>  <br>I'm aware, but I can see how this is going to be irrelevant to the nips as soon as the anime ends, and therefore the manga sales will come back to usual.</br>  <br> And tbh they are a bit not good... <br>Is English your first language?</br></br>  <br> tbh <br>Nice meme.</br></br>   I don't really like the small changes they put into the anime but it is still watchable. The manga is still better but I'd continue to watch the anime nonetheless because I got nothing else better to do; just an opinion of mine. <br><br>Any changes to the opening? I missed it.</br></br>  <br>Disgusting mangafag.</br>  <br>It could also be that the anime will sell good. You usually don't see high pre-order numbers during the first weeks unless it is some really big hype like Fate stuff or something. Barely anybody even knew GG before so it will take a time until people start consider buying this and they'll probably wait anyway to see how well the adaption works. Maybe it will rise when the important/suffer scenes will happen in the upcoming episodes.</br>  muh subs when?  <br>Well it wasn't Taroumaru since they still have him.</br>  <br>There'll be about 40 chapters out when the anime ends, but the best stopping point is in chapter 30, so we'd need a snail's pace and lots of original content to adapt less than 2 chapters per episode for it to last that long. Which is exactly what is happening right now, so you might be on to something.<br><br> split cour <br> second half airs in winter <br> ends at graduation <br> by that time there's almost enough material out for another cour <br>A man can dream.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As far as I see barely anyone even complains about the changes themselves. Most anons only fear the shortness of the anime (one cours) and that they won't be able to adapt the important stuff that happens later.</br>  <br>I'm not saying it won't sell well, it's just that it won't be a big deal if/when it doesn't because it's already a success at what it was made for.<br><br>It's not as if it's an anime original that's relying on anime sales.</br></br></br>  <br>Reason for spoiler tag.</br>  <br>There's much more animefags than mangafags.<br><br>Deal with it.</br></br></br>  <br>7am PDT</br>  <br>The sales won't go back to "normal", people who bought 6 volumes won't stop there just because the anime is over.</br>  <br>They'll have to deal with Zombiemaru now that Megu-nee isn't alive when he turns.</br>  I don't get why people hate the changes.<br>Why would I want to see the exact same thing I already read? It's not like seeing it animated will make the story any better. In fact, considering the animation, it would only make the anime guaranteed to be worse than the manga. At least, even if it turns out worse than the managa, you won't be bored seeing the exact same thing you already read.</br>  Doujin of cute girls raped by zombies before getting eaten when?  <br><br>I wonder if the author left some bits out expecting it to become an anime at some point. It would give new material for people to look forward to.<br><br>Or maybe just stuff that couldn't get into the manga because time and page constraints.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because i want to see the story in manga animated not some other original one.</br>  <br>People hate changes when they're for the worse, like fucking up the atmosphere of Kurumi's "good night" to the zombie, skipping all the blood and gore and sad depressed atmosphere so far.</br>  <br> Gakkou Gurashi <br> Blood and gore <br> Gore <br><br>Give me one panel of on page gore. Actual gore.<br><br><br>It's literally being written by the mangaka. If this was a bonus chapter, you wouldn't be complaining about it, so what's the issue when it's animated?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The original content has been meh so far, I'd even call it boring.</br>  <br>You don't want this anon.</br>  https://archive.moe/a/thread/110038<wbr>396/#110038641<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/109993<wbr>809/<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/112097<wbr>001/<br>http://pastebin.com/xKr64Qre<br>http://pastebin.com/8rz8gEUM<br>http://pastebin.com/hgr2a3ZL<br>http://pastebin.com/6HyJahXx<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/112999<wbr>146/#113004805<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128388<wbr>151/#128412672<br>https://archive.moe/a/search/text/e<wbr>xtras%20pastebin<br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/q<wbr>wd0m6unfm1gnib/Gakkou+Gurashi+extra<wbr>s+V1.zip<br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/u<wbr>o9j2u3b6r9lsrb/Gakkou_Gurashi_v4_bo<wbr>nus.zip<br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/9<wbr>g5r6cj0ofsh0dh/GG+School+map.zip<br><br>What am I missing?</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr>  <br>Also why did they fuck up Yuki's scene in the library?<br>You know, the one when even the illusionary Megu-Nee leaves and we see how the happy-go-lucky is actually trembling in a corner.</br></br>  <br> I don't get why people hate the changes <br>Because we want our favorite scenes animated and not random something, duh.</br></br>  <br>Sometimes when authors have too much freedom they fuck up their own stories.</br>  <br>I suppose you would know best then, instead of the author.</br>  <br> what's the issue when it's animated? <br>I don't have an issue with the content itself, my concern is that the show only has a limited amount of time to work with, and I'm worried about what will get sacrificed for the original content. Hopefully it works out.</br></br>  <br>They want to keep her from PTSD a little more</br>  I don't know why some people think there won't be a graduation, it's the perfect stopping point even if they're not thinking in producing a 2nd cour/season.<br><br>They might shorten some stuff before but there's no way they won't be ending the anime with that.</br></br>  <br>This, just look at that fucking hack of George Lucas.</br>  <br><br>That's why they have editors.</br></br>  <br><br> People hate changes when they're for the worse <br>No, they hate it when it changes or removes the scenes they were waiting for, regardless of how the actual changes were made. Not saying it isn't a legit reason to be upset, just that the quality of the new content doesn't factor into it.<br><br> Kurumi's "good night" to the zombie <br>The only new content that bothered me, besides Miki being there from the start. Everything else is fitting in well, and today's was a solid exposition and build-up episode.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> skipping all the blood and gore <br>Shouldn't you be shitposting in a GATE thread?</br></br>  Someone pointed it out above, but I don't think people got the message. The anime needs a good stopping point, and the only good one is chapter 30.<br><br>It may seem like that's a lot of chapters to adapt, but the manga is actually surprisingly sparse in serious plot content between chapter 1 and 30, certainly not enough for a properly paced 1:1 adaptation over 12-13 episodes. For example, the entire Mall arc is 6 chapters, but can easily be done in a single episode.<br><br>So, you either get anime original content or a 1:1 at a snail's pace. I'd much rather have the former.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lolwut?</br>  <br> Lolwut? <br>Go back to the shithole you came from.</br></br>  <br> I am so dense, I can't understand how scared she is even though she's fucking pissing herself while someone is protecting her. </br>  <br>The manga portrayed that scene way better in terms of atmosphere and showing how Yuki realizes that world's fucked up. Having Megu-nee there reassuring her through it all ruins the whole thing.</br>  <br>You make me, buddy</br>   Symbolism <br><br>bravo vince</br></br>  <br><br>You know 30/13 means approximately 2 chapters per episode<br>They could fucking adapt it easily.</br></br></br>  <br> how Yuki realizes that world's fucked up <br>She never realizes it in that scene. The entire time she thinks it's a ghost from the trial of courage.</br></br>  <br>Megu being dead is already obvious. The anime isn't hiding it. The fact that you see her clinging to someone that is not there to protect her is much worse.</br>  <br>I agree, but there's no way to know whether it will work out until the show's over.<br><br>Relevant content wise, there's the mall and Miki/Kei's backstory, Megu-nee and the bathroom scene, the whole basement and infected Kurumi arc, helicopter, and graduation. Anything else I'm forgetting?</br></br></br>  <br>But they aren't. After episode 3 they've adapted 4 chapters.</br>  <br> 2 chapters an episode <br><br>The chapters are really short for a monthly manga.</br></br></br>  <br> Miki/Kei <br>1 Episode<br><br> Megu-nee bathroom <br>1 <br><br> Infected Kurumi <br>2 (3 an absolute limit)<br><br> Helicopter <br>1-2<br><br> Graduation <br>1<br><br>That's 8 episodes maximum. Add that to what we've already done and we still don't even make it to 12.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She always knew deep down, her facade and playing delusional only pushed it away so much but it was always there in some way<br><br>Not my point, so what?</br></br></br>  <br> The manga portrayed that scene way better in terms of atmosphere and showing how Yuki realizes that world's fucked up. <br><br>How is it not your point?</br></br></br>  <br><br>What I was talking about that they could have adapted it to anime easily in 1:1 sense. They could add extra scenes without changing shit much as well.</br></br>  <br>It isn't. I didn't say a thing about Megunee being dead or anything or how audience understands she's really not there. It's not as obvious as the manga.</br>  <br>Are you serious right now? You are complaining because it isn't obvious? Do you want a mexican soap opera camera zoom-in to character's faces to know what they feel?</br>  The anime is making Megu-nee more of a character at the expense of others because it's going to actually have an ending to the story earlier on, so Megu-nee obviously has to be more prominent.<br><br>I thought this was obvious</br></br>  <br>Miki one on one real talk with Yuki, but that's also short and could even be done in the same episode as the mall flashback. Though that itself might take 2 episodes, especially if they keep Kurumi's visit to her home and take their time with scenes including Kei.</br>  I just want more transltaions of the manga  <br>There's nothing to translate until tomorrow, calm your tits.</br>  Best girl of season.  wait a minute  When's Shovel gonna go bonkers and stop fighting because she thinks the shovel is senpai?  <br>Megu-nee also had the bear on her rear view mirror.</br>  <br>Miikun shouldn't exist yet.<br> Kill it with fire </br></br>  <br>What's Ruu doing there?</br>  <br>What am I waiting for?</br>  <br>The next episode.</br>  <br>Kurumi is love<br>Kurumi is life</br></br>  <br>Next manga chapter</br>  <br>You cheeky cunt.</br>  <br>Ayaya looks like she's not wearing pants at all.</br>    <br>Ruu doesn't wear a pink ribbon</br>  <br><br>I don't know, you should kill yourself right now.</br></br>  <br>Flinging shit isn't gonna help further your argument.</br>   feel when just watched the raw and understood everything <br><br>guess not having to wait for subs is cool.<br>starting to see the fruits of my study</br></br></br>  <br>Subscribed</br>  I'm really afraid they'll go for an anime original end where Yuki is the only survivor and gets picked up by Helicopter-kun at the end.<br><br>Please don't make it happen.</br></br>  <br> Megu-nee  will be the only survivor.</br>  <br>Yes I do<br><br> zombie cum inside Kurumi <br> girls save Kurumi before zombie takes a bite out of her <br> by time the girls check if Kurumi is okay, she turn into a perverted lesbian zombie and sexually assaults the girls </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That'd only happen if it was adapted by Bones.</br>  <br>Twist: It's all in Megu-nee's head.</br>   [HorribleSubs] Gakkou Gurashi! - 03 [720p].mkv     <br>Shovel is already a zombie though.</br>  <br> perverted lesbian futa zombie <br>Fixed.</br></br>  <br> everything is just a never ending chain of delusions <br> the person who is behind all of the delusions at the end   is the viewer </br></br>  <br>She's holed up in the basement bunker alone, imagining what it would be like if she had saved the others.<br>Her weak presence in the club is due to her being unable to properly associate herself with them, even in her mind, not after what she did.</br></br>  <br> season ends <br> finish watching the last episode <br> look outside window <br> zombies everywhere <br> check /a/ <br> the last post was made at the start of the season </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying there wouldn't be zombies shitposting daily because that's what they remember doing </br>    <br>That's why in her delusions she views herself as a zombie.</br>  So, do the zombies eat people or just bite them?<br>If they are hungry, it would make more sense to eat them, but they just seem to want to bite.</br>  <br>Can zombies solve captchas?</br>   pretty much every thread is filled with mostly mangafags, constantly comparing the manga to the anime.

It's one thing to not show the violence on screen (which is what the manga does), but there's a hell of a lot less impact when we don't hear blood splatter and smashing sounds. There's no weight to it. Honestly it feels like a bad excuse to cut costs on sound production.  <br>Like so? </br>  <br>What are you talking about, anon?</br>  Megu-nee is the hero we all deserve<br><br> Also Kurumi got rejected heh </br></br>  <br> fed with Yuki <br>zombies get out</br></br>  I refuse to believe Shovel-chan's dying or even half dead.<br><br>She's not dangerously veiny any more like all zombies have been.</br></br>  <br> comparing Mugino with other yurifags </br>  Who the fuck was it that talked shit about the hat?  <br> fuck her rotting pussy <br> maggots crawl over your dick and provide extra feeling <br>What could go wrong?</br></br></br>  <br>It is unlikely she is going to die anytime soon.</br>  <br>She probably said it like that to fit with Cathat's delusions.</br>  <br>Zombie food.</br>  <br>When the guy you like tries to kill you it's over.</br>  <br> There's no weight to it. <br>It's the opposite for me, it felt more real without the sound honestly.</br></br>  <br> I refuse to believe Shovel-chan's dying or even half dead. <br>She is just the plot device to force the girls to one day go apply for "work", as in, go visit the laboratory. It had to happen eventually.</br></br>  Was megu-nee alive during the tent scene? <br>How could yuki imagine the torchlight into exsistence</br>  <br>So, since it is not following the manga closely, when will Nee-san die and when will dog get infected?</br>  <br>He just wanted her body.</br>  <br>Zombie ghost</br>  <br>The same way she imagines people, things and sounds into existence and imagines things like wind, blood and zombies out of existence.</br>  <br>It's going to be diejobu.

Why are Megu-nee and shovel so cute?</br></br></br></br></br></br>   all these originals <br><br>It's not that bad and I don't hate them. But now I will never know that some scenes I've been hyped for months will get animated or not.</br></br>  <br> kinmoshit <br>This level of shit taste shouldn't be allowed</br></br>  I liked the episode.  <br>It's different, not reason to say anything bad about it when the only thing in common is being an all-girl cast.<br><br>Also, that meme is not exclusive to Kinmoza anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd say most of them left after the reveal.<br><br><br>Is that like mana-transfering?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh please. Wakaba Girl is the mangaka's better work.</br></br>  I equally enjoy GochiUsa, Kinmoza, Gakkou Gurashi. The first two are so different fom gakkou gurashi anyway it's hard to understand why there's such a rivalry between kinmoza and gurashi faggots.  <br>I liked It too.</br>  <br>There is? I thought it was only this faggot </br>  I wanna impregnate shovel.  I'm really looking forward to the Megu-nee reveal so they can change her part in the OP.<br>Having her turn around and be a zombie will be nice</br>  <br>Because people always try to stir up shit between fanbases. Don't respond.</br>  <br>So that you can get attached to them, clearly.</br>  <br> Enjoying Kinmosa <br> shit taste <br>Pick one</br></br></br>   this pacing <br> all these filler <br><br>No helicopter, no fire, no graduation.<br><br>Original end confirmed.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>You'd say wrong.</br>  <br>this one<br/></br>  Moogy-dono was right  <br> filler <br>I think you mean chains, anon. You know, for attachments. It serves to harden the blow.<br><br>Calling it. By Ep 6 or 8, Megu-nee will be revealed</br></br></br></br>  <br>Christ, I hope not.</br>  <br>Japan loves this anime, S2 incoming.</br>  Fuck me Zaraki, those don't grow back you know  <br>Myuri will give him some medicine, he can make his limbs grow back after all</br>  <br>Decent chapter I guess and I'm still holding on to the hope that Monster Quincy is gonna be a qt grill for now.</br>  <br> Decent chapter <br>It's always a good chapter when Mayuri struts his stuff Zaraki is getting bodied pretty hard for a guy who supposedly stopped fighting while holding back.</br></br>  <br>either that or die.<br><br>So... pernida....</br></br></br>  <br>ehhhhhhh  no. </br>  <br>What was the point of Unohana dying again? Kenpachi has gotten more stupid. Still holding back despite almost getting killed after debut and getting his ass saved and in case losing an arm and doing the same thing which lost his first arm</br>  Is Zaraki retard moe?  <br><br>because it's fun for zaraki, remember that he likes to fight<br><br>There is no fun (for him) if she says Bankai (or even Shikai) and instakill the enemy</br></br></br></br>  <br> commander <br><br>zaraki and mangapanda both.</br></br></br>  <br>but unoihana's death taught him responsability and always fight full on from the start and that shit.</br>  Yes they do, it's called Orihime.  <br>I'm sure he's having plenty of fun</br>  <br>In bleach yeah they do, just wait for the group healer</br>  How many people have jobbed now to make Mayuri look even more based?<br><br>I love it.</br></br>  <br>It sorta made him a tiny bit stronger i guess. and quelled his cockyness.<br>Think of it like if Gilgamesh from Fate acted serious all the time with every fight. shit would be over fast</br></br>  <br><br>nah, he is still retarded. Proof is he doesn't use his shikai even after an arm destroyed<br><br><br><br>As i said, he is retarded, but at least it's Mayuri's time to shine!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Was it really worth one of the best healers and experienced captains in Soul Society though?</br>  Kind of hoping for Nemu's shikai to be revealed here.<br><br>Bit of a long shot, but hey, I never expected Yachiru's to be shown either, so it's not totally out of the question.</br></br>   Mayuri gets his shit pushed in by glasses early in the series and only escapes with his regen trump card <br> Has been the strongest character in the series ever since then <br>Does Kubo have a boner for him or something?</br></br>  <br>Mayuri has taken out like 6 Captain class fighters this arc, something like that. Nigga is now embarrassing Kenpachi and the super Nazi thing simultaneously and earlier also made Askin walk away. He even talked shit to Yama's face and got away with it. If you try to fuck with him he will introduce your angus to the most arcane concepts you can't possibly imagine.</br>  <br> not having at least one original and two artificially implanted boners for mayuri-sama at all times </br>   controls people by inserting it's nerves into their bodies and taking over <br><br>Then how did it break those trees way back during the fight against the Royal Guard? Shouldn't that power only work on things that have nerves?</br></br>  <br><br>I think Kubo likes writing characters like Mayuri and Aizen more than he does the others.</br></br>  <br> Hype Kenpachi up as the strongest shinigami since sliced bread <br> Kills a dude that can control reality <br> Gets beat by nerves and stupidity <br><br>And Mayuri is fucking toying with him. I mean I expect the old "My power is actually" back and forth for a while.<br><br>Seriously though, Mayuri has done the bulk of the successful fighting himself in this war.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mayuri was toying with Uryuu until he pulled the "technique that will make me 100 times more powerful but make me lose my powers afterwards, at least until the next arc where I get them back through some convenient plot device" card. That and the friend sacrifice power ups are the most effective and unbeatable power ups in shounen.</br>  <br><br>MAUYRI NEXT SOUL KING!</br></br>  <br>For christ sakes, how many times does this need to be repeated.<br><br>The point of Unohana's fight with Zaraki wasn't about Zaraki's power-up. At least not in the first place. It was more about telling and completing her backstory that we never got. <br><br>Zaraki's power-up was secondary result of it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> exploding knees: the chapter </br>  <br>The narrative point of it was that, but there also needs to be an "in character" reason for the way characters act and that reason needs to have impact if it's carried out.</br>  <br>He didn't really even beat Gremmy. It was literally death by stupidity, he was and could have continued running circles around Kenpachi if he wasn't such a dumbass.</br>  <br><br>Still a shitty story device, Unohana death could have been better by having her fight versus an actual enemy and making zaraki arrive in her last moments</br></br>  <br><br>Could have been plain old spiritual pressure. Or maybe he's not only restricted to using nerves.<br><br>The correct answer is always kubo making shit up as he goes along</br></br></br></br>  shinigami are spirits how can they haves nerves. kubo messed up.  <br> Become all powerful <br> Be too retarded to make any use of it <br>Kubo is too deep.</br></br></br>  <br>That's meta knowledge though, what he's asking is what purposes in universe is there.</br>  <br><br>Good thing you weren't here for the Rukia Bankai chapters then</br></br>  <br> kills a person whose Bankai is literally about melting the flesh of her opponents <br> kills the top medic in Soul Society <br> all to give one guy a vague chance of a power-up <br><br>I'm pretty sure Unohana's death was less about her backstory, and more about Kubo wanting an excuse to have characters drop like flies. Can't have edgy death counts if there's a medic around I guess.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>wasn't here but it was pretty dumb. worrying about body temperature.</br>  <br><br>Does that mean Orihime's going to bite the dust too?</br></br>  <br> Orihime <br>You know what? I honestly forgot she existed, and yeah probably. The fact that she never used her "reverse time on life threatening wounds" shit is pretty stupid in of itself. <br><br>But I'm pretty sure Kubo would come up with some bullshit reason like "the particles of the Quincy's attacks negate her abilities" or some other contrived concept.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah it was pretty stupid. Apparently spirits have the same physiology as humans and even obey the laws of physics, except when they don't. <br><br>I get that Kubo wants to pull off a mix between science and the supernatural but he's such a shitty writer he can't pull it off convincingly.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus christ no. its fucking retarded to have one 8.5/10 in exchange for two 7/10's<br>Kubo has just butchered Kenny since his 'buff' he shoulda been untouchable but got fucked over by hax Gremmy</br></br>  <br> Unohana dying <br>You're going to feel real dumb in the near future.</br></br>  <br> Gets beat by nerves <br>That shit is broken as fuck.No shame in losing.<br>Nerves control your heartbeat, blood pressure, digestion, information sent from your senses to your brain, balance and general motor function.<br>Technically Pernida can fuck up your entire body and not puppeteering shit but controlling, manipulating and destroying it from the inside including what you see,hear,feel,taste and smell.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just how Kira and Frenchie are not dead, right?</br>  <br>The point is that Zaraki is a retard for rushing in despite getting his arm destroyed in the blink of an eye earlier. <br><br>You'd think he'd learn after his fight with Gremmy but he's really that retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but he survived fighting god and like cut space or some shit.</br>  do you think Kubo has fun writing Bleach?  Isnt the nervious system controll litteraly the same thing?   those don't grow back you know <br>Orihime.</br>  What happened to the old other thread?<br>Deleted or died because of inactivity?</br>  <br>Mayuri learns from his mistakes, not like any other character in the series.</br>  <br>Pretty much. Only difference is that eyes arrancar actually controlled the victim, this guy just breaks them.</br>  <br>So she basically has an enhanced version of Ywach's super Blut Vene?</br>  <br>he manages the reishi currents through his nerves, and that currets are probably in the blood or some shit, so he probably did the same to the trees though their savia or some shit.</br>  <br>Well yeah. Except it follows the exact same flow.<br> Controlls Byakya/Zaraki's arm <br> Cuts nervs in arm to stop unwanteded seppuku <br> so you controll body parts huh <br>Its litteraly just abit more violent for an unnessicary reason.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> inactivity <br>I doubt it, we have enough posts to keep one alive. Why was it deleted then?</br></br>  <br> Has been the strongest character in the series ever since then <br>Huh?</br></br>  <br><br>He's dominated every fight he's been in after his fight with Uryuu. But that's more because he knows how to pick his targets.</br></br>  <br>I think it's all part of Shunsui plan to get rid of any captain older than himself and Ukitake.<br><br>The reason? No fucking idea.</br></br></br>  if he control nerves hy not juust send nemu or some other robot to kill it  <br>It was Kubo being Kubo. He just didn't tell us that Ishida beat the strongest character in the manga.<br>I don't even care if that's not the case. I'm just gonna pretend it's foreshadowing.</br></br>  Shunshui as captain commander:<br><br> Sacrifices Unoanaha pratically for nothing. <br> Gets ready for an attack that got him by surprise even though mayuri knew it would happen. <br> Sacrificed Ukitake just to give Yawach a powerup. <br> Fres Aizen to make the rest of captains angry, so Aizen killed a bunch of minions because ther est of the captains are useless, and then leaves Aizen sitting there in his chair. <br> Invades rhe Royal Realm and forgets to bring Kenpachi with him. <br><br>if anything, i'd say Shunsui has been the best ally yawach ahs had in this war so far.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Nemu has nerves.</br>  FUCK YOU ALL GISELLE DIEDE?!<br><br>in other news can someone please update pic related.</br></br>  <br>So what?You're behaving like this is something new.This is fucking Zaraki.After what, 500 chapters since he debuted you call him a retard NOW?<br><br><br>Irrelevant when his opponent has a power like this.Pernida is the absolute worst possible match up for Zaraki.Someone he needs to use his brains, analyze and come up with a countermeasure.<br>With Gremmy he could just tank and rely on his power which is different from Pernida who bypasses defenses by targetting nerves which makes Zaraki's durability, his greatest asset, absolutely useless.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Pernida is the absolute worst possible match up for Zaraki <br>Who fucking isn't. He has had like one good pairing.</br></br>  <br><br>Looking at this it really seems like Kubo blew his load too early in this arc.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Does Sunshui want to dstroy Soul Society? Is he workign under yawach? or with Aizen?<br>He avoided fighting with Haschwald, and now he's just bringing every shinigami to the doorspet of the main villain, knowing none of them cn do shit to hit,<br>He was OK with fighting yamamoto after destroying the soukoku and directly opossing his command.<br><br>has been killing or setting up to kill powerful/old captains.<br><br>When he entered the royal realm didn't even wondered about the royal guards or to make an alliance with them or work together to find a solution.<br><br>Freed aizen with no clear reason.<br><br>Shunsui is really fishy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For the first time ever, no captain is from the original death squad that formed the Gotei 13.</br>  <br>He definitely has fun writing Mayuri's fights</br>  <br>exactly.<br><br>And he also let ukitake die, his goodbye with him was way too cold for soemone who have been friends since 2000 years ago.</br></br></br>  <br> Frenchie <br>Who?</br></br>  <br> Mayuri has done the bulk of the successful fighting himself in this war. <br>He is the expert about them.</br></br>  <br>Are you implying trees don't have nerves?</br>  <br>there aren't any anymore. if they have conventional powers, he will stomp over them due to his immense reiatsu and a zanpakuto that cuts through anything<br><br>so he fights unconventional opponents, who wreck his shit because he's too much of an idiot to fight intelligently.</br></br></br>  <br> Freed aizen with no clear reason. <br>Obviously he wants to make him the new SK. Both he and Ukitake expected Yhwach to go to Royal Realm and took measures: Shunsui went to free Aizen, Ukitake activated Kamikake.<br>Which is why Aizen was left behind in Seireitei. Shunsui's plan will be ruined if Quincies find a way to kill Aizen.</br></br></br>   Zaraki without an arm and paralyzed <br> More than likely going to stay that way for this series of fights <br>Fucking gee, so glad you gave him a power up so he could be useful, Kubo. Almost like you were about to make him an important character.</br></br>  I've just realised something. We still haven't seen Ichigo fight since he got his two swords.<br><br>I mean it's good, Ichigo fights are boring, but how long ago was that?</br></br>  <br>English Co captain</br>  <br> More than likely going to stay that way for this series of fights <br><br>well mayuri decided to save him because he thinks he could be usefuul still, so I think he will still do something.</br></br></br>  <br>the only tiem he did something it was vs thunderbolt and he even told ehr to dodge because she woudl get killed otherwise.<br><br>And then he shoot one or two getsugas at yawach that did nothing.</br></br></br>  <br>He had a short fight versus T. Blew her arm off, then everybody started swarming him.</br>  <br> implying he won't pull a bankai out of his ass and then pic related will happen </br>  <br><br>What chapter was his good-bye in? I'm looking for it but I can't find it</br></br>  <br>he has no legs now.</br>  <br> arm already missing <br>Deviantart faggots knew the future all along</br></br>  <br>Lol that can't even be called a goodbye. It was in the chapter where Gotei finally arrived in SK's realm.</br>  I'm worried<br>Other than mayuri, who else could have a good fight now? Zaraki's downed, bromamura is wolfed, and even grimmjow was brought back to job.<br>The vizards are only fodder<br>And even hitsugaya's fanservice couldn't help much<br>Who else is left??</br></br></br></br>  <br>They are just broken.</br>  <br>The captain commander, Ukitake's ghost, Ichigo Squad and  Hinamori </br>  <br>Shunsui, of course. He is our last hope.</br>  <br>yawach you mean.</br>  <br><br><br>Byakuya, Renji, shunsii and I hope yoruichi</br></br></br>  <br>Shunsui<br>Urahara<br>Aizen<br>Ishiin<br>Tessai<br>Ryuuken<br>Ginjo<br>Facebook<br>Ichigo<br>Shiji if he goes bankai.<br>Byakuya new upgraded bankai.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was talking about the scene where Shunsui says "We'll save Soul Society, that's what Ukitake would've wanted."</br>  <br> Byakuya new upgraded bankai. <br>The bankai he couldn't upgrade because As Nodt had it while he was training?</br></br>  <br><br>I was talkin about the chapter where Shunsui went off to the prision and freeed aizen.</br></br>  <br>did they ever explain how johnny got out of that one? I forget if he can just stop it at will its bee so long</br>  <br>are you retarded? or just have bad memory?</br>  <br>Sounds like you have an argument to use. Show it.</br>  <br>That's the one I'm talking about too, it's the chapter that cemented for me that Shunsui is up to something</br>  Is it just me or did Mayuri just grift powers off Tousen's corpse. Fear Factor 4 is awfully similar to Suzumushi's cry.  <br>You kidding, right? Kubo would never get rid of earth nakama. Well, unless her death would conveniently make Ichigo/Ishida go berserk.</br>  <br><br><br>Found it. Chapter 605</br></br></br>  <br>of course they did.</br>    <br><br>Byakuya did the same trainign as ichigo, ruukia and renji, so he learned teh true names and all that shit of his sword.<br><br>his shikai was on his bankai level on the fight with as nodt, so his bankai WILL be different or better or whatever.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shunsui.<br>Shuhei if he didn't literally get killed in one panel.<br>Aizen<br>Urahara</br></br></br></br>      <br> based on what was foreeeen <br><br>BY WHO<br><br>did the king gave them incompelte information on the future?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can you prove that true name asspull isn't unique to Renji?<br>And his bankai couldn't have become stronger for the reason I stated earlier.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>That mofo si happy.<br><br>happy because he knows ukitake is going to die? happy because he's going to free aizen? happy because the quincies are in the royal realm?<br><br>why the fuck is Shunsui that fucking happy there?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he didn't ahd his bankai, but if he knew more about it he can improve it when he gets it back.</br>  <br><br> More than likely going to stay that way for this series of fights <br><br>Not counting the fact that Mayuri is as good a healer as Unohana, Zaraki still has power boosts up his ass that'll make him ignore whatever damage he has. If the his shikai, his eyepatch.<br><br>Then again, they're fighting the Elite Sternritter who were boosted by the Aschwallen and who managed to beat the Royal Guard, why the fuck do people think they're going to be pushovers in any way?<br><br>1x1 duels are not going to happen anymore for the most part.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Since when do power-boosts regenerate arms and legs? Also, Mayuri is able to heal himself and Nemu because of the extensive body modifications he's done, he's not good at healing others.</br></br>  <br><br> he's not good at healing others. <br><br>He already healed others during the arrancar arc and he most definitely un-zombified Jizzelle's victims.</br></br></br></br>  <br>he fixed uryu and renji's internal organs.</br>  <br><br> Since when do power-boosts regenerate arms and legs? <br><br>Ludicrous amounts of reiatsu being poured tends to have bullshit healing effects.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I forgot about Uryuu and Renji. Guess he could Zaraki if he wanted to then.</br></br></br>  <br> That scene and the one directly after </br>  <br>kubo has a boner all the time</br>   Mayuri Vs. Aizen will never happen <br>This world is hell</br>  What the hell? I missed a couple of chapters. why is Mayuri fighting Zaraki?  <br>Shunsui is evil though.<br>Aizen do something pls.<br><br> Where the hell is Ryuken anyway? Not relevant anymore? </br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't even understand why Gremmy sent his "real" self out to fight. If he can just imagine extra selves, why would he ever not have an extra self chilling out at home? Total bullshit.<br><br> Also sick quads, pic related </br></br></br>  <br>Mayuri is a quincy, why do you think he was in the maggots nest? He only uses sceince to fight and not reiatsu like the restof the shinigami.<br><br>The clues where all there but nobody conected the dots until this reveal.</br></br></br>  The worst parts of Zaraki and Mayuri together.<br><br>Zaraki too stupid to take off his eyepatch or use Shikai after losing a fucking arm. If losing an arm doesn't name you get serious nothing will.<br><br>Mayuri magically knowing everything about his opponents abilities because he can analyze anything like he has the Sharingan and has drugs for all occasions on his person.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Nobody connected the dots <br>IMPLYING<br><br>it was obvious, if you werent a fucking level 1 reader</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mayuri is the shinigami that Bruce Wayne became when he died.</br>  <br>Well, yeah, but the guy asked why they where fighting, he is clearly a level -1 reader.</br>  <br>That's entirely on character for Zaraki, and Mayuri explained exactly how he'd come to determine how Pernidas power worked using information that we the reader already had access to. Both points are entirely invalid, you shitstain.</br>  <br>Implying you arent too</br>  <br>Ryuken is a coward. Didn't show up to protect Karakura from Aizen, and he won't show up now.</br>  <br><br> Mayuri magically knowing everything about his opponents abilities <br><br>After not attacking Pernidas like an idiot and observing Zaraki getting attacked not once but twice, it's completely natural that Mayuri would start counter attacking in some way. Not that he has done much so far.<br><br>Zaraki should fucking know better at this point, though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   implying mayuri knows everything about someone's power just because of a few seconds <br><br>He was surprised Ishida could use Ransentogai. Seeing quincies with schrifts should be completely foreign to him.</br></br>  <br>It's just a bad match up for Zaraki. If Miracle had shown up this situation might have been reversed.</br>  <br> implying he's even a war potential </br>  <br>you fuck off right away</br>  People always complain they hate powerlevel battles then when someone with a huge powerlevel gets wasted by someone who doesn't care about your reiatsu everyone is complaining.  <br>I'm implying no such thing. But Kubo promised us to show his bankai in this arc.</br>  <br> being retarded <br>He's seen plenty of them by this point, and they're all just applications of various reishi powers. Seeing it once and knowing what it did would be an asspull; the second time proves it's pure science.</br></br>  <br>Every schrift is completely different. You say that like they are even remotely similar. <br><br><br>the only thing any of them have in common is being granted by nazi jesus</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also we don't know how much of his power is compromised by the high Reishi density in the Warwelt</br>  <br>He wouldn't die, even if he was killed to death.<br><br>Does he even know HOW to die at all?<br><br>Yes you really need to literally know how to die in order for you to actually literally die to death, otherwise you're an infinite loop.<br><br>Trust me I know this shit.<br><br>Or do I?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes that's exactly what I implied. Are you having brain problems?</br>  <br> Overkill: super strength <br> Superstar: super strength <br> Power: super strength </br></br></br>  <br><br>Kill yourself</br></br>  <br>He almost got meatball'd. He's looking like a jobber this morning, at least by /a/ standards.</br>  <br>Wasn't the Unohana fight supposed to beat the dumb out of him and return him to his brutal killer self of the past? Being a fucking 'tard kinda hinders that.</br>  <br> seeing it twice means he can know whether someone can create matter out of thin air, has zombie blood, injects people with nerves, has a love gun, is easily forgotten, or can do any other never before seen magical Quincy shit </br>  <br>E Y E P A T C H<br>E<br><br>Y<br><br>E<br><br>P<br><br>A<br><br>T<br><br>C<br><br>H</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, not even remotely. It was to release the limits he placed on himself; if anything it made him even more dumb, but also more strong. I don't know how the fuck you people didn't get that the first time, you're all level one filth.</br>  <br>It took much less for Zaraki to get serious against Ichigo. not being serious after losing an arm is not in character, it's just being regarded</br>  Reminder Zaraki will forever be at half strength due to no two handed grip on the sword.  <br>The Quincy will probably be taken out with team ups of two or more people. Grimmjow might stand up and reveals something new so don't count him out yet.<br><br>I expect Shinji to finally deliver because jesus fucking christ his character deserves some dignity back after jobbing against nonvolständig Quincy and being held of by fucking Tosen. Renji might take down that gladiator themed guy with the help of one or two others, at least I hope his fight against that Star faggot was not the last we saw in the series.<br><br><br>Shunsui might fight Haschwalth or something like that. The last cpt. commander already jobbed against Ywach so I don't expect the next to do the same mistake. Ishin and Ryuuken are bound to show up some time though I highly doubt that Tessai will show up since Kubo might have forgotten about him completely. Ginjo and the others are there to jobb. Byakuya might tagteam one of those Quincy and as will Yoruichi. Aizen, Urahara, Kenpachi, Ichigo and the fifth war potential (who the fuck? maybe Ishida that flaming faggot) will go up against Ywach.<br><br><br>Shuhei is out man, it'll be fucking bullshit if he stands up after that one. It's dumb as fuck though, what good is it to tease a bankai (even more than just once) that's never going to be revealed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you're a scientist who basically made a large chunk of his early career on the study of fucking Quincy then I really shouldn't need to explain this to you. Do you even induction? Deduction? Fuck, it's not magic, it's literally just particle manipulation. And it doesn't just apply to the Quincy either. You're an absolute retard, don't bother replying.</br>  <br> implying taking off the eyepatch will protect him from hax powers or heal his wounds </br>  <br>that's bullshit anon. Just admit you have forgotten that he did not have his bankai. He might have gotten physically stronger but no new bankai for him.</br>  <br>Zaraki's entire purpose of being there with Mayuri is to boost Mayuri's wow-thats-so-fucking-cool factor. Kubo is simply playing favorites with a captain we have limited information about. Remember Zaraki's fight with the sternritter imagination? Same stuff.</br>  <br>That was pre-awakened Kenpachi. Just saying.</br>  <br>There is literally nothing he can deduce from just seeing these powers twice<br><br>Like nothing about watching the V- Vanish would tell you he was manifested by someone with imagination powers or that Superstar was a puppet body for james.</br></br></br>  <br> implying limitless reiatsu pressure wouldn't suppress any quincy power </br>  <br>Except it's literal fucking magic you stupid twat. The bleach universe doesn't even have a set of rules to follow to accurately deduct anything when it comes to power-levels. Kubo going "b-but he's a scientist!" is just a shitty cop-out.</br>  <br>fagit</br>  <br>No I'm pretty sure you're just a retard. <br> quincy can pump reishi through the body <br> Pernidas attack removes control of Kenpachi motor control, arm contorts of its own volition <br> uses paralysis on kenpachi- tests hypothesis  <br>It's the scientific method. It's barely even an ability, it's just logical reasoning.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Confirmed for level -1 reading. Go back and start from chapter one, you clearly missed something important.</br>  <br> quincy can control and pump reishi <br> instead of using nerves it's some sort of pseudo telekinesis <br> mayuri just paralyzed their greatest asset for some shitty guess <br><br>Hell there is nothing there that lets you know it was nerve control and not mind control or any of the other various stern ritter powers we saw.<br><br>The V-Visionary should be able to do the samething pernida does without any of the nerve shit. Then mayuri would be looking like an idiot.<br><br>There is no way to tell what's going on or the opponent's power is with just sight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You mean the trees that were grown from one of the Royal Guard's body? They probably had nerves too.</br></br>  <br><br> Reishi density? I'm talking more about a way to accurately to predict or deduce specific powers, not power-levels, my bad.</br></br>  <br>You know he's shown he can flip that shit on and off at will.<br><br> Oop I poked you with my sword and you're paralyzed <br> didn't work <br> guess I'll unparalyze you and probably magic your arm back too <br> why not have a free powerup while we're at it because science </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Fucking who?</br></br>  <br>the classical musician<br><br>rip</br></br></br>  Bleach is worse than Naruto now.<br><br>How can a series devolve so much? It's absurd.</br></br>  Remember when mayuri was blown the fuck out by hitsugaya 10 times in a row?   now <br>it has been worse than Naruto since the end of Aizen arc and generally not that good since the end of Soul society arc.</br>  anyone got and cool bleach 1080x1920 s4 wallpapers  <br>I agree</br>  T-they are fine, r-right?<br>Gigi too</br>  How do we defeat Yhwach?  <br>about as fine as hitsugaya and kira</br>  <br> Hitsugaya <br><br>Oh so they're o-<br><br> Kira <br><br>Getting mixed messages here anon</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can someone explain what exactly mayuri did when he stabbed kenpachi? Mangapanda is fucking impossible to decipher sometimes.  <br>reach is heart. He will abandon everything, die, and thanks the heros.</br>  <br><br>You don't. Yhwach will be betrayed by Uryu and then Uryu will sacrifice himself.</br></br>   Yamamoto dies <br> Captains not wearing the haori <br><br>For shame.</br></br></br>  <br>They're both dead ghosts, the fact that one was a zombie ghost doesn't change that without his master he is probably a dead ghost zombie. Or a dead zombie ghost. Man why the fuck did they have to include that dumb power.</br>  <br><br>His shikai ability paralyzes whoever it cuts. I have no idea what the screech did.</br></br>  <br>ichigo will receive a powerup and kill him the end</br>  Poor Kenpachi. He's being used like he's a Nemu.<br><br>Gremmy might be about as badass a fight as he gets.<br><br>Hopefully he can get to use his true shikai.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yamamoto dies <br> All the captains except based Kurotsuchi job <br><br>That's what you get for not applying your rape culture enough.</br></br></br></br>  Do I have to do everything myself?   has won every single battle without any injury, always toying with the enemy in creative ways, always having a countermasure for everything, regardless of how powerful the enemy is <br> has only lost to a surprise "if I use THAT i will lose all my powers" attack, and everyone knows this kind of attack is only second to friendship powerups <br><br>Is Mayuri Batman? I think he could defeat every single bleach character without even trying, except maybe bach with "almighty" on, aizen in butterfly form, ichigo in mugetsu/friendship/plotkai mode and maybe the mad monk and yamamoto.<br><br>He is the only one worthy of being a captain, everyone else is just ridiculous.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There will never be a fight between Urahara and Mayuri trying to out science each other to gain the upper hand in combat. </br>  <br><br>It's been pretty apparent since the beginning that Kubo loves writing keikaku doori scientist characters. <br><br>When you think about it, Urahara, Aizen and Mayuri have never really lost. Aizen is literally getting stronger every second even while sealed in the comfiest chair in the universe, Urahara is still mysterious as fuck and Mayuri's only loss was simply him turning himself to liquid and leaving the battle (having infected his opponent with tracking devices and forcing him to use an ability that would make him unable to ever use his powers again).</br></br></br></br>  <br>11/10</br>   Unohana died for this retard <br>Damn, I'm still mad.</br>  <br>8/10, you missed one panel there anon</br>  <br>lolreiatsu and keikakus, hyogoku and nakama power.</br>  <br><br>Yhawch gets accelerated ghost cancer. As he dies he reaches out to Ichigo and the final page is <br><br><br>THE HEART<br><br>written by Kubotite</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Is that Kenpachi's face in the bottom right? Holy shit I only just worked it out.</br></br>  kubo is an talentless hack  <br>what else is new</br>    <br>Pernida's ability seems to be utilizing target's strength.</br>  <br> Mayuri have never really lost. Aizen is literally getting stronger every second even while sealed in the comfiest chair in the universe <br>Why? Up until she died she had no character didn't even participate in the final battle against aizen or any battle for that matter.</br></br>  <br>Sauce</br>  <br>because you are doing god's work anon.</br>  What was Zaraki's shikai power again?<br>On the release the said something like "devour" or "engulf". But I don't recall his shikai being explained.</br>  <br>Momo, what a big body you have!</br>  <br>Ayyyy it can't be helped.</br>  <br><br><br>His shikai ability only paralyzes the limbs, the screech paralyzed everything else.</br></br></br>  <br>His shikai doesn't have a defined power. It's just a fuck huge sword.</br>  <br>It just cuts things.<br><br>Is Zaraki out for the count now, or will someone heal him again? Recently it seems that his job has been tanking strong attacks of the bad guys.</br></br></br>  <br> werewolf Komamura <br>I almost forgot about it. Shit was broken as fuck but I liked his new image</br></br>  <br>Kubo will never fail to find an excuse to slip his amputation fetish into Bleach.</br>  <br>I don't think you need us to answer that for you, anon.</br>  <br> I expect Shinji to finally deliver because jesus fucking christ his character deserves some dignity back after jobbing against nonvolständig Quincy and being held of by fucking Tosen. <br><br>Bazz-B was actually one of the strongest Sternritters and he ended up not really doing anything to Shinji so that one most likely ended as a draw. And Tousen was one of the strongest motherfuckers in the Winter War so I don't see how that's anything to complain about.<br><br>That said, he could have defeated all of the above if he actually used his broken zanpaktou<br>instead of monologuing like an idiot.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It hits you really really hard.</br></br>  <br>Momo's bankai is a meta-bankai<br><br>It allows her to be swapped with whoever has been stabbed in the manga in any moment in time, so she can save them</br></br></br>  <br>Hitsugaya was confirmed to have been still alive before being zombified, making it a transformation closer to voodoo than walking dead. As such he still has potential to return to normal, or something close to normal, it's all in the hands of Mayuri now.</br>  <br>shinji will deliver vs lille. Lille's power is absolute, but only a very narrow field of fire.<br><br> he'll get oneshot right after confusing lille </br></br></br>  Who Dragon Quest here?  <br> go to reddit <br> check r/bleach <br> this has been posted there <br><br>i don't know what i expected</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And yet Kubo insists on writing brute-force "my powerlevel is bigger than yours" fights. <br><br>The ransom asspulls he keeps resorting to all the time would be much more bearable if they were handwaved with "it's science, and I'm hella smart, don't have to explain shit" than "reiatsu, that is all."</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Did kubo draw that?</br></br>    <br><br>That's what you get for going to Reddit</br></br>  <br> kenpachis bankai </br>  <br>No, his twin brother, Kobu</br>  <br> shinji will deliver vs lille <br>This, I could see a Shinji vs Lille coming a mile away<br><br> Shinji is still free to fight <br> Still needs to show bankai <br> Fucker needs to win at least once come on <br> His power is messing with directions <br> Lille Barro has an ultrapowerful but straight-shot directional attack <br><br>It's fucking obvious</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Kubo gets invited by Square Enix to talk in a Dragon Quest event <br><br> Kubo just ends up mocking his gaming buddy saying he got him to "lend" an enormous shit ton pile of money without ever returning </br></br></br></br>  <br>I expect him to pull this on Lille, then just get shot anyways when he won't shut the fuck up.</br>  <br> &gt;Fucker needs to win at least once come on <br>Ahahahahahaha</br></br>  <br>Why are you posting a shitty downscaled version from facebook?</br>  zaraki woulda won eventually   Of all people, Hisagi is the one who gets sniped by X nigger <br><br>I know Kubo is actually healing character much faster this arc, Yumichika and Ikkaku get getting up despite getting their asses kicked constantly but fuck, is kubo ever showing Yumichika's and Hisagi's bankai?<br><br>Just make up some lower tier characters and give them a decent fight.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bankais we will never ever see:<br>Vizards<br>Kyoraku<br>Ukitake<br>Zero Division</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No you'll get Byakuya owning in yet another fight and you will like it</br>  <br>I feel bad for the lower tier characters, the only villains left are all monsters</br>  <br><br> Zero Division <br><br>They're practically confirmed to be working for Bach now that he's the "new" Soul King. They'll be added to the enemy line protecting him. <br><br>There's a reason why Kubo barely showed any of their abilities in their first fights with the exception of Rape Culture Monk. They're going to show their A game now.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They do in Bleach.</br>  <br> not Job "Jobber" Mc job Monk The Jobber </br>  <br>Matsumoto had her entire stomach plug ripped out.<br><br>For all we know Kira is still alive.</br></br></br>  ERmm ... Kubo ? <br><br>  Yfw Kubo is a huge Bon Jovi fan </br></br>  <br><br>I thought Kira was confirmed ded?</br></br>  <br>I think for a long time after the soul society arc, he didn't. Then he kinda stopped giving fucks and seemed to enjoy coming up with all kind of stuff with the nazis.</br>  <br>There was an implication that it has an absorbing/disintigrating/'eating' kind of power.</br>  <br>Kira was confirmed dead.</br>  <br><br>Sauce?</br></br>  <br>"Bleach the dagger", google it.</br>  <br> implying hisagi wont get to kills the nigger </br>  <br>Isn't the Dagger just a collection of editor's notes and has nothing written by Kubo himself?</br>  <br>Sorry, but killing niggers is Byakuya's job.</br>  <br>I don't have a source that confirms that kubo did it and yeah there is a good chance that an editor did it for him, but the dagger was released during the 5 week break, so Kubo definitely had enough time to confirm the things written in there and well Kira being 100% death is one of them.</br>  God damn it, Kubo.  <br>they don't lmao</br>  <br>Ukitake<br><br>BTFO<br>T<br>F<br>O</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, Kubo has been giving even more bizarre enemies to Zaraki fight with. Weird pairings as said in another thread. Reality breakers, sense numbers and limb torning aberrations, etc are all but interesting fight to see he deal with it since physical threats are not a challenge to him anymore.</br>   13 Blades cover revealed <br><br> It's going to have drawings from guest manga authors <br><br>Hope Araki and Murata are included in that guest list.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Top meme</br></br>  <br> Gin <br>too soon</br></br>  <br><br>Gerard might be a challenge. I assume his physical abilities are augmented by whatever the miracle does.</br></br>  <br><br>You know what, I think the ressurection was his doing. Everyone else displayed their letter based powera except him in the fight against the royal guard.</br></br>  <br>Because he's  Aizen[\spoiler], anon. </br>  <br>No there was not.</br>  <br> Ukitake <br> no awesome lightning &amp; water elemental weapon <br>I'm salty.<br><br>also<br> we will never know the name of Tetsuzaemon's sword and it's release command <br> we will never see Yoruichi's sword nor get to know it's name <br> we will never see Ichigo's other friends get powers <br> we will never see full body devil Chad <br> Tsubaki is ded <br> we will never see Kira again </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I remember how Hisagi vs Exacta was practically the best animated fight of the FKT arc.</br>  <br> Yoruichi's sword  <br> Soifon on uses it</br></br>  <br><br>I remember how they re-used the exact same animations for the Ichigo vs Ulquiorra fight</br></br>  <br>soifon is such a qt</br>  <br> Tsubaki is ded <br>But Hachi brought him back.</br></br>  <br>Sweet Yama  ;_;7 </br>  <br>soifon is going to rape/marry the yoruichi shota in the finale after the big bad is dad</br>  <br>Kubo has really weird idea about Hisagi. It's like he was in the perpetual loop of "Hm... I think I will make Hisagi important" and "Nah, fuck Hisagi after all". Rinse and repeat.</br>  <br><br>Because he was actually a very famous character in the manga, despite barely doing jackshit during the Soul Society arc. Then Kubo gave him the Exacta fight and it had huge ratings in SJ. The anime team capitalized on that and gave his fight a big budget and a competent animation team.<br><br>But then again, Kubo doesn't give a shit about popularity for the most part, which is why Hisagi and Hitsugaya are doing nothing but getting their shit pushed in and Mayuri, an extremely unpopular character, gets a bunch of panel time kicking ass and employing GHOST SCIENCE because he's one of Kubo personal favorite characters.<br><br>That said, I'd like to see Hisagi's bankai. His shikai is pretty cool and has a nice theme going for Hisagi's character.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mayuri's science shit is BS<br><br>how did he ever fucking lose his first fight</br></br></br>  <br>He's just playing a game.<br>"How many times can I make Hisagi look like a bitch before it's time to show his bankai?"  He won't show his bankai </br></br>  <br>Does kubo really have that for a profile picture?</br>  <br>He didn't even lose. He left Uryuu to die while surviving himself</br>  <br><br>Because all the science in the world wont save you from getting your shit nuked.<br><br>Same reason Yhwach with all his allmighty bullshit still lost to Yamamoto a thousand years ago.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, they have Omaeda.</br>  <br>He still had a dick at that time, grave mistake.</br>  <br>Talking about corpses. Where are the Espada and Zombie Squad? They could be useful now.</br>  <br><br> with my A i can see the future you are powerless to stop me <br> all he can see is fire </br></br></br>  <br>But he should've known Nemu had the antidote. Plot-induced stupidity?</br>  <br> Implying Uiharu won't use her time reversal healing powers to give him back his arm. </br>  <br> Grimmjow jobs <br> Zombie Squad could be useful </br></br>  <br><br>How could he have guessed that Nemu would betray him?</br></br>  <br> through some convenient plot device <br>Uryu's father shot him in the same spiritual organs where Byakuya stabbed Ichigo in their first meeting. Ichigo lost powers that weren't his to begin with, Uryu got his back.<br>It's like pottery.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know if he could've predicted that, but Nemu was paralyzed anyway. If Uryu had tried to search her on his own, she couldn't have done anything to stop him. At the very least, Mayuri should've destroyed the antidote if he really wanted Uryu to die.</br>  <br>Yes. Because Gremmys fuck huge meteor was annihilated. Either it was vaporized of consumed.</br>  <br><br>Nah it's clearly Chads.<br>Who else has a black with red lines color scheme?</br></br></br>  <br><br>He was a pool of liquid, i don't think he was in the position to do anything.</br></br>  <br> one and togashi will include their scribbles </br>  <br> implying he's not </br>  <br>he could still shittalk</br>  <br>dont forget miura</br>  <br>Because Gremmy is literally unbeatable as Kubo wrote him and what you said is just 1001st way of him killing any opponent while sustaining no damage whatsoever.</br>   the fullbringers are still on their way <br>Come the fuck on, I want the shinigamis from the second arc fully fleshed out already. I have been so hyped about all dem sword releases since that cool as fuck ending showing all 13 squads separately.</br>  <br>Nice meme.<br><br>First fight was a draw, he didn't win but he survived. <br><br>Syazel losing was glorious because he basically defeated himself. Not a lot of people remember that.<br><br>Having studied the Quincy for years gave him a very particular advantage this time around, not to mention he brought extra fodder with his revived Arrancar. He'll probably get killed by Uryu and that will be the end of it, but the ride will have been glorious.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't even have to be clones of himself<br><br>He literally created another being with it's own power<br><br>He never has to reveal who he actually is. There could be a billion different people<br><br>He could imagine the entire dbz cast. Ywach gave him the imagination power because he literally has none at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yhwach see's he's going to lose <br> still has to fight yama and get roasted </br></br>  <br>You are an idiot. He obliterated it with one swing. You're misconception has become a retarded headcanon, which you should dismiss before you continue to spew verbal diarrhea</br>  <br><br> Yes. Because Gremmys fuck huge meteor was annihilated <br><br>Uhm, yes, that is literally what happened.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah Uryu is going to "prove" Jugo/Ywatch that he's loyal by killing Mayuri</br>  <br>what is that? the next databook or what?</br>  <br>what is heart?</br>  <br><br>Thanks for correcting me, guys.</br></br>  Weekly reminder that Senna is canon  <br>How many people haven't showed their Bankai yet?</br>  <br>He used the nerve paralyzing shit. Guess why he deduced that's a power based on nerves, you schmuck?</br>  <br>Lille is probably the most based SR. Fuck off.</br>  <br>He current Shikai is now as powerful as his old Bankai. Logically, his current Bankai should be more powerful than his old Bankai.</br>  <br><br>Shunsui, Aizen, Urahara, Yoruichi, Ukitake, Hisagi, Yumichika, Ichigo(he probably has a new one), every Royal Guard except for the Monk and Kenpachi.</br></br>  <br>who?</br>  <br>post 3 bankai that you are interested in the most:<br>Urahara<br>Isshin<br>Kyoraku</br></br></br></br>  <br> Lille <br> Not goofball Aizen impersonator </br></br>  <br>Replace Kyoraku with Aizen, and it's perfect.</br>  <br> Shinji ever winning a fight <br><br>Give it a rest.

Askin is hilarious in ever panel he's in, Lille's pretty based and Thor is pretty neat as well. 3/4 aint bad. Most of the sternritters are crap, but these guys aint so bad</br></br></br>  <br>Hisagi's problem is that ultimately he's a jobber who's big, foreshadowed mentor figure is an even bigger jobber. Don't forget that Hisagi was hyped up quite a bit during the SS arc just so it was a big deal when Yumichika beat him.</br>  <br>I hate Lille's stupid name and his shitty hairy gun.<br>The rest are cool.</br></br>    <br><br>Silly anon, you never left 2007.</br></br>  JESUS CHRIST, IS THIS OFFICIAL ARTWORK?<br><br>YOU CAN SEE YUI'S NAKED BREAST FOR FUCKS SAKE<br><br>GOD DAMN IT KYOANI, GOD DAMN IT YOU MASSIVE CUNTS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  Fuck off.  <br>You need to calm down tbh</br>  L-L-Lewd.

I really love your work and wish you'd draw Doremi for me in such a lovely costume.</br></br>  <br>How long do you think your interest in drawing bunnygirls will last?</br>  <br>Draw Kanbaru cosplaying as Celty.</br>  <br>Ah, gotcha. Sorry to bother you. Have a nice thursday!</br>  NTR is disgusting. That is all.  <br><br> raw sexual desire <br> uninhibited lust <br><br>This nigga knows what's up. NTR is about a woman so filled up with lust that she abbandons all morals and principles, and it's beautiful. Most NTRs have just 1 text bubble to 1 or 2 pages talking about the cuckold or his PoV so it's easily ignorable. Shit NTRs that focus on the cuckold PoV are a huge minority.<br><br>NTR haters are true betacucks as they can't appreciate both slut women and serious women and understand that the slut is just for fun without any attachments at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Only reason to bother with NTR is ahegao. If more vanilla doujins had ahegao you wouldn't bother with NTR  <br><br>Given context, i do declare that this is some good NTR. Of course, you'd understand what that scan leads people to believe.</br></br>  <br>Ahegao is fucking shit. There are much better ways to show intense pleasure, so yes, I would.</br>  <br/>  This is a Japanese boy detective in a dress  with no underwear on <br><br>Fiend with Twenty Faces today</br></br>  <br>I wanna eat those up.</br>  welp looks like no live stream for us today, friends<br>Neet instead chose to stream a repeat of Kuusen Madoushi</br>  <br>I wonder if is it because the airing today is delayed 20 minutes?
