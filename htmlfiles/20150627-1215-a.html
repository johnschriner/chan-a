[ Which DD would you x?  Mai waifu   You mean mine.     Koneko     No, mine    Neither! Xenovia is best waifu   <br/>   Koneko doesn't have any D's though.    No....Mine.    But that's wrong     I never liked the D's in DxD they just look like implants from the 90's.     Left   We still have a thread use it.<br/>   It's correct.    Rias, Akeno and Irina at the same damn time.    Ross.   Serafall is best DxD    100 yen coin   not fine ass rias and sexy ass akeno  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ne8<wbr>DgiJdzCk</wbr>  [ ]     rias and rossweisse are best but rias is best   Silly rabbit, Akeno is for me.   Guys stop fighting over Akeno, her breasts are big enough for all of us.  I call dibs on Sona.    That's a negatory     It is fact.    This. Xenovia is best DXD.    Followed closely by Koneko.     asia for some reason.    This thread needs more Zenovia.      It's funny how they had to make Rossweisse a useless retard, so that she wouldn't steal the best girl status with that dynamite body.              You guys need to find yourselfs a new girl Akeno is mine             Anyone else waiting for BDs before they watch this for the first time?    Ophis.    Back the fuck out, m8. She stays with me    There can only be one.    Does she show up in the anime? I just started season 2. I don't know who she is but my penis is certainly familiar with her.    Posting best doujin   She does, she is in the 3rd season. I can't remember if she appears in season 2 though.    Eh, I've only ever read one ntr doujin that turned me on. Most of the time it's just too silly to be hot. HOW DO YOU ENJOY BEING FUCKED BY A TRUE MANS COCK INSTEAD OF HIS TINY LITTLE PECKER YOU FILTHY WHORE       Whatever, Issei impregnated his harem canon now.     Most of the time it's just too silly to be hot.  That one is even more hilarious considering it gets nothing right about DxD´s world, and the idea of a runt like Raizer ever being considered as leader of the underworld is just too funny to take seriously     in manga?   This one. After casting resurrection ofc.  And yes, M&amp;M Resurrection restores eradicated bodies.    Extra scene for the last episode in the Bds of S2 she shows up outside Issei´s house with Vali, its how they teased that S3 was going to happen.     Which DD would you x?   There is only one answer to that anon, all of them.  ALL OF  THEM except  ashy tits               Author confirmed on his blog.   http://ishibumi.exblog.jp/      I would like to bully Valkyrie. anyone else?   LNs   Only of bodies that matter. there is still no reason what so ever to bring back that pile of ashes back, specially considering that even asia can probably one shot her and turn her to ashes again        Stop being delusional   I'd like some Irina chan myself.   I would bully her by taking her to super expensive stores and buying her everything she sees    Usually, girls like Rias are my fetish, but for this show, I'm more interested in Koneko than all the others.   I love a show that has really.... eye catching eye catches.  What does it feels like?   bretty cruel mane.    Are you really asking what boobs feel like?  Boobs feels like a cantaloupe.      Bags of salty milk   Is this FAT TATS: the anime?   Pretty much    more like  ALL TATS: The anime.  the range of sizes is pretty good, even if the main focuse are big fat tats.       whichever one has the biggest DDs     Poor Sona looks so sad it's practically heartbreaking.    MAY DAY... MaY... daYy  THIS IS THE QUEEN XENOVIA      that view     Left is too yellow.    Its karma, Sona used to steal Ria's toys when they were small. But don worry Issei will give her a piece of the DxD from time to time to keep her happy     Small perky breasts are fine too.    I don't think Ishibumi is that cruel to Saji.  Otherwise we will see child who can control dragon water      Sona is great in threesomes because she balances out the girls she is usually paired with    I seriously hope not. Sona is a bitch for neglecting Saji.     Sona is a bitch for neglecting some one she never liked as anything but a brother    anon expecting her to like Saji is like expecting Rias to like Kiba.  And Saji neglects momo and twintails even harder, so i guess you dont want anyone to be happy.         why this season of dxd is so bad ? it feels like watching naruto fillers    Superior nordic girl    That's because it is fucking filler.    Saji tries so hard, but in the end, it doesn't even matter.   Rossweisse is not alone for C88, Rias getting another one. Can't post pictures because of lewd. http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51068763</wbr>   Loki ruined the anime. Fuck Loki.    becuase they decided to mesh together a bunch of arcs, and skip a couple others, so they could use the second half of the season for a shitty completly anime original filler arc that will have no fucking impact on the actual story because  LOL they wont remember anything that happened  but it will impact the audience becuase it steals the hype from some of the events that would happen in S4 if it ever gets made.     Would you let a horny cat suck your dick?   Dude Saji tries but in all the wrong ways, the mother fucker basically does backflips into the friendzone and then dives deeper and deeper into the otoutozone and puts weights around his feet just to be safe.  And its not like he doesnt have help, Issei tries to bring him up any time he is talking alone with Sona, but she has no interest at all in saji as anything but a member of her peerage.  Saji should have taken the two girls that are after his D and then get them to help him convert Sona, but instead he ignores them which in turn makes them plot agaisnt him ever getting together with sona and makes them shove issei more into sona's face so she will go after him.       https://jerutz.wordpress.com/slashd<wbr>og/</wbr>   Rias always gets a couple so thats no surprise.  lets hope the Ross one is good and not like the Irina one we got when S2 aired, the cover was pretty great and then it got scanned and it was shit.      Yes, whilst I pat her on the head.     Yes, whilst I pat her on the head.  and she grabs your hand with her tail to keep it there on her head     that explains everything  its not just him, overall new characters and the plot is weak hell i'm not watching this show for plot but god damn this level of story writing should be banned, even PLOT didnt deliver.   S4  After what i have just watched i'm not sure if want.  Also all girls are best girls Rias and Sona just happened to be my favorite             Well it isn´t totally bad, half of the season was good, we got neko sisters    Yes because it's her fault he keeps chasing her when she's never shown any interest.    That's not true.  What happened is a typical scene between two children.  one doesn't want to lend her toy. (Rias)   the other wants to play with it. (Sona)    In the end, the teddy bear's ear was torn off as they tugged on it and both cried:   Rias because the toy Sirzechs gave to her was damaged.   Sona because she was sorry for damaging the toy.             the level of fuck ups in the last 3 epiosodes overshadow the good things from the first half, hell not even the Oppai Dragon song took the shit taste off of the last episode.   yes at least we got Kuroka, and genki koneko out of it, and i guess a half assed soft Akeno  though that just pisses me off because there was no real build up or payoff either because of all the shit they skipped     Well at least now they are fighting over a much stronger teddy bear who can just fuck them both and keep them happy.           A cat is fine too.     Where is a japanese anime Gordon Ramsay when you need him  Someone needs to give a lesson to that studio     Ravel.   A cat is more than just fine.          I didn't like it because it made Issei look more than the typical oblivious harem protag he usually is in the LN. And that says something.    showdown with Sairaorg  New mobage event is teasing season 4 god damnit.          PLEASE MORE    The artist making the Ross one is pretty good in my opinion. I particularly liked the Daimidaler doujin he made.     THE ASS WAS FAT     tfw Rias doesn't do it for me   tfw can't fap to Rias at all   Only DxD I have yet to fap to   Other than me possibly being gay as fuck what the fuck is wrong with me?         <br/>      And that's all I could find for this event.    red heads might not be your thing?...but even then anon, i would be seriously worried, the gay might be starting to take you over.    You don't like motherly girls.    Red heads may not be your thing. She may be too much of an Onee-san.         YES        Season 4 when?   Sometime between Winter and Fall 2016.    I myself don't like Asia. Not because of her cockblocks (I know that won't get anywhere anytime even without her because harem series), but probably because she is too much of a nice girl without any thing else.    Irina     See? No one would post like this a few years ago. The cancer people bring from generals is astounding.     sauce?    his ass.     but probably because she is too much of a nice girl without any thing else.  I dont mind girls being too nice, but yeah she is too nice AND boring .  hell her tits have more personality than she does.      That S3 was laughably bad.   The sad part is that they had all the tools for a decent fun season but decided to just throw it all the fuck away for anime original shit.  they could have tweaked the sitri game to fix some of the things that they felt would not really work, work in some new things, and hell maybe even bring loki back for a final showdown at the end of the season, but nope they just went full retard with it.      How can you find AKENO of all things attractive and not find Rias attractive?     Akeno hater   I only browse and post in these threads occasionally, but even I think you are annoying.      let keep our fingers crossed then, in S2 we did get a couple of pretty good one like the Akeno one, the Asia one if you are into that particular fetish and even if not the art was good and mostly in character, and the harem one was nice as well .  I hope we get another good harem on and a good Xenovia, or Koneko one (no the gasper/koneko one is not good), basically for all the girls to get at least one good one would be nice.      Based on stalker points where the BDs(there are two editions for each format) have about 3.6k and the DVDs have 1k. It's pretty likely a season 4 is coming. Though I bet a winter or spring release. That's not even counting the other retailers where it constantly ranks.   Who would be the best wife?   Realistically speaking I'd say Rose due to her being the best at budgeting, but take it as you will      Wouldn't Rias be the obvious answer?    pretty much , yeah...unless you dont want a harem.   understanding   rich as fuck   sexy as fuck but still with a cute jelly side   lets you have a harem   awesome family so you dont have to worry about shitty inlaws   that said, the right answer is actually  all of them               Koneko doesn't have any D's though.   Anime only anons are so cute.        She will never ask you to monster battle her dad to break an engagement and then awkwardly tell you how cool you looked and try to ask you out on a date   Abe deserved so much more than what she got, I hope that with D2 we get some more side stories with her involved in them.      tfw she's been irrelevant for over 10 volumes now     It would be great if Issei had some issues with his dragon body and that they call her in to help him...or anything really.  then again we do have a blode ojousama with drills in the main cast already, so the posibilities of Abe being brought back are really really low which sucks because she would bring her monsters and their shenanigans which were always great to read about.  Its weird how hard she gets side tackled by Rias, considering she has been ok with most girls hanging around issei.        That side story happened right before volume 10 iirc so that explains why she acted like that.    It happened right before Volume 6. That's still a long way before Rias' drama acting up in v10.    Will we get a short OVA with her in it?   Maybe because she is human?       hmmm you might be right, it was too close to her limit and abe got hit with a bit of the backlash   nah, i think the anon above got it right in that it happened close to a time when Rias was in a emotional state and Abe just had bad luck.  also yeah lets hope that she shows up in an OVA or something.   the second side story with her and her father happened latter anon.            Oppai of Tennis happens after Volume 4 Issei SOS happens right before Volume 6    Non-DxDfag here. Can someone please post that screenshot of Loki (?) crying because someone she loved didn't wait for her, it gave me a heart attack but I didn't save it.   I ought to burn you alive for mistaking Rossweisse with Loki.    I'm very sorry. I just thought it'd be too vague without a name so I went with my closest guess. Thanks, though.     crying because someone she loved didn't wait for her  more like her boss left her behind.    faggot made another thread for it , but just in case some one still has not seeing it.  http://ishibumi.exblog.jp/23319433/<wbr>  6-part novel "Highschool DxD EX" was announced to be bundled with S3 BD.   Someone who calls Asia "Mother".  No idea if its her kid, or just another harem kid that just calls her mother as they were all probably raised together with all the girls being their "mothers"   Mysterious ○○ with black hair that uses lightning  Issei/Akeno's kid   Mysterious ○○ that has Holy sword Durandal Ⅳ  Issei/Xenovia's kid   Nekomimi ○○ in white kimono.   Nekomimi ○○ in black kimono.  Either Koneko had twins, or its one koneko and one Kuroka's kids with issei   Brown haired ○○ that has angel and dragon wings  Issei/Irina's kid   Red haired boy swordsman with dragon aura  Issei/Rias' kid   Symbols "○○" are used to hide character genders.  any bets on the sexes of the kids? besides Rias' , all girls? half and half?                      </wbr>     Because the BD extras are literally going to sell the season.    I'm worried there is no implied Ravel child.     mfw Oppai Dragon song on iTunes funds season 4 alone     boku no Ophis    【まとめ】アニメ第3期決定『ハイスクールD×D』雑誌掲載のレア情報、<wbr>付録、描き下ろし、連載など、雑誌情報のまとめは</wbr>   I don't speak moon, so if someone that does can please clarify this thank you. But this is something that's gonna be in next month's dragon magazine and if google is to be even slightly trusted, this says they're going to talk about the decision to go original this season.     Actually they all call Asia mother and the implication is that she dies in their timeline. So either Asia is barren as fuck, or she died before she could have her own child.    Kiryuu...she knows everything.     someone is called mom   it means she dies  that's quite the leap in logic namefag      where the hell is Rossweisse and  Raynare's  kids?    to be fair its a preview and showing an implied Phenex kid would ruing the current novel plot and straight up tell us that Ravel is ok and not to worry about it.   also no nord kid, or magician, etc.lets just wait for more info/ the actual thing to be out before worrying too much.     Asia is barren as fuck  Oh man, she aint anywhere close the top girls in my list but it would be kinda sad if she never had kids and had to watch all the other girls be happy with their kids and issei.           Come now, I leave you fags for a few months and you forget me?    あのヒトたち、私を悲しそうな瞳で見ていました。……けれど、どこか他人<wbr>ではないような――。</wbr>   アーシア・アルジェント   Those people are looking at me with sad eyes... but, it's not like the others -Asia Argento   アーシア……さんを絶対に救う!  I / We must absolutely save Asia!              Asia's useless ass dies again  So we're getting a whole change/save the future arc. Well it could be worse, we could get Loki returning. I wonder if it will be resolved in the 6 volumes or if it will become an arc for the main story.     Lots of new people in the threads because of S3, dont worry about it.  So they are back to save Asia? hmmmmm    ashes cant have kids anon, no matter how much you stick your dick in that useles pile of ashes nothing is going to happen.           Asia dies again  Unfortunately she won't stay dead.     The new god is apparently called Valvazoa and I think he's hostile. They're also facing monsters on which neither magic, nor senjutsu will work on. It's also ommited from the text which what part of the red dragon emperor's armaments Rias' son is using. It says that he denies his father's ways (possibly a male tsundere and involuntary owner of a harem back in his own timeline due to dragon swag) and he says that he's also not as soft as his father.     It also feels like Ishibumi turning around and going   Look they fuck, ok? at some point in the future Issei fucks them all so let me keep doing the story and dont worry about that for a while.      Also surprisingly Rias' edgelord son's sword is crimson colored.   No, this is described as a forbidden chapter. The author knows he's playing with fire, so he's testing the waters first. Expect this arc to end with a memory wipe and a complete reset back to ordinary life.    maybe its destruction magic condensed into a blade? it would be a cool gimmick for the gremories to have along side with Millicas who is probably more like his dad .  also  edgelord  wat?        I guess you can't really call him an edgelord, because all dragons and dragon power users are aggressive at heart, but with Issei he offsets it with being a huge perv. This kid is just being honest to his instincts. He says that he's going to cut all his enemies to death, but the way he says it makes it seem like he's going to destroy them rather than just slice them apart, so you might be right about the power of destruction thing. Another interesting thing is that the antagonist has a grudge against the Gremorys, not Issei the other children, but the bloodline of crimson red hair.     That untanned skin is ridiculously white    Well, he said first that  I'm not as soft as father  before  destroy them rather than just slice them apart   So, it's just Issei being Issei. And him being more aggressive.         He says "kirihorobosu" instead of "kirikorosu", which to me is strange.  He says he's going to "cut them to destruction" and I get the mental image of him literally cutting his enemies to mince meat, hence the edgelord remark. But damn he's aggressive.      New DxD comes out   It's a "Rescue Asia" episode      also remember that while issei had some dragon influence in him from the start he was not full/part dragon from birth, and that after he got the dragon body he did get a bit of a temper and went more into "RIP AND TEAR" mode, so the kids being dragons from birth might make them a bit more aggressive.   It might also be a case of the son trying to step out of his father's shadow so he tries to be different from issei and how he would aproach things.  the villain is probably linked to the old satan faction? maybe the lucifuges?    even if this ends up being a "wipe their memories" type of deal, it already seems WAY more interesting than the anime's wipe their mind arc we just got.            No, it's a "save the future" episode. Saving Asia is just an afterthought, like "don't let her fall down the stairs bro".  Even Koneko's kittens are like that too, they don't hold back from the start.      What's the white kimono saying? I can't quite figure it out.    So yeah, if all the kids are like that its probably more about them being dragons than him being an edgelord.   Its all good anon, we also get  harem end confirmation   Issei fucking and having kids with the girls confirmation   Issei bringing a new age of dragon hybrids overlords to the underworld confirmation   so them going "oh by the way, do not stick that fork in the outlet" and saving Asia is fine.            Technically, all the kids would be devil instead of dragon. Issei got reincarnated into a devil again, remember? The way it works is that he is basically a devil with dragon traits, like Tannin.    ...This unpleasant feeling. I knew it it's not only them, but the one from before as well? -White kimono cat-ears That's fine nyan. I'm not holding back. -Black kimono cat-ears  The text does not mention their hair colors however, but black talks like Kuroka.       Hmm. Okay. That also the impression that I was getting but I was unsure of it as I don't know what they're talking about.  So, based on that, an enemy that they've already fought before in the future, and once again met now that they've come back to the past?      Most likely, seems the story is following a stereotypical timetravel crisis plot. They're going to the past to squash an enemy that will become a major threat in the future.    Yeah, I think it describes the insights into what caused the changes for BorN. I'm interested in hearing about this.   It's more like to set the basis for what the sequel series could entail. Also, there is the whole Millicas story he would want to do, so maybe he combines both.       I'm not sure if TNK is gonna be honest or just damage control.    They don't need to damage control, DxD X is going to practically sell the volumes for them.    Damage controlling can get us better budget for next season. It's fucking worth it.    Holy fucking shit anon, that's amazing quality.    Yeah damage control to cool down fans more than to secure sales.    Where are you getting your info from? I haven't seen anything new on the wiki or animesuki so I'm assuming you know Japanese.   That'll be quite interesting to hear about. Whenever it's out, hopefully someone posts scans or just summarizes the info for us.       Those are all from Ishibumi's blog and making inferences off of that.    Next month apparently. There's a website that usually announces the monthly magazines and what they entail. I'll keep an eye out for it.    http://ishibumi.exblog.jp/23319433/<wbr>  I'm N5 according to some. I know kana, suck at kanji and sentence structure, but I can watch anime without subs. Together with OCR and TA/googletrans I am able to make out the contents of texts.  </wbr>    Also I would like to mention that DxD has very simple Japanese, so I don't think I missed much from the previews. I'm used to mahouka, now that's fucking nightmare of a text to interpret.    What's TA?  I for one know kana and nothing else. I just use OCR, jisho, and different online translators.   And so far, everything that I know about DxD are all correct (main Volumes and short stories).  Started reading using this method since v16 as that was the time the translation halted)         Translator Aggregator, uses several different online translators. Googletrans and Honyaku are the most reliable to be honest. For manga I use KanjiTomo OCR, it's a fucking pain in the ass. For OCR mining I use another program and proofread from the source as I go along.      KanjiTomo OCR, it's a fucking pain in the ass.  It sure is.  I guess I'll give Honyaku a try when v20 comes out. I use Google trans and Bing trans.        Link?     I use several. TA gathers the texts these online translators print out and presents them in the window of the application. When you're using more than one translators you can cross-reference and weed out errors.    I'm the anon who originally found it. Some nip on twitter posted about it with the hashtag haremking and that's where I got the info.  This is what he linked to: http://za4.ch/tag/haremking      Ah, Twitter. So much info has been gotten from Jap fans there since BorN started. Thanks.    Is it a random nip? I usually see it posted from the official twitter of the magazine/website that announces it.    xD   Fuck off.     Every thread.    It was some random nip but the website he linked looked pretty believable to me.   Who thinks little red is being introduced now because Issei is going to stick it to Rias in V20?   I want to marry Rias   Rias, no contest.   We can only hope anon.    It's certainly possible. First half fuck Rias, second half watch your parents die, I don't think I could ask for a better volume. Ishibumi always manages to top himself somehow though.    I think the Rias fucking might be later because of the whole "becoming one" and "sharing power" thing.    EX is more of a foreshadow to the characters that will be in the sequel series. Also, since the time flow will be altered to deal with the enemy in the past, things will play out differently in the future. Issei's kids will be there, but the events that made them go to the past won't.    Excellent taste anon,  but she's my waifu     Reminder that this scene will be animated.   Friendly reminder that 8 more days 'till DxD might get licensed.  I'm gonna be pissed if they actually don't    Maybe he won't hate Issei and be less of an ungrateful faggot.    Considering how popular the anime/manga has been here in America, licensing the novel would be the smartest thing they could do and would help fund us more money for a god damn proper season 4. Even though that money doesn't even go to the anime...    If they licensed the manga, then there should be no problems with the light novel, why it hasn't been done yet, no idea. Especially since the manga ranks in the New York Times best sellers list, along with the anime being a best seller for Funimation also.    I think they were waiting for the anime hype to announce the licensing, like they did with Mahouka. I know they'll license it really soon, I'll just be pissed if it isn't at AX since I've been hyping it for weeks.     would help fund us more money for a god damn proper season 4.   Eh, that won't be a problem. Going by these numbers.

Heck, I have't seen anything regarding EX on twitter from the nips. I wonder if they even read Ishi's blog/know about it?    He said something about the benefits of the BD's but never specifically said EX. Well hopefully some of them find out that it's in it and go to buy it after release. If I would read moon and lived over there, I sure as hell would buy them for it.    Elevens don't like talking about things before they come out.    You posted them, OP.      My niggas    Good taste             I keep hearing anons use this term, although I feel a lot of them have different ideas of what it means.  I'd assume it's when a show has a dramatic event occur when it probably shouldn't, possibly because it doesn't feel natural for the characters to act this way under that circumstance.  If so, can someone point to examples in shows like Clannad and White Album 2, where the drama feels "forced"?      It's just a meme and we all love memes over here.   Welcome to /a/.  We understand that some part of our terminology can be considered obscure by outsiders, and at times their meaning are counter-intuitive. We sincerely hope that this image helps you to understand a part /a/'s board culture.      Drama I don't like other people liking.    I almost feel sorry for the people that actually sat through Clannad. "Let's force all the emotions that were conveyed from a VN that was around 300 hours long and shove them into an anime."   It's very literally what it says it is.  Think of it like this  Character A has a problem that could easily be resolved if he talked to Character B. Instead he says it's nothing and runs off and causes shit to get worse.  If you're narrative can only progress because the characters are acting stupid then it's forced         Clannad did feel pretty forced due to the whole magical Key AIDS thing. Basically, I'd define it as when unrealistic things happen solely to force the story to change mood or direction abruptly, especially when not adequately foreshadowed. The best example, imo, would be faking that no time had passed after a girl wakes up from a multiple year-long coma in Kiminozo.    Things that aren't a big deal being treated as though they were a big deal    "Key AIDS"? Ahh... Nagisa's condition, right?    It's exactly what your second line says. When they act out-of-character, specifically for the literary purpose of creating more emotional situations.  What counts as "in-character" can be debatable when viewers interpret things differently, which is where all the shitflinging arguments come in. Sage because everyone already knows this and there's not really a point to discussing it.      It'd be fine if they didn't try to shoe-horn in the whole "she died because they built a hospital" bullshit. It would have still been shit, because the character writing was awful 9 times out of 10, but it wouldn't have been forced.   <br/>   That's melodrama  Forced drama is drama that doesn't feel natural. The best recent example I can think of was in Plastic Memories where there was a long tearful goodbye in the first episode.  Despite the fact that we've just met this character everyone treats her "death" as a total tragedy but as the audience it's kind of hard to care when there wasn't enough time to be attached.  It's a major disconnect between the audience reaction and the characters' reaction. So it feels like forced drama.          The VN isn't meant to take 300 hours, unless your Japanese isn't very good and you're using it to practice.    Forced drama is for myself a narrative story based term rather than the characters. For example, Tomoyo, having a bad relationship with his dad, and Nagisa being ill and struggling with school is fine.  But then heap on her dying due to having a baby when she couldn't moves for weeks on end, at what point did the writer think that wouldn't be fatiguing on top of Tomoyo losing a job opportunity and all the other stuff.  Also Nagisa deciding to have a baby was balls to the wall retarded. Then said baby   dying   it culminates in being abit over the top and trite.         Despite the fact that we've just met this character everyone treats her "death" as a total tragedy but as the audience it's kind of hard to care when there wasn't enough time to be attached.   This is exactly what Cross Game did, yet people say the first episode is one of the most emotional things ever.     Forced drama can fall into one of three categories.  1.) A dozen horrible things happen at the same time or over a short period to somebody/some people, in a way that seems overly cruel and over the top tragic for the sake of being as over the top cruel and tragic as possible. Ex. - On the day of his marraige, anon-kun's wife to be was gunned down outside the chapel by a random passing psychopath just as his childhood friend was run over by a speeding Japanese truck on her way to the church. His mother took the news so hard that she died from a heart attack while his father was kidnapped by his wife's murderer and brainwashed into a cyborg bent on killing the MC!  2.) A situation that can easily be resolvable, or not pop up at all if characters act even vaguely like Human Beings do, but cuhrazy anime misunderstandings or those characters acting completely out of character result in simple situations turning needlessly melodramatic.  3.) Usually plot and/or setting related instead of character-related, but when the setting or backdrop for whatever story is being told just requires so much suspension of disbelief that any drama that results from the story unfolding feels like you, the reader/viewer is being told at gunpoint "THIS WILL BE A DRAMATIC, TRAGIC STORY! ARE YOU CRYING YET!? WE WILL MAKE YOU!!" Look at Plastic Memories this season, where the setup of the universe with the androids just made little sense to anyone watching.        It's a catch-all term used by one of the various hiveminds of 4chan to justify shitposting about a work that is generally considered good.    hyperbole     I forgot to mention that autistic people can't into drama.    I could honestly see it taking that long if you don't use a guide and go for every route and ending     "Key AIDS"? Ahh...   Ahh...   ...  Get out you retard.        and go for every route and ending  That is the prime directive of playing VNs.     Underrated post   picture related   Then go get an actual gf you permavirgin.    I think every single conflict in Clanned can be called 'forced drama' Things like 'You didn't get the job because your dad's an asshole' Or people say they get sad when Ushio dies. But I'm still not sure what she died from or why she died. She was just sick? Sick with what? She was just weak, like her mom?  Seems more like the writers just wanted to set up a situation purely just to make the audience feels sad.  1) introduce character 2) make audience like character. 3) Remove character so audience can be sad.  Then you got people saying "But that's drama. You don't understand because you have autism." No, it's not that I don't understand drama. It's you that doesn't understand shit writing.                Well you don't understand drama and you probably do have autism.     permavirgin  How is this an insult?     The best and most clear example of forced drama is Kokoro Connect.  There are emotional conflicts that otherwise wouldn't have been brought up if it weren't because of an external force in the person of Heartseed literally forcing drama with his supernatural bullshit just to observe their behavior.      Most virgins at least have the potential to lose their virginity sometime in the future. You don't.     You forgot about forced animation.     Forced drama = melodrama.    Don't worry Anon. Just enjoy what you watch and interpret it the way you see it. Everyone's preferences are different. Don't sweat it and watch out for autists and edgelords    ushio died, pls cry and be sad. she will revive later but be sad anyway   Forced drama at its finest      if the world doesn't end after highschool I get confused and angry     Forced drama = contrived for the sake of drama.       Ask why does he thinks X is an insult   gives the literal definition of the word  Fucking retarded, that is what you are. Oh, and anyone with a few buck can lose their virginity in a couple of minutes.       So melodrama.    Literally what happened with lucky star  ;_;     This guy talks from experience. Congrats faggot!    Yet you haven't.    No, melodrama is when you make a big issue out of something that's not a big issue.    So you don't even know what melodrama is. Why do you think you have room to talk about a field in which you have no knowledge?    Tee shit I masturbate to tells me I'm no fag, unlike you.   Indeed.       So contrived for the sake of drama.    Wasn't Kokoro Connect the anime on which people coined the term "forced drama"?    typical butthurt yaharifag. yahari s2 is forced drama     that first paragraph   Fuck, I'd watch that, if it spiraled into balls-to-the-wall action.       Contrivance and exaggeration are not the same thing.    A lot of people, especially anime fans, like to project themselves onto characters, plot lines, and so on. This is why a lot of MCs are betas, a lot of females are sluts, a lot of plots are forced dramas; because the average viewer doesn't watch the show for what it is. Instead, in every opportunity, they think "I wouldn't do that, that's wrong" instead of considering the character's motivation and place in the plot.   I mean, I wouldn't expect this from /a/, but it happens very it often.    Another recent example of forced drama: Senketsu burning away in kill le kill    it was the anime where people started to use the term a whole lot more because of the whoe fiasco with one of its VAs.     "Forced Drama" is the part of these shows that makes them shit. Does that make sense?    And this statement has what to do with anything?    They can be though.    That's not forced drama that's you know.. plot. You could say any antagonistic force in any work is essentially "forcing drama" onto the main cast.    It existed way way before then. I cannot recall but I think the first time I saw it was around the time Kanon was airing, when uguu was prevalent. I could be bullshitting though.    Are you trying to fuck with me right now?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127223803   ...  Just kill yourself already and then get back to whatever shithole you came from.     Your response to either situation?     wanting to get a gf  Holy shit anon.     Why are you playing romance adventure games if you don't one day wish to acquire a gf?    You need to get at least one gf to get some perspective about the world.    Women are awful is an easy lesson to learn. Why would you wish that on poor sweet anon?     And just one should be enough to make you realize the truth of 3dpd.    <br/>    I get your point but I think the plot was forced drama. You could argue that any conflict arisen by an external force is forced drama, but you have to take account the mechanism in which the conflict is brought up.  It has to be believable and reasonable inside the world where the characters live in and it must have internal consistency. I believe Kokoro Connect was poorly executed in that respect.  I liked the show, mind you, but that doesn't mean that it could have been better if the mechanism that sets the plot going wasn't so outlandish.         Not really. If you find yourself a nice girl you can learn about life. 3DPD is an awful meme that encourages people to ignore the good things about relationships.     Fucking retarded, that is what you are. Oh, and anyone with a few buck can lose their virginity in a couple of minutes.   Tee shit I masturbate to tells me I'm no fag, unlike you.    Just kill yourself already and then get back to whatever shithole you came from.    Edgelord confirmed.              <br/>   Forced drama is definitely a thing but the shows that get called out don't fall into that category.   Because one thing is 2D, and other completely different and horrendous one is 3D.   That's like telling that you need to fuck a horse to have a perspective about sex.   Nice quotes there.            normalfags redirecting people to normalfag boards   Is this real life?        That's like telling that you need to fuck a horse to have a perspective about sex.   That's a very awful analogy and immediately tells me you've never had an actual sexual intimacy.      When something is thrown in out of nowhere or to any reasonable person wouldn't be dramatic. Usually it's just when they want to add tension but have poor or no buildup.  Then of course you just have times it's just thrown around because lolmeme        /r9k/   normalfag board  Is this some sort of new meme?       and immediately tells me you've never had an actual sexual intimacy.  American reading comprehension, everyone.     Most people use the term to describe plot developments they don't like.  Originally, the term was used for poorly thought-out or contrived plot elements. Stuff like Nagisa getting magic aids with minimal foreshadowing in the anime and existing solely to cause angst for Tomoya was a good example.     It means "nnot enough lolis fisting each other to stimulate my manchild mind' just ignore it    Forced drama is an overused term, but it generally means when unlikely circumstances or behavior conspire to create melodrama. Like when a character conveniently dies in order for another character to emotionally grow from their death.      implying not   Every thread on /r9k/ these days is about relationship shit. The wizards are gone.      If it's animated by SHAFT     tfw no gf threads   not normalfag-tier       HURR HAVING SEX WITH A HORSE IS SEXUAL INTIMACY   not permavirgin   Look, I know it's hard for you to understand, but girls and sexual intimacy are actually great things. If you want to cling to a shitty meme to define your sexuality that's up to you.        minimal foreshadowing  So you're saying everyone who watched Clannad and didn't like it is an idiot?     /v/ is filled with contrarians, not normalfags, get it right.   Fucking normalfags are shitting up this thread itself with forced drama.    great things  How about you watch legends of the galactic heroes, buy a body pillow, and lurk some more before you say your life style is better. If you want to cling to societal norms to define your sexuality that's up to you.     /v/ is reddit. Redditors are as normalfag as you get.   Just watch plastic memories and every time somebody is crying whatever's on the screen will be an example of forced drama   How else would you define your sexuality? By fapping all day to lolis? You need to at least have some actual contact with another human being to understand sexuality as a whole. Like, this isn't even normalfag territory, this is human being territory.   As I said before, I understand your need to cling to a meme in order to validate your sexual identity based on a fucking image board, but if you haven't even held hands or kissed another human being, why would anyone listen to your lessons on human sexuality?      The foreshadowing tying Nagisa's health to the town, especially with how extreme her aids was, was pretty poor. This is mainly because the anime left out a lot of secondary stuff in the VN and entire routes.     girls are great things   yeah great at draining your wallet like a vacuum      So can we start calling people who make anti-Clannad posts secondaries? That's what I'm going to do.    Not even that guy, but sexuality is a social construct. Ultimately, it's your life, and you just do what you want to do with it.    I can only imagine what kind of girls you've dated (or not) before. Fucking awful taste either way, anon.    Redditors have a hidden sub-section where pedophiles gather to share and trade child pornography, I don't think that's normalfag at all.    Go right ahead, because the VN wasn't very good either.    begone succubus there's no money for you to get here    sexuality is a social construct  &gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/  Anyway, you can do what you want with it, but you have to admit past a certain point, you have no fucking clue what you're talking about.        Fuck off, secondary.    If you want to shit post, then go ahead. Not like it's any different from your usual posting style.    You're literally saying "You haven't lived this way so you're life must be shit, you don't understand this" But I could say the same to you. Unless you actually try it how can you say the way that YOU live is better? You can't.     is this thread forced drama?   I'd say proper foreshadowing and development alone doesn't disqualify something from being forced drama. It relies more on suspension of disbelief, because if something was created solely just to push suffering and angst across, no matter how well foreshadowed, it's still forced drama.    Shut up, Dad!    Well your life is shit, and you don't understand this. Are you going to refute this?    Yours probably isn't much better if this is what you do for fun     If you want to cling to societal norms to define your sexuality that's up to you.    How else would you define your sexuality?   Obviously you have no idea what a social construct is, and think it's just a buzzword, since you were literally arguing for the same exact thing.       How about that scene early on when Nagisa wants to play basketball. It's raining but she shows up anyways, Tomoya gets down on his knees and says his arm is fucked and then Nagisa passes out. Would that be considered forced drama?   This.    You anti-Clannad posters discredit your own opinions by yourselves, I don't even need to be here.    But I enjoy my life. Who are you to tell me I'm wrong?    Unless you actually try it how can you say the way that YOU live is better? You can't.  That has nothing to do with what I'm saying. I'm expecting the very fucking MINIMUM.  Have you ever experienced your sexuality to the fullest? Have you ever held a panting girl in your arms? Have you ever held hands with someone? No? Then you have no reason to be talking about sexuality, my man. It's that simple.   I'm not even asking you to live your life a certain way, I'm asking the very minimum of what's needed and you haven't even experienced that. Do please keep going, though, I'd love to know what a /r9k/ virgin has to say.           Obviously you have no idea what a social construct is, and think it's just a buzzword,    Fuck off, Tumblr, sexuality is a very real thing, and you're just clinging to internet definitions for the sake of your online identity which doesn't even matter in a anonymous context, fucking retard.     Would you watch an animr where a METRICK ASSFUCKYON off lolis have a tea party. However each tea cup is secretly a biogenetic mecha alien and when they begin to drink their tea. The lolis fuse with the biotech tea cups and become gigantic mecha. And I'm not talking some faggot Mobile Suit shiy I'm talking LOLIS BIGGET THAN GURREN LAGANN. okay now for the good part. The lolis can only power up and use attacks by farting. The difference in fart determines the type of attack. like a little pomf is just a simple punch whereas a long wet shitty fart is a big magma canon and when the lolis learn how to queef somewhere around episode 745 (this would be a very long show) they begin to level up and get so bug they transcend dimensions  The name would be Ultimate Biogenetic Fartbots in Infinite Universes aretoo Cute as they Obliterate Eachother with Dank Stenches!     hes a normalfag. They tend to get pretty angry and obnoxious whenever somebody does anything that isn't "socially acceptable"    I agree with Clannad. The writing was very contrived in hindsight, and I actually quit on it once I got the gist of where the plot was headed.  But that's kind of a testament to Key's writing in general. It's VNshit and that medium isn't exactly known for it's prestigious storytelling.       Also Nagisa deciding to have a baby was balls to the wall retarded.   Now I know you are full of shit. Why wouldn't she want a baby?     Why is she so perfect?   FAT TATS   Pork Banger go away   Make me    perfect   cowtits   topkek       Implying she isn't perfect   Even Karin knows     Isane is the best and most perfect Bleach girl.   BROTHER     Isane is pretty great. Tall and great tits, what more can you ask for? I wish we saw more of her, when was the last time she showed up?    Would lose my dick inbetween those titties.   At least a few chapters ago. She is with Urahara's group along with her little sister.    Who wouldn't?    Not liking best girl      Neliel   Isane   Kukkaku   Tatsuki   Lisa   how could she be perfect when there are so many better girls?          She is not        BRETHREN     we all know best girl is gone and forgotten for good    airhead with huge tits  Yeah, real fucking perfect.     With god-powers     her face   or rather   everyone's faces as the anime kept going         that she doesn't ever use to it's logical potential    I'd push her to the limit, if you know what I mean    I want to violate her.     I want to violate that watermelon...    She's brought people back from the dead, what more do you want?    She never did that.    Pretty sure Menoly and Loly were killed by Grimmjow. Ichigo may or may not have been killed by Ulquiorra.       samefagging this awkwardly   liking a girl with an unfinished haircut and zero relevance for anyone  Kill yourself         Dem lips   Whatever happened to her anyway?       I will forever be salty that Orihime joined the team instead of Tatsuki.     She was perfect until the chapter she appeared in.    Wow, Karin's standards are so low. She might as well say "bring anything with a hole".    Yeah she should rather say that ichigo should bring a little boy home like rukia     Pure sex.     Rukia's shit too, so why bother.       Because Kubo morphed her into Okusan.     Mayuri is truly a genius.    I wonder where he got his inspiration      Some people used to theorize that he was inspired by Unohana because of the single braid, but he probably just has good taste.    /fit/ vale tudo chick. What more could you want?    My dick approves.    I like how she's the only Shinigami who wears a skirt. Mayuri definitely has good taste.     accepted back into gotei just in time for quincy invasion   only vizard to be shown still using her mask   hasn't been in a fight all arc  Why Kubo       Did she get killed off panel or something?    no she just hasn't done anything    Fantastic shitposting, OP.    But she's not.     no vanilla doujins  Feels bad     Literally, whos?    In before Nemu is just a female Mayuri      Didn't we see Mayuri naked for a like 5 seconds?    Will she ever kiss Ichigo?  How will the both of them react?       tries to kill strawberry   lips can't touch because of her udders   strawberry dumps her for rukia        kill  fuck. meant to type kiss     And he had purple/black hair just like Nemu       implying he didn't almost die from a hug from her or Nel     I would  marry  Rukia so fucking hard    You perv   rise      tries to kill strawberry   Plot twist, Orihime is a double agent.      I would twist her double agent plots, if you know what I mean.    Because she never got raped by Broly! :)      In what way is she not perfect? She's so kind, emphatic, funny, cute, beautiful, gorgeous, sexy. Even with a hard life, she continues to smile and so shine the light of perfection into her friends lives. I love her.                                  Reading that in her voice makes it funnier.  Her dubbed voice.                        The image dump is much appreciated, a lot of these are new to me             I think I actually requested that in one of the drawthreads.                Didn't her attack work by denying the fusion of matter? Why not mix it with her healing ability to create an attack that reverses the target to a point of non-existance or just a weaker state? She could effectively become the reverse of Barragan    She planned to remove the Hogyoku from existence, but the chance never came up. I don't think Kubo knew what he was doing during the Heuco Mundo arc.      I will forever be annoyed that nothing came of that, it would've been the perfect moment for Orihime. At least have her attempt to destroy it.         I don't think Kubo knew what he was doing during the Heuco Mundo arc.   implying Kubo ever knows what he's doing        That momo is wrong.       Orihime   Red Dress  The night is dark and full of terrors.           Orihime down for a threesome        implying she wouldn't be                I didn't watch much bleach but while I did she was totally my favorite.   People still think anyone will win the Ichibowl           I like the idea mentioned sometimes in these threads of him becoming one of her fairies and throwing lanzas around. But we'll probably never see him again.     I'd actually laugh if that ends up happening            Can we at least agree this outfit is fucking stupid?             Top tier   I like some elements of its design, but I don't like that she was tricked into putting on something she's uncomfortable with. Fuck Urahara.    It's stupidly hilarious though.                 What a comfy thread     She was tricked into putting it on? I can't even remember anymore. This arc has been such a blur that I thought she was wearing it for the first time when she showed up with Chad a few chapters back.          I like that it shows her midriff, cleavage, and side boob but it does look silly as a whole.   I don't think she was uncomfortable with it as much as she's uncomfortable with what she thinks it makes Ichigo think of her.   She did but it was revealed that Urahara designed it for her and told her Ichigo would be happy to see her in it so she wore it.                     filename   Suit in picture is a club  Was that supposed to be b8, anon?        I have not played cards in a long, long time.         my niggas                You will never feed Orihime donuts   Hold me.      Let's not make this depressing.      Probably a good idea.                       Dat hair     Truly beautiful, perfect.                           <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127222995   coming to /a/ for lewds  Orihime is not for lewds.       I would tip her 100%          No you dummy, he made her look like that royal guard girl. The one who has a bunch of spider arms. That way he has a version of her that he can bully and it makes him feel good.      She's one of the smartest students in her entire school        Based on those rankings in the early episodes she's 3rd behind Ishida and the class president girl. Apparently its because she gets money from her distant family who give it to her based on her grades. Kind of fucked up way condition for an orphan if you ask me.                    Fucking leek spin     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127223342  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127223392  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127223430  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127223460  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127223539  Gotta try harder than that.        Did you know that meme has its own wikipedia page? Orihime is the only Bleach character with two pages, as a result.                                         Jesus, look at that image dump.   unlimited cowtits works   do you have enough autism, pork of rangers?                       Her manga color scheme is way better than the anime one.

Capture2Text - Another OCR program.  *Interactive Text Hooker - This allows you to extract text from Japanese games as it’s being displayed. The extracted text is put in your clipboard for an application like Translation Aggregator to make use of it. Designed for reading VNs, so it will not work for most non-VN type games and unsupported engines.  *Translation Aggregator - Usually used for machine translation, but in your case, you’ll be using JParser (preferably with Mecab hinting) to help you parse Japanese sentences and enable you to easily look up words in the same fashion as with Rikaichan and the like.  You want the ITHooker, is a program that extracts the text for you. Please do look harder next time and save yourself the embarassment, faggot. (Seriously, look in the guide and you will find it)                    You made a pretty big post just to show that you don't know what you're talking about.    Are you retarded? Most of it is just copypasted from Guide.   What's a polite way of calling out to a stranger? 君? そこの人?   すみませーん～    It's only big due to the copy paste.   If anon has a problem using ITH to extract the text, perhaps he should post about that specifically instead of "how the fuck do I do this"      Just say あの to get their attention. You don't have to address them with a noun.    He clearly wants to get the whole script extracted so that he can analyze it for frequency or something, not just to get single lines at a time with a text hooker.   What do you guys make of this deck? https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/285<wbr>901155  I'm a vocab-fag that is thinking of learning individual kanji to make things easier.  </wbr>    Yeah, too bad you completely misunderstood what I meant.  I'm not looking to extract the text of a VN as I go - I'm looking to extract the ENTIRE script at once. ITH does not do that unless you manage to go through all possible scenes in the game. The VERY REASON I want to do this in the first place is to save the trouble from constantly typing up words in a .txt file and adding them into anki at once when I can already have a pre-made wordlist that's been arranged by frequency. It saves the problem of ever needing to 'mine on the spot'.  I don't mind if you try to be a condescending faggot, but at least give some proper advice instead of assuming that everybody who asks for a help is a newfag who has problems installing VNs or getting basic text-hooking to work.        There's some resources on TLwiki that might help you but I haven't used them.    Both this and Kanji Damage is a good deck if you have trouble distinguishing kanji. I'd say you don't really have to learn the readings, just learn all the shapes. This way you can breeze through it all pretty easily. You'll learn all the reading when learning vocab either way.    forums.fuwanovel.net/topic/4887-dat<wbr>a-extraction-thread/  To add onto this, I've tried both Crass (which supposedly works for all the Circus games - I managed to exact the CGs but not the script using this program) and ExtractData but have been unsuccessful so far.  Here's a few images of Fortissimo's directory, if you're interested. Either I'm unable to pinpoint the location of the script file, or its just jumbled in. Maybe I've already tried to extract the correct file, but it doesn't get extracted.  http://imgur.com/nvemArN,dStV7Aj,qx<wbr>Hi8JT,UVW1uok,ZkFU0mu,NeHZV7o,cRzwp<wbr>bI,Do69D9c,V6Z68up,ONtRxOQ,aTJKLHk</wbr></wbr>      </wbr>     Just out of curiosity, is there a way to play VNs in web browser? Just like you can watch movies/anime and read LNs in browser for easy Rikaisama texthooking (JNovel Parser and http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.p<wbr>hp?id=13318).</wbr>   you're joking     I'm already about 2000 words into core 6k, is it really going to be beneficial picking up individual kanji learning this late?  Also, the first word in the examples of this kanji. Where does the ゆ come from in 梅雨. From what I can see on the card the only readings are う, あめ、あま and さめ. Is ゆ just a morphed う reading in this sense? (Sorry for the odd question, just trying to get to grips with how this thing works)       tuyu? No...UMEAMA!   I just bought all the N2 Shin Kanzen Master books, what am I in for?   Yes, here : http://hima.gptouch.com/games/juras<wbr>sic_heart/</wbr>    A guide to reach second rate japanese skills    1)You are still far away from 40k, so it's not to late.  The important part is whether you have trouble distinguishing kanji or not. If you don't then learning kanji with RTK/KD won't be beneficial for you.  2)Kanji have lots of readings, textbooks/decks only teach the most common readings.        Well obviously they aren't materials that target N1 or post-fluency, but I was just wondering about anyone's experience with them.    I meant something that would let you play any game in browser.     2)Kanji have lots of readings, textbooks/decks only teach the most common readings.  This doesn't really answer his question, since つゆ is just an exceptional case that has nothing to do with any of the readings for 梅 or 雨      I'm already about 2000 words into core 6k   is it really going to be beneficial picking up individual kanji learning this late  You've hardly started.        Just learn radicals.       I burned out at chapter 2   2 or 3 three weeks       Ha, yeah I know. I'm at the start of my journey, but I do find that I often don't look at the individual kanji, more remembering the shape of the jukugo as a whole. When I see 自転車 I don't recognize it as being made up of 自、転　and 車 I just see 自転車 which could easily be confused with any other 3 kanji jukugo with a similar shape. I'm hoping learning individual kanji will help this.  Do you ever get to a point where you don't know the reading of a word but you know what it means from the meanings of the kanji? Like with 自転車. Would you see it as self-quick-vehicle or something stupid like that and be able to guess from there without knowing it is じてんしゃ        I also like the comment about the terrible mental stress of worrying that you may have forgotten what you're supposed to say when you get back home.    I was in a similar situation (perhaps worse even) and learning Kanji individually completely erased that problem.  Or do that  .      I actually thought it was sarcastic but now that I'm reading it again it does sound genuine. 怖いよ。     Do you ever get to a point where you don't know the reading of a word but you know what it means from the meanings of the kanji? Like with 自転車. Would you see it as self-quick-vehicle or something stupid like that and be able to guess from there without knowing it is じてんしゃ  I suggest you don't rely on that. More often than not you won't even get close to the meaning.  As for the your other question, you can learn Kanji with a method very damn fast if you know what you're doing, I don't know about KD but RTK gives you meanings, radicals and stroke order in one fell swoop and you can do the first book in about 40 days with a pace of 50 as long as you're using Koohii for mnemonics.        I know the radicals, but it still doesn't help when encountering kanji like 二階 because I have no fucking clue what 階 means, even with radicals.      Do you ever get to a point where you don't know the reading of a word but you know what it means from the meanings of the kanji?  Having gone through Kanjidamage, it's more like... Self-car running over a beheaded cow-car... ah! I myself drive my BIKE over dead cows feeling like a car! got it! next word please!     And this is why you use RTK.     you can never have too firm of a foundation  Oh, thank goodness. I thought the last 10 years spent exclusively on learning the subtle nuance of は might have been a bit of a waste.      苛めないでください これでも努力はしてるんだから      Whatever works for you, but for me the stupid stories make it way easier to remember stuff.    No, thank you.    So you can work out a jukugo from two kanji you already "know", but you can't work out a kanji from 2 radicals you already "know"? Sorry bro, you're retarded.    That particular statement is spot on though. You could've picked anything else of that to act like a smartass.    A foundation taken from textbooks is completely worthless for a language.  The best way to learn is to use the textbook as reference for real material that will make the concepts stick faster. Then you're done with the "foundation" in a week.      My thoughs exactly.    implying rtk doesn't rely on stupid stories  The radical meanings don't differ much from the real thing. And RevTK stories are way better mnemonics than KD ones.        Those silly stories in Kanjidamage, or the ones you make up yourself are really useful at first. I would try to unlearn them after a while and concentrate on readings and Jukugo tho.    Do RTK or KD then, anon. I'm serious, if it's really bothering you then do one of them. You won't regret it. And ignore this .     It's not really a case of "unlearning" anything. They naturally fade as you become able to recall the kanji's meaning and readings without them.  Mnemonics are like support structures to make neurons grow faster. Once you've got the connection, they naturally die off.      I agree that you shouldn't rely on textbooks but reading real material with only a flimsy understanding is not okay either. You should do both to have a good foundation and way to practice it. The so called "eternal beginner syndrome" applies when you don't read or listen to native material but formal study will never stop being beneficial.   reminder that you'll always be a doorknob scratcher    they naturally die off  just like neets     T-thanks...     I never claimed to be able to make out a jukugo from two kanji. I only did vocab. 10 for effort.      doesn't want to scratch those knobs     I think formal study can very easily fall into a loop of very slow "I'll get there eventually" progression, where it takes you a month to read a fucking chapter and you've already forgotten the start before you're at the end. So you restart, only to never really learn anything. What matters most in my eyes is challenging new material, instead of spending a year on a foundation that never really gets out of the starting gate.    おやって見て親と間違ってはただのバカしちゃったってじゃないよ！  あんたは自分で分かるんだろう、そのほのかな頭脳でどう日本語を習うつもり<wbr>か？出来ないだろう お前にもだれにも出来ないことがあっても越そうとしなければならないのだ！<wbr>もっとゲームをステップアップしないとなんともならない！  さあーぐずぐずするなって！ゴミの上へ上げれ！立て！レップして読め！何の<wbr>他のことでもしてはいけないのだ！日本語で食べて日本語で吐いて日本語で生<wbr>きて行けよ！  お前こそ出来るから諦めるな！ぜひ諦めるな！  </wbr></wbr>  </wbr> </wbr>      There's formal study material for all levels and there's no rule that says that you can't do a chapter a day. Go as fast as you like.   instead of spending a year on a foundation that never really gets out of the starting gate  I'm not suggesting that.        日本語でオナニして！     ゴメン、お前の投稿を見て諦めた    いじめてすまん    Formal study is fine but there are plenty of people who have jumped into reading super early and been successful.     What a dumb fucking language Why did it have to be the japs to start producing cartoon porn? Any country with a western language would've been better. Fucking dying chink shit, they have to steal every new word from english because they can't make up new ones. Even if you're doing business with them you don't need to learn the language because most of the time it will be them speaking your language. And anyone who doesn't isn't worth doing business with Even they recognize the superiority of the white man's alphabet      So, I am trying to read some shitty porn, and an early line is throwing me off.  Context: http://www003.upp.so-net.ne.jp/migu<wbr>/kinjo/kinjo1-1.htm   学生時代に知り合った妻と結婚してまだ二ヶ月余りしかたっていない、いわ<wbr>ゆる新婚カップルである。</wbr>    My translation is "(A guy) who I met in my school days just got married to his wife not two months ago, and are a honeymoon couple, so to speak."  But later, when the narrator is talking about the wife, there is the line:   学生時代は「街を歩くかわいい娘」や「美人コンパニオン特集」などの雑誌<wbr>グラビアなんかにも何度も載っている程なのである。</wbr>   As far as "学生時代は" is concerned, I can't tell if the narrator is talking about how the wife could be described in her school days, or if its something else entirely.           </wbr>     You could always learn Korean.    That's just as bad as japanese but without the 2 advantages of learning it    qt korean girls    That's how I also understand it, I can't see it in any other way.  The repetition of 学生時代 is kinda throwing me off but since you said "later" I suppose these two sentences weren't next to each other. That's what made you doubt too, right?      They might as well be androids what with their manufactured personalities and plasticine bodies. Maybe you're into that though.    Those lines are first person dude. The narrator is part of a new couple, and his wife did gravure      (A guy) who I met in  He's talking about himself.   学生時代に知り合った妻と結婚してまだ二ヶ月余りしかたっていない、いわ<wbr>ゆる新婚カップルである。</wbr>  I married my wife who I met during my school days and barely two months have passed since then, you could say we're a newly-wed couple.   学生時代は「街を歩くかわいい娘」や「美人コンパニオン特集」などの雑誌<wbr>グラビアなんかにも何度も載っている程なのである。</wbr>  During her school days, there where countless occasions where she got featured in gravure magazines like "Cute girl walking the streets" and "Beautiful Lady Companion SE".  Shitty translation but it gets the point across.              Maybe you're into that though.  pretty much    Which anime are you guys listening to?   アイカツ!    None.

It felt pretty numb in the end.    mfw my kanji grid is bigger than yours and there's nothing you can do about it   Are there any ranobes that are notably easier to read than others? Or are all LNs hard as fuck?   I can inform you that kanji as a whole are obsolete, but you'd seethe with rage.    Most of them are fairly easy and aren't exactly high literature. Any sort of prose is going to be difficult at first.    Post your grid so we can see who you are.    Thanks for nothing, retard.    Come on down from mount stupid.    My nigga, I hope japnese and korean and actually similar    He isn't the one that asked the question. Probably he's just here to shit up these threads.    people more concerned with what is "easy" and what is "hard" than what they actually want to read   Holy fuck you guys are retarded.     Japanese learners (maybe learners in general, I don't know) tend to place a lot of effort on levels and progression. I guess this is just a motivating tool.    Experienced language learners all say interesting content is more important than easy content.    Yeah, no argument from me. Being motivated and engaged is the most important thing by far.   help me with my piss poor jap skills, trying to ask &gt;why does miku need that much money 何でミクさんにあんなたくさんのお金が必要 would that be correct y/n     Yes, though it sounds a little odd in my opinion without any kind of ending particle like かな or at least a question mark.    同人音声    I need to know kanji to read the plethora of masterpieces that lie awaiting me in the world of VNs and LNs, therefore it's not obsolete. Sorry for proving you wrong.    Post your grid.    Any VN needing more than 2500 kanji is overrated shit   I wonder how far I'd get by completely dropping my reps and just bruteforcing through with texthook and VNs.    Not like I'm asking because that's what I've been doing for the past 1-2 months.      I fail to see how my grid is relevant to the point I'm making. If you can explain to me I will gladly post it.  Even if that were true, so what? How does that imply kanji as a whole are obsolete? That would just suggest (not even prove) that there are a bunch of kanji which are obsolete, which I don't think anybody would ever disagree with anyway.      I was also interested in the answer to the question and got angered with his useless reply.    Play any ten VNs, even the easiest ones and you'll find that they sum up more than 3000 unique Kanji.    Not as far as you would with a well balanced rep program.    Having fun shitposting, son?    The easiest LN is the one that you enjoy. Differences between different works are greatly exaggerated and unless you're looking at something that's deliberately obtuse (using old language or something) it's not going to make the difference in whether you can progress or not.    But reps are boring, anon.    How deep in your ass did that one come from?     his useless reply.  You mean  Most of them are fairly easy and aren't exactly high literature. Any sort of prose is going to be difficult at first. this is useless? Because it's the sole truth. You're supposed to take it as meaning that if you're having trouble with one you'll have trouble with any other one so you might as well just pick one that interests you instead of searching for some elusive 'easy' LN which doesn't really exist.   Nobody said they were fun. If you can't take it, well, that's just the measure of how capable you are.          見透かされましたか    I wouldn't say skipping reps over reading is a matter of capability seeing as how reps don't teach you even a fraction of what reading does. THere are probably more people who do just either instead both on a daily basis.    are you supposed to guess instead or what     THere are probably more people who do just either instead both  That would be a sad state of affairs. I believe a balanced combination of both is the optimal state. If that were the case though and people in general just can't do both at the same time, I'd recommend reading over reps 1000 times of course.  It sounds pretty unbelievable to me. I imagine people usually start with just reps and then gradually, in a very slow process, increase the time allocated to reading (and listening/watching) from 0% to 100% as they become better and better.         You can get very far.    俺は勉教しない主義だから心配無用    It's possible. It sort of depends on your level though. Remember Komeiji? The Azusa waifuposter from a few years ago? He's reading Muramasa now and he didn't use Anki at all. If you're a beginner you need some serious autism to pull through in the beginning if you want to progress fast.    I only know from my own experience. I used to grind reps and do just that. Was probably down 2200 kanji before even opening my first VN. Still, don't really regret since grinding reps was fun at that point for some reason.   Daily reminder if you can't read Muramasa you are dumber than Komeiji.  Is writing random sentences using grammar points from DOJG and getting them checked (lang8) a good way to improve my production?  Reminder that Muramasa is overrated chuunishit. It has a generic high school protagonist and some bitch with chink eyes as a heroine. There's also no cute brown girls or blonde lolis. Just go play muv luv instead.   Did you read it yourself and come to that conclusion? If so I will do as you say.    There's that brown slut who yakiniku really likes. So there's that. But then again I don't even know what the fuck we're talking about.    Just read the first half of the first chapter and you'll come to the same conclusion. Just look at this shitty cliche antagonist.    Yes but try to write longer coherent texts, not just random sentences    Even if something you write is correct, it might not always sound natural. Lang8 is only as good as the people who happen to be checking your work.    It's better than doing nothing. Also, I think you should be pretty solid when it comes to reading before even starting up on production. That way you can eliminate retarded word choices because you'll know what sounds off.    Don't worry about production until you can read decently. Unless you have some reason to focus on production extra hard like if you are going to japan soon or something.   Also, I think trying to write thinking "how can I use this grammar structure" is totally the wrong way to go about it. You want to be able to take what you want to say, and say it in the most natural way possible.  Also the best way to practice production would be to actually make japanese friends.        I'd say it's a good practice, but not sufficient. You won't get a feel for what sounds natural and what sounds off until you've read tons of Japanese.     I'm already an advanced reader. And I've used HelloTalk for a few months already. But chatting in casual Japanese is kind of different from doing long blog posts with formal Japanese and more complex grammar. My active vocabulary is pretty shit too.       Try translating something that's actually hard    reminder that this is actually never used in real life      A wing B exit vinegar   "A" is the nest from "B"   tfw you took a break when you only had 50 reviews left but forgot to finish them and went to sleep instead.    Stop frogposting and stop being lazy. It's only 50 reviews. That shit shouldn't take more than 5-10 minutes tops.    I've already finished them. It just hurts my autism to see that I did that.    I had this happen to me just last night.   "I'll just go take a piss."  forget to pick tablet back up   I'm not even scratching the doorknob.         no way it takes 5-10 minutes, i can't write that fast   Does it seem like a bad idea to drop all of my studying outside of Anki for the next 2 weeks and do 200 new words a day for 10 days so that Core 6k is finished off?   No, just be patient and keep going. It's a marathon not a sprint.    What a nerd. I neet and I do 20 when I'm REALLY feeling it.   お前らいつから勉教してるの？ 俺の場合はおよそ六ヶ月前からというところだろうが スラングとリスニングなどはまだまだ難度が高すぎて 当分コツが掴めそうにない アンキも結構めんどくさくなったし、いっそ諦めて勉教を止めるかという思い<wbr>にかられて泣き寝入りする夜もなくはない  お前らが挫折した時はどうやって立ち直って勉教を続けるの？  </wbr>        勉教     You can't learn Japanese.

Yukino knows what love is      really guys     It's just keep happening    REALLY   Here we go again  Gaiden's almost over, will you avoid the spoilers this next week?  Naruto looks so based and grown up. I love it.    It was just another of Tobirama's mistakes.  Tobirama was the CNN of his time  Uchiha murder circles create child soldiers in Konoha   Is evil hereditary? Shocking report on Uchiha genetics   The militarization of police traced to Uchiha rebellion         Dadruto has been one of the best parts of the Gaiden. Looking forward to seeing more of him in the movie.      he's just gonna ignore Salad     People are trying to defend Boruto but won't even tell me why they think he's stronger. Like what can make him strong enough to beat a Uzumaki/Uchiha descendant. Boruto is just a plain Uzumaki just like Pain was.   Reminder that Super Strength is not genetic.  Reminder that the narrative theme of this Gaiden is that ideas/familial love trumps genetic heritage  Reminder that Sakura a shit        Because he is the one with genius and talent plus power.    Salad has her own father she can fistbump with.    They better give us some Hinata to make up with no appearance in the gaiden    Be careful what you wish for.    It wasn't just Tobirama's fault, when you're born in a world full of wars with an ability like the sharingan you know for sure what's going to be your fate.   threadly reaminder that Tobirama's nightmare isn't over yet   shieeeet where is all this coming from? I've been missing a lot of shit recently    Tell me how Sarada will counter Raiton+Rasengan (rasenkunai?).     Not all Uchihas and Uzumakis are uber tier like Nardo and Sauce are. We still have to see how Kishi  or someone else  will handle them, because in a series like Nurutu plot convenience is king.     Sarada is a Uzumaki and Uchiha. She has more growth potential than Bort.      Sarada is an Uchiha and an Haruno.   If Salad creates enough shadow clones through her daddy issues, could she awaken MS by massacring her self-images?   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Qyo<wbr>nn5Vbg7s</wbr>  [ ] New trailer     She is a woman so whatever potential she could have had has been dwarfed.   fuck off    Boruto is basically Sasuke+Naruto   Sarada is mini-Sakura   People still arguing who's strongest       Uzumakis have a pretty good statistic, 4 out of 5 shown characters were good, only Karin was shit tier Uchiha... not so much     With a good hotdogging.    What a little shit, hope he gets fucked up also  not even 15 years old and already doing susanoo rasengan  Fucks sake      I want Sarada meet her (biological) mom in the last chapter    You want reasons?  1. Sarada's only talent so is Sakura's super bitch punch, an ability notoriously associated with mediocre fighters like Sakura, Shizune and Tsunade (who is arguably the weakest Hokage and sannin and probably lost more fights than she won). Because the author is obsessed with parallels and thinks it's a good thing to make the kids just mini versions of one of their parents with all the same abilities it seems like Sarada is being prepped to be a second Sakura, which isn't a good thing considering Sakura had literally no noteworthy abilities besides being able to punch the ground heal, making her one of the most ineffective fighters  2. There's still a good chance that Kishimoto will pull out of making Sarada an Uzumaki/Uchiha hybrid. One chapter is all he needs to explain away any of the evidence in the most haphazard way he can so Sakura/Sasuke's fangirls don't have to kill themselves. If this is the case, her potential is almost entirely destroyed.  3. While she does have the Sharingan, Sasuke only unlocked all his abilities by going through a dark and depressing period of his life. If Kishimoto is the type to spare Sarada from harm by saying "Nope. Sakura was her birth mommy all along, he will most definitely spare her from too much further stress needed to awaken further stages of the Sharingan.  4. She's a woman and woman normally get the short-end of the stick in this manga. Think about it. Was Karin any greater of a fighter than Sakura in spite of being an Uzumaki?              *Sarada is a Haruno and Uchiha  FTFY     I would commit suicide if Sasuke was my dad.    yeah, all the uchihas shown were some shit-tier irrelevant jobbers, like Sasuke, Itachi, Madara, Obito, Shisui etc.     Aren't there still like 6 or 7 chapters left?   mama Hinata why so sad :'(     Haruno  Literally who.     Isn't Karin fucking dead and buried somewhere?    where is the uncensored version where he is holding a gun in this shot?    Then you're fucking retarded  having a sharingan   genjutsuing hot chicks and drowning in pussy       Next week is the last chapter. Might have some extra pages.     your dad does not give one fuck   he enjoys you having so many friends   never asks why the girls follow you   he just understands         7 good named uchihas   the rest of the shown clan was mediocre at best from what is seen  That's still a bad statistic compared to 4/5     What is this expression trying to say, /a/?     What's the point of drowning in pussy with no dad to be proud of you?    That he finally found  Boruto's  spare.     coup d'etat incoming      I'll be back to fuck shit up some more soon.     shit that makes me sad, I actually like this spinoff a lot   Why are the new kids so /fa/?   Anon you don't know how statistics work  Having a sample size of 5 is not going to give you a strong undeniable conclusion. For all you know, those 5 Uzumakis were the only ones relevant to the plot because all the rest were trash      she's still alive in the different hideout    i just need him to interact with his daughter at least once  it's already ridiculous that he only has a photo of bolt on his desk      Why does he sound like luffy     tfw when Uchiha were never once at the top  Senju/Uzumaki all day.     Every Uchiha who managed to awaken the Sahringan became at least a jonin. Also we literally know 5 Uzumakis: -Nagato, talentless ninja blessed by Madara with the Rinnegan -Kushina, just an housewife -Karin, jobber -Mito, jobber -Naruto, blessed with the Kyuubi and Asura's tranasmigrant        Gaiden could run as long as Naruto. Why is kinshi being a fucking lazy sloth? Doesn't he want money?    Enhanced.      I'm holding my final judgement. One chapter is all Kishimoto needs to screw everything up.  At this point, Sarada could go from being a most interesting and dynamic character to complete trash depending on how Kishi chooses to resolve her character arc.        so /fa/   black and red everywhere   Kishi has to make it seem like there's been some sort of progression in the Ninja world I guess.       It was a joke. Of course you can't use 5 people to come to the conclusion that the Uzumaki were an uber clan  Though some people here seem to do just that       dat pose  what a slut      -Karin, jobber   Karin isn't a jobber cause she was never really a fighter to begin with.       Man that girl kicks ass.   She's pretty hot too.      Suigetsu was pretty based in this series.   you will never hang around Orochimaru's Totally-Not-A-Supervillain Base, running DNA tests for random children because you have nothing better to do with your time       Uchiha shits should never smile.    I can't believe I'm saying it but I don't really want it to end. I actually want to see more of this generation. Maybe a capable assistant can pick this up and make something out of it.    Itachi and Obito killed the entire clan. Most uchihas where shit tier     -Nagato, talentless ninja blessed by Madara with the Rinnegan  kek  -Kushina, just an housewife   -Mito, jobber  Both were able to control the Kyuubi, a being more or less made of hatred their whole life  Also, the whole Uchiha clan was massacred by two guys. Can't have been that great          Does he even know he has a daughter?   Do they have the same VA or something?         Madara has the cutest smile    I agree, I'm really hype about this new series and it's a shame if it doesn't continue in some form    We all know how this story goes.  She turns into mini-Suckera cunt who is tsundere for Boruto.      almost over  Wait what? Its ending so soon? Literally THE sequel to Naruto isn't even about his Son who only showed his face for like 3 panels its just about Sakura being a cuck and the Uchiha's being the worst fucking bloodline in history? What a fucking joke.       It's no shame to be slightly autistic   I bet Gaiden would go on if somehow Kishi finds a way for Madara to be able to create an offspring who carries his ideals.     If Sarada isn't Karin's, I don't think I'd want it to continue if Kishimoto is only going to create false conflicts.      I dont follow naruto and this sequel but  Gaiden's almost over  Did you mean the entire sequel or is this just a prologue to the sequel or something?      Sarada already hogged all of Naruto's father/daughter time    What is there to like about the gaiden? It's just a retarded soap opera. Maybe it would be better if it actually focused on the other kids instead of just Sarada.     Same. I'm actually kinda hype for the Boruto movie and Kishi delivering on his promise that it will be his best work in the Naruto franchise. Trailer looks fucking GOAT.     Sarada  Gotta work on the ideals part tho     Sarada has Sakura's exact same part 2 outfit only with Sasuke's edgy arm warmers.      The gaiden is only one volume/ten chapters  After this, there's just the Boruto Movie.  After the Boruto movie, it's anyone's guess what happens next. Maybe Kishi will take a twenty year break and come back to it like Toriyama.           Literally THE sequel to Naruto isn't even about his Son who only showed his face for like 3 panels its just about Sakura being a cuck and the Uchiha's being the worst fucking bloodline in history?   Literally THE sequel to Naruto  That's the Burrito movie coming out in August.      Itachi did it for the sake of the Konoha village, please respect him. He cares Konoha more than his clan. he's a true Shinobi.    The only reason Naruto is good with Sarada is because he has a daughter of his own. I bet he spoils Himawari like crazy.    The gaiden's purpose is to provide buildup for the Boruto movie which is the main attraction.     Himawari grows up to be Tsunade 2.0  oh boy     The gaiden was always meant to be a mini series who's purpose was to lead into the Boruto movie. Kishimoto decided that the mini series should have nothing to do with the thing it was supposed to lead into for whatever reason.    You realize that Boruto is facing Shikadai and not Sarada in the exam final right?  And do you remember that the final exam was composed of a tournament fight? Unless Boruto and Shikadai was the very last fight (and being the winner doesn't gurantee the ascension to Chuunin), nothing was supposed to be set in stone.  In any case, aliens interrumpted the exam.         It's just a retarded soap opera  Exactly.     and Kishi delivering on his promise that it will be his best work in the Naruto franchise  You and I know both know that could go either way.         Then why doesn't he go to his birthday party, have a picture of her on his desk or has acknowledged her existence?     You should be able to solve this  I fucking hate logarithms  I ain't no muthafukin mathematistian  Math is disgusting.  That's obviously 4, as my prize you can fuck off already.   What the fuck am I looking at? I don't give a fuck that a 26 year old should know this, I'm curious now. Seriously? This doesn't look like any math I've seen in my school years. Then again, I didn't go to college but that's a whole nother story.    I'm this guy  I'm also 26 and didn't go to college, but I was able to puzzle it out.  Basically what it's saying is that if you look at numbers that are powers of 3 (1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, and so on) the last digit cycles between the same numbers in the exact same order, every few steps. It wants to know how many steps that is, so the answer is 4.      Well thank you anon, I have learned a thing today. Still can't math my way out of a paper bag, but thanks.    That's some weird grammar.   Basically the line is: For all natural numbers n, there exists a natural number A &gt; 1 where "3^(n+A) = 3^n (mod 10)" holds.  So the Question is, when is 3^A mod 10 = 1 (A&gt;1): 3^n* 3^A = 3^n (mod 10)  3^2 = 9; 9 mod 10 = 9 3^3 = 27; 27 mod 10 = 7 3^4 = 81; 81 mod 10 = 1  So with n="Some natural number" A=4 and assuming Equations mod 10: 3^(n+A) = 3^n* 3^A = 3^n* 3^4 = 3^n* 81 = 3^n* 1 = 3^n  Q.E.D.  But the Answer is simply 4.  We had this Thread a while ago.                   It sounds like a riddle and a math problem had an unholy unity.   Is that easier for you?  Show that: ∀n∈ℕ:(∃A∈ℕ:[(A&gt;1)∧(3^(n+A) mod 10 = 3^n mod 10)])      I Should be able to do a lot of things by my age.  Kiss, drive, pay bills, get a job, find a girlfriend, graduate college, etc.  But I can't do a god damn fucking one of them, please kill me.       This is actually an extremely simple problem, just worded in a way that makes it sound scary.    Thats not the question being asked, it asks for the minimum value. Your not even asking if a minimal value exists, or if the number is the same for every n, just that a value exists for every n. You should have said there exists an A such that for every n, instead of for every n there exists an A but this doesnt solve your problem of not stateing you want the minimal element.    Well im an idiot, if an element exists there exists a minimal element since i forgot he said A is in N but that doesn't change he didnt ask for it in that chain.

A boy falls in love with a girl.  Unable to confess, he is gifted with by a deus ex machina with the girl's phone number. Never minding the strange area code, he immediately calls her, and is overjoyed to find out that she has a crush on him as well.  But, the next day, when he recounts the previous day's confessions to the girl, she only looks at him with a perplexed expression. After some investigation, he finds out that the girl he called is not the same girl he fell in love with. In fact, she doesn't exist in this universe at all. She is the girl's alternate universe counterpart, who has fallen in love with the MC's own AU self, who too is blissfully unaware of her crush.  Hijinks ensue as the two strike up a deal to give each other their darkest, most private secrets in order to equip the other with the weapons they need to conquer the heart of their other selves. While the two chase their respective loved ones, DRAMA ensues as they begin to fall in love with each other instead and question the NATURE of LOVE.        this series would be nice      He called it.

"I am the best"                   A Soul Calibur anthology that focuses the stories of Nightmare. Xianghua, and Ivy  An anime based on/inspired by Sultanate of Women  The Sultanate of Women was the nearly 130-year period during the 16th and 17th centuries when the women of the Imperial Harem of the Ottoman Empire exerted extraordinary political influence over state matters and over the (male) Ottoman sultan, starting from the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent. Many of the Sultans during this time were minors and it was their mothers, the Valide Sultans, or their wives, the Haseki Sultans, who effectively ruled the Empire. Most of these women were of slave origin, which was often the case in general for consorts of Ottoman sultans.  Doesn't have to be historically accurate and could even take place in a fictional universe as long as the core idea of a harem with political influence in an Ottoman/Islamic style empire is there.  An anime based on Malinalli  La Malinche, known also as Malinalli, was a Nahua woman from the Mexican Gulf Coast, who played a role in the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, acting as an interpreter, advisor, lover, and intermediary for Hernán Cortés. She was one of twenty women slaves given to the Spaniards by the natives of Tabasco in 1519. Later, she became a mistress to Cortés and gave birth to his first son, Martín, who is considered one of the first Mestizos (people of mixed European and indigenous American ancestry).

Virtual Sky Lanterns   It was once tradition for people to create sky lanterns, sending their prayers along up towards the heavens and hoping their messages would be answered. An app available for augmented reality devices renovates this ancient tradition: personal handwritten requests are now contained in virtual sky lanterns, publicly released into the night sky.  People carrying AR devices, such as contact lenses, smartphones or glasses, can see these messages under the viewing options. The plot follows two individuals encountering each other in a city, competing to answer these sky lanterns.   One of the individuals is a young woman volunteering for the recognition. She desires to improve her karma profile, a popular online trend designed to record altruistic actions. The second character is a heartbroken young man answering the sky lanterns to cope with separation.  Discovering these motives fosters concern. The young woman sees the young man answering the sky lanterns as an excuse to neglect the losses he suffered. The young man sees the young woman as a lonely person using the sky lanterns in hopes of find meaning in her vacant life.   As the two characters work together for certain requests, they begin to understand each other, eventually leading them to answer one another’s sky lantern request: helping the young man accept separation and finding a purpose in life for the young woman.            A loser NEET from the Nineties gets visited by a girl who calls him Daddy.

She fucks the NEET and gives birth to herself, and in order for her to get born, she needs to send herself, her daughter, back in time to fuck her husband and father.

It would have a happy ending though, they all come back safe but with PTSD.        implying fan-fic is a thing         Their faces when they hear that first sonar pulse and sit in dead silence as the tension builds, waiting, praying the destroyer passes them over or the silence to be broken by an explosion as they're found.   All of them huddled together hoping that these aren't final moments of their lives they're experiencing.       It's like a photograph of a seven year old boy's soul.

Yes, a samefag who just spammed different lists of shows that they liked from the last five years while including Jinrui in all of them as part of his insidious scheme, right? And then posting different 3x3s with Jinrui in all of them, and posting positive things about Jinrui in random threads over days and months and year, I suppose?     Yes, a samefag who just spammed different lists of shows that they liked from the last five years   Samefags. Plural. About 10 of them. With proxies, probably.       being so butthurt at your LA k of imagination and creativity that you can't appreciate anyome getting excited at their abundance of it that you would rather duck everyone's brain with Jew poison in pill form   Don't you have some terrible job to go be a wage slave at?      tfw all the games by the developer were adapted into anime except for the best one      Yeah, that ending was stupidly adorable.   you will never have a waifu whos undivided love for you has been ingrained in her since childhood      Maybe YOU won't.     If Herakles could be summoned before he went full god, doesn't that mean Jesus could be summoned during his human phase?    No, because Jesus was always God and God was always Jesus. That's how the Trinity works.      Jesus was always God  yes   God was always Jesus  No  That's how the Trinity works  Do you even know what the trinity is           This is really going into some heavy theological shit but iirc Catholic Catechism States that God has always existed as the Trinity. I don't know about heretical catechism, I didn't have to sit through thirteen years of it in school.       Jesus was always God  Jesus was also always a Human. Kind like light is particles and waves.    Don't you know, /a/non? Modern Christians believe that Jesus is and always was 100% god and 100% man. You just have to believe!   You just need to be muslim - no problem at all.    Jesus was both man and God. Like what this guy said, but without the sarcasm.      then what class would Jesus be assigned?  I'd rather see Judas (Assassin?) or Maria-Magdalena (Rider, Caster) though      Jesus is always true god and true man.     Jesus would likely be caster too, it tends to go to any sort of servant who isn't actively combative anyway.        Jesus was both man and God.  This.     Saver.  Or savior hohohoho.      I want to say Lancer, since Jesus never killed anyone.     Rider  Summons Jesus as a mount?     Jesus is simultaneously both fully human and fully divine. It's called the 'dual nature of Christ' and there were hundreds of debates about this topic all the way from the dark ages into the renaissance, many of which degenerated into fistfights which left hundreds dead. Saint Nicholas beat a guy to death with a chair.  I hereby move that Santa should be a heroic spirit.        even in the dark ages they couldn't decide who the best legal Servant was      Lancer killed Shirou and Kotomine-Kirei but it would be fitting because Lancer is also a fisherman       Santa   Rider Class  What's his Noble phantasm?       If Herakles could be summoned before he went full god  wrong herakles is a God in Olymp. at the same time he is dead in Hades. odyseus had a little chat with him.        some space/time distortion that allows him to be at several locations at the same time or moves at almost lightspeed      so his noble phantasm would probably be his sleigh or Rudolph     And his NP would be spear of longinus.    I never understood this KS meme.     probably the spear that the roman soldier used to injure his torso while he was hangig on the cross I have not much knowledge of christianity or the bible but wasn't it Maria Magdalena who catches the blood from this would caused by the spear with a vessel that was later claimed to be the holy grail? holy fuck this shit is too obvious        wound not would  typo      That is the spear of Longinus. Longinus was the name of the soldier.     Maria magdalena - cock rider     He'd likely receive his own class like GILGAMESH, MONSTER, etc.   Wasn't buddha summoned?  Also if you summoned Jesus you'd have infinite holy grails so there's not really a point    Jesus would probably just be a regular/impowered guy. The Abrahamic god is probably just a high-tier Divine Spirit encompassing all three of the religions.   Why would Jesus have something that he never used? If anything make him a Rider and base him on Revelation 19.   Some christian strains say that jesus was only god once he was baptised, others say he always was. I guess trying to summon him would be a pretty interesting way to try and prove it, although the grail might give you a person that is similar to him (like with fake assassin).  That said it would be interesting to see what you would end up with if you try and use the shroud of turin as artifact      no that would be his mount, his noble phantasm would either be his bag of infinite treasure (probably as caster santa) or a teleportation like ability that is tied to the sled.     Only in the moon cell, and even so, Buddha was a lot more human than Jesus    Yes, Shakyamuni was summoned, but no one actually believes Shakyamuni was a god.      bag of infinite treasure (probably as caster santa)  then would't be archer more fitting with his infinite gift works/gates of christmas joy?       artefact crafting by pulling shit out of a bag   not having workshop as a class power   caster  Stop wanting to make everything archer nasu, go back to your molusk porn        I'm actual a casterfag who tries to think straight  also manufacturing shit isn't magic, it's artisanry       summoning a pacifist as a Servant  Good luck with that.    considering medea also had artefact crafting and workshop fits santa perfectly id go for caster rather than forcing him to be archer with his bag. He would rather be an assassin than an archer    Jesus wasn't a pacifist. He didn't kill anyone per se but he was FAR from fucking peaceful. Do I need to remind you of Jesus dislocating a hip after wrestling a dude for few hours and beating up jews?    I've forgotten whatever lectures my teachers gave me on the subject, but I remember either the Nicene or the Apostles' Creed explicitly saying he "was born of the Virgin Mary and was made man," so I think he became man-god in 1 BC.     thinking old testament god/jesus was the same as the new testament/jesus      &gt; God was always Jesus   No   Read a Bible       And what' You summon human jesus.  Hey jesus what you can do?   "I can give you some sick-ass insight!"   And what else?   "I can make some nice bread but that's about it really."         So many people just go "Caster" like he's a magus or something, but his power was authority. The power to tell the Earth to do anything and it responds, or create miracles.  There's already a class for people like him, called Saver.      He can die pretty effectively and he whipped some priests    He has a whip he used to kick merchants out of the temple.  I don't think it was his, he just stole it from someone who had it laying around.      That's part of the sick-ass insight nigga.    Jesus in the New testament once whipped a bunch of people out of his temple, and commanded them to tear it all down.  He chose not to invoke his powers since he had to show the people the correct way.  It's noted the next time he comes around he won't be so nice.         assassin because he sneaks into your house through the chimney? I think Santa is perfect as Rider though      send Jesus in to die   God unleashes hell upon your enemy   Jesus later ressurrects  Sounds like a pretty good plan to me.        Send jesus to die  You also die over god being butthurt u maggot.  Also jesus is summoned for the winner to drink his blood.        &gt;And what else?   &gt;"I can make some nice bread but that's about it really."   Are you stupid, or have you just not read a Bible. Guy had like all the powers.  Replicating fish, walking on water, transmutation, commanding dragons, touch of death to a fig tree, replicating bread, commanding storms and the sea, once walked through a crowd of people trying to kill him without any being able to touch him because he didn't feel like it, bringing people back to life, coming back to life himself, destroying mountains with a command, getting a snake to suck its own poison out of a guy and then telling it to die, curing all diseases with faith, etc.  Guy had all the powers, its like no one has read this.           that, and the fact that he knows everything of everyone, and that he has superb mobility.   but god in the old testament was butthurt and unforgiving all the time. if you compare old to new testament god he is a lot milder and friendlier in the new testament. Also the revelations were john having a bad trip displaying his big brother fantasies.       It's gonna be a Dracula thing, he can temporarily become divine.    You mean his ability to ressurect dead people?     Hey jesus what can you do?   EVE RY THING      Jesus has the power to create his own grail with his blood  why would he even bother fighting over some secondary grail scum?    I have, but OP said "human" so if you want a non-god jesus you get the son of a cucked carpenter.    Why not the saint grail itself?    because the holy grail is just a nickname and doesnt have any ties to the original. Kotomine tells you at the start. The official grail gives you eternal life, the grail here is just a honeypot for heroic spirits to get a shitload of magic to reach the root.    Jesus was always divine, there's no real separating it since he's god in the flesh. However he did all those miracles while he was in the flesh.  Can't separate the powers from the Jesus      Not summoning Santa as Berserker    Bitches stole his cup. Basically it'd fold like this:  Turns saber into dust for being a heretic slut   Just turns everyone into dust for heretic bitches   Grabs the grial and fucks off   Goes to his apartment and serves himself a tea cup on the grial     Buddha asks him why he took so long to get his favorite mug           I'm italian and I was fucking idroctinated with this shit for 20 years so stop being a retard.    Original concept was a turnover, and more fitting with the themes.  Of course the grail in this case has nothing to do with Jesus, in a way where CCC has to point out "That's obvious, this shit does the opposite of God's will". Original story for Fate, the cup is the chalice of the Whore of Babylon or whatever, a cup of infinite greed and desire, which is kind of the opposite of Jesus stuff. This revelation is more obvious when you start to think about the real nature of the grail in this case.  Jesus is more like "No you can't just have whatever selfish thing you want without limit, there are rules" and "There's glory in poverty, the women who gives two pennies of her necessity has given more than all of you who have given out of your excess".        Nothing but weak tricks and sorcery. He'd get wrecked by any C-class servant.    Jesus can't be summoned since he doesn't exist.    Nasu writes some next Fate spinoff or whatever   Lancer gets summoned   "Are you my mas-" and gets hit by collapsing roof   war continues with 6 servants  What other ways could Nasu shit on Lancer?       Golden Chalice &lt;Aurea Boura&gt;(? アウレア・ボーウラ): EX   The golden chalice that BB holds. As well as a Holy Grail.   A negative Holy Grail that grants the impudent, self-centered wishes of the owner.    The chalice possessed by the Whore of Babylon that appears in the Revelation of St. John.   A pseudo-Holy Grail, but exactly because it is a fake Holy Grail that it became a "genuine" Holy Grail that grants the desires of humans regardless of right and wrong.    To the Christians that treated the honorable poverty of those days as virtue, a chalice molded with a symbol of riches such as gold evidently had connotations of corrupted wealth, greed and the vanity of adorning oneself.    Although it was clear from the point that this was the chalice held by the Whore of Babylon - the personification of the Roman Empire - but this chalice has inverted Christ's words of "Do not pile up wealth on the land" and symbolizes the earthly wealth.   **   "I saw a single woman straddled on a red beast.   That beast, whose whole body was covered with numerous names that blasphemed God, had seven heads and ten horns."    According to the Revelation, this is the description of the beast of ruin that appeared in the Holy City and the woman that was straddled on said beast.   A giant beast possessing seven heads as if the Hydra was said to appear from the sea and land on the Holy City.   This beast and woman are one and the same, it is impossible to think about them detached from each other.    The woman is treated as one who brings forth all evils, it has been said that the imprudent and avaricious are unable to oppose her temptation and corrupted by this chalice.    This is a digression, but the Red Saber who call herself an Emperor has been regarded in the same light as this beast and antagonized by the laymen after her death.                          then you just create a wraith of someone who was closest to him.    Jesus exists as a historic figure, his Godhood is up for discussion if you'd like to tip, but not his existence.    There are Roman records of Jesus.    Turning people into dust was not any of his powers. He'd get his shit slapped out of him and then turn the other cheek because that's how he rolled.     Implying if needs be he wouldn't get angels to wrekt shit up and turn everything in to PILLARS OF SALT      I like to think of Revelations as God working out his boredom over having to play nice after the whole Jesus thing. Two thousand years of not smiting people and he just bides his time coming up with the most creative possible way to let it all out once he gets his chance again. Half the reason Revelations is so fucked up is probably because it was a rough draft.     Jesus wasn't a hero, millions of people have died because of him   What would even be the point in a grail war if you could summon Jesus?  You could just cut his finger, drip the blood into a cup and boom, now you too have your own genuine holy grail enjoy your free wishes.     There are rather several reasons why this attempted potshot is strange in this situation.  I'll just go with the angle of "You suppose Heracles and Medusa were real then?" for now.  Jesus existence isn't really in question, it's a confirmed fact.         He gets summoned into a sewer   Sewage discharge   Then he drowns in literal shit        now you too have your own genuine holy grail enjoy your free wishes.  except the official holy grail doesnt grant wishes and the holy grail the grail war is fought for is not the real grail either      Turning people into dust was not any of his powers.   He did it to a fig tree once  Touch of death, fig tree didn't live up to his ideals so he killed it.        mfw there are people who are still confused about The Trinity   Never get into Hinduism or Buddhism, your brain will explode.     And even more because of a pedophile merchant. If you want to tip, tip it the other direction.          If you have trouble just say: Quantum mechanics.          Yeshu was a common-ass name back in Roman Palestine. Doesn't mean any of them inspired the Christian story of Jesus. I'll admit that there probably was some historical basis, but I'm fairly sure there is no definitive evidence of Christ.     Why didn't he use any of those cool powers to prevent the Romans from nailing him to a cross?  Oh, wait, he totally could but he didn't want to because the bible said so.      It was totally prophecy you guys, really!    Muhammed at least was also a warrior and a conqueror. He could probably be summoned as a servant.     Fate takes Heroic in the classical sense, where heroism is defined by doing great deeds, not necessarily being a good person. A good portion of the ancient Greek heroes were assholes or selfish dicks. Ajax killed himself because somebody else got a suit of armor he really wanted.    what about including Indiana Jones as a modern age servant? he was based on a figure named Roy Chapman Andrews and almost everyone knows his lore. plus he is also in pursuit of the holy grail. would he be Rider? because he can ride almost everything, even a fridge.   How many possible people could be called Jesus from Nazareth, "son" of Joseph?    /a/ in charge of christian believes  sasuga /a/   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;1272209   Hey dad should I just teleport or something   naw let them kill you, I'll raise you 3 days later and we get to have tea and scones and catch up, don't you want to see your old man?   Okay dad.       How many people in the Bronx could be called John Smith? A name isn't equivalent to evidence.    Because he had nothing more to do, he already taught enough people for the religion to survive 2000 god damn years.     warrior   conqueror  Pick none. He was a pedophile illiterate merchant. He literally just got a bunch of dumbfucks to kill people in his name       There are loads of theories of jesus. One is that he was conjured up by the early christian sect to spearhead their faith with a charismatic leader. Another one is that he was a disciple of john the baptist but defected to start his own group Another is that he really did exist as the bible describes him Another is that another person (or persons) was jesus and the image got corrupted as the story was passed around.  That said the gospels were not literally written by john, matthew etc. They were drafted based on the memoirs of them and it took 20 years before they were written down.          You do realize how little people were alive in times of Jesus on Earth? One big city in the US probably has as many people as 30 AD.    Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels? 54 But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?”    Well yeah that was the entire point, he had all the powers, yet he could not use them selfishly since he was trying to show that humans could live properly even with their limited means and weakness.  He was trying to prove that a human could live correctly, by becoming human and showing everyone how it was done.  Thus he had to commit no sins, die righteously not because he did anything wrong but because he would not concede towards what was right, and make sure that his message would live on forever.  By dying with no sin, knowing that he would die that same day and not lifting a hand against these people, he created the salvation. Showing that a human could live right, taking all sins upon him while he was on the cross and dying with all sins, so that others could be saved.  That's what it means to be a messiah.  You're questioning this shit while you go "Woah cool!" when Archer did the same thing when he died. He had all the power to stop his death, but he abided by the outcome he foresaw until the end.               Ajax killed himself because somebody else got a suit of armor he really wanted.  No it was because he felt he was not recognised. Agamemnon was a dick, achilles was much more prominent because he had more powers and odyseus didnt do jack shit.     Its more like the last thing he did fulfilled everything he talked about.     trinitarian garbage  Jesus died. God cannot die. Ergo Jesus was not god.      "hey Jesus, you claim you are the son of god, but we find that kinda offensive, so we will kill you UNLESS you can show us one of those miracles you are known for"   "I-I dunno guys, I don't feel like showing any miracles right now"   "Dude, we're gonna nail you to a cross, that shit is painful. Show us a miracle and we will all believe you are the son of god, follow your teachings, adopt what you preach and usher in a time of peace and prosperity."   "N-nah guys, it's all good, I'd rather die... But I could totally turn you all into pillars of salt if I wanted to."   "Alright then, we're also gonna kill all your followers and prosecute christians for the next couple hundred of years, but as the son of god, you already know all of that I'm sure"   "Y-yeah, that's all part of the plan.. hehhe..he"         Can batman and superman be summoned?   He was back three days later  He died in the same sense Arcuied died, it cannot last since he's divine. He allowed himself to die temporarily to do some things in the afterlife.       Fine then   Gather Jesus blood in cup   Become literally invincible   Win grail war because you cannot die ever           he had all the powers, yet he could not use them selfishly since he was trying to show that humans could live properly even with their limited means and weakness.   Yeah, either that or he had zero powers and didn't use them because he was a charlatan. I wonder which is more likely.       has superpowers, can get everything he wants   probably spend centuries fucking his balls blue and doing w/e   lives in eternal boredom   decides to see do the ancient times equivalent of baiting, starting a religion   shit goes according to plan   they ask him for a miracle   knows that if he puts out he goes back to being hounded down by sluts wanting their wishes fullfilled and men wanting to use his powers for his own   decides not to   gets killed   revives    laughs as everyone believes his shit even though he didnt do jack               They also had much fewer common names, especially in the western world. People having the same name and being in the same area wasn't uncommon. And even if there was only one person recorded as Jesus of Nazareth, son of Joseph, that doesn't mean a lot, especially since they apparently snuck out of Palestine and went to Egypt without king Herod noticing, even though he was actively looking for Jesus. Even so, if the evidence was actually that specific, Christians everywhere would throw that fact around with a great amount of zeal, which they don't. I've actually gone to archaeological lectures about digs which seem to seek sites important in Jesus's life, and it would be basically impossible to prove that a boy or man named Jesus of Nazareth, son of Joseph was ever there. The best evidence is that early Christians celebrated them as holy sites, and by early it's usually several centuries after the death of Christ and the councils of Nicaea.    Getting caught was a part of his plan.  Define death.      Bull the trinity orgin lies in pagan beliefs adopted by catholicism and is in no way shape or form from the Bible. Jesus acknowledged that he was the son of God and not God himself. They don't even have the same name. God's name is YHVH otherwise translated as Jehovah in English. It means "he causes to become".     especially since they apparently snuck out of Palestine and went to Egypt without king Herod noticing  Is it so unbelievable considering he's supposed to be a God? They were literally forewarned.      God's name is YHVH  That's what the jews say. Frankly I think God doesn't need a name because it's a human concept.      What are you Implying? The jews worship the same God as the Christians. And who cares what you think? God has a name and he wants people to know it.   Jesus powers:  Can heal any injury or illness Can revive the dead (including himself) Can manipulate natural forces to almost any effect Can create things from nothing (including life) Can exorcise demons Capable of creating relics of insane power through his blood (holy grail grants invincibility/immortality, spear of longinus makes whoever holds it unable to lose in a battle and so on and so on)  Nigga would be broken as fuck. Literally can't die and if you die he can just revive you anyway.            I'm saying if they could get to Egypt without attracting the attention of a local warlord who had an active interest in finding them, it's pretty realistic that the Romans also wouldn't have kept records on them, especially considering the fact that the Roman Empire seems to have been pretty lax in its governing of the provinces, Palestine in particular, which the story of the crucifixion supports. My point there is that lack of accurate records don't prove that Jesus didn't exist, and that vague records certainly don't prove that Jesus did exist.    god has a name because he knows people need to put a tag on things. When he was a burning bush he had a name that was required for that moment.    He could revive after three days perhaps, in which time the master would be vulnerable.    But Jesus did do miracles according to the Bible to show people he is the son of god. He didn't have to call down angels and kill those Romans, he just had to back up his own fucking claims by showing them one micracle. According to his followers, he did those miracles all the fucking time, but suddenly when it's not in front of a bunch of gullible peasants, he believes doing miracles is abusing power and shit and he doesn't wanna do that.    You forgot to mention he could call in a legion of angels in anytime he wants. And remember one angel was powerful enough to wipe out 185000 assyrian troops in one night.  Than how come that name is used over 7000 times in the original Bible manuscripts if it supposed to be a one time thing?      Yeah, too bad God couldn't do shit against iron chariots.    Fuck you, now I am imagining Shirou fucking Wonder Woman.    because most of the bible was recorded at one small timeframe based on centuries of oral tradition. So it would make sense they picked one name.     millions of people have died because of him  If my Grandson killed someone am I at fault?     Jesus would be an amazing comic relief servant. He constantly brags about how powerful he is and all the crazy shit he can do and his master totally believes him, but he never does any of it because of reasons. Every battle he gets instantly killed and ressurects 3 days later, just to be killed again until his master finally dies or runs out of command seals.    yes that is what southpark does.   This is slowly becoming a fedora thread    This guy  Anytime the Israelites ever lost a battle its because they did something wrong. Every single time.  Than that implies that you don't believe that the Bible is inspired by God. If you did you would understand that all of the Bible writers wrote the Bible under divine inspiration.        If you did you would understand that all of the Bible writers wrote the Bible under divine inspiration.  and how would this divine inspiration not tell them one and the same name?    jesus can summon all the warriors of the crusades to fight for him. heck he can make new divine things with his blood.    It's not even that consistent. Genesis for example uses both "Yahweh" and "Elohim", probably because of the polytheistic nature of Semitic mythology that wasn't fully eradicated from the Old Testament.     God cannot die  I dispute this, in the context of death as a cessation of mortal life, not of existence in total.     Uh, I don't think Judges 1:19 leaves much open to interpretation, /a/non. Feel free to drink the kool-aid, though. There are also multiple biblical passages which contradict each other, suggesting that at least parts of the bible weren't divinely inspired, unless you engage in a large amount of doublethink. Not to mention the fact that biblical texts have been revised, and the apocrypha were excluded from the biblical canon.    Because the reason he'd be doing it you fucking maggot.   Bread and fishes  It was a wedding and they had no food, so he selflessly gave them food, for no reason other than being good.  Healing the sick  He did so, because they where sick and they could not be healed, he did all that was in his power to heal them selflessly.  Summoning the host of angels to burn rome to ashes because he's gonna get crucified  That's not selfless, he died for peoples sins to show them that there is salvation if you're good and live with no sin.  THIS ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE ANON, SPICS GET IT.           Imagine than jesus its summon in a holy war and Jean the Ark is summon too.  That could be really funny.     But those crusades went against anything he was teaching. Why would he summon a bunch of sinners from hell who murdered in his name?     אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה     You forgot  Can only use them selflessly, what that means is really up to him.      So why did he walk on water? What was the selfless act there?     be a cute girl that wants the divine dick   jeane cucks you       the twist is that he doesn't give a shit about winning and just wants to see how everyone is doing personally      No. He can perform miracles whenever he wants. He just refused to do them to prove his authority or for selfish reasons. It's not a restriction though.     That's exactly why he has only one personal name.  To save Peter who was drowning wise guy.  That wasn't on God. The Israelites were to afraid to fight despite God being with them. Where are the contradictions that you speak of oh euphoric one?        God can do anything otherwise he's not God.    But I specifically mentioned that he didn't have to summon angels to kill those Romans, you retard. He could have just picked a random sick person and healed them while those Romans were around to see it. I guess those sick people didn't deserve to be healed because that would have lead to Jesus not dying, which would be against god's plan? In which case, didn't Jesus act very selfish by ignoring to help those people just so he could die according to plan?    So Gilgamesh, basically.   You can't be Christian and claim the Old Testament to be be completely right. Jesus makes a point of correcting a lot of what was in the Old Testament in the New Testament.    To save Peter who was drowning wise guy.   You don't need to walk on water to save a drowning man. Swimming works just fine. so either he did that miracle to show off or because he was too lazy to swim, but it wasn't for any selfless reason.       &gt;God can do anything otherwise he's not God.  not really, God doesnt have to be able to everything, he can just be very powerful. God being omnipotent is just a medieval invention.      jesus goes to pray   his niggas on the boat went away because wind   He walks on water to get to them   They think he's a ghost about to spook them up   He be like "Chillax my african americans, it's me your mainest nigga"   Pete be like "If you mah mainest nigga tell me to come to you on the water"   Jesus be like "Come bruh"   Pete starts to walk on water but gets spooked the fuck out and starts to sink yelling like a bitch "PLEASE SAVE A HOMIE!   Jesus walks to him and helps him out and be like "nigga hav sum faith, why ya doubt the mainest nigga?"   Then he climbed to the boat and the wind was like "ain't havin none of dat sheit" and fucked off back to Oklahoma   all of jesus hommies be like "You dah mainest nigga bruh"                &gt;be a cute girl that wants the divine dick  I can see she falling in love for him, but he is already married.    Let me see if I have this straight.  Some guy is trying to argue that the circumstances described in the Bible about Jesus' crucifixion suggest that he can't perform miracles therefore he's not the son of god.  But by taking the bible as a factual source he's admitting that events happened in the bible are exactly as described.  Therefore things like Jesus resurrecting, performing miracles, etc are all true. So he's the son of god.  What are you arguing about again?           Are you serious?  Okay. His NP will be:  Rudolph who grants him lightspeed as long as Santa is within his sleigh   Judgement of Character which dishes out damage according to the behavior his enemy had during their lifetime.The more evil a person, the bigger they get hurt.This damage bypasses the concepts of defence, durability and endurance and cannot be avoided.Santa needs to have knowledge of the other Servant's acts during their lifetime and marked him on his list for bad behavior otherwise he cannot use it, so naturally he can't use it either without knowing the identity of his enemy.   Toy Factory.A Reality Marble based upon the believes,wishes and dreams of children throughout the course of history.Within, the factory will create whatever they desired and desire whether materialistic or abstract, realistic or imaginative.But Santa is obliged to to not make true what he deems as bad.           Ignoring your ad hominem, since I did provoke it, it seems odd that bible didn't say that the Israelites were afraid, and so they couldn't defeat the iron chariots. Instead, the bible states that God was with them, but even then they couldn't defeat the iron chariots. And since you asked, the largest contradiction, in my opinion, is the concept of free will in Christianity. God is all knowing and omnipotent, and created everything. Therefore, we can conclude that he knows everything that will happen, and knew this from the moment of creation. Thus, free will would be an illusion, since everything was predetermined from creation. I personally find this rather disturbing especially because God punishes his creations for doing what He deems evil, even knowing that they are in fact inevitable actions.    There are people in this thread that think Servant Jesus would be a normal dude.  Servants are shaped by their legends so Jesus would be stupidly powerful. Iskander was never able to summon bis army anytime he wanted (he actually wasn't that close to them in real life) but it's his NP     One big city in the US probably has as many people as 30 AD.  You don't seriously believe that, don't you?    Can you summon Heroic Spirits if they're still alive? If not, I can't see how you could summon Santa. Also, Jesus would not be part of the same group of spirits that the Grail draws from for summoning unless I am misunderstanding something.   Caster could maybe summon him, like she summoned Sasaki Kojirou.    Not him, but the estimates Google gives me (from official census places and shit) suggest that Tokyo has 10-20% of 30 AD's population, which is pretty mind-boggling in and of itself.     Get on the grial wars   Get motherfucking JESUS as your summon   All he does is help other people and ignore the war       Who eligible to be a heroic spirit would still be alive? There's Santa as you mentioned and maybe Cain with his whole cursed to walk the earth until the end of days thing.    If anything, you could help him stop the war considering he doesn't want people to kill each other and the grail's existence is heretical.    How many people do you think lived in 30 AD?  Hint: not fucking anywhere near million      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World<wbr>_population_estimates  Educate yourself  </wbr>    You're right, it was almost certainly over 150 million, as a low estimate.    Jesus never existed Look up Horus    Wandering Jew in the same vein, and any of those figures who wish for immortality but fuck it up somehow and shrivel into trees or forget their mortal lives or whatever    Oh shit, is Jesus Shirou's ultimate form? In an alternate universe does Shirou go back in time to be who he always wanted to be?   ITT: Trinitarian faggots spread their heresy   Couldn't King Solomon make for a totally broken but legal Caster?     Shit.     Why would Jesus fight in the war when he is the source of the TRUE holy grail?    It doesn't matter who he is. What matters is his plan.    Jesus is summoned   Shirou beats him because Shirou   butthurt christfags everywhere      If I pulled him off, would he die?    It would be extremely painful    Kirei summoning Jesus would've made for an amazing route.    Hey now, Jesus occasionally does cool stuff in South Park.    You're a big guy.    For Jews   Let's talk about Archer.    Ajax killed himself    himself    him       I'm GAR for him.    If I took his his clothes off would he die of embarrassment?    Could he magic away his guido tan and frosted white hair if he really wanted?    The sexiest.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12722449  You're GAR for the wrong guy.    Why is Kirei so fucking cool?   Since the Holy Grail is basically Jesus in a cup, does that make Einzberns clones of Christ?   It would be extremely shameful.     Holy Grail is basically Jesus in a cup   It's not Jesus, it's the root to Akasha if I recall, well I think it's mostly Angra Mainyu now but it was never the true holy grail.      Does Kotomine even provide any priestly services? Like does he hold mass and shit?    He's a red man.     Jesus in a cup  Are you saying that Michael Jackson has already accessed the Root?     4u    Yup.       This will never fail to make me smile. I should be used to it by now but thanks guys.       I'm happy that you're happy.    Does this mean Teucer is a grill as well?    He's a big guy.     I'm GAR for both.     This picture truly disgusts me.   In light of recent events, lets have a husbando thread. I'll start.    The best part about husbandos is that you can be more than just friends and its not gay at all.    He's just so comfy.    My husbando spends a lot of time away.     ;_;         Thank you anon  and you're husbando a cute.    What would the wedding between you and your husbando be like? Would one of you wear a dress? What kind of food would you serve? Do you have a song you share?   Excellent taste.     Post 'em!       it's reverse. Wardaddy is Ritsu, Machine is Azusa. And he gest bullied.   You know how this goes.  Anyone happen to know of any good doujins with straight traps fucked until they're gay?     It's probably cause they thought they were just some niche artist in a small pond. Then they find out they were in the ocean the whole time. It's intimidating.    DUDE http://exhentai.org/g/752289/7c1596<wbr>219d/</wbr>    Here's something. http://exhentai.org/g/827708/a34bf0<wbr>33b0/</wbr>    Too based. Thank you    Does anyone know how many oneshots from this artist are not yet uploaded? I really like the translated stuff so far (I think there is only one scanned untranslated story still, but I don't mind that).    wake up   check /a/   still no news about Hunter x Hunter  send help      it's relatively simple, but it's great sometimes    I love it.    I love HxH's art, but it's secondary to the story.    Gon was so muscular before, what happened? Did the wish return the babyfat?    It's cool   Is this his Aunt? NTR?   pls no        I say NTR  Look at the Dress, i am out.      The dresses arent the same.the girl has a blank white one while his aunt has some patterns and shit    Edit:the girl has small visible leaf and rose patterns while the aunt doesnt.   Does that girl on the top even remotely look or behave like Kaoruko?  Aunt fucking when?</blockquote>]
