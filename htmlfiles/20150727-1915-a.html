No Jojo has ever done that. Giorno did go through a bunch of shit, it just happens before the main plot when he was young. Part 5 basically just jumps straight into stand fights. Why? Because Giorno wants to be the leader of a powerful gang. It make no sense to have him weak at the beginning. Don't forget, from when they meet Trish to the end is two days time. Also, Giorno does go through shit, how many fucking body parts did he have to replace?</br></br>  <br>He was number one on the website too by votes<br>Stands should've been on the best anime powers list too<br><br>Either they avoid Jojo like the plague or someone has a huge bias</br></br></br></br>  <br> WatchMojo </br>  I think I appreciate 5 more for it's inventiveness, even if I don't believe it fully achieved what it attempted to do<br>By the time Stone Ocean rolls around the whole thing feels kind of stale</br>  <br>Thank god.</br>  <br>PRAISE THIS PHENOMENON</br>  <br>Father please bless me as I go later today to watch One Piece with a friend because he's trying to convince me it's good</br>  <br>So you managed to escape from <br>good job, Pucci</br></br>  <br> No Jojo has ever done that.  <br><br>Johnathan<br> When from spoiled rich brat with a sense of entitlement to being a proper gentleman with a sense of righteous and virtue because of all the shit DIO put him through <br><br>Jolyne<br> Went from street punk who thought she knew it all with a hate for her father to understanding the importance of family, needing to do the right thing, and stop the evil that was ruining the world and her family.  <br><br>Johnny<br> Went from bro-chad racer to being to depressed shit cripple to righteous driven killer who wants to set things in balance <br><br>Josuke is just a goonie hustler kid, Joseph is just Human Bugs Bunny, and Gappy is still in development. But they are more on the comedy side than being Shonen heroes.<br><br>But Jotaro and Giorno are just 1 dimensional characters with overpowered abilities that don't really had anything of value.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> DIO actually did deserve the #1 spot. Look at this</br>     somewhere, King Crimson is filing a copyright claim   <br>Thank God Araki got better drawing background characters in Part 7.</br>  <br><br>And you can add "Giorno - went from timid, abused and slightly retarded child to quiet, intelligent and kind". It just happens before the story starts, but you're shown it. Also, Jonathan wasn't a spoilt rich brat at all. His Dad was just a cunt. There's basically no difference in Jonathan in as a kid and Jonathan as a grown up. <br><br> Went from street punk who thought she knew it all with a hate for her father to understanding the importance of family, needing to do the right thing, and stop the evil that was ruining the world and her family.  <br><br>Happens in like, 2 chapters. Basically after she meets her Dad.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Watch Mojo <br>You're an irreddemable faggot for even subscring you worthless piece of shit, find the nearest jug of bleach and down it in one sitting</br></br>  <br>He got better at drawing characters in general</br>  <br>The huge difference I think with Giorno's backstory compared to the rest of the gang is that his life basically went hunky dory after he met that gangster, going to a prestigious boarding school and being swarmed by girls and all that.</br>  <br>One Piece is only good if you're a manchild who believes in LIFE IS AN ADVENTURE and FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS bullcrap.<br><br>Just fake being sick and save yourself the second-hand embarrassment.</br></br></br>  <br><br> it takes 8 seconds to say those words the dude said <br><br> 6 hours and 28 minutes is 388 minutes <br><br> 8 seconds = .13333 minutes <br><br> 388 / .13333 = 2910 <br><br>Pucci had already accelerated time to 2910 its normal speed by then.

Gives off Part 4 vibes.</br>  <br> Jojo <br>5<br> Villian <br>6, Diavolo is pretty cool too<br> JoBro <br>5<br> Team <br>5<br> Story <br>5<br> Stands <br>5<br> Fights <br>5<br> Art <br>same tbh<br> Ending <br>6<br> Overall <br>5</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> in b4 shit taste </br>  <br>shit taste</br>  <br><br><br>shit taste tbh</br></br></br>  <br>10/10 taste</br>  <br> shit taste </br>  <br><br>How to tell someone is a retard who can't tell the difference between "being a kid" and being a brat. All kids used to do shit like that in the 1800's. He didn't feel entitled to respect, he attacked the kids because they were bullying Erina. In fact, they are the ones who disrespect him becanuse he's rich. The chocolate bar was his, I don't understand what you're getting at there. Most kids don't have proper manners. Dio is an exception, he was *trying* to make Jonathan look bad. Also obviously I've read the manga otherwise I wouldn't have read part 5 and 6 you numbskull.</br></br>  <br>shit taste.</br>   Jojo <br>2<br> Villain <br>4<br> JoBro <br>7<br> Team <br>4<br> Story <br>7<br> Stands <br>6<br> Fights <br>4<br> Art Style <br>3<br> Ending <br>7<br> Better Overall. <br>4</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't read/watch jojo so i can't even speedwagon, what am i doing here anyways </br>  <br><br>what's wrong with part 5?

Alright I'll give it a shot.<br><br> Jojo <br>Jolyne<br><br> Villain <br>Gay Priest<br><br> JoBro <br>If Annasui would have stayed a chick she would have taken it, but I'd have to say Mista has to take it.<br><br> Team <br>5, eas<br><br> Story <br>6, easily<br><br> Stands <br>I'd say its about even, both had fantastic stands.<br><br> Fights <br>I'd say 5. AV wasn't afraid to hold back and showed how god damn brutal stands can actually get.<br><br>Plus Metallica vs King Crimson was probably the best fight in the series so far.<br><br> Art Style <br>I loved 5;s style, but late 6 just added wonderful atmosphere and detail to all the zany wtfery was going on.<br><br> Ending <br>Both of them were kinda eh, but at least seeing Diavolo getting his stand Nope'd by a fully sentient GER and then beaten to a pulp for three pages was hilariously anticlimatic.<br><br> Better Overall. <br>Even though I wouldn't rank it higher than 6 in a personal ranking, 5 did do a lot of things better according to the above questionnaire to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> dislikes Nazis <br>not all of them</br></br>  <br>It's hard to say that King Crimson is the strongest when you have The World and Star Platinum to compare to, especially the latter since it broke High Priestess's teeth and punched an incoming semi truck.</br>  <br> Jotaro is one of my favourites <br> Jotaro above Josuke <br><br>Care to elaborate? That isn't a very popular opinion.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Ranking parts other than 5 &amp; 6 <br>For what purpose?</br></br></br></br>  <br>They didn't read the OP.</br>  <br>Anon wasn't talking about Strength, but despite it's range being short than Diavolo's arm, it can punch through someone's torso with ease.</br>  <br>That's true, but 5 has a better setting I took that into account with story since there's nothing asking about setting specifically.<br><br> muh arrow <br>it's got it's place in the series, intertwined in the series as much as part 2 and that's all it really needs to be good.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Time stopping would do nothing if it will be erased.</br>  Is this a good meme?  best fights of each arc:<br><br> Part 1 <br>First mansion fight<br><br> Part 2 <br>Whamu arena fight<br><br> Part 3 <br>DIO's World<br><br> Part 4 <br>Highway Star<br><br> Part 5 <br>Secco / Green Day<br><br> Part 6 <br>Planet Waves / Green Baby<br><br> Part 7 <br>Real man's World / Civil War<br><br> Part 8 <br>Beetle Tendency( no actual good fights in Jojolion yet)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>I'm talking pure strength. I think you meant most powerful in that regard.<br><br><br>So can a lot of other Stands.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Non.</br>  <br><br>Whoops, my bad.<br>Revised<br> Jojo <br>Part 5<br> Villain <br>Part 6<br> JoBro <br>Part 5<br> Team <br>Part 5<br> Story <br>Part 6<br> Stands <br>Part 5<br> Fights <br>Part 5<br> Art Style <br>Late part 5<br> Ending <br>Part 6<br> Better Overall. <br>Part 5</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is actually a pretty good thread starter. I'll bite.<br> Jojo <br>Giorno. His approach towards enemies and allies was merciless but also very polite, a perfect successor to Jonathan. Jolyne did shit all.<br> Villain <br>Pucci. Crackhead Diavolo had the more interesting stand with time erasure, but Gay Priest's charisma almost equaled DIO's. <br> JoBro <br>I'll give this one to Hermes, since Bruno was almost leeching the protagonist chair away from Giorno. That's not something a JoBro would do.<br> Team <br>Part 5. Part 6 was all over the goddamn place with no concentration, VA squad could rival SC's in camaraderie and stand ability per member. Narancia is also a cuter girl than FF, all things considered. <br> Story <br>Part 5. Part 6 fights were shit save Ungalo and HW. Part 5 was filled with OP stand fights like Black Sabbath, Grateful Dead, White Album, Metallica, Requiem and of course King Crimson<br> Stands <br>Part 5. All OP as hell, fighting against each other. VA is like the DBZ to DB portion of JoJo.<br> Fights <br>Part 5 again, consistently good fights. Part 6 fights were more situational anyway, even the memorable ones like UW involved placing yourself in a certain position just to survive and beat up the user later. Following a baby and getting smaller isn't threatening either.<br> Art Style <br>5. I really want to give something to 6, but a good chunk of 6 features the worst artstyle Araki has ever had, which thankfully healed up by Part 7. At least 5 has remnants of good lip/face structure from Part 4 + all that fashionable clothing<br> Ending <br>Both were shit, but I'll give this one to Part 5 considering it gave birth to the most OP ability in fictional history and the fact that its JoJo actually won the final battle. <br> Better Overall <br>Part 5 obviously. And you know, I like Part 6. Even if it was a standalone manga it's still something I probably would have read, but Part 5 is just a fantastic arc that feels like streamlined Part 3. Granted it's still not the best, but it's definitely close.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"Super Strength: King Crimson is one of the strongest Stands, rivaling Star Platinum, The World, and Crazy Diamond. "</br>  <br> I have read a properly translated Part 5 </br>  <br>I dont like the way Josuke acts, I got bored of his hair act soon, I never liked his personality all that much, and the vibe I got from him was kinda douchey, I like Jotaro more, because I prefer his design, He was much more intelligent then he seemed, I never felt a douchey/ asshole vibe from him except his introduction, I found him to have a nice character, and I really liked how close he was with Joseph at times, never got a tightknit family vibe like that from Josuke except from when he wanted revenge for his dad</br>  <br>This is exactly how I feel about Josuke and Jotaro</br>  <br>good post</br>  <br>wow, someone who agrees with me, first person I've ever seen who thinks Jotaro &gt; Josuke</br>  <br> planet waves <br> good </br></br>  <br>Thanks anon</br>  Meppz are you here?  Now, new topic. Who is the best looking JoJo?<br><br>I'd say that it's a tie between Giorno and stripper Joseph.</br></br>  <br> Part 1 <br> First mansion fight <br><br> Part 4 <br> Highway Star <br><br>Excellent taste.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hard to say when they're all good looking</br>  <br>If we're going by canon clothes, I'd say Jonathan.</br>  <br> He doesn't like the Westwood fight </br>  <br>Agreed for all except<br> 5 <br>first king crimson encounter is best<br> 6 <br>Made in heaven/ C-moon is best</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gyro, easily.<br><br>Nyo~ho</br></br></br>  <br>I find Jotaro really attractive, though Jonathan wins out</br>  <br> The villain literally comes out of nowhere and doenst have any reason for anything was doing <br>No reason besides being a mafia boss with some serious mental issues and a daughter prancing around that, in his mind, could potentially become a threat later? It's more reason than Kira had to become a villain, since he was pretty much just a regular guy with a fucked up fetish.<br><br> And the protagonists ambition is just "I wanna be the best there ever was like no one ever was." <br>His ambition was actually to become like the only person who ever showed him respect and work beyond the law to actually help people. He flat out says that to Bruno after they fight, it's like you didn't even read this part.<br><br> Fights are great, but you can't pretend part 5 had a story, or is even connected to the overall arc of Jojo other than "muh arrow" <br>It has way more relevance to overarching story than part 4, and is a direct continuation to part 3 instead of being a slice of life with Jotaro, Joseph's bastard son, and the arrow thrown in the mix.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ringo the guy who had Mandom</br>  <br> watching One Piece <br>You're supposed to only read the manga.</br></br>  <br>Jotaro.</br>  <br> part 4 <br>- ties up loose ends with Dio<br>- explains where non-natural stand users (like kenny G, Cream, and Dio) come from<br>- Show Jotaro continuing to keep the worlds supernatural shit on lockdown with the speedwagon foundation<br><br> Part 5 <br>- shows here enya got the Stand arrows, from a guy who just got them through an engimatic means that only raises more questions<br>- has another offshoot joestar descendant from a vampire-human hybrid that using a human body somehow mixing Johnathan and Dio together that doesn't really add to the overarching "sealing up Dios loose ends" of the rest of the series. Just Dio's rape baby trying to be a gangster against an even more engimatic enemy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Jojo <br>Jolyne<br> Villain <br>Gay priest<br> JoBro <br>Mista<br> Team <br>The gay mafia<br> Story <br>part 6<br> Stands <br>Hard to say, sex pistols and sticky fingers were great. But shit like weather report and made in heaven were also great. I guess part 5?<br> Fights <br>part 6. Seeing Jolyne who got one of the shittier stands do some joseph shit was great.<br> Art Style <br>part 5 and 6 had the same fucking art style. Both were shit.<br> Ending <br>part 6<br> Better Overall. <br>part 6</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there any Josuke, Jolyne and Giorno threesome doujin?</br>  <br>What you should be asking is<br><br> Are there ANY good jojo doujins besides the lisa lisa /ss/ doujin? </br></br></br>  <br>never ever</br>  <br>Giorno.</br>  <br> Jolyne is a sexual masochist <br> she commands Josuke to repair her hymen over and over as he fucks her. <br> commands Giorno to grow more dicks with his Stand so she can suck them and jerk them. <br> All while her Stand binds her together in the optimal position for all this to happen. </br></br></br></br>  Why are there literally no doujins for Jojo? Explain this shit.  <br>Jojo's is pure</br>  <br>I had high hopes for the Joseph genderbend one.

Just Dio's rape baby trying to be a gangster against an even more engimatic enemy. <br>Except, you know, Dio's lineage continues to be relevant all the way down to the end of the fucking universe.

The whole part 4 arc is merely incidental, especially regarding the villain.<br><br> Yeah but that shit never actually came full circle and Gio was just a side note in part 6 where DIO SONS were literally a crucial plot point.  <br>It didn't come full circle because Giorno wasn't trying to reset the fucking universe. Jotaro had to check if Giorno wanted revenge for what they did to Dio and his existence alone already connects parts 3 and 6, even if Araki didn't use him in the latter.<br><br> Its like Araki knew he was a terrible character and just needed him out of the way. <br>You're too biased, anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly only Big was a threat, every other villain he just wolverine'd it.<br><br>As for changing, befriending the gang didn't add anything to his character.

Don't you get it? </br>  <br> The whole part 4 arc is merely incidental, <br><br>Wrong. Jotaro didn't even come for Josuke. He came because Hermit purple took pictures of stand users in morioh.

Jotaro didn't even come for Josuke. He came because Hermit purple took pictures of stand users in morioh.

Build changes according to the progression of the Stand User, starting out as a scrawny twig, and eventually becoming something akin to Star Platinum. When active, the Stand situates itself behind the user, leaning on the users shoulders and painfully pressing squeezing and leaving indentations when the user overuses its ability.<br><br>Ability: Amplifies the users desire for progress, and enhances the benefits of all training. Through this, the user progresses at an inhuman rate, acquiring months worth of progress in days, or even hours at times. Eventually evolves to let others benefit from a lessened version of this at the users discretion. However the Stand only has a finite pool of "progress enhancement", and the more of it that is given out, the less is available for everyone else, including the original user.

Araki just made GER to overpowered that if he did go after Pucci , Pucc would have a hard time getting away from even with his plot armor.</br>  <br><br> Gee Emporio, how come your parents let you have TWO stands? </br></br>  <br>1) I'll give you the manga one, he had no way to know DIO would use knives<br>2) Jotaro's really fucking smart, and even if he wasnt carrying one on him, he probably saw one somewhere and decided to pick it up</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure he didn't show up because there would be no possible way for Pucci to beat Giorno.</br>  <br>Well he didn't have to go with Jolyne, he could interact with Jotaro, Joseph and/or Josuke.</br>  I love Gappy his stand like Crazy Diamond is one of those that you can picture using for all sorts of things.<br><br><br>Yes, still considering his personality they would've just gotten swept along and killed if they stuck with him. Diavolo could probably fuck over even Jotaro.</br></br></br>  <br> Jotaro not being dead from taking direct blows from the world. </br>  <br> Whitesnake would pull out some new power that negates GER. </br>  <br><br>Shit, I fucked up, I thought you replied to me.</br></br>  <br>It's called toying around and is the reason why Dio even bothered testing his skills on Jotaro in the beginning instead of outright killing him.</br>    <br> It's called toying around <br>Please no, I can't force my self to think it's anything but a asspull that jotaro survived that. If DIO himself punched Jotaro one time he would die.</br></br>  <br>And someone like Steely Dan manages to take an entire Ora barrage without getting covered in blood and its never confirmed hes dead</br>  <br> GER too overpowered <br> GER is overrated <br> D4C is underrated <br> BtD is even more underrated </br></br></br></br>  <br>thanks Doc</br>  <br>GER is overrated but that's only because he is the perfect defense.<br><br> D4C and BtD are underrated <br>Hell yes<br><br> tfw you will never use Soft&amp;Wet to smell qt 2d girls from far away </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> C-moon is even more underated. </br>    <br>why does Johnny look like he takes multiple anal poundings every night?</br>  <br>I was talking more about offensive capabilities, but C-MOON sorta is overshadowed by MiH and Whitesnake, I can agree on that.</br>  <br> why does Johnny look like he takes multiple anal poundings every night? <br>Upper left corner.</br></br>  <br> condoms </br>  <br>Yea i wanted you to be the streamer again but we got one already.<br><br>Also, would you do it again? i don't know when tho</br></br></br>  <br> offensive capabilities <br>C-moon can do more damage in one punch than Whitesnake, pretty much one shot anyone that can't be a mobious strip. C-moon's intelligence is nerfed so bad but if he had Whitesnake's brain power I think Pucci would have won a lot sooner.</br></br>  wait so there's no such thing as a darkness stand?  <br> Black Sabbath </br>  <br> Black Sabbath. </br>   Jojo <br>I liked Giorno and Jolyne equally. I enjoyed them in different manners. <br><br> Villain <br>I enjoyed Pucci more. I identified with his intentions and religious desire. Diavolo was wasted potential but he had a very interesting design. But if we are to also include Doppio, then I like Diavolo a little more because of Doppio's personality.<br><br> JoBro <br>Mista and Weather Report, I believe, we're the best JoBro of both teams. Can't decide between them.<br> Team <br>They're both good, but part 5's gang had much more development than part 6's gang. So part 5.<br><br> Story <br>Can't really say, but I feel like part 6 had a much more powerful story for the Villain. However, part 5 had much better stories for protagonist character backgrounds.<br> Stands <br>Part 5 had very imaginative fights while part 6 had more bizarre fights. Though, the way both Giorno and Jolyne faced those fights were enjoyable so I can't decide. <br> Fights <br>Part 5 had amazing fights overall. Part 6, I feel, had lackluster fights but had incredible ones to make up for it, like Foo Fighter's fight with the Chinese master and Jolyne's fight with the Warden.<br> Art Style <br>Can't decide. <br> Ending <br>Part 6 had a very strange and upsetting ending while part 5 had a very satisfying ending. I like part 5's more despite how emotional part 6 made me. <br><br> Better Overall. <br>Overall, I believe both parts are very strong on their own so there isn't a better one or a worse one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>thanks for remembering for me! hahah I win again</br></br></br>  <br>you dont sound like a winner</br>  <br>Leave.</br>  <br>Maybe, it was kind of a hassle for me, personally</br>  <br>  MY PARENTS ARE DEAAAD  </br>  <br>And that is why they make up bullshit likes<br> GE made the snake out of part of PH <br> there are no comedy scenes in part 5 <br> the arrow wasn't built up <br> gio doesn't do anything/ gio solves all the problems and everyone else is incompetent </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Newsflash, everyone did.</br>  <br>Could someone tell me where this is from?

Literally gay priest tier in shittiness</br></br></br></br>  Can Jojo's kill servants?  <br> gay priest tier in shittiness <br> Implying Gay Priest is shitty. </br></br>  <br> doesn't like gay priest </br>  <br><br>If you honestly think it isn't bad you need to re-evaluate your life/grow up</br></br>  <br>I bet you're a Doppio poster.</br>  <br><br> liking gay priest unironically <br>go away and never come back</br></br></br>  <br><br> he Doesn't support gay Priest. </br></br>  <br>Did Pucciposters kill them off too?</br>  <br>When were Doppio posters a thing? I've only been here for like 1-2 months</br>  <br>There was only like one Doppio poster. There are are lots of seemingly unironic Pucciposters who spam the gay priest meme on any thread vaguely JoJo related.</br>  <br>Nice assumption</br>  <br>Basically this, I'm okay when its just Pucci_after, but other then that I dont like the meme, which sucks because I really like Pucci</br>  <br>Yeah it was sorta on the level that Hotpants meme is on now but it seemed like a few anons posting Doppio and Doppio-cosplayers during the anime. Gay Priest was growing stronger around that time.</br>  <br>D4C goes to other dimensions but the other dimension's time is not exactly the same as this one's. So he caught those homos in his power at least half of their body, and then moved that half to another dimension in the past. Effectively bringing half of their bodies that stayed here to the past creating a time loop and fucking up Johnny.<br><br> At least i'm 99% sure </br></br></br>  <br>This is how memes have to evolve. Pucci_after would get boring after a while so they found that Pucci's character and images of him seem to be fairly exploitable because of how much Pucci appears.</br>  <br>Pucci isn't as exploitable as Dio's Za Warudo and Wryyyy though. They're trying to milk a stagnant meme as much as possible.</br>  Reading part 4 now. Started reading a week ago. Johnathan and Joseph are definitely better than Jotaro. He seems like an autismo punchbot with a hard on for one liners. Josuke seems pretty good so far though  <br>yeah, I actually enjoy the others, hell I have pretty much every Pucci_ I know of, hell, I'm the first person I know of who used Pucci_praise</br>  <br> Pucci isn't as exploitable as Dio's Za Warudo and Wryyyy though <br>DIO's been a meme so I'm not agrueing with that. But Pucci himself is the right character for a meme like this. If you have to blame anyone it's the person who posted the first " Gay Priest is here now."</br></br>  <br> I'm the anon that first started using Pucci_smug images. </br>  <br>I actually haven't seen Pucci being applied to other anime, games, or music. It's the ultimate test of a tried and true meme like Bane. I equate this mostly to Batwanking like how gay priest is to the Goddamn Batman.</br>  <br>Honestly this is one of the funniest scenes in Jojo, maybe it's because I wasn't expecting it</br>  <br>Holy shit that looks great</br>  <br>That's because Pucci's only spotlight has been the jojo-manga. Barely anyone outside of /jojo/ even in /a/ knows him. DIO has been popular thanks to japan already making him a meme and the OVA and heritage in the west. Baneposting is a fucking supermeme thanks to a movie DIO is nothing compared to that. Pucci will be popular within /jojo/ and posted in the occasional /v/ and /co/ thread but unless the part 6 anime plays up Pucci 100% he'll be a /jojo/ exclusive meme with some more fans.</br>  <br>can we people who first started using a certain Pucci_ pictures all step up to which one we were doing? I'm </br>  <br>Loss is a supermeme. DIO has been referenced in lots of anime and video games and his clothes and powers have been referenced dozens of times. pucci_after.png is whatever but the fucking Pucciwanking is annoying. I haven't heard a single bad thing about him ever since.</br>  How does  Made in Heaven  work?<br><br>Does it really keep Pucci in sync with the current accelerated Universal time? Since if he really had normal Earth time compared to the others then he must have had some of the shittiest cardio on the planet. Cause by the time had reached JoJo and friends on the roof, the Sun had already gone up and down twice signifying that two full day had gone. <br><br>Or does this have something to do with the distance logic applied tot he dolphins?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It just works. Stick to King Crimson.</br>  <br>Cause DIO is way older and popular. When the average person who doesn't know much about Jojo is asked who's the villian it's DIO. I've already stated why. But in /jojo/ the current champion meme is Gay Priest. And There are a lot of Gay Priest posters who don't care bout a few telling them to stop. If we get to the part 6 anime it'll be worse than ever especially if they animated Pucci_after. there will be webm's edited and posted in every future /jojo/ threads. Youtube will also get in the on the meme Pucciposters will force it more. this is your future.</br>  <br>jokes on them, part 6 will never be animated because they don't know how to animate a universe dying and being reborn.</br>  <br>I don't get the basis of the Pucci meme, though. If there's anything to get out of a Part 6 anime, it's Anasui's antics.</br>   watching Gappy punch someone in the face <br>Bestfeels.jpg<br><br>I love stands and Soft &amp; Wet is second best ever, but god damn something about a flesh and blood Jojo decking someone else in the face, haven't seen that in a while.</br></br></br>   Jojo <br>2 &gt; 6 &gt; 3 &gt; 4 &gt; 7 &gt; 8 &gt; 1 &gt; 5<br> Villain <br>4 = 7 &gt; 3 &gt; 2(Wham) &gt; 6 &gt; 2 (Kars) &gt; 1 &gt; 5 &gt; 2(ACDC)<br> JoBro <br>7 &gt; 5 &gt; 6 &gt; 2 &gt; 1 &gt; 3 &gt; 4<br> Team <br>3 &gt; 7 &gt; 2 &gt; 6 &gt; 4 &gt; 5 &gt; 1<br> Story <br>7 &gt; 2 &gt; 6 &gt; 4 &gt; 3 &gt; 5 &gt; 1<br> Stands (Design wise?) <br>7 &gt; 6 &gt; 4 &gt; 8 &gt; 5 &gt; 3<br> Fights <br>7 &gt; 3 &gt; 6 &gt; 4 &gt; 2 &gt; 5 &gt; 1<br> Art Style <br>Late Part 7/6/3<br> Ending <br>Part 6</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> you'll never see Pucci kill jolye and Jotato animated in your life time. <br> You'll never see animated Pucci_after <br> You'll never see Emporio and Weather report's revenge pose animated. </br></br></br>  <br>So,  was he really an alien? . Also what was the point of him other than him being puking dice.</br>  <br> I don't get the basis of the Pucci meme <br>Pucci is a priest who loves DIO. So that means he's gay. Pucci wasn't my favorite villian but now that I see him doing this funny pose I like him more. Huh, Pucci is pretty quirky this is exploitable.<br> This is all it takes. </br></br></br>  Pucci is a forced meme  <br>This reminds me, what makes Kira so popular and likable?</br>  When will the inevitable shitstorm happen once a Part 4 teaser comes out?  HOTPANTS<br>O<br>T<br>P<br>A<br>N<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's like asking if Lelouch is alive at the end of Code Geass. Nobody knows for sure, and we never will.</br>  <br>I know what you mean man<br><br><br>is there a program/software that does this to pictures?</br></br></br></br>  <br> 6 <br> 5 <br> 5 <br> 6 <br> 6 <br> 6 <br> 6 <br> 5 <br> 5 <br> 6 <br>I wasn't that impressed with the fights in part five, and I absolutely hated Giorno since he was so out of the spotlight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kira was a cool villian was felt small-time compared to the rest. Kira isn't my favorite villian so I can't answer this. We're lucky he isn't a meme.</br>  <br>I wonder what his SBR counterpart is like.</br>  <br>Didn't Part 3 not even have a date until October/November?<br><br><br>I like how Araki has changed the pace of fighting, personally.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yep. It took a chibi fancomic to convince me that the teaser was actually released during October.</br>  <br>It's interesting seeing a Jojo fight hand to hand instesd of just Oraing people. Jolyne was one of the last few to go hand to hand.</br>  <br>What I find interesting is that Soft &amp; Wet isn't as much as a punch ghost as we've come to expect.</br>  I really can't  stand  the amount of wrong opinions in this thread.  <br>Technically even when Jolyne was Oraing shit with Stone Ocean it was still "her". Because the stand was just her entire body that took the shape of the stand on occasion<br><br> Jolyne was one of the last few to go hand to hand. <br><br>The only space between Gappy who currently decks people in the face and Jolyne the butch dike is the paraplegic terrorist nigger. Of course he didn't punch shit in the face.<br><br><br> I like how Araki has changed the pace of fighting, personally. <br><br>I like it too, stands are also pretty good this time around, also looks like things are finally gonna start happening instead of watching Gappy wander around confused.  Main bad guy of Part 8 when? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Jojo <br>Jolyne, Giorno is kind of bland. <br> Villain <br>Gay Priest<br> JoBro <br>Bruno <br> Team <br>Twink Mafia<br> Story <br>Part 6, Part 5's plot was basically "beat Diavolo up so that Giorno can take over his gang", and there were too many extraneous elements to it, result in it dragging on. <br> Stands <br>Part 6<br> Fights <br>Part 6 <br> Art Style <br>Part 5<br> Ending <br>Part 6<br> Better Overall <br>Part 6</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that was really satisfying</br>    <br> You'll never see Giorno even speaking to the other Jojos </br>  God damn it.<br><br>The first time I saw Gappy's hairdo I knew it was garbage and "Muh Jousuke" but for the love of god Araki did you need to keep the back-spike mullet whatever the hell bullshit?!</br></br>  <br>Hmm I'd say Jobin may be the bad guy or close to him and we havent met him yet. I honestly hope Jobin isn't the overarching bad guy though. <br>his stand Speed King seems pretty OP though, if what he can do is increase the speed of particles and thus the temperature. If he can raise it enough, he could basically burn people alive  like ACDC </br></br>  <br>Or maybe he can absorb heat, store it away, and transfer it to other things.</br>  <br>Correct your filename, that's Josefumi's hair</br>  <br> Oraing shit with Stone Ocean <br> Stone ocean <br>Don't go ASB translation on me. But yeah, Stone Free was a part of her body aswell but even then was still nice seeing her punching people instead of just relying on her stand. <br>But it;s not like No one else can cover themselve with their stands, Pucci completely changes into Whitesnake at one point and Hermes does it. It seems pretty useful.</br></br></br></br>  <br>https://dreamscopeapp.com/</br>  <br>Hmm maybe. I hope it ends up being a cool stand with cool fights though, that's the important part   please deliver Araki  </br>  <br>Jotaro uses Star Platinum many times to protect himself. And there's that one where he incorporated his actual strength into punching The World's leg.</br>  <br>I feel like Joubin is going to be the one bad guy that becomes a good guy that appears every part.<br> Speedwagon, Stroheim, Polnareff/Kakyion, Oyasu, the entire Part 5 crew, Foo Fighter's, Hot Pants/Diego <br><br>Should be a cool but not game breaking stand since I'm pretty sure he's just mid-boss.<br><br><br>Fuck can't believe I blanked on that shit, too much ASB on the brain.<br><br>Polnareff did that cool thing when he stabbed his sister while wearing Silver Chariot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I still haven't gotten over how great Soft &amp; Wet's design is. Like one panel it could look dorky as shit like in  but then he gets serious and you get pic related.<br><br><br>I fucking love Stand+User Rushes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks!<br><br>Do you have the original version of your pic?</br></br></br>  <br>But that sort of stuff only happened very rarely and didn't last long. Stone ocean actively had stand user use their stand's to reinforced their physical capabilities. Pucci was able to do it to dodge Stone Free's ORAs at one point.</br>  <br>I know right? Also I love the first time we see him   Ssh, Soft &amp; Wet  . I mean it's borderline rapey but I find it very cool for whatever reason</br>  <br>But when you see it happen, you know the user is giving it its all, like Dio adding The World into punching the steamroller with him in the anime.</br>  <br> Dio adding The World into punching the steamroller with him in the anime <br> DIO didn't need to the world to punch it. </br></br>    <br>well when the teaser comes out, you answered your own question<br><br><br>he's charismatic like DIO but he's not as straight forward about it. He maneuvers around social stuff instead of just placing himself on top of it by intimidating/ enticing everyone.<br><br>It's a different impact to see a guy just brush off some bullshit said by his wife then still make her a nice dinner and win her over. Instead of just seeing some guy flaunt his power to get respect, fear, or women. Faggot ass DIO just stood there when Pucci told him he didn't have to over complicate explanations in their survivor/ MiH conversation, Kira wouldn't have taken that.<br><br>DIO would be post Disney Miley Cyrus, and Kira would be early (more country) Taylor Swift. Yes this comparison was necessary</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fights <br> 7 &gt; 3 &gt; 6 &gt; 4 &gt; 2 &gt; 5 &gt; 1 <br> part 5 second to last </br></br></br>  <br>I think it made more sense without the Disney metaphor</br>  <br> he's charismatic like DIO but he's not as straight forward about it. <br>I just saw him as a good actor. But yeah, He wouldn't have been caught in bed with a little brown boy that makes him shut up for a moment.</br></br>  <br>It's also pretty neat how the JoJo's are getting progressively less-human looking stands, I doubt it could mean anything but it's still cool as fuck.<br> Star Platinum - Tribal Warrior looking fucker <br> Crazy Diamond - Foobaw player <br> Gold Experience - Robot Cyclist <br> Stone Free - Robot Slinky <br> Tusk 1-4 - Cutesy elephan-Oh god what the shit when did he get so big oh my god im unraveling  <br> S&amp;W - ROBOT DISH WASHER </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Jojo <br>6<br> Villain <br>6<br> JoBro <br>5<br> Team <br>5<br> Story <br>6<br> Stands <br>=<br> Fights <br>5<br> Art Style <br>Late 5 = Mid~Late 6<br> Ending <br>6<br> Better Overall. <br>6</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He doesn't really try to act suave until he got Bites The Dust. If anything, he tries really hard not to stand out but because of the way he displays himself, it actually wins over many who look at him.</br></br>  <br>The fights were great, but I just felt they could have been better, at least when compared to the others.<br><br>Personally the lowest grade I'd give for the rankings is like a C+.</br></br></br>  <br>The fact that he doesn't want to stand out makes him interesting. He just wouldn't be Kira if was just as charasmatic as DIO. DIO just straight up seduced grown men will just his presence alone. I feel Kira couldn't do that but he did have sauve. I liked seeing him with his "Wife". I wish part 4 was longer to see more of them together.</br>  <br> &gt;Tusk 1-4 - Cutesy elephan-Oh god what the shit when did he get so big oh my god im unraveling <br><br>Why am I laughing so hard I can't breath.</br></br></br>   Jojo <br>Giorno.

I visually liked seeing Whitesnake over Stone Free cause Whitesnake could show more expressions.</br>  <br> Why can't I breathe <br>It's the work of an enemy stand</br></br>  <br><br>Mr. Brightside<br><br>It resembles a spray can of paint similar to flesh starter. It has the ability to paint an object any color, and the object then takes on the properties of the new color. For example, a chain link fence painted rust red well become rusted and brittle, or a common snake painted exotic colors will become venomous.<br><br>Often used to troll people, like painting someone's milkshake off-yellow so it's spoils</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fun fact, that gif has 69 frames</br>  <br>Hard not to like them lips. But yeah, I like the mix of humanoid and non-humanoid stands.</br>  <br>That's actually a pretty cool and versatile stand<br><br>If you spray people with the red paint, does that make them start bleeding?</br></br></br>  <br>This is a pretty interesting stand ability. This is really good.</br>  <br><br>what's your favorite stand design?

His goals, back story, and philosophy also help giving him a unique and comfortable feel. It's also fun seeing him give assholes their just desserts</br>  <br>This is good like. I liked all of their designs aswell. I hope part 8 get's some better looking stands. Other than Soft and Wet and King nothing everything else is stale or to weird looking.</br>  <br>You really gotta hand it to him, he sure knows how to nail crooked women by mentally pointing them out</br>    <br> jotaro with 3 star platinums <br>that's 3 times the ora, maybe they'll harmonize?</br></br>  <br>Stale how? I think every single one so far is really memorable and neat.</br>  <br>Speed King has a wonky but good design, I can't explain why I like it<br><br><br>California King Bed, and Fun Fun Fun are kind of hit or miss</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck..how did I forgot about the best stand in part 8....I'm ashamed of myself.</br>  <br>3 times the Ora<br><br> FIVE TIMES THE MUDA </br></br></br>  <br>That's two stands out of how many?

I'm sure you'd rather sit around quietly nibbling hardtack, wishing it was cock, because there's no fun allowed in your zombie apocalypse.<br>What a faggot.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Literally pretending to be retarded. How is she any better than anon faggots then?</br></br>  <br>Why are you taking /a/ seriously. She's not pretending. She does get over it after 30 chapters or so.</br>  Why is Yuki so shit? She ruined the whole episode.  Reminder that it doesn't matter which Gurashi had more things go wrong with them, they are all in it together. Any Gurashi's problem is EVERY Gurashi's problem  Reminder that Yuuri is worst girl.  <br>I'm watching and reading this shit, and every time she's around I feel like skipping or just dropping the show/manga.</br>  <br><br> unironically disliking Yuki </br></br>  <br> Ditching the biggest optimist <br>You sound like fun.</br></br>  <br>she doesn't shit on your anime taste by deliberately making threads on them on /a/ so that everyone can shitpost in it and make you feel bad about it</br>  <br>I'm just waiting for Kurumi to turn into Nemesis and kill all the Gurashis. Talk about sharing your burden.</br>   ditching the core sanity radiator of the group <br>Have fun losing your mind.</br>  <br><br> not wanting to have some gruff, PTSD ridden friends to ride out the apocalypse with <br><br>Gay.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's kind of pretending. She has awareness and a full delusion like the one she claims to be in is literally impossible. In fact, its impossibility is brought up as a plot point.</br>  <br>She's not pretending, and being delusional will having certain degree of awareness isn't impossible.</br>  <br>If they dropped all the qtgrills for the adventures of an advance bioweapon I'd call it AOTY immediately.</br>  <br>Kurumi x Shovel OTP</br>  <br>She is, though. Obvious enough seeing her gear up, understand a zombie it's in front of her while pretending it's a student, and various instances of generally understanding the situation they're ok and suggesting things they need in a fun way.<br><br>Anyway, I said it's not like she's totally pretending; she definitely lost her mind to some degree but not the degree that is claimed. Miki caught her on that bullshit right quick.</br></br></br>  <br>Situation they're IN<br><br>autocorrect</br></br></br>  About Kurumi: Her strength all comes from her loyalty to her friends meaning her breaking point will probably come when the infection starts to cause trouble for the group. This will probably come out as a "It's all my fault/You guys would be better without me" moment.  <br>No. She's stronger than that.<br>It will be a dignified mercy killing.</br></br>  I'd think it's safe to say I'd ditch this nutjob at the first opportunity. There's nothing more morale-breaking and life threatening than dealing with someone who can't face reality, no matter how horrible it might be.  Who WOULDN'T you ditch?   people believe this will sell   <br>Yuki, the only one still capable of forcing me to smile even after I've given up any semblance of hope.</br>  Why doesn't Ruu talk?<br>Is she mute?</br>  <br>She was raped by a biker gang and lost the ability to talk.</br>  <br>Kurumi, for core offense and speed.</br>    <br>I have read somewhere that Ruu is just a Rii's delusional</br>  <br> being a team killer rise morale <br>Sure anon. With people like you is why the guy at the mall hide his wound, if you start ditching people they would never trust you.</br></br>  <br>It's more dangerous bringing a infected to the base.<br>Do you hear me Yuki and Kurumi?</br></br>  <br>I'd think it's safe to say I'd ditch this deadbeat at the first opportunity. There's nothing more nerve-wreaking and life threatening than dealing with someone who can turn at any moment, no matter how much you love them.</br>  <br>Then why save her if you're going to ditch her?</br>  <br>Necessary sacrifices.</br>  <br>She's protected by best girls</br>  <br>Nigga your team is only of 3 people and she is harmless.</br>  <br>And she's a useless waste of resources, so what's your point?</br>  <br><br>I want to protect her and have schizophrenic babies with her.</br></br>  <br><br>That asshole probably got that wound because he was always trying to find useless shit like wine or toys.</br></br>  <br>Well you are too but your mum keeps you around.</br>  <br> It's so true it hurts. </br>   people who think they could face the apocalypse without a source of fun when they can't even face reality without constant escapist entertainment   <br>I put it simple when Kurumi came back she said the girls that she fucked it because she trust them.<br><br>When Miki's came back he hide and lied about his injury because he didn't trust the people at the mall.<br><br>If you start ditching people just because hur waste resources you end up with no party or dead.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That guy was an idiot who was always looking for party items, that's why he got bitten. He deserves to be thrown out and fed to zombies.</br></br>  <br>Fuck this guy.<br><br>Also reminder he did a physical check-up on Miki.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, Alice.</br>   S-S-Senpai, it hurts    ITT: normalshit sitting in the comfort of his home, never having faced any kind of real tragedy/trauma, discussing in detail how rationally he would behave during the end of the world <br><br>the fact that you people don't realize how retarded you are just makes this sadder</br></br>  <br>why is there semen coming out of her eyes?</br>  <br>She's a semen demon.</br>  So is megu-née already dead? What was up with that scene in the tent, were they just acting calm so yuki didn't know a zombie was walking past?  <br>I'd ditch you first you sociopath geek.</br>   he didn't read Steve Jobs: The Manga    Reading the manga when you can watch the anime   <br><br>Steve did nothing wrong.</br></br>  thanks for the heads up      <br> 3, 2, 1, dead </br>  Is... is this real?  <br> caring about a scum of this earth misanthrope miser </br>  <br> Crabing <br> Crabs are the animal sign of cancer <br> Steve Jobs died from cancer <br><br>Aria was pretty redpilled</br></br></br></br></br>  Why some people said Steve Job is a psychopath?  <br>http://slated.org/good_riddance_ste<wbr>ve_jobs</wbr></br>  Steve Jobs was an autistic poser who threw childish hissy fits.  <br>fuckin nips need to learn to read actual books<br><br><br> crabing <br>triggered triggered triggered</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He supported a system of sweatshop labor and earned the most profits in the history of mankind by then using extremely aggressive marketing(i.e brainwashing) to charge people 500 dollars plus for something worth maybe total 30 dollars. <br>He literally invented the term 'designer electronics'. Now, as to if this is really a bad thing after all thats up for discussion, but many many many people suffered and still suffer because of apple.</br></br>  Get out.  <br><br><br><br>no way this is real</br></br></br></br>  Does it explain the origin of his turtleneck sweater?  <br> On a trip to Japan in the early 1980s, Jobs asked Sony's chairman Akio Morita why everyone in the company's factories wore uniforms. He told Jobs that after the war, no one had any clothes, and companies like Sony had to give their workers something to wear each day. Over the years, the uniforms developed their own signatures styles, especially at companies such as Sony, and it became a way of bonding workers to the company. "I decided that I wanted that type of bonding for Apple," Jobs recalled. <br> Sony, with its appreciation for style, had gotten the famous designer Issey Miyake to create its uniform. It was a jacket made of rip-stop nylon with sleeves that could unzip to make it a vest. So Jobs called Issey Miyake and asked him to design a vest for Apple, Jobs recalled, "I came back with some samples and told everyone it would great if we would all wear these vests. Oh man, did I get booed off the stage. Everybody hated the idea." <br> In the process, however, he became friends with Miyake and would visit him regularly. He also came to like the idea of having a uniform for himself, both because of its daily convenience (the rationale he claimed) and its ability to convey a signature style. "So I asked Issey to make me some of his black turtlenecks that I liked, and he made me like a hundred of them." Jobs noticed my surprise when he told this story, so he showed them stacked up in the closet. "That's what I wear," he said. "I have enough to last for the rest of my life." </br></br></br>  <br> he showed them stacked up in the closet. "That's what I wear," he said. "I have enough to last for the rest of my life." </br>  <br>Oh wow, that's pretty interesting.<br> It was a jacket made of rip-stop nylon with sleeves that could unzip to make it a vest <br>Kinda like those cargo pants that has zips around the knees that dads like to wear? Good lord.</br></br></br>  <br>80s Jobs was a really weird dude tbh.<br><br>Time he spent building NeXT and Pixar after getting fired from Apple taught him a lot of things, I suppose.</br></br></br>  <br>And yet 1000 times better than rms.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jsk<wbr>q3-lpQnE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br> Steve Jobs <br> not manga about Lord Richard Matthew Stallman <br><br>are you even GNU anon?</br></br></br></br>  fuck off of my board cancer  <br> for the rest of my life." <br><br>So he had 3 turtlenecks?</br></br></br>  <br>It said he made about a hundred of them, can you not read?</br>  <br>he also loved retarded patents so he could sue everyone he could<br>for things like rounded corners and other shit.</br></br>  I'd rather read the Bill Gates manga.  <br>Based Bill</br>  <br>Now I want a Xerox manga. It would be a tragedy, of course.</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>never knew about the manga but there is a steve jobs book and it doesnt look like autobiography, I might pick it up one day at my library, Ive never bought an iphone and ive only ever bought only one ipod 3g but i would like to find out why some people idolize this guy.</br>  <br>No one really stole from Xerox. They were completely unwilling to do anything with their computer research division. It was only after Apple launched the Macintosh that they thought "Oh right, home computing might be cool."</br>  <br>That's generally the desired outcome of brainwashing.</br>  <br>I imagine a slice of life, with a conspiracy going under that adds comedy touches due to RMS's inability to be taken seriously.</br>  <br>Could they find a douchier photo to put on the cover?</br>  <br> happy mac'ing </br>  <br>Why?

Kancolle is only about the money there is hardly any heart in it. They put a few references here and there just to make the stupid fans more loyal and real in more $, But its not like strike witches where everything is a reference AND a tribute to real heroes. Kancolle has virtually no honor embedded in it which would actually mean more than you think considering how both SW and KC are set in WW2 where combat was centered around honor. Think about that for a sec please.  <br>The shit ones.</br>  <br><br>You'd think that someone would fall for your shitty bait. Think before you post, retard.</br></br>  <br>But I like both.</br>    <br>Someone will actually bite this shit for real.</br>  <br>enjoy your reply<br> Reply </br></br>  <br>I really wanna sock smugbono in the face</br>  <br>1/10, I replied. Apply yourself.</br>  <br>That's no bueno.</br>  <br>Amen</br>  <br>What? Its seriously not bait dude I have a point you have to admit.<br><br><br>okay so you like it even though you know how it copied everything from SW it stole the concept just to make money. Theres as much honor in that as there is in double-crossing which is what you are actually doing by supporting both. <br><br><br>its not bait dude okay seriously i dont know why everyone is calling it bait. Im just a strike witch fan in a kancolle thread speaking my mind,</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nagato/Musashi <br>More like Kongou</br></br>  <br>Zuikaku or Shoukaku on both, probably, since her engine is more powerful than Yamato's.</br>  <br>Is it shiptoasting time?</br>  <br>Nagato</br>  <br>You're not trying hard enough, seriously. Are you this bitter that your SW threads have always been dead and pure circlejerk that you have to shitpost here?</br>    <br>shut the fuck up dude your are so fucking annoying its like you say the same shit over and over again in every thread</br>  <br>Kaga would lose to Zuikaku, Zuikaku has more horse power to back her up. She's stronger and faster than Kaga.</br>  <br> combat about honor <br> killing all jews <br> japs killing themselves <br> nanking <br> nukes </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yesyesyesyes</br>  <br>What does Bismarck's sweat taste like?</br>  <br>Yeah man, SW invented the mecha musume genre. Totally, there's nothing wrong with this logic.</br>  <br> Mogami-class has more HP than Yamato-class <br>damn</br></br>  <br> both SW and KC are set in WW2 <br> Kancolle <br> taking place in WW2 <br> most of the ships are from WW1 and inter-war period </br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;killing all jews <br>If we had known about the world they were going to create, maybe the rest of us wouldn't have stopped Hitler...</br></br>  <br>Strength does not equal to Power though</br>  <br> KC are set in WW2 <br>This is next level bait. You can't even get a basic fact about the series right.</br></br>  <br>Fumikane seems to be fine with making boatbucks off boatshit anyhow.</br>  <br/>  <br><br> small c </br></br>  <br>no im not bitter im just speaking my mind <br><br><br>dude okay im talking about sorties in air combat compared to in ships. in ships yeah you pretty much know whats gunna happen its either you see an enemy ship and you shoot everything you have at him and one sinks first or you dont see him at all . In air combat you never know what you will have to do to complete your mission. You can get jumped by like 20 enemies from above, or you can jump another enemy and every plane is different handling and speed. You might get his but still survive only to be shot down by flak later like the possibilities are endless so you need nerves of steel to be a pilot. but what does it take to be a ship commander? common sense? basically yes.</br></br></br></br>  <br> pow·er <br> ˈpou(ə)r/ <br> noun <br> noun: power; plural noun: powers <br> 3. physical strength and force exerted by something or someone. <br><br> strength <br> streNG(k)TH/Submit <br> noun <br> 1. the quality or state of being strong, in particular. <br> physical power and energy. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone doesn't know shit about naval warfare.</br>  <br>He chose the perfect time to bait. I never see any moderation of this time of day.</br>  <br>That still has nothing to do with honor. <br>The jap pilots always killed themselves like fucking idiots tho.</br></br>  <br>The same could be said for most of us.</br>  <br>I think he means the ol' Knight of the Skies Air Force thing over the European theatre.<br><br>Which actually fucked up the Germans in World War I because said knights would immediately go and fight other fighters instead of taking down the entente artillery spotters that mattered on the ground.</br></br></br>  <br>At least most of us would know what to do in a night battle between a DD and a BB.</br>  <br>T-torpedo cut-in setup and star shell?</br>  <br>Yes, get within range and unleash torpedoes.</br>  <br>Hold hands and rub our bare feet against each other's feet for snuggling purposes?</br>  <br>Who's the worse protagonist: Mamoru or Bucky?</br>  <br>In either one, I use my radar to detect- oh wait, Japanese ships don't have radar. Guess it's time to turn on my searchlights or attack individually and hope for the best :^)</br>  <br>I want Corea to fuck off. I'm glad the abyss sunk the peninsula in the Vita.</br>  <br>Psst, there was no "honor" to air combat. Most kills occur when the one who was shot down had no idea the the one who shot them down was even there.</br>  <br>yeah exactly thats what i mean basically<br><br><br>also dude ur knowledge comes from an anime (that copied another anime) which i actually find that funny that you think you know more than me.<br><br>Well actually the thing is that SW at least teaches you more about how it actually was in ww2 air combat because its purely a direct alternate reality. But Kancolle started from a game so in order to set their gameplay mechanics they tweaked it to make it fun losing the realism element. and this is translated to the anime as well which is apparently where you get your knowledge from. In review which is more accurate, info an arcade mmo money-grab game? or A direct alternate reality of ww2.<br><br><br>they are both good characters actually.<br><br><br>thats just not true i mean u cant just sneak up to someone, escpecially not a trained pilot with good eyes and when its clear day and no clouds out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I like Kaga but feel bad because I'm a lanklet and probably wouldn't be able to pick her up in bed. If stand side by side she's thicker than me.  I can be your sister ship for tonight.  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/824563/87c36a<wbr>cf52/</wbr></br>  Cutest CV, followed by Taihou.  <br>I know that feel, anon. It doesn't help that my two boatfus (pic related) are both BBs and probably a lot stronger than me.</br>  <br> lanklet <br>Don't worry about that, living with Kaga will make you fat in no time.</br></br>  <br> more than one dude <br>Disgusting</br></br>  <br>Kaga is super cute</br>  <br>Did the artist forget to draw in the first pages or what?</br>  i am looking for a sad doujin that admiral tries to marry kongou but it doesn't ends well  <br> still not knowing kancolle takes place in moder times <br>Bait harder.</br></br>  Which Kamo would you kamo?  <br> swinging <br>I am disgusted</br></br>  <br>I'd kamo both of their faces.</br>  <br> SW at least teaches <br>SW teaches you nothing but planelegs with superpowers win war and shameless pantsu fanservice. In KC, you get an armada of ships in your arsenal: from CV, DD, SS, etc. unlike SW which Witches are the only ones who can fight Neuroi effectively. Also, please use your fucking caps and punctuation next time, retard.</br></br>  <br> Has the artist improved at all ever since he done these? </br>  <br>Be a man worthy of Kaga</br>  <br>Atago looks insane</br>  <br>You can't really blame Izuki Tazuku.</br>  <br>Yeah that craze eyes</br>  <br>You do know these ships had multiple admirals right? Swinging comes natural to them.</br>    <br>And this.</br>  <br>What kind of man is worthy of Kaga?</br>  <br><br> Those 2 with their imoutos never. <br><br>I hope the artist could grant my wish.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>i wanna to make takao and atago mothers.</br></br>  <br>There's something really wrong about Takao's torso here.<br><br>Same with Atago here.<br><br>This one looks really good, I guess torsos are really hard for him, otherwise they look really good, but Im worried that they are losing meat over time, not bueno.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I want Takao back.</br>  <br>The Arpeggio one is from when the anime was airing, they stopped being fat for that long you just don't know because they don't have a kai 2.</br>    <br>A strong man that will protect her from danger like me.</br>  <br>Why is he a holding a daki when she's right beside him</br>  <br>Imouto style miniskirts? No.<br>Medium turquoise clothing? Yes.</br></br>  <br>They always being curvy, with not that much belly extra meat.</br>  <br> thats just not true i mean u cant just sneak up to someone, escpecially not a trained pilot with good eyes and when its clear day and no clouds out. <br>You're retarded but I feel like educating you today. <br><br> Soon Erich had fully developed the tactics of air-fighting from which he would never subsequently depart. The magical four steps were: "See-Decide-Attack-Reverse, or 'Coffee Break.' "In lay terms, spot the enemy, decide if he can be attacked and surprised, attack him him and break away immediately after striking; or if he spots you before the strike, take a "coffee break" -wait- pull off the enemy and don't get into a turning battle with a foe who knows you are there. The rigid observance of this tactical sequence carried Erich Hartmann to the top. </br></br></br></br>  Shirinue.    <br>Not enough Kaga?</br>  <br><br><br>Its important to stay limber for torpedo cut ins.</br></br></br>  Is she a chuuni?  <br>No, just a obsolete CL.</br>  <br>yeah thats one guy that flew in one plane? what about the legit millions of OTHER pilots in different planes dumbass. You are the dumb one here. go ahead and act like you know anything and now let me educate YOU<br><br>Take Hans joachim Marsielle for example who actually had succes turn fighting hurricanes in west africa. The opposite basically than hartmann.<br><br> I often experience combat as it should be. I see myself in the middle of a British swarm, firing from every position and never getting caught. Our aircraft are basic elements, Stahlschmidt, which have got to be mastered. You've got to be able to shoot from any position. From left or right turns, out of a roll, on your back, whenever. Only this way can you develop your own particular tactics. Attack tactics, that the enemy simply cannot anticipate during the course of the battle – a series of unpredictable movements and actions, never the same, always stemming from the situation at hand. Only then can you plunge into the middle of an enemy swarm and blow it up from the inside. </br></br></br></br></br>  Prove to me that you aren't worthless piece of shit TTK.  <br>I have that poster.</br>  <br>Scan it then.</br>  <br>Because the daki has more personality than her.</br>    <br>I would prefer if someone scanned the Shirihime one tough.</br>  <br>Scan it</br>  RJ!  <br>Okay.</br>  <br>That just proves the opposite.</br>  <br> 1 medal <br>laughing ryuus.jpg</br></br>  Based TTK's.    <br> TTK's. </br>      <br><br><br>Some part of my know that it's not going to happen.

We're both only comparing 1 man to 1 man in a war that (as you said) involved many people, so lots start comparing groups.<br><br> The AVG was made up of three squadrons, The Adams &amp; Eves, The Panda Bears, and The Hell's Angels. They began combat operations on 20 December 1941 and officially disbanded on 4 July 1942. For seven months this ragtag band of Army, Navy, and Marine pilots were the only effective defense in the skies over China. Once organized, the men of the AVG recorded an unprecedented 70 to 1 kill ratio, 296 (although some sources say 286) enemy aircraft confirmed and an additional 153 probables for a loss of only 12 planes and 3 pilots in air combat. An even more impressive feat considering that the American mercenaries had virtually no combat experience while the Japanese had been fighting in China for years. <br><br> The tactics of The Flying Tigers were the key to its astounding record. The early warning net (a primitive yet effective network of spotters and ratio operators set up to report enemy aircraft) would report the position, direction, and estimated altitude of incoming Japanese aircraft. The Flying Tigers would climb above the enemies' altitude on an intercepting course. On sighting the Japanese they would dive on them at high speed and slash through their formation, guns blazing. After the attack the Tigers would use the speed from the dive to exit the combat zone and climb for another pass. It was essentially a drive-by shooting. <br><br>http://www.chuckhawks.com/p-40_vs_z<wbr>ero.htm<br><br>These tactics do not allow the enemy to fight back as they can in a dogfight. That is why they are so successful. Compare dogfighter planes vs energy fighters and energy comes out on top.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>How am I supposed to do the pantyhose challenge without a BB with one?<br>Also as long she stays with the pantyhose, she will be cute.</br></br></br>    <br> no one is attacking her pantyhose <br><br>shittaste</br></br></br>  <br>Both Hiei and Kirishima have pantyhose , unless you kai ni'd them.</br>  <br>Don't Kirishima and Hiei wear them?</br>  <br>I tought it was a perspective trick, maybe I should look harder next time, I gave in for the proto after so long in having them in kai, I feel dirty.</br>  <br>They're jealous of her kai2 uniform, she always had the pantyhose.</br>  <br> jealous <br> they're all smelling her <br> jealous </br></br></br>  http://blog.livedoor.jp/geek/archiv<wbr>es/51500931.html<br><br>scans of that fashion thing never</br></br></wbr>  <br>No<br><br>Title: Kaga lock<br>TTK: It's already morning...<br>TTK: It's rare that I actually woke up without help<br>TTK: Oh, Kaga is here to wake me up...<br>TTK: I'll try pranking her<br>TTK: If I just suddenly shout, that would be too normal.

Is it hentai or an actual series?</br>  <br> How about characters that take a mature approach to sex like any fucking normal human being? <br>Sex isn't approached in a "normal" fashion any more since the sexual revolution. Feminism has opened the door to rampant sluttery and cuckolding.</br></br>  <br>Obviously all the anti-lewd shit is a way of keeping her own turboslut tendencies under control.</br>  Delicious ED edit.    What animu?  <br>I haven't even read the source material, but the moment I saw Anna I knew she would be the most cock-hungry of them all.<br><br><br>Have you seen Gangsta yet?</br></br></br></br>  <br>[Tomohiro Kai] Maraschino Cherry Kiss</br>  <br>Thank you.</br>  <br>Nah, Anna's mom still remembers how puberty was for herself. Thus, she knows what kind of raving cockmonger Anna's going to be, kid's got her DNA after all, so she wants to keep Anna pure.<br><br>Only question is, does she want to keep Anna pure because<br><br> The mother masturbated so much during puberty that she's never managed to enjoy sex and wants her daughter to not make the same mistake <br>or<br> The mother wants the daughter to be RESPECTABLE and is going a teensy bit too far to accomplish this <br>or<br> Anna's mom makes all these laws so that people finally come off their asses and give a shit about politics and she's gonna fuck them more and more until they finally do </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>hot it's on the pole ya dingus</br>  i wish kajo had longer bangs  So will there be more rape?  <br>There's going to be "Love honey" cookies</br>  <br>She needs a good gangbang.</br>  <br>There's no need for namecalling, Anon.</br>  <br>At least it makes sense in the context of this story. She actually knows fuck all about the opposite sex, because of society, so it works. It's just diminished by myriad stories without that kind of setting having it too, which is just shitty pandering for beautiful, perfect waifus that somehow do not grasp the concept of sex at age 17, which is more fantastical than any dragon or unicorn.</br>  <br>bruh that's aphex...</br>  it would be nice if the MC got some actual development, or if he fucking grew a pair  <br>Holy fucking shit, I thought that whole love honey thing was just some new /a/ trend word. This is actually kind of kinky and hot, but also like, disgusting. I mean, spreading it around the goddamn student council... it's like gorilla and tooscaredtobeaslut and MC have all licked her cunt now. And who knows who else got cookies from her, for all we know, her mom was the first to try them.</br>  <br>No, that's Richard D. James</br>  <br>She was only looking at him expetantly, so it's probably only his batch of cookies that got a bit of her "love honey".</br>  <br>The problem is that he's extremely generic even by harem standards. I think it's an incredible wasted potential to make him as bland as possible while we could have a cast full of hilarious characters.<br><br>I'd be fine with him being a beta if he at least proves to have some other character quirks.</br></br></br>  <br>what anime is this?</br>  <br>From opening i think he learns to be more open about his love for dirty stuff, like going around in a extreme outfit along with Ayame, so he probably accepts that side of him later on.</br>  <br>Boku no Pico.</br>  <br>O-parts: Oman</br>  <br><br><br>Why the ED is so good?</br></br></br>  <br>yeah i mean the whole "straight man" comedic role can only go so far before it gets tiring. i'm hoping what  says turns out to be true</br>  <br>I've been only watching [Hiryuu] until now, did I miss any other endcard?</br>  <br>The joy of finding another fetish is always so warm and reassuring.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128643562 <br>Can this trend of writing "important" things just finally lay down and die, please?<br>Because it's getting to annoying as fuck, especially when used with meme-words like "pure".<br><br> inb4 F A G G O T <br>   <br> F <br>   <br> A <br>   <br> G <br>   <br> G <br>   <br> O <br>   <br> T </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i was being stupid and ive missed all of the endcards<br>could you post the previous ones if you got them ?</br></br>    <br>I"M FED UP WITH THIS WOYILD</br>  Literally PENIS XDD - the anime.<br><br>Why do people even fucking watch this garbage.</br></br>  <br><br>Getting Hajame Sorayama to do the cover helps.</br></br>  <br>Better rape her so she understands why she must act like a proper girl from now on.</br>  <br>I found episode one's but not the others yet.</br>  <br>Not a lot of comedy out there, and this show is funny even without all the dirty jokes. <br> no fun allowed. </br></br>      <br>Thanks anon, I assume this is E2?</br>  Boku no Pico  <br>Also I've been using W2K to upscale them if anyone is interested.</br>  <br> pure <br> meme <br><br>Get the fuck out roastie</br></br></br></br>  God damn, Anna is like a bustier incarnation of this. Truly best girl.  <br>W2X*</br>  <br><br>Thanks, I hate when they cut off these things, Funi does it all the time, CR randomly and even fansubbers do it sometimes for not reason at all.</br></br>  best I could do with the limited funds available.  <br>Not bad, I like it. Mind if I save if friendo?</br>  <br>So Shimoneta threads are officially cancer now, right? It was fun while it lasted, but I think this episode killed the discussion potential.</br>  <br> f/a/ggots discussing anything  <br><br>Fuck off newfag</br></br></br>    <br/>  <br>It's going to cool off in a few days, besides, all threads are shit on weekends.</br>  His cock is so big he sees fear in women eyes.  <br>Thanks anon. This is episode 3's right?</br>  <br>Yeah.</br>   people actually watch this   <br> Fuwa Hyouka's face </br>  <br>I like how you're acting like you're really smart for figuring out spoilers that have been flying around in these threads for weeks.</br>  This show is damn good. Hope we get a second season so this semen demen is animated.  <br>Thanks again anon.</br>  <br>Ron Jeremy pls<br><br> Kajo touching Anna lewdly <br>But Kajo is less lewd than Anna. Not to mention they´re best friends.</br></br></br></br>   Riding Japan of lewdness <br> Having a low cut suit that shows off your white baby feeders. </br>   Main girl fights for muh freedoms and rights to be overtly sexual <br> Hypocritically scared of any actual sex <br><br>this smells like SJW propaganda. At least there's still God-tier stuff like Hen Zemi.</br></br></br>  <br>From what i´ve seen so far it´s doing well in the rankings. Which means a second season is totally possible.</br>  <br>She probably thinks that breasts are only for feeding babies anyway.</br>  <br> people actually visit thread of shows they don't watch purely to shitpost against anyone watching this <br>Sometimes I feel like I don't have a life, then I read posts like this and think compared to yours, my life must be fucking awesome.</br></br>  <br>Thought the excuse was that Japan's only that freaky in private and spill their spaghetti everywhere else.</br>  <br>So, Nips are basically Victorian Englishmen who have yet to grow the fuck out of their delusions? That would make so much sense.</br>  so our mc got raped. <br>I wonder how they are going to proceed with this, because if they blow it off like a joke that will be unfortunate. they have an opportunity to tackle a lot of really heavy themes and I hope they are able to do it deftly</br>  Anna scares me. Seriously, her first impulse was tie him up and try to rape him. She's gonna stab somebody at this rate. And why the hell is she leaking like a water cooler with a broken tap?  Is Saotome is worst girl?  <br>fuck off faggot holy shittt</br>  <br>I just read in another thread that it's doing around less than 2K</br>  <br>Don't forget she has Hulk strength. She could be downright terrifying if she went full yandere.</br>  <br> if <br>It's too late for ifs.</br></br>  <br>That letter was hanging on his door. He has no case.</br>  <br>He pretty much invited her in with that sign on the door, and it as just sexual assault, there was no rape cause they didn't actually have sex. Also it's echi, do you really think they're gonna bother?</br>  <br>The problem is that<br>a) this is a Japanese show, so no they don't even see the problem let alone feel the need to address it<br>b) MCs gonna end up apologizing to Anna for that whole fiasco<br>c) Thanks to Anna's mom being perhaps the biggest bitch ever and rivaling Kiryuin Ragyo in her parenting skills, Anna has no fucking idea she pretty much raped the poor kid and even if she understood what she did she wouldn't understand why that was bad<br><br><br>She never even heard of sex and is seventeen years of age. Hormones + all the sexual frustration of /a/ in a single body.<br><br><br>That's the problem with the japs, this situation and Anna's entire character could make for seasons upon seasons of fascinating psychological drama, but that would alienate their otaku audiences and deal with issues the Japanese always brush under the rug as much as possible so they'll just turn it all into a dumb joke.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well rip shimoneta</br>  <br> I was having full-out sex with when I was 15 <br>That's exactly what I meant you idiot</br></br>  <br>Yeah, holy hell those Finnish genes. Come to think of it, do animu characters with Finnish ancestry tend to be freakishly strong for some reason, or is it just me?</br>  Honestly I'd like Anna a lot more if her hairstyle wasn't so fucking terrible  <br>Is that the thought police chastity belt? It got passed?</br>  <br>you mean, if her hair was kinda like <br>this? I hear you, buddy.</br></br>  <br>What the hell is written on her shirt?</br>  So couldn't they use the fact that Anna's a total pervert and would even sexually assault Okuma to their advantage? They could use this type of evidence in a way that could damage the image of the side trying to restrict lewdness or even use it as blackmail against Anna's mom since she's a major pusher of the laws.  <br>No just that medium lenght hair with bangs is absolute shit</br>  <br>Because it's a fanservice series</br>  <br><br> source </br></br>  <br> Japanese show <br> expecting common sense <br><br>Of course not, dummy, Kajo was too pure and disturbed by what she saw to take photos and MC loves Anna too much to do something eeeevil like that. Maybe granny-voice painted it, though...</br></br></br></br>  I would like Anna more if- just kidding I hate Anna and Kajou is better  <br>That's just downright disgusting, anon-kun.<br><br><br><br> dat gay gorilla at the back </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Never mind, figured it out. </br></br></br>  /a/, give it to me straight: can gorillas be homosexual?  <br>Kajo and Anna are best friends. She wouldn´t blackmail her or try to ruin her reputation. Same for Okuma.</br>   Cutest girl is just used as a bully bait background character   http://webm.host/82a62/<br><br><br>We postin' lewd?</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ms9<wbr>NVc22HIs</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Such a cute! CUTE! <br><br>I want to steal her panties and make her cry!</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Ayame or Okuma would want to damage her reputation like that, Ayame is her best friend. also her parents are politians, they would probably do something to preserve their own image or go "see, even our pure daughter has fallen victim to depravity from a small ammount of it" then enforce much harsher laws.</br>  <br> Don't call it lewd anon.  Do you want then to jail you? </br>  <br>AOTS</br>  <br>holy shit</br>  <br>Can´t really go much harsher than mandatory chastity belt. Well maybe a device that reads your thoughts or something. If that exists in that reality.</br>  Fuwa &gt; Kajo &gt; Anna &gt; Saotome    <br>For some reason i keep thinking that the elite collars are somehow special, like Anna is so pure but her collar would and parent's would actually allow then to say something considered lewd. <br><br>Some anon said the design is just different tough, i guess it would be too much of an easy plot point to see coming.</br></br></br>  <br>"normal" human beings have an amazing amount of fucked up relationships. Besides, you could just watch any western show where they have sex and nothing else.</br>    <br>New chapter never.</br>  uncensored when  You know, strictly hypothetically speaking, if the monitoring technology existed, it's not the absolute worse possible idea ever to fix their declining birthrate.<br><br>1) completely cut off external media and entertainment from the rest of the world<br>2) pass a bunch of laws outlawing "lewd" and sexual items and material<br>3) spend a generation's worth of time getting rid of all the existing "restricted" material<br>4) completely remove all reproductive information from educational curriculum<br>5) spend another generation's worth of time brainwashing the idiot masses that this is the new norm<br>6) watch the next generation grow up without knowing anything about the human body or how reproduction works<br>7) since there's nothing "lewd" left, whatever they feel and do must be the result of "love" and is therefore okay<br>8) massive spike in pregnancy rates as kids going through puberty experiment with each other without any sort of societal or ingrained taboos or limitations<br>9) ???<br>10) population boom!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it works regularly. They´re mandatory by law and i don´t think a politician´s family wants to break the law or get found out that they circumvent it. Also i guess the collar on Anna is to make sure she stays pure. Her mother is probably a huge control-freak. I´m actually surprised she didn´t feed her daughter anti-hormonal medicine considering she is in puberty. And we all know what puberty does to you in terms of horniness.</br>  <br>Please stop.<br>You don't have talent for this.</br></br>  <br> 9) ??? <br> 10) STD and homosexuality boom! </br></br>  <br>Is she holding Ayame to knife point? It kinda looks like there's a knife pointing to her neck there.</br>  <br> How about characters that take a mature approach to sex like any fucking normal human being? <br>What's the appeal?</br></br>  <br>so far</br>  I wonder if the rest of the world is in on this thing. I mean, what if a jap had to get out of the country on a business trip, and then he found a lot of lewd while he was out?  <br>Yep, looks like it. She is going hard yandere now/soon. We can only pray for the survival of everyone else.</br>   Tfw you had the urge to fap after Anna raped Okuma.   <br>All I hear with that voice actress is Hisui, so lewd Hisui is pretty fantastic.</br>  <br>It's a plot hole that will never be addressed</br>  <br>garbage season overall after all</br>  <br>My nigger<br>She's the main reason I watch the ED fully every time<br> aahaaaaan~ </br></br></br>  <br>only BD, right?</br>  <br>Anna:I wished for Okuma-kun to also taste this feeling<br>Anna:So i gave him my nectar in this manner for Okuma-kun<br>Okuma: Kajou-sempai...!!! Don't go towards the light! *It was me who ate it anyways*<br>Anna: Love is truly fantastic, don't you think?<br>Kajou: I never tough Anna was capable of this...<br><br>The rest is explaining how they lost a lot of things, but now the young artist girl finnaly got into lewd drawing to help their cause.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that the voice actress of trap is the same person that sana the ending  <br>What do you mean? It is uncensored. Funi censored some of the pussy juice and drool. But you can watch Clawhammer or Hiryuu for the uncensored version anyway.</br>  <br>*sang</br>  <br>Craaaazy. If only she knew how much she's hurting her chances with Tanuki.</br>  <br> bully bait <br><br>Those are the best kind of girls, the ones that always feel helpless and need you to protect them.</br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't matter as long as the children aren't corrupted. Also if they bring gaijin lewd filth they get thrown in jail so it's no big deal.</br>  <br>Thanks.<br><br>But the trap isn´t in the show yet?</br></br></br>  <br>She just wants to tell dirty jokes, not look stare at another man's gizmo. She isn't the token slut of the series.</br>  <br>Not really her fault, she's completely ignorant on what's lewd and what's not.<br><br> Okuma is also a perv, he's just in denial about it. Not a giant one, but still likes dirty stuff. </br></br></br>  <br> reading this in spanish  <br>Oh God, im rock hard right now. Nothing can stop me!</br></br>  I hope we see more of the happy seal  <br>Real women are trash!<br>Sluts that would fuck for money!<br>2D girls are great!<br>They only fuck for money when you intentionally search for it!</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, according to the plot only Japan.<br>Imagine a North Korean actually going overseas for the first time in his/her life, discovering all the wonders of capitalism and democracy, suddenly realizing he/she was living in a propaganda bubble.

But Kajo got better chances.</br>  <br> Comedy, Ecchi, Mature, Romance, School Life, Seinen, Supernatural JsBKC.dpuf </br>  <br>And who's fault was it that made her that way?

It's a trope yes but it doesn't guarantee Kajo winning. There are a lot of other stories where first girl doesn't win.</br></br>  <br>Haganai had first girl lose. Also i think True Tears, Shuffle and a couple others. It´s not always this easy.</br>  <br> Haganai had first girl lose <br>Has it already been confirmed? I know that it was ending and the last volume og the LN would be released soon.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm wondering by what metric is Kajo first girl. They're introduced in the story roughly at the same time.<br><br>Obviously she's the heroine of the show, but that is more main than first</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait is that braid?

Look up what erections are.</br>  I want to be lewd with Kajo. Sexually lewd.  <br>Why would she only need to hammer his off if she had one too? Think about it:<br>Girl with near super human strength is in turbo lust slut mode over MC's dick, and in order to save MC himself (and Kajo most likely) put him in a chasity belt to try and protect him from her. <br><br>To me it just doesn't make sense that she would hammer away at his when she would also have one on. Although she is really strong so maybe she just rips it off?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not dumb. You're dumb for being unable to understand it,</br>  Is Sophia fuckable? or just a bitch?  <br>lesbian and doesn't know it yet</br>  <br><br>seeing her get so excited after watching Anna do all that was pretty cute</br></br>  <br>yes</br>  I'll ask this now.<br>What are the chances of getting a season 2?</br>  <br>That's not funny.</br>  <br>No. Read the LNs.</br>  <br><br>none. it's selling worse than danmachi did last season.</br></br>  Wh..What was that stuff dripping from Anna?  was it rape?  <br>That depends, was there penetration?</br>  <br>Subtle elephants poster is subtle.</br>  <br>Sadly no, thanks to Kajo cock-blocking.</br>  <br><br>Brb building a nuclear bomb.</br></br>  I don't like girls with heart-shaped pupils.

It's alright, you can tell us.</br></br></br>  <br>It's funny cause she probably advocated for all those laws in the first place because everyone looked at her lewdly and she wants to be taken seriously instead of being a fucktoy with funbags.</br>  Guys I finally get it! Anna is seemingly pure but lewd, and kajo is seemingly lewd but pure!  <br>This could either lead into disaster or somehow tone down her desire for a bit.<br><br> She pobably jumps him full force after this right? </br></br></br>  <br>What's the different? They have hearts in their eyes? It's unnatural.</br>  <br>this one is new.</br>  <br>From the thumbnail I thought that was the pink-haired Brynhildr girl.</br>    <br>Not gay, honestly. They look unnatural.

Ohohohoho!" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the difference:<br> used for comedy effect (i.e. a girl swooning over the sight of a hunk or bishonen)<br> used to further reinforce a girl's erotic expression, along with ahegao face/drooling mouths</br></br></br>  <br> Women can not rape men <br><br>1/10</br></br></br>  <br>wait what the shit, Kajo confesses? nice.</br>  <br>Why is MC such a BUSTA!</br>  <br> NTR <br>lmao</br></br>  So does she like pull her skirt up to her armpits when outside of school  <br>Fuck you Kajo</br>  <br>i would buy a hoodie and start drinking vodka so I could wear it as an eternal sign of suffering  alternatively I would man up and leave her only with myself to blame for sticking my dick in crazy </br>   Kajo is the cuck <br><br>DROOOPPPPPEEEDDD<br><br>NTR ruins another great anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know man, hot chick or not, someone giving you a slobbery lick to the face just doesn't feel super great.</br>  <br>I love that the ending changed to have Anna as the pero girl. I thought it was just supposed to be a nondescript silhouette to symbolize Okuma having to be more exposed to lewd things after having to join SOX regardless of his own hesitation, not foreshadowing an actual lewd threat he would have to deal with.</br>  <br>You chose the words that would hurt me the most didn't you?</br>  <br>Rolling up the skirt is a lot more effective. <br><br>Although considering the length, she'd probably look like she has some paunch around her midsection rolling it up that much.</br></br></br>  <br>Would you prefer that the She-Beast from the East, Anna, was the victim of NTR?</br>  <br> she changes </br>  <br>hnnnggggg, fuck i'd be pitching a tent the size of a Giza pyramid, how is the MC so desensitized</br>  <br>Maybe the lower part of the skirt is removable</br>  <br>the part covering her thighs are probably taped on</br>  <br>Seems reasonable enough to me. Being fond of dirty jokes isn't the same thing as always being willing to fuck anything.</br>  ANNA IS A CUNT TSUNAMI NEW ORLEANS FLOODING SLUT  <br>what is even going on here</br>  Have anyone here read the manga? How does the anime compare to the manga? I actually want to read ahead but I'm not sure what chapter episode 4 is on.  <br>While I agree in most cases, it at least makes sense in this show which is set in a world where society as a whole is rigidly enforcing a seriously abnormal approach to sex.<br><br>Of course, Japanese society in reality has a lesser form of this going on, which is ultimately reflected in the whole anime characters being super embarrassed about sex thing.</br></br></br>  <br>It's actually much tamer than the anime so far. Apparently because the anime is basing itself off the LN which is also more lewd.</br>  <br>Oh... thanks. Hopefully we get more lewd anna scenes.</br>  <br>Maybe you should be watching The Wings of Honneamise instead of ecchi comedies.</br>  <br> This is the tase of a liar </br>   /a/ hates sluts <br> /a/ loves Anna </br>  <br>How is she a slut?</br>  <br>I hated anna even when she wasn't a slut.</br>  <br> /a/ hates sluts <br>This has never really actually been the case.</br></br>  <br>Did you even watch the episode?</br>  -<br>I only hate used sluts</br>  <br>Lusting for one cock makes you a slut now?</br>  <br><br>Fear.</br></br>  <br>Not really a slut since she's attacking one person.

She keeps whispering to herself even as "just the tip" had been passed ages ago.<br><br>At what point does he stop struggling, as he quietly stares into the floor with dead eyes. Does he even notice the man leaving without a word?<br><br>Does he notice the silent footsteps of art girl as she looks down at him? What kind of look does she have on her face? Does she say anything? Or does she leave without a word?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not scary<br>the sound track would make it hilarious</br></br>  <br><br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>15453<br><br> No </br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Keep looking.</br>  <br><br>What if the man was Gouriki?</br></br>  POST.<br><br>MORE.<br><br>GREEN HAIR</br></br></br></br>  <br>It wouldn't be rape</br>  <br>lewd</br>  <br>I swear if the MC starts being a beta and tries stop/dodge Anna's advances I'm gonna drop the show. I'm sick of that trope. This is a guy's dream situation.</br>  <br>All I hear is  shonen </br>  <br>I bet you haven't watched the latest episode. Anna is quite sexual even if she hasn't been taught anything about sex.</br>  With this, Prison School, and Shingeki No Soma JC Staff is on fire. Did someone new get hired there recently? <br><br>Either way, I like the irony of Kajo being prude and Anna being crazy sex obsessed. I think that it gives their characters more depth. Also, I appreciate that even though she's really innocent she's still willing to fight for the right thing. <br><br>Also, this is one of the few times I'm not rooting for the childhood friend so thank goodness.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Most likely fear I mean come on that place went full flamethrower on pictures. Police brutality will be the nice part he gets if the police find out.</br>  I like this show, its adapten from a LN? Will the anime cover all of LN? Is it worth ( the LN) picking up ?<br>Is there a way to see this episode without all the censor stickers?</br>  <br>ブルーレイを買います</br>  <br>que</br>  <br>This is one of my favourite anime styled pictures, oh gosh</br>  <br>你一定买蓝光。</br>  You guys are all morons. She likes telling dirty jokes, but she's just as uneducated as everyone else under the new age moral authority. Her rebellion is emotional.  <br>you too</br>  <br>金が足りない</br>  So last season we had nice discussions with Yahari, this season we get retarded-pervert shit with no actual dialogue concept? <br><br>Wow, anime sure is evolving.</br></br>  <br>wait there's a manga of this show</br>  <br> So last season we had nice discussions with Yahari <br>Were you being sarcastic? Or are you just deluded?</br></br>  <br> Anime needs to be mature for mature anime connoisseurs like myself. </br>  So,  how will they go to the toilet with the chastity belts slavmom proposed?   <br> I still hope for a harem ending. <br>Are you retarded?</br></br>  <br>how rude</br>  <br>For a personal hugbox, write reddit.com and press enter.</br>  <br>Nice reply, liked. :)</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Anna's mother has, on at least one occasion  had sexual intercourse for the purpose of procreation. </br>  Just getting around to catching up on my backlog this season. There's uncensored subs for this? The HorribleSubs one's censored as fuck.  <br>I honestly do not find this appealing.</br>  <br>He loved Anna because of her pure morals and uncompromising attitude. This turbo slut is not the woman he fell in love with.</br>  <br>She made different batches for the different members. That's why she specifies that each bag is for each person. Gorilla and Kajou didn't get honey cookies.</br>  <br>Didn't he fall in love with Anna because she didn't look down on him because he was the son of a terrorist as opposed to everybody else?<br><br>After that, he just sought to make the pure Anna as the perfect role model and ideal.</br></br></br>  <br><br> He was asking for it <br>You people make me sick! Just because a man literally asks for it does not make it okay!</br></br></br>  <br>You're wrong. Anna is the child of a rape victim. This whole crusade her mother's going on is her revenge.</br>  <br> uncensored <br>Do you have the rest?</br></br>  <br>First girl won in True Tears, eventually. Best girl won first, but then she lost later due to first girl syndrome.</br>  <br><br>Anna is too pure for this world.</br></br>  <br>Holy shit my sides</br>  <br>When will someone upload the other five volumes to the internet?</br>  <br>1. Why are they bathing together.<br>2. WHY IS SHE WEARING A FUCKING TOWEL IN THE WATER</br></br>  Just started Index a few days ago and I'm at episode 17. Does the series get any better because so far the entire thing has felt like a huge filler arc. Is Railgun worth watching if Index isn't doing it for me? <br><br>Also Index is such a fucking headache</br></br>  Index doesn't get good until the second half of episode 23 in season 2.  <br>  I must lie to make this thread <br>  I must bait! <br> Ironic shitposting is still shitposting Op</br></br></br>  <br>Index is shit and so is Railgun</br>  <br>I'm being 100% serious, no bait I swear. Can post history for proof if you want it because I stream like a cuck.<br><br><br>Is Railgun any better?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only the second season of railgun is good from episode 1-16.<br><br>You could pretty much skip the first season of it if you want.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, Railgun is good.<br>S1 from episode 1 to 12 and S2 from 1 to 16.</br></br>  <br>Railgun Manga is good, Index LN is good if you're into LNs. Index manga has good art but is also useless, Accelerator manga is fun as long as you don't take it seriously.<br><br>The anime is pretty much uniformly awful except for what  said. Though that has some Cloverfield in it which is pretty disappointing.</br></br></br>  Index is boring as shit tbh. Almost all of Railgun is fun though.  <br><br>Thanks a ton. Is index II worth watching as well or should I just forego the rest of it?</br></br>  <br> Can post history for proof if you want it because I stream like a cuck. <br><br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>The first half of S1 is certainly better than the second half, but I found it disappointing how much Nagai toned down how crazy Misaka is, and stuffed as much Saten in as possible.</br>  <br>I don't know, I loved Index so I honestly don't know what to tell you. It has one of my favorite arcs of the series, and the most stupid too.</br>  <br>Just watch YouTube montages of Touma, Accelerator, and Misaka wrecking shit, and you'll have gotten through the best parts of Index without the accompanying bullshit.</br>  <br>First half of Index S2 is pretty bad. Second half is alright. Not really their fault, since the first half covers what are easily the worst volumes of the LN series.</br>  <br>Maybe it's because I saw Railgun before I knew anything about Raildex at all, but Saten didn't bother me. My main complaints are the terrible enemies like Telestina and DARKNESS.<br>After reading the manga, I still don't see extra Saten as something terrible. Unless you hate her.</br></br>  <br> Can post history for proof if you want it because I stream like a cuck. <br>They better be 720p at least</br></br>  <br> Thanks a ton. Is index II worth watching as well or should I just forego the rest of it? <br><br>Yes for best boy Amata.</br></br></br>  <br>What was your favorite/least favorite? Of the three I've seen, Twins was my favorite and this beach/Angel Fall one is my least. When it started off, I thought it was the customary beach episode that comes with some shows, but when it actually became an arc I was disappointed to say the least.</br>  <br>Mostly it's because he stuffed in Saten where there used to be better stuff.<br><br>For example, Mikoto railgunning the thugs not because they spilled some ice cream on her shirt, but because they slapped Saten. It completely changes the tone of the scene and gives you a completely different notion of Misaka's character. It's supposed to show you how crazy and out of touch she is, but instead she just seems like a normal if angry girl.</br></br></br>  <br>Angel Fall took me offguard, but it was hilarious.<br>My most memorable arc was Daihasei Festival Arc, least favorite was that terribly done Italy trip with boats and the Pope.</br></br>  <br>I haven't gotten to either of those yet, I should be able to finish season 1 tonight so if the thread isn't dead I'll let you know how they went.</br>  <br>Festival Arc and Boats are both Season 2.<br><br>Also yeah, Boats was awful. The boss fight was okay, the rest was complete shit.</br></br></br>  <br>That's actually what got me to watch the series, I watched the clip of Accelerator smashing some girl into a skyscraper and decided to try it out.</br>  Railgun has more Misaka, more Saten, more SoL, better handled drama, better comedy, no HAHACHRISTIANMAGIC!!, and less self-righteous monologues.<br><br>Overall better.</br></br>  <br>Thank God, the magic shit has been by far the worst part. Maybe it's just me, but I feel like if the show only focused on the ESPer's and Academy City, it'd be way better. Instead it feels like they introduced this cool scientific city, only for it to be that backdrop for a pretty run of the mill magic story. The setting just feels very underdeveloped, to the point where if the show's events took place in modern day Japan, it wouldn't be very different at all.</br>  OT Volume 15-22 &gt; Railgun Manga &gt; New Testament &gt; Railgun S2 1-16 &gt; OT Volume 1-14 (some of this is shit) &gt; Everything else is shit.<br><br>Index Manga has really pretty art though.</br></br>  <br>I mean, you're pretty much right. Kamachi made the Magic Side first, and then created the Science Side to have something to contrast it with (he said it in some old interview).<br><br>The Science Side starts getting alot more going on with it, well, pretty much literally right after Index S2 stops (AC starts invading other countries and being complete and total assholes, and never stops, it's grand).</br></br></br>  <br> if the show only focused on the ESPer's and Academy City, it'd be way better <br>I felt the same way. Railgun has no magic at all, only espers and science.<br><br>Sadly it has no Last Order and very little Accelerator or Sisters.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But it has less YOU AREN'T LIVING YOUR LIFE CORRECTLY.<br>Railgun was definitely more enjoyable though. The redone accelerator arc was easily 10/10.</br></br>  <br> Just started Index <br><br>if you are not under 16 it wont be your thing. most anons that love it saw it when they where underage bait. myself included, so i like it.<br><br> Does the series get any better <br>if you don't like it so far, then no. at least not in the anime<br><br> Is Railgun worth watching if Index isn't doing it for me?  <br>maybe, it has a different feel. it depends. i would try.<br><br> Index is such a fucking headache <br>and thats why the story stops carrying about her   thank fucking god for that too </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>AC being Academy City I assume? That sounds a lot cooler, is that Railgun S2 or the LNs?<br><br><br>Is Accelerator/Sisters only an index thing? I thought I read somewhere about Accelerator being an MC and dealing with the sisters and all that.<br><br><br>I like to feel the pixels in my anime, Anon. 240 or die.<br><br><br>Never actually tried an LN before. I read excerpts from Yahari while it was airing but that's about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That sounds a lot cooler, is that Railgun S2 or the LNs? <br>It's LNs. The Railgun Manga is all constrained to AC. There are some Railgun side stories in the LN that leave and go to America and Russia though.<br><br> Is Accelerator/Sisters only an index thing? I thought I read somewhere about Accelerator being an MC and dealing with the sisters and all that. <br><br>The Sister's Arc is the most adapted arc of the series. It first appeared in the LN, then the Index Anime, then the Index Manga, then the Railgun Manga, and then the Railgun Anime.<br><br>The consequences of the arc though continue through the LN, the Railgun manga, and the new Accelerator manga. Probably at least 50% of the plot points of the series originate in that arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for the insight Anon, I get ya on the "love it when they saw it/underage" thing, there's a few shows like that for me as well.</br>  <br>NT is mostly shit though.</br>  <br>Mmk sounds good, I'll get started on the LNs after the anime. When would you recommend reading the Accelerator/ any of the manga, if at all?</br>  <br>The Index manga has literally no point and skips art. It's not bad, it just does nothing new. You can still read it if you want. Pretty pictures.<br><br>The Accelerator Manga is new content, though it's also all extremely edgy Accelerator that occurs extremely early in the series. Fans tend to react badly to it since Accelerator becomes significantly less of a douche as the series goes on, so suddenly going back to Super Edgy Accelerator is sorta jarring. Also it's got hilariously bad blackface.<br><br>Railgun Manga you can pretty much read whenever. Probably want to do it before you read much of the LNs. You want to read this one since it's the only important one, and also the only one that's any real good.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*skips arcs</br>  <br>How bad of blackface are we talking?</br>    <br>Fantastic, I can't wait</br>  <br>yeah, no problem. <br>Index is a very hit or miss thing, and that window certainly gets smaller for hit the older you are. <br><br>curious as to what your "love it when they saw it underage" is</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm fairly young at 19 so the accelerator/touma fight and all that was still cool as hell. And Naruto was the first show I ever watched when it was on Toonami, and I kept up with it ever since for nostalgia's sake. I'm very aware it's not great but I can't hate it for the life of me. Make fun of it yeah, but not hate it. Other than that, Eureka 7 was the first show that I consciously watched as an "anime" and not a cartoon on cable, so that'll always be up there for me. I think I was like 14 or so when I watched that so Renton wasn't as unbearable at the beginning to me. Fuck the kids though.</br>  <br> and less self-righteous monologues <br><br>All of those are Touma bullshitting the enemy, he doesn't believe in any of it</br></br></br>  <br>i remember when i saw that page i'm almost dropped the manga because i know it's going to get more edgy and see even more edgy Accelerator</br>  <br>If you think Index is "filler" then you should probably stay as far away from Railgun as possible.</br>  <br> Amata <br> Best Boy  <br><br>Top fucking kek</br></br></br></br>  <br> more Misaka, more Saten, more SoL <br>Finally someone understands.</br></br>  <br>It just gives the filler feeling. Like when you used to turn on the TV at 8 o'clock and instead of seeing the fight from last week continuing, you see the protag on the beach or some shit. Imagine that feeling every minute of most episodes. <br>I guess it could be said better as "nothing that has happened so far has had any lasting consequence on the series." Touma loses his memory? Cool, it doesn't matter, he's literally the exact same. Index has memorized 103,000 spells and can cast them now? Cool, let's make her a gag that shows up randomly and does nothing. That's the two glaring ones right now, and I could just be picky because I haven't finished the series/don't fully understand it yet, but that's my feelings as of this point in time.</br></br>   Watching Index instead of reading <br>Only good thing was accelerator. Railgun is even worse if you couldn't go through Index.</br>  <br> Touma loses his memory? Cool, it doesn't matter, he's literally the exact same <br>He's actually considerably different, pay better attention. Although, that is something that shows more later on<br><br> Index has memorized 103,000 spells and can cast them now? <br> can cast them now? <br>She could never cast them, she is a walking library. John Pen saps her of the ability to cast</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon, Accelerator is my favorite and the main reason I've stuck with the franchise so long, but let's not pretend he's the only great thing there. <br><br>Actually, I have to kind of take this back because Accelerator is the only good thing that hasn't been fucked over for Touma and his status quo...yet</br></br></br>  <br>I thought the big thing that happened in the first arc was that she could indeed cast the spells, but the seal from the church didn't allow her to in conjunction with the 1-year lifespan thing. When Touma broke that, I figured it would break her restriction on casting as well. <br><br>And as of this point in the show (right after beach arc,) he's not much different. The only difference is he just doesn't have his memory. I expected something a little more extreme, a la Golden Time (minus the ghost.) But like you said, I'm probably not far enough in to see the full effects of the memory loss.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean in the show, there's a lot of possibly good stuff that was either left out or was better in the novels. I say this as someone who watched the show first before going through all the novels up to NT10 (I don't have time lately to read the rest, but hopefully soon).</br>  <br>Anon, you got to pay better attention, Kamachi loves to foreshadow a lot, and bring back incredibly small details into massive plot points<br><br>The seal is a 4, why would you think it's the only one?<br><br> And as of this point in the show (right after beach arc,) he's not much different <br>For starters, pre-memory loss Touma could actually talk to girls</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh yes, if you're just talking about the anime then yes without a doubt Accelerator is the best part of it and the BEST things he does aren't even animated. Not even Index III would animate Best Accelerator</br>  <br>I thought he got the other three when he was touching her all over, but you're right, I didn't give it much thought at all. So I was wrong there, excited to see how it plays out!<br><br>And you're right again, he was much more flirty/upfront pre-memory loss. Not saying he's a cuck now, but his interactions with girls seems.... inconsequential now?</br></br></br>  <br>Don't bother getting into shipping with this series even though it teases ships everywhere. No girl will win Touma</br>  <br>This is probably one of the only series I've watched where I don't care for any of the girls. Not that they're all shit tier but none pique my interest. I just wanna watch Touma punch people without talking/ hear Accelerator laugh :'(</br>  <br>Nagai please</br>  <br>Good. You're in for a fun ride. I hope you don't like any of the girls as characters and want to see them do things because most of them are just there to tease a romantic ship with Touma and fail. Or be shitty villains. Or both.</br>  <br>Pre-memory loss Touma really just didn't give a fuck, NT11 shows a lot of him<br><br><br> Not that they're all shit tier but none pique my interest. <br> implying this series doesnt have some of the best girls <br><br> without talking/ hear Accelerator laugh :'( <br> implying Accels laugh isnt one of the greatest things ever </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As long as Index slowly fades out, I'll be happy. Everyone else is fine. Thanks again Anon, ya been mighty helpful on this Sunday eve</br>  <br>Index both fades out and sticks around at the same time. She's there, but the things she does aren't worth mentioning. But there is the possibility she'll become relevant again, but there's plenty of reason to doubt that, too</br>  <br>Nah Anon, you misunderstand. I only want to see Touma punch people while not talking/ I only want to hear Accelerator laugh. And as of now, Misaka hasn't really gotten any development, and the only other females are Index, vampire blood girl, and the lady who works for the church (I'm blanking on names and googling is too much at this point.) Maybe once the ensemble gets more development I'll like them more, but as of now they just sort of exist.</br>  <br>Misaka doesn't get any development and the latest novel pretty much confirms she never will</br>  <br> but the seal from the church didn't allow her to in conjunction with the 1-year lifespan thing. <br><br>Nah, Index can't cast magic at all because she has no mana. The seal that the church put on her is a precautionary measure to purposefully get her sick to make wiping her memories a necessity. She does a few "magic" things later on in the series but those aren't considered magic since they don't require mana.</br></br></br>  <br>I should correct myself, she can't use magic outside of John's Pen's Mode. This beckons the question if she could actually perform magic before all the memory wiping began.</br>    reminder that Touma hugged Othinus  <br> leaving out the arc with best girl <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>Reminder no one cares except shipperfags and waifufags</br>  <br>Drop it if you like small girls, for the love of god.</br>      <br>Not OP, but I like small girls.<br><br>Why? Do bad things happen to the small girls in Index?</br></br></br>    <br>Yes. Very.</br>    What would have happened if this military otaku right here is one of the EVA pilots?  Mari.<br>After EoE he decided to come back as a cute girl</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>No</br>  <br>Just fucking stop.<br><br>Not even the same.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br/>  Instead of cumming on a comatose girl, he'd rape her.  <br>Kindly fuck off, neither happened.</br>  Kensuke is the most resourceful kid and he plays guerilla fighting for fun.<br><br>I genuinely think he can contribute more than Asuka.</br></br>  <br>Then again, even Hikari can contribute more than Asuka due to her being more stable.</br>  <br>no need to imagine,they actually making him an EVA pilot in alternate version on manga/LN/videogames</br>  <br>it makes sense</br>  <br>it would be cute</br>  <br> LARPing outdoors =/ piloting Eva <br><br><br>That's why Shinji is deliberately made unstable right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's for instrumentality. He has to be mind broken for it to work.</br>  <br>He might have been a military otaku and thus more gung-ho to fight, but that doesn't mean he had any actual fighting skills or good sync rate.</br>  3.0+1.0 when?
