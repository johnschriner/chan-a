[ What happened to Mo-tan to become so tiny? Did she only manage to reincarnate partially?<br><br>Is she not part of the zodiac anymore then?</br></br>  <br>Why the fuck would she be traveling around the world with Nya-tan in the first place, doesn't she have the whole Tokai region to protect?<br><br> inb4 it turns out there WAS somebody that missed Rat's radar and won all the Eto-seals in the last moment to become an Eto-shin. <br><br> Hooray Paca-tan </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Her soul got ripped out and shattered. Give her SOME time to heal<br><br><br><br>she's on sick leave <br><br>what I want to know is Pretty Mode tiny in general or is Mo-tan just like that because of the aforementioned soul ripping</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Rabbit? More like RabBest.  <br>Well there's the manga.  Which deviates so much from the anime that it is practically a different story just with characters that look the same <br><br><br>You're early today</br></br></br></br>  I, for one, welcome our new CG overlord.  <br><br>well that is smaller but hardly pocket sized</br></br>  <br>Nya-tan is travelling the world to find a cure to restore mo-tan's body.<br><br>Mo-tan is too weak to protect a region and just tags along with Nya-tan.<br><br> season 2 never indeed </br></br></br></br></br>  Boar is best  Reminder that Meitan was confirmed best girl last thread.   <br>Mission accomplished</br>  <br><br>I feel sad for you Sheepfags since she gets BTFO in manga</br></br>  So, uh, did they explain what the deal is with Takeru? Did I miss something?  <br>What was wrong with him?</br>  <br>He was just a small town boy</br>  <br>I'm still wondering how he's able to barf out Sol/Lull like it's no big deal.</br>  <br><br>does anyone else feel like the ending was a tease for second season/OVA where they will have 3D segments with more realistic body proportions just like in OPs pick?<br><br>it felt like that to me.<br><br> muh sales! <br><br>there are plenty of low-sales shows that get second seasons or OVAs</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>List a few  because I would like to believe </br>  <br> there are plenty of low-sales shows that get second seasons or OVAs <br>Because they are for promoting the source material. If the publishers think an anime increased the sales of manga, VNs, or merchandise, even if the anime itself sold badly, they will consider it a success.<br><br>Etotama was just a commercial disaster.</br></br></br></br>  Now my ears can rest in peace and heal from Nya's voice.  <br> Etotama was just a commercial disaster. <br>Exactly. And it makes me fucking happy.</br></br>  <br>You could marinate a whole cow with such saltiness  not that it would be difficult now that Mo-tan has become chibi </br>  <br>Living in a lonely world?</br>  <br>Why chuu-tan looks so HIGH.</br>  <br>Because Murakawa subconsciously hates Rat  or her VA  deep inside</br>  <br><br>Not anymore, he has a floor boar, a monkey and a dog on his roof, a horse and a sheep taking care of his home, a tiger and a dragon keeping him company, a rooster waking him up in the morning, a snake cooking for him, a cat with a cow, and a rabbit occassionally visiting him, and now he also acquired a sexy loveable rat who hangs around him to relax.<br>Must be awesome having such great Soul/Lull.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Shitty drawings being showcased in anime is my biggest hnnnngggggghhhh</br></br>  Well that was cute.  <br>What does her VA have to do with it?</br>  damn, that was a totally worthless final for a worthless series  <br>That was a joke.  A retarded one at that, sorry </br>    <br>Matsui Eriko and Ozawa Ari are talented as fuck.</br>  <br> Mo-tan <br>That VA can art, dang.</br></br>  <br><br>I like Chu-tan's and Shaa-tan's, and nya-tan's<br><br>like they know they can't draw for shit so they don't care</br></br></br></br>  <br>Usa-tan&gt;Mo-tan&gt;Uma-tan&gt;Inu-tan&gt;rest<wbr><br><br>Usa-tan has the most character, Mo-tan is more polished but the drawing itself ain't as good</br></br></wbr></br>  Favorite Pretty Mode designs?<br><br>My top 3 is boar, snake, and tiger.</br></br>    <br>nope, Mo-tan drawing best and then Shima-tan<br><br><br>Piyo-tan has best pretty mode</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Piyotan, Uritan, Shaatan.</br></br>  <br> footfag bait <br> best anything </br></br>    Well, finally finished whatever autistic thing I've been doing for several days.<br><br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!L1FUkAyR!sz2d<wbr>uWsfLq1-1LtM558L8w<br><br>Feel free to step up and translate.<br><br>No, fuck it, SOMEBODY PLEASE TRANSLATE</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  te plot was too similar to first neptunia game  Who the hell is drawing all these 2D Pretty Modes and how is he making them so fucking cute  Can we all agree now that Etotama is AOTS? If not, it's probably the most surprising anime this season. <br><br>The 3D animation done fucking right.</br></br>  GOAT 3dcg.

Like The Rolling Girls last season.</br>  <br>They were always cute, anon.</br>  <br>Where is her nose?</br>  <br>Watch Short 4 and tell me if you still think Mei-tan is best</br>  <br>The rat took it.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127207004 <br>Fuck, I need some sleep. <br><br>Did they complete the music video with the Etotamas singing in pretty mode yet?</br></br></br>  <br>Don't you want to hear desu desu sing anymore?</br>  <br>Comes with BD Vol 6, which comes out late July.</br>  <br><br>No subs so far.</br></br>  <br>Had to reword post to make sure I didn't fuck it up a third time desu desu.<br><br><br>Thanks, I'll be looking forward to it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's kind of obvious what they say.  Mei-tan's devotion for Takeru goes a little too far and spooks the shit out of the Takeru-house residents </br>   that second left, top-most <br> ;_; </br>  <br>I just realized after posting, that was made by Nya-tan's VA.<br>She must have had fun voicing her</br></br>  <br>Where's this located?</br>  <br><br><br>Remember that Sol/Lull is basically concentrated niceness. Positive human emotions.<br><br>Takeru, being modern anime harem lead, is constructed at the subatomic level of nothing but 'nice guy' particles. He's a Superhadron Collider of Niceness energy./</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Harem <br>The only one that truly shows an interest in Takeru's reproductive organs is the Sheep and he tries to kick her out of his house in the manga</br></br>  <br><br>Every time I watch anime like this I always see the VAs having loads of fun to the point of crying when the show was over.<br><br>It's really sad, but heartwarming to know they had just as much fun voicing the anime as I did watching it.<br><br>for GJ-bu, Megumi's VA cried on her radio show because the anime was done ;_;</br></br></br></br></br></br>   CG dance music video with all the characters in the last BD <br> Piyotan doesn't stop and go "wuhh" after three steps <br>IMMERSION RUINED<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5UK<wbr>fMF9vYjI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  Hey, I just found the short episodes other than the 1st one.<br><br>http://www.youtube.com/playlist?lis<wbr>t=PLD5tew_NN2lHZ6GmqINYWunRaCOlXDAf<wbr>p</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br><br> when VA's really had fun being part of an anime because it was probably their first time receiving such a significant role that isn't background character voices and they don't want their happiness to end. <br><br> When VAs want a S2 because then they'll be off searching for another anime to voice for and it'll be god knows how long until they land another spot like that. <br><br>For all intensive purposes, I guess it's a doggy dog world out there</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Cock spends most of her day sleeping in a fucking tree <br><br>You'll never look up and find a cock sleeping in a tree ;_;</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> episode 4 <br> 00:25 </br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Sheep is a closet yandere </br></br></br>  <br> then you realize Mei-tan have Takeru's house key without him even knowing <br>She's gonna rape him one of these days.</br></br>  <br><br>Mei-tan you're scaring me.</br></br>  <br>There's more than one kind of harem. A bevy of beautiful girls all living in around and with a single hapless guy. Even if most arent romantically interested, they interact with him in friendly ways, so to me it is still what I consider a Harem... I usually think of it as a viewer harem show.. or like a supporting cast harem?</br>  <br>Holy shit. <br><br>Mei-tan pls go and stay go</br></br></br>  <br>Mei-tan is lovely. How do I get a yandere sheep to obsess over me?</br>  <br><br>Mei-tan confirmed for sleeper best girl<br><br>Why the writers made a fucking episode about Takeru's cold and not this is beyond me.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Sheep is scary.</br></br>  <br>Because they needed to provide a reason why an Eto-shin fell in love with a mortal, unless you want a slutty Sheep who falls in love at first sight with someone just because he looks good.<br><br>Also &gt;pic related</br></br></br>  <br><br> Mei-Tan <br> A healing specialist who delivers every possible therapeutic treatment. <br><br>I didn't realize death was a part of the treatment</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That ass.</br>  <br>this took longer than it normally does<br>are you tired or something</br></br>  <br>Death cures everything.</br>  <br>You fuckers told me I was retarded for even suggesting that she could be a closet yandere.<br><br>Fuck every last one of you.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Laid-back, easy-going, and soothing personality. <br><br>I'll never trust again</br></br></br></br>  I couldn't handle the lack of anime so I started watching the niconico talk show.<br><br>Jesus Christ, does Nya-tan's VA have sugar water flowing through her veins?</br></br>  <br>Who stole Uma-tan's nose?</br>   Finish show <br> Take nap <br> OP stuck in my head <br>It can't be helped.<br><br>This OP (and show in general) really grew on me.

I'm pretty sure that was stuck in my head as I was trying to get to sleep.<br><br>They're both great though. Fucking earworms  S2 never ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>Wait, each VA sung the entire ED for an episode? I distinctly heard different voices as the camera panned across the cute sleeping divine messengers.</br>  <br>Got a link?</br>  <br> Are there full versions? </br>    man rat is kind of gay for cat<br>whats up with that</br>  <br>Thank you /a/, you glorious wizard.<br><br>That makes me wonder, are there more screenshots of that discussion/thread?</br></br></br>  <br>Search on YT for 干支ーク</br>  Where is muh blue moment cgi dance?    <br>I feel like that line of thinking always ends up with idiots running in circles while screaming "haremshit" or "fujoshit" at the top of their lungs every time there is an unbalanced cast of characters.</br>  <br>What discussion? That was just one post in a normal thread.<br><br>But there's this right underneath that post.</br></br></br>  It's a shame this did so poorly.<br>I guess the idea was that with a cast of 13 waifus the show couldn't possibly do poorly, but it did anyway.</br>  <br>Stop making everything sadder, the BD sales alone is bad enough.<br><br>I wonder why they're so afraid of Mei-tan just because she have the key. It's not like she couldn't just climb the wall and enter through the backyard's door.</br></br></br>  <br>Or you know that hole in his house that connects the two realms together.</br>  Is that the character designer who did Monogatari?<br><br>And why does the 3D look so amazing?</br></br>  <br> Stop making everything sadder <br>Think about all the effort put into making the CG models, and animating them.<br><br>Now think about how all these data are going to be stashed into some storage, never to be used again, and eventually deleted.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or that. Seriously, Takeru's house is not that hard to break into.<br><br>Well fuck you too. I just got over this thinking that they're a big company with plenty of successful business before, don't bring me down again.</br></br></br>    Monkey and Dog are best boys.  <br>This.</br>  <br>Easily.

You unlock every Eto-shin to play as in new game plus runs, and no two Eto-shins have the same playing style.

With a performance that she didn't earn.<br>Really, Cyan never did anything like Nya-tan to deserve a moment like that.<br>With how it turned out, I'd even liked it more if they just did furry CG concerts every episode.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But hello kitty idol show</br>  <br>Only the pygmy ones.<br>Big boars fuck shit up in rural areas regularly.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but little ones are so cute and cuddly.</br>  <br>Too bad they're not pets because they're critically endangered.</br>  <br>Critically endangered?

So far I'm not really that impressed, though. In the second episode there was already a plot hole/false explanation of rules. But I'll give it some time, maybe these are just some starting problems. <br><br><br><br>Does a chombo round get repeated like when the dealer wins or it's a draw with dealer tenpai? Because if it isnt couldn't you use a deliberate chombo to win the game in the last round if you're more than 10 or 12k ahead and will still have 30k+ afterwards?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Best 2 advance, so the number of players is halved from this round onward: from 16 to 8 (next round) to the final 4.<br><br><br>Ritz chapter / short series will start in August.</br></br></br></br>  <br> In the second episode there was already a plot hole/false explanation of rules. <br>Which one?</br></br>  <br> In the second episode there was already a plot hole/false explanation of rules. <br><br>Like what? Absurd fluctuations in probability and magic I ain't gotta explain shit moments aside, the anime is pretty accurate to the rules of the game.<br><br>Do note that they do insert some house rules some times.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Saki wanted to end a game with +/-0 so she ignored a possible ron on a 5pin, because the player who played it was currently in the lead and she would overtake her. Then directly on the next turn a red 5pin was discarded. It was explained (by the club president) that Saki ignored the tile as well, because with the additional red 5 her hand would become to big to finish with +/-0. Howver since she ignored the 5pin in the turn before she was furiten for it anyway and couldn't call it even if she wanted. So the president didn't seem to know that rule which is hardly believable as this is absolute basic defensive strategy.</br>  <br>see</br>  <br>Nodoka dealt the red 5 after Saki's turn, so Saki wasn't in furiten.</br>  <br>Wow I don't remember CG being used for anything but the mahjong table mechanics.</br>  <br><br>If the player ignores a hand completing tile discard from an opponent, they are in temporary furiten until their next draw.<br><br>That said, you can see in  that Nodoka is after Saki. Riichi Mahjong follows a Counter-Clockwise flow. By the time that Nodoka drops the Aka 5p, Saki is no longer in furiten as she would've drawn another tile by then.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also, that was all in the first episode, not the second episode.</br>  As everyone else said, Saki was in tenpai on 6th discard. Yuuki's 5pin was her 7th discard, and Nodoka's 5pin was her 8th discard. They skip some rounds for pacing reasons and you can just assume everyone knows the rules (except Kaori).  <br>Shit I can't count. 6/7/8 should be 7/8/9, but you get the point</br>  <br>Interesting but is this really the time Ritz? It better be Saki related at least and it seems a little early for Teruhayu.</br>  <br> If the player ignores a hand completing tile discard from an opponent, they are in temporary furiten until their next draw. <br>Yeah, I know. But I'm pretty sure the tiles were consecutive discards without Sakis turn inbetween, Nodoka discarded the 5pin and then that genki girl (can't remember her name) discarded the red 5. I will rewatch it later when I'm home, though and see if I missed something.</br></br>  <br>See<br><br><br>That's the table of the game. Remember, Riichi is counter-clockwise. Hell, here is a page from the manga depicting the seat order.<br><br>  Nodoka discarded the 5pin and then that genki girl (can't remember her name) discarded the red 5. <br><br>Well, theres your fucking problem. You're remembering things wrong. Yuuki dropped a regular 5p and Nodoka dropped the red 5p.<br><br>Yuuki (genki girl) first discarded the regular 5p which Saki ignored. Then came Mako (green hair) and Saki's turns. By the time Nodoka dropped the red 5p, Saki has drawn from the wall and ended her temporary furiten.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>These kids play better than Seiko.</br></br>  <br>Not that guy, but I think he's talking about that totally-real-biography by that Koizumi guy.</br>  <br>Maybe they'll annouce an spin off with Akagi?</br>  <br>she will try to find her father in Shimane prefecture this time. <br><br>RitzHayu</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder what the story is between those two.

Megan's and Arata's powers were fully explored, while Seiko's weren't, so she should have an edge over them. As for Nodoka, she is middle school champion, period.

She made someone mad with her dorian juice.<br><br>Last page, next chapter in a month.</br></br></br>  A new challenger appears.  <br>This is fake, right?</br>  <br>Nah, it's real.<br><br>https://twitter.com/twi_yon/status/<wbr>614387704659185664/photo/1</wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Can Shiki ron servants?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did they miss April Fools by 3 months?</br>  <br><br>Ayy.<br><br>Best caster is the only good player then? And maybe Kirei.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can't just shove mahjong into everything.</br>  <br>Fucking why? That has to be the most shameless cash grab Type-moon has done yet.<br>I can sort of see mundane series like Haruhi getting shitty mahjong games because it's plausible the characters could get together to play mahjong for fun, but Servants?<br>Gilgamesh? Fucking Berserker? Fuck off!</br></br></br>  <br>They might be inspired from those set of image you just posted. <br><br>Damn, wish we'll get a spinoff of Saki in fantasy setting instead.</br></br></br>  <br>Why not animate Biyori for more cute girls doing cute things?</br>  <br>What is Yuuki's Universal Tacos Plan? She's an amazing character. Can't wait for her match against Teru, Kuro, and  Suzu .</br>  <br>No but these two might</br>  <br>Only if the spinoff is also nopan.</br>  <br>Yuuki's boring. <br><br><br>I lose the artist pixiv account. Mind sharing it?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Isn't it illegal to carry swords out in the open like that in japan?</br></br>  <br><br>Is there a problem here, officer?</br></br>  <br><br>Yes, there is you criminal! You're under arrest! Put down the weapon, step back, turn around and lie down!</br></br>  <br>I'm sure it's illegal everywhere.</br>  Are you sure you want to do that?  Lead me not into darkness.  <br><br>Darkness is just the absense of light. Use your other senses, grasshopper.</br></br>  <br>So nelly can use rinshan kaihou and presumably other stuff, and Sawaya has three seperate powers one of which is working towards tsuuiisou.<br>Please don't tell me Nelly is completed maho.</br></br>  <br>She just got lucky.</br>  Does tenhou delete inactive accounts?  <br> Sawaya <br>Five clouds from one goddess and several other lesser gods, but two clouds were used already and they didn't return yet (perhaps for the final match, if Usuzan passes the turn). <br><br> Nelly <br>I don't know, perhaps it's because of Sawaya messing with the red cloud that Kyouko and Nelly got kans. But this doesn't explain Nelly's line before claiming the win, so perhaps she can sense the winning tiles?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I just read the eariler thread, the tanoshii was dead for so long I stopped checking every day.<br>Sawaya messing with the spirit was why Kyouko got kans, but Nelly seemed to get the kan by herself (Sawaya at no point needed 9p).<br>Could Nelly be stealing wins from other players? She did the rinshan exactly like Saki's, pose and even the vertical tile finish.<br>And Sawaya's power is weird. 5 clouds, one of them has to do with honors tiles, so I'd guess three others have to do with the other three suits and maybe the last one does terminals / dora?<br>At any rate this is a pretty hype captain's match, although it does reinforce my thought that Sawaya can't go to finals (because she has a counted power with limited uses).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sawaya has three seperate powers <br>Three powers based on Ainu creation mythos.<br>Plus<br>Power from Ainu deities.<br>Plus<br>I bet Sawaya also has Christian power too.<br><br>OP as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Nice digits.  <br>Nobody seems to really note gets anymore. Truly a new era.<br>Last week or so I found a quints post saying [tits] and literally not a single response after hours.</br></br>  I was rewatching Awai's match, and I realized that her power seems to be sort of shitty.<br>First off she never starts a hand with anything more than W-riichi potential and (judging from discards) can't actually make any more yaku without calling even if she knew all her draws in advance.<br>Secondly, her hand has a literal TIME FOR COMPLETION timer ticking and everyone who knows the wall corner trigger can see it.<br>Thirdly, her power isn't like Koromo's where you can get to iishanten but no closer, it just starts you off with a shit 6-shanten hand, meaning by the time you hit row 2 you'd probably be somewhere around 2-3 shanten and might even be in tenpai.<br>Now of course this isn't really relevant against powerless players, but 'monsters' probably get ridiculously good draws. I can't really see Teru or Saki, or even people like Nodo or Yuuki, being held down by 6-shanten long enough to get haneman'd.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's what happens when you introduce the final boss early on.<br>If Achiga happened sometime after all the Rinkai players and their powers were revealed, you can bet that they'll have more useful and interesting powers.</br></br>  <br>Is shiisan puuta a thing in the Interhigh?<br>That could be an interesting one-off shakeup of a player using Awai's powers against her.</br></br>  I remember playing the PSP and every character having a broken h4x ability.<br><br>Is this still the case in Saki games?</br></br>  <br>No, that doesn't exist officially in nip rules.</br>  <br>What a wonderful age.</br>  <br>Nah I don't think so<br>Speaking of extant yaku, I will be extremely disappointed if Hao doesn't eat a chombo for a yakuless hand in sergaent round.<br>Chink has a bunch of yaku that just don't exist in nip and you can get something equivalent to a baiman in chink with a yakuless hand in nip. Of course, not even counting stuff like Chisei Puta (not daichisei, that's different)<br>Might Awai get Daichisei? I mean it'd be inconsistent with her current power but it does fit with her whole supernova gambit.<br><br>In Achiga the powers are less overpowered (as in they don't work quite as well) but they're still overpowered and don't play like normal.<br>Terutime is actually one of the hardest powers to use imo because you have to actually win once first and the mirror doesn't show up in-game to tell you what to discard and shit.<br>Meanwhile Kuro absolutely slaughters (especially with akadora off, spam kan and riichi for 20+ dora hands).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's more of a rule in spanish mahjong<br><br>HUEHUEHUEHUEHUE</br></br></br></br>   Invalid connection(2) <br>Just ron my shit up</br>  <br>tenhou fucking you?</br>  <br>Yeah, kinda. I'll try pirating VIP client for Windows, if it still works</br>  <br>Yes, it still works, I use it without problems.</br>  <br>Somehow it didn't work on Win 8.1</br>  <br>Well, I use Windows 7.</br>  You will never Gentoo with Tomoki.  <br> watching Saki for the mahjong <br>Weirdo</br></br>  <br>this should be East 3, or am I wrong?</br>  <br>Pretty sure it does after six months of inactivity<br><br><br>It'll be interesting to see how that could get improved upon for the finals. If she could get a speed boost to counter the second point, she could also potentially render the third point moot and fuck things up when others being in 6-shanten is all she needs to complete a hand.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It'd be easy imo to improve her. I honestly think she'd do better without the W-riichi uradora power, she starts with a tenpai / near-tenpai hand and everyone else has 6-shanten. She needs to be able to build other yaku.</br>  Has anyone posted a translation of the latest Shinohayu chapter yet?

Because that would suck.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br><br>It's always the cute ones who are cruelest.</br></br>  How many chapters till we see the Goldfish again?<br><br>Taking all bets.</br></br>  <br>Haven't you heard? Biyori is getting animated.<br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2014-09-24/saki-4-panel-spinoff-s<wbr>aki-biyori-gets-anime-dvd/.79139<br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-05-01/saki-biyori-anime-dvd-<wbr>promo-confirms-returning-staff/.877<wbr>16</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Who is the fucker and why is she so fucking important, destroying a sibling's relationship on her wake?</br>  <br>Is Teru buying something from a vending machine?</br>  <br><br>She's Saki's twin sibling/cousin/familyfriend/neighbo<wbr>r/real father/something else.</wbr></br></br>  Is durian juice that bad?  <br><br>What? Durians are those extremely bad smelling fruits, right?</br></br>  <br><br>They taste pretty gud once you get used to the smell.</br></br>  <br>I have a bad feeling that Shino may be dead in the Saki timeline. She's too pure and good for this world.<br>Shino wants to make friends with everyone, even her opponents (). Not being able to tell good people from bad ones (pic) will be her fatal flaw.<br>It will be interesting to see how Shino, Goldfish, Saki, and Teru are all connected.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Can you somehow squeeze the juice out of the fruit without cutting them open? Drill a hole with apple corer, then put a bottle in the hole and a plastic bag over the whole thing and squeeze?</br></br>  <br>It's not a coconut. Also durian is hard and spiky as hell.</br>  <br><br>Notice how many girls are in this picture. Who is who? Oh wait, who can be the mother? And who can be the daughters?</br></br>  <br><br>So smooth the spikes first, or put it between two bowls/plates. As to the hardness, Is it just the outer spiky shell, or is the inside tough too?</br></br>  <br>I don't know if you can smooth it, since it's the skin that's hard. Also it's more of a fleshy fruit, not a lot of juices to be extracted. You can make a shake though. <br><br><br> Ritz is just stalling on Saki on purpose just to build her characters in Shinohayu <br>It's Achiga all over again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I can smooth a rock with proper tools, a fruit is no problem. So if the inside isn't all that juicy, how much juice do you get out of one durian? A cupful? Maybe need to soak the pulp in some water after squeezing it.</br></br>  <br>Maybe you can, but I warn you the smell will spread after opening it.</br>  <br>But Saki is spinoff of Fatalizer.</br>  <br><br>Not if I open it inside a bag and scoop out the flesh into a jar.</br></br>  You know, it is the first time that Shinohayu's chapter is about mahjong. I predict a chapter with superpowers somewhere in 2017. Furthermore, in 2019 Shinohayus will be confirmed for not wearing panties.  <br>What do you mean? Shinohayu has had plenty of mahjong chapters. Like the last one, for example.</br>  <br><br>Mahjong in Shinohayu? NEVER.</br></br>  Don't go, Toki, don't go!  Living dead girl, dripping with sin...  America has gotten one step closer to the glossy future.<br>The only thing left to do is ban panties and heterosexual marriage.</br>  <br><br>What? Where do you get the idea that Sakiverse has banned hets?</br></br>  <br>Did you even watch the show? They talked about it all the time. <br>But I heard that some countries are starting to legalize it.</br></br>  <br><br>I've actually watched all of the anime episodes multiple times, first as they aired, then dvd and bluray versions from several groups. I don't remember a specific episode anywhere mentioning that hets are banned, so unless you can reference so I can double-check it, I'll have to call bullshit on this.</br></br>  <br> It was a joke </br>  <br>Joshiraku</br>  <br><br>There is no humor in Mahjong, only the utter seriousness of life or death through the tiles.</br></br>  <br><br>Strike Witches/Vividred/Saki threeway same-timeline-crossfade.</br></br>  <br>God, this is why Shino stopped playing with you, Teru.<br> And it's definitely 100% for certain not because she's dead. </br></br>  <br>Beautiful. But how do the Vividbutts dock mid match? Or do they dock pre-match?</br>  <br>Wait, the MC of Shinohayu met Teru?<br> I'm still not going to read it. </br></br>  <br><br>They don't dock during matches, that's lewd. They do it in the nap room.</br></br>  <br>The theory is that Shino is related to the Miyanaga's somehow.<br> Read it. </br></br>  <br>But it's not yet done.</br>  <br>Neither is Saki, and you're still reading that, right?</br>  <br>I never went past the end of the quarter finals since the anime ended and Waiting for the semis to end before I get back on that.</br>  <br>Anon, why are you even in these threads? There are spoilers everywhere.</br>  <br>We'll see her in a Critical Flashback for Saki during this match.</br>  (COMIC1☆9) [Kamogawaya (Kamogawa Tanuki)] CHERRY SISTER BLOSSOM (Saki)<br><br>Was this translated to english?</br></br>  <br>Why don't you search ex for english tagged saki galleries and find out?</br>  <br>I really forget the spoilers during reading.</br>  OTP  <br> 2:0 </br>  <br>Agreed.</br>  Best girl has arrived  <br>Yeah sorry I'm late.<br>Thanks for the lift.</br></br>  <br><br> Shino dying <br><br>Please no. Watching Shino care for her uncle when she was in elementary school after her mother disappeared made me realize Shino is the cutest.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it seems more like she was destroyed</br>  Why do I even bother?  So what is Nelly's power? Is it stealing an opponent's power for one round?  <br>Watching a niece being sexually groomed by her uncle isn't cute.</br>   3:0 <br>Let's have some fun.</br>  <br>No, Saki hasn't even rinshanned this match and Nelly doesn't seem to know who Saki is.</br>  <br> Saki hasn't even rinshanned <br>That's what stealing means. The target can't use that ability for one round.</br></br>  <br>But judging from the logic of the series she would have to know what the power is or see it in the first place. <br>It's too early to guess her power for the time being.</br></br>  <br> judging from the logic of the series she would have to know what the power is or see it in the first place <br><br>No.</br></br></br>  <br>People in Saki don't know things for no reason. There's always something like Teru's mirror and Toki's vision. <br>Ritz doesn't write stuff like that.</br></br>  <br> implying a monster player has to be bound by such silly rules you made up </br>  <br>The rule is there has to be rules. <br>Also since we didn't see Nelly's ability activate I'm guessing there has to be more to it.</br></br>  <br>No, the rule is there are no rules for creating a particular power.</br>  <br>ALRIGHT YOU LITTLE FUCKING FAGGOT<br>WE'LL SEE NEXT MONTH WHO'S FUCKING RIGHT HERE WHEN WE SEE THE LITTLE KIKES POWER <br>I WILL REMEMBER YOU AND CALL YOU OUT FOR BEING WRONG AND YOU'LL SEE THAT I'M RIGHT</br></br></br>  <br>Bring it on you disgusting hetero!</br>  <br>Take that back. Shino is innocent and cute.</br>  <br>No</br>  they seem to really like this little girl. It's a shame that such a nice design was wasted on a background character.<br><br> Who am I kidding, player number 5 is right here. Sorry Kyouka. </br></br>  Fuck mahjong. Let's play some building blocks instead.  Guys guys<br>Couldn't Nelly's power just be to control the deadwall?<br>Rinshan Kaihou is Saki's domain and short of copying / stealing an ability being Nelly's ability, it'd not make sense writing wise for Nelly's ability to be the same as Saki's.<br>That being said, when Sawaya was tenpai for Ton and 6p, both of the Ton happened to be dora indicators, which leads me to believe that Nelly put them there (also because she likes mocking people if the latest chapters are any indication, so she wouldn't make them uradora).<br>Sawaya NEEDED Kyouko to draw ton, because if Kyouko drew the second 6p (not sure if it was in the discard pool but I didn't see it there) then she would've gotten a baiman tsumo.<br>Now that I think about it, Sawaya's power was really glass-cannon - if Nelly didn't win that turn, Kyouko would've oyabai'd.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> deadwall <br><br>Too much overlap with Shizu ain't it?</br></br></br>  <br>Shizu's power is to negate all powers by apparently scrambling the entire wall (note Awai not being able to W-riichi a lot and Shindouji nearly being locked from a double yakuman).<br>That being said, her power would be absurdly overpowered if she could control the deadwall since it essentially obsoletes Awai's uradora, Kuro's doraspam, and Sakisan's Rinshan in one go.</br></br>  <br>Don't miss the Mayoi Neko Overrun episode <br><br/></br></br>    Toki  Why the hell was there never any Toki merchandise? <br>I don't think there was even a prize figure. <br>Even Kinue Atago got a damn prize figure.</br></br>  <br>I remember the Toki oppai mousepad, if that counts for anything.</br>  Who the hell would a figure that's 3cm tall?  <br>I'd guess 5cm tbh.</br>  <br><br>It would be too popular and Toki would take over the franchise.</br></br>  <br>it's for the best then<br><br>wouldn't want too much toki in our mahjong</br></br></br>  How do I become a Saki and wield the dreaded lesbian gambling magics?  <br>Too morbid.</br>  Tomorrow is the final episode/epilogue so I thought I should post this.<br><br>For those who don't know.<br>A artist on twitter by the name of Tsukumo has for every episode since UBW started up in October has posted multiple comics of Saber reacting to watching the UBW anime and Shirou reacting (along with other characters watching it). He was doing it based on what was should happen in the episode based on the VN (So he posted it when it happened live) and everything original in the anime.<br><br>It got really popular on both twitter and pixiv and he even decided to publish it as doujin.<br><br>Going to post all of it from episode 0-episode 24 along with the translated text and Shirou's reaction he posted with it on twitter.<br><br>Hope you enjoy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Prologue/Episode 0<br><br>Saber:Shirou...<br>I heard we are going to be on the television today.<br><br>Shirou: "Saber, calm down. There's still about 3 hours left."</br></br></br></br></br>  Shirou! It's starting, Shirou!!<br><br><br>Shirou: "You've been sitting straight while waiting for way too long, Saber..."</br></br></br>  That was all the screen time I have...?<br><br>Shirou: "Mine's just the same"</br></br>  Episode 1<br><br>Shirou...<br>Apparently we're supposed to see me in action today...<br><br> Shirou: "Are you going to sit there and wait like last week, Saber?"</br></br></br></br></br>  Shirou: "Yeah, I can see it just fine! Saber in action!"  Shota Shirou is fine too...<br><br>Shirou: "Where did you learn such a line?"</br></br>  Shirou: "...Saber? What's wrong?"  On TV:STOP SABER<br><br> Shirou: "… I didn't know Command Spells or something…"</br></br>  Episode 2<br><br> Shirou: (She's waiting even earlier than last week...)</br></br>  Saber singing the first opening of UBW<br><br> Shirou: (......What is this cute Heroic Spirit?)</br></br>  Though Shirou is a Master, the fact that he's such a half-assed Master seems to be the fault of a ghost.<br><br>Shirou: "The Holy Grail grants you even that sort of knowledge..." <br><br>If anyone actually reading this let me know as thread autosages if only OP posts</br></br></br></br>  Shirou!<br>I don't know why, but suddenly I want to eat mapo tofu!<br><br>Shirou: "What an amazing coincidence, me too!"</br></br></br>    On TV: I like people like you.<br><br>Rin:Hey Archer<br>Archer:Yeah<br>Rin:This is being recorded right?<br>Archer: Dunno</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay that got a laugh out of me.</br>  I like people like you.  <br><br>I laughed</br></br>  Episode 3 (did I mention he did a shit ton of these)<br><br>Lets use the Grail and make everyday Saturday, Shirou!<br><br>Shirou: "The staff will keel over, so lets not."</br></br></br></br>  Onii-chan<br><br>You must be so happy, being called Onii-chan like that...<br><br> Shirou: "THAT'S NOT TRUE"</br></br></br></br>  <br>What is Sakura holding?</br>  Ah~...<br>I would have won this if Archer and Shirou had not interrupted me...<br>Right? Shirou??<br><br> Shirou: "...Sorry."</br></br></br></br>  Illyasviel... poor thing ... It would be a good thing if she had just inherited Irisviel's lovely appearance...<br>She definitely inherited that devilish cool-headedness...<br><br> Shirou: "I don't know who you're talking about, but as far as you said, she must be such a..."</br></br></br>  <br>A hug pillow. I must say, she's taking this NTR extortionately well, How very mature she is. Look at her, just smiling at her crush being stolen away by her princess of a sister all with a big smile on her face. What a saint, too bad Rider had to be sacked with Shinji instead of her. I should read the novel one day</br>  ...How much did I spend just in this episode...?<br>No good, no good... If I start thinking about it I can't get over it... Be composed and elegant as always... Be composed and elegant as always...!<br>Uugh... I'm starting to have butterflies in my stomach...</br></br>  I'm reading  Damn, how many of these did he do? <br>I don't know if my heart can take this.</br>  Darn, these guys... Who do you guys think is in charge of cleaning up the mess...<br>Although it was less annoying without that damnable Caladbolg there last time...<br>Ahh.... My stomach...</br></br>  <br> Lets use the Grail and make everyday Saturday, Shirou! <br> tfw no more UBW on saturdays </br></br>  Episode 4<br><br>They say I'll be going to school in the next episode preview.<br>So I borrowed this from Rin for just today!<br><br> Shirou: "Maybe, but I doubt you'll be wearing it in the main part."</br></br></br></br></br>  There should of been a CPN episode where they make the stupidest most mundane wish they can on the grail just to see how it could possibly warp it to "Kill all of humanity"  Shirou... My stomach...<br><br> Shirou: "It's useless to look at me with those eyes. You have to wait till breakfast."</br></br>  Kill... Wow, that's not gentle!<br>Well, why don't you stay away from Rin then, Shirou!<br><br> Shirou: "Oh! Then properly return that uniform to her, why don't you!?"</br></br></br>  Hnnnng, seiba 3cute5me  Shirou: (In the screen and in front of me... She's showing off from both sides...!)  I see... So it's this kind of body language....  These are great. Thanks for posting OP.    Episode 5<br><br> Shirou: (Hmm?... After she saw that newly appeared servant, Saber's spirit seems to be lowered suddenly.)</br></br>  You use the command spell right after I told you to refrain from it...<br>You got close to the enemy servant when I told you to stay away...<br>You don't even think of calling me even if the situation demands it.<br>The Holy Grail War this time also seems difficult to deal with.<br><br> Shirou:".....Well....I mean...That is...."</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Holy crap. Bumping.</br></br>  <br>That slow realization that she's practically a non character in this adaptation.</br>  Shirou's inexperience is also Kiritsugu's fault....<br>....It's all Kiritsugu's... again...<br><br> Shirou: (Somehow, she's always gets so emotionally unstable when it comes to my father....)</br></br></br>  <br>A bag of worms. Dick worms.</br>    Heheh... Saber.<br>... Why do you take it for granted that you sit at that side of the table...</br>  <br> why am I so perfect </br>  Rin reaction to Episode 5<br><br>Archer:What are you writhing in agony about, Rin..?<br>Rin:...When I look at my own behavior in an objective perspective I start falling into a state of self-loathing...<br>Archer:Hoo... So you do have some self-consciousness. You are what they call a Tsunde-<br>Rin:DON'T SAY IT!</br></br></br></br></br>  Saber got too excited and thought UBW was suppose to air a day early<br><br>Shirou... Even though it's already past midnight, there's no episode 6...<br><br> Shirou: "Saber, calm down and check what day is it today."</br></br></br></br>  <br>you forgot to translate this</br>  Episode 6<br>On TV: I want you to stay over tonight also.<br><br><br>Shit you're right. I was planning on skipping that as it was a extra one he made that was not in the episode. It is just talking about Shirou relationship with Fuji-nee and Sakura</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tohsaka Rin pleases old men.</br>  Shirou: "Saber is usually in high spirits when watching Fate, but it's scary that she makes an expressionless face each time Shinji is on-screen..."  <br>Looks like Sakura punched her head back.</br>  <br>Jesus Christ, Saber<br>Dial back on the cute before you kill everyone<br><br><br>Hoping there is more Sakura watching this route. It's getting more hilarious.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>When did Sakura get so scary?</br>  On TV: I can't leave my sister with you.<br><br><br>There is</br></br></br>  <br>She realized she fucked up her chance.</br>  The King's cuteness is clearly ∞. Hnnng.  I want to see Saber's reaction when she's forced to destroy the Grail by Kiritsugu.<br> tfw rewatched that scene 10+ times because it's so good </br>  Illya and Rin, Rider then Caster,<br>fufu...<br>Being assaulted by all sorts of females everyday, Shirou is such a sinful man.<br><br> Shirou: "Don't say such misleading thing!"</br></br></br></br>  A Samurai.....huh<br>I really wanted to get some fighting experience with a certain sword style<br>I think it was called..... Hiten Mitsurugi-ryuu!<br>Kenshin:I don't want to work!<br><br> Shirou "So why does the Holy Grail grant her that sort of knowledge?"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Reminder that these violent bitches beat shirou up together once because he wouldn't listen, where as Rin just scolded him then told him not to do it again or at least include her in on it as well so she doesn't feel left out. Truly the best girl.</br></br>  On TV:Once I get my hands on the Holy Grail, I'll just leave this world.<br><br> Shirou: "Even though it's your own line, why are you making a face as if this is the first time you hear it?"</br></br>  <br>Does Shirou have the most women beating him up out of all Type Moon Protagonists?</br>  <br> Reminder that these violent bitches beat shirou up together once because he wouldn't listen <br><br>When did this happen?</br></br></br>  Episode 7<br><br>Shirou...! When did you get so much closer to Archer...!?<br><br> Shirou: (Somehow, she began to go huff huff)</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, I think Shiki gets abused worse</br>  I won't lag behind Archer in swordsmanship...<br>Caster's spells are also ineffective when met against my Anti-Magic.<br>As long as that Assassin guy isn't here, I'm probably the Champion of this place~<br>Really, as long as that Assassin guy isn't here....!<br><br> Shirou: "Oh, right."</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HOLY SHIT<br>IS RIN TYPING ON /a/ AS WELL!?<br><br>This comic is getting a bit too meta for me</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not that guy, but there is a scene in the novel where, if you don't get home to Saber quick enough to make her dinner, she basically beats the shit out of him under the guise of "training".</br>    <br>early heavens feel and a scene in HA. Also, both bitches are cockblockers in that game where as Rin leaves Shirou alone. Seriously worst girls only whiteknight faggots would like these balls and chains.</br>  Three strokes were released in one swing...huh.<br>If I master this technique, I'll be able to overwhelmingly secure the side dishes from Taiga.<br><br> Shirou: "To use the technique that is capable of matching a Noble Phantasm for that...?"</br></br></br>  <br>Someone is into selfcest</br>  Shirou, by any chance, is that his own wording he created based on the phrase "absorbed in the ideal"...?<br>About that, let's ask the person in question carefully this time.<br><br> Shirou: (Forced to explain what he said with so much confidence... How frightening...)</br></br></br>  <br>Shiki's harem are more aggresive but he can tame them. Meanwhile shirou only aused by Rin.</br>  <br>Are Mikiya and Shizuki truly the most blessed Type Moon MCs?</br>  <br>So close Sakura<br><br>Since the beginning of time</br></br></br>  Yeah... Archer attacking Shirou is certainly...<br>... "fine".<br><br> Shirou: "Wait a minute, what are you implying?"</br></br></br>  <br> Meanwhile shirou only aused by Rin. <br><br>Maybe in the HA dream world. She never hits him in the original novel.</br></br></br>  .......Why did you do that....?<br>Ah, so it's that kind of attitude. Hmm....<br>Then keep kneeling there until you say something.</br></br>  <br>When she accessed literally unlimited mana and became god</br>  <br>Fucking fujo.</br>  <br>Does Saber actually love Archer as much as Shirou?<br><br>How happy would Archer be if he knew this, considering his Saber is gone?</br></br></br>  Episode 8<br>Today's Saturday, Shirou!<br>And moreover...! It's also the "Good Meat" day!<br><br> Shirou: "Today's dinner's fish."</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, with her, it's probably like being sandwiched by two shirous.<br>So she'd love it.</br></br>  Shirou... I'm sorry but, could you please refrain from putting anymore seaweed into the miso soup for a while...?<br><br> Shirou: "Don't blame the food... Although, I can see the connection"</br></br>  <br> Shirou: "Today's dinner's fish." <br><br>BTFO</br></br></br>  Shirou...!<br>Stop taking the periodical "Food Terrorism" during this time period!<br><br> Shirou: "Can you ask that to me in the screen?"</br></br></br>  <br>When it's Shirou it's okay</br>  GJ, Shirou...!<br>You're finally willing to obediently listen to my advice...<br><br> Shirou: "Ah...uhm, I'm sorry, somehow."</br></br></br>  This stuff is great. Thanks for posting it, OP  Rider:My turn... Why does it have to end...?<br><br>Sakura: I'm sorry. I'm sorry for that useless brother</br></br>  TV:Ah, looks like everyone's still alive. Now what's left is to get help.<br>...So, should we get an ambulance in this situation?<br>Kirei:Hmm... Right, since I have my hands full with the growing matters at Ryuudo temple...<br><br>TV:It'll do with contacting the Church. Kirei will manage the rest after we explain.<br>Kirei:I KNEW IT</br></br></br></br></br>  Episode 9<br> Shirou: (Archer's stir-up seems to have worked extremely well.)</br>  <br>Didn't have a chance. <br>Keep em coming.</br></br>  Let's bear with it for now, Rider.<br>We will be key characters in the movie version, eventually... our patience will be rewarded....</br>  <br>What did Sakura do to Shirou after seeing that?</br>  TV:Issei, don't say anything, just take off your jacket!<br><br> Shirou:"(Oh no..! She's seems to be having some strange misunderstanding again...!)"</br></br>  Heart attack thread? Heart attack thread.  Ah, while the TV's showing that blonde guy, can I turn it off, Shirou?<br><br> Shirou: "Why?"</br></br>  I'm excited  <br>Made me laugh, poor Kirei</br>  TV:Kiritsugu-san was the kind of person that was OK with anything you did.<br>Good things, bad things - everything was just a part of life for him.<br>When you see someone like that, you can't help but do something about it.<br><br>Saber:Oh, you're a funny one, Taiga~<br><br> Shirou: (The Kiritsugu I remember and the Kiritsugu that Saber remembers really don't match.)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  You can think of me like an older sister if you want, Shirou.<br><br> Twitch <br><br> Shirou: (A tiny older sister....Huh? Why does this feels strangely familiar...)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Come on, Saber.<br>I know you use to be a guy, but-<br>Er, wait<br><br><br>Please explain</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Episode 10<br><br>In the face of my Anti-Magic, Caster's attacks are insignificant.<br><br>It's a pity for them, since now without Assassin around this battle is gonna be a one-sided victory for me!<br><br> Shirou: "As expected of you, Saber!"</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rin:...When I look at my own behavior in an objective perspective I start falling into a state of self-loathing... </br>  Shirou: "Ah."    <br>Oh lawd</br>  <br> Saber is usually in high spirits when watching Fate, but it's scary that she makes an expressionless face each time Shinji is on-screen.. <br>You and me both Saber</br></br>  It's not what you're thinking, Shirou!<br>This is.... I mean....<br>It's not!!<br><br> Shirou: (You're not very good at hiding your emotion, Saber.)</br></br></br></br>  By the way Shirou, weapons are good and all...<br>but can't you make food out from your Projection magecraft? <br><br> Shirou: (She's too faithful to her instinct)</br></br></br>  Shall I typeset all of this then?  Episode 11<br>Apparently, Shirou gets a lot more nervous when you touch Rin, a girl of the same year than when you did with me, a heroic spirit, ain't that right.<br><br> Shirou: (A school Idol is a romantic being for a mediocre male student)</br></br></br>  <br>if by typeset you mean put the subs into the picture then sure.</br>  <br><br><br>Did saber ever go full fujo shipping her knights together<br>Is it maybe one of the reasons Lancelot went berserker</br></br></br></br>  <br>Please do. With the proper font, of course.<br>Thank you very much.</br></br>  ...Alright...alright!!<br>I was able to act casual while being carried off!</br>    <br>Rin a cute.</br>  <br>MY HEART, THIS IS TOO MUCH</br>  <br><br><br>Poor Saber</br></br></br>  Mm? "Make it luxurious" was just said wasn't it?<br>Can I look forward to tomorrow's lunch...?<br><br> Shirou: "Elsewhere is elsewhere, here is here. Saber."</br></br></br>  <br> 11/29 <br> ii niku <br>I love those stupid jokes.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel even worse for Sakura.<br>Don't worry. You'll get your movie soon.</br></br>  <br>Yes, yes it will along with a manga</br>  Episode 12<br>Shirou!<br>I heard tonight's episode is 1 hour long!<br><br> Shirou: "Good for you, Saber." <br><br><br>That would be great</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> feeling bad for the wormslut <br>No anon, you have shit taste</br></br>  <br>Do it anon!</br>  ...It's fine I stand here and wait again, yes?<br>What's wrong? You want to watch the show together with me?<br>.......Forget it....</br></br>  Sweets<br><br> Shirou: "(I'll take her there next time...)"</br></br>  Sakura! Sakuraa!! Don't do anything rash please!<br><br>Let's stop this, okay!? Your body can't take it if you watch anymore...</br></br>  <br>She gets a happy page for Noriko's wedding announcement, other than that expect more Sakura and Rider bullying</br>  <br>Sakura's reactions is the best thing about this comic series.</br>  Cut comic that he didn't use as it wasn't used in the anime.<br><br>Rin and Saber telling Shirou to give up on Taiga</br></br>  My contract with Shirou is gone...<br><br>Does that mean that I have to watch "fate" from Caster's workshop from now on?<br><br> Shirou: "It's fine, since I live here."</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hang in there Sakura.</br>  You're staring at her too much, Shirou.<br><br>Shirou: "......What!?</br></br>  <br>But look at her! <br/></br>  Ah...

I'll start to like her.  <br>To be fair, Saber acts nowhere close to this in canon.</br>  <br>Oh god I think I'd fuck a king</br>  I really like everything about you, Tohsaka!  <br>We can just assume this is the Carnival Phantasm universe, right?</br>  <br>Isn't F/HA canon?</br>  <br>forever suffering</br>  Episode 14<br>Looks like you're having a lot of fun, Shirou.<br>While I'm not around...<br><br> Shirou (Let sleeping dogs lie...)</br></br></br></br>  <br>L O N D O N<br>O<br>N<br>D<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fool!

It all happens in a dream.</br>  <br>God damnit<br>Look like I found a new reaction image</br></br>  Heracles... A very well-known hero of Greece.<br>Although it's also famous as a Disn○y film...<br><br>In actuality I'm also featured in a Dis○ey film too, Shirou.<br>Therefore that makes us on equal footing!<br>The Sword in the Stone (1963)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope the artist does a Sakura watches Heaven's Feel album.</br>  <br>So dejected she became a hunchback.</br>  Huh!?<br>For last week and this week, it just ended with me doing only this pose?!<br><br> Shirou: It could still be the same case for you next week.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This hurts a bit. Ganbatte purple.</br></br>  Amazing.  I get the feeling that just now, the minds of every single person in Japan became as one.<br>And they're feeling: "What a pity!".<br><br> Shirou: (I think I'm feeling a little sorry for Shinji...)</br></br></br>  <br>Well shit.</br>  Episode 15<br>You know, I'm gonna cheer for Berserker.<br>I bet you tomorrow dinner's side dish that Berserker's going to win.<br><br> Shirou: "Oh."</br></br></br></br>  <br> "Oh" </br>    ...I think that to Berserker, this was a case of being in a fatally bad matchup against that goldie.<br>If I had to make a comparison...<br>If we were talking about the original SF2, it would have been a "Guile vs Zangief" fight.<br><br> Shirou: "Wasn't it more desperate than that..?"</br></br></br></br>  <br>That wasn't you, faker.</br>  Shirou: "......"  I don't want this to be how I go out!<br>No! No!<br><br>I don't get anymore screentime?!<br>No!! No!!<br><br>No... No...</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>oh god</br></br>  <br>At least she has Prisma.</br>  In-between episode when it was announced Noriko Shitaya got married and how she has strong feelings towards Sakura.  <br>Welp, there goes my good mood</br>  <br>And so Illya went to sleep  forever </br>  I wonder if there'll be a development where Shinji gets shot out from the Gates of Babylon and is completely forgotten as the fight with Berserker starts...  <br>Make it stop.</br>  <br>To protect her right?</br>  I think this is 16<br><br>As expected, I also got a little girl type main heroine for an opponent...</br></br>    <br>Well, at least she has this</br>  Kiritsugu...<br><br> Shirou:(Even though the misunderstanding about my father has been solved, she still has that blatantly complex look on her face.)</br></br>  So that means that even my sword is just a hand-me-down from that man...<br>Ugh... Other than me having "Blonde hair" and being a "King", everything I have is in common with that man...<br><br> Shirou: "Don't you think you are overthinking it?"</br></br></br>  I have always thought of Lancer as a Heroic Spirit worthy of trust from long ago.<br><br> Shirou: (Didn't you diss him pretty hard back in ep 12...?)</br></br>  <br>Horay a smile</br>  Even if I am in charge of sexiness in "Fate", I think it would've been a bit much for me to stay like that.<br><br><br>Shirou: "Who's in charge of what now!?"</br></br></br>  <br>How happy would Sakura be if she married Shirou?</br>  What an absolute disgrace to chivalry even though they're part of the Three Great Knight classes!!<br>The Archer classes are always like this!!<br>You musn't grow up to be such a man, you got that Shirou!?<br>Shirou: "I'll see what I can do."</br></br></br>  <br>A victory for Sakura</br>  <br>We'll never know. Closest she gets is with a Real Doll.</br>  That was a pretty impressive shield, but<br>did you know? There's an ultimate defense that shuts out magic<br>that exists in this world.<br><br>*A-HEM*<br>The truth is, I'm talking about my Noble Phantasm,<br>Avalon!!<br>...Though I can't use it right now.......<br>Shirou: (This smug, competitive king of knights is priceless)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Saber repeating the same thing she said about Lancer but with Archer this time.  <br>Maybe a bit happier than these three</br>  <br>What route are the audience based on?</br>  I'm quite satisfied despite the outcome, Souichirou-sama.<br>*Clap, clap, clap*<br>Mmm.</br></br>  <br>Nigger can you even read</br>  <br>Seems to be Carnival Phantasm or HA.</br>  Shirou: "You're going to get dizzy if you keep doing 180's like that, Saber."  <br>Castah a cute</br>  Shirou! This is ultimately a temporary arrangement!<br>I have no intention of leaving your side, so rest easy...!<br><br> Shirou: "Yup, it's an emergency after all."</br></br></br>  <br>What are they saying here?</br>  <br>It hurts</br>  A Master who can allow me to fight at full power continuously without needing to worry about mana consumption...<br>This is fine, too...<br><br> Shirou: "Saber-san!!?"</br></br></br>  Shirou: "Holy! It's a genuine pronunciation!"  <br> that little pegasus </br>  <br>Weren't Kerry and Iri that kind of Master?</br>  What if... I'm saying what if...<br>If I use food as a weapon then it's possible to do a projection of it, right?<br><br> Shirou: "You're hungry aren't you, Saber?"</br></br></br>  <br>How many years of English are Japanese people required to take? And they can't even remember a meme line?</br>  TV Screen:You can't do that. Shirou, Archer is your...<br>I know. I know what he is...<br>I've probably known since the moment we met...<br><br> Shirou: (Our Saber is making a face as if she's just now realized it...)</br></br></br></br>  In other words, Shirou has the possibility of growing 20cm taller as of now you say...<br>I-I'm not a least bit envious of that you know!<br>Stopped growing at the height of 154cm</br></br>  <br> You were the red man all along? <br><br>Poor saber.</br></br></br>  Forced to kill himself again...<br><br><br>Shirou: Looks like that triggered a trauma for her...</br></br></br>  <br>Can Shirou actually project any food that's sword related?</br>  TV Screen: Sorry about that, brat. My fist went flying before my words.<br><br>Sakura seems to be having fun...</br></br>  <br>Womanlets, when will they learn?</br>  <br>swordfish?</br>  <br><br>Is she turned on or scared?</br></br>  It feels as though I'm a mother watching over her child while attending Parents' Day at his school...  <br>more like shocked</br>  Awkward...  <br>Bad things happening to Shinji is something most all can appreciate</br>  <br>What would Lancer have done for Sakura if he was her servant?</br>  Look, Archer. This is what a proper heroic spirit is like.<br>*Ptoo*</br>    <br>But you are his mother.<br><br>Nasu said so.</br></br></br>  HU~m... He made you strong enough to match his blows...<br>He's supposed to be the servant "Archer,"<br>but I think...<br>*smuug...*<br>he's more of a "Teacher!"<br>Right!? Teacher... Heh, heh.<br>Shirou: (...What to do? That face she's making says that she herself thinks she's being clever.)</br></br></br></br></br></br>      *Ptui*<br>Ho...<br>So now I'm "Yours"...</br></br>  <br>Pouring salt, man.</br>  To think that the Holy Grail that gave me knowledge of so many "anime" and "games"...<br>would turn out to be so dreadful...<br>Shirou: (This Grail sure is strangely worldly-minded...)</br></br>  <br>Smug/10</br>  <br>What.</br>  Thank you.<br>May you rest in peace... Nii-san...</br>  <br>I've never understood why Japs like Rin/Archer.</br>  <br>Unfortunately he gets rescued</br>  If only Shirou would return me my scabbard, I would surely win!!<br><br>Shirou: (This sulky, competitive king of knights is priceless)</br></br>  My Instinct skill tells me that after this, there would be a midnight anime-like development.<br><br><br>Shirou: "......!!"</br></br></br>  <br>I like it, although I am not Japanese.</br>  Hmm... looks like my Instinct skill from before had missed its mark...    Reacting to the post transfer scene  <br>Will Rin ever win?</br>  <br>I don't get it either honestly. Maybe if they just interacted a little bit more...</br>  This is the best thread on /a/ tonight.  Come to think of it, about today's broadcast where you and Rin interacted, weren't Shirou's friends and the nearby residents watching...?  <br>Oh man these are gold</br>  <br>Not your route, tool.</br>  No translation for this yet  TV:Whatever else he is, he's still Sakura's brother.<br><br>Please, don't worry about me...</br></br>  <br><br><br>How would Saber react to her sex scene with Shirou?</br></br></br>  <br>Sakura is scary.</br>  There was only a slight appearance in the 3rd and 18th episode, but now it has finally shown its true form!<br>Shirou: "Don't release it at home!"</br>  <br>Why is Rin a shit?</br>  What on Earth are these people doing in my home...?  <br>So close to having a forever meat blob shinji</br>  <br>it sure is anon<br> I just finished oregiaru and i dont want see the shitstorm threads there </br></br>  <br>Didn't she use it on weeds during TMwitter?</br>  <br><br>Sakura didn't give a fuck about her uncle that's the only person who tried to help her, why would she care about her NBR nii-san who never cared for her?</br></br>  <br>I don't even like Sakura very much, but I'm hoping we get more of this for HF</br>  <br>My sides</br>  Wha...!? That was a rare opportunity for me to play around with Saber...  <br>Ha</br>  <br>I imagine that she would try to replicate the scenes exactly as they develop</br>  Shirou...! I can teach you if you're not good at English pronunciation!<br>Shirou: "I'm a Japanese, so chanting in Japanese is fine!"</br>  <br>Sorry, Sakura</br>  <br>I hope they bring this up in episode 25. They fuck the temple up way more than in the novel.</br>  Here I come, King of Heroes. Do you have enough weapons in stock?<br>Ha! The Shirou next to me is making the kind of amazingly smug face he's never made before!!<br>Shirou: That's not true.</br></br>  <br>It's all the fault of that witch, Tohsaka</br>  Archer!?<br>You're alive!?</br>  <br>I wonder if Archer and Shirou made this face at the same time.</br>  Shirou... It seems that our time to part has come at last...<br>Shirou: Saber... Don't tell me you're disappearing...?</br>  Ah, the me over here isn't going to disappear.<br>Shirou: I knew it.</br>  <br> Gilfags and Zerofags </br>  I see... So my scabbard is inside of Shirou...<br>Will it be fine if I insert my hand into you to confirm?<br>Excited<br>It won't hurt... it really won't!<br><br><br>Shirou: That's creepy.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  He posted this 3 hours ago so be ready for the last few.<br><br>I hope you guys enjoyed it.</br></br>    <br>I think you're missing the joke. Shinji had just been turned into that giant mass of flesh when she says "rest in peace" sort of as a good riddance. Then when Rin is saving him she says "don't worry about me" as in you can just leave him as a giant fleshy vegetable.</br>  <br>Is she trying to pull a Gendo?</br>  <br>Template for those who would find this interesting to mess with</br>  <br>Doing god's work, anon</br>  This was one of the best threads in recent times.<br><br>That guy who offered to typeset things better be working in it. I expect to see this thread again another day with the things properly typeset.</br></br>  <br>my fucking sides</br>  Thanks! This was great, anon.  <br> That Doraemon's face <br>It has been quite sometime, damn.</br></br>  <br> fisting <br>Is this how she pleasures a man?</br></br>  This was gold, thanks OP  <br> mfw casters' clap when they die </br>  Thanks for doing this, OP.  <br>Caster is not for lewds</br>  Glad you took the time to post all this. You done good, OP  <br>i wouldn't be surprised if it showed up tomorrow<br>also, thank you based OP</br></br>    Glad you guys enjoyed it.<br>It never took off on /a/ outside of the airing threads so I thought I might as well do it now.<br><br>Now to get a little sleep and watch the ending and have a little hope they will tease HF at the end.</br></br></br>    <br> HA <br>HA is irrelevant since Rin is also an abusive tsundere in HA.</br></br>    <br> have a little hope they will tease HF at the end. <br>I doubt that, Ufotable are dying while trying to finish UBW and prepare for God Eater.</br></br>  <br> hope they will tease HF at the end <br><br>Don't want to burst your bubble, but I wouldn't put too much in them teasing HF. Ufotable has their hands full with God Eater right now as is. From what I understand, they actually had to cancel a pre-screening for that, so they might be scrambling.</br></br></br>  <br>Has Saber been learning from Aoko?</br>  I just realized we had a UBW thread without the usual shitpost. <br><br><br>Have some non sexualized Castah then</br></br></br>  <br> Those eyes <br>Dayummm son</br></br>  <br><br>Why would they be scrambling for the Epilogue?<br><br>It's not like it's budget heavy, whats with the rush?</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, they're scrambling with God Eater, which airs real fucking soon.</br>  <br> she'll always love Shirou no matter what <br>Truly the greatest love ever.</br></br>  <br>Weird, wasn't the adaption planned for months?</br>  <br><br>Not expecting anything special. <br><br>UBW ends with saying HF route is now unlocked so the anime equivalent would be fine. If anything it will be in Type-Moon Ace in a few more days.</br></br></br></br>    <br>best one of the bunch</br>  <br>For whatever reason, the production of UBW's second half faced a lot more time constraints. The epilogue has no preview images so it's safe to assume that Ufo have yet to wrap up production. They should be done by now though. God Eater on the other hand is a different matter and is gearing up to being a production mess for the studio.<br><br><br>Planning is one thing, but they can't start animating when most of the studio is so busy with the current project. Either Ufotable overestimated their production capacity or Bandai Namco insisted on the God Eater anime airing this summer.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's like you just want to turn Caster into a sex slave<br>When you can just  hold hands  with her</br></br>  <br> The epilogue has no preview images so it's safe to assume that Ufo have yet to wrap up production. <br>What does not showing anything have to do with production?<br> Episode 24 only had 1 image previewed the whole time.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure about the whole preview image thing. I know God Eater is facing trouble, but it seems to me that Ufotable's just trying to be suspenseful with the last episodes. Before 24 they would literally give a full summary of the episode a week before it aired.</br>  <br> spoiler <br>you sick fuck.</br></br>  God Eater is airing literally a week after UBW, and it's only going to be 13 episodes. I'm guessing they thought they would have more time.  People think the F/SN project has only been worked on since 2013.<br><br>This shit was planned prior to F/Z airing so already back in 2010 they have been working on all of this.</br></br>  <br>Which one was it? That sound pretty familiar.</br>  <br> This shit was planned prior to F/Z airing so already back in 2010 <br><br>And yet they let the UBW movie happen?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Normally the site uploads around five pictures per preview, and the staff credits for UBW's second half is much larger not to mention a chunk of the key animation for some episodes were outsourced. More people on a production tends to mean that time is running short- so work is divided among more people to get things done. <br><br>Episode 24 had 27 guys plus a number of subcontractors on second key animation to help clean up the work of 19 key animators. The first season didn't have to fall back on second key animators this much.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm still not sure about the preview image thing. That seems more like they just wanted to keep people in suspense.</br>  <br>Of course they wanted Deen to first do it and completely shit on it later. Nasu hates DEEN and doesn't acknowledge it.</br>  <br>She's always been very patient with Shirou's philandering</br>  <br>Well, regardless of the real reason for the lack of pictures, the studio has definitely been rushing to wrap up production and God Eater has been affected by this.</br>  <br> multirouting <br>This is how you get bad ends.</br></br>  <br>Is Sakura the closest Shirou will get to a girl in his harem as violent as the ones in Shiki's?</br>  <br>They interact plenty. <br>There are 2 Emiya's so you could argue they interact twice as much as anyone else.</br></br>  <br>I'm actually curious about God Eater now. Ufotable's non-TM efforts haven't been that particularly stellar. Wonder if it's gonna be bad.</br>  <br>Illya's pretty close, she wanted to turn him into a doll or kill him</br>  <br><br>So cute I died.</br></br>  <br> Ufotable's non-TM efforts haven't been that particularly stellar <br>In what sense?</br></br>  <br>I think her left arm is severely dislocated.</br>  <br>Their non-TM shows haven't exactly been stellar<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ufota<wbr>ble</wbr></br></br>  <br>That face says<br> I'd really want to do something about this if it wouldn't ruin my date </br></br>  <br>The question is, was multirouting's bad end better or worse than choosing the main heroine?</br>  <br> Shiki's true route heroine isn't too bad </br>  <br>I don't get what that article is supposed to prove. You're right in terms of sales, but otherwise the studio have made good non-Type Moon productions as well.</br>  <br>None of their non-TM shows have really been 'hits' except for the recent 'yoyo to nene' movie.</br>  <br> yoyo to nene <br>I don't think that was popular at all. Well, at the very least BD sales were poor if I recall correctly.</br></br>    <br> A pissed off Arc is worse than death though. <br><br>What would she have done if she didnt do a team attack with Saber?</br></br></br>  <br>We're readily approaching Sakura's darkest hours.</br>  <br><br>Soon.</br></br>  <br><br>Pay your respects to the fallen cherry blossom</br></br>  <br><br> Fallen Cherry Blossom <br> www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Zis2TtxdFj<wbr>Q</wbr>  [ ] </br></br></br>  <br>I'll be drinking one for me and one for Sakura.

ITT: Good shows that everybody seems to have forgotten  Wolf's Rain  <br>One of the few shows I deleted after finishing instead of archiving. Felt absolutely zero desire to ever watch it again after seeing it once.</br>    <br>Hey fuck you man.  I forgive you. </br>  <br>You should of saved at least the last episode. The part where pink hair girl with that green hair guy being pulled together by that animal was the most hnng thing i've seen in anime. I still go back to it sometimes just so i can put a huge smile on my face.</br>    i wanted to forget... but now I remember everything vividly. man Toonami really took away my childhood with FLCL and Eureka 7  <br> everybody seems to have forgotten <br> Eureka7 </br></br>  <br>funny thing, this show probably has the most realistic approach to relationships. Through the eyes of the MC, we saw how the crew and ultimately the girl grew into this family bond.<br><br>The last half of the show is stretched too far IMO but otherwise it was a satisfying ending.</br></br></br>  <br>The movie and sequel soured a lot of people.</br>    <br>I still haven't watched AO. I read so many bad things that I'm scared to ruin my memories</br>   Everybody forgot the fansub fiasco surrounding E7   <br>What happened? I wasn't around at the time</br>  <br>It's actually kind of amazing.<br>Not only is it a bad sequel, but it actually makes the first series worse by establishing that  Renton and Eureka's first child dies and any more children they have can never live in their world.

I love Chinese Electric Batman.</br>  <br>But the edginess is totally justified.

Playing a MMO on PC using a freakin' controller and not KBM? That's gimping yourself on purpose. Anyone that's srs biz on MMO would multibox and use keyboard that has macro and mice with a gazillion buttons, not freaking 360 controller.</br>  <br>Well, if she plays ARR then controller is okay, macros in that game aren't all that good for combat because the delay can really fuck you up and the controller controls are pretty good. For anything else though, yeah she's pretty much the embodiement of everything that's wrong with gamers these days<br> People ACTUALLY PLAY SHOOTERS WITH CONTROLLER </br></br>  <br> macro delay <br><br>The 5-10ms delay in presses really doesn't matter.

Then Kimi Nozo is the anime for you.</br>  What kind of MC cucks his comatose girlfriend for her best friend?  <br>Pretty damn good.</br>  <br><br>it will make you angry<br><br>it's good</br></br></br></br>  <br>The kind of MC who would have gotten laid without the accident. He had been clearly mentally expectant of sexual intercourse and thus couldn't handle the lack of it.</br>  <br>Best girl won.</br>  <br>It's a good adaptation of the VN, but lacks in certain areas and removes some character interactions that still have a presence. Too bad the anime dropped all of Takayuki's soliloquies. This is pretty bad as they gave far more depth to his character. Now you really have to think yourself what he is going through, which most people just don't do. <br>It would be good to approach it with an open mind and trying to relate most characters.<br><br><br>The kind who tries to move on with his life rather than stagnate in one moment in time, especially afterwards he is kicked out from her life by her own parents. Then everything just goes to shit after he is just getting a bit better.  Haruka was aware of Hayase's feelings and basically fucked her best friend because she just wanted to have some dick. She also realised Takayuki had feeling for Hayase early on, but continued to spin him around her finger. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>An MC who is traumatized, guilt-stricken and not written to appeal to otaku fantasies.</br>  One of the few shows to give me a real feeling of anxiety while watching  It's like a Telemundo soap opera, I loved it.  Oh, watch the first two episodes back to back. That's a must now that you don't have to wait a week between them.  <br>He gets counter-cucked, so it's all good.<br>Also, Mitsuki a slut.</br></br>  <br>Legends say that waifu wars were impressive when this shit aired.</br>  <br>I've never seen worse kind of faggotry. All the secondaries who never even touched the VN couldn't wrap their heads around why things were happening and why characters acted like flawed human beings. We are talking about socially awkward faggots like  that throw catchphrases around like it was the hottest shit around, so we should never expect them to take real life into notion.</br>  <br>Is the VN good? I heard it suffered from bad pacing.</br>  Mitsuki was one of the first girls I religiously saved images of  <br><br>Rumbling Hearts is a good title considering how rage-inducing the series can be.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure being a slut for revenge is a shitty thing to do no matter what the circumstances</br>  <br>The VN is excellent, âge's masterpiece by all means. Pacing issues are always subjective. There are bits that may seem mundane and long, but we are talking about true slice of life story, not that K-On kind of silly shit. Even with the mundane you get glimpses into the characters, their motivations and what carries them. Father Suzumiya has a much larger role in it and really works great balance to inexperienced Takayuki. Sadly his most important role was moved to Fumio, the red haired nurse, despite she being a complete slut. A nice slut, but a slut nonetheless.<br>The pacing issue can be said to apply to all of âge's mainline works. This is how the writing style is usually applied with characters actually pondering and waging issues. Muv-Luv Alternative had few of those info dumps in form of classes, but we are in assumptions that the reader takes the role of the main character, so the reader has access to the main character's experiences and inner life.<br>Takayuki's inner life is one of the main reasons people really need to read the VN, as it show how fucked he is after the accident to the point of freezing due to PTSD at multiple points.<br>The VN of course has more time to elaborate on the strong points of each character as well as how they are weak, and I see a lot of people missing how weak Hayase's psyche really is, despite it being on the platter even in the TV-series.<br><br><br>It's also the series' official international title, used in Hong Kong DVD release that came before Western ones.<br><br><br>Fumio is a slut, Hayase's literal complete mental breakdown doesn't amount to that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>My nigga</br></br>  <br>Hey there  Kiminozo Guy. </br>  <br>Thanks for the in-depth post. I have Latest Edition installed so I'll finally get started on it.</br>  <br>Didn't the anime adapt one of the less than optimal endings?</br>  <br><br>Niggas have good taste<br><br><br> Tee hee hee too much whisky <br><br><br>Just keep away from Homura's routes until you've gone through all others and are properly drunk.<br><br><br>It adapted less than optimal route for  Hayase . It is possible to stand firm and tell  Haruka as things are when it comes to it, preventing Hayase's mental breakdown.  It takes some liberties with certain events and goes even to the extent to change how they go.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Muv-Luv Thread?  <br>Reminder that Mitsuki is the worst.</br>  <br>The worst was really Shinji. It's pretty easy to have your way with a person with almost complete breakdown.<br>Or Haruka, depending if you want to see love stealing little faux-princess who acts like she is doing nothing wrong as a friend betraying act.</br></br>  I recall acquiring a sinking feeling in my gut as I watched it with the dull realisation that there was absolutely no positive way this could end for any of these people. All I could do to stay afloat was cling to the knowledge that as bad as things were for them, they had it a lot worse one universe over.  <br>It's really more Takayuki's fault than anything. If he wasn't trying to have his cake and eat it too, then maybe things would've ended better.</br>  This show is fucking horrible, like no joke people complain about forced drama in SOL series but this takes the cake, it relies entirely on the MC being a complete retard and the heroine being a complete sociopath. It attempts to be mature but winds up feeling like a 3rd rate porno plot.    <br>But he wasn't. He was guilt ridden to four different directions. He still had a standing PTSD due to the accident, the current situation with Haruka and whatever delusions he had with it, his guilt towards treating Hayase like shit and ignoring her pleads to notice her shattering mental health. Then you have Haruka's dad coming back and requesting him to help Haruka to get better, and then Akane just drops the fucking bomb about her own feelings, after which she just gets sick and Takayuki has to take care of her. Oh wait, that didn't happen in the series.<br>Everything around him just shatters, and he can't literally move on for three years. Then when he is finally making some progress, shit just goes wrong. Too much responsibility is stacked on him to the point he can't even handle his own emotions and acts on how things were, not how things are and that's why he can't be true to himself until, once again, it is forced on him. Only when shit hits the fan he manages to drop the responsibilities that are not his to deal with.<br><br>And nigger, I'll fight you about the end. After all, it all ends in  Haruka marrying some with Murakami as his last name and realizes her dream as a children's book author, Akane becomes the school swimming team captain, Homura doesn't peg sex-changed Takayuki all night, and Hayase and Takayuki live as a proper family and they all get together after some time to meet again as friends  on that hill.</br></br></br></br>  But White Album 2 does the whole flawed characters thing a lot better.    <br>And nothing of value was lost.</br>  <br>I just think it's funny how he was the one to get fucked for a change. I like to think it made life for Mitsuki and Haruka better.</br>  <br>Hayase never getting into swimming, Haruka having legs broken and both drafted into army to fight aliens that are constantly killing everybody you love and care for.<br>Dunno, their EXTRA life is pretty fucking comfy compared to that.<br> SFD has best route; no accidents and Hayase gets her man </br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't talking about extra thought. I'm strictly speaking of muv luv verse. They're better off not having to put up with Takayuki's shit on top of everything else there.</br>  <br>Didn't Hayase confide in Takeru that they were both pretty broken up about him and that they never really got over him even years later?</br>  <br>I think it was Munakata or Kazama who told him that.</br>  <br>Seeing Takayuki has no needless pressure put on him and no PTSD due to accident, he most likely is his jolly self with Shinji. Much like all other BETAverse versions, he would have his no-bullshit side and stronger constitution. He'd still like TSFs, he was pretty into Valgern-On. <br>We can't really say that they would have put up with his shit, when they are talking him in such a warm manner whenever he gets a passing mention. <br><br><br>Pretty much. BETAverse trio didn't manage to get that ever sorted out, and when Takayuki died everything was just there. They're friends, but both know they couldn't get him because of the other.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've got a rumbling ass, does that count?</br>  <br>My first anime NTR. Mitsuki sleeping with the guys best friend. WHAT.THE.FUCK.</br>  <br>I guess you missed the total nervous breakdown, alcohol, Shinji takinf advantage of her and how Takayuki was in hospital spending time with a girl from three years ago and basically telling her how she mattered jack shit.</br>  <br>If I had a wish, I'd wish that this could air today to see /a/ burn to the ground.<br><br>Jesus, imagine this airing in today's /a/. It'd be worse than Guilty Crown, Vaverape, Yahari, etc. This shitposting would make most other shows' threads look like proper discussion.</br></br></br>  <br>Watch what you are wishing for, anon.</br>  <br>Did you see the threads for the first two episodes of Death Parade? It would be like that, only ten times worse.</br>  Mitsuki route is canon  <br>Oh please yes.</br>  Bakayuki is such a faggot.  Well, thanks, guys.I was really buttmad when Takayuki choose Mitsuki.I'm just a filthy secondary after all.  Mitsuki best girl.<br><br> the VN will never be translated </br></br>    <br>Watch it, then watch the randumb akane side story, then read the muv-luv trilogy and then watch the akane sidestory again.</br>  <br>You mean Akane Maniax? It's really great how well it connects KGNE and Muv-Luv. It's even more amazing that Extra starts with Takeru and Sumika wondering where the hell Gouda went.</br>  <br>Really loved her in the novel.</br>  <br>Yes, Akane Maniax, it's great context for the whole experience.</br>  <br>And it's the only anime featuring the Muv-Luv main cast.</br>  Here's a really bad rip-off of this that I wrote for a short paper.<br><br>https://www.dropbox.com/s/5vvde31f4<wbr>e6y4a3/Kimo%20ga%20Nozomu%20AP%20En<wbr>glish.docx?dl=0</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>This is funny since I ripped off Narcissu for my English final in high school</br>  <br>Post where?</br>  <br><br>White album 2 took it and did it a million times better.</br></br>  <br>Mitsuki did nothing wrong.</br>  <br>You have that backwards.</br>  <br>Will we ever get Day Zero VN ?<br>Well after MLA, I reach the conclusion that every single harem/romcom protagonist will automatically become better by dropping them in BETAverse.</br></br>    <br> Well after MLA, I reach the conclusion that every single harem/romcom protagonist will automatically become better by dropping them in BETAverse. <br>Well, two things can happen which really come out benefitially to us:<br>1)they get better<br>2)get turned into Soldier class</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Seriously fuck Takayuki, if he just moved on.

Anyone have a copy of it?  That fucking ending when you make Hayase your sex slave. My dick. <br><br><br>I know, I was trying to ruse people.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope you followed all the symbolism that was going on. Nobody was doing anything right in that moment. Haruka was being fooled, her stealing the love of that was clearly about to bloom between Takayuki and Hayase and continuing to lie her about her core reasons and feelings, Takayuki was practically ignoring Hayase to the point of pic related, Shinji being an asshole and Hayase cracking down to itty bitty pieces. <br>Everybody is doing something wrong at that period in the story, and the heavy handed symbolism depicts this. <br>If you want to get to the core of it, Haruka should have encouraged Hayase to go forth with her feelings towards Takayuki rather than force her own wantings in there over Hayase. There's a reason Shinji says it always had to be Takayuki for Hayase and why he never could move forwards with his feelings.</br></br></br>  <br> planning on slutting it up with a bunch of random guys <br> saved [...] from a gangbang </br></br>  <br>I want to make Mitsuki my sex slave.<br><br>I'd love her more than Bakayuki, though that isn't saying much.</br></br></br>  I wish i could forget this show.      <br>MASTERPIECE.<br><br>It was the first anime in history that split the fanbase into 2 large raging groups coming at each other everyday.<br>There were even arguments coming from nipland, it was fucking glorious.<br><br>Present /a/'s shitpost storm is nothing compared to this shit back in the days.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't Bakayuki just evacuate?</br>  <br>Wait a second, what is this?

Everything would have been fine but the Best Friend had to sleep with Hayase and then Punch the Current Boyfriend ? Jesus Christ that was the worst. In all honesty. Not only did he sleep with her but he made it sound like he was on the right and to make matters worse he punched the one he NTR'd.

If anything, here's to hoping she gets a route in the new visual novel.</br>  What an underwhelming final episode.  <br> here's to hoping she gets a route in the new visual novel. <br>How the hell would that even work?

No one ever would talk this cryptic and fucked up to his friends. After Yui's speech everyone would go "what the fuck are you playing at, mate?". But instead we have some forced drama with deep hidden meanings and tears all over the place.  Do people like Commie just because they're fast? IWhat's wrong with HS?  <br>Fuck you she didn't actually give us one of those in the episode and it broke my heart.</br>  <br>Literally nothing.

And if it weren't for the three of them finally opening up to each other, he'd never have realized that there was something genuine that he really wanted.</br>  <br>Who care, Yui literally beat Yukinon at the end of the episode.<br> that fireworks flashback <br> that cookie man flashback <br> that yukinon dependency <br> 8man telling her to solve her problem herself <br><br>All these foreshadowing</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because this anime would be actually enjoyable if it had at least some sense of realism in the characters. 12 episodes were literally nothing happens except for scripted dialogs.

I disagree with  →<br><br>Yui doesn't want them to go back to the awkward status quo. She legitimately declared her intention to take 8man for herself.

What are you doing Watari  <br>You need to learn to not get invested into anything and remain a cold shallow husk of a person. That way you can avoid getting hurt.</br>  Could we agree that S1 was way better in all aspects?  <br>This is probably the first fiction that I read where the main heroine keep getting worse and worse.<br>To think that she was the best girl in S1. Can you even redeem her anymore?</br></br>  What the fuck is even going on? I guess some shit would probably make more sense had I re-watched the first season before the second season began but why are these high school students perpetually talking in riddles?  <br>Except visuals, yes.</br>  <br>Don't listen to that fag, he's obviously wrong. Mine are the correct posts.</br>  <br>2D will never love you anyway.</br>  yui would be shit and akward<br><br>she doesn't even speak to hiki in class, hiki would never join her circle of non-genuine friends, <br>yuki however is a loner loser with no friends so she and hiki would fit perfectly together</br></br></br>  And what the fuck was this ending, I hope it's because they know there is a s3 around.<br><br><br>Yes.</br></br></br>  <br>Hayama x Yui confirmed</br>  <br>At the very very end of the episode and LN you can see a light at the end of the tunnel with regards to Yukino<br><br>My question os whether itll be enough. Like holy shit Watari what did you do to her</br></br></br>  <br> 8man telling her to solve her problem herself <br><br> implying that's not 8man genuinely caring for yukino <br><br>he won't let her give up. that's what happened. yui tried to pull off a gambit, trying to pressure yukino into conceeding because she's being pressured by haruno as well. but 8man wants her to live up to the strong girl he knows she can be.<br><br>capcha related.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree with you, but both proposed scenarios state that Yui intended for 8man to shoot her down. Why would she want him to do so? Can anyone elaborate?</br>  <br>Nah, it was 5/10. This season was at least 7/10.<br><br>No other anime had me on the edge of my seat for literally nothing happening for 13 episodes.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Wait, she did WHAT?<br>And 8man, get your eyes off of her for a second, jesus.<br><br>Are these for real?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>get off of 4chan s1 hikki</br>  <br>8man starts confronting her on her bitch ways. She's never gonna get with Hayama anyways.<br>Might as well have an onaie master type end for that route.<br><br>Than again she isn't even a yankee.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You were just excited to shitpost about new developments.</br>  <br>She is hinting that she wishes Yukino and Yui were fighting back like Yumiko. Then she hands him some cookies asks him not to tell anyone about it. <br>Nothing special, nope.</br></br>  <br> feel downplaying that entire scene <br> feel are irohafags they said <br> feel are yuifags they said <br><br>Delusional. All of you retards.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not even browsing /a/ except for season beginnings and finals.</br>  Yukinoshita Yukino.<br><br>Is this the most well written character of all time?</br></br>  <br> Now I'm stuck with those weeabo losers on /a/ with all their shitty theories. <br><br> implying you wouldn't miss our company <br><br>tsundere is so 2007, anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sha~</br>  <br> She legitimately declared her intention to take 8man for herself. <br><br>You are wrong, Yui's whole plan from the beginning was to have 8man step up and reject her obviously bad plan.<br><br>She did an old 8man ploy that she knew the new Genuine 8man would decline.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think you're confusing Yui with Shizuka.<br>Yui hasn't done much besides dragging him around on shitty dates.<br>Yukino still has very little development.<br>No one has really opened up yet, that's why there's a problem in the first place.<br><br><br>Mutual disarmament, unless Yui actually expected 8man's refusal and not just going "haha i was only pretending to be retarded"<br>Then it'd be Yui trying to force 8man's and Yukino's hand to confess, so that she could also confess.<br>The service club would break up or lose one member at that point, thus it'd be their last and final request.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why does she make the sound sha?</br>  <br><br>The whole plan was purposely meant to be turned down, Yui has no real intentions to "block" Yukino from pursuing 8man.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Nah I've read the LN.<br><br>It's definitely </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's because Yui either pities or respects Yukino. She wasn't actually going for the kill, she just wanted to make a real threat to get them out of the love triangle quagmire. Yui wants a fair fight. Think about it. She backs off to let Yukino give Hiki the cookies, but Yukino spergs out. Then Yui blows her date promise to bring Yukino along to deliberately sabotage her own confession. When Yukino is about to back off, asking if she's a third wheel, who brings her back in?</br>  <br>That makes no sense. If she intended for 8man to reject her plan then they return to the non-genuine awkward shithole they've been wallowing in.</br>  <br>Basically because her proposal was her "one answer" and she knew it was wrong because it demanded they ignore their feelings. But in additon to that, she knows 8man. She knows he'd never accept it and she trusted that somehow, he'd have the words that would set them on the right path again.</br>  <br>When I watched S1 for the first time, I was struck by how incredibly bizarre it was.<br>I was expecting an actual romcom under the guise of of not being a romcom, and I got bizarro.<br><br>I expected the same out of S2, and I got based Hayato and actual romance.<br><br>I think I liked S1 way better because the ending wasn't begging for money.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm gonna quit being an abnormalfag now after witnessing how many people self-insert into hachiman. If it means to be autistic and retarded I won't do it.</br>  <br>It's easier to understand if you read the novels but I'm also wondering when the conscious decision to write so cryptically happened.</br>   wanted Yukino be win <br> watched her character degenerate into a cracked mirror and a doormat <br><br> wanted Hachiman to win <br> watched him become a complete GENUINE retard who has no idea what he is talking about <br><br> wanted Yui to be happy <br> completely impossible now with the shithole they've all dug themselves into <br><br>I'm done, I can't do this anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nah I've read the LN. <br>You say that like it means anything.</br></br>  <br><br><br>You fucking cocksucking horny teens.<br>WATARIIIIII, what are you doing??</br></br></br></br>  I liked S2 of Ore no imouto and S2 of this better.  What did he say?  <br>sha~</br>  I was just like what the fuck am I even reading the whole episode.  <br>You are right. I also read the light novel.</br>  <br>IROHA OR DEATH</br>  <br>If they mutually disarm, they get nowhere. They still remain in the awkward love triangle.</br>  <br>Truly the highlight of this final episode.</br>  Why the fuck would anyone read the LN? Might as well read trash like 50 shades of grey.  GUYS<br><br>8man is a "nice guy".<br><br>Do you think he'll finally realize he's been stringing along Yui too long?</br></br></br></br>  <br>is than sena</br>  I wanted Yui to win but she's just such a bitch now. She's become the villain somehow. What the fuck. Oh my god THE STONE TABLETS SPOKE THE TRUTH, IT'S ALL REAL<br><br>FUUUUUUUUUUUCK</br></br>  <br>I like this explanation. Are you the one who posted<br> <br> <br><br>?</br></br></br></br></br>   Yukino turns from a strong and independent character into a doormat with dependency issues out of nowhere and drags everyone into her black hole of self-hatred and suffering <br><br> 8man goes from a jaded teenager into some retard afraid to do anything because he's searching for genuine, which even he doesn't know what it is <br><br> Yui goes from a dumb bimbo into someone who is cleverly trying to push the group to a point where they can talk about the elephant in the room (yukino) and is able to understand 8man better than Yukino ever could <br><br>What's wrong with watari? Everything is making no sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nyaa~ Sha~ <br> so KAWAII DESU <br><br>literally useless moeblob</br></br></br></br>  <br>The proposal was a mutual disarmament one, but Yui wanted Hachiman to shoot it down. That was her goal,</br>  <br><br> Iroha literally blows 8man in a supply closet in Vol11 <br> FEEL cuts it <br><br>FEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEL</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Author approved it, don't bother him about it.</br>  <br> If they mutually disarm, they get nowhere. They still remain in the awkward love triangle. <br><br>Listen<br><br>That's the proposal Yui made that she KNEW was going to be turned down for the exact reason you just stated.<br><br>Understand?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>MY DICK</br></br></br>  <br>Mutually disarm is good because the cat is out of the bag and now they can slowly work towards something. Otherwise yukinoshit and 8man would continue to ignore the problem until it escalates and one of them breaks. Yui is smart enough to not let it get to that point.</br>  <br><br>Why was this spoiler so late?<br>Is it legit? Why isn't anyone talking about it earlier?</br></br></br>  Why does everyone want Hachiman now? I thought he was some creepy depressing fuck  <br><br><br><br>You guys can stop pretending now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off false flagger.</br>  <br><br>Yui and Yukino needs to switch now.</br></br>  What causes yukinons autism? Was she dropped on her head as a child  I think my main problem with this show is the damn monologues apply to too many aspects and issues within the characters at once so you have to play the guessing game which is being problem is being referred to. <br><br>Also, fuck that ending, 2 years for fucking buy the very last LN is some serious bullshit.</br></br>  <br>Yes, I get that but that's the equivalent of saying Yui is okay with things staying the way they are (a fake status quo much like Hayama's group)</br>  <br>And? I could dump the whole saika 8man interraction then the thread would hit the bump limit. Does that mean saika will win the 8inch? No he won't. <br><br>Now go fuck yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>Being born after Haruno.</br>  <br> &gt;Yui goes from a dumb bimbo into someone who is cleverly trying to push the group to a point where they can talk about the elephant in the room (yukino) and is able to understand 8man better than Yukino ever could <br><br>This was developed all throughout season 2.<br><br>Ebina fake confession scene<br><br>episode 4 end scene<br><br>episode 5 scene with Yui grooming 8man's hair.<br><br>She understands him better than anyone else, save for Sensei perhaps.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretending? Nigga she just handed him some cookies while he just went full dere dere for her again.<br><br>I'm pissed, you can fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br> No he won't. <br>Hachiman just lead him on again and again.</br></br>  <br>Vaccinations.</br>  <br>Yui's always wanted the 8man from the start.<br><br>Yukino has like no other human contact and learned how reliable and nice he can be.<br><br>Iroha is there because there needs to be jealousy as a catalyst.<br><br>Orimoto is a typical female animal who sees that the male she rejected is now desired by many other superior female specimens, and her primitive brain is telling her that what is desired by those superior females is now desirable to her as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yui goes from a dumb bimbo <br>No, her dumb is never potrayed as something negative for her so far, she is just being Yui even in this episode, she doesn't really change.</br></br>  <br>Yukino is depressing fuck too</br>  <br><br>You don't understand, for 8man to turn that plan down, which would be a forced status quo, he needs to outright say he doesn't want it.<br><br>Yui's plan succeeded. Everyone can now move forward.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why did Yui wait a year to Yahallo 8man?<br>Why did Yukino stop acting like a cunt to 8man when Haruno shows up?<br>Why do they keep following around 8man when he's doing grunt work for Iroha?<br><br>Men become more valuable to women when other women are after him.<br>Slap a ring on him and who wouldn't be able to beat them off with a stick.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Has Iroha seen Hachiman at his worse like everyone else already?  <br> Orimoto is a typical female animal who sees that the male she rejected is now desired by many other superior female specimens, and her primitive brain is telling her that what is desired by those superior females is now desirable to her as well. <br>Fucking kek. You have my laugh for the night.</br></br>  <br>Sensei has offered 8man guidance, but has done nothing to get him out of his shell.<br><br>Yui constantly pulled 8man and Yukino out of their comfort zones. Her silly conversations and occasional skinship were the spark of real companionship that made it so the two of them didn't feel alone anymore.<br><br> Yui hasn't done much besides dragging him around on shitty dates. <br> Yukino still has very little development. <br><br>Part of me can't believe I'm actually responding to a shitposter this obvious but I didn't read anything past your first line until I had half my post typed up.<br><br>At least you're half right on the last point- Yui has been open about her feelings, she just hasn't been DIRECT with them, because she knows pushing them on 8man would just scare him away. Yukino has opened up as much as she can which, given her issues isn't a whole lot. "Help me someday" was a huge moment of growth for her, though it seems like she's plateaued since then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Orimoto is the only girl who doesn't want to fuck him.</br>   commie seeing who is still watching the OP   <br>No, and that's why she's digging him so hard. She hasn't seen him at his worst, but she likes what she's seen.</br>  Yui won.  <br>What do you mean?<br>When he was a loner or when he was doing his genuine shit?<br>If you mean 8man throwing himself to the grinder for Sagami and Ebina, then no.</br></br></br>   Season 2 ends of a cliffhanger <br> "BUY THE LN FAGGOTS" -Watari Wataru <br> LN ends the exact same way <br><br>God fucking dammit Watari.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He's smart, see's through bullshit, hold's his own, and calls out others who at first glance would seem above his punching power(Hayama), and is relatively fashionable and attractive. <br><br>He's basically an stealth alpha once you get to know him.</br></br></br></br>  <br> try google searching for verification <br> error 400: you've made an illegal request <br><br>What the fuck /a/</br></br></br></br>  <br> exiting the entrance </br>  commie or horrible subs?  <br><br> PRAISE THE SUN! </br></br>  <br>I just want to see how they use they weapons and mutually destroy eachother. The tension must be released at once.   then in the moment of total desperation, Iroha comes and saves everything. </br>  <br>Isn't a Light Novel supposed to be light to read? What with this cryptic shit writing?</br>  <br>Well, a part of her was okay with it, but she knew that it was wrong to think that way.</br>  <br> comemes </br>  Someone tell me how to solve Yukino problem? you know her sister and mom are like that  lel  People have been referencing these three posts: <br><br>I don't see how they actually differ?<br><br>It seems that in both proposed scenarios Yui wants 8man to turn her down.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh god I want to hold him and comfort him.<br><br> Then tear his ass in two until he starts crying again... Jesus that makes me a BL seme. </br></br></br>  <br>Remember the way he used to get her elected?</br>  REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</wbr>  <br><br><br>In retrospect I think this show might have been better if their was some superpower/supernatural element to it with the way 8man acts, it would make up for some of the teen angst shit that makes up 90% of the show.</br></br></br>  <br> Yui  <br> Not a silly bimbo <br><br>Yui fag detected.</br></br></br></br>  <br>for once they actually gave me a good kek</br>  <br><br>I can't find shit for verification through google or 2ch, but then I can't even read japanese.</br></br>  <br>Is Yui secretly a /v/?<br>What's with all the dork souls references she made.</br></br>  Yui has some balls pretending that she is even a viable candidate to win the contest. She's solved no problems.  <br>The only thing S2 has over S1 is Iroha. S1 wins.</br>  Do I even want to see this open ending because FEEL is too pussy to make Yukino win.  <br>Yes, in both scenarios Yui does indeed intend for 8man to shoot her down.<br><br>However, they differ in that one guy is saying Yui actually confessed for the sake of claiming 8man.<br><br>While the other guy is saying that Yui confessed for the sake of pulling them back to square 1 (back when no one had made a move on 8man)<br>At least this is what I think. I may be wrong?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  She's basically an upgraded Yui. FInally found the best girl of the show.  <br>She might not win the war but she won S2 by landslide. Yukino stock has never been lower.<br>She is even more unlikable than the Yukino during the stuco election. Can people still like her even after reading the latest vol?</br></br>  <br><br>Middle option takes the position Yui has no intention of ever actually following through with her proposal, as it's designed to be turned down by 8man, and reject everything it stands for, thus rejecting the stalemate, and confronting their issues head on.<br><br>She could never do something that awful to Yukino, Yui nearly loves her as much as she loves 8man. Unless she's bi then hot damn, let the doujins flow.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You may be onto something.<br><br> Humanity <br> Praise the Sun <br> End of the episode is Yui telling Yukino to   GIT GUD </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course. She knew she was going to lose from the start, but still remains determined. Remember her bid for student council president? This time, though, we know that she expected 8man to step in.</br>  <br>Episode 13 made Yukino look like a fucking robot.<br>Or an emotionless cold tuna.</br></br>  <br>Upgraded non-shit Yui.</br>  How do I find something genuine, /a/?  <br>cant wait for doujin of yui getting cucked by her momma</br>  <br>I got your genuine right here.<br><br>*unzips dick*</br></br></br>   last volume <br> yukino finally get over her problems with the others helps <br> time for 8man to choose <br> yui thinking she will lose exit the room to give them both the space <br> 8man wanted to chase after her but doesn't have the courage <br> "and why are you still here ?" <br> "b-but" <br> "go and get her" <br> 8man chases after her <br> 8man finally found her with zaimokuza,saika,etc helps <br> "hikki, what are you doing here ? are you supposed to be with the one you love" <br> pic related <br><br>SAGASHI NI YUKUUNDA SO KOEEEEE</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So who's gonna take the 8man D first in the inevitable 3 some?  <br>Forgot where but I think it was stated in the LN that she plays puyo puyo and harvest moon.<br><br>She definitely has disney tsum tsum in her phone.</br></br></br>  <br>Can confirm those are legit, give me a minute to edit the raw pages in just one pic.<br><br>Watari is pushing Iroha x 8man so hard, incredible.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought it made her look look like a helpless child. Or a retard.<br><br>The way she looks like a deer in headlights when Yui tries to egg her on to giving 8man her cookies, Jesus.</br></br></br>  <br>Dyed hair is genetic</br>  <br>Shit thanks man. That works a hell of a lot better than my pile of words when I posted the pic in the other thread.</br>  <br>By being yourself. :^)</br>  <br>Read 2ch they don't say anything negative about Yukino, they are well aware that Watari is doing more effort with her character. They are discussing how to help her instead of hating her like /a/ do?</br>  <br><br><br><br>It's legit, from pages 193 and 194 of the LN.<br><br>Iroha had another scene that never even got put into the anime. Not that I can read it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They broke Yukino's shell, only to find out there was nothing there.</br>  <br><br> plays the vidya <br> praises the sun <br> uses epin maymays </br></br></br></br>  Whats going to happen to Fishygaya  I don't even really understand why Yukino has to be attracted to 8man at all. What does that actually have to do with her problems? Wouldn't she be fine if she just had friends she could rely on?<br><br>This love triangle shit annoys me when it feels like Yui's entire angle from the start was about romance, but nothing in Yukino's arc has anything to do with love.</br></br>  <br>Who would have thought that her tough girl facade is the one everyone like while her real self is shit.</br>  In all seriousness, how well would Yukino handle it if she finds out 8man is cheating on her with Yui? Would Yukino shrug it off or would she take it badly?<br><br>This is if Yukino is in love with 8man btw. <br><br>Also, you guys should be able to solve this problem in the pic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yui first, because Yukino would want to ride 8man's face for a while, and it's kinda rude to make a man suck his own baby batter out of you like that.</br>  <br> All throughout the story Yui is the one trying to help Yukino and befriend her <br> At the end, Yukino is the one to help Yui for the first time  <br><br>It's so poetic that I know Watari won't do it because he's a terrible writer.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope they are laughing at her and calling her コピペのん (Copypaste-non)</br>  <br><br>8man took alot of what Shizuka said to him to heart.<br>Can't remember any of it, but he has mimicked other things she pointed out to him and forgot where he heard it from.<br>He's been the most honest with her and Haruno despite all the silly bear nonsense.<br><br>Being pulled out of your comfort zone doesn't mean much, unless you get something out of it. 8man got nothing. He just doesn't have much chemistry with Yui and wants to keep her at arms length because he doesn't want to lead her on.<br><br>Her skinship is more akin to her wanting a relationship rather than companionship. Those are things you do to make someone like you. It's like she's playing AA2, get enough dates, head pats, and talk about love enough the other person will eventually confess, even if most of those interactions failed. She's doing it for herself and not for 8man's own benefit.<br><br>In Iroha's case she acts sly because she knows 8man likes it and he plays along. That can go either way into companionship or a relationship.<br><br>Her being direct wouldn't scare him away, she knows she would be friendzoned. She knows she doesn't have nearly enough points.<br><br>Yukino has only "opened up" about shit she knew that 8man already figured out for himself. "HELP ME someday" gee I wonder where copypastenon got that from?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> He's smart <br>I mean he's above average seeing as how he's in an acceptable school and seems to be on track to graduate without any issues, but that's about it.<br>The real defining factor of 8man's character is that he's a selfless loner. He puts other people's happiness before his own and always has a cynical view about things.<br>He has messed up many times in trying to fulfill people's requests and that has hurt himself as well as the people close to him.<br><br> see's through bullshit <br>Not as well as you might think. It's more that he isn't afraid to call people out on it. This ties in with the problem I just mentioned. He also idealized Yukino until he was faced with the truth that he was wrong all along. Hence the "I hate myself" monologue.<br><br> hold's his own <br>Yep, that's another one of his defining characteristics. He's quite fearless in very particular situations.<br><br> calls out others who at first glance would seem above his punching power(Hayama) <br>He only really does this when he's trying to help though. Hayama was never a bad person so making him out to be a villain to be challenged isn't accurate.<br><br> relatively fashionable and attractive <br>He has decent looks aside from the fish eyes. But hey, if fish eyes are you thing then it's no big deal.<br><br> He's basically an stealth alpha once you get to know him. <br>8man isn't a social creature at all. He lets people insult him, to his face sometimes, and he's considered a weirdo by most people. I don't think you know what alpha means.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I cringed. She's all "DON'T BAIL ON ME, YUIGAHAMA NONONONONONO" at that moment.</br>   Yui did everything right <br> she will lose <br> Yukino just cries about her problems and acts deredere <br> she will win <br>Why is this okay?</br></br></br></br>  <br> She's solved no problems. <br><br>Did you not just see the intended outcome she designed?</br></br></br>  <br><br> 「……他の人には内緒ですよ？」 <br> 昔の俺なら一瞬で即落ちだったよ、今の？ <br><br>Tell me this is real and not just some fake spoilers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yukino would either break or go 110% Haruno and just destroy them.</br>  <br> This time 8man won't wait, he will chase instead. </br>  <br> laughing <br> hating </br></br>  <br><br>Confirmed, pic related<br><br>Verification for you guys.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Honestly, if Iroha doesn't at least confess next volume, Watari is a massive hack.<br>These new spoilers are ridiculous, 8man is full dere dere / muh dick for Iroha.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One anon suggested that Yukino is merely copying Yui's love for 8man, but doesn't know what to do with it. I'm unsure if Yukino's feelings are genuine at all.</br>  <br>I Fucking hate it how the terms alpha and beta have not only been appropriated by Internet retards, but that they don't even make sense anymore. <br><br>An alpha is someone who has no social circles and let's himself get walked all over? What?</br></br></br>    <br> Yukino just cries about her problems and acts deredere <br> she will win <br>Yukino is fake as shit. Why would she win when Yui is shown to be the most genuine girl right now?</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for making me regret trying to put any thought into your posts, anon.<br><br>Have an Iroha trying in vain to measure up to Yui for besting me.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yui, with no protection, on a dangerous day.</br></br>  Commie pls do the blurays.  <br>sha~</br>  Reading this thread only made me more confused.<br><br>From what I've gathered, are there two schools of thought?<br><br>(1) Yui confessed with the intent to claim Hachiman for herself, yet knew 8man would reject her. Can someone explain why she would do this? Doesn't make sense to me.<br><br>(2) Yui confessed with the intent to "mutually disarm" and revert everything back to normal. This sort of makes sense, since as another /a/non mentioned, 8man would reject the status quo and force everyone, notably Yukino, to move forward.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That'd be interesting. I never considered that kind of angle. Seems to somber for this story, but in a way, it would make sense.<br><br>I don't think that's how it's going to end up, but I'd have a lot of respect for the story going that direction, with Yukino maybe realizing that she doesn't actually need or want a relationship when she's still got so many of her own issues to sort out.</br></br></br>  <br>Fake</br>  <br>While YY had their drama moments, Iroha managed to get not one, but two scenes. How can you tease us like this, Watari?</br>  <br>How does it compare to the spoon scene?</br>  <br><br>Hello Alone Yukino Ballad<br><br>A tear will roll down her cheek, but she'll be standing tall, with anime smug girl face, while Haruno is opposite her losing her cool.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xaT<wbr>znrAN6t8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't really understand how Watari can handle every other character fine, but go full retard with Yukino's. What the fuck is he thinking?</br>  <br><br>Yukino is doing exactly what she did with Hayama, you're supposed to think exactly what you're thinking.</br></br>  <br>She did more than anyone for the club itself but as far as requests go, 8man easily wins the contest. Sensei will also likely give him the win since she favors him.</br>  Ok, I'm rewatching the final scene and giving a play-by-play so we can properly decipher it.<br><br> Yui says she wants to figure out what's next with her, Yukino, and 8man <br> Yui looks into the eyes of Yukino angrily and her fists start shaking and lips start trembling <br><br>Declaration of war, about to do something that takes courage.<br><br> Yui gives cookies to 8man while not making eye contact with him with a shy look in her eyes while running up, solid eye contact and confidence while talking to him afterwards <br> Yukino feels her heart rip in two and touches her bag knowing she fucked up by not giving 8man his cookies back in front of the school <br> Yukino then shakes her head to rid herself of that memory (?) while still looking stressfully at the exchange between Yui and 8man before looking away <br> Yui says "remember my request?" referring to her first request of the club, to make cookies for someone <br> Yukino chimes in with "tezukuri cookies," providing a different meaning to the cookies other than fulfilling the request <br> "You're amazing, Yuigahama" blatant double meaning, doesn't need explaining <br> Next few lines are just Yui re-affirming her confenssions to 8man in a round-about way <br> Yui: "I want it all. What we have now, and what we'll have in the future. I'm a coward. I play dirty." <br><br>She wants everything. She's selfish. She wants 8man as a bf and Yukino as a bff.<br><br> Yui: "But I've made up my mind." Yukino suddently looks dejected. <br> Yui: "If we figure out how each of us feels, I don't think we'll be able to stay the same." <br><br>Basically just the status quo argument from Tobe's request. When feelings and love and everything get involved, friendships and relationships crumble.<br><br> Yui does her "final task, final request" thing, which is to fix their problems <br> Yui brings up the battle between the club where whoever helps the most people gets to order the loser to do whatever they want <br><br>Continued...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   It's okay when Yui does it  <br><br>WTF I though Yui's ship already sunk, but now it Yuifags turned into submarine.</br></br>  <br> Yui says she can solve the problem Yukino is facing, and how this solution will solve the club's problems too <br><br>This right here says Yui is wrong because the whole plotline of Yukino to stop depending on people will just continue to be perpetuated if she goes through with this.<br><br> Yui says by doing this, she will win the battle <br> 8man starts his internal monologue about she didn't specify anything and everything is all vague, and if she would put it into words it would confirm everything, but Yui is purposefully avoiding doing that <br> Yui says it might not be fair, but this is all she could think of to keep the status quo the same and keep the three of them "this way forever" <br><br>Going back to what we learned from the Tobe request, maintaining the status quo when romantic feelings are involved means not confessing and/or staying friends without letting the romantic feelings get in the way. This goes against what the series has been preaching for the three of them though, with all the talk of being "genuine" and stuff.<br><br> Yui asks what they think of that <br> 8man starts another internal monologue about how Yui was probably searching for the right answers to all the problems while Yukino and 8man go be autists, and how accepting her proposal would make things easier <br> Yui walks up to Yukino, grabs her hand, and asks "are you okay with that, Yukinon?" <br><br>She's laying into Yukino. She's forcing her to make a move. She's asking her in no uncertain terms "are you okay with letting the status quo remain? are you okay with not discovering and announcing your feelings?"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Being this much of an autist </br>  Best girl is  Sensei   <br>What<br>the<br>fuck<br>is<br>this<br>shit<br>watari</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What a waste of time this season was.  <br> Yui and Yukino look into each other's eyes with that glimmering "omg they're going to cry" anime eye effect and Yukino is obviously taken aback and doesn't want to go with Yui's request of maintaining the status quo <br> Yukino starts to answer and mumbles out a "watashi wa..." in a broken voice <br> Yukino then starts to answer with a more facially confident "watashi wa..." (smiling, etc.) but her voice is still noticably wavering and broken <br><br>This means that her first "watashi wa" was her thinking about what she really wanted vs. what was "best" for the club (aka Yui's suggestion). The second one was her begrudgingly succumbing to Yui's suggestion and being ready to give up everything.<br><br> Yui realizes this, and now has a look of disappointment in her eyes <br> All throughout this exchange, 8man started another internal monologue about how Yui was wrong, and her suggestion is bullshit and does nothing to further Yukino's independence as it will leave her future, again, in someone else's hands <br> Yukino takes one last gasp of air before making her declaration of being ok with Yui's suggestion while Yui looks on with a noticeable look of disgust <br> Yukino starts saying "I wouldn't mind-" with pain and tears in her voice, saying that she'd accept Yui's proposal, but it obviously isn't what she really wants <br><br>Yukino not being genuine, again.<br><br> 8man speaks up and saves the day <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127233043#p127242772">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I go with (1)<br>Yui is tired of all of them acting like superficial friends.

It allows continuous Überfication since it restores the body from the damage caused by it.<br><br>Hopefully the game will expand upon Überfying further. There are a lot of scenarios which should be expanded upon, but I feel that the anime did a good job as well, even if we don't have encyclopedic knowledge of everything it introduced.
