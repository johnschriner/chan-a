Kancolle is only about the money there is hardly any heart in it. They put a few references here and there just to make the stupid fans more loyal and real in more $, But its not like strike witches where everything is a reference AND a tribute to real heroes. Kancolle has virtually no honor embedded in it which would actually mean more than you think considering how both SW and KC are set in WW2 where combat was centered around honor. Think about that for a sec please.  <br>The shit ones.</br>  <br><br>You'd think that someone would fall for your shitty bait. Think before you post, retard.</br></br>  <br>But I like both.</br>    <br>Someone will actually bite this shit for real.</br>  <br>enjoy your reply<br> Reply </br></br>  <br>I really wanna sock smugbono in the face</br>  <br>1/10, I replied. Apply yourself.</br>  <br>That's no bueno.</br>  <br>Amen</br>  <br>What? Its seriously not bait dude I have a point you have to admit.<br><br><br>okay so you like it even though you know how it copied everything from SW it stole the concept just to make money. Theres as much honor in that as there is in double-crossing which is what you are actually doing by supporting both. <br><br><br>its not bait dude okay seriously i dont know why everyone is calling it bait. Im just a strike witch fan in a kancolle thread speaking my mind,</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nagato/Musashi <br>More like Kongou</br></br>  <br>Zuikaku or Shoukaku on both, probably, since her engine is more powerful than Yamato's.</br>  <br>Is it shiptoasting time?</br>  <br>Nagato</br>  <br>You're not trying hard enough, seriously. Are you this bitter that your SW threads have always been dead and pure circlejerk that you have to shitpost here?</br>    <br>shut the fuck up dude your are so fucking annoying its like you say the same shit over and over again in every thread</br>  <br>Kaga would lose to Zuikaku, Zuikaku has more horse power to back her up. She's stronger and faster than Kaga.</br>  <br> combat about honor <br> killing all jews <br> japs killing themselves <br> nanking <br> nukes </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yesyesyesyes</br>  <br>What does Bismarck's sweat taste like?</br>  <br>Yeah man, SW invented the mecha musume genre. Totally, there's nothing wrong with this logic.</br>  <br> Mogami-class has more HP than Yamato-class <br>damn</br></br>  <br> both SW and KC are set in WW2 <br> Kancolle <br> taking place in WW2 <br> most of the ships are from WW1 and inter-war period </br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;killing all jews <br>If we had known about the world they were going to create, maybe the rest of us wouldn't have stopped Hitler...</br></br>  <br>Strength does not equal to Power though</br>  <br> KC are set in WW2 <br>This is next level bait. You can't even get a basic fact about the series right.</br></br>  <br>Fumikane seems to be fine with making boatbucks off boatshit anyhow.</br>  <br/>  <br><br> small c </br></br>  <br>no im not bitter im just speaking my mind <br><br><br>dude okay im talking about sorties in air combat compared to in ships. in ships yeah you pretty much know whats gunna happen its either you see an enemy ship and you shoot everything you have at him and one sinks first or you dont see him at all . In air combat you never know what you will have to do to complete your mission. You can get jumped by like 20 enemies from above, or you can jump another enemy and every plane is different handling and speed. You might get his but still survive only to be shot down by flak later like the possibilities are endless so you need nerves of steel to be a pilot. but what does it take to be a ship commander? common sense? basically yes.</br></br></br></br>  <br> pow·er <br> ˈpou(ə)r/ <br> noun <br> noun: power; plural noun: powers <br> 3. physical strength and force exerted by something or someone. <br><br> strength <br> streNG(k)TH/Submit <br> noun <br> 1. the quality or state of being strong, in particular. <br> physical power and energy. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone doesn't know shit about naval warfare.</br>  <br>He chose the perfect time to bait. I never see any moderation of this time of day.</br>  <br>That still has nothing to do with honor. <br>The jap pilots always killed themselves like fucking idiots tho.</br></br>  <br>The same could be said for most of us.</br>  <br>I think he means the ol' Knight of the Skies Air Force thing over the European theatre.<br><br>Which actually fucked up the Germans in World War I because said knights would immediately go and fight other fighters instead of taking down the entente artillery spotters that mattered on the ground.</br></br></br>  <br>At least most of us would know what to do in a night battle between a DD and a BB.</br>  <br>T-torpedo cut-in setup and star shell?</br>  <br>Yes, get within range and unleash torpedoes.</br>  <br>Hold hands and rub our bare feet against each other's feet for snuggling purposes?</br>  <br>Who's the worse protagonist: Mamoru or Bucky?</br>  <br>In either one, I use my radar to detect- oh wait, Japanese ships don't have radar. Guess it's time to turn on my searchlights or attack individually and hope for the best :^)</br>  <br>I want Corea to fuck off. I'm glad the abyss sunk the peninsula in the Vita.</br>  <br>Psst, there was no "honor" to air combat. Most kills occur when the one who was shot down had no idea the the one who shot them down was even there.</br>  <br>yeah exactly thats what i mean basically<br><br><br>also dude ur knowledge comes from an anime (that copied another anime) which i actually find that funny that you think you know more than me.<br><br>Well actually the thing is that SW at least teaches you more about how it actually was in ww2 air combat because its purely a direct alternate reality. But Kancolle started from a game so in order to set their gameplay mechanics they tweaked it to make it fun losing the realism element. and this is translated to the anime as well which is apparently where you get your knowledge from. In review which is more accurate, info an arcade mmo money-grab game? or A direct alternate reality of ww2.<br><br><br>they are both good characters actually.<br><br><br>thats just not true i mean u cant just sneak up to someone, escpecially not a trained pilot with good eyes and when its clear day and no clouds out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I like Kaga but feel bad because I'm a lanklet and probably wouldn't be able to pick her up in bed. If stand side by side she's thicker than me.  I can be your sister ship for tonight.  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/824563/87c36a<wbr>cf52/</wbr></br>  Cutest CV, followed by Taihou.  <br>I know that feel, anon. It doesn't help that my two boatfus (pic related) are both BBs and probably a lot stronger than me.</br>  <br> lanklet <br>Don't worry about that, living with Kaga will make you fat in no time.</br></br>  <br> more than one dude <br>Disgusting</br></br>  <br>Kaga is super cute</br>  <br>Did the artist forget to draw in the first pages or what?</br>  i am looking for a sad doujin that admiral tries to marry kongou but it doesn't ends well  <br> still not knowing kancolle takes place in moder times <br>Bait harder.</br></br>  Which Kamo would you kamo?  <br> swinging <br>I am disgusted</br></br>  <br>I'd kamo both of their faces.</br>  <br> SW at least teaches <br>SW teaches you nothing but planelegs with superpowers win war and shameless pantsu fanservice. In KC, you get an armada of ships in your arsenal: from CV, DD, SS, etc. unlike SW which Witches are the only ones who can fight Neuroi effectively. Also, please use your fucking caps and punctuation next time, retard.</br></br>  <br> Has the artist improved at all ever since he done these? </br>  <br>Be a man worthy of Kaga</br>  <br>Atago looks insane</br>  <br>You can't really blame Izuki Tazuku.</br>  <br>Yeah that craze eyes</br>  <br>You do know these ships had multiple admirals right? Swinging comes natural to them.</br>    <br>And this.</br>  <br>What kind of man is worthy of Kaga?</br>  <br><br> Those 2 with their imoutos never. <br><br>I hope the artist could grant my wish.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>i wanna to make takao and atago mothers.</br></br>  <br>There's something really wrong about Takao's torso here.<br><br>Same with Atago here.<br><br>This one looks really good, I guess torsos are really hard for him, otherwise they look really good, but Im worried that they are losing meat over time, not bueno.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I want Takao back.</br>  <br>The Arpeggio one is from when the anime was airing, they stopped being fat for that long you just don't know because they don't have a kai 2.</br>    <br>A strong man that will protect her from danger like me.</br>  <br>Why is he a holding a daki when she's right beside him</br>  <br>Imouto style miniskirts? No.<br>Medium turquoise clothing? Yes.</br></br>  <br>They always being curvy, with not that much belly extra meat.</br>  <br> thats just not true i mean u cant just sneak up to someone, escpecially not a trained pilot with good eyes and when its clear day and no clouds out. <br>You're retarded but I feel like educating you today. <br><br> Soon Erich had fully developed the tactics of air-fighting from which he would never subsequently depart. The magical four steps were: "See-Decide-Attack-Reverse, or 'Coffee Break.' "In lay terms, spot the enemy, decide if he can be attacked and surprised, attack him him and break away immediately after striking; or if he spots you before the strike, take a "coffee break" -wait- pull off the enemy and don't get into a turning battle with a foe who knows you are there. The rigid observance of this tactical sequence carried Erich Hartmann to the top. </br></br></br></br>  Shirinue.    <br>Not enough Kaga?</br>  <br><br><br>Its important to stay limber for torpedo cut ins.</br></br></br>  Is she a chuuni?  <br>No, just a obsolete CL.</br>  <br>yeah thats one guy that flew in one plane? what about the legit millions of OTHER pilots in different planes dumbass. You are the dumb one here. go ahead and act like you know anything and now let me educate YOU<br><br>Take Hans joachim Marsielle for example who actually had succes turn fighting hurricanes in west africa. The opposite basically than hartmann.<br><br> I often experience combat as it should be. I see myself in the middle of a British swarm, firing from every position and never getting caught. Our aircraft are basic elements, Stahlschmidt, which have got to be mastered. You've got to be able to shoot from any position. From left or right turns, out of a roll, on your back, whenever. Only this way can you develop your own particular tactics. Attack tactics, that the enemy simply cannot anticipate during the course of the battle – a series of unpredictable movements and actions, never the same, always stemming from the situation at hand. Only then can you plunge into the middle of an enemy swarm and blow it up from the inside. </br></br></br></br></br>  Prove to me that you aren't worthless piece of shit TTK.  <br>I have that poster.</br>  <br>Scan it then.</br>  <br>Because the daki has more personality than her.</br>    <br>I would prefer if someone scanned the Shirihime one tough.</br>  <br>Scan it</br>  RJ!  <br>Okay.</br>  <br>That just proves the opposite.</br>  <br> 1 medal <br>laughing ryuus.jpg</br></br>  Based TTK's.    <br> TTK's. </br>      <br><br><br>Some part of my know that it's not going to happen.

We're both only comparing 1 man to 1 man in a war that (as you said) involved many people, so lots start comparing groups.<br><br> The AVG was made up of three squadrons, The Adams &amp; Eves, The Panda Bears, and The Hell's Angels. They began combat operations on 20 December 1941 and officially disbanded on 4 July 1942. For seven months this ragtag band of Army, Navy, and Marine pilots were the only effective defense in the skies over China. Once organized, the men of the AVG recorded an unprecedented 70 to 1 kill ratio, 296 (although some sources say 286) enemy aircraft confirmed and an additional 153 probables for a loss of only 12 planes and 3 pilots in air combat. An even more impressive feat considering that the American mercenaries had virtually no combat experience while the Japanese had been fighting in China for years. <br><br> The tactics of The Flying Tigers were the key to its astounding record. The early warning net (a primitive yet effective network of spotters and ratio operators set up to report enemy aircraft) would report the position, direction, and estimated altitude of incoming Japanese aircraft. The Flying Tigers would climb above the enemies' altitude on an intercepting course. On sighting the Japanese they would dive on them at high speed and slash through their formation, guns blazing. After the attack the Tigers would use the speed from the dive to exit the combat zone and climb for another pass. It was essentially a drive-by shooting. <br><br>http://www.chuckhawks.com/p-40_vs_z<wbr>ero.htm<br><br>These tactics do not allow the enemy to fight back as they can in a dogfight. That is why they are so successful. Compare dogfighter planes vs energy fighters and energy comes out on top.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>How am I supposed to do the pantyhose challenge without a BB with one?<br>Also as long she stays with the pantyhose, she will be cute.</br></br></br>    <br> no one is attacking her pantyhose <br><br>shittaste</br></br></br>  <br>Both Hiei and Kirishima have pantyhose , unless you kai ni'd them.</br>  <br>Don't Kirishima and Hiei wear them?</br>  <br>I tought it was a perspective trick, maybe I should look harder next time, I gave in for the proto after so long in having them in kai, I feel dirty.</br>  <br>They're jealous of her kai2 uniform, she always had the pantyhose.</br>  <br> jealous <br> they're all smelling her <br> jealous </br></br></br>  http://blog.livedoor.jp/geek/archiv<wbr>es/51500931.html<br><br>scans of that fashion thing never</br></br></wbr>  <br>No<br><br>Title: Kaga lock<br>TTK: It's already morning...<br>TTK: It's rare that I actually woke up without help<br>TTK: Oh, Kaga is here to wake me up...<br>TTK: I'll try pranking her<br>TTK: If I just suddenly shout, that would be too normal.

The sound of her clothes dropped on the floor!!<br>TTK: Wait a sec, Kaga...!<br>Kaga: The rustling sound just now...<br>Kaga: Because I dropped my sash while trying to put it on...<br>TTK: Why are you doing that here!!!<br><br>Google "たすき掛け" and see pictures to understand this shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> starters without kai ni </br>  <br>Did you miss Bucky with already a kai ni trying to lift her skirt from behind?</br>  <br>Zuikaku was such a cute girl once.</br>  <br>I want to lift up Fubuki's skirt from behind and stuff my face into her pantsu.</br>  <br>Yes. Also after her kai ni, I would go for her beautiful hair too, before that it was always pantyhose.</br>   Taihou had a ton of armor <br> got sunk by one torpedo on her first battle <br><br>What a waste of money. Japs fucked up.</br></br></br>  <br>TTK: Oh...<br>TTK: This pork soup is really good<br>Ikazuchi: I know, right? I made that!<br>TTK: Ooh<br>TTK: Ikazuchi, you could become a good wife<br>Ikazuchi: No way, something like a wife is...<br>TTK: No no, this is really good<br>TTK: But to think if Ikazuchi would become a wife and go away... I would be crying at your wedding ceremony<br>Ikazuchi: Stupid commander! You don't understand a girl's heart at all!<br>Ikazuchi: I don't know you any more!<br>TTK: Hey Ikazuchi<br>Ikazuchi: Geez! It can't be helped!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You seem mad, thanks for the Kaga.</br>  <br> Japs <br>Fuck off gook, the correct term on this board is nips or elevens.</br></br>  <br>It sunk because of her damecon team, not the torp.</br>  <br>Who bucky?</br>  <br>I see Germans.</br>  <br>Kaga is such dutiful wife</br>  <br> Mad <br>Why? That was really not me<br><br>Akebono: I'm coming in, shitty admiral<br>Akebono: It's about the next expedition...<br>Akebono: Huh...?<br>Inazuma: Well... I'll leave it to Akebono-san!<br>Akebono: No, not about that<br>Akebono: You're not even hiding down there at all...<br>TTK: There's nothing down here<br>Akebono: Down there, you can talk?<br>Inazuma: I'm sorry... I wanted to be taller...<br>Akebono: Ah, no. I'm not talking about you, Inazuma<br>TTK: Hey hey! How dare you making Commander Inazuma cry! Down here won't let you get away, you know? Ah, there's nothing down here.<br>Akebono: Inazuma, can I break him?<br>Inazuma: Hawawawa, you can't!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hibiki: A reward for getting MVP?<br>TTK: Yeah, is there something you want?<br>Hibiki: I see, then...<br>TTK: Oh<br>Hibiki: Can you...<br>Hibiki: Give me a hug?<br>TTK: But I did that all the time. Well, come here, Hibiki<br>Hibiki: I'm happy...!<br>Kaga: I did it<br>TTK: So Kaga is the MVP this time<br>TTK: As expected<br>Kaga: Eh?<br>TTK: Hm? What's wrong?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not Rifuren <br>Yeah, sure you are.</br></br>  <br> Compare dogfighter planes vs energy fighters and energy comes out on top. <br><br>No this is something you can't say because it always depends on the situation. For example early Spitfires had A higher service ceilcing than early 109s in the battle of britain. A 109 couldnt run forever meaning A spitfire can simply chase a 109 till he had nowhere to run then engage him when hes cornered and out of his advantage.<br><br>I'd say dogfighting was still relevant even through the korean war with sabres and migs and that was the last time. Cuz it was the same shit. Different planes yes but it still always came down to who had more skill even if you were outnumbered .</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you dumb?</br>  Why don't military otaku join the actual military?  <br>TTK: Oh, what's wrong, Akatsuki?<br>Akatsuki: I just wanted to come here...<br>TTK: Ah, somehow<br>TTK: Suddenly I want to play with someone<br>TTK: I wonder if there's anyone...<br>Akatsuki: You can play with Akatsuki!<br>TTK: Good girl.

The filler in Alabasta did suck.  There's no way it's worse than the filler nowadays though. </br>  <br>That's the point, nowadays filler is 15/20 of a episode, but he complains more about 4 episodes he can easily skip.<br><br>And 4 episodes ruining the whole arc it's bullshit, even Ennies Lobby had more filler episodes.</br></br></br>  <br>What was the filler in Alabasta anyway? Can't remember much of that.</br>  <br>I remember one about a Bounty Hunter</br>  <br><br>Also the one about the sand pirates with the sand ship.</br></br>  reminder that we've seen doflamingo's eyes a long time ago  <br>Ace stayed with the crew for a bit trekking through the desert.

Robin best girl</br>  <br>There need to be more side boob shots of Robin.</br>  <br>How was I mad?<br>I was stating that I thought the Thousand Sunny is a better ship then ZoRobin</br></br>  What could Sanji even have learnt during the time skip? There is only so much you can do with kicks, I think a technique like skywalk was the most logical follow-up.  <br> dwarf king look like he just woke from coziest nap ever </br>  <br>I'm 100% certain that Sector B is the coziest place one can imagine.</br>  <br> POP! </br>  <br>couldn't agree more</br>  <br>improved his kick strength<br>new recipes<br>can fly<br>haki<br><br>and I'm sure there's something else since he was never brought into a corner yet</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, my bad. I thought you were agreeing that Zoro/Robin was the superior ship.</br>  <br> Everyone knows black leg sanji has the craziest kicks <br> everyone prepares to defend/counter his kicks for when they have to fight him <br> big surprise <br> suddenly he punches </br></br></br></br>  <br>no, its all good, mistakes happen though pic related is undoubtedly my favourite One Piece ship</br>  <br><br>okama kenpo</br></br>  <br> &gt;suddenly he punches </br>  <br>I prefer the Moby Dick. But probably because that is the greatest novel in literary history.</br>  <br><br>would go against everything that defines the character<br>don't you want him to punch women too?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. thats a good one as well</br>  <br>i'd pay him to punch you</br>  <br>Donquixote's ship is definitely my favorite.</br>  <br><br>The only time Sanji punches women is when he punches them in the dick</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128629978 <br>This is really OC, but it makes me laugh.</br>  <br>Sanji's not a whore  unlike your mom </br>  <br> Attack cuisine <br> he learned how to cook with his feet <br> now he doesn't have to protect his hands anymore and can fight using all his limbs </br></br></br>  <br>Sanji's not much of anything</br>  <br> losing the point <br>Sanji needs his hands not to cook but to masturbate.</br></br>  If sanji really becomes a drag queen will that ruin his character even more? or would you be okay with it.  <br>what if he could masturbate with his feet</br>  <br>He'd whore himself out for nami, but not your mum</br>  <br>It's a shame it was destroyed by Akainu, but I guess that was necessary, because it does not belong in this era.<br><br>I would like it if Law's submarine was called the Nautilus, because if he is the Shiohige to Ruffy's Roger then there would be a nice parallel to the old man, both their ships having a name from 19th century literature.<br><br> captcha: pick all the boats <br>Nice.<br><br><br> not being able to fap with your feet <br>Casual.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck I hate that vid so much but I laugh every time</br>  <br>it would only be okay if he did it to become even madder and then stronger for a while<br>if he actually became a true nakama it would be so much shit</br></br>  <br>Full Okama might get annoying, but a secret Okama mode to counter Zoro's Asura would be hilarious.</br>  Who is doflamingos sancho panza?  <br> TBH </br>  <br> 8 legs <br> &gt;7 penises </br></br>  <br>whoever ends up saving him</br>  <br><br>While we are being literary, I still want a bug zoan user called Gregor. Maybe in Kaido's army?</br></br>  <br> sanji <br><br>Who?</br></br></br>  <br>This guy</br>  <br>Oh, right, I saw his wanted poster before the time skip</br>  <br>No problem</br>  <br>  He puts shoes on his hands to punch </br>  <br>This. Also Zoro is with Perona and Frobin best Robin ship.<br><br>Me too. Why is he saying he's making onigiri (and something about bread but I can't into kanji) though? Is this from a Japanese meme or something?</br></br></br>  Is this the guy you all thought was CP0?  <br> he thinks the anime is relevant <br>They fucked up underworld lucci, so of course they put a random guy there,</br></br>  <br> tfw you'll will never be threatened by Doffy </br>  <br>But they weren't at all. Alabasta was loooong, and had multiple locations, characters having to overcome their weaknesses to defeat opponents, some pretty good twists, but it did feel pretty long at points. <br><br>Dressarosa feels like a template for a One Piece arc, kind of like Movie Z. It's not bad, it's just not mind-blowing. Definitely better than the last few arcs. At least IMO.</br></br></br>  So how did that sea king appear in the middle of the track?  Did Kuma awaken his fruit? Some of his attacks and abilities have no correlation with each other whatsoever.  <br>he attacked captain bones and got cut in half<br>is there so few things you need to discuss that you actually wonder about that?<br><br><br>nobody knows</br></br></br></br></br>  Finally, a new week and a new chapter soon  <br>Zoro<br>Zoro ultimate weapon is a sword he wields in his mouth.<br>Guts rely on a armor.</br></br></br>  <br>Jumped.</br>  <br> alabasta at 63 chapters <br> dressrosa at 95 and counting </br></br>  <br>  Is this from a Japanese meme or something? <br>it's some sort of Frozen sketch <br>https://mixch.tv/m/d3EeBY4h<br>They probably changed the lyrics to fit Law more.</br></br></br></br>   strawhats drawn by oda's mouth <br>is this real?</br>  Why is Brook so based?  <br>Robin looks like fake Robin.</br>  <br>he's all talk</br>  <br><br>Filler</br></br>   0 major fights <br> only support role <br> did fuck all training during the ts (spent it just running from trannies)  <br> almost got himself killed due to nosebleed in FI <br> almost got Viola killing him due to his stupidity <br> jobbed to vergo <br> jobbed to doffy <br> hasn't been seen since the beginning of Dressrosa arc <br><br>Mr. Prince is dead baby, Mr. Prince is dead - 0 "cool" moments for him since the ts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>His hair is green?</br></br>  <br> jobbed to vergo <br>Let's be fair, who didn't?</br></br>  <br>To this day, it still fucks me up that Brook is a 80+ year old skeleton hanging with a bunch of kids</br>  <br>The anime is shit?<br><br><br>him confronting doffy was very cool</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I imagine Sector A is pretty cozy too.<br><br>Sector C would be hell.</br></br></br></br>  <br> jobbed to doffy <br>really nigga</br></br>  <br>Does the goatee mean he's a fake blonde?</br>  <br>It's pasta.</br>  <br>to be fair, he spent 50 years out of 80 alone on a ship, i guess his character didn't really develope much during this time.</br>  <br>I'm not quite sure what to think about this. <br><br>It doesn't look that green to me, it's more like this snot colour.</br></br></br>  <br>Hard to develop a man's character when there's no characters around HEYO~</br>  <br><br>Here's a question - does Brook still age?</br></br>  <br>He just ran at first. Once Iva got back he actually trained.<br><br>So basically the whole time Luffy was breaking in and escaping Impel down and then fighting at marineford he was running. Then Iva came and he learned cooking and fighting.</br></br></br>  <br>He didn't just run from Trannies though during the timeskip, he trained with Bonclay and Ivankov.</br>  <br> he trained with Bonclay <br><br>no</br></br></br>  <br><br> Bonclay </br></br>  <br><br>My mistake, its been awhile since I read it, I thought Mr. 2 escaped Impel down with Ivankov.</br></br>  <br>He was Me. Prince only one time ten years ago. Stop waiting for his return.</br>  <br>Hard to say.<br>His fruit gives him a second chance at life, but once he found his body it was already a skeleton. He's moving bones fueled solely by his soul and no actual living parts.<br><br>Maybe if he had found his body sooner, he would have died of old age or hunger like a normal living being.<br><br>And now that he can separate his soul from his body, I'd wager him being effectively immortal since you can crush his bones to dust and he could separate himself beforehand and "survive". You'd need a fruit capable of destroying the very essence of a soul to kill him.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>our hero is still there</br>  <br><br>Yeah, it'd be pretty cool if he was immortal.</br></br>  <br><br> speedreaders <br><br>Even if ID was a while ago, he was shown;<br><br><br>On the front covers in PH.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128638397 <br><br> he doesn't read the manga </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128638397 <br>fuck off with your meme</br>  <br>Blondes get black facial hair all the time.</br>  <br>it's just a shitposter pretending to be an animefag<br>https://archive.moe/a/search/image/<wbr>v15naZh%2FBMBq1H8KYeQ3VQ%3D%3D</wbr></br></br>  <br>Most bro One Piece character</br>  <br><br>I know.</br></br>  <br>And how long ago was Punk Hazard? Like two years? I've read alot of other stuff in that time, I don't remember every detail.</br>  <br><br> I don't remember every detail </br></br>  <br>LOOK I'M FUCKING SORRY OK?!</br>   tfw Caesar won't become nakama <br>why live</br>  <br><br>Nah I'm jesting - I reread often.</br></br>  <br>Don't think so. His fruit gives him a second chance, not a third one. He may be a skeleton, but he can still "die", just look at the Ryuma fight in Thriller Bark; had he lost there, he'd be dead for good. He may be able to separate his soul from the skeleton, but only because he' still alive.<br><br>He's basically a really skinny no-DF human that can't swim.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Hmm I think it'd be interesting if he could 'die' - e.g. in a fight, but not by natural means.</br></br>  <br> He's basically a really skinny no-DF human that can't swim. <br>He can Astral project and freeze stuff now though</br></br>  <br>b-but maybe he will</br>  <br>why is robin so tiny</br>  <br>Yeah, that's exactly how I can see him dying.

Veryo being alive makes sense since no one does from explosions. But Monet took tashigis attack and a stab to the heart. Ace didn't survive a hole in the chest. I don't see how surviving an attack to the heart is doable. Plus if she was was alive how will she find her heart? Plus the stone thing she was stabbed with is still in there not to mention there was blood leaking. And don't get me started on this she'll join the straw hats shit. If she is alive for some retarded reason she would want to slaughter the strawhats. Did anyone in baroque works think about joining the straw hats? Not even Mr.3 after being linked by croc thought of joining.<br><br><br>TL:DR<br>Monet is dead</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ace didn't survive a hole in the chest. <br>Jinbei did</br></br>  <br>Episode 0</br>  <br> Jinbei did <br>that hole didnt destroy his heart.

Of course he can take a magma fist. Ace couldn't cuz he's a skinny fucker</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Confirmed anime only</br>  <br>ah yes i've seen this one too.<br><br>Buggy was such a cute little shit</br></br></br>  <br>I skim through both. If it was a cover story then yeah, I probably missed that. Doesn't invalidate my points though</br>  <br>Dalton cut off his head but the surgeons put it back on.</br>  <br>yeah then that's undeniably bullshit. No one dies unless Oda allows it<br><br>that makes me wonder how Vergo lived. Did someone pick up Monet+her heart and sweep Vergo into a trashbag seconds before the whole place blew up? Who would even bother?</br></br></br>  <br> does anyone have a valid reason other than this valid reason? <br>literally every "THIS CHARACTER'S DEAD" retards</br></br>  <br> Look at their sizes moron <br>Ace was weak to magma because Oda Pokemon logic<br><br>Usopp was one of the skinniest fuckers in the series and survived more shit than most SHs, it's all about willpower</br></br></br></br>  <br>Vergo is alive because Laws cuts don't do real damage, then the gas would have put him in a shell, a shell that survive the explosion with One Piece logic.</br>  <br> a shell that survive the explosion with One Piece logic. <br><br>that would be dumb considering Brook broke Kin'emon's shell simply by knocking him over<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Hm4<wbr>DpClU8qg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's exactly the reason why he'll survive the explosion though....because the gas does not really kill him.</br>  <br>Do you even have a shred of evidence?</br>  <br> Those I's and O's in the subtitles <br><br>Who the fuck thought that was a good idea?</br></br></br>  <br>you're missing the point<br><br>how would the shell take the impact of an explosion when simply hitting the ground can shatter it? The shell would simply crack from the explosion and kill them both anyway</br></br></br>  <br>the entire manga and anime<br>Let me guess.<br>You were one of the people who thought Miss Goldween got eaten by Carue, aren't you?</br></br></br>  <br>I thought the I's were cute</br>    <br>It's distracting. You don't need to be reminded in the subtitles that you're watching One Piece.</br>  <br>You're missing the point, explosisons don't kill in One Piece. Igaram survived them, so did Nami (Sanjis Body) and Usopp</br>  A previous iteration of this thred made me realize that Hody, in his super-roided form, is in all probability stronger than Lucci.<br><br>I still find that a bit hard to believe, but the logic was sound.</br></br>  <br>Your retated</br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>Lucci could be even stronger since the timeskip though.</br>  <br>Of course he was his water droplets flew through tonnes of buildings. What's even more crazy is Jinbe deflected those same droplets with his own.</br>  <br> You're missing the point, explosisons don't kill in One Piece <br><br>then why bother mentioning the gas at all? You could just say Law expected the explosion to kill them both somehow not taking into account that explosions apparently do shitall damage in OP universe<br><br>Of course they'd ride out the explosion with only minor burns and scratches</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As they were when they respectively fought Luffy, I mean.</br>  <br>Eh, I'm sure a Rokuougan could do that sort of damage too.</br>  <br>So he lives on sniper island?</br>  <br>Dont forget about Pell.</br>  <br>Damn. My retated is really hurt right now.<br><br>Sorry. I guess you weren't even born yet when Little Garden was happening.</br></br></br>  <br> Doffy and his entire crew are sent to Impel Down <br> nobody knows about Sugar's powers <br> entire prison stuff is turned into toys <br> ??????? <br> BREAK OUT! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Seastone cuffs are probably standard for all prisoners, powers or not.</br>  <br>yeah but what are they gonna do when they go to put them on her? she only has to touch them.</br>  <br>she's unconscious<br><br>the cuffs are probably already on her</br></br></br>  <br>Have we seen her been taken away? or still unconscious with marines etc around her? She woke up last time relatively quick what's to stop it happening again</br>  Will Usopp ever get a serious fight again or is he just regulated to dealing with female chars with bullshit powers from now on? It was kinda funny with Perona and Sugar but come on we need to see how the nigga grew since the ts.  <br>He took out the cookie-cutter guy.</br>  <br> what's to stop it happening again <br>plot mostly</br></br>  <br> yfw Dellinger becomes a fuckhole in Impel Down </br>  <br> implying anyone would get close to him with these like that <br><br>the scent of crazy alone would keep people away</br></br></br>  <br>Do people even know she's an executive? Even Law didn't recognize her.</br>  <br>Even so as  said they could just think she's a child etc and leave her</br>  <br>Crazy or not, who could resist his legs</br>  <br>Law never saw Monet and Sugar when he was part of the Family. He only met Monet at Punk Hazard.</br>  <br>Cavendish</br>  <br>it calls her one of the 8 executives right there in the image</br>  <br>I wonder how the scene when Yasopp reunites with Usopp and asks him how his mother is doing will go</br>  <br>Didn't buggy escaped because they didn't know he was a user?</br>    <br>That's a shitty scan.</br>  <br> they were voiced by the same guy.... </br>  <br>manly tears<br><br>then actual tears later when he falls into his cup</br></br></br>  <br> we need to see how the nigga grew since the ts <br>He practically willed himself CoO during the Sugar fight so that's a great indication.  I enjoyed the Perona fight. </br></br>  <br> implying the villains level up. </br>  <br>fuck. this shit got me so pumped when i first read it. one of the best moments in dressrosa.</br>  <br>My dream fight is a fight between Usopp and some New World sniper who is so good they actually pin down the entire crew from an enormous distance.<br><br> Usopp loses and gets his hand blown off. <br><br> Franky makes him a robot hand. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For real, just how power is Zoro now after the time skip?<br><br>Could he actually be admiral level now?</br></br></br>  <br>   it's the size of franky's robot hands </br>  <br>That's probably gonna be what Usopp vs. Van Augur is like.<br><br>I kind of think it MIGHT be cool if their fight is the first that takes place as the Blackbeard crew is already on whichever island the BB vs Straw Hats fights take place on (maybe even Raftel? Who knows) and Usopp has to defeat Augur before the crew can actually land.<br><br>mite b cool</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I just think it'd be cool for one of the crew to get a franky prosthetic.</br></br>  How many of the previous villains could Usopp defeat by now?  <br> Brook gets badly damaged in a fight and his bones are crumbling, he can barely keep his soul in <br> franky makes a metal skeleton body for Brook that he moves his soul into </br></br>  <br> Franky donates some of his own hair. </br>  <br>i dont see him taking out anyone before Lucci</br>  <br>He is getting rekt in Wano soon.</br>  <br> anyone before Lucci <br>Usopp&gt;Enel confirmed.</br></br>  <br><br>I remember that nearly the same thing was said about Sanji. <br><br>Someone being surprised that he was someone's underling.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck yeah Seaking Usopp had some great moments in Dressrosa.</br>  <br>I honestly forget sometimes that that fucker existed<br><br>I dont see im taking down croc. Maybe he can wreck Arlong now?</br></br></br>  <br>Probably. It's nice to catch a lot of little things as I'm re-reading, and I like to see how far back some of this stuff goes. <br><br>This is one of my favorite catches so far.</br></br></br>  <br>Croc is New World level, though probably on the weaker end. Luffy won because he lucked into his weakness.</br>  <br> ussop vs chu <br> ussop vs Mr 4  <br> ussop vs luffy </br></br></br>  <br> haki enhanced Usopp firing rubber coated explosives at Enel <br> his deceptiveness allows him to surpass mantra, Enel can't tell the lies in his head from the truth <br><br>ez</br></br></br></br>  <br>yep. Croc is a force. Arlong is a bitch though so Usopp could snipe him from a distance<br><br>Could Usopp take Bellamy?</br></br></br>  <br>There is multiple tiers of admiral level <br><br>There is <br>Akinu tier <br>Aokiji tier<br>Sengoku tier <br>Kizaru tier <br>Fujitora tier<br>Ryokyugu tier <br>Garp tier<br>Rayleught tier<br>Mihawk tier <br><br>I'd say he ain't admiral level since he can't beat doffy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, Bellamy's haki may even be too much for Trebol.</br>  <br> Trebol <br><br>could Usopp take out ANYone with Armament Haki?</br></br></br>  <br>There's plenty of fodders like Sai's brother Boo and 99% of Amazon Lily.</br>  <br> I'd say he ain't admiral level since he can't beat doffy <br><br>Say who? He beat a top executive with barely any effort and was shown. fighting equally with an admiral, most likely he can take Doffy too.</br></br></br>  <br>Keep dreamin Sanji-fag. Franky's already taken his seat as 3 strongest strawhat.</br>  <br> That flower pot <br>what is it censoring /a/?</br></br>  <br> his punching style is a martial art based upon careful food prep </br>  <br>He pushed an Admiral back a few feet. Pre-skip Sanji actually disarmed an Admiral.</br>  Were you on the Franky Train or the Paulie Train?<br><br>Or are you a newfag who wasn't even around for Water 7 and Enies Lobby?</br></br>  So what are the chances that Roger and Dragon were brothers like Ace and Luffy were?  <br> Pre-skip Sanji actually disarmed an Admiral. <br><br>Only because Zoro was having him on block.</br></br></br>  <br>Roger is as old Garp.</br>  <br>That would mean garp is Roger's dad.<br><br>Unless you mean symbolic, like the sake thing. Probably not. Garp is only a little older than Roger was.</br></br></br>  <br>Dragon could be his.. little brother<br><br><br> Unless you mean symbolic <br>of course I mean symbolically<br><br>I didnt really think the age gap would be an issue. Why is it an issue?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I vaguely recall that early on in the series what we heard of Roger painted him as a fucking scary motherfucker.<br><br>But as time went on instead he became Luffy: Prequel.</br></br></br>  <br>Because Dragon was probably younger than Luffy when Roger was at large. Roger would have been a middle aged man.</br>  <br>so like Jinbe and Luffy, age-wise? I still dont see the issue though. They could yakuza brothers. Or Uncle/nephew like Borsalino and Sentomaru</br>  Dragon is Luffy's  mother <br><br> Genderswapped by Ivan. </br></br>  <br>I was on the Sodom and Gomorrah joining as the straw hats horses train</br>  <br>not gonna lie<br><br>Back then, I was watching episodes on Toonami and dont think they ever even got to Franky<br><br>years later, it wasnt something I had to guess about</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All Paulie had was ropes, fuck him. <br><br>The fire-breathing cyborg with bitches and his own gang always looked better.</br></br></br>  <br>I didnt think any1 wuz gonna join during the emes lobby or wter 7 arkz</br>  <br>All about the Frankman, since after he made up with Usopp I was convinced that he was bro as fuck.</br>  What role could a future strawhat possibly serve?<br><br>Everyone has a defined job, bar Zoro but he's the first mate so he's kinda the secondary captain.</br></br>  I hope we get another side-character on the same reaction tier as Carue.  <br>A gladiator</br>   we will never see Sanji being useful again   <br>I think Jobs have all been officially covered by the current crew<br><br>new memebers dont necessarily need a role. They're just padding out their numbers now</br></br></br>  can zoro beat guts?  This Usopp lie got proven actually true fairly quickly.  I like the setup to him cutting iron.  <br>Why doesn't zoro just use those fucking weights as a weapon?</br>  <br>I'd imagine he'd lose a shitload of speed.</br>  So Burgess WASN'T part of the very initial Blackbeard crew, huh.  <br>They are just silhouettes I'd take them with a grain of salt, it looks like there are two Van Augers.</br>  <br> The Straw Hats' eyes bug out, too <br><br>I fucking lost it at this panel.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah the left one has the same hat but the positioning makes it look more like a sword.<br><br><br>Yeah all their eyes bugged out fairly often early on. I miss it, especially when it was done subtly.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm just saying the original shichibukai silhouettes all looked like Mihawk too. I don't expect Kaido to look anything like his silhouette either.</br>  <br>Shhhhhh don't mention it. Let us hope.</br>  <br>Are you talking about the poneglyph I don't remember that scene exactly but poneglyphs talk about the void history</br>  <br>Zoro can beat anyone, He's admiral level now.</br>  <br>This anon knows where it's at.</br>  <br>I don't think they did but I don't seem to have saved that image so I can't post it. I get what you mean though.</br>  <br>Ed list?</br>  <br>Gladius and Deli were cute. Too bad we didn't get to see them actually team up.</br>  <br>Newfag.</br>  <br>It's a retarded non-canon poneglyph in Alabasta that holds no value of any kind. <br><br>I was confused as fuck when they started talking about the actual poneglyph with the Pluton secrets because I was sure that they were talking about the one Luffy+Zoro+Chopper found.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him but what, did the anime add a Poneglyph to Alabasta on top of the already existing one?</br>  <br>Yes, see<br/></br>  https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-2/<br><br> When will Spyro return with the new translations? </br></br></wbr>   Never   <br>What is Iroha supposed to be?

All we know animal-wise is that she's allergic to cats.<br><br>For my money, I think rabbit since her mom and dad sure do fuck like one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that supposed to be an insult?</br>  <br>Not at all, it's what the manga showed her as.</br>  This thread is even slower than the Iroha one. Just wait until Spyro releases chapter 2 to go on with the B2B again  <br><br>Never, because his waifu isn't going to win, and he's silently rage quitting.</br></br>    baka bakka &gt; senpai~ &gt; gomi-chan &gt; huh? &gt; kimoi! &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shaa~ <br><br>Discuss.</br></br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br>shaa~&gt;nyaa~</br>  <br>Shit&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Autism sounds</br>  <br>*&gt;senpai~</br>  Post hot pictures everyone.  Yukipasta Yui buns  <br>I want to make this Yuigahama a Yuigamama.</br>  <br>Side bun yukinon is almost as cute as the genuine article.</br>  Maybe Yui should just kill herself and solve 90% of the problems.  <br>That would just be running from the problem and not solve anything.<br>Perhaps you should do it Anon.</br></br>  Imagine Yui and Yukino's feelings when they attend the wedding between 8man and Iroha.<br><br>It's only a matter of time.</br></br>  <br>Why would he take responsibility for Zaimokuza's mistake?</br>  Doesn't matter who ends up with who, I just want this guy to be happy<br><br>Although I prefer Yukino, but she has to grow too. Maybe rejection will facilitate that?</br></br>  What would Yui and Yukino think if they saw 8man playing with Keika? Would they tell Komachi she may have been replaced? Would they get jealous? <br><br>Would they imagine having him care for their own children?</br></br>   no Iroha to look down on me   <br>Not sure how being rejected again will help her grow.<br>Only reason rejection helped HIkki grow was because he was rejected over and over until it didn't even phase him anymore.</br></br>  <br> you will never smell her fluids </br>  <br>Rejection didn't really help him grow though. Just because he was going through some major growing pains before doesn't mean he wasn't still completely stunted by all the rejections.</br>    Couldn't say thanks for the Irohasu thread in time. <br>But yeah, thanks, brothers.<br><br><br><br>Stop it you, I can't do it right now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not getting what you want gives people a backbone, there's a reason why spoiled brats exist. Although she doesn't seem like a spoiled brat in terms of physical needs, she isn't well versed in relationships. Might also pass the genuine lesson from Hiratsuka where being in a relationship with someone means you're ready to hurt/get hurt. There's a lot of things that can only be realized through rejection.<br><br>But then again I'm not saying that I don't want Yukino to end up with 8man, I just want both of them to grow which is exactly what the major premise of the story. I would be really happy if all the little things the novel showed be brought up again such as <br> the picture she bought from the Christmas trip show up again in their living room once 8man and her settle down and have a family  <br> having 8man's third question result in not being friends but lovers.  <br> Yukino's final form becomes like sensei and 8man would be head over heels for him. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yukino's final form becomes like sensei <br> Drinks <br> Smokes <br> Ancient anime references <br> Punches <br>Do you really want this?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that's not what 8man found alluring in sensei.</br>  <br>She probably can't handle drinks and with her condition smoking is the worst she can do.<br>She does tend to go on rants about the things she likes but not as intense as Hiratsuka does.</br></br>  <br>Not him, but that's the point.</br>  <br>Was it really necessary to continue these threads under a trick like that? Let's just let them die. It's time to move on to new series and new discussions. Really now at this point there's nothing left to discuss about the series. At least the Irohafags are honest about only wanting to waifu worship.</br>  <br>This will happen if 8man rejects Yukino, what will make her realize she is actually Sensei from the past, then they'll battle it out to see who is the real Yukino</br>  <br>We have important things to talk about such as...<br><br>How would Yukino initiate sex? Would she bluntly state her need to have children or would she beat around the bush (like she often does) and imply it only to shyly reject the idea once 8man catches on?<br><br>This is important information dammit!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's obvious how she'll act by the end of the series.</br>  <br>Is that before or after she goes super Yukinon when Hachiman dies?</br>  <br>She would keep teasing him until he's unable to resist. She wouldn't be the first to initiate early on in the relationship.</br>  <br>I think it'll be 90% hormones when she does it, but it'll start with her working a jab at 8man's sexual prowess into her banter and escalate to a "yeah, well prove it" moment when she gets right in 8man's face. Then finally realizes what the hell she's doing and that she really, really wants to pin him down and take a ride on the 8 inches, and from there it's just a matter of who caves first.<br><br>I'm wondering how Yui would work it now too. I think the shy hint-dropping would be more up her alley, though I can see her just showing up in the bedroom in new lingerie and letting nature take its course too.</br></br></br>  Rank the following Yaharis by order of intelligence (currently in random order): Yukino, Yui, Iroha, Hachiman, Saki, Komachi, Sensei, Yumiko, Cunt, Tobe, Zaimokuza, Saika  <br>I'm also quite curious about what their family interactions would be like<br><br> The hikigaya family goes to the beach <br> 8man unconsciously stares at girls <br> "Hachiman, what are you looking at?" <br> "N-nothing really" <br> "Is that so? Hey, have you heard? There were news yesterday that a wife killed her husband" <br>"R-really? why?"<br>"She had believed he had been cheating on him, shows that people shouldn't underestimate a woman's jealousy huh.."<br>"I-I suppose.."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Damn. I'll give you Yukino-fags credit. Y'all have great imagination</br></br></br>  <br>Excuse the filthy site I got the image from.

Saki<br>  + family oriented girl <br>  + Ignored the cunt’s advances on her and protected her dignity as a pure girl  <br>  + she will not cheat on you because of how domesticated she is <br>  - Who the fuck is Yuu???  <br><br>3. Iroha<br>  + She wants something genuine and is working towards attaining it <br>  + Once she sets her sights on her true love, she does everything to obtain him <br>  + sly, yet genuine to her true love  <br>  +/- She hangs around random boys (although that might change now that she wants something genuine) <br>  - She used to like the cunt (even if it was a superficial) <br><br>4. Yukino<br>  - Has had many of her first experiences with the cunt <br>  - Loved the cunt so much that when he rejected her she became an autistic ice bitch <br>  - She seemed experienced and nonchalant when she was talking to Yui about sex and being a virgin in their 1st meeting (implying that she wasn’t a virgin); she even looked proud and spoke with an air of superiority when she was talking about it <br>  - She gave the cunt chocolates (beyond used goods) <br><br>Komachi, Rumi, and sensei are not included because we do not sexualize best imoutos, loli idols, or Christmas cakes<br><br> What about Orimito? <br>She doesn’t belong in this ranking because Brorimoto is just as her nickname implies, the biggest bro; she will be 8man’s best wingwoman. She will tell her cute friends all about her adventures with the new, cool, and hilarious 8man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is cunt ranked so highly?</br>  <br>Not him but he's perceptive as fuck</br>  <br>Not only is he book smart but he can also apply that intelligence in the real world.

I think Hachiman will be fully healed once he can entertain the thought of having a girlfriend without getting triggered by his past.</br>  <br>You were the one that got pissed off weren't you<br>Nice to see that you still are</br></br>  <br>All me</br>  <br> balance <br> for a girl like Iroha <br>she's probably gonna dump 8man after she sees another alpha, she's a one night stand for him at best</br></br></br>  <br> implying Iroha wouldn't make the perfect wife when Yukino becomes a bitch like her mother and Yui would drive 8man to suicide since it's likely their chilren would get killed by a easily preventable accident since she's stupid </br>  <br>If anyone's going to drive him crazy it's Iroha and her manipulative ways.</br>  <br> Yukino becomes a bitch like her mother <br>not after muh character development<br> Yui would drive 8man to suicide since it's likely their chilren would get killed by a easily preventable accident since she's stupid <br>Yui will kill 8man through diabetes and he'll never get to father children because she's too sweet and cute<br> Iroha wouldn't make the perfect wife <br>right, then she'll be coming home later and later after meeting a publishing editor<br>sluts never change anon, let that be a life lesson to you</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yukino<br> Divorce after a couple months of marriage because she bitches about everything <br>Yui<br> Boring marriage (Yui too dumb) <br> 8man ends up either in the hospital trying to save the suicidal dog or child from the truck or NTR her with a coworker </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She'll drive him crazy from all the teasing and get him to fuck her rough.<br><br><br>Yukino wll take after her bitch mother, this is a 100% guarantee<br><br>Yui is retarded and would downgrade 8man's genetic stock.<br><br> right, then she'll be coming home later and later after meeting a publishing editor <br>sluts never change anon, let that be a life lesson to you<br><br>Nope, she also wants to be genuine and will be loyal to Hachiman</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Yukino becomes a bitch like her mother <br> not after muh character development <br>So for you a Yukino character development is a complete change in her character? You might as well say you like her because of her japanese beauty traits</br></br></br>  <br> Nope, she also wants to be genuine and will be loyal to Hachiman <br>So do the other two girls, and they're the only ones we've seen putting any effort into it.</br></br>  <br>The other girls only want 8man to reach his genuine-ty, what Iroha wants is genuine for herself.<br>If anything, Yui is the biggest transgressor against genuine since she wanted to keep the status quo and I have no idea whats up with Yukino but going back to the destinyland she wants something neither 8man or Haruno have which probably alludes more to independence than something genuine.<br><br>Only Iroha and 8man share the same goal.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Still better than ending up with Iroha. She may want genuine but once she hears another guy getting emotional she'll hop off the 8man train as fast as she hopped off the Hayama train</br></br>  <br> Still better than... <br><br>At least put some effort into defending your waifu</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> thinking 8man wouldn't like Yukino's bitchiness <br>he literally said he liked her bitchiness because it was refreshing and not superficial bullshit, if you think he's going to divorce her because of that you're delusional<br> the only reason they're going to divorce is because he's been accidentally fucking other girls behind her back </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was never a waifufaggot like you, it's just clear to me that unloyal girls aren't worth anyone's time</br>  <br> once she hears another guy getting emotional she'll hop off the 8man train as fast as she hopped off the Hayama train <br><br>how nice you ignored the efforts 8man is spending on Iroha. Helping her win the election, helping her organizing Chrismas event, caring bags, boxes and other things (this is important), remembering birthday etc.<br><br>Traditional and cliche course, but from other (and Iroha) perspectives it's obvious that he is hitting on her (and winning scores also).<br><br>Meanwhile Yukipasta is too busy copy other, and Yui still wet-dreaming about "someday dates"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying I'm a Yukinofag <br>Yes, I meant that once she reaches final form she won't be bitchy anymore to 8man, it's barely a complete change in character</br></br>  You know, I think it's strange how Irohafag arguments against Yui and Yukino as relationship partners never amount to more than meme-tier nonesense like "Copypastanon" and "Yui a dumb"<br><br>It's almost as if they don't have any real ground to stand on or something.</br></br>  <br>She will drive him mad, alright. Just not the way you were hoping for.</br>  <br> he literally said he liked her bitchiness because it was refreshing and not superficial bullshit, if you think he's going to divorce her because of that you're delusional <br>It's refreshing when you only hear them for 1 hour a day in the club room. But hearing the bitching 24/7 after being married? That's the number 1 reason of a divorce<br><br><br>Oh okay, so you are just a shitposter/hater</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> efforts 8man spending on Iroha <br>so the next guy who sees a cute girl and flirts with her she'll fall for? <br> boxes and other things (this is important) <br>you're saying that a for a girl like Iroha, a guy helping her out will win her heart too. If you don't think that's sluttiness then your waifu goggles are on too tight.<br><br>At least the other girls won't whore themselves out, loyalty is miles better than being a slut.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dragging out that poorly written copypasta again?<br><br>I mean the concept is amusing sure, but it's worse than that time I tried to actually read 50 Shades of Grey.</br></br></br>  <br> if he isn't a cancerous waifufaggot he's a shitposter/hater <br>You believe whatever you want, friend.</br></br>  <br>Let it flow.</br>  <br>The truth my dear friend, is that Yuifags and Yukinofags have nothing going on for their generic waifus which leads them to lash against each others and other girls</br>  <br> But hearing the bitching 24/7 after being married? <br>Did you even read the fucking LN? 8man was never tired of her banter. Sure he complained about it but he legitimately enjoys his interaction with her. You have literally no basis for the argument of that he'll leave her if he's bitchy.</br></br>  <br> Implying you aren't a shitposter <br>It's like you don't even read what you post</br></br>  <br>I'm still not hearing any arguments. I'm gonna assume you ran out of them.</br>  This fucking thread.  <br>Why are Yukinofags and Yuifags such slutloving fucks?<br>Give me a proper post and you'll receive a proper reply.</br></br>  yukino with cat ears is too much  <br>Yes, I read the LN. And if your reading comprehension wasn't this low, you would realize I said<br> It's refreshing when you only hear them for 1 hour a day in the club room. <br><br>They don't spend all the day together and banter, they just do it when classes are over and they are in the clubroom. Another different story is when you live 24/7 with someone with whom your only interaction is just insults</br></br></br></br>  <br>Before asking for arguments, present yours instead of this low quality bait</br>  <br>The fact that you're implying waifufaggots aren't shitposters is even worse.<br>And I was just judging the girls based on how I saw them, if you that triggers you I don't give a fuck</br></br>  <br> I can't present any arguments so I'll just call the other girls sluts based on no actual fact <br>Nice one</br></br>  Just posting the best girl  <br>Yukino offers 8man an intellectual equal and a mental sparring partner to keep him on his toes.<br><br>Yui provides him with emotional support and validation that he's sorely in need of along with gentle pushes to become a progressively better person.<br><br>Iroha is cute, manipulative, and claims she wants something genuine.<br><br>And last but not least, 8man actually cares about his relationships with Yukino and Yui.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Yui is dumb and wouldn't be able to hold a stimulating conversation with 8man. <br><br> Yukino's feeling are not genuine, she has redistributed her feelings for hayama to 8man (being her white knight and a person she can rely on). Furthermore, she is confusing love with dependency. <br><br> Iroha is still unproven in being genuine. <br><br>That's why he should get together with Saki or just date one of Orimoto's cute friends (Orimoto will be 8man's wingwoman).</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you actually think Yukino will be 24/7 bitchy with him? You're lying if you think that every interaction with him is just her 100% insulting him.<br><br>You're also projecting too hard, just because you won't be able to take bitchiness doesn't mean 8man can't. He has taken it and given it back, you have no proof he will leave her if she acts like she does.<br><br>Not to mention if he enters a marriage with her won't he be prepared to face that? Assuming he would be dating her after high school ends, that leaves several years where he would experience it. I'm 100% sure 8man can deal with it, no matter how far you want to project yourself onto him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The fact that you're implying waifufaggots aren't shitposters is even worse. <br> Didn't even present an argument about not being a shitposter <br>Yes, you are a shitposter, and a very retarded one if you are saying all waifufags are shitposters</br></br></br>  <br>Are we reading the same LN?<br> Everytime they talk Yukino throws some insults to him or mocks his family name <br> 8man tries to get back at in his inner monologue but he's too beta to speak his mind <br><br>Apart from the drama dialogues and unfunny cat jokes, she has always talked to him with one-sided insults</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like you beat out Cap Cunt nowadays.</br>  The funny thing is, not once have I talked bad about the YY girls until today and I was proud of that fact.<br>Guess we should let these threads die.</br>  <br>He stopped the cuntkilling after 4 months.

He's leading on three girls at the same time and is going to  reject  them all because he's just that alpha.</br>  <br>https://d.maxfile.ro/oallemjcap.web<wbr>m</wbr></br>  <br>This Ikemen</br>  Hello faggots, anyone have the link of 8man and Saika doujin? No sadpanda  <br>Does Iroha still admire Hayama? Yes.<br>Does she still has a shallow crush on him? Quite likely.<br>Has a more serious interest on 8man? Yes.<br>Going after him harder and harder as time passes? Yes.<br>Does she lie about all of those? No.<br><br>Iroha is the most honest one out of the girls, both Yui and Yukino are full of shit. It's almost as if she's  genuine. <br>Besides, Iroha is precisely his type, whether you like it or not.<br>No wonder 8man has no complaints about her and is busy lusting over her, trying not to fall for it while having to deal with double YY bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   “Yui’s pretty nice too, but she’s kinda air-headed, ya know?” <br><br> Oh, yeah. She was pretty air-headed. But for someone as idiotic as him to say that was pretty much the pot calling the kettle black. <br><br> “Also, it’s obvious she’s popular, so there’s lots of competition.” <br><br> … <br><br> Well, yeah, I guess <br><br> Nice girls are popular. It’s scary how unpopular and clueless guys are so attracted to them. They reeled you in hook, line and sinker. You ended up blue in the face like Grander Musashi. <br><br> That’s why I won’t get surprised I won’t tremble I won’t get taken off guard I won’t be shocked I won’t tremble I won’t get surprised. What the hell? I was trembling like a leaf. <br><br> Indifferent to my quiet sighing, Tobe went on <br><br>Meh, 8man is such a hypocrite.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Being genuine and having "something genuine" aren't the same thing.<br><br>8man gave an abstract definition of an idealistic relationship. Just because a person is honest with themselves doesn't mean they'll be able to understand and be understood by others.</br></br></br>  <br>If she was genuine she wouldn't use Hayama as a pretense to get with 8man and actually go after him genuinely. She's his type but he's lusted after the other girls as well. <br><br>And in the end, no matter what you say, he still cares for YY much more than he cares for her, and his limited interaction with her shows it. She needs to jump through a shit ton of hoops to hope to get the feelings 8man has for YY, which is why she has literally no chance of winning.</br></br></br>  <br>She isn't genuine, not yet at least.<br>None of the girls are genuine yet except for Miura.</br></br>  <br> And in the end, no matter what you say <br>Welp.<br> he still cares for YY much more than he cares for her, and his limited interaction with her shows it. She needs to jump through a shit ton of hoops to hope to get the feelings 8man has for YY, which is why she has literally no chance of winning <br>Is this going to become a meme?<br><br>Didn't know WW posted here, I'm sorry.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Iroha is precisely his type <br>Kek<br><br>Come back when your waifu gets the beauty description like Yukino does.</br></br></br></br>  <br> miura <br> implying <br>if anything it'd be Dayone who is genuine - genuinely gives no fucks.<br>Something is hilarious? laugh at it<br>Something sounds good? preach it<br><br>She's honestly too good for 8man. Glad she isn't part of the 8bowl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No wonder 8man has no complaints about her <br>Because he doesn't care about her enough to complain about her? <br>And if you think she's more genuine than the other girls then you're delusional</br></br></br>  <br>Iroha is much further from genuine than Y+Y, and there's no more damning scene than the cooking class. Almost immediately after 8man inadvertently sideswipes her with his "but I don't hate it" what does she do but run off to Hayama. She's not remotely ready to be honest with her feelings nor do we see any signs that she struggles with the fact that she should be like Y+Y are.<br><br><br> Is this going to become a meme? <br>If calling out things you hate that are blindingly evident is a meme, then yes. It'll probably be the biggest meme since Batman.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I disagree with it so it's a meme <br>Deep down you know it's true, don't be delusional</br></br>  <br>That isn't a type either.<br>8man's real type is someone who will take care of him and let him do what he wants.<br><br>Komachi fills this roll because his mom is always sleeping or working.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Watari's definition of genuine doesn't make any difference when double YY are still fake to the core.<br><br>Being genuine yourself is already a big step foward, regardless of what "something genuine" means to somebody else.<br>8man might not understand Iroha at all, but she sure as hell understands him.<br><br><br><br>Ayy, we're back at volume 8.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>who is this cookie guy you are talking about?</br>  <br>A joke.</br>  <br>Hayama, the answer is always Hayama.<br>Yui wanted cookie man and was trying hard to fit in his group<br>Yukino gave him choco and did who knows what else with him.<br>Iroha wanted him too.</br></br></br></br>  <br> double YY are still fake to the core <br>please justify this claim<br> 8man might not understand Iroha at all, but she sure as hell understands him. <br>didn't he say himself that he wants to understand, not be understood?<br> Ayy, we're back at volume 8. <br>and you still aren't out of your delusion, are you</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Watari's definition of genuine doesn't make any difference when double YY are still fake to the core. <br>Yui and Yukino are in the middle of something called character development. If you're really so shortsighted as to think things won't change then I suggest you read/watch a few more stories to get a better understanding of how literature differs from reality.<br><br> Being genuine yourself is already a big step foward, regardless of what "something genuine" means to somebody else. <br>How would you know? Like I said just because someone is honest with themselves doesn't mean they will suddenly be understood by others or understand others.<br> 8man might not understand Iroha at all, but she sure as hell understands him. <br>I'm going to need to know why you think that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The only reason why you waifufaggots like Iroha is because you're all self inserting and want an aggressive slutty girl to make the first move <br><br> inb4 Iroha has no emotional baggage <br><br>Relationships are all about overcoming those, what do you expect? Happily ever after?</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm going to need to know why you think that. <br>Because she lied to him to get him to do something, which apparently means she understands him.</br></br>    <br><br>Iroha is a fox.</br></br>  <br> "Hikki, here, to thank you for that time." <br><br> And with that said, Yuigahama took something gently out from her bag. A beautiful wrapping that contained cookies was held reverently by both her hands. <br><br>It was just confirmed recently that cookie man is Hikki all along.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No,  Totsuka is the little fox. </br>  I was better off lurking.  <br>A relationship with literally no emotional difficulties is destined to crash really hard in any story<br>8man and Iroha's relationship is no different</br></br>  <br>I am sincerely biting just becasue there is nothing else to fuel these threads: and look, it has even spawned some conversation relating to the current psyche the girls have right now. Maybe it wasn't that bad to contribute to the shitposting a little.</br>  <br>Well, they're right that she understands how 8man thinks, but that's hardly unusual. both Hayama and Haruno have a pretty good grasp of that too, as does Yukino when she's not busy building more pedestals to put him on. Yui understands him too, just on an emotional level instead of an intellectual one.<br><br>The reason Irohafags shout so much about Iroha understanding 8man is because she weaponizes it to get her date. Whether that's anything to actually be proud of is a completely different story though.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, me too. I was totally biting all those times just to makes the threads go longer. I in no way responded for any other purpose.</br>  <br>My brother in arms.<br>We are the real batmans, sacrificing our integrity for the sake of discussion.</br></br>  <br>and they call her the most genuine when she uses Hayama as a front to get closer to 8man<br><br> inb4 3rd grade hikigaya certificate <br><br>that's only because she understood his tendency of being a shut in, but let's be honest. who doesn't out of the three? that line gets way too much credit than what it actually entails.</br></br></br></br></br>  This shit is almost as bad as Haganai threads back then, almost.<br>But it's still a disaster.</br>   we were supposed to be discussing about best guy <br> instead we go back to waifu wars <br>I hope cute coffee fearing 8man will change your minds</br></br>  <br><br><br> disagrees with what is being discussed <br> can't find any arguments against them <br> resorts to posting 3D reaction images straight of funnyjunk instead of just ignoring it <br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> gets called out on bait <br> continues to bait <br>We get it, you really like the b2b threads</br></br></br>  <br> Sees irrefutable arguments <br> Calls it bait <br>Why is this allowed?</br></br></br>  <br>Yet you keep responding and bumping the thread<br>Again, just because you disagree with it doesn't give you an excuse to shitpost</br></br>  <br> But (surprise, surprise!) this time the rice was damn good. <br><br>8man is a qt when having a crush.</br></br></br>  <br>Because he no longer batman.</br>  <br>Batman can feel emotion<br>but he still does what he as to do, like when he told Yukino do fix her shit herself</br></br>  I don't keep up with these thread so sorry for asking, but has Volume 11 been completely translated yet and If so, where can I find it, since spyro only did chapter 1?  <br>Spyro's been busy with work or some shit. That or Yen Press kidnapped him.</br>  <br>Spyro is dead buddy<br>some anons translated the Iroha spoonfeeding scene, I can't spoonfeed the link to you because I didn't read it<br>they also translated the final scene which I'm too lazy to find</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh, that's unfortunate, thanks for the answer.</br></br>  <br> translated the final scene <br><br>http://pastebin.com/23mRRdEi</br></br></br>  Anybody got the scans of the BD special volume n ?  <br> kept trying to etch Yukino half naked figure into his mind. <br>I'm interested in Yukino's lack of reaction to this, she didn't get mad, she didn't blush, she just kind of stared back.<br>Second time he does it she doesn't pay his staring any mind.<br>Third time she just casually covers herself up.</br></br></br></br>  Why do people still think 甘すぎだな means the same thing as just 甘すぎ?  Where I can read the raws of the last chapters?  <br>We don't. And I tried talking about his final line "甘すぎだな " on the Iroha thread but there was no interest.<br> I still think he meant "too naive", and not "too sweet". </br></br>  <br>Come back when 8man actually sexualizes Yukino in a recent volume.<br><br><br>8man lied about that. He likes spoiling Komachi, just like he likes spoiling Iroha.<br><br> says Komachi takes care of him <br> yet his "big brother instinct" is always as a caretaker <br><br>8man's central conflict as a character is that he actually wants to be a good person, but he's so jaded/self-conscious that he pretends to be a lazy asshole instead.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What did sensei imply by this?  <br>That it's fine for them to go at it raw.</br>  <br>Surely they're too smart to try something so risky.</br>  <br>The reason the discussion died is that, as the biggest flag in the series so far, it's been shitposted the hardest. It's also pretty ambiguous.<br><br>That said the statement is too significant for it just to be talking about the chocolate. There is an argument to be made that the word 甘すぎ was never used in the chocolate discussion (嫌い was used instead) as well, so he probably is actually referring to her earlier rejection, thus making "naive" the correct definition.<br><br>That said, the statement itself isn't that important so much as what it's referring to. If it's referring to the rejection then the story is basically asking you to re-examine the rejection, as 8man is retroactively assigning significance to the scene from the beginning. To begin with, the fact that he went out of his way to talk to Iroha and compliment her cooking was really suspicious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure 8man will probably sexualize Yukino and Yui in the interlude volumes, he just didn't have time to do it in volume 11 because he was too focused on his actual relationships with them to worry about something as minor as his boner.</br>  <br>He'll keep sexualizing Yui because of her Yuis but he doesn't sexualize Yukino anymore since he seems completly focused on her beauty instead to think of anything like that.</br>  <br>What, a senpai looking after his imouto-tier kouhai is suspicious now? I ask you to reconsider this, my man, for this type of thinking is what lead to British men avoiding helping young children in distress in fear of being accused of being a paedo.<br><br>If you analyze it deeper I'm sure that Iroha and 8man interactions could literally happen with Komachi the same, and therefore remains entirely platonic.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm sure 8man will probably sexualize Yukino and Yui in the interlude volumes <br>My dad works for Yen Press.<br><br> he was too focused on his actual relationships with them to worry about something as minor as his boner. <br>The irony here is that you're calling their relationship platonic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I was using the term in a more generalized sense to include those.<br><br><br> The irony here is that you're calling their relationship platonic. <br> Romantic relationships are entirely defined by sexual arousal <br>nigga you can't actually be that dumb.<br><br> Holy shit i got a number captcha. Did I go back in time by accident or something? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That said, the statement itself isn't that important so much as what it's referring to. If it's referring to the rejection then the story is basically asking you to re-examine the rejection, as 8man is retroactively assigning significance to the scene from the beginning. To begin with, the fact that he went out of his way to talk to Iroha and compliment her cooking was really suspicious. <br>That's pretty much what I stated on that thread. He had no reason to just walk up to Iroha and praise her while she's doing her thing.<br><br>Even less reasons to say "too sweet" in the end if he's just done licking the remaining choco and when he loves sweet tasting stuff.<br> There is an argument to be made that the word 甘すぎ was never used in the chocolate discussion (嫌い was used instead) as well, so he probably is actually referring to her earlier rejection, thus making "naive" the correct definition. <br>I like this. Iroha herself asked him if he disliked the sweetness, but we know that she wasn't talking about the damned choco taste.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the fact that he went out of his way to talk to Iroha and compliment her cooking was really suspicious. <br>That was 100% onii-chan instincts. Everything else not so much, but his initial approach was very obviously just him playing the kind older brother.</br></br>  <br> What, a senpai looking after his imouto-tier kouhai is suspicious now? <br>You're ignoring this senpai is 8man, who avoids social interactions like the plague and vehemently denies any kind of positive relationship with Iroha whatsoever.<br><br>You're also ignoring the additional connotations to the compliment he went in with ("You're amazing") which Watari specifically created within the story.<br><br>Iroha immediately rejected him for a reason you know.<br><br> If you analyze it deeper I'm sure that Iroha and 8man interactions could literally happen with Komachi the same, and therefore remains entirely platonic. <br>If it were Komachi he'd say "I love you".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He'll keep sexualizing Yui because of her Yuis <br><br>I don't think so. Most of time 8man just bothered by her Yuis than sexualizing her because he knew how dangerous it is to him(possible make him out of control) and tries his best to avoid it.<br><br>Just like in this scene. <br><br> Isshiki pulled Yuigahama down and forced her body forward. The added effect of her body leaning forward emphasized her chest and the flickering glimpses of her skin from behind her flapping collars. In keeping my gaze from instinctively latching onto that view, I forcibly turned it away. I won’t lose! Humans won’t lose to things like desires! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But he only avoids them because he has been alone, Iroha is something different than just an acquaintance, she's like a second little sister to him -- and 8man is deep down is an amiable man whom if close to will definitely respond with some warmth as he does with double YY.</br>  <br>This general has deprived the ability for me to distinguish whether this is satire or not</br>  <br>That's because you've finally realized that there's legitimate arguments to be made for practically any argument about a character or relationship due to how consistently unclear or ambiguous the author is.</br>  <br>There is literally nothing in this<br> Isshiki pulled Yuigahama down and forced her body forward. The added effect of her body leaning forward emphasized her chest and the flickering glimpses of her skin from behind her flapping collars. In keeping my gaze from instinctively latching onto that view, I forcibly turned it away. I won’t lose! Humans won’t lose to things like desires! <br>That's not sexualized.  What the fuck dude, really? <br>You're blaming WW for being ambiguous even though you are literally retarded to not think that it's not sexualization</br></br></br></br>  <br>That means he still thinks of her Yuis as sexual and fears them as such.<br><br>This is what looking at someone's chest non-sexually looks like.<br> Stop it! Don’t squish Yukinon anymore! She already has to deal with the blowing wind that runs across the open fields of Kanto, namely, her chest! If you’re going to keep pressing her together like that, at least do it in an upwards-like manner! </br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure you believe in your opinions very strongly.<br><br>I however choose to understand that there are many different perspectives to be had on any topic and that any one of them could be correct.<br><br>There are times when you can analyze something further to gain a better understanding of it but in cases like this the knowledge gained is all but entirely irrelevant so it's simply not worth it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> legitimate arguments <br> posts 8man sexualizing Yui and say it's not him sexualizing Yui </br></br>  <br>Let's say that they are, Iroha still recognized it as 8man making a pass at her, and it was still significant enough that 8man was thinking about his rejection after the encounter. <br><br>Maybe now that Iroha is aware that 8man has an imouto he dotes on, she drew the connection between that and how he treats her. So when he compliments her, he calls them "sweet nothings", IE she recognizes that 8man's being non-genuine by being affectionate to her like an imouto, and she's telling him that she sees through it.<br><br>Here 8man fails to tsukkomi her rejection for the first time, and just sighs, and she shoves the spoon in his mouth. Maybe she thought he felt the rejection and did it to give him a pat on the back.<br><br>Then there's the chocolate conversation which is significant but I still am not really sure what she's referring to. If anything now it's even more unclear because she could be confirming 8man's feelings toward her, or she could be asking 8man to confirm his feelings toward her. It's really hard to say.<br><br>In any case the scene actually draws a huge parallel between 8man and Iroha, because it turns the tables and says that 8man's (intentionally or not) flirting with Iroha with Komachi as a pretense, whereas the usual interpretation is that Iroha flirts with 8man with Hayama as a pretense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally all knowledge is useless and irrelevant<br>That doesn't mean you should even remotely entertain retards like this </br></br>  <br> Romantic relationships are entirely defined by sexual arousal <br>Sexual desires are precisely what sets apart platonic and romantic love.</br></br>  <br> Literally all knowledge is useless and irrelevant <br>Interesting. What is your reasoning behind this statement.</br></br>  <br>I don't understand. Why did they make eye contact after sensei said that?</br>  <br>And yet there is still so much more to them than just sexual desire. It's almost as if romantic relationships aren't defined solely by that one factor.</br>  <br>They considered for a moment what they would do if they didn't have to fear the repercussions of their actions.<br><br>Really though it's probably just to reaffirm that they understood that sensei was talking about the service club's problems.</br></br></br>  IROHA OR DEATH !  <br> Literally all knowledge is useless and irrelevant <br> this i know btw </br></br>  <br> Iroha accuses 8man of being "sly" on multiple occasions <br><br> Iroha learns 8man has an imouto <br> immediately suspects he's a siscon <br> later gets 8man to declare being a siscon <br> this shows Iroha understands the nature behind how he treats her <br><br> 8man nonchalantly walks up to Iroha and calls her amazing for being able to cook <br> Iroha rejects 8man and calls his compliment "sweet nothings" -- In other words, Iroha rejects 8man for being non-genuine. <br> 8man sighs <br> Iroha shoves the spoon in his mouth to get his attention <br> Asks him if he likes sweetness <br> Asks him if he likes her sweetness/the kind in their relationship <br> 8man answers favorably to both <br> "Thanks for the reference" then immediately drops the conversation to talk to Hayama <br><br>I think I finally understand what happened there. Iroha called 8man out on being non-genuine, then makes him confirm his feelings, then gives him a taste of his own medicine (by pretending their flirting was a reference for Hayama) to show him how he's being "sly" to her.<br><br>Basically the conversation was Iroha saying that she's interested in 8man, but he needs to get his act together first. This is also consistent with how she encouraged him to be a publishing editor in 10.5. She likes him but doesn't want to enable a manchild. 8man's "甘すぎだな" shows that he was contemplating the exchange that took place, showing that she managed to get through to him at least on some level.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm not up for a philosophical debate<br>I'm just here to shitpost like everyone else</br></br></br>  <br>You wouldn't try to communicate such ideas unless you wanted them heard.</br>  <br>Scene was different in the LN.<br> “I see, then let me scold you properly.

But wait, that’s actually my goal all along… <br> While I was restless about various things, Yukinoshita looked perfectly calm. <br> “I don’t mind since I’ve never been scolded before.” <br> “Yukinoshita, being scolded isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It just means that someone’s looking out for you.” <br> Yukinoshita’s shoulders dropped slightly from Ms. Shiratsuka’s words. She lowered her head and looked downwards. I hadn’t the slightest idea if something had caught her eyes or not. <br> Ms. Hiratsuka gently patted Yukinoshita’s shoulder. <br> “I’m looking over you, so don’t worry and make all the blunders you want.” <br> We got off the taxi that drove us back and Ms. Hiratsuka began walking in the opposite direction of the hotel. <br> “I’m going to go buy some sake for a good drinking session. See you. Be careful on your way back.” <br> Is that really okay? <br> Ms. Hiratsuka waved her hands and we responded in the same fashion. Yukinoshita and I began walking towards the inn. We were both silent but I felt this was completely natural for the both of us. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yahari Ore no OVERANALYSIS Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru  <br>Yahari is the Monogatari of this generation.</br>  <br>The people that had no idea what happened in this show left ages ago so now we're stuck with faggots that analyze everything.

Why do they like talking about those things so much?” <br> W-What kind of conversation could that be… It wasn’t of any interest to me, but it felt like she’d get angry at me if I asked about it so I kept it to myself. Instead, times like this were where I should say something to ensure my well-being. <br> “Well, you should consider getting into it yourself if you’re going to get asked about it. Not a bad thing, right?” <br> “You talk like it has nothing to do with you. In the first place, during the Culture Festival, you…” <br> The stare that looked down on me turned into a sharp glare that pierced at me halfway through. <br> “M-Me…? No, wait.

Unlike before when we were walking around, with this much people around, it was really starting to feel stuffy. <br> “I’m guessing our next stops are going to be something like this.” <br> “……” <br> She didn’t say a word but I could already see from Yukinoshita’s discontent expression that she was starting to get fed up with the situation.

I want the shipfags to prove their genuine love for their waifu, mostly because I sort of can't understand how people can even like certain characters, and I'd bet I'm not the only one. So I'll go first. <br><br>I'm an Irohafag because I generally prefer younger girls, especially the fun flirty type that like to tease you. I literally can't into serious relationship but having someone to mess around with is pretty fun. I understand that people can fall into situations where until a certain point they can't choose between one person or the other. All those poorfag Iroha theories just sort of make me like her more, it contributes to her character in a way. I like the sweater she wears under her blazer and its long sleeves. I like the colors of her eyes and hair. I'm an absolute sucker for her VA.  The only girl I'd ever fallen in love with was basically an Iroha[/spoiler ]<br><br>Step it up, waifufags.</br></br> </br></br>    <br>Irohasu?

Episode 1 reached 16.9% (the current highest) and episode 2 only gave 12.3% <br> Main character, "Misa Misa" or Misa Amane's actress, bikini idol, Hinako Sano's (20) portrayal has been attributed to the cause. <br> Netizens scream in chorus, "Busa Busa"! <br>(Translation note: "Busa" is shorthand for "Busaiku" which means, clumsy or bland.)<br>"Misa Misa" was introduced since the drama started. In the original comics, "Misa Misa" is seen as a cute and slender girl, and many Netizens are claiming Hinako Sano is quite the contrary even though she is a bikini idol. In addition, they claim her face simply does not match and thus have started claiming in large numbers, "This isn't Misa Misa, this is Busa Busa!"<br><br>What does /a/ think of it so far?<br><br>http://news.livedoor.com/article/de<wbr>tail/10392805/</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's funny because he is supposed to be American, so it makes sense.</br>  That's what they get for drawing white people and claiming they're Japanese. No wonder they can't find a fitting actress.  I'm finding it pretty hard to believe people can feel strongly about Misa when she was pretty much a retarded pawn.  <br><br>There's usually one drama general</br></br>  <br>Fuck off Ireland.</br>   he didn't read Steve Jobs: The Manga    Reading the manga when you can watch the anime   <br><br>Steve did nothing wrong.</br></br>  thanks for the heads up      <br> 3, 2, 1, dead </br>  Is... is this real?  <br> caring about a scum of this earth misanthrope miser </br>  <br> Crabing <br> Crabs are the animal sign of cancer <br> Steve Jobs died from cancer <br><br>Aria was pretty redpilled</br></br></br></br></br>  Why some people said Steve Job is a psychopath?  <br>http://slated.org/good_riddance_ste<wbr>ve_jobs</wbr></br>  Steve Jobs was an autistic poser who threw childish hissy fits.  <br>fuckin nips need to learn to read actual books<br><br><br> crabing <br>triggered triggered triggered</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He supported a system of sweatshop labor and earned the most profits in the history of mankind by then using extremely aggressive marketing(i.e brainwashing) to charge people 500 dollars plus for something worth maybe total 30 dollars. <br>He literally invented the term 'designer electronics'. Now, as to if this is really a bad thing after all thats up for discussion, but many many many people suffered and still suffer because of apple.</br></br>  Get out.  <br><br><br><br>no way this is real</br></br></br></br>  Does it explain the origin of his turtleneck sweater?  <br> On a trip to Japan in the early 1980s, Jobs asked Sony's chairman Akio Morita why everyone in the company's factories wore uniforms. He told Jobs that after the war, no one had any clothes, and companies like Sony had to give their workers something to wear each day. Over the years, the uniforms developed their own signatures styles, especially at companies such as Sony, and it became a way of bonding workers to the company. "I decided that I wanted that type of bonding for Apple," Jobs recalled. <br> Sony, with its appreciation for style, had gotten the famous designer Issey Miyake to create its uniform. It was a jacket made of rip-stop nylon with sleeves that could unzip to make it a vest. So Jobs called Issey Miyake and asked him to design a vest for Apple, Jobs recalled, "I came back with some samples and told everyone it would great if we would all wear these vests. Oh man, did I get booed off the stage. Everybody hated the idea." <br> In the process, however, he became friends with Miyake and would visit him regularly. He also came to like the idea of having a uniform for himself, both because of its daily convenience (the rationale he claimed) and its ability to convey a signature style. "So I asked Issey to make me some of his black turtlenecks that I liked, and he made me like a hundred of them." Jobs noticed my surprise when he told this story, so he showed them stacked up in the closet. "That's what I wear," he said. "I have enough to last for the rest of my life." </br></br></br>  <br> he showed them stacked up in the closet. "That's what I wear," he said. "I have enough to last for the rest of my life." </br>  <br>Oh wow, that's pretty interesting.<br> It was a jacket made of rip-stop nylon with sleeves that could unzip to make it a vest <br>Kinda like those cargo pants that has zips around the knees that dads like to wear? Good lord.</br></br></br>  <br>80s Jobs was a really weird dude tbh.<br><br>Time he spent building NeXT and Pixar after getting fired from Apple taught him a lot of things, I suppose.</br></br></br>  <br>And yet 1000 times better than rms.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jsk<wbr>q3-lpQnE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br> Steve Jobs <br> not manga about Lord Richard Matthew Stallman <br><br>are you even GNU anon?</br></br></br></br>  fuck off of my board cancer  <br> for the rest of my life." <br><br>So he had 3 turtlenecks?</br></br></br>  <br>It said he made about a hundred of them, can you not read?</br>  <br>he also loved retarded patents so he could sue everyone he could<br>for things like rounded corners and other shit.</br></br>  I'd rather read the Bill Gates manga.  <br>Based Bill</br>  <br>Now I want a Xerox manga.

I'll slobber your cock like I love you! </br></br>  <br>It's hard to do away with them since this being 4chan it's significantly harder to land a left hook on them, so the most intelligent thing to do is ignore them and go about your business, denying them the attention they're starving for.</br>  <br> secret shirt <br>aight to the ignored waifu list it goes</br></br>  <br> All these cuties <br><br>Damn, Kobeni looks really cute here, thanks for including her in this!

The generals have gotten to the point that they're only bearable on the weekend when so many people are out of them.

(RIP Neptunefag ;_;)</br>  <br>People just need to stop responding to obvious bait.<br><br>Is it that hard to just not fucking talk about shit? Request and go do something else, the ones who shitpost are the ones who don't have anything else do to, hence they shitpost here, just don't respond</br></br></br>  <br>This is the whole problem, even if it is your waifu, who the fuck are you to control her over everyone else?<br><br>It's completely asinine on an anonymous image board for us to be trying to claim personal dominance over waifus, unless we're going to all start putting trips on.</br></br></br>  <br>Why would this week be bad for Etnafag?</br>  <br> It's a secret <br><br>4 years, 3 months and 27 days.</br></br></br>  <br> no hate <br>disappointing.</br></br>  <br>This is what confuses me the most. There's a shitload of fun things to do on the internet for free to pass the time and people still choose to shitpost here?</br>  <br><br>If you're attempting to logically reason with the sorts of people who believe that sort of action is right, I'd suggest you don't bother. They're set in their ways.</br></br>  <br>February marked two years that seemed to flash by in mere weeks.</br>  pic related, me and my waifu me on the left  <br>Most of the time they don't ignore the shitposting though, actually this weekend every instance of it was given attention</br>  <br><br>Shitposting can be a major source of entertainment if you rile up the right people.</br></br>  <br>If you're going to request your disgusting little fetishes involving my waifu I will gladly go out of my way to tell you to fuck off or kill yourself. You don't like it, don't post your shit where I can see it.</br>  <br>Akiyama Mio, met her 2.5 years ago.<br> And meeting her was one of the best things that ever happened to me. </br></br>  <br>love is a strange and powerful emotion that shouldn't be mocked</br>  <br>Are you saying we must put on trips?</br>  <br>oop haha forgot pic!!!</br>  <br>It was such an obvious bait I'm not sure why do you even defend it.<br> Broke up with my signifigant other today <br><br> 1433529765164.png </br></br></br></br>  <br>7 months, didn't know until a few months after her show aired that I loved her.</br>  <br> even if it is your waifu, who the fuck are you to control her over everyone else? <br>Someone who loves her more than life itself and refuses to let any shitposting mongoloids act like they know the first thing about her when they only request her for porn. Fuck yourself if you think anyone's in the wrong for telling cancer disrespecting their waifu to fuck off. I can promise you you would change your opinion inmediately if someone started doing it to you. The only people who don't understand why someone would want scumbags posting their waifu to die are those who don't have to deal with it.</br></br>  <br>I was the person who wrote original Ryuko request. I didn't mean for that to end up being bait. I feel like I accidentally set a building on fire. <br><br>The black hawks Ryuko poster was not me.</br></br></br>  <br>If you really are someone requesting and not some bait, you honestly came at the wrong time.</br>  <br>I wouldn't have an issue if every request of her in the general wasn't lewd and using my ref.<br><br>It's one thing to ask for a picture, another thing entirely for fetish shit requests.</br></br></br>  <br> two years </br>  <br>I could tell I did something wrong when I came back to see 8 replies.

Rather than throwing a giant shitfit, I never interfered with his requests. When I tried making a request of my own, people piled all over me because how dare I make a request for "someone else's waifu". And no, it wasn't fetish shit either.<br><br>Your entire argument falls apart because I'm not allowed to request anything involving my waifu, who I absolutely love, because of somebody else bitching. The hell? If he wants to request her, that's fine, but this entire thing is stupid if we're going to try and argue about who has "permission" to request waifus.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Anon, I told you: <br><br>It will devolve into unfalsifiable claims of "Only I am worthy of loving my waifu" or "I deserve/love my waifu more than anyone else". I'm warning you now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>People like that really have to come to terms to the fact that they are powerless to stop someone from requesting what they want unless they are a mod or janitor.</br>  <br>What part of "fuck off, dunkfag" is not in plain English? Fuck. Off. Dunkfag.</br>  <br>Just did this very quick.

Kogami gets wrekt all throughout the movie, and Ghost Shogo appears to call him a useless faggot.<br><br>Movie seems like an obvious set-up for season 3. Kogami needs to stop playing at war and actually go all in on his ideals against Sybil Enabler.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The army wasn't immune, they just cheated the readings since sybil left ahole in the code to permit them to do so.<br>The real shit is really that NOT one character was immune to the readings.<br>Like i have to believe that the colonel that killed people with absolutely no reaction or the black mercenary aren't psychopaths and have their stress levels raise when they kill, of course.</br></br></br>  So why the fuck did Kogami go after the black mercenary dude at the end?<br><br>Literally what did that accomplish?</br></br>  HOLY FUCK<br>Was Akane's friend always this god damn sexy?</br>  <br>They gave her a bit of an upgrade.</br>  <br>he god mad<br>even dead shougo mocked him</br></br>  Absolutely nothing.<br>It was not even a test of his own strength since they had to take him two vs one.<br>Also, he was exactly what he should've been looking for, someone like Shogo, a free man following only his instincts that could pose a threat to Sybil system, the one that took away their friend to protect the hyper oatz+ collection of psychopatic brains.<br>No one even care that Sybil fucking killed their friends anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>Any link for just the audio file?</br>  <br>I was expecting full nips, but seeing Akane's side-akanes was pretty good.</br>  <br>It accomplished nothing.

Even then, they're pretty generic merc stereotypes.</br></br></br>  <br>This has good filename potential.</br>  <br>I think it was motivation to keep going. The scene before finding that mercenary was Shogo saying he has no motivation unless he's chasing prey.</br>   Kougami getting rekt so hard by ghost Makishima he starts shooting at nothing   <br> rekt by Akane in the CQC struggle <br> rekt by Spooky Boogie Shogo <br> rekt by a nigger <br> rekt by Gino <br>This whole movie was just Kougami getting rekt</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Poor guy got his ass handed to him by everyone.

The religious obsession with virginity traces back to men wanting to be certain that the babies their wives give birth to - and therefore their heirs - are actually theirs. And there's always been far more forgiveness for men going and getting laid before getting married than for women getting laid before getting married.<br><br>So no consistent belief, definite bias, prejudice and ulterior motives.<br><br>Otaku "purity" is still worse, of course, since it obsesses with the virginal status of either idols (who otaku have exactly zero change of actually getting with) or women who only exist as drawings.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What made that?<br><br>What is the Unmoved mover?</br></br></br>    <br>The universe before that.<br>Why must there be a foundational beginning?

You're making a bunch of unnecessary assumptions. There would be no need for a 'maker' if something simply always existed.<br>A line segment has a beginning and an end. A line itself doesn't.

How can a cycle begin without prompt?</br>  <br>Text your microwave and find out.</br>  <br>Why do you assume there needs to be a prompt?

Things just don't happen, they're prompted by previous actions.<br><br>That's how the entire universe works, so why wouldn't it work on a universal scale?</br></br></br></br>  A lot of underage in this thread.  <br><br> indecisive agnostic <br> into cuckshit (not decisive enough to stop bitch from being stolen) <br><br>Why am I not surprised?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> stolen <br>that's not how cucking works.</br></br>  <br>Now there's a good question. I must admit I have only a barebones layman's understanding of thermodynamics and entropy and the like, so I likely won't be of much use with it. But I assume it's possible entropy just gets lower and lower the farther back in time you go? It'd be like a limit process, you keep approaching zero farther back you go, but never quite reach it.<br>That or Entropy as a concept is restricted to this universe, or resets with each universe. I dunno.<br><br><br>Sure, but we're talking about the cycle of actions prompting each other itself. Let's look at it a different way. Assume there's a beginning action. Then that beginning action, by your own statement, would have had to have a previous action to cause it. Thus it's not the beginning action.<br>Therefore there can be no beginning.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Its actually disgusting. His wife has no regard for his feelings and has basically twisted the spineless man into being under her thumb. Hes so deep into denial he built up a whole story behind it. <br><br>Its not even a healthy open relationship, she disappeared several times and made him super worried. There's no even trade or anything</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> implying that wasn't ghost-written by a lonely old cat lady. </br></br></br>  <br>What</br>  I simply give no fucks about purity or impurity. I'm not a chemist or anything, so the properties of that sort of thing is irrelevant.  <br>Consider this, for a moment: We have explanations and models for everything in the universe, but not for the universe itself. Wouldn't that imply that perhaps our perception of a universe is wrong? Things exist on a spacetime background that's expanding at an accelerating rate. There's nothing to suggest that the universe is even a valid concept to consider, and even the definition of the "universe" doesnt acknowledge what it is, and if it's even a thing.</br>  <br>Why is she so accidentally sexual</br>  <br>Man I hope so.<br>Quite likely it's legit though, sadly.</br></br>  <br>By what mechanism does this reset happen?</br>  <br>Considering the "gentleman" makes reference to drowning his sorrows in wine and the writing style is distinctly feminine, it's highly unlikely that a man actually wrote this garbage. <br><br>Or maybe it was moot.</br></br></br>  <br> That or Entropy as a concept is restricted to this universe, or resets with each universe. I dunno <br><br>That or each iteration of the universe has less accessible energy, meaning that eventually the rebirth of the universe would be smaller and smaller until it ended entirely, meaning it's only a cycle for a period of time.<br> <br><br><br>Presupposition of a big crunch</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what I thought at first, but then I reverse searched the article and I found out that it's real.</br>  <br>All right then. God created the Universe.<br><br>God can't have always existed, something had to have created God. Who created God? What ever created God, couldn't have always existed either, something else must have created that. And that thing couldn't have always existed either, who created that? And who created that?<br><br>You see?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't bring God into this.<br><br>Some initial incident took place somewhere, by something completely alien to this universe, perhaps collisions of other universes.<br><br>That brings us back to you, and the search for the unmoved mover. <br><br>We'd have to find out what made those and what made the thing that made them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Presupposition of a big crunch <br><br>There are no known physics through which the universe will contract. The standard cosmological model indicates the universe will expand infinitely.<br><br><br> That's what I thought at first, but then I reverse searched the article and I found out that it's real. <br><br>May God have mercy on our souls if that nonsense catches on. Mercy on our souls or popcorn.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then the Zoroastrians were right.</br>   Ever masturbating to your waifu   <br>If god made the universe than what made god?</br>  <br>A bigger God.</br>  <br>Turtles all the way down?</br>  <br> God can't have always existed <br><br>This is a non-starter, time came into existence the same moment the universe did, ergo there is no "always" absent the universe making the objection nonsensical. God existed logically and causally prior to the universe outside time.<br><br> Who created God? <br><br>Divine aseity has been a well-understood concept in philosophy for a few thousand years. There's nothing illogical about an uncaused first cause.<br><br> You see? <br><br>An actual infinite regression is metaphysically absurd.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All the way down to the bottom, yes.<br><br>Then there's the biggest turtle that we're currently unable to see.</br></br></br>  <br>That's a pretty big God.</br>  <br> Trying to understand divinity when you are only a mortal </br>  <br> 4u </br>  <br>I always knew there was a reason I was drawn to those Zoroastrian girls.</br>  <br>But anon, if it's turtles all the way down then how is there a bottom? It has to go all the way right?</br>  <br>All the way to the bottom, yes.</br>  <br>If there were no bottom, all the turtles would be falling</br>  <br>oh my god this shit is amazing.<br>http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/07/wha<wbr>t-open-marriage-taught-one-man-abou<wbr>t-feminism.html</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Who says there is gravity where the turtles are?<br>An object at rest stays at rest. They are unmoving.</br></br>    <br> There's nothing illogical about an uncaused first cause. <br>And that is quantum fluctuations in the singularity. Gods are not parsimonious, and the big bounce hypothesis is incorrect.</br></br>  <br> Who says there is gravity where the turtles are? <br>The fact that the turtles can be stacked on each other.<br><br>Even if the were placed there without gravity, the act of placing them would cause the previous one to move, and keep moving due to the lack of anything stopping it, downward. <br><br>This begs the question, is moving downward the same as falling?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And that is quantum fluctuations in the singularity <br><br>Whence cometh these quantum fluctuations? Whence cometh anything that could have quantum fluctuations?<br><br>The standard model indicates clearly that quite literally nothing temporally preceded the big bang, however things don't simply spring uncaused out of nothing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And that is quantum fluctuations in the singularity <br>But before that the Singularity was stable?<br><br>Is it like an egg, then?<br><br>If so, what laid it?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I FUCKING KNEW IT<br>She's all talk and no substance.<br>All bark and no bite.<br>Anyone with half a brain would know Anna was the real pervert.</br></br></br>  <br> What if MC is just hung like a daikon with a big veiny monster? <br>There's no "if" to it, have you seen the opening?</br></br>  Is this shit on baka-tsuki? or just got to spoil the shit out of me in any shitty wikia?  <br>The opening spoil that shit you dumbass.</br>  <br>Last try</br>  <br>Can someone answer me for the love of god?</br>  Have you finished that backlog already?   having an anime backlog <br>please</br>  Is this the new dubs thread  <br>Still working on it.</br>  No Im@s thread; then lets make one.<br><br>Did /a/ enjoy the top cake?</br></br>  <br><br>Because the current show's focus is far too widespread among different idols.<br><br>They should just make Rin be the main character. <br><br>That would have made for a much better show. <br><br>Better than wasting time on Giantess Autist, Hipster Rock Autist, Goth Chuuni Autist, Illegal Immigrant Ruskie, lolis and shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  Are ML girls allowed?  <br>There are some lewd Rins in that pic.</br>  <br> lolis <br>They didn't waste 5 minutes with them altogether, not even with Dekoration episode.</br></br>   His name is Sebas Tian   <br>Ignored the min max so he can roleplay a spooky skeleton litch overlord. I can respect that.</br>  <br> More like Sebased.</br>   edgy spooklord wants to conquer the world <br> kills people every five minutes and don't feel nothing <br> has army of servants/slaves preprogrammed to love him unconditionally <br>Chuuni as fuck.. so this is even worse than Log Horizon?</br></br></br>  <br>Ruling the world isn't really a priority for him, though.</br>  <br><br><br> yfw they do this to burst out on their own. </br></br></br>  Digimon Fest is Saturday so mark your calendars anons, it will be here soon.<br><br>Two things were tweeted out today, one from Bandai and the other from a twitter user who got his 15th anniversay digivice today.<br><br>First the image tweeted out from Bandai reads "From now on, I want you to protect the Digital World for us" followed previously by the line "A gif for you to inherent courage." Second the twitter user who tweeted about reciving his 15th anniversay digivice also recived a flyer for the 15th anniversary D3 digivice model.<br><br>Now I'm not saying 02 confirmed but thete I a high chance that the 02 kids may show up in Tri.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just wait for someone uploads some of it on youtube.</br>  <br>Yeah, it sucks. Nico's the only site hosting raws of Duel Masters S1, but you have to pay to view them, AND must be in Japan.<br><br>I just want to see if they really censored Mimi, that's all.</br></br></br>  <br> censored Mimi <br><br>Wha? Why?</br></br></br>  <br>Someone will stream it in another live streamer site like he did in digimon tri announcement, I hope.</br>  Who else here is going to be stupid and buy this?</blockquote>]
