[ Will there be an S2 or was this all just bait to get us to buy the lightnovels?  They completely rushed through the novels.<br><br>You'll be waiting a long time for more novels to come out so they can make another season.</br></br>  I was surprised to see the first 2 novels in English the other day.  definitely bait. they were pushing the ln hard just before this aired.  <br> was this all just bait to get us to buy the lightnovels? <br>It's always a bait to buy the LNs. Even if they make a second season.</br></br>  <br>Not enough source material. Seeing the pacing at least 4 volume is needed 4 second season.</br>  s2 as in loki and her marry band  <br>Might be. This season was pretty popular, relatively speaking, and moving massive amounts of the LN.</br>  with all my heart and soul i hope there will be.  <br>if theres no s2 i dont see why they even bothered having an s1 since nothing fucking happened</br>  <br>If they do, S2 will be pure shit. The pacing and interesting parts of the series takes a massive nosedive. Nothing really happens, just Bell blushing a lot and being a pussy</br>  Freedom descending to Earth and kick everyone ass.

Not everything is pure strength.  UBW is weak with less kicking power, but faster reload speed.<br>GoB has more kicking alot more "power", but a slower reload speed.</br>  It's almost like the Fate series isn't very good or something.  <br>Because plot (armor).</br>  Nasu is a hack who likes to make arbitrary rules.  <br><br>Stop making shit up. UBW clearly counters Gil's swords with mirrors of themselves, meaning the strength is equal.</br></br>  <br> &gt;It's the nasuverse. Everything is pure shit. <br><br>Helped you out there.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Kill yourself, pleb.</br></br>   muh cast time <br> muh not serious Gil <br> muh weapon mastery <br> muh gaiah marble </br></br></br>  <br>Shirou can only get close to perfect replicas in UBW, so no, it is not equal strength. This is why Shirou can't just sword spam Gil to death and has to get in close for the kill (well, that and his mana)</br>   Electric type pokemon is able to knockout the shit out of any pokemon with his electric attacks <br> Basically the strongest pokemon <br> Ground type pokemon is able to perfectly counter his electric attack and knockout him <br> somehow not very strong </br></br></br>  <br><br> likes Fate <br> calls other plebs <br><br>I just don't know anymore.</br></br></br></br></br>  Nasuverse fights are always all about compatibility.  Gil a shit.  <br> using pokemon as an example of matchup <br>I suppose you also think Mega-Rayquaza isn't broken either, huh</br></br>  <br> Shirou swings projected sword against Gil's sword <br> They both shatter <br><br>Wrong. Try again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why? For not liking a series that gets ok at best?</br>  <br><br>If they're strong enough to knock away their counterparts, then their strength is equal, simple as that. <br><br><br>Your analogy is fucking shit because in UBW, Sandslash is using Thunder against Raichu and winning, faggot.<br><br><br>What compatibility? Shirou and Archer can defeat Gilgamesh by MIRRORING his attacks with identical versions of them. Stands to reason their powers and his are identical, outside EA and Enkidu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   his power is to summon swords <br>Literally the least interesting and least intimidating superpower (despite its power) ever created for an antagonist.</br>  <br> can't even handle 64 GoB spam <br>Go back to your lake.</br></br>  <br>It's not just swords.</br>  <br>The round table seems to be Gil counter. No EA Gil would lose to Lancelot according to Julian, and Gawain already beat him in CCC.</br>  <br>This isn't about who has the highest power level. It's basically rock, paper, scissors. Gil is able to take down almost any servant because he's able to pull out the weakness for every servant. Weapons that killed them? he has it. Weapons with the same affinity? he has them.<br>However, he's not a master of the weapon, he's an owner. He can't use the weapon's full potential. If Saber and Him fought with the same sword and only that, he'd lose. <br>Archer/Shirou is he greatest enemy because they have something similar to his treasury. Hell, it's even better.</br></br></br>  <br> implying Lancelot with A+ agility can simply get out of line of fire </br>  <br>It's cool when you think that he can very well summon the perfect (or close to perfect) mirror of the very weapon that was used to kill heroic spirits. THAT is what makes him powerful.</br>  <br><br>Exactly, so why is Archer considered much weaker? Why does shirou think his swordspam would not work, when it's identical to Gil's, and Gil's has proven to work more than well enough? They have the same weapons, but infinite numbers of them.</br></br>  <br> Kayneth entry in the Zero Materials <br> Now Prisma Illya also confirming it <br><br>The Gilfags literally only had the 32 NPs quote that supposedly applied to everyone during the 4th War and that was proven wrong by Iskander surviving 80 and a shit Shirou Saber surviving 47. Gilfags have literally nothing to back up their claim about GoB winning.</br></br></br></br>  Because any non retard would rush Archer down before he can complete the ubw chant, which nobody in-universe seems to think of.  <br> Exactly, so why is Archer considered much weaker? <br>Because he's a weaker spirit than Gil.</br></br>  <br> Iskander surviving <br>Did you watch/read the series?</br></br>  <br>It's technically not better. UBW is great on its own merits but for more general purposes, GOB is stronger.<br><br>It's just that UBW is valued even higher when matched directly against GoB due to its superior match up.</br></br></br>  <br>Since when did Iskander have Battle Continuation? He survived the barrage and was killed by EA.<br>Nevermind Lancelot was later said to be Gil archnemesis like a volume after the 32 NPs comment.</br></br>  <br>No, it's not better. Swordspam is just a nuisance against top-tier servants in the first place, and Emiya's isn't that impressive.</br>  <br>This still baffles me. Archer's UBW supposedly is like GoB only better. Gil shits on almost everyone with it and is considered a big bad moffo while Archer is considered weak but skilled. By all meaning Archer should stomp any Servant Gil could.</br>  When will Fate threads go back to being as fun as during and prior to Fate/Zero? I'm tired of the endless shitfests over autistic details.  <br> survived the barrage <br>With lots of weapons stabbed into him. Even without Ea, Gil could have used any of his weapons to kill him.</br></br>  <br>That's when shit gets interesting.</br>  <br>UBW cost shit ton, needs to be cast and limited by time limit due to upkeep.<br><br>GOB is cheap to use and can be opened all day everyday.<br><br>On the other hand, if UBW is deployed, it's Archer's win barring against a Saber, Lancer or to an extent Berserker class.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So if Archer can out-spam the best Servant, doesn't that make him the best Servant instead?<br><br>Or is this one of those bullshit "The grail/the user/the era" things are holding him back.</br></br></br>  The only servant he murders the shit out of with just swordspam is a Caster who doesn't know he's there and an Assassin who doesn't know he's there.  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>The reality marble is on a time limit, the Phantasms are ranked down, he's limited to blades and doesn't have GoB sheer versatility, and to top it off any Servant worth a damn can neutralize swordspam for short periods. Gil can keep spamming stronger NPs spamming for days. Emiya can't.</br>  <br>I think Shirou and Archer are better with their hometown dual blades, possibly enough to be considered a master of them. UBW is great for the tracing &amp; reproduction of unlimited swords, but they only wield the blades.<br><br>In the end, UBW and GoB were evenly matched. But IIRC Shirou won with the two blades.</br></br></br>  <br>Lots of weapons, no weapons at all, doesn't change shit. He survived the barrage, he was not killed by GoB, which is the entire point of the Gilshits. And there is also Shirou Saber surviving 47.<br><br> Berserker as his Servant also had the mysterious ability of being able to seize others' Noble Phantasms, considerably the arch-nemesis of Archer. <br>That was a volume after the 32 NPs comment.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yea, Meant it being better when up against GoB. The second Gil readies some weapons, Shirou can instantly copy them and add it to UBW. It's not something he can do with a servant who has only one weapon that they've mastered. <br><br><br>You do know Archer took out 6 of Berserker's lives right? But Archer can only make swords. Gil has shit other than swords. It's just affinity. Gil and Archer have similar weapons, but they AREN'T the same.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With UBW deployed the only Servants you can decisively claim he beats are pretty shit, aside from standard Gil. He just doesn't have the firepower.</br>  <br>Are you familiar with the concept of rock paper scissors, it might help</br>  <br>It's still shit though. It's the nasuhack equivalent of "MY POWER IS TO MAINTAIN THE TEMPERATURE OF OBJECTS I TOUCH", only dangerous because there's this one weapon that can instant kill.</br>  <br>There's also EA, which seems to have a huge amount of power I don't understand fully. It murdered the shit out of Rider, and stopped the grail from claiming Gil the first time around.</br>  <br> Gil uses Rock <br> Gil beats everyone with Rock <br> Archer copies rock <br> Archer beats him with rock <br> Somehow archer can't beat anyone with Rock <br><br>Go fuck yourself you smug apologist parrot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about Heroic Spirits that were never defeated or killed in battle?</br>  <br> I don't understand fully <br>Ea is an Anti-world Noble Phantasm meaning it contains the power to end the world.</br></br>  <br>So GoB is stronger than UBW but at the same time they're both evenly matched when face to face. <br><br>Fucking Nasu and his mental gymnastics.</br></br></br>  <br>Bruh that's the entire point of why UBW beat Gil. Shirou (read: Archer) only lost to himself. He lost his will.</br>  <br>Of course.<br> Arturia dragon mama core owner of the Excalibur  <br> Lancelot : most skilled in his era with owning Arondight <br> Gawain invincible under the sun owning Excalibur Galatine  <br>Are the top 3 players in the round table.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>NASU IS A  HACK <br>That's all you need to remember. He just wants to make it seem like Shirou is a weak piece of shit. People argue that because Shirou's swords are somewhat weaker than the originals that they're worthless against other servants, but the fakes are strong enough to completely cancel out the originals, and they're even faster. The only time that the downgrade would ever come into play is against Berserker Hercules, but he can just beat him with Sabers help as long as he projects Caliburn.</br></br>  <br>Makes you wonder why, instead of trying to harness the power of uncontrollable and unpredictable grail, Gil didn't just use EA.<br><br>Fuckin' idiot.</br></br></br>  <br>It's more like Gil is rock, every other Heroic Spirit worth their salt is scissors, and Emiya is paper if he can even deploy UBW.</br>  1) because to swordspam on the level that Gilgamesh can, Archer has to deploy UBW, which requires him to recite an eight verse lyric, which is exceptionally difficult to do while getting your ass beat into the pavement up close and personal with an enemy servant like Lancer or Saber.<br><br>2) because Archer's swordspam is so shitty that Shirou with a crappily traced Kanshou and Byakuya and none of Archer's skills yet can single-handedly deflect all of the incoming 17 swords as seen in the anime. Note that this is still one more sword than Gilgamesh's barrage fired at Lancelot, which Lancelot himself barely managed to deflect. The difference in raw power is obvious between Gate of Babylon and UBW.<br><br>3) "if Shirou's swordspam is so much worse than Gilgamesh's why does it still deflect his spam?" Because if you throw a bullet train at a steam train, regardless of the difference in their momentum, both are going to get derailed when they impact. It's the quantity of counterspam that is important - if Gilgamesh's ridiculous firepower comes from his ability to fight like an army, then just having a similar ability to neutralize the 'army' factor of his strength is enough to throw him off and even the odds for a punk kid like Shirou.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That would take too much work.</br>  Let's just all agree that Arturia is a shit king and servant  Girugamesh is nerfed by his own arrogance.  <br>Because you're a moron who didn't pay attention. He wanted to use the grail as a selection method.<br><br>And in HF, he was willing to do it himself.</br></br></br>  <br>I think Rider AND Gil made that evident. It's easy to forget, but they had what, 2-3 episodes before their fight merely dedicated to showing why Arturia's ideals are stupid?</br>  <br>He's not actually a Heroic Spirit so his base is shit. When he actually is doing what he is supposed to, he's effective.</br>  <br> forgetting that Shirou went up against more GoB spam then Hercules or Lancelot and he was winning </br>  <br>Best Girl<br>Best King<br>Best Servant<br>Best Girl</br></br></br></br>   Gil has weapons that other servants are weak to so he's the strongest. <br><br>Then Archer/Shirou should curbstomp everything since they traced Gil's entire armory.<br><br>You wanna know the real reason why they are "weak"? Because people love an underdog story even if logically it doesn't make sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you read the various character materials and interviews, you'd know that Gen himself called Iskander a drunken fool who was good at bullshitting. His arguments against Arturia were just loud bullying - to think that he was in any way right is nonsense.</br></br>  <br>He is a Heroic Spirit. He's just shit.</br>  <br>Which is bullshit, because Emiya's "paper" is a fucking rock.</br>  <br>Wait for Heaven's Feel where paper beats scissors.</br>  <br>They weren't correct at all though. All 3 of them had different views that were entirely different. There was nothing really wrong with Sabers ideals, no more than Iskandar or Gil's.</br>  <br>Hercules wasn't fighting against GoB spam he was defending loli from GoB spam.</br>  <br>or Lancer because Protection against arrows and battle continuation, or Rider because "Cybele, GG"</br>  <br>Truly a best</br>  why do they call him archer if he spams swords?<br>what's even the fucking deal with swords in this series? was this the best thing the writers could come up with for their magic?</br>  <br><br>Any servant can block one-by-one shots from GoB like what happens there right up until Shirou traces a bunch of swords to counter the wave that would have killed him if not for his own swordspam. Every time Heracles got hit, it was when more than one shot was flying at him at once and he had no way to block or dodge all of them simultaneously. It's also why Lancelot deflecting and dodging 16 noble phantasms that were fired simultaneously is such a huge deal.</br></br>  <br>Why the fuck would he do that? The Grail is perfect since it represents humanity wishes, it doesn't get his Ea dirty, and it's not like he wants to get rid of all of humanity. Just the useless ones. Back when he was alive every person had value. You couldn't just kill a slave because that would seriously hurt the kingdom's growth. Unlike the modern world where he considers humanity in excess.</br>  <br>It makes perfect sense. You're just obnoxiously refusing to consider the multiple reasons for why GoB is superior to UBW against other Servants. And no, they don't and will never have Gil's entire armory in UBW, don't be retarded.</br>  <br>It's hard to do this with a rock-paper-scissors argument.<br><br>Gil specializes in killing heroic spirits because he can materialize a near-perfect copy of the very weapon that killed said spirit. <br><br>Emiya as a spirit was never killed by another. He mentally killed himself when he lost his hopes and dreams of making the lives of everyone else better.<br><br>That's why he's perfect for killing Gil. Not only does he not have a specific weakness, but his strength is in tracing magic, which is perfect to create mirrors of infinitely many swords.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Lancelot himself barely managed to deflect. <br> barely <br>He was having an easy time, enough to keep swapping weapons when he wanted. Read the Kayneth part of the Zero Material and Prisma Illya, Lancelot is confirmed to be better than GoB Gil. Thinking someone that's said to be a strong enemy and called Gil arch-nemesis based on a single comment that was proven wrong twice is laughable.</br></br></br>  <br> Gil has weapons that other servants are weak to so he's the strongest. <br>Gil has things other than swords in his Treasury you know. Like the Chain he uses against Hercules.</br></br>  <br>I suppose. He wanted to get rid of excess humanity and revert the world to a point in time where everyone served a purpose.<br><br>Still, looked like the grail's lava-esque curses were going to literally destroy the entire world. It burned down an entire city and left ONE survivor in FZ (oddly enough, the same survivor KILLED Gil). <br>It doesn't seem to me like much, if any, of humanity was going to survive the grail. Perhaps it's explained a bit more in the VN and I have a more shallow understanding for not having read it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Either way, it doesn't matter. Shirou went up against more GoB spam than anyone else and he came out on top. GoB is in no way stronger than UBW.<br><br>Gil was firing hundreds of NP's at Shirou in that fight, and Shirou was countering and blocking every single one. Gil was firing them so fast out of the GoB that it sounded like a machine gun firing, he even fired at Shirou from every angle at once and Shirou still came out on top.</br></br></br>  <br>Archer class implies ranged weapons. EMIYA and Gil both use swords at a ranged distance so they fall under that class.<br><br>It's a broad as fuck definition so practically any hero can be thrown in that class</br></br></br>  <br> Prisma Illya <br><br>Ignoring how retarded the premise for your argument is, that wasn't Gilgamesh. Or even Lancelot, for that matter.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He wasn't swapping weapons whenever he wanted to, he swapped weapons because the ones he was using were breaking under the stress of deflecting all those hits at once. Jesus Christ.</br></br>  <br>This. It's hard to see Shirou as an underdog when he can make the strongest guy around to look like a joke.</br>  <br>Technically, Saber class also includes axe and other close range weapon users.</br>  <br> Gil specializes in killing heroic spirits because he can materialize a near-perfect copy of the very weapon that killed said spirit.  <br><br>So can Archer, since tracing is kind of his thing. Inb4 one rank degradation, broken phantasm.</br></br></br>  <br>Which is why it's incorrect to say he has the perfect sword for everyone. He has the best "weapon" to counter nearly every heroic spirit.</br>  <br>It was confirmed that Lancelot was fucked if Tokiomi hadn't used a command seal to stop Gil.</br>  <br>He does had a point, though and it was enough to make Saber question herself. Not enough, unfortunately.</br>  <br><br> Gil was firing hundreds of NP's at Shirou in that fight, and Shirou was countering and blocking every single one. Gil was firing them so fast out of the GoB that it sounded like a machine gun firing, he even fired at Shirou from every angle at once and Shirou still came out on top. <br><br>Yeah, guess what, any Servant could do what Shirou did when he was blocking the incoming shots with his swords by hand. What they couldn't do was counter all the rest of the swordspam that Shirou had to use his own swordspam to block. That's the key difference that allowed Shirou to handle Gate of Babylon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That is a reason Fate route is useful. Shirou gets BTFO many times and establishes just because he can beat Gil anybody else in the HGW can ruin him.</br>  <br>Prisma lore is just slightly tweaked Fate lore, what's the problem with using it as an example?</br>  <br> It doesn't seem to me like much, if any, of humanity was going to survive the grail. Perhaps it's explained a bit more in the VN and I have a more shallow understanding for not having read it. <br>Doesn't matter. If none of humanity survived that just meant humanity's value was just that low in his opinion. If only a few survived. He'd rule over them.<br>Chances are, more than one person would have survived the grail anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes but think about it. Archer was born from Emiya. Gil existed during the time these heroic spirits were being created, and based on his extensive knowledge of the grail, he was probably around then, too.<br><br>Emiya (archer) would totally try to read up on what killed every heroic spirit, but to trace a memory isn't probable. Emiya always traced visible objects (like when he first countered GoB Spam), so it wasn't possible for him to trace what killed a heroic spirit, because he didn't have the actual sword on hand.</br></br></br>  <br>Using the anime fight as an argument in UBW's favor is silly considering how much of it Gil spent safely out of range. If he hadn't stood there like a complete idiot, spammed blades exclusively, and/or retrieved the one weapon that'd make him flinch long enough for Shirou to slice his arm off, he would have been fine.</br>  <br> Prisma is Illya Route according to Nasu <br> Called a strong opponent and confirmed to be able to beat every Servant except Lancer because of Gae Dearg <br> Called Archer arch-nemesis a volume after the 32 NPs comment <br> The 32 NPs comment applied to all the Servants of the 4th War, yet both Iskandar and Shirou Saber survived higher numbers. <br><br>The one comment Gilfags had to their defense proven wrong twice, while Lancelot has like 4 on his side.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yeah, guess what, any Servant could do what Shirou did when he was blocking the incoming shots with his swords by hand <br>I really doubt that.</br></br>  <br><br>Archer can't trace things that aren't swords. Gilgamesh has many more things in his treasury than mere weapons, and many of those things are direct counters to many Heroic Spirits, like the tool that would disable Second Magic and render Fake Assassin incapable of using Tsubame Gaeshi against him. Shioru/Archer would never be able to recreate such things.</br></br>  <br>It matters because GoB spam alone doesn't defeat servants in battle. Targeting the loli and using Enkidu got Gilgamesh the victory not just spamming GoB.</br>  <br> If Gil had just won the fight he wouldn't have lost </br>  <br>That's Gil's weakness, that he does illogical shit out of pride.<br><br>He could have pulled out EA and fucked everyone if he wanted, but that's not the point.</br></br></br>  <br>Later it's said Tokiomi called him because he realized the disadvantage.</br>  <br>I wouldn't say he couldn't trace anything that wasn't a sword. Think back at the very beginning when he was strengthening connectors inside of a heater, I think it was.<br><br>I totally think he could reproduce other weapons than swords, but swords were the best choice for defeating Gil.</br></br></br>  Who is True Archer  <br>A Servant that was going to make Gil job again until someone else came to the rescue. That someone then told Gil to not interfere or she would kick his ass.</br>  <br>Swords are the only thing he can spam. He has a couple like Rho Aias for certain situations. but swords are the only thing that doesn't take more mana than its worth.</br>  <br>You missed the point. Anime Shirou was a lot less impressive and barely put any pressure on Gil, who had to stand there and do jack-shit for Shirou to actually touch him.</br>  <br>And he never brought those things out in his regular GoB swordspam sessions but still overwhelmed every other opponent. If you are telling me that Lancelot can't handle 64 swordspam, while being the servant best at handling swordspams I have a hard time believing anybody else can do better.</br>  <br> he swapped weapons because the ones he was using were breaking under the stress of deflecting all those hits at once <br>Citation needed</br></br>  <br>She never said that. She just told him it was her fight and Gil was like "fine, whatever."</br>  <br>No. If it's not a sword, it's hollow, empty, pretty useless. The only exception is Avalon.</br>  <br>But isn't UBW Shirou stronger than Fate Shirou? <br><br>And while we're at it. Shutout beats Saver Alter in HF thanks to Archer's arm. Does that mean Archer can beat Saber Alter?</br></br></br>  <br>The only thing he could have done is pull out Ea sooner. Nothing else would have actually helped.</br>  <br>She didn't say it, but what do you think would happen if he did? If someone told you to get the fuck out because this wasn't your problem, and you stick your nose disregarding the warning, you think they are just going to hug you?</br>  <br>Is Saber Alter trying to kill Archer?</br>  <br>He could have stalled for any amount of time and come out on top. Any sword would have worked, not just Ea.</br>  <br>If Black Saber isn't using Excalibur, and falls for the three winged crane trick by knocking the swords behind her (instead of destroying them).<br>She's a rank of instinct below normal Saber, who may not fall for that.</br></br>  <br>What about Roh Aias? That isn't a sword.</br>  <br>How? What sword could he pull out other than Ea that would not instantly get countered? How would it stall any better than every other weapon he used?<br>Do you not get the point that "any weapon Shirou can trace will immediately be neutralized, before Gilgamesh can even touch it"?</br></br>  <br>It's like you think getting Gilgamesh to attack is favorable to her blowing True Archer the fuck out. She knows who he is and she knows his strengths, so of course she's faring well against him. She never actually threatens Gil.</br>  <br>pretty sure Rho Aias is an exception along with Avalon. And it cost a shit ton of mana to use.</br>  <br> Archer can't trace things that aren't swords <br>UBW can't auto trace non-swords by sight alone, but Archer can trace non-swords if he studies them and learns how they were physically made</br></br>  <br><br>Gil's weakness is pride. He believes he is the one and only king of everything, and only people he deems worthy are worth even a shred of effort.<br><br>Have you ever been really good at something, and someone new or worse than you challenges you? You know you could win without effort if you tired, but going all out against this person almost makes you feel scummy?<br><br>That's how Gil feels. By having to try, even in the slightest, he is acknowledging that he isn't as good as he thinks he is, AND that what he considers scum is forcing his hand.<br><br>Gil's strength is irrelevant, he's like a God. He could have stood there and did nothing, and the propose of the fight would be the same.<br><br>Shirou won by forcing Gil to acknowledge him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She tells him to stay the fuck away, in a more polite manner. It's clear she wants to beat True Archer by herself.</br>  <br>Did you even watch the show? Shirou wasn't neutralizing every fucking sword. Some even zoomed right past him and his only saving grace during freefall was Gil's inability to aim.<br><br>Even in the VN, Gil still manages to take out some of his swords and clash with Shirou. This happens in the anime and he still manages to pull away.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Shirou can trace anything related to melee combat, he just specializes in swords. Armor and shields are also capable, though their quality is less.<br>It would be damn useless against GoB if couldn't trace spears and axes and scythes, which Gil has aplenty.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Ancient hero that's canonically forty times stronger than a normal man <br> gets his weapon knocked out of his hands by a 17 year old Japanese teenager </br>  <br>Why counter what he doesn't need to counter? It'd be a waste of his very finite magical energy.<br>The only thing Gilgamesh can do at all is delay, and that's admitting he cannot overcome this adversary, and that is defeat to his pride.</br></br>  <br>That wasn't the point, but yes, that's obvious. She doesn't want to try her luck with Gil, she just wants to fight TA.</br>  <br> Armor and shields are also capable, though their quality is less <br>Every trace is lower quality than the original. Shields just cost three times more mana than weapons of the same rank.</br></br>  <br>Yes, the implication is that armor and shields might go down by more than one rank, Nasu isn't perfectly clear.</br>  <br>It's an adversary he could have overcome by evading, or forcing Shirou to download more blades and drain his prana. Even then, he lost his arm to his momentary hesitation to grab Ea. Any of sword he could've brandished in time.</br>  Best way I can describe it IMO.<br><br>Sword spam doesn't kill anyone.<br>It's EA/Enkindu does it, or simply outlasting them.<br><br>Most servants can deflect sword spam, but they can't approach gil because they are busy defending themselves. <br><br>Shirou/Archer don't have to waist time defending themselves from sword spam as they counter it with their sword spam, so they are free to just bum rush Gil, and take him on in melee.<br><br>If Archer/Shirou sword spammed, the servant would just counter the blades like they would Gil, but Shirou/Archer would run out a lot faster then Gil would, so it's not a great strat, as Gil can just do it forever.<br><br>Now when I say servants, I mean the top 3 classes, Shirou/Archer could probably sword spam and win against Caster/Rider/Assassin, and maybe Beserker, but not Herkles because godhand is broken.<br><br>Does that make sense?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's an adversary he could have overcome by evading, or forcing Shirou to download more blades and drain his prana.  <br>That's not actually overcoming anything in Gilgamesh's eyes and you know it. He couldn't beat Shirou down and stand triumphant, having to wait is not the same thing to his ego.<br><br> Even then, he lost his arm to his momentary hesitation to grab Ea.  <br>No, that was just eyecandy. He would have been too slow regardless.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This.<br><br>Sword spam doesn't actually work on many Servants.<br><br>Any Servant that Gil could beat just by swordspamming, Shirou and Archer could as well, but the fact of the matter is those Servants fucking suck. It would probably be more resource-efficient just to behead them with Kanshou and Byakuya.<br><br>Heracles only got sword spammed to death because he was protecting Illya and Gil even had to pull out Enkidu to finish the job.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except Lancelot can't handle 64 weapons at once if the narrator is to be believed while being the direct counter to the swordspam tactic.</br>  <br>As much as I agree that Gil's definition of defeat isn't necessarily getting killed, you can't say the two-second pause in actually grabbing Ea didn't make a difference for certain. It makes sense.</br>  <br> Except Lancelot can't handle 64 <br>No reason he can't it all depends on how long Kariya can keep Lancelot on the battle without dying.</br></br>  <br>A wounded Archer in the Fate route managed to shave off like 6 of Berserkers lives without UBW, what does that tell you?</br>  <br>They don't all suck. Cu stalled it for half a day, but eventually went down. The thing is that Archer can't swordspam anywhere near that long.<br><br>And GoB's strength was never swordspamming in the first place. Gil is just lazy.</br></br></br>  <br>Archer probably didn't sword spam Herkles though.<br><br>He most likely used his powers in the most efficient way, which is using individual NP's and using their effects.</br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't tell us anything about how useless UBW is at defeating servants that's for sure.</br>  <br>It wasn't necessary in the VN and nothing indicated it would have been necessary in the anime. He still couldn't fire Ea in so small a pause, it has an activation time.</br>  <br>It actually works on every Servant. The number of weapons he needs to bring out may vary but a sufficient number of swords will eventually begin to wear out almost any Servant that isn't Enkidu.<br><br>And that's why GoB is the stronger NP in general situations. It doesn't cost as much to much to activate and treasury is nigh infinite as opposed to UBW that requires large amounts of mana, an opening chant, and some mana limitations on non sword constructions. Archer/Shirou can, for a short time, overwhelm GIl's swordspam but if forced into a war of attrition, UBW isn't that great. It's more of a zoning/distraction tool that allows them to get in closer by occupying the opponent's defense with a wall of steel.<br><br>It's a fantastic ability but it alone isn't likely to beat any high tier Servant.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking half the fight was unnecessary according to the VN. The anime is just different.</br>  <br> And GoB's strength was never swordspamming in the first place. <br>Pretty much this.<br><br>Gil's not a weaponmaster by any means but he's no real slouch in melee combat if he applies himself. Using GoB for strategic, omnidirectional strikes while he occupies the enemy Servant with a Noble Phantasm that targets their specific weaknesses is the ideal usage in my opinion.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Half the fight was unnecessary. It was all getting Gilgamesh to open his guard, which he did when he pulled out Ea. The entire fight up until then was just making Gilgamesh realize that no weapon would be enough and he had to pull out Ea.</br>  <br>imagine if Gil actually did that. Like immediately he chained them up with Enkidu and then activated GoB 1 foot away from the servants face and shot their weakness into them. That would be pretty cool actually. Hopefully we get to see some serious spam in fake.<br><br>Also whats stopping Gil from opening GoB inside people's bodies?</br></br></br>   fate autists   <br>read<br><br>What was said for Lancelot wasn't said for him alone, but for all the other Servants of the 4th War. Yet 2 far inferior in terms of dealing with swordspam, Iskander and Shirou Saber, dealt with higher numbers than 32 and survived.</br></br></br>  <br> activated GoB 1 foot away from the servants face and shot their weakness into them. <br>He can't do that, if he could there would be no point in Heracles using his body as a shield.</br></br>  <br>I still don't get why people think swordspam is why Gil's good.</br>  <br> Cu stalled it for half a day, but eventually went down <br>Because he was held back by the Command Spell.</br></br>  <br> Enkidu <br> doing shit to non-divine Servants </br></br>  <br> Also whats stopping Gil from opening GoB inside people's bodies? <br>Arranging them so they hit from every angle =/= opening a portal anywhere he wants.<br><br> Hopefully we get to see some serious spam in fake. <br>True Archer, it didn't work.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> A powerful noble phantasm that gets stronger against Divinity <br> not doing anything against non-divine servants <br>Divine servants are just doublefucked.</br></br></br>  <br> Only a strong chain <br> Even a Divine broke it with A+ STR <br>Thor also got out of it in Prisma.</br></br></br>  Servants are scissors. <br>Gil is rock.<br>Archer and Shirou are paper.<br><br>Nasuverse isn't powerlevels, it's rock paper scissors. <br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/dbz/<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/naruto/<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/anywherebuthere/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not swordspam that makes Gil powerful. Yes, it helps but the true power of Gil is the content.<br><br>We saw Herakles easily take tens of arrows from Archer yet it barely scratched him.<br><br>Gil's strength always comes from his treasures. His swordspam is the strong and very effective because he's launching goddamn noble phantasms, each one much greater than any regular arrow Archer shoots.<br><br>The fact that he could basically have anything in his treasury is what makes him the strongest.<br><br>UBW counters this not just because it is faster to launch swords when it's already deployed but because it's able to copy the quality of projectiles as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Again don't forget UBW counters this because the caster of UBW has no inherent weaknesses like the other servants do.</br>  I suppose as a Counter Guardian with mama Alaya pumping him full of mama, sword spam might be a bit more attractive, but still not exactly a go to strat.<br><br>Now sword spam for Shirou against like regular ass humans or mages is probably a pretty good boon for him. He would still probably use it only as a last ditch effort and just fucking use a gun 99% of the time though.</br></br>  <br><br>More like Nasuverse is all about asspulls and plot armor. All these powerful characters were made to job for the shitty MC for self insert power fantasy</br></br>  <br> Excuses <br>Gil jobbed to Gawain in CCC and this time he was the MC.</br></br>  <br> joke fight because Hakuno didn't paid his debt <br> he jobbed he's shit!!! </br></br>  <br> More excuses <br>Gilfags, everyone.</br></br>  <br>Please don't reply to obvious bait.</br>  <br> Now sword spam for Shirou against like regular ass humans or mages is probably a pretty good boon for him <br>Not really. UBW is like ridiculously inefficient 90% of the time when a single NP would suffice. For that matter, spamming GoB is pretty inefficient, but the difference is Gil can actually afford to be inefficient because he has a near-inexhaustible treasury while Shirou can't because his prana levels aren't exactly spectacular.<br><br>Rule Breaker would probably shut down most magi cold in most instances. Actually given how broken Rule Breaker is he really should've spammed that shit more in the 5th war too.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Because he's pretty much the worst conceived character in the entire franchise.</br></br>  <br>You're referring to Gilgamesh, right?<br>Because "hurr durr I have everything ever because I was the first hero" is total bullshit.</br></br>  <br>Well, Gil is basically Mega Rayray</br>  <br>I mean like a single NP, just one summoned sword shot with TK would deal with most regular ass humans, and he could reuse the same sword since he has full telekentic control over it.<br><br>Summoning a whole barrage of swords would be way overkill.</br></br></br>  <br><br>So I'm not the only one that thought so. I just don't get it, he comes up with all these other characters and powers and rules/limitations for them that could be used to counter each other and then in the last quarter of the story or so it's pretty much like actually yeah no none of that matters, this guy just has every sword in the world and a magic spinning stick that is an automatic I win button so he's the strongest servant. Ever since I got to that point in the Fate route the whole universes structure and the character struggles that went on just ceased to matter to me because the final antagonist is just so colossally ill-conceived, one dimensional and lame as all fuck. It just feels like such a waste to have that as the final antagonist after all the other servants who are actually interesting and not completely one dimensional single minded egotists just there to be the bad guy.</br></br>  <br>At this point if someone says Gil loses to ORT Gilfags will think it's bait.</br>  <br>Archer and Shirou should be perfectly capable of trscing Tsubame Gaeshi, considering what happened in to Berserker in HF.</br>  So why exactly did Shirou win against Gilgamesh in the anime?<br><br>The VN gave him a tenuously justified reason for winning but the anime changed things up enough so that it's no longer there. So why?</br></br>  <br> what is reinforcement? <br>Didn't you see the epilogue with Luvia beating the shit out of Rin</br></br>  <br>And Lancelot defeated Gawain with pure kill even with Gawain has the advantage under the sun skill. Just send any round table Knight and they can be a counter to Gil.</br>  <br>Please. They paused to talk while clashing swords to explain exactly that.</br>  <br><br>It's an extremely lame idea after everything else he came up with for the other servants. Fate's antagonists are just kind of bad in general though I've noticed.</br></br>  <br>Imagine if Gil was a shota on top of all that.</br>  On a completely unrelated note, Ufotable became one of my favorite studios because not only they went beyond making a simple adaption by adding lots of new nasu-written content, they also added tons of little things that shows that they understand the source.<br><br>I'd like to believe they genuinely liked working on this, Aniplex bucks aside.</br></br>  <br>You see, that's exactly what I'm talking about.<br><br>The VN gives a reason why he's BETTER than Gilgamesh: UBW allows him to pull out new swords faster than Gilgamesh can every time their swords broke.<br><br>Personally, I found it to be kind of a silly reason, but it's at least there.<br><br>But in the anime, it's no longer an ADVANTAGE. UBW just lets him keep up with Gilgamesh's sword spam, not surpass it. It let him survive against but not one-up Gilgamesh. So what other advantage did he have that let him defeat the King of Heroes?<br><br>The only reason that I could see what that Gilgamesh's pride got the better of him and his hesitation in pulling Ea out cost him victory, but that's kind of a shitty thing for Shirou to bet on. Waiting for Gilgamesh to slip up because of his ego before UBW runs out? What kind of strategy is that? At least VN Shirou actually had an endgame in mind.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you just not fucking watch the fight?<br>Do you even watch anime?<br>Did you read the visual novel?<br>Fuck you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The actual reason why Shirou wins is lost in the adaption and RN.<br>Fate is a story about love overcoming any obstacle.</br></br>  <br>He can do it, he just doesn't.</br>  <br>That's cute.</br>  <br>Citation needed. For now, I will say that Shirou can project a weapon inside someone too since Gilfags like to talk shit without proving their points.</br>  <br> what if we took a serious VN <br> then, what if we took the final boss... <br> and then, what if we made him into a shota <br> prisma illya <br><br>a complete insult to the Fate franchise.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He jobbed because he didn't want to raise his stats back to the way they were and would rather die than use Ea at that point.</br>  <br>Shota Gil was a thing in HA already.</br>  <br> Implying stats are what makes Gil strong <br>It's been stated many times it's his treasure, he is fucking shit at close combat. Any stat besides END and LUCK is pointless for him.</br></br>  <br>You don't need a citation for Gil opening GoB close to his enemies. There's nothing about being in close proximity that indicates it can't be opened.<br><br>If you could pay attention you would realize that says nothing about his ability to do it inside them, which he obviously fucking can't do.</br></br></br>  why couldn't shirou beat assassin?  <br> he is fucking shit at close combat <br>Oh boy, this retarded meme again.<br>Gil isn't "fucking shit" at close combat, he's just hasn't mastered any particular weapon. Big fucking difference. He may not be able to Tsubame Gaeshi or Mind of the Eye (true) but he can handle himself just fine.</br></br></br>  <br> There's nothing about being in close proximity that indicates it can't be opened. <br>There is nothing in close proximity that indicates it can be opened either. At this point you are just making up shit. So might as well say he can do it inside them, as according to you, nothing says he can't do it.</br></br>  <br>No shit stats aren't as important as NPs, but they're still a component in combat, especially in Extra. Having high stats is a lot better than having straight Es, even when you're Gil.</br>  <br>He could probably block TG with floating sword bullshit.<br><br>But Assassin would kill him before he ever needed to do it.<br><br>The only way he could be Assassin is with zoning, but he can't because boundry field bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> meme <br>His skill is literally below a ginger kid. So much for someone who can handle himself just fine.</br></br>  <br>most servants: rock<br>gil: paper<br>shirou: scissors</br></br></br>  <br>If you are Gil you can't put those stats to use for anything relevant. That's like giving Medea A STR and AGI, for what purpose would you want that.</br>  So why couldn't Archer/Shirou just trace Gae Bolg and spam it? inb4 "the reversal of cause and effect isn't inherent to the spear and is Lancer's own personal technique", Archer/Shirou can trace experience (like with 9 Lives).  <br>Yes, the fact that we've never seen GoB open through anything physical. Opening them a foot away in thin air is nothing fucking special. He even fires GoB directly beneath Saber in the Fate route and it sure as fuck wasn't far away from her when he did.</br>  <br>Because Nasu didn't think of it or they can't replicate the technique without dying because reasons.</br>  <br>The ginger kid fought with the skills imbued in the sword, not his own, so what's your point?</br>  <br> Yes, the fact that we've never seen GoB open through anything physical <br>Air is a thing. It takes up space. It's made of matter. It's physical.</br></br>  <br> If they're strong enough to knock away their counterparts, then their strength is equal, simple as that. <br>Absolutely retarded logic. Berserker's sword isn't even a Noble Phantasm and yet he could block Gil's projectiles with it. Does that make it stronger that the NPs Gil uses? No.<br><br>Basically, even if someone throws an iron sword at you, you can still knock out of of the air by throwing a wooden sword at it. Simple as that.</br></br></br></br>  <br> He even fires GoB directly beneath Saber in the Fate route and it sure as fuck wasn't far away from her when he did. <br>He arranged them to come from that direction, not that he made a portal there. Look at the dogfight against Lancelot, it's the same fucking shit.</br></br>  <br>If that was the case he wouldn't have said Gil is the only Servant he can beat. The only one that could do the copy shit was HF Shirou.</br>  <br>I don't know why you're bothering with someone who believes an invisible forcefield prevents Gil from using GoB x distance from his target.</br>  <br> Basically, even if someone throws an iron sword at you, you can still knock out of of the air by throwing a wooden sword at it <br>ONLY IF THE WOODEN SWORD HAS A REALLY HIGH POWER LEVEL.<br><br>Protip: Arguing with people on /a/ who only know fights from DBZ and typical shounen logic is only going to result in a loss of brain cells.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know why you're bothering with someone who believes Gil can do something he hasn't been even implied to be able to do.</br>  <br> Berserker's sword isn't even a Noble Phantasm and yet he could block Gil's projectiles with it <br>Which makes the climax to UBW kind of nonsensical.<br> Berserker's axe-sword is literally just a slab of rock <br> he smashes it against god knows how many of Gil's NPs <br> it doesn't break <br><br> Gilgamesh's NPs are legendary magical weapons <br> he smashes them against Shirou's copies a few times <br> they break <br> over and over and over and over again </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Rider was right about a lot of things in that scene. The people devoting themselves to the king, the king never being alone, and the king being law itself all seem true.</br>  <br>Another reason why the UFOTable adaption is superior to the original material.<br><br>Gil's weapons don't magically start shattering left and right once Shirou pops open his reality marble.</br></br></br>  <br>What, opening GoB a foot away from his opponent? Do you need everything animated before you can grasp that he can open it very close to his foes?</br>  <br>No, Shirou was also using the sword's memories in UBW.</br>  <br> Guys GoB can destroy a galaxy I swear. You need to believe me, my dad works at TM <br>Seriously, just stop. Might as well say GoB can kill you without deploying. If you can't prove what you are saying, it's headcanon.</br></br>  <br> Citation needed </br>   arguing with gilfags   If I remember correctly, Berserker was just immune to almost everything archer could throw at him, and Lancer is resistant to projectiles. Lancer on his own was ridiculously overpowered and can one shot archer if he was allowed to Gae bolg. Archer could beat Caster, Saber without the mach 24 command seal, Assassins and rider. Then again he's a knight class so it's not unexpected. Gil would just wear his armor against Archer, nullifying the advantage of equal sword spam.  <br> No, Shirou was also using the sword's memories in UBW. <br>Literally never mentioned at a single point in the narration.<br><br>And believe me, if Shirou was actually doing it, he'd be going on a ten page monologue about it like he always does in every instance he uses it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a staggering leap between your horseshit and Gil firing his NPs close to his opponents, which he does in Fate and CCC. But you're either retarded or baiting, so whatever.</br>  <br>The VN isn't really clear. It doesn't indicate that it's like the dogfight; it just says that he fired a polearm from below her.</br>  <br>Headcanon is headcanon. Your comment is as ridiculous as mine as neither is backed up by anything.</br>   EA GG <br>Of course gilfags will try to defend the rest of gils arsenal like it matters in most fights when EA is the really only broken thing.</br>  <br>Ugh I know I have screenshots of Shirou stating the steps he goes through when projecting. There's 8 steps or something, I have to find it.</br>  Shirou wasn't doing sword auto pilot in UBW.<br>He was using the skills he learned from Archer.<br><br>Shirou was downplaying himself kinda hard against Gil.<br><br>Shirou may be a one trick pony at the moment, but future Shirou did take Kanshou and Bakuya to as far as he could, and developed a proper fighting style with them. Even coming up with cheap shit like crane realm and overedge.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It never said that he fired them from below her, just that the weapon came from below. Gilgamesh kept increasing the numbers behind him.</br>  <br>If you say so.</br>  <br><br> Expecting logic from a porn game. <br><br>You should kill yourself for watching Fate/Shit</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gilgamesh increasing the number behind him means very little. We know he can attack omnidirectionally and doesn't need to launch them from where he is.</br>  <br>Not even the best user of the Gate we have seen so far, Angelica, has done such thing.</br>  <br>You thinking it came from a portal in that direction means even less. He was never said to have opened from there, at any moment.</br>  <br>You mean CCC Gil, right? Because they took pains to animate him doing exactly that.</br>   This chair   <br>That's wrong. Nasu's stuff is the same as Marvel or DC, everyone can beat everyone.</br>  <br>Angelica supplements the Gate with her portals. Whenever she pulls surprise attacks on the enemy they always come out of square portals (Ainsworth magic) instead of the circular portals of GoB.</br>  <br> in an eyesore </br>  <br> belongs to Lancelot now.  </br>    <br>THIS CHAIR THIS CHAIR THIS CHAIR THIS CHAIR THIS CHAIR THIS CHAIR THIS CHAIR THIS CHAIR THIS CHAIR THIS CHAIR THIS CHAIR THIS CHAIR THIS CHAIR THIS CHAIR THIS CHAIR THIS CHAIR THIS CHAIR THIS CHAIR THIS CHAIR THIS CHAIR THIS CHAIR THIS CHAIR</br>  <br>Doesn't GOB has a limit how much weapons are in the treasury?And what when a weapon is destroyed? It's remade in treasury or lost forever? But on other hand UBW has unlimited weapons (aside the mana cost).</br>  <br>If gameplay is canon then enemy Servants tanking them many times to the face also is.</br>  <br>That's why I said the best user of the Gate, she is literally better than any possible incarnation of Gil.</br>  <br>Lancelot steals the key and BP it. How butthurt would Gil be?</br>  <br> That's why I said the best user of the Gate, she is literally better than any possible incarnation of Gil. <br>Shirou and Kuro didn't even need UBW to take her down.</br></br>  Shiki &gt; shiki &gt; SHIKI &gt; shiki &gt; Shiki  <br>It means just as little. Firing from below is something we have seen him done, and readying more NPs behind his person never meant he could only fire from there. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't. It's not clear.</br>  <br>That just makes it worse for regular Gil since he is inferior.</br>  <br> Shirou and Kuro <br> White and Black <br> Kanshou and Byakuya <br>I can't believe I never noticed this before.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And that's why you're wrong. Angelica was shit and the worst part is that she wasn't even anchored down by pride.</br>  <br>Roughly as viable as using entirely different characters from Prisma of all things.</br>  <br> Angelica was shit <br>Her feats are better than regular Gil. I would go as far as saying even serious Gil in terms of GoB usage.<br><br> she wasn't even anchored down by pride. <br>How is that a bad thing, why would you want her to go full retard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Characters might be different but the abilities are still the same.</br>  <br>She got schooled by far less than even Gil at his worst. She's not better by any stretch. <br><br>Give ko-Gil as much and you'll actually have something. He uses it properly. She doesn't.</br></br></br>  <br>I always wondered when Lancelot steals a NP can he use it's abilities?</br>  <br> and the worst part is that she wasn't even anchored down by pride. <br>Gilgamesh's pride is one of the reasons he can never be considered to be truly the most powerful.</br></br>  <br>TM threads were always like this without any new material to discuss. Powerlevel bullshit. At least it's not "Shiki can kill servants" thread #3245<br><br>I miss the seafood sex threads but Nasu doesn't write h scenes anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>She fought not one, but 2 counters at the same time. She has done shit that Gil could never hope to achieve like accelerating the NPs.<br><br>Ko-Gil was only winning because he could steal the shit from the Gate without her being able to do the same, that has literally nothing to do with skill at using the Gate. He was about to get fucked when she pulled out the 3 unknown cards.</br></br></br>  <br>He gains ownership of them, no reason why he wouldn't be able.</br>  <br>She doesn't know how to use it. She knows how to fire weapons in the same incompetent fashion as regular Gil, except he can actually stalemate proper heroes with his. The only one to ever use GoB properly is shota Gil, because he isn't retarded and knows his limits.</br>  <br>UBW is GoB only weakness/counter<br>If its GoB against anything else GoB wins, same with UBW losing to pretty much any other servant</br></br>    Swordspam is actually only Gil's first line of defense/attack. When Gil uses swordspam on you, it means he gives no shits about you. The only one who straight falls to Gil's swordspam is Caster. Everyone else is able to defend against it to some extent. It's powerful, but there are plenty of Heroic Spirits who can stand up to it. It's something Gil only uses when he gives the least amount of shit possible.<br><br>What makes Gil so dangerous isn't swordspam. It's that he can instantly read his opponent and pull out the exact weapon necessary to take them down. He doesn't normally use this method, but he's fully capable of using it. <br><br>Archer and Shirou don't have that ability. They can't just instantly deduce a Servant's identity and ability with naught but a glance. Just being able to scan a Servant's weapon doesn't inherently grant them knowledge of that Servant's identity and weaknesses. Even after seeing Rule Breaker, Shirou didn't know Caster's identity. He only found out when Rin told him.<br><br>Furthermore, Gil has Ea, which is the most powerful known offensive Noble Phantasm. Even Archer can't replicate that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And notably accomplished nothing. You're greatly overstating her very limited application of the Gate and the one novel idea she even had.</br>  <br>What the fuck was Shiki doing in the cock tower?</br>  <br>Gil doesn't need the key though<br>And a BP does not permanently destroy a NP since they are made of prana, they just take fucking forever to regenerate. And Gil can regenerate his weapons pretty fast due to some bullshittery in his treasury. <br>Oh, and he has a NP for the sole purpose of recovering NPs.<br>And Gil has already had his treasury stolen in Prisma Ilya, it doesn't end well</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shiki's hair is messier than that. He also doesn't have a parted fringe.</br>  <br>UBW only counters GoB if Gil is underestimating his opponent. Which will happen 100% of the time since who would value Shirou or Garcher highly?</br>  <br> She doesn't know how to use it. <br> Weapons from behing <br> Gate acceleration <br> Space warping attacks in front of herself <br>Sure<br><br> The only one to ever use GoB properly is shota Gil <br>How is getting ownership of a weapon while your enemy can't do the same = skill?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay, answer me this if he can use a NP's abilities, but first lets set up a what if fight with someone like Cu Lancer. <br>If Cu uses Gae bolg on Lancelot could he deflect it with Arondight, and he pulls it away ultimately catches Gae bolg before returning to Cu. How fucked is he?</br></br>   Shirou/Archer are "one trick ponies that cannot defeat anyone easily other than gil because UBW is suited to defeating just him" <br> Gil is essentially the same thing, just stronger/slower <br><br> somehow gil is the strongest servant <br><br>HELLO? NASU?</br></br></br></br></br>  Will this show save noitaminA?  <br> hipstershit with bad designs <br>Gee, I wonder</br></br>   The story of the original novel revolves around Sōhei Saikawa, a member of the Saikawa Research Lab. He goes on a vacation held by the lab, and Moe Nishinosono, the daughter of his mentor, joins the group on their vacation despite not being a part of the lab. There, the two end up finding a corpse. The two work together to solve the mysteries of what becomes a serial murder case.  <br><br>Doesn't sound too bad but not that compelling either</br></br>  <br>Is that the punpun artist?</br>  <br>He's the character designer for the anime, yeah.<br>It's also based off of a novel, and actual one, not LN shit. Anime based on novels usually tend to be decent to amazing.</br></br>  Dective novel adaptations are my fetish.  <br>I don't think it will.<br><br>I loved the story, but a lot of the concepts aren't new now. The story itself was written in 1996. A lot of things in the book that are cool are considered outdated now.<br><br>Moe and Saikawa are super cute together though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ping Pong 2015 ?</br>  <br> I loved the story, but a lot of the concepts aren't new now. The story itself was written in 1996 <br>They still made a live action drama out of it in 2014.<br>Must have been quite succesful if we're getting an anime in 2015.</br></br></br>  <br>The novel is successful as fuck. Had two manga adaptations, two LN adaptations, a visual novel, a live action drama, and now a TV anime. Holy shit.</br>  <br>The drama was hated, the female lead obviously never read the book, and the director completely fucked up her personality too. Moe is supposed to be slightly worse than Saikawa in terms of deduction, but is also a genius by herself. Saikawa is like that lanky, silent dude that doesn't really talk, but was excited as fuck in the drama.<br><br>The author has a fascination with geniuses, but the drama made them look like ADHD detectives. This and Biblia's drama were both done incredibly horribly.</br></br></br>  <br> director of Elfen Lied </br>  <br>Thank god he's gotten better since then.<br>Stuff like Denpateki na Kanojo, Soranowoto or Kimi to boku.</br></br>  Will noitaminA says anything more about Cabaneli this summer?  <br>Hopefully.<br>But I don't think it will air until spring of next year at least, since there's already a show in noitaminA for winter.</br></br>  <br> Character designs by Inio Asano <br>Well fuck, I was already going to watch this, but now I got to.</br></br>   Girl and boy character are out together  <br> They meet someone they both know <br> That someone thinks they're boyfriend and girlfriend and makes an awkward situation happen <br><br>So sick of this shit </br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh that's right pepe is reddit's meme now.</br>  <br>Not him but that's the place it's mainly used and it's "tfw no cute gf" 3D bullshit, don't bring that to /a/.</br>  <br>Man don't watch RomComs then, I live for that shit.</br>  That's a cute situation   I am still not living in the 2D world <br><br>So sick of this shit</br></br>  Absolute perfection  <br><br>I want to have sex with her.</br></br>  Where did she get the squid?<br> Captcha of fish </br>  Wish the OVA had more scenes between Kanye and Sento.<br><br>Season 2 when Kyoani?</br></br>  Why are KyoAni girls so perfect?

So far she is the only one to do that, thrice.</br>  <br>She does ara ara in that video of her's that Sento watched.<br>She is purity personified.</br></br>  <br>Why is she so perfect when she's holding animals? I want to watch her AVs.</br>  <br>She's just unnaturally good with animals. How did she understand those seals?</br>   Maple Land 元老院 <br> 元老院 = Senate <br><br> TL'd as 'Asylum' <br><br>So these are trollsubs right?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I already thought this was kinda weird.</br>  But who was message?  <br><br>Shitty translation was message.</br></br>  <br><br>Separate video and make it HD quality.</br></br>        Holy shit did anyone else focused on the water graphics instead of Sento's tits? It's amazing.  <br><br><br><br>I'm still disappointed we didn't see the fairies switch into each other's costumes. I want to see Earth wearing Air's outfit and have the top sagging against her chest.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A &gt; C &gt; B</br>  <br><br> Not her fault.

Her head seems normal.</br>  <br>Why does Sento look like a girl with a crush?</br>  <br><br><br>This might be the most accurate depiction of koalas ever.</br></br></br>  What do you call this kind of comedy again? I really miss this kind of comedy like this, fumoffu, and old delinquent manga. Too many lolsorandumb and pun jokes nowadays.  <br>cute</br>  <br>Becays she is a girl with a crush</br>  <br>Sexually? Be specific please.</br>  Sento Claus is coming to my house....   tonight   <br>Really? Sento likes him that way?

Must know moar.</br></br></br>  <br>for you</br>  <br> cowtits  <br> perfect anything  <br>Seek help.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I love you bro.</br></br>  <br>She started liking him in that way after he shared his secret with her about the heights. Then she really started liking him when she stalked him on his day off and heard about his shitty past. Did you miss the episode where Macron slipped her a truth bean?</br>  <br>Remember kids, always SHAFT responsibly</br>  <br>Sento, baby, hurry down the chimney to me</br>  <br>What's wrong with her fingers?</br>  <br>Welp, thread ruined.</br>  <br>Isn't Salama much flatter than Muse?</br>  <br>Fortunately Muse wears an adjustable corsette-bikini</br>    <br>She only needed a day. You've never slept wrong and fucked up your neck before? It can happen, Why this one time, a couple of years ago, I thought it would be a brilliant idea to try and sleep upside down like a bat by going to sleep with my legs up against the wall ended up nearly suffocating due to the position I was un pushing my boobs up against my nose.</br>  I prefer LATIFA SAMA  <br>Is this an accurate portray of two betas trying to flirt?</br>  I just watched it. Season 2 soon I hope, I don't bother with light novels.  Episode 6 and 7 of the mini theater when?  <br>Episode 6 is already out</br>  <br><br>Holy fucking shit dude. Why couldn't you keep your fucking mouth shut.<br><br>God fucking damn it, that honestly looks painful.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She shlicks so hard to Kanye every night her fingers have deformed</br>  <br>The fuck is wrong with her right hand (our left)?</br>  <br>Maybe her butt hurts.</br>  After long term inner debate about all of the girls in Amagi Brilliant Park, I've come to the conclusion that Earth would respond the most positively to being dicked.<br><br>One, she's already reading dirty, dirty fujoshi material. We all know that yaoi is only a gateway for these types of girls. This is only a cover for them, giving them the power to lie to themselves as they quickly move on to secretly indulge in their deepest, darkest hetero fantasies and break into new fetishes and levels of kink.<br><br>Why it wouldn't surprise me if this fairy has amassed all kinds of fetish doujinshi, raiding the Amagi Brilliant Park world's own version of Sadpanda, gathering a collection measured in gigabytes and furiously rubbing herself every night with her eyes closed, imagining Kanie finding her stash and ravishing her body in the various ways pictured within. For a lewd girl like her this won't cut it for long, and she'll have to experience the real thing for herself.<br><br>It will start innocently enough, perhaps asking him to help her in her room. Using the wiles learned from her choice reading material however, she'll soon lure his hands to her firm and supple body. Of course, his hands will only do so much for the curious girl. Before long she'd be completely nude and on her back, Kanie kneeling between her legs, his furiously raging erection gripped hard in his hand as he lines himself up at her soaking entrance. As he pushes into her with one long stroke, she'll involuntarily arch her back and push back against him, taking him as deeply as possible, unsatisfied until every bit of that hard dick is inside her. Her hand will quickly cover her mouth, stopping a deep feminine moan at being taken from emanating and alerting the other girls to their actions.<br><br>Then, the intense mating session will begin in full. There will be no condoms for this lewd fairy, and no rest until every drop contained in his balls is deeply inside her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is Silphy so  fucking stupid?   <br>You could say she's  an airhead </br>  <br> not childish </br>  Air is an airhead<br>Earth is dirty<br>Fire is NOT a hothead<br>Water is ???</br></br></br>  <br> Wind <br> Stupid <br> Recognizes the superiority of the katana <br> Knows she'll be be targeted first by any invaders of the park as they fear and respect her killing potential <br><br>Sure, sure.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Water is  life </br>  <br>I'd like to make some new life right here.</br>  <br>I'm calling the cops.</br>  <br>high test</br>  <br>Water is love.</br>    <br>I wanna roll my tongue all over that</br>  <br>Just because Earth is the kind of girl who would peep on changing shotas and make them rub their cocks together while watching is no reason to call the police.</br>  <br><br>Shame they'll never get together, even in the books.</br></br>  <br>Silphy is so randum xD the character.

The story is really wtf. I don't know if I'd be able to read the story and not be bored.<br><br>Did anyone here read the LN? Is it better than what I imagine?</br></br>  <br>How did anyone except Sylphy even get their roles?</br>  <br>Park is desperate, Musu may be the leader of the group but Slyphy is the most popular one at the park, she's even got a podcast.</br>  <br>inheritance</br>  <br>Pillow fairies.</br>  <br>Slyphy is a literal meme character.

Is it just because her seiyuu can sing well?</br>  <br>So they become sexual offenders and get arrested?<br> daily prison life of high school boys </br></br>  <br>That's a fan-edit.

Anyways if you have even a basic understanding of japanese, it's clear the TL has no idea what the characters are actually saying. It's simply not questionable word choice or editing that's the issue, but plain out getting lines completely wrong. Take the text message Muse sent Sento for example, you could easily guess the contents but what he wrote doesn't make any sense considering the text is clearly written there with no room mistake.</br>  <br><br>now you're just making shit up</br></br>  <br>it's her rifle</br>  <br/>  <br>Enjoy your ignorance.
