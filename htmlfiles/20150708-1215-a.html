[ Based Spyro<br><br>https://kyakka.wordpress.com/2015/0<wbr>7/07/4435/#more-4435</wbr></br></br>   mfw Spyro gets hunted down by the FBI before he can see Yukinoshita lose   Even if his site gets shut down, there's always Madokami.    <br> Spyro <br>*Excorsism<br>Fixed</br></br></br>  <br>And IRC and torrents and even just /a/.</br>  Huh, I am not hearing good things about vol. 11.<br><br>Did something major happen?</br></br>  <br>Nothing happened.</br>  <br>This guy, holy shit. And he recommend great mango too.</br>  <br>The problem is nothing major happened and yet drama intensifies<br><br>It was absolutely stupid for everyone not Irohafags</br></br></br>  LN fags, can someone tell me what happen after anime?  <br>May god bless his soul.</br>  <br>Yeah. 8man goes into existential crisis mode questioning everything he has done.<br><br>He comes up with the idea that he must give into every one of his desires in order to be genuine and needless to say that causes some trouble.</br></br></br>  BASED SPYRO  Yeah, this could easily backfire. If there are signs of Yukinoshita losing or if WW gives in to the shekels and starts padding the story to make extra novels Spyro will easily back out. He's under the impression it's ending in 1-2 novels.  <br><br>.... go on?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127722162 <br>If that seriously happens I'll punch WW.</br>   Volume 12 <br> Yukino starts standing on her own <br> Leaves everything behind and rejoins her family <br> Everyone loses touch with her for months <br> After the graduation ceremony, 8man looks around in the old club room for old time's sake <br> Inside is Yukino <br><br>The end</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Praise SPYRO-SAMA for he is almighty and awesome.<br><br>Yukino is pleased.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought it was obvious. He's a teenage boy regularly in close proximity with attractive women. The only thing holding him back was fear, and he decided he would fear nothing. Just think what would happen if he didn't fear the consequences of his actions.</br>  <br><br><br>So this answer  is correct? Why does  want to make it sound like it was wrong?</br></br></br>  <br><br>This is a token of my gratitude, no please, it's just a thank you.<br><br>https://d.maxfile.ro/jhqpamzkep.web<wbr>m</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> if he didn't fear the consequences of his actions. <br>Sensei created beast then.</br></br>  <br>Indeed she did.</br>  <br>Fuck you, you made me cry</br>  <br><br>Question, can't a translation, just conveniently pop up out of nowhere with no attachment to any names, and give Spyro complete deniability on responsibility for the unofficial translations?<br><br>He needn't be so readily visible, or centrally located for his translation operations for Yen Press to home in on him.<br><br>We can just use pastebins and make redundant copies of the translations to ensure YP doesn't erase everything he's worked for, or in the future.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How soon until Yen Press goes bankrupt.<br><br>They don't have unlimited translators and pile up their LN backlog and do shitty rush jobs yet continue buying up licenses and somehow expect /a/ to still be alive in 2020 much less interested in material that already ended.</br></br></br>  <br>That depends if he wants to. I'm sure if he asked someone would set him up with a VPN or a proxy server in Chile or something.</br>  <br>SAO and LH are selling like hotcakes, and they're very pleased with those sales according to what they said at the AX panel so not anytime soon.</br>  <br>I wonder how good YP reputation in Japan. What was their first ever license? How did it sell?</br>  <br> I wonder how good YP reputation in Japan <br>Why would Japan care about YP?</br></br>  <br>You need a good portofolio to convince them. Getting license ain't easy on the first place. So i just wondering.</br>  <br>They can just hog those titles and cockblock other Western publisher. They're slowly turning LN market into monopoly. Not that there's decent competitors for them, anyway.</br>  <br>Haruhi and S&amp;W sales probably</br>  <br>So what you're saying is that we should all invest in Yen Press for serious payouts?</br>  <br><br>I somehow am not convinced that this is true.</br></br>  <br>As long as they get money, they don't care about what happens to the series outside Japan. And it doesn't help that there aren't any competitors to YP at all</br>  <br>Anything could happen but the anmie covered everything.<br><br>We're all in the dark until Watari releases Volume 12.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, they won't move a single bit. Just like Funi and their shitty encoding, you'll be stuck forever with official translation never.</br>  For what it's worth, I've never seen YP drop a series before. They've already caught up to the latest Haruhi novel, well it was a while ago actually. They're almost done with S&amp;W with the final volume coming out Spring 2016. I think we're fine especially since Oregairu probably won't be that long anyways. For series like Index though I would be a bit worried.  <br>The problem is that we'd be waiting years for something we expected in the next couple of months at most</br>  <br>Reported to Yen Press,<br>I hope they sue him.</br></br>  <br>BASED SPYRO</br>  <br>sent letter to Yen Press</br>  <br>So. When will vol 1 Yahari YP gonna be published?</br>  <br>Not exactly hard to catch up with Haruhi with its long hiatuses</br>  Anyone has the episode 8 full of "I don't understand" stitches?  <br> https://d.maxfile.ro/jhqpamzkep.we<wbr>bm</wbr> <br><br>I don't get it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Tokyo Pop hogged LN licenses too that never materialized.<br><br>Also, that obscure company that actually licensed Hidan no Aria never released Volume 1 and never mentioned it again but still holds the license.<br><br>Seriously, Americans are scum.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> LH <br>Whats that? Log Horizon?</br></br>  <br> And he recommend great mango too. <br><br>Can't find it. Castle of Dandelion or whatever.</br></br></br>  <br> Also, that obscure company that actually licensed Hidan no Aria never released Volume 1 and never mentioned it again but still holds the license. <br>Probably YN give pressure to them. You don't want anymore competitor in the market.</br></br>  <br>Which is retarded since the American market system is completely based around the idea of competition. <br><br>I was hoping that another Light Novel company would finally be able to beat into Yen Press' skull that including something as simple as honorifics wouldn't make the books any less "accessible" to the average reader. <br><br>But at this point Senpai is probably going to be reduced to some shitty localization that takes away all the significance that came with it. The Persona 4 localization didn't treat us like idiots, wish Yen Press would do us the same courtesy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not retarded. If the company owns the rights then no other company can profit on it.<br><br>Companies aren't there to suck your dick, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>You know what I am mad about?<br>Zaregoto v3 to v9 never.</br></br>  <br><br> the American market system is completely based around the idea of competition.  <br><br>You'd be surprised.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127723830 <br>because LNs are shit</br>  <br>yeah</br>  Can somebody translate this one page?<br><br>That's all i need to summed up whole volume 11.</br></br>  <br>Not really since I'm actually a marketing major (sorry for the minor blog), so I'm pretty used to the shitiness of certain business practices by now. Thing is that monopolies are allowed to exist in certain circumstances, but the idea of competition is still upheld by the vast majority of the market. Having one company handle the product is just asking for trouble. <br><br>Yen Press is pretty much the only place to go for Light Novels in English at the moment. And while their quality isn't bad for the most part, if they massively screw up a series by hiring a bad translator (like No Game, No Life for example), then you're pretty much screwed as a reader since there won't be any other alternatives except reading moon. Which has too high of an opportunity cost for many people.<br><br><br> It's not retarded. If the company owns the rights then no other company can profit on it <br><br>What the fuck are you even talking about? Nice job stating the obvious twat, of course a company that doesn't hold the IP won't get any profit from it. The point is that multiple companies in the same market fosters better products for the consumer overall. If X company does a shitty job at translating a certain Light Novel, and Y company gets a better reception by doing something differently (like say including honorifics). then X company is likely to pick up that practice in order to improve their sales. <br><br>And yes, companies are there to suck the customers dick. That's the whole bloody point or else they would make any money you retard. <br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127723830 <br>The only reason he started in the first place was because Yahari was the only series that sparked his interest enough to start translating. He legit started doing it on a whim for the most part, and continued at his own expense. <br><br>I'm pretty sure once Yahari is over he won't bother translating any other series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they wouldn't make any money <br>Goddammit, there was nothing wrong with that auto-correct.</br></br>  <br>I'm glad. Yen Press won't get to Volume 12 until 2019 or so.</br>  Based Spyro.<br>Saving Yaharis since 2013.</br>  <br> too high of an opportunity cost for many people. <br><br>Why is learning a language an opportunity cost?<br><br>Surely time spent doing that is more productive than playing vidya or watching anime.<br><br>I'm also interested to hear the opinion of a marketing specialist.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because everyone already busy finding a cure for cancer or something. Why would they burden themselves in doing something else more costly in their spare time when they can just relax and have an animay?</br>  <br> Why is learning a language an opportunity cost? <br>I'm generalizing a tad, since opportunity cost in general really depends on the person's own idea of what's worth their time or not. But in general learning antoher language could be considered an opportunity cost simply because of the large amount of time you have to spend on it.<br><br>In this case context is extremely important, if you were to say be learning another language so that you can be more efficient in your job that means interacting with people on an international level. Then it could very well be considered an investment of sorts, and thus the opportunity cost isn't all that much since you are doing so in a way that will make up for that lost time in your workplace.<br><br>In this case you're largely using your free-time solely to access more content to read in your free-time. While nothing is necessarily lost in that amount of time, there isn't anything really being gained. You're not learning Japanese to do anything to make up that time, you're doing it only to be able to watch/read Japanese entertainment that you would normally be unable to.<br><br>Which is perfectly fine of course, nothing wrong with that. But the usage of that free-time is still an opportunity cost (not in monetary form obviously) since you could have probably used that time to consume more media rather than investing your time to learn the language instead. Plus there's the risk that you could become frustrated and give-up in the middle of learning, which would mean you lost a lot of your free time for nothing in the end.<br><br>Very subjective for the most part, but I consider learning Japanese to be an opportunity cost for that reason alone honestly. While the sunk cost fallacy is something to bear in mind, it's hard to justify all that time spent if you end up giving up on it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Spyro seems like a cool guy but he clearly bites more than he could chew.<br><br>I guess it doesn't matter since most of you guys don't care about translation quality though</br></br>  <br>YP's impending releases' quality is a dice roll anyway so this evens out in the end.</br>  <br>I thought you fags were saying that his translation is biased anyway.</br>  <br> https://d.maxfile.ro/jhqpamzkep.we<wbr>bm</wbr> <br>What song is that?</br></br>  <br><br><br>So do you learn Japanese yourself?<br><br>On a side note,  since you are marketing major, you got touch on economic a bit right? What is the best source/book on understanding modern economy and investment? </br></br></br></br></br>  Can anyone explain episode 8?  <br>It was Yukino haters<br><br>Seriously though Spyro is quite autistic even when translating, which result in great quality. Since he's one man team, some imperfection is inevitable.</br></br></br>  <br>  8man want to understand <br>  8man hates talking <br>  Yui said it's impossible to understand without talking <br>  8man know he's delusional <br>  he still wanted the genuine* <br><br>* do note that even 8man can't really define it, but most points learn toward complete honesty, for good or for ill, instead of preserving shallow and superficial bonds.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What was Yukinon being unfair about?</br></br>  <br>The election<br><br>Yukino still butthurt about it, and Yui told her it's her fault for not telling them about what she wanted properly.</br></br></br>  <br><br>How did Yui know, Yukinon told her? But judging from the reaction, Yukino is just butthurt that they didn't understand her wish. Student council president is something she would like to have, but not necessary needed, am I correct?</br></br>  <br>not just the election. The club atmosphere soured after the Kyoto trip and both Yui and Hikki kept it in a stagnant state by trying to smooth things over by pretending nothing was wrong. Yukino kept quiet about it since she thought they didn't want to address the issue.</br>  <br> Student council president is something she would like to have, but not necessary needed, am I correct? <br>Exactly<br><br>Yukinon was butthurt that Hachiman removed the necessity factor, and Yukinon is too autistic to realize that yes, she actually wanted the position for real.<br><br>What Yukino did was a bitch move, but not entirely hard to understand. Plus, Hachiman is an asshole for not following Komachi's suggestion to talk with Yui and Yukino properly.<br><br>Of course, Yui pretending that nothing happened didn't help at all. No one is innocent in that conflict.<br><br><br>That too</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope, I don't really have any need to since I'm specializing in digital marketing, so English is all I need to know for the most part (but getting used to Indian accents are definitely a thing). The only languages I'm fluent in are English and my native language.<br><br>As for the books, well it depends on whether you want to learn about micro or macro more. Then there's the fact that the majority of books on economics are really dry textbooks.<br><br>If you want just a basic overview then I highly recommend Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science. The book talks about the market, and the pros and cons of government interventions, and how not to fuck up an investment. Pretty good read, and definitely easier on your brain than the textbooks.<br><br><br>It's not really biased in the traditional sense. It's just there is a real possibility of him misinterpreting the importance of certain scenes simply because he wasn't paying as much attention to them as he would to a Yukino scene. Like the Yui scene where it was pretty much an indirect confession of sorts.<br><br>It's not malicious bias, but it is still considered bias nonetheless.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  WHEN THE FUCK DO THEY ANNOUNCE THE MOVIE?  <br> American market system is completely based around the idea of competition. <br>Not really there is actually a really large monopoly in the NA especially when it comes to Internet Service Providers and Mobile Operators.</br></br>  Like, the license is appreciated, but the timing of it sucked. Fans are most hyped about it now, with S2 having just passed. Apparently to Yen Press, cashing in is more important than being considerate to the people (or person, in this case) who contributed to creating the demand for it.  <br> Internet Service Providers and Mobile Operators. <br>Ah yes, the dreaded ISP war.</br></br>  If Hikki didn't stomp down Yui's suggestion at the end of vol 11 what did Yui expect would happen? Forcing a non-genuine relationship between everyone was not really going to do anything but prevent severe emotional pain of rejection. Did she think that her and Yukino were just going to fall out of love with him?  <br>Once again, monopolies are actually allowed in certain circumstances. In the case of American internet and telephone providers there's this thing called a Natural Monopoly. I'm not going into the specifics, but this kind of monopoly is allowed on a local level due to the fact that if done otherwise it could end up being a clusterfuck infrastructure wise. <br><br>In the case of Internet Service Providers and them being a bunch of twats. Well technically speaking that shit shouldn't be allowed, but because of a loophole in the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which ironically was supposed to prevent monopolies, let them do that shit. <br><br>That recent thing with the FCC helped a bit, but there's still a long way to go before that particular situation gets more reasonable. The internet and how it should be distrusted is still a huge gray area in economics since it is largely uncharted territory. And unfortunately I don't know that much on how it is handled, since I'm a marketing guy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where do I find the pdf collection?</br>  <br>She knew Hikky would stop her, she just forced the outcome to come faster</br>  <br><br>Thanks for the recommendation. Also sometimes I wonder do the Indians really speaks English? (Glad that you are used to it.) On the other hand, I can understand (mostly) what Russians try to convey even with their bizarre vocab and grammar.<br><br>Did Spyro go back and correct the part he was biased about?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Over here in the EU such monopolies don't exist, wherever you are in the country you are free to choose from any ISP or Mobile Network that exists. And thus there is actual true competition between such companies over here.</br>  <br>mega:#F!GRkyET7Z!YLFw2JE0pC6OTd3CAw<wbr>VwkQ<br><br>Does anyone have 10.5 PDF? I can't find any with google-san</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>What about his IRC?<br>Can't find it in his about page.</br></br>  <br> Did Spyro go back and correct the part he was biased about? <br>The fuck is this bias meme? It's not even a mistake, commie just find a slightly better translation.</br></br>  <br>If it changed the meaning of things this much, then it might as well be called bias</br>  <br>That's an impressive collection. Thank you, anon.</br>  <br>I decide to import all that shit to my account.</br>  <br><br>Oh, and thank you pdf anon.</br></br>  <br>She knew that 8man will stop her.<br>She knew.</br></br>  <br>No problem anon, and last I checked he fixed it after the episode involving that particular scene aired. Apparently he wasn't aware of the ambiguous wording (once again, likely because he doesn't pay much attention to Yui scenes as much as he does Yukino's), and Commies translation motivated him to fix it.<br><br><br>EU is overall better than the American economic policies in my honest opinion. Though I only say that since I'm a very "consumer first" type of guy. In America people tend to treat businesses more like people than they treat actual people, which is really fucking strange. <br><br>Though the EU has it's own share of issues, but that's mostly a government problem rather than an economic problem for the most part. <br><br><br>I'm not talking about bias in the way the Yukino haters use it as a buzzword. I'm talking more in the unintentional, but nonetheless existing bias that may colour the way he translates certain scenes. <br><br>Once again, using the Yui scene as an example. While Commie found a better translation, that was because of the visual aid of the anime. When Spyro was first translating the scene it's very likely he overlooked it because he simply didn't pay as much attention to it as he would a Yukino scene.<br><br>It isn't intentional bias on his part, but just something inherent to a shipper. He has his eagle eyes on searching for more meaning in a scene if it's one that holds more of his interest (I.E a Yukino scene).<br><br><br>Last I checked no. There was one anon a while back who said he'd make a PDF of it, but we haven't heard from him since.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Iroha &gt; YY<br><br>Debate me</br></br>  <br><br>Did she knew 100% deep down? It seemed like she was prepared for her proposal to work. <br><br>I am just wondering what she thought would actually happen if her proposal worked. Did she really think she would stop being in love with him?</br></br></br></br>    <br>there is some .epub file in mediafire folder though</br>  <br>I respectfully disagree.</br>  I don't care if Iroha doesn't win. I just want to see some well drawn doujins featuring her.  <br>No</br>  <br>You have to always have a plan B, I'm sure she knew he would reject the proposal. But given that he did not, she would win the 8man, and just delay the inevitable "go help yourself, faget<br>" Yukino development.</br></br>  <br>It's all a matter of personal preference</br>  <br> Did she think that her and Yukino were just going to fall out of love with him? <br>at that point she probably noticed Yukino's feelings for 8man and got scared at the possibility of NTR and Club Drama so she suggested to keep the way things are. To avoid somebody getting hurt. Desperate times calls for desperate measures i guess.</br></br>  <br>Specifically Yui requested that they maintain the status quo until someone wins the sensei-bet and let the winner be chosen that way.</br>  <br> got scared at the possibility of NTR <br>Shame, would have been awesome to see it in Yahari properly</br></br>  <br>Your taste =<br><br>My Taste =</br></br></br>  I want Hachiman to touch Yui's yahallos  <br> gives her chocolate to 8man directly, making it extremely obvious that she made it specifically for him <br> respectful enough not to give it in front of the other girls <br>I concur, I'll throw my support into this as well. Though I don't really have anything against YY.<br><br><br><br>Has there ever been a series where the girls didn't give a fuck about each others feelings? Because I feel like every series has the classic "I want them to be happy" or "let's have a fair contest!" go at it, but never have them actually spite one another for it. <br><br>Real life romantic conflicts rarely go that smoothly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want Hachiman to insert his shaft into Yukino's womanhole.</br>  <br> Yui's yahallos <br> not Yui's yuis </br></br>  <br>He would have to it against her will though.<br><br><br><br>So Yui had no intention of falling out of love with him?<br><br>It was a cowardly move she pulled, it is like she trusted 8man not to agree to it. I can see why she could be considered unfair. <br><br>She looks so happy that he stopped it though</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   There were people yesterday doubting Sypro     <br>But that's Hayato' job m8</br>  <br>I would love a series where the girls actually don't give a shit about the other one and just go full force for the guy.<br><br>Also, the guy needs to not be a beta pushover but hopefully not full alpha-cunt either.</br></br></br>  <br>White Album 2 says hi, literally what you are describing there.</br>  <br> She looks so happy that he stopped it though <br>IMO it was more akin to her feeling relief. 8man basically telling her that whatever happens happens</br></br>  <br>Nothing against YY either, but Iroha is better definitely</br>  <br><br> Tobe and the rest aren't just gonna pop in and go "Gotcha", are they... <br> What are you saying, you live here Hikki. <br><br>Everytime.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw I downloaded it but kind of just added it to my backlog thinking it'd be some sort of True Tears bullshit </br>  <br> Even after 10.000 years later Noefags still mad. </br>  <br> True Tears bullshit <br>There's going to be tears alright, depends on whether or not you enjoy the taste of them or you end up drowning in them. But there will be tears.<br><br><br>I kind of wonder how much would have changed if Iroha was introduced early on. I bet some of the more lackluster volumes would have been much more bearable if that were the case. <br><br>Then again part of Iroha's appeal is the fact that she is great even as a late character. <br><br><br> thinking Noefag asspain is the longest running <br>You should check out Pokemon shipping spots, makes all this waifuwar shit in these threads seem like a nice calm tea party in comparision.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yahari Ore is like White Album Lite.</br>    <br/>  <br><br>So who's the true winner in that anime? Setsuna or Touma?</br></br>  <br>Watch and find out.<br>It's part of the ride.</br></br>  <br>Touma's butt hurts</br>  <br>I don't know how the hell you remain unspoiled till now (especially when 90% of WA2 threads open with the same screencap) but do yourself a favor and just watch it.</br>  <br><br>  last I checked he fixed it after the episode involving that particular scene aired. <br><br>in the epub too?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I already watch it.<br>I just didn't understand the ending. The MC true love is Touma but she became too autistic and fled to another country because muh dream. <br>And in the ending credit, Setsuna is hugging the faggot MC in the back, refusing to leave him although he doesn't love her.</br></br></br>  <br>Exactly</br>  <br><br> Pokemon <br> shipping <br><br>What the fuck are they doing?</br></br></br></br></br>  Who would take the rejection worse between Yui and Yukino? <br><br>I think Yui would, she has invested so much into her romance with him she would be destroyed by a direct rejection.</br></br>  <br>is he not in brazil?</br>  <br>Based. <br>Now where the fuck is the last part of chapter 1</br></br>  <br>In the VN:<br> Setsuna won the hardest <br> Touma won the corniest </br></br></br>  <br>It's like poetry.</br>  <br>More importantly: which girl's rejection will wound 8man the hardest? Yukino or Yui?</br>  <br>Touma won, but choose her dream over her love. Setsuna choose to keep loving Haruki regardless and that's how it ends.<br><br>Now we wait for CC&amp;CODA VN translation or anime adaptation or learn moon. So we can get the rest of the story. But since it's a VN the two girls all have their winning endings anyways.<br><br>Detailed CC&amp;Coda Summary here for now:<br>http://mdzanime.me/2013/12/29/white<wbr>-album-2-concluding-chapter-coda-ro<wbr>ugh-summary/<br>Enjoy.</br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Apparently the newest season is causing the Tumblr/Deviantart nutballs to go berserk. And it's bloody glorious. <br><br>The golden stuff usually gets posted whenever there are those occasional pokemon threads, so if you browse the archives you should fine them pretty easily. My favorite is the one where that one delusional Misty shipper made it their headcanon that the new girl was some sort of Yandere stalker. Pretty great for a quick laugh.</br></br></br>  <br>I am a Yuifag,<br>does it make me a Setsunafag by default?</br></br>  <br>Yes. Better than being a Toumafag.</br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>No,  but I am Yuifag as well as Setsuna fag </br>  <br> http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/<wbr>wiki/Shipping</wbr> <br>Have you seriously not seen them? You haven't seen a true shipping war till you've seen a Pokemon shipping war.</br></br>  What is the archetype of the girls in WA2?  I have a feeling this will end in platonic love  <br>Nice girl and autistic girl.</br>  <br>There don't really fit into standard archetypes like that but I guess:<br>Setsuna is normal nice girl, Touma would be closest to a kuudere.</br></br>  <br>Best girl<br><br><br>Worst girl</br></br></br></br>  Slutsuna a shit  <br>Setsuna - School Idol but is secretly a dork outside school<br>Touma - Icy bro character, teaches MC how to play guitar and stuff<br><br>Both are much more likable than double YY</br></br></br></br>  <br> Both are much more likable than double YY <br>Incorrect</br></br>  <br><br><br>I don't want to look at them. Shows like this is tolerable with shipping since at least the girls is interested in the guy, albeit sometimes really vaguely. Shows like Infinite Stratos the shipping is the main business as the show is base around it too.<br><br>But Pokemon? Like really? I haven't watch it in ages but isn't it about trainers training their Pokemon and fighting together with their Pokemon? Why shipping is a thing in such a show?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Shows like this <br><br>By that I mean Yahari.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Tomato Sauce goes around with different girls every season or more, doing Pokemon things. It's only natural you'd end up pairing him with your favorite girl.</br>  <br>Every season Ash is with a different girl<br>Of course shippers are gonna ship, and in Pokemon they take it to a whole new level because of how long the seasons are.</br></br>  At least pokemon shippers are better than avatar shippers. Now those people are wastes of space.  <br><br><br>Pokemon got seasons? That's news to me. If Ash is with a different girl every season, then there is even less reason for a shipping war. No matter how hard you ship, the girl is not coming back.</br></br></br>  <br> No matter how hard you ship, the girl is not coming back. <br>Err, anon that's the problem<br><br>Shipping war happens BECAUSE the girls always come back for one arc or two.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Different region: different season<br>The girls do come back occasionally, that's when the fanbase goes ballistic</br></br>  <br>Sometimes previous girls get camoes or episodes where they cross paths with.</br>  <br>But they come back, for specials, and when shit happens and what not.<br><br><br><br><br> girl comes back <br> flirts with boy <br> current season girl goes tsun <br> cue the horrors of pokemon shipping <br><br>Same if current girl is too close to ash and previous girl makes a comment about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Can't they just, like, train their Pokemon or something? The only girl I remember from it is Misty, and that's the time they travel together with Brock. Their relationship is ABSOLUTELY not romantic at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You go a boy and a girl traveling across the globe solo, camping out together and practically spending their daily lives together. How do you not ship?</br>  <br>Yes they train their pokemon<br>But there are some moments where there are subtle romantic hints that you wouldn't even notice as a kid<br>Not to mention shippers will always ship even when it's hopeless, that's why pokefags have the longest and hardest waiifu wars</br></br></br>  <br><br>Hence the Brock. Didn't he following Ash all along?<br><br><br><br>Well, kinda true. I didn't notice yaoi undertone in CCS when I was young too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Broke was always Nurse/Police woman chaser, he was never a problem in the pairing. He was a sideman.</br>  <br>Brock was barely relevant in his time with Ash, and there were arcs when he leaves to do something and Ash is alone with the girl for 20~ episodes</br>  <br><br><br>Hmm... so the show itself also encourage shipping. I never noticed it and moved on when after I grow up. It is hard to understand shippers war anyway, Pokemon or not.</br></br></br>    <br>I want Haruno to do this in front of Yukino</br>  <br>I want Haruno to do that to me.</br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br>I want Iroha to do that in front of Haruno</br>  <br>I want Megumi to do that in front of Iroha</br>  <br><br>I want Hayato to do that infront of Ebina.</br></br>  <br>I want Yukino's car to do this in front of Yui's dog.</br>  <br>I want to do that to Iroha in front of Komachi</br>  Tobe is Iroha's osananajimi  <br>I want Yumiko to do that in front of YY.</br>  Thread is dead  <br>I want thread to do that in front of dead</br>  <br>Spyro is ded</br>  <br>I get the feeling that Yahari fans have some sort of saliva fetish.</br>    Since it's tanabata, let's see what our main　cast wished for!<br>Hachiman: I want something genuine...<br>Iroha: Senpai&lt;3 I want to go to a hot spring<br>Yukino: I want to go to Destinyland<br>Yui: Yukinon doesn't just like cats, but likes giant pandas as well!!<br><br>How was that even a wish, Yui?<br>But Irohasu you're just as sly as ever.<br>いろはすあざとい</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When didn't Yukino let him kiss her?</br>  <br> against her will </br>  <br>I meant why rather than when.<br><br><br>I never said that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Does Yukino like 8man?

Can someone assure me of this?  I thought Yui would stop crushing on 8man as the story went by. But that isn't what happened, she fell in love with him even harder. It is deep love at this point.  <br>It's 100% friendship.<br><br>She's just confused since she has never had a genuine friendship.</br></br></br>  <br>Two shits.</br>  <br>She attracted to him platonically<br>I bet she even wants to kiss him platonically</br></br>  <br>Nah, see the difference?</br>  <br>Would she want him to coat her womb with his seed platonically</br>  <br>She even wants to raise his children platonically and after living a happy and fulfilled platonic life with him, she would die platonically in his arms</br>  <br>Yui only likes Hikki as a friend.

Literally nothing got resolved.</br>  <br>Did you expect the series to resolve itself 1-2 volumes before the ending IE the actual resolution?</br>  <br><br> implying animes aren't used to advertise the source material <br><br>want a resolution? buy vol12 when it comes out</br></br></br></br>  <br> buy vol12 when it comes out <br>Who knows when will that be.<br><br>Isn't Wateri supposed to chum out side volumes with every BD volume?</br></br></br></br>  Happy birthday to the best oneesan~  <br>Nigga that ain't even the best onee-san in the series.</br>  <br>Buy le LN</br>  <br>It's just a cliffhanger until the Movie.<br><br> Gekijouban: Yahari Ore no Kouhai Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru </br></br></br>  <br>It's a  recap movie </br>  <br>No, it's  live action with movie original ending </br>    <br>Bai bai Hikki</br>    <br>N-no</br>  <br><br>christ</br></br>  <br>Is that a guy</br>    <br>What is that collar...</br>  <br> Iroha: Senpai&lt;3 I want to go to a hot spring <br>Fucking hell, just take her there 8man.</br></br>    <br>Why is Watari dressed as Yui?</br>  <br><br><br>いろはす～</br></br></br>    スカーフ はす～  <br>Woah</br>  I just finished the series, Yui seems to be the best girl but Yukinon is great too.<br>Is the triangle relationship the only good option?</br>  <br>it demonstrates that he is now her property.</br>  <br> But she never put that in her mouth. <br>You have no idea.</br></br>    <br>8man loves Komachi the most</br>  <br>Well, the problem is  8man seems to like/adore one girl and getting close to her as a figure/person but he's also loving and trying to get over his trauma in order to cross the line with another girl. </br>  he has yet to:<br><br> give yui's "someday" <br> take responsibility for iroha <br> help yukino <br><br>how's that gonna fit in 1 volume?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He did help Yukino</br></br>  <br>He's going to ignore all of them and fug sensei</br>  <br>I like to imagine that Yukino is the one saying "No" in that picture.</br>  <br>I think the aquarium date was Yui's someday.<br><br>Taking responsibility for Iroha is an ongoing thing.<br><br>Yukino's was about to make a request at the end of the last volume.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i seriously don't get that part, she almost accepts yui's proposition if 8 man didnt stop it then says "don't tell me how i feel" at the end</br>  <br>He is going to take Yui on another 1 on 1 date because he has a code of honor. Not sure what other role she will play if 12 is the final Volume<br><br>Iroha...yeah I dunno how relevant she is going to be<br><br>Yukino is going to be relevant until the series concludes since everything pretty much revolves around her character</br></br></br></br></br>   OTP <br>I remind them.<br><br>Also a gift to Spyro.</br></br></br>  <br>She was going to accept so she doesn't end up getting hurt, 8man basically tells her to wake up and face reality.</br>  So now that we know what's going on with Yukino, a lot of the earlier scenes with Yukino can be seen in a different light<br><br>Basically what has happened is that Yukino has surrendered to Hachiman's way of thinking in the early episodes. We see her at the beginning and she has all the ideals about improving yourself, helping others, changing the world, etc. What she really wants though is to improve herself. Meanwhile Hachiman believes it's pointless to change yourself or the world. His solutions always sidestep personal improvement and rely on manipulation or understanding social situations to get out of problems. <br><br>Yukino watches this and sees how Hachiman's way of thinking produces better results again and again. It gradually wears down her resolve. What is ironic is that as she's becoming closer to Hachiman's original way of thinking, he is getting closer to her original way of thinking. He no longer rejects change or self improvement.<br><br>Anyway I think in the next volume Yukino's family is going to intervene to try and separate Yukino from the service club and Hachiman in particular. Yukimom would have several reasons for wanting that. Aside from whatever hopes she might have for Hayama/Yukino, she is never going to accept Yukino having feelings for some middle school loser with rotten eyes and little prospects. Plus she can point to how Hachiman seems to have 'ruined' Yukino even further. Whatever feeble improvement she had shown has been wiped out and she's as bad as she's ever been now.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah I know, but if their main goal is to find genuine why was she even lying there at the end. It's basically in similar character to "I was just pretending to be retarded posts"</br>  <br>http://i.imgur.com/9uUftqR.gif</br>  <br>No I will remind everyone</br>  <br>As expected of a TL who has the best girl as his waifu. There is a God and his name is Spyro.</br>  <br><br>Her "don't tell me how I feel" to Yui is her trying to save face I think. She was about to accept Yui's proposal, Hachiman intervened and shamed her basically, now she's backtracking.</br></br>  <br><br> give Yui "someday" <br>This will be the chapter where the 8bowl is decided.<br><br> take responsibility for iroha <br>Ongoing, as per  but not really a factor going forward.<br><br> help yukino <br>Already "helped" her at the aquarium, plus it's the central plot of 12</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's just how Yukino is, she's dishonest about herself so she puts up a front of overconfidence.</br>  Can someone explain to me why Yukino was fine with Hachiman's social suicides in season 1 but she just changes her viewpoint on it in season 2? She was even fine with how he fucked Sagami verbally. Did she just fell for him right then and she cared a lot more? Or was it something else?    <br> he fucked Sagami <br>Yukino NTR fetish confirmed, 8man is secretly fucking Haruno</br></br>  <br>It wasn't shown well in the anime I think, but basically the Sagami case WAS the turning point; that brought a lot of grief crashing down on 8man's head, unlike their prior cases.</br>  <br><br>I think it gradually happened. Once it became something that he was going to make a routine of her hostility to it increased in proportion to how much she cared about him.<br><br>There are other factors than just the 'self suicide' though. With the fake confession, it made her reexamine what she thought was their shared hostility to insincere relationships.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>YY weren't there in person for the sagami scene, the fake confession was the first time they got a up close look at how 8man did things. <br>It also doesn't help that they already liked him when he pull the confession stunt.</br></br></br>  <br>They weren't there, but word got out about it and practically everyone in the school had a massive hate-on for 8man for a while.</br>  <br><br> OTP <br>Wrong files, the both of you.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do I see a Ryuuji in 8man? Not talking about the appearance, of course.</br>  <br>Soon.</br>  <br>I always wondered, why did Yukino lean in like that?</br>  <br>I don't think the 1 on 1 date will actually happen.<br><br>8man will pester Yui because the convenience of the 3p date left him unsatisfied after he resolved to seriously try to address/humor Yui's feelings.<br><br>That's when Yui will confront him with the fact that the reason he won't let go of that date because of a sense of obligation rather than returning her feelings. This is how 8man will realize he's not being honest by tolerating/humoring Yui's feelings, instead of making it perfectly clear that he won't return them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>0/10<br><br>Shitty, contrived, and "obligation" and "humoring" Yui very obviously has nothing to do with why he wants to go on the date.</br></br></br>  <br>The reason he feels want to go on another date is because Yukino tagged along for the aquarium one and the promise date was just between the two of them<br><br>Whatever happens beyond that no one knows</br></br></br>  <br>He literally went with the mood when he asked her out, there are no special reasons behind it.<br>But Yui tried to waste his promise on a 3p date, so he'll just give her another chance to convey her feelings properly. Her ship is most likely going to sink soon.</br></br>  <br> Suki nano <br>No answer.<br><br> pulls hand out from hers <br>Makes an excuse instead of giving his real reason.<br><br> hair grooming <br>Clearly uncomfortable the entire time.<br><br>Since becoming friends 8man has been soft on Yui's romantic advances despite not accepting them. If you actually think the promise date is our of anything other than obligation you have not been paying any attention to their interactions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Her ship is most likely going to sink soon. <br>I heard that one before. Remember when /a/ was convinced that vol 11 would sink her? Now she is in better shape than before.</br></br>  <br> He literally went with the mood when he asked her out <br>And Iroha went with the mood when she asked Hayama out.<br><br>In Yahari between "mood" being genuine and non-genuine, there is more precedent to it being non-genuine.</br></br></br></br>  <br>to get a closer look of the bandages she was tying</br>  <br>Not that anon, but Iroha didn't ask Hayama out solely because of the mood.

Unless a girl gets a boost in romantic writing, all will sink.</br></br></br>  <br>She's basically equal to Yukino now which isnt saying much since Yuki is at her lowest point in the series and 12 is probably her "redemption" novel that also starts to tie up loose ends</br>  <br>He went with the mood because he had been thinking about stepping over the line with Yui for some time.<br> summed up his current situation with YY perfectly already.<br><br><br>Not even worth addressing since you completely misread the mood when she took his hand during the genuine scene.

I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the hidden technological advancement of the central MP and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.

Please don’t come with us. <br> Shadis: Wait. Are you gonna ask your son to avenge? <br> Shadis: If all you wanted was to avenge Carla… Why can’t you do it yourself? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shadis: You are not like me… You’re someone special. <br> Shadis: I see that kid isn’t one either… right? <br> Shadis: Perhaps he isn’t the chosen one either. <br> Shadis: Right? Are you really gonna curse the rest of his life? <br> Shadis: If he’s not the one to do this job, what will you do then? <br> Grisha: This child isn’t like you. He is my son. <br> Grisha: Please… Stop meddling in our affairs. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>BTFO</br>  <br> Shadis: Lightening? </br>  <br> I-I'm not the only one who is not special Grisha! Y-your kid too! <br>This guy is cringeworthy.</br></br>  <br>The situation is really common, Isayama just escalated it.</br>  <br><br> Shadis: If all you wanted was to avenge Carla… Why can’t you do it yourself? <br> still didn't get a fucking answer <br>Goddammit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Shadis: Afterward, I brought you back to the shelter… And this is all I know. </br>  <br>So he already killed the Reiss at this point? Or is it supposed to happen soon?</br>  <br>The Reiss knew Grisha, they were gonna hunt him down.</br>  <br>Based Grisha.</br>  <br>So Mikasa didn't have to do anything with this afterall.</br>  <br>So was Keith indirectly the reason for Eren getting the coordinate instead of Grisha doing it himself?</br>    <br>He was eaten by Eren right after that, so he already killed Reiss by this point.</br>  <br>Common or not, Keith a shit.</br>  <br>That's weird though. I bet she was just pretending to be sleeping and followed them.</br>  <br>I don't think Keith said those.</br>  <br>"The Reiss" is just Rod and some MPs. Grisha killed them all and took the coordinate remember?</br>  <br> Eren: This is all…? <br> Shadis: That’s all. <br> Hanji: Now I finally understand why someone so experienced like you would retire from the front line to the training corps. <br> Hanji: You aren’t doing this to amend for your fruitless efforts which caused so many comrades to die in vain… <br> Hanji: You’re doing this after realizing that you are no longer that special someone, and that you’ve developped this intense inferiority and guilt complex. Right? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>IF I SEE THAT TITAN ONE MORE TIME....</br>  <br> Hanji is disappoint </br>  <br>Fucking Hanjo preaching the truth.</br>  <br> hating irrelevant characters <br>How do you deal with life with such autism?</br></br>  <br>PUTAIN CA CLASH DIRECT</br>  <br>I thought Hanji was going to smack him down and call him a pathetic loser too for a second.</br>  <br>But where the hell was Grisha's corpse?</br>  <br>He's raging about his special complex. It's gotta be him.<br><br><br> Hanji: You retreated back here for such a childish reason… <br> Levi: Hanji, stop. <br> Hanji: You don’t get to pick and choose how important those information are.  <br> Hanji: Stop relating these to your own goddamn inferiority complex. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Biggest mystery so far. It could have evaporated. It could be that after shifters die, their bodies evaporate.</br>  <br>Wow, I thought I was the only Muslim in this thread. are you a girl maybe?</br>  <br>Eren's bubble?</br>  <br> pointing out facts <br> hate </br></br>  <br>You forgot some lines</br>  <br> It's gotta be him. <br>The arrows don't point at him though. If anything, it would sound like Grisha throwing irony.</br></br>  <br>Funny how Isayama shits on all the characters who were badass or cool when they were introduced. There are no heroes in this world.</br>  <br>Looks like you skipped the last two bubbles</br>  <br>His clothes too?</br>  <br><br><br>Is this the new Leviface?</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe the shifter bodies evaporate like the titan's after the spine is out</br>  <br> Hanji: the so called “give your heart to humanity” all for the same reason, right? <br> Eren: Please stop, Squad Leader Hanji. <br><br> Eren: The instructor is right. I’m.. nothing special. <br> Eren: I just happen to be the son of that special someone. <br> Eren: This is the reason why Dad passed down his titan power to me. <br> Eren: What a relief now I finally found the cause of this… <br> Shadis: Your mom… once told me something like this. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eren was conscious after eating Grisha. He probably walked a bit before collapsing.</br>  <br>MT is gonna turn out to be some pathetic loser too and when that day comes I will be 10/10 mad.</br>  <br>It could've also be just too dark to see. Or Isayama being shit at consistency nothing new etc.</br>  <br>Never. MT is not like Keith or Eren, this guy is the real deal.</br>    Oh great, more unrequited love. Where have I seen this shit before? Certainly not between Eren and Mikasa, or Mikasa and Jean, or Petra and Auruo, or Marie and Erwin. What an original idea for Shadis to have unrequited love for Carla.<br><br>Isayama's writing is bad and he should feel bad. Every month I ask myself why I'm still reading this shit manga.</br></br>  <br> Carla: Does it really matter that he’s not special? <br> Carla: That he won't be acknowledged by everyone else? <br> Carla: I don't think so. <br> Carla: At least, I acknowledge this child… <br><br><br><br>Sorry I put these here </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know it deep down that his reason for attacking humanity is because they killed his waifu.</br>  <br>Because we need to see what's in the basement</br>  <br>You're reading the manga to funpost with us.</br>  <br>This is Keith's flashback after all, and Mikasa is a ninja.</br>  <br>I sure hope so. I don't want Armin to be the only intelligent mastermind in the series.

Grisha was already a well known man, he couldn't have fit in for a bit like Eren did.</br>  Did Carla know about Grisha's real identity? Would have been shitty if she died without knowing.  <br> Carla: After all, he is born into this world. <br> Carla: And to me, this is already such a big feat... </br></br>  <br> Eren saying how cute Eren looks <br>Why is this pic so disturbing.</br></br>  <br>You clearly love it* <br><br>fuck im tired</br></br></br>  <br>There's differences, though. It isn't all the same.<br>Keith hoped he'd get noticed (by not just Carla but everyone) by becoming commander and it fell on its face, Erwin realised he'd have to abandon the idea to go with what's more important.</br></br>  <br>My nigga, Hanji.</br>  <br>He's not really that cute.</br>  <br>Eren looks cute on this page.</br>  <br>He is cute in that panel. He stopped being cute once he started to grow.</br>  <br> 3 years ago <br> Shadis: That’s the look… <br> Shadis: Just like his father had thought, this kid will… <br> Shadis: Burn away his own life, and become a pile of ashes outside the walls. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Tell that to any mom.</br>  <br>Wasn't Keith talking about Carla?

He's going to visit his mom and MT is in Shiganshina.</br>  <br>Thank you, chinkfag. We missed you.</br>  <br>This was a nice chapter in my opinion.</br>  Now that I read it, I also thought it was nice.  <br> Despite putting all his might and sacrificing everything for the fight <br>His own fault he was too hung up on being special that he missed opportunities that got dumped in his lap.<br><br> finds a guy with suspicious backstory outside walls, lets it go <br> ignores new tactics </br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127746556 <br>It wasn't "good" it was "okay" the pacing is atrocious as always</br>  <br>Thank you based chinkfag</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127746556 <br>It was ok. I think the fact that it was entertaining watching Keith The Failure helped a lot than if it would have just been Jaeger backstory.</br>  Young Erwin is the only thing that matters in this chapter.  Take the cuck shit back to /pol/ and /v/.  <br>Thank you. <br><br>I know some people find them boring but I enjoy these kinds of chapters, this and 69 were really good at getting the perspective of others. Also the differences between Shadis and Erwin as characters are really striking now. <br><br>Can't imagine how much worse it felt having a squad leader try to suggest something that saves lives, rejecting it, only to return and realise that was the best option. Pretty late to do so, really.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He looks like a balding abomination.</br>  <br>The only thing what mattered was Keith getting cucked.</br>  <br>NTR doesn't have a good noun.</br>  <br> fujos <br>please kill yourself</br></br>  <br>Isayama didn't even attempt to make him look young. I guess it makes sense since it shouldn't have been too long ago.</br>  <br>He doesn't look any different and only fujos cared for his irrelevant panel. Why did people think it was an Erwin chapter again?</br>  Why didn't Keith simply drug Eren, put him in a barmaid dress and rape him?  <br>He looks so dreamy<br><br><br><br>Really? His cranial feature is much smoother.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I wish it had more meat to it but it was ok. People will now shut up abut Mikasa fucking up Eren's gear.<br><br><br>Did Keith resign right after that? Seems like he was only asking Erwin at that point and hadn't made any moves to step down yet.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because someone of tumblr overblew it saying that Isayama said in an interview that it would be an Erwin chapter even though the only thing he said was that younger Erwin would make an appearance</br>  <br>fake spoilers</br>  <br>He will soon.<br><br><br>It's because Isayama said in a conference that Erwin will be featured in the next chapter, and the exploration into his mysteries has just begun.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not sure, I assumed he'd be in Keith's flashback based on the more reliable spoilers. People just took Isayama's words too far, but he did show what he said, which was basically the part where Keith hands over command. He only said younger Erwin. <br><br><br>This too.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127746826 <br> isayama <br> cohesive <br><br>anon, pls.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127746826 <br>Now I can't look at Yeager household and not think of Keith's cucked face. Damn you Isayama.</br>  <br>Based chinkfag saving this shitty chapter</br>  <br>I didn't see anyone here say that.<br>Isayama told OnoD that Erwin would be featured, and that he finally has his backstory fully formed in his mind.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127746826 <br>The way Keith's expressions were drawn distracts you from thinking that that's bad writing.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127746826 <br> typical "I'm better than these normalfags" chuuni got BTFO like he deserved <br> unique </br></br>  <br>What do you expect from Erenfags?</br>  <br> For someone who easily falls in love <br><br>If it were that easy he would have gotten her.</br></br></br>  <br>i'm an erenfag too and even i'm not that delusional.</br>  <br>You definitely are since you're dumb.</br>  <br>Get better taste.</br>  Anything new about next month's big announcement?  What about Q&amp;As?  <br>An announcement of more boring chapters.</br>  <br> being an Erenfag </br>  <br>Oh right.

It was all just speculation at first but now it's confirmed.<br> where are you getting the spy idea from? <br>Because he was asking questions non-stop</br></br></br>  <br>Many thanks Chinkfag</br>  This is irrelevant but I want to point out this horse's ass. Isayama can't even draw a proportionate horse ass.  <br>what do you think Ymir is going to do after this chapter's developments?</br>  <br>Or Reiner or Connie</br>  <br>Annie please, contain yourself</br>  <br>then jump into a titan mouth</br>  <br>I bet he can.</br>  <br>Jesus Christ</br>  <br>Jean would tap that.</br>  <br> where are you getting the spy idea from? <br>He obviously lied about forgetting things and asked for the customs to a point that even Keith became suspicious.</br></br>  <br>Probably banned for shitposting elsewhere.</br>  <br>Does Bert's hairline keep Bertfags up at night?</br>  Speculation time.<br><br>Did Grisha truly forget? I don't think so, or if he did, he remembered soon enough.<br><br>He says he admired the SL and I think that's true, he didn't disapprove of Eren wanting to go outside and was ready to entrust him with the secret of the basement. Anyone think Grisha was building up to something big that would help humanity and the SL out, only to be interrupted by BRA?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Please respond.</br>  <br>He was in the walls for 20 years. How long does it take to built a super weapon if his civilization is so advance.</br>  <br>Probably Islamfag thinking he can ban evade on 4chan.</br>  So Grisha was fighting off titans near the Shiganshina district. What was he doing there? Did he want to breach the gate but decided against it? Or was he really looking for shelter and by doing so he pretended to be someone who suffered memory loss, there's no way he knew that Shadis would be coming right?  <br>I have constant nightmares about it.</br>  <br>He's also alone, juggling work and family. It's believable that it might take a while to develop the perfect serum or whatever.</br>    So did Carla ever know who Grisha really was? What he is? Because if she died thinking he was just a normal doctor, that's even sadder.<br><br>Carla deserved better.</br></br>  <br>I don't think she knew anything. Sad.</br>  <br> Carla deserved better. <br><br>Not really. She was a plain jane tavern sloot who was lucky enough to marry a doctor.</br></br></br>  <br> marrying the one man she fell in love with makes her a slut <br>Keith please.</br></br>  <br>He arrived in the wall in 831. he married carla in 835. He had 5 years of bachelorhood to built a weapon.</br>  <br>You know she got around well enough before that.</br>  <br><br>Also five year of not being suspicious :)</br></br>  <br>yep, I think the epidemic changed him because he fell in love with carla.</br>   Shadis was never the generic badass instructor <br> he was just a cucked manchild who was taking out his frustration on children who couldn't fight back <br> the kids still beat him anyway (Eren overcoming the tampered maneuver gear) </br></br>  <br>Being Keith is suffering.</br>  <br>Atleast he has Anka now.</br>  Was there even a need for Shadis to have been in love with Carla? I can't think of a single reason it needed to be that way.  <br>To make him even more miserable. To make him want to butches Eren's belt because he loved Carla and wanted Eren out of the army.</br>  <br>To justify him breaking Eren's gear or even bothering to help him after he ate Grisha.</br>  <br>Just like Reiner asking question about Erens titan and his formation during the female titan arc and Trost. Grisha was faking memory loss.</br>  Well, at least Shadis held no grudge against Eren  <br>Anon...</br>  <br>To self insert. He probably got humiliated in front of his crush too.</br>  Someone should shoop Snape's hair onto Shadis' bald head  <br>That doesn't change anything. Research and development is complicated, someone could work for 50 years nonstop and hit nothing but roadblocks.</br>  <br>What</br>  <br>oh give me a break he has titan knowledge. He had shifting power. He could had help the sc. There has to be a big secret otherwise it lousy writing.</br>  <br> Despite putting all his might and sacrificing everything for the fight, he still wasn’t able to win anything back. Such fights do exist in this world. <br>Damm, this was depressing.<br>Thank you, handsome chinkfag.</br></br></br>  So If Eren is the son of a cuckold who is Eren going to cuck?<br><br>Is Jean Keith so he cucks Mikasa away from him?<br><br>So EM &amp; YH confirmed by chapter 71 right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have no idea what fucking logic you used to come up with that. This is why shipperfags should be banned.</br>  <br> Implying that Eren likes Micucksa more than a sister </br>  <br> I told her that her beautiful, long black hair was beautiful <br> but then she cut it after he told her to do so <br> My faith in humanity, lost <br>They really are Keith, Carla, Shadis</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know Jean is Keith.</br>  <br> otherwise it lousy writing <br>What manga do you think you're reading.<br><br>He's still alone, with no specialized equipment except the things he can make himself. He kept it secret because he'd get into a fuckton of trouble if the government knew what he was doing. Better to present it to others when it's usable and keep it secret meanwhile.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I am just frustrated. Well i guess now we wait for status kun to do the status charts.</br>  <br>Pixis<br>Erwin</br></br>  This didn't even feel like a snk chapter now that I'm going through it again. I don't know, it just has an off vibe about it and the tone feels different.  <br>Because romance and personal dramas don't belong in this series, Isayama was right the first time. Now that he's implementing it it just doesn't feel natural at all. It's very forced.<br><br>This chapter tells me he's getting ready to draw up some drama between Mikasa &gt; Eren &gt; Historia or some other formula involving important characters.</br></br></br>  Where is everybody?  <br>I remember Isayama saying that he didn't want to add in complicated love stories and now look at this.</br>  <br>It doesn't look complicated. Keith has feeling for Carla but more feelings for the chuuni life. Chuuni life won, but he lost at the end.</br>  <br>I think what he meant was adding complicated love stories for the main cast. The outcome with Keith/Grisha/Carla was clear from the start and not complicated.</br>  <br>I just think that the whole Keith having feelings for Carla was absolutely unnecessary.</br>  <br><br> It doesn't look complicated <br>It took up a whole chapter. This was completely unnecessary.<br><br>I've been waiting for a Grisha flashback chapter since the beginning and this whole time I assumed it would either involve his being at the warrior village or his association with the military. This was complete garbage and a waste of 45 pages.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The idea of a love triangle sounds complicated, sure enough we already knew the outcome since this was just a flashback but it shows that Carla and Grisha didn't get together without hurting another person unconsciously</br>  <br>This was more about fleshing out keith than about Grisha. Sooner or later we'll learn about Grisha from his pov.</br>  <br>I'm worried about the potential EMH drama too, last chapter seemed to be hinting at that. Even if it turns out that there's no feelings between EH, Mikasa seems to have the wrong idea and it could potentially cause drama. <br><br>I always liked the way Isayama handled relationships so I hope he doesn't scoop that low. I don't mind some of the one-sided crushes. Most cases had been funny or doesn't draw much attention, but if Isayama ever put direct focus on a romantic subplot I would be very disappointed.</br></br></br>  <br>This looks more like EMJ to me.</br>  <br>You can't have a flashback of grisha because he dead. The only way is for Eren to remember. But that can only happen if he is in control of his power. By learning his mom was proud of him, he will be able to focus and gain the memories of his father and previous power holders.</br>  <br>I think it was a good way to focus in the whole point of "chosen ones" and being "important". Keith wanted so much the spotlight, he actually had the opportunity but only kept whining instead of doing something.<br>Now we have an Eren who could be, if readers are right or could change the plot, a prince, the son of a god, from a magic bloodline, a complex group of very special people. At least until now, I like the fact that he could be a no one with a big responsibility, far different from what Keith was dreaming. But, meh, Grisha is probably related to MT or was a big deal in his original town.</br></br>  <br>I don't think Mikasa was jealous. She was worried/angry that Eren was carrying around heavy stuff</br>  <br>but it shows that Carla and Grisha didn't get together without hurting another person unconsciously<br>What was the point of this?<br><br><br>This. The chapter was a waste. Isayama only wanted to see Mad Max so he made this a boring filler chapter.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't mind it if he wrote compelling and realistic romances. But he can't seem to write anything other than one sided romances and cuckolding. So yeah I kindly want to ask him to stop.</br>  <br>Nice damage control, Mikasa.</br>  <br> What was the point of this? <br>Probably trying to fill pages.</br></br>  <br>It the first chapter in a new volume and arc. Give it time anon. We have time.</br>  <br>I actually think she was jealous but it was just for comic relief and she covered it with her worry about Eren.</br>  <br>Jean's not a threat. Mikasa has no feelings for Jean, therefore can't break up Mikasa could potentially see Historia as a threat.<br><br><br>No way. She was jealous. She was jealous of Annie too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I doubt Keith &gt; Carla was an asspull since Keith messing with Eren's belt had been ta thing from the beginning but I still don't understand why he felt the need to create this kind of love drama.</br>  <br>Franz and Hana had a good romance then it ended. This world is meant for disappointed love.</br>  <br>Keith was also not a threat, which mean it's EMJ.</br>  <br>Ian and Rico did too</br>  <br>Whatever you say, Jean.</br>  <br>I think it was more the message behind it, not that the thing itself serves any importance. Keith couldn't look past himself when commanding and it all went to shit, it's the very opposite of what Erwin did.</br>  <br>To proves that not all good people have a happy ending. Plus it improved Eren moods.</br>  <br> love drama. <br>This is mostly tragedy: the pathetic life story of a character.<br>Maybe people feel uneasy to see such a loser guy?</br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't even make sense, retard.</br>  <br>Shadis hasn't got Anka.<br><br>These two do <br>Pixis as an assistant, Erwin as true love.</br></br></br></br>  <br> comic relief <br>Yeah, I got the same feeling.</br></br>  It was to show that people who think they are special are only lying to themselves.  Q: Is Keith married?<br>A: He’s single. He has sent his subordinates to their death, so he can’t allow only himself to be happy</br>  <br>This.<br><br>EH is nonexistant and this chapter confirmed they're related anyway &amp; that EM is endgame (since Eren is Grisha to Jean's Keith) and that means YH is also confirmed so EH status = BTFO^4.</br></br></br>  <br> What was the point of this? <br>It was probably to make him realize how pathetic he is and not special at all.</br></br>  <br>Manlet is Erwin's true love.</br>  <br> he actually had the opportunity but only kept whining <br>Fucking this. Grisha falls into his lap, improved tactics fall into his lap, he lets them rot.</br></br>  <br>Freedom is Erwin's true love</br>  <br>Pretty sound logic.</br>  Eren's gonna die of coordinate cancer so who will Mikasa end up with? I think it could be either Jean or a new character.  <br>You're implying that EMJ has the potential to become a thing and that Jean could cause drama between EM. Either you're a shitposting Jeanfag or you're a delusional retard.</br>  Manga endings that made you glad you read the whole thing.      <br>Ah so we're posting the opposite of satisfying endings.</br>  <br>Naruto</br>     Mx0 <br> axed <br> satisfying ending </br></br>  Needless 2 fucking when, Kami?        Houshin Engi left me pretty damn satisfied.        Manga &gt; Anime &gt; Movie.     Too bad everything written after was complete horseshit.    <br>Best one in this thread.</br>        <br>And from the epilogue.</br>  Umi no Misaki gets bonus points for having a great ending that was also a harem end.  This thread made me cry because I realized I've never once read a manga ending I was completely satisfied with.  <br>That was good, but I think that if it had ended a chapter before it would have been better.</br>  <br> equal screentime for three main girls <br> bonus loli reincarnation <br> obvious main girl who the manga is named after doesn't win (on her own) <br>Actually amazing.</br></br></br></br>    Berserk      <br>Totally agreed with you anon.</br>  <br>agree, i love the ending<br><br><br>The first three volumes Umi no Misaki are some of my favorite stuff, ever. Good ending.</br></br></br></br>  i know they screwed that ending in Last Order    oh my balls had a good ending.    <br>Fuuuuuck youuuuuuuu. I managed to finally forget how shafted Mx0 was. Meanwhile, shitty moe nonsense thrives. There is no loving mango god.</br>  <br>10/10<br><br>Right there son.</br></br></br>  Now, I might totally be alone in this, but I really liked the ending to Shigurui. I really enjoyed how the final attack between the two swordsmen was the same attack as the first time they clashed. It was really neat to see and hype as all shit. I guess otherwise, I was pretty satisfied with the ending of Change123 for what ever that means.  Gash Bell was flawless<br><br>A shame the anime never went all the way</br></br>    <br>Fucking seconded</br>    <br>And then that shitty sequel happened and ruined the entire sentiment of the original.</br>  <br>Didn't even know there was a sequel. Thanks for the warning, I'll pretend it doesn't exist.</br>  <br>The Akagi animu<br><br>Manga on the otherhand is completely insane.</br></br></br>  <br>Miura is dead. (not really he is just dead to me)</br>  In my opinion, it's quite satisfying.    <br>is he dead?</br>  <br>Nah, the sequel is good. You just have shit taste.<br>Granted it would have been better to have it feature an original character instead of Kurosawa, but the existence of the sequel literally doesn't take anything away from the message of the original.<br>This scene isn't even the ending anyway.</br></br></br>      <br>full metal panic?</br>  <br>Is that full metal panic? That guy looks exactly like sosuke</br>  <br>Damn right.<br>Pic related also had a pretty satisfying conclusion, all things considered.</br></br>    I love endings where the character walk away like pic related.  <br><br>If you haven't gotten around to it, read the Sigma manga. It's definitely worth it since, unless you can read Japanese, it's the only way to finish the series after The Second Raid.</br></br>  <br><br>Steel Ball Mind.</br></br>  <br><br> he later died of a cold </br></br>  <br><br>I just finished that about 30 minutes ago, I thought I'd be crying or depressed, but all I have is a melancholic smile on my face.</br></br>  based best girl  <br>Well it implies that life goes on instead of simply cease to move forward<br><br><br>Mah nigga</br></br></br></br>  I was extremly satisfied with the ending of Gantz.  onanie master kurosawa    <br>the ending was good but the last game was absolute garbage.<br><br><br>Never been so moved by such a short and over the top manga.</br></br></br></br>      <br>Bittersweet ending's are really good when the next best option is a tragedy.</br>  <br>A very satisfying and well thought-out conclusion</br>  I still wanted more but I was alright with it ending.<br><br><br><br>I usually avoid sports-manga like the plague but damn I'm so glad I read this one. The art is amazing.</br></br></br></br>        <br>Sports manga is such a loose term, its ridiculous to call KKNH a sports manga.</br>  <br>Does someone have the Bakuman edit where the Editor says "Mx0 and Double Arts were less interesting than Naruto so we had to cancel them"?</br>  <br>I feel like I recognise this.<br><br>what series?</br></br></br>    <br>That one about an interoverted mountain climber. Think it was base on a real story</br>    <br>Nevermind I found it</br>  <br> he actually died <br>This was such a shitty manga (dropped it I don't remember when) but apparently it concluded with a 10/10 ending.</br></br>  Really? Nobody?<br><br>It was a perfect ending. They brought every plot thread to a close and managed to make the epilogue concise but not feel rushed, so you get closure for everyone.</br></br>  <br>I know, it's usually the competitve ball-sports manga I dislike. Which is why I gave that manga a chance.</br>  <br> You will never be a member of a retired superhero team, now content to relax with your waifu and other hero bros with the knowledge that you saved Earth </br>  <br> Really? Nobody? </br>    <br>I read a few chapters, I thought he was going to end up with the redhead bitch</br>    <br>I rally liked it, There was times when everything was too cute for me, but I accidentally the whole manga.</br>  I really wanted more but I guess the ending was satisfying. It didn't feel rushed either since it was just a SoL  <br>Oi oi, don't joke like that...</br>  Jokes aside, my favorites endings were Shin Angyo Onshi, GTO, PunPun , The world only knows and the more I read I realize that a good manga doesn't necessarily need over one thousand chapters.    <br>Huh? The readhead girl isn't even in the first few volumes.</br>  <br>No wait, ignore that, I suck dicks. You are of course referring to the OTP.</br>    I had to recheck my files this had good endings:<br>Apollos Song<br>The Voynich Hotel<br>Fraken Fran <br>A girl by the Sea <br>Ping Pong<br>Parasite<br>Planetes<br>YKK<br>Sundome, but this one took a while to digest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Franken Fran <br>I don't remember that having much of an ending. Not that it needed one, really.</br></br>    <br>gotta have that trap booty</br>  <br>You finally did it. But still in line with the thread, i mean, no loose ends.</br>    One cant ever expect a good ending nowadays, most of the time one will keep reading even shitty manga and the reason is very simple.  <br>Source?</br>  <br>just found it you fucking fuck<br>don't be a shit</br></br>      <br>he comes back and they get together.<br><br><br><br>I saw only people being upset at that ending and it made me glad I dropped it.<br><br>Here's another satisfying one.<br><br>Some say the story is a bluff, or that they got separated, but whatever.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Anything from Adachi Mitsuru have a good story.  It was sad to see it end the way it did, but I really, really, really enjoyed Binbougami Ga!'s ending.    <br> Some say the story is a bluff, or that they got separated, but whatever. <br>Honestly, even if they end up separated it's still quite a nice story.<br><br>He grew from his worthless otaku scum self to be a better person, the romance is just a part of that progress.</br></br></br></br>  <br> in the end, nothing actually mattered and she got away with it. <br><br>Just awful.</br></br></br>  <br/>   <br>I got to say even though the final arc was shitty (part from kanchome and the golden book) I cried like a bitch when this happened</br>  <br>*apart</br>  <br>Ending, along with the entire last arc, was fucking shit<br><br><br><br><br>You best be trolling</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>RIS doesn't work for me.</br>  <br> Fraken Fran <br> Good ending </br></br>  <br> Anything from Adachi Mitsuru have a same story <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br>  The ending of the manga was even happier and more fulfilling than the animu  <br>Both endings were garbage</br>   tfw your waifu will never be your right hand   <br> everyone becomes a god in the final battle <br><br>This annoyed me because of the sheer amount of shonen-y it was.</br></br></br>  <br> The Voynich Hotel <br>Sayman can pump out some satisfying endings. Nickelodeon had some good shit at the end too.</br></br>  <br>Came here to post this. An old man with a puppet shouldn't be able to teach so many life lessons and make you feel so much.</br>  literally 10/10 perfect as a flower  <br>I'm still fucking puzzled as to how he was allowed to do that, but it was fucking great.</br>  The best love story ever told.  Just finished Homunculus and I'm glad I read it.  <br>I liked it better than ichi the killer</br>  <br>I'll give that one a try if it's by the same author.</br>  <br>less metaphors more gore porn coincidentally it also had a stratifying ending</br>    I think this one had a nice pacing and handled out the "drama" nicely enough, AKA in a way that does not make one go nuts.        <br>what is the moral?</br>  <br>Having a "big realization" moment wont suddenly fix everything.</br>  <br>looks familiar, is this from the mayo chicken?</br>    <br>We now bring you Miura's new work: Loli and Gorilla</br>  <br>but there's no way her piss heals right</br>  <br>this</br>      <br>The secret is that she tricked him into thinking her piss is a cure-all, and since he's an idiot, every time he gets hurt he wrings her like a lemon into his mouth. Shes just a fetish pervert.</br>  <br> Meanwhile, shitty moe nonsense thrives <br><br>Mx0 made a lot of use of moe too. Moe isn't your enemy.</br></br></br>  <br>The only chapter I remember the most is the sidekick magnet guy's dream test where he's in a harem.</br>  <br><br>Fullmetal Alchemist has one of the most satisfying Manga endings of all time.</br></br>  <br>Shamo's ending was thematically perfect i loved it.</br>  <br><br>This manga and Holyland were both fantastic.</br></br>  <br>Just finished that 2 weeks ago. Really great read. The last climb was especially exciting because of the larger consequences. I'm just glad towards the end he found his happiness in both family and mountains.</br>  <br>It sure does, Kanye-san</br>  <br><br>I dunno, I've been keeping with the series monthy since chapter 26, literally years of build up to the finale and it was all spectacular.</br></br>  <br>When the lyrics to Amazing Grace appeared I knew it was solidly in my top 10 manga list.</br>  Depressing manga but good ending. 10/10 Revenge  <br>I liked the ending to this. Pic related wasn't the ending but I just like looking at this scene. <br><br><br>my favorite jojo ending</br></br></br></br>  Thank god the brother of the Mc and the goddess saved this manga.  <br>and of course I forgot the pic <br><br>I also really like the ending to onani master kurosawa, slam dunk, and the original dragon ball. Goku outperforming "god" the creator of the dragon balls, finally winning the tournament and to be married soon. Much better the shitty Z ending.</br></br></br>  <br>I appreciated how the manga showed his loneliness. It was much better then say naruto. 8000 flashbacks of him on that stupid swing, and then he suddenly becomes friends with everyone. And even then with other flashbacks it clearly showed he had friends.  sorry to go on a tangent I just really dislike naruto. But I do think the ending was sort of satisfying. With him finally becoming hokage after a long read and all </br>  <br><br>That's because shonen is meant for little boys to read while seinen is targeted to young adults.</br></br>    Endings where all of the enemies and allies of the series come together are fantastic for me  <br><br><br>Ya'll missed out on reading this manga without this perfection in the background. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9<wbr>qvauLlmo</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Shit gives me chills and now every time I listen to that song I remember lonely ass Buntarou struggling on a cold mountain and not Interstellar. A good intrumental really enhances the experience its incredible.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No luck for me.<br> Sauce? </br></br>  So do we all agree that Kokuo no Hito is one of the best manga of all time?  <br>Isn't the scanlation still not caught up?<br>Talk about spoilers. /a/ was all over this months ago.</br></br>  Couldn't have ended better imo  Suzuka had a pretty good ending!<br><br>well untill, you know. trucks.</br></br>    <br>I can't find the source and I don't wanna be a saucefag, is this a Kiyohiko manga? Looks similar to Yotsuba</br>  <br>A cautionary tale of the dangers of unlicensed hypnotism.</br>  <br>*Kiyohiko Azuma</br>  part V will always be my favorite.  <br><br>that belongs in a series ruined by their sequels thread, like eureka 7</br></br>  <br> Those eyes <br>Greatest running joke.</br></br>    <br>Man, I don't even want to finish that manga after cellphone girl  became god . That multiverse shit was exhausting.</br>  <br>This is mayo chicken.</br>  <br>I still can't believe he dropped Sumire-17, though. The love triangle was kinda fun.<br><br>Not to mention those girls are from 17, which kinda implies 16 is a prequel.</br></br></br>  <br>Soon, Gintama will end.<br>What a beautiful ending it will be</br></br>  <br>Are you trying to make me cry</br>  The whole final chapter was just perfect.  The manga's ending was better than the anime's by an order of magnitude.  <br>Im literally hold off reading/watching so my old friend Gin doesnt break my heart.</br>  <br>Prunus Girl <br><br>Nuff said</br></br></br>    Underrated ending.  <br>i wasn't satisified, we never got to see some trap dick</br>  <br>only thing mashima did that was moderately ok and maybe the first few arcs of fairy shit</br>  <br>There are no beginnings or ends young one. The author needs rest after finishing a manga, but will eventually wake from his slumber and begin the next one. Like an eternal Phoenix dying and rising from the ashes, as long as there's spirit in the hand that hold the pen the flames of passion will never die.</br>  <br>Fucking this.<br><br> we will never get a redo of the anime <br> Viz will never finish publishing the manga <br><br>Why even live?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The final beat down is my favorite in the series. </br>  <br>Finally some posted this one</br>  Has this been posted yet?<br><br>Greatest Magic Girlfriend series ever.</br></br>  <br>what are you talking about, someone already posted it before</br>  The ending fitted it very well  <br> this ending <br> this entire manga <br>I wish there was a short sequel</br></br></br>  <br><br>I liked Akumetsu's ending way more.</br></br>    <br>At this point I would accept a new chapter of Gigantomakhia as a (lesser) substitute to Berserk. Just let us know you're still alive, Miura!</br>  <br>now that's a blast from the past. I remember reading that 8 years ago</br>  <br>Statist please. You fuckers would have me paying for a breathing license.</br>  <br>What a disgusting double entendre.</br>  Fuck you guys for not saying this master piece. Love inuyasha  <br>Fucking this. The ending was the perfect mixture of him finally getting a happy normal life and also getting slightly fucked up go almost abandoning it. I knew he would choose to climb, but I was still mad about it which split me on wanting to see him make it back or to die on the mountain.</br>  <br> magic <br><br>It's a gost uncultured shit</br></br></br>  Still my favorite after 8 years.  <br>The only manga where I was satisfied with the ending was record of a fallen vampire.</br>  Ended just like it started.  <br>Hated this. What a copout.</br>  I know it's not over, but if this had been the ending I wouldn't have been mad.  <br>I almost forgot this existed.</br>  <br>Too Calvin and Hobbes. The whole childhood soldiers on into the big wide world thing has already been done perfectly.</br>  <br>You would have the transgendered planting inappropriate ideas into young minds.</br>  10/10 manga with 10/10 ending  <br>I liked the ending of the novelization better.</br>  It may not have been very long, but Koisome Momiji was fantastic for it's entire run, and the ending was no exception.  <br> mangafox <br>Why do you do this to yourself?</br></br>  Inb4 some faggot says they broke up in real life again.  <br><br>I think I'm the only person in the entire planet who didn't like this manga.</br></br>  <br>Magic girlfriend is a genre. They don't have to be literal maho shoujos.</br>  <br>Fucking this</br>    <br>I know /a/ wont admit this but its naruto</br>  I honestly cried at the end.<br><br><br>My nigger.<br>Truly a great ending.<br><br>They're happy together but you know it won't last.<br>I love how it's not a 'now they'll be happy together forever' like most romances.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the ending for Shigurui was very good.<br>It ended perfectly, without any glamour or excitement, the fight being shit, no one watching understanding the history between those two samurai and it ends with the victor losing everything he had.<br><br>The ending simply reinforced the theme even more.</br></br></br></br>  The only way it could have ended  <br>oh so it's that kind of thread</br>  And the sweetest ending  <br>Everyone was glad that pile of shit finally ended.</br>  <br>that was pretty depressing, though<br> despite the relentless spirit of man, entropy is inevitable </br></br>  <br>no, its by the guy who did silver nina<br>It was translated and dumped on /a/.</br></br>  <br>this<br>epilogues weren't even necessary<br>those color pages would've been the absolute perfect ending to a ghost story</br></br></br>  Its kind sad to go through all the images and realize you were so addicted on going through so many manga out there that you recognize all of them.<br><br>Now I have to wait or search for more obscure ones</br></br>  <br><br>Don't give us that shit. Gorilla is incapable of thinking up an ending, so this will go on forever</br></br>   muh feels   <br>Thank fuck someone else posted this, was the perfect way to end his reign of justice.</br>  <br>I somewhat felt like the ending could have been even darker but the author felt it might have gone too far.<br>Rather than it taking place on an alternate earth, imagine if the whole thing took place on the earth of the main protagonists. <br> Killing millions of his own people, killing most of the planet just so that it can survive. </br></br></br>    <br>I have 668 series to read, plus rec. charts and I am doing a re-read.<br>Scythe.</br></br>  <br>wat</br>    <br>super underrated post right here</br>    <br> yakumo all alone <br>it isn't right anon<br>it isn't right</br></br></br>  <br>I am on the far opposite of the spectrum, too much to read.</br>  <br>well fuck you then.<br>Hope you someday run out like me and wait just like rest of us</br></br>    Nothing tops this ending though.  <br>It was decent.<br>I remember someone here getting really upset that Yusuke ended up as some noodle shack guy, which is retarded because he was never an academic type in the first place.</br></br>  Best girl always win  <br>What happens? I really need to check it out.</br>  <br>Wonder if shin lone wolf and cub is any good?</br>  <br>I originally wanted to see the old guy get fucked up, but after seeing the movie I think that would have been the worse way to end it.</br>    <br><br>they can't break up if they don't exist in the first place</br></br>  <br>My nigga<br><br>Personally, only pic related beats it<br><br>Honestly surprised no one has posted it.</br></br></br></br></br>  It was a pretty mediocre manga, but holy fuck the ending was perfect.  <br>triggered</br>  <br>They were pretty necessary. The ending without the epilogue didn't let us see them interact or explain in any way how their life was going to be. It just ended on her coming back and even subtly implied that she "spirited him away".<br><br>The epilogue makes it clear that she's going to remain on earth as a ghost, but that she's going to live with him, takes back with him, and sleep in his bed every night until he dies.</br></br></br>  <br>The "spirited away" ending was more fitting of a true ghost story, in my opinion.</br>  I wouldn't have minded some more ship fuel tho  <br>I didnt cry at the end. The ending was surprisingly upbeat. <br>I cried when it happened, and it showed Ikuru afterwards, dead to the world</br></br>  <br>You read Mars?<br/></br>  <br>Because it's not good at all. There has been tons of threads about this ending, if you check the archive I'm pretty sure you can realize it's not a good ending.</br>  <br>It is good</br>    Pretty rushed final chapter but good ending  Tezuka always knew how to wrap up a story.  <br>that did not have a satisfying ending, what about best girl akane</br>  <br>Nar, he usually just died before wrapping most things up.</br>  <br>Sounds like you're only familiar with a handful of his 150+ series.</br>  mx0 got axed, and had a shit ending. If that's a good ending, man ...  <br>I wait too, I made the mistake of choosing some series that were not done yet and for sure I wont ever pick up One Piece.<br><br>I thought she was going to disappear and that he in time he would have dealt with it and get together with the...nephew? the parent what's her name.</br></br></br>  <br>It was a joke, he's one of my faves. I'm just salty he never finished phoenix and Dororo.</br>  <br> tfw cant fap because of the feels </br>  <br> pluto <br> mediocre <br><br>it was better than Monster.</br></br></br></br>  <br> better than Monster <br>Please, Monster had a great ending.<br><br>And how do you think love roma had a good ending?<br>It was cute but their relationship was boring as fuck. The story and romance honestly somewhat got stale near the middle and towards the end.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For a Quzilax story, this was downright happy. At least the loli wasn't viciously raped</br>  Ending made me go out and buy all the available volumes.  <br>Any help with this, I tried looking but the closest was Ohno Satoshi but he's a drama actor. A list of completed harem manga isn't that helpful either. I thought I had a close match with ichiban ushiro no daimaou but I'm not sure.</br>  <br><br>Monster is a masterpiece though.</br></br>  <br> good ending <br><br>I'm still fucking pissed that samidare won when snake was best girl.<br><br>what the fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was actually really mad when he decided not to climb at first, like fuck no Mori, don't leave it at that you're finally there. It was an understandable decision but fuck, guess that goes to show tough of a choice it was, the dream he had been holding up to for over a decade or his new found happiness at home.</br>    Happy, cozy ending with a big Gyoza feast, soon.  <br> manga named after main girl <br> worst girl of all <br> dropped it <br><br><br> she didn't win <br><br><br>HOLY SHIT I HAVE TO PICK THIS UP</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Artwork looks familiar<br><br><br>Is this the same guy who did High Score Girl?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Zamurai's final fight was great but it didn't end the way it should've ended. Probably editor pressure because thematically it didn't add up.</br>  <br>How, it was an asspull of astronomic proportions.<br><br> &gt;Build up for a brain anevrism <br> &gt;I'm a doc and I say he's medically dead <br> &gt;FUCK REALITY <br><br>Also Fujisawa is an hack</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When is it ending anyway? I postponed reading it after the boss turned into a devil tube monster.</br>  <br>After chapters of rape suffering, anything was satisfactory</br>  <br>Fuck you, that wasn't satisfying at all<br> he sacrificed himself to save us... <br> timeskip <br> "hey guys, I'm alive, now it's over!" <br>It would have been far more impactful had he just stayed dead<br>Kongou banchou was going downhill before then anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love School Rumble, but I hate how inconsistent the art is.<br><br>Sometimes it's ubercharged, sometimes, he barely draws BGs.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you<br><br>It still hurts they continue Legal Drug and Gate7 over this</br></br></br>    <br>Everything by him has a pleasant ending</br>  <br>How should it have ended according to you?</br>    <br>Shame All of his series are so mediocre to downright bad tho.</br>  <br><br>Last time Gantz was brought up here, I was under the impression that many people were disappointed with it, guess I visited at the wrong time.<br><br>I was also satisfied with the ending, even if a lot of the arcs were weird, with characters that only seemed important  only to die and be revived only to die permanently for sure <br><br>what sealed the deal for me was the entire Muscle Rider scenario, and his personal ending.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>No unexplained survival. That rainy forest had a good atmosphere to just end it right there. A few pages of epilogue showing what happened afterwards were unnecessary. The cat shouldn't have gone on a trip too.</br>  <br>Oh yeah, good stuff.</br>    <br>Nakaba hates to kill his character, like it or not.<br>Coward Banchou's last big battle was completely fucking awesome and Kongou vs his brother is hilariously over the top and fun.</br></br>  <br><br>I've read the first three volumes, and art-wise, it's very good. Similar to Kojima's, but Mori also leaves his own mark on it (and IMO is a better artist overall, and this comes from someone who loves Kojima). Action scenes are also good, and like with the original LWAC, there's just enough esoteric samurai bullshit in it for it to be interesting instead of overwhelming. <br><br>The plot is okay, the biggest problem so far is the characters. The new Wolf is a badass, but he's no Ogami Itto (at least so far), and "dude from Satsuma who speaks local dialect gets dragged into a plot" is simply not as interesting as "ex-Kogi Kaishakunin now works as an assassin to get revenge". Likewise, the new villain(s) don't have shit on the Yagyu. Still, I want to see where it goes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sauce?</br>  The only ending that would be fitting for this manga.      <br>lmao</br>    Well, I had a good emotional battery from that ending.  <br>yea but the suffering after that scene made me feel bad</br>  <br>My god. How long has it been.</br>  I'm probably the only one but i like ambiguous &amp; tragic endings. Also i hate :re so i'm biased.  <br><br>Wanted to post that.<br>It was so sad yet so good, all the last 3 volumes were 10/10</br></br></br>      <br>I just funished this. Fuck you, man. Fuck. You.<br><br>I cried.</br></br></br>  I don't have the page but Mushishi had a perfect ending for the story.<br><br><br>Seconding</br></br></br>  <br>I should reread this sometime. I remember the ending almost making me cry.</br>  <br>fuck you</br>  <br>Yeah, last confession and ending were too good.</br>  <br>o i get it, when a story is turning sour, kill everyone and discuss the philosophical nature of life.</br>  It may not be the last page, but it is part of the last chapter and closes the circle in tears  <br>It ends in a cliffhanger.</br>  <br>Fuck you</br>  <br>Sakaki Mirei</br>  <br> They fucked <br>I should have expected it but didn't, it was good.</br></br>  <br><br>I still can't believe Yotsuba is still going when Azumanga was a nice and compact 4 volumes.</br></br>  top kek  <br>I have no idea what this is but I can tell it'll piss me off.</br>  Sorry I had to get this from a website but this is one of the best ending I ever experienced<br><br><br> implying we don't need more of Calvin and Hobbes-tier endings </br></br></br>    <br>The best girl won and that guy's just butthurt about it.</br>  <br>Cage of Eden</br>  <br>I've just recently read it. Fucking A-mazing. <br>Never learned how to pronounce the freaking names.</br></br>  It was good, but I blame the piece of shit daughter for all the shit that happened.  I still feel a little sad.<br><br>Watching a character evolve so greatly is the best.</br></br>  <br>Why are so few authors brave enough to ship some characters together before the very end?<br>Hell why are there even fewer who even dares to imply they fucked?<br><br>I've been on an anime and manga hiatus because I became bored of all the stereotypes like the tsundere girl, the slut who is all talk and actually a prude, dumb fucking main characters who is either too dumb to notice a girl like him or is too fucking scared to try, and worst of all the slapstick humor where the girl beat up the guy for accidents he has no control over.<br><br>I just saw Cross Ange who sadly still have most of these stereotypes intact, at least had them fuck and the main guy bragging about it to the villain to provoke him.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/a/ is butthurt that he didn't get have his waifu or anhero. They think the artist grill is only keeping him alive for her own well-being.</br>  <br> we never found out what happened to his best friend <br> shoddily resolved <br><br>0/10</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because pairing to work need development over long periods.<br><br>Most manga's these days either steer clear of shipwreaks or just tease bland one dimentional relationships then either wuss out at the ending or rarely continue with the bad ship regardless and usually throw in something extra sappy at the last second.</br></br></br>  <br>It might have had a good ending if it ended several years earlier instead of flogging the horse untill its bones were dust.</br>    <br>Ah found it, thanks bro</br>  I liked it  <br>Man DtB had such a DtB-ending.

Yui was raped by her father and her mother found out about it. Then they try to sweep the deed under the table so the father doesn't have to go to jail.

At least our p2w protagonist is an evil skeleton that wasn't to take over the world this time.<br><br>That's all I ever wanted.</br></br></br>  What is the basic plot of this?<br>Is it like those dungeon keeper games?</br>  Every thread.  <br>Did you watch the episode?</br>  <br>Well thanks anon. I just died of fright.<br><br>Now I can ditch this meat suit and become the spooky skeleton I always dreamed of.</br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't do much of either. His physical abilities let him swat anything in the world to bits. Any magic he uses is usually elemental or arcane.<br><br>Shalltear fight has him using a huge AoE death spell though. That seems like all the anime will cover up to though.</br></br></br>  <br>None.</br>  <br>Yep. And that's a gargantuan plus in my book.</br>    <br><br>Does that mean he has a... permanent boner?</br></br>  <br>That's nothing, wait till we get to sharknado.</br>  <br>What about it</br>  <br>Which one was he?</br>  <br>Yeah but not like it explained whats gonna happen next</br>  <br> that seems like all the anime will cover <br><br>F U C K<br>U <br>C <br>K</br></br></br></br></br></br>  how does this compare to GATE?  <br>Well... <br> He'll slaughter a Theocratic assassination unit in the next episode or so, with the survivors being horribly tortured and mutilated in order to gain a greater understanding on the boundaries of magic for... the rest of the series. We'll stop short of him conjuring a vast undead army to teach one of his minions a lesson about independent thought, but he does get to be a spooky super-lich before that. <br><br>Who wants a hug?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hmm true. Read the first couple of chapters in the ln, or dare I say the manga.</br>  <br>Completely different tastes and both first episodes are heavy in exposition. Can't compare anything.</br>  <br>Overlord has Albedo<br><br>Gate has guns<br><br>I don't know anon. They're pretty neck in neck right now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this superior to HS's release?</br>  <br>You are a special kind of idiot aren't you?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>when i see this, i like to imagine that the guy sacrificed his guildmates to forge an armor set with higher polygon count</br>  As an LNfag, is it worth a watch?  <br>Anything is superior than Funishit anon.</br>  <br><br>Thought so. Specially that horrible typeface choice. Has nobody told them it looks like utter shit already?</br></br>  <br>I was a bit disappointed in the quality, but it's pretty fun nonetheless.</br>  <br>YES. Thanks a lot anon, rewatching it now without the frame issues.</br>  <br> readed <br>no, thank you</br></br>  <br>the designs weren't butchered<br><br> kuribayashi <br>YES IM FUCKING MAD</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm mad with you.

The quality of the lizardmen and the lack of identifiable traits of the lizard characters probably means it's just there so Cocytus has a nice scene in the OP.<br><br>The episode count is too low for it anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll be surprised if they go that far. That would be a weird place to end it. The Shaltear fight makes much more sense.</br>  how do i read the LN's?

You have to be undead or automaton to be immune to instant death as a race. Let's look at the NPCs who would get raped if Ainz fought them 1v1 using Death Magic.<br><br> Albedo <br> Demiurge <br> Aura  <br> Mare <br> Cocytus <br> Sebas <br><br>Why look at that, everyone but Gargantua and Shalltear are not immune to death magic and we already ignore Victim obviously.<br><br>The only person who most likely isn't immune to death magic but would still shit on Ainz is Rubedo since she's a Miko. Unless she's a robo/undead-Miko.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> all guardians think he's cool as hell <br> ainz dying of embarrassment <br>The best</br></br></br>  <br>For now only the mega folder. Sky's blog is more or less nicely up to date with 4th volume but prior to that I'm not sure.</br>  <br>immunity to instant death is stated to be a standard feature on high level items and it's why Ainz's build is so ass.</br>  <br> Madan no Ou to Vanadis <br>A butchered piece of shit with best girl.</br></br>  <br>So he's anti-army, not anti-hero.</br>  <br><br>The only person who fought Ainz and hurt him good was Shalltear, whose best item is her spear which only has pure leech properties and is the antithesis of weapons like Cocytus's swords.<br><br>It's not really fair to compare Ainz's tankiness when he was tanking holy spells while he had tons of holy resist gear on secretly and getting beat on by a lance that had no bonus damage beyond penetration. Add to that Shalltear is a hybrid who excels at neither magic nor melee at the same degree as specialists.<br><br>That said, Ainz would have lost to Shalltear if she was capable of and thereby smart enough to do that friendly fire bullshit more than once, but I'm not sure if her familiars were limited cast per day or not.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Everyone thinks Hamsuke is majestic as shit <br> Ainz-sama dying of embarrassment <br>I hope this becomes a running gag.</br></br></br>  <br>The best uniform and quite posibly one of the most powerful characters.<br><br> can copy the creators down to 80% of their power <br><br>Plus all the equipment they left to Ainz, he's broken as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't kid yourself, the best girl didn't even make appearance outside of Opening. Now that was some extreme form of heresy. Neither did the best bro.</br>  <br>Yes I know, but that just makes my point even more evident. Peron didn't need to make Shalltear a vampire to counter Ainz's death magic, yet he chose to make her undead.<br><br>This also makes it so her strongest summon which is the clone also immune to death magic.<br><br>Ainz even flat out says Peron is a douche for making Shalltear so custom made to fuck him over during the fight and curses him for it. Remember most of the guardians if not all of them besides Garguantia/Rubedo/Victim were not made with the intention of seriously defending the base. They were just RP characters.</br></br></br></br></br>  How far is the WN Tl'd?  <br>Zero. The ln is what's for.</br>  <br>He's lucky he's a skeleton now because he points out how annoying and embarrassing it is to straddle so wide just to sit on the fat thing. Meanwhile everyone is admiring how he manages to keep his balance.</br>  <br>*is what's tld<br><br>The wn doesn't have Albedo.</br></br></br>  <br>I doubt anyone is going to bother with the WN either since it's canned by author (for now at least) so that he can focus on LN.</br>  I'm sure I'll just watch this for Albedo, but fuck it, she is worth.  <br>This is the point the manga missed. Overlord is a melancholic piece.</br>  <br>Fucking discarded.</br>  <br><br>You'd put your second most broken guardian in between enemies and your treasure as well wouldn't you.<br><br>I think the funniest thing about Nazarick was<br><br> design super detailed super thematic dungeon with event <br> most parties die to the first boss <br> nobody in the history of the game outside of the guildies even knew Sebastian and PA existed <br><br><br>nobody bothers with the WN because the LN is pretty much v2 of the story with added characters, a larger focus on Ainz's perspective (instead of just the perspective of servants with Ainz sitting in his throne room), and even a different path that the story takes after volume 6<br><br>Enough is different that the authoer even dropped the WN to keep doing the LN</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm satisfied with the anime ironically. Mainly because<br><br> Art and therefore girls look way way way way way fucking better than the LN and manga <br> The music was decent and fitting of the setting <br> Tigre's arrow scenes took up 90% of the budget </br></br></br></br></br>  The OP is pretty good.  <br>You're pretty good</br>  <br>By then, I am sure everyone will be "Narberal is best girl" though</br>  <br>The WN is drastically different from the LN. Well not Shieldbro drastic but more drastic than most other LNs.<br><br>Speaking of which, man I think TnY is the only LN where I'd prefer the WN version. Actually I don't even recognize it as the same story anymore. That's fucked up.</br></br></br>  That hat.  Now what does this remind me of?  I can't believe I enjoyed this the most out of everything this season  <br>Outside of the horrible start yodeling and the autotune, it was actually somewhat decent. Well and that chorus was shit. But I have heard shittier things. Stockholm syndrome incoming.</br>  Zac the Fag really hates it, as expected from this autistic fuck<br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/pre<wbr>view-guide/2015/summer/overlord/.89<wbr>902</wbr></wbr></br>   MC has to pretend to be a skellington <br> Lonely over all his guildies leaving <br> Acts evil for fun <br><br>This is the only show I've seen use the mmo setting in a remotely interesting way other than just a fantasy backdrop.</br></br></br></br>  for people who watched the at-x raw, was anything censored in hs release?  <br>Let me see...<br><br>The MC is logged into a MMORPG when the server gets taken down. But instead of getting forcedisconnected, he and his whole guild are sent to a dantasy world.<br><br>Since he liked to Roleplay as a bad guy, his guild is full of nothing but monsters and they all think he wants to take over the world.<br><br>He's actually only worried about keeping them all sade, and hopefully finding out that at least one of his old friends was logged in at the time of the server disconnect. So he tries to spread the fame of the guild name so that, if any WAS indeed online, they will hear about it and go to him.<br><br>That's the basic premise. Not bothering to spoil it because that's exactly it. Just the basic premise.<br><br>Oh, and he also loves the npcs because they were designed by his friends and he thinks of them as their children.<br><br>His priorities are<br><br> Finding his friends <br> Keeping the NPCs alive <br> Everything else <br> Fucking Albedo </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> pretends <br><br>He's a Skelton through and through now. All the way to his bones.</br></br></br>  <br>Art has been simplified drastically for the anime. Lost its gritty feel also. But different tastes I suppose.<br><br><br>I actually really enjoy the undying loyalty perspective from the guardians. The loss of Albedo is too much though.<br><br>Is the translation quality of the wn as good?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nothing really to censor in the first episode, we'll see in next ep with the Carne massacre.</br>    <br>He doesn't really act though, it's even stated that he looked at humans like ants.<br><br>He has some kindness and compassion, but it's mostly reserved to those close to him.</br></br></br>  <br> Skeletor? </br>  <br>You missed the point, nobody translated the wn, those that read it were either runologists or used machine translation.</br>  <br> This a skeleton <br>Fucking madhouse.</br></br>  <br>That's wrong. Priorities are<br><br> Keeping the NPCs alive <br> Finding his friends (which he admits is kinda fucked up given the low chances) <br> Building up the guild's foundation in the new world <br><br>He even flat out says he's alright with losing everything if it comes down to it so long as he can keep the named NPCs alive, right down to even abandoning the guild base and treasury.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he and his whole guild <br>Wasn't he the only one that logged into the game at the time? There was that one other guy, but he logged off before the end. His guild was pretty much dead, at any rate.</br></br>  <br>Buddy I think you haven't followed properly and just replied to my post without reading who I was quoting.<br><br>We're talking about Madan no Ou to Vanadis. There's nothing gritty about that LN as far as art work goes. In fact it's got tons of really chibi facial expressions.</br></br></br>  <br>Ah, right, right., I remember that</br>  <br>I meant the guild house and everything inside it at the time</br>  <br>Sauce? Google just gives more /tg/ threads and such.</br>  <br>The Devil is a part timer. But only because dfc is best girl.</br>  <br>Everytime.</br>  <br>I don't even know how I forgot that. The moment I read your post it came right back in my head. I must be getting too damn old.</br>  <br>Don't bother.<br><br>It's generic harem shit and only the first minutes look like its going to be a decent fantasy show.</br></br></br>  <br> the coolest character in the series is shown only once, then never seen again <br> the series put fucking Lucifer instead of lichbro as his sidekick <br><br>The world is full of suffering.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Too late I actually already watched it and didn't hate it. Mostly because everyone was such a dork. The harem parts were boring though like you said. OST had some nice tracks as well, so it's a win for me.</br></br>  <br>It's not even meant to be that type of show though. That lich isn't a big loser so how could he fit in a romcom?<br><br>He would have to spill more spaghetti than Ainz having to make shit up in front of his npcs.</br></br></br>  OVERLOAD  <br>Moe became popular</br>  <br>wasn't all of this in the same episode?</br>  <br> Yes. </br>  Watched this, came here, interested in ln. How far along is it? <br><br> Does he get betrayed by glasses guy, he gives me a dickish vibe <br> Does he hook up with best girl? </br></br></br>  Anyone else find the ED sort of lack luster?<br>I mean, If they had to have just images, they could of at least had one of each guardian instead of just Albedo.</br>   Yumi Hara <br><br><br>My dick. Best girl.</br></br></br>  <br> demiurge <br> dickish <br> not the greatest fucking bro of all time </br></br></br>  <br> Does he get betrayed by glasses guy, he gives me a dickish vibe <br>Demiurge's one of the most loyal guardians to Ainz.</br></br>  <br>Four volumes tld so far out of nine</br>  <br>Vampire fights him<br><br>ABSOLUTE LOYALTY</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking humies get off my board.</br>  <br>when did he got a nose, and where did it go after this?</br>  <br>No. And LN has enough material for 3 cours if they don't want to rush it to shit with less 3 eps per volume. Otherwise less.</br>  <br> skeleton <br> nose <br> smells <br>What the hell?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Wants to make the whole guild into traps. <br> Comes up with ideas so that Ainz-sama doesn't have to. <br> Bro's it up with Uncle-Cocytus <br> Got up in Albedo's grill that one time. <br>How can one guardian be so based.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Probably because his creator was the most chuuni out of everyone in the guild. Each guardian is after all, affected by their creator's real life personalities.</br>  Best girl. My body is ready.  <br>Skeleton can speak, see, cast magic, fucking move at all.<br><br>But smell is where you draw the line</br></br></br>  <br>There's like a few frames they show her true form in the op</br>  Is this better guys? changed the Ainz pic and the cocytus one  <br> Most Chuuni <br> Not Momonga <br>Just look at Pandora's actor.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks. So much better without the rubbish Funi quality.</br>  <br>Yes. Skeletons don't have noses.</br>  <br>But that's wrong<br><br>Goblin general is best girl</br></br></br>  <br> traitorous slut <br> best girl </br></br>  <br>I want them to get to the part where he uses her as a chair thinking it's a punishment and Albedo gets jealous.</br>  <br>Nigga, Cocytus looks kawaii as fuck now.<br><br>Ainz should probably be centered more.</br></br></br>  <br>Ironically characters like Narberal have more screen time than the likes of Aura and Mare. At least for now.</br>  <br>The "I can't log out so I must be in a new world and have to test it" was a bit dumb, the first thing you would imagine is that you are dreaming or something...<br><br>I'm not really a fan of the mmorpg setting, this could work as well as an actual fantasy without the mmorpg twist.<br><br>But aside of that was a nice first episode, its good to see a different MC</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Albedo doesn't fit in. nigga</br>  M'monga  <br>Momonga was formerly most chuuni in the guild, but he grew out of it. Ulbert was chuuni-ing the demon lord right up until he retired.<br><br>But yeah you gotta wonder how everyone else felt about Ainz's choice back then.</br></br></br>  <br> Not M'bonga and da spooky voodo </br>  <br> Dreaming <br><br> "I can fit my whole hand through my ribcage and touch my spine. Gotta be a dream" </br></br></br>  <br>People aren't retarded, the cliche that you can think you are in a dream when you are conscious is dumb and if it actually happens to someone it means means they have massive disconnects with reality.<br><br>This is why that shitty death march novel is so bad. It relies on cliches like that so much. He spent weeks in a new world thinking it was still a dream.</br></br></br>  <br>He already knew it wasn't a dream because everything was too vivid. In his skeleton form his senses are enhanced and much more sharp than when he was human so that theory went out the window instantly.</br>  <br> Ainz should probably be centered more. <br>can't center him more since its 6 slots. If you get me a good pic of, I dont know... Narberal? I´l add her, then there will be 9 and it can be Ainz in the middle with 4 on either side<br><br>Otherwise, could add Hamsuke I guess?</br></br></br></br>    <br>Is this suppose to be a comedy or?</br>  Anyone else's HS video stutters non stop for this series when the camera moves? Is it the show, the encode or my computer suddenly acting up?  <br>Add the Miko and make it a level 100 poster like the official one.</br>  <br>Very macabre one.</br>  <br>I dunno man, she's pretty top tier with that screen time she has. Plus isn't she the strongest of the maids?</br>  <br>I meant the cut off of his picture should be centered more into the middle of his face.</br>  I noticed the latest chapters in the LN described Ainz as he was wearing a "changpao," which frankly looks nothing like so-bin's drawings of his clothes.<br><br>Did he just change his attire or what?</br></br>  <br>All for Albedo.</br>   Yumi Hara moaning <br>oh God my dick.</br>  <br>All over the previous thread and this one, FuniShit fucked up.</br>  <br>It's a tragedy.</br>  <br>Unlikely, since there's still Lastborn who is one of the 3 npcs worthy of residing on the 8th floor aka the killing floor. But among the maids shown so far? Yeah she's the highest level.</br>  <br>God dammit. And just this one series that Senketsu Subs didn't pick up.</br>  <br>Mmm... a mix between the two? Most of the first few volumes (read as: the majority of this season) are focused on intelligence gathering, since Nazarick has been transported to a strange new world.<br>If we're lucky, a third season will feature some hapless adventurers attempting to raid Nazarick. It ends... poorly for them.</br></br>   you will never be a lich <br> you will never have your spooky skeletal bones scrubbed clean by a delicious brown elf trap </br>  <br>I don't remember that anywhere.<br><br>What volume/chapter/part</br></br></br>  <br>It's because the translator goes from jap-&gt;chink-&gt;eng so things get fucked up.<br><br>Same things happen to Cocytus' sword, which clearly isn't a whatever the chink sword the translator calls it. We can even see the picture of Cocytus wielding it, and it's just a longsword/bastard sword western fantasy type.</br></br></br>  Holy fuck this was way better than I expected. There was quality here and there yeah, but I honestly got bit sad at the MMO farewell scene. And things got super fucking awesome when mister skeleton got his posse together. I'm loving this, this is good.  I AM STILL HYPE AS FUCK  <br>At least vol4 ch4 I believe.<br><br><br>Oh, right. So he should still look like the drawings then?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Look here, anon. <br><br/></br></br>  <br>Ain't got eyes or ears either.</br>  <br>oh, but then his face would be tiny so he could fit into the slot allowed. Plus this way it looks like Sebastian's face is his other half, which I thought was a good effect. I don't mind doing such a small adjustment for you, tho.<br><br><br>get me pics of whom do you want me to include</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks anon</br></br>  <br>That is correct. It's just sky not being a moon reader can't blame him. I mean the fact that we even have people working on it is fortunate as it is.<br><br><br>This scene is actually quite different in the LN I wonder how the anime will show it, since the LN Ainz does not reveal his true face cause he's a paranoid fuck and for good reason.</br></br></br></br>  <br>(It wasn't Sky who translated that chapter, please, how hard it is to understand that the team has multiple translators)</br>  <br>I'm not on a device that lets me download/upload pictures easily, someone else show him.</br>  <br>Not really. I saw someone else complaining about it, but I think you guys have toasters instead of computers</br>    <br>My mistake then, but it was still his team no? It's not like the guy who's doing Vol 7 right now which I think is based off the Japanese raws.<br><br>Or is there a person in Sky's team that reads moon?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Goddamnit. I don't even have that because my harddrive crashed and for some reason i couldn't find my backup.</br></br></br>  <br>Anime is going to go with mix between manga and ln or something</br>  What the fuck<br> videogame MMO shit <br>Instantly dropped. I didn't know it was one of those SAO-tier trash stories.<br> game with a lot of freedom <br> popular in nippon <br>Pick one dumbass.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sky's team <br>No, Sky is giving a hand to the original team. And when the volumes run at 90k words each, you can't cover every single difference or word used.</br></br>  <br> You will never meet best goblin spec ops teamin the world <br>Why even live</br></br>  So it's SAO, but panders to the other 50% of otaku's?  <br>If you watched more than for five minutes you would see that they drop the MMO part in the first episode.</br>  <br>Your old one had really good face positioning for Ainz. It actually looked like his face and Sebas's were matched.<br>This one has Ainz too close to Sebas making their collective "face" too skinny and lacking half a nose.</br></br>  <br>This will be the anime's highlight. <br><br>She's mai waifu, so no touchy please.</br></br></br>  webm of Ainz laughing in the OP when?  <br>Kaezar should be the only one iirc and he's working on 6th.</br>  <br> oh you're not going to attack me? <br> then I hope you don't mind if I charge this super spell </br></br>  <br>Stop being so defensive, no one here is criticizing the choice of words. I merely cleared up the reasoning for the person who was curious. I have nothing but appreciation for those who work on the series.</br>  <br><br>This just reminds me of the good times I've had back in Tibia and Ragnarok Online.<br><br>Man, what I'd give to live in the world of RO, shit would be so good</br></br></br></br>   That feel when your lord is interrupting your brushie brushie   <br>I'll do a lot more than touch her, m8<br>You can watch though</br></br>  <br>the penguin is a traitor</br>  <br>Why didn't he order Albedo to do this?</br>  <br>He wanted to be clean</br>  <br>Good answer</br>  <br> Tibia will never be the same </br>  Wow, epic based Funi shitting the bed again epic!    <br>You would be stuck in a world with like less than 100 people unless you count npcs.</br>  <br>Over my  dead  body.</br>  <br>The timing was a bit off for me. I adjusted it by about 400 milliseconds.</br>  <br>that intro was really good.</br>  Here's the version with the centered Ainz face. I really think its too small<br><br>If you guys want me to include more people, its fine, but I will need pics</br></br>  <br><br>your waifu a cockslurper</br></br>  <br> Tibia <br><br>Goddamn</br></br></br>  <br>he is really loyal, but wise, he tells papa bones the facs in a way that that is always misunderstood ( the sheeps)</br>  <br>Is that a Kanji her outfit is supposed to make?

Well since he provides one platform for the releases, maybe that's to be expected.<br><br>When people don't even get facts right and start handing it out to the next person, unintentionally or not, either you let correct them or let them go.

He might feel a bit bad about it, but if it shows practical results he'll get over it instantly.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel as if I have to ask this.<br><br> How big his his dick, since he felt the need to be embarrassed of the skirt.  </br></br></br>  <br>Love it</br>  <br>That looks very different than how So-bin drew her. Or even that sketch image.</br>  <br>just who is this last born, spinel, and what is in the 8 floor? , i dont mind WN spoilers.</br>  How far do you think they will get? <br><br>I think up til the end of volume 2.</br></br>  <br>I'm watching it. The basis of the story is still the MMO shit. Even if it's only used as bait, it's shit and unneeded.</br>  <br>No way. Volume 3 at the least.</br>  <br>3 definitely.<br>Giving us 4 eps a volume.</br></br>  <br>That would be bit too slow pacing and 3rd volume's epilogue acts as a better outro scene for the season.</br>  <br>That's because you reiterate your point like 3x now, when it was unnecessary so naturally one would take it as you being upset over something. You could have left the post right at "No, Sky is giving a hand to the original team" or added the point about the site being his platform but he isn't the main contributor. The rest of the repeated fluff is gonna sound like a broken record to 9/10 people reading it since we can't listen to your tone of voice on the internet.<br><br>If that isn't the case my bad, but that was how you came across.</br></br></br>  <br> gif <br>Get out of here gramps.</br></br>  <br><br><br>It's only 13 episodes though.</br></br></br>  Secondary here. So does the guild staff just give him admin powers or what?  <br> 3*4 = 12 <br>With one whole episode to spare.</br></br>  <br>Ainz didn't even realize they were humans. That's the point. Ainz is too dense and misunderstands everything. Mainly because he's not an NPC and thereby isn't created with mutual understanding unlike Cocytus whose viewpoint we see.</br>  <br>guildmaster powers</br>  <br>BEACH EPISODE</br>  <br>They already slow the volume three fight in the op</br>  <br>It was like that in the beginning, but eh, its just a few clicks away<br><br>Also used a shot from the episode instead of the ending for Albedo, let me know if you'd prefer the ED version. Im going to use it with that one for my own wallpaper</br></br></br>  <br>Fixcocytus to that kawaii one and it's literally perfect</br>  <br> Ainz in swim trunks <br><br>Pft</br></br></br>  <br>Boosts his magic output and gives various other abilities.<br><br>I don't think much has been said about it yet.</br></br></br>  <br>Spinel is the last sister of Albedo and Nigurdo.<br>Lastborn is the final member of the maids and is the leader when they use the 7 star formation instead of the usual 6 under Sebas' command.<br><br>The 8th floor is where the guild brings out the big guns and is for all intents and purposes the final line of defense of the base. Everyone who resides here has an important purpose in repelling invaders unlike the rest of the guardians. That Gargantua isn't even part of this level says a lot about the strict requirements.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sun bathing brittle bones Ainz</br>  <br>I meant like your old one (), it's more centered than your new one () so it actually matches Sebas's face.</br>  <br>11/10, I came</br>  <br>which one's the kawaii one?</br>  <br> Albedo gives him a pair of see through when wet trunks. <br> Spends whole episode trying to push him into the water. </br></br>  <br>It seems to buff his magic and also gives him special privileges over the guild's various NPCs and whatnot. Hence why he was able to modify Albedo's code despite not being her "owner".</br>  For some reason, the animation stutters a little. Is it just me or is this for everyone too?  <br>Yes, getting really close. Just need to wait an episode or so to get a high quality of Cocytus.</br>  <br>Well I'm coffin dead tired so I don't really mince the words anymore in this state. But yeah, sorry for that sounding like broken tape recorder.<br><br>We'll try our best as usual, but meat bag instead of undead hampers with that. But 5th, 6th and also 7th are being worked on, at their own paces.</br></br></br>  <br>Funimation.</br>  <br>Did for me too. I'm thinking it's the encode.</br>  <br>Shitty stream rip, what do you expect? And I don't think anyone is bothering to do fansubs for it so we're stuck with it.</br>  <br>You can grab the .ass from above and use a raw .mp4. But I wouldn't count it being every weekly and on time.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Man, it's making this not as enjoyable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>already changed it on </br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>If you don't mind downloading the raw, this guy  extracted the subs from Funi. Juts put the two files together and it should be fine.</br>  <br>I can't speak for anyone else but I'm not trying to rush anybody, just pointing out that those who are working on the 5th and 6th don't even have a site where everyone can show their support you know? Well I only know the 7th posts on BT so that's not much different I guess. Do we just cheer you guys on Sky's chatbox?<br><br>Personally I don't really care about the speed, progress is steady and the translations are solid. I know enough google fu to get by any Chinese terms that come in here and there as well.</br></br></br>  So just watched the episode<br><br> Pandora's Actor not in the OP group shot <br><br>At least Brain will appear</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaezar had had a site though</br>  Reminder that Ainz thinksthat nazi uniformsare cool<br> Best MC </br>  <br>If they're doing the volume three fight, we'll see PA.</br>  <br>He's not wrong.</br>  <br>Well which one is it? Am I right in suspecting it's the Mushoku Tensei one? I don't see anything on Sky's blog list or links page referring to Kaezar so forgive me for being ignorant this time.</br>  <br>Well, they are pretty BOSS</br>  <br>Just sparing a warm thought to another meat bags' efforts is enough, even unvoiced. But you can see people gathering on Sky's site, here on /a/, Kaezar's site, heck even AS.<br><br>It's not going to make us any faster but it's the thought that counts at the end of day. That there are people who like the effort.</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking Tibia man. Level 154 paladin from Secura reporting in. Also a few years ago /a/ had huge ragnarok threads for 3 months, it was so fun playing with two guilds full of guildmates from /a/ and going up that boss tower with cunt puncher leading us. Damn it was fun.</br>  <br>well i'm the one translating volume 5 so your support is noted.</br>  I don't understand, is it supposed to be this choppy? I had to stop. Maybe the BD's will be better.  I bet Albedo's hipwings twitch when she orgasms.  <br><br><br>Funi a shit. <br> You should read the thread to see if your question was answered next time. </br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just Funi. The TV raw looks better.</br>  <br>I who?</br>  <br><br><br>Thank you. I'll be more careful next time. I just ctrl+f'd chop to see if anyone else had the issue; I should have read the entire thread first.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him even but not everyone goes around with their names. You can just look at your on skeleton and praise it and believe in the future.</br>  That artstyle was harder on the eyes than I expected it to be.  This is not okay.   yfw evil always finds a way   <br>Why are things that cover the neck so attractive.<br><br>Is there even a name for such a fetish?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah isn't she supposed to be a slut?</br>  I would have given anything to have been logged in with ainz at that time and be in the guild.<br><br>Imagine that. Two best friends conquering the world with a guild of impossibly strong NPCs.</br></br>  <br> Nazi uniforms were created by fashion designers (Hugo Boss) <br> Nazi uniforms aren't going to be fab as fuck </br></br>  <br>I wasn't able to mux the subs with the video. <br><br>Guess I'll just stick to funishit. Already read the novels they're adapting anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>When japan says bitch they actually mean slut.</br>  Does the MC actually stay a skeleton? Thats pretty awesome if he does.  <br>But Bitch was an actual bitch in Shieldbro. Though she was also a slut, she was mainly a bitch.</br>  The threads have had a pretty goon run today, haven't they? We maxed out threads with minimal shitposting and interest in the story? Is it only primary source fags filling up the threads?  <br>No he turns into Dark Knight when the bat signal pops up every weekend.</br>  <br><br><br><br>He's so misunderstood <br>he just wants to socialize <br> but I don't think he should </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>MC is a lich, and stays a lich, so no problems there my friend.<br><br>Though he does dress up in armor while trying to gather info.</br></br></br>  <br> If Ainz wasn't alone he would never have changed Albedos settings/ <br>Both you and Ainz would be killed in your sleep.</br></br>  <br>Yes. He cosplays as Momon sometimes though.</br>  <br>The word ビッチ is taken from the English word bitch, but it means slut in Japanese. <br><br>Funi employs some really amateur translators apparently. Even doujin scanlators know that.</br></br></br>  <br>Thankfully I think the monster girl shit is soaking up all the shitposting for today. I'm sure we'll get a lot more people calling this a shitty SAO rip-off soon.</br>   Hearing Ainz's question, Lukeluther's shot up strongly: <br> After confirming no one other than him had any queries, Lukeluther asked Narberal in a clear voice: <br> "Please tell me what’s the relationship between you two!" <br><br> The place turned silent. <br> Ainz didn't know the intent behind this question, while Peter's team knew exactly what Lukeluther was after. <br> "...We are companions." <br> After Ainz answered, Lukeluther's next question caused an uproar. <br> "I have fallen for you! It's love at first sight! Please go out with me!" <br><br> Everyone looked at Lukeluther, knowing he wasn’t trying to deepen their relationship with a joke. Ainz shifted his gaze onto Narberal, who was now the focus of attention, as she took a deep breath and said: <br> “Shut up, you lower life form (slug). Learn your place, or do you want me to rip out your tongue the next time you open your mouth?” <br> The silence became even deeper. <br><br> “Ah, no…” <br> Ainz wants to soften the mood, but Lukeluther spoke first: “Thank you for your firm rejection! Let us start as friends!” <br> “Die, lower life form. How can I be friends with you (maggot)? Want me to scoop out your eyes with a spoon?” <br><br>Ice cold beauty Narberal</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>compared to his other stats<br><br>level 100 squishy wizard can still bitchslap a level 10 warrior in physical combat.</br></br></br>  <br>All of them already got scared off by the 500 post thread a day or two ago comparing this to SAO.</br>  <br> Implying I'm not the strongest </br>  <br>It doesn't help that most people in this world are massive dicks and those who aren't lack mental fortitude.<br><br>Well, except Gazef. But somehow he managed to let the impossible happen.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. You've obviously not gone to sadpanda threads or look at many manga or doujinshi. The majority translate it as bitch, including prolific translators, and there is a very argumentative thread about it on the e-hentai forums. You really are too optimistic about competence.</br>  Hope they don't keep his old internal voice around.  downloading, was it any good?  The screenshot with Ainz and the flag and the denizens of Nazarick looks like it was done by So-bin.  <br> Implying being a bitch doesn't mean she'd fuck us both in our sleep. </br>  <br>But if she was a bitch that'd just mean she'd be loyal but snappy.</br>  <br>Narberal's best girl. And my waifu. Don't touch.</br>  <br>You'd be fucked, alright.</br>  <br> porn competency is in danger <br><br>Say it ain't so. Anime is one thing, but porn?</br></br></br>  <br>Nigga you didn't hear about Gazef?</br>  <br> Loyal </br>  <br>Most doujins I read these days are in Japanese so maybe. I only bother with English versions if they're done by actually good translators.</br>  <br>I wonder how the voice actor will speak out the lines with quotations. It was the one thing I was truly curious about that volume.</br>  <br>I did, that's exactly why I said he managed to let the impossible happen. Think about it. All 3 of the men in power had no business wanting that shit to go down. And they let it happen somehow.<br><br>I'm really looking forward to seeing how the author manages to write that part out. Cause if I were in Gazef's position I'd risk turning traitor to save the Kingdom.</br></br></br>  <br>in what volume she says she hates the supreme beings?</br>  <br>But let's say she does go and try to kill me and Ainz if I were to be apart of the guild.<br>She'd be defeated, she isn't even the strongest npc they have.</br></br>  <br>6 or 7 if I remember correctly.<br>It's not flat out stated, but it drops more hints than America dropped nukes.</br></br>  So is anyone going to upload the mux'd file without the shitty funi font?  <br><br>I don't suppose we will see vol 5 release in one go right? ;_;</br></br>  <br>So three hints</br>   I want to ??? Albedo   <br>So you in three months Anon.</br>  <br>She also tried to kill Pandora's actor when she first saw him when he was transformed as one of the supreme beings.</br>  You know guys, if you hate Funi so much, why dont you just download it and watch it at home?

A lot of side and background characters just get the worst performances. For a series like LoGH, it's a killer. For MM, it won't be so bad, but I don't look forward to what they'll do to Polt or the Orcs. For main characters, they just recycle the same stable of VAs through all their series, and they all give the same performance every single time.<br><br>Their translations are also fairly inconsistent from episode to episode because they freelance the translations out to the lowest bidder. Just about the only thing that is consistent is the degree of non-localization they do, which is a little better than Funi's localize everything mentality.<br><br>But Funi would have better VAs and better extras.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Caring about dubs </br>  <br> Are you new to this <br> OP is a fucking retarded secondary who doesn't even read the manga <br> Posting like a retard <br><br><br>Since OP is a shitty bait for animeonlyfags this thread is already fucked up, that's why people still reporting this shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this fag just made a third thread in his quest to be the only monster girl OP<br><br>we have a honest to god full fledge autistic manbaby on the internet calling people "secondaries" because im moving in on his monster girl thread monopoly <br><br>you cant make this shit up</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're still here from the Jitsu threads, huh?</br>  <br>What do you think I listen to on my  Microsoft Zune  at work?

Do it now.</br></br></br>  <br>my folder is so fucking huge finding the appropriate reaction image is difficult <br><br>im sorry</br></br></br>  <br>nobody complained about emoticons at any point beyond the last 12 or so months. people who complain about emoticons are underaged little egomonsters who think they are the coolness police</br>  <br> nobody complained about emoticons at any point beyond the last 12 or so months. <br>considering we have an archive your attempts at revisionism are in vain.</br></br>  <br>my 4chan folder is subdivided into 435 semantic subfolders. many of the files themselves also have names.<br><br>and you could use hydrus.<br><br>amateur</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>we are dealing with one of the most autistic persons ever</br>  <br> hydrus  <br><br>wat</br></br></br>  <br><br>At this point you are just pretending to be retarded, right?<br><br>Also you should get yourself one of those shift-keys, they are pretty handy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>sure thing mate <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127738361  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127732513 </br>  <br>You need to stop projecting and stop posting, also try some lurking while you are at it.</br>  <br><br>here another good example from this thread <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127745156 </br></br>  My dick is diamonds.  How long do we have to wait until we've got a version with nipples?  <br>Sometime in september</br>  <br>somebody said tokyoMX is uncut</br>   that leg cross <br>Ms Smith, are you trying to seduce me?</br>  <br>Smith is proof that the human female will not go extinct when monster girls show up. Some regular girls are just that sexy.</br>  <br>Oh, give it about SIX GODDAMN MONTHS.</br>  <br><br>We kinda need them around anyway, or humans would go extinct. Since Lamias only give birth to Lamias, which are all female.</br></br>  <br>Funny that the only human female in the series is a lazy freeloading leech like most human females.</br>  So why didn't this scene at least have nipples to censor?  <br>she is competent-lazy though</br>  <br>maybe they're just out of frame? uncensoring by frame shifting isn't unheard of</br>  <br><br>Yeah she's like the police captain in Patlabor, when she gets serious, she's pretty good.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but damn does she look good doing it. And she is giving darling a lotta dosh. You think his average ass can afford all that food and a big house on a salaryman's wage and still have time to be there for the girls?<br><br>Hell no, he's getting some mad bux from somewhere else and Smith is probably the one who either filled out the paperwork to get it or showed him where to go to get said mad bux for minimal work.<br><br>Having shown her immense value, she gets a pass (and dat ass doesn't hurt either).</br></br></br></br></br>  You just know she's a demon in the sack.  <br> horsepussybux  <br><br>yes</br></br></br>    alright lads, how many episodes is this going to be?<br>12?</br>  So, when this mini episodes will start?  <br> screenshotting to crop an image </br>    dat animation <br>  dat voice acting <br>  dat lewd <br>  all these new fetishes I've just discovered <br><br>Animu of the Season.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I didn't have the chapter to hand so I used a web reader</br></br>  <br><br>I would think more considering Rachnee is in the op.</br></br>  <br>There are free tools to crop images from a page and save it. I've used it to make pics out of segments of youtube videos and various anime and manga chapters. It's a nice thing to have.</br>  <br>unless they skip a shitload of chapters.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=fUL<wbr>NUr0rvEc</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I want to wax that tail.</br></br></br>  <br>Or they do two chapters per episode like they seem to be doing.</br>  <br>some of us wanted to buy the licensed material to support crabman</br>  w h o c a r e s<br>h<br>o<br>c<br>a<br>r<br>e<br>s</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If that's the case there's nothing stopping you from turning on subtitles.</br></br>  <br>If your goal is to support him, then buy the Japanese BDs.</br>  http://ch.nicovideo.jp/monmusu<br>For those people who haven't seen it yet.</br>  <br>is anyone subbing these?</br>   Dat ending <br>Cute and fucking awesome. I liked it more than the Opening</br>    <br>First part is self-explanatory, second part is Miia counting sheep for you.</br>  <br> second part is Miia counting sheep for you. <br><br>That sounds lovely.</br></br></br>   mfw Isla is now a slut snake   <br>How the fuck did I not notice</br>  Paella, garlic bread, vichyssoise, beef hash with fried egg, and some clay pot soup.<br><br>Where the hell did they go that serves all of this?</br></br>   Buying physical western release <br><br>Thread should have been deleted already. Import your shit.</br></br>  <br>the fucking OP is stuck in my head and the only thing that will fix it is a 357</br>      <br>Surprised she didn't just eat a bunch of whole animals. Or beef tartare.</br>   Here is the sexiest creature in the world <br> Oh, you can't fuck it or we'll arrest you xD <br>Dropped<br>Only to pick up at episode 2</br></br></br>  <br>Balut</br>  <br>lol</br>  <br> heres a delicious snek <br> she wants to fuck <br> she's living with you <br> she can easily overpower you <br> if you fuck her, you goin' to jail </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>see you next week</br>  <br> But they're not going to dub it, are they? <br>It's Monster Fucking Musume. What do you think?<br><br>Also, the people who are saying Sentai will release this in a $400 box set don't know their NA companies and are confusing them with Aniplex. Sentai will release this in a two disc BD barebone set for $45.99 with one disc having 9 episodes and the other 3-4.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She is still Asshime to me</br></br>  <br>Could you save the part with Miia counting sheep? It's for future posterity. Audio only is fine.</br>  <br>I have it on my harddrive</br>  <br>Gross, they're getting slime all over the sheets!</br>  <br>Suu doesn't leave a slime trail unless she wants to.</br>  WOO  <br> SNAKE CLOACA </br>  <br>best cloaca</br>  <br>That's Aniplex, not Sentai. The only downside about Sentai releases is that they use yellow subs in the year 2015, and more often then not, there dubs suck.</br>  What if this show end up making monster girls mainstream.  So any source uncensored? MX? KBS? I heard ATX is censored.  It's over; archive is dead. Again.  Show is over people, everyone go home.  <br>Archive hater pls go.</br>  This makes absolutely no difference.  <br>Except those same people are still going to be on /a/</br>  who cares, live for the moment   ITT: Shirobako <br>I just finnished Shirobako, and it´s such a great work. I don´t have enough words to describe the magnificent development of the characters. <br>Also, Miyamori best girl</br></br>  <br>Prequel when?</br>  <br><br>Her name is on the card, come on anons</br></br>  <br>Boys can't be angels.</br>  <br>Because a lack of budget is usually not the problem. No budget is just an /a/ maymay.</br>  <br><br>And the giant robots ruined TTGL for me</br></br>  Why do we hate her again?  <br>Well for the first 15 minutes i was really enjoying my Lelouch/Kira MC parody but then the bitch on the OP had to come ruin the rest of the episode. Glasses guy was cool and chill</br>  <br>Yeah I really did not like her, I guess it pissed me off that I still don't get her motivation it was just "oh hey we are arresting you cuz"</br>  <br>It's not her motivation. Why can't you pay attention?</br>  <br>Eh...</br>  <br> People with this power may become dangerous <br> Proceeds to blow shit up to try and catch him causing more damage than the one traffic accident <br> Basically institutionalizes MC and sister <br> Makes mc lose possible relationship <br><br><br>I'm going to fucking hate her more if she makes the MC into some softy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  See this.<br>What do?</br>  <br>The real psychopath is here</br>    <br>Not him, but it'd probably be interesting to take it one step further and get a bunch of mosquitoes to bite her, then prevent her from scratching.</br>  Tell her I won't spread my legs for her  <br>Call the cops.</br>  Drawfag Thread 1532<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1509:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1531 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>Damn, they better not fuck up her rape faces, she already looks too girly in the anime considering what she's supposed to be.</br></br>  <br>more times than not.</br>  <br>Which anime is this girl from?</br>  <br>Every single time I try drawing.</br>  <br>thank you for drawing my request, it looks good<br><br>nobody asked your opinion<br><br>gate</br></br></br></br></br>  So we're finally getting the movie right?
