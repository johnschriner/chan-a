The point is that they just shrugged it off. with that pitiful showing being all that the gods were known for before, it's no surprise when their next showing is also pitiful.</br>    <br><br> Flare will never tease your dick by gently burning it with her hair <br><br>Why live</br></br></br></br>  The random color guessing continues  I wish I had a Miia. The tongue makes her the best girl.  <br>But I've seen webms of her shedding so they did do it, if they do skip it it will be in the home releases.</br>  <br>ARIGATOU CRABMAN!!</br>  <br><br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s1M9mjDK6F7o<br><br>Sorry.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I still hold out hope it's been shuffled seeing as its a non plot driving part, it's not uncommon, like Shingeki no Kyojin which is all plot and no fun even there they shuffled some chapters and plot points around in the anime from the manga.</br>  <br>You know, manga Papi never did much for me but anime Papi is fucking adorable.</br>  Does this guy get evil now that he's a lich? He's not going to be running around saving people, r-right? <br><br>Because that's not what I'm signing up for.</br></br>  <br>Aren't all the other guilds members also considerably more powerful than her?<br><br>Aren't a couple also much stronger than Momon?</br></br></br>  <br>Hey now, this season is great for /tg/ anime.</br>  <br>i need a madara pasta version Of papa Bones to compare</br>  <br>Sauron was a dog at the time too, so it's all right.</br>  <br>It's even more retarded considering an actual Log Horizon fan would know that Overlord's author played and contributed his character to mamare's LH TRPG.</br>  If you could choose your own stand what would it be?  <br>Za Warudo or Emperor - both those are baller as fuck</br>  <br>Isn't Emperor essentially just a gun.</br>  <br> Improves user's reflexes and reactions <br> stealth weapon, can summon whenever <br> HOMING.

She kept my trembling legs moving, supported my heart as the pressure bore down on it, and kept me in a position to make jokes. With Index, things may have been too focused on magic. With Othinus, it would have been exclusively about Magic Gods and having a clear understanding of their strength might have crushed me with despair. It was because it was Misaka. I survived this long because she was the one by my side. She saved my life and you want me to tell her to back off because she’s in the way? Who the hell do you think you are!? You don’t understand the first thing about the human emotion of this human world, but you’re trying to act like some all-knowing god!!!!!!”  <br><br> “So take it back, you piece of shit Magic God!! If you badmouth the person who saved my life any more, I’ll go punch you just like you want!!”  <br><br> “I don’t care if you’re covered in magma or if you’re over one thousand degrees! Imagine Breaker? I don’t need that for you and I don’t care if it doesn’t work on you! I don’t care if my fist melts away or if my entire body bursts into flames. Yeah, if you don’t shut that filthy mouth of yours right this instant, I’ll keep punching you until you finally do!!!!!!”  <br><br>Based Touma.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> You will NEVER EVER see WW3 or Othinus arc <br><br>Woe is me.</br></br></br></br>    <br>That sounds like forced logic with little basis. And your English is shit, so I'm less inclined to give a shit about what you're saying.<br>Nephthys' power was from the beginning split up, which how she was able to overall retain more power than the other Magic Gods. But not only did she use the extra stored energy, she had most of her split selves destroyed by Anti-Touma, making there far less places for her to store her power in the first place.</br></br>  <br>iirc there is laura mentioning a new piece being on the board at the end of NT12 but that doesn't allude to any of his bullshit.</br>  <br>He was kind of hinted at the end of NT12 by Laura, but I think that's it.</br>  I just can't stop watching this.<br> https://gifsound.com/?gif=i.4cdn.or<wbr>g/a/1437501639903.gif&amp;v=qhqnvaq6BwA<wbr>&amp;s=13</wbr></wbr> <br>Also<br>https://kyakka.wordpress.com/2015/0<wbr>7/08/yahari-light-novel-volume-11-c<wbr>hapter-2/ <br> Never </br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  I need a shitpost autohide script.

But Mineta is way to high</br>  <br>Where's your sense of adventure?</br>  I know I'm late, but I just got to this scene and just wanted to show to those concerned that the best friend WINS! Its only a matter of time now before babies are made.<br><br>Also, any other genderbender/trap manga I can sink my teeth into? Boku girl will probably end soon and take its rightful place with Prunus Girl for God Tier Trap mangas.</br></br>  Also, who is cuter, Aikawa or Mizuki?    I just read all of this manga last night and it sucks waiting for more. How often does it update?  <br>Hard question.<br>Aikawa though since boku girl had to cheat and turn into an actual girl while OLEV did it as a guy</br></br>  <br>Was Mizuki supposed to be drunk in this scene? It came out of nowhere and felt really out of place. The whole sequence in Takeru's room.</br>  This watered down, censored butchering, is why the anime industry sucks so bad now days.<br><br>I can deal with 95% of the new animes every season consisting of moe/ecci/shounen/mild shounen-ai pandering for female otakus, usually devoid of any depth whatsoever. That is, if they didn't fucking tone down and censor the rest of the 5% that actually has some sort of interesting premise. Hell, why not turn the MC and his soldiers into fucking high-schoolers while you're at it... If you moeify, censor and remove any adult &amp; mature themes, you might as well adapt another fucking Light/Visual novel aimed at beta faggots. There are thousands of those out there, go make animes out of those instead of showing us this butchered crap.<br><br>Remove the gore, violence any sort, nudity or any sort of mature themes, and the series suddenly looses any appeal it had from the start. What's Berserk, Gungrave or say Black Lagoon without it's graphic violence and devoid of any mature and explicit content whatsoever? Fucking boring and pointless! Might as well watch swordshit moe online instead, because the difference is suddenly minimal.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>reminder that it is this easy to bait /a/ in 2015<br><br>i want reddit to go</br></br></br>  <br><br>Fuck no. You can pen them with arrows. Scutum was not very durable.</br></br>  FUCK MOESHIT  <br>I find it funny how /a/'s double standards. <br>Einz/Momonga gets just as much dick riding as SASUGA ONIISAMA yet /a/'s reaction is complete opposite between the two. <br><br>And this is coming from a novelfag who has read 7 volumes of Overlord. <br>The constant "Einz-sama is so wonderful" shit got really old and tiring.</br></br></br></br></br>  No thread up?
