They will be addressed in the following 3 episodes, just wait for it. Don't think the author forgot about the feelings of the main character love interest, they were just be addessed later.    what the fuck how many episodes of this shit are there gonna be, i was thinking this was gonna be the last one. i don't want to have to continue watching this trash.    16 and then another 16 when they announce S2.    16    i thought he loved haruhi and i thought haruhi liked him???   What makes the romance between Shirou and Rin so much more compelling than the other two?   YES1   Reminder that Saber is twice Shirou's age and that she goes much better together with Archer either way.      And they would have pure sex.     Shirou isn't 8 though.   Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #2  Remember to keep relaxing and take it easy. <br/>      nice meme   Requesting Oora dosed off, preferably at a desk or a keyboard but maybe she can be happily dosed off in a more public place without a care in the world~    Bonus points for cute lewd, cute lewd a best~     Requesting anything cute of Honoka.  For specifics, request Honoka drinking a hot beverage in winter clothing.  Have a great weekend.      Can someone draw Suiseiseki as a tacticool operator with an m16?  <br/>  There are people who like David Production's anime. There's are people who think time stop isn't stronger than King Crimson or Gold Experience Reqiem. There are still people who don't think Heaven's Door isn't the most broken stand. There are people who still skip parts or don't read in order.  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87   New JoJolion translated today/tomorrow.           He didn't, you're misinterpreting Ice's line. He meant that Polnareff couldn't have inflicted those wounds on him if it hadn't been for Avdol.   Remember when Josuke went Super Saiyan What's up with that    Cause it means its not Fujo-doujin     Johnny... johnny! Up here...     Remember when Johnny got Shoot and in the next chapter he was healthy like everyday What's up with that    Who is your favorite loli?   I wish I could suck on such a cute girl's ballz.      What, you would suck on a loli's ballz? Fucking faglord go be ghey somewhere else.     Don't we all?    source? no matches   I keep hearing anons use this term, although I feel a lot of them have different ideas of what it means.  I'd assume it's when a show has a dramatic event occur when it probably shouldn't, possibly because it doesn't feel natural for the characters to act this way under that circumstance.  If so, can someone point to examples in shows like Clannad and White Album 2, where the drama feels "forced"?       I forgot to mention that autistic people can't into drama.    I could honestly see it taking that long if you don't use a guide and go for every route and ending     "Key AIDS"? Ahh...   Ahh...   ...  Get out you retard.        and go for every route and ending  That is the prime directive of playing VNs.     Underrated post   How good is Kimi ga Nozomu Eien?   Appearently called Rumbling Hearts for the official English release.     But he wasn't. He was guilt ridden to four different directions. He still had a standing PTSD due to the accident, the current situation with Haruka and whatever delusions he had with it, his guilt towards treating Hayase like shit and ignoring her pleads to notice her shattering mental health. Then you have Haruka's dad coming back and requesting him to help Haruka to get better, and then Akane just drops the fucking bomb about her own feelings, after which she just gets sick and Takayuki has to take care of her. Oh wait, that didn't happen in the series. Everything around him just shatters, and he can't literally move on for three years. Then when he is finally making some progress, shit just goes wrong. Too much responsibility is stacked on him to the point he can't even handle his own emotions and acts on how things were, not how things are and that's why he can't be true to himself until, once again, it is forced on him. Only when shit hits the fan he manages to drop the responsibilities that are not his to deal with.  And nigger, I'll fight you about the end. After all, it all ends in  Haruka marrying some with Murakami as his last name and realizes her dream as a children's book author, Akane becomes the school swimming team captain, Homura doesn't peg sex-changed Takayuki all night, and Hayase and Takayuki live as a proper family and they all get together after some time to meet again as friends  on that hill.      But White Album 2 does the whole flawed characters thing a lot better.     And nothing of value was lost.    I just think it's funny how he was the one to get fucked for a change. I like to think it made life for Mitsuki and Haruka better.   The ponytail strikes back   REMOVE fluffy    Not just supposedly skilled, but apparently the third most skilled person in the band, better than even Reina and just below Asuka and Oboe-chan.    I will never, ever see Aoi on screen again.  She had so little screen time in the first place. Why are you tormenting me KyoAni?    Yet, a useless retard.    Oboe-chan is that good?   I'm gonna die tomorrow!    I really don't care. She's a boring character anyway.    learn to: avoid limb damage  Everytime    Guys I think I'm finally starting to like this show but there's only one episode left. Why couldn't they do shit like this instead of force drama for the first few episodes.  I really don't care. She's a boring character anyway.  If Herakles could be summoned before he went full god, doesn't that mean Jesus could be summoned during his human phase?    To save Peter who was drowning wise guy.   You don't need to walk on water to save a drowning man. Swimming works just fine. so either he did that miracle to show off or because he was too lazy to swim, but it wasn't for any selfless reason.       &gt;God can do anything otherwise he's not God.  not really, God doesnt have to be able to everything, he can just be very powerful. God being omnipotent is just a medieval invention.      jesus goes to pray   his niggas on the boat went away because wind   He walks on water to get to them   They think he's a ghost about to spook them up   He be like "Chillax my african americans, it's me your mainest nigga"   Pete be like "If you mah mainest nigga tell me to come to you on the water"   Jesus be like "Come bruh"   Pete starts to walk on water but gets spooked the fuck out and starts to sink yelling like a bitch "PLEASE SAVE A HOMIE!   Jesus walks to him and helps him out and be like "nigga hav sum faith, why ya doubt the mainest nigga?"   Then he climbed to the boat and the wind was like "ain't havin none of dat sheit" and fucked off back to Oklahoma   all of jesus hommies be like "You dah mainest nigga bruh"                &gt;be a cute girl that wants the divine dick  I can see she falling in love for him, but he is already married.    Let me see if I have this straight.  Some guy is trying to argue that the circumstances described in the Bible about Jesus' crucifixion suggest that he can't perform miracles therefore he's not the son of god.  But by taking the bible as a factual source he's admitting that events happened in the bible are exactly as described.  Therefore things like Jesus resurrecting, performing miracles, etc are all true. So he's the son of god.  What are you arguing about again?          Sento that is all    what is wrong with you nice digits btw      Sento as Salama  Oh gosh     I don't remember blood sport in Amagi Park except for the pirate show, but this is fucking amazing.       threads on /a/ are full of lowest common denominator retards who can only post about how much they want to fuck the girls  Man what a fucking shock   most anons don't bother discussing shows with fanservice because philistines will just call them shiteaters trying to justify their waifubait or something equally illogical.      You told me this was shit, it isn't. Why do you always lie to me, /a/?     i remember there were people actually defending this shit and saying it was good       They're a bunch of low level monsters that are just trying to bite or smash them and win through sheer numbers.  This is literally why it's a boring fight scene. All these monsters can do it just lurch forward and get socked right in the face. That's not interesting.    It's shit and KyoAni's worst show.  /thread     And now you've successfully talked in a circle and gotten back to "Well every fight should be more like a one on one exchange of blows" and you've managed to not even pretend to talk about character animation and positioning anymore.    I have not said any of that. Literally quote me when I said "fights should be one on one only." You can't because I never did. If you honestly believe that all multiple enemies can do is just lurch forward randomly then you need to watch some more fucking action anime. </blockquote>]
