[ Sequel movie when?  First for best girl   implying Free isn't over   <br>Sourin love story, when?</br>  <br>Best girl calls for best boy.</br>  <br>When Kyoani needs more fujobucks.</br>  <br>Sousuke an indecisive dick and Rin a whipped spineless faggot so never.</br>  <br>Already married at such a young age.</br>  <br>Even though Sourin is popular, it's nothing compared to Makoharu, so as long as Kyoanus keeps the latter fujos happy, Sousuke can end up a neet and Rin raped by drop bears and they wouldn't care ;_;</br>  This anime made me gay as fuck, I now jerk off to Rin getting fucked.  <br> Sousuke an indecisive dick and Rin a whipped spineless faggot <br>Truly the perfect romance.</br></br>  <br>Rinrin craved that dick because he reminded her of her daddy but Sousuke was a faggot unable to show his love ;_;</br>  <br> I now jerk off to Rin getting fucked. <br>I don't understand which part of that is supposed to be gay.</br></br>  <br>Good. You're not the first one.</br>  <br>Wow, he explains it all pretty well.</br>  <br>Baby don't hurt me.</br>  i want to get fucked by rin  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127315792 <br>Hitler, pls.</br>  <br>Look who found her way here.</br>  <br>It's not gay if it's Rinrin<br><br><br>If only Rinrin had given him some more space, he would have crawled back to her eventually.</br></br></br></br>  <br>3deep5me, call Dr Freud.</br>  We need to come up with something new to talk about, it's always the same topics.  I want to be lifted in the air by Makoto.  <br>Poor Sousuke. Played the hard to get faggot, lost his waifu for 4 years.</br>  <br>We could talk about Makoto and Rin's relationship.</br>  <br>Sousuke is just too aloof. <br><br>No lost since they kept in contact and he though is wasn't his place to say anything.</br></br></br>  Would Rin's teeth hurt your dick?  <br>At least they reunited and he got to pop Rinrin's boycherry at last.</br>  <br>*it wasn't</br>  <br>Truly the most canon ship of them all.</br>  <br>What are lips wrapping. If you feel teeth, there is obviously something wrong going on. Unless that's your fetish.</br>  <br>Sousuke's seems to be doing fine as far as I'm concerned.</br>  <br>me_and_my_bitch.jpg</br>  <br>Not if your dick is strong enough.</br>  <br><br>Heh</br></br>  <br><br>Nice hivemind</br></br>  <br>When Utsumi reveals her secret project.</br>  <br>I'd sell off my sister for a triple date movie. Or even just a double one.</br>  <br> inb4 it's a Strayan movie and only Iwatobi makes it there, while Sousuke got lost and isn't seen until the last minute when they come back with a message from Rin 'I'll be waiting for you' <br>;_;</br></br>  He's home.  <br>They've paved the way with the Aussie credit card art, I'm afraid it's happening.</br>  <br> I'd sell off my sister <br>That's not very nice, anon. I would like to see that too though. Or even some doujins, once a long time ago I saw a preview for a 6P triple date doujin on pixiv but it never got scanned.</br></br>  <br>And they spend the entire movie wearing these shitty outfits.</br>  <br>Sorry, wrong quote.<br/></br>  <br>That's cute, Anon. I'm sure he'll be smiling and laughing while doing so.</br>  <br>That shit made me so mad. You don't spend an entire fucking season bringing in a new character, developing him and his storyline, just to toss him aside and try and go back to post S1 5P shit because you realized you didn't put any in S2. That's too late m8, some people lost interest in autist faggot MC and came to care for best boy and his shoulder.</br>  <br>I'm thankful for Makoto's legs, but they really went full retard with that promo. The stories were painful to read.</br>  <br>I agree that it would be nice to have more Sousuke but it's just a shitty credit card advertisement. Plus wasn't it made before the OVA, so before Sousuke became friends with the Iwatobis?</br>  <br>You could say they're half way there.</br>  Did you make the thread because you can't post images at ghost? There's literally nothing new to discuss about the series.  <br>Don't forget this one.</br>  <br>I was also talking about ep13 and the sakura pool scene, hence the pic I posted. The 'they weren't friends yet' argument, is retarded, since OVA shows Rin just had to introduce him to them and they'd get along fine. That's why I don't see why he couldn't be there in that scene, and it just felt to me as some lazy fanservice for 5P.</br>  Fuck sousuke, rin should be with makoto  Marry, Fuck, Kill.  <br>Is that a Big Time Rush joke? Cause they had a some called Half Way There. Literally. I used to watch the show, but got bored of it. I forgot how many seasons there was, I guess It ended.<br><br><br>What's ghost? I'm not OP, I just wanted to know.<br><br><br>Agreed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you can't post images at ghost <br>You can, though. And I don't know what the OP's reason for making this thread was but it's not like you're only allowed to make threads when there is something new to discuss. K-On threads, for example, wouldn't be allowed exist if that were the case.</br></br>  <br>Marry rin, fuck makoto, kill sousuke</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127315792 <br>By whom? 70 year olds and basement neckbeards?</br>  <br> The 'they weren't friends yet' argument, is retarded, since OVA shows Rin just had to introduce him to them <br>Since he introduced him in the OVA and this was before the OVA, they weren't friends yet.<br>The other anon never said they couldn't be friends. They just weren't because they never had the chance to actually interact.</br></br></br>  <br><br>ebin</br></br>  <br>Makoto is already married to someone else.</br>  <br>Marry Rin<br>Fuck Rin<br>Kill Haru<br> I'm pic related </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I like that you're trying something new for once.</br></br>  <br> These rolled-up pants <br> That anket <br> That chain <br>Someone needs to step in.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Most likely the bank payed for S1 characters because it was cheaper than paying for S2 characters.<br>It was some shitty credit card advertisement. Don't take it serious.</br></br>  <br>The last one won't happen since they're friends now.</br>  <br>Rinrin's gay anklet is him desperately calling for big cocks to fill his desperate boypussy.</br>  <br> wanting to take away Rin's faggy anklets <br>Too cruel.</br></br>  <br> friends <br>That's stretching it, let's just say hey tolerate each other.</br></br>  <br>The clothes are fine. I'd have thought you'd people would have a eye for Japanese male fashion by now.</br>  <br>Friends as long as the mackerel autist remains far from his waifu.</br>  <br> using memes <br><br>Nice bait. Seriously though, what the fuck is ghost? Is that a section of 4chan I haven't heard about?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't really like the bright colors too much, but they fit the happy and colorful ambiance of the picture.</br>  <br>Haru already offered his friendship and called Sousuke by his first name. Sousuke accepted his friendship when he called Haru by his first name back.</br>   Haru calls Rin a douchebag in the dub   <br>He doesn't need to resort to such tricks now that he's got a fat alpha dick all to himself.</br>  <br> That's why I don't see why he couldn't be there in that scene, and it just felt to me as some lazy fanservice for 5P. <br>Well, considering there wasn't much actual 5P interaction in S2 it makes sense they would give them something in the last episode. Plus it was a call back to the first episode of S2 where the Iwatobis tried to make a sakura pool for Rin but it started raining.<br><br><br> It was some shitty credit card advertisement. Don't take it serious. <br>Yeah, this. No need to get mad when we got plenty of Sousuke-Iwatobi interaction in the OVA. This should be a bigger indicator than some advertisement.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> dub <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/</br></br>  <br>Yeah friends. Not the best of friends but on good enough terms to call each other by their first names.</br>  <br>Sure, they are not best friends forever sharing a toothbrush. But first name calling is not just "tolerating" in Japan's name calling system.</br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br> Well, considering there wasn't much actual 5P interaction in S2 it makes sense they would give them something in the last episode <br>What really bothered me most about this scene is that they didn't even include Sousuke when all of Samezuka joined in. Why?</br></br>    So when will Sousuke and Rin get married?  <br>This. It was really weird having Samezuka join Rin in preparing his little welcoming party but conveniently have Sousuke away.</br>  <br>They're already married. Rin does the thing she does with her daddy with her chosen one.</br>  <br><br>Those colors are eye-bleedingly horrible. I can't stare at it for more than I second with out it hurting my eyes.<br><br>Clothes are fine. Color choice is horrible. The person who drew this has the fashion sense of a mackerel, no pun intended.</br></br></br></br>  <br>When Sousukes gets Rin preggo and coaxes her into tying the knot.</br>  <br>They already are married with 2 kids.</br>  <br> all of Samezuka joined in <br>The focus wasn't on Samezuka though. You couldn't see Ai and Momo joining in but you can assume they were there, just like Sousuke. The point of the scene was to show 5P finally getting to swim in their sakura pool so obviously the focus was on them. I'm a Sousukefag but I didn't mind that at all. Now, Sousuke's lack of resolution and I'll be waiting for you.jpg is a different matter.</br></br>  <br>When they move to Murrica in the movie.</br>  Has that shota movie been subbed yet?  <br>Oh yeah, I forgot the Aussies still don't have gay marriage.</br>  <br>Yeah, it's up on tumblr.</br>  <br><br><br>Pretty much . Not showing any Samezuka would look like Rin just did whatever the hell he wanted with the pool, but showing too much Samezuka would lose the focus on Rin (specifically) returning the favor to Iwatobi. So they just showed a few random guys here and there.</br></br></br>  I thought was Yokotani a Sousukefag. Why just a bad end?<br><br>Also, I'm a little worried that Utsumi is apparently not directing the HS movie?</br></br>  <br> I thought was Yokotani a Sousukefag. Why just a bad end? <br>He's a &gt;muh drama faggot<br><br> Also, I'm a little worried that Utsumi is apparently not directing the HS movie? <br>Why? It's the best thing that could have happened to this franchise.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But I thought tumblr hated shota.</br>  <br>It's not even out yet.</br>  <br>What makes you think he wanted that ending? From the interview he seem upset enough to be nervous about it so he knows it's shit.</br>  <br> "We need more drama" - Yokotani Masahiro </br>  Sousuke<br> failed Chad <br><br>Rin<br> Stacy <br><br>Haru<br> autist <br><br>Makoto<br> failed normie <br><br>Rei<br> beta <br><br>Nagisa<br> decent person </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I still can't believe he belittled Sousuke to his forced drama in an interview. What the fuck.</br>  <br> Why? It's the best thing that could have happened to this franchise. <br><br>I just don't want it to lose the feeling/charm of the TV series. Not that I don't believe in Takemoto, he's one of Kyoani's best, but you know how things can change when staff change.</br></br></br>  <br>Remember he likes MakoHaru but originally wanted them to have a separation ending. That man just loves drama.</br>  <br>Gomen.</br>  <br>All I know is that it can't get worse.</br>  <br>Who is this and why does he look so sadistic?</br>  <br><br><br> This fucking asshurt over a question on an image board </br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>kek<br>not_this_shit_again.jpg</br></br>  <br>What is this, an autist for ants?</br>  <br> Also, I'm a little worried that Utsumi is apparently not directing the HS movie? <br>I'm glad they chose a different director. Utsumi was good for Free, but High Speed is not nearly as comical so the drama has to be properly executed.</br></br>  Big-breasted onee-sans = flat-chested imoutos &gt; slutty aunts &gt; unreasonably attractive mothers &gt;&gt;&gt; cousins &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; big-breasted imoutos = flat-chested onee-sans.<br><br>Prove me wrong.</br></br>  <br>Everything &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NBR<br>That's my only change, besides underrating flat onee-sans.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127307302 <br>Something by Bosshi.

You were raised by your grandparents, and never met your parents.<br>As you are on your way to middleschool, your eyes meet that of the most beautiful woman you've ever seen. She's far older than you, but never having known you mother, maybe you long for that type of motherly women.

Zero's batcave brawl or UBW's temple showdown?<br><br><br> Shirou vs Gilgamesh <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=F_5<wbr>Q0QDaH5w</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Kirei vs Kerry <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=NSg<wbr>XOZKSt20</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm gonna say Zero, because even with all the magic time-stop and sword out of nowhere, it still felt a bit more grounded and intense. <br><br>Also, I didn't know the ending to Zero prior to watching it, so I guess it had more impact.</br></br></br>  I don't find the sword spam entertaining.  <br>In which fight? Both had it.</br>  <br>I'm sure you thought that was clever.</br>  <br>Shirou vs Gilgamesh. The only reason why /a/ doesn't like it was because they think too logically about the power levels.</br>  <br>No, I just through you were being unclear.</br>  <br>Do you think the degree of "sword spam" is equal in both scenes?</br>  <br>I'm going with Archer vs Shirou. I don't mind the changes from the VN.</br>  <br> magic time-stop <br>Are you stupid?</br></br>  <br>Shirou vs Gilgamesh was pretty much perfect.</br>  <br>Shirou vs Gilgamesh.<br><br>Swordspam fight is better than bulletspam fight.</br></br></br>  <br> Also, I didn't know the ending to Zero prior to watching it, so I guess it had more impact. <br>Secondary so fucking detected</br></br>  <br><br><br>lel, shiroufags are shit</br></br></br>  <br>Not in the anime</br>  <br>Shirou vs Gilgamesh, how is this even a question?

It was uninterrupted by dialogue, the combatants were evenly matched, tacticool, and as another anon said, it felt "grounded."

In Zero fight they were more inturrupted by dialogue and infodump, they even cut the fight like 5 times to focus on Saber and Berserker.<br>Also, both fights were about the same in tactical terms, the difference is that in UBW they mostly showed it.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean they didn't chat like faggots.</br>  <br>Zero's LN climax.</br>  <br>Kirei vs. Kerry.

There's non continuity, it's a cool concept that was squandered as time filler while Saber hogged the attention again.</br>  <br>Command seals are neato and everything, but it's pretty sad that Kiritsugu was making full use of an EX-rank noble phantasm and still could only fight Kirei to a draw.</br>  <br> implying there's anything wrong with focusing on Seiba </br>  Did I miss some kind of scene that setup the batcave?<br><br>All I remember was them getting prepped to finish this bullshit then they just magically showed up at the batcave, which was under where the grail was, I guess.</br></br>  Fuck Shirou and Kerry, Kirei should have been the protagonist  <br>Well he can't actually use its noble phantasm ability of teleporting to fairyland, which is the EX part.

It's really a shame they didn't have her handle UBWs ost as well, because it was underwhelming.</br></br>  <br>Yes, that's why Shirou has Avalon now, the fairies got pissed at Saber for getting fairyland destroyed and gave it to Shirou instead.<br><br>That's why he kills Gil, for revenge for the fairies.<br><br>You have to really read behind the lines to see this though, it's all very subtle japanese symbolism.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Zero was less visually impressive, but had more meaning and better choreography.<br><br>UBW was a blast to watch, but came off as generic shounen fighting with pewpewpew and Shirou turning servant level.</br></br></br>  <br>The OST in the last three episodes was great.</br>  <br>Kerry is a fairy?</br>  <br>Zero and UBW had a different approach with their fighting scene since the beginning. It's just a matter of taste, "grounded" or over-the-top. Both are great though.<br><br><br> Archer vs Shirou <br>Did they even fight? I can only remember they were chit chatting so much it feels like i'm reading the VN all over again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, all the signs were there.</br>  <br>Fairytsugu</br>  <br>They did fight, but it was very briefly. The overall symbolism behind the entire thing was great, but aside from Shirou's charge up the hill it was plagued with poor animation quality and terrible choreography.</br>  <br>Hey</br>  <br> Did they even fight? <br>Yes, with terrible animation.</br></br>  <br>Alright, now post the ufotable one</br>  <br>in the original sources ubw is better. but that doesnt matter to people here</br>  <br>No one who has read the LN can call what Ufo did with Zero's last fight "good".<br>Shirou vs. Gil wins easily.</br></br>  <br>I legitimately don't understand why people keep posting this like it's the worst thing ever. It certainly doesn't look great but it's not terrible. It's more bad choreography choices than bad animation.</br>  <br>Shirou vs Gilgamesh is massively superior.</br>  <br><br>I feel like shirou fags are the same people who like bleach and think ichigo is a good character. Shirou is certainly one step ahead of bleach tier retardation but hes still well within the shallow end of the pool - like the entirety of the franchise that isn't zero.</br></br>  <br>Calm your tits, it will be fixed in the BDs</br>  <br> Shirou is obviously coming at me at full speed <br> Better stick out my arm so he can cut it off <br>No.</br></br></br>  <br>For something from Ufotable, that is by far the worst action sequence in any TM work they've made, and it's especially damning after coming from episode 20.</br>  <br>He was in the middle of pulling out Ea, Shirou was just too fast.</br>  <br>I feel like Kerry fags are the same people who like Naruto and think Sasuke is a good character. Kerry is certainly one step ahead of Naruto tier edgyness but he's still well within the emo end of personalities - like the entirety of Zero's cast.</br>  <br> Gil is as fast as Archer at full power <br> Archer can dodge Shirou at 1/10th power <br> Gil can't move his arm fast enough <br>People will defend this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gil vs Shirou also has a meaning since it is both; a way to show that Shirou resolution isn't just talking, and it also deals with the whole "fake ideals" thing that was introduced since the beginning.</br>  <br> Kirei vs Kerry <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rQF<wbr>fMyxa04A</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>Its sad that you make such a comparison without realizing how dumb it is. Zero is the only part of this franchize with any depth. Look at the banquet of kings, bluebeard and fagboy talking about god, or any of the other fantastic dialogues (comparatively - lets keep it real here this is all shit overall). UBW and the rest of this franchise has nothing. Nothing at all.</br></br>  <br> No one who has read the LN can call what Ufo did with Zero's last fight "good". <br>But going by that, anyone who has read the VN can't call what ufo did with UBW's last fight 'good'.<br><br><br>Yeah, it's not bad. But honestly, it's really fucking bad compared to good fights like Saber vs Kojirou. People just focus on it because it's the climax of the route, yet had QUALITY.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is a reason why he is known as the king of jobbers.</br>  <br>I meant meaning more in the sense of the individual moves that they took.<br><br>For example, while Zero was plagued with narration and exposition, every hit and attack had something that the user wanted to achieve whether it be to set up the opponent for another attack, to disable their circuits, or to feint.<br><br>In UBW, it felt more like a generic shounen clash of swords, especially when Shirou was up close with Gilgamesh and both just stood in one spot swinging (lol). In general it looked fantastic, but I can't really give it an edge over Zero, which was more reserved but had more impact.</br></br></br></br></br>  UBW by a fucking landslide. Zero's final fight is extremely poor and it hides behind its "realism" to mask that it was clearly a halfassed rush-job. I was so excited to see Zero's climax animated and they fucking blew it. For me it is pretty comparable to some of DEEN's blunders. At least people recognized that DEEN was shit and we got to see some of their abortions fixed, Zero will never get that opportunity because people lapped up with fight like it was a greatest scene in the history of anime. Shirou vs Gilgamesh was a little too heavily on the acrobatics but at least it was a spectacle, it was a celebration of an iconic scene, not a desperate death wheeze of a show about to fall apart. <br><br>Aoki is westaboo who takes inspiration from Nolanverse Batman and Man of Steel of all things for his works. Zero was made by a taticool action movie normalfag for taticool action movie normalfags.<br><br>Miura may make questionable changes, but at least he is fan of the series. You can see the love he has for the characters in the episodes he directs. UBW was made by a fan for fans. Sadly up until the last few episodes people crucified him for the changes without recognizing all the good he did.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou got stronger since then</br>  <br>Literally the day after?</br>   tfw it'll be years before we see Shirou vs Kotomine <br> FSN will have garnered more shitposting than SAO by that point </br>  <br>Does he get stronger from blood loss?</br>  <br> anyone who has read the VN can't call what ufo did with UBW's last fight 'good'. <br>I read it and I liked the adaptation. They didn't have the Rho Aias blocking Ea bullshit, made UBW swordspam look like it should and they actually had Shirou use it unlike DEEN, they showed Gil's hesitation to use Ea in a clear but subtle enough way, nailed the dialogues and facial expressions, used Emiya (as Zero should have done) and, of course, animation was good.</br></br>  <br><br>Don't bother explaining it. People who don't like zero in favor of some other part of the series are the same types who prefer the star wars prequels over the original. They need to see yoda jump around with his dildo saber or its not coooool enough. The concept of some deeper meaning or actions having weight to them is lost to them.</br></br>  <br>Not even a full day, it's just been a few hours.</br>  <br>Probably Kirei one hand blocking Kiritsugu</br>  <br>I have no problem with people that like Zero more than UBW, but saying that Zero has more deep than UBW isn't true.<br>Shirou by himself has more depth than any character in Zero, with the exception of maybe Kotomine, that was originally from the VN anyway.</br></br>  <br>are you serious?</br>  <br>Ichigo sucks.<br><br>I tolerate Shirou because he has cool powers, and at least grows up to not be annoying, well a different kind of annoying anyway.<br><br>Shirou is alright in UBW, and Prisma, terrible in Fate, and may as well be a different character in HF.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ufo sadly didn't do a good job at the beginning and the ending of Zero, while for UBW they nailed both of them. <br>UBW's climax wins by a big margin, having somewhat better animation, definitely better sound design and music, and as an adaptation of the original work.</br></br>  <br> Zero is the only part of this franchize with any depth <br>You can't be serious.<br>You may not have liked FSN but you can't deny it at least attempts to make some points.<br>Don't use "depth" to mean "things I liked". You're killing language.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I prefer the batcave. The UBW fight distracts me with no-aim-Gil and flying, no-need-for-swordspam Shirou.</br>  <br><br>He was getting combat experience from Archer, remember?<br><br>He couldn't fully utilize it against Archer because he was injured so much, but against Gil he was at full strength</br></br></br></br>  Man, I love shitposting in Fate threads.  <br> Look at the banquet of kings, bluebeard and fagboy talking about god, or any of the other fantastic dialogues (comparatively - lets keep it real here this is all shit overall). UBW and the rest of this franchise has nothing. <br>The banquet of kings is pretty much just Rider throwing a tantrum because he doesn't like Saber's wish, and the vast majority of what they discuss is extremely disconnected from how Rider wishes to save Saber, not to mention Gilgamesh just sits there and adds nothing to the conversation unlike how in Answer, Archer and Shirou's situation and words mirror Saber's own situation. Caster and Ryunosuke's discussions about god have less depth to them then the arguments about abortion you could claim HF makes.</br></br>  Most of the fights in UBW were trash. They tried to go for intense, over-the-top battles, but they ruined it with all that dialogue and monologue. Why the fuck do they do always do this? Unless the fight is at least a little grounded or strategic pausing the action for muh character development or to explain stuff will just make it shit.  <br>I hate it</br>  I think the main reason people are liking Kotomine vs Kirei besides it being built up over the course of the whole show is because it's also one of the only two good fight scenes in Zero.<br><br>Comparatively UBW had a bunch of good fight scenes so it harder to care as much about an individual one when there were so many more good fight scenes.</br></br>  <br>Maybe I'm bypassed by having read the LN and VN, but it looked just the opposite to me. I feel like Zero didn't transfer the original meaning while UBW did it.</br>   there are people who unironically think UBW had better fights than this. <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6dC<wbr>FpPyrSIQ</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>IMO it completely missed the point of the VN and why UBW was better than GoB. ufotable usually does good with "show, don't tell", but here they had Gil explain literally every detail and Gil admitting after that UBW was instant-win... despite not showing it.<br><br>Shirou gets up in Gil's face thanks to UBW blocking some of GoB - okay, that's good.<br>Then he sits there and goes on a rant about why he's going to beat Gil and counter him. Then he disarms Gil through brute force... and they both stare at the sword in the sky without either making a move. Then Gil fires GoB at Shirou and Shirou forgets he has UBW to block it.<br>Then Shirou spends the rest of the fight running around with raw anus and deflecting more swords with his own two hands, pretty much forgetting that UBW exists before flying on Raw Anus to slice Gil's arm off. <br>It really gave the impression that Shirou won through raw skill and power and not really UBW.<br><br>In the VN, it was completely different. Shirou baits Gil into a melee fight and keeps him there. This is because in UBW, Shirou always pulls out swords *slightly* faster than Gil can while on the offense. This means he will always get the first hit in - this is important because each hit SHATTERS both of their NPs, meaning that Gil will never have time to properly defend himself since Shirou resets the situation with each swing. This forces Gil back in neverending defensive loop until he tries something new such as pulling out Ea and paying the price for it. <br><br>In the VN, it's less a case of Shirou winning through superhuman abilities and raw skill but more of smartly exploiting the one advantage UBW has over GoB. Shirou even says himself that if he lets Gil get even a moment's breath, Gil would destroy him in a duel like he did Saber. <br><br>So yeah, as a fan of the VN I can't accept ufotable's adaption if we're going solely by how faithful they are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that <br> a fight </br></br>  <br>Man Rider sucks.<br><br>Even Shirou can dodge swords better then that.</br></br></br>  <br>Kerry vs. Kirei feels slow as fuck for a battle that is actually happening at a really fast pace.</br>  <br><br>Shirou had plot armor.<br>A ridiculous amount of it, while Rider didn't.</br></br></br>  <br> and they both stare at the sword in the sky without either making a move <br>God damn you autist it's just for dramatic effect it's like you've never watched any fight scene in any medium that has ever existed</br></br>  <br>And you read the bootleg translation of the novel.</br>  <br>Time alter</br>  <br> no-aim-Gil <br>In all seriousness, when has Gil ever really shown any competency in aim? He just spams shit and hopes it hits. Just look at his fight against Rider or Berserker in Zero. He just fires a bunch of shots in that general direction and hopes it kills someone.</br></br>  <br>The very fact that Shirou can disarm Gil is already far-fetched, considering both are just users.<br>The fact that not only does Shirou stop attacking at that point and he doesn't use UBW to counter sword spam is even sillier.<br><br>Like I said, it looks cool, but if you stop and examine the mechanics, it's just as you said - for dramatic effect. In the VN, every action had clear meaning on Shirou's part from the very first sword spam to the barrage of reckless swings he does.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Its probably better to spray numerous projectiles in a general direction than to pin point a specific area and shoot.</br>  <br>Shirou can replicate the skill of the original owner, Gil can't.</br>  <br>To be fair, thanks to the sheer number of NPs he doesn't need to aim.<br><br>What should be more of a problem with people is why Shirou has a clear shot at Gil in UBW, yet fires his swords around Gil's feet.</br></br></br>  <br>As far as action goes, that fight is pretty shitty.</br>  <br>Of all the shit Nasu comes up with, that one is the most bullshit.</br>  <br>But when he copies GIl's swords the original owner is Gil.</br>  <br>He uses the dust thrown up by the attack to get an opening and also block vision of Gil's GoB</br>  <br>Shirou isn't replicating the skill of the owner because he would've continued swinging and killed Gil after disarming him.</br>  <br>The monologues, slow motion and cuts to other stuff happen even when Time-Alter is not in use. <br>It would have been miles better if they went with a fast paced approach and made Time-Alter actually slow down the rhythm of the action.</br></br>  <br> He uses the dust thrown up by the attack to get an opening <br>Why? He had a clear shot right at Gil. Why not just shoot them at his head and be done with it instead of drawing out the fight?</br></br>  <br> it looks cool, but if you stop and examine the mechanics, it's just as you said - for dramatic effect. In the VN, every action had clear meaning <br>Because the VN isn't fucking animated.<br>You can't use the same standards for what a fight is supposed to show in a totally different medium.<br>Yes, sometimes things are going to happen for dramatic effect or just to look cool. If you can't deal with that you're going to hate the majority of all animated fight scenes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He almost cut Gil in half in the anime, and in the VN he was about to kill Gil before the grail interrupted and saved Gil from Shirou.</br>  <br>A lot of people complain that Shirou uses the swords he picks up too much in the anime, but it makes sense seeing as he runs out of mana right as he lands a fatal blow on Gilgamesh. Had he spammed more he might not have been able to hold the reality marble. He does counterspam enough but prefers to conserve mana throughout the fight.</br>  Why didn't Shirou just outspam Gil? Why did he have to get close in the first place?  <br>I'm assuming because he thought Gil would shoot down any blades that were coming towards him and if he missed and was able to press a tactical advantage it would be better.<br><br>He would have decapitated Gil right there if Gil was blindly swordspamming the smoke and was not armed and prepared for a close quarter fight</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Oh look people who still don't understand Shirou's character. At this point I'm considering if FSN is an "2deep4u" VN. If you can't understand FSN, just don't bother with actual literature. Ulysses will fry your small brains.<br><br>Then you have an idiot like who has to resort to buzzword because he just can't understand.<br><br>How the fuck do people not understand that Shirou doesn't have survivor's guilt or that the only reason he saves people is that he associates being happy with saving them. Of course it's a distorted way of thinking but that came from an empty being who lost his self in the fire and saw his soon to be foster father's happy face while saving him. This all you need to know to understand why Shirou wants to be seigi no mikata. He's essentially a good Kirei, where the latter associates being happy with making people suffer. Both have one way to be happy and thus try to maximize that cause for maximum effect.<br><br>There's also the figurative "Shirou is a sword" and his mantra which helps you visualize things more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You can't use the same standards <br>Anon, the original discussion is that the anime is different from the VN. Another anon said it was faithful and I'm saying it was completely changed. This isn't a bad thing, no one ever said it was, but you're blind if you can't see how the fight was fundamentally altered.<br><br><br> He almost cut Gil in half in the anime, <br>Like I said, if he really was channeling the owner's abilities, he would've continued swinging after disarming Gil. But they both kind of stopped and looked up to the sky. Either Shirou turns off his channeling of skill right then for no reason, or he never was channeling the owner's skill in the first place.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> can't recognize bait <br>This whole post is laughably pathetic.</br></br>  <br> Had he spammed more he might not have been able to hold the reality marble <br>That's not how UBW works. Projections are free once it's activated, and his prana is invested in keeping the RM up.<br>As long as UBW holds, Shirou can use all the projections he wants without paying for them.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the cost of swords in UBW goes down to nil, or pretty close to it. This is balanced by the fact that UBW is constantly draining prana every second.<br><br>Realistically speaking, there's no need for mana conservation in UBW since the swords are *already* there.</br></br></br>  <br>No it's not bait. Stop trying to save their face. Retards exist.</br>  <br> the original discussion is that the anime is different from the VN <br>Uh, what happened to <br> anyone who has read the VN can't call what ufo did with UBW's last fight 'good' <br>I thought that was the basis of the discussion here, whether it was good.  acknowledged that the anime version was different in several ways, but said that they were changes for the better.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It still costs mana to make swords fly around midair, does it not?</br>  <br>They didn't stop and look up dude. The scene was slowed down for dramatic effect.</br>  <br> Being a secondary <br>UBW gives free projections, no prana required. The only prana being consumed is for maintaining UBW. Technically, Shirou should've been going all out in spamming since he was on a time limit with unlimited projections.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that sword in the sky was Vajra or a similar weapon, activating it's ability forcing Shirou back.<br><br>What people don't get is that Shirou will block swordspam with melee if the swords are near him, it saves him the mana of levitating them into the GoB spam.</br></br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br>One of those posts were mine and I was completely baiting.<br>I really don't care who you self-insert into, m8.</br></br>  <br> anyone who has read the VN can't call what ufo did with UBW's last fight 'good' <br><br>Go further back to <br> No one who has read the LN can call what Ufo did with Zero's last fight "good". <br>If we're talking about a topic of faithfulness of an adaption, neither were particularly true to their source, although UBW is even less so since the entire fight was changed.<br><br> but said that they were changes for the better. <br>I'll disagree for reasons stated in my big blog post . We can stop here if you disagree on a fundamental level, since it's opinions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Its quite clear that he uses mana to shoot the swords at GoB.<br><br>Even if it's free to materialize the swords, it still takes mana to throw them.</br></br>  <br>I think you're mixing up replies, bro.<br>I'm the one who wrote this , and I've never replied to you until now. <br>Be aware that you're putting my words in another guy's mouth.<br>That's all, have a nice discussion.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nothing ever even hints at that in any source material or CM, so no.<br><br><br> I'm pretty sure that sword in the sky was Vajra or a similar weapon, activating it's ability forcing Shirou back. <br>Yeah, that's about as much as I can rationalize it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't that for the projections that are already UBW? The ones that he's copying from Gil should still cost mana.</br>  Guys they simply wanted a mix off sword spam counter spam, and Shirou slashing the swords away.<br><br>They did a nice even split and it looked nice.<br><br>That's all. Don't try and over think it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The way UBW works is that as soon as he 'downloads' something, it automatically appears in UBW. <br><br>The anime failed to explain it, but the big plot point is that UBW is his inner world. It's essentially his armoury that already has every weapon he's seen. Think of it as a spreadsheet that updates itself automatically as he adds new swords to it - no projections necessary.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Zeros easy, Fate stay night was felt like a bad fan fiction and shirou is a shit tier character.</br></br>  <br>Whether it's good shouldn't be solely tied to how faithful it is, I don't see how that became what this conversation had to be about.<br>Obsessing just over that seems like pedantry to me.</br></br>  <br>Not sure about that. <br>Once Shirou sees a sword it automatically gets stored in UBW, and since he already is inside UBW, it should just simply appear there on the ground.<br>It's not like Shirou is pulling anything outside the RM like when he does regular projections.</br></br></br>  <br>This isn't something to take pride in</br>  <br><br><br>There is absolutely no indication that it costs Shirou anything to manipulate the swords inside Unlimited Blade Works<br>They literally fly into his hands of their own accord when he faces Gilgamesh.<br>Unlimited Blade Works is Shirou's own internal world that absolutely embodies his concept of "sword", it does not in any way have to abide by the normal rules of the world; it is a Reality Marble.</br></br></br></br></br>  Does anyone unironically think UBW had better fights than Zero?<br>Seriously, Zero just does everything better than UBW except Shirou is easily better than Kerry.<br>No, the Visual Novel isn't better either.</br></br>  <br> No, the Visual Novel isn't better either. </br>  <br>u got me asshole</br>  <br>Fights between superhumans shouldn't feel grounded</br>  <br>The anime didn't really need to mention anything beyond the fact that his magic isn't creating weapons, but creating a world that houses infinite weapons. The second he creates that world, he has the infinite weapons at his disposal. For the actual confirmation on the mana cost for UBW, Archer's servant bio states that he can use his RM "without penalty." The main thing about Archer's attacks that cost mana are his use of broken phantams and projections outside of UBW, shields in particular being extra costly.</br>  <br>The first and second Archer vs Lancer fights were better than anything in Zero</br>  <br>Zero didn't have anything that special in terms of fights man.<br>Really, what are people referring to when they talk about the great fights? You've got batcave, the clusterfuck fight at the beginning, stupid jet shenanigans, Saber killing squids for three hours, the total non-fight that was Saber vs. Lancelot?</br></br>  Why doesn't Shirou just shoot every single sword he has stored in UBW at the same time at Gil?  <br> unironically </br>  <br>The Lancer fights, the Berserker fights and the final fight surpass everything Zero has to offer, at the very least on a technical quality perspective.</br>  <br> Oh crap, I was proven wrong better come up with something to save face on an anonymous board where no one knows me! <br> I was only pretended to act retarded, jokes on you! </br></br>   Same franchise <br> Same universe <br> Both are good <br> A lot of recurring characters <br><br>Why the fuck does it matter which one is 'better'?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kerry vs Kayneth was pretty good imo even if it was mostly just flashy effects and CGI.</br>  <br>I unironically like the VN and UBW adaptation more than Zero. <br>If you were more open-minded you will see that UBW had its fair amount of things that are better than Zero, like having a proper closure for example.<br>The fights are not even a joke, Zero has like two fights that can compare to to any UBW random fight.</br></br></br>  <br>While I'd say all of F/Z's fights were good, the only ones I'd put on the level of "this is amazing" were the two Berserker vs Gil scenes, Rider vs Gil, and Kiritsugu vs Kirei. They were the only ones I ever rewatched. Pretty much every fight in UBW were on the same level as these ones if not better like both Berserker fights, both Lancer vs Archer fights, the first Assassin vs Saber fight, Saber/Shirou/Rin vs Kuzuki/Caster, Archer vs Shirou, and Shirou vs Gil. UBW really blows F/Z out of the water in action scenes.</br>  <br>I was going to call you out but<br> at the very least on a technical quality perspective. <br>That's actually correct. Its smoother and has a more budget, but lacks in choreography and OST.<br>The fights were more inventive in Zero as well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's essentially two warring fanbases within the same franchise here. One side hates the "secondaries" that started with the prequel and praise the "mature" characters for generally shallow reasons, and the other side hates the "traditionalist" if you will VNfags who try to tell people to read something they don't want to read. <br>Yes, it's all very silly and petty.</br></br>  <br>UBW's actual fighting &gt; Zero's slow-paced, dialogue-plagued, poorly adapted "fights".<br>Not to mention muh guns, muh magic motorcycle and muh ancient spaceships vs JETS.</br></br>  <br>/a/utism</br>  <br>UBW's climax is obviously better from a visual and animation standpoint, but I like the music at the start of F/Z's fight. Honestly I prefer F/Z's soundtrack a lot more than UBW's, it's much more memorable. I also prefer the former in terms of story.</br>  <br> Whether it's good shouldn't be solely tied to how faithful it is <br>Anon, just read the original posts for why we're even having this discussion. You're not contributing anything.</br></br>  <br> Berserker fights in UTW <br> Archer vs Shirou <br><br>Those were the worst. Even rider vs shirou in the 10 seconds were better.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did OP upload the translated ones?</br>  <br>This.<br>I like UBW slightly more than Zero, but both are about the same level. If people stoped with the "Zero has more mature characters and meaningful themes because I say " and "the VN just because I say" everything will be better.</br></br>  <br>I'm just saying that the other anon misunderstood how UBW worked, claiming 'new' projections and firing them requires mana.<br><br>That is wrong.</br></br></br>  <br>They don't lack in OST. <br>Zero's music was pre-arranged and repeated in several fighs, while UBW's OST was tailor made for each scene. <br>You may like Zero's chantingfest over UBW's more Hollywood-esque apporach on a personal level, but on a technical level, UBW's OST was better.</br></br></br>  <br>your*</br>  <br>It isn't so much a matter of which one is better, the difference is that pretty much everyone loves Fate/Zero while there's a decent amount of people that think FSN is irredeemable shit. If you look at most internet forums, the general consensus, even on places like reddit, is that the FSN VN as a whole is better than Zero but Zero is better than any single route. The same can be said of the anime adaptations since Zero just works better as an anime, but even then most people aren't rating the two as being all that much different in quality. Most people are just upset with how the second half of the show was generally handled.<br><br>If everything goes well, HF will probably end up being much better than UBW adaptation wise since it'll benefit from the movie format. HF will hopefully only have one slow movie for days 11-14.</br></br></br>  <br>It probably requires concentration to control the swords like that, and doing them all at once would be a huge strain if not impossible?</br>  <br> Does anyone unironically think UBW had better fights than Zero? <br>Yes. Excluding Berserker's antics most of Zero's fights were extremely boring. And more than that, the Servants felt like people with glowing weapons rather than beings above and beyond regular humans.</br></br>  <br> Berserker fights <br> bad <br>How?<br>It even had the best choroegraphy out of all of them.</br></br></br></br>  <br> And more than that, the Servants felt like people with glowing weapons rather than beings above and beyond regular humans. <br>Ironically, Zero conveyed that better than UBW, since half of UBW's servants were defeated by humans.</br></br>  <br> technical level <br><br>Is this a new meme word for objectively? OST can't be technically better, it's just a preference.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see how you could not like the Berserker fights. Everything about Gil vs Berserker was perfect and Saber/Archer's battle against him was really great. I'm looking forward to how HF handles his two battles as well. Really hoping we actually get to hear Berserker say "Run" like in the VN.</br>  <br>HF true.<br>A case could be made for SLH though</br></br>  <br>Not him and I couldn't care less about anime OSTs, but he probably means that UBW's soundtrack has better production quality i.e. it is better technically.</br>  <br>Rider &amp; Gil against a perfect counter isn't half.</br>  <br>Reminder that DEEN OST was better.</br>  <br>Yes, music can be technical depending on how difficult it is to compose it or on how advanced is the equipment you have.</br>  <br>I read the VN but I also enjoyed Zero, although I think Zero is worse than the UBW anime and VN since it's not as good of a story in the first place, but the only thing I really hate is Zerobabbies. Also secondaries are annoying but only because they post stupid shit, not because they haven't read the VN.</br>  <br>Rider, Gil, and Saber.<br>Lancer was technically killed by a human.</br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Thx, m8.</br>  How people can prefer a spam fight between a studdent (with some plot armor) and a dumb when you have a cool fight between 2 natural ennemis who wants to confront them since the beginning ?  Prisma &gt; Carnival Phantasm &gt; Zero &gt; Tsukihime &gt; Kagetsu Tohya &gt; HF &gt; only Ilya's scenes in HA &gt; UBW adaptation &gt; Fate &gt; UBW  <br>Neither Saber nor Lancer were taken out fighting against a regular human.</br>  <br>Wait, I forgot Saber lost to Kuzuki.</br>  <br> Kirei vs Kerry anticlimatic QUALITY battle in the batcave <br> good </br></br>  <br>Dude no</br>  <br> KT <br> Better than anything <br><br>I can't count how many times I've fallen asleep while reading it</br></br></br></br>  <br>She "lost" to him in the sense that she got thrown across the room once, but she just got back up.<br>After that she would never lose to him again since she's seen his technique, which is why they had to run the fuck away.</br></br>  <br>What? KT is fucking hilarious; I loved it. I don't agree with the guy's rating, but how could you not find it loads of fun. Hell, Shiki actually has a personality in it.</br>  <br>Animation, OST and meaning behind the fight.<br><br> 2 natural enemies <br>They are not, they just thought they were.<br>Kirei realise it, and looses interest in Kerry by the end.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would anyone use such a retarded fighting style? How do can such a retarded fighting style even exist?</br>  <br>Why did Kuzuki toss her across the room and not just snap her neck?</br>  <br>Because Kuzuki was supposed to just be a one-time assassin. Read F/HA. That being said, he could wreck most people despite being a one-trick pony.</br>  <br>Read the VN.<br><br><br>Kind of hard to snap a Servant's neck just like that. And she was getting kind of frisky with her sword.</br></br></br></br>  <br> snap her neck <br>That actually wouldn't kill a proper servant (it would kill Saber though since she has special circumstances). Caster likely told Kuzuki where servants can be killed (their spiritual core) and was probably trying to aim for that.</br></br>  <br> animation <br>Watch shiro flying during 10 minutes is not very entertaining .<br> OST  <br>that's your opinion<br> meaning behind the fight <br>i could miss somethig but shiro want to defeat gil just beacause gil want to kill humans ( or 99%)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> this entire post </br>  <br>Did you actualy miss the whole "Fake vs. Original" thing?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>who are you quoting?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You.</br>  <br>He jumps two times, and the second looked great.<br> that's your opinion <br>Hearing full Emiya is far better than hearing Battle is to the Strong another time.<br> i could miss somethig but shiro want to defeat gil just beacause gil want to kill humans ( or 99%) <br>I'm talking about how the fight relates with the fake ideals Shirou have because their are not his but of Kerry. Also, it gives Shirou the chance to put his words in actions.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the second jump was actually retarded. Gil shot hundreds of swords and none of them hit Shirou. Seriously?</br>  I'm not underage so Zero. Kirei also happens to be the only great fate character so that plays a part too.  <br> I'm not underage so Zero. </br>  <br> Gil shot hundreds of swords and none of them hit Shirou. <br>Thats serious Gil for you. <br>See Rider vs Gil, he also shot hundreds of swords and like 4 actually connected with Rider.<br>If Shirou hadn't use Rho Aias, the result would have been the same.</br></br></br></br>   we will never get a series about Kiritsugu summoning Archer   <br>Yeah I'm not some 14 year old who still has delusions of being a hero. F/SN isn't bad but it's not great either, unless you're self inserting as Shirou.</br>  <br><br>How do these ESL retards sneak in here?</br></br>  <br> that's your opinion <br>No, it's my opinion.</br></br>  <br>Joke's on you, Kerry is a bigger manchild than Shirou.</br>  <br> UBW gives free projections, no prana required <br>If he will learn to utilize UBW on his own it should be fucking retarded against mages of his time.<br>Who of human opponents can even stand against a homing noble phantasm rain like this?</br></br></br>  <br> homing <br>based on what?<br>There's literaly 1 sword-arrow that we know is homing</br></br></br>  <br>Right but unlike Shirou he suffers for it.

There's a clear message of "this guy is insane dont do that shit." In UBW the message is "this guy is insane but he's cool as fuck." It's a matter of how the insanity is presented.</br>  <br> Prisma &gt; <br> Tsukihime &gt; <br>I laugh at your shit taste, and possible brain damage.</br></br></br>  <br>See <br><br>He literally was faced with his ideal being a fake.

I hear that it was "badly paced" EVERYWHERE. But to me it was perfect, episode 1 had a huge plot twist to kick things off and each ep. after that had a defined point to it aside from maybe 16 and 19. There was no school or cooking and the SoL scenes when they did happen were great like Shirou confessing and marking his territory over Lancer, and I liked the high jump flashback in 22 as well.</br>  <br>Do you have the page where Waver lost his shit watching those dead bodies?</br>  <br>For me, my biggest complaint about UBW 2nd cour is the dramatic drop in quality of the battle choreography. In particular, I didn't like that one of my favorite fights in the VN, the 2nd lancer vs archer fight, was just reduced to flashy lights and NP vs NP. Yes, the fight ends like that, but the buildup to the end is what makes it so good.</br>  <br>He does worse shit in the manga. Like forced autocannibalism, the rib cage umbrella, the flayed skin jumpsuits, the half-cranium clock, the rib cage trash bin, the eye socket light bulbs, and maybe more shit I can't recall at the moment.<br><br>Basically, Uryuu is a handyman.</br></br></br>  <br>This one?</br>  <br>I watched that fight again and the choreography at the beginning was my favorite in the series, especially when Lancer blinks to him and Archer barely dodges, plus they actually put in the sound his lance makes as it strikes which sounded cool. Could have been a bit longer before the "fatal lack of pride in your sword skills-&gt;NP" part like you say though.</br>  <br><br><br>Is all this really necessary?</br></br></br>  <br>To apparently make idiots think they're watching a "deeper, more adult" show. Worked like a charm.</br>  <br>YES! Thank you.</br>  <br/>  <br>But the first Archer and Lancer fight has better choreography. The Beserker fight is probably the strongest in the series.</br>    <br> Saber Alter <br><br>wait what?<br>I thou this was just pedo and shit.<br>Pick up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, actually. Team Kuuru's outright ridiculous psychopathy adds a nice bit of levity to the otherwise mostly deadpan tone of Zero.</br>  <br>She only shows up for like three episodes in the first season.</br>  <br>Why is Uryuu speaking French? Doesn't he know he's Japanese?</br>  <br>I disagree, I prefer fukasawa's simply because he made original themes for each fight instead of just being lazy and putting the battle is to the strong for most fights</br>  <br> and thus, the boy would become a hardass </br>  <br>It's pedo with cool fights and some other stuff.</br>  <br>Out of courtesy because he's in Gilles's company, of course.</br>  <br> Doesn't he know he's Japanese? <br>You know, even though I know he's Japanese and all, I always think of him as Korean for some reason. I see his mug and I think, "Yeah, that guy's obviously Korean, no doubt."</br></br>  <br>That's not even the best fight</br>  <br>I can think of no good reason to the contrary.</br>  <br>People just don't stop talking. <br><br>UBW dialogue is dancing around in circles instead of getting to the point.</br></br></br>  <br>is that girl on a table still alive or something</br>  <br>Why couldn't he just rape them like a normal psychopath?</br>  <br>Maybe?</br>  <br> What were people's problems with UBW 2nd cour? <br>The general complaints people have about UBW are depend on where you look but most agree that the 2nd season was worse than the first.<br><br>MAL super primary autists hate everything about the 2nd cour. They think Caster's character was ruined, that since Shirou had no monologues in season 1, his character comes across as unbelievable in season 2, they don't like any of the action scenes and blame Miura for every tiny detail. They think the last episode of the series shouldn't have existed and pretty much regard the VN as the bible, concluding that FSN is impossible to adapt in anime form. If the HF adaptation ends up being good, expect these people to go on a murderous rampage since to them Ufo made UBW be worse than Tsukihime tier.<br><br>Secondaries didn't like how the series didn't pander to them, played the story closer to the VN, and wasn't a sequel to F/Z, getting upset that some characters didn't get enough screen time or development.<br><br>Then there are just the people who don't like Shirou and his storyline, so they're upset UBW followed him and pretty much only him.<br><br>There are also some complaints about the quality of the fights in part 2 being worse than in part 1, though despite all the complaints, most people seem to agree that episodes 15, 20, 24, and 25 were each contenders for best episode in the series. Overall, most people still really enjoyed the anime, understand that you need the whole VN to get the full picture, and seem to agree that this route is just hard to adapt into anime form.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> rape <br>Boring.

Seriously, she's barely learning to deal with the possibility of being the bastard daughter of some woman she's never met after 12 years of lies and people think they're just going reveal that she's a freak of science and have her deal with that in one chapter?<br><br> There are way too many plot holes for it to be a misunderstanding. <br><br>That's quite the understatement.<br><br> And Karin is still being treated as a plot point rather than as a character. <br><br>If she doesn't appear in the next chapter, i'm calling bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>They really should make a "Downfall" movie about Tobirama</br>  <br> Springtime of Incest <br><br> Select all images with cakes </br></br></br>  I hope the next movie is about Tobirama being ressurected in order to eliminate anyone with a dojutsu kekkei genkai  <br>But then hintana would be kill, and her and het absolute victory is the whole reason I even started being interested in this again.</br>  <br>Here's how it's going to go<br> Sakura is the mom, it's all a misunderstanding, karin had sasuke's umbilical cord. <br>This has 99.9% chance of being the case <br> Karin is the mom but is unfit to take care of her because she's dead or adamant to serving orochimaru's little shop of horror or something  <br>.09% of being the case<br> Sarada is a clone/test tube baby <br>.01% chance of being the case.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that manjaw <br>Himawari looks like Naruto.

It'd be more believable, though not much less stupid, for Karin to have Sarada's cord.<br><br><br><br>esplain, hombre</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but where exactly did the sasuke come out? </br>  <br>It's the only way to make since of the DNA test. also karin was crazy, she either stole it in hopes of cloning up her own sauce or sasuke gave it to her as a "Yeah sorry" for not returning her feelings.</br>  <br><br><br> Sauce brought it with him when he left the village because muh dead family reminder <br> Karin eventually nicked it from him because she's a creepy stalker <br> by that point Sauce was already too steeped in DARKNESS to care about getting it back <br> Suigetsu mistook it for hers <br>Just watch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Madara didn't go crazy because of a rock. He did it because all his brothers were killed and he wanted to put an end to all suffering. A rock just showed him how to do it.</br>  <br>Uzumaki faces are round during youth. That's like the one trait that Namikaze genes don't completely erase.

She's almost certainly too young to be a genin now, so she's probably in the academy.</br>  <br> putting the Sunflower in harm's way with your silly little ninja games </br>  <br>So what did Nurudu say/do to set him the fuck off like that?</br>  <br>But being a Ninja is like military service, you aren't obligated to continue.</br>  <br> I fucked your mom. </br>  <br>To be fair Sarada was just being emotional and acting out thanks to having the worst day of her life and now feeling like she never had a real family at all. She didn't really have any plan on what she was even going to do kinda like  what the girl from Inside Out did , rathen than Sasuke who left the village to break all bonds he made and to sell his body to a criminal/pedophile/future war hero to gain more power.</br>  <br><br>If Sasuke cared enough to have his umbilical cord this whole time, it's unlikely he'd have ever allowed Karin a chance to steal it.</br></br>  <br>see<br><br>Honestly, there's a better chance that it's his than Karin's. MISUNDERSTANDINGS, everybody! <br><br>Of course, that's only a very small part of the equation. Because pages like pic related don't add up if that's all there is to whose dressing made our Salad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish.</br>  <br><br>There is no way MISUNDERSTANDINGS could be the case except through a bunch of contrived unrelated circumstances that somehow converge in a most unnatural fashion.<br><br>It's hard to believe even Kishi could sink that low. At least with the Tobi is Madara ruse, he just Ben Kenobi'd it and made it true from a "certain point of view"</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ninja Okusan + Ninja Yotsuba featuring Hinata and Himawari <br>Yes please.</br></br>  <br> Ninja Yotsuba <br>say no more</br></br>  <br> all dojutsu comes from kagura who had them all <br> except the tensiegan of course which appeared out of thin air. <br>Stop implying kishi's writing is good enough to make sense.</br></br></br>  <br>Joke's on you, assistant is a Sasukefag.<br><br>Hinata and Himawari would be as irrelevant as they are right now I guess.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't get this image</br></br>  &gt;&gt;&gt;/gaia/  <br>Hinata got a surprising amount of chapters in Springtime of Youth.</br>  <br><br>Pawerlebel stuff is a bit different.</br></br>  <br/>  <br> &gt;all dojutsu comes from kagura who had them all <br> kagura </br></br>  <br>With Naruto tier animation budget I can't even see faces on those portraits.</br>  <br> Obito is a total waifufag plus childhood friend worshipper promoting shit flinging <br>Sounds about right.</br></br>  <br><br>The most important question is: Will the children ever have their own movie/manga/series or will Naruto and Sauce always steal their limelight?</br></br>  <br>Whatever the case it will end with Sarada considering Sakura her true mom and Sasuke being forgiven for everything bad he has done and getting called "the coolest papa".</br>  <br>It'll be like the DBZ movies. Yeah maybe Gohan or Trunks gets to do something cool, but Goku shows up to Kamehameha or Super Dragon Fist or Spirit Bomb the bad guy at the end anyway.<br><br>Naruto: Revival of M when?</br></br></br>  <br><br> trying to use Mugen Tsukuyomi so he can be with his waifu <br>Yeah, that's /a/ alright</br></br></br>  <br>*kaguya<br>I'm tired<br><br><br> naruto had a crush on sakura because he shared her need to be noticed <br> lol jk it was solely to compete with sasuke. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why even bother with the next generation if they're not the new MCs?</br></br>  Post things you're hoping for but won't happen in the movie. <br><br> Naruto dies. </br></br>  <br> Obito just wanted to make anime real <br>He WAS the coolest guy.</br></br>  <br>Sarada is the MC of the gaiden, Boruto is the MC of the movie.<br><br>The rest are irrelevant side characters that are just there to interact with the two of them while they are not having daddy issues.</br></br></br>  <br>And Zetsu was a NEET that never leaves his mom</br>  <br>Yep, even she knows that, thats why she quit</br>  <br><br>she never wanted to become Hokage to begin with until Naruto tnjed her</br></br>  <br>Hamura just had a giant oedipus complex</br>  <br> more otsuki <br>Jesus christ are all of hamura's descendants Cunts? (with the exception of the hyuuga). Why do these guys want to fuck the planet? and how does kidnapping naruto achieve that? and assuming they're strong enough to subdue naruto how are they going to lose to little shit (boruto)?</br></br>  <br><br>That's the thing some people don't get. Sasuke no matter what he does will be forgiven. If Kishi wanted to, he could make so Sarada has three siblings by different mothers who aren't Sakura or Karin and everyone would accept it. He gets away with everything.<br><br><br><br><br>And yet you don't think Kishi is just as capable of making Sasuke have a sex drive directed at Karin of all people in spite of the fact that Sasuke touching any woman already feels out of character?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sarada is the MC of the gaiden <br><br>I wish. It honestly doesn't feel like it. Sure, she has gotten a lot of screentime but Naruto and Sauce were always there to solve her problems for her. Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed seeing her develop. But I wish she would've been on her own more. Naruto basically assisted her in every battle, both physically as well as psychologically.<br><br> Boruto is the MC of the movie. <br><br>Is that the impression you get from the trailers? At least to me, it seems like Naruto and Sasuke will once again be the ones who steal the limelight. Bolt's daddy issues will get the story going, but it most likely will not be him who saves the day, but either his father or his father's butt-buddy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Don't mind me, just best opening coming through<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qHk<wbr>1-e3pMDQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>We don't care about who Salad considers her mom. All we care about is dashing the perverted hopes of SS landwhales. That's it.</br>  <br>I'm still of the opinion that she's one of Orochimaru's experiments and the chord was saved for more cloning shenanigans.</br>  <br>That's not Silhouette. <br><br> The brief Guy moment is hype as fuck though. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Best ending: http://a.uguu.se/jggilo_BestEnding.<wbr>webm</wbr></br></br>  <br> but it most likely will not be him who saves the day, but either his father or his father's butt-buddy <br>Doubt it. They keep on pushing this whole "new generation surpassing the old" shit, even with the trailers. He'll probably just asspull some way for Bort to kill a fusion god.<br><br>I liked the theory that his super duper special technique pierces the enemy and then explodes inside of them like fucking Dig Dug.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So long as Cuckura's not the real mom. That's all that really matters.<br><br><br> The brief Guy moment is hype as fuck though. <br>Friendly reminder that it's finally here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well guy is the greatest. He was the only person other than Naruto and Sauce to injure Six Paths Madara. And he did it through sheer determination.<br><br>Guy is a great role model for any lost youth</br></br></br>  <br> So long as Cuckura's not the real mom. That's all that really matters. <br>Could easily be Karin + an Uchiha's DNA.<br><br>I mean, Shin had to come from somewhere, so the Uchiha part is easy  Sarada could even be his daughter . And Karin was on hand and had that special Uzumaki blood.</br></br></br></br>  <br> And he did it through sheer determination. <br><br>He did it by sacrificing his life. I wonder why not more people used that technique during the war. Guy's father obviously wasn't the first one who used it because Madara already knew about it. Other people are known to be able to open gates as well, such as Kakashi or Lee. So there should be more than one 8-gates-user in the world. It would be reasonable for a nation to have a suicide squad of 8-gates-users.</br></br></br>  <br> Basically born with ninja multiple sclerosis <br> Still managed to kick God's torso out through sheer guts <br>Based Guy.</br></br></br>  <br>Just because you can open some gates doesn't mean you can open all. Lee could only open 6</br>  <br><br>Kishi isn't going to go so far as to make Sarada not Sasuke's kid.<br><br>Even if Sarada were an experiment, she'd have to have Sasuke DNA at the very least.</br></br></br></br>  <br> And with the help of three kage level ninjas and the student capable of using his same power-up </br>  <br><br><br><br>You guys are so fucking deep in the rabbit hole. Can't wait for next week's chapter proving you wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We'll find out on Thursday. Maybe even sooner if Evil decides to show her ugly face one last time.</br>  <br>Top taste<br><br><br> not Silhouette. </br></br></br></br>  <br>He still was beating the utter shit out of Madara with just Evening Elephant. Night Guy allowed him to kick Madara so hard he warped spacetime.</br>  <br> Can't wait for next week's chapter proving you wrong <br> next week <br> Sunday </br></br></br>  <br> that hype as fuck konoha crush opening <br> absolutely none of it actually happened. <br>Still mad.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I really hope Evil and Rai don't spoil it this time actually. I know I won't be able to avoid them because of my desire to always be among the first to discuss spoilers for anything with /a/</br></br>  <br><br>Still don't understand why Madara didn't just use shinra tensei there.</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WZN<wbr>9fwQBLtI</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>This one?<br> no Konoha Kunoichi vs. Konan fight <br>Yeah I'm mad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shinra Tensei can be withstood with enough force, as Naruto showed against Pain. At that point, Guy could generate enough force to overcome Chibaku Tensei by himself.</br>  <br><br>Then Madara should've just used wood clones until Gay runs out of steam.</br></br>  <br><br>No time</br></br>  <br>why can't we ever have nice things</br>  <br><br>If there's only one chapter, that probably means the conclusion is pretty simple and easy for Kishi to write. Maybe we're underestimating or overestimating Kishi here. Things could just be exactly the way they seem.</br></br>  <br> had a shit ton of filler <br> couldn't dedicate some to shit like ino and co vs konan </br></br>  I'm going to post this everyday until you like it.  <br><br>That's what was missing!</br></br>  <br>did you know that you are very cute and deserve to be loved unconditionally?</br>      <br><br>Fixed!</br></br>  So where the fuck was she?  <br><br>auditioning for sao, she got sick of beta kirito</br></br>  <br>Bell is op enough to one shot goliat.

It's will be better with proper closure but probably the action and animation takes too much budget for proper ending party or explanation about bells skill.</br>  <br>  implying kirito is not beta </br>  So, can all we agree that vanilla is best flavor?  <br>He can one shot kill goliath level 5 florr boss he is not beta.</br>  <br>I prefer my icecream to be chocolate and mocha flavored.</br>  So it's confirmed in lastest eps that bell stronger than ryuu and mostly at average level 5 adventurer.

But really, is Vanilla actually the best flavor?<br>Or is chocolate objectively superior?</br>  <br>Beru-kun would still get raped by Ryuu and a lot of other adventurers, but he has a nuke for when shit hits the fan.</br>  <br>Vanilla all the way, brother.</br>  <br><br>That sag...</br></br>  <br>Hopefully Never.</br>  <br>What do you mean. Ryuu cannot even scratch goliat let alone killed it. So do 500 people there.</br>   there are people on /a/ RIGHT NOW who wouldn't fuck Hestia <br><br>Explain yourself, homosexuals.</br></br>  <br>500 is over kill. Probably 1 hundred people.</br>  <br><br>It depends whether she is going to be clingy afterwards. She is completely dependent.</br></br>  <br>Not enough source material.</br>  <br>Because she's not vanilla aizcream you filthy hestia-fag.</br>  <br>Scrap this i missed the ending scenes.</br>  <br> literally 4 to 5 better looking girls in the same show <br> ''hurr everyone should like Hestia'' </br></br>  <br><br>You have 10 seconds to name a single better better than Bestia Hestia.<br><br>That's right, you can't.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They killed Goliath at the 17th floor and went up.</br>  <br>Bell is shit compared to her, she dealt most of the damages with her magic, Bell could charge Argonaut because he was protected, and his allies had done most of the work.</br>  <br>No, have you even seen the anime bell completely obliterated goliath with itd full powered regen still intact. Ryuu cannot even pierce that meat.</br>  <br>Ryuu is merely distractor like the rest of the people there.</br>  <br><br>I don't care about your stupid opinion. I won't even try to state the obvious anymore.</br></br>    <br>Are you stupid. Please watch carefully or try lurking before posting. It's that clear in the anime where the regen try protect the core luckyly bell agi is very high to give a final blow before covered by the regen.</br>  <br><br>I want to fuck Aiz but I feel guilty trying to fuck an autistic girl.</br></br>  <br>Your opinion is stupid and I am not even one of those guys you replied to.</br>  <br>Bell.</br>  <br><br>Bell isn't a woman.</br></br>  <br>No, he's not, your point?</br>  <br><br>Yeah yeah, samefag.</br></br>  <br>Exactly.</br>  <br>Is okay if you're autistic yourself?</br>  <br>  more than 1 people disagreeing with you, it's must be samefag <br>Nice logic you have there.<br>Newfag pls</br></br></br>  <br>Sure thing bro.</br>  <br>fug</br>  <br>Can't argue with that.</br>  <br>Is there any info what skill bell used against goliath? He make himself pure white or emit light on his entire body.</br>  <br>Argonaut. Now fuck off.</br>  <br>nobody know waht the fuck hapening in this ep</br>  <br>Argonaut cannot make his entire body pure white. It's mostly emit light on his weapon peak if it skill attack or in one of his hand if it's charged firebolt.</br>  Where was the giant skelator?  <br>It's easy. It just mean bell is stronger than any level 4 and mostly stronger than average level 5 adventurer. Espescially in terms of power.</br>  <br>Goliath without full armored regen is in form of skull. The flesh is its shield.</br>  Smelling her armpits in the corner  The sexual tension between these two is unbearable. Can anyone spoil me when will they fuck in the novels?  <br>One brings the toys, the other brings the beer</br>  <br> sexual tension <br><br>They're both straight, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Straights is nonexistent species in the anime world.</br>  <br><br>And one of them is elf, so it doesn't count as straight or homo.</br></br>  https://twitter.com/hegame/status/6<wbr>14474394509799424<br><br>Anime producer, editor, and LN twitter account making bait post about animating Oratoria.</br></br></wbr>  Does anyone have a quoted version of the incantation they were saying in full?  <br>Adhd avatar. ...nice</br>  this shit is so bad it's not even funny<br><br>i'm embarrassed the author wrote this and thought it was good enough to show people</br></br>  <br> i'm embarrassed the author wrote this and thought it was good enough to show people <br>You haven't read Zhan Long where the chinese MC university student takes on roughly 20 elite usa special forces and wins by killing most of them and taking the others prisoner for interrogation. The MC even does better in the game. Unlike a lot of other stories, this MC also has a lot of patriotic power leveling activity outside the game.</br></br>  <br> implying you know what the author hasn't explicitly explained </br>  <br>Just like every anime ever right? Fuck off.</br>  Surprised they didn't show Freya either, I still liked the ending but it really needs a sequel.  So how exactly does Argonaut work? Assuming it isn't a chargeable "I win" button  <br>Not really an "I win" attack, but it is basically a charge based on desire to win/time that significantly boosts his attack power, balanced by an extremely long cooldown.<br><br>In terms of adventurer abilities, it's not hugely impressive, but it definitely has utility.</br></br></br>  <br>It is a charge, but not I win.<br><br>The one he used against Argonaut took 3 minutes of charge up time, which for all intents and purposes are too long to be worthwhile in most fights. When he went against the Goliath in volume 8 again, without Ryu and Asufi, they can't do shit against the boss (which is only Level 4 compared to this one) and was actually on the losing side. Argonaut has an insane drawback that is supposed to drain all your stamina, so he is a sitting duck for a while after using it (depending on the charge time).<br><br>It wasn't until Tsubaki (Level 5) came that they could win.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The one he used against Argonaut <br>The one he used against Goliath***</br></br>  <br> not hugely impressive <br> let him one shot a level 5 area boss just after turning level 2 </br></br>  <br>I thought the point was his first shot did jack shit? <br>And even after the rest of the group did their shit his second shot wasn't enough to finish it. <br><br>Didn't Aiz actually solo a level 5 boss by herself?</br></br></br></br>  <br>His first shot obliterated everything it hit. He just stupidly aimed at the head that quickly regenerated.<br><br>Isn't Aiz level 6 though?</br></br></br>  <br>Ryuu looks like she can solo a normal Goliath herself</br>  <br>Welf did more damage than Bell that fight.<br><br>Ryuu and Asfi were undisputed MVPs there though. <br><br>All Bell did was get the final hit, which in turn let him hog all the glory.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>1. It didn't one shot the boss. The boss did not die after the hit, and was in the process of regenerating. If Bell wasn't quick thinking while everyone was retardedly going "oh no", it would've just come back.<br><br>2. If it was just Bell v. Goliath, or Bell with Welf and Lili v. Goliath, they all would've died. He only had the time to cast due to 2 Level 4's, another Level 2, and a strong magic item (along with every other adventurer on that floor) distracting the Goliath.<br><br>3. Compared to the other, higher level adventurers, it's a very unimpressive power, it's just an attack power boost, and those are a dime a dozen. Lefiya at Level 3 gets to break one of the rules of adventurers and can cast any number of magic spells, albeit with some restrictions. Most other adventurers are hard-capped at 3 spells.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ever played Monster Hunter? Do you know how Great Swords work?<br><br>A full charged greatsword will outdamage weapons a bit above them and can do more damage in one swing. That's the Argonaut ability in a nutshell.<br><br>And Bell still didn't kill Goliath with it, just exposed the magic stone.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, he isn't. In a fight he'd be destroyed by any lvl 3+ adventurer, they have better stats and abilities. His nuke won't do shit since he wouldn't have time to charge it and even if he would, he'd probably never be able to hit them with it.</br>  <br><br>Is DanMachi an accurate depiction of Monster Hunter?</br></br>  <br>It's been already explained in the previous threads.<br><br>The boss has a regeneration ability that's based on its mana. So to kill it, first you have to drain the mana.<br><br>Even though it looked like it was regenerating all the time, at the same time its mana reserves were being depleted.<br><br>At the end when everyone used their strongest skill was when it took the largest hits to its mana pool, Welfs OP sword being the last straw.<br><br>All Bell did was the final blow at a point where the boss couldn't regenerate.<br><br>The crystal scene is anime original.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She wasn't when she did it, it's how she got to level 6.</br>  <br> fairlyoddparents.webm </br>  <br>Damn.. someone should shop a sparkle on his teeth. And then the Crest Toothpaste logo on the bottom.</br>  <br>hestia.dance</br>  I just learned a Light Novel, is actually a Nirmal novel with a picture inserted every couple of pages. It's for writers that never found a Manga artist to team up with them  <br>I can barely imagine Bell defeating a Velocidrome.</br>  I love how these LNs with Gary Stu protagonists always have faggots coming out of the woodworks to defend the Gary Stu in detail, saying that the Gary Stu isn't asspulling, he's taking advantage of established mechanics.<br><br>Meanwhile it's clear to anyone that the Gary Stu is asspulling and the writer makes shit up as he goes.<br><br>Touma, Kirito, ONII-SAMA, Bell-kun, same shit different face</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck is it offline?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=d5I<wbr>hpNYy5Dg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Please no. They already ruined one season. If they animate Oratoria too they'll probably find a way to give Hestia more screentime than Ais, on top of ruining all of Ais's scenes and design. Hasn't the author seen the BD sales?</br>  <br> Shoehorn more Hestia into Oratoria <br><br>I don't dislike Hestia, but that would be so completely retarded dear god please no,</br></br></br>  Finished the anime, does the light novel worth reading?<br>Does the anime skip a lot of thing?</br>  <br>They already did it to the main series. What makes you think they won't do it in Oratoria?<br><br>Not to mention they've flat out said that "we don't know how to animate/draw Ais". Why then would they think it would be a good idea for them to animate Oratoria, a series that is entirely focused on Ais? Fucking greedy incompetent cunts.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean someone should "shop" a cumshot on his teeth and add the brazzers logo.</br>  So glad I wasn't turned off by the series title.<br><br>Mmm...Vanilla.</br></br>  <br>Too poor.</br>  <br>No, it's weak only able to destroy the ripped head that has been attacked numerous time. It's uncomparable to bellmore than half body attack.</br>  <br>It did one shot the boss. He already obliterated it but Regen help him survive with few hp because the attack is not focused to the real core because it's hidden.</br>  <br>No, this the longest charge because the limit off and aimed attack. In reality argonout charge is very short even bell never like he charge anything when use it.</br>  <br> implying he is </br>  <br>Yeah you're right. Plot Armor is one hell of a defense.<br><br>Get real dumbass, "Beru-kun" is a piece of pure shit who gets powerups out the ass when his shitty friends lives are on the line. It's like he's pussy mode 24/7 until a big monster comes threatening MUH FRIEZENS</br></br></br>  <br> It did one shot the boss <br> Regen help him survive <br> He survived the attack, therefore he got one shot <br><br>Sure thing bro.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So where the fuck was she? <br>You missed TWO separate anime episodes where it was stated the Loki party was heading up and out from the dungeon. The analogy from elementary school is that your reading comprehension skills need improvement. Reading comprehension used to be taught in elementary school, but with the republican party "no child left behind" act, lots of courses were made much easier by teachers and school administrators in order for their schools to look good with high GPA and high graduation rates. The higher the GP and graduation rate, the bigger your salary is how the NCLB act sums up. <br><br>Due to the NCLB, it's no wonder your comprehension skills are lacking. Such skill training was moved out of elementary school into the high school realm as optional courses for AP students. I grew up in my area, had kids, and saw how those classes were moved in our school system thru the years since NCLB. NCLB was good for the good schools as they made even more money. But almost all other schools became worse because they watered down courses in order to keep their current level of federal funding or gain more funds.<br><br>I apologize to OP if "comprehension" training in school was not the cause of your problem. But I've seen so much comprehension problem between average students of my time period and today's average students and your question fit neatly into those symptoms.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> son of mutherfucking Zeus <br>Yeah why the fuck is he so garystu?</br></br>  <br>This os not argonaut but limit off. Argonout charge is very shirt he one shot baby dragon without charging he also one kill 3 minos without passive move. His charging is as shory as he is chanting firebolt.</br>  <br>I'm getting real fucking sick of gay people.<br>Every fucking thread it's "I'm gay and everybody has to know lol"<br>Fucking faggots</br></br></br>  <br>Ryu would slice him up before he could react.<br>Remember how Aiz was destroying him with just a scabbard without even trying?</br></br>  <br> Because she's not vanilla aizcream you filthy hestia-fag. <br><br>Ice cream has been made from human milk. With Hestia's breasts you can make a lot more ice cream than from Aiz. Furthermore, I bet Hestia's milky motherly flavour is a lot better than Aiz's lean flavour. <br><br>As to what ice cream names Ben &amp; Jerry's Ice Cream company would give to ice creams made from Aiz or Hestia's goodness, I don't know.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best outfit</br>  <br>Well in anime the regen is still fully intact and full powered. So bell did one shot goliath to the half his body with its regen ability still strong.</br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>   Zeus is his grandfather <br> I'm so special <br><br>Dropped.</br></br></br>  <br>No, bell is stronger. This charge was not argonout. It's far stronger. Argonout not even need Him stand still and doing passive move. No bell is never charging anything have you even seen the anime?</br>  <br>If only it was just a meme.</br>  I really hope cute MCs become the next big thing.  <br> Damn.. someone should shop a sparkle on his teeth. And then the Crest Toothpaste logo on the bottom. <br><br>It probably has been professionally done in japanese TV ads. Marketing may even insist on Bell having different types of big toothy smiles in various episodes to help the toothpaste marketing. Remember, Attack on Titan had such giant marketing that even bread shaped like titan footprints was marketed. Certainly, cleaning products were marketed due to Levi's cleaning habits.<br><br>It would be unbelievable to not have DanMachi toothpaste. I've already seen lots of toothpaste for everything from Sailor Moon to Totoro to My Little Pony. Franky Cola pepsi is allowed to have 1% alcohol in it to give it that Franky kick.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bell is still level 1 without argonaut and limit off and bell is not good fighting non monster because of his soft spot furthermore she is woman.</br>  <br> cute MCs <br><br>Oh please.<br><br>I believe I speak for everyone here when I say Bell-kun wasn't even that cute.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bell and Aiz both drink alcohol (ale?) at Mama's tavern style restaurant, so Bell must be old enough to drink.</br>  <br><br> bell is not good fighting non monster <br><br>The arc that would have taken place after the anime ended is Bell fighting other adventurers. As is the arc after that, he's fairly capable in both though that's after getting even more Aiz training.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He missed the core the real body because he doesn't know but when he knew it he one stab it. It's very large area attack but it's un aimed because the core is hidden.</br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>  <br>No, he is fighting it without any intention to kill. Like when he fought the hades head fighter. He doesn't use firebolt because he cannot control the damage and have big casualties</br>  <br> Attack eradicates the entire upper body down to the hips and exposes the gem, including the flesh on the opposite side of the gem from Bell. <br> A significant amount of the gem would've been in the path of Bell's attack <br> "Oh he didn't hit the gem with it" <br><br>Sure thing bro.<br><br>As retarded as that thought is, it's still more proof that Bell didn't one shot the Goliath.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's un aimed attack at very large area. It would have been different or one shot f it's more focused or consentrated attack at spesific area or target.</br>  What do you call a girl like this?  <br>He seemed not be pulling any punches during the Apollo duel, same with his big fight with Ishtar. He didn't want civilian casualties/damage, when he was running from Soma's group, but he'd still choose to use it in a pinch even though it cause property damage, and might have killed someone who couldn't flee from the now burning building.</br>  <br> Bell can aim and focus that attack <br> If it was more concentrated it would be more powerful <br> Flat-out making shit up to support your argument <br><br>Sure thing bro.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My waifu.</br>  <br>Perfect.</br>  <br>Of course he can control it. It's giant swing the core only got the damage from the far left corner attack not in the middke which is more powerful attack. Have you even seen the anime?</br>  <br> seasonal waifu <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>He has soft spot like it's shown also in the latest episode</br>  If someone is interested.<br>Lossless creditless OP - https://mega.nz/#!7E0HTB7D!YC2yufSp<wbr>gylNmf3GrgAhZ7RsETDqoaKih2sJ6TQlBLk<wbr><br>Lossless creditless ED - https://mega.nz/#!KZUEBYZJ!DzahHwgu<wbr>2tq5nncbeFq53xlbWjiWI-QmzBnVmL-QK9E<wbr><br><br>I'm also uploading the first 2 episodes, single file, but it will take at last another 8 hours.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Find me one scene that shows the Goliath "only got the damage from the far left corner attack.<br><br>Find me one line that says "the middke which is more powerful attack".<br><br>Find me anything that says or shows Bell could've focused that attack to do more damage.<br><br>You have the episode, so go get some pictures and quotes that support your argument and come back.<br><br>Otherwise, kindly shut the fuck up with your retarded assumptions and broken english.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone make a stitch of this shot yet? It seemed like a good moment for it IMO, what with the full frontal panty (leotard?) shot and slight underboob.    <br>Thanks bro</br>  <br>waiting a while to say that newfag?</br>  <br>That's a badass elf.</br>  <br><br>It's a shame this beauty is a dyke.<br>Am I the only one upset here?</br></br></br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>  <br><br><br>Now in the sky, above a distant forest,<br>O Infinite stars, scattered across the cloudless night sky,<br>grant my foolish voice the blessing of starfire,<br>and grant your compassion to those who abandon you.<br><br>Bear within thee the light of stardust<br>and destroy my enemy!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>    <br>So wait, I'm reading the manga, and so part of the reason she likes Bell is because she has huge daddy issues. I mean sure she relates to Bell because she was in a similar situation to him, but you can't deny the fact that her Father looks exactly like him as well.</br>  <br>It's a futile effort to discuss any sort of settings with the Brazilian fanfictions in these threads. If Oratoria get announced, we'll be rid of them cause they're all Hestia fags.</br>  <br>I'm slowly beginning to understand this, and I wish someone had told me sooner.</br>  <br><br>It's a shame Aiz is going to lose to these literal goddesses.</br></br>  So guys is Ryu like one of the top fighter or something?<br>She is way too op.</br>  <br>She's Level 4, so she's stronger than most, but not crazy OP like the First-Class Adventurers.</br>  <br><br> Best Girl always loses.</br></br>  <br>Wait are they blood related or something?</br>  <br><br>I just see two of them.</br></br>  Season 2 when?<br><br> They can't end it like that, r-right? </br></br>  <br><br>I would not be surprised if that was revealed at some point, considering that they both lost their parents suddenly, and Aiz is probably just enough older to be able to remember her parents while Bell was probably too young. Also considering that she suppressed her memories until she saw Bell, who reminded her of her Father, It could be that she doesn't have any memories of a younger brother who was separated from her at an early age. It would be pretty fucked up if she was inducted into the Familia that helped murder her parents though.<br><br>That would also be an adequate pretext for Best Girl not winning.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Considering season 1 sold like shit, 2ch hated it, and JC Staff's investors are jumping ship, I think it's safe to say season 2 never.</br></br>  <br><br>Read the thread </br></br>  <br>Damn, it's not a great anime but I've had a lot of fun watching it and want to see where the story goes.</br>  <br>You know that a copypasta troll post right?</br>  <br>So where did you get that info from?</br>  How do Hestia fags feel about their character inevitably losing to Vanilla?  <br>https://archive.moe/a/search/text/i<wbr>nvestors%20jumping%20ship/<br>Just some of the variations.</br></wbr></br>  <br><br>Vanilla is probably Bunny's long lost sister though.</br></br>  <br> this fanbase is so obnoxious that they reply to pasta and ask for sauce </br>  <br> This fag replies about fags that reply about pastas <br><br>Come on man.</br></br></br>  <br> 2ch <br>Their opinion is about as relevant as /a/'s when it comes to sales.</br></br>  Is she and the shota the only ones in the guild who like Bete?  <br>She gives furfag his puss allowance, so he has to listen to her</br>  <br>Hestia is working 3 part time jobs for her Bell-kun.

I can go back and pick out screenshots illustrating every single thing I state here.<br><br>He did not one-shot the Goliath. There's no evidence it's some sort of retarded wide-angle bullet or arrow type attack (wide-angle arrows lol). There's no evidence that that particular attack could be focused to target a specific area. There's no evidence that focusing it on a smaller area would increase its damage. There's no evidence that even it it could focus on a smaller area to increase its damage, that it would've killed the Goliath outright.<br><br> If it's a blast or shoot <br><br>I'm glad you used "if", because it shows you're coming to terms with the fact that all of those retarded theories are pure fantasy and not at all what was shown in the episode.<br><br>The only good thing to come of this show ending is retards like you won't pop in to ruin threads with absolutely idiotic theories based off of fanwank and opinion.<br><br>Now, unless you can show up with any sort of proof other than more retarded opinions, please kindly keep your stupid to yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they made him use the dagger just because it was hestia dagger. ive read the LN 3 times and its not there<br><br>https://michinium.wordpress.com/201<wbr>5/03/03/danmachi-volume-2-4-pdfs/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>This post is relevant to you <br> The guy you're responding to is one of those people who thinks the translation is more accurate than the raw. </br></br>  Wish this was longer. <br><br>I'm getting post-anime depression.</br></br>  <br>Man, I'd be pissed too if I missed a fight like that.</br>    <br>same, the summer list is looking bad also</br>    <br><br>The newfags edge.</br></br>    <br>The targeted area mean the focused area.

Makes sense to me.</br></br></br>  <br>He have fought it once. He will have known it the next time he fought it.</br>  <br> he didnt watch youtube of other people beating him <br><br>fuking noob</br></br></br>  <br>That it's the pattern of the skill in the anime. His hand glow if it's magic or firebolt. His weapon glow usually his peak if it skill attack.</br>  So who is the strongest in the danmschi world and if ranked which ranking would Bell belong to?<br><br>Low tier<br>Mid ter<br>High tier</br></br></br></br>  <br>High tier because he is able to one shot goliath if it's not because he has not known the location of the core.</br>  <br>Mid tier</br>  <br>Boipussy tier</br>  How far bell's level now ? For single minded pursuit user his growth is not quick enough.  So, even with all those high level experienced adventurers there, only Bell could destroy the monster. Why not just suck his dick? Fuck this shitty story.  <br>He has rare skill items and zeus grandson.</br>  <br>So, he's basically a gary stu? I knew it.</br>  <br>Away being Her Goddessly self. Relying on Her "Hero". <br><br>Besides, if She DID join in it wouldn't have even lasted long enough for an entire Episode.</br></br></br>  <br>The ln pacing is quite slow to confirm that.</br>  <br>The problem here is not her chest bat her manshoulder.</br>  <br>Anime did a piss poor job at showing the contribution of the higher level adventurers and even welf crozzo's...<br>IT was a good anime up to the ending where they somehow had to shoehorn bell doing "what seemed like" a one-hit ko followed up by a tap.</br></br>  <br>Even before that Bell was destroying higher level monsters himself.</br>  <br>Nah, him destroying the higher level minotaur had tension and he obviously had extreme difficulty killing it. That was a really good fight wherein he was not gary-stu at all.</br>  <br>It was and it still is. Stop defending shit when it's shit.</br>  <br>Look anon, we share the same dislike of the final episode but you are just raging uncontrollably here if you cant appreciate the minotaur fight for what it is; a well choreographed fight scene of a boy who wanted to be a hero against a foe greater than himself.<br><br>The fight had him getting beat up and be in excruciating pain. Destroy his armor, break his spirit yet even against this odd he stood up and he pondered a thought "how to defeat the minotaur".<br>Up to that point he was being trained by Aiz and learned how to counter attack. He was honing his skills from grinding mobs. He got magic from an old book and he had the blessing of his goddess in form of a really good knife.<br>He accepted that he was a coward and that is good. Not getting hit is better than being stupidly heroic.<br>He knew that every slicing attack he did with the knife was not enough to pierce the minotaur's hide; his firebolts were not enough to put a dent into the minotaur.<br>He had the knowledge from lili that larger weapons are better against larger foes.<br><br>With all these he then put things in motion by:<br>Disarming the minotaur<br>Using it;s own large weapon agaisnt it to create cuts and openings where he can land his knife better,<br>Stage a fake bull rush attack into a counter into the belly of the beast.<br>And with his weak magic, BURST the ever living crap out of the minotaur from inside out.<br><br>It did not matter how much mana he had left, he had to do it at that moment and he did till his mind went numb!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nerf Argonaut</br>  <br>Sucking ma dick</br>  <br>Ottarl has:<br>Boars' Blood- health passively regen<br>Achilles Heel- can't be damaged unless damage at one region<br>Divine Devotion- immunity to all magic damage<br>Goddess' Protege- Self level boost</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he's level 2</br>  <br>we dont know when ottar got those skills, how about if he had achilles heel at lvl 2?</br>  <br> comparing end-game skills to a level-2 skill </br>  <br>what if he had those skills at level 4-5? <br>I can speculate too</br></br>  <br>That immunity. I hope is fake or mistranslation. Immunity is skill for god not human</br>  <br>Tiona<br>Berserk : Strength rises every time the user takes damage<br>Intense Heat :Raises the strength of all abilities in a pinch <br><br>Tiona<br>Berserk : Strength rises every time the user takes damage<br>Backdraft :Raises the power of the user exceptionally high in a pinch</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>none of which would help either to destroy a Level 5 monster at level 2</br>  <br>The thing is he shouldn't be able to do stuff like that yet but he does it anyway. My suspension of disbelief went away when his attack actually manage to hurt the minotaur.</br>  <br>This is weak in comparable.</br>  <br>B-but it's a skill.</br>  <br>Not really OP, they could before boosting themselves to ridiculous levels</br>  <br><br>Unless your Spartacus with EX level in endurance</br></br>  Can we all agree that the Hestiafag producer ruined most of the show  Riveria Ljos Alf <br>Rea Laevateinn : Wide area annihilation Magic<br>Wynn Fimbulvetr: Extreme cold Magic that is said to be able to even freeze time <br>Veil Breath :Green Protection Magic that raises defense against physical and magical attacks<br>Via Shilheim : Barrier Magic that completely blocks physical and magical attacks <br><br>so she has magic that makes her immune to physical and magical attacks<br><br>not that she is a going to judge your shit skills or anything</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rises strength after takes damage losing sanity and taking damage mean less hp.

Unless you think that Bell is a half god, it isn't unique to them.</br></br>  <br>Block mean you still receiving damage.</br>  <br>how come the other elves dont have it then?</br>  <br>Because when they can have those skills doesn't mean they will have those skills. Maybe there are other broken skills that other elves have.</br>  <br>He was never described as similar to him and she never thought that, it's only manga readers forcing that idea. She thinks of her dad and mom because their death/disappearance changed her world, not because Bell looks like him. Bell reminds her of her younger self.</br>  <br>Bell is level 2 and level 3 in the last volume so mid tier. Ottarl is the strongest, Ais second, Finn is probably third, Riveria, Gareth are level 6 as well and there is Allen and two elves level 6 in Freya familia, Bete, the twin amazons, the four gulliver brothers, Tsubaki, Phryune are level 5.</br>  <br> it's only manga readers forcing that idea <br>I mean they do look alike. Aiz not noticing/commenting on such a similarity may be proof that in universe it's not true. However, she could just not be thinking about it since she is an airhead after all, and in to some extent it could explain her fondness for Bell, that she might not be aware of. Though I'll readily admit that the only base of this speculation is that the two characters have similar hair, and as such her dad looks like an older bell.</br></br>  <br>How would Bell, who doesn't look like her at all reminds her of herself but not her father if they are so similar? Especially when she was a daddy girl, it doesn't make sense. The time she compared the two was when he beat the minotaur, thinking that he had the right to be a hero, like her dad, there's no mention of resemblance and it's in a series where Revis noted that Ais looked like her mom and called her Aria, in the LN itself there's no such thing.</br>  <br>He is.<br>He acts like a shy anime girl love interest.</br></br>  <br> How would Bell, who doesn't look like her at all reminds her of herself but not her father if they are so similar? <br>She's dense, and could just not be drawing the conclusions. That's to say that I don't think it would be farfetched if she didn't think about visual similarities in their features that are apparent at least in the manga depiction of her father.<br><br> That said it's just speculation, valid as speculation until we actually know who both of their parents were, and know they weren't the same people.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Valid as a speculation yes, but she never thought or mentioned that they looked similar so it changes everything when someone post this so <br> is definitely wrong. Ais not thinking about resemblance with him while looking at him and seeing him so many times is ridiculous even tough she's an airhead and it's not like her mentors Finn, Riveria and Gareth didn't know her parents as well, yet they never thought of a resemblance. It's a theory born from visual pictures of the manga, heck, is face is not even seen in the manga and yet he's supposed to look exactly like him.</br></br>  <br> Finn, Riveria and Gareth ... never thought of a resemblance <br>We don't know that. We only know that they've never commented on such a resemblance. It's entirely possible they didn't consider it, due to it being outside of their expectations. Another possibility is for whatever reason didn't want to comment on it, but did notice a resemblance. It can't really be definitively settled as speculation until we know who Bells parents were.<br><br> Them having the same parents would mean that Aiz's friends were keeping that Loki familia/Loki are/is responsible for their deaths from her, and it stands to reason that that they wouldn't want her to know that if such a thing is the case.<br><br>There's really not enough information to make much of an assertion either way, and the only information we have is a similarity in hair style, and a assumed similarity in hair color, and other features. I concede that that's not solid enough information, and I'd really like a color depiction of her father, but it does make for interesting speculation, and speculation that can't definitively be disproven, at least not yet anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   take a liking to jealous background yuri crush elf character <br> take up Sword Oratoria because Berserk Amazons  <br> turns out Lesfiya is a major character <br>PRAISE THE GODS!</br></br></br>  <br>Riveria and Finn at the very least know about both her parents. It's a speculation that can't be disproved but which is weak to begin with. Ais not thinking about resemblance coz she's an airhead despite all these scenes is beyond ridiculous, there's no mention of resemblance in the LN. Loki made Zeus familia quit Orario so she wouldn't be able to take Ais, unless it was in some rules, everything points out that her dad died facing Ziz.</br>  <br>Cute elf girl is cute.</br>  <br><br>Can you explain me why do you ave that yurishit elf as a fav? I understand that you can like her, but as a fav? She has some of Bell character in her but the rest make her extremely annoying, the only good thing about her is her magic.</br></br>  I wish I could capture Riveria and hatefuck her until she breeds a smaller army of half elves.  Why is Loki such a best everything?  <br>They can change the staff though, it's the same for Raildex animes.</br>  <br>I'd give her a ride too.</br>  Nice view. They just couldn't finish without it I guess. Not that I'm complaining.   kek   <br>Those bountiful mamaries</br>  <br>They're bigger than beru's head</br>  Would you?  <br><br><br>How can anyone hate Hestia?</br></br></br>  <br>He already gains levels more than ten times the rate of everyone else.<br><br>He got to level 2 in 6 weeks, while the record beforehand was a fucking year. Who knows how slow is the average rate.</br></br></br>  <br>She should be universally loved because she has a nice body? If you are a Hestiafag you're a pretty bad one. She has a nice body, her character is shit.</br>  <br>Thanks anon.</br>  <br>Liking Lefiya's bait post, just like people liking Kuroko.</br>  <br>Kuroko at least isn't as useless. The better answer would be being into /u/</br>  <br>6 weeks compared to 1 year is not 1 : 10.</br>  <br>Lefiya isn't useless either. She's a mobile artillery as of Volume 4, she is actually useful even in Floor 59, which I don't think Bell is yet.  She's still annoying as fuck though. </br>  <br>Fine, 8.6 times. Happy?</br>  <br>Not him 1 year was the record, they take normally more than 1 year. And I think it took him 2 months not 6 weeks, I could be wrong though.</br>  <br>Does she use anything other than magic now? Like fight with her staff or hand to hand? Are there elves other than Ryu who do that?</br>  <br>Loki is a guy, you know?</br>  Why is the spinoff more interesting than the main story?      <br>It's actually fun to watch OP people being OP.</br>    <br>The murder and crime things really intrigues mes</br>  <br>The cutest.</br>  <br> loki <br> cute <br><br>gay.</br></br></br></br>  Whats with the levels in this anime anyway? When Bell &amp; Crew arrived on the save floor it did not look like Aiz and her party had any trouble fuckin up the floor boss. If the other half of her party is close to the same level as hers (lvl 6), why did they have problems with a, even somehow powered up, lvl 5 floor boss? They even had help from the elf and andromeda, and I'm sure they are atleast Aiz level too.  <br>Aiz party had no trouble beating Goliath. The dungeon spawned an OP Goliath because of Hestia divine power, Loki familia had already gone. Ryu and Asufi are not even close Aiz level, they are level 4, they don't even compare to the level 5s. If Ryu had her status updated she would be level 5 though.</br>  <br>thanks, it seems the difference of a single level is realy big then.</br>  <br>Very big.</br>  <br><br>All magics are unique to the caster, there is no skill lister here. Riveria is an anomaly who can use more than three magics, she is an heroic vessel, and the strongest mage of Orario, author didn't reveal her status but she has a a rare development ability which works like mind potion and reduce the amount of mana her magics take, at full power, mana can't ever be depleted, it's very rare and an ability any high level magic users dream to have, and <br>Aiz got it when she became level 6.</br></br></br>  <br>listed*</br>  <br>Strawberries and Cream</br>  <br>doing cute and autistic things on the surface.</br>  <br>Lefiya right now has<br>1 super long cast aoe ice spell<br>1 super short cast shield<br>1 long (?) aoe fire<br>1 short auto-homing nuke<br>Can cast while moving.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>those tights...</br>  <br> The dungeon spawned an OP Goliath because of Hestia <br>Is this speculation or proven?<br><br>Also, what was that limit?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>It's weird because the other adventurer like aiz already level 6 in such young age so he is not special.</br>  <br>Proven<br>Argonaut charged to the max<br><br>Aiz started raiding dungeons at 7.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably bell is demi god he can glow like hestia.</br>  <br>Aiz is sepcial, don't think anyone can become adventurer at 7, survive and even break the record.<br><br>He is human, his two parents were human, Zeus only adopted him. He was using Argonaut at full power.</br></br></br>  <br>It's because the main story is literally Sword Art Offline.</br>  <br> dropped after watching the whole series. <br>I don't think you know what you're talking about, anon</br></br>  <br><br>Argonout never make your whole body emit light. Skill attack only make his tip weapon emit light and nothing else. This skill change his body color to light</br></br>  <br>Argonaut at max = citation needed. Argonaut is not making limit off skill.</br>  <br>All floor bosses are called 迷宮の刺客 in the Web Version (刺客 = assassin) instead of 迷宮の孤王 in the Bunko Version. People speculated these "special monsters" are given birth out of the hatred from the Dungeon for the Deities' suppression. This is why Deities are forbidden to go in, because it would cause all kind of irregular event and spawn uber bosses.</br>  <br>I got raided by my dad at age 7 as well ;_;</br>  <br>Her friends mostly young too.</br>  <br> The thing is he shouldn't be able to do stuff like that yet but he does it anyway <br>Why shouldn't he? The feat of defeating a higher level monster is pretty much how most adventurers level up. And there's only a difference of one level, so it's not all that special.</br></br>  <br>All I am, saying is Vanilla with chocolate sauce covering her is my fetish...</br>  <br>All her friends also at that age. So she is not special.</br>  <br>Goliath is floor boss and rare level 5. Red minotour is much stronger minotour so mostly level 3. So at level 2 bell already defeated level 5 goliath with his regen still strong.</br>  Ranking of females who want Bell's wee wee:<br><br>1. Hestia (Obvious first place);<br>2. Freya (She can even have a orgasm just watching Bell);<br>3. Lili ("Bell-sama");<br>4. Eina (The "date" and that hug at the ending credits... she totally wants his dick);<br>5. Syr (She even confess but Bell doesn't believe in his own luck);<br><br>About Aiz i don't know but taking in account Sword Oratoria she likes him too. I want to see more of her in the future second season.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Can Bell resist this literal sex goddess?</br></br>   Aiz wants to be the strongest <br> her whole existence is about getting stronger <br> Bell has a bullshit power that lets him level up rapidly <br>Do Japs just hate the concept of hard work?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah he can. That's what Realis Phrase is for. Bell's libido for Ais makes him immune to all other Charm effects.</br>  <br>too old</br>  <br> too old <br><br>You're think of Hephaestus.<br><br>I believe I speak for everyone here when I say Hephaestus is too old to be attractive. She's like 35.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is the Web Novel further along?</br>  <br>He just kid he is immune because he is pure and doesn't know about sex because ishtat is god of sex. Her power of charm is not that special because he also got rejected in myth.</br>  <br> Lili <br>Takes a fucking super drug that mindbreaks everyone who has ever had it, and fucking retains only her undying love for bell winning soma's favor, and helping bell. Nobody probably loves bell more than lili.</br></br>  <br>She. Isthar charm works with horny people she is rejected by warrior.</br>  <br>Aiz is looking for a hero stronger than her ready to save her.</br>  <br>Hestia is bottom tier.</br>  <br><br>The same idiot again, Argonaut emits light, it was at full power so the effects were bigger. It is a charging move, and he charged it at the limit, which is 3 minutes.</br></br>  <br> Bell has a bullshit power that lets him level up rapidly <br> gets nerf so hard in vol 8 because gotta pander and throw a bone for hestia. </br></br>  <br>LN surpassed it long ago.<br><br> Eina <br>No.<br> About Aiz i don't know but taking in account Sword Oratoria she likes him too. I want to see more of her in the future second season. <br>Not yet.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please fuck off and go away idiot newfag.</br>  <br>Charm is the same for every beauty goddess, Freya is more powerful though. It works on everyone, even gods, she charmed adventurers with it. Bell is immune because Realis Phrase completely stops Charm.</br>  <br> Eina <br> No. <br><br>...</br></br></br></br>  Does being Bete ever stop being suffering?  <br> Embarrassment=/=love <br>She doesn't love him. Bell is blushing too, do you think he loves her? No. Hestia, Freya, Lili, Syr and Haruhime are part of his harem, Eina is not.</br></br>  <br>You are wrong. The myth and the logic prove it. Ishtar more of god of sex than beauty. Bell is still underage that doesn't know sex. Ishtar got rejected by warrior so she is rejected too by bell cranel.</br>  <br>That armor design is so stupid. If someone landed a thrust anywhere on her upper body, the metal boob socks and throat piece would literally guide the blade into her throat instead of a less harmful part of her body. All of her vital organs and main arteries are completely exposed. The only thing she's being protected from is getting her nips pinched and tripping and falling over on her knees.</br>  <br><br> people actually find this half-breed attractive <br><br>why</br></br></br></br>  <br>He gets friendly with Bell and even help him when Hyacinthus was trashing Bell by telling them to fuck off.</br>  <br>In your myth Hestia is a loli goddess? Hephaestus is female? This is not IRL mythos, Danmachi has its own set of rules. Ishtar and Freya are both beauty goddess with the same Charm ability, but Ishtar owns the red district with all the prostitutes.</br>  <br>It's fantasy armor. It doesn't have to be practical to be effective. If you can't stomach shit like this in fiction you're better off watching Knights Templar documentaries on Discovery</br>  <br>It goes beyond simply impractical though. Being unarmored would be more protective than this shit.<br><br>I can deal with all the completely unarmored people in this show. But that stupid boobplate, what the fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>So he acknowledges his inner cuck</br>  <br>She actually doesn't need armor. Loki tricked her because she wanted her to wear this. Aiz used her Ariel for offense and defense.<br><br>That's a new one.</br></br></br>    <br><br>Why? Really?</br></br>  <br> It goes beyond simply impractical though <br>You're watching a wish fulfillment fantasy almost harem with people that have changing stat sheets on their backs, gods walking among them and a guy with HACKS that can kill almost anything and you complain about one fucked up breastplate?<br>Really?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes, sure...</br></br>  <br>She's responsible for him, was worried about him, and was relieved that he hadn't died.</br>  <br><br>So... that means they fucked, right?</br></br>  This show gives me a really bad case of not giving a fuck about Hestia and Bell and wanting to know more about the other characters.<br> More spin-offs when? <br><br>Is Hestia this fucking annoying in the written works? I didn't bother since I was already looking up the spin-off</br></br></br>  <br>It's seems that you're new over here.</br>  <br>Cant blame Eina<br><br>Every adventurer under her care often dies and Bell is like a little brother to her and is protective and is bias when it comes to anyone under her care.</br></br></br>  So how many months will it take for this shitty LN to be forgotten after the anime ends?<br><br>I say... two.</br></br>  <br><br> Hug=love <br>Seriously? Don't you know someone of the opposite sex, or even of the same sex can hug you if that person was worried? Because she did it it means she's in love with him? Are you retarded? Or just an anon with an horrible social life?</br></br></br>  <br>They toned down Hestia's annoying behaviour a lot especially in the first episodes. She's a little shit. In the spinoff there are more about the other familias as well, more teamwork, like with Hermes familia, Dyonisus etc.</br>  <br> quickmeme.com <br>Fuck off</br></br>  <br> quickmeme.com <br><br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br>  Lili a cute.  <br>The fuck? You mean to tell me this shit is toned down?<br>Fucking hell, why do authors think this is a good thing?<br><br>Oh well, but I do like the other familias more, guess I'll just focus on that shit since from what I seen it goes into the main story for all the important shit I need to know.</br></br></br></br>  <br>sick meme dud</br>  <br>Hestia is so shit in the wrtten works<br><br>Her appearances is just going with the same jealous tone every time that its annoying as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>He is loli because her cult is small in greek. Hephaestus female it's just because hephaestus born from goddess without any male counterpart. And god gender is not problem in danmachi because god can shapeshift and this is not only contain greek god/ goddess but in many myth and cult where gender of god is not clear too .</br>  <br>game of thrones threads are on /tv/</br>  <br>unfortunately, it's hot shit right now</br>  <br>It shows part of the main story when he and Ais interacts so it's not everything and lately, author is showing Ais less and less in the main story and it slows down Bell's growth RP is better when he's with her. Bell's party is starting to work more with other familias though, mainly Takemikazuchi since the gods are good friends.</br>  <br>Gender is matter only in greek in other cult or religion he god itself often has no fixed gender</br>  <br>Eh, I do wanna learn about those guys but fuck. I can't take it anymore, it's too forced at this point, and the worst part is that they'll probably fuck at the end of this because that's always how it goes.<br><br>Chances are Aiz will hear about whatever big shit he goes through anyways, so I doubt I'll miss much.</br></br></br>  <br><br>In this LN they have genders and they can't change it. Don't apply IRL myth to this, can't you understand that it's different?</br></br>  <br>Extremely.</br>  <br> quickmeme.com <br><br>You're trying to fit here really hard don't you?</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's just MY opinion, anon.</br></br>  <br><br>I just masturbate pretty hard so I need to rest for a while.</br></br>  <br>OL ass</br>  <br> ur <br> u </br></br>  <br>she wants to sit on your face</br>  <br>This is the most cringy post I've seen in a while.</br>  <br><br>Fuck adventuring.

Thank you.</br>  <br><br>Why does Syr just fuck Bell-kun against his will?</br></br>    What a fag.  <br><br>Doesn't the leader of Aiz's group fall in love with her or something? and then tries to kill Bell to get her?</br></br>  <br>No. He proposed because he wants Prum children nothing more.

The plane scene with them taking a picture together really hammered that in. It's more like genuine curiosity now.

Is that all of them?</br>  <br><br>I will never get over how cute this is.</br></br>  <br><br> Papi isn't retarded. <br><br>That's pretty debatable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>When is going to air the ATX version?</br>  <br><br> Animated-Miia actually has the proper amount of length and mass to her tail. </br></br>  <br>From July 7, every Tuesday 24: 30 ~ repeat broadcast: every Thursday 4:30 p.m. to 17:00 　　　　　　　every Sunday 20:30 to 21:00 　　　　　　　every Monday 8:30 to 09:00</br>  <br>GET HYPE</br>  <br>Miia best cuddler</br>  <br>Can't wait for animeonlyfags and people claiming waifus to start flooding the threads.</br>  <br><br>We've waited so long for this day, someone to take the pain away. No fan will ever have to say, we'll never get an anime!</br></br>  S2 over, no OVAs announced, Vol.11 completely spoiled.<br><br>Though there may be no new content for a while we know our hero will return  someday .</br></br>  <br> implying shs's not a nice grill </br>  <br><br>Not the one you are responding to.<br><br>  she's barely done any merit to win <br>Is it really a matter of winning? I mean Hachiman is going to get with the girl who he loves or is drawn to the most. That being based on how Wataru writes him. That might not be a girl who has worked the hardest to win his affections. Things just aren't necessarily fair that way.<br><br>I still think it's going to be Yukino because in regards to the narrative it still feels to me at least that this entire series has been about driving Yukino and Hachiman together. Even Yui, at her finest such as at the end of vol 11, is only serving as a bridge between her best friend and her love.<br><br>The one who is going to win isn't necessarily the one who "looks the best" from the perspective of readers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Once the animefags stop posting we'll have those old threads back</br>  <br>That's not genuine buddy, that's not even love.<br><br>That's pity and starting a relationship off of that isn't a good thing.</br></br></br>  <br>He loves them both. He knows having both is impossible (harems are things of fantasy). That's exactly why he says "in the end I'll be left with nothing" if he keeps chasing what he wants. Because he doesn't want to choose.<br><br>That implies he is able to genuinely love either of them, which is why he cannot pick one. But should he pick one for another reason, that doesn't mean he can't love them truly. Does this make sense to you too?</br></br></br>  Who has the best legs in anime, /a/?<br><br> Don't bother answering, because pic related is clearly the only correct choice </br></br>  thighura  <br>Nice fanart, faggot</br>  <br>No. Magi is worth watching for Best Mom.</br>  <br>steins;gate art style is too skinny</br>  The only reason I watched the shit show.
