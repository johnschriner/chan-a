For an example, the mighty jingles.  <br>That's because for some reason in USA, Katyusha has copyright on it in, so they would have to pay for the rights who ever owns it.</br>  <br>thanks america</br>  <br>Everyone can appreciate a fun underdog story.</br>  <br>Well it is a 64 player game with lots of vehicles, though I don't really find the HUD as bad as BF3, and you can edit the hud now.</br>  <br>Because in the USA, all former CCCP copyrights were not recognised. And when the cold war ended, some fuckwit allowed someone to copyright those songs in the USA even if they were public domain in their country of origin AND they were not the authors.<br>And if you think that's stupid, have a polite reminder that the lyrics of "Happy Birthday To You" are NOT in the public domain in the USA. Google it.</br></br>    <br> watching the dub <br>it's your own fault, faggot.</br></br>  <br>I couldn't even make it though the first episode of the dub.

If someone wanted to play a commie song, they would have to get permission from the copyright holder, and the copyright holder would never give them permission.</br>  <br>Illiteracy</br>  <br>And that (which can easily be verified with a simple google search), my friend, is the reason the Japanese guys right flat out refused to deal with that people to "license" a public domain song for the US release of GuP. So Sentai had to go with the Tetris song instead (which is actually a public domain Russian folk song about a girl named Katyusha, too,, so give them a little break; for ONCE they're not the bad guys for their horrible release).<br><br> I'm just waiting for an English (as in, UK) dub to be made without that "fake copyright" nonsense </br></br></br>  <br>Now I'm kinda afraid of such laws shoved into my throat if TPP comes into effect.<br>I want to get off this nightmare.</br></br>  <br>Jingels is an old pedo creep, of course he is into anime.</br>  <br> surfaces devoted to trees and buildings <br> not growing crops </br></br>  <br>Or blindness.<br>Seriously, my wfe is blind and can't watch subsbed anime with me, and when she heard teh dub, she refused to keep watching it. <br>This particular dub is as terrible as a few selected ones are legendary. Did you know, the French dub of Porco Rosso is so good, Miyazaki (the very author) retconed it as the new original? Well, if there are isolated examples of dubs THAt good, there has to be isolated examples of dubs simetricaly bad; and GuP"s is that one.</br></br></br>  <br>shutup nerd</br>  <br>that guy has a sick GuP collection.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=s97<wbr>tRKvpdSo</wbr>  [ ]<br>I can just imagine all the guys who are on here thinking "who the fuck is jingles?"</br></br></br>  <br> hasn't watched OVA 3 </br>  best girl  The best part about this show was the uncomfortable glee my imouto displayed while watching it.

I do other NEET activities; like working out.</br>  <br><br>Was a pragmatic suggestion in universe. I wish they'd have explored the relation in the monster realm about slimes and other non-humans or non-demi-humans and how they're perceived. It seems like slimes are treated as no different than dumb animals there.</br></br>  I wonder what centaur tastes like.<br><br>Also I had a dream where harpies were treated like wild animals and people would hunt them for food and cook only the human torso part.<br><br>The problem is some poachers and really bad people would mix in actual human torsos in the harpy meat supply and no one could tell the difference. It was considered a good way to cover up a murder.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's so disappointing that you can't fondle her breasts and enter her at the same time.

Just like they would with a human woman.</br></br>  <br><br>How does she wipe her ass when she shits?</br></br>  <br>It would be the same shit. Literally the same shit, nothing would be different other than HOW they hurt Darling.  It would have to take place somewhere like Saudi Arabia though, so the women would have to go outside accompanied by Darling or a male escort. </br>  is there a translation for the slime species screen yet?<br><br><br>No, go fuck yourself, there are literally a thousand shows like that already.</br></br></br>  <br> that baby horse <br>you have no one to blame but yourself.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, check the archive for previous threads. I saw one around 2PM pacific I think.</br>  <br>found it quick, thanks</br>  <br>Some of them genuinely look like a brown girl's breasts, but really hairy and with extremely long nipples. It's fucking nightmarish.<br><br>Cerea, I'm sorry.</br></br></br>  <br> Some of them genuinely look like a brown girl's breasts, but...with extremely long nipples. <br><br>What part of this sounds bad?</br></br></br>  <br>Are you doing this to flare my autism?</br>  <br>holy fuck, pink slime please</br>  <br>yes they are disgusting,but<br> lay eggs </br></br>  <br>puffy pussy</br>  <br> that thumb <br>Hang on. I don't understand her anatomy. <br>Are harpies part bird, or do they have bat wings, but with feathers?</br></br></br>  <br>More like pseudo-hands. She's got a thumb of sorts, and can grip things, but she doesn't have a proper hand.</br>  <br>Artist was shit. I don't imagine he intended for them to function like mittens, but that's what they are now.</br>    <br><br>I feel like Centaur's Worries had a much less disgusting explanation for this.</br></br>  Cerea Worries crossover when?!  <br>How's a magic sphincter disgusting. People would pay money to have one genetically added</br>  <br>I more meant that the explanation itself was grossing me the fuck out, not the fact that it's a sphincter that works really well.</br>  <br>Maybe when CW becomes poplar<br>i.e. never</br></br>  <br>mmm, pulsating overlapping sphincter control</br>  <br> Artist was shit. I don't imagine he intended for them to function like mittens, but that's what they are now. <br>In the end the decision was to let Papi grasp things. Having characters with no legs is one thing, but no hands is another matter that would cause difficulties.</br></br>  <br>she's a Deep One. gotta go Deep</br>  <br>  ;___;  </br>  How does Cereal wipe her ass?  <br>Much better now.</br>  <br>With a clean cloth, and a stick.</br>  <br>Hi, /co/  or possibly /v/. </br>  <br>Did you read/watch the manga/anime? Cerea said it herself.</br>    <br>dolphins are still better</br>  <br>I'm team Miia, but Cerea's not a bad choice. <br><br>Also, if the BR/DVD doesn't have that goddamn shedding scene (or if it doesn't magically appear in the next episode or as an extra or something) I'm petitioning another goddamn Fatman be dropped on those fucking Nips.</br></br></br>  <br>please enlighten a non-mangafag fellow anon, what is the shedding scene</br>  <br> Miia burns her hand while trying to cook a meal for darling. Because of this, she can't shed her skin on her own which is a very personal act for a Lamia, especially when you recall that stimulating the tip of her tail can make her orgasm. Darling helps her out and everything is going okay until he remembers he has to remove the skin near her vagoo. Miia becomes more embarrassed and uses her tail to keep Darling from seeing her sensitive spot. This leads to Darling accidentally fingering her, prompting a shocked Miia to involuntarily snap Darling's neck. </br>  <br>  Read the manga.  </br>  <br>So you'd never do anal?</br>  <br>I'd a Cerea ass.</br>  <br>rip darling. any chance you know what chapter it is?</br>  <br>On the contrary, I'd pound that flank like there's no tomorrow.</br>  <br>nvm found it</br>  <br>It's been a while, but it's one of the earlier ones, like right around or before they meet Suu.</br>  <br> that music that played when suu was introduced </br>  <br>Well that explains Wales</br>  <br>And New Zealand.</br>  <br> Nice! <br>Crab is too based.</br></br>  <br>They need that scene to explain Miia's shedded skin that she kept in the laying egg chapter though.<br>But who knows, maybe they'll skip that part too.</br></br>  <br><br><br>I bet her reactions to her first asspounding would be both delicious and cute.</br></br></br>  <br>All I know is that Mero would be best girl either way.</br>  Rachnee being drunk of caffeine is a confirmed biological fact right? Are spiders really supposed to get wasted on the stuff?  <br>Can you guys stop? There's way too much blood rushing to my dick right now.</br>  <br>what about shark grills</br>  <br>qt sharks are great.</br>  <br>All?</br>  <br>fag.</br>  <br>How much do I have to pay to get a finjob with her pelvic fins?</br>    <br>So Red, Green and Black Slimes are unfuckable? Why would anybody like a non pink or standard one.</br>  <br><br>Crab genuinely loves what he does.<br><br>Monster Musume may be ecchi harem shit of the most obvious variety, but it's a labor of love and every panel shows it.</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  monster girls are disgusting  <br>no u</br>  <br>Not really look at the art from the first few chapters where hewent all out and compare them to the most recent ones. Not only did he get lazy as he went on but he also hasn't improved much at all since his webcomic days.</br>  <br>LSD is surprisingly good.</br>  <br> They breathe water through their gills. <br>At least do your research crabman</br></br>    <br>He's probably just some up his own ass prick that can't eat eggs because "where they come from". Fucking stupid.</br>  <br> what is couples yoga. </br>    <br>There's that one image on the boorus where Cerea and Hime bump tips, but that's about it.</br>  <br>BRB Gotta go to Kurusu's house to lend him a jetpack before shit's start going down with Murderfish</br>  <br>Imagining her facial expressions and grunts as you slowly bottom out in that huge rump, feeling your hips mashed against hers does that to me too.</br>  <br>fuck you, cunt. mares winking at you with their beautiful vaginas when they're in heat is a natural wonder of the world, and deserves to be respected</br>  <br>Not him, but not fond of assplay. Straight vanilla for me, while she repeatedly slams my balls with that winking clit.</br>  I haven't read the manga in ages. is there a werewolf yet?  <br>no.</br>  <br>well thats disappointing. someone get ahold of me when theres a cute wolf girl making awoos</br>  <br>There's a cute kobold girl if that tickles your fancy.</br>    <br>thats ok I guess.</br>  <br> mares winking at you with their beautiful vaginas <br> Natural wonder of the world <br>Not that i have anything against horse pussy and Cerea,but the "wonder of the world part" obliterated my sides to oblivion.</br></br></br>  <br>Oldschool kobold. As in dog person. Speaking of that, how did the kobold transition from dog people to jew lizards?</br>  <br>You want disgusting? Lamia is over 7m long. 5.5-6 of those meters are constantly dragged through the streets. Those same 5.5-6m then coil around you in bed. A bath before sex might help, I guess, but she still has to drag that into your home. Or wrap around your neck when she wants to drag you somewhere.<br> But the streets of Japan are clean! <br>What about public restrooms? Even if she herself doesn't go in them(or like that MS Paint an anon drew illustrated, she simply lifts her tail tip all the way to the bowl to empty her cloaca), other people drag those same restroom germs onto the streets, where she picks them up. A Lamia waifu would be a germophobe's ultimate nightmare.</br></br></br>  <br>Someone liked lizards more I guess</br>    <br>Head over to Jitsu Wa Watashiwa</br>  <br> Birds shits, pee and lay eggs from the same hole. Ultra disgusting. <br>You can fuck her and have vaginal and anal sex pretty much at the same time. I find it cool.</br></br>  I find Cerea disgusting. Don't have problem with Rachnee, she's hot.    <br>That's why Suu is best.</br>  I love horse pussy. It's so damn erotic, and the donut buttholes are great too.  <br><br>Z-ton will make you love horse pussy.<br><br> http://i.imgur.com/YJkKJZz.jpg </br></br></br></br>  Which monster girl would be the least disgusting IRL?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128742869   <br>Dullahan probably.

But Suu can be best girl too as long as she mimics her.</br>  <br>Mero if you're both in the water.<br>Miia would do it for me personally.<br>Manako the Cyclops overall. I mean, she's just a normal girl who happens to only have one eye.</br></br></br>  Cerea is mai waifu  <br>Try searching horse and dress.</br>  <br>that tails never been cleaned, its matted rotting and caked in years of horse shit</br>  <br> what is wading into a swift stream </br>  i think this is my new fav thing on /a/. its like /a/ is eating itself  <br><br>Huh? What?</br></br>  <br>Isn't there a lamia/harpy/centaur one like this?</br>  <br>its hated a loved by the same ppl that flip flop on it.</br>  <br> its <br> a <br> ppl <br>What a shitty fucking post.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kinda depends on the context. But realistically, Kobolds seem to be able to effortlessly function in a human based society. (can clean themselves without help, use doors and human clothing etc)<br>I'm more of a dragon girl fan myself, but since dragon-newt a shit, I'm holding out that crab will show us a real dragon some time soon.</br></br>  <br> irony </br>  <br>Actually, now that i think about it, Yuki-onna and fox girl are pretty easily able to function in society too. Tree girl as well. I think Darling really just got the rejects of the monster girl world.</br>  <br>I like poisoned and carbonated Suu more.</br>  <br>I would like black slime, if i wouldn't get cancer.</br>    Best girl  <br>God why those crippled looking fish limbs?</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bpI<wbr>m4SWOI34</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>    <br> its matted rotting and caked in years of horse shit <br>Horses never get shit on their tail.<br>Their anus is also a self-cleaning wonder.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sort of like a bat.</br></br>  Can Miia unhinge her jaw? How large of an object can she eat in one bite?  <br>Snakes don't unhinge their jaws.</br>  <br>They can open them up pretty wide though, otherwise they couldn't eat mice.</br>  anyone else completely disgusting by the centaur chick? every time i see her, her fucking ears and just the whole horse part of her elicit a profound sense of revulsion deep inside me. <br>And it's none of the other girls in the show, just her<br>why?</br></br>  <br><br>Centaur's worries went off the fucking rails. I think the mangaka might have had legitimate mental issues. There was so much weird fetishy shit, not like monster-girl fetishism but weird piss/vagina/yuri fetishism and that fucking random political commentary. I dropped that shit.</br></br>  Cerea and rachnee would be so much better as lamias.<br>Mero would be so much better as either a lamia or a Arachne.<br>Miia and Papi are better off not even existing.</br></br>  <br>So, where is her actual vagina? Is it on her human side crotch or horse side rump? Or does she have both?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128754135 <br>FACKING NORMIE GET OUT</br>  <br>PTSD.

She still reacted.</br>  <br>Horse pussy is no meme anon. Though other monmusus have human pussy as far as i am aware.</br>  <br>Hows the weather in wales?</br>  <br><br>but bird doesn't have bird legs or torso, her body is human except her arms. she's the only musume with a human hoohah.</br></br>  <br>All of them except Suu and Horse have regular ones as far as we know. I guess Polt could have a dog pussy.</br>  <br><br>She has bird legs.</br></br>    <br>1) Your mom was frightened by a Donkey Show while carrying you.<br>2) Genetic memory of a ancestor's life spent being Mongol Whored.<br>3) Everyone but you got ponies at their birthday party.<br>4) That trip to the Agricultural Fair that no one in the family will ever discuss.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You have beard legs.</br>  <br>implying cucklord is ever bestgirl but shed be best on the grill.</br>  I wonder if Suu went around sucking out nectar and flower petal if she would end up with a upbeat personality too, or at least turn horny.

Then the female centaur gets pregnant on both ends. The front pussy births a human upper torso, and the rear pussy births a horse body without a neck or head. The doctor then surgically attaches the baby human torso to the baby horse body. And there you have it, the totally natural way centaurs are born.</br>  So harem ending or single partner ending?

Maybe while it had a drop of semen hanging from it. Would it eat the semen?<br>This is why I ask if there is a turtle Monster Musume.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's only because they don't poo very often. My bredl's python once went over a month without defecating but ate like normal the whole time.</br>  <br>Don't do that.

I know that's the teletubbies custard machine.</br>  <br> prefer mating with humans. <br>more like prefrence to mating with bishies<br>if cerea mom had a son instead I'd imagine he would be pretty popular with them.</br></br></br>  <br>That's an idiotic theory and a crime to fictional anatomy. Why the hell would they have an asshole going through their spines?</br>  <br/>  Reminder: thank Crabman  <br>You wouldnt stick your hand inside dude, youd just softly run your fingers over them, making her gasp cutely as you do so.<br><br>God i fucking want mero so much.</br></br></br>  If she's more than 50% animal, you a furry!  <br>the only thing that I don't like about Mero isn't the fish legs, isn't the webbed hands, isn't anything else, it's just...<br>She's covered in mucous, right? And she survives deep underwater. That makes sense, some fish are like that.<br>But wouldn't she be very, very cold to the touch? Not only that, but you'd have to wash your hands just about every time you touched her. <br>She's great, but imagine embracing a freezing, wet body for love.</br></br></br></br>  <br>50% what? Mass?<br>Miia has 80% of a human and a 6m long tail</br></br>  <br>Overall surface area<br>Papi and Lala are literally the only non-furry main girls</br></br>  <br>at what point is 50%</br>  <br>As labelled 1 is the only non furry there</br>    <br>5 is not furry</br>  <br>So none of the monmusu girls are furry</br>  <br>5 is fully animal, so of course.</br>    <br>Why did I laugh so hard at this. It's not even remotely funny.</br>  <br>At that point it's bestiality not furry then.</br>  <br>Furry is the attraction to animal features. Most monster girls' features are more like accessories than attractive features. In the same way some people don't get turned on or off by legs, Spider Butt isn't necessarily attractive or unattractive. Polt and Horse are more arguable.</br>  <br>Because the joke is dangerously cheesy.</br>    <br> http://imgur.com/a/GEpNq <br><br>You're welcome</br></br></br>  Miia a cute.  <br><br>Furry is the attraction to animal heads and some animal features. MG fetishism is the attraction to human heads and monster/animal features. That's the big difference, you can have 2 identical designs except 1 has a dog head and 1 has a human face, and only the one wit the dog head is "furry".</br></br>  <br>Being attracted to half a horse if pretty fucking close to bestiality.</br>  Obligatory Lala post.  <br>Why isnt she covering her butt</br>  so guys, how does this end up happening?  <br>But this is not bestiality, or perhapsthe fanservice in the series doesn't affect you?</br>  <br>MG fetishism is more about attraction to human FEATURES than only head. At the very least the torso<br><br>If Cerea was a horse with a human head it would be just creepy</br></br></br>  <br>The bigger the are, the harder they fall.<br>She's like 2 meter tall. Imagine falling down with all the weight of a horse to pull you down.</br></br>  <br>because she probably isn't going to swim she might just lay in the sand and get warm.</br>  <br>no, i mean, with her centaur lower body, her human back shouldn't be on the floor</br>  <br>but how did she fall on her back when she has a horse body behind it?</br>  <br>RIP Satoru</br>  <br>some guy at mgqg did one of promestein</br>  <br><br>Yes, but these human features outside the face and maybe the torso are highly up to the viewer to decide. And I didn't mention the torso because furries also value the humanoid torso. The big differentiator between MG and Furry is the face, specifically the nose/mouth area. You can have weird ears, weird eyes, scales and shit, but as long as the nose and mouth are humanoid, they satisfy the MG fetishist, whereas the furfag will be attracted to NONHUMAN noses and mouths, specifically muzzles, beaks and snouts.</br></br>   Miia puts on a few pounds <br> Rachne spins a web over her bedroom door that says "Some Pig" </br>  <br>now im sad anon, thanks a lot.</br>  <br>Now that I checked, her more could also turn a lot of her human torso too.<br><br>Maybe centaurs just have a really versatile waist?</br></br></br>  So, what the fuck is going on here?    <br>so, Polt and Ninetei having a canine hose in a human face make them furry?</br>  <br> lying cheating whore </br>  But Papi has a normal vagina and are-hole, right? That part is human.  <br>Borderline, to be honest. They're like Mithra because they have animal noses on human facial structure. It's kind of a grey area but I get the feeling it's more for MG fetishists than furries.</br>  Find a flaw.<br>Pro-tip:  you can't </br>  <br><br>Best girl.</br></br>  <br> can't speak for shit </br>  <br>She's too perfect</br>  <br>Anya a shit.

How much does the anime cover in manga and LN?  <br>The LN serves as prequel to the manga. I think it's four years before the events of the manga. The anime doesn't cover any of it. (I'd imagine we'll get an OVA based on the LN or something eventually.) And right now, the anime has covered the first four volumes of the manga exactly.</br>  <br>Thank you, it seems translation of the LN has been abandoned, i guess i will have to try MT it?</br>  <br>Can't answer that question. 'm new to LNs and don't know shit. Sorry 'bout that.</br>  Would have been better than attack on titan if it the settings were much more serious<br><br> muh school </br></br>  <br>The highschool setting is abandoned and never picked back up after Yuuichiro gets his demon gear.</br>  I want to believe Yuu is going to give Shinoa plenty of children and they live comfortable together  <br>What are you, some kind of fujoshi?</br>  <br> Would have been better than attack on titan <br> implying </br></br>  <br>Lots of smuggies</br>  <br>Next chapter when?</br>    This got real stale real fast.  <br>I don't fuckin' know.</br>  <br>This week</br>  Why didn't Shinoa let Yuu kiss her in the hospital room?  <br>Because it wasn't even leading in to that.</br>  <br>And even if it was leading into a kiss, Mitsuba barged in because her tsundere senses were tingling.</br>  <br> it seems translation of the LN has been abandoned <br>Tumblr is doing it, latest chapter of volume 2 came out today.<br>http://owari-owari.tumblr.com/tagge<wbr>d/translation</wbr></br></br></br>  <br> MT <br>?</br></br>  <br>What do people think will happen in the next chapter? Will Yu wake up and go berserk or will Mika get him away safely? I don't want a repeat of last time as it's so rare for shit to even happen here.</br>  <br>smug thread?</br>  <br>Absolutely.</br>  <br>Yuichiro went berserk because he saw all of his bros getting their blood sucked, and he thought he'd lose his family again. I doubt he'll release his seraph again, ad on top of that Mika seems like he's starting to trust the Shinoa squad.</br>  <br>Option 1: Mika leaves a unconscious Yuu in a safe place and goes back to help the squad, arrives in time to be confronted by Krul directly wrecking everybody with her army<br><br>Option 2: Yuu wakes up and goes batshita asking where Shinoa and the others are, but can barely move. Mika promises to go back to help them because he owes them one anyway.<br><br>Option 3: No focus on Mika or Yuu. Full focus on the squad's battle against Krul army with Kureto finally arriving at the last minute and Krul recognizing Shinoa as being related to Mahiru</br></br></br></br></br>  Do you guys think Mika's every gonna become a proper vampire and drink human blood?  <br>I doubt it. Author has delayed it for so long I can't see it happening anymore. With the Shinoa-Mika trust thing now I also can't see him going full vampire.</br>  <br>I see Mika turning back to save them, the guilt was getting to him. Maybe he'll finally awaken his Seraph?</br>  I have an entire folder of her and I haven't even watched the show.<br><br>Maybe I should do that</br></br>  I'm watching this for Mika. Did this make me a fujoshit?  <br><br>There's a 50/50 chance he either becomes one or somehow goes back to being human<br><br>In the novels Guren's blood gets contaminated with a demon curse put on him by Mahiru, but it seems he was able to go back to being human (still not explained how) but his blood type changed from a type-A to a type-O. So considering Mika is part vampire because of the vampire blood Krul implanted in him there may be a chance to remove/replace it and make him go back to being human even if he becomes a full vampire</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have an entire folder of her and I've read the manga.</br>  <br>She alone could not redeem the show.</br>  <br>Unless you are shipping him with another guy, no. Is just husbando faggotry</br>  <br>She is also my wallpaper.</br>  <br>Is it just me that thinks he could have gotten away with kissing her? Like she would let him.</br>  <br>Naw. She's obviously in denial.</br>  <br>I just want Yuu to wake up and have a fucking normal conversation with Mika. I have a feeling they won't be the focus of the upcoming chapter but I just need them to talk it out and move on.</br>  <br>Dude, you say it like it was some kind of missunderstanding.</br>  <br>It was some kind of misunderstanding.</br>  I haven't been around for a wile, mika kill anyone on Yu's side last chapter?  <br>Nope.<br>As a matter of fact, Shinoa went out of her way to make sure Mika didn't get attacked by anyone on the human side.</br></br>  <br>Oh, anyone got a link to it?</br>  <br>http://kissmanga.com/Manga/Owari-no<wbr>-Serafu/Chapter-034?id=232374</wbr></br>  <br> still holding out hope of any romantic development <br><br>You must be new here</br></br></br>  <br>"I want to believe"</br>  <br>"hope"</br>  <br>Thanks</br>    <br>You're welcome.</br>  If Mika isn't the Seraph of the Beginning I'm going to be really mad.    This thread does't have enough Shinoa.  <br>I agree.</br>    I hope this will get scanned along with the 3 other Seraph doujins he made in the past    <br>What's the title of this doujin?</br>  <br>Kazoku BLOW</br>    <br>You lied to me.</br>  <br>But I didn't...?</br>  <br>Oh... sorry... google just isn't a good source I guess... If it's not to much to ask, can I get a link to it?</br>  <br>Shinoa should be the main character.</br>  <br>Shinoa should be swallowing the main character's cum.</br>  <br> her face when her forearm is the exact same length Yuichiro's erect cock <br> she gives it her best shot </br></br>  I need more of this smug.  So, in the shower scene, did Shinoa and that blonde girl fug?  <br>(the blonde girl is Mitsuba, by the way)<br>Naw, I think it was just some friendly, no-homo breast fondling. Of course, Shinoa was the only one doing the fondling though.</br></br>  <br>October cant come sooner.</br>  <br>Most amazing blow job Yuu will ever have.</br>  <br>Machine translate</br>  <br> Shinoa was the only one doing the fondling though. <br>Because there's nothing to fondle on her?</br></br>  <br>That, and Mitsuba was obviously not into it.</br>  At least there isn't a love triangle in this, right? Besides the OTP who else is there?  <br>Aren't Shinoa and Krul, like, the only relevant girls in the series?</br>  <br>There's also Mahiru, Shinoa's sister who is now Guren's demon.</br>  <br>I know about her but doesn't she only appears in flashbacks?</br>  <br>She's shown briefly in the anime, but in the manga, she's mentioned multiple times, and shown a few times. She's also one of the main characters in the LN. (Which by the way, the LN is a prequel to the manga/anime taking place five years before the manga/anime.)</br>  New chapter when? i'm curious what faggot Mika will do  <br><br>I only read the manga, and half of it was in French which I'm only passable with, but didn't the Shinoa rival seem to have some slight (irrelevant) triangle going when Shinoa visited Yuu in the hospital?</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but I wouldn't call it irrelevant. There's a few scenes afterwords where Shinoa shows romantic interest in Yuichiro. They're rare, but you can tell that the mangakas are going for some gradual, believable, realistic build up for Shinoa's feelings towards Yuichiro.</br>  <br>She doesn't so much into Yuu or try to pursue him, the writer seems to ship her more with Kimizuki in later chapters</br>  <br>"She" refers to Mitsuba</br>  <br>Oh, not Yuu and Shinoa being irrelevant, I meant the other girl's thing for him was irrelevant.</br>  <br>Basically, yeah.</br>  More Shinoa.      short is best  <br>What did she see?</br>      <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=873<wbr>f2pGvzLI</wbr>  [ ]</br>  angry shinoa is cute too  <br>Why does this make me laugh so much?</br>  Fuck your Shinoas.    <br>Blasphemy.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128747594 <br>Shinoa any day.</br>  Am I the only one here who absolutely loves the manga's artwork?  <br>anime art &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; manga art</br>          Wow, this thread is still active?  Watched for smug. Stayed for smug, loli vampire Krul and Gren.  <br>Gren?</br>  <br>Guren whoops</br>  Shinoa was born on Christmas.<br>Shinoa is the second coming.</br>  <br>Why the fuck did the mangakas give her a blood type?</br>  Sexy vampire  We still Shinoa posting?  I honestly feel like the reason Mitsuba is such a bitch is because her pussy is so tight that it physically hurts.  <br>Like... so tight that it starts to spiral in?</br>  <br>Of course.</br>  Is this show worth it just for Shinoa? Even with bullshit magic arrows annihilating helicopters?  <br>I recomend the manga.<br> looks better <br> longer <br> actually gets kinda good eventually </br></br></br></br>    <br>He's gonna have to either go full vampire or find a cure. At this point vampire blood is no longer sufficient.<br><br>So his options are:<br> 1 - drink human blood and go full vampire <br> 2 - continue starving himself and become a demon, after which he becomes someone's new Cursed Gear <br> 3 - find a cure that will turn him human again <br> 4 - go full Seraph and end the world </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They'd all be just as smug as their mother.</br>  <br>why not?</br>  <br>And if you want to english his name it is supposed to be Glen</br>    Look at those feet  Anyone got links for scans of translated 34 and 35? Or are they just uploaded onto the online readers like batoto?  <br>this.</br>    <br>C'mon I agree the writing is garbage but the school bait is just stupid. At least try harded</br>  <br>look at those finger tips.</br>  <br>Apparently in the bible the second coming of Christ is the only thing that can stop the seven judgements<br><br>I wonder if the mangaka thought this through. Its also the same day the first apocalypse happened in the story, kind of reminds me of Guilty Crown with the whole lost Christmas and shit</br></br></br>  <br>34 is on kissmanga.<br>35 has only been translated by viz as of right now.</br></br>  <br>Is that her LN version? Because it's delicious</br>  <br>They look pretty gross tbh</br>  <br>35 has been out too if you search it on online readers you would find it</br>  <br>Yeah.</br>    <br><br>I see 35 but it's marked as 35.1 in mangafox<br><br>Anyway thanks</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you look up "great" in the dictionary, you'll see this picture.</br>  <br>She is</br>  <br>You can find them in the archive you know.</br>  <br>It'd actually be really cool to see Mika replace Asuramaru, or maybe even possess Yu's sword with Asuramaru. They'd be like shoulder angles.</br>  <br>Then what will they do with Ashuramaru? He is one of the strongest demon</br>  <br>Fuck I'm retarded. Thanks for pointing it out.</br>  <br>It would be even cooler if Mika goes back to being human and Krul becomes his sword, that way he and Yuu can have sibling swords to add more fuel to the family theme</br>  Remember when these faggots first joined the military?  <br>You're right, that would be pretty cool.</br>  <br>No, and while they are great fap material I fucking hate Guren's sluts<br><br>Specially the brown haired one is Sakura-levels of retarded</br></br></br>  <br>Mito (red one) is pretty great though. Just because her gear is a pair of metal gauntlets. She punches vampires, and the they disintegrate. That's fuckin' rad.</br>  <br>but she is tsundere with Guren, i don't like tsundere</br>  But the real question is, in LN terms, who is the best girl?  <br>She still punches vampires. Being a tsundere can't change that. Not now, not ever.</br>  what a big phone or shinoa is too small?  <br>The least offensive one is the himecut kuudere</br>  <br>She can't see over a fucking steering wheel at fifteen. I think it's a pretty safe deduction that she's just fucking tiny, even at ten/</br>  <br>her smugness turns me on</br>  <br>Well, she is stoic but i won't call her kuudere she is pretty loyal toward Guren, have the real servant attitute</br>  <br> her smugness turns me on <br><br>Will she get Megami posters?</br></br></br>  <br>She's literally just as tall as kid Mika.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wyS<wbr>rC9O5eUY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Because Yuu was too busy thinking about boys.</br>  <br>Mahiru</br>  Seraph of the End-my-fucking-life-right-now-I'm-b<wbr>egging-you-please</wbr>  <br>cute</br>  <br>Yeah, definitely Mahiru.</br>  <br>What are they even talking about in this video?</br>  <br>it is omake, anon translated it on past thread<br><br>Mika: Sigh...<br>Yuu: What's wrong, Mika? Something worrying you?<br><br>Mika: Oh, hey Yuu.<br>Yuu: Geez! I told you to stop shouldering our burdens alone!<br><br>Mika: But I don't think I should share this...<br>Yuu: Spit it out already!!<br><br>Mika: Okay. I was thinking this story would have more flair with me as the main character.<br>Yuu: Crawl off and die!!<br><br>"Who's the Main Character?!"<br>Mika: Yuu, it's a bad thing for a story to have a bland main character!<br>Mika: You need flair, like me!!<br>Yuu: Sure, say it to my face.<br>Mika: Well, you did tell me to spit it out.<br>Yuu: Urk!<br><br>Shinoa: I see. He does have a point.<br><br>Shinoa: I think if I were a magical girl, the series would sell like hotcakes.<br>Yuu: No, that's not even the same story!<br><br>Guren: Why don't you just make me the main character?<br>Yuu: You're already the main character of the novels!!!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>thanks, m8</br>  <br>Is this your first anime?</br>  I just woke up. Thread is still active. I love you /a/nons.  <br>No. I just don't see a reason to give a character blood type when it isn't relevant to the story at all.</br>  <br> we will never get a magical smug-chan spinoff <br>why even live?</br></br>  <br>Japs are big on blood types.</br>  <br><br><br>it's relevant since Guren changed his blood type</br></br></br>  why is she so cute?  <br>I don't think the setting is the problem (school didn't happen for long anyway) it's how the characters act. It's like the setting and plot is interesting but the characters feel like something from an somewhat ecchi romcom.</br>  <br>People believe blood type can influence personality of the character.<br><br><br>Because she is a midget.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I love those colors.</br>  <br> midget </br>  <br>That's why omnipandering is cancer</br>  <br><br>That's because this series specifically panders to fujoshits, self-insert fags and haremfags. <br><br>If the author wasn't so busy trying to get easy bucks out of the worse possible audience, this series would be more decent</br></br></br></br>  <br> That's because this series specifically panders to fujoshits, self-insert fags and haremfags. <br>That's what omnipandering implies</br></br>  <br>It's funny because people are generally not attracted to things they feel are trying to pander to them. Look at all of the more serious series that have no pandering. If the story is good people will read it and draw a hell of a lot of porn of it too. Gay porn too, since fujos love to warp reality for their fantasies. They don't actually want characters to be gay though. For otaku perverts you have to be subtle, because more than anything they get excited by what they imagine, not what they see.</br>  why does guren look like toru from chaika  <br>He is level 16 Toru.</br>  <br><br>Guren pls.<br><br> You're right though. Mahiru is literal perfection. Just like her sister. </br></br></br></br>  someone tell me she gets abducted and has hot lesbian sex with the loli vampire.    <br>That's what I mean. Just look at series like Gangsta and Kekkai Sensen, they aren't actively trying to pander to anybody yet they still attract a broad audience. Same with how Snk started. With this series the designs alone would have been enough to make it popular, the author just needed to give characters other than Shinoa and maybe Guren actual personalities <br><br><br>There's a difference between omnipandering so blatantly that you scared off the same audience you are trying to attract, and doing it more subtlety so that they get excited by the little pandering they get<br><br>Fucking Slaine/Inaho is a more popular pairing (still is) despite them barely interacting, liking the same whore and remaining enemies until the end, than not related by blood brothers separate by war that don't like any girls romantically in a romeo/juliette-esque scenario. Just think about it for a second</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what is she thinking?</br>  <br>So does being AB mean that she's a filthy Jew?</br>  <br> Inaho x Slaine <br>I didn't even know that was a thing. Jesus christ fujo are insane. How do you even tell it's more popular? The only thing I ever saw discussed was Hime NTR or something while I come across this mika x yuu in most seraph discussions.</br></br>  I kinda like how micchan got the first doujin out on sadpanda  <br>It has a shitton of art on pixiv.</br>  <br>Pixiv art isn't that great an indicator of overall popularity. Many times a lot of art of "popular" stuff is by the same sets of people.</br>  <br>Yes, she does.</br>  <br>Thingken of smug</br>  <br>Still way over 1000, many of those batches and doujins and that's without counting everything on twitter. Fujos love it.</br>  <br>It is because if you follow some artists' twitter they tend to buy a shitton of merchandise because of it</br>  <br>Are you shitting me m8? The threads were often raided by fujos posting gay fan art of the pairing. Is like you don't remember the NO GAYS ALLOWED in bold letters in the OP of almost every thread while it was airing</br>  <br><br>This. Some pandering works but if it's too obvious they won't have anything to fantasize about. There's not even any tension just everyone going muh family.<br><br> comparing this to Inaho/Slaine <br>Fujos love enemy pairings and Inaho/Slaine had Inaho saving Slaine with mecha fucking holding hands and Inaho coming to see Slaine in prison. Of course it's fucking popular.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>without smugchan owari no seraph its nothing.</br>  <br>Meh, who care fujo like this series or not or it is popular in pixiv or not. I like it enough and so does 350k nips who buys the manga. <br>I like it bettar than SnK who is shit except the action</br></br>  <br>Yaoi pandering doesnt work because no one likes mika other than irrelevant tumbrl hambeasts.</br>   Smug-chan lets Mika have Yuu <br>Dropped.</br>  <br>But this is shit in all area including action though?</br>   everyone remember shinoa and forgot hestia <br>Natural selection at its best.</br>  <br>No, i like the characters, plot and the setting, the action is fine when it is needed not the over the top one</br>  <br>No, she wants them to meet at the airport</br>  <br>This show has got to be the most cliched, overly edgy anime of the last 5 years.<br><br>It's literally Green Exorcist with vampires.</br></br></br>  <br>For some reason I find it fucking hilarious</br>  <br>Mikasa wears an actual uniform but she's still sexualized as fuck for the male fandom and the fact she doesn't wear a plugsuit or sailor fuku give her an appeal among female fans</br>  <br> overly edgy <br>Did you even watch this pass episode 1?</br></br>  <br>Except everyone mocks the shit out of Yuu's edgelord tendencies</br>  <br>Yes. It was the only good episode.<br> Did you? </br></br>  <br>I mean do you watch the ep 2-12?</br>  <br> think it was the only good episode <br> complain about being overly edgy <br>are you retarded?</br></br></br>  <br>Edge is when settings and characters try to be dark, but the premise is executed so badly that it's laughable.<br><br> That being said <br>The first episode of this series was done pretty well. <br><br> but every episode afterwards was pure edge </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> i think it is edgy <br> well another episode are not that edge <br> So it is edge <br>still, you are retarded</br></br></br></br>  <br>The girl who carried a season with a smug expression.</br>  <br>I honestly don't get how you could watch this series and think the episodes past episode one were "edgy" in any sort of way. <br><br>It was pretty much "hey this world sucks but we can get over that because of friendship!"; which isn't quite edgy, like at all.</br></br></br>  <br>The series overall is edgy. So fucking what if I liked one episode? <br> but I'm retarded </br></br>  <br/>  <br> had Inaho saving Slaine with mecha fucking holding hands and Inaho coming to see Slaine in prison. <br><br>That didn't happen until the very end of the series. I am talking about how popular it was while it was airing and they had barely interacted</br></br></br>  2cute.  <br>They were enemies and gave each other nicknames. That's enough for most fujos.</br>  <br> Dystopia <br> Oh no my family was killed by *insert enemy faction here*, now I must kill them all <br> Oh no that family member that I was closest too is actually alive and has joined the enemy <br> To fight, let me use these completely arbitrary weapons that have some dark consciousness bound to it <br> oh no! My friend was overcome with darkness! Now I have to kill him! But I have the power of friendship! <br> I wear glasses, I'm a hard ass, *glasses shine* <br> I don't listen to rules, I must avenge my family <br><br>I could go on, but I'm sitting on the toilet angrily tapping my phone for you people.<br> that being said <br>The whole fucking atmosphere of this show tries way too hard to be dark. It reeks of edgy teen shounen. Even Blue Exorcist did a better job at being dark and I thought that was cliché as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Every one of those gets fixed by generic shounen friendship speeches.</br>  <br>What show are you talking about? Do you really watch the other episodes except ep 1?</br>  <br><br> no one likes mika other than irrelevant tumbrl hambeasts <br><br>A lot of people want to like Mika because of his design alone, but his obsession with Yuu puts them off. You know you fucked up when the plain generic MC is more popular than the obligatory pretty boy of the series. And nips fucking love gaijin characters</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wow, it really tries to be so dark.</br>  <br>Magneto and Professor X best ship.</br>  <br>In Yuu's defense. At least he had some character development. Mika doesn't</br>  <br>It's amazing how Mika is a less annoying Slaine and Slaine was still more popular and got paired with everybody. Even fujos still draw Cruhteo/Slaine but almost no Ferid/Mika? What the actual fuck.</br>  <br>So good that she can even cure the edge of the MC</br>  <br> Explain </br>  <br><br>Does that mean fujos self-insert with Mika for fucking Yu and not the other way around?</br></br>  <br> It's amazing how Mika is a less annoying Slaine <br><br>No he isn't<br><br> Slaine was still more popular and got paired with everybody <br><br>Because he was obsessed with a girl so he came off as a dedicated knight not a desperate pseudo homosexual <br><br> Even fujos still draw Cruhteo/Slaine but almost no Ferid/Mika <br><br>Cruhteo only ever treated Slaine bad not the people around him, and he somewhat redeemed himself before getting laser beamed. Ferid pretty much ruined Mika's entire life AND the ones of the people around him, and I highly doubt he is gonna be redeemed since he is evil for shits and giggles</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yuu is more popular because they self-insert as him to get to Mika, plus the other self-insert fags that want to fuck Shinoa</br></br>  <br> Dystopia <br>He gets out and gets a bunch of friends.<br> Oh no my family was killed by *insert enemy faction here*, now I must kill them all <br>Until he finds out that Mika is alive and then it's I must save Mika!<br> Oh no that family member that I was closest too is actually alive and has joined the enemy <br>And he tells everyone he's going to save Mika no matter what and everyone's ok with it.<br> To fight, let me use these completely arbitrary weapons that have some dark consciousness bound to it <br> oh no! My friend was overcome with darkness! Now I have to kill him! But I have the power of friendship! <br>Precisely. Friendship &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; darkness.<br> I wear glasses, I'm a hard ass, *glasses shine* <br>He's actually a nice guy who cares about his family, they then become friends.<br> I don't listen to rules, I must avenge my family <br>Everyone cares more about family and friends than revenge.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ferid pretty much ruined Mika's entire life AND the ones of the people around him, and I highly doubt he is gonna be redeemed since he is evil for shits and giggles <br>I think the idea with Ferid is making a fabulous sociopath that attract fangirls for being so evil and cute at the same time, see Hisoka. I tend to hate these characters because it implies the sociopath must get away with his bullshit over and over again because the writers love him.

What's easy for Japanese kids is not necessarily what's easy for adult Japanese learners. I'm not sure it even makes sense to recommend people start off with Yotsuba, graded readers or an appropriate novel might be a better choice.  <br> 予襲 <br>"previous attack".

Know it already?<br><br>終焉</br></br></br>  <br><br>It has been proven many times, but you do not acquire language through production. You acquire through input (reading / listening). The only reason a conversation might be a good thing is to listen to the responses, but it's no different than consuming media. That is how you get good at understanding a language.</br></br>  <br> I don't see how grinding vocab in kanji makes reading kana any harder, <br><br>It makes it harder because you're seeing the word in a form you're not used to seeing and it's more difficult to distinguish vocab from grammar. Japanese kids know a lot of vocab but not much kanji, that's why Yotsuba is easy for them. Adult learners usually know a lot of kanji but not that much vocab, pretty much the opposite of what shit written for kids assumes you know.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, thanks though. I guess I'll just read a chuuni vn to get new ones.</br>  <br> wah why won't DJT help me increase my kanji grid dick size <br>Holy shit quit acting like such a self-entitled manchild just because people wouldn't spoonfeed you rare words to learn out of context. Go read pretentious chuunishit or something if you really care that much about kanji count; at least then you'll actually be learning the words in context instead of mining a dictionary like a moron.</br></br>  <br> You acquire through input <br> I have been watching Japanese media since I was in Elementary school <br><br>Why am I not fluently speaking Japanese?</br></br></br></br>  <br> It has been proven many times <br>Citation kudasai.</br></br>  <br>You still know how the words supposed to be read. Read it aloud and you get it.</br>  <br>Because you was watching it with subs? Just hearing words isn't input, you have to listen to them.</br>  <br>Because you weren't listening to the Japanese, you were too busy thinking in English.<br><br><br>Look up Stephen Krashen, he has some talks in Youtube which he shows a bunch of studies that show kids who read acquire languages much faster.</br></br></br></br>  Nandeska watashi hontoni imouto magi magi sugoii soda desu gozaimasu wake ga nai.

This is a classic problem that beginners have and it usually stems from a lack of listening practice.

My question was quirky but was completely relevant to the point, and I should be asking what kind of response yours is because you completely avoided the question and instead just tried to lash out at someone.

You and many others might not want to read this but when you read something, it triggers regions of your brain focused on speech and audio recognition.

They are translated into living languages as a means of comprehension. The "dead" Latin which is used by the Vatican, etc. is the perfect example of this: the spoken language has become lost and as a means to continue using it people have used rules and patterns of relative living languages in order for them to be functional.

You are always going to be limited by your listening ability. You are going to be translating until your listening ability is good enough to be able to internally vocalize what you are reading. <br><br>Unless your brain functions differently to everyone else.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I have trouble reading the easiest childrens comic book there is <br> but I'm an expert on language learning and will argue about it for hours instead of actually learning Japanese <br>/djt/ - Daily Japanese Thread</br></br></br>  <br>You said you only cared about reading, which means you don't care about listening. In response to asking if you'd ever care about listening, you said that listening is pointless.

You're the one that can't even keep up with what you say.</br>  <br> Scholars of dead languages don't read those languages as primary languages. <br><br>It doesn't matter, they still read them fluently, which is the only point of discussion here.

Once you conjugate a verb into the たい form it technically becomes an adjective, after all.</br>  <br>Ah, that makes sense. Thank you.</br>  <br> it's not based off of sound whatsoever <br>The point is that it uses a system of pseudo-phonetics which activate the same areas of the brain which spoken language activates. It is fundamentally different from a system of symbolism or concepts. When deaf people sign they are "speaking" similar to how non-deaf people do when speak to each other. <br><br>It is based on the same thing sound is based off: a system of movements representing a 'sound unit', not a concept. This parallels with reading in regards to Japanese in that when reading your brain is 'vocalizing' the words and the brain relates the sound units to meaning primarily and not word units as concepts to meaning. <br><br>In a means of representation:<br>[word] house → [vocalize] "house" → [meaning] object/action which we have ascribed to the sound via experience<br><br>[word] 家 → [vocalize] "いえ" → [meaning] object/action which we have ascribed to the sound via experience<br><br>In order to read fluently in Japanese you have to be able to read the sentence in 'sounds' to the related meaning. Many learners build up their reading ability by using English as a crutch, which is not a negative thing as it is useful, but what someone who claims to be able to read "fluently" yet has poor listening ability is ultimately using kanji and familiar word groups to filter them through English to meaning instead of Japanese sound to meaning. This is why as listening and speaking ability increases it increases the ability to be able to read without translating in your head. It is the difference between going from Japanese word to Japanese sound to Japanese concept and Japanese word to Japanese sound to English concept.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is truly a homage to the successful process of natural selection pressure.</br>  everybody we came so far lets not lose, have short term, like something you can achieve by the end of this year.

Even some of the grammar wouldn't make sense if you don't vocalize kanji when reading, not to mention how the words aren't going to be always spelled the same way as they are in anki and dictionaries.<br><br>One plot point based on mispronunciation/mishearing of some word and our hero "fluent" in reading Japanese wouldn't understand shit.</br></br></br>  Is production an absolute necessity for learning Japanese?

They only take 20~ minutes but it's quite tedious. I imagine, though, that the review count is so high because I've been using anki for about 2 years. At that point I imagine the huge number of "alive" cards just inflates it above normal size.
