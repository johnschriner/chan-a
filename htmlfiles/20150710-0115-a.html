[  [DameDesuYo] Okusama ga Seitokaichou! - 02 (1280x720 10bit AAC) [BCD0AA03].mkv <br><br>Time.</br></br>  Finally   ep1 is 159mb <br> ep2 is 259mb  <br><br>why?</br></br></br>  <br>Harddrives are cheap anon, don't be a faggot.<br>Though, the HS 480p rip will be out tomorrow, just for you, Mr. Megabyte.</br></br>  <br>How can this be broadcast with nipple and yet MM still has fog and steam issues?</br>  I want to protect that smile.  Why is japanese male so pants on head flaming gay?  <br>calm down m8 I was only wondering why there was such a change in filesize<br><br>no need to sperg out</br></br></br>  Akainu being mad like underage shitposters.  I thought he would be even more furious than he was. I was certain there would be magma flowing.<br><br>I think the only reason is because he didnt actually watch the stream and got it from word of mouth<br><br>Imagine if he saw Fujitora bowing live.</br></br></br></br>   Zorofags thinking he will beat Fujitora <br> Implying he can stand a chance even with Asura </br>  post OP girls in swimsuits  I forgot there is still Sabo who will protect Luffy.<br><br>And Sabo is almost equal to Fujitora.<br><br>Well, time for CP0 to come onto the scene then.</br></br></br></br>    <br> inb4 Sabo and Zoro fight over who protects Luffy, his old friend or his first mate. </br>  <br> Zoro and Sanji have not had a fight where they had to my pushed to their limits since the time skip. Come one man give us something Oda. </br>  <br> doflamingo was about to kill sanji <br> not pushed to his limits </br></br>  <br>Meh, Zoro isn't that strong.<br><br>Sabo could probably crush all his swords with his Dragongrip.<br><br>Zoro is no match for Fuji.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He didnt reveal everything he had in store. I am sure Sanji and Zoro still have abilities which they have not revealed yet which is what I want to see.</br>  <br>fuck off Shitbernd</br>  <br><br>I feel superbly confident Sanji has an Okama SSJ mode where he wears a dress.</br></br>   tfw completely disappointed with Kaido's design <br><br>I know we only got a glimpse but god damnit</br></br>  <br>I'm guessing next fight Zoro will be pushed to his limits. The finishing move on Pica was a souped-up version of his strongest non-Asura attack.</br>  Man, Fujitora is my new favorite<br>TRUE J U S T I C E</br>  <br>That wasn't kaido<br><br><br>it's like thinking the shadow in thriller bark was Moriah.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Fuji will actually fight the Strawhats.</br>     thread is only 17 posts yet <br> op is some colored garbage service not a chapter page <br> triptard <br> nametard <br>quality cancer</br></br></br></br>  <br>The fuck are you talking about?</br>  <br> another giant </br>  <br>Tashigi is a libra, you taurushead.</br>  <br>That isn't Kaido,that's just a tower or Kaido's highquarters. You don't ask "where are you" when there's a giant shadow right in front of you</br>  Anyone in the know know if Niggastream is coming out with their translation anytime soon?  <br>it's usually about 3 more hours from now.</br>  <br>Sabo visibly sweating and running around when fighting Fujitora while Fujitora barely moves from his original spot and is not getting tired at all.<br><br>Sorry but Sabo exerts so much effort while barely affecting Fujitora should show you that Sabo isn't close to being Admiral level at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Space Jin is the best.</br>    <br>Or maybe..<br><br>Just fucking maybe..<br><br>The guy was looking for Kaido, couldn't see him because the island is covered in cold as balls snow and that fog and Kaido emerges from it using a stereotypical manga entrance after the guy calls out for him.<br><br>But nah, that would be too logical.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anonymous being mad like underage Akainu.</br>  <br>Sanji has already jobbed twice.</br>  <br><br> this is the level of reader we have in these threads <br><br><br>That wasn't Kaidou. More so than visibility there is no reason to call out for Kaidou if he is a super huge giant. You can walk 20 feet and find him snow or no snow. <br>He called out because apparently he is hard to find.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah, it will be a mode related to Hell Memories</br></br>  <br> That being a tower is far more logical than the autistic bullshit you just shitted out you dumb fucking nigger, i swear to god some of you motherfuckers are too stupid to even comprehend a cartoon book whose target audience is 12 year old chinese boys.<br><br> Kill yourself you autistic cunt</br></br></br>  <br>It's a big throne on wheels. Kaido is a midget.</br>  <br>Have you never encountered a combination of incredibly heavy snow with dense fogs before? You would be surprised the shit it could hide from you even at a close distance.</br>  We literally didn't see any of the Mugiwaras.<br><br>This is a fucking shit chapter.</br></br>  <br>This<br><br>If you ever got in a storm/blizzard while skiing, with the snow falling down and fog all around you, you would know you can't even tell up from down, left from right and the furthest you're able to see is less then 5m. It's crazy, man</br></br></br>  <br><br>But what kind of creature is he if that is his silhouette? I agree with the others it's more of a tower/base</br></br>  <br>I don't think it's a tower base. I just think it's an obvious red herring. Everyone goes "OMG KAIDOU IS SO HUGE WTF!"<br><br>And whenever we see him he turns out to be short in stature or a bishie or something completely different. Not quite sure how people are constantly fooled by stuff like this</br></br></br>  <br>He's a giant den den mushi.</br>  <br>I do think he's a giant of some sort, and the twist isn't in being small, but a personality flaw of some sort.<br>Like, a constantly dere side or something.</br></br>   http://readms.com/r/one_piece/793/<wbr>2857/1</wbr>   Can someone upload the chapter to Imgur or something? Panda is broken for me.  <br> Panda is broken for me. <br>Panda is broken for everyone anon</br></br>  The wiki summary (inb4 wiki, they at least understand the raws) says that Sakazuki told Fuji that he'll be banned from the marines if he doesn't stop Luffy &amp; Law, which means Fuji will probably quit the marines now.  Oda is such a faggot for creating Fujitora and making him the new Admiral.    He protected his smile.  <br>That implies that Law cut a guy's balls off and touched them<br><br>GAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY</br></br></br>   pangamanda is unreadable shit <br> mangastream translator is asleep <br> Viz just release their official translation </br></br>  How come mangareader panda etc all don't load for me? This is on multiple devices  <br>Seriously, it doesn't make sense at all why a newbie like Fujitora was allowed to go handle Luffy and Law instead of an experienced veteran like Kizaru.</br>  Enemy confirmed.  3 questions I can't find an answer myself:<br><br>Why did akainu send Fuji and not Kizaru/green bull since he knows they are more on the same page as he is then Fuji? There is no way he didn't get to know how issho works in 2 years, so he knew he would fuck up<br><br>What does Capone mean with "ceasar will take you all along with him"? Could it be just mpanda fucking up as usual?<br><br>Why does akainu seem to not give a fuck about what kuzan is doing with BB? Come on, he was a fucking admiral so he's got to be fukkin stronk</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Doflamingo is controlling Kaido from the background  <br><br>Truly a puppetmaster</br></br></br>  <br>i kek'd</br>  <br> implying Shanks won't spank them like children and recruit them under his banner. <br><br><br>My guess is he knows Fuji despises the shichbukai system, so he would gladly revoke Law from his title. Also Aokiji warned Smoker about Dofllamingo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, sometimes he does ghost dicks/balls instead of drawing a full body.</br>  <br>According to the wiki he wants to capture Caesar for himself</br>  I know this website is shit, but at least you guys can read Aohige's translation instead of pandashit:<br>http://www.mangaspoiler.com/2015/07<wbr>/06/one-piece-793-spoiler-「ワンピース-ネタ<wbr>バレ」-第793話/</wbr></wbr></br>  Thank fuck you can filter trips  <br>It is to be expected. He has the royalties after all</br>  Blackbeard + his 10 giant captains = 11<br><br>Luffy + supernovas = 11, would this mean eventually all of them would be division commanders under Luffy? This doesn't mean each Strawhat won't fight each Blackbeard character, I'm sure they will, but something tells me he will also unite all the supernovas. Shanks will convert the Kidd alliance to their side, or Luffy will stop them before they fuck with Shanks.</br></br>   Doflamingo apparently controls most of the world's devil fruit trade <br> somehow his crew only had shitty ones </br>  <br>I know this wasn't Oda's intention but the one who came out the worst in all of this is Akainu.</br>  <br>What will the human do with the fallen dragon king ? Well, can you imagine ?</br>  <br> カポネ「おーおー、お仲間達は…割と活躍してんじゃねェか　シーザーは必<wbr>ず連れて帰るぞお前ら！！」</wbr> <br> our fellow supernovas are doing some good stuff <br> yes, we'll definitely bring Caesar to you </br></br></br>  <br><br> Fujitora use the title of Sabo to not deal with doflamingo, but the first is more strong.</br></br>  Could these two events be connected?  I don't understand this page. <br><br>What special thing did fujitora do that smoker couldnt do using his power in the navy?<br>He literally sat on his ass the whole fucking time.</br></br></br>  <br>I reckon it's just a building in the second panel.</br>  <br><br><br>Doesn't make sense. Luffy beat Doflamingo. Sabo could have done that.<br><br>And Fujitora couldn't do shit against the birdcage.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good catch anon.</br>  <br>I took it to mean that Smoker was saying "Even if I was an Admiral I wouldn't have the balls to do what Fujitora did"<br><br>Because he knows a magma fisting is coming</br></br></br>  <br>Would you be able to translate this?<br><br>キッド「あっと言う間に…先手をうたれたな…これは大金星だ！！」<br><br>アプー「ドフラミンゴは確かに裏でカイドウに通じてる」<br><br>ホーキンス「じゃあ奴を怒らせる事になるな…！！」<br><br>キッド「…これが作戦なら…つまりあいつらの目的は」<br><br>ホーキンス「やはり四皇」<br><br>アプー「百獣のカイドウか…！！」<br><br>キラー「狙いが被らなくてよかった　潰し合って無駄な戦力を使わずに済む　<wbr>おれ達の標的は四皇 “赤髪のシャンクス” だ！！」</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, Smoker is a weakling obviously.</br>  Pic related proof that Sanji and Co escaped the Big mom ship since he said we'll look for Caesar.<br><br><br>It's just a snowball not an eye.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks mate, now it makes much more sense</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Its actually just the rooftop of a building. Take a look at the trees, its probably somewhere in Wano, [spoiler/]which further hints at the upcoming Wano/Kaido arc</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your mom</br>  <br>I don't get what happens in the new chapter. Even after rearranging mangafox's shitty scan I still don't get the translations. They are all over the place</br>  Scanlation thread<br><br> What are you working on <br> Find people to help with project <br> Circlejerk </br></br></br></br>  <br>Also don't forget that the bulletin board exists:<br>tiny<br>url.com/ScanlationBulletin</br></br></br>   RGB   <br>My export action handles it and turns it greyscale and indexes it as well</br>  <br>But what's the point to level it in RGB?</br>  <br>There is no point. my scanner scans in RGB and I don't change it until the end. That is an adjustment layer</br>  <br>I remember seeing a scanlation general like 2 years ago and in the OP it had a guide on cleaning, translating etc got a link for it?</br>  <br>was it a link or an image?<br>There's this typesetting one that's kind of old:<br>There is this http://prettyanonymo.us/index.php/s<wbr>canlation-resources/anonblacks-type<wbr>setting-guide/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  What's the next most wanted job after translation?<br><br>I want to fill that demand. <br><br>Also, I want to be the guy that says 'stop putting fucking watermarks on the page it's not cool'.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think any respected group puts watermarks on pages still.</br>  <br>Cleaning and redrawing color pages</br>  <br>I'm not sure about it being the most saught after, but there's definitely a big shortage of  competent  cleaners. Depending on how good your raws are and how much care you want to take, it can range from being the least to the most time consuming task, so if you get good at making bad raws look good, you'll be a pretty big help.<br><br>Actually, thinking about it, most saught after may be redrawer in terms of recruitment demands that I see on scanlator websites and blogs, but not all groups care so much about their scans.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure but I ran into this group recently while browsing random manga. It's on every page in random places</br>  <br>that fucking bunny's face. like "what are you gonna do about it"</br>  <br><br>Ugh, doesn't that take artistic skill to erase and redraw a drawing? My hands are shaky enough as it is.</br></br>  <br>I remember that group. The bullshit they spout easily puts them among the worst drama faggots in scanlation.</br>  <br>Seems like a fairly clear indicator that their releases aren't worth reading.</br>  <br>I use the brush tool and it takes only a few seconds (shounen manga is awful since they have those huge SFXs)</br>  <br> color pages <br>Well, only if you do weekly shit with mag scans.<br><br> redrawer <br>Redrawing is the cleaner's job.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then just clean, or if you'd prefer, even just typeset to a passable standard. Anyone who isn't an ungrateful asshole won't complain unless you do a completely half-assed job of it. Unless you seriously mess things up, any help is appreciated.</br>  <br> Redrawing is the cleaner's job. <br>If you have a small group. It's two different "jobs" but one person can do both. i prefer to do both</br></br>  <br> Redrawing is the cleaner's job. <br>It depends on the group. I think it's reasonable to expect the cleaner to handle simple stuff, but if they're to tackle big, complicated redraws, it isn't very efficient to allocate so much work to one person.</br></br>  <br>If anyone wants the Desert Punk translation I could help. I'd need the french scans though cause I can't find it anywhere.</br>  Have you guys had any experience with special book/handheld scanners?  <br>that looks like its more for text</br>  <br>That is more for scanning for eBooks, it goes into an OCR program.</br>  <br>Apparently you only loose about about 5mm while scanning. If the quality is good it seems like a good alternative to destroying books, specially doujinshi.</br>  <br> complicated redraws, it isn't very efficient to allocate so much work to one person <br>That is true. However, I see people having a separate redrawer for even easiest shit all the time and that's laughable.</br></br>  <br><br>Are there any scan examples?</br></br>  How easy to rip are Amazon or CD Japan digital manga? I don't know anything about kindle or ebook readers, I just want to extract raw images from their digital releases.  Sorry for the thread hijacking, but i've been working on my own reader and I would like for you guys to test it out:<br><br>http://m3ow.moe/#DeadDead_ch019_pg1<wbr><br><br>It's generally used for webcomics so that's why its vertical.<br> <br>Would you read on this for extended periods?<br>Should the images be resized to fit screen or full-size (as is)?<br>Does it even work on your browser?</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Easy as fuck.</br>  <br>Explain further.</br>  <br>OMD (google OMD bitbucket) for ebookjapan, calibre+DeDRM for Amazon.</br>  <br>Showing all images at this resolution in a single page might be a bad idea for lengthy chapters. That aside works great.</br>  And bookwalker or KDDI bookpass?  <br>Looks great, and leave the images at their original size.</br>  <br>For bookwalker check archive, no idea about bookpass.</br>  <br>Cheers good man. Do you know if OMD works with Honto?</br>  <br>Nah, but there was something, check archive again.</br>  who needs a translator<br><br><br>I'm bored</br></br></br>  <br>Seems fine to me. I think you should change the page scrolling a little though so that using the Up, Down, Page Up and Page Down keys have the same sort of function as they do for and offline reader like Honeyview or CDisplay. The way they currently work for me feels a little counter intuitive, and it took me a minute to figure out exactly how to scroll through.</br>  <br>Turn off smooth scrolling shit or how's it called.</br>  <br>http://theporporbooksblog.blogspot.<wbr>[ spoiler][ /spoiler]com/search/label/plustek%2<wbr>0OpticBook%20scanner<br>This is for an older version though. I'm guessing newer ones must be a bit better.</br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Actually, thinking about it, I feel like I missed how exactly I was supposed to scroll through. Was it supposed to be using a mouse wheel? I'm using a laptop, so if that's the case I can't test it out.</br>  <br>Habanero has Seyman Douman stuff to translate.</br>  <br>Please tell your puchi typesetter to learn how to typeset already, it makes me want to puke whenever a new chapter comes out. Also stop overleveling it.</br>  <br>You can click on images to go to the next one or scroll<br><br><br>Great idea<br><br><br>I'm not a part of m@stersca.nz anymore, but I let him know</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As the other said, mouse scrolling is simply unbearable.<br>Seems to work fine on mobile, just needs a couple of tweaks.<br>For one the blank space to the left of the page is too annoying, also i couldn't figure out how to close the menu once i opened it,  although that might just be me being a tech retard. </br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm glad that what I read doesn't have any watermarks. Only self-important teenagers bother with watermarks.</br></br>   no leading zeroes in filenames <br> __MACOSX </br>  <br> __MACOSX <br>And it's fucking .rar on top of that.</br></br>  thanks for your guys efforts...  <br>As long as the images are in order, I don't mind, since i'm using programs to open it (usually on mobile).</br>  <br> As long as the images are in order <br>The problem is that depending on the type of sort you use they might not be in order.</br></br>   using honorifics  <br>Fucking why</br>  <br>Shit I never knew this existed, thank you. No more manually taking screenshots. <br>Are you sure there's one for Honto though? I can't find anything on the archive. <br>Guess I'll be switching to ebj for now.</br></br></br>  <br>Looks like I was wrong, someone's working on it, so it's not done yet. And yeah, ebj has the best resolution in comparison to others, so there's no reason to use anything else (except Amazon, they have some stuff in higher res and series not available on ebj).</br>  <br>how do you translate chan weeb</br>  Both of my redrawers are busy or away, and I only have one page left. Suffering.  <br>What page?</br>  <br>scrolling with the mouse is terrible. Otherwise it seems fine I guess? Like any other webreader.</br>  <br><br>This part.</br></br>  <br>I used honto since they would always give me coupons and I could get two ebooks for the price of one, or take advantage of the system and get one almost for free. I don't think ebj gives out any?</br>  <br>That looks easy, git gud.</br>  <br><br>you don't use honorifics when you talk to your jap friends?<br><br><br>what are you some kind of fag or something?</br></br></br></br></br>  Someone pick up Amanchu. I need more diving girls in my life.  Is there still no digital raw options available for Dengeki Daioh?  <br><br>I'm not a redrawer. Don't own a tablet. Can't do shit cap'n.</br></br>  <br><br>Nope. Many gigantic magazines that could certainly use an ebook don't have one available.</br></br>  <br>You don't need a tablet for that, brush+clone tool+ some small CAF + pen tool is more than enough for that. Hell, you don't need a tablet to redraw period, some people just find it easier because they're used to using one.</br>  <br>Damn it, I was hoping we'd be able to get good quick mag raws for Raildex if something as good as the Afternoon ebook raws existed for it.</br>    <br><br>The hair can't be cloned away.<br><br><br><br>You left in the line. Either way, without a redrawer, this is gonna take a while.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The hair can't be cloned away. <br>What do you think the brush tool is for?</br></br>  <br><br>Japan's slowly starting to embrace ebooks. I don't know how the process works, so I can't comment on how easy it'd be. I presume they fax each other the manuscripts anyway, but the ebooks generally look like they've been pre-cleaned (although you'll still see dust and junk from lazy scans).</br></br>  <br>Nah, ebj is "buy this shit during this event and get shitload of points" kind, as I see it. There are regular sales sometimes too.<br><br>Well, there's コミック電撃だいおうじ available, at least.</br></br></br>  <br>  コミック電撃だいおうじ <br> There are certain series that is exclusive only to the hardcopy <br>The Jap publishers seem to love the hard copy more. Not to mention, they throw in freebies/extras for it.</br></br></br>  Scanned an anthology by a Garo-era artist. Seems to be 80's pop-art, but I can't into art. Google says that he also gave a lecture at some point, and maybe contributed some art for a museum exhibition or two, but otherwise I can't find any information.<br><br>https://www.mangaupdates.com/series<wbr>.html?id=123180<br><br>Uploading here.<br><br>http://www.mediafire.com/folder/o5o<wbr>e8n2wydfwr</wbr></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> series <br>Extras and stuff I can understand because it seems to be common practice, but series? That's surely one big fuck you to the digital readers.</br></br>  <br>Trust me, it really hurts.<br><br>The Valvrave 4koma was one of the initial series of 電撃だいおうじ but was not on the digital release. They even have a disclaimer on it. I don't know if they still follow this practice.</br></br></br>  Is there a group that I can just ask for raws to practice on?  <br>You can just get raws from anywhere else.</br>  <br><br> manually taking screenshots <br><br>Jesus. I hope those raws weren't used for scanlation.</br></br></br></br>  <br>CDJapan uses the same thing as Neowing, which is in the archive. <br><br><br>Says he's an art director for Tezuka Osamu Museum. Interesting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope you're not reading Noragami then.</br>  Found a paywall bypass for Sokuyomi. Which is interesting. Man, messing with security is fun.  <br>I was wondering where the watermark was until I read the filename, it's an especially aggravating one at that</br>  <br>So ebJ webrips seem to be at 1200 px vertical, which is scanlation c. 10 years ago. I typically don't like to use anything less than 1600x. I know Comic Walker has a large format, are there any general ebook vendors with bigger than mobile image sizes?</br>  <br> Sokuyomi <br><br>Is this nothing but shoujo? I see shoujo as far as the eye can see.<br><br><br><br>Ebooks vary in quality, 1200-1600 usually. Amazon might have 2000px for some, but I wouldn't expect anything better from other stores.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>EBJ is usually the best, they actually do have like 1200px wide occasionally, but it probably depends on who sourced it to them. Amazon or Rakuten are probably in the same ballpark, probably better sometimes. But that's definitely near the higher end already.</br>  <br>Sokuyomi seems a lot bigger than that. They also have magazines, although it took a while to find. The only sad thing is the resolution is somewhat lacking, like 800 or 900 wide.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127763543 <br>Wrong thread?</br>  I have about 70-80% of Dowman's untranslated material in this box, who knows when I'll get around to scanning it. Maybe by then someone will be interested in translating some of it.  Man I suck at cleaning right now.  <br>Not <br>It requires time anon.</br></br>  CAN SOMEONE PLEASE JUST SCAN THIS SHIT ALREADY I'VE BEEN DYING TO READ IT FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS  <br>Didn't mean to quote<br/></br>  <br>Buy it and read it, faggot.</br>  <br><br>Pupa author, looks spooky. Just buy the ebooks for $4.</br></br>  <br>you should be careful as conversion between the modes does affect levels sometimes.</br>  <br><br>one long vertical scroll makes sense for webcomics that are drawn with that in mind, but comics that are meant to be read in print and laid out with pages side by side often make use of the fact in paneling.</br></br>  Gonna start work on Maou ch 5: Brown Elves edition any minute now.<br><br> JUST ONE MORE HOUR OF KERBALS I SWEAR </br></br>  <br>Time's up.</br>  <br>Why don't you describe what it's about, Keyman got picked up because the translator liked the anons' sale pitches.</br>  <br>Translate a series about a tomboy with good art pls</br>  <br>tom boy series are dumb tho</br>  <br> don't use boxes <br> making stroke 4 instead of 2 as original <br>Disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Fuck you I've got a Kerbal stuck on the Mun, you expect me to not launch a rescue mission for him?</br></br>  Can someone post the Raw of chapter 21 and 22(END) of Wallman?

I have tried quite a few different saving settings and want some ideas/suggestions on how we (as in the community) best save our releases.<br><br>Here is a comparison between a 'full' png, a 17 palette png, and a jpeg saved at 80 quality.<br><br>Any better application to save jpeg, and way to optimize it further?<br><br>Is the fact that I am using Berserk, or a huge ass image, somehow skewing the results?<br><br>I'll also post the full images so you can take a look at the details.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> full images <br>Had to slightly crop all the images at the top to get &lt;4MB.<br>Here is the full png image.</br></br></br>  <br>I tried cracking Honto but it's being a bitch.

Saved using my favorite jpeg tool projpeg.<br><br>Again, suggest alternatives if you want.

Mind sharing your method?<br><br>Also out of curiosity I did a 16p myself using photoshop and compared it and your versions to the original file (using Beyond Compare 3).<br><br>I say your method looks really good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This one  with photoshop 7 sfw<br>This one  with ph7 sfw after a little cleaning<br>This one  with ph7 sfw after a little cleaning and re-saving it with 4 bits in FotoCanvas for shit and giggles<br>After that I use what they call pngpress (different from program with the same name).</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder why we get so different file sizes in your first image. Could you post what settings you used in SFW?<br><br>Mine are in the image. Followed by PNGOUTWIN. (since I am on a PC and I assume pngpress demand MAC, I can't test that app).<br><br>I can understand getting different file size if you cleaned/leveled the page, so I wont ask anything for the other two examples. (Just focusing on saving techniques atm)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Could you post what settings you used in SFW? <br>Same as yours actually. Exactly.<br> and I assume pngpress demand MAC <br>No, it's a win program.<br>Here I found it for you http://www.mediafire.com/download/b<wbr>79t38ybbzq1p5e/PngPress+v0.5.exe (it's a rar exe)</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you just converted me, sir.<br><br>default fit width would be the one thing i'd want.<br>zooming in the browser works for it but then the ui elements blow up and annoy me</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm actually using an old version of it because I made a lot of UI tweaks and don't want them to get overridden. I only read on Batoto so it isn't that big of a deal though.</br>  <br>yeah i'd probably want to do some customization myself if i knew how.</br>  <br>Seems I need to download Photoshop 7 to test some things.<br><br>Some things I just now tested;<br>- Forcing Photoshop CS5 to use the palette your image used. It turns out PS7 and CS5 will do this in slightly different way (PS7 will output the smaller file, at least in this case).<br>(Maybe adobe changed the algorithm used to get better image quality or something, I don't know).<br><br>- After trying both pngoutwin (xtreme setting) and pngpress it seems pngoutwin ouputs the smaller size, at least when I tried both your and my p16 images (1.83vs1.79 and 2.01vs1.96).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not sure if one could draw any big assumptions regarding image quality, but it seems PS7 favored lighter tones in this case, with CS5 picking more dark palette colors.<br> <br>Better stop ranting about this now, before I bore someone to death..</br></br></br>  <br>I use 32-pallet index .png and save in 1200p - 1800p. I really don't want a single page over 500kb, I know it seems like a little but I'd rather have it speed and legible than saving in highest quality possible</br>  <br>AFAIK CS improved png saving, though I never tried to compared them. And for some reason my CS6 throwing an error when I try to save this big file for web.<br><br>Also, ps7 had selective. Sorry.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for the input, everybody.</br>  <br>I wanted to do Majimoji Rurumo but can't find a translator</br>  <br> CS6 throwing an error when I try to save this big file for web <br>CS5 also throws me an error when saving such big images. However the only time I have seen actual errors in the image is when I save images with big white areas.<br>For instance Berserk_v34_p044-045, so I had to use pngquant instead to save the image with a limited palette.<br><br> Also, ps7 had selective. <br>Ah that explains it. Just now tested and got an identical output files as you with just changing that one setting as well as turning dither to zero (which also reduces the file size).<br><br> Sorry. <br>No problem, now I have a good reason to read up on 'selective' to find out the pros and cons</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Look on MangaHelpers.</br>  <br><br> Implying all those implications <br><br>m8 pls.</br></br></br></br>  <br> After trying both pngoutwin (xtreme setting) and pngpress it seems pngoutwin ouputs the smaller size, at least when I tried both your and my p16 images (1.83vs1.79 and 2.01vs1.96). <br>Yeah, pngout at extreme making it smaller. But it require much more time for it, and with smaller scans (i.e. x1200-x1800) difference will be no more than 1-5 kb at best while waiting time will be at least twice as more. With one file it might not be a big problem, but when you have to deal with 50-1000+...</br></br>  <br> 32-pallet index .png and save in 1200p - 1800p <br>1800 should work for most manga. But saving in 1200 pixels (unless magazine raw) in 2015 would seems kind of strange to me.</br></br>  <br> But it require much more time for it <br>Yea, its always a trade-off, and those few kb might not be worth it most of the time.</br></br>  <br>Thank you based anon. There are actually 2 chapters translated on there that aren't released.<br>I'll buy the raws now then</br></br>  <br>Cool. You might want to send the translator a PM to let him know you're doing it so he'll start to translate more, it got put on hold because no one cared enough to work on it.</br>  <br> it got put on hold because no one cared enough to work on it. <br>Really?<br>I'll definitely let him know then</br></br></br>  HoneyView has ugly fucking default filters/scaling options that can't be turned off, but CDisplay sucks at handling nested archives. Is there no middle ground?  <br>Even more if you just have to deal with png saved in RGB and just want to make them grayscale and maybe reduce size a little after that. I use crushpng for it and for example getting 62 files of Fujiyama-san wa Shishunki (chapters 45-47) from 61.8 to 23,7 in ~1 minute. They won't get much smaller (if at all) after that anyway, so there's no point in wasting time.</br>  <br>I use mangameeya7 I don't know if it will fix those problems that you said but it's been great for me</br>  <br>No problem.<br> If he says he's too busy with other stuff, blame me. I'm working on like three or four things with him. </br></br>  <br>Your efforts are greatly appreciated. Honto has a lot of ebooks campaigns.</br>  How do I get past broken adfly links? A self-important group has their releases behind them ("not allowed to rehost anywhere else, hurrr"). I put v2. in front of the link, still broken.  <br>Some guy cracked Honto on e-hentai. It outputs to a T-Time book apparently. At least when they did it. <br><br>https://forums.e-hentai.org/index.p<wbr>hp?showtopic=29160&amp;st=0<br><br>I saw some a thread just now about a guy looking about breaking Cypherguard PDF and just happened upon it. By doing so, he also broke tons of other people. Interesting, does warrant some investigation. Reverse engineering assembly is a bitch.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Honto uses both epub and T-Time books. It would be great if this guy found a solution for the epub files as well, if they use a different method from the TT files.</br>  <br>I'm guessing he just inputs in whatever encoded format it came in, and it just pops out regardless of the format. From reading the thread, the reason he doesn't want to share his method appears to be so he can get more credit off e-hentai galleries himself.</br>  <br>Also these un-screenshotable, un-VMable PDF sound really amusing, I really want to just crack one for the hell of it.</br>  <br>How much credit could you want? What do you even do with it?<br>I have a shitton of credits from uploading a couple galleries and it's just sitting there, growing every day.</br></br>  I already asked this in the Gangsta. thread, but that's pretty much devolved into a troll thread, so I'll just link it here.<br><br>  <br><br>Help a guy out, please.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Too bad. All I've managed to do are screenshots. I'd kill for a way to directly extract the files.</br>  <br>Who knows. E-peen, I guess. I got more than enough credit playing Hentaiverse when I was bored for a week.</br>  <br>It looks like people have been trying for years, and this guy looks like the only person to have ever publicly broken it.</br>  <br>It doesn't look like it. A guy would hope that the measly amount of licensed manga would get scanned, but nope. No one cares to even rip digital manga which eliminates the time to scan it, and some of the price. Seriously, I myself have ripped a few and there's only a few people who even bother altogether.</br>  <br><br>You can use credits/hath to pay for translations, editing, scanning, etc. and also buy features in the gallery. It's a fiat currency designed so that people actually contribute. If you think about it too hard, they really are worthless, but everyone has given them value (hence fiat currency), so it's understandable that some people might want to become billionaires if they have a method. Think of all the doujinshi scanlations you could "buy."</br></br>  <br>Also, complaints about shit digital offerings, or bad resolution, something is usually better than nothing.</br>  <br><br>I don't think many people know how to rip licensed scans. Iirc there was only one guy who was doing weekly jump rips, and I don't think he wanted to share his method.</br></br>  <br>Ripping weekly jump is easy, just look in the archive. For other stuff, just buy it on Kindle or some other store that's already got a ripper available.</br>  <br>People do the stupidest ways of doing it from what I know. Some people use fiddler and shit like that, when in fact they can DL the entire zip file of images if they knew how. I've tried explaining how to do it, but I guess it's too complicated for the normal person. I would've thought basic URL hacking wasn't beyond the normal guy, but apparently not.</br>  <br>Also note, this wasn't actually an option until last year. Before that, it actually was annoying to rip Viz manga from Viz (but it only really needed a cookie). <br><br><br>Unfortunately Kindle and Kobo rips aren't the same, and I don't mean in terms of resolution. Viz has better redraws of some of their series which it seems they keep to themselves. So one isn't necessarily better than the other. I know that /co/ guys ripping Bakuman opted for the Viz rips for this reason.</br></br></br></br>  <br> hen in fact they can DL the entire zip file of images if they knew how <br>All the methods I've seen have been one image at a time and I haven't really had the time to play round with it. Any chance you'd try to explain one more time, anon?</br></br>  <br><br>Then I guess it comes down to who has the money and is willing to buy the ebooks. I know that you can refund Kindle books, but I think they'll crack down on you if you try that shit too often.</br></br>  <br>I generally share any ebooks I rip when I want to use them myself in scanlation, but those are Japanese only by default.<br><br><br> Also note, this wasn't actually an option until last year. Before that, it actually was annoying to rip Viz manga from Viz (but it only really needed a cookie). <br>Well that explains why I didn't see anything about getting a zip file.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also Google Play allows refunding. I was going to try doing that with Dementia 21 and found some other flaw in their system (which meant I only bought some, not all).<br><br><br>http://www.vizmanga.com/manga/get_m<wbr>anga_url?manga_id=1140&amp;device_id=1<br><br>Replace the manga_id and set the device_id=1 which will cause it to return the iOS zip. Other numbers do different things, device_id=3 is the default I think with the reader. You have to be logged in like usual.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I forgot all about Dementia 21. I wonder how many other series quietly get an ebook release. For example, Cobra.<br><br>www.amazon.com/COBRA-Blue-Rose-Buic<wbr>hi-Terasawa-ebook/dp/B0111G81AC/ref<wbr>=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=<wbr>1436223130&amp;sr=1-1</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>I should say that the method worked at least during the 3 or 4 weeks WSJ was free, so I don't see any reason it doesn't work in general. It also worked for the Viz manga I bought to test once.</br>  <br> Dementia 21 <br><br>Already ripped.</br></br></br>  <br>I saw that as well. Global Bookwalker just put up a bunch. Kaiji part 1, although done fairly badly. But fairly badly is better than nothing at all, I mean like how did we ever have DUWANG. <br><br>I was actually in the middle of ripping Cynical Hysterie Hour which is on Rakuten. Free 450 yen for each new account. There's also this F manga which I was considering ripping.<br><br><br>By me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Usually once digishit riped no one cares to properly scan such series after that. Shitty digital raws regressing scanlation back to 00-x. Just look at this  guy.</br>  <br>Is there any digital color Toriko raws yet?</br>  <br> no one cares to properly scan <br>Thing is, it doesn't meant that someone was going to scan it in the first place.</br></br>  <br>Thank you, based anon. Going to have to remember that.</br>  <br>Possibility wasn't zero. But day one, or even week one rips making it into negative numbers territory.</br>  <br>That's a fair enough complaint. That's what happens when people aren't fussed over mediocrity (or well less than that). <br><br>For the most part, digital by the major publishers isn't much worse than scanlation, if at all. Translation isn't that bad these days and there's certainly no Tokyopop to complain about. Editing is probably worst still, as well as typesetting. At this point I could say, you can still use the scripts, but well, most people would just say, good enough.</br></br></br>  <br> and there's certainly no Tokyopop to complain about <br>I've got bad news for you anon.</br></br>  <br>Oh yes, I heard. For now, at least.</br>  <br>True, but let's be honest. It's either digital shit or shitty scan done on that cheap scanner situation, if we're talking about public. For actual, good scan you have to go to people who scan manga on general basis, not trying to net something in the public.<br><br>I don't think they'll stay alive for long.</br></br></br>  <br>All I hope is that Japan steps up on the resolution. Fucking hell, some of those images are still for ants.</br>  <br>For digital, that is.</br>  <br>They using jpgs with low quality, pdfs, low resolution scans (fuck you, alphapolis, fuuuuuuuk yoooooooouuuu!), and all other methods that making it harder to read or even just watch.<br>It's like they hate digital distribution and making sure that readers will get worst possible deal. Oh, wait...</br></br>  <br>Funnily enough, I bet you 90% of the time, they have the full size images on the same server. And they lose all benefits of smaller pages with all their DRM bullshit, base64 encoding and shitty readers which will literally download a file 3 times before it actually loads.</br>  <br>Japan is actually doing that, at least on ebj, but it doesn't mean that they're going to upgrade old stuff that's been released in lower res.<br><br>I'm not sure, that's quite retarded amount of data that has to be resized every single damn time for every user.</br></br></br>  <br>Eycuse the stupid questions, but since the scanning topic came up. How to I properly scan and save? I've done some scans, but reading this thread it seems I coulddo better in the future, especially the saving part.<br><br>I gather that I should always scan in grayscale and save as png, but the correct settings are not quite clear. I use windows7, cs4 and a canon lide 210 if that matters.</br></br></br>  <br>*Excuse</br>  <br>No, I mean they store it separately in compressed form, alongside. Although I'm aware of some that do it on the fly - this isn't as bad as it sounds with a good caching system I'm sure. Sometimes URL hacking gets you the files, but it's a complete shot in the dark most of the time.</br>  <br>I wouldn't put it past them. Nips can't into computers and coding. Just look at their sites and readers. Or look at amazon.jp<br>http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00YQMBE<wbr>GC/<br>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images<wbr>/I/91ggujmuWPL._SL1500_.jpg<br>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images<wbr>/I/91ggujmuWPL.jpg</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Well, I sent him a message. I hope he's okay with it</br>  <br><br>Scan with IrfanView, make sure all of your scanner's adjustment settings are turned off/neutral, make sure the scanner glass bed is clean, make sure the paper is clean, save as .tif and let the editor handle the settings after.</br></br>  <br> can't into computers and coding <br>Mostly. But the niggas who did it well, know what the fuck they are doing.</br></br>  <br>I tell new typesetters to avoid text boxes as it keeps them from getting lazy and relying too much on the automatic lining of text boxes. In the end, if you're lining the text manually and it looks good, it doesn't matter what you're doing. Again, just to keep new people from getting bad habits.<br><br>Physically altering bubbles is totally fine; I've done it a few times, too. However, a lot of TSers don't know how to do that without fucking up the pixels or making it look natural, so I didn't cover image editing in the guide. Again, if it looks good, go for it, man.<br><br>I do know about layer masks, but it's quicker and easier for me personally to just use the erase tool (E -&gt; click -&gt; enter -&gt; erase -&gt; done) instead of having to do additional mousework. I almost never change text position or content after finishing a block, so I never see the need to go out of my way to put down a layer mask. But again, if it works for you and looks good, knock yourself out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He'll be fine with it, he just gets annoyed when people ignore the big red "please shoot me a note when you're using my translations" at the top of them.<br><br><br>Layer masking can be done by just clicking one of the little buttons in the Layers panel and then pretending your brush is an eraser.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That makes some sense as for backup. Still shitload of data though. Assuming that one tank in full res is, let's say 700MB for example, all manga on ebj is taking 51.7TB. Or is it not that much these days? I honestly don't know.</br>  <br><br>I'm just waiting for Google to invent some new ridiculous compression algorithm that revolutionizes the internet.</br></br>  <br>Thanks for the advice. I'll try that the next time.</br>  <br>I guess it's just as fast, then, since you're gonna be using your mouse to mask anyways, but for me personally, it's just quicker to erase, since my hands are on the keyboard already.<br><br>I'd be down for making a corollary to the guide with alternative techniques. If you guys have any TS advice you'd want to shove in the guide, I'd be totally down to making one more.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Make sure that Irfanview is selecting your scanner's default TWAIN, and not whatever bullshit software came with your scanner.</br></br>  <br>It's got to be stored somewhere. EBJ I can tell you is particularly retarded since it has like multiple delivery mechanisms and different DRM alternatives. They store at least 3 or 4 versions and the original probably doesn't make much of a difference. EBJ is one of the bigger vendors (which means they usually know their shit better, but experience has not always confirmed this), so perhaps less likely to have the original files there.</br>  <br> relying too much on the automatic lining of text boxes <br>I'm a little confused about this. When you say this, you mean people just paste the text into the box and leave it as is?</br></br>  <br> You set cropping and levels, scan this page, and then just change page and scan again without changing anything. Levels will be the same for every page, which is good. <br> For example (using epson software): you place page on scanner, outline that area with something, then preview page in scanner http://i.imgur.com/mHhA9CO.jpg set cropping and levels (and then save those parameters just in case), then scan that page http://i.imgur.com/nIuLrLO.jpg (same page without levels http://i.imgur.com/xahIlqy.jpg), and then without closing preview or changing anything, turn/place another page on scanner in that outlined area and press “scan” again http://i.imgur.com/EGK5MCG.jpg. For all intends and purposes, scanner will be thinking that you scan the same page again and again. <br><br>As for saving, it depends what you will be doing with it. Of course better save them as grayscale png/tiff, but it can take a lot of space and might be not reasonable to upload/download for you or for other peoples, so in that case use jpg.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They either copy and paste it from the script or type it in manually, but let the box/program do the lining.</br>  <br> (E -&gt; click -&gt; enter -&gt; erase -&gt; done) <br>I use M -&gt; click&amp;drag -&gt; F2.</br></br>  <br> type it in manually <br>I refuse to believe that there are people like that, unless they do translation and typesetting on the fly.</br></br>  <br>Noted, thanks.<br><br><br>That what I've been doing so far, but it seems that leveled scans and jpg files are not that popular with the people who have to edit the pages later.</br></br></br></br>  <br> unless they do translation and typesetting on the fly <br>I do that for a few series that are so easy to translate I can just look at the bubble and type what comes into my head.</br></br>  <br>Basically, yeah. Lining is how you separate a block of text line by line. There are tons of ways to do it so it looks nice, and a lot of ways you can fuck it up - for example, ending a sentence in the middle of a line. <br><br>The problem with text boxes (and the reason I tell new TS to stay away from them) is the algorithm for automatically breaking a block of text into lines is shitty as all hell, pic related.<br><br><br>I actually type everything in manually for a few reasons:<br>- editing my translation on the fly<br>- personally easier to hit return after typing versus adding returns after pasting<br>- used to doing it that way after 7 years<br><br>It's pretty pants-on-head retarded in terms of speed, but I type pretty fast (120wpm) so I haven't really had too much of an issue with it, besides one or two typos every once in a while.<br><br>I'd definitely recommend copy-pasting from the corrected script and adding carriage returns manually. Smarter, faster.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but it seems that leveled scans and jpg files are not that popular with the people who have to edit the pages later <br>That depends on how much leveed, how big resolution, and how high jpg quality. If anything, jpg is a last resort even at 600+ dpi, so if you or people who will download it don't have any troubles with big files then there's no reason to not use png/tiff. Just pack chapters into archives and with maximum compression.<br>As for levels, you just have to find page with weak black/white screentones (preferable on one page and set levels so they don't remove most faint printed spots and then scan all pages with those levels.</br></br></br>  Can anyone please translate Umareru Kachi? I've been eagerly waiting for the suicide scene of the autistic girl but thanks to Mankitsu Slowscans I have to wait at least 12 months or more for a translated chapter.  <br>8TB Seagates are $272 on sale right now. 8 of them in a RAID 10 or RAID 50 configuration would cost $2,176. that's just assuming you already have the servers to install them in.<br><br><br>i'd recommend any novice cleaner who thinks they know photoshop to stop being smug and go look up all the shortcuts and memorize them. all of them. it saves time. then teach themselves all the tools they don't use often. they likely aren't used often because the user doesn't know the best time to use them.<br><br>teach them how to use Actions if you didn't already. they're very valuable since you can hotkey your actions and you can literally record any incessant set of actions you'd like. i set up F3 to stroke the current path since i use stroked paths incessantly while redrawing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That makes sense. Thank you.</br>  <br> go look up all the shortcuts and memorize them <br>That's actually one of the first things one should learn. Basics are important, and I don't think those stupid guides even mention that you should know this shit.</br></br>  <br>At higher resolutions and higher quality settings, the effects of .jpg compression aren't that bad, still it's preferable to save everything lossless.<br>When doing scans for a group, check if the pages are handed to a cleaner who prefers to level the pages himself. If that's the case, then just give him the unaltered raws (not leveled, not filtered, not cropped, not rotated).<br>If you do public scans, you can either level the pages or just not bother doing any work and upload the unaltered raws.</br></br></br>  <br>Agreed. I can get to almost all the tools I need with my left hand (B, E, D, X, S, T) and use my mouse with the right. Saves so much time. I've also got actions for stuff like stroke, white text with black stroke, drop shadow, etc.</br>  <br>Text boxes are magical things: you set it, paste text into it, and _then_ align it manually like you would do without box. In many cases you have to separate one or two words for it to align automatically very neatly. Also, use hanging punctuation.<br> doesn't do a good job <br> example with different font sizes <br>No shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've got Actions and some shortcuts in my guide.<br><br>I don't know how anyone could clean or TS without using shortcuts or actions. My T and V keys get so much fucking use.</br></br></br>  <br>the target audience for a tutorial is usually a complete beginner.</br>  <br> look up all the shortcuts and memorize them <br> not making your own shortcuts <br>I bind things like image resizing to F3-12. More convenient.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, and since it doesn't cover the basics, in the end you get not really competent editors because of it.</br>  <br>Typesetting and related things aren't really cleaner/redrawer territory.<br>Occasionally they can work together, like:<br>- CL/RD recreates pattern for patterned text<br>- for text that needs to be behind some drawing, the CL/RD can make an overlying layer with the drawing<br><br>Still, hotkeys and automations save time for both, cleaning and typesetting.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you again. I usually do public scans. I think I'll leave them unaltered just in case.</br>  <br>the only other thing i can think of possibly covering is defining patterns/using pattern overlays to add some style to your type, or using brushes to mask your type to add effect to them. plain type on a page is boring. you have to be creative. i felt plenty of times that i was ruining the aesthetics just by localizing an author's work.</br>  just a test scan. pic related is what I did before and this is the unaltered tiff version: http://i.imgur.com/0jSpkwv.jpg  <br><br> unaltered tiff <br> posts jpg </br></br></br>  <br>...

If you've got issues 4 and 5, I could use the Godspeed color pages in those. I've also been wanting to read the new series from the author of Instant Bullet, I think it started last month? That might be a bit much if you don't want to scan a full chapter though.<br>Anyway, if you want settings, for the color pages I usually go with 600dpi, all filters turned off, saved as jpg. Black and white pages I go down to 300dpi, although in this case I really just want to read it so lower is fine.</br></br>  <br>I can do that if you can wait until tomorrow.

I think you're all overreacting with this.</br>  <br>I feel more sorry for the guy whose head will no longer be attached to the rest of his body.</br>  Nah, Iida will be ok, but the the other hero will surely die and the school will put the blame on Iida, because he was aware of Stain´s modus operandi and acted with negligence.  <br>Holy fuck, all of them are fat except the one with the weird ears.<br><br>FeelsBadMan.</br></br></br>  <br>Why did Kaminari get a fake tan?</br>  <br>my penis is too hard</br>  <br> ida knocked out <br> stain puts the balme on him somehow manipulating the scene. <br> ida is detained and blamed for stain's murderes, including his brother. <br> his familly despises him. <br> he is alone in the maximum security ward of the prision, nobody but deku and his bros believe him. <br> &gt;when they prove his innocence it's too late.<br> Ida has been already consumed by anger and desire of vengeande over the system. <br> he has turned into a villain. <br> he is released and supossedily goes back to the main group. <br> he has joined the vilain allianceand is acting as an insider for them. <br/></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So much for that helmet.

And how could anyone blame Iida for the murder of his bro when he was participating in a tournament miles away? <br><br>Your scenario is full of plotholes.</br></br></br>  <br>his quirk is being fast.<br><br> flash coudl do it appearing to be on both places </br></br></br>   ida can run as fast as flash <br> is a jobber </br>  <br>Yeah, I'm not under the impression Iida can move even remotely as fast as the Flash.</br>  <br>Way to make best girl look like a fucking lard.</br>  <br>but do the authorities know that?<br><br>they can accuse him of retrainign his power to not wake up suspicions.</br></br></br>  <br>He can run real fast for 2 seconds and then his engines overload. He's definitely not like the flash.<br><br><br>He's shown his potential in the tournament when he enabled Todoroki to nab Deku's headband.

Did All Might ever hit the first Nomou on the head (brain)?</br>  <br>This, I like this.<br><br>I like BnHA to turn intoa darker manga than it initially seemed.<br><br>Man up Deku!<br><br>Now I want to see flashbacks from All Might or other heroes to see what horrors they have faced.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will Ochako get Griffith'd in front of Deku?</br>  <br>Shigaraki's proportions are really weird in this pic.</br>  <br>Hhahhaha that shit would be funny</br>  <br>That would probably make them a vegetal, and we know how it worked with Superman.</br>  <br>I have a feeling that at some point one of Deku's classmates will get turned into one of these things.</br>  <br>That's amazing, but what does he say?</br>  <br>Sadrock or Octobro would make good Noumus</br>  <br>Awesome</br>  <br>YES, SHIT ABOUT TO GET REAL</br>  <br>We resident evil now.</br>  Summary from AS:<br><br>"Looks like Deku and Gran Torino decide to change locations for their training, taking a train to Shibuya. Meanwhile, it seems that the "normal" hero guiding Iida already guessed the boy's intentions. <br><br>Let's see, if I'm not mistaken, Shigaraki went to bust Noumu out of prison, while Stein continues his hero hunt. Speaking of Noumu, he looks different now, apparently having the appearance of 3 different people (really not sure on this part). After busting out, Noumu rushes into the train station where Deku and Gran Torino are at, and now a battle ensues, with the old man facing off against the monster.<br><br>Meanwhile, Iida finally encounters Stein who's in the middle of his hero hunt, and attacks him, calling himself Ingenium. Yet another clash between hero and villain takes place."</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This chapter is defnietly delivering.</br></br>  <br>If this shit is true then i expect some awesome fighting from the Deku and Gran Torino combo</br>  <br>hmmm those don't sound TOO fake.<br><br>But I don't think Ida mcan do much against Stain, also 5% deku will be pretty useless on normu, and gran torino has alrady shown his age.... how will they both handle these encounters?<br><br>it smells fishy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, are these guys all brain dead too? Poor people</br>      <br><br>Holy fucking shit and thats why this is number fucking uno.

I re-reading it now but I can't seem to find what the new pages were.<br><br>Also back then it was mentioned that the mangaka fixed that plot hole about Hatsune(that support girl) escaping from Minetas balls. <br>Can post that the new page? Or atleast link that?<br>All im able to find was deku using his jetpack again and nothing about how they escape the ball.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Im the only one who thinks Hands guy will be turned into a Noumu monster after he fails several times?  Shigaraki is anti-deku, Stain killed Iida's brother. This makes me wonder if there will be more villains that have a connection to the main cast.  <br>No that will never happen. For one his goal is to kill all might which I do see happening, two even if he didn't manage it then you still can't really blame him, three why basically kill him off and make him a underling to a knew villain.</br>  Do you guys realize that barely one month passed in the manga since the beginning of deku's school life?  <br>Why would you think something stupid like that? He's clearly been chosen for a special role by the voice from the TV.</br>  <br> Why would you think something stupid like that?

Its a petty much confirmed fact that Miku is going to be more rock and cooler then Niwaka. Natsuki gets a kick out of watching Riina squirm but it will be good to see her guiding little niwaka into the right direction in regards to rock</br></br>  <br>Even if TakeP is several times better just for the fact that he seems to have a decent backstory and development, but I still like AkaP.<br><br>It's funny how they're trying to salvage him by giving him more prominence in the new Nomakes for the 765 re-airing, but it's not as if anyone is actually translating those.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The PV had an unknown voice (Presumably Natsuki) saying "That partner of yours is pretty cool huh?"<br><br>That might be Natsuki talking to Riina whereas she refers to Miku as the "Cool One".<br><br>By Natsuki's standards, anybody who is passionate about their goals and confident in who they are is totally rocking. And Miku and her passion for her Cat Persona fits that bill.<br><br>Really, Natsuki refers to anybody BUT Riina as cool and rocking. <br><br><br> but it's not as if anyone is actually translating those. <br><br>Well, I can give a brief rundown of the first NoMake+ The circumstances of AkaP's recruitment were as follows:<br><br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wb<wbr>xbQ86iDGA&amp;feature=youtu.be</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>- 765 is falling on hard times and really need more help<br>- Takagi is wishing for a Ray of Hope, someone suddenly knocks on the office door<br>- It's the goddamn delivery man<br>- Takagi is disappointed, but another person enters. An AkaP with spaghetti spilling everywhere enters<br>- Takagi laughs maniacally. He decides on AkaP as the "chosen one"<br>- Takagi gives a weird ass interview<br>- AkaP reveals that he wanted to to be someone who cheers people up and gives hope. Most notably, he found great interest and admiration of people in the entertainment industry. But he was ultimately a talentless hack when it comes to creative work, be it singing, dancing or writing.<br>- He still wanted to work in the industry that cheers people up and gives hope though, so he just reckoned that he should work as staff at a talent agency. So that at the very least, he can help someone become what he aspired to be.<br>- After realizing he gave such a sappy story, AkaP spilled spaghetti everywhere again and as he packed up his things in embarassment, he asked Takagi to forget everything he said<br>- Takagi said fuck that, you're now the Producer for this Agency.<br><br>And with some additional hiccups and pressuring from Takagi, AkaP became the Producer for 765.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I hope we get a scene with Natsuki with her hair down. My heart would not be able to handle it  and my dick would explode. </br></br>  <br>  But he was ultimately a talentless hack when it comes to creative work, be it singing, dancing or writing. <br><br>I'd like to believe there are some audition tapes with AkeP floating around and he and Ritsuko drink to their failures pre-preduction.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if Akabane is jealous that his Producer is so extremely less popular than Takeuchi's. Not to mention how Takeuchi is ikemen as fuck while he is old and busted.</br>  <br>In all likelihood, it's probably just the name the guy gave his own custom unit within the mobage.</br>  <br>Riina to Natsuki is like a lowly cultist to their patron deity, constantly looking for ways to appease them only to fail miserably. Riina idolizes Natsuki to the point where she could just about suck the farts out of her ass just to get in her good graces.</br>  <br>Natsukichi just wants Riina to realize that real Rock is having confidence in who you are rather than latching on to whatever warped notions of being "Cool" or "Rocking" that Riina has. ;_;</br>  <br> Nana-roku-gou Pro <br><br>Good job AkaP.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd think he'd be more jealous that the CG VA's actually like Takeuchi more than the 765 VA's originally (I read something somewhere about him being incessantly teased).<br><br>We will never know</br></br></br>  <br><br> tfw <br>If its any consolation I still like him he was pretty based and cute in his mannerisms.</br></br></br>  <br>So did they fuck or what?</br>  <br>i like to think so</br>    <br>Onee-chan is kayfabe.</br>  Just came here to say Momoka never.  <br>Final boss of the show, calling it.</br>  <br><br> Momoka was controlling StepmotherP the whole time </br></br>  <br>Its already hot; lets just play with some water.</br>  <br>I'd like to believe Ritsuko made all the 765 girls watch as her fuck P-san to remind them that P-san is not a romantic option and that he's taken.</br>  <br><br>Would this be a daily occurrence, and do the idols masturbate while watching?</br></br>  <br>What else can they do when faced with such a situation?</br>  <br>report it to the police?</br>  <br>Don't be silly</br>  <br>summer fun cakes!</br>  <br>hahaha, there are two old lady who play like children here.</br>  <br> But he was ultimately a talentless hack when it comes to creative work, be it singing, dancing or writing. <br><br>If only he had met Side-M P, he would've drawn out the latent talent hiding inside AkaP.<br><br>Just imagine, in a parallel world, AkaP might've been a 315 idol.<br><br> He would've had to deal with taking Dick up his ass every other day, but come on, it's not like 50% of all AkaP fanart aren't already that. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and there are many little girls that prance around like sluts, your point?</br>      <br>Best unit</br>  <br>I want to touch Arisu with my fingers.</br>  Thread needs more images of best girl  <br>Too true</br>  Who is the target audience for this thing?  <br>On it.</br>  <br>Siscons</br>  <br>NEETs</br>  <br><br>Either I'm blind or I'm not seeing Rin in those images</br></br>  <br>Sure</br>  <br>Grandma please</br>  <br>At least you aren't blind.</br>  <br>Slut-chan pls</br>  <br>okay</br>  Yuka is the cutest   every Uzukifag ever.jpg   <br><br>Uzubutt is lewd on her own, sexualization on my part not needed</br></br>  <br>Azusa &gt; Yuka<br><br>Come at me, osu-nyan</br></br></br>  <br>Too big. Get a breast reduction.</br>  <br><br>When will Azusa get married?</br></br>  Who's ready to be healed in two hours?  I know I am.<br>Just look at this comfy OP.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=UNj<wbr>HxhljAck</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>   Using the same image as the last thread <br> 3.78mb png edition <br><br>come on lad</br></br></br>  <br>Not to mention he was so excited to be the first one to make a new thread he made it before the old one even hit bump limit.</br>  Reminder that Miki is best girl.  So yeah, I'll ask that again. Where did the assumption heli pilot was infected with zombie virus came from? Maybe he had some problems with health and just wanted to inject some medicine?  <br>Wrong thread? This is the healing anime Gakkou Gurashi thread.</br>  <br>   Where did the assumption heli pilot was infected with zombie virus came from? <br> Context. You're reading a zombie manga. We've seen that a syringe contains medicine to treat the zombie virus. We know that the way the zombie virus works here is that it works on living people and makes them turn (like when Kurumi was turning while under the blanket). It only makes sense that the pilot was using the medicine, but was too late, started to turn, crushed the syringe, and crashed the copter. </br></br>  Best and cutest teacher  <br> Geenki deesu </br>  Odds on seeing a zombie at all in episode 1?  <br>0%. This is a healing SoL.</br>  <br>0%<br><br>Are you still in the wrong thread?</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry. I meant to say delinquent.</br>  <br> 100% <br><br> Did you read the first episode spoilers? </br></br></br>  How do I live watch?  <br>I haven't checked anything about this show, but going by OP's picture, is this going to be as healing as NNB?</br>  <br>You could say that.</br>  Gonna send people direct to the first episode without telling them anything about it..  <br>It'll be NNB, Aria, Kiniro Mosaic, Hidamari Sketch, and Gochiusa all rolled up into one.</br>  I'm surprised how close Miki and Kurumi got to each other. At first I was worried Miki was only going to be close to Yuuki. I'm glad that wasn't the case.  NB is streaming this, right?   le ebin healing maymay ruse   Have you prepared an epic surprised post that will appear on a thread screenshot?  <br>i hope no delinquents appear in episode 1!<br><br>i want my healing anime to be bully free!</br></br></br>  <br>Someone said it a few threads ago and I agree. I really these two's interactions and relationship.</br>  <br>It's on the schedule.</br>  <br>love, I mean. I love their interactions and relationship.</br>  <br>These are how generals start.</br>  <br>Chained threads aren't generals<br>Threads with subjects aren't generals<br><br>If we started having a standardized OP with links to information and shit, started actually calling them generals or maybe even started numbering them, then they'd be a general thread. Here's an example of a general: https://archive.moe/a/thread/109366<wbr>948/#109366948</wbr></br></br></br></br>  Don't make her eat that, Rii-san. She's stuffed.    <br> Those faces  <br><br>How can anyone doubt she's the bear</br></br></br>  <br>I don't get the hype. I read the manga and it is mostly just boring and generic. Oh and the Pink haired Girl (because fuck names) and her  stupid delusion  annoy the fuck out of me!  Why does she still pretend to be fucked in the head? What is the point of it? There is ZERO fucking reason for it! </br>  <br> two hours <br>That's surprisingly early.</br></br>  <br>7:30 AM in Central Freedom Time.</br>  So we all gonna watch the live stream?  <br> Poor Kurumi had to go through two of her friends going nuts. </br>  <br>Of course.</br>  <br>I only catch up with the series a few days ago and even I know that she isn't pretending. Due to the trauma of losing megu-nee. She make her own world of delusion to hide from reality.</br>  <br>Well damn man<br> those faces <br> that empty plate <br><br>;_:</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well unfortunately I will pass on it. I will just go to sleep and take a look immediately after I wake up or something.</br>  <br>My only hope is that it isn't on douyu</br>  <br>Watch it through neetball.</br>  <br>You cam stay up another two hours, come on</br>  <br>Last stream I was watching he was streaming through douyu. For some reason he just changes which he streams on every so often.</br>  <br> Not in the newer chapters. She is cured she just fakes it, that's why THEY have to remind her to ask her imaginary teacher, because she doesn't she her anymore.  </br>  <br>That's what I'm staying up for.</br>  <br>If you're talking about latest chapter,  she pretends mostly for Rii's sake, since the poor girl is losing it.  </br>  <br>Oh and btw please use spoilers. Yes most people read the manga, but the few who haven't might like to enjoy the twists of the story unspoilered</br>  <br>*chapters</br>  wheres the stream going to be?  <br>Is that so. I guess it's the untranslated chapters.</br>  <br>Me and you both.<br><br>So its time to get prepared for all the secondaries?<br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't really say I read it since I just speed through some of the chapters.</br>  <br>I hope you realized this thread marks the end of good GG threads.</br>  <br> Yes but what does it help her? Wouldn't it be better for Rii if she could be sure that the pink girl isn't nuts any more but instead dependable? Isn't she cracking under the pressure of to much stress?  </br>  <br>Keywords are in last thread. You got one hour to guess.</br>  <br> Rii herself is starting to act as if she herself believes Megu-nee is around. Yuuki just plays along for the most part, because it's better not to contradict the crazy (same reason everyone was playing along when Yuuki was crazy.) </br>  <br>I've been prepared for awhile, and as i said last thread i have no choice but to brave my way through them.<br><br>Gotta protect my shovel from seasonal fags.<br><br>They may not get too bad as most people who are interested are already in here and those who still haven't are likely to not participate too much.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>meatspin.fr</br>  <br>pretty edgy</br>  So, I'm guessing that  the university girls will find out about Kurumi having been bitten and try to kill her or kick her out. It'll probably turn out that they've already done to same to an old friend and are collectively pretending she never existed, and Yuki will have to heal their hearts.   <br>Looked rounded to me.</br>  <br>There's dozens of way it can turn out, we don't know yet. I'm actually really excited to see where it ends up.</br>  <br>Yuuri not Yuri<br>Yuki not Yuuri<br><br>Romanize correctly.</br></br></br></br>  Does anyone know where I can find the raws for chapter 36 and 37?  <br>No.</br>  <br>Only korean so far.<br>http://marumaru.in/b/manga/336</br></br>  <br>With a shovel to the face?</br>  <br>We've seen the idea of groups of survivors being destroyed from the inside by one infected person hiding it before with Miki's group and at the school, so it makes sense that something relating to that would brought up here as well, especially for such an apparently well-organized group.</br>  I want to shovel Shovels trench.    Do I have enough time to read the manga before it airs?  <br>no</br>  <br>you have an hour</br>  <br>You could probably read the first few, though not finish it.<br><br><br> no shovel <br>Disgusting</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you are fast?<br>There are 35 Chapter right now and the anime will Air really soon.. so.. HURRY ANON!</br></br>  <br>Yes. Do you want me to lend you my copies?</br>  <br> reading a chapter in less than two minutes <br>Nah, impossible.</br></br>  <br>I would have thought that because we already had that one a few times that it was finally time for the all time favorite of zombie fiction to appear beforehand.<br>Scheming humans fucking you over for shit and giggles. <br>They can do the don't get the infected near us thing with the scientists they may or may not meet at the university. I mean how would a bunch of random girls even realize that Kurumi is infected anyway? As long as they don't get touchy feely with her, or she starts having more obvious symptoms than just being cold to the touch, I don't see how they could find out about it.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to be the one to  kill_  her.</br>  <br>how long until subs?</br>  <br>I'll fight you.</br>  <br>Subs never.</br>  <br>If she's going to die, I'd rather it be me who does the deed.</br>  <br>1 hour after Japan airing  according to CR announcement </br>  <br>That's some twisted shit anon.<br><br>Is neetball still offline for anyone else?<br>It sais Ore monogatri is supposed to be streaming right now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes it's offline for me too</br>  <br>No, nigger. It says Ore Monogatari airs at 21:00.</br>  <br>I thought the shedule for Ore is at 21:00 jst?</br>  <br>Offline for me, too. Don't worry about Ore Monogatari, Gakkou Gurashi is still listed in its proper timeslot.</br>  <br>  As long as they don't get touchy feely with her <br><br>They'll give them all physical checks, just like when Miki and Kei joined their group at the mall.</br></br></br>  <br>it's airing in 14 min</br>  <br>Okay, thats good.<br><br><br>Last time i checked japan was 40 min behind me, now its an hour apparently.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would anyone have anything but JST set on their PC clock is beyond me.</br>  <br>I know, right? Filthy casuals.</br>    <br> not having multiple clock on your PC </br>  neet is on  <br> not having both local and JST </br>  <br>What kind of shit country are you in that you have one of those retarded timezones?</br>  <br>Just reminded me how early this show is actually going to be on.</br>  <br>My overlord is an emu, if that helps.</br>   wakaba girls <br>At least I will get a bit of healing today.</br>  <br>21:30 JST you roughly ~30 min before it start.</br>  <br>Yeah. I would have expected this to have aired at least midnight. Whenever something is on that early it makes me wonder whether it will increase the viewing numbers and possibly get more popular.</br>  This isn't Ore monogatari.<br>Am i watching the right one?</br>  <br>Ore starts at 21 look at your damn clock.</br>  <br>Probably not then.</br>  WHERE DA WHITE WOMEN AT  <br>Fuck clocks.</br>  <br>nothing is showing up for me</br>  <br>Using the vaughn link? It's definitely on</br>  <br>Look under the schedule and a second link is there.<br><br>That one worked for me.</br></br></br>  Ore monogatari is starting in neet  <br><br>ah I see, thanks</br></br>  Use CC notes for the schedule<br><br>https://www.evernote.com/shard/s204<wbr>/sh/d3bb1f0f-ab36-4d49-9fdb-0280026<wbr>d5950/60154e4ad7d260fc6871649761b21<wbr>726</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>so GG is delayed?</br>  Does auch a stupid jinx actually exist in disneyland?  <br>no, it's still airing in 30 minutes</br>  <br> 9:30pm JST <br><br>Gee I wonder</br></br></br>  <br>It airs on AT-X.</br>  <br>Wouldn't know, i don't speak moon.</br>  <br>How did you even come up with that idea?</br>  This show feels like its taking forever to come out.  <br>Hide your lolis, hide your zombies, Lelouch came to shitpost.</br>  That surprised Miki is so cute.  <br>What's worse lrd or ledouche?</br>  <br>Is CC even still streaming anymore?</br>  <br> 21:30 #gakkougurashi → 22:30 </br>  <br>They use the chat all the time and I think yucie still uses it sometimes too.</br>  <br>no, his note is still more accurate than shitty anichart</br>  <br><br> another generic moe SoL shit  <br>No thanks.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you a fucking retard? Do I seriously need to explain this when it should be obvious from how all of the fucking show times are shown?</br>  <br>ahahahahahaha.wav</br>  <br>guaranteed replies</br>  It's been a little bit more than two years since the the first chapter was dumped and I must say I've enjoyed the ride up until this day with /a/. I don't really care how bad the anime is going to be as long as the manga discussions will continue.  <br><br>Chinese scans too, could go ask the chinese groups if they'd share the raws.<br>http://www.dm5.com/manhua-xueyuangu<wbr>dao/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>this guy</br>  <br>laughingwhore.jpg</br>  <br> healed <br><br>Not twintails, im sure of that.<br><br>She is alreadyone of them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm only pretending</br></br>  <br> OKAERI~~ </br>  Who else has the stream and /a/ side by side?<br><br>Or are you watching fullscreen?</br></br>  <br> BU! </br>  <br>Don't we all do that, have both open?</br>  <br>I am. The quality of the stream is not that good for me to put it in fullscreen.</br>  <br>Maybe you should get another monitor.</br>  <br>Why not both?<br> Though I'm not watching. I'm at fucking work. </br></br>  <br>But that costs money, anon.</br>  Ore monogatari just finished.<br>Who hype!?</br>  <br>What about shitposting from your phone?

Literally who?  <br> DEM LIPS </br>  Who are these people?    who are these whores  Honestly Yuki? Why are you imagining such a turboslut?  Well this is definitely Lerche. It's using the crowd reaction style from AssClass.  What is this moe garbage?  <br><br><br>Filler because they stretched the first chapter to fill the whole first episode.</br></br></br>   She knows!   <br>AOTS</br>  Who is that emo semen demon?   But it's done not true at all   <br>It's kinda fitting here at least.</br>  They're making here even MORE delusioned than in the manga.  That blackboard writing.   dat chalkboard writing     <br>That was good.</br>  I like how we see Yuki's warped world like this actually.  Check the blackboard  <br><br>What was it? I missed it.</br></br>  Miki's VA is pretty good.      Seriously, why are Miki and the dog already here? It just doesn't make any sense   broken glass and wind   wat   dog's bitten <br>I call it</br>  <br> ;_; </br>   broken windows <br>IT BEGINS</br>  OH SHIT BROKEN WINDOWS<br><br>OH SHIT WIRE AND DESK BARRIER</br></br>  <br>I would assume Miki is here because they wanted her character, but they won't make it to the part when the leave the school in the show.</br>  I like how they use Mii-kun's behavior to hint at it.   barricades   How long are they gonna lead us by the nose?  <br>I'm liking these little subtleties</br>  <br>I wonder if they're going to just cut the Miki rescue chapters.<br><br>They're going to want to end at chapter 30. Something's got to go.</br></br></br>  THE DOG DOESN'T REAL   The delusion slowly deteriorating <br><br>oh fuck</br></br>  Oh for fuck's sake, catch the fucking dog already.  <br>Until the end of the episode, Anon.</br>   DAT YARD    zombies   All their voices are good.<br><br> baseball team <br>Fuck</br></br></br>  <br>They'll chase that dog for the WHOLE episode.</br>  This show. How many budget does it have? It looks nice.  I want to marry Kurumi.   that courtyard   <br>He's real, otherwise Miki wouldn't have started the whole we have to find him arc in the first place.</br>  Despite the change in story elements, Lerche is doing a good job otherwise.  Is this Jojo?  <br> Help me <br>ARGH</br></br>  Dame, that is subtle as fuck. I love it.  <br> reality will only hit the next episode <br>Please, no.</br></br>   sanity crumbling down little by little instead of a big "surprise" final shot <br>I didn't think they could make it more unsettling that the manga.<br><br>What the hell happened to Lerche, they've delivered so fucking much in the past 2 days.</br></br></br>  <br>Too late, i already did.</br>  HERE WE GO  megu-nee confirmed dead  <br>Oh shit.<br><br><br>I meant we'll get the empty classroom at the very end of this episode.</br></br></br></br>   that cross <br>FUCK<br><br><br>Which part?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope, Illya.</br>  <br>That's Kurumi's senpai's grave.</br>  <br>[SAVE ME]</br>  <br>It's only the first episode, if they will fuck up it will happen on later episode in one of the three series.</br>  <br>SHUT THE FUCK UP</br>  That book again.  <br>Meki's reaction.</br>  Seriously, this episode is just about to give me diabetes if I didn't know what was going on and wasn't noticing the hints.    Here it comes!  Oh fuck.   spooky eyes stalker   HERE WE GO!  When will the teasing end?  <br>It's supposed to look like this? For some reason douyou's stream looks really light and saturated, their skin is white</br>  I absolutely love what they did with the eyes.  It's just about to happen  Is it wrong that I want to ravage lips-chan?  Oh SHIT.  Wait was Miki there in the first chapter?  And here we go.  <br>No</br>  I have no idea what this anime is about but it looks very cute. Can't wait for the subs.  WAT  DELIVERED   missed the stream <br>Fuck</br>  The ride has begun  <br>I'm sorry</br>  <br>So why is she in the first episode then?</br>  Well, that was anticlimactic.  SHHHIIIIIT  What if it turns out that the anime is a happy spin off ?  <br>I haven't idea. I was surprised too</br>  <br>Because this isn't the manga.</br>  That was fucking great.<br><br>How is Lerche doing it?</br></br>  ED time!  <br>Sorry for what? Waiting for subs? I'm sure they will come fast enough.</br>  I'm amazed at Lerche delivering both GG and MonMusu.  <br>Holy fuck that's depressing.</br>  Noice.<br><br>ED is nice too.</br></br>  That was pretty good. Although no telling when they'll fuck it up later down the line.  Thank you lerche, the zombies look great as well  Ed better than op  The atmosphere was great, Lerche delivered for now.  Subarashii   all the blood in the room <br>Nice</br>  <br>Because staff decided to make her viewpoint character for last part of episode</br>  When do we get more screencaps?  I feel like the music was a bit weird for the reveal. Thoughts?   /a/ likes it <br>All is well.</br>   Sweet dreams   <br> [WAKE ME UP] </br>    bear confirmed    I can't believe it, lerche delivered.  Kurumi's senpai there at the end.   NOT a moe SoL show <br><br>DROPPED</br></br>  That shot of the zombie behind the barrier proves they aren't going to fuck this up.  Dame, The sick plot is better than the manga.   Dog and bear <br>SHIT!</br>  I was spooked<br>Fansubdb says CR is doing it, but I don't see it on HS schedule</br>  <br>it'll be out in an hour</br>  Encore?  HEALED/10  <br>WAKE ME UP INSIDE</br>  Good episode  I am satisfied.  What the hell was with that last ed shot that implied that Yuki will end up imagining them too? I don't like the implications of that at all.  <br>i'm sorry too</br>  BRING BACK CHOKER-CHAN OR WE RIOT<br><br> She's going to be the zombie Yuki kills, isn't she? ;_; </br></br>  <br>Yeah, I was scared that they wouldn't get the creepiness of the zombies in the manga down, but the design was well done.<br><br>Thank god. If there was any chance for them to fuck up in the first episode, it was the designs, but it worked.</br></br></br>  <br>I have good news for you.</br>  <br><br>Sweet dreams.</br></br>  They dragged the dog chasing too long.  9/10 It's diejoobu  <br>[I CANT WAKE UP]</br>  <br>Enjoy the ride.</br>  So how is 2chan talking about it? Did the nips also like it?  <br>We already knew from the spoilers that the first one was going to be good, the question is if they can keep the quality or not.</br>    <br>My apologies</br>    <br>It seems like neetball is reairing this; hurry</br>  <br>Fucking this.<br>The dog is annoying as shit.</br></br>  <br>Not much else they could have done to drag it out though, right? But I would've preferred more Shovel.</br>  <br>They needed padding so that the reveal could happen at the end.</br>  <br> 2chan <br>AT-X airings don't have live watch threads.</br></br>  <br>That's the way, anon!</br>  If they keep the same OP for every episode I don't know if I cant handle it.  <br>So little happened in the first chapter before the reveal they had to pad it with something.</br>  Lerche actually fucking delivered, B A S E D  <br>Good one.</br>  I just really hope we get a flashback for Miki's rescue, that was one of my favorite scenes.  Where's the futakuro thread?  <br>Did they at least liked it?</br>   mfw all the first episodes of the adaptations/sequel i was waiting for delivered   so far <br>Is this real life?</br>  <br>Her name is Shovel, get it right anon.</br>  that's what she gets for wearing a choker  <br>They really should've had more Shovel. Too much Miki, it kind of irritated me.</br>  <br>It's alright, some of them think the first episode wasted bunch of times though.</br>  <br>If he actually kills all of them off in the anime I'm not sure how I will handle it.</br>  <br>  I would've preferred more Shovel. <br>We all would've, next episode anon.<br>Next episode.</br></br></br>  <br>They've got Kei on the website, so maybe.</br>  <br>JwWw didn't.</br>  <br> But I would've preferred more Shovel. <br>Fucking this, well, next week perhaps.</br></br>  <br> Too much Miki <br>Miki was great. This is from a hardcore Kurumifag. Though I do think they should have spread the airtime between characters more.</br></br>  Dropped after about 10 minutes. I can't understand shit without subs and it's another cute girls doing cute things show, there are multiple better anime this season in that genre. Man the /a/ hype machine has a shit taste.  <br>Next week is a Shovel episode.</br>  <br><br>Why is there Miki at all?</br></br>  Is it time to start asking for subs?  So is Lerche a decent studio now? Because if they keep this quality up then I'll be very happy if they announce more manga adaptations.  toroumatu=kyubei VA emiri Kato  So we all agree shovel is best girl right?  <br>But shovel has one to- <br>Oh.</br></br>  <br>Well memed my friend.</br>    <br>To fit the graduation scene into one cour.</br>  <br>  it's another cute girls doing cute things show, <br>lol</br></br>  <br>Funny way to spell garter.</br>  <br>Why is pink the only one with a purple uniform?</br>  <br>unload the reaction images, boys</br>  I'll wait for subs, but in the meantime I caught up with the manga.<br><br> tfw cried tears of joy when they rescued Ruu-chan </br></br>  <br>She was the best to contrast Yuki though, her hesitating in playing along makes more sense than if Kurumi or Rii would have done it.</br>  <br>Crazy was clearly the best.</br>  <br>I doubt they'll keep up such quality for all the three shows, and of what I could saw Ranpo Kitan and this are going to suffer.</br>  <br>What a blatant Madoka ripoff, the main character even has pink hair.</br>  <br>What, survival and zombie-slaying isn't cute to you?<br><br><br> rescued Ruu-chan <br>Hahahehe.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>You mean the bear?</br>  <br>   implying she's real </br>  <br>Thats because i didn't anon.<br><br><br>You're deluding yourself, give into the shovel.</br></br></br></br>   tfw I read the manga right after the anime announcement and now that it's airing I've forgotten the entire story   <br>Am I the only one that thinks that all girls are best girls?</br>  <br>Don't laugh let me believe she is alive and well.</br>  <br>She's their senpai.</br>  Was that  Megu-nee  at the end?  I need to see the episode again because I think I saw Kei among the faceless people.  <br>The first episode wasn't as horrible as I feared. I will watch a few more episodes before possibly dropping it.</br>  <br>Waifu wars will ruin the fanbase, stop it. Kurumi wouldn't be impressed.</br>  <br>That's good, you can re-experience hel...heaven.</br>   rescued Ruu-chan <br>How does one rescue a teddy bear?<br><br><br>Yep, because shovel is the one true best girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's in the basement. See: </br>  <br>Oh, really? It feels like the girl with long brown hair should be the oldest</br>  <br>Do you have memory problems, anon, or are you already a grandpa?</br>  <br><br><br>Don't ruin my hopes and dreams, I've shed so many tears at this manga.</br></br></br>  <br>You are a funny guy.</br>  <br> Waifu wars will ruin the fanbase <br>Anon, I've been doing this for the past 2 years and the fanbase is still fine, nothings gonna change.</br></br>  Shitty ohys raw<br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>09696</wbr></br>  <br>She's best  zombie </br>  <br>I think Monster Musume will suffer most, even that's with other studio.<br>This one and Ranpo both looks will keep the decent quality.</br></br>  <br>thanks, I guess</br>  <br>I don't know, I always find it difficult to remember the storylines of anime and manga, I only recall random scenes.</br>  <br>Anime fanbases are a different beast, friend.</br>  <br>By picking it up from the floor? You don't want dirty zombies smearing their rotting remains all over the poor plushie. Thank god that Rii is such a thoughtful young lady and cares about the wellbeing of teddybears.</br>  <br><br><br>Stop making fun of me, let a guy have hope.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Maybe we got a "Normal School Life and introducting" episode when Miki is already in the group. <br><br>And later we got the "Miki backstory and rescue mission" in a flashback...<br><br>- Hey Rii remeber when we found Miki? It was Yuki's idea to... - and we got the flashback.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're not the only one. I can barely remember characters after something ends.</br>  So how many episode threads I need to avoid till faggot mangatards stop spamming spoilers?  I love Rii-chan<br><br> I've been too busy </br></br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br>Just read the manga, it's only 35 chapters translated.</br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br>Atleast say "zombie girl"! ;_;<br><br><br>I kek'd<br><br><br>Than i tame them, it'll be my life goal.<br><br><br>See? exactly what i said would happen the other day.<br><br><br>I love shovel!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm afraid that's not something you can escape.</br>  calm before the storm  <br>You know, the big spoiler part already show up in first episode.</br>  <br>Better yet, just have an episode featuring only Miki's backstory up to the point she hears the school life club downstairs.<br><br>Then have another episode about the school life club going on their trip to the mall and them meeting her.</br></br></br>  <br>Nice bait</br>  How do we defeat Imagine Maker?  We break him  <br>Who the fuck is that?</br>  <br>pasting from another thread.<br> The dude in the last pics is Kamisato Takeru the self-proclaimed 'Magic God Hunter'. Seem like he also posses a special power in his right hand. He called his power 'World Rejector' and killed Niang-Niang with just one touch (Niang-Niang also show pleasure when she 'died') He has already killed all of the Magic Gods that are hiding in the other dimension. Othinus is his next target, it seems. <br><br> Aleister didn't even know that Kamisato exist. And laura called him a fool for that. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Anti-Touma</br>  <br>Simple, we just kill him!</br>  <br>Why, though? He seems like he's doing some serious good.</br>  <br> Niang-Niang also show pleasure when she 'died' <br>He fingered her to death?</br></br>  <br>So magic gods are no longer relevant?</br>  <br>But isn't Touma's job to destroy gods? He's doing the same shit!</br>  <br>Since when were you under the impression they were relevant?</br>  <br>Touma is protecting a god.</br>  Othinus is kill next volume. Can't wait for Othishitters to cry about it.  <br>the moment Othinus dies Touma goes full batshit. As sad as it is, I'd take the sacrifice just to see Touma going apeshit on the world</br>  <br>makes it feel like the magic gods only existed to save othinus, and I don't like that.</br>  <br>Is this some new shit or have I been even more out of the Raildex loop than I thought?</br>  <br> Fairy <br>Unless they have somehow returned Othinus to her former self and she's no longer an onahole for Touma, I see no point on that kid even showing up.</br></br>  New shit. Out of nowhere without even Aleister noticing NotTouma appeared and killed off all the gods.  <br> implying touma will allow that when now he has unlock something in his hand </br>  <br>But anon! Takeru is living his life correctly, what can Touma even do against someone lika that?</br>  <br>Cry harder, Othishitter. She will die and there will be nothing Touma can do about it</br>  <br>10/10 writing, Kamachi, now give me more fruitless teasers for Biribiri development so I can forget about this shit.</br>  <br>Its a Two parter</br>  <br>Buttblasted hater detected</br>  <br>  give me more fruitless teasers for Biribiri development so I can forget about this shit. <br>yfw she reaches level 6 next volume.</br></br>  <br> &gt;Aleister didn't even know that Kamisato exist. And laura called him a fool for that. <br>That sounds like "I totally made him right now and shoehorned him in the story" because I can.</br></br>   Touma <br> Getting a Powerup </br>   Misaki has her ship sunk <br> Mikoto has her ship sunk <br> Othinus is kill soon <br><br>when will you delusional drooling retards admit Touma will end up<br>alone or dead</br></br></br></br></br>  I want to see Touma being raped by the stalking female gods<br> notice me sempai! <br>(on mobile img posting does not work sorry)<br>http://i.imgur.com/Pw1PciU.jpg</br></br></br>  <br>Besides the actual retards, everyone is expecting him to end up alone and insane</br>  <br>delusional waifu shipping faggot detected</br>  <br> Mikoto has her ship sunk <br>Gr8 b8</br></br>  <br>Well, it's sunk if the spoilers are true.</br>  <br>Where?</br>   Anti-Touma kills Niang-Niang instead of making her part of his harem <br><br>What a faggot.</br></br>  <br> one touch of death <br> even crowley didn't know about him <br>Almost sounds like a fanfic mary sue</br></br></br>  <br> shipping <br>Pls, its a proven fact that under toumas protection no ever fucking dies.</br></br>  <br> Aleister didn't even know that Kamisato exist <br>Crowley really can't get his shit together since the WW3.</br></br>  <br>The spoilers are in last thread. Go find them and read them.</br>  <br>We already knew there would someone else with a special power. We didnt expect him to be a NotTouma and to appear suddenly.</br>  <br><br> Mikoto realizing that she's useless against magic gods somehow means the ship has sunk <br><br>You're reaching pretty hard there anon-kun.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a ruse, just like he rused the magic gods.</br>  <br> What is volume 2 </br>  <br><br>It literally says that Mikoto was sad because she cant keep up with magic god powerlevels and cant help Touma. That's it.</br></br>   Crowley doesn't know about Kamisato <br> Laura does <br>Crowley<br>Crowley pls<br>Try coming out of your piss tank one of these days<br>Or at least stop stalking your boytoys and watch the news or something, you filthy NEET</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget crowley needed to a really round about way just to kill one magic god and he apparently kills all of them. Pretty sure the ones who didn't come out didn't have the nerf spell on them either.</br>  <br>Is he just going to appear in the finale? Are we forced to wait for months again for the plots?</br>  <br>She also realized she's useless for Touma. So. She sunk her own ship</br>  <br>I read them, but if you think that this is a sunk<br> Last tightening in Misaka, after returning to the student dormitory, it is lamented him and is far <br>You're delusional.</br></br></br>  <br>That's what I'm hoping for.</br>  <br>I really doubt that's going to end it.</br>  <br>The same way we defeated the Othinus/Index fusion into a magic god last volume, by not believing fake spoiler.</br>  <br><br>No, she realized she cant help him this time. That doesn't mean anything. If anything, she's going to resolve to get stronger or some shit.</br></br>  <br>He'll probably be the Fiamma of NT, so expect a further build up arc (i.e. the God's Right Seat arc of OT building up to WW3) before he actually does anything.</br>  <br><br> oh no I cant fight LITERAL GODS I must be useless to Touma he'll never love me now bawwww guess my ship has sunk for reals <br><br>You are literally retarded.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is he a gemstone or a magician? Or is he something else along the same lines as Touma?</br>  <br> Last tightening in Misaka, after returning to the student dormitory, it is lamented him and is far <br>I don't even know what this means, but "last tightening in Misaka" sounds like a consummated ship, not a sunk one.</br></br>   yfw when Anti-Touma is actually #6   I can't help but feel Aiwass is going to be super underwhelming when he shows up now.  <br>Not really. Seems like she's accepted it won't work out with Touma</br>  <br>So is this the unknown helper?</br>  WE LITERALLY HAVE AN ANTI-TOUMA RUNNING AROUND BEHIND CROWLEY'S BACK AND KILLING MAGIC GODS WITH EASE<br><br><br>AND YOU FAGS STILL KEEP DRONING ON ABOUT FUCKING SHIPPING</br></br></br>  <br>That's dumb, you're dumb<br>6th is perfect as he is</br></br>   trusting spoilerfags <br><br>When will you guys learn</br></br>  <br>Oh, you already read it?</br>  <br>Even the magic gods called Aiwass weak. Honestly I can imagine imagine anything being on a bigger scale than othinus was.</br>  <br><br>You derived this from a google translated synopsis even though it says nothing of the sort?</br></br>  <br>That doesn't mean anything, as Touma can't even help himself. Plus none of his other allies can stand up to them either. Not that it matters since the magic gods are presumably dead now.</br>  <br>If Kamachi goes full Thelema than he is just the herald of something greater</br>  <br>Because the anti-Touma thing is completely retarded, and the only part of it I care about is the part where he's trying to kill Othinus. Which makes it relevant to waifu-wars.</br>  <br>Never.</br>  <br>This. Its too good to b true its like the fake spoilers last time about Touma can't dispel gemstone attack s and index and othinus making pseudo IB</br>  <br>And I'm literally fucking your mom behind your dad's back.</br>  <br><br>The illustrations confirm a lot of the spoilers anon.</br></br>  <br>Why would he even kill a 15cm useless fairy unless that bitch is just lying about losing her power</br>  <br>Maybe he just want to help</br>  <br><br>She couldn't keep up with saints either, she wasn't going to help in a boss fight magic gods or no magic gods. She should stick to hacking and science knowledge since is way smarter than him.</br></br>  <br><br>Get in line behind all the other 10 year olds on xbox, anon</br></br>  Anyone else glad that Kamachi dropped magic gods? They were interesting initially but reality warping is a shit power for good fights.  <br>ANOTHER HAREM MEMBERS FUCKING SERIOSULY?</br>  <br>Why is he even trying to kill anyone? I sure don't fucking know.</br>  <br> The illustrations confirm a lot of the spoilers anon. </br>   Kuroko shows up   <br>But she wants to be able to be useful for him and her ability is not as useful against them. Isn't she the strongest member of his harem? Or it's Kanzaki?</br>  <br>Honestly it doesn't sound good, and if his only motive is killing gods and he also has killed all the gods except othinus, he probably wont be in the story long.</br>  <br>I am. I also hope World Rejector kills Othinus</br>   Kamisato steals Touma's harem <br> no more magical girls around == no more troubles <br> Touma finally can live a peaceful high school life goofing around with the rest of Delta Force <br> one day he asks Fukiyose out <br> she agrees after beating him up <br>GOOD END</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean NT3 didn't involve a pedophile kidnapping the main cast for nefarious purposes?</br>   Kamisato is Kamachi's self insert removing all trace of the shittiest thing to happen in Index from existence <br>Based Kamachi</br>  <br><br>You're comparing 1 misleading cover to an entire slew of illustrations that confirm like 70% of the spoilers.</br></br>  <br> Even the magic gods called Aiwass weak <br>What the hell is wrong with Kamachi ? Introducing Literal God Tier beings so they can job to a newfag and Aiwass who is supposed to be final villain tier is gonna get rekt by some Newfag whose luck is fucking God Like for Crowley to not notice. Kamachi is finally losing his shit</br></br>  <br>Aren't the Magic Gods still nerfed thanks to Alesteir?</br>  <br>They only used reality warp with othinus the others didn't even want to fuck with reality. Also they don't do that with people above phase foolery like crowley.</br>  <br><br>Introducing literal gods before the actual finale was a dumb move on Kamachi's part honestly. It trivializes 99% of the cast.</br></br>  F A K E   S P O I L E R S<br>A   <br>K   <br>E   <br><br>S   <br>P   <br>O   <br>I   <br>L   <br>E   <br>R   <br>S  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Touma and 95% of his allies can't fight saints either. What the fuck is your point, anon?</br>  <br>because Magic Gods are to dangaorous.<br>and there are to many.</br></br>  <br>Why is this nigga touching carelessly</br>   that High Priest <br>If this isn't some imaginary shit that Misaka is having, this novel would be solid 10/10 because of this alone</br>  <br>That's a fake spoiler</br>  <br> Anyone else glad that Kamachi dropped magic gods? <br>I am but the way it was handled was as shitty as it gets.</br></br>  <br>at least the three shown here are but the others never left the dimension so they shouldn't even have the nerf zombie put on them either.</br>  <br>What? She could in NT6.</br>    <br>Sometimes its best to just bullshit your way out of things, I'd rather not lose 3 volumes to him trying to make up a better way of doing it.</br>  <br> Niang-Niang <br> dead <br> doesn't get to join the harem. <br>God damn. I hate you, Kamachi.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's one of his stronger allies. Only weaker than Kanzaki and Kazakiri when it comes to brute strength.</br>   no japannese text <br>It's fake</br>  <br>The point is she was never in a position to help him fight wise, so this changes nothing even if the gods are dead. Her skills have always been at better use elsewhere.</br>  <br>But Kanzaki nerfs herself</br>  <br>Touma has no more shits to give when it comes to weird magical women hanging off of him</br>  <br>So did he stick that plug on misaka?</br>  <br><br>Did you not see all of last thread?</br></br>  <br> Mikoto will never wear that outfit outside of her own thought bubble <br>suffering<br><br><br>She was keeping up because the saint was swinging a big chunk of metal around that she magnetised to slow her down. Brunhild would have destroyed her if she'd just dropped the sword.<br><br><br>Someone's been posting pictures of text pages in the last thread, I can't read it but that and pictures confirm that it's not going to be miles away from true.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   tfw Mikoto never charge your mobile <br>Why live?</br>  <br>She could, when the saint uses no magic, she has a massive field advantage and thor tells her about her opponent. With all that she was still narrowly avoiding death.</br>  <br>Touma's getting prettier every volume, is suffering actually a beautifier?</br>  <br>This. Haters need to stop trying so hard. What Kamach is doing for MIsaka is literally setting up to make her grow stronger as a character and probably powerlevels too.</br>  <br>He doesn't even scream and just stare blankly at all the bitches hanging to him</br>  <br>kanzaki kazakiri, and that is excluding all the male allies.</br>  You need plot armour to defeat the Touman.  <br><br><br>There's something in Touma's pupils in this volume that's different than usual. It's like it's more blank than the previous volumes.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Obviously. Look at Shiage and Accel comparitive to how they used to look like</br></br>  It is a legit spoiler though. Some Japs in 2ch thread has already confirmed this.  <br>Its suppose to cleanse you and give way to either enlightment or insanity</br>  <br>So, besides Accel, Kakine and maybe Gunha, no level 5 can rival a Saint? Magic side is so overpowered. And even ANgel Accel is not that strong compared to magic side top tiers.</br>  <br>No, she's to pure for it. Only after kissu.</br>   no NT14 in September   Othinus dead -&gt; Touma crazy -&gt; Index dead -&gt; more crazy.<br><br>Poor Touma.</br></br>  <br>but almost every magician gets nerfed when they lose</br>  <br><br>Kazakiri is in the harem?</br></br>   yfw anti-Touma looks suspiciously like civilian Gunha   <br>Its only hell for him now<br><br> yfw demon king touma </br></br></br>  <br> A walking battery recharging Biribiri <br>Moe as hell.</br></br>  <br>Espers have more potential for growth though, if Level 6 is anywhere near as strong as its hyped up to be.<br><br><br>I thought she wasn't, she always seemed more interested in protecting Index than Touma.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Aleister didn't even know that Kamisato exist <br>I refuse to believe that the guy with another hand power just coincidently appeared out of nowhere right after Aleister personally raided Magic Gods, destroyed their Sekrit Club and lured them out of their dimension only to coincidently do exactly what Crowley wanted to be done.<br> Kamisato was an inside job. </br></br></br>  So is the new guy OP or is it something like it only works against MG ? either way it's just too convenient of a power. Feels like Kamachi wrote himself in a corner with introducing the Magic Gods so he made a character solely for erasing that stupid mistake he made   NT 14 will probably be a volume of straight up touma protecting his 15 cm waifu from the anti touma in a bigass fight that expands all over AC <br>MUH DIK<br>double points if accel and all of his other buddies show up to help deal with this shit as the volume goes on.</br></br>  <br>In NT2 she was in the crowd girls welcoming touma back. I think that counts.</br>  <br>Well yeah. Then again, the magic side has practically the whole world under control, while science is stuck in one city.<br><br>On the other side, the most powerful effect from the science side has to be AIM poisoning which can practically shut any magician down.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Kazakiri isn't in Touma's harem, but she is in Touma's faction through proxy because of her interest in Index.</br></br>  <br>Looks like touma but more evil</br>  Would you pat her head, /a/?    pretty smart in battle <br><br>Rakan = Nagi. They have talent but they are stupid and reckless.</br></br>    <br>Blame imouto and Yukihime for giving him massive self esteem issues, which then keep him from going all the way with Kitty</br>  <br>So in the end Yukihime ruined her own love life? I actually would find that funny if it wasn't so sad.</br>  <br>ironic.</br>  How you liking the Genderbender Arc /a/?  <br>Casey Hudson, pls go away.</br>  <br>I'm on ep 220 and I'm already starting to pace myself so it last as long as possible.<br><br> May have something to do with the godawful high pitch buzz in CR rips that I can't deal with for more than 5mins a time. </br></br></br>  <br>Best joke. Sorachi master troll.</br>  <br>I really wonder if we'll ever see Kagura's mom.</br>  <br>Four Devas for me<br> HEY HEY SAMURAI HEART </br></br>  Last thread is kill as expected.<br><br>So let's try again. Is mr.hands going to win the Orimotobowl?</br></br>    <br> GIF </br>  <br>Fine.</br>  <br>Yukino goes study abroad.<br>Yui goes to some famous school (don't ask me why)<br>8man studies in a local school, together with Zaimokuza and Totsuka. Kawanantoka-san too.<br><br>Hayama and Miura become a couple.<br><br>Tobe got interested in 2D worlds.  He loves yuri.  He and Ebina got more closer, but not be a couple yet.<br><br>Haruno take over her parents business and get married to a wealthy handsome young man.  She doesn't like him, though.

I am not if I should go for the steam sprites widescreen or ps3 sprites widescreen for Onikakushi mod. Anyone that have played either can recommend?  <br>Depends on your tastes. I liked Steam sprites just fine.</br>    <br>I hate Mion's steam sprite. That's mostly why I went with PS3. Also if you want to do steam sprites, use the tweaked ones!</br>  <br>Do you mind linking the tweaked ones?
