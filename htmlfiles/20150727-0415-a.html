[ So, Toei tweeted this shot of Patamon from the new PV that will be shown at Digi on Fest next week. Just one more week Anons.<br><br>http://digimon-adventure.net/<br><br>PV: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CN9<wbr>xpqG1giY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  I just hope one of the movies has angewomon vs ladydevimon  <br>Why do you want them to fight? They should love each other.</br>  That Patamon looks cute.  I'm thirsty for more, I wont even mind to import the DVDs  <br>I'm out of the loop, is this a follow up to 02, or is it just a sequel to Adventure were the events of 02 didn't happen?</br>  What are the best releases for the first 3 seasons?  <br>It's "tri" for reason, anon.</br>  <br>It takes places between the final battle with MaloVamdemon and the epilogue.</br>  <br>RyoRouge subs plus bunnyhat dvd raws.</br>  I lost all interest after it was revealed that Tri would be some movies instead of a series.  <br>Give us XROS BD already.</br>  <br>With Toei it means less QUALITY</br>  <br>It's Toei, you knew they were going to pull some shit like they did with Crystal. <br><br><br>In 10 years.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or not. Toei is such a shitty nowadays that even their movies have the quality problems you would expect from something airing weekly. They are always ready to disappoint.</br>  <br><br>I can deal with some QUALITY, I can't deal with waiting 4+ months waiting for a BD release or a shitty cam rip so I can finally watch it.</br></br>  <br><br>Ok, so why aren't the 02 kids mentioned anywhere?</br></br>  <br>Nope. It's just the orginal 8 kids and their partners.</br>  If Alphamon is showing up, I hope they use the Royal Knights that never get to show up in anything.        <br> you knew they were going to pull some shit like they did with Crystal <br>But they did the opposite of Crystal. This one is going to theaters. Crystal was niconico, biweekly and managed to look like utter shit.</br></br>    <br>he looks retarded</br>  <br>I hope they retcon the epilogue away.</br>  <br>Thank god takeru didn't end up with Kari</br>  <br>Wtf is a digimon?</br>  <br>For Adventure, RyRo's show subs and PositronCannon's movie subs with BunnyHat's raw encodes.<br><br>For 02, PositronCannon's show/4th movie subs and DmonHiro's third movie subs with BunnyHat's raw encodes.<br><br>For Tamers, WildBunch and PLSP's show/3rd movie subs and DmonHiro's fourth movie subs with BunnyHat's raw encodes.<br><br><br>Because they are no longer relevant.<br><br><br>Monster friends to the boys and girls.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When's the LadyDevimon figure coming out?</br>  Digimon Next Order spoilers where<br><br>I gave up on the anime. It's gonna be shit</br></br>  what music is this?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nFc<wbr>NVq_QIIM</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> Digimon Next Order spoilers where <br>Hard to have spoilers to a game we know nothing about, not even a solid release date.<br><br><br>Doesn't look like that song was included on any 02 soundtrack, which is a shame. It was reused in episode 44 of Tamers, during Dobermon's sacrifice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>digital monster for short. They're made out of layers of information given form.</br>  Will mimi stop with the the ridiculous hair?  <br>No. Mimi's hair will change shape and color in every Tri movie. The last movie reveals that her hair was possessed by Vamdemon.</br>   yfw it's the first digimon thread in months     <br>Very in character.</br>  Since this is already up, I just finished Tamers (subbed). I haven't watched it since it aired on Fox, and man did it do a lot of weird things.    <br>Let me see if I can sum up the things I found odd:<br><br>-Most of the Perfects job to hard, Rapidmon, and Taomon only managed to kill one digimon, while Megalogrowlmon got 3, then they job in every single fight.<br>-The last few Deva were a joke, all going down easily, and one switching sides.<br>-Zhuqiaomon gave Impmon the power to evolve to Mega, so why the fuck didn't he give it to the Deva?<br>-Renamons evolutions are geared towards defense/protection instead of straight up fighting.... but those defenses tend to fail, so she's almost worthless by the end of the show.<br>-"We're going to give all the Digimon the power to evolve to Ultimate... except for the one's with tamers, they're going to do that weird hybrid evolution, and fuck that Guardromon."<br>-That gigantic ass pull to beat the D-Reaper.<br>-I didn't expect the kids to be able to deal with Juri's depression after she lost Leomon, but they didn't do a single thing to make her feel better.<br>-The whole forgiveness subplot for Impmon was also bad. The way Impmon handled it was fine, it was everyone forgiving him so easily that ruined it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, I forgot one thing. When the show starts, they mention that digimon load data of defeated opponents to grow stronger (the Deva notably feeling insulted that their Data wasn't being absorbed by the Tamers, because their data was lost), and evolve... then they go and establish that loading data gives you the full power of the absorbed digimon (this was never even implied), and special abilities (again, never eve implied).</br>  <br>Devas are supposed to be extraordinary powerful even for Perfects. That's why a lot of the time, the Tamers' mons have to gang up on them. <br><br>Incidentally, as a Holy Knight Digimon, Dukemon's upper-tier among Ultimates, meaning the others can never really be as good.</br></br></br>  <br>I know, but the only Deva that gave that impression were the horse, dragon (even if he got killed by using a ridiculously good card that is never used again), and pig. The others go down easy.</br>  <br>That's what I mean. Toei states one thing but does something completely different.</br>  <br>Are these up on preorder yet? I need these.</br>  <br>Preorders start at the end of this month for Â¥12528.</br>  <br>Welp I won't be eating this month.</br>  <br>Man, they made Angewomon's tits enormous.</br>  Psst<br>hey guys<br>post your digibros</br></br>  <br>They always were enormous. Digimon that appear female always have huge tits unless they are modeled after a child.</br>  <br><br>The hype had to die eventually.<br><br>Since the initial announcement there were months of continuous threads with almost nothing new to discuss beyond 02 being shit or digimon having sexes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget the waifumon discussion. There was some talk about Cyber Sleuth and Re:Digitize.</br>  <br>Can I just have Angewomon without Hikari?</br>  Can it just be assumed dorbickmon is ultimate?<br>I'm trying to come up with a greymon-esk line for him involving monochomon and triceramon, but he doesn't appear to have an official stage</br>  <br>How about jogress into Mastemon?</br>  Did someone say waifus?  <br>This works as well.</br>  I hope tri gives the other kids their Ultimate digimon.  <br><br>Speaking of Cyber Sluts, who's going to preorder it?<br><br>I heard it's finally going to the west and in different languages.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll play it in a few years when I finally get a PS4 (I'm in no rush to buy it).<br><br>I'm a bit annoyed that most Digimon have only one signature attack, when most of them have at least 2.</br></br></br>  <br><br>If that's the case, then there better be a good reason as to why Imperialdramon FM (or Paladin Mode if DSB is canon) isn't also part of the main focus.<br><br>I get that they want tri to focus on the original 8, but 02 (especially DSB) was presenting Imperialdramon as a sort of replacement to Omegamon, so if Tri is truly covering the gap between the final battle and epilogue, then why switch the focus back to Omegamon (based on what was shown in the PV)?<br><br>Especially since they're trying to gather a new audience, I wouldn't discount the possibility of an Alt timeline just yet. Tri might have a different meaning than just "Direct Sequel".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hopefully the next PV will shed some light on whether Tri takes place in some divergent timeline, or if there is something or someone stopping everyone but the eight Chosen from being useful.<br><br>Then again, this is based on what little material we got. Maybe the 02 characters are elsewhere, fighting their own battles with their new non-Jogressed Perfect/Ultimate Digimon.<br><br>It's been almost one full year since the initial announcement and we still know next to nothing about Tri.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>seeing the whole conflict between alpha and omega in the ad, I'm gonna say we're dealing with an inverted X-Evolution dealy, and seeing as omega in the adventure setting was specifically from just the 01 team, I don't think the 02 team will be too involved. Then again, with the money they're spending on this they might have the budget to do the trans-continuity crossover thing they tried in xros right, but maybe not.</br>  <br> Alphamon and Omegamon <br> It's automatically got something to do with X-Evolution <br><br>What is this logic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>According to 02, they can't Jogress anymore. They've lost that function.<br><br>On the other hand, they were able to do it in Diablomon Strikes back, so who knows what's going on there.<br><br>In any case, Imperialdramon shouldn't be able to mode change to Paladin Mode without Omegamon's power.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Examon best husbando</br>  <br>nono, not that it has something to do with it, but that we're looking at a similar situation, a squabble between royal nights only this time alphamon is the bad guy instead of omega. I did not mean to imply it would be a crossover, I'm pretty sure everyone involved with x-evo has forgotten about it.</br>  <br>I don't think the other Royal Knights are gonna have a big role here. Yggdrasil doesn't exist in Adventure's continuity.</br>  I will regret asking this, but is there any wargreymon hentai where he fucks the shit out of someone?  <br>Okay why can't they jogress anymore? I forgot the details...</br>  <br><br><br> 00000 <br>Well if not, it looks like it needs to be made right now at this moment.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon why would you want that?</br>  <br>did we get confirmation that it doesn't exist in that continuity?<br>I always assumed it was there, but because it was itself never vital to any of the plots it was never talked about or interacted with. Regardless, playing up a spat between alpha and omega in a series intended for their longer-term fans I'm fairly certain means they'll be injecting some aspect of the royal knights narrative into this series, seeing as they royal knights themselves as a group haven't really been constrained to one continuity themselves either.</br></br>  <br>They can just give Gennai Tailmon's Holy Ring so he can put it back where it was during 02 to reactivate their Jogress powers.<br><br>Or the writers can handwave it away and say the Digimon are able to Jogress naturally because reasons.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but wasn't that only because Gabumon couldn't achieve Ultimate/Mega status during 02 when Agumon could?<br><br>And yes, Paladin Mode is only attained with Omegamon's power, considering that that was the most absolute/definitive/OP thing which "concluded" 02 in some fashion, why omit him completely from Tri's PV or info really follows 02's timeline?</br></br></br>  <br>Gennai returned Tailmon's Holy Ring back to her. The Four Holy Beasts used that Holy Ring to facilitate Jogress, and now that they don't have it anymore, the means no longer exists.</br>  <br>Wargreymon and Metalgarurumon yaoi pls</br>  <br>Because the host computer in Adventure's Digital World is Homeostasis. Homeostasis and Yggdrasil can't co-exist.<br><br><br>Because Imperialdramon can't go Paladin Mode unless Omegamon gives up its power. The two can't exist at the same time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>not mine, just one I thought looked cool.</br>  <br>ah, shit ok.<br>well, while that may be true, one of the bigger plot points in 02 was the multiverse aspect of the setting, maybe an alphamon from a digimon universe where the royle knights are a thing has found its way to the adventure world, and has a beef with omega because his homeworld omega was a shit?</br></br>  <br>Why do you want the Royal Knights to appear so badly? They appear in everything else already. Not all Digimon canons need Royal Knights.</br>  <br>not want, just theory<br>what I /want/ is more shit with unidentified type digimon, but they're using to big name royal knights for the ads so I'm trying to work out the angle they're taking from material they've already done using the same characters.</br></br>  <br>The relationship between Omegamon and Alphamon has never actually been delved into before. There's clearly some kinda connection between them, but it's never really explained what.<br><br>Maybe tri will finally show us what their deal is.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but I'm glad if the one's that don't show up often get to appear, even if they're not Royal Knights.</br>  Well, if you think about it, if there's an Omegamon, then logically, an Alphamon must also exist. You can't have an ending without a beginning.  <br>Were a couple on /v/ when the an translation and actual news about the games came out.</br>  <br><br><br>I might've missed something but I have to ask: <br><br>Does the Tail Ring dependency for Jogress apply only to the 02 kids? <br>Or was Omegamon just a special case? (Since his Jogress happened in OWG with the aid of the kids' energy. And Tailmon had her tail ring then.)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the question is, are we going to see tai fucking some random slut like a normal teenager he is?<br>or does that not happen in japan?</br></br>  <br>Omegamon's formation was facilitated through a different source: the hopes and wishes of children from all across the world. It somehow unlocked the hidden potential that lay dormant within Wargreymon and Metalgarurumon, allowing them to fuse and become Omegamon.</br>  <br>Omegamon isn't a Jogress. Jogress was more like a blend of 2 different digimon, while Omegamon was an entirely new digimon formed out of the combination.</br>  <br>Is this what you are really preoccupied about?<br>Kill yourself. Shipping is cancer.</br></br>  <br>I really hope that they don't shoehorn romance into this.</br>  <br>All of 02 was shit. Epilogue just kicked it up a notch.</br>  <br>I know I shouldn't watch but I can't look away.</br>  <br><br>Ah, got it, thanks anons!</br></br>  <br>We will be 30 when this movie series is over...</br>  <br>Might do it like the Berserk Movie Series. Wouldn't be so bad that way.</br>  <br> According to 02 <br>Never go full retard anon. This thing was plotholes and retcons for 50~ episodes straight.</br></br>  <br>Unreleased track.<br>It was used in every season from Adventure to Frontier.<br>-Adventure: when they stop VenomVamdemon and WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon use their signature attacks to finish it.<br>-02: Appeared a lot, but that scene and Azulongmon/Quinlongmon's appearence are probably the most important.<br>-Tamers: Leomon's first appearance and Dobermon's sacrifice.<br>-Frontier: When Tomoki/Tommy's friends' Angemon appears.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>reminder that we still have a lot of unreleased tracks that we all remember:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=LIA<wbr>CeDbNb48</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EzM<wbr>3kdE8bAM</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sW7<wbr>23aU1wXo</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>From tamers <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pOS<wbr>4pd_-lm8</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>And from frontier as well (the part where shadow seraphimon is about to bury takuya):<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=K7E<wbr>DKETnhbU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope Tri uses these soundtracks and releases them. Specially HolyAngemon's evolution theme and Magnamon's one.</br>  <br> theres still threads for digimon tri <br>did you guys not see the character designs?</br></br>  <br>A lot of Frontier soundtracks are unreleased.</br>   Americunts still waiting for Cyber Sleuth <br> I've already played through it 4 or 5 times and am eagerly awating Next Order <br><br>How does it feel to be left behind? I never realized it felt so glorious being ahead.</br></br></br>  This cover of a game remix is so srw, it hurts.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Glh<wbr>0YCrJ_KU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Implying the americans didn't abandon all hope of playing it when they said the Vita release was digital only <br> Implying it's not the europoors <br><br>I just hope they're speedier and actually do a Next Order release. No fucking digital shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>have you played dissidia reskinned with digimon figures?</br>  <br> The last movie reveals that her hair was possessed by Vamdemon. </br>  <br>we let be honest the way that digimon has been handled in the west is weird as fuck. I mean they release that shitty fighting game instead of the vast range of better digimon game. I mean if pokemon can still make a buck or two, I doubt digimon will do terrible</br>  The eternal and perennial best girl.  <br>Combined with the best boy.</br>  <br>You mean best boys.</br>  <br>Only one can be at the peak though.</br>  If Seraphimon appears in Tri, will he still be a useless jobber?  <br>Indeed.<br><br> According to 02's epilogue, it was neither of them. Then again<br> 02 </br> </br></br></br>  <br>Will leomon survive?</br>  <br>he was in the movie</br>  <br>Xros's MadLeomon got revived as a regular Leomon.</br>  <br>well technically so did adventure's leomon.</br>  <br>You mean the 02 movie with the Golden Digimentals? Cos he jobbed there.<br><br>Then he jobbed again in Frontier</br></br></br>  <br>True, but I meant we saw the Xros rebirth actually happen.</br>  <br>leomon was there when malo myotismon was defeated, in the background.</br>  why has nobody told me this was a thing<br>why was I not informed digimon went propa orky?</br>  <br>Wait, Leomon WAS there?</br>  when are s1 bd's scheduled to be out?  <br>half past now</br>  When I was a kid, I often had a boner every time Patamon appeared on the screen because he's too cute. Am I normal?   my 15th anniversary Anime Color Digivice just arrived at my house like 30 minutes ago.   <br>for like a micro second onscreen, but he was there.</br>  <br>Oh shit, the Aranjuez one hit me in the feels. Man were we lucky to get the German dub in Romania.</br>      <br>Dude MetalGarurumon had missiles and guns all up inside him and he was Generation 1.<br> I hope to god the Digimon World Game coming out lets us turn Agumon into Wargreymon X and Gabumon into Metalgarurumon X so I can get Omegamon X </br></br>  Tumblr is complaining about the Angewomon figure being oververly sexualized. It's like they haven't even watched Digimon and that scantily cladded women are the norm.  <br>Man, Seraphimon never gets a break. Most people see Holyangemon as a super strong Digimon, but Serphimon's lost every single fight he's had in his appearances:<br><br>Digimon 02: Golden Digimentals: Plot device to get the Digimentals.<br>Frontier: Died like a fucking idiot<br>Digimon V-Tamer: Holyangemon managed to put up a better fight than Seraphimon. Hell, he jobbed so badly, that Holyangemon turned into Dominimon on his next appearance.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chaosdramon X baby</br>  <br>Well, she's much bustier than the Adventure version.<br><br>Her appearance is probably based on the new art that came out for Crusader. They kind of did the same to Lilithmon around that time.<br><br>They were both busty, but the new art made them much bustier.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> kids show </br>  <br>You meant Cyber Sleuth? It doesn't. That game only has Wargreymon, Blackwargreymon, and Shinegreymon for the Ultimate Greymon line, while it only has Blackmetalgarurumon, and Metalgarurumon.<br><br>If it's any consolation, the Black versions can combine into Omegamon Zwart.</br></br></br>  Which series should I rewatch first, Adventure or Tamers?  <br>Adventure, Tamers is overrated.</br>  <br>Why do they insist with black versions? Does anyone find them interesting?<br><br> no VictoryGreymon <br>They fucked up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They had to make a new game, and models for the Digimon. Hopefully they make more for the sequel.</br>  <br>When I was a kid I appreciated how vulnerable the Tamers kids were. I also liked how their inner conflict wasn't solved in one 11 minute episode like western cartoons.</br>  <br>Yeah but the point no one shouldn't be surprised about a woman bearly wearing anything getting a scale model figure wearing barely anything but bustier.</br>  <br>That didn't stop the show from having major problems  <br><br>Adventure had some near the end, but Tamers had a bunch of them, and some were around for a good chunk of the show.</br></br></br>  <br> -Zhuqiaomon gave Impmon the power to evolve to Mega, so why the fuck didn't he give it to the Deva? <br>They made the entire world evolve to Mega to fight the D-Reaper, but fuck the devas.</br></br>  <br>In order<br><br>- The Devas are supposed to be strong especially for Perfect level digimon hence why they gang up on them.<br>- The last few Devas left were the weakest, hence why they don't go off to fight. Lopmon switched sides becasue she questioned Zhuqiaomon's views on humans.<br>- Because the ones left were weaklings, and besides Impmon had nothing to lose.<br>- That's seems more like a personal opinion, but the digimon is actually based off of a priest, hence why its more defensive. Also Ruki chose Renamon because among all the digimon that approached her, Renamon made her feel safe.<br>- It's those digimon, because he already has a Tamer as to why they can't do it, and Hirokazu didn't unlock Andromon on his own, and before you bring up Impmon Mako and Ai didn't become his tamers until the last episodes.<br>- Not an asspull actually here's a hint actually pay attention to the info dumps.<br>- What do you expect for them to say to her? Also Ruki and Takato did try but they didn't know what to do. On the train ride to Juri's house, Takato tries to comfort her but of course that wasn't Juri.<br>- Impmon was acting like any digimon would, all digimon have an in grained instinct to fight and get stronger, but of course Impmon could not do so because the kids who were supposed to be his Tamers were too young and treated him like a toy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All the Devas were dead by then.<br><br><br>Because the others never tried to use the data they loaded, that's not even a plot hole, that's just exploring a mechanic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>All of those complaints either file under personal complaints for anon just not paying attention.</br>  <br>The Alphamon in tri. is not one of the Royal Knights.<br><br><br>Homeostasis hosts the Adventure world.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's probably one of the international chosen children partners.</br>  Would love to pick up the first series blurays, but don't want to drop 250 quid for the pleasure.  <br><br>-Except the perfects jobbing and the devas being a joke cannot happen at the same time, since the perfects mostly fought the devas. You could complain about the perfects not being used much, but at the time they came into being a lot earlier than they did in Aventure and 02, and they did keep all the forms relevant rather than just use the most powerful they had at the time.<br>- The deva's mega's are the sovereign, although it's not the only option for them...<br>-You could argue that for taomon, since she did spam that shield, but sakuyamon was killing D-Reaper agents by the dozens.<br>-Asspul they were working on for a lot of time, use stuff that had already showed before hand, and still required outside help to even work. So not an asspul.<br>-Well, takato, kazu and ruki tried, but she was replaced by J-Reaper far too fast too even have a chance.<br>-Except they didn't just forgive him when he became Blast mode, they were already tolerating him and trying to forgive him as far back as when ruki and renamon rescued and took him back to the real world oboard the ark.<br><br>Full power was never the case, but the special abilities part was kind of implied by the way the cards worked. Which is way only impmon really used the ability, although yeah other digimon should have showed it too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no, these are digimon already in the digital world, they will arrive via beams of light later.</br>  <br>Oh crap, Memorial day is pretty close. I need to find something Digimon related to do.</br>  <br>digimons look neat, chosen ones generic and shitty they were better in the 00s</br>  <br>There probably is more than one Leomon in the entire Digital World, then.</br>  <br> All the Devas were dead by then. <br>They would have been alive if their bosses had evolved them to mega instead of just letting them job.</br></br>  <br>Alphamon will be a royal knight. They always are, even when mindcontrolled into working for Lucemon.<br><br>And it's hardly the first time they fight eachother, imagine seeing the trailer for X-evolution and seeing Omegamon vs Dukemon.<br>That wasn't so simple was it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Adventure's Omegamon isn't a Royal Knight. Tamers' Dukemon isn't a Royal Knight. 02's Magnamon isn't a Royal Knight. So, no, they aren't always Royal Knights.<br><br>The issue is not them fighting each other. On September issue of V-Jump they presented the fight as being between "2 Ultimate Digimon", in no way are the Royal Knights referenced on the whole page.</br></br></br>  <br>Not royal knight as working unit but the core of what the royal knights themselves are supposed to be.<br>Whatever they do will be for good so any clash is pretty much limited by that they won't be actual enemies.</br></br>  <br>What are you talking about? Look, I am in no way again they fighting, I don't know why you keep bringing that up. Royal Knights won't have anything to do with tri., at least by the info we have up until now.<br><br>Anyway, yeah, they probably won't be enemies, maybe only during the first movie.</br></br></br>  <br>Royal knight is faction and applies to the species, the same way nightmare soldiers and mechanical empire also apply to multiple digimon...</br>  Great name, great title.  I'd chest her if you know what I mean.    Is nashetania retarded or something?    <br>That MILF tits</br>  <br>She is merely pretending.</br>  <br>Adlet a shit also weakest hero.<br><br> Bunny is the 7th <br><br> Adlet also the 8th cause he was brainwashed <br><br> Hans is best boy </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So are they stuck on namek temple for few more eps figuring out who's the traitor before actually proceeding with their quest?  why does our mc call himself the strongest when he seems to have no abilities whatsoever  <br>Yeah probably 2 episodes this whole arc is the rest of the 1st LN</br>  <br>You mean that he's not a saint of whatever or something? Saints are chick exclusive.</br>  <br>He doesn't need special ability to be the strongest.</br>  <br>He is the weakest in terms of the saints abilities  cause he has non whatsoever <br>, but he is actully extremely intelligent or at least smarter than all the other 5 4  combined.<br><br> He stopped the other 5 heros from killing each other which was about to happen cause they're retarded </br></br></br></br>  But I liked the 1st ED.   new ED <br> it's about Bunny <br> title is "Dance in the Fake" <br>Not to mention it sounded cray cray like Nadeko's Mousou Express.<br>There's foreshadowing, hinting, and there's this.<br>Is there any reason to believe that she isn't the 7th? Could Bunnyfags defend this?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's cute, and most cute anime girls aren't traitors.</br>  <br> Everyone was spoiled that she was the 7th as soon as there was a thread for the first episode. Bunny's and everyone else's bullshit goes way past that. </br>  <br> title is "Dance in the Fake" <br>the fuck how obvious do they wanna make it</br></br>  <br>But Flamy is cuter.</br>  <br>All this time I've been laughing at Chester, but didn't notice the double joke. Or even triple.</br>  <br>I completely agree, but Bunny is still pretty cute in her own right.</br>  <br>dude whats her deal<br>she won't explain anything and is a bitch<br>if it wasn't for the weird ass mc she would be dead right now<br>what is her fucking deal?</br></br></br></br>  <br>abandonment and muh trust issue</br>  <br>If it wasn't Adlet she wouldn't even meet the others.</br>  <br>her goal is the demonlord<br>she would have to cross over eventually<br>sooner or later she would run into the other 6 and get killed wildly outnumbered</br></br></br>  <br>Bunny isn't the 7th. That was Adlet. Bunny is just someone pretending but isn't related to the Majin.<br><br>Adlet's the real bad guy.</br></br></br>  <br> Because that's Adlet.<br><br>She's a fake hero too, though.</br></br> </br>  <br>She looks like shit. Every other girl looks better.</br>  <br>At first i think it's QUALITY.<br>But now i think it just anime staff don't like bunny.</br></br>  What idiot thought 30 seconds of spinning at 5 fps was a good fucking idea.  Also some of the most god awful, jarring 3d ive ever seen  I think she's not daijoubu.  <br>Probably had the same director as webm related.</br>  Ending kind of pandered to Gondolf/Bunny.  Her hairstyle looks as if she tried to pluck her hair.   mfw all QUALITY this episode <br>Might as well wait for the BDs, judging by Rail Wars the animation won't get better</br>  <br>This physically hurts my eyes.</br>   Episodes: 12  <br>What are they even trying to achieve with this?</br>  <br>Only volume 1</br>  <br>You mean vol 2. Vol 1 is about to end.</br>  <br>There still are 3+epilogue chapter of vol.1 left, for now anime just ended 38% of vol.1</br>  <br>My eyes</br>  I was starting to have some respect for Adlet but he's starting to annoy me with his MUH FLAMIE SHE A GOOD GIRL, also it's funny that's she's called Flamie because she's always starting shit.<br>At least he's still the only character that isn't completely retarded.</br>    <br> Flamie <br>Where the hell did this come from?</br></br>  <br><br>But she's a good girl</br></br>  <br>He's reasoning was that she's a brave willing to kill the demon lord and that she was choose. <br><br>Doesn't matter anyways because everyone is a fucking retard is about kill each other.</br></br></br>  <br>You gonna love the fact that he's brainwashed into loving that bitch.</br>  <br>The first episodes had all the names written properly. Why did they feel the need to change now.</br>  <br>http://rokka-anime.us/character/fla<wbr>mie+/<br>because the official names are out</br></wbr></br>  <br> Saint of Pond </br>  <br>Hans a annoying fag.</br>  <br>Swamp is just too uncute</br>  <br>Is that English site more official than the LN? </br>  <br>He's deluded. Or at least he only says that because he wants to believe.</br>  <br>sweet baby jesus 'Mountains' is right</br>  <br>It's fucking Fremy. Whoever's subbing this should kill himself.</br>  <br>Aren't LN character images edited by the translator?</br>  <br>No, and the one I posted is volume 5.</br>  <br>Yeah I hated that. I liked the TDKR reference though.</br>  <br>They should totally do it faster.</br>  <br>36 YEARS OLD</br>  <br>Whoever's made the official english site should kill himself.</br>  <br>Actually the author changed the names on the official anime site.</br>  <br>Author should kill himself.</br>  <br>Isn't she 26 or so? 29 maybe?</br>  <br>Source, your ass?</br>  <br>Its like World Trigger all over again.</br>  <br>I just try to only look at the backgrounds and ignore anything that moves.</br>    <br>Delicious Saint. I'd climb her mountains. Shame they got her eye alignment messed up on her intro.</br>  <br>Not sure if real,  She's the one who killed THE STRONGEST MAN's family and the love spell from that Kyoma is undone, THE STRONGEST MAN will probably sink the ship.{/spoiler] </br>   I'm the strongest man in the world <br><br>shut up!!!!!!!!!!!!!</br></br>  <br>Rabbitrayal.</br>  <br>Why is that boy wearing such clothes</br>  <br>Sometimes you just need a little self-reassurance.  Dumb frogposter </br>  <br>I have trabbles believing this bullshit.<br>Fortunately, it's a matter of time before I get to volume 5.</br></br>  <br> boy </br>  <br>Could Adlet defeat Dio and his World?</br>  Friendly reminder: <br><br>Aztec batman really is the STRONGEST MAN IN THE WORLD.</br></br>    <br> Aztec batman <br>Doesn't this mean Adlet is technically a spic?</br></br>  <br>That doesn't speak an once of spanish.<br>He is "native american".</br></br>  <br>Only if the Spaniards raped them and had a child.  They didn't. They wiped them off the face if the earth. </br>  <br>he's not even close to strongest<br><br>maybe, post yfw pillar men show up</br></br></br>  <br> implying you need a curse to love best girl </br>  <br>You would when your halfbreed qt gf slaughtered your family.</br>  <br>NO, what the fuck is this atrocity?</br>  <br>And still so fine, her husband is a lucky bastard.</br>  <br>Still stronger than you.</br>  <br>Are you saying that the original is better?<br> muh tits  <br>That bra looks so silly</br></br></br>  <br>Where is her husbando anyway?</br>  <br>Keeping the temple running in her absence.</br>  <br>Being a househusband</br>  <br>living the dream</br>  <br>Their daughter is dying though.</br>  <br> being agile and smart useful in combat <br> tricksters never win any fights <br> only magic flashy powers count as strength! <br>yeah, fuck off</br></br></br></br>  <br> name that sounds like a a 14 year old chicks MMO username <br> no emotion <br> kill everyone and run, talking never <br> also pretty much shadow the hedgehog <br>bunny girl is pretty shit too, i will give you that</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> skinny and lanky body <br> awful haircut <br> ugly face <br> bitch personality </br></br></br></br>  <br>NYA-HA!</br>  <br>we trouble in terrorist town now</br>  <br>Free excuse to make more</br>  <br>Old habits die hard I guess.</br>  <br>Fuck him. Worst Brave.</br>  <br>That's shit. Stop that.</br>  <br>I think she's cute personally but I'm not sure that'll be the case after she starts using her saint powers.</br>  <br><br>This is still absolutely haram, make her fully covered in burka</br></br>  I like her the most!<br><br>Any Mora fans?</br></br>  <br>can I sniff her ass</br>  <br>He's gone back to revenge mode now, and thinking about killing Fremy.</br>  <br>source?  so I can avoid it </br>  <br>No, because he  actually has genuine feelings for Fremy and the thing about killing his sister is more mind manipulation shit. </br>  Did whoever designed her character not think this might look strange? Or is her right eye magical?  <br>I will believe 2ch and not you.</br>  <br>Of course it's magic. This is anime.</br>  <br>try watching more than 5 anime</br>  <br>What's your point?</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure he's referring to the fact that she's aiming down the gun with her blindfolded eye.</br>  <br><br>again, watch more anime</br></br>  <br>It's an obvious animation mistake, she should be aiming out of her other eye.</br>  <br>It's literally the demon eye.</br>  <br>But anon,  I am 2ch. </br>  <br>I watched nearly 200 series. I don't get your point. Unless you're just saying it's like that cos anime. In which case, fair enough.</br>  <br><br>Again, stop trying so fucking hard.</br></br>  <br>Tell that to Snake.</br>  <br><br>It's fuckin obvious her eye has powers are you guys this stupid?</br></br>  <br><br>I am gonna assume you are saying that her right eye is indeed magical, not merely trolling. In which case you could've just said so.</br></br>  <br>Well he did ask if it was magical or something. So instead of just answering the question you just went full retard. Round of applause to you sir.</br>  <br> never mentioned directly <br> never alluded to <br>For all we know this could have been QUALITY or negligence on the studio's part. Your suggestion that its "obvious" is naive. The typical "it's magic, i ain't gotta explain shit" explanation is lazy and ridiculous.</br></br></br>  What is she trying to say?  <br>That you are too tight-assed and you should take life with more gusto.</br>  I'm sorry, I don't speak FAT ASS  <br>She's showing you the proper way to drink sake from a bottle.</br>  "Please feed me, I'm hungry"  4 &gt;<br>5 &gt;<br>7 &gt;<br>6 &gt;<br>3 &gt;<br>1 &gt;<br>2<br><br>Do you agree?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  1&gt;7&gt;2&gt;4&gt;6&gt;3&gt;5  <br>They are all great. It's useless to rate and compare them.</br>  5=6&gt;4&gt;8&gt;7&gt;2&gt;1&gt;3<br><br>D4C is best stando though</br></br>  <br>I only  watched the first 3 parts in the anime and I'm currently finishing off Part 4. <br><br>So I can only say for now.<br><br> 4&gt;2&gt;3&gt;1 </br></br></br></br></br>  Anime only fag here, how long until they animate the entire manga? The music and everything is perfect for the tone, that I don't think I can follow the manga for  <br>Read the fucking manga you pleb</br>  <br>At least skip to SBR and read that, it's not as if they'll ever get around to animating it and it's the first part in a new universe so no spoilers.</br>  <br>Jotaro dies.</br>  4=2&gt;1&gt;5&gt;3<br> haven't read the rest yet </br>  <br><br>Why do you people come here? Do you enjoy being spoiled?</br></br>  <br>Where else do I talk about Jojo?</br>  batoto running like shit for anyone else?  7 &gt; 4 &gt; 2 &gt; 6 &gt; 3 &gt; 5 &gt; 1  <br>just let it die</br>  <br>7 &gt; 4 &gt; 2 &gt; 1 &gt; 5 &gt; 6 &gt; 3</br>  <br>7&gt;6&gt;2&gt;5=4&gt;3&gt;1<br><br>So far I think 8 is gonna end up in the top 3</br></br></br>  <br>7=4&gt;3=2&gt;5&gt;6&gt;1</br>  4=7&gt;6&gt;3&gt;2&gt;1&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;5    mfw someone tries to tell me that Valentine is evil   <br>Valentine is a ãSuper Reatardã though, fuck him and his gay napkins</br>  2&gt;5&gt;7&gt;3&gt;1&gt;8&gt;6&gt;4  7&gt;4&gt;2&gt;5&gt;6&gt;3&gt;1  <br>everyone in the world except maybe Giorno die in part 6</br>  4&gt;2&gt;7&gt;3&gt;5&gt;1&gt;6  <br>No they don't, if you know how MiH works then you'd know only the main cast die.</br>  <br>6&gt;7&gt;Second half of 4&gt;3&gt;2&gt;First half of 4&gt;1&gt;5</br>  So what are the actual chances of part IV being animated? 3 didn't perform that well and there was no teaser for IV.  <br> 3 didn't perform that well and there was no teaser for IV. <br>Fuck off retard</br></br>   4 <br> always at first or second top choice here <br><br>I liked part 4 but it wasn't THAT good. I can see 2 and 7, but why do people like slice of life jojo that much?</br></br></br>  <br>No u.</br>  <br>Because they like JoJo and SoL. Part 2 is a lot worse than 4 as well. Reading 7 and 8 has made me hate the villain of the week stuff in the first 6 parts as well.</br>  <br>seven stand of the week but pretty much all of them advanced the plot or built character in some way. They didn't feel like they were just there to add time and could be taken out with no consequence</br>  <br>7&gt;5&gt;6&gt;4&gt;2&gt;1=3<br>side stories<br>purple haze feedback &gt; DMQ &gt; UEUJ &gt; all of the rohan shit &gt; dolce</br></br></br>  <br> 5 and 6 <br> above 4 and 2 <br>Let me vomit all over your opinion.</br></br></br>  <br>Everything before kira is shit and only saved by okuyasu comedy. <br> part 2 <br> everybody except jseph is useless <br> nobody even knows if kars is evil they just assume he is <br> biggest asspull ending in jojo </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> part 2 <br> biggest asspull <br>I think that honour goes to Gold Experience requim.<br>And 5 and 6 were shittier than 4 and 2</br></br></br></br>   All this 6 hate <br>Literally shit taste across the thread. None of you respect Gay Priest. This is disgusting.</br>  Just started watching 2012 Part 1 and 2<br>I like Araki's taste in music, <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-Td<wbr>u4uKSZ3M</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>can't wait for part 6 to get animated so people start hating gay priest<br>unfortunately that means part 4 gets animated first so everyone will hate josuke and kira</br></br>  <br>Fuck off memelord</br>  <br> start hating gay priest <br>  will hate josuke and kira <br>Why would this happen? Who would hate Josuke?</br></br></br>  <br>It's not a meme faggot, it's faith.</br>  <br> hating Gay Priest <br><br>Gay priest will be arriving shortly to correct that.</br></br></br>  <br>Uh no Kars was the genius that created the mask that created vampires. He was the leader of a crusade against humanity from 2000 years ago that an entire army of humans fought to seal away. Literal first thing they do is impale human beings to feast on their blood. It's later revealed that their race had lived secluded from humanity and didn't need to go out and feed on humans. Kars killed em all, and didn't even leave a woman alive for some reason, now being guilty of genocide against two races of beings.</br>  <br><br>Part 6 isn't going to get animated and neither will Part 4. They animated the part normies care most about, they will stop now.</br></br>  It's kinda ironic that a gay priest got killed by an underage shota.  <br>Kars did nothing wrong.</br>  7&gt;2&gt;1&gt;shit&gt;the rest  <br>It was only Kars that hated humans and wanted to kill them, though.</br>  Gay priest is here now.  <br>Gay Priest might not come to a thread full of heretics.</br>  <br><br>Oh, nevermind, he's here now.</br></br>  <br>Where are you getting this shit from?</br>  <br>7&gt;4&gt;6&gt;2&gt;1&gt;5&gt;3</br>  <br> arrow being setup since part <br> getting new powers from the arrow a thing since kira <br> the entire last two volumes spent on finding the arrow for the single purpose of beating the boss and it turns out to work <br>vs<br> strohiem is suddenly on the plane <br> vacano ride into space but that only worked because kars decided to get off the rock, got hit by joseph's hand which shouldn't even be able to pierce his skin, get hit by several rocks which pushed him into space <br> also joseph survives the fall back to earth that should have killed him even if he landed in the water <br><br><br>OK nigga</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>7&gt;4&gt;2&gt;6&gt;1&gt;5&gt;3</br>  Joseph best Jojo  <br>2 is heavily overrated and it lives only on Joseph being entertaining as hell, most of the other characters are crap and it never compares to the best moments of the other parts.</br>  <br> arrow being setup since part <br>to give stands<br> getting new powers from the arrow a thing since kira <br>getting manageble powers through the arrow. Bites the Dust isn't that powerful and can easily be defeated as shown.<br> the entire last two volumes spent on finding the arrow for the single purpose of beating the boss and it turns out to work <br>In a way that completely defeats all build up, requires no talent or using your brains and is nothing more than 'I stab myself, now I instantly win without challenge". Even Jotaro used his brains to defeat Dio.<br><br>Stroheim barely did anything there except breaking Joseph's fall<br>Kars lost because he got distracted by Joseph using his "your next line will be X" trick while volcanic rocks were clearly flying up everywhere around him<br>The surviving part I'll give you.<br><br>So on one hand we have a MC who wins through sheer luck, the same luck that has saved him his entire life.<br>On the other hand we have a lousy final battle that only happened because Araki wrote himself into a corner, forgetting that they already had a working trick against Diavolo that didn't involve pulling an arrow out of your butt.<br><br>Part 2 might be have asspulls, but they are completely in line with the main character and actually get a reasonable explanation why they worked the way they did.<br><br>Part 5 didn't have that. It had powers that were immediately abandoned the next issue because the whole frog thing with Luca removed every challenge later on, same with the slow motion brain acceleration punch of Gold Experience.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You only hate part 2 because you don't want to look like an animefag</br>  <br>I don't hate any Jojo part. I just don't like part 2 as much as most of the other parts.</br>  <br> 6&gt;7&gt;4&gt;5&gt;3&gt;2&gt;1 </br>  4&gt;2&gt;6&gt;3&gt;5&gt;1<br>Just starting part 7 now</br>  <br> 'I stab myself, now I instantly win without challenge" <br>except the entire race for the arrow where they had to use their brains and skills to best diavolo<br><br> the same luck that has saved him his entire life. <br>Did we read the same part because joseph always got by on planning I can't think of many instances where he just got lucky.<br><br> Stroheim barely did anything there except breaking Joseph's fall <br>doesn't change that he was shown on the grround while the plane was in the air. He also made sure Kars was stuck to the plane as it crashed and saving joseph in situation where he would be dead otherwise is no small thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Change 3 and 5 and I agree<br>Would be m8s</br></br>  7=2&gt;4&gt;6&gt;3&gt;1&gt;5  <br> complaining about GE's powers <br> while supporting the constantly broken/bent rules of hamon <br><br>Reminder<br> star finger, seeing throw your stands eyes <br> josukes constantly changed fixing abilities <br> jolyne needing to unravel her body to make stone free <br> johnny needing the corpse for his stand, steph steel knows the goldern rectangle running technique, steel ball failed because it wasn't perfectly round while nails work, <br> Everybody does it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> except the entire race for the arrow where they had to use their brains and skills to best diavolo <br>Diavolo literally did all the work for them.<br>Then it went "Hey Diavolo check this out" while Giorno stole the arrow.<br><br> Did we read the same part because joseph always got by on planning I can't think of many instances where he just got lucky. <br>The majority of his tricks relied on luck. Best example that comes to mind is where his sledgehammer sticks t his ring. Most of his tricks are not much more than quickly adapting to a sudden change of events. Deepest he ever went was against esidisi with the rope trick.<br><br> doesn't change that he was shown on the grround while the plane was in the air. <br>Actually if you look at the panel where Joseph flies over Speedwagon you can see that Stroheim was no longer there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>About a year ago I tried getting into the anime to see what all the fuss was about. I really enjoyed part 1, made it pretty far into part 2, then lost interest. I picked it up again this year, finished what little I had left in part 2, then watched Stardust. <br><br>I think Phantom Blood and Stardust are much more interesting than Battle Tendency.</br></br></br>  7&gt;4&gt;6&gt;2&gt;1&gt;3&gt;5  <br><br>They are. But Part 4 onwards is more interesting than Part 1 &amp; 2.</br></br>  <br>You know there's more than three parts, right?</br>  Was he an alien? Or just a dumb stand user?  <br>Swap 5 and 6 and this is perfect</br>  <br> Diavolo literally did all the work for them. <br>The only thing he did was figure out how to beat SCR they kept the arrow from him on multiple occasions using sex pistols, spice girl, the blood trick, and GE's life making power. <br><br>I still think it a bit much put joseph's stuff off as luck. Even when they are it was still planning that got him that far, there was no planning in the final bit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The greatest fuck ups of hamon were the magnetism trick, that it could destroy rock in part 1, but not harm the petrified pillarmen in part 2, which resulted in Caesar's battle with Wamuu having no other possible ending that Caesar dying like a bitch.<br><br>One could say that Hamon has shown less inconsistencies than stands did.<br>Not that stands are less fun, but Araki should keep a memo of what he is doing at times.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What magnetism trick?</br>  <br>He would have won if he didn't try to backstab Johnny. Clearly he cares more about his ego than his country.</br>  <br> final ripple <br> dire's head using hamon on the rose </br></br>  <br><br>I can see japan not caring about 6, what with strong female protagonist and all. But 4? Seems right up japans alley.</br></br>  <br> 5 that high <br> 2 at the bottom <br>You are so full shit I can smell it through the screen</br></br></br>  <br> what with strong female protagonist and all <br>What</br></br>  <br> the blood trick <br>Which was perfect to use since it clearly worked, shows tactical insight and would have made a better death for Diavolo than Gold Experience lol instant win for me Requiem.<br><br> there was no planning in the final bit. <br>He only said to Kars that he planned it, only to immediately refute it afterwards, almost explicitly stating that luck saved his sorry behind.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but part 6 was less well received partly due to American setting and female protagonist.<br><br>Aka they have shit taste. They put 5 above it..</br></br></br>  <br>Japan likes cute girls, not girls that act like men.<br> This is why Japan is infinitely superior to America in terms of social media </br></br>  <br>Isn't part 4 the most popular in Japan</br>  <br><br>I'm not saying he's a alien. <br><br>But he's a alien.</br></br></br></br>   doppio will never be a part of the gang in part five. <br> helps them out of sticky situations, bonds with them all through hijinks. <br> keeps getting mysterious "calls" though we're unsure of why <br> the guy they were looking for was with them all along </br></br></br>  <br>Is this true or are you pulling it out of your ass?</br>  <br>Its true.</br>  <br>Okay I believe you anon</br>  <br>When they fled from Tarkus using the leaves.<br><br><br>I'd consider both Zeppeli's being able to properly breathe after the shit they've gone through much more unbelievable than giving your ripple powers to someone else.<br><br> dire's head using hamon on the rose <br> not the fact that Dire's head still functioned after being frozen and nothing more than a fucking head. <br>Honestly the hamon rose was the least bizarre part of that moment.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most clues lead to him being an alien or some other being, but not a stand user.<br><br>even Holly could see stands and she was barely conscious of her own at the time.<br><br>If he had a stand he should have been able to see Crazy Diamond, but he didn't.</br></br></br></br></br>  Josuke &gt; Joseph &gt; jolyne &gt;johnny &gt;Giorno&gt;jotaro&gt;johnathan <br><br> kira&gt;funny&gt;priest&gt;dio&gt;Kais/pillarm<wbr>en &gt;diavolo </wbr> <br><br>7&gt;4&gt;2&gt;6&gt;5&gt;3&gt;1</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh anon I didn't mean the zeppeli's final ripple.

I'm trudging through part 6 just to get to cowboys.  <br>How is it boring?</br>  why are there 3 jojo threads? cant you retards keep it together?  <br>Just stick with it.</br>  <br><br>I started reading it after watching the anime, so maybe I'm spoiled by DP's color changes and ost.</br></br>  <br> Muh Jotaro died <br>Good, Gay Priest a best.</br></br>  <br>The problem is that KC can kill during the skip narancia, and cutting the guys hand off. Making it useless for anybody getting attacked by KC.</br>  <br>Absolutely. Too bad saying Joseph is best Jojo results in being called an anime only these days.<br><br>Joseph&gt;Josuke&gt;Johnny&gt;Jolyne&gt;Jonatha<wbr>n&gt;Giorno&gt;Jotaro</wbr></br></br></br>  6&gt;2=4&gt;3=5&gt;1<br>Didn't even know so many people hated part 6</br>  <br>Not really</br>  <br>You forgot 7<br>7&gt;4&gt;2&gt;6&gt;1&gt;3&gt;5</br></br>  <br>I didn't forget it. I didn't read it.<br> I already know who dies so there's no need to spoil it. </br></br>  <br> Part 1 below part 3 and part 6 <br>Talk about a Red flag.</br></br>  7 &gt; 4 &gt; 6 &gt; 2 &gt; 1 &gt; 3 &gt; 5<br>Kira &gt; Valentine &gt; Pucci &gt; DIO =/&gt; Diavolo &gt; Kars<br><br>I don't hate any of them, some are just better than others.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but how do they die?<br>Johnny gets his head crushed by Diego's The World<br>Diego gets eaten by a stand<br>Gyro's body gets lost in Johnny's infinite rotation, but they bring back a Gyro from a dimension where Johnny died</br></br></br></br>  Part 2 is one of the worst written parts, it's only saving grace is that Joesph is a great character and that part 3 and part 6 is worse.<br>4 &gt; 7 &gt; 1 &gt; 5 &gt; 2 &gt; 6 &gt; 3</br>  <br>  resets the universe <br> couldn't beat a child <br><br>Gay priest a shit. A SHIT</br></br></br></br>  <br>7&gt;4&gt;2&gt;6&gt;5&gt;3&gt;1</br>  So should i skip part 5 for now? I've just got to Ignition-One's scans and I don't know if I should put up with that.  Steel Ball Run is overrated.<br><br>And so is JoJolion, while I'm at it.</br></br>  <br>Only thing i'd really change about Part 4 would be giving this fucker more screen time. They even show that he's still in the town, you think they'd visit more often.</br>  Just finished the anime's part 2, I'm really fucking enjoying it. I can't believe I waited this long.  <br>Just read through white album, Mettallica, and the final arc. They're pretty much the only good things about the part 5</br>  <br>Listen here you little shit<br><br>Do you even know what overrated means?<br><br>Sword Art Online is overrated.<br><br>Shingeki no Kyojin is overrated.<br><br>Mirai Nikki is overrated.<br><br>Something is overrated because it's trash that doens't deserve to be popular or considered good.<br><br>Meanwhile, Steel Ball Run is fantastic and deserves all popularity it gets. Just because it's popular doens't mean it's overrated, do you understand? Yes? No? Ok.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Everything will change. For the better, although you might not see at first.</br></br>  <br>Is D4C objectively the most useful stand</br>  <br> Listen here you little shit <br><br> Do you even know what overrated means? <br><br> Popular thing I dont like is overrated. <br><br> I dont like thing and no one else should either <br><br>you rn</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't get it, he is right. SBR isn't even that popular to be overrated.</br>   Gay Priest will be arriving in toy form shortly   <br>Not going to deny that, but the use of the word overrated in general is  overrated </br>  Who is best all in all the Jojo's series, and why is  Diego?   <br>jotaro and star platinum oraoraoraoraoraora he killed diego</br>  <br><br>The art in 7 was phenomenal.<br><br>Part 8 feels too stiff which is disappointing.</br></br></br></br>  <br> he killed Diego <br>Are you even trying?</br></br>  <br>have you even watched the anime? jojotaro killed dio</br>  <br> Awakened head with White Snake <br>I mean I know that he'll probably have his first head, but all this means we'll get Kira all over again. Meaning just his alternare hair, no alternate expression.</br></br>  <br> have you even watched the anime? jojotaro killed dio <br> Posts Joseph killing Kira </br></br>  <br>He's got a neat stand<br>He's very ambitious and worked for everything he had instead of having it handed to him like Dio<br>He made out with Hot Pants</br></br></br>  <br>Everything Joseph done is so entertaining. Definitely the best Jojo by far.</br>   Part rankings <br><br>Nobody cares, this thread is shit</br></br>  <br> 4's habit of following different characters for different chapters keeps things fresh. Even some stand-of-the-week villains like Highway Star get their own chapters <br> Above point results in the most compelling villain in the series, as Kira gets his own chapters. <br> Characters are more entertaining, goofy and lively than the previous parts   Joseph excluded obviously <br> stand powers become stranger and the fights become more unconventional <br> Koichi shows more character development than any character up to that point in the series <br> Small town setting gives protagonists opportunities to call in allies for back-up <br> Small town setting simultaneously provides excuses to drag ex-villains in as allies as the plot demands it; characters need to live in Morioh together after all, so its in everybody's best interests to get along post-asskicking <br> Protagonists forced into being reactive rather than proactive gives believable excuses for allies not being present for certain fights, as they all need to keep living their normal lives while searching for Kira/arrows <br> Highway Star <br> Josuke is top 3 Jojo material <br><br>I don't know if it's the best part exactly, but it's got a shitload going for it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that it could destroy rock in part 1, but not harm the petrified pillarmen in part 2 <br>I figured that was because Jonathan was a Hamon prodigy or something.

How the snails represent the darkness trying to block out the rainbows that could wash away the racism blocking his image.</br>  <br>I thought the snails represented how truly slow our society is at solving our racial issues. <br>The rainbow and black cop are supposed to show that we are living in a happy go lucky post racial society, but the snails and the fact that he is a policeman, shatter the image and show that he is still but a tool to enforce long held racial standards. <br>#blacklivesmatter<br>#justicefortrayvon<br>#justtitsformichaelbrown<br>#fuckthepolice<br>#comingstriaghtfromtheunderground<br>#youngniggagotibadcuzhebrown</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder how the anime will interpret Funny transforming from a dwarf into that?</br>  <br><br><br><br>I swear I've seen this exact chain of posts before.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I haven't but it's entirely impossible because my comment was a meme</br>  <br>1-3 were pretty bad, but 4-7 were good, although 4 is the best.

Of course it had it's flaws but I still think it's good</br></br>  <br> Memeventure </br>  <br><br>part four was average and you know it</br></br>   I really like Part 1 but no one else does. <br><br>I mean it's not the best, but Dio was better in Part 1 than Part 3, Jonathan was the most tragic Jojo, the whole stone mask thing, I kind of like it and wish it was a bit longer.</br></br>  <br>I don't wish it was longer, it was boring.<br>4 &gt; 5 &gt; 7 &gt; 6 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1</br></br>  HOTPANTS<br>O<br>T<br>P<br>A<br>N<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel you and agree wholeheartedly with what you say. 4 and 7 get too much of the shares of love around here. Part 6 is better than people give it credit for too, Gay Priest meme be damned (to hell, seriously, go away).</br>  <br>It's okay anon, I really like Part 1 as well</br>  <br>Jonathan was best JoJo, though I think if Part 1 was longer it'd run into some really bad pacing issues.<br><br><br>Didn't you say in a previous thread that you were going t shitpost something other than Hotpants?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Part 5 ranked that high </br>  <br>I honestly have a problem where I can't rate things well. I kind of just liked all the parts, I didn't really hate any of them, either. Maybe it's because I've gotten used to what they are, and forgotten my first feelings on the parts when I had first read them. I remember being really uncomfortable with certain things in part 6, and maybe 5, but I forget and it's over with anyway.</br>  <br>I don't only just post HOTPANTS then leave the thread and no I never said that.<br><br> 7 &gt; 4 &gt; 6 &gt; 2 &gt; 1 &gt; 3 &gt; 5 </br></br></br>  <br> Part 4 is basically nichijojou </br>  <br>No I just told him after I apologized for telling him/them to kill themselves to shitpost something else along with Hotpants, no idea if they responded or not.</br>  <br> Jonathan was best JoJo, though I think if Part 1 was longer it'd run into some really bad pacing issues <br><br>Well, I don't think it should have been as long as, say, Part 4, but I think another volume or something would have been nice. It just feels really short. But maybe that's a good thing to some people.</br></br></br>  Just started Stardust Crusader <br><br>Does this guy get any better or will he remain an insufferable bitch throughout?</br></br>  <br>It just felt really average to me. I get that its a "slice of life" but there was barely any progression in the story. The other parts felt like everything was important.</br>  <br> You are right! </br>  <br>The latter. He is worst JoJo with a boner for one liners.</br>  <br>Gay Priest saves Jotaro's life in part 7.</br>  <br>He will reman an insufferable bitch.<br>In the anime they removed every piece of personality Jotaro had.

Unless you prefer your own imagination on the sound music and color that other's picked, whatever you'd like man. Also fuck gay priest</br>  <br> the art style shift in part 4 <br><br>I can only imagine how the rest of the series would've looked if Araki hadn't changed it so much.<br><br> I seriously can't stand his post-part 4 art style </br></br></br></br></br>   This motherfucker.   <br>I like his new style, the people are better proportioned</br>    <br>Part 5 art was bad for some reason, 6 got better but the proportions got really bad at some parts<br>Beginning of 7 looked good, Johnny didn't yell "JOJO" at first due to the early art but Araki hit his stride with middle to end of part 7, and I'm thankful to the monthly schedule for it. While i love the newer artstyles, Araki gets me annoyed drawing anyone before part 4, sans Jotaro, in his new artstyle.</br></br>  <br> MFW current art style Jonathan </br>  <br>Especially with him having Caesar's headband, I would't mind if Joseph wore it because he did at one point, but on Jonathan, plus being a twink is absolutely shit</br>  <br>Honestly first time I saw him I thought it was Rohan, then I saw Will next to him and went "Oh, it's a Zeppeli family pic- wait, but then why is Caesar next to Joseph in the next picture?"<br><br>Then after looking at it for a moment and realizing who it was I felt nothing but incoherent rage for defiling best JoJo.</br></br></br>  <br> Dollar sign hair <br><br>I'd totally missed that.</br></br></br>  <br> dollar sign hair <br>what u talkin bout</br></br>  <br>look at the side of the before pic</br>    <br>holy shit thanks for the point out</br>  4&gt;8&gt;2&gt;1=7&gt;6&gt;5&gt;3<br>stardust crusaders was god awful.</br>  http://bato.to/read/_/334877/jojos-<wbr>bizarre-adventure-part-8-jojolion_c<wbr>h45_by_hi-wa-mata-noboru<br><br>It's out on Batoto now.</br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br>Where were you Doc?

Joseph never conplained about shit. That and all his little asspulls feltwell done</br>  How would you feel if in the next series, stands are removed by some force and everything returns to ripple/hamon fighting shit? I want joseph 2  <br> asspulls <br> feltwell done <br>Makes no sense at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Johnathan was really admirable and manly if you ask me. Even if he was weak he'd push through by thinking things out, he'd try to understand his enemies, and he put other's well being before himself.<br><br>He had a lot of human flaws but that only gave more meaning to his almost saintly actions, like forgiving DIO.<br><br>Joseph was a silly underdog, so I can understand why he's popular but I prefer Johnathan.<br><br><br>Part 8 will more than likely be the last part of Jojo considering the rate at which it's being written. And getting rid of stands would be a terrible idea, they're the staple of the Jojo franchise.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What if  SHIZA lived?   <br>He gave all of his remaining sendo energy just like Will A Zepp. Even if he survived through the rock crushing him, he would be completely exhausted.</br>  N O P E<br>O<br>P<br>E</br></br></br>  Yukako's face doesn't work with other female characters.  <br>Hotpants the dinosaur everybody!</br>  <br>Random question:<br> Are the children of someone who can Dinosaur as a result of Scary Monsters capable of turning into dinosaurs themselves? </br></br>  <br>no, my dad works at araki</br>  <br>I didn't expect to end up liking him  but i did </br>      <br> how long until they animate the entire manga <br>25 years until part 8 anime starts, and by then the manga will be going strong with part 12</br></br>  Who is your favorite JoJo "Villian"  <br>Diego essentially managed to steal Scary Monsters thanks to the corpse part giving it to him as his own stand after the original user died. The other random civilians that got infected didn't have control over their transformation.<br><br>I'd say that if Diego or Ferdinand had a child, the child would not inherit Scary Monsters as their stand(assuming they're naturally born with a stand at all).<br><br>If two random people turned into dinosaurs, fucked, and laid eggs, the eggs would probably hatch as dinosaurs and potentially turn into human babies if stand effect was cancelled.<br>Or actually the more Araki thing I think would be dinosaur eggs hatching into human babies, but then the babies have freaky eyes and teeth and slowly morph into dinoform.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Someone actually tried to actually color this weird looking drawing.  ok but consider: gappy is best jojo<br><br>8 &gt; 5 &gt; 7 &gt; 4 &gt; 6 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 1</br></br>  JoJolion will end on  December 2018   <br> Okay but consider this: by some bullshit tactics (though all tactics in jojo are bullshit) the universe rests /again/ by the end of part 8.

It's great. Just finished first season of Stardust Crusaders.<br>[spoilers]Probably gonna read the manga from now on. [/spoiler]</br>    <br>Because people outside of /jojo/ thinks it's gay?<br>You have plenty to look forward to in the manga.</br></br>  What if  Jonathan didn't die?   <br>part 1 is best</br>  <br>4 &gt; 7 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 6 &gt; 5 &gt; 1</br>  <br> mfw i recognize every scene </br>  <br>7 &gt; 4 &gt; 2 = 3 &gt; 6 = 1 &gt; 5<br><br>You will not deny me the bro material that all Zepelli's are.</br></br></br>  Guyz, am i the only one who unsatisfied with the ending of part 7? I mean, zeppeli died for nothing, johny got fcking nothing, but recovered lis legs a lil bit. Seriously, even president's death was nothing. Joestar got tricked by dio fucking brando, defetaed by his own stand ability, he lost sacred remains and in the end the saviour of this world happened to be luci. LIke, for real? Wtf? Now i have this shit taste in my mouth. Arigato, based araki, you ruined it.  <br>those are some of the most well know scenes, people who don't read jojo probably recognize those.</br>  <br>Pls be bait</br>  1 &gt;&gt;&gt; Everything else<br>Fuck your stands and shit, soap opera jojo was best jojo.</br>  <br>Someone with great taste, at last.</br>  <br><br> Horrible taste. Parts 7 and 8 are also soap operas and they aren't 50 chapters long and bad.</br></br>  <br>If I got to ask Araki something I'd ask what was the point of his character because I don't get it.</br>  <br>exactly what I was gonna post. 10/10 taste<br><br>Not even hard really. 4 and 7 are undeniably best, 2 is a really close third (arguably best if we account for how great the anime adaption was), 1 and 5 are undeniably worst, 3 and 6 are middle but 3 has the edge for how great the Egypt arc was. 8 will probably wind up being pretty high-tier once it's actually finished.</br></br></br>  <br>you already posted him. Best villain with the best fucking stand.</br>  <br>Sorry, can't hear you over your shit taste.</br>  <br>I'm almost done with 4 and can say<br><br>2=3&gt;4&gt;1<br><br>I'm gonna leave now to avoid spoilers</br></br></br></br></br>  Started reading part 8 recently and already caught up. Wow this isn't even near the middle, is it? Is Araki ever going to finish this?  <br>It's probably gonna last 3 more years <br>Or more</br></br>  <br>You cannot be more wrong with that ranking</br>  <br>What chapter/page is this pic from?</br>  <br>Dude, that's fan art. It doesn't even look like Araki art.</br>  <br>What is it you like so much about 4? There's less of any sense of adventure that I liked about 2 and 3. There's no real threat of the world coming to an end, and I liked that aspect too. Also, some of the stands are just fucking stupid in 4.</br>  <br><br>Meant to respond to this. I'm drunk.</br></br>  <br>I feel kind of similar, though it depends whether part 8, which i just started reading elaborates on what happened johny</br>  <br>Love interest for jojo, except unlike Erina or Suzy-q he actually has some decent fight scenes</br>  <br><br>It felt more fun than most of the other parts. Part 3 was way too serious through the whole thing. Sure it had some silly moments, like the Mariah fight, but those were few and far between. On the other hand part 4 was so full of fun bits that I can't even remember most of them. <br><br> Josuke beating Aqua Necklace because he swallowed a glove <br> Yukako kidnapping Koichi and making him eat shredded dictionaries <br> Cheap Trick <br>Josuke and Okuyasu trying to get rich quick with Shigecchi<br> "I am an Alien" <br><br>It also had really cool serious fights as well, like everything involving Kira. I liked Shigecchi's Harvest more than DIO's World (widely considered the best part of SC), just because it felt more fun, and bizarre.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  (8 so far, feel free not to count this) &gt; 4 &gt; 2 &gt; 6 &gt; 7 &gt; 5 &gt; 1 &gt; 3  /r/ing pic related with Okuyasu and Shigecchi  <br>Stone Ocean began with a crappy masturbation joke and ended in a way that made me wish the last few chapters had been crappy masturbation jokes instead.<br><br>You cannot like 6. It is literally impossible to like 6.</br></br></br>  <br>It had several great 'wow' moments that made it pretty good. The mobius heart is one of my favourite bits in all of Jojo.</br>  <br>He's just the most irredeemable main character in JoJo and if he's seen as a love interest it pretty much undoes all of Jolyne's character development. Even Romeo is better than him.<br><br>I still stand by my opinion that it was one-sided to the end and Jolyne lied.</br></br></br>  What the fuck happened?  <br>I'll give you that, a lot of the character variety and development in 4 has been better than than previous chapters by far. I'd say Josuke and Joeseph are more interesting MCs than Jonathan and especially Jotaro. And I like that a lot of characters in 4 were handled in more complex ways than just some filler jobbers like in 3. But 2 and 3 just felt like they had a pace and setting that kept me more interested as far as action than 4. Love Deluxe is shit, already done with that guy that was Tarkus' partner in 1. And Enigma Boy was boring. So is the cat plant.<br><br>Maybe I'll change my mind once I've finished the other parts. I've def been reading 4 faster than any other parts do far.</br></br></br>  Let's just hypothetically say Araki ends up doing a sci-fi JoJo after JoJolion (he won't, I know).<br>Could he draw mechas well and how would something like that even look in his heavily human body focused art style?</br>  Is the new chapter out yet?  <br>part 4 seems to just drop a bunch of random characters.<br>Even though they defeated killer queen, most of the characters now dead (shigechi or aya for example) or the electric tower man, mikitaka and even main characters like koichi Yokako and Jotaro weren't shown in the manga much.<br>I think honestly Okuyasu or Rohan had more screentime than Josuke.<br>While incredibly good, it still felt a bit rushed of an end.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, check Batoto</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>You got him friendo</br>  <br>What a terrible format but  what fantastic taste </br>  <br>Might as well come back to /a/ by 2030</br>  <br> Condoning skipping <br>Who the fuck let this post go?</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but what the fuck did Araki do to Tonio? His nose was never flat like that. He isn't black.<br><br>In terms of anatomy, post part 6 seems to be heading in the right direction but the athleticism and /fit/ness is fully gone. Araki drawing pre part 4 characters is absolutely disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br>Shit fucking taste</br>  That single sunlight yellow overdrive.  <br>like faggy evas</br>  <br>He's the only good thing about part 6. Jolyne was a worthless JoJo who accomplished nothing in the end (at least Jonathan beat Dio in a fight), Jotaro was at his most useless and the crew didn't have a strong enough bond.

That's the one of the first plot twists in this part. But we don't know how, why etc. yet.</br>  <br> colouring male lips just because Araki did it in part 7 <br><br>Don't do that</br></br></br>  <br>But Araki did it in other parts as well.</br>  <br>Exactly what happened in the cap, an edgy fuck of an anon talks about wanting to kill people for pleasure, causing the other anon to explodes into rage and Idealism babble. The two anons agreed to meet up and beat the shit out of eachother in real life, but only under the condition that if the pure anon loses, they'll have rough sex.<br>I've said this before but I'm so damn jealous.</br></br>  <br>You're a faggot secondary that probably just started reading. Shit even that is too generous of an assumption to make.</br>  <br>7&gt;4&gt;5&gt;3&gt;2&gt;6&gt;1</br>  <br>Like the other guy said, he's both Josuke and Kira. <br><br> It sounds really confusing. <br>It is. It's 10 volumes in and we are still uncovering more mysteries than getting any closure.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Part 8 will more than likely be the last part of Jojo <br> considering the rate at which it's being written <br>How on earth are you arriving at this conclusion? Nothing at all has pointed to this being the last part, in fact it's the opposite. Part 8 seems to be a side part before the next big one.</br></br></br>  <br>That one, if it weren't for DIO's sexiness.</br>  4&gt; 7 &gt; 1&gt; 5 &gt; 6 &gt; 2 &gt; 3  <br>And Part 9 will begin a couple months later.</br>  <br>Then why the hell does he have the same name as Josuke Higashikata like the one in part 4.</br>  <br>Get yourself a cheeseburger and drop JoJo for good.</br>  <br>That picture is bad and you should feel bad for posting it.</br>  <br>He is half alien. His mother is human.</br>  <br>Part 1 is also my favourite part as a standalone, but that's not to say the other parts are "shit". Stands are great and the wacky powers are really entertaining.<br>Please don't give us a bad rep.</br></br>  <br>That's his name. He's only a couple of weeks old and a fusion of two people. One of them was called Yoshikage Kira and the other was Josefumi Kujo. Don't think too hard about the little allusions Araki throws in because there's not a single character you could call a 1:1 "counterpart".</br>  <br>He lost his memory and a qt girl gave him the name Josuke after her old dog that died.</br>  <br>Joseph &gt; Josuke &gt; Jotaro &gt; Jonathan &gt; Giorno<br><br>Kira &gt; DIO &gt; Dio Brando &gt;&gt;&gt; Kars<br><br>4 &gt; 3 &gt; 2 &gt; 1</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They could do an original story from between fights in Egypt, or a non-canon sequel to DIO's World with more depth into The World's timestop ability. DIO could really start throwing kitchen sinks this time.</br>  <br> The protagonist in part 8 is the alternate Universe version of Josuke, Jotaro or Kira? <br>The answer is to stop thinking about it like that.</br></br>  <br>What</br>  <br>Average taste</br>  <br> More posts saying Giorno is worse than Jonathan <br>He is the EXACT SAME fucking character but better. You people are retarded.</br></br>  <br>Most people don't put part 1 that high.</br>  <br>He is reading part 5 right now. He included Giorno, but he didn't judge whole part and antagonist.</br>  <br>Why? And why are you in these threads if you haven't read the whole thing?</br>  <br>Because JoJo threads are filled with absolute morons now.</br>  <br> He is the EXACT SAME fucking character but better. You people are retarded. <br>I agree and I'm not even a Jonathanfag.<br>Jonathan is more passionate and noble though, he's more of a sensitive gentlemanly Kenshiro, it seems more like Giorno takes more of his traits from DIO.</br></br></br>  <br>2 is literally the only good one. Stands a shit.</br>  <br>Giorno is way more one dimensional.<br><br>I liked the personality change between kid Jonathan and adult Jonathan.</br></br></br>  <br>I read everything JoJo related. I'm not that guy, but when I was at part 6, I was regularly in JoJo threads. In fact, I spoiled myself some of part 7 moments, but I don't know what wrong is to visit thread about series that are you actually reading.</br>  <br> Giorno takes more of his traits from DIO <br>I can only agree in regards to his ruthless and merciless nature. The rest of Giorno is pure unadulterated Jonathan in the way he values his comrades and speaks in a polite manner.<br><br>Araki really nailed the mafia boss personality in Giorno, it's too bad we'll have to wait forever for a proper English version of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Read a proper translation of Part 5 before pretending Giorno is one-dimensional.</br>  <br> I can only agree in regards to his ruthless and merciless nature. <br>It's also the calm methodical way he presents himself. He desires to become a Mafia boss, and talked about taking control of the town, that's a latent desire for power. The only thing Jonathan and Giorno have in common is the polite way he speaks, but even Dio spent a good chunk of the time acting polite to get what he wanted.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. The real point I'm trying to make is that he's a fantastic character that hardly gets enough attention.</br>  <br>He gets plenty of attention outside of /a/, ever heard of Pixiv?<br>Giorno is easily one of the most popular Jojos outside of /a/ and they wank him hard.</br></br>  <br> 5  <br>Oh, I'm sure you've been corrected but holy shit<br><br>(8)4&gt;7&gt;6&gt;2&gt;5=1&gt;3</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's mostly the cheeseburgers that demand more le tricky Joseph and football jockey Josuke. Giorno and Part 5 in general need a sense of globalism to enjoy, almost like fine wine.</br>  <br>Not really. It's hard to compare characters like that, it's too subjective. <br><br>Giorno is a lot like Jonathan in that he's very idealistic and has that JoJo passion and height, but he has a lot of DIO's ruthlessness and charisma. Not necessarily better, just different.</br></br></br>  Anyone have a pic of Josuke in black gakuran? You know it's inevitable.  Wait, Yotsuyu isn't a woman? Fucking bullshit Araki.  <br>It has no sex<br><br> Which makes her sexier </br></br></br>  <br> It's mostly the cheeseburgers that demand more le tricky Joseph and football jockey Josuke. Giorno and Part 5 in general need a sense of globalism to enjoy, almost like fine wine. <br>Globally, people would rather partake in cheap yet enjoyable generic wine that fills their craving and doesn't leave a dent in their wallet. That's what Giorno is, a very simplistically strung up character that exists only around a central theme without standing alone as a character very well. He can just pass off his character well because he's attractive and slick, exactly what satisfies the Fujo's hunger. Several years ago Jotaro was also one of the most popular JoJos. Giorno is just a cheap supermarket brand wine.</br></br>  <br>Woah there anon. Part 5 is popular with fujos, but not because of Giorno.</br>  <br> Woah there anon. Part 5 is popular with fujos, but not because of Giorno. <br>He only fuels the fire.</br></br>  <br>Soft and Wet makes enough sense for you to understand what happened. He took away Karera's fire. The bit after is a bit iffy. Did he put the fire inside the other guy's face when he punched him? Or did he just put an empty bubble under his skin?</br>  i liked part 1 and part 2's jojo was pretty fun. I couldn't get into part 3 even though that's where all the famous stand ability originate from.  <br>Near flawless taste. Well done.</br>  <br> That <br> Flawless taste <br>Get your shit taste out of here, part 2 is one of the worst parts of JoJo outside of a few select scenes.</br></br></br>  <br>He rated it fifth, though.</br>  <br>It's objectively worse than part 5 and part 1.</br>  Loved how Gappy blocked that punch and then used the bubbles to burst the swelling  <br>You can't actually be serious when you say that.</br>  <br>He rated it fifth though</br>  <br> Part 6 not being last in every ranking <br><br>Oraora yourselves.</br></br></br>    <br>Part 6 is great once they drop the prison bullshit and just turn it into Pucci's Wild Ride.</br>  <br>Dead serious, part 2 is pretty terrible all around.<br> Terrible villians outside of Wamu <br> Asspulls that completely defy logic <br> The hand <br> The excuse for Kars getting his abilities and putting on the stone mask was "They were not looking at him, even though he wasn't dead and didn't even shine the UV lights on him" What the fuck was that bullshit. <br> Ceaser death was literally useless outside of Joeseph obtaining his headband. <br> Disjointed arc, the whole training session was pretty decent but only for one section during the climb. <br> That whole pulled out of your ass romance with the only building an exchange of under 10 words during the second half. <br>Terrible.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hating part 6 <br>How many times have you read it? It jars a bit on the first read especially as it is the end of standard continuity but if you've reread the series with any semblance of taste you will realise it does a lot of stuff right. For all its miss steps it has creative stand powers and great utility around how they're used. It was a perfect pallet cleanser for part five's 'return to the punch ghosts of part three'. It is this same tonal and narrative difference which is taken to its logical extension in parts seven and eight which are indestructibly good regardless of how, exactly, high you rank them. <br>Rethink your shit mate.</br></br></br>  <br>Only if you don't use Crazy Diamond</br>  <br>why not</br>  <br>Never said I hated it. I just like it the least out of all the parts. It's still a great read, anon.</br>  <br>Is there any straight sfm porn yet?</br>  <br>There's gay sfm porn Jojo porn?<br>I'm not gay, but I might be interested in seeing how badly it was animated.</br></br>  <br> 1 better than 2 <br><br> 1 better than anything <br>I have a hard time believing this is anything but hipster contrarianism. Phantom Blood was dull as fuck and a chore to get through.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know but I'm not gay so I'm not interested in gay porn.</br>  <br>I do think that 3 and 5 drag on like no tomorrow. However in their defence they also have some of the most exciting climaxes and fun villains. <br>Part five perfected the punch ghost formula but couldn't fix the pacing. Part three made up for it being the first of its kind by having a good cast, something five has on paper but not in execution. <br>While the best of five and three are worthy of higher ranks the fact is they're overall worse. <br>Part two on the other hand stays snappy. Its asspulls while unable to be accounted for are established early as part of the story so as not to infuriate. While it too has flaws it averages out better than the previously mentioned parts while also hitting some great high notes and climaxes, which is why I rank it higher.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree. Joseph may be an excellent JoJo, and even the first fucker I think of when JoJo springs to mind, but he completely hogs the spotlight to the detriment of the rest of the part. Battle Tendency is still very enjoyable, but it made me notice how Araki scaled down later JoJos in terms of how often they fight.<br><br><br><br>So long as none of it involved purest JoJo, I'd give it a look.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Phantom Blood was dull as fuck and a chore to get through. <br>I re-read Phantom Blood recently and it was fucking great, Jonathan had fantastic character development and buildup, all of the crazy shit that Dio Brando pulled was pretty enjoyable to read too. In general it's a really underrated part, Phantom blood has pretty great side characters too and has nearly no asspulls. In general it really came together, even the romance didn't seem forced and rushed. The way that Jonathan managed to forgive Dio in the end was also satisfying to finish.</br></br>  <br>Joseph doesn't hog the spotlight, he's just the only character who does anything.</br>  <br>I'm not gay but I'm very interested in gay porn<br> I'm a fujo </br></br>  <br>Joseph is really the only decent character in the entire part, even Lisa Lisa was pretty devode of personality. <br>Ceaser's personality was pretty great but the way that Araki killed him off was almost embarrassing to how badly it was written.</br></br>  <br>Coolbeans I don't really care but I'd like to jack it to Lisa Lisa</br>  <br>Why are you here?</br>  <br> Joichi Hirose stole 600 female outfits from schools <br>That doesn't really sound like something Koichi would do.</br></br>  <br> Coolbeans <br>Fuck you.</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RPx<wbr>XvrjpxCk</wbr>  [ ]<br>How hype were you?</br>  <br>But he has no dignity.</br>  <br>Daisuke got better at ORAing over time</br>  <br>Shit I still remember back when /a/ was trolling everyone with that fake opening leak <br><br>http://rebloggy.com/post/time-shatt<wbr>ering-punch-coda-jojo-s-bizzare-adv<wbr>enture-part-3-stardust-crusaders/70<wbr>754490901</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> the way that Araki killed him off was almost embarrassing to how badly it was written. <br><br>Made sense to me, Ceasar was a rookie that was too full of himself, allowing himself in the moment that he thought he had won to make a critical mistake that a seasoned warrior and expert fighter like Wham could use to turn the tables on him.</br></br></br>  Goes to show you. Don't start a thread with part ranking.  <br>So was Yamcha.</br>   Jonathan was an architect <br> Joseph was a property tycoon <br> Jotaro was a marine biologist <br> Giorno was a Mafia boss <br> Johnny was a Jockey/Farmer <br><br>What kind of careers do you think Josuke, and Jolyne would have gone into?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Josuke would be a hair stylist and Jolyne would be a prostitute.</br>  <br>Josuke would be a doctor or male nurse, Jolyne would become a bum.</br>  <br><br>I don't know if I'd consider Yamcha a rookie at that point but yes, he's another character that got too confident and paid the price.</br></br>  <br>Joseph probably didn't actually do anything</br>  <br> "I just saved the world! Give me money!" </br>  6&gt;2&gt;7&gt;5&gt;4&gt;3&gt;1  <br> 4 that low <br> Otherwise it's correct </br></br>  <br>Josuke has a million saved for university so he has no excuse not to become a doctor and use Crazy Diamond on his patients.</br>  <br> those subs <br>How do you get one of DIO's most famous quotes wrong?</br></br>  <br>jolyne would become a waitress and occasionally piss in peoples drinks for fun.</br>  <br>Is Jolyne the only JoJo without a bright future?</br>  <br>Only because she dies. Irene is what she would be if she lived normally and didn't go to jail.</br>  <br>She has a criminal record, plus woman are more likely not to be employed. She isn't interested in science in the same way Jotaro is either.</br>  <br> woman are more likely not to be employed <br>Don't bring that shit here</br></br>  <br>It's relevant to the discussion, I'm just trying to discuss Jolyne's possible future.</br>  7&gt;6&gt;5=4&gt;3&gt;2&gt;1 don't know where to put 8 yet<br><br>overall Araki got better at it every time he started a new part</br></br>  <br> woman are more likely not to be employed <br><br>I wouldn't say it's because she's a girl, but I wouldn't hire anybody with that kind of hairstyle.</br></br></br>  <br> if Part 4 gets animated we might get a Part 7 ad </br>  <br>Part 4 is getting skipped, we're going straight to part 5.</br>  <br>Actually I work at David and they're releasing the shitty Part 1 film but Roundabout plays in the end credits</br>  <br>The fujoshits will riot over Rohan.</br>  Where can I read good scans for part 4? Batoto stops at chapter 485.  <br>And Koichi. Maybe Okuyasu.</br>  <br>We'll riot over Okuyasu.</br>  <br> Jonathan was an architect <br><br>Don't you mean an archaeologist?<br>Jolyne did seem to have some future planned what with that guy she rode with when the whole thing kicked off.<br>Seeing as he didn't turn her in when she borrowed the car, it wouldn't have been that bad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The worst part is that I can see this happening.</br>  <br>24 chapters long part 4 is the worst scenario.</br>  <br>To be honest, I actually wish for something like that to happen.<br>Part $ is good and all but it's not really the creme de la creme and part 5 desperately needs a good anime adaptation otherwise it will forever be on the tail end of all western audience that didn't get a direct translation.<br>Which is a terrible shame.<br><br>Still, the ultimate best case scenario is having all of them turned into anime with all the good things that come with it (the OST, the voice differences lost in translation, etc.). I would simply be willing to drop it if it came to that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Part $ </br>  <br>I don't think he made a mistake</br>  <br>Guaranteed replies, every time.</br>  <br>glad that fat fuck died. That was Kira's greatest deed.</br>  Why did Jotaro's marriage fail, was he just a shitty husband and his wife left him due to having a passionless marriage?<br>I can't remember.</br>  <br>Jotaro discovered his wife was fucked by a monkey and he doesn't like used goods.</br>  <br>Jotaro didn't want to involve them with the stand shit that was going on since he wanted to protect them.<br>So I guess it's both.</br></br>  <br>I'm more curious how they even get together in the first place, it seems pretty odd given that Jotaro rejected women all the time in the past, he just never seemed to show any interest in being in a relationship.</br>  <br>This .<br><br>Essentially another Caesar Zeppeli and his father ordeal, simply with Jolyne in Caesar's shoes.</br></br></br>  <br>lol you won't be happy to what happens to johnny</br>  Is Anasui a pimp in the new universe?  <br>2&gt;1&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;3 &gt;&gt;<span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;4 <br><br>At which point I just gave up. This series is trash.</br></br></br>  <br>Josuke seems to be more proficient in fist fights than those we've seen before (with stands).<br>Maybe Jolyne, but I feel it's like with Jotaro that's more of a brawler type.</br></br>  <br>SUTANDO POWAH changes a man.</br>  Hamon or Stand?  <br>He couldn't repress the Joestar sex drive any longer.</br>  <br>Why not both?</br>  <br> Jotaro didn't want to involve them with the stand shit that was going on since he wanted to protect them. <br>That's no reason to get a fucking divorce, Joseph ended up doing the same thing twice but he's still with Susy Q.</br></br>  <br>More like your taste is trash.</br>  <br>AND he fucked a student AND adopted a Japanese child.</br>  <br>AND that's still no reason to get a divorce, pretty sure he didn't cheat on his wife.</br>  reminder<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=o4e<wbr>AKOY4wdY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Jotaro didn't, but if Suzy Q and Joseph didn't divorce because of all of the shit Joseph did then divorcing because your husband avoids you so you don't die is even less of a reason to divorce.</br>  <br>thanks. kill me you fucker.</br>  <br><br>Actually Dio spoke more politely than Jonathan (in Part 1 at least). That's one of the reasons that George treated Dio with a bit of favoritism and kept saying Jonathan should act more like Dio. It's hard to get across because in English pretty much all Victorian gentlemen sound the same, but Japanese has all those fiddly specific speech patterns and Dio's speech patterns were more polite. Giorno also speaks exactly like Dio too.</br></br>    He was too good for this world.  <br><br>I second this.</br></br>  <br> black guy has a fried chicken for a stand </br>  <br>He also blazes it.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=TUe<wbr>i7Uku0s0</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>another reminder</br></br></br>  <br>Jotaro is pretty much the worst husband/spouse out of all the Jojos, Jolyne and Giorno included.</br>  <br>Well there's only been two married JoJos and Joseph was one of them. If anything Jotaro is the best. He cares about his wife so much he ignores her.</br>  <br>If every Jojo were to get married, Jotaro's would be the only one to end in divorce.</br>  <br>Okay</br>  <br>I don't think it was ever stated specifically why they divorced. it was probably just because his ass was gone all the damn time?<br><br>Also I can't imagine Jotaro being very good as a husband, he just never seemed that interested in a relationship and starting a family. And I know everyone goes on about how 'pure" Josuke is but Jotaro is, IMO, probably the most sexless Jojo there was. Even Josuke got a little blushy over implications about dating and stuff, and Jonathan had his whole Erina romance, but Jotaro basically spent all of Stardust Crusaders telling women to fuck off. I can't imagine why he even got married in the first place.</br></br></br>  <br> Jonathan, Joseph, Jotaro, Johnny <br><br>u wot? That's four, not two.</br></br></br>  Will they win against Centipede team?      <br> Will they win against Centipede team? <br><br>As long as it's not a homosexuality contest. You can't out-gay centipede.</br></br></br>  I give them even odds  <br>Within  parameters, of course</br>  <br>Of course</br>  <br>Very likely to end up as a tie, actually. Usual result when pitting spinoff characters in their own series vs main series characters</br>  <br>Well the event of a tie the match must be decided by a lewd gay-off.

All hail boobbie.</br>  Is this supposed to be CGI animated? The whole coloring looks as if it was flat shaded, yet the motions look hand animated for the most part. It looks somewhat jarring.  I expected to like it but it's bad.  Oh man, that was fun as fuck. I can't really expect more from a video game adaptation.<br> The budget for Fate Stay Shit should have went into this. It looks like it would have had potential but ran into budget issues already. </br>  <br>Where is her face?</br>  I really don't like slutty attire.  <br>gay</br>  How the fuck are they suppose to kill that<br><br>Also<br><br> dude kill monsters <br> girl is amazed and stares at him for 5 seconds with open mouth  <br> girl kills monsters <br> dude is amazed and stares at her for 5 seconds with open mouth  <br><br>That was annoying</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not wanting to make her your personal slut </br>  <br> woah...so this is...the power of Alisa </br>  <br>When wearing slutty attire she shows her assets to everyone instead of the one she loves.<br>I can't like that, I'm a virgin otaku.</br></br>  <br> How the fuck are they suppose to kill that <br>You know how they said that Lindow and his team extracted the core of the Vajra in the anime?<br>In the game, it was one of those things</br></br></br>  Why the fuck are there so many white haired russians in anime?  I'm so fucking glad to see Alisa animated. I don't care what anyone says.  <br>I thought in the game Lindow was killing a Ouroboros alone/</br>   11 animation directors, 72 key animators (55 2nd KA @ 8 companies?!) 3 episodes in, God Eater wants to kill ufotable.   <br>So that's where all the budget went.</br>  <br> To date, he is the only one in the Far East Branch to have defeated an Ouroboros on his own.  <br>Guess he did.</br></br>  Ufotable really should have taken a season off and aired this during Fall if possible.  <br>For what purpose</br>  <br> meanwhile F/SN team </br>  <br>Well, you can see they're struggling </br>  <br>Some people from F/SN team are actually involved on this so not all of them get a break.</br>  <br> high budget, really hyped series ends up looking generic and forgettable with terrible directing <br> lower budget video game adaptation has the worst QUALITY of the season <br> movie series only looked better than average <br>Is Ufotable the worst studio?</br></br></br></br>  <br>So that the production wouldn't be a total clusterfuck? Do you think  is a good thing?</br>  <br>I agree he's generic, but there's something I really like about this character. I think it's because I'm so used to main character's being so loud and emotional about wanting to fight monsters for a better cause like "To save the world" or "To help my friends", but this nigga...he just kind of does it without saying much at all. Even if he's the epitome of boring, I'll let it slide since he's not annoying.</br>  <br> nothing has impact. The fighting is fucking underwhelming and boring. <br>Did you watch episode 3?</br></br>  Hey so how about that God Eater 2 localization?  <br> high budget, really hyped series ends up looking generic and forgettable with terrible directing <br>here's your reply</br></br>   Alisa and MC-kun constantly trying to one-up each other during the plane fight <br>That got a couple chuckles out of me<br><br> Ouroboros already <br>I really hope it's less disappointing than the game's was</br></br></br></br>  Or maybe Ufotable is filled with Tarou and Hiraoka  <br>But it was.</br>  <br>Yeah I'd take a silent protag over an obnoxious one any day.</br>  This looks amazingly horrible, the part where she jumps out of the plane was animated with magic markers and crayon  <br>thats one shitty C-17</br>  So, can you devour at long distances in the new game or it's an anime only thing?  <br>Anime only<br>In the game, devouring has some distance to it, but nowhere near the amount the anime showed</br></br>  <br>HOLY SHIT. Just how is humanity still a thing with big ass motherfuckers like this around?</br>  And it's already taking a break next week, after 3 episodes. No wonder when the credits looked like this for this episode. Must be nice that ufotable died because of a shitty video game anime.  just how sad makes you the current state of the one piece anime  I'm long over it. I've accepted it won't have any impact at all anymore and currently ignoring it.  <br>not like the manga it's better right now</br>  <br>So, I opened thread to answer and 2 anons already said the 2 things I wanted to say. Life really is unfair...</br>  <br>Just how sad makes me the current state of 4chan English the most.</br>  <br>I stopped caring about the anime years ago.<br>I stopped caring about the manga months ago.</br></br>  <br>You're welcome. Let's just hope that by some miracle Toei will go bancrupt.</br>  <br>How could Oda improve the pacing based on how he handled things in part 1?</br>  <br>Monthly chapters i suppose, personally id really really prefer that</br>  MAL still believes that OP is a solid anime and second best of the season.  In this thread we wish Sasha a happy birthday. Once again she's lived to see another one. Good job and keep up the good work. <br><br>As far as discussion goes what do you think Annie was planning to do after she failed to capture Eren? He was clearly going to the capital to be executed. Was she going to try her luck again and escape with him? In that case Erwin probably avoided a lot of unnecessary deaths of civilians. <br><br>Another thing, when BRY left they were saying that really soon it's going to be hell inside of the walls. What does that mean? All I can think of is that the wall titans are going to wake up and let all of the outside titans in, killing everyone. The reason they wanted Historia was because she (has the potential to) knows the secret of the walls. Is there a way to stop them from waking up? Keeping them in the dark seems to be working.</br></br></br></br>  Annie is love<br>Annie is life<br>Annie is the light of my life<br>Annie a miracle of the universe<br>Annie might've done some things wrong, but she's still a beautiful person inside and out</br></br></br></br>    <br>Do you think she would have broken Eren out of prison via titan form? Or is the reason she went along with Armin's plan was because she didn't really have one.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128619069 <br>I like her.</br>  <br>What do you mean by breaking Eren out of prison? She never quite bought Armin's story, but went with it anyway due to having run out of options.  She might have wanted to believe she wasn't actually being rused somewhere deep inside, too ;_; </br>  <br> really soon it's going to be hell inside of the walls <br>I'm pretty sure it has to do with MT. Perhaps an attack from (BRA?)MT's faction?</br></br>  <br>The titans inside the walls.</br>  <br>Eren was going to the capital for trial, where they were more than likely going to decide to kill him. Since she needs him alive I would have thought she had the intention of getting him out of there. As part of the MP it would have been relatively easy for her compared to BR. <br>I'm thinking she thought Armin's plan was her best bet, hoping that he wasn't deceiving her. <br><br>It would be nice if one of these shifters could just sit down and discuss their problems with others instead of just running away. Would talking really doom them somehow?</br></br></br></br>  <br>A stink.</br>  <br>Well, if that's what you want to stick to.</br>  <br>I wonder why he would attack the walls. If he was going to do that why didn't he do it in the first place instead of sending some kids to go undercover?</br>  <br>Makes more sense than MT or BRA attacking the walls again.</br>  It's amazing she's still alive. Watching this makes me sad that almost all of the veterans are gone. All of the new people are going to suck and die right away. <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=N1q<wbr>eifXC5C4</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>What's with Eren and Mikasa's faces?</br>  <br>Minafag still alive I see</br>  So, Eren is of azn bloodline from his mum or dad? <br>Assuming his dad was outside wall for a while... are there more azns inside?</br>  <br>What? What gave you that idea. There could be more Asians inside but most of them were wiped out. They explained this.</br>  I want to protect Sasha's smile at all costs. <br>I don't care if anyone else dies, so long as she's safe.</br>  <br>She might even be there until the end. I'm thinking that the main cast are safe from death now. I don't feel any anxiety about that anymore.</br>  <br>Yeah. I think the chapter she was originally meant to die in was the last time I felt really tense about any of the main casts fate. Though I am getting a bit concerned about Annie now that the Survery Corp's have that syringe and the whole thing about eating spines came out. <br>I guess she's not really part of the main cast though, and BRA's death is pretty much inevitable because of what they've done.</br></br>  <br>oh, right Eren no special blood at all. So we only know of the Ackermann and royal bloodlines. We don't know any azns?</br>  <br>Reiner also said something about how they don't have long to live which makes me think that being a shifter puts a lot of stress on the body and leads to an early death. <br><br>I think Annie is safe for now though. I don't think they've found a way to safely extract her from the crystal. I actually have no idea how she's going to get out of that thing. Can she do it with her own free will? Is she aware of what's going on outside around her?</br></br></br>  <br>The Asian bloodline was confirmed to be one of the bloodlines immune to memory wiping, which is why they were targeted. As far as we know Mikasa is the only one left.</br>  <br>I wondered if maybe Reiner's comment was more about the culture they come from. Shifter's letting themselves be eaten and passing on their power to a new generation.<br><br>As for how Annie gets out, I think it'll involve Eren's hardening power. Based on how the walls were put together, as well as Armin's original suggestion that Eren can fix the walls with his titan, it seems like titans can fuse their skin together. <br>Also there was that scene in the anime where Eren and Annie started to merge. I know that was off canon from what happens in the manga, but the anime guys know how the manga ends so it might be worth considering that as a hint towards how things will play out. <br>Anyway, I think Eren will merge his skin with Annie's crystal and by doing so turn the crystal into a malleable liquid skin state, and then the other members of the Survey Corp will be able to just grab her and drag her out of it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> which makes me think that being a shifter puts a lot of stress on the body and leads to an early death. <br>I was assuming the same. Having and using the coordinate is probably even worse.</br></br>  <br> Shifter's letting themselves be eaten and passing on their power to a new generation. <br>I didn't think about that. That's also a possibility. Although if you were going back home to die I would think that you wouldn't want to desperately go back there like BR have been this whole time. Maybe they just want everything to be over. Living with what they did can't be easy.</br></br>  <br>The way Eren has been bleeding lately doesn't bode well. It could be because he's new at it though. I haven't seen BRAY struggle like he has.</br>  <br>I think Eren's health is related to the coordinate more than anything. If his titan shifting was killing him it feels like that would have been something Reiner would have mentioned when giving his "the power's not as convenient as you think" speech.</br>  <br> "the power's not as convenient as you think" speech. <br>Huh, I can't remember him saying that. Was that when they were in the trees?</br></br>  <br>There was also Uri who aged strangely fast. They probably all age faster every time they shift, regenerate or use a special ability.</br>  <br>Yep. Eren goes to bite himself, and Reiner tells him not to. Ymir then goes on a spiel about why it'd be stupid to transform at that moment, and then Reiner says that nope, he meant Eren literally couldn't transform yet.</br>  <br>Oh, I thought that he was commenting on his energy levels. He was lacking limbs and exhausted, which is why he couldn't transform. I don't think it had to do with being the coordinate. <br><br>I didn't notice him aging faster than other people, but you could be right. I'll have to read that part again. I feel like having Ackerman genes makes you age slower since Kenny looked really young for his age.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't think it had to do with being the coordinate.  <br>Yeah, that's what I'm saying. If having titan powers was slowly killing him, I think Reiner would have mentioned it to both Eren and Ymir when they were talking about titan powers and their limits. That's why I think Eren's poor health is coordinate related and not titan related. <br><br><br>If that's true it makes me wonder how old MT really is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I think Reiner would have mentioned it to both Eren and Ymir <br>No, since he didn't want to give them any kind of info.</br></br>  <br>But he did give them info. Both he and Bert were happy to talk to them about certain things, just not the specifics of their mission or their hometown.</br>  I want to abuse the Bert.  <br> happy to talk to them about certain things <br>What? That never happened.</br></br>  <br> If that's true it makes me wonder how old MT really is. <br>Probably as old as he looks, I think he should be around the age of BRA's parents or a little older than that. Staying too long in the titan seems to consume the shifter and make him mindless.</br></br>  <br> I think Reiner would have mentioned it to both Eren and Ymir when they were talking about titan powers and their limits <br>Oh I see now. I don't know, Reiner wasn't really explaining anything to Eren so it wouldn't surprise me if he kept quiet about shifter limits as well. Maybe they're not allowed to say anything that could possibly be used against them later. Limits goes for BR as well and they could be attacked when most vulnerable if that information got out.</br></br>  <br>They not-so-skillfully avoided any discussion that could give away info about them, Bert even avoided personal questions like how he felt. The best we got from them was that someone had to do it so it might as well be them, but we don't know why.</br>  <br> just not the specifics of their mission or their hometown. <br>Reiner also didn't want to tell them why he can't or won't shift.</br></br>  <br>We also know that there is an enemy, according to Ymir. We can't tell if she was talking about MT or not though. She mentioned later that "their power" is absolute and that there is nowhere she can hide. MT seems powerful enough to do that, the way he can just climb over walls and turn people into titans.</br>  <br>BR look terrified of MT and he wants the coordinate, so it's safe to assume he's their leader. I think before Reiner interrupted her, Ymir was going to say that the real enemy is the leader of the warrior village. BR aren't the enemy for sure, they're being manipulated by him and I wouldn't be surprised if they turned against him.</br>  <br> BR look terrified of MT <br>Ymir thought they looked happy.</br></br>  <br>She thought wrong.</br>  <br>I'm guessing MT attacked him because he came back empty-handed.</br>  <br>This page was long after they returned and it looks like it was a scheduled fight to decide if they'll save Annie first or not. I don't think Reiner attacked him first, it might be how the warriors settle their issues.</br>  <br>Or it could have gone down like<br> Annie's being tortured right now, we have to go and save her <br> No <br>And they fight over it with MT not even being mad, he just wants the coordinate. Makes me wonder why a strong person like him even needs it for.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's the same thing, of course BR were the ones to suggest saving Annie and MT disagreed. He wouldn't fight Bert since the fight wouldn't be fair. I'd like to see CT fight another titan.</br>  Makes me wonder if he would still like her the way she is now.  <br>I guess it is more or less the same thing. But even if MT did lose I don't see him agreeing with doing what BR wants so easily. <br> I'd like to see CT fight another titan <br>I'm not sure that's possible. He's really slow and seems to rely on his steam as a way of fighting (or falling down other titans). He has good defense but watching him fight would probably be boring as no progress would be made or it would be over too fast.</br></br></br>  <br>Didn't Isayama imply CT could beat AT if he wanted? It was in a Q&amp;A. If he can beat AT he can beat the rest too, except MT maybe.</br>  <br>I don't remember that but I don't doubt it. CT would be hard to fight, but I'm sure he would have difficulties as well. Can he even walk? I've only ever seen him support himself against the wall.</br>  <br>Isayama drew him walking, not being capable of walking is a theory.</br>  <br> Isayama drew him walking <br>When was that?</br></br>  <br>Didn't it mention something about Reiner being stronger but he would let Bert win or something like that?</br>  <br>The opposite. He said AT would win the fight because Bert would let him.</br>  <br>Brutus cover and some of his sketches.</br>  <br>You can clearly see the just had an "orgasm" by seeying MT, this maybe has changed now, but in pic pic it's like they're looking at god.</br>  <br>Bert would let Reiner win.<br><br> Who is stronger between AT and CT? <br> AT would win because their human relationship. </br></br></br></br>  <br>So Bertholdt would be like<br> No bro, you're too strong for me, I give up. </br></br>  <br>Reiner did say they're short lived though.</br>  <br> but the anime guys know how the manga ends <br>[citation needed].</br></br>  <br>Armin was probably the only other person that noticed that he liked Annie.</br>  <br> If having titan powers was slowly killing him, I think Reiner would have mentioned it to both Eren and Ymir <br>Why would him? That wasn't the topic of the conversation.</br></br>  <br> You're both murderers with little time left <br> You're <br>Why didn't he include himself too?</br></br></br>  <br>Because he was refering to Annie and Bertholdt?</br>  <br>He said <br> other than one of us <br>after that though.</br></br></br>  <br> Eh? <br> other than one of us <br>As in, all three of them.</br></br></br>    I'm currently on chapter 51.

I am also looking forward to Crow beating Yuri.</br>  <br>"It all went downhill after the demon penis." - Kazuki Takahashi</br>  <br>BUY BLACKWINGS AND RED DEMON'S DRAGONS</br>  <br> actually think Gon will win </br>  <br> Implying Gon does relevant things in card games <br><br><br>Turkeys are cool.</br></br></br></br>  <br>History literally repeating itself, everything after 64 is shit.</br>   there were people who seriously expected Gon to defeat Crow "BUY BLACKWINGS" Hogan <br><br>You really only have yourselves to blame.</br></br>  <br> Took Sawatari's Yosenjus away and gave him TRASH cards <br> Also gave Gongenzaka TRASH Pendulums <br>WILL SOMEONE STOP THIS MADMAN?</br></br></br>  Holy shit this is hilarious<br><br>Anyone who thought Gongenzaka even had a spic of a chance at winning is retarded<br><br>Anyone who legitimately hates Arc-V Crow is retarded<br><br>Anyone not satisfied with that based as fuck duel, probably one of the bet duel of Synchro arc, is literally and inherently retarded<br><br>Cry more as your precious samurai is sent off to dig his own grave, literally</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>5d's actually more interesting since Crow appear.</br>  Maybe it's just because I'm tired, but I actually don't care that Gon lost, even though I thought I would. He's dueled for a good bit up to this point, and we all know others are going to eventually fetch him from wherever he's sent (or he escapes on his own).  <br> probably one of the best duels of Synchro arc <br>That's because all the duels in the Synchro Arc have been shit. The only good duel since Yuya vs. Reiji was against Chojiro.</br></br>  <br>I agree, especially direct sequels. Yes, I'm talking about GX, Fuck GX!</br>  <br>I hope Crow replaces Gon as a lancer that would be good.</br>  <br> Crow is more important to the current plot <br>How so? I haven't started the Syncro World arc yet.</br></br>  <br>He's basically a shit commander. Once the Lancers fall apart, he's probably going to bargain Serena/Yuzu to R/Leo to keep Standard safe.</br>  <br>lel Gongenzaka gets new card shilled every duel. You guys are the reason we still don't have Yuto, Serena, or Funky Comedian cards</br>  <br>He's a genius, not a shit commander. He's intentionally fucking over certain characters to get a specific reaction out of other people. He's even manipulating his own brother just to get to Yuya.</br>  <br> M-muh Steadfast dueling <br> D-dont need Action card </br></br>  <br>Then watch and find out for yourself</br>  <br>If Konami wanted to print them, they would, no matter what a bunch of gaijin manchildren say.<br><br>They don't, so they're not.</br></br></br>   All these crowfags in this thread. <br>I can believe such shit taste, /Arc-V/ used to be better.</br>  <br>Blame the delusional faggots who liked gay Transformers knockoffs and toy dragons.<br><br>Boipussy lust stronk. Especially if its shota pussy</br></br></br>  <br>No man only based Blackwings deserve to be printed. I can't wait for Crow to become Yuyas new best friend.</br>  <br>He got to show off more SHS and that's all that really mattered. He was the most important character that Crow could beat, anyone more important would bullshit a win somehow even if they're "weaker." The only characters left Crow has to beat are whoever wins between Shinji/Tsukikage, Tokumatsu, fodder, Sawatari if he isn't fed to strongu, and possibly Serena but that one's not going to happen anyway.</br>  <br>Does Reiji know that Dennis is from Fusion?</br>  <br>watch it dumbass</br>   people unironically liking Crow in any capacity   <br>We will be getting Yuto's cards printed soon with the reveal of the XYZ booster set. Serena will get her cards printed in the next Fusion oriented booster set alongside the Ancient Gear support. Sawatari's Underworld Trope would probably be printed in a set like the Secret Forces.</br>  <br> People still mad over Crow </br>  <br> Steadfast duel <br> already riding on a D-Wheel <br>fucker should have just picked up the action card</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>This is bullshit. Every card Gongenzaka has used thus far bar this duel has been released. It's turning into BUY SUPERHEAVIES at this point.<br><br>Where the fuck are Serena's cards? Where are Sawatari's? Where the fuck are Reiras?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> everything after 64 is shit <br>Kek, if that happens people won't have Yoshida to blame this time.</br></br>  <br>Why would Reiji want to extend Yuya's list of strikes against himself?</br>  <br>I'm not even mad that Gon lost, I even knew it was going to happen, I'm just mad that people are being absolutely fucking obnoxious about it right now.</br>  <br>ITS PART OF KEIKAKU</br>  <br>It's like pottery.</br>  <br><br>Fine. Be stingy about it.</br></br>  <br>Why don't you ask Konami?</br>  <br>I don't mind Crow, but that is wrong as shit.</br>  <br><br>Fusion special pack like HSR and Wings raider</br></br>  <br>Because Reiji gets a sadomasochistic surge out of toeing the line of danger by walking on the edge, whether it's making barters he can't fulfill or putting himself in the way of self-harm.<br><br>Hence, D/D/D.</br></br></br>  <br>Moonlights are just Tenki + Allure targets. What do they do that is more exciting than Fluffals?<br><br>Sawatari's new deck is just Dart Shooters all over again.<br><br><br> Faggots buttblasted over their Sora 0.5 job slut </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jack is successful and he isn't. <br><br>That's pretty much his relevancy.</br></br></br>  <br>Stay mad, Gonfag. This happens every time duels like this take place.</br>  <br> Implying they wouldn't give some non-answer <br>You know damn well we cant' ask any soulless corporation about anything and get a straight answer.</br></br>  <br>I don't feel nearly as frustrated as I was with 5D's, though</br>  <br>Crow's Yusei?</br>  <br>At least it's not a shitty filler arc like pre-WRGP</br>  <br>I once emailed them and asked them when they were going to make NK actually good, and they just told me to keep buying their stuff.</br>  <br>Might as well be Synchro's Yusei instead of Yugo.</br>   Crow Riding Duel <br>Previous thread explode to 600+ posts.<br>Best part of that episode is Crow stunt with Blackbird grabbing Action Card</br></br>  <br>It would have been the same had Gongenzaka won, except more people would be talking shit about Crow and spamming DONT BUY BLACKWINGs</br>  It's okay guys, Crow is simply better than Gon<br> Just like how Reiji was better than Yuya </br>  <br>I'm not mad about Gon losing neither, but more about Crow winning. You could replace Gon with Sawatari, Dennis, Ninja, or even with ENJOY, and I would be still mad. Crow has no impact to the plot, nor any emotional involvement with any of the Lancers, so I don't know why he is still in the tournament.</br>  <br>What you think is irrelevant. They will get released sooner or later anyway. ;)</br>  <br>Would've been better if he started flying instead with those wings</br>  <br><br>So this is the curse of Synchro summoning, isn't it?</br></br>  What even   Under the command of Akaba Leo, he is trying to kidnap Yuzu and Serena away to the Fusion Dimension <br> and Serena </br>  <br> tfw Reiji, Sawatari, and Shun become the new cool kids and spend their time running through academia halls disrupting class shouting Serena and Ruri </br>  <br>I once asked if they could name the card artist for Laundsallyn, and they replied that they wish they knew, but have no idea. And that they hope I can find out somehow on my own.<br><br>Who else besides Konami am I supposed to ask?</br></br></br>  <br>I doubt he's strong enough to carry 2 girls at the same time.<br>Also, Fusion arc pls hurry.</br></br>  <br>I'm more expecting Yuzu to go around screaming Serena.mp3 to every faceless mook she sees after Serena gets kidnapped in place of Yuzu.</br>  Reminder that Synchro was a mistake  <br>This is pretty much a shitty pre-Academia filler arc, though.</br>  I fucking hate Crow. I hate his design. I hate his monsters's design except one or two. Even so i knew that he was most likely to win because him winning would create infighting between the Lancers and make the plot more interesting.<br>If Gon won what would happen. Crow entrusts Yuya with showing them Tops like every shounen hero?</br>  <br>Dennis will take Serena with him while Yuri takes Yuzu.</br>  <br>Its boring bur the Crow hatedom would rather have something that simple than more turkeybirds filling packs.</br>  I'm more interested in seeing matches between characters that really, really don't want to fight each other. Mainly Yuya, Serena, or Yugo vs Yuzu.  <br>I don't think Serena cares too much honestly.</br>  <br> losers of tourney are put into forced labor <br> Reiji probably knows this if Chojiro does <br> Gon can take it since he's a mountain of a man <br> risks sending Reira there despite that him being like 10 years old, and untested <br><br>What is wrong with Reiji?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Half of Serena's reason for joining the Lancers is for Yuzu.</br>  <br>Implying this isnt all part of his keikaku</br>  <br>Try only reason, she's going to kidnap Yuzu.</br>  <br>Yeah but if Yuzu goes to the mines, Serena will just leave the cup and go rescue her, leading to Yuri/Dennis capturing them both.</br>   Losers get sent to forced labour <br>OH SHIT WE CRASHTOWN ARC AGAIN<br> MANZOKU </br></br>  Wonder how Yuya and Chojiro got out of their suiteprison cell.<br><br>Feels like the reason why Yuya bumped into Reiji and Reira in the first place was because it was his chance to look for Yuzu.</br></br>  <br>Chojiro has mad connections because he's fucking Chojiro, so he pretty much gets to roam free every so often.<br><br>Reiji, and as a result Reira, can do whatever the fuck he pleases because he's Kaikakuman.</br></br></br>  <br> Wonder how Yuya and Chojiro got out of their suiteprison cell. </br>  <br>BLACKBIRD BEST DUEL RUNNER</br>  <br>Yes, please.<br><br>It's one of my favorites 5D's mini-arcs.</br></br></br>   1 Tuner + or more non-Tuner monsters <br> If this card was Synchro Summoned using a "Blackwing" monster as a Synchro Material, it is treated as a Tuner monster. Once per turn: You can send 1 "Blackwing" monster from your hand to the Graveyard; inflict 300 damage to your opponent. </br>  <br> Blackwings get delta accel synchro </br>  Synchro arc was a mistake<br>Crow was a mistake</br>  <br>Reiji never steps away from looking the big picture. To the point that he views everyone else as pieces on a gameboard, and never gets that close with anyone.<br><br>In contrast, Yuya strays from the bigger picture when he gets fixated on what's close to himYuzu, but he also has a few genuine friends.</br></br></br>  <br> Yuzu <br>I meant to put that in parentheses</br></br>  Why didn't Gon use Flutist?  <br>Kiryu should have been better than Crow in Arc-V, imho.  Also Infernities &gt; Blackwings. </br>  <br>Doesnt have the same effect</br>  <br>How exactly? He would have drove that hatred for the Jack harder than Crow has and wouldn't have anything to add to the plot besides working on the mines.</br>  <br> People actually like Kiryu <br>That's a good enough reason. Especially since the 5D Characters were brought back for fanservice and BUY BLACKWINGS.</br></br>  You guys told me ARC-V was good.  <br>Oh right. Flutist is shit in the anime. I forgot. Shame because it could have saved Gon at least twice.</br>  <br>It was, until Ep. 65, just like 5Ds, and guess who is the fault of both of them.<br><br>Crow.</br></br></br>  <br>IT KEEPS HAPPENING</br>  I'm a 5Ds fag who hasn't really seen Arc V. Watched it so I could see the satsification of Crow losing. He fucking wins against an Arc V character who I know has lots of cards released so he must be fairly prominent. Damn you guys. You said it would be different. He just went full BUY BLACKWINGS.  <br>Stop this stupid meme. People like Crow too, you guy just force your unnecessary hatred for him down everyone's throat like cancer. You dislike 5D's Crow so you take it out on Arc-V Crow? Retarded.<br><br>And the 5D's characters brought back were popular characters, character that people liked and were well versed in Synchro Summoning for the Synchro Dimension. Not to mention Kiryu only has one Synchro monster.that he only used once. In a filler arc.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not convinced until they spend 3-4+ episodes on cup ramen or something relating to cup ramen and a tiny clown</br>  <br> a-am i fitting in guys..? </br>  This has to be the most polarizing duel yet.  <br>That's Sora vs Shun the first round.</br>  <br>It's honestly hilarious<br><br>Crow haters can stay mad as long as they want, doesn't change the fact that the angrier they get, the clearer it gets that they are all getting their asses devastated by Blackwings</br></br></br>  <br> People like Crow too <br>Outside of Tumblr fangirls not really. Most were meh on him or disliked him. Blackwings were popular, not Crow. After his first few duels he stopped using good Blackwings which led to more hate because now it was just pack filler. Back in 5Ds days you couldn't even discuss Crow without starting a flame war. He's back for BUY BLACKWINGS not popularity.</br></br>  <br>Most people just laugh at Sora for being a egomaniacal scrub.<br><br>Even when he beat Shun I just could not care.<br><br><br>Generic Blackwings are why my ship faggotry died and/or Morphtronics aren't tier 1.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Its fucking obvious some people are going to get carded and crow and jacku are going to join the lancers because fucking academia is gonna rekt shit before the tournament ends.<br><br><br>My carded list:<br><br> Gongenzaka <br> The ENJOYYY guy <br> Dennis <br> Reiji </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I fucking love THE MAN GONGENZAKA and I dunno what you guys were even bitching about.<br><br>That was a great duel and this version of Crow is a really good character. 5D's happened like five years ago, get over it.</br></br>  <br>Good thing Blackwings aren't part of the meta, they get run over too easily.</br>  <br>I dunno, I can't really bring myself to be worked up over it. I get why Crow winning is annoying, but people are acting like it's the dealbreaker to end all dealbreakers, and it's not like Gon lost 4000-0</br>  <br> Judai's soul patch. </br>  <br>Fujos are people too.<br><br>Terrible people but they are part of the YGO fandom.<br><br>Besides people tolerate Shun despite his Marty Stu shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I dunno what you guys were even bitching about. <br>Crow</br></br>  <br>I know right. People are acting like Crow beat Gongenzaka 4000-0. Crow was down to a 100 LP people.<br>Though I wouldn't call Crow great.</br></br>  Since Gongenzaka lost and they throw him out the competition/building/tops does this mean he is gonna  be carded   <br>If Crow and Jack join the Lancers I'm fucking done with this. It just stops being Arc-V at that point and becomes 5Ds 2 and them trying to fix the mistakes of the past. <br><br>That's stupid, they need to stay in Synchro and that's it. <br><br>Besides if anybody is getting carded in Synchro it's Ninja, ENJOY, Crow's friends, Shinji, and Crow.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gon isn't getting carded pre Academia. I doubt any of the Lancers even Tsukikage are.</br>  <br> this version of Crow is a good character <br><br> 5Ds Crow <br>FOOD AND KIDS<br> Arc-V Crow <br>FOOD AND KIDS<br><br>He's the same character, he's just got less time to talk so it's not as hard to see him as as big of a fag as he was in 5Ds.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Besides if anybody is getting carded in Synchro it's Ninja, ENJOY, Crow's friends, Shinji, and Crow <br>Why</br></br>  <br>Shun fades into the background after he does his thing. Like his whole 3OTK against elite Security was followed by him having not said a word since the point Reiji made his re-entrance.</br>  <br> he's just got less time to talk <br>that fixes like 90 fucking percent of the problems with 5D's Crow, so.</br></br>  <br>Ninja because he's a plot device of character's being able to escape easily, it's why there aren't two of them around, because two guys flashing in and out is broken, and him being in Academia would be a bit too broken towards the Lancers. <br><br>ENJOY, because, well old dudes never survive sadly. <br><br>Crow's friends because they're useless, Shinji and Crow because they'll protect the kids.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Besides if anybody is getting carded in Synchro it's Ninja, ENJOY, Crow's friends, Shinji, and Crow. <br>So basically you want the plan to make Synchro allies to assault Academia null because you're butthurt about Crow?<br><br>Jeez man</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then what was the point of going to Synchro in the first place if everyone will be carded?</br>  <br>Crow got a Signer dragon and was overall background noise.<br><br>Shun will probably wreck Crow just because Xyz swag and you gotta make the eternally asshurt Rua and Aki fans happy. It'll make synchrofags mad though.</br></br></br>  <br>They can recruit Shinji. Imagine the rage if Crow became a permament cast member.</br>  <br>Why do a handful matter when Reiji's gunning for the Council to put the entire City and its forces on Standard's side?</br>  <br> Imagine the rage if Crow became a permament cast member. <br>Who cares?</br></br>  <br> Crow defeats Dennis <br><br>Oh lawd people would scream and want turkeys dead.</br></br></br>  <br>Because the entire City and its force aren't all going to Academia. The plan isn't to rally up forces to stay and protect the dimension, it's to make allies to assault Academia. The entire reason why they made a pit stop at Synchro is to get strong duelists to come with them to fight off Leo.</br>  So Gongenzaka and Dennis got Pendulums.<br>Will Shun, Serena, Reira and Ninjabro get pendulums?<br>Will Yuzu ever get Melodious pendulums?</br></br>  <br><br> Crow friends getting carded <br><br>This needs to happen.</br></br></br></br>  <br> you gotta make the eternally asshurt Rua and Aki fans happy <br>DAMN STRAIGHT <br><br> I enjoyed this duel and am enjoying this Crow though </br></br></br></br>  Take a minute to admire the best scene in Arc V so far.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1Pv<wbr>4LjRbET8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> They can recruit Shinji <br><br>What good will one person do? Especially one person who has his mind set on an inner city rebellion rather than an interdimensional rebellion.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't forgot Crow himself.</br>  <br>Imo, Reiji winning on Yuya's turn is better than Shun winning because Sora blanked out on his own monster's effect</br>     Jack and Crow stay behind to protect Synchro <br> Shinji joins the Lancers <br> ENJOY gets carded to protect Yuya and Sawatari's entertainment and new wave of dueling <br> Dennis teams up with Yuri and kidnaps Yuzu/Serena <br> Yugo gets nom'd by Yuri after he flips his shit over Rin and him trying to kidnap Yuzu as well <br> Yuya flips his shit after realizing Yuzu has been kidnapped <br> Him and Gon disband from the Lancers to go to Academia <br> Sawatari follows along despite Gon's protests <br> Reiji, Reira, Ninjabro, and Shinji go to Academia themselves to get back Serena as a bargaining chip against Leo <br> Reira inevitable betrays Reiji and spills the beans to Leo about everything <br> Shun does his own thing and gives up on the Lancers <br> Serena/Yuzu vs. Ruri/Rin Fusion Duel <br> Shun gets carded in Academia <br> Gon gets carded in Academia <br> Ninjabro gets carded in Academia <br> Shinji gets carded in Academia <br> Yuya/Sawatari vs. Sora/Dennis <br> Sora gets carded by Dennis after Sora starts having fun and his ideals waiver <br> Sawatari gets carded in Academia <br> Dennis gets carded in Academia <br> Leo's plan works with the Ruris <br> Yuya/Reiji vs. Leo/Yuri <br> Some shit goes down and Yusho with his Lancers show up (Sherry, Ushio, etc.) <br><br>I'm from the future, you can trust me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Crow had nothing to do with Aki, but he did take away from Rua. <br><br>Worst thing of 5Ds is Sherry's 'development'.</br></br></br>  <br>There was literally nothing wrong with episode 65. What is your deal?</br>  <br>The problems with 5D's extend beyond just Crow, though. The way he was involved was more like a symptom than the cause.</br>  <br>65 was basically a disguised recap episode, but I also don't really care since it was only a matter of time that one showed up</br>  <br>Can't believe you took the time to type this autism.</br>  <br> åã¨å½± <br>Kiryu confirmed to coming back and pairing up with Yuya.</br></br>  <br>Motherfucker. What the fuck just you do?</br>  <br><br>Is this still worth getting into ? I dropped the whole shit when they introduce pendulum thingie and made card text longer than a chinese train wreck. Never get past GX anime,MC too much of an obnoxious little cunt there so I lost interest in watching whatever came after it.</br></br>  <br>Yes, but you probably don't deserve to watch it</br>  <br>Rua was next in line to become a Signer (although there's evidence he would always get the heart, not the tail) Aki was the third protagonist behind Jack. Crow snaked this away from both of them.<br><br> Worst thing of 5Ds is Sherry's 'development'. <br>No arguments here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>According to /a/, Crow winning a duel the biggest dealbreaker known to man, so there's no point in watching</br>  <br> There was literally nothing <br><br>Yeah, that sums it up.</br></br></br>  <br> implying Yuya would tag with Reiji <br><br>And if they did Yuya would probably be his LP shield.</br></br></br>  <br> Episode 65 <br> no Jack Atlas remix <br>First of all, that was episode 64. Second of all, I can't believe you're actually using that as some kind of negative when the episode as a whole was incredibly good</br></br></br>  <br>They are still mad Aki never join wgp</br>  <br>I can't believe you post on /a/ with that attitude, faggot. <br><br>Exactly.</br></br></br>  <br>Yuya would tag with Reiji if they were the only ones left in the cast. Like Yuma/Nasch vs. Don Thousand</br>  What would Crow have to do to get people to like him?   I was only nine years old <br> I loved Crow Hogan so much, I owned all the Blackwings and merchandise <br> I pray to Crow every night, thanking him for the food I have been given <br> "Crow is love," I say, "Crow is life" <br> My dad hears me and calls me a filthy commons <br> He is obviously jealous of my devotion to Crow <br> I called him a traitor, a sellout to the Tops <br> He beats me 2-0 because of Red Demon's Dragon <br> I am crying now, because I'm hungry <br> I post about it on /a/, and they tell me CROW SUCKS <br> I feel a warmth moving towards me <br> I fell something touch me <br> It's Crow <br> I am so happy <br> He whispers into my ear, "Buy Blackwings" <br> He grabs me with his unwashed hands and puts me on my hands and knees <br> I'm ready <br> I activate my duel disk for Crow <br> He summons a gajillion Blackwings <br> I have no skill, but I do it for Crow <br> I can feel my hand emptying as my field starts to fill up <br> I push against his force <br> I want to please Crow <br> He yells a mighty yell as he tunes his synchro monsters to summon another Synchro monster <br> My Dad walks in <br> Crow looks him deep in the eyes and says, "For the children!" <br> Crow jumps out the window after stealing all of our cards and all of our food <br> Crow is love, Crow is life </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only beat people nobody likes or win against filler only.</br>  <br>He probably would if there was a pressing reason.<br><br>But Yuma and Shark were best friends and had experience tag teaming together, while it's hard to imagine Yuya even having a friendly conversation with Reiji.</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly this.</br>  Think of it this way guys<br><br>Fusion invasion of Synchro will be all the sweeter.</br></br>  <br>Crow sacrifices his life saving Gongenzaka when Gongenzaka was about to sacrifice his own life to save Yuya</br>   I knew Crow would win <br> It's still painful when it actually happens </br>   people freaking out because we had a meh episode <br>Holy shit it's has more than 52 episodes don't expect every single one of them to be some sort of AOTY it's like this is your first anime about card games.</br>  <br>It doesn't matter how the actual duel was, everyone's problem is with who won</br>  <br>Stop using blackwings. <br>Stop talking.<br>No kids.<br>Stop dueling. <br><br>Basically be Honda.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was a pretty good episode actually, but people tend to lose their shit when things involving Crow happen.</br>  <br>Actually this was, by all accounts, a very good episode. People just don't like Crow.<br><br>Though when I think about it, I don't think Gon had lost before this</br></br></br>  <br>Gon lost to Yaiba ages ago, lost to Yuya before the Championship, and lost during the Championship so Yuzu could win.</br>  <br>He managed to tie with Yaiba, and that was when he only had Ben-K</br>  <br>Aki and Rua are shit characters and most women in shonen are destined to be painfully useless or the second coming of Erza Scarlet which isn't goof either.<br><br>But yeah Blackwing shilling does bother people for somewhat justified reasons.</br></br></br>  DORO!  <br>If you're not first, you're last. Drawing might as well be the same as losing, because it's not winning.</br>  <br>Blackwings might as well be the new HEROES at this point, it's ridiculous. I fully expect the next YGO series to have them or to just pop Crow back in with brand new cards.</br>  <br>Good*<br><br><br><br>People have unhealthy attachments to shit characters because "muh shipping/a fappable slut!" or "muh underdog!"<br><br>Crow is here to stay for the time being. He'll fade into the background sooner or later.<br><br><br>I'll say this: the Blackwing main deck isn't as painful as HEROes at least.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> x are the new HEROs <br>Every time</br></br>  <br> Blackwings might as well be the new HEROES at this point <br>Uh no. They are still making new HEROes. Blackwings were a thing for a short while and then stopped for like 4 years</br></br>  So what actually happened to Gon after he lost? Did they just eject him from the building, or is he actually on a bus to Crashtown? Or have they not shown what happened yet?  Should I add some Xyz?  Did Crow use some new Blackwings here?  <br>I kept a very small shimmer of hope that Gon could win. Shame but nothing beats BUY BLACKWINGS.<br><br>It can't come soon enough. Torch everything to the ground, Academia.</br></br></br>  <br>Of course, Gear Gigant basically searches everything you need except for Benkei. Also,<br> ever using kabuto </br></br>   Superheavy Maju Kyu-B <br> This card can only attack the monster your opponent controls with the highest ATK (your choice, if tied). This card can attack while in face-up Defense Position. If it does, apply its DEF for damage calculation. This card gains 900 DEF for each Special Summoned monster your opponent controls. </br>  Did Crow kill everybody's hype? Thread's really quiet right now.  <br>Could be cool and could set up some stupid OTK stuff with soulbuster gauntlet.</br>  Konami hates synchro so much they even made a whole arc of shittyness about them just to prove how much they hate it. It's fucking working, So far all the new synchros shown have been complete mediocre garbage not even Clear Wing is that good.  <br>Stream is over. All the raging was done in the previous thread and this one. Nothing to hype about. We already know Tsukikage vs Shinji next episode</br>  GON<br><br>JUST ATTACK<br><br>DONT LISTEN TO HIS SHITTY SOB STORY<br><br>JUST<br><br>FUCKING<br><br>ATTACK<br><br>BEFORE HE GETS AN ACTION CARD<br><br>GON</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone calmed down I think, hopefully.</br>  <br> Using 3 spell cards in a Steadfast duel <br>Blasphemy</br></br>  <br>I think shuffle reborn would actually be a good idea in a Superheavy deck.</br>  <br>At least Selena is still perfect.</br>  <br>That's not Shuffle Reborn, I actually don't know what it is </br>  <br>I was screaming for Gon to attack as well because I knwew what would happen after the story ended.</br>    Anything else i can add/exchange?  <br>+Hungry Burger</br>  <br><br>Never known a pile of shit is deserving of anything.</br></br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br>I run 3 crobats and insight and 2 chickens.</br>  <br>Ah man, it's like 5ds never ended. We had BUY BLACKWINGS maymays in Arc-V threads before, but not like this. Truly a spectacular maymay comeback.<br><br><br>Anyway, speaking about the latest episode itself, was anyone else surprised to see that Dennis, locked alone in his room, still said "Gon-chan" and looked worried when Gon lost? I'd have expected that academia psychopath to put on a Marik slasher smile or something instead.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He knows he's being watched. Not to mention Reiji probably has installed spycams in all the lancer duel disks.</br>  <br>"In retrospect, Zorc's character design was the peak of my artistic ability. It was always going to be downhill from such an upright masterpiece"</br>  <br>Brecause of Jack, duh. I'm waiting for them to drop the bombshell that will be truth of the bakctory between those two.<br><br> Because they are going to do that, right? They wre not just using old character designs on new characters to pander to nostalgiafags without keeping their personalities or relationships in some form, right?  </br></br></br>  <br>I totally thought it was going to be Black-Winged Dragon's answer to Scarright, instead we got a slightly edgier looking assault blackfeather. Meh.</br>  <br>Insight gets useless when you use Pendulum Call.<br><br>Hmm, i could bring it down to 2 chickens, what to add in place then?</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Crow jumps out the window after stealing all of our cards and all of our food <br>kek</br></br>  <br> Jack is back because nostalgiafags <br> Crow is back because you all need to Buy Blackwings </br></br>  <br>Who's going to win, I'm with Ninjabro.</br>  <br>Dennis is not that good a spy. He almost revealed he was a mole when surrounded by all the lancers, I doubt he'd be paranoid about cameras. Plus he seemed the most worried other than Yuzu, I doubt that anyone would be suspicious of him for not really caring about Gon all that much.</br>  <br>With chicken i meant Apex Avian</br>  <br>I'm going to be sad when she is inevitably kidnapped and then nom'd. <br><br>Arc-V is horrible. Yuto dies, Ruris are gonna die, Yugo is gonne aide, Crow stuff, ENJOY will get carded.<br><br>This series has more suffering than all of the others.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ruris are gonna die <br><br>I will not accept that.</br></br></br>  What if everyone were kindergartners?      <br>Too bad.</br>      <br>Serena would probably be stabbing people with No. 2 penciles...awww I just got nostalgia for kindergarten. ;_;</br>  I'm amazed by how people can be such obnoxious over the result of duel. Fine, Crow won, Gon lost, what's the freaking big deal about it? They both shilled a shit ton of their respective archetypes. And even if the other one would have won, both will sure as hell not be making it to the grand final (or semi even) to be too relevant in the tournament.<br><br>Despite that I love Gongenzaka and on the fence about Crow, I'm perfectly fine with what we've got from the episode, which gave us a great duel nevertheless. The writer assigned these characters to be part of different plot lines, just accept it and move on.</br></br>    <br>At least post-fused Judai would keep order.</br>  <br>End, now if only understood what anyone was saying.</br>  <br>The problem is it feels like despite their relevancy to a plot point that has nothing to do with anything (Jack the Traitor), that it's shoving Gon out of the way for a character we had ages ago that is no different than what he used to be. It's the same character, just like Jack.<br><br>And as much as I like Jack and I'm indifferent to Crow, they really are distracting from the plot pretty heavily now, Jack a little less so though.<br><br>Crow should have dueled one of his friends, it'd been better character development for him, while Gon got to fight say Shinji/Kage, so they can both get development and it doesn't matter one way or the other, but showcase both of their decks off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Let my princess do as she pleases.</br>  <br>a good splashable card. To think KoA would give us an exclusive like this wow.</br>  Gon didn't even want to win. He saw the tournament was important for Crow as a common, and that he cares about the kids, he just wanted Crow to duel him all out. You guys are retarded if you think Gon cares about winning or losing he just wants a honorable duel.  arc-v crow kinda look like pedophile to me  <br>This is what people are missing. Gon could have attacked while Crow was doing his sob story but he chose not to do and let Crow get an Action Card. He practically let Crow win.</br>  <br>Gon needs to stop it, it's going to get him killed in Academia.<br><br>Gon and Yuya need to grow the fuck up.Dueling isn't about fun.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe but in yugioh winning = better human being, therefore Crow is a better human than Gon.</br>  <br>You should add some  Blackwings .</br>  <br>Because it was some awful shilling. How could Pendulum Synchro lose to plain old Synchro? I thought Konami respected shilling as an art form, this was just pathetic and I'm starting to lose all confidence in Konami's shills.</br>  <br><br>Gon winning accomplishes nothing in the story aside from jacking him off. Their objective is to look for strong duelists in synchro dimension. Crow beat Gon that qualifies him as strong enough to become an ally. It also shows his honor being his potential demise.</br></br>  <br>it was not old syncro, it was limit over accel syncro</br>  <br>If you haven't gathered that Standard outside of Reiji is the weakest dimension regardless of Pendulum Summoning then you haven't been paying attention. Hell I'm pretty sure it's been made of note at some point that Synchro is the strongest dimension.</br>  <br>Blackwings&gt;Pendulum Synchro<br>BUY BLACKWINGS KIDS</br></br>  Why was Dennis so expressive about Gongenzaka loss when he is the double agent?  <br>DON'T BELIEVE HIS LIES</br>  <br>Gotta keep that cover.</br>  <br> Crow only wins due to a standard weapon: action cards <br> Standard is weak <br>Then again I'm not sure how action cards how are a weapon when it won't take long for the opponents to realise they can use them too.</br></br></br>  <br>He was alone in his room</br>  <br>Remove bennis</br>  <br>True summoning&gt;Reiji's bootlegs<br><br>He had fun with Gon chan</br></br></br>  I love this meme how Arc-V is suddenly shit because unbeatable THE MAN was defeated by someone who wasn't MC  <br>Maybe cameras, maybe he didnt expect synchro to be this strong</br>  So Gongenzaka lost, so what?<br><br>Let's talk about Yuzu, she hasn't dueled in like ages it seems.</br></br>  <br>Despite being a double agent, he probably likes most of the lancers.</br>  <br>Two young, fit duelists arrive in a place that is completely unknown to them, separated from their friends and not knowing anyone else, they have to rely on each other for their very survival, and eventually, for comfort....<br><br>Just kidding, it's a plot hole or foreshadowing that Dennis is starting to mellow out and iwll have second thoughts about proceeding with whatever academia's plan for him is.</br></br></br>  <br>All the other dimensions are hardened battle warriors, explaining and giving them action cards helps them way more than a dimension of fucking clowns and softies. Pendulum summon isn't their best weapon either as all tons of the other dimension players run cards that attack,burn or take your monsters as well.</br>  <br>so no direct attacking?<br> or does the "This card can only attack the monster your opponent controls with the highest ATK (your choice, if tied)." not apply in this case.</br></br>  <br>Maybe in his together with Gon he's grown a little attached to him like Sora to Yuya?</br>  Selena is a cute, a cute!  <br>She finally made Shun egao.</br>  <br>I want to protect this smile</br>  <br>I love Yuya and Selena's more "realistic" hairstyles in that.<br>Sadly, there's no cure for shun hairdo.</br></br>  I like how Crow used some sob story to distract Gon long enough to get an Action Card. Truly a trickster. If Gon was an edgelord he would have won. So what they are saying is don't bother showing respect for your opponents and win while you can.  <br>if this is true will we get a 3 on 3<br><br>sora bennis yuri vs yuya gong shingo</br></br></br>   SHS pendulum <br>yeah manly<br> 1 and 8 <br> 8 <br>why the fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sadly, there's no cure for shun hairdo. <br> Cure <br>Nigger you better not be calling Shuns hairstyle shit.  Because it's beautiful just like Ruri~ Selena~ and Yuzu~. </br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget they're levels 1 and 8. With scales matching their levels. Even when SHS get something neat, you're still shit upon.</br>  <br>Yeah but you know they're gonna be brought back in the last episode somehow.<br><br>Unlike Zexal though, I think I'll feel it a lot more when people start permanently dropping</br></br></br>  well this is fucking accurate.  <br>I wonder what Dennis's mother looked like since I bet that's where he got his beauty mark from.</br>  <br>Talk about what? Sawatari is probably going to lose to her too, but he'll put on an actual entertaining duel that'll make even Jack smile and Yuya will get all upset, and then proceed to not give two shits about Sawatari, because fuck everything except my own entertainment and Yuzu.</br>  <br>Oh my god Serena is pure fucking sex...jesus</br>  <br>The carded people are getting brought back. The Yuyas and Yuzus... well, that depends on what the myth behind them is.</br>  <br>Yuzu was the God Magician of the Universe and Yuya was the God Dragon of the Universe and they fought each other. Yuzu split the dragon up, and exhausted her power, so she split herself up to watch each piece, and made bracelets to ensure they'd never come in contact with each other.</br>  <br> Pendulum is Standard's greatest strength <br> Gives shit scales and levels to Gon and Shingo </br></br>  <br>What is this, the manga?</br>  <br> If Gon was an edgelord he would have won. <br> Looks at Shun's record <br>Yeah you're right. Gon's kindness is his flaw. Should have BTFO Crow when he was talking about his kids.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought we had already established that the only people carded who'll come back are the ones who didn't get their carded selves caught by academia. They are using that giant reactor thingy to melt carded people into duelist goo to make their fusion god. Think about it, each of the dormitory colors in GX stood for one of the egyptian god cards, we know that blue still stands for obelisk in arc-v, it stands to reason that the purple uniform also stands for a god card and not only for the fact that they are the fusion dimension, since all the colors use fusion. Of course, their fusion god doesn't exist yet, but a card that meets their needs not existing has never been a problem for long for an Akaba.</br>  <br>Doesn't explain why they're so in love with each other that separating them drives both sides mad.</br>  <br>I'm guessing it's a doujin, the manga started very recently, they wouldn't have got to Selena yet, if she even appears.</br>  <br>It basically is. They only need Gon following closely behind Yuya.</br>  <br>Oh, I didn't mean the ones who were eaten by the reactor. I meant the Standard folks like Hokuto and Michio at least have a chance of returning.</br>  <br>That's just a result of them growing up together. Yuto wasn't nearly as much of a muh Ruri guy as Shun, and I doubt Yuri gives a shit about Selena. Yugo and Yuya happened to grow up alongside their Ruris, and they felt once again whatever primordial love the two gods once enjoyed.</br>  <br>Him well google isn't giving me shit, this is depressing.</br>  <br>I agree. Maybe even before the final battle, so they can lend a hand in the last few episodes and shill a few more cards.</br>  <br>So why'd they fight despite the love?<br>Also don't bully Yuri. He'll feel the Yuzu effect once he meets Selena and finds teasing her much more fun than carding people.</br></br>  <br>I really want to believe Sora honestly considers Yuya a friend and will ultimately turn on Academia. But it's probably more likely Dennis will do it.</br>  Should I make debut in this new duel format with a machina / super heavy deck  <br>They probably both will and Yuri will instantly card them for it.</br>  <br>Sure Anon, why not? Are you gonna debut by yourself?</br>  <br> Dennis <br>Why? He still hasn't shown he likes the lancers, he could go evil and start carding people next episode and I wouldn't bat an eye.<br>Sora at least was more of a friend to Yuya than Dennis is to basically anyone.</br></br></br>  <br>The one thing I look forward to is Yuri and Serena developing their relationship to their counterpart tiers.</br>  <br>Dennis isn't a complete psychopath though, he seems to get along with Gon, and he didn't have to give up his cards in jail, nobody else was watching him from what we can tell.</br>  <br>It's like Romeo &amp; Juliet, two opposing forces that love each and can never be with each other, always at odds.</br>   Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime. <br> Anytime you see an image with the syntax ########_p# and/or _master1200 it's from Pixiv (account required) and can be reverse ID'd by entering that leading ######## sequence after the equal sign in the following URL http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id= so you have http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51624502</wbr></wbr> </br>  <br> yfw arc v is a convoluted love story whereby two gods deeply in love were separated by some stupid person who wanted to NTR the god dragon of destruction. </br>  <br> He still hasn't shown he likes the lancers, <br>He seems to enjoy teasing Shun when they were breaking out and he seems to see a Gon as a rival.</br></br>  <br>Mean to reply to </br>  <br>That's dark, anon. If we go by that then Yuzu will pretend to die and Yuya will really think she's dead, destroy the world, then kill himself. Yuzu will wake up, discover what happened, and kill herself too.</br>  <br>I love you, appreciate it.</br>  Altogether, not a terrible duel.  <br>Or you could just saucenao and save yourself the trouble.</br>  <br>No Anon, she'll reset the Universe/Dimensions so they're all one again, only this time she and the Ruris don't exist. Yuya will have one fleeting moment during his EGAO state of clarity and make a wish to bring her back and the cost of his lust for power and destruction, and the last episode will be them meeting for the first time again under different circumstances so they can finally be together.</br>  <br> Give Dennis the Academia spy a bunch of good pendulums even though his deck is meta-level already </br>  <br>I actually have a really autistically elaborate theory about what the hell is up with the dimension, the Yuyas, the Ruris, Leo and Yusho and academia's purple uniform. I might post an image with it this week, if I can be arsed to go through every chapter so far and a few from previous series to screencap the scenes I think back it up. But I agree someone tried to NTR the god of destruction and that whatever split the universe wasn't his fault, and that Leo's plan is wholly his own.</br>  <br>I mant Leo's plan ISN'T wholly his own.</br>  <br>I watched again and Gon threw the game by encouraging Crow to win and not attacking him sooner.<br>Honestly Crow didn't deserve to win. Gon on the other hand becomes more based every time even in defeat.</br></br>  <br>You're right, it's also  Yusho's .</br>   All this Academia stuff isn't going to be resolved until the end <br> We'll never get an Arc with all of Yuya's as the main characters <br><br>It hurts.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm actually starting to think it may end up being Dennis that convinces the Lancers are more fun then Academia.</br>  <br>Is my deck good enough</br>  <br><br>What if this is an alternate timeline caused by Yliaster's time travel shenanigans plus/or Astral's having screwed around with the Numeron Code which branches off from the point in GX here Yubel was attempting to unite the dimensions?</br></br>  <br>Where's Gear Gigant?</br>  <br> Why? He still hasn't shown he likes the lancers <br>He hasn't shown that he dislikes them either. He's clearly warming up to Gon. Similar to Shun.<br><br>I think Gon is going to be the guy who mediates the other dimension Lancers into becoming a team</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd either add a couple Pendulums or just remove them completely, it's not often you'll draw them at that rate. <br><br>Also add some more Synchros or Xyz, whichever floats your boat. Particularly stuff like Leo, Keeper of the Sacred Tree, Hot Red Dragon Archfiend, Clear Wing, Goyo Guardian, Armades, Keeper of Illusion, No. 107, No. 101, Gear Gigant X.<br><br>Otherwise it seems fine to me. I'd suggest running 3 Big Benkeis and Samurai Scales though, I can make up a deck for you real quick if you want.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think it'll rely on other series for explanation, I just plan on screencapping some moments from previous series more for the themes or the card game logic rather than assuming they really share a continuity.</br>  <br><br>I wiill add thos synchros bro. No need to make one unless you want too.</br></br>   tfw haven't touched my D/D deck in a while <br> tfw all these new cards <br>I don't know how to use half of these. Baphomet is particularly offensive in that I can't think of a way it'd be useful.<br><br>I guess I could drop one Swamp King for the slime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Add in Eccentrick Archfiend.</br>  <br>\yeah the slime is good, it allows you to fuse from the and then use Swamp King to fuse from the grave in the same turn.</br>  <br>You're gonna want 3 Swirlal Slimes. The fusion effect is good, but the summon high level DD from hand (like Ragnarok) makes it essential</br>  <br>It seems a lot of people don't know how to run D/D/D, it's overly complicated with how it works and requires a lot of precision and skill, and some effort sometimes to get D'Arc and Temujin out. <br><br>Berfomet is only good for situational stuff, such as Rank 4s or Synchros, though I wouldn't personally put him in the deck, unless you're going to only put one of them in. You definitely want at least 2 Slimes though, I'd go for 3 personally.</br></br></br>  <br><br>stuff in extra I might add</br></br>  <br> Gon sacrifices winning so Crow can be with his kids <br> Why is he so kind? <br>Most of /a/ would have preferred it if he knocked him out then and there. Fuck Crow and his kids.</br></br></br>  <br>Run 2 Giant Rats and add in Gorz, the whatever the fuck he's called.</br>  <br>Jeez, will you shut up already? You're repeating the same thing over and over again. We get it, you don't like Crow. Nobody fucking cares.</br>  <br> All Crowhaters are one person </br>  <br>I'm telling the masses to shut the hell up. Literally all the Crow hate posts in these threads are just repeating the same thing<br><br> Fuck Crow and kids <br> Fuck Blackwings <br> Fuck Crow for winning <br> Crow needs to get carded <br> Fuck Crow for coming back <br><br>It's ridiculous. Everybody gets you guys don't like Crow and don't want him back, but the reality is, the upper heads give two shits about any of your feelings. No one cares. All this Crow hate is unnecessary spamming at this point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I don't know why anyone expected Gon-chan to win.<br>It's not like he had any importance being in the Friendship Cup other than being a Lancer.<br>He also uses Synchros in the Synchro Dimension, so even more irrelevance.</br></br>  <br>I knew Gon was going to lose, but it's a cold day in hell when you force me to like Crow, Anon</br>  <br> I don't know why anyone expected Gon-chan to win. <br>Expected and wanted are two different things. I expected it but it's still disappointing.<br> It's not like he had any importance being in the Friendship Cup other than being a Lancer. <br>Yeah but Crow's relevance is Jack is a traitor. He didn't even want to be in the Cup at first.<br> He also uses Synchros in the Synchro Dimension, so even more irrelevance. <br>Considering how Synchros were treated in Standard some thought this would increase relevance not decrease it. Gon should have used more than one Synchro and the one Synchro he use was medicore.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is cute but also kind of sad</br>  <br>Not that anon, but no one is forcing you to like Crow. Just stop posting what <br>listed over and over again. It's like a broken a record.<br><br>And I wish some people would stop being so obnoxious about Crow winning.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That was my first post in the thread, but damn if I'm going to be tone-policed by some faggot with a Tails reaction image.<br><br>Anyways, Yugo beats Crow, any duels Crow has until then he'll be fine.</br></br></br>  <br> Considering how Synchros were treated in Standard some thought this would increase relevance not decrease it. <br>u fucking wot m8? Gongenzaka loing decreases his relevance in the tournament, not the entire arc. He's been a part of the plot longer than I expected he would be and he' debuted what? Six or seven new Superheavies and he's only been in two duels?</br></br>  Why would Yuya or Serena even try to duel Yuzu? If they're put in the stadium together they will try to grab her and run away. You know what's more interesting? Yugo vs Yuzu since Yugo has a real reason to try to win the tournament.  <br>Yuzu/Yuya will just turn into them each trying to lose and then one of them remembering their promise to duel each other. <br><br>Serena/Yuzu will turn into a comedy thing and then to find out who has the better Yugo Shokans.</br></br></br>  <br> If they're put in the stadium together they will try to grab her and run away. <br><br>Cause that worked out so well in the Prison Break Arc</br></br></br>  <br> Yuzu/Yuya will just turn into them each trying to lose and then one of them remembering their promise to duel each other.  <br>Which would be fantastic.<br> Serena/Yuzu will turn into a comedy thing and then to find out who has the better Yugo Shokans. <br>I suspect Highlander Rule is in effect for the Ruris.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm a faggot for trying to keep these threads from turning into Crow Hate General? Anon please. 365 posts in this thread and 139 of them are about Crow, 3/4 of them being hate comments toward him. That's more than half of the posts in this one thread, and more than all the posts about Ruri, Rin, Yuzu, and Serena combined. That's ridiculous.</br>  <br> I'm a faggot for trying to keep these threads from turning into Crow Hate General? <br><br>Yes, you are. Go stick Kunai the Drizzle up your ass, Crowfaggot</br></br></br>  <br>Not that guy, but you're being just as much a faggot right now as anyone else. You don't like what someone's talking about? Bring up other points of discussion instead of being a shitlord. People don't talk about the other points of discussion you bring up? Too fucking bad.</br>   Gon jobbed <br>Hopefully Ninjabro wins</br>  <br>Pretty sure Tsukikage is going to win. Shinji matters doesnt matter kekshit.</br>  <br> I'm a faggot for trying to keep these threads from turning into Crow Hate General? <br>The episode aired today and in Crow's victory. I doubt it's going to be this bad all the time.</br></br>  <br>HEY YO FAM WHAT PLOT U WANT FOR DAT YU-GI-OH CARTOON<br><br>GIMME SOME OF THAT ROMEO AND JULIET SHIT</br></br></br>  Shinji will win to show off his deck, we already have an idea of what Ninjabro's deck is and the fact that his only importance is to port in and out in key moments.<br><br>Besides if he loses, he'll be with everyone else at the mines and just port them all out one at a time...or he'll do it regardless.</br></br>  <br> meanwhile Reiji and Reira are King Arthur and Lancelot and Reira will betray him despite the love Reiji has for Reira </br>  <br>Shinji is also reciting a rebellion against the Tops, which is a pretty big flag for Tsukikage to put that rebellious pleb down like a good Lancer</br>  <br>Okay anon, continue shitting up the only threads you have to talk about Arc-V.<br><br><br>This logic makes no sense. If I were to bring up a point of discussion and people don't talk about it and instead continue to reiterate the same hate comments towards Crow, the thread would devolve into more hate towards Crow, until there are more posts about disliking Crow than the Arc-v itself.<br><br>That's like if you were with a group of terrorists and you are the only one to say "Let's not bomb this city" and they all agree on bombing the city. All you get is a "too fucking bad". <br><br>If you want to talk about Crow, at least talk about something other than how bad he triggers you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If Shinji actually uses an Insect deck, he'll lose no matter what. ;)</br>  <br>Because he realises that Yuya's edge equals new D R A G O N S</br>  <br>All the more reasons for him to win and join, the Lancers are filled with rebels. <br><br>Poor insect decks.</br></br></br>   Hate Crow <br> Talk about Crow all the time <br>Every time</br></br>  <br> this bad <br><br>You think this is bad? There were days where you couldn't bring up Crow without having a flamewar. You should see the fucking NeoArkCradle thread where MasterGhost had to BTFO someone for baseless Crow hate.</br></br></br>  im fine with Crow winning, i hope he's just in this shitty Arc.  <br>You're just continuing to be an insufferable faggot now instead of trying to bring up some other point of discussion if you don't like people hating on your husbando so much. And that comparison to fucking terrorists is stupid and hilarious if you actually think people talking shit about Crow is that bad.</br>  <br> You should see the fucking NeoArkCradle thread where MasterGhost had to BTFO someone for baseless Crow hate. <br> MasterGhost <br>Literally who?</br></br></br>  <br>This, I'm indifferent to Crow and don't care one way, but I really hope the cameo characters stay in Synchro, the only way I'd absolutely tolerate it is if we get like Jack vs. Kaiser or some shit in Academia, and I'd rather see Shun vs. Kaiser honestly.</br>  <br> He's your husbando XD <br> Fuggin Crowfag XDDD <br><br>Not even that guy, but to be fair every second post being about Crow is pretty fucking annoying, even if another topic was bought up it wouldn't make everyone stop complaining about Crow magically. You're being just as much as a faggot for replying to him and feeding him on rather then talking about something else as well, pot calling the kettle black, faggot.<br><br>Also someone not wanting to sit through a thread full of "FUCK CROW" every second post doesn't necessarily like Crow. I fucking hate Crow but that doesn't mean that every second post being about how shit he is isn't annoying. I'm with you in that instead of being such a bitch about it he should come up with something else to talk about, but same goes for you, you're an insufferable faggot as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The guy who translate all the summaries</br>  <br>Hey anon<br><br>Hey, hey Anon<br><br> Crow is a faggot </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hm. It works well with sacred seven sword. But no searcher?</br>  <br>So I see I was just talking to a Crow hater this whole time. Figures because of your shit logic and your shit posts altogether. <br><br> husbando <br><br>Cut that shit out, falseflagger.</br></br></br></br></br>   Gonfags thought he could actually beat Crow   <br>I just noticed Yuzu holding the banana.</br>  Do any of you faggots actually hate Crow for anything else than circlejerking about<br> Muh 5D's <br> Shilling blackwings </br></br>  Read the guide before asking questions<br>buyfag.moe</br>   Canadians   <br>Every fucking thread. Will this be the new bath loli kind of crap?</br>  http://content.geekfaeries.fr/playe<wbr>r/WFS2015_Maritan.html<br><br>Max Factory displays some figures in Maritan Live</br></br></wbr>  why you do this ques q? how much long will I have to wait?   tfw Wonfes a shit <br><br>What is your disappointment, bros?</br></br>  <br>That I will have a wallet filled with money that will just get stolen by some nigger.</br>  <br>Waifu has no figure.</br>  <br>No disappointment, only a wish fulfilled<br>They kept her leotard-panties, I'm so damn happy</br></br>  <br>You might need this.</br>  Even Asanagi likes some girly swordboy figure: https://twitter.com/Victim_Girls/st<wbr>atus/624949842192654336</wbr>  <br>That she looks like shit.</br>  <br>My favorite part is that he likely sent it to hobby link japan.</br>  I think that's a pretty good Wonfes actually, compared to a lot of other editions. Alter actually delivered some really good protos, others manufacturers too.  <br>I got Tamamo, so I'm satisfied even if the rest was shit. Would have loved for some Kyoukaisen besides GKs though.</br>  <br>eye too big</br>  <br>Mainly how all this shit is coming out in some indeterminate timeframe. Could be years before what we want even gets released in those worst case scenarios.<br><br>Wonfes is a big fat tease.</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't expecting anything good anyway. The only disappointment is not going to sleep 5 hours earlier than I did.</br>  Talking shit about American events on the stream.  <br>If only, anon. If only.<br><br>I would really like to be greatly teased, but this summer accomplished nothing of that sort.</br></br></br>  <br>If they make a yoshimura/ OEO one I'd suck their dick.</br>  <br>Still no update on a 1 year old prototype.</br>  <br>Same.</br>  <br>Ilya looks disappointing.</br>  <br>Least of my worries</br>  <br>thighs not big enough</br>  <br>What were your expectations. She looks as good as the other Native mahou figures.</br>  <br> No Tougou <br><br>What the hell Alter.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not perfect but I still love it</br>  <br>I didn't like it at first but it grows on me quickly. Ears are still weird though.</br>  <br>It's the first wonfes where I'm not interested in anything shown.</br>  <br>This is painful to read. Isn't HLJ a seller?<br><br><br>The eyebrows too, too short and thick.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's mostly because NY, BiJ and Manda or my proxies have the tendencies to not listen to me and just slap a 2k yen scribble on the invoice. It's normal that bigger packages look suspicious if the value is something like 15 bucks, but it's still sad when friends in the same city get through with those and you don't.<br><br>For my first two years of buyfagging customs were chill and actually competent at their jobs. In my youthful ignorance I saw customs fees and VAT not just as a luxury tax but also as a payment for their (customs and post) good service and gladly paid it but then everything went to shit. <br>Minimum of 3 weeks waiting time, express mail that gets sent aimlessly from one office to the next for 2 weeks, manhandled packages and content, never updating tracking, complete blindness to actual invoices and customs letters that never arrive. Scummy tactics to make you pay more with a no fucks given attitude when you actually have problems. It pisses me off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wonfes not a shit. They announced Celty Figma and pic related are fucking nice. Im good. Im good.</br>    <br>No sulking allowed?!</br>  <br>Everything I want was already announced last year.</br>  <br>Uuuuuh.<br>I didn't see top middle.<br>What is it?</br></br></br>  A few things interested me.  <br>its been waht, 2 years?</br>  <br>Wonfes was not too bad on my wallet and I am happy with what I saw.</br>  <br>That Destroyer will never happen because MF is whoring out the sequels instead.</br>  <br>Not the biggest guy on figmas or vanilla Sakura but BB was all I needed</br>  <br>Anyone know when this will be up for preorder?</br>  <br>Once again I can blatantly advertise 2you4.<br>It's a great day.<br>2you4 always does exactly what you tell them on the form.<br> I also want to have sexual relations with their manager <br>But don't tell her.<br><br>I agree they used to do their job pretty well. It's why I can say I was -proud- to have paid all my taxes in full.<br>But now? It's pathetic.<br>No doubt Deutsche Post is a factor in it, but I feel like customs also regressed on their competence.<br>I'm with you 100%.<br><br>And what do we have?<br>No recourse at all.<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128623633#p128624514">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why doesn't he just wait for more figures of those skanks?</br>  I'd panpaka her pans if you know what I mean.  <br>A bit, but if anything they should be darker.</br>  This neck belongs to me, only me  She was 100% of the reasons I watched that show.  IIE SENPAI, THAT IS OUR NECK    this semen demon makes my dick so hard<br><br>is it worth watching just for her?</br></br>  <br>You have good taste, so no offense.</br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #5<br><br>Remember to relax and take it easy.<br><br>Previous thread </br></br></br></br>  <br>What's the point of answering your own questions?</br>  <br> see-through  <br>muh dick</br></br>  <br>I want to see my waifu wearing sexy swimwear like that.</br>  <br>That's really sweet, I like it. Thank you very much. Keep up the good work and stay cheerful!</br>  <br>Wow two deliveries back to back! Thanks for this as well, and funny too.</br>  Does anyone else read I am a Hero?  <br>Cool I didn't know that..</br>  <br>he got the ending he deserved.</br>  <br> I disagree with you.<br> I think he deserved better.
