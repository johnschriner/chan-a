I mean,he's getting showered by magic all the time with his fairy dust and constantly being in the Berserker armor so it's bound to rub off a little,right?<br><br>The same thing happened to his slab of iron,too big to call it a sword thing.</br></br>  Alnus ass whooping confirmed.<br><br>Episode later.</br></br>  <br>Is that what happened?

And if you can it's quite rare considering how many species there are.</br>  <br>What about antlers and horns?</br>  <br> draws a girl <br> call it a Femto </br></br>  <br>You can in almost every single mammal on Earth. You don't even need a trained eye. <br>It's actually rarer for animals to not have any visible differences between genders, like dogs and domesticated cats.<br>Big cats have very obvious differences. So do most apes, birds, fish, moles, rodents, insects, ect.</br></br></br>   Precure Thread   towa  Perfect cutie.  <br>Towawa is a mega cutie</br>  <br>Goddammit, Anthy.</br>  <br>Dont you just feel like slapping her?</br>    <br>That's probably the worst reason I have seen to drop it</br>  <br>For me it's all three.</br>  <br> Cuck: The Post </br>  <br>Puck is better<br> Do you think Guts gets Puck to jack him off? </br></br>  <br>She'd welcome every single bit of it</br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1pKgBm8Aa58mjB1hYhbK-VOPZsRBTXBuPBz<wbr>w8Xikm2ss/pub?embedded=true<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127760<wbr>892/</wbr></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  What?  <br>Export deck without schedule data. Delete deck in Anki. Import the deck you earlier exported. Everything should be "new" as though it were reset.</br>  <br>Thanks, Anki is so much easier and faster than making the cue cards yourself by hand. 250 kanji in 3 days is pretty good.</br>  <br>I don't know if you were messing with me or not, but that was pretty informative. Thanks.</br>  Anything similar to Real Kana on Android?  Finally got around to watching KLK over the past few days. It was absolutely, irrevocably  _fun .  <br><br>Redirect etc</br></br>  <br><br>That's a fine choice, my friends.</br></br>  I wonder if that new Trigger series will be any good.  <br>But of course<br><br>I strive for only the best in life</br></br></br>  Let us gather and pray to the Goddess!  ITT: Worst girl in their respective series  Without question.  <br>You just have a severe case of shit taste.</br>  <br>Worst op in respective universe.</br>  <br>While there is a very strong case for her, let me present someone worse.</br>  <br>She's down there. I don't know if I'd put her below cat, but they're both certainly the bottom two.</br>  Enjoy the weekend and take it easy.  Time for another  fun  WWD!<br>Humbly requesting Slaine Troyard.Anything funny or happy goes, but if you're lacking ideas:<br><br> eating ice cream <br> in apron and holding frying pan <br> revealing himself to be a stand user in jojo fashion <br><br>Take it easy in the summer heat!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting Kougyoku wearing Demon Slayers outfit from DFO, thanks!<br><br>Ref: http://imgur.com/a/XxRzU</br></br>  Requesting Ryuko doing something to make her blush! Confessing to the viewer, wearing something revealing (that isn't Senketsu), having just slipped and fell, or being caught/catching someone in the bath. Or whatever else you think of.<br><br>Or as usual anything at all is awesome!</br></br>  Requesting my king Revo.<br>Him in the cat ears and tail like on the right would be amazing. Anything cute or cool or just him failing in general would be appreciated though.<br><br>If anyone wants to art trade I'll be up for it.</br></br></br>  Kindly requesting Claudia Madobe accidentally popping the button off her shirt.
