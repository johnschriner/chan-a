[ Hey guys<br><br>I know we don't agree on things too often, but can we at least agree that Suou is the best DTB girl?</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  Only because red hair and pantyhose  Who? I don't remember any girl named Suou.  Who? <br>I don't recall seeing such a character in all 26 episode of the series.</br>  <br><br> This denial  <br>Slav Kana a cute and Yin died.</br></br></br>  After avoiding S2 for years because of the "it doesn't exist" meme, I finally decided to watch it last week and  it was actually pretty good .  <br>It was  alright <br>That ending really is as bad as everyone makes it out to be though.</br></br>  <br>the only reason people like to pretend it doesn't exist is because there will never be a conclusion</br>  <br><br>I don't remember her in the OVA<br><br><br><br>I feel like Yin 'died' wouldn't be the issue If such a scenario happened..</br></br></br></br></br></br>  fuck no<br><br>yin is the best</br></br>  <br>The ending is absolutely balls. Powerless Hei and his new fighting style is great though.</br>  <br>What pisses me off about Suou is that she never used that rifle on anyone, while we got to sit through every one of those magical girl transformation sequences. That power is retarded to start with, I mean how did Hei's electricity turn into that?</br>  <br><br>This thread again. No no I hate arguing who is the best girl character in any given show but I can't stand by and agree with this statement in the slightest.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Who?<br><br><br>I'm sorry, I don't remember any of that happening. Yin and Hei ran away together from the Syndicate.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>shit taste</br></br>  <br><br><br>The ending on the Hei side of things did piss me off a bit, it kind of necessitates a third season that I realize we'll probably never get. I thought the conclusion for Suou's story was good, though.<br><br>I don't know, I didn't expect the big problem to just be the ending. I've always heard people complaining about Hei being different in it, but it was immediately obvious there was a reason why he became the way he is at the start of the season, and I really liked how he slowly reverted to the way he used to be throughout. I also kept hearing complaints regarding the change in main character, so I expected Suou to be awful but I honestly thought she was pretty good.<br><br>I don't think it measures up to the first season but I thought it wasn't bad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, also someone has the Yuki_ona_ass.jpg?</br>  Reminder  <br> implying we watched S2  <br>Horrible fucking season. they only even started to introduce an interesting character at the end. MC was utter dogshit</br></br>  <br> they only even started to introduce an interesting character at the end <br>who?</br></br>  <br>Carmine is the superior redhead.</br>  <br>most accurate depiction of slavland in anime yet</br>    <br>This has to be the least successful way of starting a DTB thread, threads with this OP always die so quick</br>  Hot!  Is this show any good? Worth watching? I heard it was like the chinese batman or something, wasn't really sure what to make of that.<br><br>Like I mean if it's west/clooney/kilmer batman, I'm fuckin down bro, but if it's some like srsbsns tryhard bale type deal, forget it.</br></br>  Suou is best girl  <br>yes suou bestest</br>  <br>Chinese Electric Batman<br><br>It's pretty fucking good, give it a go.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Who?</br></br>  <br>watch the first season</br>    <br><br>That artist is great, he really loves Suou.<br><br>Heard he died in the earthquake, can anyone confirm?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Glad I just pretend it ended with the first season.</br>  <br>Training bra and pantyhose. This is something I needed.</br>  <br>Nice fanart.</br>  With the help of Sb69 and Kekkai<br>S4 SOON</br>    <br>Yea his first pixiv posts were of her and you can see how his art improves as he contributes for best girl.</br>  <br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?id=1419371<br><br>his art for anyone interested</br></br></wbr></br>   #<br> &gt;Chinese Electric Batman <br><br>Hei isn't chinese<br>supervisor denies it in Japanese book.<br>Li Shenshun is false name, too.<br><br><br>Hei is Golgo13 clone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice try, Hei and his sister are both chinese</br>  <br>So he loses yin and gets a loli?</br>    I want to cook perumeni for her every day.  Yes. The season itself was shit but Suou was God-tier.  <br>Damn, this is one of the few fanbooks I'd like to own. <br><br><br><br> Who? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think I would feel that way if it wasn't so different from the first season, on it's own, I think it could have stood as an okay show. But it's not a good follow-up to DTB imo.</br>  <br>Yes, he gets the best girl in DtB<br><br>  Everyone close to him dies, even the shota  </br></br></br>  <br> who? <br><br>A hero</br></br></br>    <br>You can't be best girl when you're dead.<br><br><br>We don't know if Yin is dead. Most probably fell into a coma.<br><br><br><br>Who?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What happened to the S3 hype by the way? You know that thing about the staff members twitter?  <br>She's not dead, she's on another planet, safe from the hellspawn Yin gave birth to after getting soul fucked by Shion.</br>  <br> Who <br>?</br></br>  <br><br><br>I'll check it out. Thanks.</br></br></br>  <br>Normally yes but she's in the same show as Yin so no.</br>  <br>There were a few things I liked about it as a follow up to DTB, like it showing the backstory to Mao who was the only one from the main cast who didn't get his backstory shown in S1.</br>    HEI HEI YOU YOU<br>I DON'T LIKE GIRLFRIEND!<br><br>NO WEI NO WEI<br>I THINK YOU NEED A NEW ONE!<br><br>HEI HEI YOU YOU<br>I COULD BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Best Girl </br>    <br>The thing is it had to do with her collar, and plus everyone gets different powers. All though I must agree a rile for a power is just out of place compared to all the other powers.</br>    <br>No. Havok was.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Hei's commentary<br><br>岡村天斎「黒たちメンバーは、実は中国人ではありません。」 <br><br>岡村天斎「ええ、実は黒は中国の人ではないんです。 あの料理も、一生懸命覚えて中国人のフリをしているんですよ」 <br><br>This book is recommended, too</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is the trip who used to do this even around anymore?<br><br><br> Yin died <br>Except she didn't?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope</br>  <br>I have no idea what that says.</br>  <br>how about Yin?</br>   All these pedophiles <br> Not preferring the smart qt 3.14 Christmas cake that has a stable job and is very loyal to you  <br><br>Suou is cute, but daily reminder Misaki is the best girl</br></br></br>  <br> Suou <br>Who?<br><br> Misaki <br>Acceptable taste.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not everyone is a nigger.</br>  <br>this fuckin guy gets it</br>  <br>After all of these years I still have no idea what that purple patch on the side of his face is.</br>  <br> s3 hype <br><br>It's kinda died down since we haven't received any kind of new speculative info since middle of march. It's been almost 4 fucking months since that cat was revealed on the BONES website and it still hasn't changed. A lot of people are thinking it's going to be Noragami but with all the new info out on the second season like key visuals and even a fucking air date you would think they would've changed it by now. But no, it's still fucking there. The hype will come back when there's some new stuff to talk about. Even Komori one of the head animators/char designers for DTB hasn't posted anything DTB related since March. So yeah, we're in the dark right now but I'm hoping something good will come out of it. My dream is to see a sticky on /a/ with the third season of DTB announced. Who knows, maybe with all the money BONES will get from sbr and KS it's possible.</br></br></br>  <br>Fake birthmark to throw off the feds.</br>    <br>That Chinese Neo was pretty badass.</br>  <br>Just shit like this is why I want more DTB. These fight scenes are so fucking GOAT.</br>    <br>She's cute</br>  <br>is that even possible?</br>  <br><br>I just checked it and it's still there. Goddammit bones, you would think with only 3 months until Fall that they would reveal what their last original anime is right? Don't they need to release the info ahead of time to start promoting and get people hyped? <br><br>Also I heard a while back that Tomoki Kyoda (director of E7 and AO) was going to be involved? Is this true and if so is there a credible source somewhere?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Hei and Yin ran away into that interdimensional shit and left a kid in the hell's gate</br>  <br>Why is Suou pure sex?</br>  Hei and I disagree.  Should we just kickstart DTB S3 like the Japanese did for shenmue 3?  <br>Yep, it's pretty good. The only bad thing about it is the insane ending. I think most people hate it because it's nothing like s1. It's very story driven compared to s1's episodicness. But I don't think that's a bad thing.</br>  <br>I'd wait until after DTB's 10th anniversary passes. We still got 2 years to hope.</br>  <br>S3 hype anon shut up after anime expo revealed it was just promotion.<br>There won't be any S3.</br></br>  <br> She's not dead, she's on another planet <br>clones don't count<br><br><br>What kind of OC is that?<br><br><br>Shouldn't you be on some Aquarion threads or something, instead of posting worst girl?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tfw back then i didnt realized her VA is kanahana. and people keep saying she can only voiced same character</br>  Is it alright to take advantage of special needs girls?  <br><br>If their special need is a dicking, yes</br></br>  <br>Did Hei and her do it?</br>  <br>Yin is dead and was the stated outcome after she and Shion created satan</br>  <br>Souls exist in DtB, hers and quite a bit of others where shot into notEarth</br>  <br>I think they just hugged a lot.<br><br> Gaiden and Gemini sucked, should've quit while they were ahead. </br></br></br>  Suou &gt; average Rei clone &gt; Yin  Hei will die.<br><br>But his soul will chose to go back in time, the the time when he was happiest, and he will be at season 1 first episode.<br><br>Suou who loves Hei want to be with him too and want to be in a time when Hei'd love her, but since he already loves Yin she'll go back in time before Hei is born, and became his mother.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Suou is not only worst girl in her series, but is a contender for top ten worst girls of the decade.<br><br>She is shit in every department imaginable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How can that be true when Yin has more personality than either of them?<br><br>And that's saying something since Suou isn't even a real operator.</br></br></br>  <br> Yin has more personality <br>You gotta lay off the fanfiction</br></br>  <br>See, you would have a point there, except Yin got more developmental episodes than Suou did so you're not.</br>  <br> Going from a statue to a statue that cares about you and tries to show the little emotions she has like 3 times in the entire series. <br><br>Wow what development Even the shota doll developed more.</br></br></br>  <br>He basically loses his powers and has to deal with his emotions as human(and being a drunkard husband who beats up his young waifu) , except for the end it is really good especially OP.</br>  <br><br><br>The new Bones original was revealed  and it's not DTB S3. (Try not to shit on it because of that too much).</br></br></br>    <br>Good taste bro</br>    <br>that's what I don't get either<br>she's not even that cute with her hairstyle and her weird clothes. combine that with her literally having the personality of a brick and you easily have worst girl.<br>must be pedo bait or something</br></br></br>  <br>Yin is straight up the best Reiclone around</br>  <br>Patrician taste, right here.</br>    Yin best  <br>The second season really took its toll on her. <br>Season 1: Strong independent japanese girl who don't need no man<br>Season 2: OMG I NEED HEI'S COCK I NEED HEI WHY AM I NOT FUCKING HEI. <br><br>Seriously, her appearance in Season 2 was so radically different from her first season I was like, "Is this a different character?"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty sad when he about to kill her without a second thought and she still wants his dick</br>  <br>webm version of this when?</br>  <br><br><br><br>Different writers guaranteed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That implies anybody wants to make it after the trainwreck that is S2.</br>  <br>that anatomy holy shit<br><br>that extra wide shin, awful leg definition, wrist, weird shoulder, and tiny hand<br><br>my god whoever drew that is on drugs</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I don't know, I think you're ignoring the development of their relationship in the 3 last episodes of S1.</br>  <br>The forced drama.</br>  That lesbian cunt deserve to have her girlfriend killed for being a just that. a lesbian cunt.<br><br>Oh and a psychopath with no empathy, since most contradotrs are just that, they are a THREAT TO THE HUMAN SPECIES!<br><br>Jesus fucking christ kill them all already.</br></br></br></br>   tfw all choices for best girl are actually dead <br><br>Maximum suffering.</br></br>  <br>Forgot about the collarbones girls. Still not as good as Yin or Yin's corpse if that's what's left of her.</br>  <br>It's like one of those meat factories except with best girls instead of cows.</br>  <br>PTRD is still being used in Ukraine conflict, I like this gun, and Pelmeni are quite nice too, but  Yin is best </br>  <br> per'meni instead of pel'meni <br>Leave it to nips to fuck up L/R, regardless of language.</br></br>  <br>I was wondering if I should watch this show. I don't think I should subject my heart to this many girls dying... thanks for sparing me from this.</br>  <br>Don't worry anon, all of them except the redheads, smiley and the blonde suck.</br>  <br>His pixiv has posts from 2012, so no.</br>  <br>She is olev.</br>    <br><br><br>All wrong, it was actually Tanya all along.</br></br></br>  <br>Who?</br>  Yin a Best.<br>Hei agreed, dont bother him about it.</br>  <br>I could have sworn she showed up after that, though. With magic hair.</br>  <br>So if I stick to season 1 I can reduce the dead girls?<br><br>Man, I hate skipping seasons but I really regret chuunibyou season 2</br></br></br>  <br>Yin always seemed more like a replacement sister than anything else. Of course, that also means that Hei cares more about her than any other character, just not romantically.</br>    <br>scariest power</br>    <br>Way more dead girls in S1</br>  <br>That's not Yin.</br>  <br>Obviously, we're talking about best girl</br>  <br>stop trolling OP <br><br>there was no girl named Suou in DtB. I seem to remember a girl sort of like that in some shit teir level magical girl anime about some abusive drunk hobo, a magical girl with an assault riffle and some autistic silver hair girl.<br><br>I don't know how anyone could mistake that steaming pile of shit for DtB though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly. So what about Yin do you want to talk about? Her perfection in every department?</br>  Yin is best girl  <br>See, this is what I'm talking about. Why are people so extreme and hyperbolic when talking about S2? I guess I have that to thank for enjoying it so much, my expectations were set so low I really enjoyed it.</br>  <br>Nice fan art. Who is this girl anyways?</br>  <br>What happen to her powers when she goes bald?</br>  <br> See, this is what I'm talking about. Why are people so extreme and hyperbolic when talking about S2? I guess I have that to thank for enjoying it so much, my expectations were set so low I really enjoyed it. <br>there was nothing this so called season 2 you're talking about that bore any resemblance to DtB. there was no season 2, just some shit teir magical girl anime and her drunk hobo abuser.</br></br>  <br><br> just some magical girl anime and her drunk hobo abuser. <br>this is my fetish</br></br></br>  <br> Implying a loli Hanakana being abused by a drunk hobo isn't hot </br>  <br>Post-autism Tanya</br>   Yin <br> Rei Clone <br> Best Girl </br></br>  <br> Christmas cake  <br> Still a virgin <br><br>Disgraceful</br></br></br></br>  <br> On the run with no money <br> Still buys her cute things to put on. </br></br>  Just imagine this:<br><br>Anal with Yin.</br></br>  <br>See? That thing you keep doing. That's what I'm talking about.</br>  <br>L-lewd!<br><br> I was scrolling through my pics for an appropriate reaction image but scrolled across this thumbnail and wanted to see the file full size. </br></br></br>  <br>There are HD textures for the HUD aswell somewhere.</br>  <br><br> that scene at Vladivostok station <br> Russian railways use the 5 foot/1520 mm Russian Gauge <br> tracks in the scene have been drawn in the 3 foot 6 inch/1067 mm Cape Gauge as used on (non-Shinkansen) railways in Japan. <br><br>I was triggered, and triggered hard.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  What went wrong?  <br>Recoloured Shirou.</br>  Takeuchi is a terrible artist.  <br>I genuinely though Shiki came out first. How can he be the recolored one?</br>  <br>I can't wait for Persona 5.</br>  <br>"We want the Persona audience" -- Takinoko Takenasu, 1998</br>  <br>Dem legs tho</br>  <br>Who is this handsome devil</br>  <br>He is the Black Man.</br>    <br>Are they all orgasming</br>  <br>I don't know how, but a lot of TM's fans seem to forget this fact quite easily.</br>  How is it that all the redesigns have so little personality compared to Takeuchi's shitty old art?  <br>Is that harry potter</br>  Make way for the true, new bad ass.<br><br>Tohno gonna be like "TOH NO!" when his best bud starts NTRing his ass.</br></br>    <br>The VN was shit.</br>    <br> the most irrelevant character gets the most solid update <br>Goddammit, TM.</br></br>  <br>Stop making me laugh so much, please.</br>  <br>Old Shiki has more personality in his ugly t-shirt than the entirety of the redesigns combined.</br>  <br>But he's a god tier irrelevant character.</br>    <br><br> HA.HA.HA.HA.HA.HA.HA.HA.HA.HA.HA.HA<wbr>.-<br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</br></wbr> </br></br>  <br>What's he doing?</br>  <br>We really don't know if he's irrelevant anymore.</br>  <br><br>Having a good time.</br></br>  <br>The favorite TM sport  raping maids </br>  <br><br>Arihiko is a bro for the ages, and has an awesome sexpot onee-chan, but come on, we all know he will never be relevant.

I think they look cute.</br>  <br>He's pretty refreshing from your standard nice guy protagonist, even if it only functions as a berserk and rape mode.</br>   Flower of Thanatos &gt;Drinking Dreaming Moon  A Story for the Evening&gt; Tohno Family Con Game  &gt; The others &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Good luck, Ciel-sensei! <br><br> Ciel is garbage. </br></br>   <br>The actual character Nanaya Shiki is only in KT and Melty.

We have a confirmed Sacchin route right?</br></br>  So, will it have porn or not?  <br>Of course not. Lewd TM will never come back.</br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't</br>  <br>Shiki turned into a Shirou clone.<br>Arc turned into a Saber clone.</br></br>  Best girl.  <br>Why is her head so big?

Maybe you're the actual alien here.</br>  <br>What the fuck did they do to best onee-san?</br>  <br>  asian women in a nutshell </br>  <br>That's a new character.</br>  <br>Her head is fine, dude.</br>  He still looks like rapist.  <br>Good</br>  <br><br>Isn't his only problem samefacing?</br></br>  <br>Exactly.</br>  <br>Samefacing and reusing character designs.<br>None of his characters ever feel that "new".<br>He has improved over the years though, that's for sure.</br></br></br>  <br>Did we ever know what was her work?<br><br>Going out by night and sleeping by day, only giving arihiko money sometimes... fishy</br></br></br>  <br>What's the point then.</br>  <br>He looks so fucking good. <br>Best redesign for  second  best boy.</br></br>  <br>;_;</br>  <br> dayum </br>  Takeuchi forgot how to draw glasses. Even ciels look like shit. Fuck that guy.  <br>they didnt keep the Melty Blood designs</br>  <br>Sameface syndrome and post moe era.</br>  <br>This. The later Melty style looks fantastic.</br>  <br> Shiki still wearing that shitty shirt </br>  <br> So how do you want to redesign Shiki, Nasu? <br> Take Shirou's design and just   fix his shit up </br></br>  <br>Assumed so since she has a spot with all the other heroines</br>  <br>Actually in <br>Shirou looks better.</br></br>  <br>He's still a disgusting ginger so Shirou takes the L for that.</br>  <br>Does Takeuchi just have like character templates from which to copy from</br>  <br>There's no gland, it was always the shirt.</br>  <br>It really does.</br>  <br>Ah you can't self insert to a ginger, gotcha.</br>  <br>People don't really think they look alike do they?</br>  <br> Even ciels look like shit <br><br>What a suprise</br></br></br>  <br> self inserting <br><br>Nah, you good. I prefer to be Blick Winkel because if I self inserted I would do shit much, much differently.</br></br></br>  <br>please no bully senpai</br>  <br>It will be hard for me to get used to her new hairstyle.<br> I liked the hair of the old desing </br></br>  <br>Hnngg</br>  <br>More like Shirou copied Nanaya Shiki's hair. <br>Have you forgotten what their original hairstyles looked like?<br>We've been telling you since a long time ago that FSN's newer designs just copied Tohno Shiki from Melty Blood.</br></br></br>   What went wrong? <br>JUST</br>  <br> Shiki making Len do all the moving <br>He's a pervert.</br></br>  <br><br>The new Sacchin looks like shit dude.</br></br>  Burgessfags and Doffyfags BTFO<br><br>hopefully Sanjifags will get BTFO next</br></br>   btfo <br><br>good to see this thread is off to a good start</br></br>  <br>This is already gone shit without having anyone posting in the thread yet.</br>  <br><br>Let's fix that. Post Robin.</br></br>  <br>You get BTFO, and you get BTFO, everyone get's BTFO!</br>  Spoilers<br>Chapter 792: Dear<br>Sabo defeats Burgess, and lets him go<br>Burgess is humiliated, he calls a man whose silouhette has antlers<br>CP0 looks at Doffy from above, they move for the kill but Fujitora stops them<br>Koala meets Sabo, they have to leave now that they got their information and everyone's safe, but Sabo wants to say goodbye to Luffy first<br>Dressrosa medics are taking care of Luffy and Law, they decide to carry them off to the royal plateau<br>The man with the antlers is revealed to be  a deerman who ate the dia dia no mi. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At least censor your filth with a spoiler.</br>  <br>fake as OP with girlfriend</br>  <br><br><br>new discussion thread</br></br></br>  So I think we can all agree that this guy has an ant zoan devil fruit. Ants are after all the strongest organism. Also it would make a lot of sense and tie into drake. When drake was a kid he followed a weakling captain. Dinosaurs are usually stronger than ants. This is probably a mental thing drake has and supports kaido being an ant zoan. Also In Hunter x Hunter the strongest character was an ant.  <br>So does Burgerss call Sabo soft just like his other brothers? If so then this might imply that ace won the fight with blackbeard and wasn't going to kill him and blackbeard took advantage of it.</br>  <br>This must be bait...</br>  <br>I'm dead serious. Just think about it and you'll see</br>  <br>If anything, soft is the reference to either how he died, protecting Luffy, or refusing to cooperate with Teach to capture Luffy. There's no way that he won to BB and then got captured. Makes zero sense. He was going to kill him due to the laws of Whitebeard, which he no doubt followed.</br>  <br>Chimera zoan</br>  <br>Hydra<br> Hundred beast Kaidou </br></br>  I miss Caimie  <br><br> Deerman <br><br>I imagined some epic looking dude with horns and fur looking like absolute beast! Then I remembered that this is One Piece.</br></br></br></br>    <br>heh</br>      Is this the saddest OP page?  Evangelion is garbage.  agree  Rei is the best girl  Agreed  <br>yep i agree</br>    Agreed, Q is terrible. NGE is still fantastic though.  <br>Q was one of the better parts of the franchise. You probably have no brain.</br>  <br>true rebuild sucks</br>  <br>BLACK AND RED; RED AND BLACK<br>FUCKING POETRY</br></br>  <br>Best part about it is the music<br><br>Gods gift is so damn good</br></br></br>  <br>That's rather funny. I didn't know that poorly written, nonsensical garbage could even be compared to the masterpiece that is End of Evangelion.</br>  <br>Original show is okay at best. Any perceived depth in the show in terms of plot and themes only appears so due to how muddled and poorly portrayed everything is. The most interesting is the later episodes because they're open to interpretation for philosophical ideas, but that depends on what you bring to the table and not what Anno presents to you.<br><br>The characters are realistic and relatable to a degree, so it's got that going.</br></br></br>  <br> due to how muddled and poorly portrayed everything is <br>In what way?</br></br>  <br>There is no clear exposition on the Angels, Seele, or any of the lore. You're given small glimpses if you pay really close attention, something viewers probably wouldn't do the first time around when the immediate character interactions appear more interesting than the overarching story. There's being subtle and then there's poor writing and an inability to get your story across to the viewer.</br>  <br>Pretty much everything is explained by the end. The mystery exists to set a certain tone. Moreover, the overarching lore really isn't terribly vital to the actual character story going on.</br>  <br>SHINJI IS MUFF CABBAGE</br>  <br>So you do have no brain. Interesting. I thought a human needed a brain in order to live, but you disproved this hypothesis.</br>  Mari confirmed for best thing about rebuild.  <br>What fantastic arguments.</br>  <br>God's Message is also pretty damn amazing</br>  <br><br>Rather than talk shit and call each other names why don't you hold an actual discussion?</br></br>  The threads for it certainly are  <br> You probably have no brain. <br>Fucking styled upon, how will he ever recover from that?</br></br>  <br>what's new?</br>  Why does Evangelion have such a large fanbase? It doesn't seem like the majority of fans enjoy it for the few merits it has in philosophical themes or psychological trauma. If they wanted robots or cute girls there are better franchises.  <br>I'll start. The entire theme of Shinji taking responsiblity for his actions in 3.0 is utterly nonsensical. I have other, smaller gripes with the film, but that main problem kills the whole movie for me.</br>    <br> The entire theme of Shinji taking responsiblity for his actions in 3.0 <br>That wasn't even a thing. At least pay attention to a show before you talk shit about it.</br></br>  <br>What are you talking about? The whole movie was about him fixing the world with Kaworu.</br>  Agreed. All of EVA is utter shit.  What do you think will happen in Final/3.0+1.0?<br><br><br>You guys crack me up</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think you actually watched anything in this franchise.</br>  <br><br>If you disagree or think he's wrong, explain to him what you think. You just look like a moron otherwise.</br></br>    Rei doesnt have to be best girl because asuka is a meme. Also i want to facefuck misato  <br> asuka is a meme </br>  <br>I'm partial to this interpretation, but I don't know what to expect other than that. Hopefully we'll get a confirmation of whether  Rebuild is a sequel. </br>  <br> It's going to be the biggest middle finger to the fans since EoE. <br>EoE was supposed to be a middle finger to the fans?</br></br>  Kaworu's mind crushing despair and brutal decapitation was the best part of 3.0  <br> The entire theme of Shinji taking responsiblity for his actions in 3.0 is utterly nonsensical. <br><br>You mean that thing he never did? Him running away from responsibility was the cause for the whole climax.<br><br>If it is his responsibility. Awfully convenient how Kaowru lays that burden on him when it's HIS Eva stuck up Lilith's big white cooch.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Brutal dogfight between the Wunder and the Black Moon. We'll learn that the fallout of Third Impact and N3I wasn't as bad as it looked in 3.0. We'll find out what the hell that spinning crucifix thing inside the Doors of Guf really is.</br>  <br>I find the entire idea of Shinji even being responsible for anything that happened inbetween 2.0 and 3.0 to be ludicrous.</br>  NGE is the Boku no Pico of mecha anime  <br>I don't think he was either. We saw the fallout of Unit 01's awakening: the roof of the Geofront was blown off and the fissure that would later be lined with teeth was formed, but the rest was caused by whatever shit went down between Lilith, the Mark 06 and the 12th Angel.<br><br>That was even set up in 1.0:<br> Misato: If an Angel comes into contact with Lilith, humanity will be wiped out in the Third Impact. <br><br>Unit 01 could have reawakened sometime in the interim since they apparently pulled the Spear of Cassius out of it before sealing it away, but we've also seen Shinji has no conscious recollection when Unit 01 acts on its own.<br><br>Kaworu leads Shinji to believe it's his fault, and he assumes that's why Wille is so frosty toward him. But if you listen to Ritsuko when she's explaining the situation with Unit 01, they put that choker on him ONLY because Unit 01 awakened during the recovery mission.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn it, this was meant for <br><br/></br></br>  <br>I disagree with that part too. I think EOE is critical of the otaku "escapist" lifestyle, but it's not a middle finger to fans in general.</br>  <br>God damn he's so fucking hot when he's getting dominated. My dick is diamonds.</br>  <br>You gay, son?</br>  <br> not getting hard to Kaworu being gangraped <br>The only gay one here is you.</br></br>  <br>You gay, son.</br>  <br>No, not really. It's a widely repeated idea among poorly read nerds who insist that every work of popular fiction must have a singular 'subversive' meaning that only they have understood. That post has all the features of this mode of thinking: condescending references to an imagined collective Japanese otaku; misinformed ideas about Evangelion's relation to 'anime archetypes'; "Rei was supposed to be CREEPY"; "Anno hates so-and-so". At least there was no mention of deconstructionism or the exaggeration of death threats against Gainax.</br>  <br>The death threats thing comes from the letter sequence in End of Evangelion. There are one or two threats in there and a couple talking about some graffiti at the studio, but most of it is fanmail praising Death and Rebirth or the tv series and getting hyped for the movie.<br><br>I've never understood the idea that Rei is supposed to be a middle finger to the waifu crowd when the show treats her as a socially retarded person who grows and learns from the kind acts of her friends.</br></br></br>  <br>Agreed. 2.22 was the best part of the franchise, only autists dislike it. Also, if you like 3.33 you're a retard.</br>  <br>Not that guy but it's simple: favoritism within a fanbase. It's the ugliest thing about the EVA community in my opinion.<br><br>Following Evangelion popularity, there was (and is still) a not so insignificant number of fans who were jealous and insecure about their favorite character.<br><br>More precisely, Rei was so absurdly popular all the rest did was to muddle about in the character's shadow. In otaku fandom this breeds hatred and contempt for Rei, and from there you get the various myths that "Rei is supposed to be CREEPY", and that you weren't supposed to like the character.<br><br>Because through making up such a story, they could convince themselves (and hopefully others) that Rei's popularity as well as quality of character was a mistake, that it wasn't rightly founded. The idea or fantasy is appealing to subgroups of Eva-fans because it subverts the 'enemy' of their favorite character.<br><br>The idea still propagates itself among shallow people in the fanbase despite having no backing in the story itself, or being said to be the case from the author.<br><br>Even if there was a case for the latter, what things were "supposed to be" don't correspond always with what it actually turns out to be. <br><br>tl;dr<br>Groups of people adopt ideas that benefit them despite said ideas being easy to prove wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The destruction of the world as well as blaming Shinji for it exists for one purpose:<br><br>To associate death, destruction and failure with Shinji's preceding actions, his motive at the time. Which isn't just starting an impact (that is the means, and an unknowing means at that), specifically it is to save Rei Ayanami at that time in 2.0.<br><br>Through this Khara is able to claim that liking Rei is wrong, and that he should be punished for doing so by rewriting the story so that it is the outcome. This is supplemented with the presentation of other characters as angry (angry with Shinji and dismissive of Rei) but decisively stronger variants of both their previous selves and the version in the original. That creates a juxtaposition which does not serve to endow the characters with individual depth, but to show them as better or worse in relation to each other.<br><br>This is the only effect (besides put an end to any further serious or realistic development of the characters) that exists post 3.0. <br><br>Given what the movie series has presented us the moral question of whether or not he's actually guilty is moot, since the point of it is to present him as guilty because that's the veridict the movie wants to reach, despite the actual facts.<br><br>That's why a timeskip and largely rewriting the entire story is necessary, as well as having characters act unrealistically stupid - it wouldn't be possible otherwise.<br><br>Some might argue that the final movie will clear this up, but they haven't thought about it further than hoping. The amount of rewrites and backstory hacks needed to make 3.0 work would reach even more ridiculous levels than we're already at. It has to be hammered down to fate or some past-life decision involving a contrived system of loops.<br><br>Essentially to make Shinji the equivalent of Satan 'but he just doesn't remember', or something like that. One thing is for sure, the "normal boy" Shinji is not a thing in Rebuild.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why does everyone keep using this shitty fujoshit reaction image?</br>  <br>It conveys the reaction or emotion they want?</br>  <br/>  <br>Best part of Rebuild maybe. Agreed on the rest.</br>    <br>How full of shit. Did you actually watch the movie where Kaworu and Kaworu alone blames Shinji? And nobody else?<br><br> Through this Khara is able to claim that liking Rei is wrong, and that he should be punished for doing so by rewriting the story so that it is the outcome. <br><br>No they aren't. This is pure headcanon They've spelled out the message so plainly they're practically beating you over the head with it.<br><br>The crime Shinji is being "punished" for is constantly acting in his own self-interest with no consideration for what happens to others.<br><br> I don't care what happens to me, I don't even care what happens to the world! <br>And he blunders into Near-Third Impact.<br>And then he blunders into Fourth Impact and gets Kaworu killed despite everyone telling him not to.<br>Mari calls him out on it. Asuka calls him out on it, even Sakura tells him to stay the fuck out of the Eva but he still does it and he brings misery down on himself because he's still concerned solely for what he wants until it's too late to stop.<br><br>He did it FOR Rei but that's overlooking the bigger issue that's being laid out.<br><br> dismissive of Rei <br>Because they realized she's not the Rei they know, she's a disposable clone soldier who's been killed hundreds of times over. Asuka and Mari both engage with her when she starts thinking for herself.<br><br> Some might argue that the final movie will clear this up, but they haven't thought about it further than hoping. The amount of rewrites and backstory hacks needed to make 3.0 work would reach even more ridiculous levels than we're already at.

That guy is way too far gone for mortal men to bring him back to reason.</br>  <br>Yeah, you're right. I started to realize that as I was posting. It's the same strain of assmad hyperbole coming from Metroid fans in the wake of Federation Force<br><br> This isn't exactly what I wanted so it's proof Nintendo hates me and the franchise and they're just doing it to spite us all! <br><br>It's so...arrogant.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The crime Shinji is being "punished" for is constantly acting in his own self-interest with no consideration for what happens to others. <br>Then ask yourself what his interest is, which is at the point in time: Rei Ayanami.<br>Therefore his crime is having an interest in Rei Ayanami.<br><br>This is the actual bigger issue, what you presented was a generalized version of it that when analyzed falls into pieces. (something others have already done)<br><br>Now let's consider how they present Rei:<br> Because they realized she's not the Rei they know, she's a disposable clone soldier who's been killed hundreds of times over. <br><br>This is something they wrote, that is the writers made Rei something far lesser than she originally was.

Anime critics are still blinded by commercial success: Evangelion sold more than anything else (not true, by the way), therefore it must have been the greatest. Anime critics are often totally ignorant of anime of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that Evangelion did anything worth of being saved.  <br>But it wasn't really Kaworu, it was Shinji.</br>  <br>I get the feeling that's going to be used for the sake of NGE-esque meta commentary in 4.0.</br>  <br> failing to understand why Eva is popular. <br><br>God damn, let me break it down for your dumbass.<br><br>1. Evangelion came out a particular time. Japan's economic bubble had burst and things were looking bad. Japan in the late 80s and early 90s was doing better than ever, actually better, in many ways, than it is doing now. From 1984 to 1995 the Japanese economy went from $1.2 trillion GDP to $5.2 trillion. That's fucking crazy growth. Of course, it was a bubble, and in 1995 it popped. Here comes Evangelion. If you know something about Japan, you know that they have a crushing corporate culture, where you essentially give your life to the company in exchange for stability, in a sort of modern version of sharecropping. If you don't go to college or get a good white collar job, you're essentially a pariah. Evangelion appealed to both of these groups. Young Japanese businessmen could see themselves in Shinji; they lacked pretty much any autonomy and had to do what they were told. Young anime fans loved it because it touched on issues every teenager goes through.<br><br>2. The series itself is tremendously done. It's framing and cinematography are excellent. The music is memorable as fuck. There's something for everyone in the show: mecha, cute girls, conspiracy, aliens, and an exploration of one important part of what it means to be human - interacting with others.<br><br>3. Gainax had a slick marketing team who put Evangelion on anything and everything. Lots of people who didn't catch the original series heard about the show through its marketing. The series stirred up a lot of controversy, with Anno getting lots of death threats and shit. EoE basically solidified it in the otaku culture of Japan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying NGE is only good because it sold well </br>  <br>A lengthy, irrelevant post coupled with an air of superiority. Nice. I like it.</br>  <br> actually falling for shitty /mu/ copypasta </br>  <br>It isn't, and if you think so you probably aren't very smart and are upset that normies like it but they don't like your gochiusa and yuru yuri</br>  <br>Yes, that's all the Rebuilds are, fucking Anno.<br><br>Anno is a Kojima who hates his fans.</br></br></br>  <br>Quality post.</br>  <br> going to /mu/ <br> ever <br><br>Guilty as charged</br></br></br></br>  <br>Quality post.</br>  <br>Rebuild is terrible. Fucking 3D CGI eva and angels were horribly implemented. It was lazy.</br>  <br>Kek.<br><br>Nothing personnel kid.</br></br></br>  <br>Quality post.</br>  <br>He only hates the Otaku fans that like Rei. All the other fans he's okay with.</br>  <br>Can't wait to be told I need to grow up from a man that spent the last 20 years making the same anime</br>  <br>Mainly the perverted Japanese business men Anon, mainly the perverted Japanese business men.</br>  <br>That's cute.</br>  <br> not being an expert on every single 4chan meme on every board </br>  <br>He hates people that like Rei period.<br><br>Anno is a petty otaku.</br></br></br>  <br>Not true. He likes Sadamoto and the other 3 Reifans from Khara. He only hates the fat autistic otaku who like Rei.</br>  <br> Sadamoto <br> Reifag </br></br>  <br>Not true. He refers to Rei fans as a national phenomenon, any fat autistic otaku is OK in his book as long as they obsess over Annos waifus.<br><br>Sadamoto also isnt a Rei fan either.</br></br></br>  <br> this meme <br>Pls, its 2015 and everyone knows Annos butthurt about Rei being better than Asuka and others.</br></br>  <br><br>He is a Reifag though.<br>  I think, if you take Asuka as being, for Shinji, a symbol of the longed-for opposite sex, Rei is "maternal." For one, it seems like she has the genetic material of Shinji's mother. For myself, if I am asked who between Asuka and Rei I like more, it is probably because somewhere in Rei there is something motherly, and when Shinji looks disheartened she "scolds" him ever so softly. Rei asks Shinji, "Are you running away again?" Quite often she says harsh things that really get down to the point. It would be ideal if a friend of his would say it, but for some reason that doesn't happen. That [action of Rei's] is because a mother will absolutely not abandon her child. I think that, for Shinji, Rei is that sort of motherly existence. </br></br></br>  <br>Everyone always exaggerates Anno liking Asuka, when in truth he's vocally talked shit about all the girls before. <br> Anno: Sadists, without question, go to Rei, because of their sadistic desires. I believe that masochists go to Asuka. And, there is a tendency for women of the same generation and people who are children mentally to go to Misato. <br><br>The only character Anno is a fag about is Kaworu, because the Iku-chan lust is too real.</br></br></br></br>  <br> people who are children mentally to go to Misato. </br>  I don't know how anyone who claims to like NGE can say they like 3.0. 3.0 ripped all the soul out of the series and completely removed any depth or complexity to any of the characters, particularity Asuka and Misato whose entire backstories were cut due to the fact the movie decided to completely jump around in terms of plot.  <br>If you liked NGE, you probably won't like Rebuild. End of story.</br>  <br>I liked NGE, but I thought Rebuild was much more fun.</br>  <br> I don't know how anyone who claims to like NGE can say they like 3.0 <br><br>I can think of a reason</br></br></br>  <br>The visuals after they fixed the chins were nice. Sound was GOAT. <br>And the humor was great. Everyone in the movie being legitimately retarded was a risky move on Anno's part, but it really hit home as a farce. It nailed the kind of biting, really acidic sarcasm found all throughout the original series.</br></br>  <br> The visuals after they fixed the chins were nice. <br>I guess things look nice in terms of pure visuals, but the animated fights were inferior to EoE in my opinon.</br></br>  <br>None of that says Reifags to me.<br><br><br>Not really shittalking. His favorite is Asuka.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She touched the Fruit of Life and became ageless<br><br><br>It's possible. Kaworu said the Eva was made autonomous before that happened, but I won't be surprised if one of the Ayanami series was at the controls.<br><br>The 12th Angel started transforming into a giant red Rei before Eva 13 turned it into a jawbreaker and it had some kind of effect on ReiQ. It mirrors the Rei-creature Zeruel became as well as Armisael in the director's cut, and it's a handy explanation for Lilith turning into a giant Yui.<br><br>The other explanation for that is Unit 01 being involved, but I sure as hell can't figure out a chain of events that involves Unit 01, Mark 06, and the 12th Angel all three.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaworu haters? Makes sense, I guess.</br>  <br>People in this fandom will like anything that serves their own agenda.<br><br>Even a movie as dumb as 3.0.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that's exactly what I was implying...</br>  <br>He thinks of Kaworu fans. <br><br>Kaworu ended up on the main poster sucking up more time than anyone can justify.</br></br></br>  <br>Hey, new Ramiel was the cat's pajama's.</br>  <br> None of that says Reifags to me. <br> When given a chose between Rei and Asuka, I choose Rei <br> Not a Reifan <br>U wot m8?<br><br><br> transforming into a giant red Rei <br>The creepy part was that it transformed into an Adam's embryo-type thing before Rei. I wonder if there's any true distinction between fruit of life and fruit of knowledge beings anymore in Rebuild.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, definitely. But EOE was a once-in-a-lifetime movie honestly. All the factors needed to get this otaku all the money and time he needed to make his ultimate self-hatred/self-acceptance masturbation session are insane to think about.<br>The fact that Anno was able to make the movie he wanted like 16 years ago completely unrestrained really makes me hope he pulls something great out of his ass for whatever the next movie is called.</br></br>  <br>He only says he's asked it, doesn't give you an actual answer.<br><br>Sadomoto said he doesn't like Rei because she's gloomy earlier.<br><br>Cut the idiocy m8.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>3.0+1.0 will probably continue what 3.0 started.<br><br>More "Rei is doll", "Misato is fighting for the good but dies", "Kaworu comes back for cameo", and more Asuka action fanservice.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>You're both stupid<br><br>Shut up and let me watch my mech drama in peace</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> gets entire movie to himself <br> somehow ends up shallower then his NGE counterpart </br></br>  <br>Butthurt Kaworufag detected. Besides I was right anyway.</br>  <br><br> this damage control </br></br>  <br>You don't need to be here to watch EVA.<br><br>Also you're mech drama is shit (as long as you're talking about 3.0)</br></br></br>  <br>That whole sequence was pretty damn creepy. In the stinger for 1.0, Seele 01 mentions a covenant with Lilith and a planned resurrection, which implies she either was dead or would die eventually. <br><br>I'm starting to wonder if that wasn't the plan with Evangelion 13 all along. Resurrect Lilith as the Evangelion with the additional power of two Adams and the 12th Angel.</br></br></br>  <br>3.0's Kaworu is a refined Kaworu designed to cater to Kaworu fans. There's various redesigns and lore changes as well as overindulgent inclusion of the character that go into making that happen.<br><br>None of it has anything to do with character depth, because that isn't the draw of the character to begin with; pure unbridled fanservice is.</br></br></br>  <br><br>There's nothing sweeter than being drenched in neckbeard tears first thing in the morning!</br></br>   kaworufags are at it again <br>well at least the obnoxious asukafag autist got banned.</br>  <br>And my waifu is shit right? <br><br>Jesus at least learn a new insult you autistic piece of dreck</br></br></br>  <br>With all the imagery 3.0 took from Nadia, you can probably watch episodes 35-39 and get a good outline for the plot of 3.0+1.0</br>  <br><br><br>It's time to join Robin in heaven, little anon.</br></br></br>  <br><br>All you need to know about EVA's overarching plot is that the world is going to end if they don't pilot the robots, but it might still end if they do.<br><br>Everything else is accessory.</br></br></br></br>  Evangelion is shit and its fans are the worst part of it.<br><br>See: this entire thread's misplaced sense of superiority and how quick every poster is to dismiss and insult everyone else rather than hold a discussion.</br></br>  <br>At this point it's hard to tell just what exactly is the deal with Adam and Lilith in Rebuild. Lilith's head looks like Yui's in 3.0, and Kaworu is the first angel despite there being four Adams. It's a far more convoluted sci-fi plot than anything NGE ever concocted.</br>  <br>You know what a notorious fact is? If not Google it<br><br>NGE being good is a notorious fact</br></br></br>  <br>It's only self-referential material, as far as plot goes it has zero value thus far.<br><br>The imagery remains just that, imagery. The only plot you'll get is one that fuels Anno's drive to accessorize his waifus and act out this image: </br></br></br>  <br>It's also pointless and boring, nobody cares about the SF backdrop of NGE, people care about the characters and Rebuild has butchered them</br>  <br> nobody cares about the SF backdrop of NGE <br>They cared enough to request Anno explain it to them with NGE2.</br></br>  <br>I am truly convinced.</br>  <br>He's right if Evangelion includes 3.0. Then 3.0 sort of drags it down. Which it sort of does. There's no escaping the passage of time.</br>  <br>NGE is not Rebuild</br>  <br>How about this:<br><br>There is no plot. Three movies in, there is absolutely no plot or working sci-fi included here. The changes from NGE-&gt;Rebuild come into place on a need-to-be basis, rather than as part of an overarching story or plot movement.<br><br>There is no plot, only trivia of convenience.<br><br><br>Not him, but the reason for that is that there was a working story and a sci-fi plot that could be explained while also keeping the story's moral and message intact. That's not the case for Rebuild.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rebuild is Evangelion. You and him did say Evangelion, not Rebuild.<br><br>Which is the only thing that makes sense, because none of the fans can agree to give up on tidbits from the various Evangelion stories. They can say Rebuild is nonsense, but they'll still keep the character projections when they discuss Evangelion. It's a mish-mash that doesn't have a solid form even if you try.</br></br></br>  <br>That's just Anno milking Eva <br><br>Fact is the Angels could have been actual Angels or whatever magical entity you want and nothing that made NGE good would change</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12745776 <br>It will probably be a whole lot less convoluted once we see the full scope of the Adams/Lilith situation. The Adams are probably part of the First Ancestral Race or some shit like that</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vLL<wbr>FfBZZRRE</wbr>  [ ]  <br> You and him did say Evangelion <br>No I said Neon Genesis Evangelion, not to be confused with Rebuilf of Evangelion</br></br>  <br>It's not good, it's popular and people know how to market it. This is made obvious when you ask an evafag what they like about it and they can't accurately tell you what makes it so good and end up saying 'muh dark themes' or some other contrived bullshit.<br><br>It's an interesting show, but incredibly overrated. It's had such an impact because it set a lot of new anime benchmarks which aren't interesting now, and the characters were fresh for the time and because it was different.</br></br></br>  <br>While you're right, there's a better interpretation of them as aliens or at least alien super-beings. It fits more with the story's concrete facts, it's the dressing that do not.<br><br><br>see <br>He said Evangelion, to which I pointed out that he'd be right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This anon is correct Rebuild's plot is just Khara scrambling to explain Anno's latest brainfart</br>  <br>I'm a huge Evangelion fan, but you're right. The fandom is entirely overrun by idiots like that and after 3.0 they're more or less the only ones left.</br>  <br> It's not good <br>Again NGE being good is a notorious fact, if you want to criticize it then elaborate. Buzzwords like overrated and anecdotal evidence of your conversations with Eva fans are not valid forms of criticism.</br></br>   precure thread   Does anyone have a larger version of this?  <br>Where's that from?

I'm kinda dissapointed  <br> I only go on /a/ for naruto <br> the only people posting about naruto are oldfags I swear! <br><br>Check these dubs, faggot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And yet it has an ongoing thread every fucking day. It wasn't even an anime to start with, it was a shitty browser game. KanColle should fuck off to /jp/, where it belongs.</br>  <br><br> so new they don't remember naruto thread were not welcome here before the ending last year </br></br>    <br>Fuck if I know. It's Kishi. If this was all some setup so Salad could want to become Hokage, there were better ways of doing it.</br>  <br> /a/ is one person </br>  <br><br> Getting nervous? <br><br>I don't give a fuck anymore. I'm just tired of you posting in every thread like you knew before anyone else. You're the one who's most invested in this shit it seems, which makes me think you're an SSfag.</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck off</br>  <br>I agree.</br>   People getting baited by someone who can't read japanese <br><br>Seriously?</br></br>  how long until coolest guy deletes this thread?  <br><br>That lesson was already taught when Salad believed that Sakura wasn't her real mom. <br><br>The reason Karin cannot possibly be the real mom is because of that DNA test thingy. If Kishi wanted to reveal the actual truth back then, he would've had Karin there to explain everything and we would've gotten a flashback. The fact that Kishi decided to reveal that information in a less straightforward way showed that he was hiding something. Furthermore, Naruto insisted to talk about everything later. This implies that there is still a twist coming. Otherwise, there would be no reason to postpone the conversation. I said this many times. The DNA test chapter 100% confirmed that Karin isn't the mom.</br></br></br></br>  What upcoming summer anime do you look forward to the most?  <br>Nice dubs.<br><br><br>Nice trips.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're one person with trips.

Just...hating Naruto?</br>  <br>…and whose clitoris is on your pic?</br>  <br>Exactly, it's wishful thinking.<br><br>He's probably misconstruing a page about Sarada "accepting" Sakura as her mother as meaning that Sakura is her biological mother despite failing to provide any explanation as to the problems that brings up.<br><br>Evil came off as more credible and actually explained some shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe you're right.</br>    <br>Of course he wouldn't lie about something he doesn't fully know.<br><br>Dude can't even read moon.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Checked.</br></br></br></br>  <br>SURE IS SUMMER</br>  <br>I'm just gonna assume Karin is the mom until the chapter comes out.

And this wasn't all. Then Rai comes along and confirms many of the spoilers she gave including that Sakura is the mother.<br><br>I think Rai must have seen something that confirmed to him that Sakura's the mom as everything else he's said fits with what Evil divulged, except for the glasses thing which he didn't comment on. Either Sakura's the mom, or the matter is dropped in some way.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> doesn't know what it is <br><br><br>TRIPLE TRIPS!

TOMO-KUN!!  Are these pictures of sexy 2D girls supposed to annoy us? I find them quite pleasing.  <br><br>I meant that with as many people out there who would literally kill to get the Sharingan, keeping around clones with easily stealable Sharingan doesn't seem very smart.</br></br>      <br>Left.<br><br>Me on the far left here.</br></br></br>  <br>don't know, I don't bother with proxies/vpns/onion routers since I don't care for cheese pizza or similar.<br><br>4chan bans are literally just IP entries and a browser cookie check, so hopping exit nodes would probably work so long as somebody else didn't already get banned on that IP.</br></br></br>  <br><br>If Rai wasn't convinced that the chapter said Sarada was the mom, he wouldn't have said that she was. Now, he could be wrong, but given that nothing he said contradicts what Evil said.<br><br>I think we're looking at a case where it is either made clear that Sakura is the mother and the whole fiasco is explained OR it's left relatively ambiguous for reasons.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What's question 7?</br>  <br>Who doesn't love sexy loli?</br>  I heard rumours about someone getting a 555?

Amidst all the trolling, A lot of what Evil said made sense like the comment about Karin sending Sarada a new pair of glasses while the movie trailer shows her with different glasses<br><br>I have yet to see a solid explanation for Sakura being Sarada's mom.

Maybe Sarada holds up the Taka picture in front of Sakura and she laughs about it. I don't know but seeing as he can't read japanese I won't believe anything until the chapter.</br></br>  I want to make babies with Shinobu.

I'm sticking to this until the chapter reveals otherwise.</br>  <br>Why don't you</br>    <br>Interesting.</br>  <br> /v/ <br><br>I'm just asking what kind of depraved monster would alter such perfection with those horrible colors.</br></br></br>    <br>Kabuto isn't his right hand anymore though.</br>  <br><br>Evil said Sakura and Karin were both present at Sarada's birth. If she's telling the truth, then it must have been revealed in the dialogue or Rai was just saying we didn't see Sakura give birth, though baby Salad might still be shown.</br></br>  <br>You'd be able to rule the entire island with Sakura-level skill and a modicum of common sense. Characters, even 'smart' characters like Kakashi, routinely make the most buttfuck retarded choices and decisions.</br>  How is this not avatarfagging?   no sunflower <br>fuck you too Kishi, all the kids got to appear except her.</br>  <br>The hint being...we should make more Naruto threads? Because that's literally what the shitposters are making us do. They/You could just filter 'naruto' and 'gaiden' and you'd never even see us.</br>  <br>It's an image dump thread not avatarfagging.</br>  <br>maybe her butt hurt</br>    <br>Again, are you so new that you don't know that color combination?</br>  <br>Yeah.</br>  Who's /puffy/ here?  Koshi &gt; Yoshi &gt; shit &gt; Demo    <br>This anime was pretty shit.</br>    <br>Black people are pretty funny.</br>  <br>Wait so she was preggers? How did Sasuke manage to do that?</br>  <br> expecting people to know a shitty boards post culture </br>  <br>No you need to take hint, if you leave them alone you'll only get one Naruto thread where the posters will all stay to themselves and won't spam the board with Nardo threads. However, are being autistic fucks actually deleting the one Naruto thread that is on topic the tards will just spam more threads until one actually sticks around. <br><br>That's what happened the last time until the mods wizened up and left the on topic threads alone.</br></br></br>  <br>wish I had more of black people twitter, it's actually hilarious</br>  <br>That would be hilarious actually</br>    <br>So are those digits.<br><br><br> doesn't know what avatarfagging means <br> N-not new I swear! <br><br><br> not welcome <br> never been welcomed <br> continue to inform him he isn't welcome <br> we can post right? <br><br>We're just going to make your threads shit forever until you leave. If you don't leave, we won't either. I can watch anime and post in other threads. Most of you faggots only post in Naruto threads, making it easier to beat you out through attrition.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> people actually thought she was going to be a major character and that the gaiden was going to be filled with cute NH family moments <br><br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>Impressive</br>  <br>Rai doesn't understand Japanese and is an SSfag so I wouldn't take what he says too seriously.</br>  <br> sunflower <br><br>Who?</br></br></br>  <br>You newfags are pretty hilarious.<br><br>Don't you remember Naruto threads being deleted before the ending last year? We didn't have this problem back then because you Narutards were pretty much non existent on this board.<br><br>All of you came here after the ending. Allowing Naruto threads was a mistake.</br></br></br></br></br>  Why the hell can I never get dubs in this thread?  <br>  Not welcome <br>  You're not allowed to post anime <br>  On a board dedicated to anime <br>  Because I don't like your particular anime <br><br>Grow up, and then leave.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> our secret club.  <br>Being an autist must be fun.</br></br>  <br>You didn't allow shit. They just kept making threads until the shitposters gave up. It'll happen again.</br>  <br>Check mine now.</br>  <br>Noice</br>  <br>Oh god, shut up already<br><br>I hate knowing that I share this board with such tryhards<br><br>I wish you'd put your effort into shitting on cancercolle or im@s threads or, hell, even Shingeki<br><br>No, that's a lie; I wish you'd put your effort into quality posting rather than deliberately shitting up the board out of a false sense of superiority due to your newness, having missed how /a/ was less than a decade ago. So frustrating. Idiocy is a disease.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Himawari, Naruto's other kid.</br>  <br>there needs to be some archive of these pics</br>  <br>Doc, Thanks.</br>  <br>Downboated.</br>  I don't think you guys want another N/a/ruto right? I know I don't.  <br>Just stop replying</br>  Do you know how pathetic that sounds?  <br> Because I don't like your particular anime <br> I <br><br>Because the rest of the board doesn't faggot. We have multiple banners on this site that explicitly details why /a/ hates Naruto.<br><br><br>Getting dubs is fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The mods thought it was ok because it was the ending.<br><br>Clearly you can see that he kind of regret it now.<br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've been here for a while asshole, however unlike you I'm not retarded and realize that if you keep the tards in their containment chambers they won't spam the board with Nardo threads like they did when the series ended. There were literally several threads at a time until the shit posters got tired and the modds wizened up and stopped acting like autistic fucks.</br>  <br>Seemed pretty sure about it, and unlike Evil he's always straightforward about the spoilers rather than doing treasure hunts or being vague.</br>  <br>Only people trying to fit in unironically use the word "Narutard", since if you lurked enough you'd realize most people who read Naruto had a really low opinion of the series.</br>  <br>god work</br>  Naruto is a gateway anime of the worst kind. It's a bad series, a clusterfuck of story and characterization that isn't very well done by any aspect, but which attempts to compensate for its weaknesses by adding in excessive shipping faggotry and DARKNESS. The normal anon can see this as the shit it is, and may enjoy it, hate it or be indifferent to it, but all the while recognizing that the series itself, regardless of their opinion, is plain bad.<br> <br> However, these very aspects that try to smear over the shit of its core make it a breeding ground for aspie, unsociable underageb&amp; faggots who engage in every kind of faggotry both online and in the real world. The superpowered characters all trying their hardest to look cool, the jutsus, peculiar, colorful clothes, the whole ninja faggotry and everything about the Naruto world fuels their escapist fantasies, while the pity-party character backgrounds, emphasis on revenge, and overall preachiness of the series make it fit just right with the mary-sueish drives of your average preteen and his sense of unwarranted self-importance towards the world. Exactly the kind of shit that makes little kiddies and underageb&amp; retards eat this shit right the fuck up.<br> <br> Naruto is basically THE series to attract the most hated anime fanbase known to /a/, which is why, regardless of individual opinions, it is the responsibility of every anon to troll the fuck out of this show and everyone who likes it, and ensure that no Naruto threads ever encourage the newfriends to show their faces here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Its been a while since I posted this.</br>  <br>For you.</br>    <br>He's an SSfag who can't read Japanese, so he doesn't understand the dialogue only the actions.</br>  <br><br> Because the rest of the board doesn't faggot. We have multiple banners on this site that explicitly details why /a/ hates Naruto. <br><br>Because hating Naruto is a meme</br></br></br></br>  PAVERU HAKASE  <br>Uh, you don't get to bring any dubs.</br>  <br> We have multiple banners on this site that explicitly details why /a/ hates Naruto. <br>We have about 1, and it's new.<br><br>The Rock Lee banner has been around for much longer.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  The rest of the board <br>  There are still enough people who like Naruto to constant cap out the replies, even before shits like you come here <br><br>None of you can give a legitimate reason why you can't ignore us. It's always 'muh board culture' or 'hurr durr summer'. Those aren't reasons.</br></br></br></br>  Since /a/ is terrible right now I'm bringing down the law. From this point onwards, it is FORBIDDEN to post on /a/ unless you meet all these requirements:<br><br>-You have seen AT LEAST 100 anime complete anime series OR read at least 100 complete manga series, OR a combination of the two reaching 100. You are exempt from this rule only if you have a very good excuse that prevents you from downloading that much. (eg, your country's internet is owned by jews). By the way, NO MATTER HOW MANY SERIES you have seen in a SINGLE FRANCHISE, ALL THOSE SERIES ONLY COUNT AS ONE COMBINED. All the sailor moon series COUNT AS ONE SERIES.<br>-You do NOT fap to any kind of real life pictures/fantasy/imagining/presence<wbr> of men or woman EVER. Again, this rule has the exception of being okay if it was an IMAGE, FANTASY, OR IMAGINING or even PHYSICAL PRESENCE of your little sister that you pleasured yourself to, WHEN SHE WAS UNDER THE AGE OF 13.<br>- You are not, and have never been FEMALE. This rule is NON-NEGOTIABLE under current known sciences. There is the exception that IF and only IF you have SOMEHOW managed to go from being a man to THE LITTLE GIRL, not THE GIRL but THE LITTLE GIRL (UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE) you will be exempt.<br>- You are OVER THE AGE OF 18. Again, the exception is that if you were a MAN OF AN AGE 18 OR OVER who has BECOME, through science or otherwise, THE LITTLE GIRL OF UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> this is what killed /v/ <br><br>/v/ was always shit</br></br></br>  <br>I WANT DUBS TOO.</br>  <br> Because the rest of the board doesn't. <br><br>The only faggot here is you trying so hard to fit in. /a/ isn't a monolith everyone doesn't have the same beehive opinion.

This rule is COMPLETELY NON-NEGOTIABLE.<br>-Your favorite manga is not, and you do not believe the greatest manga of all time is ANY OF THE BIG THREE.

It's just as mainstream as Eva now.</br></br>  I want /a/ to be the moe board again.<br>I want the board to be full of cute little girls image.<br>Im tired of these normalfags blogging and underaged battle shounen tards.</br></br>    O NO ANOTHER THREAD WAS MADE  <br>And you're blind. I said the banner is new, because it is.<br><br>Were you not here when there was a new banner call? It wasn't all that long ago. The gateway banner was an obvious choice because the meme has been around for a good while, but the banner was new. Many of the banners are new, like you apparently. The Rock Lee banner is old.</br></br></br>  Post Chaika  <br> endless jojo <br> nurudu <br> one piece <br> bleach <br>Not gonna happen.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is a meme. Your mind has been compromised by the genes of the soul, anon.</br>  I hate all normalfags and think they have no place on /a/. I'm not an /r9k/ tier autist but fucking hell, I hate hearing people talk about their lives or their "hurr my gf recommended this"<br>Literally nobody gives a shit about your fucking life. 4chan is not your blog.<br>I hate generals, and I wish everyone who participates in them would get banned<br>I hate crossboarders, especially /soc/, /b/, /pol/ and /v/<br>I hate JoJo faggots, they're by far the most obnoxious people we have here<br>I hate that Naruto is allowed now and nobody seems to even be against it anymore<br>I hate spoonfeeders and wish they would be permanently banned<br>But most of all I hate how posters are becoming less elitist and more friendly to the normalfag masses. You can tell a lot of people who post here don't belong here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't look like it</br>  So it's come to this. I don't even care about Naruto, I just got interested in the recent arc and want to talk about it. But it seems this place is turning into Neogaf or something with "secret rules" that delete things for no reason. And now that it doesn't work the mods just ignore trolls to let them kill a thread.<br><br>At least if you want to ban Naruto entirely, put it in the rules section of the site and make it official. It is flat dishonest to try to kill discussion unofficially. I can't believe this, now I see why moot managed to run this place for so long when so many othe sites failed. The bastard was actually genuinely impartial, and now that he is gone this place is going down the tubes. Sure, it might just be Naruto today, but there is no reason why Type Moon, Key or Eva wouldn't be secretly banned next time. Guess death comes to all boards.</br></br>  <br>Lewd thread.</br>    If a new /a/ was made with better features, would you leave here or stay on both?  <br>Because he ships them, so his spoilers tend to also be littered with wishful thinking.</br>  <br>Wanko from Majikoi?</br>    <br> has been around a good while <br>Then why did you even bother pretending that naruto hate is new, you retarded faggot?<br><br> Naruto is a gateway anime of the worst kind. It's a bad series, a clusterfuck of story and characterization that isn't very well done by any aspect, but which attempts to compensate for its weaknesses by adding in excessive shipping faggotry and DARKNESS. The normal anon can see this as the shit it is, and may enjoy it, hate it or be indifferent to it, but all the while recognizing that the series itself, regardless of their opinion, is plain bad.<br> <br> However, these very aspects that try to smear over the shit of its core make it a breeding ground for aspie, unsociable underageb&amp; faggots who engage in every kind of faggotry both online and in the real world. The superpowered characters all trying their hardest to look cool, the jutsus, peculiar, colorful clothes, the whole ninja faggotry and everything about the Naruto world fuels their escapist fantasies, while the pity-party character backgrounds, emphasis on revenge, and overall preachiness of the series make it fit just right with the mary-sueish drives of your average preteen and his sense of unwarranted self-importance towards the world. Exactly the kind of shit that makes little kiddies and underageb&amp; retards eat this shit right the fuck up.<br> <br> Naruto is basically THE series to attract the most hated anime fanbase known to /a/, which is why, regardless of individual opinions, it is the responsibility of every anon to troll the fuck out of this show and everyone who likes it, and ensure that no Naruto threads ever encourage the newfriends to show their faces here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> neogaf <br><br>As if we needed more proof that Narutards are /v/ scum.</br></br></br>  Nice meta thread faggots.  <br>I hope fate is next.</br>  <br>Moot was an autocrat who didn't listen much; or rather didn't care much, which is what made him good for a site like this.<br><br>He wasn't completely impartial. He banned a lot of stuff, but he tried to at least keep everything on topic, eve if that meant the topic was some shitty shounen series.</br></br></br>  <br> newfag calling others newfags <br>It's like I'm on /b/</br></br>  <br>Try again later when the last chapter is released, we already had plenty of normal and peaceful Naruto threads without shitposting the last few weaks.</br>    <br>This.<br><br>If they truly want to ban Naruto threads, at least they have to put it in the rules.</br></br></br>  <br>He said the banner was new you reading comprehension-less faggot</br>  <br>I'd say it's a toss up between Yahari and Jojo for worst fanbase on /a/ right now.</br>  <br>If I were you I'd be more worried about being compared ot neogaf scum.</br>  <br>Because it is new, newfag.<br><br>The hate was more directed at Gaia during 2007, and Naruto was basically a scapegoat. If you were here then, you'd probably have noticed a lot of laughing AT Naruto, but not hate toward the readers.<br><br>The series had gone to shit thoroughly at that point, but many people on /a/ still read it. That should be obvious to you, newfag, if you were paying attention when the series was ending.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br> Try again later when the last chapter is released, we already had plenty of normal and peaceful Naruto threads without shitposting the last few weaks. <br>We can't fight mods. They could either delete threads or stick the trolls on us. I don't MIND if they actually DO want to ban Naruto; I have other forums. I just want them to have it listed on the rules section officially. But unofficial blocking? That's just low.</br></br>  <br>why advertise that shit here?</br>  <br> I hate other forums <br><br>Is there no limit to how cancerous Narutards can be?</br></br></br>  <br> Moot was impartial <br> neogaf comparison <br><br>Holy fuck, this is hilarious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, moot flat out allowed Naruto back in after years of banning that shit.<br><br> He knew that was one of the mistakes, that's why he bailed </br></br></br>  <br>It's not worth it to get upset over some shit posting retards. There will be another thread.</br>  <br>It never wasn't allowed</br>  <br>It's kind of been like this for Naruto for a while m8; you should've be surprised</br>  <br>Just keep making threads if you have things you want to discuss.<br><br>If it's deleted, make another.<br><br>If you're banned, something probably went wrong. As far as I know, there have been no bans. A mod spoke up today, but the frequent deletions-only is something of a Janitor's work.<br><br>I don't really care who it is. I don't tend to participate in these threads, it just annoys me that anything at all would get needlessly shut down.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not hate towards the readers <br> spammed to hell and back <br><br>Just give up already.<br><br><br>And that's irrelevant. The banner being up during the 2012 banner call is completely irrelevant given it was a popular copypasta for years beforehand.

It’s got a bit of post-battle aftermath, continues with the “Battle of Gods” arc where the God of Destruction Beerus appears and the “Revival of ‘F'” arc where Freeza comes back to life, and then, I’ve written a strange new story where they finally depart from this universe. They’re fighting against their neighbors, Universe 6! They’ll yell at me if I give away too many spoilers, so I’ll keep the rest a secret, but they’re chasing after giant Super Dragon Balls; I think things will unfold in a bright and simple way, that will be really fun and exciting! <br>Sounds to me like it will first make a connection between Z and BotG and then take on the new arc. I doutbt they'll revamp BotG and RoF like some anons were saying</br></br>  <br>I wonder how different Universe 6 will be to the main one</br>  <br>The way I read it, seems it takes place after the latest movie. "Continues the with the battle of gods arc".<br><br>Seeing them going to new universes is pretty awesome. I just want Uub to show up one day</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that's what I meant. Interconnect Z with BotG and then make the time skip to post RoF.<br> continuation of the Majin Buu story arc. It’s got a bit of post-battle aftermath, continues with the “Battle of Gods” arc where the God of Destruction Beerus appears and the “Revival of ‘F'” arc where Freeza comes back to life, and then, I’ve written a strange new story where they finally depart from this universe. </br></br>  FoG subs when  <br>In b4 a universe where every character is genderbent<br><br> girl goku </br></br></br>  I just realized a plot hole if Super is going to take place before the epilogue of DBZ.<br><br>In DBZ, Goku stated the main reason he decided to train Uub is so he could have such an incredibly powerful opponent to face. However, since the introduction of Gods of Destruction, there are tons of enemies stronger than Goku for him to fight.<br><br>So unless Goku becomes the strongest being in the entire multiverse within 10 years, the epilogue makes no sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br> They’re fighting against their neighbors, Universe 6 <br><br><br>what if uneverse 6 is gt universe</br></br></br></br>  <br>GIANT SUPER DRAGON BALLS<br><br>Maybe that 9-star ball on the V-Jump magazine manga adaptation wasn't a mistake!</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure Battle of Gods made it so Goku never meets Uub</br>  Wait so will it be starting straight after buus defeat or after RoF? I don't get it  <br>Uub appeared in the tournament 10 years after the events of Kid Buu. BoG doesn't take place nearly as long as that. His meeting with Uub hasn't been retconned.</br>  <br>If Uub is able to harness his potential, he might potentially be greater than any warrior we've seen yet. It remains to be seen. Also, Goku never explicitly stated that, it's just heavily implied.<br><br>Battle of Gods, Super, and Revival of F take place in the 10 years between Majin buu's defeat and the 25th Tenkaichi Budokai, where they meet Uub.</br></br></br>  <br>Both. They'll tackle Buu's aftermath first and then move to post RoF</br>  <br> an angry sexy Vegeta with a hard on for Goku </br>  <br>Would you?<br>Could you?<br>Should you?</br></br></br>  <br>it seems to be retconning both BoG and RoF into happening right after Buu's defeat, having arcs that completely retell the movies.<br><br>Makes you wonder what was the point of the movies, then.</br></br></br>  <br>I think the epilogue has officially been retconned now since it's stated that Goku hasn't seen anyone else since the Majin Buu incident</br>  <br> it seems to be retconning both BoG and RoF into happening right after Buu's defeat, having arcs that completely retell the movies. <br>What makes you think that?<br>The series will probably assume you have alredy watched both movies and after the post buu arc it will move to the 6th universe arc</br></br></br>  <br>Making money<br>Raise awareness for DB again<br>Making money</br></br></br>  <br>Only parts of it. Uub still happened.</br>  <br>  Hey Kakarot, after this battle how about you come back to my ship and I'll show you my Big Bang? </br>  <br>We'll still get Uub I think but it'll be tailored to fit into the new storyline</br>  <br>I wonder which universe is Future Trunk's.</br>  <br>Actually the epilogue stated it's been 5 years since he met everyone, which is what's covered by BoG. <br><br>Of course, that means he wouldn't be able to meet everyone in Super, which takes place directly afterwards. And that won't happen.</br></br></br>  <br> Would you? <br>yeah, a girl with the same personality as goku would be really cute<br> Could you? <br>idk maybe? i have a lot of energy but im just a human, not a saiyajin<br> Should you? <br>Probably no, but who cares? i would train and fight with her even if it cost me my life</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly. It'll happen in a similar way, but be altered a bit for the new movies. Pan and Bra will be there too, since Pan was in the last movie with Grunkle Piccolo.<br><br> Bra might end up as the strongest hybrid, thinking about it. Veggie has the God ki, and remember how much stronger Trunks got with Vegeta around? </br></br></br>  Ok so it will take place after buy saga before BotG? I hope they don't re-tell it. Love that movie so much, and what's the deal with this new universe? Are the events of BotG told differently in that universe? Will the 2nd arc take place after RoF? Someone explain this to me for I am stupid.  <br>Do you think you could keep Vegeta away from Goku?</br>  All the other universes being just alternate versions of them would be dumb and lazy.<br><br>Unfortunately that's exactly what i expect they will be.</br></br>  <br>Post-Buu<br><br>Timeskip<br><br>Multiverse<br><br>at least that's sort of what it sounds like to me<br><br>there better not be a mary sue version of Goku's mom thought up by the French in there</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>see   </br>  <br>there needs to be a variation where personalities are completely changed<br><br>like yamcha is an alpha that actually trains<br>vegeta is a complete pussy that only fights when he has to<br>piccolo is a goody two-shoes who is very open and friendly<br>goku is very affectionate and cares more about making love to chi chi than anything<br>frieza could be an ally in one of the universes<br><br>just a few random ideas</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> goku is very affectionate and cares more about making love to chi chi than anything <br>Goku and Chi-chi single-handedly repopulate the Saiyan race through their fuckin'</br></br>  <br>Only if she's fit, none of this turning a muscular dude into a small skinny waifu crap.</br>  I really dislike the idea of just slightly alternate versions of existing characters in the other universe. I'm ok with maybe some of the top level people such as the god of destruction and some of the kai's being similar looking, but not the regular denizens of the universe.  Okay, so from what I understand,<br> The two new movies are continuations of the manga and introduce the idea that there are 12 universes <br> Movies/manga universe is the seventh universe <br> Super (and maybe Kai) are the fifth universe <br> Super's first two arcs are retellings of the two movies with some differences like Champa <br> The third arc is a crossover battle with the sixth universe (notice they didn't specify what universe Super took place in, only that the sixth universe were their neighbors) <br><br>It opens the possibility of there being a GT universe, an Online universe, and other things like that where history plays out differently.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didnt really want them to go to a different universe but after Beerus mentioned thered be 12 universes I knew it was inevitable.</br>  <br> &gt;Super (and maybe Kai) are the fifth universe <br>Where was this confirmed</br></br>  <br>So it's after BotG? That doesn't make sense considering goku turns SSJ and not SSJGSS, and discovers Beerus for the 1st time in the trailer, unless it takes place in universe 6? Why is there another universe and why can't they just continue the story after RoF? What's the deal with this multiverse arc and are the characters in each universe meeting each other? Maybe after the events of this multiverse arc, the characters that represent their respective universe go their separate ways and then they continue the story after RoF which would mean RoF already happened, right? It would go like this I'm assuming.<br> After Buu <br> after BotG <br> After RoF <br> Zfighters discover new universe <br> see themselves, fat beerus blah blah <br> work together to fight evil threat <br> characters from universe 6 go back home  <br> they continue the story of the main timeline after that <br>Unless it takes place after BotG and before RoF which leads to all of this shit and THEN whis trains goku/vegeta. Then after that, the next arc takes place after RoF. This multiverse thing seems like filler to me, but I guess it could be fun. Am I close or just being retarded?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Super (and maybe Kai) are the fifth universe <br>What else is in your ass. Please keep taking stuff out of it, I want to see what else you can come up with</br></br>  <br>what if it's like, just the same kinds of races, but not characters?<br><br>like Saiyans are still around somewhere, but there's no Goku or Vegeta or anything, there's like, maybe some guy, who's sort of an asshole but not, named like, Artichoke<br><br>and there are Namekians, but no Piccolo or Guru or anyone, like maybe there's a dude named Mollus, who is a Super Namekian like Piccolo but talks and acts like some sort of bancho punk dude that flies around space getting into WACKY HIJINKS with his crew of oddball sidekicks<br><br>there are still Earthlings, but maybe they're not complete idiots? Also the champion of the Earth is like, a Luchador Cyborg Bear or something silly<br><br>fuck it, maybe the Tuffles are the race of heroes of the universe? Defeating the Arcosians or whatever Frieza's race was called and helping establish a peaceful galaxy. With space-hobbit science.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chapter 1 takes place only 6 months after Buu.<br><br>http://www.kanzenshuu.com/2015/07/0<wbr>1/dragon-ball-super-complete-showca<wbr>se-event-reveals-series-plot/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>You're just being retarded. Its gonna be <br> Z <br> post buu arc (Super) <br> Beerus arc (Battle of the Gods) <br> Golden Freeza arc (Return of F) <br> Rest of Super <br>Can't you guys even read? Or is that too hard?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does that mean after BotG?</br>  <br>if i was the son of the ox queen i totally would.<br><br>she promised me!</br></br></br>  <br>No, because BotG took place 4-5 years after Buu.<br><br>Yes, this means chapter 1 isnt consistent with BoG. Its Toriyama were talking about.</br></br></br>  <br>BotG is like 4 years after Buu</br>  <br>They aren't going to waste 2 fucking arcs re-doing the 2 movies. No one is that retarded.</br>  <br><br>I'm saying this because it doesn't fit in with Battle of Gods and Fukkatsu no "F". Beerus was asleep for 39 years at the start of BoG, which takes place in Age 778. That means he's been asleep since Age 739. Super takes place 6 months after the fight with Buu, meaning it's still in Age 774. Despite this, it shows Beerus awake, and recounting his dream about a Super Saiyan God. Champa and his attendant are also important characters early on in the story.<br><br>If the first arc of the story is the Battle of Gods arc, and the time frame is 6 months after Buu, then that means it's not just an extended retelling of Battle of Gods. It's most likely a different universe to the movies, which were said to be continuations of the manga.<br><br>I'm including Kai with Super only because Super is following Kai's broadcast and is meant to act as its successor/sequel.<br><br>Nowhere did they say that Super is the seventh universe. They only said that the sixth universe is the neighbor to Super's universe.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  Just think In on of the universes GT lays to be unlocked.  <br>I guess I'd be ok with that but I'd still like slightly different races, idk, I'd have to think about it.</br>  <br>Dammit. I didn't sit through two movies (which were great) just for them to give us a prequel series. Seriously what the fuck.</br>  <br>YES THEY ARE<br>READ THE GODDAMN ARTICLE<br>BATTLE OF GODS ARC<br>FUKKATSU NO "F" ARC<br>MULTIVERSE BATTLE ARC<br><br><br>I know it's Toriyama, but this seems like a rather huge oversight, even for him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never said that, stop putting words in my mouth and actually read the news article</br>  <br><br>If they just make Beerus wait around for 4 years for no particular reason they could still make it 99% the same as the movie.</br></br>  <br>Godku would win that no contest. Super Saiyan 4 is only as strong as Super Vegetto, Godku eclipses Super Saiyan 3 Vegetto.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127423522 <br>When the BD come out<br> tfw Im gonna go watch it tomorrow on my local cinema <br>Enjoy waiting anon</br></br></br>  <br>What if the dream Beerus talked about in the trailer is the entire BotG movie and the real events of the dream take place in the new series?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127423522 <br>Select theaters<br><br><br>Not to get into power level bullshit, but Super Saiyan God is equal to or better than Super Saiyan 4. There was that one article by Toriyama where he explains the working of the Super Saiyan transformations, and that Super Saiyan God basically draws out all latent Super Saiyan potential, removing the need for further transformations as they only serve to consume more energy. This means that Super Saiyan God is at least as strong as Super Saiyan 4 since the latter is just a further transformation. The only disadvantage Super Saiyan God has in comparison is the time limit, but Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan fixes that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That would both be incredibly dumb and incredibly brilliant at the same time.</br>  <br>Thanks for pointing out the obvious. You could of also just say God Goku wins because SSJ4 isn't canon.</br>  <br>Apparently the latest games (Xenoverse and the 3DS game) state that Super Cyan is indeed stronger than any other form, so that's official, if you want to believe it.</br>  <br> equal or better <br>The equal part is a huge exaggeration. That's like saying God Goku is weaker than Omega Shenron, and Omega Shenron is almost as strong if not equal to Beerus which is complete bullshit.</br></br>  <br>How much of a planet buster is godku anyway? For all we know he hasn't fully mastered and unlocked his new forms potential</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127423522 <br> watching subbed dbz </br>  <br>Its far less of a plot hole than Future Gohan being weaker than the Androids after THIRTEEN YEARS of straight fighting while main Gohan became stronger than Perfect Cell after just 1 year of training.</br>  <br>Future Gohan didn't get to train with his dad,that's the problem</br>  <br>you have to remember one important fact: gohan a shit</br>  <br>He does in RoF I believe<br><br>He wasnt stronger than cell because of his training. He just unlocked his inner hidden power that he wasnt capable of mastering throughout his childhood.</br></br></br>  <br>Its 13 years were talking about. In terms of DB training time that might as well be a million. 13 years is AFTER the end of the Buu saga. And he couldnt beat weakened versions of Androids in all that time even though he beat Cell? Yamcha could probably beat them with 13 years of training.</br>  <br>So super cyan goku is god forms full potential?</br>  <br>He was at least around equal with Cell without even going SSJ2.</br>  <br>But it's his dad. Goku knew what he had to do in order to make Gohan stronger. He knew what would bring out his full potential.</br>  <br>Vegeta became stronger than both the Androids just by ignoring Trunks and punching the air a lot.</br>  <br>Not even close. Cell threw him around like a rag doll. Gohan was far less powerful</br>  <br>Only because Gohan wasnt as into it. He was still obviously above the Androids at least.<br><br> defending plot holes <br><br>Just say Toriyama sucks at writing and be done with it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pardon my ignorance, but is "super cyan" what SSJGSS is called?</br>  H Y P E<br>Y<br>P<br>E<br><br>thats some major news right there. <br><br>please let people other than goku and vegeta shine that are NOT new characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I hope they do something with Uub. I want a human that's worth a damn.  <br> please let people other than goku and vegeta shine that are NOT new characters. <br><br>Id be fine with new characters being important if theyre well written. Because lets face it, nobody cares about Yamcha or Chaotzu and that just leaves Piccolo and the other Saiyans who are just less competent copies of Goku.</br></br></br>  <br> and vegeta <br>He never got his chance to shine. If anything, he deserves it more than anyone.</br></br>   yfw toriyama is literally ripping off Dragon Ball Multiverse   <br>I strongly doubt he's ever even heard of it.</br>  <br>I'd rather see Tien, Yamcha, Krillin and maybe even Roshi learn either Kaioken or have Elder Kai unlock their potential.. Or some other new kind of powerup but that might be even more asspulley</br>  <br>I say fuck em.</br>  <br>And completely pointless.<br><br>Wouldn't mind seeing Piccolo do something special since he's the most likeable character on the show.</br></br></br>  <br>no he did it just by screaming while trunks was freaking the fuck out<br><br>...i miss future trunks</br></br></br>  <br>Easily the coolest character in the series. He deserves his own arc</br>  <br>Yeah it's easier to say I guess</br>  <br>DRAGON BALL CONFIRMED UNIVERSE TIER</br>  <br> they’re chasing after giant Super Dragon Balls <br><br>Toriyama actually wrote this unironically.</br></br></br>  <br>They'd still be miles behind Goku and Vegeta for sure, but correct me if I'm wrong.. Humans/Namekians aren't able to go beyond their base forms power? Where as the different SSJ variants have ridiculous multipliers, to have non-saiyans keep up they gotta have something equivalent to those transformations</br>  <br>Theyre gonna wish Beerus and Whis dead.</br>  <br>Always fucking hated how gt/kid trunks hair never curves when he goes SSJ. It goes straight up and looks more like how he would look if he went SSJ2. Fucking love the curve.</br>  <br>Unless there's a super powerful namekian god piccolo can fuse with like kame and Naaaaaaaail</br>  How come they never split senzu beans in half? Seems like an easy way to heal someone useless without wasting a full bean.  <br>Why don't vegeta and goku beat eachother to near death and just have dende constantly heal them so they can be powerful enough to beat any enemy.</br>  <br>Because a power increase of 10,000 wouldnt do a lot against someone with a power level of a billion.<br><br>Vegeta tried it against Frieza and he still couldnt even touch him.</br></br></br>  <br>But they are now stronger, so the power boost would be way higher than that.</br>  <br>That's why I said constantly. If they did it for 6 months straight, imagine how powerful they'd be. They could easily increase their power level by 100k within 10 minutes.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure they did at some point. They just implied that it wont completely heal someone unless its a full bean.</br>  <br> Because a power increase of 10,000 <br> implying <br>Goku went from about 150k to several millions. It scales on your current level.</br></br></br>  <br>Blueper Cyan God</br>  Someone made a timeline image already  They aren't actually going to re-do BotG In show from right, guys? That beautiful scene where goku saves the earth from Beerus' blast, and then Beerus raises his arm making it look like he'a about to<br>Finish goku and chooses not to. such an amazing moment. What would be the point...</br>    <br>In show form*</br>  <br><br>Do you even read or watch this series?<br><br>There are no zenkai boosts after super saiyan.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Also, saiyans can breathe in space now ! </br>  <br>Was it ever stated that they couldn't?</br>  <br>Yes, actually.</br>  <br>In the latest movie Vegeta dies because the earth was destroyed and Frieza survived despite being much weaker than him because he can breathe in space.</br>  <br>Rabbits can live on the moon anyways.</br>  <br>Next time can you not spoil the movie. It's not exactly out here yet.</br>  <br>Goku uses instant transmission to travel throughout space so wouldn't he already have been able to breathe out there? Plus couldn't it be possible his God power allows him to be able to breathe in space also?</br>  <br>Wasn't it confiremd in BoG? Beerus said about other gods of destruction in different universes.<br>Get ready for 10 more series about universes and then movie about every universe untiing versus that boss of all gods of destruction.</br></br>  <br> Goku uses instant transmission to travel throughout space so wouldn't he already have been able to breathe out there? <br><br>When exactly did that occur ?</br></br></br>  <br>Definitely don't expect Gohan to be anything but Yamcha tier and the edginess being pretty much gone. It's gonna be Z Dragon Ball style.</br>  <br>Pretty much any time he goes to King Kai's planet, and even the supreme Kai planet after Buu blew up earth.</br>  <br>I guess God mode does help.</br>  <br>He instant transmissions through space all the time. Buu fight for example, he teleports himself and satan off planet before Buu blew up the earth.</br>  <br>Bardock did it too in the standoff against Frieza</br>  Just finished watching the latino camrip of RoF and I'm hyped as fuck for Super, at what tiime does it air in Japan on Sunday?  <br>Reminder that Broly will be the MC of Universe 6 and will have LSSG.</br>  <br> Broly <br>please no</br></br>  <br>Even though you're baiting, I don't hate the concept of a universe where brolu was never defeated and rampages throughout the universe. Always liked broly.</br>  <br>His fame outshines every other Movie villain, I wouldn't be surprised if he is more known that Beerus. He is always pushed in shit he shouldn't be in. I have seen several game covers where the only non canon character in them is Broly. Just look at the new 3DS game that is coming.</br>  <br>It doesn't mean that it's another dimension with counterparts you know. It's another universe with different characters, races etc.</br>  <br> A universe where Broly has achieved super cyan </br>  <br>No they can't, they never could they can just last longer than a human due to better lung capacity</br>  <br>Instant Transmission is literally teleporting, not actual movement. Its more like moving your body through another plane to get somewhere else really fast</br>  <br><br>What if Universe 6 is FemGokuverse</br></br>  Can anybody else believe how crazy it is this concept of a new series that not even Japan knows what is going to happen?<br><br>This has literally never happened with Dragonball. Every series, movie, OVA, etc. came to other countries much later than when they finished in Japan. All anybody had to do was see a magazine or get a piss yellow subtitled VHS. Even if they tried to guess what would happen, some guy could have that one Japanese friend and they tell them.<br><br>For once in its entire franchise's lifetime, literally everybody will be watching something Dragonball without another country knowing what happens down the line</br></br></br></br>  <br>he died because the fucking planet exploded, not because he couldn't breathe</br>  <br>How much Gohanfags tears can we expect?</br>  <br> i'm born in a time when I can watch any anime at the same time as japan <br> this also applies to dragonball <br> wow,so fucking crazy </br></br></br>  <br>Enough to fill a 10 gallon hat</br>  <br><br>Why do you fags always have to bring up gohan?<br><br>Hea a jobber now and will never ever be relevant again NEVER EVER!</br></br></br></br>  <br> Why do you fags always have to bring up gohan? <br>Because Gohanfags can't stop bringing him up although he's irrelevant as fuck.</br></br>  <br>Did you watch the movie? Frieza didnt die, and Beerus attributed that thats because can breath in space.</br>  <br>Gohan has been the absolute strongest several times in the past and will continue to overtake everyone else in this new series. Stay delusional vegetafag</br>  <br>So... Wait... What... Will the movies be chopped up and integrated as multipart episodes or will they tell stories that build up into each movie and then just be all "lol plz buy our bluray to see what happens!" and cut to post BotG/"F" arcs?</br>  <br> got rekt by first form freeza </br>  <br> Universe 6.3 </br>  Universe 6. They're all gonna fight their GT counterparts.  <br> fighting moustache leather pants vegeta <br>Oh god the horror</br></br>  <br>God please Toriyama  dont do this. Fat Beerus is lazy enough. </br>  <br> Stay delusional vegetafag </br>  <br>Uhh, okay?</br>  <br><br>Hey, if i had watched the movie yet i could cherry pick the part where Vegeta dies too.<br><br>Face it, Gohan is going to kick ass at one point or another in the new series.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That was part of Gohans strategy to let Friezas guard down and then Goku came and fucked it up.</br>  <br>So it's GT. Not too bad.</br>  <br> i could cherry pick the part where Vegeta dies too. <br>You mean when the earth gets exploded?</br></br>  <br> cherry pick <br>It's literally the only thing Gohan does in the movie<br>Unless you count him beating Nappa-tier soldiers as proof of him being strong</br></br></br>  <br> That was part of Gohans strategy  <br>Gohan please</br></br>  <br>My balls would go dragon</br>    <br>Its a sound strategy. Stay mad cunt</br>  <br>He was merely pretending<br>Just like Piccolo</br></br>  <br>this is GT all over again</br>  <br/>  Did Frieza call it "Earth's Hell" in the original Japanese audio of RoF too? Because it sounds like he's implying each planet has a different hell and the only reason he went there is because he died on Earth  What are Piccolo's shoes made of?  <br> NEVER EVER! <br>What's a /v/tard doing here crossboarding? GET OUT</br></br>  I haven't followed this since the first PV was announced. Has any new PV stuff come out?  <br><br><br>This meme is almost as bad ad gohan himself</br></br></br>  <br><br>I feel you.</br></br>  <br>Ummm all he does is get his ass kicked. He has 1 moment where he GOTTA GO FAST's some cannon fodder and then gets punched in the dick by first form Freeza</br>  <br><br><br>thanks doc</br></br></br>  <br><br>What Universe is Dragonball Evolution?</br></br>  is there a DB Super PV2 yet?  <br>PR? San Patricio?</br>  <br>Yes, a 30 sec PV and the first episode synopsis</br>   Mfw I watched Revival of F <br><br>Gotta say if Super DB is anything like the movie, then it's gonna be great</br></br>  <br>There's a 15 sec one and a 30 sec one<br><br>http://www.kanzenshuu.com/guides/ep<wbr>isode/super/30sec_preview.mp4</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>this one?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=coK<wbr>xF3ROa3c</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>thanks<br><br>ignore this</br></br></br>  It looks bad and the plot seeme built on making as many bullshit stuff you can think of without having to stay consistent.Release two movies and then rework them into a series with slight differences and call it a different universe how convenient. Besides the fact they're re-using Frieza and probably Cell too. Nothing about this seems good except maybe Slice-of-life adventures of Majin Buu  <br> Revival of F <br>Best movie with Fusion Reborn. Fun and crazy DB is best DB.</br></br>  <br> Implying BoG isn't the best movie <br><br><br> and call it a different universe <br>They're not calling the series a different universe, they are going to different universes as established in BoG. At least keep up with the information</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Revival of F <br> fun <br>when</br></br></br>  <br>BoG pacing is in the toilet most of the time.</br>  So Super's going to be 150+ episodes, right?  <br>Will Yamcha be competent in one of the universes?</br>  <br><br>Shit Verse</br></br>  Would they change Goku's jap voice since leldifferent universe?  <br>Where does Kid Buu stack up against Beerus in power. Beerus obviously smacked Mr. Buu around, but so did Kid Buu. It stands to reason that if Goku will eventually overcome Beerus in strength (which he in all likelihood will), Uub wouldn't really seem all that tough to him. <br><br>This is exciting though. The multiverse angle opens up all kinds of possibilities, like canon characters fighting non-canon characters like Broly or Omega Shenron. I wonder what happens if a Goku from one universe does a Fusion with a Goku from another.</br></br></br>   Fat Beerus <br>The mantitty game is strong</br>  <br>I think it's been said to be 100-200 episodes.</br>  <br>It's not set in a different universe. The final arc of Super has the characters travelling to Universe 6.</br>  <br> The final arc of Super has the characters travelling to Universe 6. <br> final arc </br></br>  <br>But she won't have anything hard down there.</br>  <br>I hope for no Namek.</br>  <br> namekians are now just the asari <br>I like this</br></br>  <br>Man I'm content where dbz ended I probably won't watch this</br>  <br>I expected Tori to completely forget the multiverse thing.<br>Bravo, maybe he isn't completely senile.</br></br>  <br>Something like this?</br>   inb4 a universe with humans having transformations <br><br> this picture was made in 2009. </br></br>  <br><br>Youre a terrible artist</br></br>  <br> implying that's mine <br><br>If I did draw it, I wouldn't have Videl in it.</br></br></br>   SSJ4 exists in another universe <br>  SSJ4 Goku fucks God Goku up </br>      So what's the name of this "female Whis" anyway?    <br>Other way around. Monkey Trouble can't even hope to come anywhere near God-tier.</br>  So can I watch Dragon Ball Super without "revival of f", or should wait for it? Can I watch it somewhere on internet, or not?  How the hell do you go to war with an entirely different universe?  <br>When your cat gods get in a shouting contest <br/></br>  So basically the first few episodes of Super will be SoL episodes after Buu, then a retelling of BotG and RoF for people who didn't watch the movies, and then jump into the Universe 6 arc?<br><br>Sounds good I guess I just hope it's not full on GT and all the new characters are fuck ugly alien shits</br></br>  <br>I don't know about SoL.The first chapter of the manga goes straight to Beerus by page 10.</br>  <br>But wasn't it announced that the first storyline would be goten getting Gohan a wedding gift?</br>  Reminder that Jheese did nothing wrong<br>Reminder that Jheese is the best Ginyu<br>Reminder that Jheese deserved better</br></br>  I wonder if the universes will be more unique or will we have an Infinite Crisis situation with alternate versions of the same characters.  <br>It's just an excuse to include  Red Cell </br>   female whis <br>YES<br> no female beerus <br>TORIYAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</br></br></br>  What would happen if Goku and Beerus fused?  <br><br>He'd be weaker than Vegito.</br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>If the Saiyans are still around, I foresee Vegeta getting into an ego match with this universe's Saiyan prince.</br>  <br>Can't wait to meet girl Goku.</br>  <br><br> genderbent whis <br>....muh dick</br></br></br>  <br> people keeps loving this shitty lazy designs </br>  <br> videl suddenly cant fly </br>  <br>Moeshit pandering.</br>  <br>you people will complain about ANYTHING<br><br>I bet you think Chi-chi and Bulma are flying in that poster too, and Goku and Vegeta are giants</br></br></br>  <br>Are you talkin' Potara? Cuz Beerus would have to be able to lower his powerlevel a shit ton while Goku was in his super saiyan god form.</br>  <br>Is think Gohan carrying Videl doesn't mean she can't fly anymore as much as she probably can't fly as fast or as well as Gohan.</br>  <br>impossible. Gohan can barely even go SS anymore.</br>  <br> expecting Toriyama to be this creatove </br>  <br> liking funnysexydragonball horrendous art </br>  <br> Gohan can barely even go SS anymore. <br>Absolutely hilarious.</br></br>  <br> implying every universe won't be just a variation of Beerus and Whis </br>  <br>if vegeta gets mad, he rapes godku and beerus easily</br>  <br>Yeah but he probably flies more often than he powers up to Super saiyan. Flying's probably 2nd nature to him like walking or taking a shit. Turning super saiyan is strictly a combat thing.</br>  <br><br> you now realize vegeta received gohans gimmick of being super strong when mad <br><br>how much harder can gohan be cucked?</br></br></br></br>  <br>it you mean "gets a few hits in and then gets slapped to the ground like the bitch he is" then yes</br>  <br>videl is gonna fuck universe 6 gohan<br>he's gonna get cucked by himself</br></br>  How did we go from this  to this?  <br>most girls enter bitch mode at her age</br>  <br>Universe 7 Gohan is fodder. Lets hope for gohan fans that universe 6 gohan is still a baddass.</br>  <br>puberty and the fact she is the grandaughter of the two most famous heroes on earth.</br>  <br>Goten please don't end up like Gohan</br>  Sorry to say, but DBZ started irredeemably sucking at the Cell saga. Dragonball is fantastic, the Freiza saga is decent, and even those few episodes that came out when Goku was out of the picture were good. But the only thing to happen past that point was the Trunks from the Future movie  <br> SS4GSS </br>  Predictions? <br><br> It won't be alternate universes like as far as a "new goku" or something like that.. but races could be the same <br> Whis' race are rulers of the multiverse, and are tyrants  <br> King of multiverse will be the final boss </br></br></br></br>  <br> they’re chasing after giant Super Dragon Balls <br>For what reason</br></br>  <br>Whis' race probably created purple space cats and maijins to be Satans for them</br>  <br>and majin buu is getting reabsorbed by the big bad guy triggering the SSGFSS3GF</br>  <br>You're forgetting the push-ups, sit-ups, and plenty of orange juice.</br>  <br>and in said universe, girl Goku brushes girl Raditz' hair like in that one image</br>  <br>I need it.</br>  <br> we will soon have DBS threads infested with fujos </br>  <br>I thought it was a popular image.<br><br>In said image, Goku and Raditz are drawn with K-on style faces and obviously they're little girls.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, they are going for the fujos<br><br>ib RoF goku needs to teleport with vegeta to go to the earth, and goku says something like<br><br> vegeta give me your hand <br> K-kakkarot i- don't wanna <br> if you don't do it bulma might get hurt <br> O-ok k-kakarot o-nly this time <br> then they hold hand in the gayest way possible <br><br>that was funny</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What if instead of jumping through time Trunks was jumping through universes.  <br>What if we don't.</br>  <br>that was literally what he was doing<br>they even explained it and demonstrate it more than once</br></br>  <br>Do they use a new teleportation technique?<br>Goku doesn't have to hold hands to instant transmission.<br>Sounds adorable though.</br></br></br>  I'm starting to realize this will be even worse than GT  <br>I need that webm.</br>  <br>Goku did that during the Saiyan saga. He only had one left so he gave Krillin and Gohan one half each.</br>  What's the biggest bullshit plot bandaid?<br> ZENKAI <br> senzu beans </br></br>  <br><br>Changing the way the Dragonballs work on a dime.<br><br> "Oh yeah I changed them to two wishes, was easy no problem" </br></br></br></br>   obligatory universe collide episode with Z, Super, and GT all teaming up to take down ancient evil   <br>Is this for real?<br>Oh wow!<br>Super Sayan God Super Sayan Gohan incoming</br></br></br>  I really hope Goku and Vegeta surpass Beerus/Whis by the end of Super. The child in me will not be satisfied until they are the most powerful beings in DB.  <br>probably they will fuck each other</br>  Will universe six be populated mostly by cute little girls?  <br>Heheh.</br>  <br> implying Toei acknowledges GT in 2015 </br>  <br>Really. Cuz the child in me won't be satisfied unless there's always someone stronger than Goku, since that was kind of the whole point of everything.</br>  <br> The child in me will not be satisfied until they are the most powerful beings in DB. <br><br>They were never really the most powerful past Freeza saga.</br></br></br>        <br>GT Pan is worst Pan.</br>      <br><br><br><br><br><br>Fucking DA makes this so shit with the cringe-worthy dialogue and terrible art.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Toei writers, that's how. Z Pan is if Goku was the little girl.<br><br>GT Pan is just one of many problems in GT.<br><br>Dragon Ball Online Pan was actually OK by all accounts, Martial Arts teacher.<br><br> Xenoverse GT Pan is lewd little girl. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How is Xenoverse any lewder than the show?</br>  <br>The worst crime of GT Pan was making me hate Videl's cute voice. She just sounded so shrill and irritating in that role</br>  <br>she wants you<br>blatantly<br> maybe even wants to hold hands </br></br></br>      <br> implying </br>  <br>actual quote</br>  <br><br><br><br>And yet even her lewd can't make her go super.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>To top this all off she will literally throw her clothes at you<br><br>as in she will give you her pants, or shirts, as a gift<br><br>then she'll start giving you her parents' clothes</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kid buu is weaker then super buu, he would get wrecked just as easy as fat buu<br><br>buuhan &gt; buff buu &gt; buutenks &gt; buucollo &gt; super buu &gt; kid buu &gt; majin buu &gt; grey buu &gt; mr buu</br></br></br>  <br>i'm still fucking waiting, dragon ball heroes</br>  Which universe is Evil Goku?  <br>But we already had that movie anon. He got blown up with a shrub.</br>  <br>Goku probably intends to teach Uub everything he knows and to make him far stronger than Kid Buu. If Uub inherited Buu's ability to instantly learn any technique then he would make a very good student.</br>  <br>pan realy is a slut</br>  <br>Plus like, fuck, if Freezie-pop could get so strong with only 4 months, imagine what someone with the potential of Majin Buu would be capable of</br>  <br>even if uub has the same potential as kid buu. he would still be limited by having a human body, no regeneration and perhaps his body can't even handle the power</br>  <br>I hope Gine would appear in this series.</br>  <br>Fuck yeah!</br>  <br>i hope Raditz is regenerated maybe with Nappa<br>and ends up with Launch</br></br>  <br>I don't know why people want Raditz back. He's not really stand out or interesting enough to be more than just "Oh hey this character exists". He's a set piece at most.</br>  Has there ever been a family that was this much of a fucking failiure?<br><br>Goku<br> abandoned his entire family to chase his brown skinned shota dreamboy <br> never actually won against Vegeta in a 1v1 fight <br> got his ass saved by others during the Cell and Buu fights <br><br>Gohan<br> a complete failiure of a Saiyan, ends up as a fucking bookworm, despite being stronger than Goku <br> the entire Buu saga could have been avoided if he didn't stop training like the lazy fuck he is <br> about everything he did in the Buu saga <br><br>Goten<br> literally gay <br> gets beaten up by Goku's grandchild, a 4 year old girl <br> probably ends up as a comedic relief in the new series <br><br>Being Chichi is suffering</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish Goten was literally gay. That would be so cute</br>  <br>you'd like that wouldn't you<br><br>you homo</br></br></br>  <br> the only Saiyan who actively chases after chicks <br> "literally gay" </br></br>  <br>Chichi is the reason why Gohan is a bookworm, so she is probably happy about it</br>  I know DBZ threads are frowned upon to an extent because some see it as casuals or /v/ type thread, but fuck all of you, i'm hyped for this. Sure, I won't enjoy it as much as I did years ago but i'll enjoy it nonetheless, and even better, it's 3/4 days from now.<br>I think it would be great if this series had a dimensional tournament like that one manga with a lot of "what if" universes coming together and fighting.</br>  <br> fusing with Trunks naked in a bathtub <br> not the most gay thing that someone can do </br></br>    <br><br> Goten  <br> not Super Gay 3 <br><br> just look at fucking Vegeta's face </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I have no mouth and I must scream. </br>  <br>Search "Raditz Goku moe"</br>  <br>Goku<br> Probably the strongest fighter on earth, or at least in the top 3. <br> While not making any moolah has made undeniably close ties with several of the richer people in the world including Mr. Satan and the Brief family. <br>Gohan<br> Became a high school scholar like he always dreamed. <br> Going out with a rich girl <br> Fights crime on a regular basis for kicks. <br> Still has limitless potential he can tap into even if he prefer's not to have to use it. <br>Goten<br> Can turn super saiyan at 8 (which is a year or so earlier than Gohan) <br> Quick learner just like his dad. <br> Had a date (that his dad made him blow off for training) <br> Can fuse into one of the strongest characters in the series. <br><br>The son family is just fine.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I hope Gohan actually trains for his power up in this Super series. Absolutely hated his Mystic form because of how he got it.<br><br>As for an alternate universe...Make it crazy Toriyama, make so we can't guess whats next. Don't make copy and paste character that are different genders or weight.</br></br>  <br>Me too.<br><br>If they went out of their way to make Adult Gotenks, the SSJ Pan is out of the question, it needs to happen.</br></br></br>  <br>cause for all intents and purposes i assumed Raditz lied about being Goku's brother just to get him to join him, <br>but the Gine manga arc says she actually cared about him and his whereabouts<br>Gine without Raditz (and Bardock) is fucking pointless<br><br><br>if and when DBZ epilogue is rewritten Trunks will say "Oh but i have a date with Mai" when asked to fight in the World Tournament</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It would be at least interesting.<br><br>He could be either Trunks sassy gay friend or being jealous of Mai and her relationship with Trunks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel like it would be a little redundant since this would be the second time he's let himself go and powered up.</br>  <br>Namekians will probably just be the same, or an all female race.</br>  Just make it a whole different universe, with alternative versions of every character.<br><br>We Dragon Steel Balls Run now.</br></br>  Will trunk's waifu be in the anime? That's all that matters.  <br> gohan becoming strong <br> letting himself become weak <br> becomes strong again <br>its kinda Gohan's shtick. unfortunately, if he follows his Buu saga self he'll be the strongest for a couple of episodes then fuck up and make the villain even stronger. <br><br>fingers crossed he and the other Z Fighters are at least usable in Super.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That would be a great change and make slightly less weird how the namekians can breed puking eggs.</br></br>  <br>Someone already did that.</br>  So is there a version of revival of f online yet or what?  <br> Actually encouraging homoshit <br>You're fucking disgusting. I bet you watch HxH you homoshitter.</br></br>  If dbz multiverse was adapted into an anime. That'd be great. <br>I hope they at least hold a tournament between these universes to see who is the strongest.</br>  So are they going to retell BOG and RoF in Super?  <br>Yes, and apparently they'll happen like 4 years earlier.</br>  <br>What are those floating orange spheres with stars on them? A new character's weapons?</br>  <br>The bait is real</br>  <br>You watch cartoons, you fucking queer.</br>  <br>Dragonball Xenoverse Quotes:<br>Beerus VS SS4 Goku:<br>B: "It's a bit different from your god form. What is that form?"<br>G: "It's Super Saiyan 4... Want me to show my power?"<br><br>Beerus VS SS4 Vegeta:<br>B: "You seem to have gotten much stronger, Vegeta. Maybe you can win now."<br>V: "Heh...hahaha! God of Destruction vs Super Saiyan 4. Exciting!"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I think they're called "Wyvern Marbles"</br>  <br> Wyvern Marbles? <br>『Steels Balls』 of course!<br><br><br>can't wait until super tho</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If Universe 6 is their neighbour, which universe are they? 5? 7?</br>  <br>What movie did you guys like better, Gods or F?</br>  <br><br>F was poo</br></br>  <br>Oh bother</br>  Who is best Dragon ball girl? Will they introduce any new qts?  <br>Android 18 is clearly the best, any other choice is wrong.</br>  <br>Not even the best cyborg.</br>  <br>only in mexican dub</br>   Universe 6 <br> possible alternate universe <br> could be GT <br>being one of the few people who actually enjoyed GT this excites me.</br></br></br>  <br>fem Whis &gt; 18 &gt; short hair Videl &gt; milf Bulma</br>  <br>What the fuck is going on in that pic?</br>  <br>They're pulling Goku's tail out.</br>  <br>Mai &gt; Arale &gt; short haired Videl &gt; Bulma pre-Z &gt; Ran-Fan &gt; the rest</br>    <br>Alternative universe shit would be way too convoluted. Though you might see Saiyans, Namekians, Maijins and Changelings.</br>  <br>I can never decide between 18 and Videl, they're both so cute</br>  <br> could be GT <br>It's not GT.<br><br>Toei is never going to acknowledge G</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Damn, female majins are very hot</br></br>  <br><br>There isn't enough hentai of them.</br></br>  <br> high school scholar <br> high school <br> scholar <br>you fucking what m8</br></br></br></br>  <br>Future Gohan didn't have a training partner, or any sort of significant training that would increase his power.<br><br>There's a reason Future Trunks wasn't able to beat the Androids before.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br><br>I would say that fighting to death with the androids as often as he did and for so many years and in handicap 2 VS 1 matches to boot should've been just as good as having a training partners. Also, that should've triggered a fuckton of zenkai boosts given how close he was to dying several times.<br><br>What's more, given the deaths he witnessed from people close to him and emotional pressure he lived, he should've been able to trigger super saiyan 2 as well.</br></br></br></br>  Isn't the Zenkai thing only applicable to pure-blooded Saiyans?<br><br>I'm mentioning this because Gohan and other halfs never actually did in the show. Hell, Gohan got his neck broken on Namek but he didn't really get any stronger afterwards</br></br>   wanting characters like Gohan and Piccolo to be a competent characters instead of the new yamcha makes me a "gohanfag" <br> people go out of their way to defend gohan jobbing an piccolo getting beaten up by fucking freeza grunts <br> they've literally had a better showing in GT than all of the new material. <br><br>Was I a fan of this series of this long, for THIS? Is this what the fanbase has always been like or is this the new wave? I feel like I'm being punished for trying to enjoy the "wrong" charaters</br></br></br></br>  <br> piccolo <br> better showing in GT <br>was he dead through...all of it?<br><br>but yeah with Gohan...Not sure how he can be Mystic in BOG but not be able to even go super saiyan in ROF since its only a year between the two movies.  yet there was a 7 year gap between Cell and Buu and Gohan never lost the ability to go Super Saiyan 2 </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they've literally had a better showing in GT than all of the new material. <br>Have they? Cause I really don't think so<br><br>I mean, I guess Piccolo did by dying but all Gohan did was get bodyjacked and then lose every time afterwards.<br><br>I think it's just that everybody is resigned to the fate of the Dragonball cast but I think Toriyama will try to give more characters a better showing at least a little bit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> becoming the guardian of hell <br> kicking Freeza and Cell's ass on daily basis <br><br>Piccolo was living his dream.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this Toriyama art?</br>  <br><br>Getting a hot majin girlfriend looks like it would be easy, just give them candy and they will be like putty in your hands</br></br>  ScrewAttack is doing Goku vs Superman rematch...  <br> Goku vs Universe 6 Goku <br>Might be cool.</br></br>  <br>It's porn, anon.</br>  <br>ugh....why?</br>  <br>Did they even watch the movie?</br>  <br>What the fuck?</br>  <br>Because they know what generates viewers.</br>  <br>superman still being the strongest there is no need for a rematch</br>  <br> I don't know how Ki Durability works. </br>  <br>1. They know anime gets more viewers<br>2. They hate anime</br></br>  <br>Why do they hate anime?</br>  <br><br>I think it was brought up when they were getting healed by dende after getting beat up by frieza.</br></br>  <br>Don't make excuses for this bullshit.</br>  Guys, nobody is asking the big question!<br><br>JACO WHEN?<br><br><br>That's explicitly not Zenkai and I think that was Vegeta who brought it up</br></br></br></br></br>  Oh NOW you decide to start really advertising  <br> JACO WHEN <br>Yes this. where my favorite Super Elite?</br></br>  <br>Gohan went from nearly getting killed by Recoome to snapping and actually doing something against Second Form Frieza and later (after another heal I think) Third form Frieza.<br><br>So yeah, he has it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Was in RoF.</br></br>  <br>It's fucking dragon ball, it doesn't need advertising.</br>  <br>That could be chalked up to his hidden potential, something that was implied from his very first appearance.</br>  <br> Excuses <br> Shown with the Ginyu Force fight <br> Pretty much how Goku trains for the Cell fight <br> Literally lampshaded at the beginning of the movie just in case anyone forgot. <br> Excuses </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Red haired Goku.</br></br>  <br>Both times against Freeza that was him going rage-mode potential unlock that he had been doing all series<br><br><br>I meant in Super</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope. Saiyan boost. Vegeta even lampshades it.</br>  <br><br><br>oh yeah , now that toriyama is getting all his charaters into the same place <br><br>do you think we could get the guys from sandland and kajika in universe 6</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Captain Ginyu enjoying new life as a frog </br>  <br> &gt;Shown with the Ginyu Force fight <br> &gt;Pretty much how Goku trains for the Cell fight <br>1) There's a difference between Ginyu harming himself and that<br>2) You're literally making shit up.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If Cell could benefit from it despite he's like only 20% saiyan, surely a hybrid like Gohan can.</br></br>  <br>That's not what I am talking about. I'm talking about Goku's scouter reading in being just 5000 when he showed up to fight Recoome. That's how low he keeps his power when not actually using it. <br><br>He trained so he could do the same in SSJ form during the Cell Saga. Keep the power low while keeping the super form up.<br><br>Goku trains so his power is damn low and he is able to use it all in an instant at the time of striking or guarding. That's been his style for a long ass time. <br><br>That's why he is so damn vulnerable when caught by surprise.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Do you think tights will make it into Super? I mean she's Bulma's sister. It's kinda weird that we haven't met her until now. I guess she's out doin' space research.   Probably woulda helped them get to namek but I guess Bulma can't help forgetting about her only sister  </br></br>  <br> That's why he is so damn vulnerable when caught by surprise. <br>There have been plenty of moments in Dragonball when he was caught by surprise without being prepare for a fight and it doesn't kill him. There's a part in Dragonball, where Goku gets hit by a fucking sniper and the bullet bounces off his face.<br><br>Goku was at a power level that even if he wasn't ready for it, he shouldn't have been hurt that badly. It would have been much better if Sorbet had distracted him and then Freeza shot him than the other way around.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Coming up with excuses for bad writing is what fanboys do best.</br>  <br>The moment you list is from before he learns to ki control.</br>  <br>what is Sand Land about? is it good?</br>  <br> Krillin made a move that outright ignores ki power <br> think someone else can't make a beam that does the same shit <br><br> inb4 Cell filler </br></br></br></br>  <br>Krillin really does come up with some neat tricks. <br><br>Shame he never learns Frieza's remote control variant... or gets to hit anyone with it.</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, Krillin cutting people to pieces doesn't really suit him.</br>  <br>Because that worked SO well for Frieza.</br>  <br>testing waters you doofus, even toriyama said if BoG and another movied had sucess, toei would do another series</br>    <br>it's a one shot manga made by toriyama <br><br>it takes place in a distant future wer various natural disasters destroyed most of the earth, and now the earth is a big desert<br><br>i don't want to spoil the adventure it's the story of Beelzebub(the demon prince), Thief, and Rao(a retired human genereal). they are searching for an oasis that the demons and the humans can share <br><br>also Beelzebub's father looks a lot like dabura for some reason<br><br>you should read it it's just a nice little adventure</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's just because Freeza can't sense ki.</br>  <br>So you're arguing that Goku with Ki Control can make himself WEAKER than he normally is when he's caught by surprise<br><br>Fuck you! You can't be reaching this so fucking hard that you're going to say that Sorbet manage to invent some beam that can cut through anything!</br></br></br>  <br>Wow, you seem salty, dude. He was on-point about the Kienzan comparison, though. If the manlet can do that, it's not much of a stretch for ~SPACE TECHNOLOGY~ to do the same.</br>  <br> Fuck you! You can't be reaching this so fucking hard that you're going to say that Sorbet manage to invent some beam that can cut through anything! <br><br> invent <br><br>It's not even fucking hard, Krillin, Goku, Vegeta, Freeza, and 18 can all do it. <br><br>Piccolo and Cell also made such a beam.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> toei ignores GT <br> Shows up in pretty much every game <br>the only thing i think GT doesn't show up in is Toys.</br></br></br>  god damn GT is boring. So Dr. Mu and Baby are just rehashes of Dr. Gero and Cell?  <br>If they can then why didn't they use it in crucial fights?</br>  <br>whis actually explain why that happens</br>  <br>Basically Dragon Ball Multiverse</br>  Since the other thread got derailed by dubposters and the mods are not doing their job preventing that  and coolest janitor deleted threads for no reason but his personal vendetta which results in even more Naruto threads , let's try to have a peaceful discussion in this one. <br><br>Spoilers so far:<br> <br>- Colour-Page of the Uchiha family with a smiling Sarada<br>- Sakura is the mother<br>- Shin clones live with Kabuto and his "brother" in the orphanage<br>- Sasuke does the forehead poke on Sarada<br>- Choji gets thin again and Chocho is surprised<br>- Karin talks to Suigetsu about the cord he found, which is Saradas<br>- movie villains dont appear at all<br>- we dont get to see how Sarada was born</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br>  Why are you guys making more than one thread?   nuruto thread   So I don't understand - why does Karin have the umbilical cord if Sakura is the mother? Why the secrecy? I know Kishi a shit but this is worse then normal.  <br>Because they keep getting spammed.</br>  <br>Because you touch yourself at night.<br><br><br>I know what you mean, but it's over, man. Time to pack it in. All that's left now is to wait for the scans.</br></br></br></br>  Is she the best or what?  <br>Fan service but also fucking over Lelouch so that when the rest of the Black Knights betray him he's all alone.</br>  <br> off by one  <br><br>What are you doing, Naruto-kun?</br></br></br>  <br><br>SASUKE</br></br>  <br><br>NARUTO</br></br>  <br>i still prefer Kallen<br>C.C is ok</br></br>  Friendly reminder that KyoAni will never top this.<br><br> Inb4 what a snoozefest. </br></br>  Haruhi is better.  <br>Hyouka wasn't generic at all. It wasn't boring because it was "another moe show". It was boring because the characters literally did nothing but talk about mysteries the audience couldn't participate for 20 whole minutes. It was bad because even though the characters and visuals were interesting, the situations weren't.<br>It was a boring school life simulator.</br></br>  <br>You weren't supposed to watch it for the mysteries.</br>  <br>the SOL was also fucking boring too</br>  <br>It's not the show's fault you went in expecting it to be something it wasn't. <br>I've said this a million times to faggots like you who didn't understand what it was about but I'll say it again. It was about Oreki's character development, it was NOT a mystery show. <br>The mysteries were simply the setting and a catalyst for said development to take place in. By the end of the show he's a lot different from how he was at the beginning.<br><br>Honestly, just give it another try with this in mind. Don't go expecting super interesting mysteries because it just isn't about that.</br></br></br></br></br>  Whos Den Den mushi is that?<br>How will fujitora deal with the arrest of Doflamingo and the rest of the pirates?</br>  <br>that zoro is pretty cool <br><br>get out faggot</br></br></br>  <br>Dat Zoro looks neat tbh</br>    <br>R.I.P Donquixote "the jew coyote" Doflamingo</br>  <br>I think you've been on /a/ too long, kid.</br>  Erika sure is sneaky.  <br>MUH DICK</br>  <br>Everyone knows Maho is the superior garupan.</br>  <br><br>Chick on the left has some delicious panzers I know that.</br></br>  Maho all day every day.
