[ Starting in 3 or so hours, the episode may be delayed up to 15 minutes because sportsball <br> https://twitter.com/GANGSTA_Projec<wbr>t/status/616173641114349568</wbr> <br><br>This is the first show Manglobe has done since SamFlam, will they deliver with some nice animation this time?</br></br></br>  <br>Are you ready for worst anime of the season?</br>  <br>What is this anime about?</br>  Lets do it<br>Its MANIME time unironically</br>  <br>Fujoshi's Black Lagoon <br><br> MANIME <br> it looks like gay dudes drawn by homoerotic pixiv fanartists females <br>ok</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OSr<wbr>DLzd4viA</wbr>  [ ]<br>looks shit and that OST <br>disgusting</br></br></br>  <br>Post apocalyptic shithole of the world where demihuman mutant guys and normal guys coexist. Main characters are a normie human and a mutant doing odd jobs which usually involve killing people for cops and cartels. <br>They save a hooker early on and start to hang out with her, have totally got tragic backstories, there's racism and demihuman hunting.<br><br>Pretty standard crap world setup all in all, but I like it.</br></br></br></br>  I'm ready to wait for a bearable fansub, I'm not going watch funishit.  <br> it looks like gay dudes drawn by homoerotic pixiv fanartists females <br><br>Still makes it less gay than moeshit</br></br></br>  <br> moeshit <br><br>And here we go, the threads will be shit no matter how good the anime is, attracting all the crossboarder shitposters.</br></br></br>  <br>There is zero faggotry in it. <br><br>Sorry you're too effeminate to be able to enjoy it.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, you have a point. I'm not saying its gonna be bad either, but its pretty obvious they're aiming for that audience</br>  <br>I think its more like you not having knowledge of what I'm talking about.</br>  <br> the threads will be shit no matter how good the anime is <br><br>I really doubt it, it wont get more than 50 unique posters</br></br></br>  <br>I've read the manga. It's indeed drawn by a woman, but fujoshit pandering is non-existent.</br>  <br> but its pretty obvious they're aiming for that audience <br><br>The seinen audience? That's the demographic of the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>The story is also done by the same woman. And since a woman is writing the material, it's shit.</br>  Does it have jazz? Seems like a muh jazz, muh class show.  <br>see </br>  <br> trying so hard to make your b8 work <br>wow anon, upvote</br></br>  <br>We'll see how it is shortly anyway. if its not fujoshit, well good for us.<br><br>That looks as seinen as Shirow Miwa's Dogs.<br>not much<br><br><br><br>stop shitposting</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  Save the shitposting for the GATE threads.  <br> GATE <br>fuck you for reminding me that it exists</br></br>  gangstfags being this butthurt  <br> Miwa's Dogs <br>It might as well be Dogs. Feels like it's set in the same world and written in a very similar style and with same themes.</br></br>  <br>who are you quoting?</br>  <br>I don't see any quotation.</br>  <br>I wonder what's the approprite name of this subgenre, that was so common in the early 2000</br>  <br> using moeshit <br>Well, looks like this anime attracting stupid crossboarders and plebs, huh. This anon is right</br></br>  <br>The question is, why this show in particular.</br>  <br> anyone who hates moeshit is a s-s-stupid! ;_; <br><br>Get over yourself cunt</br></br></br>  Hibike Euphonium is better than this shit  <br>newfag detected</br>  <br>There is always one show, gangsta has the pleasure of being of the first to air in the season, so obviously shitposters will latch to the threads.</br>  <br>It's obvious because it looks like a mature manime for mature men like myself.</br>  <br> unironically saying moeshit  <br>Just end yourself.</br></br>  heard of the manga but backlog stopped me from reading it<br><br>I'm interested to see gangsters doing crime/mob enforcing type shit with hopefully good characters and story and if it is like black lagoon holy shit I'm down</br></br>  <br>First to air doesn't mean it attracts shitposters, it just means it's the show that most people watch. <br><br>You're a crossboarder and don't belong here.<br><br>Maybe if you lurk more instead of shitposting you'll find out why.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because it has a meme name and also it attracts all the "I love action anime fuck all high school setting" tards</br>  hah, is this the catch basin of moeshit haters?  <br> moeshit <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br> anyone who doesnt gobble up shitty anime is a crossboarder </br>  <br>I know, but this really doesn't fit the quota of bully target of the season. its a pretty damn small production<br><br>that might be true actually.<br>well whatever, shitposting is just going to make threads a lot more hilarious. we just have to wait midseason to have normal conversations</br></br></br></br>  <br> doesn't even know what moe means <br>As expected of a crossboarder.<br>Go back to your shithole.</br></br></br>  Reminder the source material is terrible and its nothing like Black lagoon like most crossboarders ITT hope it is.  <br>Nah, I don't mean that, but from my experience, people who like moeshit are tend to be more tolerant to manime compared to people that only watch manime and then complained that "why people love those stupid otaku pandering garbage &gt;:("<br>And you are the example of what I'm talking about.</br></br>  <br> If you don't like garbage cliche HS setting , you're a retard <br>Fuck off</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127433224 <br/>  <br>Remember to hide and report.</br>  Shitposting general?<br>Either the fans are genuinely retarded crossboarders or people are just shitposting for the fun of it, anyway there won't be any decent discussion.</br>  Disgusting crossboarding spoiled faggot here. Is there some quality live streaming used around here like in /sp/ or should I just wait for a torrent?  <br>You're wrong, actually<br>You look at Euphotards shitting on Kekkai</br></br>  <br>its more like akame ga kil</br>  <br> people who like moeshit are tend to be more tolerant to manime compared to people that only watch manime  <br><br> faggots literally crying because MUH CROSSBOARDERS <br> tolerant <br><br>Ok</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Anyone who doesn't like boring crap must be from /v/ <br>Since whe was this board's name "moe"? It isn't, so hating moeshit is allowed, faggot</br></br>  <br>Tolerant toward anime not the fans, you are just fucking shitposting about moeshit instead of enjoying all kinds of anime because you are so fucking mature and manly.</br>  <br>only crossboader using the Term moeshit  piece of shit</br>  <br>who gives a shit if they are tolerant towards the anime?<br><br>They are telling people to leave /a/ if they dont like moeshit like themselves</br></br></br>  You guys are ruining the threads and it's not even aired, Fuck you.  well all the shitposting aside what are your guy's expectations?  <br>So what if it's allowed, still makes you look fucking retarded when you try to insult things you don't even know the meaning of or can't even properly define.</br>  <br>You're the most cancerous tripfaggot in this board. You don't get to complain about anything.</br>  <br>UFOers have been assholes about Kekkai Sensen.</br>    <br> tripfags complaining <br><br>Nobody cares faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>It's been a back and forth shitposting war, most of it simply because it's kyoani. Not like it matters anymore leave that shit in spring.</br>  <br>I've only been on /a/ and /m/<br>Sorry to destroy your boogeyman delusions<br><br>Define it yourself, then<br>If you refuse to answer and tell me to lurk more, I'll just think that you're dodging the question because you can't define it better than CGDCT SOLcrap, which Kyoanus excels at making (but they aren't the only studio doing that crap)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kekkai Sensen <br>disjointed mess with bad characterization</br></br>  How are you guys watching this?  <br>There is no objective definition you fucking retard, that's the point, these fucking newfags.</br>  <br>Kekkai actually hasn't ended yet. Bones don't know when they'll air the last episode because it will be longer than usual</br>  <br>On my monitor</br>  <br>With my eyes</br>  What a nice thread. REALLY, what a nice thread.  <br>Then why was that guy acting like there was?</br>  <br>Drunk</br>  Who cares, if it's being simulcasted by funi?  <br>Coming here to shitpost every few minutes most likely.</br>  <br> disjointed mess <br>Eh, yeah.<br><br> bad characterization <br>Bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br>   Show might attract normies <br> Endless shitposting so that no one can enjoy it <br><br>Let me FUCKING enjoy my overrated seinin show, PLEASE.</br></br></br>  <br>Who cares about that shit?<br>If I want to wacth a show, "muh subs" isn't gonna stop me.<br>The only way bad subs stop me from watching a show is if they're shitty HK DVD subs</br></br></br>  is there a livestream going up?  <br>Fuck off Michiru we can't let the normalfags get used to coming here and spreading cancer.</br>  <br>Just wait for the comfy CR/HS threads (4 days later)</br>  <br>I'm on your side, m8. But this reply is not helping your argument at all. You only make him feel superior by implying that "Ha! this moefag can't even give proper explanation about what moe is!"</br>  <br>Because you're dumb<br>That, or you're one of those insufferable intellectuals who want everything to be "intelligent" (AKA: boring phylosophical bullshit)</br></br>  <br>You need to get some taste or get the fuck off my /a/.</br>  <br>it's more shit then?</br>  <br>Crunchyroll's doing it too?</br>  <br> not having standards <br><br>This is the reason why Funi gets all the shows, people like you who don't give a shit about anything.</br></br></br>  <br>CR isn't streaming in English , retard<br>Funi has exclusive rights to that<br>So HS is gonna be ripping Funi</br></br></br>  <br>Yes (4 days later)</br>  <br>Geez, even normalfags know about grisaia because is on steam now</br>  <br>You can watch anime on steam now?</br>  <br>I doubt people like me who don't even visit their site influence Funi in any way<br>I haven't paid for a Funi product in my life. So how do I cause Funi to think that they should get more shows?<br>I'm interested in hearing your logic</br></br></br>  <br>The first VN is on steam.<br>And totally censored (so amane's route doesnt have any sense)</br></br>  <br>I don't see it http://www.crunchyroll.com/lineup</br>  <br>I only see TBDs.</br>  <br>That's for non-English CR.</br>  <br>The Grisaia VN is on Steam (with the sex scenes removed, of course. Can't have them on our christian digital store)</br>  <br>If someone told the normies where to watch the fucking anime then they wouldn't be here spamming IS THERE A LIVESTREAM WHERE ARE YOU GUYS WATCHING THIS they could probably all fuck off and the shitposters could leave too.<br><br>To be fair though there's no fucking way anyone outside of /a/ knows who's airing this shit</br></br></br>  <br>But normalfags need to understand that us moefriends can enjoy generic slice of life shows as well as generic tryhard shows. I want to have fun discussing this show with you guys, but the vitriol to anything positive posted about these shows are too much.<br><br>Can't we just have a light touch of shitposting when there are posts saying shit like "Well, at least it isn't MOESHIT, so it's aots."</br></br></br>  <br>Without subs in languages that aren't english, retard<br>Learn to read Fansubdb</br></br>  <br>Shit, from the Catalog thumbnail I thought it's Rock and Balalaika after a rough night.</br>  <br>They have Jitsu wa Watashi wa and a couple others. All I could find about Gangsta and CR was French simulcasting.</br>  <br>The problem with you moefags is you pretending that your shit is AOTS, or that people are inferior for not watching your shit</br>  <br>How can you act so superior when you don't even have a semblance of understand of one of the key words in anime?<br><br>The fact you're using a word you don't know the meaning of and then adding 'shit' to the end of it is laughable.<br>Learn to use google you shit eater.</br></br></br></br>  I can't even watch anime because I have to shitpost too much, fuck you /a/.  Reminder to change your color output range to 16-25 if you watch funishit and want to be able to see anything.  <br>*With</br>  <br> splitting up people into moe and non-moe <br>Retarded generalization that doesn't exist since moe isn't even a genre..</br></br>  I'm retarded where the fuck do I go to watch this anime  <br>*16-235</br>  <br>To Japan.</br>  <br>Hoping for someone else to pick this show up.</br>   this thread <br>Oh man. I hope you can weather the storm Gangstafags.<br>This is the first show to air for Summer  aside from that ecchi short  so it's only natural that you're going take the brunt of the start of the season shitposting.</br></br>  <br>Horriblesubs leader said that if you update cccp you won't have color problems with funirips anymore.</br>  <br>Shit. Not coming to NA besides fansubs then?</br>  <br>I understand it. <br>It means "cute girl you want to protect" or at least , I use moeshit to refer to shows that have said moe girls as their only appeal. like everything that Kyoanus does</br></br>  <br>Or you could just not watch funishit.<br>Besides that, if you're watching funi from Horriblesubs, you apparently won't need to do that anymore. It'll still look like shit, even with fixed colors though.<br>https://twitter.com/HorribleSubs/st<wbr>atus/616012139237478400<br>https://twitter.com/HorribleSubs/st<wbr>atus/616012329256226816</wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off summer</br>  <br> It'll still look like shit, even with fixed colors though. <br>why is that</br></br>  <br> phylosophical </br>  <br>I will once I find out where to watch this fucking anime. I'd lurk until I found it but you retards are too busy fighting over bullshit instead of talking about the fucking anime.</br>  <br>It's just a dystopia that's mixing some popular tropes.</br>  <br><br>Oh right. I forgot Okusama was airing today as well.</br></br>  <br>Come on in a series as over the top creative and gorgeous as kekkai sensen you pick that tame image, why not one of those amazing creature designs over the god tier backgrounds</br>  <br>If Funishit is the only choice, it's better than nothing. That. and it's faster. And anyone who isn't an autist about "muh video quality" and "muh subs quality" shouldn't care about it, anyway. <br>Way better than waiting ages for fansubs</br></br>  <br>"moe" is the feeling of affection towards anything.<br><br>It varies from person to person but anything can be moe, a mecha can be moe.<br><br>The term you're looking for is CGDCT</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here is a free tip, lurk the archive not the board.</br>  <br> The problem with you moefags is you pretending that your shit is AOTS <br>So? People also pretending that their favorite shows are AOTS. Some people say this anime is AOTS even before it's airing.<br> people are inferior for not watching your shit <br>Really? From my experience in /tv/, people also look down on those who watch "otaku pandering moeshit garbage", m8.<br><br>See? Every side have their cancer.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> girl <br>You're wrong there.<br><br>And stop using a crossboarding term, because it means nothing at all. CGDCT is the term you want you raging faggot</br></br></br></br>  http://www.funimation.com/shows/gan<wbr>gsta/home<br><br>Is this where I go to watch this?</br></br></wbr>  <br>It seems I made a typo, sorry</br>    Comparing Gangsta to Akame Ga Kill <br><br>Are some people completely stupid? Gangsta is noting like Akame. And please dont bring in muh edge because many shows have that even Black Lagoon.</br></br>   this entire thread <br>holy shit, god save us should the show actually air</br>  <br>Are you false flagging to the max to make this show look like it attracts retards?<br><br><br>The manga is still mediocre as hell though, and you have manglobe adapting it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's fine /a/nons are having fun shitposting and the actual manime fans can fuck off because they can't discuss anything.</br>  <br>yes it is gangstafag</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>You go to horriblesubs.info, and wait for it to be released there. <br>You need a monthly subscription to watch shit on Funimation</br></br>  <br>It's nothing like Black Lagoon and Akame in that it's edgy without being enjoyable. And the art is terrible, the characters are aggressively unlikeable, it's just plain shit.</br>  <br>No I am an actual retard who is watching a brand-new anime for the first time<br><br>Thanks mate. I'll get out of your hair now</br></br></br>  <br>Low bitrate, bad compression, etc.<br><br>Hell, even converting the colors doesn't correct the loss in information that the stream has. For example, in dark scenes where you can't see shit, even fixing the colors doesn't fix that. When the visual information is distorted, it's gone.</br></br></br>  We g/a/ngstas now  <br>Gangland whores and super-soldiers.</br>  <br>I'd rather wait for a properly prepared meal rather than just have all the ingredients thrown in a blender and have the sludge microwaved.<br><br>Funi is worse than nothing.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah fuck off with your shittaste. Gangsta is much more enjoyable than that shit called Akame faggot. Also I enjoy both Black Lagoon and Gangsta the same.</br>  <br>Holy fuck, go to Horriblesubs and wait for them to rip the Funimation video. It's better than paying those faggots for their shit</br>  <br>Remember, don't spend too much in Gangsta thread when it airs. The shitposting in the thread maybe leave a bad taste in your mind and make you less enjoying this show.</br>  Im here to complain about the heroine being a literal slut    Here we go with the shitposting again. Seriously if Gangsta is getting this much shitposting I can't imagine Gate, Prison School, Charlotte, MonMonsume, and Jitsu.  <br>Sorry, but your argument doesn't hold water unless you're talking about HK DVD subs, and not Funi<br>Funi's fine when there's nothing else better. And if you're an impatient asshole who hates waiting, like I am</br></br>  <br>black lagoon &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; akame ga kill &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shit &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gangsta</br>  <br> forgetting about God Eater because muh Ufotable </br>  Why are there so few animes that use the mafia theme and don't inject the world full of supernatural elements?<br><br>I just want some realistic-ish mafia settings.</br></br>  <br>Why are you on /a/ if you're that much of an impatient piece of shit? There are plenty of other sites who all they care about are getting the anime in whatever form they can.<br><br>If funi doesn't look terrible to you, you need to get your eyes checked. Their subs are worse than piss-yellow DVD subs, because at least those have some sense to where the subs are placed.</br></br></br>  Are there really people who still watch FUNishit turds?  <br>there's a bunch of supersoilders who are alot more powerful than normal humans, but for some faggot ass reason they're being discriminated against and getting slaughered by normal humans becasue the fucking author can't get into fucking logic. But one day, a bunch of extremely edgy faggots appear and start fighting with the superhumans. Yea really thats fucking it.</br>  <br>Wait a minute. Are you implying this is going to have supernatural shit?<br><br>Please tell me no.</br></br></br>  <br>It's got these strong guys called Twilights</br>  <br>Another season ruined by degenerates</br>  <br>There are more than ever, unfortunately. Especially when they're doing 19 shows this season, expect a lot of shows' discussion to be absolute shit.</br>  <br> baiting this hard <br>Literally nothing is worse than agk get the fuck out.</br></br>  <br>Oh fuckin' hell.</br>  <br>Yes there are a few superhumans, but they aren't the focus in the part that probably gets into the anime. On eof the main guys is such an autist. They most of them only have betetr stats that normal humans, nothing else.</br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>except gangsta you fucking shit eater</br>  So... Less retarded version of Hamatora?  <br>I only care about understanding the show. <br>And watching Funirips, I've never had a problem with not understanding <br>Who cares where they place the subs?</br></br></br>  <br>fuck off gangsta faggot the manga is fucking bad</br>  <br>Worst thing is, there are idiots who pay actual money for that garbage.</br>  <br>Livewatch is starting and as expected. No shitposting.  Not like there was anybody planning on watching it in the first place anyway. </br>  <br>I see potential for a few reaction images so i'll probably give it a try, it's only 10 minutes anyway.</br>  <br>(I'm just a normie strolling in from /v/ and /sp/ because I saw there was an anime about mafia shit coming out and I wanted to see how to watch it as soon as possible. Sorry that I triggered some of you trying to ask about the anime.)</br>  <br>Because mafia there is not like Takeshi kitano's movies anymore or like the mafia in western countries.<br>It would be fucking boring</br></br>  <br>but it is, with any fucking show there are always similarities<br> antagonists are a group team <br> antagonists are edgy, half of the time no one likes these fucks is simply because they're being massive dicks for no reason <br> author relies on edgy antagonists and their crimes in order to rile up the reader against the evil group <br> muh rape <br><br>I swear half the reason why we enjoy shitposting on this stuff is because you gangstafags hail the show as absolutely perfect when it clearly has a bunch of stupid problems</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>nope, gate prison monmus and jitsu already have fanbases that don't take themselves seriously and know that the shows they watch isn't a masterpiece, but at least they enjoy it and have fun with it. Thus if there are flaws, no one's going to defend them. Charlotte might be different. Gangstafags are fucking casuals which is they they hail this shit as perfect, which makes them easy targets when they go to defend this stuff.</br>  <br> This is the first show to air for Summer  <br>Damn that explains it, Shows airing first always get shat on.</br></br>  <br>Every show has flaws and you are still using edgy wrong. Also rape doesn't suggest that a series is bad you retard.<br><br> antagonists are a group team <br>yeah it should rather be one guy who steamrolls everyone</br></br></br></br>  Finally. My choco waifu.  <br> yaoi hands </br>  <br> we <br><br>Two faggots with their own round table, sure...</br></br></br>  <br> akame ga kill &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shit <br>No one will take you seriously.</br></br>  It's Kekkai Sensen all over again.  With that kind of crap actually getting anime adaptations, whats next - Trash. or Crimezone adaptation?<br><br>Edgy crap is the new Moe.</br></br>  <br>Dorohedoro</br>  <br>Dorohedoro isn't crap</br>  I am mostly watching this for Aoi Yuuki and Mamiko Noto.  <br>Kill yourself gangstafagboy, the manga is shit and the anime will be even more of a shit.</br>  <br>Thank you for your blogpost</br>  <br>reading comprehension of gangstafags still horrible as always. Where in the post does it say that rape was bad? All the post says is "muh rape" which points out both series have rape.</br>  i bet half of you shitting on gangtsa havent even read the manga<br><br>i havent even heard of gangsta until 10 minutes ago</br></br>  <br>You don't know shit about demographics and should shut up now.</br>  <br>Most of /a/ knows what's going to air months before and they actually check the source material unlike crossboarder faggots like you.</br>  Gangsta is fun as hell. I'm hype.  <br>Stop projecting.</br>  <br> muh rape <br> I swear half the reason why we enjoy shitposting on this stuff is because you gangstafags hail the show as absolutely perfect when it clearly has a bunch of stupid problems <br>You don't even know what you are writing, do you?</br></br></br>  <br>that isnt very nice :(</br>  <br> If it has dark themes it's edgy </br>  I'm a gangsta, I'm a straight up G. If you aint like this show you got a small pee pee.  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>This is 100% true. I saw Gangsta on a Crunchyroll poll earlier this week and have been extremely psyched for it since. Sorry gangstabros.</br>  <br>having dark themes for the same of having dark themes is edgy</br>  <br>Forgot<br> Yurishit: Two girls were on screen doing girl things together <br> Low budget: I took noticed a background character in the distance wasn't as great as the characters on screen even after I stretched out the resolution </br></br></br>  Just to clarify, having dark themes != shit/edgy.<br><br>I`ll put it in simplier terms even ADHD fag would understand:<br><br>Good:<br>Black Lagoon<br>Helsing<br>Gungrave<br>Jormungang<br>Noir<br>Darker Than Black<br>Baccano<br>Kite<br>Gunslinger Girl<br>etc.<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127431928#p127435830">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Returns as Kekkai Sensen Back 2 Back in just over two more weeks in the new Jump Crown SQ magazine.

Might be fun to hear HanaKana act chuuni.  <br>Wait I copied the text of the old post but it should be right to left shouldn't it.</br>  It sounds like Minami-ke: Superpower Edition  <br>Should do she's only at the end of volume 2 and these things tend to get in almost 3 volumes of 4koma. <br><br> I'm looking forward to her too, fantastic design </br></br></br>  is this the illustrator of ore twintail?  <br>Yeah same artist.</br>  <br>yep</br>  Is this yuri?  Iirc all the twintail girls are showing up in side character roles here. I wonder if they'll get Nobunaga to voice Souji's doppelganger.  NO YURI WE RIOT  <br><br>this went completely under my radar<br><br>again with genderbender or something?</br></br></br></br>   Series Composition: Reiko Yoshida <br>oh god</br>  <br>Power rankings<br>Aoi (powers too strong)<br>Akane<br>Shuu<br>Misaki (Imagine the sex)<br>Teru<br>Shiori <br>Kanade<br>Hikari<br>Haruka<br><br>Kanade's power sounds great but getting the money must be a ballache.<br><br><br>No genderbender just powers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Souji's doppelganger. <br>You mean the Akane FC leader? <br>That glasses guy right?</br></br></br>  <br> Reiko Yoshida <br>Fuck yes.<br><br>Picked the fuck up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yup. There aren't too many male characters in the series. Other than him there's the producer too but that seems like more fun role for him.</br>  So how much romance is in this? Hopefully not too much.  I hope this is good. I like the sound of it and the cast looks great. Also everyone's really cute.   Kirara <br> No yuri undertones <br>Expect it to bomb.</br></br>  This gives me Tokyo ESP vibes and I don't like it.  <br><br>YUP!</br></br>  <br>But it had</br>  <br>There's no fighting really. No enemy faction or whatever like that. <br><br><br>Very little, but it's there. It's cute anyway and not just chapters of misunderstandings.

Honestly it is SoL about family's everyday life so i hope no yurifags or any other fags shitting up the thread. </br></br>  <br>Nice.</br>  <br><br>I'd say Minami-ke tier.</br></br>  Looks cute, Story sounds like it could be fun to watch.  <br>Yeaaahhh</br>  <br>Shuu's girlfriend is a qt3.14.</br>  There's a group doing the manga, dumping it now.    <br>But they're sisters!<br><br> which is even better </br></br></br>        <br> mainly to her twintails </br>      <br>Red looks cute as fuck but it sucks she is voiced by HanaKana.</br>      <br>I like the chapter where she and Akane go to a <br>cafe, such a qt<br><br><br>Any idea how long it will take them to catch up? Surprised this found a group over the other 4koma stuff that still doesn't have one. <br>Although I wish groups wouldn't keep honorifics.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Dunno.</br>        <br> no red x MC <br>Why?</br></br>  What does /a/ think of Aldnoah Zero? I'm thinking about picking it up.<br><br>Aldnoah Zero thread.</br></br>  Eggs  <br>Elaborate</br>  You will get mad, if you want to get mad, watch it.<br><br> source: i'm mad </br></br>  It was written by the Butcher. Don't go in expecting smiles.  <br>Nothing happens but this show is really good at convincing you that something will happen. Rest assured though, nothing happens. <br><br>But hey if you wanna watch a shitty Gundam ripoff written by a bunch of hack writers trying their hardest to imitate a slightly less hack writer, you could do worse.</br></br></br>  <br>The correct way to watch Aldnoah Zero is to watch 3 episodes and use your imagination for the rest.</br>  That bad, huh? Too bad, I was hoping for better from the Butcher.  <br> It was written by the Butcher. <br>Literally only the first draft of the first episode and some character notes were written by Urobuchi.</br></br>  <br>Nobody dies: the animation.</br>  <br>Gundam wannabe. You're better off picking up some Gundams instead.</br>  Its shit.<br>I didnt bother with 2nd season, but judging on /a/'s reaction it was a wise decision.</br>  <br>But all I ever hear about the Gundam shows is how bad they are. IE I looked up SEED, Wing, and 00, what it seems are the most popular/well known ones, but everyone just said<br> It's shit, go watch this other Gundam series that we call shit on the same page <br><br>So is gundam total shit, or just nitpicky fans? I do want to get into the series. I haven't been able to find a torrent for the original movie trilogy though.</br></br></br></br>  The characters are great for porn, shitty fanfictions and cute pictures. <br><br>If you want to hear their voices download Yomecolle so you don't get mad.</br></br>  <br>Some big names worked on it and it had great potential. In the end, most of it got wasted.<br>Nice ost tho...</br></br>  <br>It wouldn't be as shit if the Butcher actually had more creative control.</br>  Please do not waste your time with this show, and even if you do, remember that S1 is 10x better than S2, as if that was a noteworthy achievement  Asshime is worse girl.  <br>Watch S1. Avoid S2.</br>  Not the Gundam Killer it was supposed to be  <br>Watch episode 15.<br>Download the ost.<br>Fap to Shimura art.<br><br>I saved your effort.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>IF you are actually suckered enough to watch it, only do so to see how fucking stupid it gets</br>  <br>Or not even touch AZ at all, S1 or not. If you just want flashy mecha fights, you could just pick up Akito and Unicorn OVAs.</br>  Slaine is a completely garbage character so avoid the second season <br><br><br> tumblr <br>This fucking fanbase.</br></br></br></br>  <br>S1 was fucking boring. Only salvage thing was Eggs and Ass getting shot at the end.<br>S2 was a trainwreck.</br></br>  <br>He did like episode one and a few plot points, but I think someone else filled in all the rest. A/Z was only fun to watch with /a/ to seeing how stupid it could get</br>  <br>Trainwreck would imply that someone thought it through enough to put said train on a track and that it had a conductor.</br>  <br>Did I ask for your opinion nigga.</br>  <br> S2 was a trainwreck. <br>I wish. Trainwreck implies some kind of large scale impact. S2 was just a bunch of cop outs. Barely enough substantial shit happened to count as a 'wreck'. You can't have a 'wreck' when you barely had anything to destroy.</br></br>  <br><br>Actually, both of these, yes. Check out the first season and see how you like it, but the second season is irredeemable shit from start to finish.</br></br>  S1 was still pretty bad, nothing really made sense, but there was something that you could see someone had at least tried to think it out. S2 just didn't care and was sloppy written for the sake of getting it over with.  <br><br>First season: Good! <br>Second season: Shit!</br></br></br>   i want to  FUCK SLAINE  <br><br>Most of Gundam is shit.<br><br>Just watch 0079, Zeta,  ZZ , CCA, 0080 and Turn A.</br></br></br></br>  <br> First Episode: Good! <br> Everything Else: Shit! <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br></br>  It's a typical story of UNDERSTANDING and a trio of friends where one goes darkness and the others pull him out done wrong because they tried to be 'creative' and annoyed people.   mfw a Terran was scum near me   <br>Don't.</br>  <br>Pretty good first few episodes and then it flies right of the same idiot cliff that every mecha anime has been driving off of since Gundam 00.</br>  <br>The show was a car that tried to go up hill only to roll back to where it started, never going anywhere.</br>  You literally missed the only reason to watch it by missing the weekly threads and shitposting. Nothing to see here.  Slaine is a cuck AND a faggot  The first three episodes of both seasons are good. The rest is a disaster.<br><br>The setting had a lot of potential but the focus on the muh symbolism fuccbois and generally being rushed ruined everything.<br><br>There was a lot to explore about the world and the war but all they cared about was Eggs and Srain.</br></br></br></br>  <br>you misspelled inaho</br>  <br>Okay OP here is the thing I will do to save you however many hours of your life. <br><br> Martians are assholes to be assholes to earth <br> Earth never tells anyone after the princess is found out to be alive in EPISODE 3, NOTE: Telling people the princess is alive will stop the war and basically make their main battle force hall all credit they held lost <br> No one but indoah knows how to fight and just stands around <br> Space battleship Yamato wins earth <br> Slaine knows he is fighting for evil so becomes evil because story needs him to <br> No one dies, even after headshots and multiple gunwounds talking full clip unloaded into him <br> characters have little to no personality other than ONE guy who saw his friend die <br> Series is wrapped up by some magical prince riding a white horse in and saying stop <br> Unless you read all the author notes you never understand why they are fighting until the end of S1 all most even then the series contradicts itself <br> Princess saves earth because she wants to see seagulls <br> the only humanistic trait that the MC has is he likes eggs, after that he becomes terminator </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=k9h<wbr>7dsmO38c</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Watch this 12 minute condensed video, you'll save yourself like 2 seasons of anime you can watch something good</br></br>  <br>Some not so great shows can still manage to be somewhat satisfying by the end, but there was no satisfying payoff at all in this</br>  I'm not going to fuck any of those guys : The anime  <br>00 is good. It's like the only good modern Gundam. The movie is shit.</br>  the main heroine marries someone who appeared three episodes before the ending.  If only Nao jad actually died.  <br>Those guys are going to fuck each other: the anime</br>  <br>if only ass had died</br>  <br> S1 <br>Retarded ass fun<br> S2 <br>Retarded ass shit</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Knights of Sidonia is pretty good.</br></br>  I'm pretty sure the anime would have been better without Slaine and Princess Netorare, and with a Hinaho displaying ingenuity and intelligence more often than leaving everything to his eye<br><br><br><br>You cunts.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It would have been better if it was just about Slaine's life on mars, rise on power and the inner vers conflict ignore the dull earth side.<br><br>Keep Hime dead, combine Inaho with Harklight and you have it.</br></br></br>  <br>This</br>  I had fun during the livestreams. Threads were too shit to post in when it was airing, though. Don't even bother now that all the discussion is dead.  <br>it's shit</br>  <br> would have been better focusing on the terrible soap opera and boring faggot lead <br>Jesus no.</br></br>  <br>Kill yourself</br>  <br><br>You have no taste, having the story in the PoV of Vers, the rise of Slaine to become a vilain, &gt;No fucking hime <br> Not hime <br> Fuck you Asserum </br></br></br></br>   interesting setting <br> cool mecha fights and shit <br> good animation <br> awesome soundtrack <br> shitty characters and plot <br> nothing ever happens <br><br>Go for it if you just like cool shit, but don't expect it to be very good or make sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Slaineshitter pls. It would still be terrible.<br> wheelchair cunt whines <br> butler is furniture  <br> slaine is still shit <br> martians are comic book villains  <br>I want to vomit just thinking about it. If this show had good writers it could work, but everyone knows it doesn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also fanbase is gay</br>  <br>This. More duels between knights, less bullshit with snoozecaulion.</br>  <br>Just giving the audience higher quantities of shit isn't going to save the series.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;7424004 <br>And what we got from earth?<br>Eggs being eggs, and the rest are Literally who <br>And eggs still got cuck in the end because muh ' my hearth is with the people of vers ' <br><br>Deal with it anon, earth is shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I think of you as part of myself <br><br>he did get NTR'd but it wasn't voluntary from either side</br></br></br>  <br>It would have been better if Marito had been the MC, he at least had a struggle to overcome. We can't have that though, mecha MCs must be teenagers.</br>  <br>This.<br>If you want a mecha, try Sidonia</br></br>  <br>Basically they just copy-pasted AGE's plot, and made it even edgier</br>  <br>they revealed she didn't have romantic feelings for him.</br>  <br>The only way to know if you'll like gundam is to watch a lot of it.</br>  <br> all that screen time in S1 about muh PTSD <br> still does jack in S2 thereby making all that build up pointless waste of time <br>Fuck whoever wrote AZ. They can't into storytelling for shit.</br></br></br>  <br> officially friendzoned <br> marries another man <br> abandons him to look after his rival and doesn't contact him again in a year <br> thinks about his rival only in 24.5 <br> giant bouquet dedicated to assxslaine with blue and red roses heart shaped with birds on top </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They mean in the desire to fuck Slaine, Inaho is the part of her who will get it after he brainwashes him into forgetting about Lemons and Harklight.</br>  Season one was alright, had an enraging ending.<br>Season two was terrible and had a disappointing ending.<br><br>The best thing to come out of A/Z is the soundtrack.</br></br></br>  <br>It sets up a really interesting world and does jack shit with it. It was a waste of time and the soundtrack was barely a saving grace.</br>  I'm up to episode 12 and am still enjoying it, should I expect to start hating it eventually? I don't mind if it's just my bad taste that's letting me enjoy it but I haven't noticed anything particularly awful about it so far, except for Inaho being a Gary Stu. <br><br>I'll just end up watching it all for the cute boys either way.</br></br>  <br>If she ever does decide to contact him I hope he ignores her. Doubt he wants an opportunity to pass on Slaine's message either way, who knows what she'd do.</br>  <br> I'm thinking about picking it up <br>Even original writer dropped this.</br></br>  <br>This is normal. By the end, you'll wonder why you even cared to begin with.</br>  <br>If he and Inaho had been rolled into one character it would have been fairly refreshing. Say he was still a genius and used physics during fights but his PTSD got in the way and made him fuck up half the time. Instead we got a robot and a drunk.</br>  <br>This show was retard from the get go and set up in kinda hilarious, the story was boring to the point that one can call it a borefest.<br><br>1st cour is a no story with full of action pack which is boring and horrible.<br><br>2nd cour is a gundam wannabe with a plot full of hole.<br><br>In short, it's shit: the show.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  just want to get this right. is the show bad all the way through 1st cour to 2nd cour or just the ending is shit?  S1: Good<br>S2: So bad that even Cross Ange was better when it was going full QUALITY and giving someone Kira Yamato tier plot armor</br>  <br> the show bad all the way through 1st cour to 2nd cour <br><br>This one. To be precise, a trainwreck such as Guilty Crown or Cross Ange is better than this show. This show is just dead boring, anon and I'm not joking or trolling you.</br></br></br>  <br>From boring to downright bad.</br>  <br> nitpicky fans <br>Gundam fans are the worst</br></br>  MC is the only person capable of using logic. <br><br>On it´s own, that wouldn´t piss me off, but everybody else is completely incompetent. The supporting characters were all tired cliches, with shit execution. Also, the fights being HOW CAN EGG-KUN DEFEAT THIS VILLAINS GIMMICK got boring very quickly.<br><br>0/10, wouldn´t recommend.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cour 1 is passable. Cour 2 makes the already insufferable characters even worse.</br>  <br>The problem was that the 1st part wasted too many episodes on fighting random Martians without much advance in plot. It mucked around like the first half of a typical Gundam series, even though it doesn't have the luxury of being a 40+ episode series.<br><br>Hell, for all the flak that G-Reco gets, at least it was aware of the urgency associated with the number of episodes to work with so shit actually happens alongside the obligatory fights.</br></br></br>  <br>The problem is that the show tried to be more than MoTW and failed miserably, and that's a problem with cour 2. These writers cannot handle politics, character drama or war and shouldn't have even tried.<br>There is literally no reason to give a shit about it not focusing on the terrible "plot" that the writers couldn't even keep track on.</br></br>  <br>Aldnoah was a steaming shitpile. Good Sawano music though, that's the only redeeming part.<br><br>Don't watch it but love its music. There you go.</br></br></br>  <br> Good Sawano music though <br>I love this meme</br></br>  <br> Pretty good first few episodes and then it flies right of the same idiot cliff that every mecha anime has been driving off of since Gundam 00. <br>This is why you should never take /a/'s opinion on mecha anime seriously. This aired at the exact same time as A/Z S2 and you retards ignored it. It's not that all mecha anime have this problem you just choose to watch shit.</br></br>  <br> Pretty good first few episodes <br>Top fucking kek</br></br>  <br>Your tastes are fucking shit. Next</br>  Yeah pick it up for S1 because it was actually acceptable, S2 was the biggest trainwreck you'll ever see and just ruined by shitty generic writing.  <br>How do you do it? How are you able to constantly come up with the stupidest post all the time?</br>  <br>He's right though. S1 was inoffensive. Everything in S2 was completely pointless as well as badly written.</br>   setting is good <br>If you forget that the majority of the Counts was born on earth.</br>  <br> S1 was inoffensive <br> The only person in the entire Earth forces that can do anything is a teenage boy <br> The "forced" rivalry between our two leads <br> The enemy being hilariously incompetent despite having better weapons <br> The ending <br> <br>Guess people are in a serious case of denial.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Robot eye was not there yet, so the gary stu never single-handedly took down a martian kat and didn't become the sole hope of earth yet as S2 deiced to make him. There was also no forced rivalry until S2 decided to make Slaine a gary stu to catch up to him. Earth side actually got screwed in S1 as well, unlike S2 where they became invincible. Remember when they actually sustained injuries in 12 and it seemed like someone may actually die? Good times. Unlike S2.<br>Overall it was inoffensive compared to the steaming shitpile of the second season.</br></br>  <br> so the gary stu never single-handedly took down a martian kat <br>He took down two kats by himself in teh first season<br><br> There was also no forced rivalry until S2 decided to make Slaine a gary stu to catch up to him. <br><br>You're a fucking idiot.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>While the incompetence was annoying, it was not as terrible as it became in cour 2 with the eye bullshit. Making him god-mode was where is became an insult. And there was no rivalry in the first season. S1 ending is still better and less bland than the 2nd. <br>So yeah. S2 is irredeemably bad and the first is watchable.</br></br>  <br>I like the atmosphere and one of Sawano's better tracks for an aniplex show. Everything about it is terrible, at best wasted potential if you think it had potential, but it's basically a gundam anime if it was a Hollywood movie or HBO thriller instead of autistic cartoon. Sort of like fate zero but bad not good.</br>  <br>Inaho took down two Kats by himself in the first season.<br><br>What the fuck are you talking about? Are you just gonna ignore the retardation of their exchange in the 7th episode?<br><br>What the fuck does have anything to do with what I said? You are a delusional fuckatard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and one of Sawano's better tracks for an aniplex show <br>How to spot a Sawano newfag</br></br>  <br> but it's basically a gundam anime if it was a Hollywood movie or HBO thriller instead of autistic cartoon. Sort of like fate zero but bad not good. </br>  <br> And there was no rivalry in the first season. <br>You are my enemy<br> S1 ending is still better and less bland than the 2nd.  <br>Not even close.</br></br></br></br>  Apparently Slaine was in a wheelchair in the original storyboard.  <br>He needed his team mates for the plans devised for all of them, except for Sauce because he just combined all the shitty gimmicks. Only in the S2 opening did he take one down without any help. The ice one who was just standing in place, which would really define a lot of the stupidity of S2.<br><br>They had a retarded argument but nothing about that was a rivalry. Only in the second season did they give Slaine an OP mech to try and try and match up their skills/make them actually duel. But it was forced because they barely know shit about each other or care much.</br></br></br>  <br>Season 1,episode 7, especially if you read the script. It was forced from the very beginning. A/Z was shit from the start. Earthside got screwed over that's why they won all their battles against superior mechas, and found the Deucalion.</br>  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/<br>This isn't a general.</br></br>  <br>It's better than Unicorn, sounds like Mars while unicorn was boring/no identity</br>  <br> He needed his team mates for the plans devised for all of them, <br>Nope. In the second encounter with the 2nd one who took him out by himself. <br><br> They had a retarded argument but nothing about that was a rivalry.  <br><br>Yeah you're an idiot.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not reading the fucking OP <br> Aldnoah Zero thread <br><br>And what the fuck does Slaine being in a wheelchair has to do with Tumblr? I got that from Twitter you sperg.</br></br></br></br>    <br>We are discussing which one is LESS shit. <br>Only once they asspulled revivals and then shat the bed more and more did the series become a trainwreck.</br></br>  <br>It was a trainwreck from the start</br>  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/</br>  Aldnoah Zero was a mistake...  <br>It was shit from the very start, the first cour was boring and predictable. The asspulls didn't start in the second cour they started in the first.</br>  <br>Report it or STFU</br>  <br>There's actually nothing wrong with that post. The show tried to be a political soap opera character war drama after episode 12 and failed at all of it. It's like it was by a bunch of drunks. At least the show didn't try to be more than a dumb and campy super robot anime in the first 12 episodes. <br>The transition did not work because the writing was never good.</br></br>  <br> he show tried to be a political soap opera character war drama after episode 12 <br> after episode 12 <br><br>Try since the first episode.</br></br></br></br>  <br> STFU <br>All these crossboarders need to die.</br></br>  <br><br>Most disappointing anime in a while. <br>The original concept was something like MonHun with weak robots beating stronger robots using teamwork, then they added PHYSICS which was all in all an interesting gimmick. The best use for it was Episode 3. Other than that, it was garbage and Aoki's shitty characters dragged down the whole thing. The plot was also thin and retarded, so all we got is terrible characters playing war. <br>Also the music hardly matched what was going on and it only really worked in ep3. <br><br>In a way it's like a mini SEED/Destiny, people keep bringing it up just to show how much disgust they have for the show.<br><br>I really want to see the show's gimmick used in another show, I think it has potential.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like tumblr and animesuki woke up.</br>  <br> first cour <br> super robot show </br></br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/search/text/s<wbr>tfu/order/asc/<br><br>STFU</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>He was supposed to be recovering from his injuries, yeah.</br>  <br>Slaine was never a Gary Stu in either season. He got the most 'realistic' character development in the show, even if it was mediocre, I'm using the show low bar.</br>  It seems that Slaine won the popularity contest when they asked "Inaho or Slaine" during the Extra Day event.  <br> using realistic and slaine in the same sentence <br>I didn't need a laugh, but thanks anyway. <br>That bar must be set so low it's reaching the equator.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. That was a question to the VAs but they trolled with the answers so they asked the audience instead and they voted for Harklight.<br><br> To the cast: Inaho or Slaine? <br> Inaho VA: Inko <br> Calm VA: Yuki <br> Harklight VA: Harklight <br><br> Let's ask the audience to clap <br> Inaho and Slaine: same amount of clapping <br> Harklight: more clapping than Inaho and Slaine </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The other votes were<br><br> Yuki VA: Inaho <br> Slaine VA, both Himes VA and Loli VA: Slaine <br><br>Inaho would never win since the cast that voted was just those 8. 5 Mars VA and 3 Earth VA</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Inaho and Slaine: same amount of clapping <br>That was just karice's account. She's an Eggfag.</br></br>  Translation?  <br>It really should have just been one cour, the second one was a wast of time. They had a bunch of interesting ideas but they had no ambition to make them actually happen. The show really needed somebody else at the helm that was willing to take risks, really this the safest mecha I've watched in ages. It's war, you gotta kill some people.</br>   It's time.   for what?  <br>Time to turn down for what.</br>    <br>Takumi is an angel.</br>  Suddenly Blue sky complex got updated. <br>Still cock-blocked.</br>  Crane is love    I think this Turkey dance shit is the worst shitposting by far.  <br>No Crane is bullshit, her dance is from 2005 "You got served" and it's nothing but fanservice.

And there is nothing wrong with that.

You literally have no reading comprehension.<br><br><br> Watching 15 shows every season that all use the same cliches over and over again <br>You are a legit autist, not even kidding. You aren't watching anime to enjoy it, but only to be able to say that you did. That's autism.

Aside from the cool mystery plot and the Mayan fanyasy setting, there's enough cute girls to keep the shallow ones interested. Is it because of Passione?

My Wife is the Student Council President! stars Izumi Hayato (Okitsu Kazuyuki), who is running for student council president. But when the beautiful Wakana Ui (Taketatsu Ayana) swoops in, promising the liberalization of love and throwing condoms into the audience, Izumi loses and ends up as her vice president. If that wasn’t enough, the newly-elected president ends up inviting herself over to Izumi’s house, and announces that she’s Izumi’s wife, thanks to an agreement—facilitated by alcohol—that their parents made when they were three. Each episode will be ten minutes long.  Ergastulum is a city of petty thieves and powerful mafia families, of sex workers and corrupt cops. It’s a city that casts a grimy shadow over the actions of its citizens, hiding the dirty nature that lies beneath. The streets of Ergastulum are ruled by four gangs: Paulklee, Corsica, Monroe, and Cristiano. Nicolas Brown (Tsuda Kenjirou) and Worwick Arcangelo (Suwabe Junichi) are two jacks-of-all-trades, dealing with the tasks that no one else dares to tackle in this dangerous urban jungle. But this powerful duo find themselves in trouble after they’re asked to deal with a new gang making waves in the territory of one of the top mafia families. Things are never as they seem in the dark alleys of Ergastulum, but this case may be one even they can’t handle.  <br> From the original creator of Chu-Bra!! <br><br>An introduction like that screams irrelevant</br></br></br>  Seems like it'd be easier to list what I'm not going to watch this season:<br>Kaijuu<br>Makura<br>Junjou<br>Hetalia<br>Oh and Dragon Ball.<br><br>On the fence about Million Doll and Venus Project but fuck it, I guess I'll try them as well.<br>So yeah. Shit. That's a lot of shows picked up but it seems like six or seven shows will get dropped like usual.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At that point you might as well pick up those five so you can brag about watching everything on /a/</br>  <br>Each episode would take only 10 min. of your life.</br>  <br>That's ten whole shitposts though</br>  <br>Nah man. There are some things even I can't stomach. Besides, what am I supposed to brag? How infallibly shit my tastes are and how much of a life I lack? I guess you could call that an achievement.</br>  Anyone here read the Gansta manga/novel or whatever? Is it any good? The premise is interesting I guess. I'll keep my eye on it.<br><br>Other than that there's nothing for me on this list right now.</br></br>  <br> How infallibly shit my tastes are and how much of a life I lack <br><br>Isn't that the entire point of this board?</br></br></br>  <br> picking up all the moeshit and fanserviceshit in the world <br> not picking up Dragon Ball <br><br>For what purpose?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's shit</br></br>  <br> Gansta manga <br>it's good and has 0 fjoshit bait.</br></br>  Bikini Warriors, nothing else.  <br><br>This is why you don't ask /a/ for opinions</br></br>  <br>No need to be an insufferable fuck about it, I always say. Why shitpost when I can just jerkoff?<br><br><br>You can try harder than that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because you are on /a/ and people would rather watch cute girls than retarded powerlevel normalfaggotry.</br>  My most anticipated anime of this season.  <br>You did that since the 1960's? I'm impressed.</br>  In order of hype:<br>Gakkou gurashi, NNB, Prison school, Working, Ushio x Tora, Overlord</br>   4 or so shows I want to watch as season starts <br> browse /a/ during the season <br> get caught up in the hype of about another 6-10 shows that deep down I know will be shit <br> download them <br> think they're shit but have potential <br> watch all 24 episodes and they turned out to be shit <br> be disappointed in myself <br> repeat <br><br>Every season without fail. At the moment I know I'm going to watch NNB2, Working 3, Gangsta and Prison School.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's coming out today? And will we get subs within 5 hours?</br>  <br>If you want shit Funi rips then yes.</br>  <br>Gangsta and some student council thing<br><br>Gangsta is picked up by funi so subs should be immediate</br></br></br>   new season <br> pick up around 5 shows <br> after a few weeks I start to slack and the episodes pile up <br> end up not finishing anything <br><br>Every fucking season. <br><br> T-this season will be different right? ;_; </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no need to be an insufferable dick <br><br>What the fuck is this? A reasonable individual?<br>Where am I?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bizzaro /a/</br>  People should really get some fucking patience and wait a few week so you don't have to go trough that shitty period where nobody knows what groups will pick up and actually complete a series.  <br>Must have slipped into bizzaro /a/ again. Get out of there before it's too late.</br>  <br> 26 <br><br>I usually get 12 every season and I think it's a lot. I don't drop them unless it's really awful, though.</br></br></br>  <br> 26 <br>M8, get another hobby besides animu.</br></br>  Very hyped for Symphogear GX, Classroom Crisis, Wizard Air Academy (Kusen Madoushi) and Venus Project. Will watch most of the rest although I have very little expectations for them.  The Seiyu show looks different, I'll try that. Also, isn't monster girl airing this season?  No one is simulcasting Okusama ga Seito Kaichou right?  <br> isn't monster girl airing this season? <br><br>Yes</br></br></br>  Is Gate good or is it just for /ak/ autists?  <br>Relatively hype tier: Gate, Gods Eater.<br>The manga was better tier: Monster Musume, Kangoku Gakuen.<br>Sound promising tier: Joukamachi no Dantelion, Gakkou Gurashi, Chaos Dragon</br></br></br>  Shit I still haven't seen Symphogear and Working  <br><br>For pedo autists too</br></br>   Shimoseka <br> Prison school <br> Gangsta <br>Most "hyped for"<br><br> Jitsu Wa  <br> Charlotte <br> Overlord <br>I'll have a look at<br><br><br> Aoharu x Kikanjuu <br>Well here goes nothing<br><br> Ore Monogatari <br> SnS <br> Baby Steps <br>Will continie</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  God tier:<br>Miss monochrome<br><br>Must watch:<br>Drrr!x2 <br>Himouto!

How could he possibly do anything other than watch anime with such a time consuming amount!</br>  From the chart it seem I'll only thoroughly enjoy DETERMINATION TO FIST<br><br> For the rest, I'll give them 12-episode rule </br></br>  <br>    12-episode rule <br>top kek</br></br>  <br>Well considering a significant amount of anime is 13 episodes or 2 cour it isn't that silly</br>  <br> symphoshit <br>fuck off with your shit taste</br></br>  <br><br> Shimoseka <br>Why would you be hyped for ecchi LN shit by JC Staff?</br></br></br>  <br>Hyped and "Hyped" are very different things.<br>The premise sounds fun</br></br>  <br>Please dont post with reaction image from good show, when you obviously have shit taste. Symphogear is officially one of the worst anime franchizes ever made.</br>  <br> watching a series even if it's complete shit for at the very least 12 episodes <br>Anon, I...</br></br>  <br>fuck you.Symphogear is fun</br>  <br>If its /a/ threads are fun, its worth it. Watching anime is totally not worth it anyway.

I've missed really trashy ecchi comedy shows since Nourin.</br>  <br>Again, the synopsis sounds fun.<br>Chill out</br></br>  <br>It's not a rule I have, just saying it could be plausible<br><br>The second last episode sets up the finale. If you can tell that it is just going to be shit, you can drop it then. It also marks the midway point of a 2 cour. You've seen half a season, you know what to expect now. It's a sensible dropping point.<br><br>Personally I just choose shows selectively and never drop them if I pick them up.</br></br></br></br></br>   Ctrl F Wakaba <br>  0 results  <br><br>Surely I'm not the only one interested in this? I mean it doesn't seems like the most original show ever but could make up for a decent SOL nonetheless. Also the main girl obsession with gyaru got me curious.</br></br></br>  <br> It's a sensible dropping point. <br> wasting all the time instead of watching 3-6(max) and know that it's shit or not <br>anon pls</br></br></br>  <br>Just go watch B Gata H key, its better</br>  <br>It just sounds boring to me. I enjoy SOL, but I like it to have at least some kind of quirk.<br><br><br>Sometimes shows start off strongly and then die down. Ore Monogatari is a decent example. it started strong but grew stale. If I was into dropping things I would probably drop it now.</br></br></br></br>  NNB x2<br>Himouto<br>Gangsta<br><br> maybe <br>overlord<br><br> stuff I'm behind but I'd watch <br>prisma loli<br>to love ru</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   people seriously listing Gangsta among the shows they look forward to watch <br>heh, ignorant plebs. Will be fun watching everyone drop it.</br>  When the fuck are we getting the Mushishi movie? It's summer.  <br>I usually try to pick up 7-8 and end up watching 3 and change. Last season I just watched all of Nanoha and ViviD instead, plus Fate and Danna. Everything else was varying shades of "manga was better" and shit.</br>  <br> Will be fun watching everyone drop it. <br><br>yeah just like this season first 3 weeks of ninja slayer DOMO DOMO DOMO, right?<br><br>sure was fun being littered with YEART until everyone dropped it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I have shittaste <br>Well, that's kind of your problem.</br></br>    <br><br>I don't watch anime shorts.</br></br>  <br>It's a short</br>  <br> kek <br/></br>  <br>People actually liked Kekkai Sensen,so i bet there will be people claiming Gangsta is AOTS after Summer season.<br><br>The Gangsta manga is really disappointing,so be warned /a/.</br></br></br>  <br>Ninja Slayer, initial Inferno Cop shock aside, turned out to be quite decent - and while Trigger drones shut up, it has plenty of people who enjoy it.<br><br>Gangsta is just shit.<br><br><br>No, i can read source material and dont just blindly jump on hype train based on visuals alone.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's shit I'll drop it like any other show in any other season, that's how it works.</br>  <br>I sure didn't expect Umaru Chan to be animed.<br>I look forward as how they are going to not turn Prison School in a weird fetish porno.<br>Monster Musume, I'm really excited about this.<br>To love-ru, Mikan fap material back.<br>As for Kaleid, I want to see  Mini Gil </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> heh, ignorant plebs. <br><br><br> Ninja Slayer turned out to be quite decent </br></br></br></br>  <br> No, i can read source material <br>I read it to and you have shittaste.

Would I end up having to study two decks every day just to keep up with the words I had already learned?</br>  <br><br>HTML isn't pdf.</br></br>  <br>Did you even read his posts?<br> I was trying to view some of the azw3 light novels from the CoR in my web browser without success </br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=cRK<wbr>3nT77aso</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Here's some nice listening practice for all you MGS fans out there.</br></br>  <br> I was considering just making a deck for Tae Kim vocab  <br>CoRくん made two for TK vocab.

I'm not after html files because they are secondary and do not display exactly the same across all browsers and pdf readers. Forgot to add that I wasn't after html folders for each book but a singular cross compatible file, aka a pdf. In retrospect this should have been added to the post. My mistake, sorry about the confusion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How many individual kanji are in the Core 2k/6k deck? I'm 48% through it at the moment after a few months and found that I could recognise about 600-800 of the kyouiku kanji upon a quick scroll through a list of them -- how many different kanji (from the deck only) will I be able to recognise after finishing the whole thing?  <br>Running the example sentences through Jparser provided this<br>http://pastebin.com/JkBMpN1h<br>First column is number of appearances. A fair few with less than five appearances.</br></br></br>  <br>That's... pretty damn neat. Thanks.<br><br>It's only slightly more than I expected. I was assuming all kyouiku kanji would be in there, but not all jouyou kanji. 1650 is a very decent amount.</br></br></br>  <br>Not all kanji in example sentences are used in the new words, and I doubt that he will be able to recognize kanji he only saw in example sentences. Using kanji grid and limiting it to Japanese word field gives 1597 unique kanji.</br>  <br> Not all kanji in example sentences are used in the new words <br>That seems like an oversight by iKnow. Oh well, get what you pay for and all.</br></br>  <br>Well, this is how my cards look, so the example sentences are still going a good deal of teaching.<br><br>1597 in the word field is still excellent, though.</br></br></br>  <br>If you replace the example sentence field with {{furigana:[whatever your field name is]}} those kana in brackets should be displayed as furigana, if you like.</br>  <br>For furigana use {{furigana:your_name_of_field with _furigana}} like {{furigana:Notes-Kanjified-vocab Reading}}</br>  <br>I know, but at that font size the furigana is too awkward to read (my monitor is 72dpi) and I don't want to increase the font size as the purpose is to replicate regular text kanji as seen online and shit.</br>  <br><br>振仮名脳</br></br>  <br>Well, um, fair enough.</br>  <br>Supposedly you shouldn't use sentence on the front as sometimes you will connect meaning and reading to the sentence instead of to the word and then you'll be fucked when this word is used in a different sentence.</br>  <br>This can be true, yes. It's important to check whether front-side sentences are damaging your recognition skills.</br>  <br><br>install Meiryo<br>Heck, should be part of your computer if it's vista or win7</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I don't actually read the sentence the vast majority of the time. I have it there, well, as an option, but also because the word in the reading is often a different tense to the word up top, so glancing just at the bolded part of the sentence and also at the word gives me 2 different tenses of the word, which I find is pretty helpful.</br>  <br>Oh, and I don't use the audio from the example sentence there.</br>  <br>The people who suppose that are beginners themselves who are mimicking things other beginners have said.

I mean, how many time do you dedicate to kanji, grammar and vocab? Maybe on Mondays you do kanji, then grammar, then vocab and so on?  <br>As many time as I have in my pocket. These pockets can hold dozens of time.</br>  <br>You cover all 3 by reading.</br>  Okay, I know there are lots of resources for studying, but how does one go about actually learning once past the kana level?  <br>By reading the Guide.</br>  <br>Tae Kim.

If there are words which don't stick they aren't priority. There is no point in trying to learn words you aren't coming across in native media. Are you learning Japanese or are you trying to win a spelling bee?</br></br>  い いいわよっ<br>受けてたとうじゃ<br>ないの！<br>I get the general meaning of the sentence but I dunno what とう is supposed to mean and Jisho doesn't help.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you plan on using a texthooker most of your life? Anki is useful for acquiring rarely seen (1-2 times per year) vocabulary. Yeah, you could learn it like Nips do, over 20 years of life, but some people want to be fluent as quick as possible.<br><br> If there are words which don't stick they aren't priority. <br>They ARE a priority if you want to become fluent in less than 20 years.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The people who suppose that are beginners themselves who are mimicking things other beginners have said. It isn't an issue if Anki is used as a revising tool, not a learning tool, and the person reads outside of Anki. <br><br>Even were you correct, it would still be very detrimental to have sentence on front when it comes to very rarely seen vocab.

That's why I can read.</br></br>   DJT in action   <br>たとう</br>  <br> Do you plan on using a texthooker most of your life? <br>I don't use a texthooker.<br>How the fuck do you think people have been able to reach fluency in the past? <br> Anki is useful for acquiring rarely seen (1-2 times per year) vocabulary. <br>Vocabulary isn't "acquired" in Anki; it is "acquired" through a process of massive exposure and encountering the word used in a wide variety of contexts. Unless your card for the word has dozens of example sentences you aren't "acquiring" shit. <br> but some people want to be fluent as quick as possible. <br>1. language isn't something you can rush. It simply doesn't work like that, like it or not. <br>2. The only way to speed up the process if the physical increase in time spent with comprehensive input. Reading for hours and hours a day, looking up unknown words and structures, is going to be vastly more efficient than using Anki, because it means you will have to be reviewing hundreds of new words every day. <br>3. People concerned about trying to learn Japanese as fast as possible don't waste time on anonymous image boards. They are the people too busy studying and reading as much as they possibly can. There are a few language learning schools, which are under the radar due to legality, which hammer the language into poor immigrants who need to learn the language as quickly as they can in order to get a job and survive in Japan, as their current living conditions are unsustainable.<br><br><br> Even were you correct, it would still be very detrimental to have sentence on front when it comes to very rarely seen vocab. <br>That's nice. Anything data supporting this? So far the data supporting reading=learning more words is outstanding to the point which makes the anki format entirely irrelevant. <br>Also keep in mind that DJT's champion Steven Kaufman has stated that on the occasions that he has used Anki his cards have EVERYTHING on the front. Seems to work pretty well with him, no?<br> Also, nice ad hominem. <br>Not how an hom. functions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not how an hom. functions. <br>/int/fag detected</br></br>  Well, I came here for a Japanese discussion, but it seems there's an argument going on as per normal.<br><br>In any case, has anyone else experienced the phenomenon of forgetting "basic shit" because it's, paradoxically, so uncommon? Like "cat" being a basic word, but forgetting it because you read a VN and it never comes up a single time. For me, it was the word 習う. I heard someone say it and I didn't recognize it so I looked it up and poof, it's a basic-ass word I already knew but just forgot. Like, what the fuck? I'm thinking back and I haven't seen the word in the past 5~ hours of this book I'm reading. It's weird for a common word to coincidentally not appear. Any thoughts on this phenomenon?</br></br>  <br>Acquiring as in memorising. And don't tell me you need hundreds of contexts for 'beige'</br>  <br>This was in the Feedback section on the website and on the off chance that the anon who posted this<br> 30/06/2015 22:11:18 Can you fix the css on the pages show they correctly show the links I have and have not clicked.

Other than saying I have an n4, I'd like to get across that I can speak basic japjap by starting my cover letter with a greeting in jap. I was thinking something basic like "今日は マクーさん” <br><br>Will that be enough or is there something I can break out that'll really impress them? Anybody have any experience applying for something similar?</br></br></br></br>  How important is listening practice in developing an intuitive understanding of the language?<br><br>I've done a lot of reading practice, but my Japanese still feels really robotic. If there's any kind of slang or a dialect slightly changing a common conjugation (たん instead of の) then it throws me for a loop and I can't intuitively pick up on what obviously should have been there because I don't have a feel for the flow of sentences. I've just become pretty good at robotically piecing them together.<br><br>Will this improve with more reading or does an intuitive understanding of the language come mostly from listening practice?</br></br></br></br>  <br> And don't tell me you need hundreds of contexts for 'beige' <br>You do to really come to terms with the different ways people use it and don't use it, naturally. Chances are you have come across several thousand different contexts for the usage of 'beige' in English.<br><br>You don't seem to have any real idea just how many thousands of times in thousands of different ways we come across common words in English.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well for one, don't write こんにちは in kanji。And that's probably not the appropriate greeting anyway, it's too casual. You are applying to these people for a job, I think some keigo would be in order.</br>  <br> Seems to work pretty well with him, no? <br>He never became fully fluent. <br><br> Not how an hom. functions. <br>"An ad hominem (...) means responding to arguments by attacking a person's character, rather than to the content of their arguments."<br> The people who suppose that are beginners themselves who are mimicking things other beginners have said. <br>The above falls nicely into the definition. Instead of refuting what the anon said you just try to ridicule him to make his statement look false.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hey djt, can you do me a rock solid? I'm going on an impromptu, strong-armed vacation for 10 days starting tomorrow and I do not have any new cards in anki lined up. Usually I mine what I read and do them on that day. However, now I need 10 days worth of cards and I simply do not have that many.<br><br>Therefore: Can anyone do me a rock solid and paste some words from their mining deck? I will in turn mine those and save a lot of time. I would appreciate this greatly.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I thought it was too informal. Just not sure what's appropriate for this scenario</br>  <br>Give me even 5 different usages of 'beige'.  Also I just realised that my example is pretty bad, because it also means "A soft fabric of undyed, unbleached wool" </br>  <br> is there something I can break out that'll really impress them? <br>Converse with your prospective employers in Japanese. They will be impressed if they think you are a native or part Japanese only to find out you aren't. <br><br><br> He never became fully fluent.  <br>Buzzword. <br> instead of refuting what the anon said <br>You don't get it, do you? Anon made a statement without any supporting reason or evidence. It was opinion and conjecture; I provided my own opinion and conjecture based on observations. There hasn't been anything stated which has been founded by anything in order to be able to refute. The quote you quoted is also wrong. An ad hom. is when the argument is taken to the person and the personal attributes of the person are used as a form of evidence to form an opinion. An insult or comment about the attitudes of people isn't an ad hom. <br><br>Since you are so inclined to suddenly want for reference, how about sharing the full citation and source of that quote?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>My advise is: Keep in mind, you know some Japanese but you do not know Japanese. I mean. Trying to produce when it's far above your level (no offense) is just going to embarrass you. At one point, you WILL be confident in yourself and will be able to shit out greetings like no tomorrow. At THAT point, produce on your letter or whatever.</br></br>  I'm curious, what's "optimized" about the core 2k/6k Anki deck?  <br>It introduces words in such a way that you learn kanji more optimally and build upon existing knowledge.</br>  <br>So you're saying for now I should just write a normal letter? I get i'm still a newb and I wouldn't want to embarrass myself</br>  <br>Probably a bad idea. Managing a greeting in a cover letter isn't going to impress anyone anyway. It just leaves you open to looking stupid later. Just say that you know some basic Japanese somewhere in the letter.<br><br>But if you're feeling really into it: http://en.bab.la/phrases/applicatio<wbr>n/cover-letter/english-japanese/<br><br>I've been writing Japanese cover letters recently. It's pretty soul destroying.

I still have crippling social anxiety, and Watamote was enjoyable to me.</br>  <br> objectively <br>Nice start.<br><br> You can't enjoy this thing because it triggers me <br>pic related</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Come on anon, you can't possibly be this new.</br>  <br>Perhaps I'm looking at it through the lens of someone who has beaten it. Perhaps I don't want to be reminded of how debilitating it can be. Perhaps I have shit taste. I don't know, but I surrender.</br>  <br>I liked the manga but the show was indeed pretty bad.</br>  <br>Came here to autistically post this.</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>This isn't leddit</br>  <br>Downvoted</br>  Barakamon    comfy<br>Azumanga<br><br>relaxing<br>nnb<br><br>healing<br>ichigo<br><br>funniest<br>kinmoza<br><br>all around<br>yryr<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127433132#p127435818">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Will editor-kun give us the 1st page preview this month?  <br>Eren and Historia already held hands, together, alone, multiple times, and you're still here.</br>  Kill youselves fucking landwhales  <br>Do you really think Jean was being serious? It sounded like he was joking to me.</br>  <br>He was being a shit about Eren probably having to touch her when trying to remember things.</br>  Isayama really should've found someone to draw for him. His art is awful.  <br>It's weird how it immediately worked when Historia touched his spine, and now apparently that doesn't work anymore for some reason.</br>  <br>It probably has something to do with the cave and Rod.</br>    <br>I like his art, it's charming</br>  Why is Historia called yummy curry? I'm confused.  <br>Maybe if Historia touched him somewhere....in the lower department...it would work if you know what I mean. Shake it a bit with your hand and something will definitely come.</br>  <br>That's just a retarded name our YH landwhales use for Ymir/Historia, because of Yumi+Kuri, the beginning of their names. Historia is just Historia.</br>  <br>Well, he can finally get hard again thanks to her.</br>  <br>Thanks to Reiner's armored semen you mean.</br>  <br>That would require Eren to have a penis.</br>  <br>It was probaly Rod, since he also touched his back. He's also the reason Historia saw some of his memories, when he died.</br>  <br>How is it possible for Rod to have powers while Historia doesn't?</br>  <br>I think the latest chapter confirms Historia doesn't have any kind of memory ability so it was probably Rod's work entirely. Plus she herself got her memories erased when being a Reiss should prevent that.</br>  <br>Remember she was raised elsewhere. She never lived with the other Reiss.</br>  <br>Historia's blood isn't pure</br>  <br>Maybe when a noble fucks a peasant it makes their blood impure.</br>  <br>She isn't called that.</br>  <br>But that's only because she got infected with Turk semen.</br>  <br>Are you implying Rod's wife was his cousin?</br>  Is female titan a type of titan or did Annie just luck out with her form being hot?  <br>Or Rod's wife was another noble from another family.</br>  Can we have a serious discussion now? Let's talk about what makes Jean the best written character.  <br>His dashing good looks and charming personality can't be beat, and his skill with maneuvering gear puts every other character to shame.</br>  <br>Jean a shit.</br>  <br>Well, he's one of the only characters that's actually had some development.</br>  <br> Ymirfag desperately reverse shitposting <br>I recognize that from the last thread.</br></br>  <br>A lot of characters had development.</br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br>The only characters I can think of who hasn't is Hanji and Mikasa.</br>  <br>His art is perfect for the manga though. I can't see someone else doing it.</br>  <br>Hanji still had some in the last arc.</br>  <br>The angry outbursts? Hanji was always like that.</br>  Why are people who think heterosexual relationships are cute considered scum in these threads?  <br>Roleplaying</br>  <br>You shouldn't take anons so seriously. You'll give yourself a nervous breakdown in no time. Since this is an anonymous imageboard people over-exaggerate and act like certain ships, characters and their fags are the scum of the earth, but that's really just their way of saying they simply don't like it. Or they're just trying to rile people up for the fun of it.</br>  <br>It's always the usual neckbeard/fujo bickering in these threads.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127417389 <br>This is so powerful.</br>  <br>Not really. She's one of the few characters I actually like, so I hope Isayama hasn't forgotten about her. Not just stupid talk about her gender.</br>  <br><br>A 15 year old boy should not have those kinds of birthing hips. Holy fuck, Armin.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127417389 <br><br>Go home, Tumblrina.

Better later than never though. </br>  <br>Happens all the time in royal families.</br>  <br>Why would being a Reiss prevent that? Having bloodine powers doesn't necessarily mean being immune to it.</br>  <br>But it's said that some bloodlines are immune to it. Unless Historia isn't an actual Reiss, this doesn't make sense.</br>  <br>But the Reiss haven't been confirmed to be included in those bloodlines.</br>  <br>I though they said that the nobles and some bloodlines aside the Walls bloodline is immune. I'm pretty sure the Reiss are included in the noble group.</br>  <br>It's the Reiss that made some immune bloodlines into nobility in exchange for their cooperation. They couldn't be geassed like everyone else so they were given sweet incentives instead.<br><br>Those who refused to be Reiss lapdogs, like the Asians, got persecuted.</br></br></br>  I'm actually excited for this chapter, too bad I can't share the hype with anyone since ya'll a bunch faggets  <br> It's the Reiss that made some immune bloodlines into nobility in exchange for their cooperation. <br>What? Only the Asian clan and the Ackermans are from different bloodlines of the people in the walls. The few other bloodlines disappeared or got extinct. The nobles aren't they.</br></br>  <br>Yes you can.  Unless you came from tumblr. </br>  <br>Nope read again. The Ackerman and the Asians were immune bloodlines who told the Reiss to go fuck themselves, the others submitted in exchange for perks.</br>  <br>It only says they obeyed, it's really unlikely they were turned into nobles.</br>  <br>Isayama is getting better at drawing?</br>   Isayama when he's really into it.   <br>Isayama is actually nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be.He just rushes too much.</br>  <br>I actually like OP's image. Is this Isayama art when he's not rushing?</br>  <br>His art suits the manga.</br>  <br>Official solo illustrations usually. For the monthly chapters, there's only so much time he can invest in one panel.</br>  <br>OP's pic isn't Isayama's.</br>    <br>Guess he really has a waifu.  10/10 taste. </br>  Armin x Eren lol  <br>Armin x Jean lel</br>  <br>You can share it...with me...if you know what I mean, wink wink.</br>  Where is it?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127427563 <br>I don't like Annie but I am going to masturbate to this right now. Wish me luck /a/.</br>  <br>Being whored in the underground city after regenerating, fully naked, in the battlefield.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127427563 <br>Fucking disgusting.</br>  <br>Done / finished / nutted.<br><br>That didn't take very long.</br></br></br>  <br>Erza is the epitome of Mary Sue.</br>  <br> Reiner loses left arm too <br>What happens if the arm isn't eaten or destroyed? Would it go full  starfish comet? </br></br>  <br>It's in the some other chapter. I'll look it up next time.</br>  <br>I thought that was Natsu.</br>  <br>The bloodlines are only talked about in this chapter though.</br>  <br>I would think the Reiss would be immune considering they were the ones doing the mindwiping.</br>  <br><br>Shifters regenerate from the spine down. Everything that is cut off probably vanishes after a while. Otherwise that would be tons of free meat.</br></br>  <br> spine down <br>Not really.</br></br>  <br>How does this prove me wrong?  That was a cool page. </br>  <br>Reiner regenerated the wound in his head, that's spine up.</br>  <br>Eren also regenerated his teeth and ripped off face.</br>  <br>That's not what I meant, I meant they regenerate from the spine. My bad, I worded it wrong.</br>  <br> &gt;Box cutter cut. <br> That's really terrifying as well, no wonder Bert is crying, that might've hurt. </br></br>  <br>Not doubting the pain at all, but he's obviously not crying because of the pain.</br>  <br>Yeah, I know he though it was the end for him.<br> his face </br></br>  <br>dat ass</br>  <br>meant for </br>  <br>I was about to say that.</br>   tfw 7 more days   <br>Everything that could go wrong went wrong in a minute during the reveal. Imagine spending five years carefully infiltrating the enemy just to get killed in a second because someone spilled all the information because he's insane. And god knows how many more years they spent in training.</br>  <br>5-6 till spoilers</br>  <br>*4<br>There's the spoilers.</br></br>  <br><br>When did the fujos deliver last month?</br></br>  <br>Nah it also comes up in the scat pages.</br>  <br><br><br>Deleted,fuck, anyone got it? I'm all for Annie lewds</br></br></br>  <br> someone spilled all the information because he's insane <br>I still think the plan was to infiltrate MP, but Reiner got full soldier and Bert sticked with him while Annie just didn't give a fuck.<br> And god knows how many more years they spent in training. <br>Probably the whole childhood.</br></br></br></br>  <br>on the 6th I believe</br>  <br>I think Bert had a choice to go to the MP or stay in the SL since there was already one person to fill each position and stayed with Reiner because of his mental issues. Explains why he looked so troubled at least.<br>One had to stay and keep an eye over the coordinate and one kept the plan of infiltrating the MP.<br><br> I still think the plan was to infiltrate MP <br>Getting the coordinate is the priority.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I still think the plan was to infiltrate MP <br>Agreed.<br><br> but Reiner got full soldier and Bert sticked with him <br>No, they know Eren was a shifter by then so that's another lead, not to mention Eriwn baited them on purpose with the basement.<br><br>Which they'll probably find and ransack before the SL get to Shiganshina, they've got at least a month.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 15 minutes <br> didn't take very long </br></br>  <br>They weren't sure that Eren was the coordinate by that time, and knew that he would be handed to MP eventually if Annie failed.</br>  <br> they know Eren was a shifter by then so that's another lead <br>Yeah but Bert could stay either in the MP or the SL and he would just be additional help, since Reiner and Annie covered both positions. He probably wanted to go to the MP but decided to stick with Reiner.</br></br>  <br>Fair point but one of them should still keep an eye on him, since there were three of them.</br>  <br>I have this from some time someone requested it. Is that anon still around?<br><br> This shouldn't be banneable, right? </br></br></br>  <br> Getting the coordinate is the priority. <br>They weren't sure Eren had the coordinate then, infiltrating the MP is a good way to get closer to the Reiss.</br></br>  <br>They still stopped breaking the walls after finding out Eren is a titan, so they must have thought he's important. Infiltrating the MP was still a plan, but one of them should have stayed back to monitor Eren.</br>  So BR wanted to bring Historia with them because they though she could be the coordinate too.<br> Very important to the church. <br>Something is still missing on Historia's story.</br></br>  <br>But I still don't get what is "that".</br>  <br>What was this whole arc about again?</br>  <br>Yeah I'm not arguing that they needed to monitor Eren too, just that they needed to cover all the bases.</br>  <br>Coordinate?</br>  <br>I don't think they want her because she's the coordinate, but they know she's a Reiss so she has access to helpful information.</br>  <br> Something is still missing on Historia's story. <br>Weren't they referring to her being a Reiss? WC is under the Reiss after all.</br></br>  <br>They though that, if Eren wasn't, Historia could be.<br><br><br>They said coordinate two times before that normally, and then Bertholdt say "that".</br></br></br></br>  <br>What I don't get with this is why Bert went with Reiner. Did he change his mind on the last minute? He wanted to join the MP before and he was really upset when he joined the SL. All bases were already covered, as you said.</br>  <br> They said coordinate two times before that normally, and then Bertholdt say "that". <br>He said "Christa, the coordinate, AND that" which means they're three different things. "That" is not the coordinate.</br></br>  <br>Perhaps, but I still don't get the reason for this, why want to kill Historia if she's the last Reiss child?</br>  <br>If Reiner was already going delusional before that then he needed to stay with him. And Annie's the loner type too. <br><br>No matter how much Bert likes Annie, he's better off teamed with Reiner.</br></br></br>  <br>No, he said "Annie, Krista and THAT." And they already have Eren.</br>  <br>Huh, you're right. I still get the feeling that he didn't mean the coordinate with "that", maybe because they already had Eren who they suspected to be the coordinate.</br>  <br>She's a dirty bastard. It's completely understandable if others were opposed to her being made the official heir, preferring if Rod just made more legit babies with someone suitable.<br><br>Isayama didn't really reveal the internal structure of their faction so we don't know for sure.</br></br></br>  <br>And he also said Krista's name, who were another suspect to be it. So he doesn't mean the coordinate by "that".</br>  <br>They answer only to Rod though, it's weird they would want to do something against his will.<br> Inb4 Kenny was a traitor <br>Only Kenny was.</br></br></br>  <br>I still don't think they suspected her to be a coordinate, just an important person with valuable information.</br>  <br> They answer only to Rod though <br>The way I see it, just because Rod is the head doesn't mean he can blithely disregard the proper way to do things. Like kings in the real world, tradition and propriety are important. He's not the coordinate holder, too, so it's not like his word s God.<br><br>Still, he had enough power to spare Historia and get his way in the end.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, remember the scene where Hanji showed Eren his tooth. It doesn't vanish.</br>  <br>Not the one who requested it, but anyways nice job anon</br>  <br>What hips?</br>  <br>If it's not eaten by a titan, and didn't vanish, where did it go? Is Isayama just tricking us to think it's important?</br>  <br>That means you'll never starve as long as there's a shifter around, great.</br>  <br>That's beautiful anon</br>  <br>It just stayed there, why would a titan eat it? Titans only eat living humans.</br>  <br>looks like that</br>  <br> inb4 finger eating BR doujin </br>  <br>I'm not saying a titan would eat it. If it stayed there it would've been picked up by someone clening the place.</br>  <br>Probably. Either way I doubt it's important.</br>  <br> if we have Krista it should make the search much easier <br>Sounds like they thought having Hisu would help them find the coordinate, not that she is the coordinate.</br></br>  <br> mfw there's actually a doujin of it <br>Shit, I was just joking.</br></br>  <br>It was burnt along with the rest of the bodies. <br>That bone shard Jean was holding when crying about Marco was actually from Eren's arm.</br></br>  <br>That's disgusting.</br>  <br>Ha, that was my request. Yeah I'm still around.<br>Version I have doesn't have her hands and feet though, so thanks for posting that.</br></br>  <br>Damn I can't find it now, it was, uh, fun.</br>  <br>Nah don't try man it's bad enough I know it exists.</br>  Why is this manga full of insane people?  <br><br>Does that also make the doujin where  Bert kept Reiner's severed hand to fap  relevant?</br></br>  <br>Imagine living in a world where people were genocided by naked giant retards, you'd go insane too</br>  <br> Oh, you kept my severed hand to touch yourself. That's cute. </br>  So, spoilers when?<br>Last time they were leaked later since Mangakansou couldn't leak anything anymore.</br>  <br>We have to wait until CR release or Mangapanda to magically get it</br>  <br>We always get legit text spoilers around the 3rd-4th, so that's when. Most of them will be fake but the legit ones will be among them. Images on the 5th-6th, chapter on the 7th usually.</br>  <br>Dreamfag  a.k.a. Isayama  could post spoilers between 3rd-5th</br>  <br>I thought his spoilers were never accurate.</br>  <br>Unless dreamfag makes false predictions, he's not Isayama. He also changes his predictions with each new chapter.</br>  <br><br>Only when someone tries to impersonate him. His spoilers were 100% on spot last month.</br></br>  <br>I wasn't talking about the spoiler, but about the small comment after his legit spoilers. Most of the time the comment/prediction is wrong and looks just a prediction of any random reader.</br>  Is Bert retarded?  If you're into board game, a SnK one will be introduced tomorrow.
