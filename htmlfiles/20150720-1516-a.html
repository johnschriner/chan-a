[ Damnit underwater I just wanted episode three.<br><br>Where do you guys go to download this stuff other than the subbers directly? I just want good quality, and good subs.</br></br>  https://www.google.com/search?q=ani<wbr>me+torrents<br>Holy shit, results.</br></wbr>  <br> It's ok, personally I just read the manga for the suffering that's going to be coming up. The biggest negative is just powerlevels and the "humans wage war against magical race and segregate them" shit that nips always do.</br>  <br> just a bit. </br>  <br>oh god damnit Horrible subs, im an idiot</br>    So how hard would the post-timeskip version of this crew beat up th current Strawhat crew? Also rociante a dead  Secret Trafalgar D. Water Law a sad thread   what if kaidos frut is a lion king of beasts?  <br> One Piece Shippuudeenn <br><br>As if Oda would write or plan another series after one that will take 25-30 years to fully complete. If we see any offspring from any of the Straw Hats, the best we would probably get is a little epilogue.</br></br></br>  <br>Not necessarily another series, I mean just not a continuation of one piece. I'm pretty sure he still wants to do a manga based on robots when he completes one piece.</br>  <br>he also seems to be an airy man of few words<br><br>I like it<br><br> Dragon that's your son?? <br> &gt;ye </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>we could always see brooks possile kids that may already exist</br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #7<br><br>Previous thread: <br><br><br>Take it easy.</br></br></br></br></br>  Takane Shijou from Idolm@ster wearing the outfit of Milla's spirit form from Tales of Xilia.  <br>idk what im doing</br>  <br>When will you wrap my waifu in your large coiling body, tightening steadily around her, squeezing all the air from her lungs until she eventually dies of oxygen deprivation then dislocate your jaw, carefully taking all of her into your maw and slowly taking her into your gut?</br>  <br>Don't worry, it looks fine! She looks so great in the outfit, it's exactly what I wanted. 'Dem lovely thighs~<br>Thanks for doing my request, and I hope you have a great week!</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>thx bros. yeah it's freehand.<br><br>np. glad you liked it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why didn't they just call this Circle Jerk - The Anime?<br><br>I'm getting tired of all the dick sucking in this show.</br></br>  <br>/tg/ things.</br>  Can anyone tell me if there's a better meido than Lupusregina?<br><br> Protip: you can't. <br>Have a picture of best meido.</br></br></br>  <br>doesn't Ainz already have one though, the wishing ring.<br><br>"I wish this fucker would stop with the self-rez"</br></br></br>  <br>And what makes her good? Seems like a crazy berserker bitch.</br>  <br>That could work, if the other guys rezing ability isn't world class.</br>  Explain to me why Prisma Illya is in it's 3rd season while Tsukihime has yet to get an anime?    <br>To be fair, he looked weird in the original, but his design grew on me. They're going a little too hard with the "bad boy" stereotype here, but it might look better without the chain.</br>  <br>The problems I had with it were mostly technical.<br><br>There's no real way to get around the fact you have to click to move the text along, right? I tried an auto-clicker but it doesn't like scenes with things like THIS CHAIR.</br></br></br>  <br>Christ, not even /r9k/ is capable of this.</br>  <br>I just recline in my chair pressing one of the enter buttons or space bar, but it would have been nice to be able to watch in my bed instead. That's another feature I'll be looking forward to when the remake comes out.</br>  You better do what she says, /a/.  <br>Suit Seibah is best Seibah.</br>  <br>this tbh</br>    <br>Bullied Seibah is best Seibah. She's shit and needs to be reminded of it at every opportunity.</br>  <br>I care only about combat effectiveness, not clothes. &gt;_&lt;<br><br>I guess suits can be designed to be easy to move around in<br><br>I'm not callous, I'm just in a lot of trouble :(</br></br></br></br></br>   Precure Thread <br> Muh Twilight-sama </br>       no more hidamari poka poka   I guess it's yellow time  <br> Kanade <br> yellow </br></br>  QUALITY THREAD  <br><br>there are a few sound webms that get posted in /wsg/ a lot</br></br>  Is this a QUALITY thread or a Love Lab thread?<br><br>Anyway: the most infamous Quality of all time<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=j35<wbr>UTxKV9YI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like it was fixed in the BD. Nice catch though!</br>  <br>That Dogakobo quality of animation.</br>  <br><br>Why is PlaMemo so laggy and jerky compared to these?</br></br>  It's finally over. Ending was satisfactory, but the overall show was still shit.  <br>I thought the first key visual looked really nice but only as a pretty key visual. I didn't think it would actually look like that in the series and man did it not work</br>  <br> How do I get through Sailor Moon R? I want to enjoy it but it's somehow not nearly as entertaining as the first season. <br><br>R is the one season where I'd honesty recommend just skipping half the episodes, you can come back later if you are really curious. The show picks up several episodes from now and gets progressively better as you get through S, which ends up surpassing everything else so far.<br><br> Maybe the 9 month break since I last saw an episode will help. <br>I understand. I did the same thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I thought the first key visual looked really nice <br><br>Same here, that actually got my hopes up.</br></br></br>    <br>Crystal did get the long hyperextended fingers correct.</br>  This is a Boy    <br>Who is this semen demon?</br>  <br><br>Is it High School of the Dead?</br></br>  <br>Check.</br>  <br>Huge breasts are cute.<br>Checkmate.</br></br>  DIE好き!  <br>How are they finding such cute clothes?</br>    <br>http://gakkougurashi.com/special/sp<wbr>ecial0002.html<br><br>What's Chiyo saying about Kurumi?</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>No Kei?</br>  <br>Those fucking star thigh highs.<br><br>Miki went from worst to best.</br></br></br>  Hello is this Pizza Hut?  <br>Half of purple eyes is garbage trying to be funny half is ok but tbh not worth</br>  <br>Nigga I was here the day the last episode aired. My mistake was not fallowing it along with it and falling behind or not creating some kind of filter to prevent all the fucking threads that would pop up whenever a new episode aired with massive spoilers</br>   (OP) #<br><br>No. This is dog.</br></br>  @128328345 #<br><br>:^^)</br></br>  No, this is Aku  How will 8man resist final form Yukino?<br><br>vol. 11 ch. 9 translation http://pastebin.com/23mRRdEi</br></br>  <br> actually trying to guilt by association on an anonymous imageboard <br><br>Reddit please fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>I want the full scan of that one.</br>  <br>I really wish that doujin was about Tobe and Iroha, not Hikki and Yui.</br>    <br><br>And maybe you're right. It's not something we can take as gospel, but it's a possibility. I would tend to think that the author would have put something in there to let us know that's what was discussed if it were true. But I really think Wataru just didn't care enough about how realistic it was for Haruno to be keyed in on that. She already has shown an extraordinarily high degree of perceptiveness, beyond real life human beings.<br><br>Harunofags are just really insecure. You make one minor little criticism of her characterization and they get incredibly bent out of shape. I actually like Haruno. Although I don't view her motives as being as clear-cut in Yukino's best interest as some Haruno defenders believe.</br></br></br></br>  I don't understand this anime at all. First it claims to have an internal logic. The anime clearly establishes that servants are much more powerful than any human. Why does Shirou then defeat Archer, who clearly is the most op servant? He never had any significant training. Back in middle ages they trained knights from small children. Compared to even normal knights Shirou is a fucking nobody. And what is this this bullshit about his body being made swords? So is he a human born out of a woman or is he some just some sort of deus machina? This anime is like first explaining the rules of chess and then Shirou just flips over the chess board and says he won.  <br>Because TM is a company that became known for VNs primarily, if you want to get into the franchise you should be expected to read the VN.<br><br> Why do VN fags tell people to read VNs if they want to talk about the VN franchise? <br><br>Stop asking stupid questions.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't like Kerry's flashback the first time. It was simply boring aside from seeing the origin bullets, I just couldn't care too much about him. He seemed mysterious at first but the anime spent all the time wanking muh King of knights that when he finally got spotlight I was uninterested already.</br>  <br>It really didn't two full episodes. Got whiplash when the story got back on track.</br>  <br>Because it's the source material.<br><br>It's like when people tell you<br> Read the fucking manga <br><br>Reading the source material is what's recommended most of the time, for everything. And you don't even have to play the porn version if it gets your jimmies rustles.<br>That was retconned by RN and you can find it anywhere with all the cool vita openings and shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know some people didn't like the Kerry episodes, but for some reason I really enjoyed them. When I think of Zero, that part is one of the parts that spring to mind first for me.<br><br>I do think it kind of hurt the pacing. It doesn't help that the episode right after the two parter was actually pretty slow too.</br></br></br>  How do they manage to fuck it up this bad in Logos? I know it's popular to hate Aquarion, but it was never boring. Where is<br><br> GO TIGHT <br><br>Where is<br><br> OSORE <br><br>???</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Wanting more Fudo after the dog shit </br>  <br><br> Zessica is cat <br>Truly best girl.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This image is infinitely funnier now that I know the It's Always Sunny reference.</br></br>  <br>More like Buddy Complex 2.</br>  <br> thinking silver hair isn't Mikono </br></blockquote>]
