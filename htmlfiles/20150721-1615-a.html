Time for best girl!  <br>What a faggot.</br>  <br>Not soon enough.</br>  <br>Nothing much to talk about.</br>   this scene getting animated <br><br>Just a shame it got interrupted so fast with Papi's suicidal flying.<br>There is far, far too little sexy-time between Darling and Miia.</br></br></br>  <br>After slime and fish.</br>  <br>Gotta be cut down so there is more facetime for the other girls.<br><br>Remember episode one, Anon. It's all you got.</br></br></br>  <br>Because Miia is a rapist.</br>  xth for cute  Shake-O keychains<br><br>My wallet weeps.</br></br>  <br>More keychains?<br><br>Are these random too?</br></br></br>  I want to deepthroat Miia's tongue   YFW Monster Musume is produced by fucking Toho, the company that made Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, and Ghidorah <br> yfw Tsuburaya Productions, makers of Ultraman, Mirrorman, Fireman and others have their own Monster Musume novel idea <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=i1G<wbr>n8T0iSQc</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Truly, we live in an age of Monster Girls, /a/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd like one of those, but at the same time I am not a big enough weeb to have stuff like that.</br>  <br>I'm working on the 3D modelsfor them, if I could sneak and use the 3D printer at my job I'd be the happiest</br>  <br>These are so fucking expensive.</br>  <br>Hope they turn out good.</br>  <br> 3D printer </br>  <br>Don't you need like... pictures of them from all sides to do a 3d print?</br>  <br><br> that scene without nipples <br> the whole anime without nipples <br>I can't find a reason to care</br></br></br></br>  <br> Being this retarded </br>  <br>yes, hence, I'm working on the 3D models</br>  <br>Ah. Make sure you give Tio her chibi P cups.</br>  <br>Hound you filthy manlet, TF did get the Japanese raws of ch35? 2 days ago she said she's going to get that on sunday.</br>  The lack of best butt in this thread is disgusting  <br>I prefer papibutt</br>  <br> LACK OF FAT ASS <br> DISGUSTING <br><br>Nigga what?</br></br></br></br>  When is Zombina getting animated?<br><br>Honestly the only thing I'm excited for is the MON squad getting animated and maybe Rachnera.</br></br>  <br>I agree, not sure why you posted Polt though</br>  <br>Not yet.</br>  <br> calling the fit Kobold girl fat <br><br>are you even trying, anon?</br></br></br>  <br>Hey, I can answer your question for you!<br><br>The raws themselves came out on Sunday. I'd assumed we'd have public LQ raws out by now, but it doesn't look like it, from as much as I've seen or heard.<br><br>I've ordered my magazine, and while I'm hoping it'll get to my place before Thursday, most likely it'll be delivered while I'm out of town, which means no HQ raws/live TL for a good week and a half, sadly.<br><br>However, once I get everything in, it should only take a day or two for the chapter itself to come out, so you don't have to worry about another three-month delay.<br><br>I shouldn't have any kind of delay for next month, though. Hooray!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I propose a water (or jelly) filled bladder in a daki shape. When shall we begin?  <br>Thanks for the update.</br>  <br>TF   where did you buy the magazine? actually I can only find expensive shit instead of the price when the adaptation was just a myth  </br>  <br>I used to import it from Amazon.jp + a forwarding company, but the forwarding company took so long to process things (2+ weeks?!) that I switched over to CD Japan not too long ago, and I've been really happy with their shipping times.<br><br>Usually I get the magazine in 3-4 days after I order. They've been really helpful when I fuck up and send it to the wrong place, too.</br></br></br>  Rachnee and Cerea are best girls  An ogre is blending into this thread, can you spot her?  <br>she's like an onion</br>  <br> Yes. <br><br> All girls are best girls though. </br></br></br>  <br>Nope <br><br>  mero a shit A SHIIIIITTTT <br><br>  sorry TF I know you self insert on her  </br></br></br></br></br>  Obviously Lala is best.  <br> Rachne and Cerea  and Suu  happen to be even better than the rest. <br><br>Hi-res when?</br></br></br>  <br><br>High tier: &gt;2 legs<br>Mid tier: 2 legs<br>Low tier: &lt;2 legs</br></br></br></br>  <br>/r ing mermaids are quick to recognize lewdness, i know you have it</br>  <br>Do not trust this poster.

I just woke up not even 15 minutes ago.</br>  What days does this air? I'm impatient    <br>It's a force of habit and/or running gag at this point.</br>  <br><br>"Video"</br></br>  <br>Um, so what did Papi do?</br>  <br>Thank you faggot!</br>  <br>By the way, I know someone's been archiving the videos, but has anyone been archiving the character's monologues after the videos?<br><br>They're pretty interesting, and I'd like to have a stab at translating them one day.</br></br></br>  <br>Sounds like some frolicking in the back with Miia and Cerea.<br><br>With sexy results.</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you based TF</br>  <br> back <br><br>Bath.</br></br></br>  <br>Every thread. Your commitment to Smith is admirable, and a little creepy.</br>  This thread lacks two things:<br> Second  best girl<br>And freedom<br>I intend to fix both</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why can't Papi frolick on Cerea's back?</br></br>  Darling a best though.  <br>So if only raptor type harpys are eagle and falcon like what type of bird is papi? Blue Jay? Blue Bird?</br>  <br>Dozo<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf<wbr>Os5OJUEr3nocqPluh-eJA/videos</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Awesome, thanks!</br>  <br>Evisceration</br>  <br>Read the OP TF.</br>  <br>Those are the trimmed ones that cut off the monologues, though. It looks like <br> has the full videos with the monologues.</br></br>  <br>Why'd you post a picture of a starfish?</br>    <br> I feel like I'd enjoy this show more if the girls were just girls and not also animals. </br>  <br>Suddenly I'm imaging a vulture girl for some reason...<br><br>But yeah, Papi would be some common variety of bird.</br></br></br>  <br>I would say blue bird as the blue jay is pretty much the jagoffs of the bird world. They suck.</br>  <br>But those from that list  include all the advertisement and shit, I'm wrong? (don't know shit about japanese).</br>  <br>That is what she wants</br>  <br>What I've noticed of these daily vids is they have a video, then an advertisment with the OP song, then a good 1-6 minute monologue with a girl.<br><br>I haven't listened to all of them, but I'd eventually want to translate them. From what I heard from Cerea's when I skimmed through it, it was something about helping you fall asleep. I'll have to take another listen.</br></br></br>  <br>From what I've picked up, it's like that with the Miia and Papi as well (with Papi falling asleep to her own counting)</br>  <br>Gimme until tonight, anon, and I'll have them all translated and put up on nyaa</br>  <br>I think they're just counting sheep, like this: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=T4t<wbr>Ii2Q_LWc,</wbr>  [ ] assuming I'm thinking about the right video.</br>  <br> one team has the 2 best girls <br><br>too easy</br></br></br>  <br> tumblr nose </br>  <br> tumblr </br>    <br>STOP</br>  <br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128359208 </br></br>  <br>Tumblr noses are all red.

There are no less than 4 fat related threads at all times of the day.</br>  there is one major issue with monster musume since it got animated <br> every time I go to watch the first episode I end up thinking about papi's butt and masturbating then forgetting to watch the first episode </br>  <br>Why did you use Flash? Why not Illustrator? Unless you were going to do something with it you made that wayyy harder on yourself then you could have.</br>  <br>Forgivable. I think most people here would be guilty of that.</br>  <br>Thats a good problem to have.  Papi's not even in the first episode though </br>  <br>Because flash is 10x easier for me to use than illustrator. I've only used illustrator to ace my graphic design class in high school and never touched the program again. Then again I only use the line tool + free transform tool almost exclusively. Time consuming, sure, but terribly easy.</br>  <br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hDH<wbr>XFBP-9HQ</wbr>  [ ]<br>My heart.Truly the best way to Miia's heart is to feed her all the eggs  and be Darling. </br></br></br></br>  Oy.  <br>As long as you translate them in a speedy fashion instead of dragging your feet under the guise of 'quality' (because how much touch up do these pages really need?) <br><br>Good.</br></br></br>  <br>They do actually need a lot of touching up to look nice, but again, after our staff shuffling, it shouldn't take more than a few days to get it out this time! The biggest hold-up is with getting raws this month.<br><br>If there are any Japan/East Asia anons who can pick up the magazine and provide good quality 300dpi scans, we could probably get it out this week!</br></br></br>  Does Mero's mom pop up in the latest chapter? Does she look like this?  Lala needs more art in my opinion  <br>Fuck off.</br>  Hmm. Next event for the game was due 2 hours ago. Maybe they ran out of ideas for a bit.  <br>Yup.</br>  I need to fuck Rachnera  <br><br> Darlings birthday <br> The girls can't really leave the house alone to go birthday shopping for him, so they decide to make something on their own <br> Lala figures she'll try and make him something too <br> But she can't really think of anything <br> She finds an empty tucked away in a closet with a bow on top <br> Later, Lala stumbles up to darling without her head, holding the gift box <br> With a hole cut in it </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> she finds an empty gift box <br>I fucked up. I'm sorry, thread.</br></br>  <br>Oh jeez <br>It's too late for this</br></br>  <br> Darling's birthday <br><br>This needs to be an actual chapter</br></br></br>  <br>And the joke is that they are a day early, and do everything when it isn't his birthday.</br>  <br>yeeees, i made this specifically 'cause it seemed like no one could grasp when the anime airs, glad to see it going around</br>  <br>Fill us up, with jello goodness.</br>  <br>Just fuck a waterbed.</br>  Figures when???  Such a lewd head.  <br><br><br><br> We will never get to see Lala's Lalas <br> She will never have another issue dedicated to her <br> She is just a plot device now to keep Darling alive. <br>At least she's going to be the real winner in the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> His birthday is the next day <br> The girls all forget about trying to get him real gifts and try to have sex with him as a "gift" instead <br> Darling wakes up one morning <br> Feels something at the foot of his bed <br> It's Lala's head and what appears to look like blood is covering his sheets <br> Whole scene is a reference to The Godfather <br> Darling briefly freaks out until he realizes it's Lala <br> She claims her body had wine but spilled it <br> She asks if he'd like help with his morning wood <br> He rolls her off the bed </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> all me <br>I post too much Lala.</br></br>  <br>BAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I could so see that.</br>  <br>I feel like Cerea needs to get wine splashed on her as well, if we're going for the Godfather pastiche.</br>  <br> Lala picks up her head and walks out <br> Cerea makes some kind of remark <br> Lala splashes the last of the wine on her head </br></br></br>  <br>Darling's birthday needs to be on the next full moon.</br>  Someone care to explain to me what the fuck the whole Lala thing? Is she a god of death or no? What was that "adolescent thing" about? I'm really confused.  <br>I bet she gives great  anal </br>  <br>Jello is for eating   out  </br>  <br>I want to  sniff her ass </br>  I really want Lala to turn into a voyeur type. All the other girls try to forcefully do it with Darling, but she likes to watch him as he showers, or while he sleeps.<br><br> They go to the hot springs again <br> Lala holds her head up so she can look over the wall dividing the men and women baths </br></br></br>  <br> Lala can give you a footjob while sucking your dick at the same time <br><br>Is Lala the true masterrace?</br></br></br>  <br> footjob </br>  <br><br> team <br><br>A team for what?<br>Stealth Infiltration? A SWAT Raid?<br><br>Whatever it is, probably Miia and Mero.<br>Not only my favorite girls (excluding maybe Rachnera), but they'd have both any type of Land or Water Terrain covered.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just an example. Imagine the possibilities.</br>  <br>Both at the same time sounds like it would be awkward to perform. Try to give a footjob and her head gets in the way, try to give a blowjob and the feet get in the way.<br><br>Here's a better idea<br> She can sit on your face and give you a blowjob at the same time </br></br></br></br>  <br>You can kiss her whilr pounding it from the back. <br>You can carry her head around in your backpack for mobile blowjobs.<br>Lala best.</br></br></br>  <br>how would she do that without kicking herself in the face</br>  <br>That's part of the fun, anon.</br>  <br> Lala "accidentally" drops her head over the wall <br> lands on darlings lap <br> extreme blushing </br></br></br>    <br> She can sit on your face and give you a blowjob at the same time <br>Any woman can do that, virgin.<br>69</br></br></br>  <br>I understand that. But face sitting isn't quite the same as 69.<br><br> You can get in much deeper with face sitting, I've found. </br></br></br>  <br>I don't even know what to tell you. You're so stupid I'm hurt.</br>  <br>One more reason I like tall girls, anon...</br>  Just watched the first episode. <br>Miia seems like...a bit of an airhead.</br>  <br>If the wall is low enough for that to work, Cerea or Miia can already do that with a lot less effort. Lala and Polt are only about 157/158.</br>  <br> &gt;tfw 193cm<br> tfw hard to find girls close being as tall as you </br> <br><br> Lala is 158cm <br>Jesus she's short.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, you don't understand. It's an angle and weight centre problem. Isn't facesitting if there's no sitting, you see?</br>  <br> short <br>She's packed.</br></br>  <br>There is an entire chapter on this dilemma in Prison School, you know.</br>  Mero &gt; Miia &gt; Suu &gt; Papi &gt; Ranchnee &gt; Cerea  Lala = Suu &gt; The rest  Polt is number wan  <br><br>Miia can hold you in an near-infinite number of positions.</br></br>  The very breast  <br><br> dat beautiful blonde mane <br><br>I approve.</br></br></br></br>  <br>watch the next one, fall in love with Papi</br>  <br>Hound I thought you were all about Tio. Did you jump ship again?</br>  <br>I'm on team Tall Girls.</br>  <br>So far it looks like Cerea &gt; Miia = Papi</br>  <br> tfw 6"5' <br>muh giant bro<br>I know your pain well, shit is awful.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd reply with a <br><br> horse pussy <br><br>edit, but nay I have none.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> horse pussy <br>That's the best part.</br></br>  <br>Mah nigga.</br>  Racing episode when?  <br><br>She's not an air-head.<br>She's just passionate.<br><br>You want an air-head, that's Papi.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I want to  go bowling with  Lala.</br>    <br>I want  to play catch with  Lala</br>  <br><br>What is she singing in this clip?</br></br>  <br>She seems to be the type to act on pure emotional impulse without actually thinking about what she's doing.<br>It does make her kinda cute though.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Tfw smaller than both of you(probably not Hound), but living in Asia. Women 170 and up seem to be in the highest percentile around here. Or they go for 155-165 manlets.</br></br></br>  <br>Just to let you guys know, I usually add the new videos a couple hours after they are posted.<br><br><br>Here's another playlist for the uncut versions.</br></br></br></br>  I'm at chapter 20 now, how many more girls are going to be introduced and is 34 the last translated chapter?  <br>35 by August, and so far seven is the largest harem's gotten to.</br>  Can't wait for tomorrow.    <br><br> She seems to be the type to act on pure emotional impulse without actually thinking about what she's doing. <br><br>To a degree, but even with that being said she STILL seems to put more thought into what she does before characters like Papi, or even Cera (who is on like her 5th or 6th wrecked-wall at this point).</br></br></br></br>  I kind of want Lala to sound like  Ranko Hata from Seitokai Yakuindomo   <br> Cerea's mom will never be real </br>  <br>You could include fishmom and the eventual octopussy.</br>   Arnold walks up to your preschool daughter  <br> Looking at the very depths of her little monster girl soul, and asks <br>    who is your daddy, and what does he do?  <br>Wat do?</br></br></br>  <br> Tell him his chopper is here. </br>  <br>I like her and all, but the whole Centaur culture thing was really off putting for me. Kinda wish they never explained it.  You will never see Cerea's mom interacting in a mother daughter way ;_;  </br>  I'm surprised this whole thing has been translated into actual paperback so fast to be honest.   You will never watch movies with Lala's head resting on your lap <br> You will never pop pieces of popcorn into her mouth as you watch <br> &gt;You will never try to refrain yourself from asking where the hell the food is actually going when she eats without her body </br></br>  <br><br>The Mom-chapters were legitimately some of the best and most gratifying times to be a Snek-fag.<br><br>Daily reminder that if Lamias determine you to be a worthy male, they abscond with you to their village where you are repeatedly made love to by a harem of beautiful, loving, passionate snake-women and kept as an adored communal concubine in an opulent desert palace.<br><br>If Centaurs determine you to be a worthy male, you get the privilege of literally sharing the bed with the woman you love, as she is railed by her brutish husband while you watch. If you are LUCKY, the two of you get to have your own affair where you cuckold an innocent Centaur man and get to live a secret relationship based on adultery and shame. Oh, and what sex you do get is Horse Pussy sex.<br><br>Not only are Lamias superior to Centaurs, but even Lamia CULTURE is superior.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kiki twins <br><br>Our mom says that our daddy is a real sex machine.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Every time she's eaten before without her head, she's dumping food into the neck-hole of her body.<br><br>That popcorn is just going to end up on your lap, Anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, right.<br><br> I want there to be a scene where the girls try to toss random small food into her neckhole </br></br></br>  <br> Team Tall Girls <br><br>A man who also has good taste. I knew I like you for a reason Hound.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Like a ring-toss?<br><br>Unless they are deadly accurate she's going to have food pinging off of her spinal-column, larynx, various neck-gore, etc.<br><br>Sounds painful.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Best digger, best booty.  I want to tickle centorea's ears  <br><br>What a weird spot for ears.</br></br>  <br>Oh fuck yeah. Maximum kek.</br>  <br><br> Cute perky Spider Loli <br> Slutty cynical woman <br><br>What went wrong?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Right, but it'd still be funny</br>  <br> horse pussy <br> a bad thing <br>Somebody didn't grow up on a farm~</br></br></br>  <br>How can horses be such strong runners with such tiny chicken legs?</br>  <br>I agree with what you said<br>and i'm a snek fag<br>but i still think bird culture is best<br><br>loving Monogamous relationship&gt;mindless sex with the best race&gt;literal shit&gt;horse culture</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>are those fucking horse spats</br>  So what does everyone think of NT13 so far?  It's okay tbh.  <br>Too fast, not enough introspection especially from the so called "heroine" of this novel.</br>  Kinda pointless.  It's just setting up suffering   Fukiyose confirmed for wearing thongs     Where can I download raw  Season 3 ever?  I'm dying.   <br>That it shows how great would it be if touma goes full edge.<br><br><br>imagine all those lethal tactics on a person.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Everything would be better if it it were edgier <br><br>Fuck off, Kerryfag.</br></br></br>  <br>It bothers me</br>  <br>6 BILLION PEOPLE DED OR YOUR HAPPINESS</br>  Misaki &gt; Misaka  Seemed bad at first glance but went unexpectedly smoothly.  <br>suffering and constant refusal to become god</br>  <br>Best NT so far<br>Even Misaka's scenes are fun to read</br></br>  <br>When will the illustrations get scanned god damn</br>  <br> mikoto  <br> heroine <br>She is simply bait for faggots to sell more.</br></br></br>  <br>When Haimura delivers casual Vento</br>  <br> The magic gods did nothing wrong <br> Touma who is slightly more dangerous and cunning is good, but full edge is still unappealing to me <br> nyang and HP are better than nephy as far as personality goes <br> I wish Kamachi took time to explain the individual powers of the gods and what they look like at full power <br> We got othinus and her only create powers and we got HP and his dirt magic <br> Mikoto getting btfo, but honestly even with her narrow view of the world I don't see why she would think that she important and should be considered even situation that she is ignorant in <br> Fiamma has a sick obsession with extremely long swords and must be stopped </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Fiamma has a sick obsession with extremely long swords and must be stopped <br>He is compensating for the size of his member.</br></br>  Soon.  <br>I wish Fiamma would obsess over my extremely long sword.</br>  <br>Where?</br>   10000 dead vs. 6 billion <br><br>Why is Accel so shit?</br></br>  <br> Touma who is slightly more dangerous and cunning is good, but full edge is still unappealing to me <br><br>Mindwipe when?</br></br></br>  It's shit. Everything that made this series good is gone.  <br>But does touma kill his enemies straight up? Nigga is pussy ass bitch.</br>  No accelerator means it's automatically shit, well besides NT9 though.  <br>If Accel was in Touma's shoes, he'd level up from that experience.</br>  What are the chances that touma is only going for kill moves because it is a magic god and wont do this on a lesser opponent. After seeing othinus come back from the god arrow he should know none of this will kill him.  Does accel know that the sisters test was bullshit? I don't recall it coming up.<br><br> it takes 128 level 5 misakas to get accel to level 6 <br> 500 kakines do nothing </br></br></br>  <br>He won't do none of this shit on other people like saints.</br>  <br>Well, yeah. I thought that was the idea.<br><br>Anything less than this would be completely worthless against a Magic God. Well, everything was worthless so far anyway, but it's the effort that counts. Holding back against someone who can't die and can recreate the world in an instant is stupid. Not to mention, he's already a corpse.</br></br></br>  <br> he's already a corpse. <br>I wonder if part of immortality thing has to do with the gods needed to kill themselves to get godhood. HP starved, nephy had her organs removed, Othinus hung herself.</br></br>  <br>Maybe this difference is caused by the networks not having the same structure ?</br>    <br>I like it.</br>  You guys at least all agree that NT9 was the best volume right?  <br>Pretty much is but I didn't like the end of it though, got really cringe worthy.</br>  <br>Misaki a shit.</br>  <br>Mikoto a shit.</br>  <br><br>Othinus a shit.</br></br>  <br>Olay Blueshake a shit</br>  <br>Frenda a shit.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Great thread people</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>This tbh.</br>  NYANG-NYANG A SLUT  <br> chinese vampire <br>Would Himegami be effective against her?<br>Not that it matters anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>I really like Akikawa Mie.</br>  <br> M-MUH LIQUID DIAMOND </br>  <br>Faggot please, it's<br> M-MUH PARENTS' BOND </br></br>   Mikotofags BTFO <br><br>Best novel.</br></br>  <br>I skim read whenever she comes up, i don't give a shit about her.</br>  <br>She's the true heroine of this volume.</br>  <br>I wish she had a character design.<br><br>Or did Haimura come up with one and we just have to wait for him to update his website?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think he did or we would have seen it in the spoiler images.</br>  <br>Faggot kamachi made by boy Fiamma get trashed so fuck this whole volume.</br>  <br>But he got trashed by Othinus, too in volume 8.</br>  <br>I'm fairly certain there's always some stuff he draws that doesn't make it into the actual volumes.</br>  <br>He went out doing some damage to Othinus. Here, the High Priest casually exploded him and continued his Tom &amp; Jerry routine with Touma and Biri.</br>  <br> liking Stiyl 2.0 </br>  <br>Alright you have a point. I also remember people saying Fiamma was dead because he hadn't shown up after unlike Ollerus.</br>  <br>Atleast he stabbed her though before that.</br>   misaka being slightly useful <br> some mentions of Misaki so she doesn't seem to be too easily forgotten like some other girls    coff itsuwa coff  <br> Aleister keeping everything in place from the shadows makes him look like he isn't just in full damage control against magic gods <br><br>only complaints are no othinus and no based kihara dog<br><br>  Kamachi you motherfucker give IB a power up already  </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why does things always go against him despite being broken as fuck?  <br>Dragons.</br>  <br>so far the dragon it's a teaser for the final reveal of IB's secrets<br><br>i'm talking more of stuff like the ability to pass/extend IB to other body parts temporarily <br><br>also there's forgotten stuff about the reference point of the world so IB could erase some layers of the world, and it was implied othinus used it to bring back Touma's world</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he got bullshited twice for being op<br> the he made overpowers him and takes over <br> accel can't redirect him because DM is bullshit and he can change the values on a whim <br> accel creates a way despite this even though he still can't into magic </br></br></br></br>   “Oh, how heartbreaking!! Beauty is the standard among standards of an Iga woman, yet this was enough for you to lose your self-control? Fine then. I, Kuruwa, shall retrain you from square one starting today!!” <br><br> “Please noooo! The seduction techniques of a legit kunoichi will only ensure I never trust a woman again!!” <br>So that's where Misaka's outfit in the dream came from.</br></br></br>  <br>Because the plot demands it.</br>  <br> oh shit my dad kind of got some weird shit and invoqued and angel <br> oh fuck some crazy dude from the catholic church started WW3 <br> oh man this crazy dude is even more powerful than god but loses because i'm weak as fuck <br> shit CJ this magic god can do anything but doesn't just kill me because reasons so i get to bullshit my way out and make her my doll sized waifu <br><br>fucking magic gods lose because magic gods are too powerful in this series, so go figure</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty great.</br>  <br>The plot armor of Accelerator is even more broken.<br>I mean seriously. Does alister turn the coffee he drinks into luck potions?</br></br>  It's alright I guess  Why does the Girl prostitute herself? Surely she must have been making good money from running with Kakine.  <br>Working as a mercenary for SCHOOL is just to make ends meet. Her true passion lies in pleasing old men.</br>  <br>The character was around volumes ago with illustrations and everything. You're almost as slow as Misaka.</br>  <br>Better than the previous two NT volumes. It's high time Misaak got major focus, and I'm liking what I see for her and what goes on in her interactions with Touma.</br>  <br>I didn't read the SS volumes.</br>  <br> Misaak  <br>You can't even spell her name right.</br></br>  Another Index fighter when? One's that not shit.  <br>?</br>  <br> Misaka will never ride a bike with you while holding tightly around your waist while running from a High Priest <br>Suffering.</br></br>  <br>Thank god. I'm not into violent electrocunts.</br>  It's bad. It needs more magic gods interactions and less Mikoto.  <br>Your loss.</br>  <br>Mikoto proving her cutest status with NT13.</br>  <br> cutest  <br><br>No. She wouldn't even enter into a top 10 of cutest Raildex girls.</br></br></br>  <br>Mikoto is number 1.</br>  <br>Not even cutest Misaka.</br>  <br> Mikoto is number 1. <br> number 1 <br> not mjolnir </br></br></br>  <br>Do vampires even actually appear throughout the entire series, excluding Himegami's flashback?</br>  <br>My opinion &gt; your opinion.<br><br><br>Mikoto at peak moe can be cuter.</br></br></br></br>  <br> not almighty Thor <br><br><br> peak moe <br><br>No such thing for her.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   butthurt morons still despise Mikoto because they want to fit in   <br> Most of the background characters are vampires hiding in plain view.</br>  <br>More like THK.</br>  <br> they aren't praising my waifu <br> that means they are despising her!  <br> that means they want fit in! <br><br>No wonder you Mikotofags are the worst fans.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that legit or are you just fucking with me?</br>  <br>Well it says in the novels outright that it was only an excuse to have the sisters distro'd.</br>  <br> I swear it on the name of St Germain.</br>  <br>It can't be helped. That comes with the territory for popular girls.</br>  <br>The amount of disguise is incredible.</br>  <br>Crowley already basically does whatever he wants. Why not just distro from the start with all 20k instead of waiting until half got killed?</br>  <br>That's a funny way of spelling Angelene.</br>  <br>Probably needed a cover.<br><br>20,000 clones sent out just because<br>vs<br>10,000 test subjects repurposed due to failed experiment</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know that the plot point is a bit weird, but my theory is that a certain amount of mental anguish or mindfucking is required to make the angels. Like Snapping in Mistborn.</br>  Who is the best girl and why is it Zappy Dan the Magnet Man?  <br>We've been over this. Best girl is Misaki.</br>  <br><br>Jr.</br></br>  qt pie incoming  <br>I bet Last Order's powers can't open wooden doors.</br>  <br>Because she's  shocking </br>    <br>vaslisa good old pervert immortal stand user</br>  <br>I like it. Seeing Mikoto getting BTFO is always great.</br>  <br><br>They really screwed up Shinobu's character design, didn't they?</br></br>  <br>Everyone was sad at how they didn't put in the fish eyes. It's part of the reason everyone doesn't like Nagai.<br>The other reasons are everything else he did to Railgun, like completely ignoring character personalities and abilities.</br></br>  http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/i<wbr>ndex.php?title=Toaru_Majutsu_no_Ind<wbr>ex:NT_Volume13_Chapter_4</wbr></wbr>  <br>Shit girl shit taste.</br>  <br>But he didn't post Mikoto.</br>  <br><br>Wow, don't visit the generals in so long and still not casual Vento? You should just give up by this point anon.</br></br>  <br>Is this the last chapter?</br>  <br>Seriously?<br><br>Hot damn, girl.</br></br></br>  <br>Not even in the top 10 for best girls.</br>  <br>Mikoto &gt; Othinus &gt; Index &gt; Misaki &gt; the rest<br><br>Japan agrees, don't bother them about it.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't care about it.<br><br>Science side volume when?</br></br></br>     The father with glasses and a comb-over raised his middle finger toward the collapsed thug. <br>Fuck yeah dads.</br>  <br>ALL HAIL JS06</br>  Left or right?  Did season 3 get announced yet?  <br>as always, no</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Where did you get this? Did you scan it? Please</br>  <br><br>I'd really like a season 3 though</br></br>  <br>That's a good scan. Where'd you get it?</br>  <br> ugly loli on the left <br><br>Definitely going with right.</br></br></br>  <br>Anime don't get Season 3s, anon.</br>  <br>Illustrations are up</br>  <br> for once, Touma didn't get the DFC to live with him <br> instead, he got the big breasted girl <br> Is this the end of Raildex as we know it?</br></br></br>  <br>JC staff are busy with better series.</br>  <br>Right, don't even need to think about it.<br>That ugly loli can rot for all I care.</br></br>  <br>Text is red so didn't know it was up already. Just clicked to see that it works.</br>  <br>But this is their best one.</br>  <br>The weird part was how inconsistent he was with that.<br>  Misaka paralyzed by drugs <br>  Everybody complaining about how she should have just used her powers to bypass the paralysis <br>  She does exactly that, AFTER studyman broke the USB drive <br>What the hell, Nagai?  Still looking forward to his and Okada's work on G-Tekketsu, Xenoglossia was pretty good as far as Sunrise mecha go. </br></br></br></br></br>   Chapter 4: End of an Unwinnable Battle — A.A.A. (2/13)   Man I'm behind but,<br> “We really can do anything now that the security lines are down. Damn. Maybe we should’ve checked through that broken vault a little more.” <br><br> As soon as he heard it, Kamijou Touma locked both wheels, bringing the acrobike to a rapid stop. <br><br> Powerful tension burned into the atmosphere. <br><br> “Why are you stopping!?” asked Mikoto from the back seat. <br><br> “When the building started flying? It sounds like that girl was caught up in the trouble that the High Priest…no, that we caused. I don’t know the details, but someone’s been taking advantage of the confusion.” <br><br> “…” <br><br> Tokiwadai Middle School’s Ace looked between two different points. <br><br> The first was the middle school girl surrounded by a group of college students. The second was the rampaging mummy charging their way. <br><br> Kamijou had to understand how dangerous their situation was. <br><br> He may have understood it far better than her since she had only gotten dragged into it. <br><br> But… <br><br> “Misaka, can I make one – just one – incredibly selfish request?” <br><br> “What is it?” <br><br> She urged him on even though she was pretty sure she knew what it was. <br><br> The boy gave the exact answer she had been expecting. <br><br> “I want to save that girl right this instant.” <br><br>MOTHERFUCKING KAMIJOU TOUMA</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nagai and Okada working on the same series </br>  This looks painful  <br> Index <br> better than anyone </br></br>  <br>His eyes...they look so dead now.</br>  <br> Poor thing is so broken by PTSD he can't even enjoy a good pair of breasts anymore.</br>  <br>Looks comfy to me. Touma's just dazed because<br>  Magic Gods everywhere <br>  My body hurts <br>  I want to go home </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah sales wise.</br>  <br>Can you post link?<br><br>Really now, because I get the standard red link page</br></br></br>  <br>Why are female magic gods such whores?</br>  <br>He's gay right?</br>  <br>It'll be interesting to see if they can handle a mecha drama series rather than a romance given their previous track record together (Toradora, AnoHana).</br>  <br> the worst poster on /a/ supports the best Raildex girl <br>God damn it.</br></br>  <br>I love how gone he looks in the illustrations<br>Its like he doesn't care any more</br></br>  <br>https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/<wbr>index.php?title=Toaru_Majutsu_no_In<wbr>dex:NT_Volume13_Illustrations</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Look at the hat</br>  <br> keep refreshing but it still wont load <br>why baka why, this shit didn't happen with written parts</br></br>  <br>Anyone else having problems with this link</br>  Bad end inevitable.  <br>If it's just stiff cloth like the edges of the sleeves it probably doesn't hurt much at all, maybe just a bit uncomfortable. If it's rigid, though, yeah, that'd be painful.</br>   “You’ve done too much, so I’m going to tell you something no one’s been able to before. It’s time you got what’s coming to you, High Priest!!”  <br><br>FINALLY</br></br>  <br>Me</br>  <br>It's working fine on my side though. Just let the other anons post the pics here.</br>  Even in the funny scenes he looks dead inside  <br>Anybody have the "triggered" picture with his face cropped in it?</br>  <br><br><br>https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/<wbr>index.php?title=Special:Contributio<wbr>ns/Ultranova17</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> Is that it? <br>Touma has seen some shit.<br> When is he losing all of his hair and becoming OPTM? </br></br></br>    <br>meant to link this</br>  <br>it fine</br>  Holy shit High Priest is about to become fucking nuked  <br>He is being pretty rash with this magic gods<br><br> “I said wait, Nephthys!!” <br><br> The next thing he knew, Kamijou had grabbed the bandages corresponding to the brown woman’s collar. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks anon</br>  <br>Left by far.</br>  <br><br>So he punching niggas yet or nah?</br></br>  <br> Cute DFC loli or old slutty hag <br>No brainer here.</br></br>  <br>Nah.</br>  So when will we get the scene that fucks over Kamikotofags? I'm waiting.  <br>Epilogue.</br>  <br>It doesn't exist.</br>  <br>In my dreams</br>  <br>Oh good.</br>  <br>too bad</br>   “Conservation of mass? I knew that. You left a big empty spot underground when you made the giant arms? I knew that. You were setting up a cruel bomb to make me suffer? I knew that. So! I was worried about it from the beginning!!”  <br>God damn Touma isn't letting anything slip by.</br>  <br> being this dumb </br>  <br>Right because she didn't try to fuck over Mikoto and isn't dead.<br><br>Can't wait for the magic god interactions with Othinus.</br></br></br>  <br> Kamikotofag desperate to save his ship that he probably only likes because of out of character doujins that aren't even that good </br>  <br>I want Mikoto to move on and accept being friendzoned.</br>  <br>Same. I really really do.</br>  <br>I'm just pointing out that there is no scene in which kamikotofags get btfo.</br>  <br>Why has he gone so soft now?</br>  <br> being a Kamikotofag </br>    <br>Dat Railgun</br>  <br> being this delusional <br>Your ship is over</br></br>  <br> Wrapping a wire around their neck and attaching it to a running helicopter blade. <br> Slamming into them at 60kph on a motorbike. <br> Soft <br>Anon what.</br></br></br></br>  <br> and isn't dead. <br><br>Isn't she another mummy, though?<br><br>That said, I think all Magic Gods had to literally die to earn their powers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He is into torturing his opponents now</br>  <br>Sure thing anon.</br>  <br><br>I thought that was Noukan?</br></br>  <br>Isn't that common with people who have been tortured? Reminder that Touma has been tortured for what may as well be an infinite amount of time</br>   High Priest getting BTFO <br> This feels so good. I have a fucking boner right now.</br>  <br>nope2 i am not. i mean someone dumb enough didnt realize there is plenty scene that fucks over kamikotofags</br>  <br>Touma became wise thanks to NT 9</br>  <br>Keep hanging on to a dead ship, then.</br>  <br> Still not dead <br><br>He can't even kill him with his own strength</br></br></br>  <br>Yea he's wrong. The Kamikoto ship was never afloat to begin with.</br>  <br><br>Ok.</br></br>  <br> Who cares? Touma and Academy City took a shit on his smugness.</br>  <br>This is true</br>  <br>Touma has been going full on keikaku for a while now, remember the Ichihanaran</br>  It's too bad Mikoto will never find happiness with a guy that isn't Touma.  <br> implying </br>  <br>It was a mass driver</br>  <br><br>Who else then?</br></br>  <br>That's okay though, it's better that she stays pure if she can't have Touma.</br>  <br>Anon please.</br>  <br> maybe if I post a reaction image my ship won't have sunk </br>  <br> 2015 <br> thinking PH cares about this <br>He isn't even salty about being nerfed and has enjoyed being damaged.</br></br></br>  <br>Touma won't be shit in the grand scheme of things</br>  <br>His punches were more lethal.</br>  <br>Ok.</br>  <br>Nah fuck that bitch my guy got two chicks now so she can piss off.</br>  You guys suck.<br><br>We get back-to-back scenes of Touma repeatedly and unambiguously using lethal force and strategy against an enemy for the first time in the series, and you instead want to participate in retarded shipping wars.<br><br>Shame on all of you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally who? Mikoto hasn't even properly met this guy. The only other guy that's introduced himself to her is Accelerator.</br>  <br>Etzali deserves better</br>  <br>Are you seriously refusing to accept that Mikoto herself has accepted that her and Touma are not happening?</br>  <br>Mikoto is involved, it's inevitable. Her entire character revolves around her love for Touma.</br>  <br>Anon please.</br>  <br>nigga his about to lunch a nigga up to space using his pikachu</br>  <br>Sure thing.</br>  <br><br>It's really what i find annoying of her character. its not her, its the Author.</br></br>  <br>You seriously thought /a/ would care about that?</br>  <br>Blame Mikotofags.</br>  I'm disappointed that we haven't had any interaction between Sphynx and Misaka-10032's black cat.  <br>I lost my shit at the mental image of Accelerator in a top hat and politely tipping it at me</br>  <br>Nah, it's everyone's fault.<br><br> Except for those of us who are just here for Kamachi's Wild Ride. </br></br></br>   Tfw touma still can't kill saints <br><br><br>Nigga needs to get his revenge on ollerus's chick.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Don't Make Me Get Up From This Chair-kun, Saten's Bowlcut Boyfriend, and Headband Girl are vampires <br><br>I'm so ok with this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least it's confirmed that Mikoto can, finally.</br>  <br>Fuck off, Ladylee, you're busy being experimented on in the Windowless Building.</br>  <br>No he doesn't. He deserved that beat down for thinking his shitty teenage dick was more important than keeping the world safe from a dangerous terrorist.</br>    <br>If we assume that there are absolutely no rules whatsoever, then it would be pretty easy for Touma to beat a Saint.<br><br>He has Accelerator on speed dial.</br></br></br>  <br>No he does for fucking losing to a women. That's embarrassing.</br>  <br>It doesn't happen in NT13. Deal with it.</br>  <br>Could Accelerator touch a Saint? I'm guessing yes because he can deal with an angel</br>  <br>He's lost to women multiple times. He even "lost" to Mikoto in NT10.</br>  <br> Tfw touma still can't kill saints <br>You need to pay attention because everything he did this volume is a counter to saints<br>Touma himself said so</br></br></br>  <br>Mikoto has accepted she won't get with Touma. When will Kamikotofags?</br>  <br>You're delusional.</br>  <br>Accelerator is far above Saints. He fought with Fuse Kazakiri and Gabriel before he even used wings.</br>  <br> He even "lost" to Mikoto in NT10 <br><br>It was so shitty that even Mikoto felt empty about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Anyone thinking Kamikoto still has a chance is delusional. I'd feel sorry for them, but they won't even accept their girl herself has accepted it and is likely to move on</br>  <br><br>Nice delusion.</br></br>  <br>But that beat down from ollerus's chick was the worst.</br>  <br>Go back to your shitty doujins that aren't even in character</br>  <br>I would like Mikoto to win, but it's been obvious since volume 1 that Index will win in the end. It's just how this kind of series goes.</br>  <br>Nice rebuttal.<br><br><br><br> ollerus's chick <br><br>Her name is Silvia.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A saint can't touch Accel</br>  <br>Touma can't even beat up hamazura though.</br>  <br>He got btfo in that fight though, he actually did worse than carissa and the other lady</br>  <br>To be fair not even Aleister can</br>  <br> wanting Mikoto to win at all <br>Why would you do that to her</br></br>  <br>I keep forgetting her name but somehow remember carissa, don't know why but yeah thanks for the reminder.</br>  <br><br>Quote it. You can't. <br><br>The realization Mikoto goes through in NT13 has nothing to do with that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No he didn't.</br>  <br>didnt he say that he would use the same shit he did to HP if he is chased by a saint?</br>  <br>Best ravens girl.</br>  <br/>  <br>Because it would make her happy.</br>  <br> Quote it. You can't. <br>Wait for it to be translated.</br></br>  <br>So desperate to keep your ship afloat when it was never afloat to begin with. Stop. It's over.</br>  When will someone just snipe Touma's head?  <br><br>But I thought you had proof that Mikoto gives up on Touma. Why don't you just quote it?</br></br>  <br>It would make Touma unhappy. Give him Itsuwa instead.</br>  <br>Yes he did, he jumped in and got the cheap shot that did nothing to gabe, then gabe slapped his ass down with the mini sweep. The only reason he wasn't killed is acqua stealing half of gabe's power. He did nothing against gabe and kazakiri got cheesed on because she is made of something he can easily vector.</br>  <br>When he is lucky enough<br><br>thats like a blessing to him now</br></br></br>  <br>So what you're saying is that he did fine against two beings far stronger than saints?</br>  <br>Nope.</br>  Egypt arc when?  <br>Wait for it to be translated.</br>  <br>When Mikoto is getting her powerup.</br>  <br>so never?</br>  <br>No he did terrible against one being far stronger than saints, he did good against gabe like misaka is doing good against HP. Kazakiri didn't even try to fight him.</br>  <br> No proof </br>  <br>It hasn't been translated yet, you massive faggot. When it gets translated I'll be happy to quote it shove your face in it</br>  <br>Are you retarded? It isn't translated yet.</br>  <br>So yeah, he's far stronger than Saints. It's not like they could do anything to him even without taking that fight into account. He's like the perfect counter for Saints.</br>  <br>I wouldn't call it BTFO buy by rule of thumb I can tell that Mikoto getting development now pretty much tells she isn't the end game girl.</br>  <br><br>Obviously you've already read it, so just translate it and post that passage here.

She's a lot more relatable than any of the other characters and, in my opinion, is just as funny as anyone else.</br></br>  Is the show going to pick up where it left off during season 3 in that the characters will still be 14?

So are they gay or straight?<br><br>I don't like this show because I want to have sex with the animated girls in it, I watch it because it's funny and cute.

For example, your favorite yuru a shit.</br>  <br>Just because I use an Akari image, doesn't mean she's my favorite yuru</br>  is it just me or is it super cute when any of the characters try to speak english? I wish they would do it more often  <br>That line was so adorable I can literally recall it off the top of my head everytime I think of Himawari. I hope Himachan can get more moments like that in season 3, I always feel like she gets the spotlight less often than the rest of the main cast.</br>  Never forget  thread is dead, might as well post Yui      Top left umaru is best umaru  me doing the kyoko  I want to pinch her cheeks and call her fat.  another umaru thread  <br>I want to punch her face and call her a shit.</br>  <br>Which cheeks?</br>   posting a gif     <br>I want to slap her and call her a lazy cunt.</br>  <br><br>That shit is hypnotic</br></br>  <br>Me in the middle.</br>  This is best Umaru.  <br>What the fuck are those things</br>  <br>Little sisters.</br>  <br> Meanwhile on /jp/ </br>  HI, IS THIS THE SHITPOSTING ANIME OF THE SEASON?  <br>Dance moves.</br>  <br>you rang?</br>  <br>Top left Umaru is best Umaru because her dancing technique is the best. It is subtle and self-contained yet embodies just as much, if not more excitement and passion than all the other dancing Umarus in this video. Top right Umaru is just jumping around, top middle Umaru looks like she's boxing and the others just don't have that subtle sexy groove as Top left Umaru does. The alpha male will naturally choose top left Umaru as his or her mating partner because her dancing technique is easy to perform, effective, non-intrusive, seductive and it highlights her intelligence.</br>  i want to touch umaru's cunny  <br><br>/a/</br></br>  This abomination doesnt look human, I would be freaked if I saw it.  <br>yes</br>  <br> Using a branded OEM desktop computer <br><br>Umaru a shit<br>A SHIT</br></br></br></br>  Can we kill it?<br><br>Please?<br><br>I don't care how, just kill it.</br></br></br></br>  I'll be glad when the hype for this show dies.  <br>I'll be glad when you get some taste.</br>  <br>I think I spotted an Umaru thread on her screen</br>  <br>I'm the only one allowed to do that fuck off.</br>  saving umaru from page 10  Do I have some kind of problem for loving this anime?  ITT The most badass moments of manga  This has to be my favorite moment in the entire series.  <br>I remember when One Piece used to be great, good old times.</br>  <br><br>Fuck, I want this to continue so bad.</br></br>  <br><br>I don't. Rud killing himself was too much for me.</br></br>  <br>source please?</br>   discuss pic related   <br>A guy like him wasnt going to last in the Marines for long.<br>But I bet he´s gonna keep his rank for raisins.</br></br>  <br><br>They cant fire him just like that. He will get some sanctions but they wont kick him out</br></br>  <br>Is there a chapter this week, or is everything on break?</br>  <br>His ultimatum is either get fired and take his entire marine regimen to become pirates/revolutionaries OR become Smoker 2.0. Either works for me</br>  <br>One Piece has no chapter this week. Not sure about the rest of JUMP.</br>  Dumping chapter 186.<br>Reminder that Usopp has a<br> meteor hammer <br>The only other character with a "meteor" named attack appear in this order<br>1.

Luffy already invited him and Jinbe pretty much said he is joining when he meet Luffy again. <br><br>Unless something bad happen to Jinbe he is 100% bound to join the crew at some point.</br></br>  <br><br>Small price to pay for a Monet</br></br>  <br> Mr. JUSTICE getting BTFO <br>yes, more of this</br></br>      <br> Monet will never poop on your car </br>  <br> Unless something bad happen to Jinbe <br>Jinbe death confirmed</br></br>    <br> mfw </br>  Akainu and the 5 old farts are too far detached from reality, they don't even give a fuck when their own people are suffering under the sichibukai.  <br>Someone please appreciate Jean Bart, too. I don't even know why Law asked him to join.</br>  <br>Jinbe is too strong in water. He can command whales which is like a nerfed Poseidon and literally make knock up streams. If Akainu set sail in an armada Jinbe could beat him + his fleet solo.

I know I am!, Law and Luffy took out Doffy and are now going in for the kill on Kaido which means Kidd has equal game on Shank's head. <br><br>RIP 2 Yonkos, I wonder who's taking Big Mom's place though, I doubt she's even worth the effort, her fat ass will die before anyone can kill her.<br><br>I love Luffy's generation, WORST GENERATION FOR THE FUCKING WIN!</br></br></br></br>  <br> There are people who seriously think Derossa was HALF as good as Alabasta  <br><br> There will also be retards who'll respond to this post by going "No, it's even better" <br><br>Marineford Babies are the worst.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Usopp Usopp don't die, find a doctor! <br>It scares me that this gag has recurred in multiple arcs</br></br>  What music do you think will play when Luffy uses King Kong gun in the anime?    What if the reason Zoro hasn't had a difficult fight yet post time-skip is because of pic related, when usopp says that it would take two years for zoro to recover from his wounds inflicted by mihawk, meaning that pre-timeskip, zoro was never fighting at full capacity but now that two years has gone by he is fully recovered from his fight with mihawk  <br>agreed</br>   Kidfag <br><br>suppose it was only a matter of time, really</br></br>  <br>No, it's even better</br>  <br>If they can get Bonney involved and have her turn Shanks into a kidd or Old man then it'll be interesting. <br>Any indication Kidd working for BB?</br></br>  <br>he's saying it would take 2 years for Zoro to even move <br><br>clearly Zoro isnt normal</br></br></br>    <br>Does it automatically mean that when a Yonkou is defeated, whoever defeats them becomes the new Yonkou? Because there's three pirates in Kid's alliance and I think they're supposed to be "equals". <br><br>I'm thinking the whole system will be fucked up. Fujitora is seeking to abolish the Shichibukai. The Supernovas are trying to screw up the Yonkou. I look at this as the three powers being almost if not totally demolished. Like how Law was talking about gears in Punk Hazard.</br></br></br>  <br>overtaken<br>or gomu gomu bazooka</br></br>  <br>Bonney seems oddly adoring of Luffy<br><br>I doubt she'd help Kidtachi</br></br></br>  <br>He who kills the Yonko and takes his territory becomes the new Yonko. So you have to take control of their land and kill them or just take their land and power thus you're the new Yonko.</br>  <br>I was thinking the actual 18th century symposium that played during the defeat of crocodile "into the new world"<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qkC<wbr>a90YLiag</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>The main issue with Dressrosa, the main difference, is that Luffy did not grow. He was already strong enough to win, his crew was already stronger than Doffy too. In Alabasta each member had to become stronger, Nami learned to control weather, Zoro to cut steel, Sanji fought a tranny martial artist.<br>Dressrosa didn't have a real sense of fear for the straw hats but Alabasta did.<br><br>It is impossible to do Alabasta twice for that reason, that is why Dressrosa is underwhelming. <br><br>Also the DF Awakening was underwhelming compared to the Alabasta reveal of DF imbued objects.<br><br>Also the way Oda set up Luffy learning Crocodile weakness to water was 10/10</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that the yonkou thing doesn't specifically require four people. It's just called the yonkou because there are four. I don't see why there has to be some arbitrary number of them. They could easily just be the sankou or the gokou.<br><br>I figure if there isn't immediately a replacement like Blackbeard to take Whitebeard, then the remaining yonkou just sort of take over the turf of the fallen one.<br>You'd generally think there's a replacement, but it's not like this system has been in place for very long. None of them had died before Whitebeard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know? Now that I think about it Luffy had trained the ENTIRE time on an island full of all sorts of beasts. <br>And guess what? He'll be facing off against Kaidou who will likely be all sorts of beasts. Bravo oda.</br></br>  <br>Is this your assumption or was this stated anywhere in the manga? This is an honest question, not meant to insult or anything.</br>  <br> Law brought Luffy to the island so he knows this too. <br>Bravo anon</br></br>  <br>Not him but it is shown rather than stated.<br>Blackbeard killed Whitebeard and now he's a Yonko.</br></br>  <br>goddamn croc was a weak shit during alabasta, losing to pre gear 2nd luffy. how the hell did he fight people like doffy, akainu, mihawk, jozu during marineford?? alabasta luffy who is supposedly&gt;crocodile could not do that.</br>  <br>because he was underestimating Luffy the entire time<br><br>He let Luffy chip damage him to zero</br></br></br>  <br>As I understood it, it was more like Whitebeard died and Blackbeard knew a lot about the seas and WB's territory because he was a former crewmate so he had an edge on the others entering the New World. <br><br>So you still have to take territories after defeating a Yonkou, yes? It just doesn't get passed on to you. Fishman Island was under Big Mom's protection when it was previously WB's.<br><br><br> I think that the yonkou thing doesn't specifically require four people. It's just called the yonkou because there are four. I don't see why there has to be some arbitrary number of them.

Being lewd doesnt mean being stupid whores. It doesn't mean asking for cum. Being lewd is simpler than that. Lewdness is an art form that must be subtle yet daring. It is hard to perfect. But all the lewd I ever see is just girls with condoms or acting like sluts. Especially when it is cakes they must retain their purity while displaying the lewd</br>    <br> they watch you unzip your pants </br>  <br>This is how i like my lewds. No dirty stuff pls.</br>  <br>I like you, but i hate yo, but i like you</br>  <br>The manga chapters do it best.</br>  <br>What is the color of her panties?</br>  <br>Lewdness is meant to be used to show love and emotion. It is not something just to beat your dick at. It is meant to be erotic yet teasing. Not rude degrading trash. Maybe with 3DPD is ok to degrade but not in 2D.</br>  <br>Usually pink.<br><br><br><br><br>Kurumi likes stripped or yellow and Rii turquoise.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to make love to Rii-san in the missionary position until she's not mentally unstable any more.  <br> the outline showing the curve of her hips </br>  Also lewd?  <br>No.1 girl.</br>  Shovel=Miki&gt;Yuki&gt;Yuuri  So which episode will be the one where Miki confronts Yuki?  <br>I want to  Ay Caramba  Kurumi so bad.</br>  <br>You can see her bellybutton.</br>  <br>Garters &gt; Cray &gt; Shovel = Cathat &gt; shit &gt; Unisluts</br>  <br><br>This artist must have experience doing lewds, and yet she's never done an h-manga?</br></br>  <br>Excellent taste, anon.</br>  <br>Good taste</br>  <br>Yuki=Miki&gt;Shovel&gt;Megu-nee&gt;Taromaru&gt;<wbr>Pilot&gt;Yuuri</wbr></br>  Rape doujins when  <br>Asanagi doujins when?</br>  I just finished the first episode and I was a little disappointed by the zombies only appearing at the end, but I liked the fact that the protagonist is crazy and the zombie designs spooked my guts out.

But if Kurumi ran up then the killing events don't make sense.</br>  What does Gurashi means?  <br>What if the killing events happened at the same time? Its not like everyone will tought about a zombie outbreak right in the moment</br>  Gakkou Gracias  <br>The chapter made it look like these two were already on the roof while the trio ran up in the middle of this. Megunee knows who this girl is and I doubt "I regret letting her go" would get in instead of "she had to kill her boyfriend and I couldn't protect her". And then what, she ran down the steps and then back up?</br>  <br><br>Kurumi's flashback is part of a nightmare, so there's no way to tell how reliable it is. For all we know those events are all out of order in her dreams.</br></br>  <br>As has been said before, that scene in the manga is a dream so it's likely somewhat inaccurate. This series also loves using the unreliable narrator trope, there's no telling which account is right. Maybe none of them actually remember the whole story, they are under a mountain of stress after all.</br>  <br>It may be a plot hole, but is not like you have a better place to go when all hell breaks free and you don't know it in the moment, it cold be that she thought he tried to rape her</br>  <br><br>I get that. But where did she get the shovel if the killing wasn't on the roof?</br></br>  <br>Shee seems more like an inverted knight or page of spades from what little I understand. Her foolishness of being too energetic and willing to charge into battle are her downfall.</br>  <br>If she didn't charge into battle, who would? Even Megu-nee in her diary said no one else but Kurumi could fight the undead, so Megu-nee ended up relying on her despite knowing she was letting her student put herself in danger.</br>  <br>  Her foolishness of being too energetic and willing to charge into battle are her downfall. <br>She has already fallen from grace anon, the moment she couldn't face reality when she saw Megu-nee</br></br>  Lewd is the answer.  <br>  Megu-nee ended up relying on her despite knowing she was letting her student put herself in danger <br>That's called instinct of self-preservation, better them than me.</br></br>  Ep 3 countdown?  <br>I'm not blaming her. I'm just saying that Kurumi didn't do anything foolish. Someone had to fight, and she was the only one who could.<br><br>It's the same even now. Rii would be dead if Kurumi hadn't stopped the blow from the crossbow. And that's something only Kurumi could have done.</br></br></br>  <br>I know, but all this time did nobody thought about training to fight in case they need to? Its a zombie outbreak, you need to defend yourself and even more if you meet people you don't know</br>  <br>the eyes show how dead they are inside</br>  <br>Kurumi's just too reliable and dependable, I suppose.<br><br>I bet at least Miki would be a fighter if she was with them from the start.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, until very recently they were in the school, whether they had a pretty good routine already. They didn't need to fight. And I think deep down they thought they could keep living like that for a lot longer than they did. What fucked everything up was the chopper incident. Most of the school burned down. They couldn't keep living there after that.</br>  <br> STANDIING </br>  <br>Miki is trying to be helpful, even picking up a baseball bat would hugely change the team dynamic. Maybe Uni time will get her a weapon.</br>  <br>And that's why she won't make it alive, she's already dead and there's nobody that is still searching for a cure and thinking about use it for good and not to build a Rao's empire</br>  <br><br> ON THE EDGE <br><br> We make the same joke every thread anon </br></br></br></br>  Which  Guracho  do you guys think could  hold down their tequila?   <br>There's at least a preventative shot and if there's more of that to be found, it's at one of the marked points on the map.<br>I'm guessing that they only used one shot so far, if they were out the smart choice would be go to the source of it all.</br></br>  <br> Don't worry anon, I'm sure when the  dog dies  we'll think of new jokes </br>  <br>If she doesn't make it. who the fuck is going to fight the last boss? You think non-umbrella doesn't have some mutated monster hiding somewhere?</br>  I love her too much, help me /a/. I don't think my heart can take it if she dies.  <br>She's already dead.</br>  For those who knew about GG before the anime was announced, how did you find out about it?  <br>If watching a lot of zombie movies and reading, when you think that nothing could go wrong means everything will burn<br><br><br>And the radio-station, they just need to take care of radio-girl</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>None of them.<br><br>Yuki would start singing and dancing without ever stopping.<br>Miki would try to hook up with Kurumi.<br>Kurumi would try to pick up a fight with the bear.<br>Rin would  cry  until she sobered up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All of them, conventional tequila is weak shit compared to what they've been through.</br>  <br>Knew about it from manga threads but didn't read it until the anime started.</br>  <br>Searching for some manga, tags made me go "What the hell? Slice of life and horror?" and so</br>  <br>I wish they wore these the entire manga.</br>  <br>It'd certainly help, given the fact that it's slowly getting colder in the current chapters.</br>  <br>Anon please, Megu-nee is god-tier girl, you can't simply put her with those sluts just like that.</br>  <br>Rii is the most important Gurashi. <br><br>Because the world after the outbreak needs her fertility to repopulate earth.</br></br></br>  <br>I saw someone post about it in a manga thread.<br><br>Some time later, I was bored one day and decided to pick it up.</br></br></br>  <br>Rii would make an awful mother.</br>  <br>She may be the most fertile, but Kurumi has the superior genes. Which I guess makes sense since she's marriage material and not a slut.</br>  <br>Her genes are infected though.</br>  <br>I really doubt the infection alters you genetically.</br>  <br>What use do superior genes have, if she will die giving childbirth.<br><br>Shes not healthy at all. Now, she's even worse.<br><br>Rii is the healthiest and has great child-bearing hips capable of sustaining multiple births without problems.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I really doubt the infection alters you genetically. <br>http://pastebin.com/hgr2a3ZL<br> widespread infection may lead to mutation </br></br></br>  <br>It's so unfair that she started being the best after she got infected. And Rii started being a shit</br>  <br>It's talking about the virus there.</br>  <br><br>she's a perfectly fine strong woman both in mind and body, and will make the ideal wife. No infection can ruin this perfection.</br></br>  <br>Mutation means different versions of the virus.</br>  Why would you wear socks with a bathing suit?  <br>When you're trying to look sexy. And it works. That Miki is delicious.</br>  How does everyone feel about the anime so far?<br><br>I personally enjoy the fact that they were brave enough to make the dog and Megu-nee alive in the anime version, this way us fellow manga enthusiasts have something to look forward to in terms of plot differences.</br></br>  <br>sex appeal</br>  <br><br>Maybe, but the text is unclear. Besides, the explanation of the zombie virus (omega strain) is all censored, so we really don't know the details of the infection.</br></br>  <br>Is Kurumi expecting to spend time on her knees in that suit?</br>  <br>Why would you wear combat knee pads or a holster with bathing suit?<br><br>Also like to add Megu-nee is quite short in that pictures I always thought she was a bit taller than all the girls.</br></br></br>  <br>For some reason without sound it just looks like she's saying "mep, mip, mep mep"</br>  <br>Because wearing a bikini and socks can drive your dick like crazy<br><br><br>  Megu-nee alive in the anime version <br>  Megu-nee <br>  Alive <br>There's a lot of forshadowing making me think she's already death</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It'd certainly help, given the fact that KURUMI is slowly getting colder in the current chapters. <br><br>Fuck this fuck you</br></br></br>  <br>I'd have preferred a 1:1 adaptation, honestly.</br>  <br><br>Why would you thin they're actually alive?</br></br>  <br> Kurumi would try to pick up a fight with the bear. <br> Rii crying watching Kurumi decapitate her not sister with her shovel <br>Make it happen</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe? It's describing viral mutation, a common behavior when a virus is copied that many times over, then there are different versions to spread. That segment is describing specifics and the line you quoted is a disclaimer saying that, if the disease is widespread, the following strain information won't be entirely reliable because of mutations in the virus.</br>  <br>I wonder why?</br>  <br>Gardening?</br>  <br>Okay, but we don't know if the virus doesn't make any genetic alterations in the host, since the explanation for the omega strain is censored.</br>  <br>Oh a whole lot of being on her knees.</br>  <br>I'm not sure how many episodes this show is (I'm guessing the standard 13) I don't think they can do the entire 30 chapters into 13, plus I think they wanted to introduce the main cast right off the bat.<br><br>I still am hoping for a Miki mall flashback episode since the manga bungled the last scene pretty badly, Rii briefly alluded to Miki's time in the mall in episode 2 so I think there is hope.</br></br></br>  <br> I personally enjoy the fact that they were brave enough to make the dog and Megu-nee alive in the anime version <br> Megu-nee alive in the anime version <br> alive </br></br></br>    <br>And don't forget that zombies didn't pay attention to her even though she was standing right there</br>  <br><br><br>But there are no boys. Why would they want to look sexy?</br></br></br>  <br>They can easily fit 30 chapters in 13 episode, especially if they cut out the mall trip like it seems they might do.</br>  <br>I mean, you can't prove it either way when it's not mentioned.</br>  <br><br><br>It is in my opinion that she and the dog are very much alive in the anime, with the way they set out a plate of curry for her and they way that everyone knew to face her and thank her at the end of the library scene.<br><br>We won't know for sure until maybe episode 3 when/if they do Yuki's bathroom scene, but I'm still in the camp that Megu-nee is alive until I see it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that's an amazing colourization. Shame its not a larger resolution.</br>  <br>To seduce you, Dessy.</br>  <br>That's not what you said in </br>    <br>I want to be that spoon.</br>  <br> with the way they set out a plate of curry for her <br>Same scene in the manga. Also, it's not that they knew where to face it's that wherever they decided to face Yuki's mind put Megu-nee there.</br></br>  <br>OPT</br>  <br>I would think they will do a quick flashback to the mall to keep anime viewers up to date on where Miki initially came from. I guess to visually show that since Rii already mentioned about Yuki holding her own at the mall.<br><br>Maybe there is but I only found that one on /c/</br></br></br>  <br>No need to be rude anon, I meant the weather's getting colder.</br>  <br>Megu-nee's already dead. She is doing the exact same shit she did in the manga. <br> Getting interrupted mid-speech <br> Being inexplicably left behind <br> Advising Yuki when nobody is around <br> Everybody still loves and respects her deeply, they are just "rude" to her <br><br>Dog being alive fucks up progression, because it means that we don't know who let it die in the manga. Not to mention it shows up in the OP, with the girl students(Now zombies), Kei, the dog, and Megu-Nee. All of which are confirmed dead. If they kill the dog now, they need to completely change the way it dies. <br><br>They already fucked it up with Miki being in the group from the get-go  to which I assume only Mikifags are happy about , so the rest of this only leads to further problems.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More than a quick one since Kei is listed, probably half an episode to contain it would work if they hand wave the trip away.</br>  <br>what part was this?</br>  <br>Dog's alive, Miki chased after him in the first episode, but Megu-nee is dead, her grave's on the same place as it is in the manga, and it's not hard to think that "she" is always close to Yuki</br>      <br>Ch. 34 iirc</br>  <br><br>strange that I did think about this part, thought they didn't notice her because she was standing still. maybe she will become immune now? Maybe gain some kind of super-human powers? Certainly she won't turn, would she?</br></br>  <br>Someone made a thread dumping the first chapter and I've been sticked since back then.</br>  <br> Certainly she won't turn, would she? <br>Yes, she will.<br>They foreshadowed it with the pilot and with Radio-chan. It seems quite likely that the serum needs to be re-applied after a certain amount of time. She'll probably relapse while they're in the college.</br></br></br>    <br>Saw the first dump on /a/ 2 years ago and immediately felt like I was in for the long ride. I'm really glad to see this finally get an anime and some well deserved recognition.</br>  <br>Considering it's a nitroplus series, pain is bound to occur and she probably isn't special. Someone like Yuki would be more likely to have special benefits if she got infected, than Kurumi.</br>  <br>You gay?</br>  <br>boards.4chan.org/a/</br>  <br> Mfw I read it Manga-style </br>  <br>This image makes me feel really inadequate</br>  <br> 2 years ago <br> only 36 chapters <br><br>Does this mean at this pace it will be awhile before we get any new chapters? <br><br>I've marathoned the manga since the 1st episode came out and now I'm on pimps and needles because I just want to find out what is wrong with those 3 college girls</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a monthly, ergo it'll probably be about a month between chapters. All released chapters are translated at the moment.</br>  <br>It's montly. Started serialization in 2012, do the math.</br>  <br>Should've not marathoned it in the first place. Used to read a chapter per night so that I have an excuse to not sleep</br>  <br>It's a monthly release.</br>  <br>/a/ TL threads</br>  <br> Delusional = shit <br>fuck off, delusional Rii is great.</br></br>  <br>The zipper order should be flipped.</br>  <br>I like Rii much better now that she's delusional. Before I didn't really give a shit about her.</br>  I think the anime will end around where the manga is now since the ED has water/beach graduation trip in it. <br>I also believe megu-nee to already be dead due to her less active role in the show. Granted we haven't reached her manga death point either. But the fact that she stays with yuki makes me think she is dead. <br>I believe taroumaru will be present until the end and then become zombie as a Fuck you<br>Bear kun is not present in the ED so I believe rii will be cured of her crazy Shit. <br>The knife is in the OP with rii so I think her almost killing kurumi will be shown<br><br>Granted this is all stupid speculation with small things in the show. Fuck shit up mang</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is shit if she keeps on putting the other GGs in potential danger. I do really like that she went nuts from a plot-perspective, though.</br>  <br>Why wouldn't Megu-nee already be dead in the anime? She's long dead by the time Miki shows up. And they're not gonna get to Rii's crazy shit unless they fuck up the pacing.</br>  <br> Yuki is always the first one of the group to address megu-nee, then the rest say something in line with what Yuki said. <br> Everyone but Yuki 100% ignores her when she is the first one to speak.  <br><br>She is already dead.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Granted we haven't reached her manga death point either. <br>¿Que?</br></br>  <br> Her grave is on the roof </br>  <br>Miki is here earlier than normal so it's not easy to pin down his timeline.</br>  <br>I thought it was the dog's, the mound is too small.</br>  <br> everyone interracts with the dog <br> no one interracts with Megu-nee except Yuki unless, prompted by Yuki <br> Megu-nee's ribbon on the grave <br>She's dead anon. I know it's hard to accept.<br>The dog isn't dead  yet </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's a memorial. She's not actually buried there,  She's wandering around the basement </br></br>  <br> She is shit if she keeps on putting the other GGs in potential danger. <br>Yeah like that one time when nothing happened.<br>They'll probably get into actual trouble once before she snaps back, but I'll reserve my judgement until they do.</br></br></br>  Someone figured out that the series is set in Yokohama and uses real schools, so I tried to figure out where the mall was.  <br>She doesn't have to be buried there for it to be a grave.</br>  <br>It's likely next episode is chapters 4-5, then either the Miki backstory episodes, or the teacher and the whole kurumi thing. I wonder if they'll pad the anime with more things but as far, the only "new things" the anime has are the scenes with the dog. They even had umaibo (and the balloons, so probably helicopter kun), and yeah it has the same Megunee being ignored (and especially the cross in the roof) that means she's already zombie</br>  <br>If they are H1Z1 zombies then nothing is wrong and they are working as intended.<br><br><br>Forgot about that before I saved it, oops.</br></br></br></br>    And information about the real school.  <br>No, I mean they should have their eyes narrowed when the zipper's down. Like they're not sure what they're looking at.</br>  <br>Balloons aren't happening, helicopter will show up some other way.</br>  <br>I got confused because of the test of courage. But I noticed the grave marker so I think it's megu-nees. <br><br>There's really not much left now that mii-kun is here. I think graduation will be ep 9 or 10 ish. Give a few episodes for graduation trip and radio chan and then some bullshit not university ending because anime in general sucks shit pacing from manga in general<br><br>Also the bear is already there so I think it indicates rii becoming crazying. Again wild speculation</br></br></br></br></br>  How would the Hidamaris do in the zombie apocalypse?  <br>No anon, you should flip the zipper without flipping the actual panels.</br>  <br>For some reason, the neatest thing to me is that it does have a piano there.</br>  <br>Mii-kun is only there earlier because Miki fans would get pissed if she didn't show up until 2/3s into the show. All the events of the first few chapters are happening as normal, Miki's just there too. We'll get a flashback episode sooner or later.</br>  <br>Miyako would be the last one to go down</br>  <br><br>Gotcha. I didn't want to be mean with it.<br><br>Unfortunately the panels aren't all the same size so it would be easier to flip, even if I saved the .psd.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Graduation will be the end of it, anything else will ruin the adaptation.</br>  <br> Balloons aren't happening <br>Why would you think that? They brought up the balloons in ep 2.</br></br>  <br><br>That's cool, I tried looking for the mall for a little while the last time you brought it up but I couldn't find it myself. Nice to see that you found it.</br></br>  Rewatching still and when megu and is having breakfast and then goes with yuki for the 1 on 1 lesson yuki runs on ahead while megu-nee is slow. Then sakura sensei leave without shutting the door while the 3 gurachos look on in sadness<br><br>Megster confirmed kill</br></br>  <br>Read that chapter again, it's largely fluff. There's no reason to waste time on it.</br>  <br>That chapters was largely flufff, but that's how they got the balloons in the anime too. It doesn't really explain your point. Why wouldn't balloons happen?</br>  <br><br>No way</br></br>  <br>The balloons were a gag. The letters in the manga were a "what are we doing today" thing before the field trip, which isn't a thing in the anime. You're looking at half an episode to build up what a few throw away lines can handle later.</br>   Want this to happen <br> Know it never will <br><br>I do hope Kurumi becomes Krauser, though. Control over the infection and whatnot.</br></br></br>  <br>Now to find Kurumi's house.</br>  Well it's only summer break time anyway so there is more to go in the show. A 1:1 adaptation would be cool though. <br>I'm gomenesai for all my shitposting and excessive bumping. Good oyasumi night gurashis</br>  <br>Wouldn't it be easier to just make up a different reason for sending the balloons? If they weren't going to use the balloons they wouldn't have been included in the anime.</br>  <br>And then they became relevant later with the pilot. And besides, I don't know why you would think there's not gonna be fluff in this series. It's still half SoL after all.</br>  <br>I'm gomenesai for all my shitposting and excessive bumping. Good oyasumi night gurashis<br>Now this is some new level of shitposting</br></br>    <br>I wonder what obscene price the japs charge for that.</br>  <br>Something happens, but it's a lot worse</br>    <br>Is that water?<br>In a bottle?</br></br>  At 10 episodes left I would imagine<br><br>chap 4&amp;5<br>Sports + future<br>Miki stuff<br>2 episodes Kurumi/Megunee<br>Explore storage + dog<br>Festival<br>2 episodes helicopter<br>cleanup + graduation</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's saying "wan wan", right?<br><br> I want to tug on it. The tail, AND the device. </br></br></br>  <br>inb4 she breaks even more in the anime when the dog dies and starts acting like a dog to cope.</br>  <br>I would be her dog for her. And the others go along with it and treat me like a dog, too. That would be fun.</br>  <br>It's Yuki's sweat which grants you protection against zombies.</br>    <br><br>Who's doing these? Someone here? I'd pay my left leg to see the manga colorized.</br></br>  <br>What about vampires, ghouls and other assorted undead? If it's just zombies fuck that, I'm buying Miki's blue potion.</br>   Rereading the chapters <br> Chapter 6 <br><br>How long passed between then and when the chopper guy showed up?</br></br></br>  <br>I saw it was coming up for the season so I decided to read the manga before it aired. I wish I could remember my reaction since I only read it like two months back.</br>  <br>and Kurumi's pillow</br>  <br>18 chapters I think.

Wait, are you implying people don't use their mobile device to remote into their computer to keep their expeditions running throughout the day?</br>  <br>I've been wanting to set something like that up, is it easy and is there secured ways of doing it?</br>  <br>Windows mobile devices are the only ones allowed. Using anything else warrants a ban.<br><br>Since I don't have a Windows mobile device, I can only use a PC.</br></br></br>     Now, we are preparing for Summer Event 2015: Limited Time Area which will start in the beginning of August. It will be a Large Scale Operation. Admirals who plan on participating, please prepare by having a wide array of ships, boosting your fleet's training and developing your armament! <br><br>I hope you guys like ship-locking.</br></br>  <br>I was trying to thinly bait out ideas on whether I should try playing on my android device but from the research I've done it seems like a bannable offense. Not sure I want to start playing another mobage game.</br>  <br>It's explicitly stated by the devs that you'll be banned for playing on Android and such devices because they strain the servers. They also stated it's fine to play on windows tablets like the Surface. The Surface is the Official Tablet of Kancolle.  Surface sales went up in Japan because of kancolle. </br>  <br>Install Teamviewer. That's it.<br><br>The only downside is your computer sitting there all day in your hot summer room. But if you never turn off your computer anyway doesn't matter.</br></br></br>  <br> mobage <br>Not this shit again.</br></br>  <br><br> Himeuta  has some decent info on the subject, but all you need is Teamviewer.</br></br>  <br> Kancolle <br> small c </br></br>  <br>KanColle isn't a mobage, it's a browser game.

She's good in the game right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you Akashi I have Ooyodo for screws.</br>  <br> Fuck you Akashi <br>Isn't this normal?</br></br>  <br>Easily the best destroyer when she reaches kai 2 at the low level 65. Read the wiki for how to get in, you don't even need to do the lottery anymore thanks to the new super server.</br>  You guys didn't use low watt AC ?  <br> not running expeditions 8 and 20 for devmats <br> not getting ~20 devmats a day <br> not buying enough screws to keep up with the devmats <br> not having max for all your upgradable equipment <br>Are you even trying?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit, muh childhoods. Do they even sell those outside of East Asia?</br>  According to a nip the ranking rewards might be<br>28cm連装砲・零式通常弾・VG-33<br><br>You know what this means if it's true, right?</br></br></br>  <br>Shit. Not again. I'd have to take a year off events to train up my entire fleet to a useable state.<br>At least this time I'm not going in with lv 20's as my heavy hitters.<br>Still, I can either choose to have to equipment to succeed or the resources to sortie enough to get somewhere. <br>At least I've got the 4th fleet to lend a hand.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's like Spring then Easy won't have any ship-locking.</br>  <br><br>I've been using the api method on my android device for around a year or so and I haven't been banned. There was a period where the devs were banning a group of players but it's long over now.<br><br>Just bring up the developer bar on Chrome when playing KanColle on PC and search for an api link. Then you copy the link and paste it into a browser with flash on your mobile device.<br><br>The only downside is that you have to get a new api link when you reopen the game on your Pc.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure wall-mounted AC is common product all over the world.</br>  Only reason you'll be found out and banned for android is if you're on it the entire day. Which doesn't make sense because if you're out working or doing stuff you shouldn't be glued to the phone.<br><br>Just do 9/11/13/37/38 and come back to your phone once or twice.</br></br>  <br>Aside from the recent memory leak issues, I prefer using KCV over the API method. It's just a whole lot more convenient. Plus I like the interface.</br>  <br>Thanks bro.<br>And I have gotten stronger. Now if I could just get smarter.</br></br>  <br>Don't thank me, it very well could be like AL/MI but we won't know until the night of.</br>  <br>I can see Graf Spee being implemented with those guns, but what would a unfinished french plane be doing there?</br>  <br>Daijoubu is very cute.<br><br><br>Its a kuso TTK.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The Luftwaffe confiscated twelve VG-33s, perhaps for training use. <br>Probably because of that.</br></br>  <br> The Luftwaffe confiscated twelve VG-33s, perhaps for training use. </br>  <br>I fear the game will be gone before I say "I could do that event on hard in my sleep" like everyone constantly says. It'd be nice to be able to dominate an AL/MI type event someday.<br>I only completed up to E4 easy last event, and I'd been playing for 3 months while people who joined 2 weeks before the event claimed it was a cakewalk.</br></br>  <br>Graf Spee stole them from the French as a joke and had to run away to Japan while being followed by an angry French BB.</br>  <br><br> still no France <br>Super gay<br>Come on they were Vichy for a while</br></br></br></br>  <br>The image is a little misleading but I was referring to using the api link and pasting it on your mobile device to play that way. The only other way to play on a mobile device is using team viewer which I find a little cumbersome. But yeah I also use KCV when playing on desktop.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, I know about that. But why implement a really outdated french plane when the Germans had a whole lot of serviceable aircraft to choose from?</br></br>    <br>Maybe it's a zero bauxite usage plane since it was made of wood.</br>  I want Bismarck to come ask to sleep in my bed because she's scared to sleep alone.  I can't help but fall in love with Kongou because she's a girl who is affectionate to me.  <br>Too easy.</br>  <br><br>You should fall in love with a girl that hates you.</br></br>  <br> scared to sleep alone. <br>She's not getting any praise from me.</br></br>  <br>Prinz pls.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Kec<wbr>IdlEAKhU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>That's fine. I'll spoil her and give her all the praise she wants.</br>  <br>That one character with only three points. Why?</br>  Which of the Sendai sisters would be most likely to agree to be your girlfriend?  <br>Maybe we might get the CVL Bearn? It was the only french carrier of the war, but if they were going to introduce it, one the many versions of the Levasseur or the Villiers plane probably would be a more appropriate choice of carrier aircraft.</br>  <br>Naka if tell her that you are going to be her producer.</br>  <br>Better question is who would be a better girlfriend.<br><br>Naka is too high maintenance.<br><br>Jintsuu is a wallflower.<br><br>Sendai is too obsessed with her hobby.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jinchuu</br>  <br>Going out with a drill sergeant doesn't sound like a good idea.</br>  <br>What's her hobby besides night battles?</br>  <br>Night  sex </br>  <br>What's her hobby besides that one thing she's always going on about?</br>  <br>No one because  they're not real! </br>  <br>Marche pls</br>  <br>who?</br>  <br>You need to be 18 years or older to browse this site.</br>  <br>Marche did nothing wrong.</br>  <br> I loved the trash talk in FFT. </br>  <br>Tenryuu  a best </br>  <br>Only a masochist would do that.</br>    Poi...  <br>Poi!</br>  <br>That protagonist from one of FF Tactics.</br>  http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51459748</wbr>  In 4 levels, Kitakami is going to be my first Kai Ni<br><br>don't know how to feel about this</br></br>  <br>At the end of the day, she's just another kai ni.</br>  <br>But she's taking my kai ni virginity</br>  Is Nagara a literally who?

This is especially strange given that the Sendai class was a straight upgrade to Nagara (itself an upgrade to Kuma).</br>  <br>Pokemon Trainer, please.</br>  <br>Of the ships Yuka Iguchi voices, no one seems to care about the Nagara class.<br><br><br>It would be wise to Kai her.

It is only natural that errors are going to be introduced in the process. On the flipside of this without this person having done all of that we wouldn't have a deck to begin with because evidently no one else was willing to either put in the work involved or did not feel the desire to share it with the language learning community.
