So godspeed and praise Nana.</br></br>  <br>They're basically all the exposition they can't fit into 13 episodes (this is what happens when you get a RPG writer to do anime, really).

Kaneko said even if they got 4 cours budget it's still not enough to write all of them into the show so he had removed a lot of characters during season 1 production.</br>  <br>That number is a reference to how many Angels exists in the world.<br><br>This reminds me of the dolls are named after 4 Archangels.</br></br></br>  Is douyu just not loading for anyone else?<br>Keeps failing to connect to the channel for whatever reason.</br>  <br>It's not loading for me either</br>  <br> Stream is also kill <br>No one can save the Symphogeah.<br><br><br>Power outage, maybe thunder.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Same here.

It's too laggy.   custom singing  <br>YESSS I missed dis</br>  THEY WERE IN THE ROCKET  WHAT THE FUCK  OOOOHHHHHHHHHH  WHAT  senpai   SENPAI   <br>DON'T. JUST ENJOY RIDING MISSLES WITH CHINA-SENPAI</br>  SENPAI FUCKING CONFIRMED  Why do you enjoy Slice of Life anime or anime with a big emphasis on moe characters?  <br>i like slice of life because i dont have a life and its nice to have a slice once in a while.</br>  I watch these types of shows so I can correctly shitpost on /a/ and make people who unironically watch it suffer by reading my text.  <br>This.</br>  Because why not  <br>SoL and iyashikei are my favorite genres, it makes life less painful.</br>  <br>Who's this Prostate Apostate?</br>  <br>I enjoy cute things and sol is a nice escape from my stressful life. I struggle to understand why people enjoy shonen battle shows.</br>  They're healing.  <br>Some shonen battle shows have nice aspects, not sure if absolute duo was shonen but it was battle and was cute, Julie was really adorable</br>  <br>best girl in a pantie on head wearing summer anime.</br>  <br> Japanese could animate literally anything they want, the possibilities are endless <br> isntead they make the same cookie cutter cute garbage with no story or development and copypasted faces <br> /a/ defends this </br></br></br>  <br>Variety, I enjoy tons of different anime. One of the reasons why I haven't burnt out is because I can watch a bunch of mech stuff,then move on to some slice of life, and finally could end it off with some battle shonens. I have my favorites, but there's no good reason not to give every a chance.</br>  <br> the most egregious offender </br>  <br> implying we don't get anime with diverse genres every season </br>  <br><br>What are you talking about? We didn't get any SoL anime last season.</br></br>  <br> anything they want <br>No they can't and that's what veterans are complaining about since a decade, retard.</br></br>  <br> isntead they make the same cookie cutter cute garbage with no story or development and copypasted faces <br><br> make a show with interesting characters or at least one interesting character with some depth <br> TWO FACED BITCH, NO PERSONALITY, EDGY SHOW, FORCED DRAMA </br></br></br></br>  <br>Alright I'll jump on the bait.<br><br>Why do you think your manner of storytelling is better than other people's? It's subjective.<br><br>For that matter, why are you of the opinion that shows need a storyline with development? Slice of Life by definition doesn't follow a traditional storyline, instead showing you "what is" (Regardless of the reality in which it's presented). There's no need to show development, there's no reason for there to be a beginning, middle, and conclusion with a lesson to be taught (Which is cliche as well, but a different conversation), it just is what it is.<br><br>You throw around pejoratives like 'cookie cutter' and 'copypasted faces', but aside from a few outliers I don't see this to be the case. I refute this specifically because one of the main draws to shows like these to me is the animation and the style. I'm sure that someone will bring up some obscure examples to refute me, but for the majority of the characters/shows the animation and styles are unique.<br><br>I mean, I understand that you think if studios weren't animating shows that you don't like they could be animating shows that you do like, but that's not how the world works anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yahari was last season...</br>  <br>Kiniro Mosaic?</br>  <br>Kiniro Mosaic you idiot.</br>  <br><br>What is Kiniro Mosaic<br>What is Danna ga nani (long title)<br>What is first half of Yuki-chan</br></br></br></br>  Shibafu the best  qtkaze  Would have wild Sex with ShibafuNuiNui    <br>RIP thread.</br>  <br>Why?</br>  <br/>  <br>Hungry wolf is hungry.</br>  Glasses have gone too far.  <br>Shit taste, Raian.

Kumiko and Shoe reconciled, they won gold and passed to the next round.</br>  <br> Kumiko and Shoe reconciled <br><br>So that's what you hetfags call merciless friendzoning these days?</br></br></br>  <br>Kumiko and Reina, after an intense performance with their mouths, h*ld h*nds in the afterglow. The anime ends with some ambiguity of how their relationship will develop further, but it's clear that they're much closer given the climax of the events.</br>  <br><br> Kumiko grabbing Shoe's arm so hard it breaks and he never to play the tromboner again </br></br>  <br>I'm bored, what the hell.</br>   typical Hibikek thread on /a/ <br> zero Asuka senpai <br> zero Natsuki senpai <br>Just when I thought this board's taste couldn't get any shitter.</br></br></br>  <br>its Jacku, get it right</br>  <br>I wish I had a wingwoman as cool as Reina.</br>  What was the name of the first piece the band played during the final episode?<br><br>It was probably mentioned in an episode weeks ago but I aint trawling for that shit</br></br>  <br>Buchou is a-okay.</br>  <br><br> liking fatties </br></br>  <br> buchou <br> fat <br><br>what</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No.</br></br>  Would you follow him /a/?  <br>Let's go</br>  <br>Good god why.

It isn't hard for me to imagine Reina drooling over the idea of  Tuxedo  Taki</br>  What a fucking fantastic show this turned out to be.  So how was the threads on ep 13 airing day? Was the yuri discussed more or the solo?  <br>I saw Taki's design yesterday and I gotta say it wouldn't be as hard for me to picture him with Reina had Kyoani kept that design.</br>  <br><br>I'm gonna say that this one counts since it got me Kaori.</br></br>  <br>Only one choice.</br>  <br><br>You should be ashamed of your garbage taste in chinese cartoons.</br></br>  <br>There was a bunch of "/u/ BTFO" posts, but most people focused on the solo. No one discussed yuri. That only started like 8 hours after episode aired when someone posted the spoiler of the novel version of the reconciliation scene.</br>  <br><br>Ep:13 Shoe1 &gt; Taki &gt; Shoe1</br></br>  Why is Taki such a faggot  <br>I don't understand you, Anon.

Well that solo part was so beautiful</br>  <br><br>The female sensei must be going out of her mind having to work with a such a young, hot stud.</br></br>  <br><br>I know this is animu, but some of the girls in the band are obscene as fuck.

Reina gives Shuuichi two tickets and tells her to invite Kumiko. And Reina dresses up like the girl from the Grudge and then scares Kumiko so hard that she grabs Shuuichi by the arm and runs out as fast as she can. <br><br>Reina being a bro. Shame it won't be animated.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Asuka's story won't be animated <br> KyoAni will never get to the point when the novels do play the Hibike!

They could make that story the season 2 OVA.</br>  I'm a Kyoanus baby. Do they really change a lot in their novel adaptations? How accurate is this show? Where do I get spoilers?  <br> How accurate is this show? <br>Who cares, it's probably better than the novels anyway.</br></br>  <br><br>How can you say that when you havent read it anyway. Nevermind found some decent results in google.</br></br>  <br>They toned down MC's attraction to her love interest (or to be more precise, they made it more ambiguous) and added even more yuri bait than there was in the source material. <br>Other than that, it's the exact same story. None of the major events were changed.</br></br>  <br>K-On lucky star Haruhi clannad kanon were better than their source material.</br>  <br>90% accuracy.<br><br>FYI : I read the book.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Read for yourself.<br><br>http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/i<wbr>ndex.php?title=Hibike!_Euphonium</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>How long does it take those nerds to translate novels in general?

Yugi doesn't give a fuck about Souma, nor does he have an obligation to ensure his failure wouldn't get him expelled.<br><br>The only logical conclusion is that consensus reached, based on (obvious) clues in the recent chapters.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe she was never good?</br>  <br>If Yugi wanted Souma as his underling, this would be a logical conclusion but Yugi doesn't respect or care about Souma and wouldn't mind if he got expelled.

I still don't understand how he didn't see that coming.  soufle-chan rip  <br>I'm kinda newfag so I don't know if there is some longer lasting archive, but I'm pretty sure douyu link is only one given in the last week</br>   gokigenyo   I guess new OP/ED next week.  Who else tried to do the egg breakfast challenge? Post your dishes and compare.<br><br>Here's mine</br></br>  <br>No, it isn't.

Maybe no car trip this ep.  <br> Cammy Megumi </br>    <br>Well done or nothing  This derails the thread.jpg </br>  git gud    <br>I didn't understood how to cook the onions. You use the butter and meat juices but then add wine? I did and it went all to shit really soon after that.</br>      <br><br>Emi Igawa was just kind of a rival that was obsessed with the MC, Kirino pretty much chose on her own to be a bitch, Erina just doesn't know any better really cause she's used to being on top. Half the point of the domineering Ojou-Sama character type is that they're used to being the best at everything and getting their way and the male harem lead has find someway to either save them in some situation or one up then and then they just join the harem and lose their edge. It's going to happen with Erina eventually and everyone knows it.<br><br>What's probably going to happen is her idol will turn out to be a dick to her and Soma is going to have to Shokugeki with him at some point to defend her honor or something</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lemme guess, he makes curry with eggs<br><br>Shouldn't there be a rule that 60% of the dish should be eggs if they're the main ingredient? Like Megumi's dish didn't have enough eggs, they were just skewers with egg on them.</br></br></br>  nakiris pls, contain your orgasm  <br><br/></br>  This looks like a show I should watch.<br>Is it about cooking?<br>I'll only watch if it's about cookings.</br></br>  <br>Why would Souma's dad be a dick to her though?</br>  Hippos man  <br>I bet Erina can tell what you had for lunch after tasting your cum.</br>  <br>So much hippos this episode.</br>    <br><br><br><br>All dat smugness and pouting. Why do people hate this character so much again? She's kind of hilarious. I don't even normally like Risa "Ieeeee Senpai" Taneda but she does well with her too.</br></br></br></br>  They doubled the number of burners?  <br>Can you stop this shitty hippo meme?  Because now I really see a hippopotamus at these shots. </br>  CR ETA  <br>If you eat a ton of pineapple apparently your cum tastes like it?<br><br><br>Because they're animeonly fags and mehgloomyfags at the same time</br></br></br></br>    <br>*60% or more</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>      Alice looks so much better this episode. I hope the Korean slaves who did last episode got fired.  <br> SHokugeki no Soma on SF kinda fonts. <br><br>Gotta love this show.

Alice and Ryou in the ED.  BEST GIRL FACE    <br>Yes, also 16 seems a little too much.</br>  <br>So… Alice Doujin when?</br>  <br><br>Holy shit.</br></br>  Recap next week right? But the arc isn't over.    <br>It's a shounen<br><br>What did you expect<br><br><br>As soon as based Tosh is done with WSJ he'll release his stockpile of SnS doujins all at once</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pls tell me I wasn't the only one to think that it was cum all over her face the first time I saw this.</br>  <br>There's one in Sadpanda.</br>  Shit, Blanka Erina.  <br>Yeah, recap special.<br><br>Matsuoka just helmed the PV.</br></br></br>  I'd eat Alice's eggs.<br><br>If you catch my drift.</br></br>    <br>Best tits as well.</br>  <br> As soon as based Tosh is done with WSJ he'll release his stockpile of SnS doujins all at once <br>I actually think he's capable of doing that. Based Tosh.</br></br>  Go away Matsuoka-kun        <br>Only the Nakiris showed tits.</br>  <br>You're right. Although the scans are pretty bad.</br>  <br><br>10/10.</br></br>  <br>Yes, it is, all the recipes you see there are real and judging by a few dishes i tried myself and others that /a/nons have posted, the dishes are really good.<br>The threads derail into waifuwars and shitposting most of the time though.<br>  Hisako is unarguably best girl  </br></br></br>  <br>I remember Blanka, Honda, Guile and Ken but Nikumi is who?</br>  Who have the best genes and why is it the Nakiris?  <br>Now I want a Native American character.<br><br><br>Elena</br></br></br></br>  <br>Overcooked.</br>  <br>That video was entertaining, especially the mechanical pepper grinder. Why do they have a random poodle in the background?</br>  <br>Ayy lmao</br>    <br>What did he say?<br><br>Next week recap?</br></br></br>  <br>Autumn Elections special I think.</br>    <br><br>Ryou a cute.</br></br>    I want Alice to impregnate me with her eggs.  Did they say who Kurokiba was? Also will the new OP/ED appear next next week? Kinda odd since the arc is just one episode short of ending.  <br>Recap + a look ahead to the Elections (plus announcing new VAs as well).</br>   all these autumn election hints <br><br>They're gonna skipped everything else aren't they?</br></br>  <br>Now that's just pervörs.</br>  <br> we know we are the hottest around this area </br>  <br>What? You mean Hayama?</br>  <br>Elena from Street Fighter Suri</br>  A-archer?  <br>No. We learn about his name in chapter 53.</br>  <br> no hippos <br>God damn it Alice.</br></br>  <br>What is this?</br>  <br>No they spoke of karaage a while back.<br><br><br>They should rectify that like they did with Hisako</br></br></br></br>   Alice foodgasm face that early <br>They want to completely dehype her? She was a pretty scary bitch in manga before her loss.</br>  <br> it's a girl <br>I came here thinking it was a cute boy.</br></br>  <br>You mean her ED face? That's far from her actual foodgasm face.</br>  <br>Because the channel is called "Cooking with Dog"</br>  <br><br>Am I the only one that doesn't like Alice's foodgasm face?<br>I was expecting something like they did with Hisako.   ;_;  </br></br></br>    <br>But for what purpose?</br>    <br>But she's goofy with Ryou and Erina and there's the pool chapter to look forward to before the tournament</br>  <br>Much better than last episode</br>  ALICE &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<wbr>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<wbr>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<wbr>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<wbr>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<wbr>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; RYOKO &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; MEGUMI-ERINA</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br>10/10<br>Ryou a cute<br>Alice a Best</br></br></br>    <br>It's cute.</br>  <br>To be cute and distinguish themselves of the thousands other cooking channels?</br>  Did /a/ even talk about this. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gDF<wbr>WHD9cm-E</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I know you're all going to say it sucks anyways.....still felt like sharing and starting a thread for this.</br></br></br></br>  We had a thread about it yesterday and I'm still mad.  Hah holy shit, Shirou sounds like some kind of youtube let's play gamer or anime reviewer.<br><br>Is this dude really a legit voice actor? Absolutely ridiculous.</br></br>   Kotomine – Crispin Freeman <br>everyone else is shit</br>  <br><br> watching dubs </br></br>  <br><br>Yes. His VA is the also the voice of Eren Jaeger, Kirito and Rin Okumura. <br><br>not really my favourite VA. I like a lot of english dub VA's but I dunno man....</br></br></br></br>  <br>nice dubs, but fuck, what the hell? At least they could learn how to pronounce characters names. It's /ʃi'ro:/ not fucking /'ʃirəʊ/</br>    <br>Toesucka Reen</br>  <br> this is what Japanese cartoons sounds like in Japanese to adults <br> this is what it sounds like in English to you as an adult native </br></br>  <br>At least he was okay as Rin. The rest, geez.</br>  <br>Yeah pretty much, why the hell didn't they get Liam O Brien for Archer again.</br>  Why are English VA's so god damn lifeless?  <br>https://soundcloud.com/kaiji-tang/u<wbr>bw-archer-mix<br><br>I'm willing to give the new actor a shot after he did this, his performance just needs to be better.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>It was passable until Rin spoke.<br><br>Nope.jpg</br></br></br>  Isn't half the fucking appeal of Fate all the badass/cute/memorable voices and performances?<br><br>This honestly confuses me.</br></br>  <br>Bretty gud.</br>   that Rin <br> actually saying Hero of Justice instead of just Hero <br> Sheerow <br> Sheerow Emmijaah </br></br></br>  <br>oh man<br><br>i like dubs and all the new ones are shit. what the fuck is that rin voice holy shit</br></br></br>  <br>What's your point?</br>  <br>could they not afford the old cast? DEEN's show had decent enough voices for the main cast.</br>  <br>Ironically she's not new. She was the Rin for the original Fate stay night. Still horrible, though.<br><br><br>Do your research. The only person they couldn't reprise was O'Brien, which makes it a fucking disaster from the get-go.</br></br></br></br>  Why are western women so useless that they can't even voice act<br>I mean holy shit Saber was half decent but Rin and Illya are the fucking posterchildren of why I don't watch dubs. Women just can't fucking act.</br>  <br>Not all, just the women mostly. Honestly, besides Lowenthal, almost all the major male dub actors are pretty good.</br>  WHY THE FUCK DOES SABER HAVE AN AMERICAN ACCENT  Is this shit about to go full Naruto?<br>If this faggot becomes Sasuke 2.0 I'm dropping this shit and never looking back.</br>  Have faith in Horikoshi.<br><br>Also, Iida was literally designed/added at the last minute to the manga so he might actually be considered expendable enough to die!</br></br>  can you stop making threads this retarded? Iida is a cool guy looking for revenge, sasuke turned into edgelord when he was little and got ruined for ever.  <br> Is this shit about to go full Naruto? <br>people have been saying that forever now silly</br></br>  <br> sasuke 2.0 <br><br> You are saying that as if trying get revenge was something that Sasuke invented. He doesn't need to go full "crawling in my skin" to want to catch a villain that crippled his brother.<br><br> The guy is not the type, he has nothing in common with Sasuke anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  Biyori Ch. 39 TL is out.  <br>Nobody takes Kanbara seriously.</br>  <br>technology!</br>  <br>Kyaputen needs help.</br>  <br>This... is.... SPARTAAAAA!</br>  <br>Luddite moe.</br>  <br>Who closed the door?</br>  <br>Koromo closed the door.</br>  <br>Hisa stop seducing kyaputen you whore.</br>  <br>Skype can't replace training camp.<br>The End.</br></br>  <br>Kana take your Ritalin already.</br>  <br>July 17 = next Saki chapter<br>July 25 = next Shinohayu/Biyori chapters, plus the three manga volume releases and Biyori OVA</br></br>  <br>I want to defile the Hayaya.</br>  Yue is on the volume 4 Shinohayu cover.  <br>The uniform look too big on her.</br>  <br>She's a small girl.</br>  <br>Do real life girls dress like that too?</br>  <br>For Mu.</br>  <br> Buchou's Story 2 <br><br>When was 1? I feel like I missed it.<br><br>Kyaputen a cute though</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sometimes, but it's not as good.</br>  <br><br>I want to see Hisa giving lessons to Mihoko.</br></br>  <br>What kind of lessons?</br>  <br>It was Chapter 3. I totally forgot about it.</br>  <br>I still don't really understand what the implication of that picture was.</br>  <br>Ok yeah, I remember it now that I've gone back and looked at a couple pages<br><br>But holy shit, what a forgettable chapter</br></br></br>  <br>Saki Biyori is cute and well drawn, but it's all kind of forgettable.<br>I wish the effort could be focused more on the main series.</br></br>  <br>All kinds.<br><br><br>I don't understand what you can't understand.</br></br></br></br>  ded thread          Right, this thread has gone to the freaks. Time to abandon it.  <br> grade school </br>  <br>Be sure to drink milk and rub twice daily<br>Actually getting someone else to rub them for you is better because you don't have to work your shoulders.</br></br>  <br>No really, do the covers depict their high school designs?</br>  <br>Yes because once upon a time Shinohayu was going to be about high school and the interhigh 10 years ago but now we're stuck in Endless Elementary.</br>  <br>I think we'll get a Shinohayu time skip through middle school. Something like: "... and Shino kept winning every tournament ... but still her mom didn't come back."<br>Then we'll get a Shinohayu plot bombshell at the same time that reporter Nishida reveals Saki and Teru's background in the main series.</br></br>  <br>We can only hope.<br>Can someone remind me what scholarship Shino and her crew wanted? Was it to a middle school?</br></br>  At some point, Shino and her mom might not even recognize each other. It would be sad if they just passed each other walking down the street, though that's unlikely to happen living so far apart.  <br>Asakumi High School<br>Shino has her act together, so I wonder why she doesn't try to go to Tokyo herself to look for her mother. Hayari already went there solo for Mafuka's concert, and Shino has old friends she could stay with. Guess she's smart enough to stay away from dealing with the yakuza.</br></br>  Posting this every thread until the vita game trailer is released.<br>Please look forward to it</br>  Why didn't Akado take some of the Achiga children to the elementary school individual tournament?  <br>Especially since she had been in it herself.</br>  <br>Is that Yuu and Kuro?</br>  <br>Yes, those are the baby Achigas.</br>  <br>Man that's sad thing to say to any parent figure. Guess we'll be seeing a lot of tears when Shino move away from Richardson<br><br> Usagi Drop ending never <br> Shino being RichardsonxShinomom daughter never </br></br></br></br>  <br> implying it's not going to be a Kanna x Richardson end with Kanna being smug all over Shino </br>  <br>Asakumi is a dorm school, so Shino only has middle school left to be with Richardson. It will be sad seeing them separate. It's also weird that we don't see the grandparents or any other aunts, uncles, or cousins. <br>Shino is so alone in the world without Richardson.</br></br>  <br>Maybe not totally alone.</br>  <br>Shino is the Kevin Bacon of mahjong.</br>  <br>Akado connects to Nodoka.</br>  <br>...and Nodoka connects to Saki.</br>  <br>I think because she was still scared from Sukoyan and didn't want to expose the children to such monsters.<br><br>Or she asked but the parents denied it.<br>"I will take your daughter to Nara to the prefectural tournament. We will stay there for a few nights, gufufu. Wait, I meant days."</br></br></br></br>  <br> The city of Kyouka <br><br><br>Those are their highschool versions nigga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it's not like Saya can write the main story, so it's probably not hurting anything<br><br>what's she gonna do, dance erotically to keep Ritz's energy up?</br></br></br>  <br>No, that would just distract Ritz and cause more delays.</br>  <br>Igarashi's art sure has gotten better. <br><br>What's the opinion on old Ritz style? They're both good but the new one is way more iconic.</br></br></br>  <br>Why does it look like a shitty shoop?</br>  <br>Because we don't have a full picture yet.</br>  久！'s figure just released. <br>To the other anons that bought her I hope she turns out well.</br>  <br>Does it smell like semen, just like the real Hisa?</br>  <br>The new one is softer looking, particularly when colored.</br>  Just a reminder that's it July already and that Yuan will have her birthday tomorrow (well, in 8 hours in Japan).  Are they close or are they distant? <br><br>A kid shouldn't say something like this.</br></br>  <br>Shino is just extremely mature for a kid.</br>  I was thinking we should make a tier list ranking the quality of each match.<br>Yes or no? I'm sure that we can come up with a consensus  except for Monkey Magic vs The supernova <br>Would it include matches other than Nagano's finals/ Side A semis/ Side B's Quarter and Semis?</br></br>  <br>Would not... other matches were like.... just one or two hands.<br><br>Ah, there's Nanpo vs Saki, I think.</br></br></br>                <br>Aww.<br>Though I thought they were going to bond over their shared love of snacks and  beating  Saki  at mahjong. </br></br>  Awai, do you think love can bloom even on the Mahjong table?  <br>Provided it's sturdy enough to support your hefty ass~</br>  <br>If love can bloom there, it can surely die there as well.</br>  <br><br>Video chat, also useless in Japan.</br></br>  Remember: some old man in the sky isn't deserving of your worship, shekels are.  <br>I-I don't think I like rapist Awai very much.<br><br> Un Surprisingly, I think I like murderous classy Teru a lot more.</br></br></br>  <br>Rather than a threat, caution is urged. Sorrow and joy are oft bedfellows.</br>  <br><br>Yes. And so are Saki and Teru.</br></br>  <br>Teru isn't a murderer, she's the greatest philosopher of our time.</br>  <br>more like the greatest sweet tooth of all time</br>  <br>Yet sometimes sweets can be anything but...</br>      The thing about life, is you need to take what you want, because nobody is going to give it to you.  To all things there is a season, and the season of blooming is a season that harbingers a season of reaping.  <br>I suddenly feel the urge to give my soul over to Saki-san</br>  <br><br>Savoring it will be a delicious treat.</br></br>    <br>I'm willing to buy it, where did you buy it and how much did you pay in ships if you are living in Europe?</br>  <br>http://www.amiami.com/top/detail/de<wbr>tail?gcode=FIGURE-010561&amp;page=top%2<wbr>Fsearch%2Flist%3Fs_keywords%3Dhisa%<wbr>24pagemax%3D40%24getcnt%3D0%24pagec<wbr>nt%3D1<br><br>I live Australia and it was about 61 dollarydoos with the cheapest shipping.</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Forty?

That person is  Aislynn Wishart. </br></br>  <br>i can't accept this<br><br>nobody respects sheepfuckers<br><br>http://worldmapswithout.nz/<br><br>kiwi please go and stay go</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's kind of weird. Her theme is all combative and stuff, when Teru is really just a nice girl that likes playing mahjong. I don't think we've ever seen her get outright angry yet.<br>You could make the argument that she scares the panties back on to the people she plays against, but that's less her deciding that she wants to terrify some people today, and more just a byproduct of her dominance.<br>Compare and contrast with Awai, who cheerfully tries to go against sure win hands and seems to love the struggle at the mahjong table.</br></br></br>  <br>That is pretty hilarious. <br> A-chan draws depiction of NZ's relation with the world </br></br>  <br><br>Wait, did Gonzo draw this?

They're already the 2 mainest characters of the series in the first place and we know them very well. We won't be having any shortage of Saki and Nodoka scenes in the series at all. The Individuals thus should have been an opportunity to have lesser known interesting characters of the first cast to get the spotlight- yet it was so only for Kyaputen.<br>I'm not even mad because Hisa got rekt with just a single point between her and Saki. Touka, Kana, Jun, Yuuki, Momo; literally any other duo would have been better than MC1 and MC2. Would have been an interesting element of realism too, since IRL it's like Washizu said: there are times where everything is meaningless and you will lose no matter how talented you are and how well you play.<br><br>Also the South Wind girl was just unnecessary. Saki beating her was even more unnecessary, it was the golden opportunity to have Yuuki in a showdown, but instead it was just "dude rinshan lmao" again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I recognize that pattern.<br><br>Nodoka on the left again, right?<br><br>What does this mean? That Ritz misses the boobs from the vice captain match. And Megan will advance, since Arata and Seiko will satisfy her... nope, not a chance.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The way I rationalized it was: Yumi, Momo and Touka were going in with the mindset of "I must win this tournament so we can stay together / go to Tokyo to have fun together". It was important for them to realize that even if they lose, they can still be together / go to Tokyo.</br>  <br><br> It didn't strike me as much as this the first time I watched it, but wasn't the Individual tournament just plain shit overall? <br><br>It was thrown-in filler content that made little sense, and barely acted to give some context to Saki, to Mihoko, and to South-Wind Girl.<br><br>Think of it as Fanfic.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Who is the cutest Saki of them all, and why is it Shino?  <br>Shino it is</br>  Kanna is disappointed again!  Shino is popular...  shino a shit<br><br>she's not even cute</br></br>  <br><br>I bet you think that Goth Girl is better!</br></br>  <br>nah shes ugly</br>  When thinking of Kazue Nanpo and her South Wind, does anybody think of her farting?  Why are the most evil also so cute?  <br>WIth the eye ribbon and bandaged arms, it seems like she is hiding an injury.<br>She reminds me of the burned girl in Katawa Shoujo.</br></br>  <br>They should have made Yuuki's power the South Wind from the beans on all of those tacos.<br>Gotta make that cape fly in the breeze.</br></br>  <br>No wonder only 3 new chapters in the last 3 months. That's a lot of boobs to retone.</br>  <br>The individuals were necessary because the anime had caught up to the manga at that point.</br>  <br><br>Another victim of Saki's rage. Truly will the casualty list ever end?<br><br><br>Couldn't work, otherwise she'd recover on a high note too much.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I suspect Nanpo was a Teru prototype that was repurposed when they decided to not animate the nationals immediately.</br>  <br>The anime aired April-September 2009. The manga had only gone up to Chapter 55. The Nagano tournament ended in Chapter 55, and the training camp and Zenkoku prelude went up to Chapter 63. Chapter 64 starts Zenkoku.</br>  <br>Hard to believe the Saki franchise (manga 2006- ) preceded and outlived K-ON (manga 2007-2012).</br>  <br>The anime adaptation of K-on was excellent, considering the manga was really dull. So the moment the show continued in a manga-only format it died out pretty quickly.</br>  <br>It's not hard to believe at all.</br>  Another Saki spinoff: Kana gets a college degree and becomes a teacher at Kazekoshi. She takes over as mahjong coach from the evil abusive lady.<br>The Ikeda triplets become mahjong stars, and they split up to become the strongest players at Ryuumonbuchi, Tsuruga, and Kiyosumi. Kana must find a way to keep her job as coach by finding a way to beat her sisters and win the Nagano tournament, while also preserving the friendships she's made.</br>  <br><br>Don't quit your dayjob to work as an anime storyboarder.<br><br>Unless your dayjob is I don't, worse somehow, like being President of the United States.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why did Saki put a tissue between her legs? Is it that time of the month?</br></br>  <br><br>What are you talking about anon? I don't know what you mean.<br><br> But seriously, a cell phone? </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ritz should just do a h-doujin of all the big boobed sakis to get it out of the way.<br><br>Maybe she already did, and sealed the results in a cave. We may never know.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Maybe she's borrowing buchous again.</br></br>  <br> Ritz <br> Drawing Manga <br><br>You guys crack me up sometimes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ｉ　ａｍ　ｄｏｉｎｇ　ｍｙ　ｂｅｓｔ．　<br>Ｉ　ｗｏｒｋ　ｖｅｒｙ　ｈａｒｄ　ｔｏ　ｂｒｉｎｇ　ｙｏｕ　ｂｉｇ　ｂ<wbr>ｒｅａｓｔｓ．　Ｔｈｅｙ　ａｒｅ　ｖｅｒｙ　ｇｏｏｄ　ｂｕｔ　ｔａｋｅ<wbr>　ｌｏｎｇ　ｔｉｍｅ．<br>Ｉ　ｄｏ　ｎｏｔ　ｗａｎｔ　ｔｏ　ｕｐｓｅｔ　ｍｙ　ｐｒｅｃｉｏｕｓ　<wbr>ｆａｎｓ　ａｎｄ　ｉｔ　ｍａｋｅｓ　ｍｅ　ｖｅｒｙ　ｓａｄ　ｔｏ　ｓｅ<wbr>ｅ　ｗｏｒｄｓ　ｌｉｋｅ　ｔｈｉｓ．　　<br>Ｐｌｅａｓｅ　ｕｎｄｅｒｓｔａｎｄ　ｔｈａｎｋｙｏｕ．　</br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br><br> implying Ritz even knows what 4chan is </br></br>  <br> doubting the wisdom of Ritz-sama </br>  <br>Hmm, would Ritz-sensei eventually give up her rights to the Saki franchise into public domain, allowing other authors to write up official spin-offs?</br>  <br>Nah, Saki will die with Ritz.</br>  <br>Thanks Ritz.</br>  <br>Ritz can still draw manga.</br>  <br>Japan is enjoying dress-up with Hisa.</br>  Teru &amp; Saki's hand signs  Teru enjoys karaoke more than you expect.  <br>I enjoy Teru more than she expects.</br>  <br> Andate a la puta que te parió, hack de mierda. </br>  <br>Fuck off la Kuro.</br>  <br>such a super bitch.

Ritz goes into mega-slow mode during the finals so they can do a flash-forward showing all of the implications and consequences of what Saki is about to do.</br>  <br>That doesn't make sense though. Is there precedent for an announcement of a full series coming with an OVA? <br>It has to be Shinohayu. 1 cour to the end of the inter-elementary.</br></br>  Either way, a Saki anime adaptation is always a good thing.<br><br>No need to worry about QUALITY because the manga has plenty of that already.<br><br>And its kind of an unwritten rule that the Saki anime adaptations insert material/events/explanations that were absent from the manga.

Sometimes she wears panties to school because it gets her so excited. Once a girl noticed, and threatened to tell everyone if Saki didn't eat her out.

You should try it.</br></br></br>  <br>Panties retain moisture and provide an breeding ground for bacterial and fungal infections. It is a sanitary issue that led to the elimination of panties in the Sakiverse.</br>  <br><br>Who is the sub and who is the dom in their relationship anyway?</br></br>   5 people in 7447 <br> 2:0 </br>  <br>Mairu is the one in chains, so she must be the sub. Himeko is dom, <br>It's kind of weird because Himeko is smaller and one year younger than Mairu.</br></br>   Grandma tell me the stories about the war again   New YG out today, but never mind because the next Saki chapter is in two weeks.  <br><br>Yeah, but Mairu puts the chains on herself, and then Himeko has the orgasm!</br></br>  <br>Mairu is the man, and Himeko is the woman.<br>Yet Himeko is the assertive one.<br>Mairu provides the keys, and Himeko provides the wet keyhole.<br>It's all very complicated.</br></br></br></br>  Yuuki actually confirmed that panties still exist in the Sakiverse. It's just that they've apparently managed to manufacture quantum-state panties, so every time you're able to look at the area that would be covered by them -but not a look that would enable you to see the lewd bits- the panties won't be there. You stop looking, they come back there.  <br>Himeko is taller than Mairu.</br>  <br><br>Wait a second, where is Funa-Q's hand?</br></br>  <br>Bullshit.<br>Fuck you, Ritz.</br></br>  <br>Fucking lesbian, how do they work?<br><br>I wish the professor is still alive.</br></br></br>  <br>The Atago clan is notoriously heterosexual.<br>Hiroe is going to be jealous.</br></br>  <br><br>Reclaim your property Hiroe!</br></br>  <br>Meaty Maho vs. Skinny Maho<br>Which would you choose?</br></br>  <br><br>I choose Kyou-kun!</br></br>  <br>As of now Maho is pretty horrible/annoying character. <br><br>Seriously, Nodoka and to lesser extent Tacos are pretty shitty character, Maho being related to both of them make it worse. <br><br>Why can't the Kiyosumi be as interesting as Rinkai or Shiratodai or even Usuzan. Hisa and Saki is the only interesting character.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Ritz actually went over it in one of her recent blog posts. <br>Mairu was the taller one until middle school.</br></br>     [CReep] Gate - 01 [1080p].mkv <br><br>Gate Episode 1 Subs are up</br></br>  <br>Missed the live watching. Giive me the TL;DR: Should I actually bother?</br>  <br>Is that even worth downloading?<br>Hows the quality?</br></br>  <br><br>No blood or gore. Instant drop for me.</br></br>  <br>Read the manga.</br>  <br>It was so-so. Quite slow paced and the action didn't exactly have much bite. It wasn't horrible though.<br><br><br>Ought to be the same as a Horriblesubs release.</br></br></br></br>  I already watched Outbreak Company.  Reminder that Empire only lost because they're at war with long-faced ayliens.  <br>the manga is good. The Anime needs to fire whoever came up with their artstyle.</br>  <br>I have. That's why I ask.  How would I know about the livewatch otherwise, silly Anon? </br>  <br>The JSDF were pussies in outbreak company. This here is just peace through superior firepower</br>  <br>Seriously, what the fuck were they thinking<br><br>Are they SERIOUSLY trying to turn the series that has rape in almost every issue into a kid-friendly shonen? <br><br>Are we even going to see the Battle of Italica?</br></br></br></br></br>  Is this not generic?  Is this a NIPPON FUCK YEAH anime?  <br>It's great fun, but they're skimming over the BEST PART about Gate<br><br>And that's watching fantasy shitters get wrecked by modern technology. <br><br>They're glazing over it! The battle to retake Ginza DIDN'T EVEN GET ANYTHING OTHER THAN A TEN SECOND CUTAWAY! <br><br>TEN SECOND CUTAWAY</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, but who cares? It's got helicopters and tanks murdering the shit out of some medieval plebs</br>  <br>they better do that scene right. THEY BETTER! I'LL BURN SOME SHIT DOWN IF THEY DON'T!</br>  <br> the manga is good. <br>well, it was much of the liking of my 8-old nephew (obsessed with "who would win, a navy SEAL or a Ninja?" stuff). That is actually a quite accurate indicator of the franchises' quality</br></br>  <br>you let your 8yo nephew read Gate? The fuck is wrong with you? At least wait till he's 12 and he can start jerking it.</br>  Is this the District 9 of anime?  <br><br>fuck off autist</br></br>  <br>like in the fuckin manga where it was just a flashback?</br>  <br>Ausifag please.</br>  <br>Yeah but is it generic?</br>  <br> implying it was me </br>  <br>A flashback at lasted for a whole chapter and showed, in great detail, the tanks, riot police, and helicopters retaking ginza for the last half of it? <br><br>Fuck, I wish the last half of this was just watching Cobras strafing troop formations.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah something like that just instead of some ugly aliens there are beautiful monster girls and elf's and princes.</br>  <br>This. It should have included at LEAST as much fighting as the manga.<br><br><br>No there's aliens.<br/></br></br></br></br>  I'm worried about the monstergirls /a/. How will they handle them?  <br>damn that some good ass action 6 pages out of 26</br>  <br>Because the manga showed everything else about Ginza that the anime just dropped. <br><br>They didn't even show the Empire formally declaring war on Japan. I don't know if the novels had it, but it was one of the best scenes in that chapter.</br></br></br>  <br>not him, but even the anime equivalent of six pages of action would have been better than the ten seconds of showing army men generically firing off-screen.<br><br>6/26 pages of Manga, if we count each chapter as one episode (it's not), is still ten or so minutes of action that we didn't get.<br><br>They did a pretty fucking bad job showing Ginza.</br></br></br></br></br>  Fist episode is great, would have liked some gore but I'll let it slide    Those nips !! why do they like to screw up good things so badly when they already know what to do.  <br> Fist episode <br> Fist <br>Picked the fuck up</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if we'll ever get to the working girls in the anime. <br><br><br>Shh, just enjoy the show.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is the most 4th of july anime I could have asked for</br>  <br>1/3 of the ep showing action was enough. It didn't need any more useless action when more of the time could be spent setting up the premise which they did.<br><br>Besides you already know they defeated the 100,000 soldiers that came in through the gate. There's no point showing the whole fight, besides rows of JSDF firing guns aren't as dynamic as Itami choking a legionnaire.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm all for a fist episode</br>  Why do all the Japanese military have US weapons and vehicles?  <br>Go watch Symphogaeh</br>  <br>They seem to be heading there with the opening.<br><br>The Opening also gave us a scene where Rory</br></br></br>    <br>...comes out of the bathhouse with her battle axe in loose kimono.</br>  <br> The Opening also gave us a scene where Rory <br>Where Rory what? Oh god he died!</br></br>  <br> 1/3 of the ep showing action was enough. <br><br>most of it being sword guys slashing at the camera. <br>Again, a better way to show it would have been a few minutes of that, and then the military cleaning house.<br><br>I don't think they really showed just how outmatched the Empire was. They didn't show any of the scenes where the Empire tried to fight back or how their troop formations were worthless. It was just "guys firing off-screen at generic enemies for a few seconds - cut".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>rip anon</br>    So the only thing I don't get is why they are complaining about budget cuts during an invasion... Isn't that when most countries say fuck the economy and spend and much as we can on military needs?  <br>Why is she the flattest but also the best?</br>  <br>It's like you're trying to imply that DFC is not the best way a girl can be</br>  <br>Depends, in most case the equipment is Japanese but looks very much like US counterpart.<br><br>For example the Stinger and the Type 91( which turns out to be better than the burger).</br></br></br>    <br>Well, in THIS story the US is helping fund the JSDF to occupy the area. They're giving them equipment too.</br>  <br>Why would they? They were fighting off an invasion. A show of force wasn't the point. The point was to defend.<br><br>Show of force comes later.</br></br></br>    <br>She may be the best, but Piña Colada is the bestest</br>  <br>It becomes more prevalent later why they really care about that. Right now it's to show that politics are getting in the way of Japan's success.<br><br>Mild spoiler:<br>I don't know how they're going to do it in the anime, but it's to show that the Empire and Japan aren't all that different in political horseshit getting in the way of doing what needs to be done. <br><br>The politics of Empire and Japan result in them spending all of their time petrified that their neighbors are going to turn on them for something that they have. (The Gate, The Capitol)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> averagecivgame  <br><br>No no, if it was civ the knights would be winning.</br></br></br>  <br>She's alright for a lesbian.</br>    Do I have to watch Steins;Gate before watching this?  <br><br>Is this one of those thing where they showed pretty much all the best animation cuts in the trailer already so far or did they actually save some stuff for the show. A-1 is about as hit or miss as they come for the big studios this side of Toei lately. Sometimes I wonder if they were ever well equipped with a good enough overall structure to handle like 5-6 shows at the same time pretty much all the time.</br></br>  <br>Murrica pretty much provides all of the supplies for allies, either in design or manufacturing</br>  <br>Yes.</br>    <br> medieval plebs <br>not even, more elder plebs with less tech</br></br>  <br>She's actually a sadist.<br><br>She put all of the princess knights through hardcore training. (Based on her appearance on Gate - Pina Colada's Manga)</br></br></br>    <br>Is that canon? I haven't read that yet.</br>  <br>Jesus she is lewd.<br><br>I like it.</br></br></br>  <br>Omit them.</br>  <br>She's not a lesbian, she just really likes her fellow knights and wants to make them feel good. <br><br>You know, like friends.</br></br></br>      <br>I'm worried more they'll take the lazy route.<br><br> Lots of sameface whores with different colored hair and animal ears. </br></br></br>  <br>Don't she wants Itami's D too?</br>  Not gonna bother with this, A-1 are doing 5 shows this season    <br>Not that I know of. More like a working relationship at this point.</br>  <br><br>This seems to be all of Rory for now.</br></br>  I'm worried WAY MORE how they're going to handle the Battle of Alnus hill. <br><br>They were setting up for the first volley at the end of this episode. But are they going to show some of that, or skip it and save it for the old man's retelling later in the series? <br><br>Because worse case scenario is that they completely skim over it, barely showing anything except maybe some tank barrels.</br></br></br></br>  Jonathan's stand is The World.  <br>What do you mean?

Notice it's always used the term "truth" and not "reality".<br>GER power is to turn action, will and power to zero. Notice the english translation doesn't explicity states "powers".<br>Lastly to be stuck in the death loop you have to get hit physically by GER.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Knees weak</br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!
