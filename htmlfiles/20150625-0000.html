[ Is One Piece the most "red-pilled" of the anime?  It's about a freedom loving pirate gang that constantly opposes a totalitarian world government.  There are false flags and the pirates are always morally in the right, even if they are breaking the government's laws.        red-pilled <br/>    get btfo      red pilled   btfo   thinking one piece is the only series where this happens  Wan piss kiddies need to go back to /v/.       One Piece is the best anime   Ikr? Changed my life. Shame the manga's so shit though.   When I watch one piece I like to eat.  Usually I eat when Sanji's cooking food. It's like I am eating with the crew.     HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA   shhh       Naruto and Bleach are definitely more authoritarian and conservative, at least since the SS arc in Bleach's case.   NEW SYMPHOGEAR GX PV! GET HYPE, FAGGETS! IT'S REAL! https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CLc<wbr>pO8S8tvY</wbr>  [ ]       WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS TUMBLR FILTER BULLSHIT.   Looking forward to it. Hopefully it's better than G.      YES YES   finally   Pls don't bully   Seriously, how does this shit gets more season.  Season 1 was easily among the worst anime shows of all time.     She's too useless so even got kicked out from jail.      Because you have shit taste. Your favorite show will never get new season unless you paid money as us.    S2CA in the first episode  Cumming buckets    I don't understand, anon. How could you watch that PV and not instantly understand what people love this series for.  I for one am trying to hide my huge fucking happy grin after watching this during uni.    Remember, kids. Don't use LiNKER.  Can't. Stop. Watching.  That new song is lovely.  GUNGNIR  WUB WUB WUB DATTO? WUB WUB WUB      It's not ramen   Elfnine a cute  So i guess Maria won't have relic in s3 for first few episodes?  Who are you calling Raildex rejected character design?   villains are more girls with probably sad pasts and good intentions   I kinda miss season 1 when you had this feel of impending doom with noise fucking up the world at any time, was a decent setting for girls in armor fucking shit up.  dramatic villains will just make for more shitty added drama and pointless filler like season 2 felt mid-season.  will still enjoy the fuck out of this tho.         Yeah, it's broken according to the character description. But that didn't stop it from activating last season. She probably doesn't even have the pendant, Kirika and Shirabe didn't have theirs either.<br/>     determination to fist    [Megadeth Party intensifies]  I was just too excited, I'm sorry.     I hated both antagonists in S1 and S2 but yea S1 was amazing.     Too bad we're never going to be able to see it.   But the dolls are free to beat up without repercussions.   NOW I'VE LOST IT   Smug, isn't she?    Who voices who again? I only know Misaki Kuno.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shizu<wbr>ka_Ishigami  You will also see her in fall  </wbr>     That no-name resume  Disgusting.    Ned buntline93R is the villain.

Give the newbies a chance. I wonder how these people feel like, sitting in the same recording room as Nana Mizuki.     Shitty quality webm  puu dot sh/iAMos dot webm     Westphalia is relevant.     in the pastebin here<br/>     I would feel honored and pressured at the same time if ever I would have the opportunity to work with all those professional VAs in the industry. Regardless, I couldn't care less about a no-name VA like her.    no singing    She's not really no game anyway, just not getting crazy push like Amamiya Sora.    Marked as ひみつ, so secret characters.     Peace of Westphalia   relevant in the 21st century  Satelight, wot?     How gay will it be?  I want to protect that smile.   Not nearly enough.    Yeah, there's something to the tone that early S1 had that might not be able to be replicated here. On the other hand, there was plenty of room to improve on S2's take on villains, so the opportunity is there.    Are the new sluts gonna join Hibiki's harem too? We kinda have too many girls now.     Chrismind.      Oh look, a time paradox.    <br/>     08:24   08:23  Damn.       Dolls probably gonna die. No idea about the two twins. Maybe they will fuse and become one and then die or return to their home planet.    <br/>    Until what ends Bwen?   Subs never Fuck commeme       You should be able to recognize enough moonspeak to watch it raw now, anon.    So what song was this? OP or ED? The concert looks like it will be another highlight, but it will be tough to beat the previous ones.      You'd be surprised. If you are not actively trying to link the moonspeak you hear to the subtitles you are not gonna learn anything even if you watch anime for 50 years.    Neither. OP is called Exterminate and ED called Rebirth-Day. Probably gonna be a battle song. Sounds a lot like a finale song though.     MARIA DINDU NUFFIN JUST TRYIN GET HER LIFE ON TRACK NEED MO' MONEY FOR DEM CONCERTS     I am One with the Hype  IT'S HYPENING  How many songs are they going to fit into the first episode? Probably like 3 not including OP and ED, from the looks of the concert and likely two battles that they previewed. Excited   They'd feel awkward at first, but once they see Nana is kind and acts like a grade schooler sometimes they'll warm up eventually. Then they'll be reminded of their position again once Nana starts to do her job and once they see her sing live.     I hope at least red and blue do. They are cute as fuck.     Don't you know in Symphogear universe the leader of NSA is also the leader of Illuminati?    mfw see this  FUCK YES     Symphogear game by Platinum when?   Tsubasa looks like a man, holy shit.

Do people actually think this is a good show or is it just a meme show?   We're all just here because we want to fuck Chris Or get fucked by Tsubasa Or watch Miku and Hibiki make out      Good action, amazing music, fun characters, interesting mythology of the show, ending of S1 is GOAT.

I mean, you'd look pretty dumb if you called something shit without ever watching it.      Just an observation on how the other boards are correct in the statement of moe anime and /a/, not saying it's bad.   Saw Season 1 and 4 episodes of Season 2. First few episodes were pretty interesting but it all came back to moe shit. The final fight was alright though.         There's plenty of worse stuff than Symphogear mind you. I thought it was ok to watch, story may not be spectacular but was enjoyable to watch.     people describe what they like about Symphogear   dismiss it out of hand   posts western shit <br/>      http://anoxy.se/uploads/2015/06/2qu<wbr>32w8qg6ytzdr.webm</wbr>   So guys, what are the lyrics for Dark Oblivion anyway?

Maria will be useful again        http://www.animelyrics.com/anime/sy<wbr>mphogearg/darkoblivion.htm Really good english. Hikasa just butchered the pronounciation. </wbr>     those vagina bones  It looks quite weird but its lewd as hell. I liked Tsubasa's G gear more, why do they have to remove parts of their already revealing gears? Are they prostitutes or something?       Are they prostitutes or something?  Idols. Same thing really.     Hibizerker will appear as a separate entity, have a crazy punch-on with Hibiki, then be tamed by the power of SUNSHINE.    They should've let Ayahi sing that, for god's sake. Nana x Ayahi duet when?     Are you implying Nana is a prostitute? Don't compare actual pure idols to the sluts that fuck everyone for money and don't give a shit about their fans.        Nana   Idol   Bitch she's an artist.      Did they put Maria in a goddamn straitjacket What are they afraid she'll do, cry at them?    They're afraid her uselessness might spread to other Gears.    She is called an idol too by some people, fucker.     That was the joke.   Now post what you hear her singing.      But Tsubasa isn't a prostitute. If anything she'll be the one to buy the prostitutes.      Tsubasa became Chris' new pimp     Please no bully. Chris is pure.     That doesn't stop her from having a youth full of hard work.       Tsubasa-senpai please stop with your heart hymen thing.       not hibiki  what    That concert looks even more amazing than in G. I can't wait for the song.    So did they ever explain how supposedly human characters could chuck boulders and sprint across water?  Also the fact that they're bringing back the shitty G Gears is making me reeeeeeeeee       chuck boulders  Eat, sleep and movies.   sprint across water  Ninja.        Miku already bought them all.   So did they ever explain how supposedly human characters could chuck boulders and sprint across water?  Ogawa is literally a ninja. Genjuro is just that manly.         nolongerpodracing.jpg     They watched lots of action movies.  reeeeeee  Fuck off back to       Jesus Christ this PV almost dislocated my jaw. I'm going to need to buy a stand of some sort before the first episode if I want to come out unscathed.    She got a boobpad instead.    The House of Ogawa  The House of Ogawa: Descendants of ninjas from the Hida clan. A long time ago, the Ogawa family worked for Toyotomi Hideyoshi, but they disappeared during the Battle of Sekigahara until they reappeared after the Meiji Restoration to work for the government. Since then, they've fought to subvert the country's domestic enemies who work to try and bring down the government. The previous leader of the family, Ogawa Kunimitsu, died and the eldest brother of the siblings, Souji, took over. The second eldest, Shinji, used his abilities to become a direct agent of the government. Suteinu, the youngest brother, was freed from any familial responsibility because he did not want to inherit the old traditions. So he became a host at a hostclub in Kabukichou, Shinjuku known as "Absolute Zero." There he's known as the No.4 host "Alan" and works throughout the nights. The technique that Tsubasa utilizes, Shadow Weaving, was originally Ogawa Shinji's forte. Tsubasa was attracted to the convenience of the move and mastered it over the course of 3 years.   chuck boulders  Eat, sleep and watch movies.         So no then. Because it bugs me when a show tries to keep a consistent set of rules, but then throws in Kill la Kill "lol anything goes" whenever it wants.  Also who else looking forward to more awful Engrish this season?         Genjuro is consistently a badass. Ogawa is consistently a ninja. I don't see the problem here.      consistent set of rules  You might be in the wrong thread, anon, this is for Symphogear.     holy shit that combination song, dat PV, dem witches and actually exploring something outside of relics and shit. just so damn hype.     You take anime too seriously anon.   I'M FUCKING READY    no chris boobpad   no hibiki buttpad   no pad with tsubasa's finely toned   back  why even live?        no chris boobpad  This exists.      Ow my nutbladder.      dat bikki on a rocket  she gonna explode the damn moon with gungnir isn't she? jesus christ i'm hype here.       Believe in justice and hold a determination to fist.     But it is consistent. What was the quote from Kaneko again? Hobbies have power in this world or something like that?     tfw she actually did it   against senpai   and won        sprint across water  Ogawa came from an ancient ninja clan   chuck boulders  Eats, watches movies and sleeps   G Gears a shit  the only shit here is your taste   reeeee <br/>             HIBIKE   HIBIKE     I'd say that you're watching the wrong anime, but Ogawa and Genjuro are actually consistent. Ogawa's from a ninja clan and Genjuro is just that strong (he can't fight Noise only because he'd get turned to carbon like any other human)    TSUTAE S U T A E          implying he doesn't simply tie relic fragments to his hands and punches the shit out of them in his spare time in between training     UTAE UTAE     hooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOO    The lewdest.   We got Rebirth-Day cd cover but EXTERMINATE WHEN!?   There's one for every Geah.    Okay, guys, I tried my best translating this song. Here you go  Title: Radiant Force  The beginning sound The beginning beat The sound of hope is resounding If we don't give up on living, Show it, the beginning of our burning dream Burst open, this miracle Is not a lie  What can those hands seize? Perhaps, just holding is not enough What can those hands protect? This running heat is the spark that will lighten tomorrow  Now, let's pull the trigger to a new age Countdown to a future of legend We won't fly alone Overcome the past, beyond it, the future we must create is blooming fiercely  Tie up our bonds and hearts into one The sound of hope is resounding If we don't give up on what we believe, Sing, the possibility is not zero Fly, this miracle Is the light                                I just downvoted you're PV how does that feel symphofags?!   Edgewitch is going to get befriended so damn hard, I can't wait.  It makes me want to  fist  you.        You mean hopefully the fanbase is better than G's.

I rarely see discussions about Manwha, so I decided to make a little thread it.  I'll start by posting the whore that has pissed me off more than Enju from Dice.    Want a godlike manwha? Go read Shin Angyo Onshi.  gook shit is not /a/ related   So where should we talk about it? Most manga sites have manwha anyways.    Not anime or manga  Dice is the best webtoon.   U misspelled red storm   Anon, would you a ho?  manhwa is horrible. I absolutely hate the current flood of shitty manhwa comics that are more akin to western comics than to manga. They often suffer from a ridiculous plot line, poorly drawn art and also, copy famous manga to a sickening extent. Don't even get me started on chinese ''manga'' which is so bad it makes me wonder if the chinese are invested with any modicum of creativity, if at all.  Stop appropriating Japanese art culture you sub-human gooks no one likes your shit.     It's should be /a/   Because Manhua and Manhwa is literally what Manga is pronounced in Chinese and Korean respectively. Just like how you don't differentiate between Onee-chan and Sister normally. Anyway I've never seen a janitor 404 a manhua thread yet, not that they usually last very long.       They often suffer from a ridiculous plot line, poorly drawn art and also, copy famous manga to a sickening extent  So, nothing different from manga, then?     This    Ouch, that hurts.    anywhere but here    Tower of god is great, what I don't like is the lame clothes of the character there.      GET THE FUCK OUT OF /A/ YOU GOOKS ! GO READ YOUR SUB-PAR STUPID WEBCOMICS ELSEWHERE      It's hard to take "badass" character seriously when they look like skater punks.   I like manhwa and I read them from time to time, but holy fuck why most of them run for 300 chapters? While the stories are not bad, they tend to drag it so fucking much it gets me fucking angtsy and I just read the wiki. Tower of God, dice, and Girls of the wild and 3 big examples of mad dragging.  Jack Frost is best manhwa.  Daily reminder that The Breaker's team are the biggest bitches in the manwha industry.  Post the zombie hunters.     tower of god   girl backstabbing best boy    we learn that her only motivation is just to watch stars   wtfamireading.jpg       subhuman shit   Fuck off.     Possible 1-2 year hiatus. Why do they do this to us.   Is there something wrong with  Godoka sites?  I am getting ssl_error_rx_record_too_long  Also did you guys read some Chinese Manhwa like Long Hu Men? It didn't have a nice story but still enjoyable.      Just like anything, majority of them are total shit. There's definitely great hidden gems, though most are untranslated.  Gook shit is usually abysmal with a few exceptions, but Tower of god is indeed really good.   I read Chinese Manhua to see them throw sparkly things at each other and shout their moves which can destroy planets and stuff. Most of them are more Dragon ball than Dragon ball and 10x as ridiculous.   Rak is best boy.    I rarely see discussions about Manwha  They happen occasionally. Sometimes they last long. But no one wants to put up with the "lel, gook shit doesn't belong in /a/" despite evidence to the contrary.  Anyways, that reminds me that I haven't read the last two or so chapters of ToG. Also, when was The Gamer supposed to start back up?   Slut. Almost as shit as Rachel.             but holy fuck why most of them run for 300 chapters?  Honestly, who knows? I can only assume they're trying to copy some of the larger manga.  Tower of God makes sense to be fuck long, because of the nature of its story, but Girls of the Wild should have ended ages ago. I pretty much dropped it around the time the shut-in brother was introduced, and I don't know what I even read it that far. Is it seriously still going?       Mod already said it's allowed long time ago, back when /q/ was around. Still won't change people bickering about it though.    Cat girl won. He claimed MC with a kiss and telling him, 'Remember what I said the first time we met? YOU'RE MINE'.     Cat girl won  I do not mind this, actually. Rich girl seemed kind of bland, but the story seemed to be pinning them together. Did he seriously end up with cat girl, or did she just steal a kiss?      All the 'manhwa' you listed are webcomics which run weekly, and 5 years of runtime really isn't that long.  To compensate for the increased workload, they need to fill the comic up with fillers, which is why when you marathon some parts will feel heavily dragged on.      tfw Priest will never get an ending  That movie didn't make things better either.    She stole it, Queen will win because she is the queen.   It's not anime or manga   no 10th dimensional boys anymore     bam finally catches up to rachel   they finally get to talk   she fucking pushes him down again  What the fuck man. Dude just what the fuck.        She truly deserves to rot alone just for the sake of watching stars.    While I don't really follow the newest chapter of Tog but I think that Baam is too clingy, reminds me of Mikasa relationship with Eren.    He seriously had it coming. Did he not see that see that coming? Holy fuck, but it was funny.      I hope to god that Baam finally learned his lesson but considering the retard he is, he probably didn't.  I just want him to be happy with androssi or the pink flame girl, xiaxia, whoever.  Just forget about the whore and climb the tower peacefully until FUG comes to ruin it again.        So what do people think about this? I thought it was pretty interesting to be honest. The story could have been done better, and there's too much left unexplained, but it's still nice to read.    It's pretty damn bad lately. but even ToG or Breaker had a time when they were somewhat interesting before. I don't know what the fuck they were doing to fuck it up like this.  SAO, Ares, The Breaker and maybe Which Hunter, there used to be a time when i thought the koreans might have some potential in the future. But then Webtoons came along. That format killed every ounce of talent they could have had.  And manhua will probably never get good for me. there is just something fundamentally different about the way they tell their stories.       Shouldn't this be in /co/?  Does baam get pushed before or after the time skip?    Everyone is still hoping that Baam will finally grow a spine and grow up but then he would have no major motivation to climb the tower.  And that's a major problem for SIU, he litetally wrote Baam in to be ultra dependent on Rachel.   That and SIU loves Rachel so there's no way he'd kill her off easy. Fuck man.         Both.    No, this isn't a hollywood super hero movie or show.    Both.     Both. The dumb fuck got pushed twice and from the looks of it he still hasn't learned his lesson.  Fuck you SIU        SIU loves Rachel  Seriously? Or is that just your conclusion based on how the story treats her?   That said, there's always the possibility SIU will flip-flop, and turn Rachel into an ally.        it ain't manga either    It would be unrealistic at this point to have Bam NOT be clingy to Rachel. His entire life up to that point revolved around one single person, and only on the occasion that she would visit him in that cave. So in between all of that dark shit loneliness, there was a light that would visit him once and a while.   So I think it's a natural response that not only is he clingy to her still, but he wants to know why she betrayed him. Plus without her he has little actual motivation to climb the tower at all.     I really liked Afterschool War Activities. I think it would make into a nice live TV series (a Korean one).   There's this one post from a mod you see every other manhwa thread. It basically asks the same question you ask, but the mod confirms that it's fine here. I'm sure someone will post it.    Its read left to right and colored, looks like /co/      Men can be dumb when they are clingy, I bet you'll do the same if you were dying and alone, and found yourself someone to connect with.     Doulou Dalu is best webcomic    After the ending of season one, he did a Q&amp;A on naver and when he was asked who his favorite character was he responded with Rachel.  He dislikes Koon the most because Koon is a smart character type and has to think hard for Koon's plans and dialogue .      Technically this is not a question aimed towards manwha alone, but all manga in general. Do you guys get huge autism and suddenly drop translated chapters if they only come in two pages online?  I have dropped decent series because of this. My autism goes to new levels when I try to read two paged manga online and make me stop reading.    NEX DID NOTHING WRONG    there are people who haven't read korean berserk yet  holy shit, how doesn't everyone know this series yet?     Its corean    Mods have said it goes in /a/ before, as it's Korean. Until a mod says otherwise, it does in /a/. We point this out nearly every thread.    I bet you'll do the same if you were dying and alone, and found yourself someone to connect with.  Doesn't mean we have to like a character just because his upbringing was shit.       korean webcomice have almost no standards for story or art.  i wish they weren't listed on MU. same with chinese novels. fuck them     I heard that the manhwa version made it too kid friendly because it was obviously aimed for them compared to the more adult novel version.  Go read the novel version       Obviously it's his favorite character, she's fucking dumb as fuck. Goes all edgelord and shit, and backstab her closest friend, why? Because she wants to fucking go watch motherfucking stars in the top. She can choke on those motherfucking stars all she wants, like holy fuck how stupid can you be, sometimes I think the author just wants to make her autistic. Like how can't you understand people relationships, and why the fuck do you then get jealous because Baam has more friends now.  Complete garbage. This pisses me off than watching NTR hentai.      Yes, I understand his in-character to be a clingy man. I loved Baam's monologue about Rachel too. It felt so strong compared to any mango I read.    wait they made a webcomic for that? shit, i've just been reading the raws, is it on batoto or am i gonna actually hunt for it?     I just wish they weren't so terribly colored, or shaded. Or whatever the fuck they call that art style     chinese novels  Fuck Wuxia/Xianxia, the whole genre is garbage.     Nah, shit pretending-to be-deep-edgy series.     Mods have said it goes in /a/ before  Nobody cares what /co/'s nigger mods have to say.     I've heard something similar. The Tofu guy in the webtoon actually had sausage powers in the novel, and the dick jokes were replaced by "bad smell" jokes.    I mean, I agree to a degree that her betraying him just to look at starts is stupid, but I think you're thinking about it in a pretty short sighted way. We don't know anything about her motivations yet at all.  You're making the assumption that she betrayed him for the most shallowest of reasons. I'm going to give SIU the benefit of the doubt and say that we don't yet know her real intentions.     Yeah, I'm up to date with the novel I just like how fun the manhwa is    Because /co/ a shit   I've stopped following ToG a few years ago. Baam is still gary stu as fuck?    Go look on mangacow for chapters up to 80 ish.  Mangacow gave up translating it and some other group is now.  Or you could read the translated novel chapters.         I remember one chapter when she was having her bullshit star dreams she only talks about, and only woke up because she saw Baam been taken over her new friends and got buttmad.  The fuck?      Just ignore those newfag. Just by lurking they will understand what is allowed and what is not.     gary stu as fuck?   He was just overleveled post-timeskip from all the grinding.      How in the fuck is Baam a gary stu? Guy had a horrible life and the one person that he likes keep trying to teach him as fly in the hard way.    I love manwha more than manga lately  Hngg Dice  mfw there will never be an anime        She's apparently scared of Baam. Or scared of the dark/night. Probably both, seeing how Baam's name means "night". And of course Rachel's name means "Light".     Do you enjoy the autistic female lead? I sure don't.  muh perfect school life   fucking dice        It's been butchered to be kid friendly.     Yeah. But you have to understand that the character he is given is meant to be a gary stu. Irregulars and what not. Like fucking onii-sama.  Ohh shit. I forgot about that. Okay, I'm still going to hope that theres more to it than just her getting all butt hurt over him have friends.  He's a total gary stu man. Almost everyone who meets him eventually likes him. SIU stopped killing characters and most people live and become part of the team now. Bams whole character literally revolves around being stronger than everyone else, it's what an irregular is meant to be. His latent ability is literally copying everyone elses moves and then doing it better.         forgot pic   The hatred towards Rachel will only intensify or lessen depending on the author. I remember every comment of the chapters i was reading, shitting on lizard girl, and now it's less since we got the backstory. That being said, it all depends on how the author wants to write her backstory. It's obvious that the author of Tower of God is just stalling because he doesn't know how to validate a bullshit reason like going watch stars as something strong enough to make her such a shit person.    He's loved or liked by everyone he comes around and has so many shit going on for him it's not funny. He's an irregular with OP ability to resist shinsoo and absorb all techniques, trained by FUG, has a Thorn and was able to scratch the strongest man in the Tower while being a complete newfriend. He also has a nice personality on top of it and whole harem of girl wanting his D including a princess of the tower. By the end of series he will unironically approach or surpass the level of madara uchiha copypasta. Tell me that he's not a gary stu.     You don't know what gary-stu mean.   I just want half of the cast to die. I'm not being edgy or anything, it's just that it's too much. SIU is being a pussy with every character he introduces and the cast will eventually become Nartuo tier where there are too many people, and not enough time to spend on each and every one of them.  He's making everyone join their damn team too. Just get rid of half of the new cast and throw out some of the old team too. It would make the chapters a little more exciting as well if there was some death.    what the fuck happened to madokami.  it still worked yesterday    His skill/ability is Gary Stuish. His life is a bit because suddenly those daughter of Zahhard loved him, those whatever stronk faction want to use him, only Rachel despises him.    <br/>    I was really expecting for Baam to destroy the train while he was falling again, but what? He fainted or something?     literally what Manga is pronounced in Chinese and Korean respectively  Which is actually surprising considering how many drastic changes the medium took over the last how many decades and how many authors thought whatever the were doing wasn't manga anymore. See A Drifting Life. The history of the term is actually way more complicated than anyone ever seems to think.   Traditionally made manhwa is a hell of a lot better than the cheaply done and mass produced webtoons they do these days. Which is actually a real damn shame. Webtoon format is pretty awful, and few use it well (and not enough close enough to not feel like it's completely for accomodating mobile devices and destroying any semblance of technique in panelling. Basically screw Tezuka.) They're not all completely awful, but they're probably more derivative than shitty shounen manga and the fact they didn't go through the same evolution or time span like manga speaks volumes for the quality. Where are their Otomo or Tezuka?        and was able to scratch the strongest man in the Tower  Wrong, he is the 4th. Baam scratching him or even surviving that hit was really retarded, but is just a case of shit writing.    Can Baam defeat Servants?    She wants to see the stars because she wants to be the main character of a fairy tale, just like that story she liked.  She she's legitimately scared of Baam because he's the one who opened the door to the tower and has the traits of an irregular.  Even headon said that she wasn't meant to be in the tower and only gave her a chance after making a deal with her.  Baam is a nuisance to her and she fears him.            shitting on lizard girl  People hated Anak before her backstory?   he doesn't know how to validate a bullshit reason like going watch stars as something strong enough to make her such a shit person.  It kinda seems like she WANTS him to climb the tower in these last couple chapters.    By the end of series he will unironically approach or surpass the level of madara uchiha copypasta  And then we'll have a new copypasta to shitpost.            To be honest its been about 2 years since I read ToG. You might be right.   Kamisama has hiccups all the damn time. Give it a day and itll probably be fixed.       Are we talking about Thorn-powered Baam who mastered the Supreme King's Scorching Fist of Death?    Nigga did you see how big that train was? I don't remember how long, but they've already been on the train for a couple of months and Rachels crew aren't even close to the front.    So upon meeting Baam constantly, Rachel is not scared of him?    How strong is that Supreme King's Scorching Fist of Death?   Hwa Ryun best girl.    Baam is essentially a mage that can copy your attack and use it better than you.  In addition to at least having a Saber class's strength and Rider's speed when he goes all out.  He's broken as fuck.         My nigga    Is Baam hypersonic?    This is almost word for word the current status of manga.    I hope you enjoyed their new announcement, although the bitches complaining might have overturned it somewhat. They were going to stop novels being added anymore and focus again on manga.    He has at least one movement technique that allows him to go fast.   Androssi best girl. Fuck that Rachel slut.     and use it better than you  Since when? The move he copies from Mazino (or however you spell that guy's name) I don't believe was even close to the same level. He still has to practice, even if only less.       She's scared of him but she knows that Baam doesn't have the balls to kill her.  She wants to be main character of her own story as she climbs the tower to see the stars, but every time she climbs up, a dark shadow called Baam reminds her that it isn't her story and that she is a fake.  Every time Baam meets her she is reminded that he is the chosen irregular and that she only got in becsuse she begged for a deal from headon.         No, it isn't, you're full of shit.     Androssi   not a slut  Hwa Ryun is the only true best girl.      How fast, exactly?    You're right, it's more akin to LNs.     Androssi   a slut  She's one of those virgins who pretend to be experienced, but doesn't know shit.  She'd be killed just for touching a dick.         SIU did call her the most beautiful girl in the cast and that beauty will play a large role in the future.      implying she will ever  She's probably to afraid of getting killed like the Gekko girl mother. She has to remain perma-virgin.   Wasted goods.       I've stopped following ToG a while ago, is her motivation at least somewhat clear now or she's still hiding everything about herself?    Too bad she's dead weight. She can't do anything other than look pretty and guide.   Baam will change the order in tower and impregnate everyone. Racher will be degraded into breeding sow.   I believe in him      To put in short terms, he can outrun people of his own level.  If you and Baam were of the same level, he could outrun you.  Nonetheless, there a bigger monsters than can instakill Baam if they wanted to.          I don't know.The one thing that's stopping me from getting into it is that the names sound too strange.  The nouns are all "syoong" "blook" "schlorp", it sounds like the frogpeople from fucking Rlyeh are trying to speak.        her class is guide   can't do anything but guide  anon.      She seems willing to break that rule for Baam, so I guess you just have to get her wet enough to not mind dying.   No, Hwa Ryun's motives are still completely unexplained, beyond the usual FUG "We want you to become our God".        She's still hiding her motives but it involves Baam doing something for her when he becomes powerful enough.  That and just teasing him/ being half serious when she calls him her God.       Answer the fucking question, you claimed that he was faster than Rider, back your claim.     She was skilled enough to handle some average regulars, but her main job is to be pretty and be a fucking guide.    WHERE THE FUCK IS THE NEW CHAPTER OF CAVALIER OF THE ABYSS?  If Baam can copy other people ability, is he kinda the same as medaka minus 20-30% of the abilites he didn't fully mastered    I'm only interested in the rape so there isn't much to discuss.      If Rider and Baam had the same rank speed (A+), Baam would be able to outrun Rider.  If rider used her mount, Baam would eat shit. He isn't that fast with his technique.       Not that anon, but Baam is a genius; if he sees someone use a technique for moving at super-sonic speeds, he can probably copy it on the fly. That's been his gimmick since "season 2".  That said, he can move fast enough to catch a ball at extremely high speeds. (Though he preferred to just freeze the ball in place)      /co/ is that way -------------------------&gt;   Not /a/. Fuck off to /co/ or /b/ or tumblr or whatever.  Kimchi literally shit.    Girls d th wilds man. What a piece of shit. Dropped i think 4 chapters after MC kicked the bully's ass. After that i felt the creator had no idea the fuck he was doing.  My biggest gripe with ToG writing is these shitty games that are introduced every couple of chapters. There's always like a shit load of exposition and it's completely useless. That last game with the angry ball thing was pointless.  how mad were you during this moment    if he sees someone use a technique   technique  Yes, a technique, servants have hypersonic speed as base status, and a NP isn't a technique.         Even if he did copy it, he would be able to use as well as them  Granted, the fucker learns very fast, he would still need time to practice.       You mean mad at the last moment this shit was actually any good?     FUG is a pretty bad name. Does it stand for something? I forgot. How do you pronounce it? Like each letter separated, eff you gee? Or literally all together, fug.      that moment in second part when Rachel cuts the legs of runner guy    They are just finnish.    oh fugg xD     Aye, Rider is naturally fast because of her stats but so is Baam.  Baam in one of the most recent chapters jumped several thousand feet in seconds to put things into perspective.  In a fight without noble phantasm, Baam has the bigger chance of winning, but rider uses her NP's he's done for.        Which is superior, /a/?  Traps or tomboys?     futas   What if a tomboy fell in love with a trap?  Better yet, did we even have any series about this type of romance?     tomboys you sick dick craving fuck     Struggling to sauce these. Is the last one Adam in Puberty by any chance?      Literally what the link says fuckwit.   Daily reminder that you'll never have the chance to lick the delicious salty sweat off Vice prez' perfect body just to have your back whipped for this insult.  Why live /a/ ?    http://www.javlibrary.com/ja/?v=jav<wbr>liitjs4  VP is a whore.  </wbr>   3D urgh. Disgusting    why would you even post this here?    Because he's not a Meikofag    Shes not hana so why should i give a fuck    You'll never get peed on by Hana Anon. We're all the same    Because your favorite girl a shit. A SHIT.    that feel when she'll never spit on me.   School Noire is best Noire.  Close      This is Nepgear.    being best of shit   OK.      Correct. Would you like a cookie?    Do you have a best girl instead? I'd rather have something more meaningful than a cookie.    Who then, is best girl, anon? There are many girls that are not bad, but only one can be best.     Vert       Apron Noire is fine too      Iris is best.      I want her to step and spit on me.     -Best- Nep, Vert, Puru, Rei/CPU, PH, YH  -pretty good- Noire, Blanc, Uni, pko, Rom, Uni (cpumode), IH  -ok- BH, Ram (cpumode), nepgear, nepgear (cpumode)  -meh- Ram, WH, GH, Rom (cpumode)              Best   Sweating, trembling, and moaning Noire while Nep watches is best Noire.     /v/   You need to live with the fact that this is legit animu.      It's great when she shows affection     This is God Eater-chan  Purpuru Heartu  So, Neptune knows, and is just trolling her, right? (See also Vert and Chika.)   And her thighs.     whatsherface is joining Blancs game.    There were no pantyshots in the anime, right. I was hoping for some of Ge-Ge's pink-white shimapan.    and 1/2 Under+1/2 Sideboob-chan is joining Nep VII, wish the game would come to steam already.    We will never see the new goddess in an official manga.  Wouldn't now be a good time to fire up an anime sequel, though?      Which Nep has the best one?   She is a pure girl, she doesn't wear such things.    Nope, the only thing close to it was the beach episode when she got fooled of not wearing any swimsuit.   Shh... Ram and Rom are sleeping  Who Purubutt here?   MAGES has the sluttiest navel.    But she has no friends?     god eater   no freedom wars neps      i fucking with we got another season, but im not sure there enough material seeing as how they slapped 3 games in 12 episodes.     I'd do some raunchy, demeaning shit to Noire  and I wouldn't call her the next day.    That's not very nice.     That a prefect butt for spank     It's part of my plan. By the third day, she'll come crawling back for more. After that, she's mine.    I'd rather just lick her. Much more satisfying for both parties.   I want to confess to Blanc.   I'm going to lick her for a whole night to seal the deal. Either that or just rub her for a few hours.    I believe in you anon Try to not die     Blanc a shit  flat   gets angry easily   comes with excess baggage (twin bratty sisters)        I want Blanc to sit on my lap and read all day while I play games.   not liking flat chested girls  Literally a faggot.      PC port killed the nepenp.   fuck off Garrett     all these PC-only days who will never have Nisa and Gust in their party or experience the mess known as HDN  You're not a true Nep Nep fan until you've gone through a whole game using nothing but Neptune Break.     PC-only fags*     They're called secondaries anon. And most of them just browse /v/ thankfully.     I guess I'm a special snowflake that has never set foot on /v/ and I'm a PC only fag.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=L3-<wbr>jUh0VLDY</wbr>  [ ]   Yeah you're just a secondary, congrats.  Anyway post some nep.      What exactly does "secondary" mean here? Haven't watched the annie mays either.    tfw Black Heart is still raping me      I want PH to dominate me while taking ques from Iris.   I love Neps   Nep loves me.  I wish ;_;    Needs more purple in here.  Lastation neps are best neps  What's this face trying to convey?   Sexual pleasure    Happiness.     you wouldn't a Vita   Of being  neped  inside?         All these uni, my Uniggas.       Easily the most nepable.    time to recharge your batteries, Uni~    Rebirth 3 soon  Can't wait to beat it so I can finally watch the anime. What am I in for?    This adorable little monster.   Wait, Sega had an American founder. Does this make Neptune and the other Planetune girls half-breeds?  I want to sexually fuck noire   how does one non-sexually fuck Noire?    I want to give Noire a copy of PH and my honeymoon night.    I like bullying Noire as much as the next anon, but pic related makes me sad.   Why theres no CPU that representing PC yet ?   We don't need the CPUs to get BTFO because PC &gt; console.    Too over powered. The girls would need some plot armor since she would be a major threat to all the goddess.     [soiler] That girl is such a bitch, fuck Noire [/spoiler]        3DS port when? Vert imoutos when? X-BOX handheld when?     I bet she has smooth thighs. I want to bury my face in them.   Nepgear is the  purest      You can have your purity. I want a lustful NepNep.    Please don't sexualize the Neps    they sexualize themselves.    If I don't sexualize her in some way, how are we supposed to have kids?        As with PC-Tan, how can you really have one single face to represent all of PCdom? Moreover, Gameindustri is isolated like how Japan is to the whole world around it. God forbid Nepnep go abroad instead of being just a mere slider.  A CPU that may represent PCs would be at a level beyond the existing Neps, and dominate over a whole empire outside of gameindustri. She'd be like some conceptual god with several platform that operate on the hardware along with a huge number of makers. She'd be like the Roman empire who is fighting all the barbaric consoles and the heathen mobile platforms.  Gameindustri would just be this one front out of the whole console war, and that's not factoring in all the alt dimensions outside of hyperdimension at that.           If you treat console in the sense of platform, then Steam-chan would be there, along with Origin, Uplay, GOG and studio-specific platforms such as Battle.net. PC is Balkanized and it's about as Roman as the (un)holy Roman empire.   Come to think of it, platform cohesion of iOS and Android far exceeds the segmented PC through more draconian default web store enforcement (at least those two can somewhat trace to UNIX and are distant relative of the inconsequential non-gaming platform o' Linux)       And when Linux-tan gets drunk she tries to play games, but sometimes weird shit happens to her somehow.   Being Vert is suffering   Kinect is not a younger sister. It's just accessory.  Although Vert would have a rather distant cousin in Surface line tablets that aren't marketed as gaming consoles.     Isn't she the only one to actually remove her garments in that one episode?   Who's the best mascot character and why is it Cave?     Explain her appeal. Honest question.    She's beautiful. Pretty chill too. Arguably one of the more normal characters. Sometimes when everyone else seems to be crazy normal is good. Though she is a bit socially awkward which can also be cute.    Dat exe drive though. I don't know why they made hers so much stronger than everyone else.   Noire is nowhere near my favorite but I want to rescue her from a life of loneliness when she's at her absolute most depressed and then nuture her and fall in love.  Also: She's kinda a bitch. I noticed she's the only CPU who acts like a bitch to her sister. Noire constantly acts passive aggressive towards Uni tears her down, belittles her, and makes backhanded compliments all the time.     Peashy is PC Engine (TurboGrafx-16.)    iF a best though.     Cave is pretty great.  would /a/ have gone to Neptune's concert?       I would go, rain, snow or shine. Because I love Neptune.    Gee, I wonder who could be behind this post.    Best Nep   If we're talking about pc, then how would Valve look like as a maker? kind of fair game now that you can be a secondary through buying in at steam sale and all.   fuck off, Noire is shit and she clearly abandoned Nep in that picture. Only dedicated anons like me and the one you're responding too are dedicated enough to go no matter what.    THANK YOU PURPLE HEART.    *perfect heart     implying the PC wasn't the original True Goddess       Ran-ran a best.    What is she / it? Not bullying, just curious.    I want Compa to give me a paizuri while Noire sucks me off.     thats not what secondary means     (´・ω・｀)   She represents the emoticon.            where is nude mod   New hotness        I want Iris Heart and Kurumi to gang bang me       Reminder that Uzume&gt;Puru   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127106553  But anon we can only see up to 24fps    Google it.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127106553  Even though I'm a PCfag I don't usually get bothered by FPS as much as other people. But still the console Nep games' framerate drops were pretty fucking ridiculous, even Victory had that problem.    I didn't exactly hate her, but I have to agree with that statement. A lot of the comedy surrounding Iris Heart felt stale after the first few gags. Uzume is a more interesting character in my opinion, and she had more relevance to the main story too.         okay     Has Tsunako Gone Too Far?     I'd drink that water    Not yet, we can still go further, further beyond the boundaries of lewd     Nepgear with an IF like ribbon  Huh, I didn't even know I wanted this until I saw it, weird.      not very many lewd pics of the neps by fans   she more than makes up for them herself  And bless her for it.      Except its exactly what it means...? What do you define as secondary? I've always defined it as someone who gets into a series from the most accessible point while ignoring the original material. The people who start from the originals are primary fans and the people who start from the gateway are secondaries.  Is this wrong?       loligeddon  whose subs did they use     they edited commie's     edited  Less memey?     I want her to sit on my face.     editing Commie subs  Good heavens, how horrifying.    I want to do lewd to Buran   Only Tsunako can lewd the neps. We've discussed this many times already.    Fuck that I want her to carry my babies      Beru sure is cute...      She would look cute pregnant, wouldn't she?     How do get high-tier waifus like these?   what do you mean?   who is the greatest character in the fate series and why is it kirei?  Kirei and Shirou's date at the chinese restaurant is my favorite part in the Fate series.  The slurping noises, the sweating, and Kirei persistently trying to get Shirou to try a bite had me in hysterics the whole time.  If this part isn't in the Heaven's Feel movie adaption, I will be extremely mad.       Kirei is good, but not as great as these kings   Gil is the most amusing.    The 2nd PV https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=flc<wbr>Yx70r4aE</wbr>  [ ]    So what's up with the story of Aquarion, now? I remember watching the original series and thought it was pretty cool but never watched the second series.   Bump   YOU MADE A GOOD CHOICE!  Part 2 will leave you in such butthurt that watching the part 3 pv will only rub salt in your wounds.       Who are we kidding? We all know it will be shit.  will mc get cucked again?   Don't waste your time with evol, it's just women fucking dogs.    is mari okada helping write it?       MC is actually a dog who cucked it's master   I still don't know why are you all as butthurt as that gay angel.        12,000 years we've waited for this..    No, its being done by the guy in charge of The Marie Show and Psycho Pass 2. Now you're probably wishing it was Okada.     Because Zessica got absolutely nothing for her efforts  and Mikono was written as useless as possible and never allowed to do ANYTHING AT ALL until the last episode asspullorama    No OSORE, why bother.   Both of those shows were passable.    Okada is awesome when she's not trying to sound smart.     Because Zessica got absolutely nothing for her efforts   Well she IS a side character. Main girls always win no matter what.      They got rid of all of Zessica's charms for the "reincarnation". Watch is probably the other girl that he reincarnation that became like that to copy Mikono.     Main girl was ranked behind background girls with no lines.      Psycho-Pass 2   passable      I had fun watching it. I don't quite get why people hate it so much.  It wasn't anything awesome though.      Great way to ignore that everyone fucking hated the main girl and even other writers suggested letting Zessica win instead. Kawamori was the only one pushing for Mikono.     even other writers suggested letting Zessica win instead.   Sauce on this?      Best Girl on the right detected.     Because Zessica got absolutely nothing for her efforts  Wrong. Her character design was reused in the sequel for the winning girl.     So she's not the main girl after 12000 years?     not  now*     EVOL looked better, good music, fun characters, some good episodes. But overall it's not as good as the original.     Her character design was reused   Derp eyes   No Tan   Derp Face  How is this winning?       Goddamn it, every Aquarion is so fucking horrible, but I can't stop watching it.   Okada and the voice actors liked Zessica better and wanted her to win. And Okada actually wanted to write Kagura and Mikono to be together so Amata and Zessica would be paired up.  Kawamori said no.     Behold your new king.    Aquarion: Potato edition     Looks like the design of a losing girl tbh   The MC is so fucking ugly, I wouldn't mind if the other guy gets the new Zessica.   He's the friendzoned childhood friend, he won't win.    What a nice cat.    Alpaca.     Cute cat.     Mikono didn't do anything, not even in the last episode because Amata and Kagura didn't let her.   Can't wait to watch every episode of this piece of shit series and then rage on /a/ again.    All of it anon. ALL THAT EMOTION is just preparation for Macross Delta.     Just reading this post reminded me how butthurt I am about zessica pretty much being discarded and nobody in universe actually giving a single fuck.    inb4 she loses all over again..  eternal suffering bless they anons     I like how they're going for the zessica route for this shit now, a little too late in my opinion   http://aqlogos.com/mechanic-aquario<wbr>n/</wbr>    It wasn't because of that. It's because most off the staff were KaguraxMikono fags. Kawamori even joked about how everyone thought Mikono and Amata holding hands was kind of gross but they thought Kagura licking her was cute    Jesus christ I can't watch this.  They all look so weird.  And that motherfucking, goddamned, faggot-ass haircut. Nope. I won't do it.       Yes you will.     you can no longer protect her smile because it is gone forever  I didn't even watch this show and I'm mad she lost.     Not really digging the designs.   So those two are the main couple in this one?   In before that's not Zessica.    Zessica was always a side character, Okada just got side-tracked by Zessica suffering and so focused on that.   It was actually the female staff, they loved the whole bad boy shtick, and fangirling over him hard.      How can Aquarion be a franchise if the first series wasn't even that good? In what way is it marketable. EVOL was fun because it was campy, but it is actually forgettable. The only decent things coming from Aquarion are the soundtracks. What are they trying to achieve by extending the franchise?    Obviously.       It happens because Kawamori can afford it for his own entertainment. It's just like modern Nintendo's direction.    He's not even involved in Logos, he's too busy with Macross.    It's not even an Akino opening.      Mark my words it would be triangle. Since they are loosing words, they have lost the 3rd pilot too. The 1st half of anime would be about finding that 3rd pilot.    The one that we call Zessica is going to be Touma and MC is going to be Apollonius/Gen/Zen.     Kawamori can afford it for his own entertainment  that only apply for the plays of nobunaga the fool, aquarion continuation is more related to pachiko than kawamori     Wait, Not Mikono has 3 ponytails.   I think that something is wrong with Touma/Zessica/s design.   I can't get over those shitty designs    Something about that looks really off.      How can the character designer creat a male whith such hair and don't think it looked retarded?     BARK     If you have noticed, all characters hair have that bowl on their head.    It might be Shushu.     What if she's actually the dog this time?     She looks wrong in that one.    If you mean previous generation loser then probably.     somebody was paid real life money for these character design     She looks wong in that one.    She did this and something something 12000 YEAR A I SHI TER U.   So I was confused, The first series and evols commander, were they the same person or the same person reincarnated. Like was he immortal or nah.  Also best op https://<span>youtu.be/ltebZspkp_g  [ ] inb4 shit quality i know       He's Acala from Bhuddism, AKA The Immovable, AKA Fudō-myōō.    He is Apollonius who has never died.    If hes acala from buddism his left eye being gone/closed makes alot more sense lol.      Doesnt someone reincarnate from apollonius, if they did, how does someone reincarnate from him if hes not dead?    Only Apollo has reincarnated. Apollo is the dog of Apollonius.                        The last dog made me laugh.                      Well we all know who will get cuckold. Poor girl on the right she even looks like best girl.        Of course. Boring MC must get together with boring heroine.        Is that MC a poor man alto? It feels they are trying to copy macross frontier at this point.     Worst parents ever.     Are they playing with scissors here?    those Zessica/Mix doujins where they get drugged and body modified   this is completely and utterly my fetish                Who is best shingeki and why is it Annie?   Because she was characterized damn well.    I know this is you, anniebot. Don't lie.   Thats not Sasha  is anniebot a  girl    I only liked her when she laughed at Armin.  I want to say Mikasa is the best but she is actually really boring.     How would either wall breach had gone if the full SL had been there? Slightly less casualties maybe?       It isn't Annie, it is Jean, who was by the way confirmed the winner of the Mikasab owl in the Live action movie (just saw the thread in the archive; funny how deluded autists thought it was supposed to represent Levi somehow).  I am celebrating victory over here, whilst EM/YH autistcucks are getting cucked the fuck out.  Allah akbar. *shoots his AK47 in the air*        kill yourself    *teleports behind you* *unzips katana* *slashes your AK47 in half* *teleports away with a cheeky grin*  Nothin personnel kid          Ymirfag owns a katana  Literally nobody is surprised.     I only read the AK47 part of your post Not gonna bother with shipping shit m8     Based Jean.   Is EH the hero we need?   EH is freedom from the tyranny of YH and EM.    are you high?   It's now official that Hanji is a tranny, Isayama just said it on his blog   dubs    nice one     the neckbeard has to post the same 5 pictures he has over and over again because Japan will never make any new ones for his delusions     We knew that already. What retard still thinks he's female at this point?    Because we haven't seen anything of her in so fucking long you forget about her and then remember her and you think she's the best, but really she was okay.    Annie a shit.    you sound underage    And has not been changed for years thanks to crystalization.  The rest of her corps' characterizations are now very messy.     so whats going on now, i stopped reading when that bitch got crystalized and they were trying to get to the basement, did they ever make it?  why are the walls titans? whos the gorilla man? why isnt everyone dead when they were all dying left and right  lets make a lot of characters so we can use them as cannon fodder        you'll never marry Annie    Hange is best, everybody else is a shit.   http://blog.livedoor.jp/isayamahazi<wbr>me/archives/8867221.html  So Hanji is both male and female?  </wbr>  http://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Mt3WMO<wbr>fh2Wo</wbr>  [ ]  Dat kiss.     The fuck you say...    Annie worst girl    Sauce:  @hituzi2gou     Why do people care about the kiss?  best shingeki isnt a character but a concept. it's the concept of dropping shingeki and finding some self respect   It's inexpected I guess. And also it's probably because it's Mikasa.    Because Mikasa is only good for shipping fodder for self-inserting twats     Who is best kyojin and why is it Annie?     Blorphole Poover Poobar    It's okay, I got him covered.    Annie is love Annie is life Annie is the sun that warms my heart Annie a miracle of the universe Annie might've done some things wrong, but she's still a beautiful person inside and out           think they will finale be going there next chapter or atleast to Shiganshina District      First king had them build the walls with hardening abilities.      monkey trouble he is a shifter and the one leading the others. He is waiting at Shiganshina District for them.     reanimation jutsu             I haven't been that legitimately sad in a long time.    Annie a shit.  Can't even run away properly and just gives up on life.      Butthole a love.    Blorp oozes from the Butthole.    Serves him right for the semen demon he is.   Eren x Annie OTP    lets make a lot of characters so we can use them as cannon fodder  SnK in a nutshell, I wonder how Flegel and the reporters are still alive.     I think the series actually does a decent job making you care about the cannon fodder characters.      Who, Marco? Petra? The rest of Levi's squad? Nifa? Mike? Not really.    Same guy, I wanted to add that I only know their names because I lurk here, otherwise I might only remember Marco and that's because Jean couldn't shut up about it in the anime. In the manga he was just a random dead guy.    It makes me sad that titans are primarily supposed to be war machines and this'll never happen.    The character grew on me when I read them in manga compared to the anime.    Maybe if you watched the anime first. For someone that reads/watches it for the first time most of these characters are just random redshirts.   I wonder what will the ending be. Most likely the entire wall will be destroyed but then what?  Was pretty cool.   Hey man.  You intentionally left your trip on.     Lelouch is intentionally a faggot, news at 11.   Does anyone have the most recent chart? I was withouth internets for 2 weeks, I missed the release hype  Who is Monkey Trouble, am I supposed to be able to tell who he is? It's just a long haired glasses dude     That guy who led the squade when taking back Trost and had Mikasa and Eren's back.  Those two guys who died last at Utgard.  That black haired chick who died because Eren's an idiot.       That guy   Those two guys   That black haired chick  So you agree with me.       Hey, I never said anything about knowing their names.    I thought Levi squad will live because they are like elite of elites.    Annie is eliter.    There no memorable I just remember all their names   Damage control        Damage control  Do you even know what that means? I only added more to my rant, I didn't take anything back.     To jump off your "Marco is just a random dead guy" comment, he's really not. His portrait is featured at the start of every volum of the manga, whereas other dead characters have their's removed.   I have a feeling he's still important to the story somehow. Hopefully we'll find out when Annie gets uncrystalised.      Mmkay you don't remember every last one of them or anything I didn't even remember some of those names damn anon they really had an impact on you.     More like I lurk these threads a lot.        Historia a bestest.        You love them don't you I bet you cried when each one was killed off     N-No I didn't ;_;    Why I can't but agree with this.   Not that guy but I loved Petra, thinking she is qt and may be spared but not a single tears was shed when she died       It's one of the reasons why his characterfags think he'll come back.      I might be the only one who didn't give a shit about any of the fodder. Especially Levi Squad, they were too obvious.    Me neither. Although I wish Nanaba didn't die so soon.    Do not sexualize the queen.    No way he's coming back, but there has to be more to it than him just being a normal guy who died somehow.     I hope Levi died.   I remember Ian leaving an impression on me, he was an upstanding man and I'm sad he died.    Marco is Ymir's time travelling son from the future.  Marco will come back as a titan, Isayama said it.  Marco was just pretending to be dead, didn't you see that his left leg was moving?          I mean I didn't cry but I was like, aww, damn :/.     Ymir   Ever getting pregnant   I see through your lies.       :/  Get out.     She's the father.   So I heard Hanji was confirmed a beautiful transwomyn?   Fyi Ymir was just pretending to be a lesbian. Her true love, Bert, impregnated her and she's currently in labor. Baby Marco will be born soon and we can finally have our canon Jeanmarco.     :/  Scawwy angry face anon     Sounded more like she's a herm    It was just Isayama just fucking with us about the incognite thing.  &gt;2015   &gt;Still doesn't get Isayama's jokes       Marco is totally a BY spawn how did I not notice.      He sounded pretty serious.    Well are you up to date?    Bert actually has standards, he would impregnate Annie not some tranny-looking thing      So does Annie. He might have a chance with Pigner.    Do you think she will just be queen of orphans or will she get to try her hand at other things too?    If Annie had standard she would love Bert, not that self hating, crybaby titan with a huge role that he can't handle that is Er- wait, fuck.    I didn't say the Rageturd is any better.    That's who Annie likes though, and he's the same as Bert.  I like both anyway, she should too.     Not really.    Annie likes Armin       All this delusion.     Eren and Bert are completely different.  Bert is a pawn who's just going along with what's expected of him.  Eren is going against the world, and trying to change things. Annie respects that. I can't imagine she respects Bert.      You're a delusional retard    They are equally terrible characters though.    Ymir would rape his pathetic ass before he even touches her.    Look who is talking.    Eren is the scouting legion's pawn, which is quite obvious. He always does what he's ordered to. At first he wanted to go against the world but that's not really what happens, he's just a pet.     thinks Annie likes Armin   calls others delusional  /snk/ never ceases to amaze.      Only Reiner would want to touch Bert's second weak spot.    That's a trait that many characters have expressed respect and admiration for, it probably means nothing in terms of romanticism. Historia and Bert have said more or less the same kind of thing at some point, maybe others that I can't recall right at this moment.    Historia admired Eren as well because he knew what he wanted to do. Even if he's their tool he still keeps a sense of self even though right now he's depressed over eating Grisha.    It also means that Annie has zero respect for Bert who is the complete opposite of Eren. If there's lack of respect there's also little room for romantic feelings to develop.     Historia and Bert have said more or less the same kind of thing at some point  You mean Annie and Bert? Because Annie and Bert have pretty much the same worldview from what they said. About humans that go with the flow and being normal I mean.     Bert also knows well what he wants and has to do. Out of BRA he's the only one that never wavered from their goal even if he just wants to return home.    Bert's just a coward.     depressed  He showed symptoms of PTSD in the latest chapter.     Eren is just a whiny ragetard.    I'm thinking of the conversation between Eren and Historia during the chapter where they were in the cabin. Did she not say something about how she admires that about Eren? I could be remembering it wrong, it's been a while since I read the chapter    Maybe you should read the manga for a change.    It's much more emphasized in Annie's case, though, and she's very selective about who she associates with. I don't have anything against BA, but I don't see it realistically happening.    I thought it was more like envy.    From memory she was saying that she's jealous of the fact that he seems to know exactly what he's doing with his life.    And Bert is a whiny fag.    Sorry my bad, you're right. I still don't see Eren as someone who goes against the flow as Annie or Historia describe him. From humanity's viewpoint, Eren does that and Bert is a pawn, but from the titan's viewpoint it's the other way around. If you look at it from a third person's viewpoint, both of them are pawns for their cause.      You both are getting to my words. I like both characters but in the end they're not much different from each other. Bert has acted like a ragetard at some points and Eren has acted like a crybaby. Both claim they have no will but both do everything to help their cause.     I think it's because Eren always calls other people out on not fighting back. At least early on he was always giving speeches about how humanity needed to stand against the titans.   Also, he did put in a hell of a lot of effort to become a soldier. That's respectable in its own right.      Eren put a lot of effort to become a soldier but BRA put much more effort to become warriors. Sure they're not the same, but Eren's will to go against the flow was there only in the beginning. After Levi and Erwin took him under their control he just helps the scouting legion with everything, it just happens that he agrees with their cause.  I expect Bert and Reiner to go against MT for whatever reason, since it's starting to look like MT is doing it for selfish reasons and BR disagree, but that's just speculation on my part.      Bert will go awol to save Annie. Reiner will directly go against MT and die for it.    Bert loves Annie but he wouldn't leave Reiner to die. Reiner always gets into trouble but that doesn't mean that Bert agrees with it, that's why he's always running after him.    Either way he managed to get two girls to envy or admire him because Eren comes across as a strong-willed person. Bert doesn't really have anything admirable about him.    So Reiner and Eren are equally dumb. Although Eren's behavior was even more retarded and got his team mates killed.    Bert is more strong willed that Reiner or Annie though, he only thinks he's not.    The SL's goals coincide with Eren's and it was a dream of his to join them. Why would he deter from that anyway? He still has a strong spirit to him and if he felt the SL were doing something he disagreed with greatly he probably wouldn't stand for it.    Annie hides in a crystal and Reiner created a second personality, it's not like they're much competition.     He still has a strong spirit to him  Not as much, at least during the last arc that changed.  if he felt the SL were doing something he disagreed with greatly he probably wouldn't stand for it  Really? He disagreed with the SL's intentions about Annie but he still helped them catch her.       Is this some sort of pretending to be retarded? Reiner wouldn't have developed a second personality if he had Bert's will and Annie wouldn't have hidden if she had his will. Although I think Annie did it to protect the information, not just her life. Point still stands about Reiner.    He also knows Annie is responsible for the deaths of many soldiers and is considered an enemy to them first and foremost.    Sure, but he still disagreed and he still did it. He doesn't do what he wants he does what the SL wants.    My point is that out of a guy with a split personality and a girl who hid in a rock, of course Bort is going to look like he's strong willed. But compared to others aside from his tagalongs he's a pussy.    Because for the most part he agrees with them. Do you think he would be okay with it if for some reason the SL told him to kill Mikasa and Armin?    He looks strong willed because Reiner and Annie are cowards too.    Annie was willing to risk being eaten by Titans. That's something.   What was he meant to do, let a Titan rampage through Stohess?        Sure I guess, he's far from strong willed in general. The problem is that people describe him as weak willed even compared to RA, hell some say he's more weak willed than the whole cast when that's not true at all. He just hates himself and thinks he's more worthless and cowardly than he really is.     Bert is just a weakling who shows signs of strength sometimes. Other characters are strong that at times show signs of weakness, as most humans do anyway.    Pretty much. He's just the least cowardly of a trio of cowards      Depends. Most humans are either weak that shows signs of strength or strong that show signs of weakness. He's not more strong willed than many characters in the cast, but he's not the most weak willed of the cast, unlike what the consensus thinks.    He is weak-willed in comparison to many others though.    That's what I'm saying too, in case you can't read.   Fuck off hetshipping scum. Only YH is canon and maybe EM.   He's not the most weak willed but he's definitely in that area.    Yes anon, in case you didn't notice we agree on that for quite a while.    I know that, I'm reiterating because some think otherwise.   How do Mikasafags feel about this?  Is it true that Mikasa's actress filmed a naughty scene with Shikishima's actor?   Jesus Christ, I wonder if Isayama will comment on this if the fanbase gets too loud.    No.   Does /a/ like /fit/ girls? They need love too, you know.  I do   SHD a best. I don't like the way that artist renders his muscles.    yes i do  Not enough /fit/ girls that don't have ridiculous tits.   Stupid Boruto, I'm going to be the next Hokage    Fuck off.   so what the hell happened to this show  i didnt watch after the first series     r u austistic ? ?     We're on the kids now     no you fuck off and kill yourself while your at it    Why weren't all the Uchiha murdered?  They cause nothing but problems       Why weren't all the Uchiha murdered?   Sasuke got drunk one night and accidentally made another one     MOOT   Got your back.     Tobirama is rolling in his grave.    Stupid Boruto, I'm going to be fuck the Hokage  ftfy      it's all just a dream      so what the hell happened to this show   this happened https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=35a<wbr>dqIEBj9Y</wbr>  [ ]       lightning rasengan   No fuck you     &gt; What are the true intentions/real nature of his respected parents?  wanna bet his parent is Orochi     Orochimaru just wanted to be the little boy again     Is he the reincarnation of Kagura     We know for a fact he isn't Orochimaru     yeah sorry     But first I'm going to kill all the kages still trapped in the infinite Tsukuyomi     dude, he said he was sorry    you do realize that there a fuckton of Orochimarus on every person that has a seal on their necks right?   Naruto using wood style   Pinkshit is a pathetic wreck, she's raising Sausage's child with another woman. Sausage himself wandered in the forest for 12 years without ever once dropping by and seeing his supposed family. Naruto and Hinata had a perfect Disney happy ever after and have twice as many kids as everyone else.  One of them is called Bolt (reference to Neji meaning 'Screw') and he's a cheeky little faggot who acts out because daddy spends too much time in the Hokage office - Kishi is proejcting the fuck out of his own relationship with his children onto him. Shino became Cyclops from the X-men. Chouji married a black girl. Shikamaru made a clone of himself with Temari and is Naruto's right hand man. Akamaru is dying of old age. Konoha is now a metropolis.            She's a naruto's fangirl.      he hasn't said he's sorry for abandoning and almost killing his child.      daughterfu...   So what is Bort's dream? He doesn't seem to be interested in becoming the Hokage.   His power is limb elongation.    did naruto die yet     translation?     forgot pic    good luck trying to kill Jesus    to surpass his father most likely.     So what is Bort's dream?   revolution of the ninja proletariat      I would actually like her to be Hokage, Boruto doesn't deserve it. Plus, she's the only decent Uchiha that isn't Shihsui    fuck his lonely and thirsty mom    "As the daughter of Sasuke and Sakura, she has already awakened the Sharingan. She admires Naruto."     Sauce comes back to the village after 12 years   Bolt steals Salad's dad   Salad says she wants to be hokage   by the end of the movie after he sees how cool Dadruto is Bolt will revoke his "I don't even want to be hokage!" declaration and steal Salad's dream too       https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Sj4<wbr>obDjhuvU</wbr>  [ ]   To create a democratic system of government instead of pseudo-monarchic military dictatorship with feudal lords.    Just like her dad.    What the fuck happened to Hinata? She aged like milk.    Is it just me or does it sound like Nardos voice is even girlier now?    What are you talking about? she looks like she is on her 20's.     Gets new haircut   Exact same face   Aged like milk  ?       She looks exactly the fucking same as the last, only with short hair and some weird sweater hoodie thing      he even gets Sasuke's headband   Sarada probably just got a headpoke, and that's if she's lucky   will she kill herself at the end of the movie        It's the "housewife" haircut.    Are they really spoiling the gaiden's plot?    Because you expect his voice to be deep because he's an adutl now and you're feeling the gap between a man and a woman pretending to be a man.     Uchihas   Taking power   Ever  Konoha need another purge        Would that douche post a pic of Himawari's profile? You know, the character we actually haven't seen?      she's raising Sausage's child with another woman.   there's still a possibility it will all be an epic ruse by kishi   unless kishi is going to pull a whole "your mother is the one who raised me" thing at the end of the gaiden.  but if he does that, then he'd have to make Sarada reject Sasuke too since he's never been there for her at all.           Sasuke's headband  She got something better than a sweaty and rusty headband. She got a head pat  from Naruto.     Sausage's headband really overdoes it. Were they trying to mirror Iruka giving Naruto his or something?     No, just that Boruto is meant to be the SN lovechild.     Chapter 7: "Why should I help somebody who isn't my mom!?"  Chapter 8: "I guess I DO want to help my mom."  They've already had Sarada accept that Sakura is her "mom" either way.          Kishimoto holding Sasuke to the same moral standards as everyone else.     I hope Kishi at least has the decency to write Salad resenting Sauce while Sauce shows some semblance of regret for damaging their relationship.  But with Salad going "W-wow my papa is so sugoi!!" every other chapter now I doubt it.       Maybe they'll make her a tsundere      If that's the case, there's no reason he'd be too much of a prude when it comes to Sasuke to have him impregnate Karin and steal the babby      can't even remember his own character's name   nepotism      no spoilers yet  Does this mean the chapter is boring or that the chapter is exciting     I remember the earlier material said specifically "born to/between Sasuke and Sakura,"  did they change it?       Kurama already filled that role.     Sasuke on the one side   Karin giving birth   Sakura on the other side  See, she was born between Sasuke and Sakura.       Why does she cause such a reaction in my loins?      It's not like I want papa to train me or anything...   I hope Hokage-sama notices me   how moe will Sarada get?       How many years until we get Boruto Gaiden, with Boruto and Saradas Kids?    anon, please     When have any of the girls that Sasuke has tried to kill directly or indirectly resented him?     Uchiha   Hokage   I'm ready for salad's era       OF course Sasuke didn't just bang Karin out of the blue you SSfag. But saying that Sarada is just magically Sakura's is just as thematically retarded.  Sarada is most likely a test-tube baby. It'd explain why there's such a secret to her birth, and why Shin wants to capture her alive.       Naruto grow the most  Can anyone tell me if we read the same manga? What part of Naruto is growing the most when he just did the same things?     Dude Im super hyped for lee's kid.     fingerless arm-high gloves   Thigh-high boots   zettai ryouki   hips   short black hair   glasses  help!           But saying that Sarada is just magically Sakura's is just as thematically retarded.   I agree with you though. I want Sakura to be a cuck one way or another.   Sarada is most likely a test-tube baby.   The only problem with this I think is that it makes the assumption that Sasuke and Sakura are familiar with this technology already. Plus, who created the test tube baby? Karin? Why would Sasuke ask her to do that?   and why Shin wants to capture her alive.   I'm pretty sure he just wanted her cause she was an Uchiha.               Maybe that Evil chick hasn't read it yet?     He's made of rubber.      How did that happen?    Salad doesn't want to bone him like the other girls did    Here Burrito I want you to have this   You are you're kind of like the son I never had and always wanted.     i thought kishi said he was going to have his own attacks? in the last few days I’ve seen this nigger clone spam, shoot out chidori and now it looks like he's making a midget rasengan in his hands.

Currently, Naruto’s son Boruto is starting a main character serialisation called NARUTO – Spin-off “The 7th Hokage and the Month of the Red Flower ”, but what path will Boruto discover I wonder..?  Kishimoto – I can’t say for the sake of spoilers, but the theme of “Naruto” has always been written as “Connection”, so this time, I’ve been thinking I want to write on elements such as the concrete DNA of those who are connected, and their feelings…those who are connected are the same. In contrast to a DNA connection, what has been inherited, and how? This type of story is what I shall I try my hand at writing to explore.          </wbr>   But Sarada is the one that'll become Hokage    Genetics is everything! The bloodline must be protected!     'blah blah i couldnt make naruto and sosukeh fuck so ill make their kids fuck instead'      sarada was her gift      Why would Sasuke ask her to do that?  He didn't  Sasuke-kun, I'm pregnant with your child, please take responsibility!   Really? I don't recall having sex. Huh, looks like Orochimaru was wrong about where babies come from, I should have known. Anyway, gimme the kid and I'll ask Sakura to raise it. Then you can go back to your lab and I'll keep wandering the world.   THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT          So Karin cooks up a kid without Sasuke's consent?     That was the joke, yes     you think this is a game, negroe? There are fictional children's lives at stake.     Sounds like something she'd do in all honesty.       that kuso oyaji at 0:56  too adorable         I suspect Sasuke never actually got "the talk". He thought "restoring his clan" involved getting revenge and commiting genocide instead of impregnating as many girls as possible       I fucking love Naruto's grin.    Sasuke has never taken responsibility for anything in his entire life    This is basically my interpretation as well.    He did the same things but he actually suceeded. Everyone else did the same things and never achieved anything.      Naruto and Hinata had a perfect Disney happy ever after and have twice as many kids as everyone else.  the fuck is this, a math problem?     MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOT 's REPLACEMENT </wbr>    How can the promo team be so retarded as to give away a major plot point of the gaiden in their material 'Sasuke and Sakura's daughter'. Like, what's the fuck is wrong with these cunts, that they couldn't omit to say who is her mother until the end of the gaiden, and just say 'Sasuke's daughter', where did they learn their work? How can they be so incompetent? I would fire the lot of them, useless faggots.    me too i guess. Imagine he kicks boruto's ass. oh god its going to be awesome. but who did lee marry anyway?    Fug     Well, she is Sakura's daughter regardless of who gave birth to her, isn't she?  Isn't that the whole point? It's not like Sarada stopped calling Sakura "mama"  There's still a sliver of hope that Kishi isn't an incompetent fool         He wants to travel the world like Jiraya and Sasuke.    I'm not talking about biological shit here but Sakura is the one raising her, so saying "Sasuke and Karin's" or "Sasuke and Karin's, raised by Sakura" or any form of that would be retarded.     Yeah, there's a possibility, albeit a small one I think, that they're just going with that for promotional reasons. Kishi may not have even written it.     She looks so cute in that portrait. I want to protect that smile     From the beginning, even before this gaiden in Sarada's profile was written that she was Sakura's and Sasuke's daughter.    I didn't mention something like 'Karin and Sasuke's daughter', just not to have for the 4th or 5th time now some promo piece reiterate she's Sakura's daughter. Once again, they can just write Sasuke's daughter, she admires Naruto or some shit. Writing down she's Sakura's daughter kills all the current questioning from the gaiden. And if you think Nips think 'adoptive mother = mother' then you don't know anything about them. Blood is the only thing that matters to them, so if it's written down she's Sakura's daughter, then she's.   Stop making Naruto threads until the latest chapter is published.    so, pure     I know but that was before the gaiden. Now if they weren't incompetent faggots, they would go along with the game and not spoil shit like the useless little cunts that don't understand shit about marketing that they obviously are.    she is*    Karin isn't popular in Japan.    what nightmare? you're awake    See  and fuck off.      It'd be kinda funny if Kishi does make Sarada Karin's daughter in the Gaiden while the promotional team is still saying she's Sakura's.  Also, I think the movie probably isn't going to focus very much on this matter from the gaiden, regardless of the outcome. Heck, if Kishi really wants to troll his readers while not making complete asses of the promotional team, he could just have the gaiden end on an ambiguous note with Sarada saying it doesn't matter what the truth is.        If you adopt a kid, you'd probably refer to them as your child.   Such a disappointed face    but anon said Nips only care about blood.    What I don't get is, if Sarada is really Karin's daughter why doesn't Karin just live with Sasuke in the village?   Why all this secrecy and shit?       editing a post that isn't yours on some Chinese cartoon anonymous discussion board  Faggot, pls.     So the fat guy beside Bolt and Sarada in that blurry pic was not their sensei after all? Shame, I was looking forward to Chouji playing the cool tutor.      Why all the secrecy if Sarada is in fact Sakura's is a better question.      Mangekyou Sharingan confirmed     I'm helping fag     Himawari actually make it to the movie     what was the deal with sasuke's fancy sharingan pattern anyway or was that just what eternal mangekyou looked like? I coulda sworn his eyes were like that before itachi died on him tho    Mangekyous look special because "fuck it, you have big eyes might as well make them spehshul", eternal mangkeyou looks even moar special     Activate the eye powers!!   Which ones?    ALL OF THEM        If Boruto doesn't apologize, I swear to God.     Did Kishi already forget about Sunflower?    You know I basically like Bolt's charater idea, but fucking up his little sister's birthday party AND making his mother disappointed is not okay. He better fucking make up for those. Also there better be some Hiashi in the movie, reflecting how even though he never met him, Bolt is somewhat like his uncle.      if only they had listened when it actually mattered    Pierot seem to be really inconsistent with the eyes, hers look as lavender as Bolt's The Last version did, even though in this film his eyes are as blue as his father's.    Boruto, why ruin your sister's birthday.     Konohamaru is their sensei      but anon said Nips only care about blood.  SS fangirls only cares about blood, you mean. It is amazing how they kept insisting that Salad is worthless if she isn't proof that Sasuke and Sakura fucked.     Why couldn't we protect that smile?   Borutos sister is cute as f   Woah, he is fucking rude to his mother.      self-explanatory      They were. They purposely made it like that, because you know, Hinata and the whole Byakugan deal. If anything its actually Kishi who's NOT consistent.      The problem is the promotional material says "As the child of Sasuke and Sakura" which seems to give away the real ending of the gaiden. The question is whether the moon speak of some of the promotional material would permit an adoptive interpretation with regards to Sakura.  As I pointed out above, earlier promotional material seemed to say straight up "born to Sasuke and Sakura." pic related. The moon runes in that promo are a little bit different.        Why is cake on ground?  What the fuck? This little entitled piece of shit acts like a real spoiled brat, hope Hinata give her a slap in his face.      that face  She's definitely thinking about malasion airlines     Hopefully they are lying.     The problem is the promotional material says "As the child of Sasuke and Sakura" which seems to give away the real ending of the gaiden.  I have absolutely no problem with it at all. Sakura is Salad's mum. Those who say "They need to be blood related because Japanese people are bad and intolerant and wouldn't think adoption is acceptable" is actually now being outright racist. SS fandom is pure poison.     Do we have any confirmation on that, or is that just speculation? The closest I can figure is Bolt calling Konohamaru sensei in ch700, but then he was in the Academy and that designation goes for everyone with that role.      Do we have any confirmation of that     <br/>   In fact, the fact that the manga makes a big deal about it is exactly explaining the adoption theory. They WANT to keep it hushed up because the characters would rather not let the fact that Salad was adopted to get out.       That isn't really the problem though. The problem again is whether the promotional material has spoiled the ending by actually saying in explicit language "Sakura is her biological mom" Either they have spoiled it or they haven't.     What is in that picture frame on Naruto's desk?     Stop Konohamaru! That's dark history!!!  Every fucking time.    Will Boruto awaken Byakugan ?   Is Boruto throwing a fit because his daddy didn't show up at his birthday? Is this an american 90s family movie?    Is Photoshop CS6 enough to scanlate or do I need another program to? Or should I rather use Gimp or something?   I don't have too many issues with it, though the only thing I'm doing with gimp is create reaction images.   Photoshop is enough for anything and everything.   But can it bring Ed's mother back to life?    Illustrator is a better vector program    wow this looks pretty cool, but I don't think that anyone uses it for scanlations   Unlikely anime.    3,000 people dead   a big deal   More people die from falling down onto the floor every year.        stormfront   not buthurt about 9/11  Pick one. Also get married so your wife can ride my jambo jet.       Hahaha you sound like a fucking baby boomer.  I do hope you get hit by drone from clear skies and see how much you like your freedom with your bottom half gone.     So you're actually conceding that America did so much worse to Japan by nuking it?    They literally break apart going past 10mph hahaha what a fucking tool. You're a leech to society, grandpa. </blockquote>]
