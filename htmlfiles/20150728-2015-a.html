[ So i guess doujishi is fucked, thanks TPP<br>http://mainichi.jp/select/news/2015<wbr>0728k0000m020060000c.html</wbr></br>  Can't read nip m8 <br><br>What is this about?</br></br>  I can't read nip. Did some cocksucking, out of touch baby boomer fuck it up for everyone AGAIN?  <br> all these moonrunes <br>can't do it /a/non</br></br>  <br>Were you honestly expecting this thread to go anywhere with moonrunes in OP?</br>  <br>You can always expect murricans to fuck everything up for everybody else.</br>  <br> The Counsel for Negotiations is supposed to "negotiate". Anyone can blindly swallow demands, even a kid. I predict that they'll add "some degree of elasticity" to the treaty's text. If they can't even do that, Japan may as well be America's dog. <br>That's the basic gist.</br></br>  Fucking Kojima.  This doesn't sound good. What exactly is happening?  What has happened, OP?  How many more days do we have before TPP is in action?  <br><br>It's over. It means no more sadpanda or anime for you.</br></br>  From what I understand, this is in response to the TPP finalizing the copyright protection period as "70 years after the author's death", and non-Antragsdelikt. The latter means that anyone can report a copyright violation, it doesn't have to be a formal complaint by the author. I think. Policy terms aren't my forte.  Is this yet another situation where we all freak out and act like it's the end of the world when nothing is going to change?  <br>If TPP passes the state anime industry will be the least of our concerns</br>  <br>Yup. Any shithead can shut down doujinshi makers, torrent, scanlator etc sites. All it takes is one asshole in any of the signatory states.</br>  HOARD EVERYTHING YOU CAN QUICK  <br>This one is a lot, lot more scary than any of the last ones. You should prepare for the worst.<br><br><br> anyone can report a copyright violation, it doesn't have to be a formal complaint by the author <br>Yes, that's the scariest part of the TPP.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> may as well <br>I've got some bad news for Japan.</br></br>  I can't wait for WWIII to free us from all these stupid laws that keep getting passed.  <br>Up till now, Japan's copyright policies were "50 years after the author's death" and formal complaints filed by the author. We'll just have to hope Japan doesn't have many goody two-shoes.</br>  <br> Yes, that's the scariest part of the TPP. <br>In my opinion the scariest part is the bit where they discard democracy and hand over all power to the economy, but oh well. Maybe I'm insane.</br></br>  <br> Doesn't have to be a formal complaint by the author. <br>That's stupid. Literally any person to agree to this is stupid.</br></br>  Without hentai we'll have to fuck eachother while wearing cute girly clothes.  Is there any way I can go kick the prime minister in his taint or something to get my country to not sign TPP?  Anon, you think you can just waltz in here and drop moon in our lap after being told we can't learn nip for years?  Thats fine. More reason for me to book a flight to Gensokyo.  Feels good to be in anti-american country.  This is what happens when you let companies run governments.  <br>There wont be any good guys in WW3, anon.</br>  <br>Be sure to take as many people with you as you can.</br>  <br>The scariest part for me, NZer, is that we are trading away our amazing health care (guaranteed to lose) for a chance at maybe increase some of our agricultural exports. <br>Because our fucken milk prices are stupid enough. We are already paying more than you faggots overseas are paying for our milk. Why the fuck do you want it cheaper. what homos</br></br>  <br><br> There won't be a third world war <br>ftfy</br></br></br>  <br>So?<br>That's not the point.<br>A world war will break the economy and therefore shake up the world order and allow us to create something new.<br>Looking for good guys in a war is just asking to be lied to.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You should have done that a long time ago since it's been around forever and things kept getting leaked. We've known it was going to be bad for a while now.</br>  <br> implying the companies wouldn't be the ones controlling everything during WWIII </br>  <br> overpopulating Gensokyo <br>That really doesn't sound like a good idea.</br></br>  <br>Your health care is not all you are going to lose when you allow companies dictate laws.</br>   yfw nips start emigrating just so they can draw/own porn of their waifus <br><br>Not even sure how to feel about this. Do they even remember what the pink looks like?</br></br>  <br>To where, this shit covers the majority of the world.</br>  <br>Well I only heard kinda recently because I don't really pay attention to the world beyond my immediacy. Is there anything I can do in this late hour?</br>  <br>America will make sure that the rest joins the deal too.</br>  <br>Don't the authors or copyright holders just have to come out to say they don't give a shit about doujins to prevent them from being shut down?</br>   政府はクールジャパン戦略で、アニメやキャラクターなどの著作権ビジネス<wbr>の海外展開強化を打ち出しており、著作権保護で後押しする形だ</wbr> <br> As part of their "Cool Japan" strategy, the government wants to spread anime overseas and back them up with copyright protection <br> Cool Japan </br></br>  <br>No. They don't get asked.</br>  <br>Buy emergency rations.<br>Lots of porn, food and heavy weaponry.<br><br><br>That doesn't matter at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Getting uncensored Japanese porn, or Western stuff is pretty damn easy for them.</br>  <br>TPP doesn't allow them to do that, in fact it forces them to shut you down whether they want to or not.</br>  <br>But Japan isn't our dog<br>She's our waifu who started out as an extreme tsundere then we found out everyone around her hated her so we hooked up with her while pissing everyone else off at asian high school but we didn't care because she was and still is waifu<br>but then south korea was being bullied and needed help<br>kind of fucked up when helping viet-chan</br></br></br></br>  <br>First thing that happens in a hypothetical world war is the economy goes down in shambles because international trade is dead.<br>The only kind of world war that the companies would like is rich vs poor, and that war has already started.</br></br>  <br> government is bombarded by angry letters from mangaka and anime studios who are mad they lost the free advertisement </br>  <br>Stop making America into a generic harem MC,  lest America-kun gets copyrighted as well </br>  <br>This whole thing, TPP and all of its predecessors, have always been about companies trying to squeeze as much profit from anyone as they can.</br>  <br>Doesn't TPP abolish the japanese porn censorship? It's against free trade, uncensored porn is freely available elsewhere and thus japs can't prohibit it from being distributed in Japan.</br>  What happened to the good old days when if a company starts doing what we didn't like we could just boycott them?  <br><br>So only Putin-chan can save us now?</br></br>  is there a reason why they do the whole anyone can bitch about copy-right even if the author doesnt give 2 shits about  <br>Well as America can be pretty stupid, we should do what stupid harem protags do and go with their gut instinct<br>Having a lot of guns solved a lot of our problems in the past, so maybe if we give nippon guns we can still get the chinese cartoons</br></br>  <br>I live in Aus, so I can do at least one of those things and not be disappointed/arrested.</br>  <br>Either him or that faggot China.</br>  <br> anyone can report a copyright violation, it doesn't have to be a formal complaint by the author <br>I'm going to abuse this shit at every opportunity. Ohhhh man.</br></br>  <br>The TPP is going to fuck China.<br><br>Anyone who does not support it wants Chinese dick.</br></br></br>  <br>This isn't a company, it's the entire first world.</br>  <br>USA is the mastermind of this shit and it's against the law in USA to boycott Israeli products. Boycotts are against free market goy.</br>  <br>Putin will never make anime real<br>He banned dank memes, loli putin will be kill</br></br>  <br>Putin can't even pay his military. The only thing that Putin is going to be doing is, watch China take away the majority of Russian land</br>  <br>Yeah sure, I'm okay with fucking chinks if it means I don't have a bumbling retard in charge of an Orwellian regime in my country. Plus I like chinese food.</br>  <br>No it's a group of companies who got together with more companies who then decided that they would make more money this way.</br>  <br>Introduce a police-state-like environment where by keeping everyone in fear of each other you are able to freely control their will.<br>I'm reminded of the Contraband round of Liar Game for some reason.</br></br>  <br> we found out everyone around her hated her <br>Everyone likes her now except China and Korea, though.<br><br><br> implying Natalia won't convince him otherwise </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Download the stuff you enjoy. And hey, look at it this way, at least now your backlog is your very large collection of emergency rations. Just make sure to download it.</br>  <br>Bring it on, we'll just go back to xdcc.</br>  <br>On it. This is not going to fun when I run out.</br>  <br><br>Try boycotting the companies that are behind 99% of the items in the store.<br>The most realistic way to achieve that would be to become a farmer and eat your own produce, make clothes from your own produce, and never use the internet again.</br></br></br>  <br>It's going to fuck everyone. That's like saying a giant meteor headed towards Earth is going to fuck China and we should support it.</br>  <br>Under Chinks and co you will live in an Orwellian regime.<br><br>We need the TPP to divert the world economy away from China, isolate them and watch them crash and burn just like the Soviet Union.</br></br></br>  There are a lot of original doujinshi that get made, you know. All this will do is bring comiket to its knees because most people relied on fanworks. The people that made originals will survive..  <br>That's because of the sexual healing though<br>America gave Japan the reconstruction D and cured her shitty tsundere personality<br>But then Israel-chan with her shitty futa loli with balls started fucking America in the ass with her giant cock and corrupted America, now Japan needs to save America</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, Obongo.</br>  <br>I wish. Natalia-chan banzai!</br>  <br> We need the TPP </br>  <br> So i guess doujishi is fucked <br><br>Not really, the fun of this ecosystem is that you can't mess with it without fucking it for good.<br><br>So yeah, it's approved but no one will do shit because if they do they'll lose huge profits.</br></br></br></br></br>  Why does everything have to go to shit during my generation, couldn't those faggots wait till I was dead to do this shit.  <br> Aunt Jemima is behind the me-unable-to-fap-to-Chinese-porn plot <br>I KNEW THAT BITCH WAS UP TO NO GOOD</br></br>  <br>Baby Boomers are gonna give one last good wrinkly fuck before retirement</br>  Fucking hell. When exactly will the TPP get implemented? Maybe it won't take effect until 2017 and Sanders can pull it down after getting elected.  <br>Why couldn't they have died out instead? Why are baby boom mummies in politics?</br>  <br>Will gen x fix shit?</br>  Thanks for shitting up the rest of the world, America.<br><br>From: the rest of the world.</br></br>  <br>Aunt Jemima belongs to the Quaker Oats Company.<br>The Quaker Oats Company belongs to PepsiCo.<br>There are almost no small independent brands left.</br></br></br>  <br> wait till I was dead to do this shit <br>You know, you have an option and it's slapping it's fat cock right on your face.</br></br>  <br>I bet she was in cahoots with Little Debbie too, they're both fucking sluts.</br>  <br> Thanks Obama <br>Although to be fair, Romney probably would have done the same<br>Shillary too.</br></br></br>  <br>Rand Paul will make anime real<br>Anime was actually a way to improve our world and evolve humanity to the 2d realm<br>Humans have hidden potential to change the world around them through sheer willpower<br>Just as the Israelites collapsed the walls of Jericho with their own minds, so shall we create a new world through the mass desire for doujinshi from people around the world</br></br></br></br>   me and my friend have years worth of anime and porn stockpiled on 3 seperate hard drives <br>I'm ready to weather the storm fellas</br>  <br> I predict that they'll add "some degree of elasticity" to the treaty's text. <br><br>Why is everybody panicking again?</br></br></br>  <br>Doujins should be banned</br>  <br> I predict that they'll add "some degree of elasticity" to the treaty's text. <br>Isn't the whole point of these multinational treaties that individual countries don't get to futz with the fine print to their liking, everyone follows the same set of rules to the letter?</br></br>  <br>Remains to be seen<br>Only you can be in charge of the last of the truffula seeds</br></br>  <br>Not quite, Vietnam, Phillippines and others want it if it means a world without China.</br>  <br>Poorbait/10<br>Try harder next time.</br></br>  <br>TPP allows my goverment to block access to any sites they deem 'for the main purpose of sharing illegal goods/documents' iirc. Unfortunately my government is a pile of retards who'll ban way too many sites under this.</br>  <br> 4chan accepts copyright removal requests <br> all images of Harold will be removed <br>Now I'm sad.</br></br></br>  <br> Humans have hidden potential to change the world around them through sheer willpower <br>Watched too many shounen shit there, fella</br></br>  <br><br>I'm sure there are other ways to fuck over China, without fucking over everyone else more<br><br>TPP is the worst idea to implement</br></br></br></br>  From Wikipedia:<br> Historically, the TPP is an expansion of the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement (TPSEP or P4) which was signed by Brunei, Chile, Singapore, and New Zealand in 2006. Beginning in 2008, additional countries joined for a broader agreement: Australia, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, the United States, and Vietnam, bringing the total number of participating countries to twelve. <br> Other countries and regions interested in TPP membership include Taiwan,[21] the Philippines,[22] Laos,[23] Colombia,[24] Thailand,[25] and Indonesia.[26] According to law professor Edmund Sim, many of these potential countries would have to change their protectionist trade policies in order to join the TPP.[27] Other potential future members include Cambodia,[28] Bangladesh[29] and India.[30] <br><br>So I'm assuming that in order for people to do the whole "hey, I'm gonna snitch on all your shit even if you don't care" deal, they'll have to be under the TPP's jurisdiction to do so. That seems to be one light of hope. What's funny is Europe may well be our saving grace.<br><br>Unfortunately, though, there are other things to worry about.<br> https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015<wbr>/02/go-prison-sharing-files-thats-w<wbr>hat-hollywood-wants-secret-tpp-deal<wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr> <br> The TPP will encourage ISPs to monitor and police their users, likely leading to more censorship measures such as the blockage and filtering of content online in the name of copyright enforcement </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Fuck politics. It just makes me even more depressed. If shit goes down completely I'd just become an hero, but it's no use worrying about this shit until then.  <br>More so wrecked too many eldar fags with the ork boyz in 40k</br>  How much longer until the third impact?  <br>You do realize that ANYONE can report it now, right?<br>The companies don't have to lift a finger.<br>All it takes is one troll.</br></br></br>  <br> So I'm assuming that in order for people to do the whole "hey, I'm gonna snitch on all your shit even if you don't care" deal, they'll have to be under the TPP's jurisdiction to do so <br>There is a similar treaty currently being discussed with Europe.<br>Germany has that kind of legislation already anyway, and Merkel is on her way to conquer Europe.</br></br></br>   yfw torrenting becomes regular trips to the shady part of town to buy/trade for external HDDs and USBs from SadPanda rippers.   <br>Except getting China to sign TPP eventually is also a part of the plan.</br>  <br><br>Am I to understand that with TPP well underway, Aunt Jemima x Little Debbie doujins could vanish from the Internet?<br><br>What the fuck?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It seems we're regressing to the analog age of piracy.</br>  <br>Fuck</br>  <br>Then you shall become even more depressed because as it all spirals down you will know you did nothing!<br>You are man who cowers under table as faceless fat men fuck your waifu<br>Well not me I will not let the bill destroy my waifu and shall die with her in my arms<br>So you stay and cry i go and fight with phone and law book in hands and rifle on back</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or it'll just become invite only insiders club where they get encryption keys for the encrypted shit on torrent sites.</br>  Fuck it, we'll all go Fahrenheit 451 now, except with doujins.  <br> implying sadpanda will even be a thing <br> implying any form of free porn will be a thing <br>We Shimoneta now.</br></br></br>  <br><br>after averting it for decades, we're finally going to enter into the age of cyberpunk</br></br>  <br>What can one anon do against an entire generation of raging, circlejerking fuckfaces?</br>   /pol/ in full panic mode again   <br>I can't wait.</br>   local companies can get sued by american companies for denying them of profit by being less jewish <br>Why the fuck is anybody agreeing to this shit?</br>  When will people learn that piracy is nothing but free advertisement and that people pirating most likely wouldn't have bought the product anyway?  Fuck this, what's the chances of TTP passing? I am scared as fuck right now.  <br>I don't even live in any TPP or TTIP countries so it's not like I can do shit about it. I immerse myself in 2D for escapism because I don't want to deal with this shitty world. Hopefully I'll die sooner than it all goes to shit completely.</br>  <br>High.</br>  I'm european.<br><br>IS EUROPE SAVE THOUGH?</br></br>  So your telling me that 3 people can just nuke the internet in this passes? What the fuck man.  <br> I am scared as fuck right now. <br><br>Don't be. It is likely they will add some loophole to save doujin.</br></br></br>  <br>TPP's already passed in America, now they're trying to shill it to the rest of the signing countries. Japan has disagreements over the rice paddies.</br>  <br>This is not about piracy.<br>This is not even about doujinshi.<br><br>This is a hostile take-over of the US government except that same government is handing over all power willingly and without complaint.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You fight<br>Just as Ungok fought against the pack of dire wolves<br>Just as the British fought for the Magna Carta<br>Just as the colonists fought for new lands<br>Just as the Americans Fought for their independence<br>Just as you whose ancestors fought against foes greater than you could imagine and succeeded, so will you</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Europe has the exact same thing. TPP is further along though. Also, Germany is just another vassal state and it's easily the most important one in Europe.  <br>Chinese aren't warriors. Even without nukes Russia would force them back into their polluted shithole with ease.</br>  <br>Sue the American government, claim that TPP will get in the way of your profits, it might help stop it</br>  <br> TPP already passed in america <br><br>Damn americans I really feel sorry for you. How come...that happened? Freedom my ass.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;local companies <br>Try local fucking GOVERNMENTS can be sued by american companies for making regulations that deny shekels for american companies.</br></br>  <br>The fight is on but probably won't be won.

I can't speak for other people, but I'm here because I'm in too deep now. This is why anyone who feels the same is hype about the YH manga, since it executes things a lot better, like allowing the characters to be actual characters.<br><br>On the matter of Ichika being dense, he wasn't, not at first. As of the first novel or three, Ichika actually had a surprising intellect and a sharp wit, as well as an actual character. He was also pretty levelheaded, especially regarding women. At some point in the novels, the author got lazy and reduced him (and everyone else) to their base harem archetypes and left them there. The anime was pretty much like that from the outset. The YH manga, incidentally, retains a degree of this characterization.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Literally just google 'Infinite Stratos Yuuki Homura'. He's the one that wrote the reboot, which you should really be reading if you haven't already.<br><br>It's, uh...pretty good.</br></br></br></br>      Found scans  <br>I want my face in that ass.</br>    <br><br>Damn, Charlotte had the best fantasy.</br></br>        <br>Are we sure that's Ichika...?</br>      <br> Laura is bottomless. <br><br>Holy shit dude.</br></br></br>    <br>Who the fuck is she?

I think more is going on</br>  <br>couldn't 8-bit technically make a 3rd season or OVA just with the content that they cut out of Season 2?</br>  <br>They actually could.</br>  So, how accurate is this?

No large real development.</br>  <br> SHOW MUST GO ON in corner <br>More like the charade if you can even call this series that at this point.</br></br>  <br>It's Charlotte, you can tell by the ribbon in the hair.</br>  <br>Actually I think it's the new girl. Pretty sure Charlotte's ribbon is tied lower but it doesn't help the new girl also has to have a ribbon in the near exact same spot either.<br><br>That being said thank you based Choco for reinforcing busty, beautiful blondes.</br></br></br>  <br>New girl has different bangs. It's Charlotte.</br>  <br><br>So I don't suppose anyone knows why there's a hand by the door...</br></br>  <br><br>I'm tempted to say that it's Charlotte due to the lack of her IS in necklace form.<br><br>Otherwise, the fact that I can't tell the difference is indicative how similar it is.<br><br>Yumizuru must be running out of character ideas. Which shouldn't a problem if he just STOPS FUCKING ADDING NEW GIRLS IN.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I think it's the new girl, notice how her ribbon is shaded, while Charlotte's normally isn't.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Neither. She just flexes her vagina muscles and the hair disintegrates.</br></br>  <br><br>Seems legit enough.</br></br>  <br><br>Go right ahead, I'll be two rooms down the hall with Maya.</br></br>  <br>I don't especially disagree with what you say, the series is pretty much going nowhere since he changed of editor but whay exatly you don't like in the linked image?</br>  I'm starting to like Cecilia. Help.  <br>Probably the QUALITY</br>  <br>No one can help you stop having patrician taste.</br>  <br><br> dream world where her greatest desires are made real <br><br> Ichika absolutely dominates her and then tries to rape her <br><br>Why is Houki so lewd?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Alas, the only worthwhile parts of season two salvaged. <br><br>Shame it got butchered the way it did.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> asshole-sounding like dialogue from Ichika <br><br>So they're basically fucking the clone...or their idealized version of him... not sure how to call it.</br></br></br>  <br>So it's NTR then.<br><br>Welp. Pack it up. Nothing to see here.</br></br></br>  <br>It's obvious that you didn't read the source material.</br>  <br><br>Are you seriously trying to claim that Houki is not a slut?</br></br>  <br>Considering the author is going out of his way to emphasize how pure Houki is, it is safe to say that she is not a slut.</br>  <br>Yes, Honne is the only one who eats and enjoys Cecilia's cooking. Though in volume 9 Cecilia starts to show improvement on cooking but only easy things that can be followed by directions.</br>  <br>New girl has dark hair and that would be shown in shading. This girl clearly has blonde or lighter hair and her hair isn't tied into a braid like Forte. <br>She's sleeping so she could have removed her IS necklace to sleep and the hair style is the same. <br><br>Maybe she finally decided to pull a Laura and go sleep in Ichika's room which looks like it's next to the girls'. <br><br>Also, for how popular Charlotte is, she hasn't done a lot for the last two volumes since the anime ended so maybe this is a way to fix that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "So, you'd like that, wouldn't you? Well, fuck you! You aren't getting it." <br>This is a good way of putting it, though sometimes it feels to me a bit more like:<br> "Hey check this out, I actually can put effort into my writing. Hah hah! Too bad for you that I'm not gong to bother though" </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I guess, now that I look at it, Forte has a bigger bust.</br>  <br>Can you imagine how terrible it would look if it was based off of Choco's art?<br><br>Though what it really needs isn't just a reboot, it needs a reboot where the author puts in some effort like he did initially rather than phone it in. Either that or for him to just give up the rights to someone gives more of a shit.</br></br></br>  <br> Also, for how popular Charlotte is, she hasn't done a lot for the last two volumes <br>Has anyone though? (besides Houki, obviously)</br></br>  <br>I'm hoping it'd be Homerun if it ever came to that.<br><br>I remember in one of the author's notes, Izuru said Homura did some things better than he did.</br></br></br>  <br>Sword had some moments.</br>  <br>They could do what Homura is doing and adapt some of the Choco changes while keeping the designs Okiura.</br>  <br>Oh yeah, I guess there was her inexplicable hospital bedroom scene from V8, plus the followup in 9 where Ichika delivers some outright falsehoods about how great she is.</br>  <br> I'm hoping it'd be Homerun if it ever came to that <br>We all are, anon. We all are.</br></br>  <br> I remember in one of the author's notes, Izuru said Homura did some things better than he did. <br>As I recall, he also said he'd have to step up his game in response. I guess we'll have to wait and see if he did (all signs point to no).</br></br>  <br>It's a shame really, she had a lot of great story potential. She's still reallyyyyyy popular though.</br>  <br> New guy blonde girl wanted to sleep with Ichika, and knocked out Laura and threw her in the hallway so she could do so <br><br>There's a scary decent chance this is what happened.</br></br></br>  Oh yeah, so I heard you guys want to waste more money on this series.  <br>It got painted.</br>  <br>I agree. Watching S1 I was struck by how good her and Ichika's chemistry was, at least in comparison to the others, and she got a big chunk of the season devoted to her. Plus, the nature of her initial relationship with him was interesting, and they had a few things in common that explored them both a little. Her being knocked back in line to be a largely interchangeable haremette was a shame.<br><br>Hell, even S2 (terrible as it was) couldn't quite move away from her character stuff. Her bit working alongside him was a neat moment, as was the brief thing with her childhood. (listen to her drama CD if you haven't already, it's a goldmine for that stuff).<br><br>...y'know, thinking about it, her character kind of revolves around him. But then they all do. And it strikes me that this doesn't have to be a bad thing. They're all (to varying degrees) damaged people looking for something to latch on to.<br><br>That's a really interesting and clever hook for a harem type series, and could've led to something spectacular if Yumizuru had bothered his arse rather than play it safe. I mean, I guess I can't blame him, but fuck; what a disappointment.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That's a really interesting and clever hook for a harem type series <br>Nigga wat. That's bread and butter for harem series. Messed up girls latching onto average everydudes because "you were nice to me".</br></br>  <br><br>These were announced at WonFes right</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but I mean deliberately, rather than that being unintentional subtext caused by shitty writing. Like making a point that the only reason these people are behaving this way is because they're messed up and need professional help.<br><br>A harem series that ended with nobody ending up with the protagonist because they all realised they were only chasing him to distract themselves from their real problems (and a lead who wants no part in a romantic relationship) would have been something I've never seen before.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, along with Azone Rin</br>  <br>I hope the other Dolfies get restocked</br>  <br>What happened to you, Hayate? You use to be really into this series and even defended it at times but all your posts this thread have just been negative and cynical.</br>  <br>It's just haremshit dude, don't blow an artery trying to analyze it.</br>  <br>Infinite Stratos just got to him, I suppose. Perhaps it's the inevitable end result for us all.</br>  <br>That's just it though; as a rule I don't analyse things, I prefer to take a work at face value and I have no patience for 'deeper meaning' or any of that bullshit. Then I watch/read IS and it keeps hinting that it could have a bit more depth and not delivering. I put my thoughts in order about this stuff back when all I'd done was watch S1, and everything I've seen since then only seemed to confirm those thoughts.<br><br>Also, I know it sounds crazy, but harem doesn't have to be bad. There's plenty of room for entertaining story or engaging characterization, it's just that most works don't aspire to be anything more than cheap T&amp;A. Which is fine too, just not in such quantity.</br></br></br>  Holy shit. My thread from last night I thought was going to slip into oblivion has survived. <br><br>I'm impressed guys.</br></br>  <br>IS threads sometimes cling to life, like an elderly relative that just won't croak.<br><br>This time it was because of the scans though.</br></br></br>  <br>That's only because of the volume 10 scans.</br>  <br>It's a very love-HATE relationship.<br><br>I love it because it gave me pic related.<br><br>I hate it because Yumizuru has proven time and time again he is a twat in every sense of the word with the delays and whining on Twitter. He has released a whopping 3 volumes since S1 first aired 4 years ago. 3.<br><br> Ishibumi has released 10 volumes of High School DXD. <br> Kamaxhi.exe has released 10+ volumes of New Testament <br> Hell even Kawahara has released a bunch of stuff for SAO and Accel World <br><br>See the pattern here?<br><br>The dude captured lightening in a bottle once and has done absolute jack fucking shit with it. The first few volumes were a bit of a mish-mash because he was still world-building, but even now there's still very little indication that the world of IS is in anything resembling a "female-dominated" society.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's a very love-HATE relationship. <br>For me it's kind of like an abusive relationship. I started with it because I was convinced there was good in it, and I don't leave because I'm convinced I can still see it every now and then. But mostly, it just batters me with a lamp.<br><br>Yumizuru may be a twat, but Homura clearly cares about the material and he's been the one putting out the most content recently. The sound stages were good too, as was the 4koma.<br><br>Basically, every IS work produced by someone other than the original creator is actually pretty good.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And that is one thing sad about IS. There is so much potential there and it is all left to the wayside. No mention of the political upheaval, the change in society from technology, or how fucked the world because the IS can only be used by women. But hey we got some great waifus.</br></br>  <br>Don't forget potential character drama ignored in favour of reducing those characters to harem archetypes. What I wouldn't give to have snarky Ichika back.</br>  <br>I'm holding out because 9 and 10 haven't been translated and all we have go by is images and they don't tell a complete story. <br>I wish Teh Ping didn't give up so easily or at least looked for help before calling it quits. But he's strange and I think IS just isn't for him. <br><br>I do however wish IS to end, I feel for a harem it has gone on long enough. You can only do so much with a harem which I feel is why he introduces new characters every other chapter to fill in roles to keep it going. But 10 is a good spot to start winding down and ending the series. If he hates it as much as people believe he does, he would try to end it but I feel publishers give him enough money to keep going. It's hard to turn down a ton of money.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just want it to quietly die rather than live like an Alzheimers patient, huh? Well, I can't blame you. <br><br>I think there's still time to decide to have an actual story (be it plot or character driven), but he's certainly left it a while to really start with that.<br><br>What it comes down to is that judging by his early work on the series) he could certainly have written such a story from the get go. But he lost his passion for it and was reduced to shitting out whatever drivel he could be bothered to to keep the money coming in. <br><br>About the best you can hope from him is that seeing the quality of Homura's work lit a fire under his ass and drove him to do better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   They switched to CHOCO <br><br>I want to see IS as illustrated by  Raita </br></br>  I guess its too much to have an ending where the government encourages Ichika to breed all of them, even his sisters, in the hope he can pass on whatever allows him to pilot an IS to more male children.    Hayate, you still here?  <br>I had no idea the manga was a reboot. I'll check it out, but why'd they decide on a reboot?</br>  <br>Publisher switch.</br>  <br>Because the art for the original manga was trash.</br>  <br>Fuck no, I just imagined it and it's fucking ugly.</br>  <br>Oh when you said reboot, I thought literally the world was rebooted</br>  <br>I'm always here.</br>  <br>I just want to ask, why is Cecilia such a slut?</br>  <br>I got to say, I admire your dedication doing that as long as you have.</br>  <br><br>Wasn't she supposed to be some kind of badass in season two?<br><br>What happened?</br></br></br></br>  <br>She became a slut.</br>  <br>S2 happened.</br>  <br>I say that one of the reasons Homerun Ichika is so good is that he's very much alike the early LN Ichika. If the anime &amp; entire LN had Ichika be the same as his early LN self, it'd be plenty better.</br>  <br><br>serves you right for listening to noveltroll</br></br>  <br>She was shown to have no morals when she poisoned/blew-up her betters.</br>  <br>It wasn't a troll, she was suppose to fight Madoka while she was in Silent Zephyr because it's Blue Tears' sister unit. She gets her ass beat and then she trains and learns to bend her laser beams and fights her again.</br>  <br>Kanzashi happened.<br><br>They rushed a bunch of shit so they could introduce her, including most instances of anything that could be considered character development for most of the girls (save Houki of course). S1 was 3 volumes of content. The first half of S2 was 4-6 with a bunch of stuff skipped (Ran, Ichika being part of student council, you name it) so they could get Kanzashi in and make money off of her being the nerdy anime-liking girl.<br><br>So shit like Cecilia training to bend beams was skipped, and instead of winning albeit a Pyrrhic one against Madoka like she did in the novel, she had to job in the anime so not only could Kanzashi diffuse the bomb, but so Ichika + Houki could stop the big bad and end the season.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not take spoilers. It's true. She has a fire everything at once move that's like a 1 shot kill that damages herself also and can bend lasers.</br>  <br>Kanzashi a best girl, though.</br>  <br><br>They cut it to make room for the episode about Char's pantsu</br></br>  <br>That episode made it AOTS.</br>  <br>But I liked the Valkyria Chronicles art.</br>  <br>Why is Houki so violent?<br>Why is Tabane so crazy?<br>Why is Rin so flat?<br>Why is Tatenashi so Mary Sue?<br><br>The world may never know.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I almost purged that episode from my mind, why you do this to me.</br>  Devil's Advocate time<br><br>Praise something about season two no matter how much you hated it overall<br><br>I for one thank it for giving us a new round of doujins</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sauce?</br>  <br><br>it gave us foxgirl shrine priestess Houki<br><br>Which I think we can all agree is best Houki<br><br><br><br>Because I refuse to suffer alone</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wonder if there will be a another season of this.  probably not    <br><br>I'd rather a reboot at this point with a different studio</br></br>  <br>Stonking great tits.</br>  <br><br>These two</br></br>  IS is interesting as messy rom-com stuffs that are mostly equivalent to side-stories or short-stories are much more focused compared to any other drama or actual story development, unlike any other armor-featured series <br>It works for me but  I welcome anyone who can convince me that this is not the actual selling point </br>  <br> Chifuyu-nee will never ride you fast and hard <br><br>Why live</br></br></br>  Ichika's a good guy, better than I remember. I don`t remember this from the anime though, it`s been 4 years, afterall.  <br><br>He did protect Houki from the bullies in the first season. So he's pretty nice despite being dense.</br></br>  <br>Original content from Yuuki Homura. Just like how Akahoshi Kenji show Cecilia's past.</br>  <br><br> not accidentally grabbing his raging boner <br><br>Missed opportunity</br></br></br></br>   Such a lovely child cannot be a girl <br>Best doujin.</br>  <br><br>I'm for any doujin where Ichika gives it to Char i9n the butt while still thinking she's a guy</br></br>  <br>Homura is a Houkifag though.</br>  <br><br>So?<br><br>The creator is too<br><br>Just be glad the show runners were all Char-fags</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone should be a Charfag</br>  <br> Just be glad the show runners were all Char-fags <br>Why did they make such a disservice to her in S2 then?</br></br>  <br>It's not as bad as you make it sound. He gives various girls nice things and he did a nice cute tanline Rin doujin (non-H)<br><br><br>You mean both her and Fake Russia fans.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>This scene.</br>  <br>Chiwa Saito as Tatenashi.<br><br>And to a lesser extent the birthday episode was nice for what it was.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather have the birthday from the novel</br>  <br>What's the difference?</br>  <br>Not as flashy, just a party and Ichika spent time talking or doing something to each girl.</br>  <br>Didn't it make like 20k? Even with the changes?</br>  <br>maybe but how would they continue it on a remotely decent note with all the cutting done? that and I think IS has fallen out of favor even with japan. S2 more or less highlighted the flaws of vols 4-8 than their strengths.</br>  <br><br> best girl not even shown <br><br>Do you even Blade Dance?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You sure? He's always been the nee-san type considering how many h-manga involving incest he's drawn. I think he likes Chifuyu more.</br>  <br>From the looks of it, I don't think the nips really cared for that aspect. Not many series reach the 20k threshold, especially with all the changes that season 2 brought.</br>  <br>Oh and accurate numbers.<br><br> 23,566 *1 IS: Infinite Stratos 2 [BD+DVD]: 2013/10/30 </br></br></br>  <br>Not denying he has favorites, but he doesn't let it get in the way of the writing both the manga and his other IS doujin stuff (non-H). Otherwise he wouldn't have bothered with that Tanned Rin short doujin.<br><br><br>Twilight sold alot, does that make it a good story? NOPE.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The nips are weird, you've all come to the conclusion they buy this just for their favorite girls right? Though that can apply to other series.</br>   new Blade Dance novel <br> new IS novel <br>Is this real life?<br>New Haruhi novel soon?</br></br></br>  <br>Ah fuck yea this was a terrific picture</br>  <br>there's limits to that, especially with how S2 was basically the Fake russia season. Then again there's a reason why the phrase "japan has shit taste" is largely said.<br><br><br>It still hasn't come out yet? perhaps it's just as well as that has definitely fallen out of favor.</br></br></br></br>  <br> there's limits to that, especially with how S2 was basically the Fake russia season. Then again there's a reason why the phrase "japan has shit taste" is largely said. <br>But Sword-chan is fucking great.</br></br>  <br>As a girl herself, she isn't exactly terrible, the real issue is all the sueness surrounding her.<br><br>I also realized part of why S2 might have sold: they might not have known better, that sort of thing happens with adaptions: the original content gets obscured. That and/or hope that it went in a better direction than the novels.</br></br></br>  <br>Char is the most popular, everyone loves her, just focus on her and it prints money.<br>But no, they fucked it up and ruined Char just to spite us and gave us a lackluster spin off manga to rub it in.</br></br>  <br>Well, it did take 9 years for Crest of the Stars to get a new volume.</br>  <br>Waaaaaaaaaaaaah<br>Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah</br></br>  <br> gave us a lackluster spin off manga <br>Hitsuji Takako is a Charfag himself, seeing that he was doing Charl doujins before he was tasked to do Sugar &amp; Honey.<br><br>You said it yourself<br> Char is the most popular, everyone loves her, just focus on her and it prints money <br>to play it safe and not kill the golden goose, put out a Charl spin-off done by a Charl-fag.<br><br>I guess that's how low the people behind IS thinks about its fans. After all, they did put out a VN where the best end is just a reset end. A fucking cop-out compared to Toradora or OreImo where the MC can hook up with someone else other than the titular character in the epilogue.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if the new game will fix that or if they're just adding new mechanics like the massaging and Tatenashi and Kanzashi routes.</br>  REMOVE BROOM  <br>Damn, Char sure has a serious case of back rash.</br>  <br>I wouldn't get your hopes too high.</br>  <br>Tatenashi and Kanzashi already have routes in the first game. It's just that there's a hierarchy/priority system in place that you will go to the route of the girl with a higher placement if you maxed out the affection of two or more girls.</br>  This is Kanzashi.  <br>Broom a cute! (when she isn't trying to smash your head in)</br>  <br> when she isn't trying to smash your head in <br>But that's everybody aside from Kanzashi.</br></br>  <br>that varies depending on what material; LNs? I can believe that.</br>  <br>Everyone was tons more violent in the anime though.<br>Violence level goes anime &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; LN &gt; Yuuki Homura manga &gt; 4koma &gt; Charlotte manga</br></br>  <br>Tatenashi hasn't done that either, or at least not directly.</br>  <br> what is the ending of Electronic Brain World </br>  <br>I don't think the 4koma incarnations were more violent than Sugar &amp; Honey.<br><br>Unlike in Sugar &amp; Honey (where one of the girls seem to placed as Charlotte's rival), the 4koma has them getting along quite well.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Uh... remind me what happened again.</br></br>  <br>“…You woke up?”<br><br>Eh, huh? Somebody’s on the bed next to me.<br><br>“…”<br><br>I opened the curtain without hesitation, and saw Tatenashi-san, putting on her shirt without wearing a bra.<br><br>Boing, the busts are still as nicely curved as before—<br><br>“WAAAAHHH!? I’M SORRY! I’M SORRY!”<br><br>I hurriedly pull the curtain back, but it’s too late. The lance of the IS ‘Mysterious Lady’ immediately stabs over.<br><br>“I, chi, ka, kun~? This onee-san won’t allow for anything like this, you know…”<br><br>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry! Tell me to do whatever you want me to do, so please forgive me!”<br><br>The lance immediately stops.<br><br>“You’ll do anything?”<br><br>…Geh, I’m dead.<br><br>“Y-yes, anything that can actually happen in reality…”<br><br>I affirm tentatively. At this point, the tip of the lance is already pointed 1cm away from my neck.<br><br>“Th-then—”<br><br>I hear the sound of a gulp…eh?<br><br>“P-please…do perverted things to me too…”<br><br>…<br><br>……<br><br>………<br><br>“Eh…?”<br><br>“I-I heard it from Kanzashi-chan! You did all sorts of lewd things in the computer world at your own whims, right? I don’t allow it! The student council doesn’t allow it! The student council president doesn’t allow it!”<br><br>“N-no, erm, that’s the trap set by the hacker.”<br><br>“Yo-you still want to argue? You’re trying to argue back? Are you trying to argue back?”<br><br>Wh-why is Tatenashi-san being so angry? Speaking of which, I think there’s a huge misunderstanding created here…<br><br>“Erm, Tatenashi-san, please calm down…”<br><br>Or else my neck’s going to be stabbed through by the lance.<br><br>“How do you expect me to calm down!?”<br><br>It hurts! The lance reaches over and pokes at my skin.<br><br>“Uwah! An-anyway, please keep the lance!”<br><br>“Ah, sorry…”<br><br>Her voice soon calms down, and her lance disappears into light particles.<br><br>“…”<br><br>“…”<br><br>What follows is silence on both sides.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cancerous newfags liking a harem mecha.<br>*sigh* this is why anime is a joke to most.</br></br>  I only watched season 1 of the anime.<br><br>Does his sister also fall in love with him? This is all I really care about. I want the delicious incest.</br></br>  <br> harem mecha <br>This is not a Xenoglossia, Kiss Players, nor Gundam 00 thread. And I'm using the "harem mecha" quite loosely.</br></br>  <br>Ah... well damn.</br>  <br> replying to bait </br>  <br>His sister is an insane psycho that tries to kill him three times over.</br>  <br>That's pretty hot, yandere and incest all in one. I guess I will have to watch season 2 after all.</br>  <br>And then there's the crazy little sister that looks like the regular, albeit smaller version of Chifuyu that tries to kill him as well...</br>  <br> His sister is an insane psycho that tries to kill him three times over. <br>When did this ever happen.</br></br>      <br>I think he's talking about Meduka.</br>  Guts will get off the boat before the IS plot goes anywhere meaningful  Ahahahaha this show<br> Rui almost kill <br> Hajime slowly going crazy <br> VAPE leader seems still has something up his sleeve <br> Alien KanaHana/Sugita 'uniting' people <br> Tsubasa being stupid <br> 2:6:2 <br><br>I don't remember season 1 being this fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The first three episodes kind of sucked, but this is getting interesting now.<br>Gel-chan is going to turn into a crazy leader trying to "unite" people and the Gatchaman will be split in half because they have different ideals.</br>  <br>Yeah, the start was a bit slow, but it actually builds up to such an interesting conflict.<br><br>Gatchaman splitting is also an interesting idea. I'm really curious as which direction will they take for this show.</br></br></br>  Green Hitler is the best character  <br>Considering how little really happened in S1, I don't have hope for any of these plotlines to have any real consequences. I hope it will turn out to be better than S1 though.</br>  <br> bring in ANOTHER TRAP <br>I literally cracked up laughing when it was revealed.</br></br>  <br> Hajime slowly going crazy <br>Nah, Hajime is the only sane one of the bunch. If she were so easily corrupted by Katze, she wouldn't be Hajime.<br><br>I really like how they're incorporating the fact that the original Katze was his own sister, though. Now it's Hajime that's both a guy and a girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>S1 was all over the place at the beginning too. I remember how everyone thought it was going to be an alien-of-the-week show based off of the first episode.</br>  S1 &gt; S2  <br>Her talk about conflicts and shit gave a weird vibe to me. I'm not sure if it's off-character or not, she's eccentric alright but I don't remember her spouting something like that in season 1. Also her feelings balloon thingie never changes, always grey. I think it's hinting something.</br>  <br>That's just Hajime being Hajime. To translate for her, she's basically saying that life would be incredibly fucking boring if everyone agreed on everything. Conflict is important in everything, from large scale wars down to small scale simple conversation. If there's no conflict, that means there's no difference in opinion. Can you imagine an /a/ where everyone actually agrees with everyone? Disgusting.<br><br>Conflict is what makes people unique. Conflict is what makes things interesting. Conflict without reason, conflict that acts to harm others is bad, sure, but conflict on its own isn't just harmless, it's good.<br><br>Also remember that Tsubasa's granpa also has a grey bubble. Think of it as a zen state. Hajime has achieved perfect Genki Zen.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>S1 built up all the characters and the universe that this show exists in.<br>Now that it's all established, hopefully they'll do something interesting with it.</br></br>  <br>Makes sense, as I kind of forget how does she operates usually as I forgot many things from season 1. But that sounds kinda boring. I hope Katze inside her can at least influence her a bit. I don't like her that much in season 1, but in season 2 where she usually shown as a mentor/senpai character, I'm starting to like her better.</br>  <br>It's not gay if it's with a alien,right?</br>  <br>I could see Katze take over for a short while in the inevitable Hajime v Tsubasa battle later on, beating Tsubasa in within an inch of her life before regaining control. I see Hajime as a far more stable character, though. She's not there to develop, she's not there to guide the viewer, she's just leading her way through the world. She's already complete in a sense. I can definitely see why people would consider that boring, but I enjoy her personality.<br><br>Another thing to consider is that she's not really the main focus. In S1, Rui was essentially the main character; he had a character arc and everything. Now it's Tsubasa's turn. Perhaps you should think of her less as the protagonist and more as a vehicle for the story.</br></br></br>  <br>Technically, I think what matters is it's a boy.<br>But nobody would blame you here either ways.</br></br>  I'm sure this was mentioned a lot last week, but that "I'm not killing you" line, followed by the stabbing was a tiny bit contradictory. Are we supposed to sympathize with his ideals? Is he that type of villain?  <br>I don't think Katze has that power, but I hope so.<br>There is no doubt Tsubasa will be the main focus character-wise because Hajime isn't necessarily a character that develops if you get what I mean. She is what she is, and she won't change.<br>Tsubasa is going to align with Gel and butt heads with everyone else because she has a strict and rather blind definition of what heroism is and wants to naively "get rid of all conflict".</br></br></br>  <br> Gel chan is a boy <br>I told you so!<br><br>Also Hajimei will go full Diablo II and get possessed by Kazeberg.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you mean the VAPE leader? The "I won't be the one that kills you, it will be your ideals" line?</br>  <br><br>He's a blackflag. He wants crowds to look bad at all cost.</br></br>  <br>Gel doesn't have a gender. It's an alien. It changes its form to whatever is appropriate or necessary for the situation.</br>  <br>I think Hajime and Katze are going to have to clash and learn to fight in sync this season so we still might be getting some development.</br>  <br> &gt;Hajime slowly going crazy <br><br>Please elaborate</br></br></br>  <br>Um, it has a boy and a guy form.<br>It does have a gender.</br></br>  <br>They referred to the young form as a she though</br>  <br>Anon please.</br>  <br> what is trap <br>Come on he wears a short, and voiced by Hanakana, who is a popular choice for shota traps lately. Nothing implies it would be a girl aside from being androgenous, which is nothing new for this show. If he has a male adult form, why wouldn't it be a little boy?</br></br>  <br>Go back to tumblr.<br><br>https://twitter.com/GATCHAMANCrowds<wbr>/status/625010151456575488<br><br>He's a boy.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Because it's an alien, so I don't know why we're trying to ascribe human gender to it.<br>Granted, I could be overcomplicating things but I wouldn't put it past this show, and I see no evidence to the contrary.</br></br>  <br> They referred to the young form as a she though <br><br>The shitty subs did. They never did in Japanese.</br></br></br>  Banned in Australia  <br><br> ゲルサドラが少年の姿 <br> 少年の姿 </br></br></br>  <br>Anyways evidence still points that form being a boy in human terms.</br>  <br>Forget it, that is solid proof for him being a boy.</br>  <br>Yup. I only went off of the show, guess I should've looked it up. But I assumed Gatchaman with the reverse-traps and crossdressing would insert a character with no gender for manipulation purposes.</br>  <br>Aliens don't give a shit about acting like their gender is supposed to so it's not like it matters anyway.</br>  <br>It matters. He has balls and a wiener between his legs. Not a delicious loli pussy.</br>  <br>That's because they didn't know Gel was a boy.</br>  <br>He's just pissy because he's trying to quit smoking and all he's using to help is a fucking sucker.<br><br>Joe! Pull the stick out, get a nicotine patch!</br></br></br>  <br>Well in a way it's Schrödinger's crotch. Right now it is in a quantum state. We will only know for sure when it's observed.</br>  Just to put it here, Utsutsu is also a boy.  <br>You should learn to appreciate both.</br>  <br>Before she did it, she was worried Katze would affect her.<br><br>All that changed so far is inflated Hajime's and a tendency to shut him up through sleep</br></br></br>  <br>Hajime is not going crazy.<br><br>She is just the most who gets JJ so she speaks in a way similar to him.<br><br>:&gt;</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck You<br>u<br>c<br>k<br> <br>Y<br>o<br>u</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would be happy if I could, believe me.</br>  <br>Utsutsu is actually a tentacle monster in her true form.</br>  <br>Haven't seen JJ since Tsubasa. Last season didn't they all gather in the circle and listen to him now and then<br><br><br>Kinda surprising how none of them have commented on them being the antithesis of Crowds. Everybody gets powers vs specific folks chosen by an enigmatic creature</br></br></br></br>  <br>The other solid proof is nobody reacting with YOU'RE A BOY like happened with Rui. Everyone knew Gelsadra was a shota in the show.<br><br>HorribleSubs were Horriblesubs. There was no "she" or talk of Gel-kun being a girl in Japan.</br></br></br>  <br> a character with no gender for manipulation purposes. <br><br>OD is possibly that. At least the director doesn't consider them a man.</br></br></br>  <br>He's wearing high heels.<br>And Hajime's gigantic breasts go to show that women are represented with those in the series.<br>Utsutsu has a flat chest. Just accept Utsutsu-kun.</br></br></br>  <br>Smaller than a jap D-cup /= male</br>  <br>It's a boy. Believe me, I have a sense for these things.</br>  <br> Kinda surprising how none of them have commented on them being the antithesis of Crowds. Everybody gets powers vs specific folks chosen by an enigmatic creature <br><br>They should comment how dangerous they could be too. Katze was a Gatchaman.</br></br></br>  <br> Just to put it here, Utsutsu is also a boy. <br>Utsu utsu shimasu</br></br>  The only girls are Tsubasa and X.  <br> learn to fight in sync <br>If they don't make it so she is wearing half her armor and half Katze I will be extremely disappointed.</br></br>  <br>I'm not really seeing it but some anon said Hajime's suit is getting redder each time she transform. Is that true?</br>  Utsutsu is a plant   giving a shit about who is a boy and who is a girl in this show <br><br>I want to fuck all Gatchas, except the fatty host talk show. Even edgy carrotop, he needs a good dicking in jail.</br></br>  <br>Yes. Her note also changed.</br>  <br>E-even the prime minister?</br>  <br>This was her former suit. Her Note was completely white too, and now has red stripes.</br>  <br>In the beginning of the show I thought I wasn't going to enjoy OD, but they've definitely grown on me. Especially his Gatchman designs, it's by far the coolest looking one.</br>  <br>Specially him. He's 2moe.<br><br><br>comparison</br></br></br></br>  <br>OD is my favorite Gatchaman. Although I like Hajime, Rui and Katze too. Chill and motherly who is cool without acting like some forced anti hero like Joe (definitely my least liked one with Paiman).</br>  <br>Fatty host is definitely going to be the main instant this season, his lines are just too sinister to not have some major part in the main plot.</br>  <br>when is she going to turn into a villian</br>  <br><br><br><br>It seems the OD that the designer draws is a lot more womanly and beautiful. The show makes OD have some weird-wrinkles under the eyes but the designer OD is just an androgynous short haired alien-woman?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hajime and her boyharem </br>  <br>Hajime takes who she wants when she wants.</br>  <br>And OD's Gatcha is hostile to the environment</br>  <br> Sugane blushing  <br>Because of Hajime or Rui?</br></br>  <br>Utsutsu hair hug!</br>  <br> This is a boy </br>  Hajime seems to be a tad bit brooding lately  <br>Both.</br>  <br> Only half the characters in this picture are human </br>  <br>She's stuck with Tsubasa and her alien fuckboy. She was happier when she had Rui or Sugane as partner.</br>  <br>Utsutsu</br>  <br> this is also a boy </br>  OD's cat and X should become Gatchaman.  <br>Rui has the best female design. It's a fucking crime they didn't go with the original idea of making her a girl crossdressing as a boy in school/day time activities.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br> not a cat, a bud that will become his offspring </br>  I watched a few episodes of Gatchaman Crowds and it was complete shit, but the show had a great OST. So the question is, how is the OST shaping up for this series?  <br>OD felt like he was going to the generic flamboyant character when they first intruded them but I glad they had him be more of a nurturing character.</br>  <br>OD is flamboyant but he's also the mother of the theme, source of wisdom, secret trumpcard and nurses a pretty tragic past without bitching about everything as Jou's First world problems. <br><br>I hope he finally gets Baracchi and abandons that fattie. Baracchi was based.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm more annoyed at how Rui constantly talks about how THE PEOPLE will fix everything and everyone needs to believe in Crowds, and then he turns around and becomes a member of an exclusive elite that runs contrary to everything he preaches.<br><br>I wonder why no one has called him out on that yet.</br></br></br>  <br>Did you miss that he accepted evolution is a slow process? So he's willing to cooperate with Gatchaman and the Prime Minister as this progresses.<br><br>The society he aims to create is one were people become their own heroes, it's slowly becoming more egalitarian. <br><br>Crowds are another feature of his powers Gatchaman though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think of the gatchas as the admins that keep everything running smoothly for the users, who will do their online democracy thing for everything.<br><br>If reds weren't around pulling shit, there wouldn't be much need for gatchas, and they'd be irrelevant. Until Katze 2.0 happens.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He had a change of heart, and saw that the Gatchaman were a positive force (as in, they helped clean up his mess). They don't need to rub his face in it after he got the shit kicked out of him by Katze.</br></br>  <br>Go and re-watch the first season, you obviously missed Rui's storyarc. It was the opposite of Tsubasa's.</br>  <br><br>There's a difference between accepting an organization as an unfortunate necessity and becoming a full fledged member of said organization, especially when he still spouts his idealistic tripe at every opportunity.<br><br>It just strikes me as a tad hypocritical is all.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>All Rui wants is a world everyone has a chance to become a hero and will use their power for good. He can give humans this chance with CROWDS and Galax. This is a ridiculous amount of trust and belief.<br><br>He used to be completely dogmatic (much like Tsubasa is now, so she'll get a character development) against leaders and heroes, the "minority" until he realized he was wrong and fully admitted it in episode 7, this doesn't change or goes against his goal. He's not unifying a world as the "same" and fake equality (as Gelsadra wants), he's optimizing individual skills and talents through gamification as resource.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's no contradiction between what he says and does anymore. There was in season 1 and got told in episodes 6-7 and he realized it too.<br><br>You should watch again. You're eluding the fact that Crowds are the result of his power as a Gatchaman, so denying that is bullshit. He isn't against Gatchaman either. It doesn't do anything against his purpose.</br></br></br>  <br>Tsubasa a shit.<br><br>Wish granpa disowned her.</br></br></br>  <br> everyone should get a chance to be a hero! <br> except me! I get two chances! </br></br>  <br>She just doesn't know how to slow down.</br>  <br>That's like saying the police are contrary to his ideals.</br>  <br><br>This doesn't contradict his goal, though. He was already special as the person who made a fucking AI and GALAX which helped a great number of people and saved them from disasters. What he wants is to help others to become aware they have the power to change things and motivate them to do shit, which he accomplished even before he gave them the CROWDS with Galax.<br><br>You're grasping the straws and you missed his entire character development.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Pretty much.<br><br>Gatchaman are like the alien crisis police.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think some forget that Rui was always a special snowflake, unlike the other members of the team (we know nothing of the aliens). With the rest, they were normalfags or weirdos who got powers, Rui was a young teenage rich genius who made X and GALAX at least a year before Katze molested his soul. He was already a game changer, the CROWDS accelerated it.</br></br>  post ruibutt  Where's the new chapter? You told me it would be done this weekend, but all we have are vague spoilers.<br><br>Anyway, Prisma thread.</br></br>  Shirou apparently killed Kerry.  <br>2 more months until the anime starts.</br>  <br>I want Shirou out of Prisma.</br>  <br>We all want things. I want yuri out of Prisma.</br>  <br>It's just fanservice, All the girls lust after Shirou anyway.</br>  <br>What is this expression trying to convey?</br>  <br><br>Why does it take so long to scanlate a single chapter of a popular manga. If only Translator-fag did Illya too.</br></br>  <br>Shirou chose correctly.</br>  <br>[X] Save Miyu<br>[] Persist on being a superhero</br></br>  <br><br>I want action and fightan.</br></br>  <br>You mean 2.5 months till it ends.</br>  After watching both the second OVA and the ep1 of Herz, I can conclude that this is the best anime season we've had in a long, long time.  <br>Imoutos are worth it.</br>    <br>reminder he traded the ability to be a superhero for the ability to straight up shit divine artifacts out when he needs them.<br>seriously if the jewel healing thing that happened a couple chapters ago fixed his internal wound problems he might be able to do UBW and just spam serious bullshit.<br><br>also i'm curious at this point to see how the 5th war went with miyu around and this shirou.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That will be the next spin off series.</br>  <br>i almost feel like it was some fucked mix of UBW and HF, along with the ainsworths popping their heads in halfways through and fucking up the entire mess.</br>  <br> u told me it would be done this weekend, but all we have are vague spoilers. <br> just vague spoilers <br><br>Raws have been out for awhile.<br><br>Most of them are posted in the other thread.<br><br>Kerry is crazy with MoS and going to kill Miyu in the name of humanity, the only thing standing in his way is Shirou who's starting to go HF path instead, and will protect Miyu from him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  There's some notable wear and tear on Shirou's mind in the most recent chapter, as he's torn between his father and doing the right thing, as its really breaking him a bit.  <br><br>Best part was that split second where we saw Ilya's tongue go after Kuro's.</br></br>  in that moment he starts to warp    <br>I just love that serial killer smile.</br>  <br>Woa Shirou, you looked like Shiki for a moment there.</br>  Korean noises  <br>I imagine his HGW would be install/include battles.<br>Jamming Archer's card inside him might have gave him a crash course in Tracing and UBW.<br><br>I can't imagine Angelica's face while using Gil card when she lost inside his UBW for the first time.<br><br>inb4 Shinji installed Medusa Rider and got her suit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lewd! Way too lewd!</br>  been waiting for this thread<br>anime only fag here<br><br>why the fug does everyone love shirou so much</br></br></br>  <br> I imagine his HGW would be install/include battles. <br> Jamming Archer's card inside him might have gave him a crash course in Tracing and UBW. <br><br>Don't know how this theory got around or how it keeps spreading that he ever installed the Archer card, or that's how he got everything<br><br>its not really based on anything though. Only grails or homus can install cards so far.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Since Shirou is Archer, does including his card allow one to use his jackhammer?</br>  <br><br>I'm guessing it's a gag at this point. This show has a tremendous amount of callbacks to the original.</br></br>  There's maybe no fire in this world line? Yet shit still seems to have gone down for Shirou in a similar way.<br><br>Instead of walking through the flames step by step having to close his ears for the people calling for help as he had to ignore the, which fucked him up, it seems like it was more like this?<br><br>So slightly less fucked up</br></br></br></br>  Avalon might be unlikely    Why is it so lewd lately?  <br>Might be his Archer's arm equivalent</br>  <br>Its a theory people pulled out based on nothing. Nothing has said this has happened or that he installed to get his powers.<br><br>The reason he has more experience than his other self is that his other self was living in relative peace until he was eighteen. This Shirou was living to the death fighting against all who would come against him for far longer, and had to get experience and understand far before the other Shirou.<br><br>Its likely not some magic answer, rather he was forced to get started a lot sooner. We've never seen a normal human install anything to date. The most they can do is equips. He's not using the power of the Archer card, but archer's power is his power and he had to get good with it far sooner.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kerry is still an asshole <br><br>Welp.</br></br></br>  <br>No matter the universe some things just don't change.</br>  <br>He is the Hero the world needs.</br>  <br>Guess what choice led to everything being happy for everyone in normal Prism universe.<br><br>First hint, it was due to Kiritsugu making a certain choice.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd do the same actually.</br>  <br>I thought Angelica mentioned that the Archer card belonged to Shirou when she fought him and Kuro.</br>  <br>She was saying that this is his power, that the Archer card was him, not that he was literally using it at all.<br><br>She knew the identity of that hero without any chance.</br></br></br>  <br>Choice to be a family man asshole instead of being an utilitarian asshole.</br>  <br>How was he an asshole there? Everything worked out a thousand times better, saved his daughter and wife, and he was willing to take a chance while also shutting down the ritual.<br><br>Most you could really say is that he's not at home as much as he should be, but the maids are watching over his kids in the meantime.</br></br></br>  <br>THE BEST<br>H<br>E<br><br>B<br>E<br>S<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Shame Miyu Shirou is kind of a jobber.  <br>What is the purpose? It have some kind of deep meaning behind it? What are we supposed to feel here?</br>  <br>He lost to one of the most powerful entity in his world. How was that jobbing?</br>  <br>He's just not the main character, not a protagonist. So this is the first time we've seen Shirou without plot armor, meaning he's normal class armor but not special class armor.<br><br>People bitch too much about him being a jobber though. He fucking beat Gilgamesh head on, he's only been in two fights so far after literally storming against a horde of corrupted servants without effort.<br><br>People were bitching about him effortlessly stealing the show and beating everyone in the first two chapters he was introduced, so he had to be brought down a peg just like Bazett when she was introduced and shown that they "can" lose. Yet for some reason such a simple equalizer of showing that Shirou can lose and isn't perfect, has caused people to think he's absolute weak shit jobber. Everyone is amazing as soon as they show up, but we all know it'll come down to Ilya here.<br><br>He lost because someone who isn't an MC can't beat the main villain, so something suddenly had to arise to get in his way there.<br><br>No that isn't being a jobber at all. You don't hear people calling Tohsaka and Luvia a jobber after the dozens of times they've lost so far in this story? Yet someone will always bitch about Shirou as though he will always lose and its a shame. Dammit something about that is stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Lancelot <br> Powerful </br></br>  <br>He showed up, looked strong and cool, and then lost. That's pretty much jobbing.</br>  <br>Hiroyama has to ramp up the lewd before it gets banned for the Olympics, so he has to work twice as lewd per chapter now.</br>  <br>Sakuralot blindsided him.<br><br>If she wasn't there he would have manly fisticuffs with Julian.<br><br>My dick can't handle if Sakuralot upgrades to dark Sakuralot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mana-Transfer </br>  <br>I would consider backstabbing your employer, running away with their most important project and killing most if not all of them rather assholish behavior. Understandable but still quite assholish.</br>  <br>People call him a jobber because he showed up, looked cool, but got taken out for 90% of the fight.<br><br>He spent more chapters being healed by Rin than doing things. And why was he taken out again? To introduce a character who existed solely, at the time, to take Shirou out of the fight?<br><br>No seriously, does anyone actually fucking think Sakura's introduction in 3rei was handled well? she showed up, acted crazy, and then left. No prior introduction or set up. She was just some crazy bitch that appeared one chapter.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He atleast did better than Miyu, used Gils card and ended up being possessed by him.</br>  <br>No, he couldn't beat or even reach the main villain at that point, the fact that he tried already guaranteed his defeat there.<br><br>The main villain is always invincible until a few rules are met. Only the MC can beat them, you need to hear their backtstory and motivations first entirely along with the secret they were holding back, you need to understand them inside and out and know that there's nothing left to them anymore and thus they can be taken out.<br><br>He was a side character trying to go for the MC credit there, which cannot happen. Something had to get in the way, just like something had to get in the way of Bazett taking out GIlgamesh in 2wei.</br></br></br></br></br>  Even her GOB items got taken over by Lancelot.  <br>I was talking about before he got captured. Beside, he lost to Julian and co before. If he won this fight, it would be an asspull.<br><br><br>Sakuralot is a kind of jobbing, but I think the whole fight isn't.</br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw you'll never be dominated by loli Gil <br><br>;_;</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think anyone here is saying he should have solo'd Julian and everyone, but he got a strong introduction, and then just did nothing for the rest of the arc. It was not exactly flattering.</br>  <br> Haven't read the manga yet, so excuse me if I sound like a retard. <br>Did he get fused with avalon at any point, because that is supposed to be where his origin and affinity come from. Which is what I believe allows him to trace weapons at all.<br>Where would his knowledge of weapons to trace come from in this anyway.<br>I am not sure if these plots points are the same or even covered at all. I do know that the grail war was stopped.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds like you just hate it so you're making up reasons even when they aren't right or don't have basis. You'll keep doubling down on those reasons no matter what, but what you're really saying underneath it all is that you just hated a lot of 3rei, so you've gotta rationalize it by throwing terms around.<br><br>No he's not a jobber, nor do you know what a jobber is there. You could say Bazett or Kuro got the exact same treatment in the manga, yet you don't consider them a jobber, because you're mainly looking for a reason to hate this. No there was nothing wrong with Lancelot's introduction there, it might not have been what you wanted but there was nothing wrong with it.<br><br>Shirou when he appeared took out dozens and beat Gilgamesh, then he lost as he needed to lose in order to create some tension and because he couldn't beat Julius yet. He's had a far better showing than almost anyone in the manga to date, yet you want it to just be "Oh man too bad he just sucks so much and is destined to lose no matter what, because fuck that part when he appeared".</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Miyuverse Shirou still best Shirou.</br>  <br>I just want to see small Gil use his card and see how it goes, hell with out it he still had GOB, but it was empty or something.</br>  <br> fully incarnated shota gil <br> shota gil carrying an oversized EA to blow up julius's shit when he inevitably does something to piss him off. </br></br>  <br>Your entire first paragraph is a weird personal attack that makes you come off like a know it all. It's not charming.<br><br>Yeah, I'm gonna be straight up. I didn't like the last story arc. It was a clustefuck of throwing "cool" things one after the other, with no semblance of actually following through with them. They introduced Shirou, he was around for a chapter or two, but got taken out and then became a commodity to save. They introduced Sakura of all characters, and what did she do? She tried to kill Shirou, and then just left. They didn't set her up like Miyu Shirou or gave any prior indication of her existence, she was just some crazy character who showed up in the middle of a fight.<br><br>Then you've got Gil, who finally had his card back, and did shit all with, even then the prior chapter set up a fight. We just got nothing. It was a mess. Even the entirety of the fight ended with Julian and company just leaving. It was anticlimax after anticlimax.<br><br>And for the record, Bazett and Kuro were seen as competent for a pretty long while until a bigger threat set things straight. Miyu Shirou got about a chapter or two?<br><br>Anyway, I'm guessing we've probably had this conversation before. I find that there are a lot of flaws in Prisma, in the back of my mind I'm constantly aware that this is a fanservice manga that right now, is trying to be serious, so I'm not going to give it the benefit of the doubt. It needs to earn being well regarded and not just a piece of fluff.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   caring about things that aren't love and friendship <br>Guys this is mahou shoujo, the shit you're arguing about is literally just unimportant background fluff that's just there to be surpassed by the heroines.</br>  <br>Oh look, it's another guy that showed up, looked strong and cool, and then fucked off without doing anything. Hiroyama is the master of leaving everyone hyped with a cliffhanger and then end it up with a disappointed conclusion. Like in the latest chapter, everyone is thinking Shirou is going to kill the Edgelord, that ain't gonna happen, Kerry is just going to drop dead killed by whatever disease he has now.</br>  <br> Oh look, it's another guy that showed up, looked strong and cool, and then fucked off without doing anything. <br><br> Oh I fucking hate when an author sets up things. When something happens it must happen all at once and right now, otherwise it meant nothing. I fucking hate how Shirou being a major player was talked about since the beginning of 2wei, yet he didn't do something right from the chapter when he was talked about thus proving the author forgot about him and he never mattered. Why doesn't everything happen immediately and everything be settled right now? </br></br></br>  <br>Not that guy, but when you set things up, and don't follow through with them, that is a problem.<br><br>The Gil chapter is a prime example. Prior chapter ended with a big two page spread with Gil basically saying it was time to fuck shit up. What happens after that? He leaves.<br><br>I would like to know what the pay off for that is, because to me it just seems like the author was trying to hook people for the next chapter even though he didn't have any proper plans for the character.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Fucking whore.</br>  <br>Yep, Sapphire is a giant slut.</br>  <br>What annoys me the most about the non-blood related revelation is that we partially lost one of the arguments about Miyu being a real lesbian, now it's more possible that she actually wants the Shirou dick.</br>  <br>Why is she not for sale?</br>  <br>Actaully Sapphire is pure, it's Ruby who got messed up by old men.</br>  <br>no one pays for used goods</br>  <br>Because she's not Rin.</br>  <br> blood-related means they can't fuck <br> not-blood-related means they can <br>Both of these are bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>Sapphire got handled by an old man too.<br>She just keeps appearances better, but is actually a slutwhore like her sister.</br></br>  <br> implying she didn't wished to become Shirou's blood sister. <br><br>She's a superior grail over Illya, wish like that should jack easy for her.</br></br></br>  <br> she's a superior grail over ilya <br>She really is? That's odd.<br>Ilya will always be my favourite cup, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit, sheero poisoned kerry.</br>   download hiryuu sub of ep1 <br> it's actually less accurate than HS <br>Her name might officially be Chloe, but everyone uses Kuro as her nickname. Why are there still people that don't understand this?</br></br>  <br>Because they sound the same in Nipponese.

Illya's shown more romantic affection for Kuro of all people and that's saying something.</br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't want to break her heart now, would we?</br>  <br>Someone's asking to get smacked with a fan again it seems.</br>  <br>Just so long as we all know none of the lolis are winning Shirou.</br>  <br> people actually ship Miyu and Illya <br>It's the chief director of Prisma Illya, Oonuma Shin.</br></br>  <br> Miyu is so ridiculously friendzoned it's not even funny. <br><br>That's how you want to see it I guess, while you plugged your ears and closed your eyes to the ending of 2wei and much of 3rei since it didn't agree with your ship.<br><br>That's not really the official stance however, nor is it correct within reality.</br></br></br></br></br>  Illya x Miyu x Kuro is an OT3 anyway.  go illya x shirou or go home  <br><br>Are you sure about that?

I cant stop ejaculating someone send help  <br>There's only one way to fix that. Do what you must.</br>    Serious question:<br><br>Does anyone else feel anime is getting too lewd?</br></br>  inb4 IlyaKuro kissu  Normal japanese people don't watch the lewd stuff.<br>All that otaku pandering crap airs at 4am, so only nerds watch it.</br>  <br> kissu <br><br>STOP</br></br></br>  anime isn't lewd enough.  The last episode was the lewdest thing I've seen in a long while. But no, OP, I don't.  <br><br>so what's "primetime" anime in japan? mecha?</br></br>  <br><br>You didn't watch Prisma last week?</br></br>  <br>wholesome anime that promotes good moral values</br>  <br><br>I think Monster Musume is too lewd.</br></br>  I don't think it's TOO lewd but I do think the lewd is being used in a lazy way to give shallow series more attention.  <br><br>No. I think we're to the point where anime can be much more transparently lewd then it once was, and I think we've been there for a while, but I do not think it is "too lewd". If it were in fact "too lewd", then people would just not watch/buy it and that anime would die off to market forces. If they continue to make lewd anime, then I would assume it is serving the legitimate purpose of entertaining lewd individuals. If you are concerned that the lewdness is corrupting anime, I am under the impression it is just a particular subset of anime, and those disinterested in lewdness can merely choose to avoid that anime.</br></br>  <br>Well dude, it's like this, most shows are going to pander to the lowest common denominator, which means 1. sex appeal, and 2. gratuitous violence.<br><br>That's the same anywhere. Just look at pretty much Every successful tv series in the west since like the 70's. It's been progressively lewder and lewder. The same with anime.<br><br>Now that said, it doesn't mean ALL shows are becoming lewder. It's always been a fraction of the shows that were really good, so don't be dismayed. It's just easy ratings to appeal to the basest aspects of human nature.<br><br>The irony is that it's passe to show men and women getting violently and graphically gored to death, but it's still taboo to show penetration or long full frontal nudity scenes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it's passe to show men and women getting violently and graphically gored to death <br><br>let's not go that far, even normies think game of thrones goes too far sometimes.</br></br></br>  <br>did that actually happen in the show though</br>  Getting too lewd? Probably not. There's been more lewd anime since before you were even born.  am I the only one who doesn't like blatant fanservice<br><br>lewd things are always better when they're kept subtle instead of thrust in your face</br></br>  <br>not really<br><br> this was rated PG </br></br></br>   anime about lewd is actually lewd <br>Who could have guessed?</br>  <br>Blatant fanservice has its place, but in the "average anime" I prefer more subtlety</br>  <br>I don't like it either, but it works in some series, like Shokugeki no Souma and Ben-To.</br>  <br>Yeah, but I'm talking about what they do to push for ratings. All that is about ratings. As long as they can get it to air, they'll make it as extreme as they possibly can. Even controversially so to create buzz about it. That's the only reason for that shit. It's understandable even to a retard (thereby being entertaining to the widest possible demographic) because there's nothing to think about. It's just either sheer eroticism or gratuitous violence.<br><br>I never watched game of thrones, and now that it's turned to shit, I am glad I didn't waste my time.</br></br></br>  <br>People only think GoT goes to far when rape is involved, as far as I can tell.

I'm gonna make them give back our past.</br>  <br>There are kids shows like Precure and One Piece (hence why the anime isn't nearly as violent as the manga), shows that air at prime time, usually popular shonen manga like FMA or Nanatsu that aren't quite as censored, midnight anime (noitamina) and then basically everything else that's one/two-cour airs after that, with more lewd otaku bait later in the morning than otherwise mundane shit that nerdy teenagers might stay up to watch</br>  <br>If you're a normal japanese person, you have little reason to download anime or even own a PC.<br>Only otaku would risk getting branded with criminal copyright infringement for torrenting anime raws.</br></br>  <br>Even otaku DVR most things and watch them the next day.</br>  <br>D<br>V<br>R</br></br></br>  <br>No more censored Jav porn<br>Make doujin artists teach anime artists how to draw nipples</br></br>  Nope, Punchline from last season was drenched in it and was solid through and through.

Is it worse than Qwaser? Why would you watch it if you don't enjoy it?<br><br>I'm watching plenty of anime this season and I don't see this lewdness anywhere. The most degenerate thing that comes to mind is the fucktoy trap's ass from Ranpo Kitan. Rokka has lewd outfits but they are treated as normal. Gangsta has actual prostitutes but it's not actually lewd. I could go on, but you get my point.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah you're a faggot</br>  I still can't believe people unironically like Shimoneta.  <br><br>Most of the IPs are Nyaa are from Japan.</br></br>  <br> Qwaser <br>I think the lewdness peaked at Seikon no Qwaser but that was a while aho</br></br>  <br>So people that aren't from nippon upload and then nipponese DL?</br>  This shit's been going on since Go Nagai in the 70s. Hardly a new trend.  <br>Only if you remember to rewind the DVD</br>  <br>Even 'police state' UK rarely does. Its uploading/hosting that tends to get you into shit</br>  <br>No most of the people who use Nyaa are Japanese. About 50% of them.</br>  <br><br>If that's true then why is nyaa in English?</br></br>  <br>source?</br>  <br>Just use google to find out nyaa's current traffic.<br><br>Probably because the owners of the site speak English.</br></br></br>  <br>January 2010 to be precise.

I mean wouldn't it make more sense that nipples or genitalia would be more apropriate than seeing someone die in a horrofic way?</br>  <br>its not that I have any problem with sexuality its the way sexual things in anime are often done makes it feel like cheap pandering</br>  <br>Conditioning</br>  <br>Not just centering it to anime, i mean in general. Western shows are also like that.</br>  <br>QB isn't that lewd, to be honest.<br>Most of it's ecchi is casual, it's only a few characters, Melpha, Melona, and Nyx that were actively lewd.<br>The rest of the ecchi pretty much came from character designs and armor break</br></br></br>  <br>There's showing a nipple, and there's selling softcore pornography.<br><br>I was disgusted by Railgun's clones arc (and its lack of consequences), and also by Chaika's flying fortress of tortured virgins. Don't assume that people that get triggered by a hot springs scene are necessarily fapping to gore.<br><br>I dislike anime that pushes into porn territory and gore porn equally, unless it's actually funny or the violence is justified (in which case is no longer gore porn).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well if we're talking about american television it really comes down to christfags and their "oh god won't someone please think of the children" attitude, and politicians (most often republicans, hate to say though some dems have gone full retard in the past as well) that are all too willing to pander to them.<br><br>In Europe, latin america, and the non muslim nations in western asia television is considerably more lax when it comes to nudity.</br></br></br>  <br>Generally we know violence is bad and we know better than to do it.<br><br>Sex on the other hand is good. And delicious and tempting. But it's VERY easy to abuse. Peoples' arousal often get the better of them and can lead them to do stupid things. And if you fuck around too much with sex, especially with the younger crowd you get some serious consequences.<br><br>With blood and guts, you simply know not to do it. It's bad for your health, it's against the law and it's bad for society in general. <br><br>That and...well...you can only kill someone once. Sex is a mistake that can be repeated again and again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> lack of consequences <br>why would there be, they are basically ants.</br></br>  <br>What were the mud fights? Echidna? Or the angel who kept getting covered in "milk"? I actually somewhat enjoyed it for the fights and the not-awful production values, but let's not kid ourselves.</br>  <br> being this edgy </br>  <br> I was disgusted by Railgun's clones arc (and its lack of consequences), and also by Chaika's flying fortress of tortured virgins. <br>grow a spine</br></br>  I don't think it's getting too lewd at all. I think moreso a lot of it is just getting to meaningless and substanceless and things are just there to cater to someone's dick or gore fetish or whatever other directly pandering thing. Not every scene has to have deep meaning but a lot of things are just so in your face like "we know you want this, buy the blurays!" It's just too conducive to bad writing and way too catering to simpletons who want that shit writing, and it lowers the bar. We need James Cameron to raise that bar back up.  <br>grow  __up___ </br>  The general population of 2chan/futaba has the same opinion like us.  <br>do they think sao is crap?</br>  <br>Is she an android</br>  <br>They like it when it was airing, but just like /a/, not so much discussion about the series anymore.</br>  <br>Is that an app to get romaji over moonrunes?</br>  <br> App <br><br>Furigana and Rikaichan add-ons are your best friend when learning moon and reading 2chan at beginner level.</br></br></br>  <br>Automatic furigana seems like shit.

The emphasis on broadcast TV instead of OVAs is too restraining towards both sex and violence.</br>  <br>Thread should have ended here</br>  <br>violence has increased as well as sexuality. look at the 50's - most of it was guys holding their chest and keeling over when they died, and they kissed more often behind closed doors. some how violence standards dropped quicker.<br><br>i believe it's because there are plenty of people we wouldn't mind seeing shot but couldn't look at naked</br></br></br>  <br> That and...well...you can only kill someone once <br>But what if they don't die after being killed?</br></br>  Even the self proclaimed pervert Kajo cannot handle Anna    Not enough inverted nipples and G cup boob sucking, so no, it could be more lewd.  <br>tfw every normalfag will speak like this.</br>  <br>What you see in procedurals during prime time TV used to be relegated to gore. Children who used to read biographies of serial killers now watch actual beheadings or car crashes with mangled bodies. Go to a Mortal Kombat discussion and they will tell you that the games have always been this violent.<br><br>The media has become more extreme than ever, while at the same time the population has become softer, more liberal and with a thinner skin than ever. Try making sense of that.</br></br></br>  <br> look at the 50's <br>Most 4chan users' parents are too young to remember the 50's. And just 10 years before the 50's, the entire world killed each other in real life. 10 years later, the 60's happened and everyone decided to deliberately destroy 50's society. It was a brief bubble that stood between massive outbursts of real life sex and violence.</br></br>  Anime has always had a lewd element. I don't think it's really got any worse over time. Some things take it to a bit of an extreme, but if there's a market for it, so be it.  <br>Why would a beginner read 2ch? 4chan is the last place I would recommend for a beginner in English.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128683962 <br>/pol pls fuck off</br>  <br>Pretty much. Rape and sex happen in the book, but its in a very matter of fact kind of way. They don't devote entire scenes to showing sex except when its very plot relevant.</br>  <br>Ha<br>Actually English is not my first language and I learned english from reading /a/ since 2009, having fun while reading is also a plus to keep motivated. <br><br>Anyway, other than 2chan, NHK easy is a good place to learn basic moon vocab for basic to intermediade moon readers.<br>http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Take something like Saber Marionette. A young man living with a harem that lusted for his cock (including a gay male), and there were revealing outfits. But it was still a cute show for all ages. <br><br>There wasn't love juice, trails of saliva, talk of erect nipples or naked girls grinding against the protagonist. It's fundamentally different from today's market.</br></br></br>  <br>That sounds fundamentally the same as today's market.</br>  <br>Hey, they didn't even show the chapter where Miia molts. THAT's lewd. Up till now, you ain't seen nothin yet.</br>  <br>Except not at all, since this is a thread about the escalation of lewdness and not about basic scenarios like harems being repeated.<br><br>Saber Marionette is something that you could watch with your little sister without it being weird. Or Ranma 1/2, a series with a massive harem and uncensored nipples, which I used to watch on TV before going to primary school.</br></br></br>  <br>I think the problem OP is seeing is more that even supposedly tame anime are adding on the lewd. <br>For example, when I buy a volume of To-Love-Ru Darkness, I know I'm in for an avalanche of naked girls and questionable situations. If I hadn't known that when I started the series, I'd know it by now.<br>If I buy the first Sword Art Online book while knowing nothing of the story, I'd have about two hundred pages of typical shounen-in-a-vidya-game. And then, suddenly, Asuka in underwear. Of course I wouldn't necessarily expect that, it's not that kind of genre.<br>Even the slice of life cutesy bullshit is hit hard by this. Compare K-On, where cute girls cuddling was once considered lewd, to Hibike Euphonium.</br></br></br></br>  <br>but it's always the jews. whether or not you want to see the truth doesn't change that<br><br>i think it's because we don't have shit to deal with. again, look at the old days - you had wholesome productions with everyone in smart suits and smiling, when people had real problems like getting their kids feed and maybe moving up a class. today we're worried about if someone types something mean and if you bought the right phone. and now the media is DRAMA DRAMA DRAMA<br><br>when i got out of the gulf last year i was like "fuck sons of anarchy, i want some leave-it to beaver"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Euphonium was only perverted in the minds of yurifags.</br>  <br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128683962 <br><br><br>Okay, no, fuck this. You're singled out, you little shit. Seikon no Qwaser is fucking awesome. It's just lewd enough to be interesting but not lewd enough to mess with the actual plot, the fights are awesome and it has pretty much no boring characters.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well it is pretty damned censored compared to the manga.</br>  No, if anything it's gotten more conservative. <br><br>Seriously, how anyone could fap to 2d nowadays is beyond me.</br></br>  <br>I bet she would be a sex demon once her pure barrier is broken.</br>  <br> normies <br>Why has this become common? Are you faggots too lazy to type out normalfag, or do you just like coming across as pissant teenagers?</br></br>  <br>i bet many things are beyond you anon</br>  <br>i cant be bothered to type it all out<br>even normies are using normies as a word now</br></br>  <br>Fuck off, Anna. It's people like you that make it hard for people to come to grasp with sexuality in the first place! You know, i most places where sexuality is embraced, there are less rapes, and lower teen births? You fuckers are going to ruin life for everyone, at this rate!</br>  <br>That's pathetic.</br>  <br>Shut up, you normie.</br>  <br>Normie sounds better and more insulting. I'd rather call someone a normie faggot than a normalfag, and weeb shit rather than weeaboo. It's got nothing to do with laziness.</br>  <br>Holy fuck, you're right. I know I'm sounding like a dumbass right now, but I've never seen it quite that way.<br><br>India: rooted in pre-medieval bullshit<br>Rape level: over [overused meme here]<br><br>Murrica: pseudo-Christian sects desperately try to enact an all-sex-is-evil campaign<br>rampant teen pregnancy and quite a bit of rape<br><br>Western Yurop: highly educated and enlightened<br>way less of both than murrica</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It sounds like a twelve year old who is too scared to write fag.</br>  <br>I actually read some idiots claiming that Shimoneta was highly unrealistic, because with Japan's low birthrates, banning porn would drive those numbers even lower and drive the Japanese to extinction, and no government would ever do something so suicidal.</br>  <br>Making a thread about something doesn't mean it's happening. There's still plenty of things a little sister can watch, and Ranma's uncensored nipples are something you don't see as frequently. If Ranma aired today, people would be calling it an escalation of lewdness and transsexual propaganda.<br><br><br> K-On, where cute girls cuddling was once considered lewd <br>This reaction image is for you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>4chan is 18+</br>  <br> Calling things weeb <br> on /a/ </br></br>  <br>Stop asking questions.</br>  <br>This is the state in which we find ourselves.</br>  <br> Normie <br>normie is shit that came from reddit,<br>I'm just saying</br></br></br>  <br><br>Is fag considered such a strong word? To me, if anything sounds childish it's precisely adding fag after everything. I've been here on and off for almost a decade now and I find it cringeworthy, like reading an ED article with an "in my vagina?" or "over 9000 penises" joke every other sentence.</br></br>  Mitsudomoe and the latest Enma-kun series aired in kids slots  <br>Like Coontown. What's your point? Are you trying to feel superior to others while you are posting on the cucks' nest that is 2015's 4chan?</br>  <br>It's juvenile and obnoxious when abused, but it's a catch-all insult/term of endearment.</br>  <br>And normie is somehow better? Whatever, Mr. super cool oldfag.</br>  <br> way less of both than murrica </br>  <br>It actually sounds more and more stupid the more you think about it. I do believe such laws would be Japan's suicide, though for a different reason:<br>If anything that shows anything lewd is censored, then almost no Animu/Mango will still be allowed because they are so busy jacking up the lewd. Thus, no more Animu/Mango/Vidya. Thus, Japan's most successful exports would cease to exist. At that point, no amount of Kobe beef could save their economy.</br></br>  <br>Non-fagfags are fags.</br>  <br>I don't know, that shit is pretty fucking delicious.</br>  <br>It sounds more ridiculous which is all I care about. You can say whatever the fuck you want.</br>  <br>Whereas normie sounds idiotic and juvenile. Whatever high ground you think you have never existed.</br>  <br>Yes, and it's fucking expensive. If they made more of it, the price would drop. It can't support an entire economy on its own and let's be honest here, that tiny island doesn't have enough resources for most great money-making schemes. They do have video games, anime and manga. If they censor that to shit the way its done in Shimoneta, they only have cheap cars and expensive beef left.<br><br>And incidentally, Captcha makes me search for steaks.</br></br></br>  <br>you'd think the federal government would learn from porn and try to do one of those crazy schemes</br>  <br>I just said that normie sounds more ridiculous and that's why I like it. How's that a high ground? Are you a retardfag?</br>  <br>That's only because she actually understands what Anna is doing.</br>    <br>Nah, I recall one controvery when a guy squeezed in a guy's eyeballs and pushed his head into the ground until it exploded, normies complained about that.</br>  <br> Normie sounds better <br>no it doesn't stop trying to force your reddit memes</br></br>  <br>Getting real sick of this 'Europe is paradise' meme.</br>  <br> meme <br>More like bad joke, really. Then again, the anon's post holds some validity  if you ignore the masses of kebab and sandniggers invading the continent and spreading THEIR beliefs about sexuality. Just look at Sweden's rape statistics. </br></br>  <br> Does anyone else feel anime is getting too lewd? <br>How new are you? This is nothing.</br></br>  <br>But complaining about that particular incident is natural. It even made me squirm.</br>  <br>glad someone posted this already</br>   pretending anything released lately is more lewd than Ladies x Buttlers.   We need to go lewder.  <br> sweden <br> not the rape capitol of the world </br></br>  <br><br>I agree, normie sounds more condescending. Normalfag just sounds like you're trying too hard.</br></br>  <br>Anons are lewder.</br>  <br>  Does anyone else feel anime is getting too lewd? <br>There probably have been more exposed tits in the past, but I guess the degree of perversion of thought and actions displayed compensated for it.<br><br>Either way, no. Many a scene that was meant to be sexy fan service just ends up being not lewd enough. It's only a few anime that manage to make it work, the others should be lewder.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But that's a good thing. I hope a miracle happens and things gets even lewder despite 2020 being so close.</br>  <br>its very simple<br>if you watch a movie and all you see is violence in it, someone beating another up every few minutes you'll get tired of it and change the channel because thats just ridiculous.<br>i agree with OP on this one, anime does get progressively lewder as time goes by, and i personally dropped this one because it was literally tiring to see some kind of a sexy scene every 3 minutes.<br>both are bad. seeing too much of both is equally tiring in my eyes.</br></br></br></br>  <br> good moral values <br>Whether that was intentional or not, it made me chuckle.</br></br>  <br>no fucking way source</br>  <br>a true hero</br>   Too lewd   Why is the ED so great?

Rape is going down so much feminists have to keep defining rape down to "fully sober and awake in the middle of the day with lights on and two witnesses to confirm consent." You don't have to get lawyers yet, but who knows. <br> teen pregnancy <br>Going down tons too. Mostly just messicans now, though all poorfag normies do it to one extent or another.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Chaika's flying fortress of tortured virgins <br><br>That was legitimately disturbing. They could have made a show about people living in a small village where young women are abducted and no one really knows what for or why.

How do you say<br><br>To carry something? Does 持っている work?<br><br>Where should i put x?<br><br>Ill go get x.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So, the guide says that kanji, vocab, and grammr should be learned at the same time, but I'm a little confused. In Anki, vocab decks use kanji for the words. In order to be able to read those, you'd need to be able to read the kanji. So wouldn't you have to know a fair amount of kanji before you can do vocab? Or am I misunderstanding?  <br>You can learn kanji when they come up in vocab words, you know.</br>  <br>運ぶ means to carry something, especially something heavy.<br><br>Where should I put X?<br>Xをどこに置きましょう？<br><br>I'll go get X.<br>Xを取って来ます。</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends. If you mean carry something somewhere it's 運ぶ, but you can't use it for objects that are too small or light like a pen. If you mean simply standing there holding the thing 持つ works.</br>  <br>Im a bit confused about to put. Could you also use 出す for a verb as to put something?</br>  <br>置く literally means put something somewhere. I don't know why you'd want to use anything else. I've never heard 出す used that way.</br>  <br>出す　is for pulling things out, like ちんこを出す</br>  <br>Yeah, that's true.</br>  <br>Oh ok, im just nervous, in japan, when i said x はどこに置くか？ I got a confused look. Is it because i didn't conjugate it into 置きましょう？<br><br><br>Thanks</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks. けいたいをだ出した</br>  <br>x はどこに置くか? Would be interpreted as "Where are you going to put that?" You should have used 置こう / 置きましょう, or even 置くべき (should put).</br>  Today's hard. Really really hard physically. I don't want to read as much as I normally do tonight after work. Someone call me some names or post cute dekichan please.  <br>So when the verb is in volational form or べき it makes it question personal.</br>  <br>Not necessarily. It's just that when you use the non-past form, it doesn't make sense as a question when you are the subject.<br><br>If you were the subject of x はどこに置くか, it would mean you were asking "Where will I put this?" not "Where should I put this?" and that is why you got a weird look. The listener can't tell you where you're GOING to put it, only where he/she wants it put.<br><br>If the listener of x はどこに置くか is the subject, then the question is "Where are you going to put it?" which makes a lot more sense, so they are more likely to interpret it that way.</br></br></br></br></br>  Putting か at the end of a non-polite sentence can be pretty rude, and か is usually used with yes or no sentences in casual speech. Most of the other things suggested so far are pretty unnatural<br><br>You want something like どこに置けばいいですか？ or in casual speech even just どこがいい？</br></br>  <br>Hmmm, i thought you could be more relaxed with that rule, but i guess not.</br>  <br> I got to study being more polite.</br>  <br><br>Would something like ほうがいいかな sound dumb as well?</br></br>  wow my reading improved a lot. Don't give up at beginner reading hell. You can do it!  <br>ほう implies a comparison between two things, so yes.</br>  <br>I started Yotsuba today. I'm reading it fairly slowly and referencing translations after each page to see if my guesses are at least somewhat accurate. It makes me feel really dumb at times when I'm completely wrong or don't really understand a line (especially when it's adults talking), but it's still a major step up from the incomprehensible scribbles it was before I started Japanese.</br>  <br> referencing translations after each page to see if my guesses are at least somewhat accurate <br>Don't do this, man.</br></br>  <br><br>Why not?</br></br>  <br>By translations, I mean the Yotsuba reading pack, a translated version of Yotsuba (just as a general idea of what the line was about if I was completely stumped), and sometimes checking the archive to see if anyone else was confused about a line in particular. I'm mostly just using it as "training wheels" so to speak and plan to stop using it after the first volume or so. Are the translations really that wrong? Or is there something wrong with checking the translation on lines that stump you?</br>  <br> guesses are at least somewhat accurate <br>If you're just guessing and have no faith in its accuracy then you should probably study some more before you read. Especially if you're doing it after each page, seriously. <br><br>Because you're basically doing the equivalent of learning from anime subs. You're enforcing in your mind someone else's specific english rendition of the text as what is correct instead of understanding the japanese on its own.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I used to do this. It's great at first when you're but don't get used to only doing it. The translation isn't always there. Try going a couple of pages without it for reference. Don't listen to the haters, its great to get started.<br><br><br>I prefer Hanahira as my first reading material, since you have a text hooker you spend little to no time referencing vocab you don't know so you can focus on reading more. Also it has voice acting which is really nice and useful</br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=AcE<wbr>29niMLEs</wbr>  [ ]<br>Watch this<br>They go to a ハーフ会<br>This is what your kids are going to be like</br></br></br>  <br>Not sure about よつばと translation since I never actually read it in English,<br>I doubt it's terribly inaccurate since the language used in it is pretty basic, but you can never be sure with translations. <br>Worst thing about this method is that it keeps you thinking in terms of Japanese to English translation, when your goal here is just understanding Japanese.</br></br></br>  <br> implying any of us will have kids </br>  <br>to add to this, i didn't have much vocab when i started reading, so i was constantly looking up words i knew but didn't know i knew, and the same words over and over again. Doing this significantly slowed me down and i was exhausted after 10 sentances. What i did to fix this was i signed up for LingQ, self-refered myself several times, and read "who was she". until i got used to reading. When i went back to Hanahira i was blazing through it compared to my old speed.<br><br>its really situational, but it's what got me through the beginner reading wall. I've never noticed such a huge improvement in a couple of days before.</br></br></br>  <br>Why would you be under the impression that I want to impregnate a Japanese person?</br>  <br>Kill yourself, nigger.</br>  <br>Faggot</br>  <br>I tried doing that first, but text hooker didn't pick up a lot of the slang/slurred words and the archive wasn't much help for a lot of the lines I was having trouble with, so I decided to step back and do a couple volumes of Yotsuba first and then maybe try Flyable Heart after that in hopes that that has slightly less slang/slurred words.<br><br><br>It's mostly a self confidence issue if I'm honest. What I think the sentence is / is about is right most of the time, but I still feel the need to check anyways just in case I'm wrong.<br><br><br>I'm trying not to translate into English, I'm pretty much just using the translation as a rough guideline to see what the page/conversation was to see if I was following it well in Japanese.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a weeaboo that can't do anything except shitpost and project like a son of a bitch.</br>  <br>Shut the fuck up.

With a bit of preparation these sorts of encounters could be used to get a whole heap of answers to questions which come to mind during study, and to get speaking practice with someone who will stop you and provide actual corrections. <br><br>italki and mylanguageexchange are decent online resources but it's a bit of a gamble. Shadowing audio from text is also a powerful tool for getting your mouth used to making Japanese sound like Japanese and can be like a wading pool of sorts to build confidence before speaking with natives/unscripted. There are plenty of websites with text/audio for basic conversations, etc. Jpod101 is great for this as their audio lessons come with a transcript with vocab and grammar points. There are gigs worth of lessons in the CoR. <br><br>If your reading is okay enough there are also a range of audio texts in the CoR under Japanese !L-R.

I legitimately don't understand how King Crimson works in ASB, and Pucci sucks until you get C-Moon, which is near impossible. At least in my experience.</br>  <br>Kosaku Kawajiri, actually. I just love when I can work out a way to hit BITE ZA DUSTU</br>  <br>I don't often have a chance to play (I don't own a PS3, but I found the game cheap and use my college's gaming club to play) but I've found Pucci to be the most fun, trying to set up "Maiden Heaven".<br><br>Those fucking name changes. Kek.</br></br></br>  <br>The gay part is a memetic thing based off his relationship with Dio.. He's better called Pucci though because that's a cool name.</br>  <br>"Oh no, something that I cannot possibly touch is falling towards me, what do I do!

I found that Erasing time a lot helps you to jumo behind an opponent and Pound them with a punch as soon as time erase ends. With Pucci I use Whitesnake's rush that instantly cripples the oppontment and you're able to do it twice in a row without them being able to do anything. Whitesnake also has his illusion counter move.</br>  <br>I main Kousaku because BtD is the best GHA</br>  <br>No, he's saying that SBRverse Jolyne and Pucci will be friendly.</br>  <br>I'm I the only person who mains a Hamon user in this entire thread?</br>  <br>true<br><br>they did both try to kill Valentine though, and Diego tried to rely on summoning Johnny to get the job done</br></br></br>  <br>Any more jump covers with Jojo characters?</br>  <br>Whitesnake has some ok combos if you're not getting a chance to yell at a baby.</br>  <br>If we ever see them.

I realize this has to be pre-SBR, with corpse parts and everything, but still:<br><br>Only villian who got (self)penetrated multiple times was Kira.<br><br>Well, there's DIO and his finger, but still.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a good point. Maybe not? I don't remember.</br>  <br>I don't think anyone else knows about it, and there are only a few arrows out there.</br>  <br> his stand over and over again with the Arrow to give themselves an ultimate stand? <br><br>thats because the arrow chooses when it happens.</br></br></br>  <br>*Am<br>also, Jonathan is great at melee combos, though his range game isnt all that great other then Sendo, which still takes a while to cover good distance, and Luck and Pluck</br></br>  <br>Not with Hol Horse's long fucking arms he's not. Hol Horse can grab a bitch from next week.</br>  <br><br>In the Born This Way chapters.<br><br><br>No, because there was no such thing yet.

They had to put up with Iggy.</br></br></br>  <br>No, because apparently he's slower.<br><br><br>I dunno.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've been trying to get better with Joseph, Jotaro and Josuke <br>But still use Johnny and Jo2uke the most</br></br>  <br> Can KQ get in rush mode?? <br>No, I tried this with both KQ and Whitesnake who do have Rush attacks but when they clash with ORA that they parry off of it. It's stupid cause both stands can Spar with Punch Ghosts.</br></br>  <br>Fuck finally I can post again!<br>Are you the type of people who just sped through the manga when the sc anime came on, and ignored all the extra details?<br>Because if you look at the manga covers Valentine's posture and weight actually does slowly change, meaning that he probably was working out the whole time</br></br></br>  <br>Remember when Kira was surprised by how fast Star Platinum was, even though its speed is standard for Stands that can rush?</br>  <br>To make the reader think any of them were the back up.<br>Similar of why the crusaders were laughing at the Sun.</br></br>  <br>But even so KQ has stood it's ground against Crazy Diamond and Whitesnake could rush against Stone Free in the manga. They have Jonathan being able to punch away bullets in rush mode.</br>  <br>Shouldn't Echoes Act 3 rush as well?</br>  <br>It has a rush move. But I think it's in the same class with KQ and whitesnake.</br>  how do I make friends?  <br>He never saw any stands before that point except for harvest and atom heart father</br>  <br>by showing off those quads<br><br>also leave 4chan</br></br></br>  <br> Ill be ur friend anon </br>  <br>[Gravity]</br>  <br>With those quads...<br><br><br>Also question.<br>Why were pucci's knives a big deal if stone free was shown to be just as fast as star platinum, and both stopped a bullet and redirected a volley of them early on in part 6</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>『GRAVITY』</br>  <br>Jotaro was a well regarded knife punching expert   didn't you read part 3  </br>  <br>The knives where thrown during Made in Heaven so they were also sped up. Jolyne wouldn't have been fast enough.</br>  <br>Because Pucci was speeding up time for non-living things and they'd be going really fucking fast once time stop ended.</br>  <br>Get quads.</br>  <br>Jotaro paternal instincts kicked at the worst moment possible.</br>  <br>But doesn't made in heaven effect only nonliving objects. At the time wasn't the sun a spinning disc in the sky, which implied years were passing in milliseconds. If this is the case shouldn't the knives rust away before they even hit her?</br>  <br> Araki logic <br>he'd give an excuse like "since Pucci had touched the knives recently they were still considered part of him" or less likely, "Pucci blessed the knives", or "SUTANDO POWAH"</br></br>  <br><br>okay sounds good let's meet up somewhere and have a cool party</br></br>  <br>Because fuck you that's why.</br>  <br>F U C K<br>U<br>C<br>K<br><br>Y O U<br>O<br>U</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would the knives rust that fast at that point? The sun didn't start doing that until after Pucci killed everyone. But still, it;s Araki.</br>  <br>I'm just fucking with you guys, there's a lot of shit that doesn't make since in this series and they honestly make everything better</br>  <br>Im down, we can talk about jojo and jerk off to femdio</br>  <br>  Araki loves you Spiggy  </br>  <br>Years is an exaggeration, time wasn't going that fast until after Gay Priest had killed Jolyne and friends.</br>  any news on part 4?  <br> Wanting friends </br>  Anybody have any good non pucci Jojo reaction images, mine are a~~~~~ll gone  dear jojofags, can you please fucking kill all of your secondaries than insist on plugging epic jojo references into everything and derailing thread discussions on other boards? thanks.<br><br>sincerely, a loser fag that's mad on the internet</br></br>  <br>Post those threads.</br>  <br>Post Links.</br>  <br>Yeah we'll take care of them for ya</br>  <br>I do it to cuhrayzee game general every now and then, its fun</br>  <br> good non pucci Jojo reaction images <br> non Pucci <br>Fuck, my jojo reaction Folder is so small compared to my Gay Priest folder.</br></br></br>  <br>That's like blaming /mlp/ every time some uses a horse pic to derail a thread</br>  <br>You're slacking.</br>  <br><br>I'd rather not further derail discussion in this thread or the others, sorry, but you guys wouldn't have to look far.</br></br>  <br><br>the parts in jojo I like the most are when the main gang are talking to each other about the enemy stand</br></br>  <br> fuck off spooky </br>  <br> ask us for help <br> tell us to find it <br>fuck off</br></br></br>  <br>Wamuu, Kosaku, and DIO mostly.</br>  <br>I know but, people keep making more Pucci's now that I have to collect.</br>  Is Carera Kars or Yukako?  <br> You just made it worse. Now anons will go out to try an find those threads and will fill them with Gay Priest. </br>  <br>Neither as far as we know. Just a passing reference.<br><br><br>Before Pucci became big, we had lots of Speedwagons and the usual Dios.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Neither she's her own person<br><br>btw what do you do named citizen</br></br></br>  <br>I really want to know what about Cars you see in Karera.</br>  <br>the first 3 letters</br>  <br>Its probably just me, but when I was reading through SBR I thought Hot Pants was Pucci's counterpart</br>  <br> Before Pucci became big, we had lots of Speedwagons and the usual Dios. <br>Those aren't posted as often now since Gay Priest took over. I'd have to go to the archive and look them up.</br></br>  <br>That was fucking awful. Someone posted that stupid meme in a thread about stuff that happens only in anime and not in real life just because OP's picture was of Giorno..</br>  <br>well, it was more to address any people in this thread that do this shit, rather than actually derail discussion even worse. i know only jojofags aren't guilty of it, but it's been pretty prominent lately.<br><br>  have the colored scans been translated yet? </br></br></br>  <br>no idea check paste bin. The only chapter that's fully in color is part 6 i believe</br>  <br> OP's picture was of Giorno.. <br>This is how it always is. As soon as Jojo is mentioned in any thread on any board.<br> THIS JOJO THREAD NOW </br></br></br>  <br>theres a fuckton of Pucci</br>  <br> Someone <br>I will shamelessly admit that that was my doing.</br></br>  <br>She's Pucci if he took responsibility for his actions but is unable to carry the burden of them.<br><br><br>Even though the thread derailed into talking about Japan's backwards ass culture and something about Clapistan.</br></br></br></br>  <br>;^^^^^^) <br>I meme and make terrible videos,<br>I only use this trip if other people do, or if I want to mess with the mods on non-blue boards</br></br></br>  <br> Both join the church due to guilt over causing their siblings' death. <br> Both end up hanging out with a Dio. <br> Both are A+ waifu material. </br></br></br>  <br>More importantly<br> both are bad memes </br></br>  <br>People get a little overenthusiastic. <br><br> And also most people hate coming to this shitty board as well, so they take any excuse they can to talk about anime on other boards.  <br><br>Can you blame them?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fucking nice</br>  <br>got a youtube channel of those terrible videos?</br>  <br> bad memes <br> Gay Priest <br> Bad </br></br></br>    <br>I think a better word is forced.</br>  <br>Yeah but they're really badly done because I am inept about using Vegas pro, and the one video I had that was "decent" was done infinetely better by someone else</br>  <br> forced <br>Yup. It fits, and just so happens anons are accepting it and spreading it.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Jojo is such a plot hole filled manga, the fans can't even decide what happened. And it is such a straight forward story. How can such a simplistic story have so many plot holes?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's Jotaro's combos in a nutshell</br>  <br>Yes I can blame them. This general is fine and even then, there's an infinite number of other places you can discuss it on the internet without further increasing people's hate for you.</br>  <br>Araki has memory problems along with working on a weekly manga at the time.</br>  <br>cuz araki does what araki wants, common sense be damned</br>  <br> simplistic story <br>That jumbled mess is not simple.</br></br>  I hope you memers will at least buy Gay Priest's figure.  <br>Araki is 2000 years old man, he bound to forget things when he doesn't get fresh virgin blood</br>  <br>Jojolion is the only complex one so far, sometimes the fights can be a mess, or the fighting can be confusing, but the story is always simple.</br>  <br>The complexity of Part 6's story along with all the confusing bizarre crap that happens near the end may have been the reason why it had low sales at the time.</br>  Post your Best boys.  <br>Part 6 could have been GOAT if they just changed a few things</br>  <br> This general is fine <br>lmao i think gay fucking priest would like a word with you</br></br>  <br>I don't have any pictures of Kira, Wekapipo, or Aishou</br>  <br> Kira <br>Step it up.</br></br>  <br> Kira, Wekapipo, or Aishou <br>These boys are indeed best.</br></br>    Gay priest is a shitty meme. He's not even GAY    <br> He's not even GAY </br>  <br>Hah! You can't fool me<br><br><br>what the fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br> Gay priest <br> not even GAY </br></br>  <br>How would that even work?</br>    If you met Cameo and wished to fight DIO, would the resultant DIO-golem be able to stop time?  <br>Avdol's golem didn't seem to have his Stand or his fire powers so no.</br>  <br>Hol Horse didn't know dio's power,so there's no way cameo would do anything like that</br>  Why does Gay Priest swim here?  <br><br>Motherfucking Bruno.<br><br>ARRIVEDERCI~</br></br></br></br>  <br> not gay <br>Then explain this shit.</br></br>  <br>Pucci isn't wanting it in that picture, which questions your logic.  Also, edit. </br>  <br>Well someone ignored what I said here </br>  <br>ARIARIARIARIARIARI ARRIVEDERCI!<br><br>God, I love that.</br></br></br>    <br>Pic related</br>  <br>Explain this then.</br>  <br>god damn it, now I need to add another thing to my Pucci_ folder</br>    <br> opting for your crotch to be facing the other guy <br>Bretty gay/10</br></br>  <br>That's just Johnny and Gyro at a costume party</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Explain this then.</br>  <br>Now if we're talking about homosexicals THOSE two are the suspicious ones.</br>  <br>How the fuck else are you supposed to carry someone in that position? You realize if he had both his legs wrapped around an arm, facing away, he'd still be like a really gay koala.</br>  <br>That's just Illuso trying to save Pucci</br>  Can someone actually explain this?  <br>He's that autistic.</br>  <br>same everytrthing</br>  <br>Given what was shown in canon they'd be bi at the most</br>  <br>You honestly can't deny even this?</br>  <br>But why is that relevant enough for two pages other than Pucci's autism?</br>  <br>Bisexicals, homosekshulls, either way they touched balls a lot</br>  <br>It's funny how there's more art of Johnny and Gyro together than those two together.</br>  <br>Enough, you have angered the bus, anon</br>  <br>Pucci and DIO's love is pure.

But Gay Priest is top meme. You can still stop by sometimes.</br>    <br>Bus is flying to heaven</br>  <br>Not even. I've slowly stopped reading these threads more and more for a few weeks now. I'm not engaged at all, I have it open in a tab and just switch over it and scroll to the bottom.</br>  <br> I'm just going to take a break for a month or two <br>You should just lurk threads or start a conversation about a topic that hasn't already been discussed. These memes are just taking the place of non-existent discussions.</br></br>  <br>Same. I'll come back when there's a new chapter or more EoH news.</br>  This isn't over  <br>So long.<br>You were a short lived but inspirational meme.</br></br>  Reminder, Johnny created the wall eyes with the [spin] from Tusk 4. It's eternally chasing the people who killed him.<br><br>Infinite Tusks will kill the final villain of part 8.</br></br>  <br>I'm interested in what you're saying. Explain more.</br>  <br>Just kidding gg<br>To be continued</br></br>  <br>Jobin being a bus was always a meme when the chapter came out, this stupid trip cancer just crashed it to the ground.<br><br>and he fully knows what he's trying to do.</br></br></br>  <br>When Johnny died his spin went beneath a leaf.</br>  HOTPANTS<br>O<br>T<br>P<br>A<br>N<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I already do lurk the threads and just don't find much interesting to talk about or start a topic about. Last thing I actually talked about was the EoH demo and the HFtF tournament</br>    <br>Can you post an image. I never noticed and I don't remember what chapter that happened on.</br>  <br>bye, now as I'm  I have buisness to attend to</br>  <br>Johnny did the earthquake?</br>  <br>Don't worry, anon. Gay Priest shall retire for the night. You did your job.<br><br>Gay Priest has left the thread now.</br></br></br>  DP has decided to make an adaptation of Baoh before Diamond Is not Crash<br>How do you take this news?</br>  <br>good bye Gay Priest</br>  <br>Is Baod a good read? I've seen a little of the OVA and it looks cool.</br>  <br>I'm fine with it if it's just an OVA</br>  <br> I haven't read it, was gonna start tomorrow </br>  <br>Ah, that's cool. I might check it out too.</br>  <br>i'd be beyond hype</br>  <br>never seen Baoh</br>  Do you think Araki is upset slightly that Boah didn't sell well?  I bet he mains Boah in ASB because of the pain   Why does iggy's appearance suddenly change in crusaders?  <br>cause it changed in the manga.<br><br>Araki didnt like his design.</br></br></br>  when will we get part 4 animated ?  <br>When did part 3 anime end?</br>  <br>Eh. To me Scary Monsters was just to give Dio as much of his aztec vampiric ability without rehashing the actual vampirism.<br><br>Still how Araki handled Diego at the end made me disappointed. I think it would have been more satisfying if Diego killed the president (at least deal the finishing blow after Johnny leaves Funny in his eternal hell). Then somehow releases Scary Monsters which reveals his actual Stand to be The World. Afterward he'd go try to kick Johnny's ass in attempt to take over the world through gradually gaining higher and higher political power.</br></br></br>  <br>'Gay Moot is Here now' when?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=N0W<wbr>9kg9ElUk</wbr>  [ ]</br>   the conception of a lifelong Stand User is preceded by a microscopic Stand battle in their mother's vagina involving hundreds of millions of combatants, the winner of which becomes the zygote <br><br>Discuss</br></br>  <br>That's literally that one scene from the shitty Mask sequel.</br>  <br><br>But, ya know, not shit because JoJo.</br></br>  <br>filthy acts at a reasonable price</br>  Sex Pistols!  <br>Posting superior gun stand user</br>  <br>Well, I have no comeback to that, at least I didn't get Quad 4s, so that's a relief.</br>  <br>Of course you dont have a comeback, you posted the inferior gun Stand</br>  <br>Sex Pistols has a better range I believe, place one some place in wait, shoot a small projectile towards it, it ricochets it towards the target</br>  <br> you posted the inferior gun Stand <br>Each Stand has their benefits, Hang on, didn't you shoot yourself in the face?<br><br> Pls no avatarfagging. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I wont avatar fag, but he only shot himself because of his broken watch</br>  <br>But hey,at least Thoths prediction was correct, again.</br>  <br> BtD <br>Broadway to Dio?</br></br>  What did Pucci think of Vanilla Ice?  <br>He probably thought he was pretty  cool </br>  <br>n ice  pun</br>  <br>So THAT'S why Whitesnake looks like Cream, they had a Threeway.</br>  How popular was the Stardust crusaders anime in japan and do you think we will get a Diamond is unbreakable anime?  <br> do you think we will get a Diamond is unbreakable anime? <br>Diamond is Not Airing  ever </br></br>  Sex Pistols is just Harvest with only 6 guys. It only seems good because Araki wrote Mista to actually use his powers in a useful way.  <br> Whitesnake looks like Cream <br>Since when do dna bondage gimps resemble spooky scary skeletons?</br></br>  <br>Well they have similar color schemes and their users were both gay for DIO.</br>   anime about lewd rebels fighting ultra-prude society <br> sex scene comes up <br> censored nipples <br><br>Fucking elevens....</br></br></br></br>  BDs  Isn't that part of the joke?  Also why is that complete and utter faggot of a beta OP friggin out when the girl whose cock he's been craving since the start comes in to rape him. <br><br> mfw I watch the millionth beta haremlord stay a permavirgin </br></br>  <br>Wait for Hiryuu or buy the BDs.</br>  <br>The first three Hiryuu episodes have been censored too.</br>   watching Funishit   <br>trips confirm truth. his father would be ashamed of him. two hot senpai that want his dong, yet he just fuckin whines/freaks out about it</br>  <br>He loves her pureness. Not her lewdness. He wants to hold hands and cuddle. Not jam it in.</br>  <br>Still no nipples in the uncensored version</br>  <br> HorribleSubs <br> watching the censored version </br></br>  <br>hey at least its not light rays</br>  <br>light rays would be even better because it's a guarantee that nipples will be added in the BDs<br><br>Like this, we don't know since it's JC Staff</br></br></br>  <br> because it's a guarantee that nipples will be added in the BDs <br><br>Cross Ange says hi</br></br></br>  <br><br>Am I the only one who thinks Anna's body is shit?<br><br>She's a real fatty.</br></br></br></br>  <br>well almost always. The idea obviously being that you have to cover something which you can't show on TV</br>  <br>Too be fair, she's kinda covering her nipples with her arms in this shot.</br>  <br>She's fat in all the right places</br>  <br>She's no Kajou, I'll give you that.</br>  <br>skin and bones aint hot man</br>  <br>no, she has the 0.7 hip to waist ratio. fat women cannot and absolutely not have such a ratio. even fit women cannot have 0.7 unless the women has enough estrogen in her body.<br><br>0.7 is unachievable unless the women is slender and has massive amount of estrogen which is highly attractive to men. women with 0.7 ratios also tends to have really nice looking asses too</br></br></br>   Anna: lewd <br> Sophia: pure <br><br>??</br></br></br>  <br>also her boobs are not completely round (indicating fakeness which i find it completely unattractive) it droops a tiny but firm full and round on the bottom indicating youth and firtility</br>  <br>that's how it usually works anon</br>  <br>like mother like daughter. for some reason ive thought she would be a bigger slut than anna just by her eyes even before episode 4</br>  <br><br><br>yes<br><br>i like this</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a show about censorship. What the fuck did you expect.<br><br>In the uncensored version there are no nipples, btw.</br></br></br>    <br>i wonder if there are editors that can work with animations. there are tons of really good editors at 420chan because the site apparently doesnt give a shit about dmca</br>  <br>you are right.</br>  <br><br>Why is there urine on Anna's pantsu?</br></br>  <br>Nope, it's anime vaginal fluids</br>  <br>She's obviously soaked.</br>  <br> Urine </br>  <br>tears of joy</br>  <br> walked home gently.webm <br>Noice</br></br>  <br> those addled moans she was making <br><br>fuck that was hot</br></br></br>  <br><br>Am I the only one who thinks this is gross?<br><br>If you had sex with Anna, you'd end up with viscous vaginal juices all over your balls. How gross is that?</br></br></br></br>    <br> you'd end up with viscous vaginal juices all over your balls </br>  <br> cute 2D leaking from pure cocklust is gross  <br>Maybe Free! is more your style Anon.</br></br>  <br>Face in that scene reminds me a bit of Asanagi.</br>  So what's the difference between Hiryuu and HS? Same subs but no censorship on the former, or what?  <br><br><br><br> implying vagina is placed between the legs <br> implying vaginal fluids exist <br> implying vaginas exist outside of anime <br><br>literally what?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Committee for Public Decency and Morals pls</br>  Can't wait for the next episode.    <br> anna will never bake you vaginafluid-flavored cookies <br>why live</br></br>        I hope the show gives us a good reason as to why MC will be denying his crush's advances after this. I know she pretty much tried to rape him, but he kinda left a note telling her to come in and that he liked her too. <br><br>I mean, it's pretty obvious that he's going to not take advantage of her newfound desire for him but i at least hope for a good excuse.</br></br>  Is the LN getting translated at all?  <br><br><br>I'll buy the LN just for the pictures.<br><br>All I wanna know if someone fugs eventually</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I_Can_Only_Get_So_Erect.webm</br>  <br>But he likes Kajo and she confesses later</br>  <br>Anon that is way later, right now there's 0 romance development between him and Kajo aside from then working together, which is under blackmail from Kajo.</br>  <br> But who I was trying to protect <br>Episode 3. He didn't knew if he went for Anna or Kajo.</br></br>    I'm trying to figure out something. In the LN, Kajo confession was all of the sudden or did she like him before?  <br>They were both being assaulted tough, also that's not really romance development.</br>  <br>Not sudden.</br>  <br>bitch is fucking insane</br>  <br>The best part is that she thinks there's nothing lewd in her actions from assaulting MC and having her way with him.<br><br> Enforces fight on lewd to get MC to love her more <br> Is completely ignorant to her feelings and gushes out love juice all over the place <br> No clue what actualy lewd is but instictively goes for the MC dick and desires it without even knowing it was a thing <br><br>I'm hoping for a lot of entertaining scenes from her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When did she started to like him? Did he do something or what?<br><br>I already put my dick on crazy before. No regrets. I would an Anna million times, but I would trade it for 1 night with Kajo.</br></br></br>  <br>Funny aside. This is a nice critique to the stupid censorship laws in Japan.</br>  <br>Not the LN fag, but i'm guessing it a gradual thing, and the time they spend together ends up making both develop feelings for each other.<br><br>Apparently the confession happened in the latest release of the LN.</br></br></br>   hi i am a girl who mentioned penises and vaginas in conversation every fucking second i get, i also mock the MC about sexual content. However, when i see a penis in real life i freak out because i am still a child in heart  <br> hi i am a super pervy MC who knows about sex and shit in a world where noone knows anything. I have a crush fro over 10 years on one girl and when she tries to fuck me i go into shock because at heart i am a little child <br>Is this a metaphor for japanese being children in their hearts?</br></br>  <br> At heart i am a little child <br><br>I think he's secretly a perv, every time he was doing something "wrong" he questioned himself as to why it felt so good. He's in denial.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I cry everytime the MC in a harem turns out to be a beta faggot fuck who never does anything but sperg out when the girls want to have sex<br><br>Fucking nips need to stop this shit</br></br></br>  <br> As she sits on top of you, her labia wraps around your balls. <br> Your balls feel all warm and gooey as the soft lips dripping with love juice massage you <br> She begins to unconsciounsly move, craving your dick, and your balls are completely lathered in love juice <br> You see a fleeting image of Newton shaking his head as her pink pussy breaks the force laws and gobbles up your balls. </br></br></br></br>  <br>nah he didn't want to fuck her, he wants to make tenderly love to her</br>  <br><br>can you fuck off</br></br>  <br>Sometimes I want to be a virgin again, so that I may experience such pure innocence.</br>  <br>kill urself my man</br>  <br>Don't bother, that anon has massive amounts of estrogen in his own body.</br>  <br><br>I will never comprehend LN writers.</br></br>  <br>Your virgin is showing</br>   in love with a girl <br> she literally throws herself naked and dripping wet onto your dick <br> you sperg out <br><br>I fucking hate this shit. Akatsuki Ousawa 2.0 fucking when?</br></br></br></br>  When you are about to talk shit about MC, think on this: At least he's not this guy.  <br>fucking virgin</br>  <br> Kajo I've spent a lot of time together with you now and I find your never ending torrent of penis and vagina jokes to be irresistible.  <br> I also find your fear of actual intimate situations to be very sexy and I look forward to having to work my ass to even get a kiss out of you. </br></br>  <br>Read this </br>  Shimoneta is done. Four months from now, all /a/ will remember is the Anna scene. It's all downhill from here.  <br><br>Unless you reject the pussy, you will never get pussy. That's how karma works. The pure and dense are blessed with harems and sluts.</br></br>  <br>Kill all LN writers</br>  <br>Can you blame us? I've already fapped twice to that<br>Shit's hot</br></br>  wait<br><br>so there are all these groups who just rip the official subs<br><br>but none of them are bothering to put them on the uncensored version?</br></br></br></br>  Serious question, why do people like this shit?  Explain this guy  <br>its another penis joke xD</br>    <br>benis</br>  I did my part, dropped it at episode 3  <br>what a gaylord</br>  <br>Well, Anna is actually lewd.<br><br>Kajo's all bark and no bite.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Its fun, you wouldnt understand.</br></br>  <br>There's still the cookie scene.</br>    <br>This guy has a legit reason to do it. Or did you not watch the show?</br>  <br>because the show finally has some character development. anna is pretty unpredictable atm and unpredictability is fun</br>  <br>If I wanted to watch a bunch of annoying sluts do stupid shit with a boring beta faggot I'd walk outside.</br>  I bet you can't watch this picture without listening that lewd scream inside your head.  <br>She's so cute</br>  <br><br>good taste my brethens</br></br>  Is the lightnovel not up on baka tsuki?<br>Is it even translated?</br>  <br>Nobody was picking up translations on this or the manga, manga only has 3 chapters translated in english.<br><br>Anime will probably get some interested in translating tough.</br></br></br>  Just think on how Takunichi feels. He has to work with this bitch that saw his penis and is also black mailing him. Just like what my ex did to me, poor guy.  <br>Keep telling yourself that</br>  <br>That's what people said with Chaika and look where that went</br>  <br> Just like what my ex did to me </br>  <br>WHAT EVEN IS THE POINT?!?!<br>THE CENSORING MADE ME BELIEVE THERE WAS SOMETHING TO BE CENSORED<br>DID THEY THINK ELBOWS ARE 2LEWD4ME?!?!</br></br></br>  <br>actually i think with a little push kajo would tumble down the abyss just like anna. <br><br>anna kind of fell into the abyss by herself by accident</br></br></br>  <br>Why though, are you a kissless virgin who never had a girlfriend?</br>  <br>Yes I am<br>And I don't give a single shit about it, you can fuck off back to tumblr now.</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry I didn't know this was in the KLK universe.</br>  <br>This is /a/, not your blog.</br>  I know that Anna is overflowing with feelings that are tottaly new to her, but how the fuck did she not find it creepy to be playing stalker when she was scared shitless from it one episode ago?   it's explicitly set up that the MC admires her for her purity and kindness, and wants to avoid lewdness <br> she stalks him, pushes him down then secretes all over him <br> WOW WHAT A FAG WHY ISNT HE INTO IT HOMO IM SICK OF GENERIC PROTAGS </br></br>  <br>Too far</br>  <br>He hardly did any blogging tough, it was mostly a comparison. Why does everyone here seems to get super triggered when someone implies they had a girlfriend?</br>  <br> He loves her pureness. Not her lewdness. He wants to hold hands and cuddle. Not jam it in. <br>And the elevens wonder why their birth rates are dropping. Fucking morons.</br></br>  <br> Always questioning why he feels so good from doing dirty stuff <br> Is tottaly aware that it's not a super fucking wrong thing <br> Understands that society is being super fucking dumb and ignorant about lewd <br> Glasses keeps pointing out that he's in denial about not wanting to do lewd with Anna </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't care how much you like pure girls, you'd have to be the fucking pope to resist tapping. The only reason he didn't fuck her was cause Ayame walked in on them.</br></br>  <br>That 'comparison' was unnecessary, fuck off with him.</br>  <br> the Pope  <br>There's a whole Wikipedia page dedicated to SSDs who died banging.</br></br>  <br>Because those poor souls haven't accepted that 2D is superior.<br>Or that's what I like to tell myself when I get really lonely.</br></br>  <br>How can she be pure if she's had a child</br>  <br>He also wasn't completely sure it was Anna because it was dark, she would be the last person he'd think was stradling him.</br>  <br>Like the saying goes when choosing women:<br>Pretty, smart, sane - Pock TWO</br></br>  <br>If Ayame hadnt come he'd have given in to his urges. Not like he could fight back anyway against her</br>  <br>Nice dubs, and this anon speaks truth.</br>  I wonder if this will get animated  <br>He quickly recognized her voice.</br>  <br>Who is that?</br>  <br>He's in the OP, so yes</br>  <br> Implying nipples at all <br>You faggots didnt learn from cross ange at all, did you?</br></br>  <br>Hence why i said "not completely sure", he never tried to call out by name, so he only had an idea that it was her.</br>  <br>cross ange wasn't animated by J.C Staff what are you on about?</br>    <br> fag <br><br>And dropped.</br></br></br>  <br>hahahahahaha, yours is censored!<br>raws = best</br></br>  In what volume of the LN does Anna go hulk on Tanuki's chastity belt?  <br>those are censored too<br><br>also <br><br> vlc </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why does his collar and bracelets look like tin foil?</br></br>  <br> vlc </br>  <br><br> he doesn't know the pleasure of sticking it in another man </br></br>  <br>How long would it have taken her to figure out that penis goes in vagina?</br>  Are we all really ignore that Kajo got NTRd?<br><br>I thought we all loved Kajo? I thought Kajo &gt;&gt; Anna.</br></br>  <br>Considering she was feeling a burning hot sensation in her crotch which corresponded to her finding his dick, not very long.</br>  <br>a couple of minutes most likely, she was already grinding it</br>  <br>They don't have any development with each other so far aside from mutual help, so it's not like it means anything yet. Also there was no actualy sex.</br>  <br> No nipples <br>It looks even worse than with censoring.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't take animals very long to figure it out.</br>  So... is Anna still pure or is she a slut?  <br> They're fakes </br>  <br>Does anyone know why she is going ape on his chastity belt?<br><br>I am going thinking that Anna will realize she is not actually in love with him and will stop being so nuts over him. I am sure she will take it fine once Kajou confesses.</br></br></br>  Why dosn't Tanuki just explain to science girl in code where babies come from? Is he just afraid that she'll try to get a real example too?  <br> Is he just afraid that she'll try to get a real example too? <br>yes</br></br>  <br> She will take it fine </br>  <br> she will take it fine once Kajou confesses <br>Delusional.</br></br>  <br> This thing between your legs made me feel good and made that place on my abdomen feel hot <br> stupid chastity belt is in the way <br><br>Geez i don't know.<br><br> She confesses to him later actually, telling him he's the most important person in the world for her. And no, she dosn't take it well. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pure slut.</br>  <br>So she does go full yandere. To boot she's also super strong, that is fucking dangerous.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br><br>why does kajo look so nervous?</br></br>  <br>It looks like there's a knife pointing at her throat, do the math.</br>  <br><br>Anna isn't the kind of girl to hold knives to people's throat. That could be anything.</br></br>  <br>I don't read scribbles.<br><br><br>Damn, how is he going to lose her if she actually thinks she loves him?<br><br><br>Don't tell me she is possessive.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really love this "love juices are gross" meme.<br>It never fails to make me laugh.<br>No irony intended.</br></br></br>  <br>This would be a great reaction image without the fucking runes.</br>  <br> For some reason i get really angry when i see you get so close to my honey <br> I don't like this feeling so can you please refrain from that <br> She sees her near him again <br><br>There's plenty of ways this could be happening, and Kajo DID warn him that if he snaps there's no telling what she can do.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If she snaps i meant to say.</br>  Is the fact that Okuma told Saotome that he loved Kajou going to be a factor in the future?  <br>Artist girl may try to push both into situations, who knows. I think she's most concerned with drawing lewd to really care about that now.</br>  <br>I'm confused, did he actually put it in or not?</br>  <br>I want to  pull her pigtails </br>  <br><br><br>I don't know if I'm being baited or not</br></br></br>  <br>how can one cut wire net/fence with a knife?</br>  <br>No, she just grinded him and kissed, Ayame got in just before it could get any further.</br>  <br>it's an anime only thing, it doesn't exist</br>  <br>Did you see what she did to that metal door in episode 2? I don't think the fence was much of a challenge for her.</br>  <br>Is she mad that Kajou was at his place that late at night?</br>  <br>As long as it doesn't taste funny, that would be the worst.</br>  <br><br>I never realized before how hot the prospect of yandere getting NTR'd was.</br></br>  <br>You'd probably die right afterwards tough.</br>  <br>Doesn't taste like much at all honestly. <br> Don't go all REEEEE on me now, I'm not a normie I'm a grill </br></br>  <br> If I remember correctly she put scissors against Kajou's neck because of that and because she was calling him Tanukichi. </br>  <br> I'm a grill <br>This just begs even more questions.</br></br>  <br>What is the point of the censorship again? Is it just for jap tv?</br>  <br>Dang, if she did that to her best friend due to jealousy i wonder what she'd do against glasses girl if she saw how desperate for his cock she was too.</br>  <br>Come on now,we've all swallowed our own semen.</br>  <br>I'm not talking about Shimon, I'm talking about harem MCs in general</br>  <br> not liking waterfalls of love </br>  <br>Why would the latter bother her?</br>  Would you join SOX or your country equivalent if you country tried to eliminate lewd?  <br>Allahu Akbar</br>  <br>It's like poetry.</br>  <br>No it would be too dangerous but I would be very angry.</br>  <br>You call yourself a man?</br>  <br>The one who's NTRed is the one who is stolen, you triple nigger.</br>  I have a question /a/. How do you know whether they are reading 2d or 3d porn? Are the girls on the cards drawings or actual real living girls from the show?  <br><br>They would never be able to do that in America as long as we have our guns. Shit would end like Waco.<br><br>Unless, of course, our guns get taken away like the state would loooooove to do.</br></br></br></br>   Anna won't win <br><br>This hurts the most</br></br>  <br>I would kill to protect my H-mangos. I already have a pile of guns and body armor.</br>  <br>I would be very angry though and maybe whine about it on 4chan if that was still around (it won't).</br>  <br>How so? It was just to clarify that I'm not boasting about eating pussy or whatever. <br><br><br>There's two broadcasts, one less censored than the other.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kajo's better, anyway.<br><br><br>That's his first name.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You are like the personification of the united nations. Always angry, but does shit al.</br>  <br>You pussy<br><br>Every real man would join and fight the brave fight.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I'd just leave.</br>  <br>Fucking virgin I swear.</br>  <br>Then what, did you just sploosh into a cub and taste it?</br>    <br>Would you bake it into cookies to give to someone you love?</br>  <br> a person has b-type, submissive personality traits <br> every protag is that person <br> OH MY GOD CAN WE PLEASE STOP THIS IS BEEN ALMOST 30 YEARS SINCE TENCHI <br> guys why are you complaining, hes a beta faggot with b-type personality what did you expect? <br>Are you fucking retarded or something?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That's his first name. <br>so?</br></br>  <br>So why Anna dislike it if a girl that is sorta close to him called him by his first name?</br>  My dick is already diamonds.  <br>Who's subbing the uncensored version?</br>  <br>In Japan adressing someone by their first name is usually reserved for extremely closed people like family, or a lover.</br>  <br> sploosh into a cub  <br>I have absolutely no idea what that means. <br>Don't guys taste themselves out of curiosity or something? I thought that's kinda normal. <br><br>Anyway. Why is science-chan so cute anons? <br><br><br>Unfortunately I would understand the implications so I guess not. Ignorance is bliss huh.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> non-virgin </br></br>  <br>Hiryuu</br>  <br>Nice reverse troll, normalfag.</br>  <br>Hiryuu or some group that takes the uncensored raws and slaps HS on them. Hiryuu a best though.</br>  <br>She's crazy, obsessive, and doesn't even understand what she's doing. This isn't some super beta move on his part - most people would be freaked out.<br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br> Anyway. Why is science-chan so cute anons? <br>Not even the cutest</br></br>  <br>Kajou is Anna's r friend. Why would it bother her if she gets close to a fellow STUCO member?</br>  <br>I don't think many guys do that no</br>  <br>kajo confesses or anna confesses?</br>  <br> yuri more-or-less loli  <br>I don't know man. <br><br><br>I don't believe you. <br>You guys seriously never tried? What the hell you're shattering my worldview Anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You end up with viscous vaginal juices from your balls all the way up your butt crack basically every time you have sex, especially if she gets on top, especially if you have sex for long enough  especially if she's turned on enough </br>  <br>Both.</br>  <br> Not tasting your semen <br> Being a fag </br></br>  <br>Like i said, adressing someone by first name there, is reserved for real close people, friends could do it, but it's not common.<br><br>I don't think that getting close to Tanuki as friends is what's bothering her, is why she was at his house late at night + first name adressing.</br></br></br>  <br>God I want to fuck the smug out of her</br>    <br>Does she even understand the implications of being at his house at night?</br>  <br>Most guys do, but won't even admit it on an anonymous imageboard.</br>  <br>Well, maybe they're lovers. Anna shouldn't be bothered by that. Since Kajou Is her friend she should leave them be rather than stick a sharp object at her throat.</br>  <br>I think it's more of a "it makes me mad for some reason, so please don't do that anymore".</br>  <br><br>Thank goodness, I was a bit surprised just now.</br></br>  <br> I feel mysteriously annoyed when I see you doing a thing, so I'll threaten you with a knife </br>  <br>real snail trail<br><br><br>You can see her linea alba, she can't be fat<br> &gt;he doesn't know the pleasure of a soft but not podgy woman </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder what would happen if you did<br><br>Would she want to start testing the fetishes she's seen in the porn?</br></br></br>  <br>BIG</br>  <br>I'm just guessing anon. Also you do remenber that Kajou specifically told Tanuki that if she gets mad nobody can predict what she'll do? It's probably that.</br>  <br>The Funi version didn't censor this part either.</br>  <br>yes it did</br>  <br>I'd probably fail and just make her smugger.</br>  <br>underrated</br>  <br>Nah she's all talk no action.</br>  <br> you will never suck Kajou's dick while she grins at you <br>Why even go on.</br></br>  <br>she'd be all up for action once broken in</br>  <br>You're right, I missed the drool.</br>  <br>Loved her reaction to the whole "backdoor" thing.</br>  <br> not knowing man asspussy feels better than lady asspussy </br>   people unironically want to consume Anna's vaginal mucus cookies <br><br>Pathetic.</br></br>  <br>?<br><br>I don't remember that at all.</br></br></br>  <br> calling boipussy asspussy  <br>I'd post a pic of Rimbaud frowning but I'm on my tablet.</br></br>  <br>Well, I'm just curious as to how they taste myself.<br><br> If I saw hair in it I'd legitimately vomit. </br></br></br>  <br>BLACK</br>  <br> he doesn't have a body fluids fetish <br>the literal epitome of plebbiness<br><br><br>boipussy is shota exclusive</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When she tells him how he wants to put it in Anna's pussy and he's all "Oh no I don't" which she (purposefully I guess) misinterpreted as he wants to do anal.</br>  <br>SEAL</br>  <br> Calling it "cookies" <br>Now I want it more.</br></br>  <br>CLAWRS</br>  <br>ANALLY</br>  <br>Ah yeah just found that scene again.<br><br>Nice whenever an animu/mango caters to my anal fetish. Doesn't happen often enough at all.</br></br></br>  <br>This is why 2D is superior.</br>  <br><br>Anna<br><br>is <br><br>OBESE<br><br>Kajo, on the other hand, has perfect proportions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you actually this picky or are you just trying to keep the FAT meme going?</br>   girls taste themselves  <br>Ew.</br>  Anna is my waifu  <br><br><br>Yeah no, I'm fairly sure that's called being a faggot.</br></br></br>  <br> Watching Funimation rips, especially in 2015 <br> Using ellipses <br> Then complaining about the lack of nipples in TV shows <br>I don't understand how there are so many people complaining about this everywhere. Surely there can't be this many new people in here, right? Things like DxD and Okusama ga Seitokaichou are the exception nowadays, and we should be thankful for nipple-less doll bodies because they're able to give us full frontal nudity.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Agreed. Kajo was my old waifu, but now Anna wins by decision.</br></br>  <br><br> Watching Funimation rips, especially in 2015 <br>Not everyone wants to wait three days for Hiryuu.</br></br></br>  <br><br>?????</br></br>  <br>I'm , so not really a faggot. <br>Anyway I really doubt it's that weird.</br></br>  From all those licking actions, I can safely guess that Anna learn her 'loving gestures' from dogs  <br>You have the option of grabbing an ATX raw and using Senketsu's rips. No excuses.<br>You'll still end up with Funi's terrible dub script, though, but that's the price we have to pay if we want speed.</br></br>  <br><br>What's even worse than faggots is pretending to be a girl.</br></br>  <br>Can confirm - the only guy I've known who did this was extremely gay.</br>  <br>Wait I'm not gay though!</br>  <br> no girls in muh sekrit club  <br>Shit meme that should've died around the time /b/ stopped being interesting.</br></br>  <br><br> only guy he's known <br> himself <br><br><br><br> denial almost immediately <br><br>11/10 on the fag-o-meter</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So WHO THE ACTUAL FUCK IS ANNIE!<br><br>Is fuyukai desu?</br></br>  <br> browses /a/ <br> not gay <br><br>Soon you will be. The propaganda is all around us.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that mother fucking Takeda Hiromitsu?</br>  KAJO BEST GIRL  <br><br>At least it kind of makes sense in this setting, as sex is a big no-no and plenty of people are fucked-up because of the repressed genitality/sexuality.<br>MC being the typical LN MC who doesn't want to fuck is (kinda) justified as the country he's living in doesn't want young people to be lewd</br></br></br>   oy vey <br> do you want nipples dear otaku? <br> be a good goy, err I mean, good guy!, and buy our BDs <br> it only costs your monthly wage per disk! </br></br></br>  <br> implying america isn't already prude </br>  <br>seals have an actual bone in their penis. some of the bigger ones were hard enough to be used as clubs by a few native american tribes</br>  <br>of course <br>they're all still virgins</br></br>  <br> die via penis <br>The only way to put down a slut.</br></br>  kajo more pure than anna?  <br><br>Yes. Kajo, in fact, clearly doesn't want the dick; she's repulsed by the dick.<br><br>Anna has already had her hymen broken.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really no, they didn't have sex.</br>  <br>Can massive amounts of vaginal fluid break a girl's hymen?</br>  <br>Men literally shoot dick Mucus inside a girls vag and mouth and you cant stand vaginal mucus on your dick because you think it's gross. What do you think even lubricates the vagina in the first place you 13 year old.</br>  <br>I don't know for everyone else, but mine does that at least.</br>  <br>Is it painful every time it happens?</br>  <br>I'd guess Yuzuki N Dash who does the manga version</br>  <br><br><br>In another thread I did read another anon say that in the LN  after Kajo's confession Anna slaps her so hard to make her pass out, and later said she wanted to kill her but held back in the last moment. </br></br></br>  <br>We will be able to get it in the actual episode</br>  <br>Do you really think it would be unexpected from her?</br>  Why does Japan hate basic biological functions even more than Victorian England, they're not even Christian.  <br>I bet he wants to walk her home gently too</br>  <br>I'll take this over light beams any day.</br>  So is this going to devolve into some shitty romance plot where Okuma and Kajou end up together with some 'muh true love' shit?<br><br>Cause that's what it fucking feels like.</br></br>  <br> haha you all fell for the bait I was just pretending to be an ultra-faggot </br>  <br>Gaaaaaaaayy.</br>  <br>Yeah, I'm pretty sure it will... then again, it just might end with a harem since the whole point is to break the law... but most likely, he'll end up with Kajou</br>  <br>welcome to anime.</br>  <br>please leave</br>  <br>Of course it is. It's a fucking Light Novel.</br>  <br>No on my authority now they are going to have a total yandere ending with okuma ending up in anna's rape dungeon despite a long plot of so much struggle and heroism from the terrorists, doomed to fail. Anna will lead her school as before in the most Victorian manner despite having a sex slave.<br><br>That's better than the lame shit we were heading towards anyways.</br></br></br>  <br> LN <br> being comprised of anything but cliches <br>I'll probably forget about it once the anime is finished, so for now just enjoy the fun/lewd Anna moments while they last.</br></br></br>  <br>Because they imported our shitty Christian values after WWII.</br>  <br>A million hours in Paint.Net</br>  ME!ME!ME!

Is she as clueless as her daughter?</br>  <br>You lost me.</br>  <br>Her switch will flip as soon as she gets a dick inside of her.</br>  <br>But she must've had atleast one whole ponos inside of her to have created Anna.</br>  <br>Not necessarily.  She could have forced her husband to ejaculate, stored the semen, and injected it at a later time. Truly a beta, that one.  </br>  <br> implying the reason she's so gung ho on the prohibition of anything sexual isn't because making Anna turned her into the semenest of demons and this is the only way she can hold back. </br>  <br>That one has jpeg artifacting hell.</br>  lolihat  These stickers are kinda cute.  <br>Aww yeah look at that jpeg</br>  Mirror, mirror on the wall: Who's the purest of them all?  <br>So hey, how many times does the protag have sex in this series?

Unlike Hollywood, anime doesn't require billions of dollars to produce futuristic visual spectacle, surely its fresher and superior to creatively bankrupt LNs, and licensing must be dirt cheap because most classic sci-fi novels are 20+ years old and some are public domain at this point.  <br>Japan gets pretty stale with what it adapts as its sci-fi shows, which tend to be harem mech stuff. It sells, so they play it safe. The WOAH THATS CRAZY western sci-fi would be either a big hit or a big flop and that isnt playing safe.</br>  <br>But Dune is kinda sorta popular, and Paul kinda sorta had a harem. Come on Area-11!</br>  <br><br>Frank Herbert originally intended for the first three books to be written as a single novel, but he had too much content to fill just one book, so he split it into three. It was only around the time he began writing the third book that he decided that he wanted to do even more with the universe that he created.</br></br>  <br>Also think of all the delicious brown fremen lolis.</br>  <br>I looks trope heavy and like the author did have enough worthwhile things to say to fill the pages</br>  What's the worst name in Anime and why is it Lelouch?  <br> animes <br> Anime <br> genre <br><br>I think you might be the retarded one here, anon</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this may very well be the most autistic person I've seen.</br>  <br><br>He probably means Jump.<br><br>Also, you sound like a jackass.
