[ Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>http://bitlasers.com/djt<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128152<wbr>432/</wbr></br></br></br></br>  なるべく諦めない！<br>なせば大抵なんとかなる！<br><br>As long as you never give up and you keep pushing to better yourself, you'll make it no matter what. You CAN learn Japanese!</br></br></br>  <br><br>How do you go from a sentence full of words you don't know to understanding most of the words without flashcards?</br></br>  zoi  Am I losing anything by not having sentence audio on my cards? I have point audio, but sentence audio feels like it takes too long.  <br>I took the sentence audio out. It's distracting and I almost never listen to it anyways.</br>  <br>I just do? I think maybe you underestimate the power of your own memory. Anki is hardly required to learn. That said I rarely run into a sentence with more than 2 words I don't know. For example, if I read a chapter of manga, it's not uncommon that I don't even have to look a word at all in that chapter. Keep in mind, I dropped anki after knowing around 4000 words. I don't know if it would be really hard to do it without anki from the get go.</br>  <br>Not needed, sentence isn't needed either. The sentences are shit anyway.</br>   set reviews to 9999 <br> have 700 to do </br>  <br>By reading more. Getting from knowing 15% of words to 90% of words is the easiest part to do without flashcards. It's the range from 90-99 or so that's really hard without flashcards.</br>  so in the last thread i asked for advice some guy apparently gave bad advice so whats a good place to start at? currently im listening to japanesepod101 anyone use it before or comment on if its a good way to learn?  <br>Japanesepod is great. You might also be interested in rosetta stone and pimsleur</br>    <br>Yep. Hardest part is the shit that is just really uncommon that I don't see again for like 6 months or more. But, I'm happy if I can at least recognize that I had seen it before.</br>  <br>ねええぞいちゃん<br>俺のちん◯を触ってくれｗ(*´∀｀*)</br></br>  <br>Shitposting is shitposting even if it's in Japanese, go back to /b/</br>  <br>エッチ！</br>  <br>無礼</br>  <br>i dont know if youre serious i heard rosetta stone was terrible</br>  Hey guys i read the guide and i think i'm doing pretty good. Today I learned Hiragana, Katakana, and about 20 kanjis. I think i have a pretty good start. What do you recommend I do tommorow?   learn hangul <br> learn the word for Korea in Korean <br> literally hangook <br> gook <br><br>Now I see.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I recommend you read the guide again.</br>  <br>Totally serious, rosetta stone is legit, people shitting on it are baiting, and the guide was written to intimidate new people to keep the thread as a secrit club.</br>  I've been reading about tulpas again and they amaze me. I haven't heard about them in years but you can control your brain to do anything. They cuck themselves into schizophrenia but Iam only going to be happy and positive.<br><br>It so beautiful that one day I will know Japanese. Something that I never thought could be possible is going to happen one day :)</br></br>  For those you who want to have kids will you encourage them to learn other languages? I wish my parents did. They knew how much I was obsessed with anime from a young age and yet they did nothing. If I ever have kids I'll support their interest and direct them the right way.  <br><br><br><br>See <br><br>You literally just learn the kana and then do a vocab deck in Anki (the one in the Anki startup bin is recommended for starters) while you go through one of those grammar guides (and RTK if you want) and then read. If you still have an issue with grammar after that, there's other resources like the DoJG (and the deck) and other grammar textbooks.<br><br>The guide is just really fucking bloated for something aimed towards beginners. Should be trimmed down a bunch to make it less wordy, and split the resources/FAQ into their own docs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>makes sense considering a lot of these threads seems like a giant circlejerk</br>  <br>;)<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qmn<wbr>lSDk7KzY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Where can I subscribe?</br>  <br>ok cool thanks man ill definitely check that out</br>  <br><br><br>I read the guide pretty well Haha. It took me about 2 hours but i finally got both hiragana and katakana. it took 10 minutes for the 20 kanjis to learn. It's easy haha. I'll be done in a few months at this rate :)</br></br></br>  <br>This bitch is so retarded</br>  <br>Haha, maybe you should read it again, haha. Haha, a few months you say? Haha, we'll see about that, haha. :^)</br>  <br>I bet you don't know why Americans started calling them gooks.<br>You uneducated negro.</br></br>  <br>What's this supposed to mean? I only watched 3 mins but I'm just saying if my kid was into Japanese stuff I'd encourage him to learn more about it if they wanted to is all.</br>  <br> The guide is just really fucking bloated for something aimed towards beginners. Should be trimmed down a bunch to make it less wordy, and split the resources/FAQ into their own docs. <br>It's fine, I got started using that guide and it helped me a lot, gives a good overview of all non-retarded options without railroading people into a single method they might not like. <br>I doubt people that don't have attention span enough to read that guide can somehow learn a language, anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't like the idea of giving new people options.</br>  <br>I'm never going to watch 11 minutes of that but I assume trying to raise a child with 2 languages could be hard and confusing for him so it's understandable to only start with the language of the country he's going to live in <br>Then when he goes to middle school he could be helped by the native parent at learning English, surely that is what she is going to do</br></br>  <br>Kids absorb languages like fucking sponges. They have absolutely no problem being raised in two languages. That's what makes her opinion so ridiculous. Knowing English in Japan is such a huge advantage that not teaching her kids English just by fucking using the language normally is just plain retarded.</br>  <br><br>Being American, and being around friends who have grown up speaking both English and their native language, I can assure you that it's not only possible to do it but extremely easy. <br><br>My friends speak their native language less fluently than they speak English, despite speaking nothing but their native language at home and on family outings.<br><br><br><br>This.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A lot of people raise their kids to be bilingual, it's just going to take a few months longer before they start to talk, starting learning English in school is going to be a lot harder and confusing.</br>  <br>I listened to it.<br>It boils down to.<br><br>I don't want to teach my children English.<br>I have that decision as a mom<br>Respect my decision<br>Don't say mean things about my poor decision in life<br>Saying English is the most useful language is offensive to other language learning<br><br><br>Its a video based on feels and woman liberal logic. I recommend leaving it on to listen once because I couldn't wait that ugly beaver bitch</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At the start he's going to speak a bastard mix of Japanese and English like my grandpa was doing with my native and French after he went to fight for the FFL</br>  <br> trying to raise a child with 2 languages could be hard and confusing for him <br>Not really, I grew up learning 2 languages and it was pretty effortless.</br></br>  <br>People can tell the difference when the people around them aren't saying certain words. We can adapt to nearly any social situation as humans</br>    <br>All babies say stupid shit at the start so it doesn't matter in the slightest.</br>  Is anyone using Memorise? Don't have anki on my phone.  <br>Memorise...</br>  <br><br>But only one of those can be construed as "liberal", and even then you need to use the really stupid American definition for it work?</br></br>  <br>Memorise?</br>  <br><br>*Memrise</br></br>  So should I work on a RTK kanji deck or KD for Kanji? Or both at the same time? is that a good idea anyways?<br><br>What do you guys recommend for starters? Im doing nothing this whole summer so I have fuck loads of time. I have Kana down btw. I plan on working on the 2k/6k core vocab deck and Tae Kim/Genki for grammar.</br></br>  <br> Memerise </br>  <br> Or both at the same time? <br>That's a really bad idea, chose one. Compare the first few cards in a deck and choose the one you like most.</br></br>  <br>Yes and no<br>From personal experience it depends on the kid and both parents. if you teach them language A only but the school teaches them language B then it becomes a problem.</br></br>  <br>I just basterdize the word liberal to mean doing retarded things that should be accepted by others and not vilified.<br><br>Slut <br>Fat acceptance<br>Bug chasing<br>Drug abuse for recreation<br>Not working<br><br>All behavior that should be called out that fits in the left wing liberal garbage mindset.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Drug abuse for recreation <br>I understand everything else, but what's wrong with that?</br></br>  <br>Mods can't read japanese though.</br>  I've been trying to get to the CoR for the past few days but my connection keeps timing out. Is anyone else having this issue or am I just an idiot?   At what level should I open up a manga? <br><br>I'm going to do what most people do and start with Yotsuba. Which I've been saving for this very moment! Or does someone know a better manga to start out with?</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>God you people are fucking faggots.<br><br>This is /djt/, assoles.

She's only popular because she's an American in Japan who can use a camera. <br><br>If I'm going to watch a foreigner in Japan, I'm gonna watch Rachael and Jun or some shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Is there an RTK deck that doesn't just dump 訓 readings on you and actually explain the meaning for each reading? The stupidity in KD is limited to accompanying text, which doesn't negate how fucking useful everything else is.<br>The only real con to KD is that it ignores some of the kanji that would be useful in manga and games because the guy is too much of a normalfag to encounter them.</br></br>  <br>あなたのすぐ後るに落ちていましたよ？</br>  <br><br> kanadajin3 <br> big Canadian flag in thumbnail <br> American <br><br>I thought it was Quebec shit at first.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I get that but what does it mean<br>Go back and don't fail?</br></br>  <br> wanting to watch any of that weeaboo bullshit <br>As far as being a weeaboo goes, willingly watching Jvloggers makes you the lowest of the low.</br></br>  <br>The pleasure of being cummed inside, from behind.</br>  <br>is there a way to get a list of words from the VN?</br>  <br><br>あなたのすぐ後ろに - right behind you<br><br>落ちていましたよ - dropped</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ohh, your right behind<br>I'm dumb</br></br>  Can anyone tell me what this says?  <br>"Have you fallen behind?"</br>  <br>Damn you're right.

NEETs can't get gfs. I had a gf in high school, she was an adorable middle school girl and I fucked it up through neetness. She loved me and I loved her too. But I lost her because of anime and video games. Just the fact that you have trouble not sitting in front of your computer all the time is a deal breaker. Somehow if you were working instead, it wouldn't be a problem. That's just how it is, though.</br>  <br>Subscribed.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, and you learned all that Japanese from 2 fucking lessons in Genki.</br></br>  <br>This banter is great.</br>  <br>All what Japanese? The only thing I learned from genki at the time was basic は usage, all of the vocab came just from watching anime. Look at this page and find me a word that every weeaboo out there wouldn't know despite not touching a japanese textbook in his life.</br>  <br><br>Just stop.</br></br>  <br>Stop what, encouraging people to start reading right away?</br>  Yotsuba is really easy to read. To the guy who seems to believe otherwise you should try reading the first volume. I wouldn't be surprised if there weren't even 200 unique words in it.  <br>Now make this shit compatible with the Oculus rift, or the Halo Lens, and I'll cum buckets.</br>  How do i extract the scripts of my VN to analyze it? The only tools i find are texthookers  <br>people already have 360 video players for OR<br> Halo Lens <br>"ao" in first syllable in english is almost always spelled with "o".</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Samefag, please. Are you under the impression that Genki teaches you 200 unique words by lesson 2? And that all of them are in Yotsuba?<br><br>The point of this is that you honestly believe Genki, in it's entirety, would have you reading Yotsuba. Let alone the first 2 fucking lessons.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hmm... Well there wasn't a single necko, kawai, or even a des to be seen on that page, so I'm pretty sure that most weeaboo wouldn't even know a single word on that page.</br>  Can I get banned from posting in Japanese on other boards?  <br>You reverse engineer the engine or the file format used to store the script.</br>  <br>If it's offtopic or shitposting, then probably.</br>  <br>japanesepod is really good, though. check out the intermediate/advanced lessons. you can't lump it in with the bullshit.<br><br><br>Listen to the facts and the anecdotes, do your own research, and make your own decisions. Keep in mind that this is /a/: no one ever loses an argument here.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not him, but thanks, I always wondered this too.</br></br>  <br> japanesepod is really good, though. check out the intermediate/advanced lessons. you can't lump it in with the bullshit. <br>The reason people shit on it is that many people mess up and just use it, instead of using it as one of many resources.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, people should complete the entirety of DOJG to understand the nuance hidden withing chapter 1 of よつばと！<br><br><br>I may be overestimating the ability of an average weeb to memorize foreign words, but I certainly wasn't talking about facebook faggots.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What is this game and is it  really bad? </br>  <br> mobile <br>You bet your ass it's bad.</br></br>  <br>I could read that page and I haven't even finished Tae Kim's essential grammar section, let alone gotten past a week of Core/Kore or ever practiced kanji.</br>  <br>Okay. Since I moved to a new house I started getting banned all the time (for 1-3 days). So now I'm very careful. Before I moved, I got banned maybe 3 times since 2006. <br><br>Also, that last 電波教師 episode was pretty funny eh? (Now they can't claim it's not anime related)</br></br></br>  <br>I'm proud of you, anon-kun.</br>  <br><br> i could read it <br> it has furigana <br> good thing I'm so smart <br><br>Good thing grammar is included with that furigana, huh?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that's not racist </br>  <br>It seemed pretty shit when I tried it. It's been 4+ years though, so it very well could have improved.</br>  How do you get over a line of text you don't understand? Some lines i don't get and spend a long time trying to figure out. I know i should just forget about it and move on, but i guess ocd kicks in, and i really want to know what the line means, or what i got wrong, and spend more time then i should trying to understand it  <br>You move to the next line.<br><br>Alternatively, see a doctor</br></br></br>  <br>You have to be retarded to not get what's happening here even without much grammar knowledge.</br>  <br>Doesn't happen very often. It happens so fewly often that, I just ignore it and it usually has no effect on my understanding of anything, because it's usually just a stupid piece of dialogue with no story value at all! Guess what, you'll spend an hour figuring it out, and you'll realize that they were saying "lol fuck you bro" and you'll realize, it doesn't even matter.</br>  <br>my grammar is terrible, so there's a bunch of things i don't understand, and i learn a bunch of new ones every day, but sometimes theres that one thing i can't understand and it drives me crazy</br>  How do I get good at understanding what japanese people are saying? I've been studying for 2 years and can now read easy stuff like Yotsuba and know a lot of vocabulary, but when I listen to videos of japanese people discussing I get lost in the sentences and have trouble understanding what they're saying. I'm going to Japan in a month, how should I practice that?  <br>Read VNs, they have audio, and you can replay it if you don't get it the first time</br>   tfw you've studied for 2 years but you're still not even N3 <br>Is there something wrong with me?</br>  <br>Talk to people, get some friend online from japanguide or some similar site.<br>Most people there are really nice.</br></br>  <br>I usually just skip lines I don't understand. If I think it is important or I see the same words keep coming up, I'll try to figure it out. Google for words or grammar, use Google translate, check DOJG, etc. If none of that works I come to the DJT and they give me an answer within a few minutes. Some people try to shit on DJT and say they have never gotten helped, but that is only because they ask retarded questions. Every question I've asked has gotten answered.</br>  <br>There's at least something wrong with your studying method, reaching N2 in a year should be fully possible. <br>Sounds like you've been "studying" on and off and not really putting a lot of effort in.</br></br>  <br>What do you mean "you". I was N1 in a little over 2 years without being a NEET</br>  <br>Are you serious, or are you just a self-assessed "N1?"<br>Assuming it's the first, what were your study habits?</br></br>  <br> N1 in a little over 2 years without being a NEET <br>Right, prove it.</br></br>   tfw i want to try this "Shadowing" method but i don't have anywhere i can do it where no one will see me   <br>I never took the N1, but I took the JCAT and got placed a 10-20 points below N1 a bit after the 2 year mark. So a little bit of exaggeration but not too much.<br><br> Assuming it's the first, what were your study habits? <br>Eroge everyday. Also I just had school, not a job, which means plenty of free time still.</br></br></br></br>  <br> frogposting <br>Yes, there is something wrong with you. Fucking quit that.</br></br>  <br> inb4 he asks for a notarized timestamped copy of your jcat results <br>this "prove it" thing is the latest shitposting meme.</br></br>  Is there any way of marking new cards in Anki as mastered?  <br><br>http://vocaroo.com/?upload</br></br>  <br>Yeah, just keep getting them easy.</br>  <br>He made a dubious claim, it's only natural to ask for proof since he's gloating about it </br>  <br>he's probably just a false beginner</br>  <br>That sounds like a pain in the ass...<br>I'm doing Kanji Damage, but I already know 4~500 of the first cards, is there really no other way?<br>I guess I could delete or suspend them</br></br></br>  <br>a wut?</br>  <br><br> Is she actually an alien? </br></br>  <br>You seem them 4 days from now, then 8-10 days later and finally they're mature.</br>  <br>someone who already knew much of the material before they "started"</br>  <br>No. She's a squid, she's a kid.</br>  <br>Ah yeah, there are a lot of those. I'd bet my ass the AJATT faggot was one.</br>  <br>Alright, thanks</br>  Man, it would be cool if there was a version of core 6k with all useless normalfag/business words and obvious katakana loanwords replaced with common terms from manga and VN to get people started faster  Hi guys. Question, how would you translate "さっきから寸止めばっかされててもう...もう!!", especially the もう part if nothing else? 寸止め in this case is about reaching an objective. Can give more context if needed  <br>I like katakana loanwords, they're a free easy new word when I get them, and I still learn something because you have to read it once to confirm that the english word can actually be used in a japanese conversation in the same context. But yeah, theres a lot of useless shit like business words that I end up never learning because they're useless and hard</br>  <br>Someone posted a Core 6k spreadsheet that was reordered according to an LN corpus, all the compound words are at the back though.</br>  <br><br>You'll see them. Japanese's got political, business and economic terms way more ingrained in common language than you're giving it credit for.</br></br>  Noone has ever said to themselves when they see an English word "I am never going to use that word therefor I will not even try to learn it"  <br>Yes they have, and yes they do. That's what native speakers do all the time when they come across new words. They judge that if they haven't seen the word in 18+ years, it probably isn't important.<br><br>Of course, this is assuming they aren't trying to learn about some specific subject to which the word is relevant.</br></br></br>  <br>I learned the word "extemporaneous" last week, but I forgot it within a day. It wasn't until it was used two or three more times that I actually managed to retain it.</br>  <br>Natives aren't actively learning vocabulary but you are and will do so for a long while yet. Don't be nitpicky, you're just starting out. You'll see fucking everything in the Core6k, they're all pretty common words in almost all types of text and genres.</br>  <br> extemporaneous <br>That's a much common word in my native language. Funny.</br></br>  <br> Don't be nitpicky, you're just starting out <br>Who do you think you're talking to?<br><br>Anyway I never did Core decks but I do recall people posting some tax related word from it that Ive literally never fucking seen.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Vocabulary count?</br>  <br>Aulophobia</br>  <br> Vocabulary count? <br>Anyone who can actually answer this must have wasted a pathetic amount of time in anki</br></br>  I checked the guide at the top. <br><br>Will I be missing out on anything important if I learn stroke order and pronunciation from Tae Kim, and then do reps with Realkana to cement it?</br></br>  <br> 400 hours in anki in 2 years <br>I-is that a pathetic amount?</br></br>  <br>I won't expect to see 初詣で in 80% of VNs, but you're right that it wouldn't be weird at all for an author to use it.<br><br>A whole entire 4583 words in core6k are Extremely common in LNs, though. And that's not even counting compound words, only unified morphemes. I cannot find any particularly outstanding words from that 4583.<br><br>No, that's fine.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's less than an a hour a day...</br>  <br>On Anki, you retard. And if you aren't using Anki, why are you butting in?</br>  <br>It would be nice if we could find some vocabulary estimator online.</br>  is it possible to analyse hanahira to see the word frequency, etc? How do i do it?  <br>If you read as much as you're supposed to and have good %ages in anki, 30 minutes a day is more than enough Anki. What matters is the number of mature cards you make every week, not how much time you spend.</br>  <br>1) Find a copy of its script<br>2) Make sure the script doesn't have furigana in it, that will make words with furigana show up more<br>3) Put the script as plaintext somewhere on your hard drive and plug it into that japanese text analyzer tool<br>4) Make sure to use the latest version with MeCab selected<br>5) Profit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Otorhinolaryngologist.</br>  <br>I don't know about every week, but I seem to mature about 15-20 cards every day now.</br>  <br>How do i find a copy of the script?

The Guide is supposed to be a piece of propaganda, essentially. There isn't really anything wrong with trying to talk people into a specific narrow path of progression as a beginner. In fact for beginners I think this is the best thing someone can do for them. They are going to progress with almost anything they do and the real key to going from beginner to intermediate is more about establishing a routine and studying every day with progressive overload. There are dozens of ways this can be done but without a simple <br> do this <br> now do this <br> then do this  <br>Approach, most people would become lost in the stream of information. I've been thinking about it for a little while on and off and I think what would be really useful is if we/someone could come up with a shortlist of different narrow paths aimed at high early progression and routine, for different goals, and have those as options, it would be great. Almost like picking a guide for level progression for a character in an RPG game. Pick something and stick with it and the results will be magnified. <br><br>A highly simplified and stylised example of representing this sort of thing might be like pic related. Kind of like a skill tree.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lets see if i can understand this...<br><br>Literal: I am master japanese<br> <br>Prettied up version: I am a japanese master<br><br> inb4 i fucked up </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw when I read things like this as "このSomethingこそわたくしめのFuckれな人生におけるIsh<wbr>ouldKnowThisのGodDamnItきでございましょう"</wbr> <br><br>I have a long way to go...</br></br></br>  <br>The only focuses should be<br>- Listening<br>- Reading<br>- Studying (e.g. Anki, RTK, etc)<br>Nothing else provides stable, comprehensible input, which is the only way people actually acquire language, and it's the fundamental foundation aroundwhich working language learning methods revolve.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You aren't going to learn writing without specifically trying to and you know it.</br>  <br>Lol, you suck socks.</br>  <br> I wouldn't be surprised if there weren't even 200 unique words in it. <br>From memory there are near a thousand unique words in the first volume.

Her mother looks so fucking ass stupid in that new drawing style. Like, Uguu-stupid.</br>  Reminder that against all odds, Lelouch died (yes, *died*; deal with it) a virgin. He died a virgin despite the facts that:<br><br>- Sex is not some taboo in this series. Fucking Ohgi got pussy (then betrayed him and became Prime Minister of Japan).<br><br>- He was surrounded by tons of beautiful, sexy women that wanted his dick, including CC, a succubus who has been giving out the ass for centuries.<br><br>- He has the power to make anyone do whatever he wants. But as we all know, rape is far worse than murder.<br><br>Even the most wimpy, dense, retarded, and gynophobic of protagonists get laid or eventually will. Lelouch is revolutionary in this regard, as he is none of these and still didn't get any. A protagonist for the ages.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   died <br><br>Bullshit.</br></br>  he got fucked by murphy's law all the time, though.  <br>Maybe he just wasn't interested?</br>  <br>Seemed it. Didn't mean he me couldn't have taken a quick dip anyway.</br>  <br>He only wanted his little sister.</br>  <br>Nigger, Lelouch didn't die. <br>First of all it is necessary to explain how the "code" is obtained by using Charles Vi Britannia, Lelouch's dad, and C.C. as an example. Charles' geass had already evolved into the advanced version, i.e. where it shows up on both his eyes, by the time the viewer get to know him. In addition, C.C. did also evolve her eyes before she received the code. In both cases Charles and C.C. killed their predecessors by using the power of their advanced versions of geass. C.C.'s predecessor also states this condition herself. <br>There is also another condition set before the code activates - one has to die. In the scene where C.C.'s predecessor tricks C.C., C.C. is wounded around her chest area with blood fussing out. Furthermore, Charles' code activates at the moment Lelouch orders him to die. <br>As in these two cases, Lelouch receives the code in a similar way, thus obtaining true immortality. When Charles grabbed onto his throat he was technically killed by Lelouch - he dissipated in this case - thereby passing on the code from parent to child. It also gives a lot sense that Lelouch receives the geass from Charles who is his father, and thus is the successor of both his ability, the code, and the throne. <br>However, it's important to point out that he didn't activate the code until the last episode where the last condition, involving the bearer's dead, was fulfilled at the moment Suzaku killed him. This realization alone is a very strong argument in that Lelouch is actually alive and immortal at that. There is further evidence supporting this point.<br>One should remark that C.C. also have the mark of the code on her forehead, while Charles has it on his hand. So Lelouch most likely has it on another part of his body.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Not so sure about that.</br>  <br><br>JUST</br></br>  <br>2015 and still believing he died.</br>  <br>Was this from that ntr doujin where CC and Kallen randomly get stolen by Britanians, and Diethard set that up to happen to deliberately make Zero no longer interested in women since the two closest to him betray him?</br>  <br> died </br>  <br>“An intellectual is someone who has found something more interesting than sex.” <br>― Edgar Wallace</br></br>  <br>Reminder that it's real.</br>  Kallen is a cuck.  Doesn't Akito the Exiled confirm he's alive though or am I fucking up timelines?  <br> I don't need pussy even if nobody wants to give it to me and I'll prove it by posting a pretentious quote by literally who! </br>  <br> died </br>  <br><br>He's alive.<br><br> Pic related </br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone fucking asks the same shit.<br><br> wat guise y is lelouch alive y is the world bad again guise idk how to google lol <br><br>It's an interquel.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Akito is between season 1 and season 2.<br><br>So it's 1.5</br></br></br>  <br>cry more :^)<br><br>I see, that makes sense</br></br></br>  <br>Possibly. I don't like NTR so I wouldn't know.</br>  <br>Why is Lelouch by himself, even withstanding suzaku, so much more interesting than all the rest of the cast of Akito? What is it about him?</br>  <br><br>Only good doujins are doujins with pizzabutt</br></br>  <br>He was boning CC in between battles all the fucking time, it just wasn't an important part of the story or characters so the show didn't waste time on it.</br>  <br>It's not that he's terribly interesting, the rest of Akito is boring as fuck</br>  <br>Present proof.</br>  <br>Interesting due to complexity, no, but interesting due to the entertainment value he provides is definitely a characteristic of his. Akito the exiled has such a bland cast so far. If the mech fights weren't great eyecandy I might've dropped it. Also Leila's body.</br>  <br>I had pussy and my world did not change. Except that dealing with cunts is not worth my time. I'd now rather tap my Ona Hole. I just want to state that lelouch might just had his priorities set on something more worthwhile than fucking.<br><br>Although its rather unrealistic he just never had an opportunity to fuck. Blame it on the writers not to incorporate every shit, why didn't they also show him taking a shit. I don't remember Lelouch having to take a shit once.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Someone's gotta go rewatch  <br><br>It's pretty well implied. See the scene at the end of the anime, like episode 24, where Kallen interrupts C.C. and Lelouch's romantic moment. Possibly the only romantic scene Lelouch ever had in terms of sexual implications the entire show.</br></br></br></br>  <br>wasn't he into dudes?</br>  <br>It is a super power to Geass. Were any Geass users shown taking a shit? I think I am seeing a pattern here.</br>  <br>Erinnerung, dass gegen alle Widrigkeiten, starb Lelouch (ja, * * starb; deal with it) einer Jungfrau. Er starb als Jungfrau trotz der Tatsachen, dass:<br>- Sex ist nicht irgendein Tabu in dieser Serie. Ficken Ohgi bekam Muschi (dann verriet ihn und wurde Premierminister von Japan).<br>- Er wurde von Tonnen schön, sexy Frauen, die seinen Schwanz wollte, einschließlich CC, ein Sukkubus, denen geben hat den Arsch Jahrhunderten umgeben.<br>- Er hat die Macht, die jeder machen, was er will. Aber wie wir alle wissen, ist Vergewaltigung weit schlimmer als Mord.<br>Selbst die wimpy, dichte, verzögert, und gynophobia der Protagonisten bekommen gelegt oder schließlich wird. Lelouch ist revolutionär in diesem Zusammenhang, wie er ist keiner von diesen und noch keine bekommen. Ein Protagonist für die Ewigkeit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a psychopath, or schizoid. Enough said.</br>  <br> Getting laid is more important than destroying the world to rebuild it. <br><br>Please, plebian. <br><br> literally who <br>Please leave. Your kind aren't welcome here. You're both a virgin AND have never done anything significant.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As a wise man once said, and Lelouche clearly embodies the philosophy "I don't need your pussy, bitch. I'm on my own dick."</br>  <br>There was a point where he did say Euphemia may have been the only woman he ever truly loved.</br>  <br><br>I don't think you understand sexual romance vs love</br></br>  <br>Like you said there was a point where he stated this, however you can see that he loved Shirley as well by the time she died and of course if you pay attention Lelouch promised to make C.C. happy as she didn't manage to die. To maintain this promise he has to live.</br>  <br><br>C.C. also promised to be the only one to be by his side after he lost everyone/everyone hated him<br><br>Not even Suzaku was really by his side. Those last two months were probably a lot of fun. Nothing but fucking in Emporer Charle's bed</br></br></br></br>  posting best girl  <br>You can't prove he didn't get any off screen.<br>Just like you can't prove he did. It's pretty much like God tbh.</br></br>  <br><br>CUCK</br></br>  <br><br>Lelouch died a virgin as a mortal, that is correct, but then he woke up and thus eventually became non-virgin with C.C. <br><br>It's all old Code Geass talk though so whatever.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Getting laid is more important than destroying the world to rebuild it. <br> It's either/or! <br>Typical rationalizing loser.</br></br></br>  <br>calm down, you're all losers</br>  <br> Lelouch  <br> dead <br>I'll bet you he is in the shadows that will come out once suzaku fucks up.</br></br></br>  <br>Some people can't accept it, like accepting Lelouch being a dead virgin.</br>  <br><br>Honestly his plan makes no sense anyway. The world will just turn into a new cycle 50 years later. The plan is so unLelouch that he has to be alive for it to make any sense at all. His entire plan was to become immortal. That is the Zero Requiem.</br></br>  <br>Too bad he won't be deflowering her. Then again, he seemed like the crazy overprotective type that wouldn't let guys near her.</br>  <br><br>This post is bad and you should feel bad. Nunally was second to worst girl behind Kallen anyway.<br><br>Then again the only intelligent girl in the entire show is C.C.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Every 50 years Zero comes back and topples the order </br>  <br><br> Lelouch along with his waifu C.C. return every 50 years to restore peace <br><br>I would watch it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit. Now I get it he became immortal, so he can become Zero every time humility fucks up again and resumes the title. Like Jesus.</br>  <br> Nunally was second to worst girl behind Kallen <br> either worst girl when garbage like Nina and Anya exists <br>Calm down, CCfag.</br></br></br>  <br>You seem to be missing the point that he won't do shit until Nunally actually dies. Why? because he fooled Suzaku by telling that he is influenced by the geass called "people's dreams" in order to make Suzaku also accept that Geass, therefore accepting his own inability to die at will. At the same time he assures a guardian for his sister Nunnally.</br>  <br><br> Implying those are even girl characters <br><br>Nina has a penis, and Anya is a otherkin</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This is how you turn Code Geass into a milkable franchise like Gundam while never losing out on the entertainment Lelouch provides.</br></br>  <br><br>One, Lelouch knows all about cycles. Pay attention. <br><br>The cycle will take place in a better status quo. That's the point of the plan. <br><br>Not eternal peace or forcing people into submission forever.<br><br>Lelouch isn't against future conflict as a form of evolution/progress. <br><br>Even if he were alive, the guy isn't going to micromanage the world.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't have to be Lelouch, but they certainly will make more Code Geass both with and without him.</br>  <br><br>C.C. and Lelouch are the two main selling points of Code Geass.<br><br>Having both of them in the next series would boost sales/profits 200x</br></br></br></br>  <br>But if he had sex wouldn't he lose his wizard powers?</br>  <br>They are the two main selling points of THIS Code Geass yet there is nothing stopping them from making a different, equal or better one with others. Except for the mental inflexibility of some (thankfully not all) fans.<br><br>It's not like I dislike either of them, mind you.</br></br></br>  <br> 2015 <br> Being stupid enough to think he died <br><br>Faking your death is far easier than the bullshit he was doing all series.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It would certainly be better with Lelouch.<br><br>It will also boost the plot twists and entertainment value. If only they had a way to include Suzaku into later entries</br></br></br>  <br>Akito fucking blows though, it's like looking at Shinn from SEED Destiny. So I hope they abandon that shit soon.</br>  <br>That part in the episode was fantastic.<br><br> You will never have C.C comfort your worst moments of dread and despair </br></br></br>  <br> faceless cart man <br> CC calls out to Lelouch from the back as she looks up <br> "HURR LELOUCH DIED DEAL WITH IT" </br></br></br>  <br><br> Hearing C.C. speak a couple lines in Akito 3 gave me the only reason to buy it <br><br>I'm truly a pleb.<br><br><br><br>Of course it was. Wish there was more moments like that on screen. Kallen always interrupted them. Hopefully Kallen cuck gets gone in R3</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly, he doesn't do things the easy way and so he's a dead virgin.</br>  Kuuderes are underwhelming.  <br>Explain this then if Lelouch died why is the paper crane atop the carrier, behind C.C. C.C. wouldn't bring such a thing and it most certainly is a symbol of Nunnally's and Lelouch's relationship. It is even a pink paper crane, a paper crane which was given by Nunnally to Lelouch in one of the early episodes.</br>  <br>I am this anon<br><br>And I agree that they could make a better one. They just need to have better fleshed out cast than they have with Akito so far. From episode 1 Lelouch and C.C. were intriguing and Akito hasn't managed that in three hours of movie, other than mild curiosity.</br></br></br>  Daily reminder they will be there for each other, making each other happy, until the end of days  <br>Re-read my post.</br>   2015 <br> Still caring about Code Gayass and Ledouche </br>  <br> tfw no Kuudere Neesan <br><br>I would slaughter so much for this to be a reality</br></br></br>  <br><br>C.C. folded that pink paper crane. Not that I believe Lelouch is dead anyway. The paper crane symbolizes her relationship with Lelouch. Her wish to be happy, with him.</br></br>   you'll never have a space-based future version of the geass world where lelouch returns as a centuries-old version of CC and gives geass to someone   <br> 2015 <br> NGE posts every day <br><br>It's like people enjoy these shows.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, I just realized that. My bad.</br>  <br>Lelouche was an incestuous siscon that was also a purefag. He only had one opportunity to fuck and that was at his lowest point. He just wanted to fuck his sisters but couldn't bring himself to.</br>  <br><br> Implying they would ever show C.C. and Lelouch fucking on screen <br> Implying they would ever go beyond implicating it to keep the balance of sales </br></br></br>  <br>You're talking nonsense. <br><br>Akito is fine. It's also not the only possibility there is to make something different. Just one of them.<br><br>I don't think you know what was the problem with SEED Destiny or even remember who Shinn was</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Akito is certainly not fine with only 3 minutes of C.C screentime mate. <br><br> 3 minutes of C.C. screentime to last me from 2008 to 2015 <br><br>I should just off myself now. I'm going back to r9k</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You forget what he wanted all along.</br>  When do you think another will come out?  <br> I'm truly a pleb. <br><br>Yes you are. I did like seeing C.C. in Akito but it wasn't the only reason I imported it.<br><br> R3 <br><br>Well, that confirms it. Dude, get real.<br><br>That's never going to happen. Also, celebrate C.C. without being so irrationally against Kallen for once.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lelouch didn't die a virgin. He was fucking Suzaku.</br>  <br><br> No Kallen means more screentime for C.C. <br><br>Never anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not CC. It's that little chinese girl.<br><br>Kallen gets raped and loves it. Then uypon seeing how great it is, the little girl packs herself into a suitcase.<br><br>Diethard sends Lelouch videos of slave CC and chinese girl doing sex slave stuff to keep him motivated.<br><br>Pretty good. Also the originator of that giant fucking penis image with all the women worshipping it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends on each person. I think the issue is Kazuki Akane had some very particular interests about what he wanted to do with Akito. It's pretty nuanced, characters included, just in a less overt way. <br><br>Perhaps it would potentially work better on TV, not necessarily as an OVA. <br><br>Thus some people are open to his interests, like me, and others aren't, both for understandable reasons and just due to knee-jerk reactions or impatience.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sauce. I gotta read dis</br></br>    The Geassbowl was the first time I ever came to 4chan and happened to my first real I really actively watched anime  <br><br> There is a small smile on my face whenever I see a code geass thread because of that </br></br>  <br>It's on Doujin moe. I forget the name. There aren't that many so just search Code Geass and look for Kallen and the chinese girl.</br>  <br> &gt;No Kallen means more screentime for C.C. <br><br>But that's false. And quite petty.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off back to your own anime Deidara.</br>  <br><br>No it's not. Also don't push your plebian values onto me. Kallen and every selfish nip character in the show were awful. They cared for nothing but themselves and their own selfish values. Kallen is even worse than Brohgi.<br><br>Does anyone happen to have the Brohgi copy pasta?</br></br></br></br>  <br>That doujin is overrated. Your description is also wrong but fuck that.</br>  <br>why would you call that fucking trash Brohgi. Are you trying to make me mad, you son of a bitch?</br>  <br>CC had no attachment to cranes, that was purely Lelouch`s thing, as an attachment to Nunnally. There is no reason for CC to fold it, as it would not have even meant anything to Lelouch as far as his relationship with CC is concerned. Likewise, CC had no real attachment to Nunnally except insofar as she accommodated Lelouch`s attachment.</br>  <br>I agree, but he asked for it.<br><br>Was my description wrong? That's about how I remembered it.</br></br></br>  <br>True patricians aren't so insecure that they need to put others down, anon. <br><br>Your hostility towards every girl who isn't C.C. has been noted before. It's also pointless of you to accuse Kallen of being selfish when C.C., Lelouch and literally everyone else was also the same. Just for different reasons. This isn't a show about selfless angels at all. <br><br>And thus now you're just talking crap for no real purpose. C.C. is awesome, indeed, but unfortunatelyyou aren't.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Literally the first scene of episode 2 with Lelouch, C.C, and Nunally <br><br>I suggest you got rewatch.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I just haven't found Leila and Akito to be as entertaining as Lelouch and C.C. Which was a factor for me. I think Akito has a lot of potential to blow me out of the water still and I hope it does. Leila's Geass is interesting and if they expanded on that a fair amount, my opinion of Akito as a whole would improve. Akito has been interesting, while R1 and R2 were entertaining.</br>   Mfw Brohgi cucks Lelouch and all of Britannia   <br>I wouldn't disagree, in terms of them not being incredibly entertaining, since they're not even the same type of characters either. I understand what you mean, but just like I watch a lot of anime that doesn't have anyone like C.C. or Lelouch, I have no major issues watching Akito except for the delays being so long. That's the structural issue. I am sure the next Code Geass will be something else entirely, in any case, so we'll see what happens.</br>  <br> Deidara </br>  <br>If you ignore Lelouch pretty much won even in "death" that is</br>  <br>You say this as if CC, and Lelouch for that matter, aren't two of the most selfish characters in the series. She used Lelouch and was deal with Chales so she could die, and he shouldn't be explained.</br>  <br><br>C.C. is rightfully selfish. She has lived for almost a thousand years<br><br>Lelouch is a right cunt though but I respect him anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>found you</br></br></br></br>  <br>Agreed. The characters are different and that is fine. It has other good factors such as great fights, some light-hearted fanservice, and interesting mech design. Plus, at this point, there is a lot of intrigue as to the scale and some of the motivations of the characters. My biggest complaint is how long the gypsy part felt in comparison to everything else. Some of the gypsy stuff was good, Leila backstory and Akito bonding with Leila, but other parts of it felt like it dragged too much such as the chores and too much focus on molesting the one guy.</br>  Real talk though how much money do you think Lelouch stole from the government or whoever before he and CC took off? Enough to live just ok for a couple a centuries I think.  <br> he got fucked by murphy's law all the time, though. <br>seriously. he was the walking living proof of murphy's law. imagine if everything went according to plan, just once. The show would have ended 40 episodes earlier.</br></br>  <br> Still thinking Lelouch is dead <br> Actually believing that dying a virgin has any bearing on what makes him the   best  protagonist<br><br>Just because we didn't see him shagging anyone does not mean it did not happen. He tried to get a little sensual comfort from Kallen that one time, so it's not like he wasn't interested in sex. C.C. spent months hiding in his bedroom for fucks sake, not to mention all the rest of the time they were nearly inseparable and clearly into each other. There's no reason to suspect they didn't have a long, passionate  threesome with Suzaku  the night before Zero's Requiem. Lelouch's sex life has nothing to do with the story, so nothing needed to be shown. That honor goes to the doujin artists.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 2015 <br> still believing Lelouch wasn't boning Suzaku <br><br>holy shit /a/, i knew there were some dense motherfuckers around here, but i didn't realize you were all this dense?<br><br>that motherfucker is to fabulous to be straight. and his unnatural affinity for suzaku, and suzaku's unnatural over reactions around lelouch cinch the deal. he was plowing suzaku's ass for years.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So many people still in stage one.  <br> implying the stages of grief are a real thing <br>apply yourself</br></br>  <br>On your way to stage two.</br>  <br>http://www.helpguide.org/articles/g<wbr>rief-loss/coping-with-grief-and-los<wbr>s.htm#stages</wbr></wbr></br>  <br> posting cucks </br>  <br> cucks <br>I hate you for being such a transparent crossboarder.</br></br>  <br><br>cuck pls go</br></br>  <br> - He has the power to make anyone do whatever he wants. But as we all know, rape is far worse than murder. <br>It's not like he was murdering random people, anyway. I don't see how raping someone would have contributed to his plans, although with his bullshit, I guess he might have come up with it somehow.</br></br>  <br>There you go again. Naked as a baby.</br>  Why did Lelouch even give singular orders? He can use his geass to make all crazy sorts of commands. If he doesn't want to just make everyone his slave all the time, why not make the order something like<br> Every time I say "I, Zero, command you... etc." you will obey <br><br>Then he'd have a "safe word" to make sure nobody's in slave mode, and he can completely control anyone whenever he wants.<br><br>Lulu was shit with his geass.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I swear he did that actually, to have people's orders only activate in response to a phrase.</br>  <br> Lulu was shit with his geass. <br>And Gandalf was shit with his eagle.</br></br>  <br>Only version of that I can recall is when he ordered Gilford to see him as Cornelia whenever he pulls on his collar.<br><br>Which was pretty fucking stupid. Appearing as Cornelia isn't as effective as "obey and protect me" for example.</br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't Lelouch just turn around and give them the order to die?</br>  <br>Schnizel is a hell of a lot more useful as a living puppet than a corpse.</br>  <br> Why did Lelouch even give singular orders? He can use his geass to make all crazy sorts of commands. If he doesn't want to just make everyone his slave all the time, why not make the order something like <br>BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO. Simple as that. Lelouch strongly, strongly believed in free will and the sanctity of choice, part of the paradox he had to deal with was that his power denied that and there were other things he strong, strongly believed in that were in direct opposition. That dilemma was one of the key parts of the entire series, and it shows how clearly he's gone into total despair mode when he finally just does what he COULD have done from the start and simply commands "become my slave." But he wants to save humanity in general even then, not turn everyone into puppets. And he prides himself on his intelligence and tactical &amp; strategic reasoning making Geass unnecessary in as many cases as possible, just serving to sometimes tip the balance the way he wants to help with "impossible" scenarios.<br><br>At the start though, for all his massively high IQ and thirst for revenge and early royal education, he's still a fucking high school student. He does have ideals and emotions. He's not just a purely calculating Machiavelli. It's only towards the end of the whole deal when he runs out of options and has gone through a lot of bitter experience, including betrayal by the forces he worked so hard for because they were utter fucking retards, that he truly starts pushing his geass hard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He literally does this at the end of the series once he leaves the Black Knights.</br>  <br>See above replies, but also are you a fucking retard anon?<br> Why didn't he obviously reveal his super power on live worldwide television in an obviously extremely villainous way that would terrify the shit out of all his allies <br>Gee I wonder.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Just be cause he died doesn't mean he's dead.</br></br>  <br>People die when they're killed anon.</br>  <br><br>No one's disputing that Lelouch died, only that he's dead!</br></br>  <br>Literal Japan-tier German</br>  I hate Lelouch for the same reason I hate Walter White: selfish, lying, murdering, manipulative piece of shit that got away with it.  <br> didn't_actually_bother_to_watch_th<wbr>e_series/10</wbr> <br>Euphoric.</br></br>  <br> i was too busy masturbating to pay attention to the series! <br>ebin</br></br>  I've been rewatching the show. I forgot how fucking sad it was.<br><br>Is an R3 even in the works, or is the Akito thing the latest and last?</br></br>  Is Code Geass worth watching or are these threads just a bunch of nerds who liked it when they were kids?  <br> 2007+8 <br> haven't seen Code Geass <br>Why the fuck are you browsing /a/, you little shit? Go watch it right now before you post again.</br></br></br>  <br>Depends, what sort of anime do you like. If you like racism and oppression interspersed with multiple personalities and mechs, you'd probably like it.</br>  <br>Legend of the Galactic Heroes-lite</br>  <br>I have watched it. Several years ago, when I didn't even know /a/ existed. I don't remember anything of it at all except for basic plot details, and I'm wondering if it's worth a rewatch.<br><br>Call me a faggot but I don't like mechs.</br></br></br>  <br>Then read the manga - the anime added in Knightmare frames completely, which is weird because it's a pretty major plot point.</br>  <br>It's by fatalpulse</br>  <br>Faggot.</br>  Reminder Miraculous Birthday is canon and Lelouch was a ghost in it.  <br> pretty good <br>Actually sounds like shit.</br></br>  <br>I don't know what the fuss is about sex. Have had sex a couple of times and it didn't feel good. In fact I can't feel much of anything. My dick is average sized, so it can't be because I'm small and she was a virgin, so it can't be because she's too lose.<br><br>I'm disappointed, society lied to me. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, Lelouch didn't miss out on much,</br></br></br>  <br>I thought he died a virgin because someone cockblocked the planned sex scene with Kallen.</br>  Hello men  <br>hi big$$</br>  Go away nerd  <br>Read the rules big money before posting isana with no topic</br>  <br>Hello, Isana-chan.
