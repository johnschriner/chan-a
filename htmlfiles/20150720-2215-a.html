Also rociante a dead  Secret Trafalgar D. Water Law a sad thread   Speaking of Sanji's training, how far into the Grand Line did Zeff get? Was he a New World pirate or did he just fuck around in Paradise before heading back?<br><br>Being a New World pirate would explain why Sanji is so goddamn strong right out of the Baratie</br></br>  <br>He knew the Grand Line was called Paradise so either he just met a lot of NW rejects or he at least got a taste of the New World.</br>  <br> OP thread baiting lesson one </br>  What character do you think he has his wife roleplay as?  <br>Nami, because she actually played nami ones.</br>  I feel for all the tomboys in the world who were born with huge tits and have to carry unnecessary additional weight when doing sports and feel embarassed when someone compliments them on their huge funbags  <br> big breasted tomboys are the best <br>Objectively wrong.</br></br>  <br>I love titty tomboys and Asuka is the tittiest tomboy in tekken</br>  <br>Depends, OP's description is stupidly accurate (especially if you're small and slim) and sleeping comfortable is also something you'd have to somehow figure out.</br>  <br>  I'd welcome the teasing if I got to be that big. <br><br>I'll tease you anon</br></br></br>  <br>It's been a lifelong struggle of flat for me.

I can't bring myself to drop it for some reason though.<br> Dropped <br>Prison School and Monster Musume until BDs. Does anyone know if Triage X BDs are out? I've put that on hold because of censorship as well.<br> Picked up because of /a/ <br>I'm considering the show with the trap with the nice butt, but if the premise is boring I may put it down again.<br> Best Girl <br>Wakana Ui, Nancy Lee<br> Worst Girl <br>Kajo Ayame, hot, but the humor of a grade school student thinking crass humor is 'cool'<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128331687#p128337450">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> -What are you watching? <br>Akagami<br>Charlotte<br>Drrr<br>Gakkou<br>Gate<br>Imas CG<br>Jitsu wa<br>Joukamachi<br>NNB<br>Shokugeki<br>Sore ga Seiyuu<br>Umaru<br>Wakaba Girl<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128331687#p128338768">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   -What are you watching? <br>Pic + Prisma<br><br> -What is your favorite show so far? <br>Shirayukihime<br><br> -What's your' least favorite show so far? <br>Milion Doll<br><br> -What have you already dropped? <br>Chaos Dragon<br><br> -Did you pick up anything due to a thread on /a/?

She would have preferred that it happened to ALL her friends? Fuck this bitch, she deserved it.</br>  <br>How come so many people get raped in mental hospitals? it's like where as prison rape only happen in the US, hospital rape happens everywhere.</br>  <br>No man, not everything has to be about rape.</br>  <br>The cure for hysteria is dick</br>  <br>Well they are mental so they can't fight back and no one is going to believe some crack pot when they say that the head nurse touched their peepee. Some of the worst cases I have heard of was the general neglect mixed with some verbal and physical abuse alongside a helping dose of rape. They are vulnerable and people could less as to what happens to them. Of course not all hospitals are like that.</br>  <br>um.. but.. but i already put that. the holding hands part.</br>   ITT: Draw an Animu Character as vaguely as possible and let others guess who is he <br><br>I'l start.</br></br>  <br>fujoshit pls <br><br>But correct <br><br><br>Right</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>But unlike her Ranma is shit</br>  <br>all trannies are shit</br>  Here we go.<br><br><br><br>It's supposed to be vague dumbkopf.</br></br></br></br>  Instead of always harping on a man's faults, tell him of his virtues. Try to pull him out of his rut of bad habits. Hold up to him his better self, his  /ai/ - Idle Activities  that can dare and do and win out.  <br>Did they just imply that Crowd High was developed as a part of MKUltra? That's hilarious.</br>         Vampire Butt   Why was this sixteen episodes long?  Because Satelight wanted to optimize their profits. All of Kyon's autism we saw could have been summarized in an OVA.  <br>Because good series needs more episodes + OVA</br>  <br><br>Because there is no endless 8 episodes, so 24 - 8 = 16</br></br>  Because it's Endless Eight 2: Attack of the Clones    Elves are for ____?  Guys help, my elf suggested letting me touch her ears on our first date, is this a red warning flag? She played it off like it wouldn't be a big deal, but I sort of get the feeling it's the equivalent of doing anal with a guy after only meeting him the day before.  <br>I wouldn't know, I don't do anal with guys.</br>  <br>What are you, gay or something?</br>  <br>This was the only decent girl in that stupid show.</br>  <br>It's more like foreplay. Do it right and you'll be using her ears as handlebars while she goes down on you.</br>  Because the mod deleted the last one for whatever stupid reason. <br><br>Four days left, what do you expect to happen?</br></br>  WHY THERE IS NO ANIME OR FILM CONTINUATION?  <br>There should be a new anime that skips over the golden age with miuras art style. And for fucks sake, no cg unless its for demons.</br>  <br>I would pay top money for a Berserk adaptation by KyoAni where everyone is even more moe. The rage and shitstorm on /a/ alone would make it worth the price.<br><br>Isn't the story approaching its end though? I mean he can finish all the loose ends in 2-3 tanks right now and I imagine he has a plan about how to finish it.</br></br></br>  <br> Berserk <br> Moe <br><br>Even for shits and giggles, its not worth it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Supposely, they will release a fourth film covering the Black Swordsman Arc, maybe a trilogy covering the Conviction arc.<br><br>But there's been no talks this year, I hope they pick up the project (again) next year.</br></br></br></br></br>   Kyaaaa!         <br>I'm kind of sure he means Lina from Dota 2, not the original... but you probably knew that.<br><br><br>Post your Sento figures.</br></br></br></br>    Rin is stupid, ugly and probably smells bad.  I-I actually like both Luvia and Rin and hope for a yuri ending at some point.  <br>Luvia is rude.</br>  <br>The ending of season 2 with both of them in the car was pretty good.</br>  There are two Shirous now in Prisma. Rin will win the Prisma one, and Luvia will win the Miyu one. They will fight over which is better.  Official.  Can we have OPM thread? Manned up and caught up to original manga. <br>Will anything ever be able to scratch the guy or it will destroy the joke?</br></blockquote>]
