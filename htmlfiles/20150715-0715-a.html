[ Is this guy autistic?  Yes  <br>Is OP autistic?</br>  Pre-2000 Anime Thread<br><br>What are some old anime you are currently watching? Or if you're watching nothing what is your favorite?<br><br>I just downloaded Mobile Suit Gundam and Zeta. What am I in for, I have never watched a single Gundam.<br><br>Also Finished Ie Naki Ko some time ago and I didn't really like the ending.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Watch every single Gundam in production order up to and including Turn A.<br><br>Then watch GBF and G-Reco.<br><br>You can ignore the rest of the franchise. It's all ranging from mediocre to garbage.</br></br></br></br>  Watched Download: Namu Amida Butsu wa Ai no Uta. It doesn't have any subs sadly, but it was an interesting watch nonetheless. Kinda trippy at some points.<br><br><br> What am I in for <br><br>Two fantastic war stories featuring children and giant robots. If you plan on watching more Gundam after those, don't expect the same tone in the following series, ZZ.</br></br></br></br></br>  Very nearly done with the Urusei Yatsura TV series. Then it's onto the movies and OVAs.  I'm also currently downloading the 1080p rip of Utena and it's nearly finished. I'm wondering how can I permanently add subs the the episodes without having to to that every episode?  <br>If you mean not having to load the sub file every single time, then just save them in same folder with the same filenames as the videos.</br>  <br> every single Gundam in production order up to and including Turn A <br> ignore the rest of the franchise. It's all ranging from mediocre to garbage <br>But Wing, G and X are also mediocre to garbage.<br><br><br>I've tried getting into Urusei Yatsura to satiate a need for more Oshii, but it feels kind of slow. Does it pick up, or should I skip straight to the movies Oshii directed?<br><br><br> What am I in for <br>Basically the two best Gundam series. The animation is of course very dated and there is a fair bit of weekly toy fight in them, but the stories and characters for both series are the best in the franchise.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>G is easily one of the top three best Gundams.<br>X is wasted potential since it was canceled, but it wasn't a bad show.<br>Wing is mediocre but still better than most other AUs.<br><br>Turn A is the best Gundam, and you're going to enjoy it a lot more if you see these three first because of all the references, so they're worth watching just because of that, if anything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't super into 0079 but Zeta is a pretty solid show. I'm currently watching ZZ and  I'm liking it more than both of them. </br>  <br>MKVToolNix. It's also handy for making certain audio or sub tracks the primary ones, if you've downloaded a dual audio release or something.</br>  <br> you're going to enjoy it a lot more if you see these three first because of all the references <br>Pretty much the only reference that matters is DG cells, aside from that you get glimpses of the Gundam X and I think ONE glimpse of an MS from Wing. Nobody needs to see them to enjoy Turn A.<br><br> G is easily one of the top three best Gundams. <br>If you like Dragonball Z maybe. Personally I hate it, but I respect that a lot of people like it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rewatching Serial Experiments Lain.<br><br>I don't know why I do this to myself every year, the ending depresses me for weeks.</br></br></br>  Ie Naki Ko's last episode is what I figured Bahamut's ending reminded me of the other thread.  <br> X <br> mediocre to garbage <br><br>x was good</br></br></br></br>  Speaking of Gundam I finished G about 2 days ago. Was legit as fuck. The last episode was actually really fucking good.<br><br>Why is Allenby so perfect?</br></br>  <br>Why do the best girls always lose?</br>  <br>Anyone else downloaded the Shoujo Kakumei Utena 1997 torrent? wondering if the flac files in there are needed for anything?</br>  Space Runway Ideon<br>the pacing feels really off for some reason, but overall not too bad so far</br>  <br>Best girl won the Jew's Dough in ZZ though.</br>  Just watching some Toei moeshit.    <br> What are some old anime you are currently watching? <br>Was watching Dunbine but the amount of laser spam and the lack of everything else in the later parts lead to a break.<br> I just downloaded Mobile Suit Gundam and Zeta <br> What am I in for <br> I have never watched a single Gundam <br>You start with 0079 you uncultured swine.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   G is good and one of the best Gundam <br> X is good  <br><br>Off to a rocky start.</br></br></br>  <br>You are a weird guy, I found ZZ to be a huge step down from Z</br>  <br>She should have saved and won the best boy in all of Gundam, our lord and savior Glemy.<br>Judau deserved to suffer with Elle, but Elle didn't deserve to suffer with fucking Beecha.</br></br>  <br>Only PHG is allowed to say PHG things.</br>  <br>I watched ZZ immediately after finish Zeta so the change in pacing and the atmosphere was pretty jarring.<br><br>But by the time I finished ZZ, I liked it more than Zeta. <br><br>Also, 4chan is a pretty contrarian site and since Zeta is the most popular Gundam, a lot of people are tired of zetafags and pretend they prefer ZZ instead to annoy them. This attitude comes and goes, especially on /m/.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shut the heck up Basara.</br></br>  <br>I liked Zeta but there's something about it and 0079 that feels really weird. The character interactions felt stilted and didn't flow very well. This wasn't as big a problem for Zeta, though. I feel the lighthearted ZZ flows a lot better and is more enjoyable to watch.</br>  <br>The encodes bakabt have for that are horrible and basically scrub all watercolor texture out of the pretty backgrounds.</br>  <br>Why does this loli have herpes?</br>  Since I've been replaying SRW MX I decided to rewatch Machine Robo: Revenge of Cronos.<br><br>It's still as good as ever.<br>If you want some cheesy 80's robot show it's the probably one of the best of that decade.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Acting completely inhuman and like whacky cartoon characters flowed better?</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  Is Hades Project Zeorymer any good?  <br>It's kinda subpar for a super robot show but yeah it's nice.<br><br>The MC is basically a proto Shinji for most things, the robots are cool and the music is good, the plot and characters tend to go a bit full retard sometimes, especially on the villains' side, also the first episodes are kinda slow but the series build up well around the middle.<br><br>Though each time Zeorymer is activated you'll probably get pretty hype.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KkF<wbr>13YQkPx0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Orguss 02<br><br>The robot stuff is kind of meh, but I like the dark atmosphere</br></br></br>  <br>CCS is better than all of them.</br>  <br> TL;DR Gundam by Tomino Kawaii </br>  I watched this movie called "Birth" last night. The ending was cool but otherwise it was pretty shit. The animators seriously gave no fucks about proportion.  Finished G Gundam and Ashita no Joe 2. G Gundam was really good, enjoyed it far more than any Gundam since 0079 (have been watching in production order since mid-June) though the second half had a lot of "Wow, really?" moments. <br>Ashita no Joe 2 had a rocky start, what with them retconning the entire last 30 episodes of the first series, but I liked the serious tone a lot more than the first series. It didn't have as memorable of a soundtrack as the first series, but it was still very good. The ending was excellent, though Joe's self-destructive actions mirroring Rikiishi's annoyed me and pleased me at the same time.<br><br>Currently watching Wing, will finish the last 9 episodes later today, and it's not as bad as people say. 40 episodes in and there hasn't been anything that really impressed me, but nor has there been anything that I thought was incredibly bad (aside from a few "euugh" reactions to some outstanding QUALITY). It's not bad, just not very good either. The soundtrack lacks the "oomph" G Gundam and Victory had, and there's a lack of any emotionally charged scenes. The world building is commendable though, as the conflict is very clear and defined as opposed to the previous Gundams, excluding G Gundam. The first OP is nice though, and reminds me of Utena's OP for some reason.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ljX<wbr>FL4dyDIk</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gRn<wbr>m-769QLE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>And when I talk about memorable soundtrack for Ashita no Joe, I mean these tracks<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6Bf<wbr>jKgLHET0</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gBK<wbr>B0Ufu7ic</wbr>  [ ]<br>I've had the second ED stuck in my head for weeks now.<br><br>On that note, post your favourite pre-2000 OSTs. I'd be interested to see others' favourites</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only watched Ashita no Joe 2, probably the best Dezaki show closely followed by Space Cobra which has probably the best BD I have seen so far.<br>Man, I love old anime in glorious 1080p.</br></br>  <br>I'm 5 episodes into ZZ and am having trouble getting through it. Can't seem to sit down and watch it like with the first two series last year.</br>  <br>buy dianna soriel is the best girl.</br>  <br>MACHI O TSUTSUMUUUUUUUU<br> <br>WHAT GOING OOOOOOOON</br> </br></br>  <br>Episodes 1-17 have nearly zero plot.</br>  <br>Those are bread jam, anon.</br>  <br>Any better torrent then?</br>  <br>There were raws on nyaa but the torrent is dead now and they were raw in the first place. They might look bad but they're the only option so I'm not the one to bitch really.</br>  <br><br>Oh my, that ending!</br></br>  <br>The 1080p version that HorribleSubs ripped from CR for Ashita no Joe 2 looked beautiful as well, even if it had some of the tell tale signs of being a stream rip. I really want to watch the Space Cobra BDs, since I've only seen the film, which itself looked quite good. Have you seen the TurnA BDs? I'm downloading the 1080p EG encode off of bakabt now, and the screenshots for it look great as well.<br>Why do BD remasters for old shows look so much better than BDs of a lot of recent shows? I don't think I've ever been actually impressed by the visuals or artwork of what people would call "modern anime".</br></br>  <br>2bogi4me</br>  I'm rewatching the D'Arby episode of the Jojo OVA for the umpteenth time. The OVA fights apart from Vanilla Ice feel much more tense and dramatic than the TV anime.  <br><br>I'm actually watching that show, and it wasn't meant as a reaction image.</br></br>  <br>Make sure to watch the first (and if possible the second) Origins OVA after the first coeur of 0079 at the 13 episode mark, it makes the frankly shitty second coeur much better.</br>  <br> Implying Elle is not best girl </br>  <br>boring autistic mecha fights</br>  <br>I'm watching Cowboy Bebop, an anime I never finished, and then I'll probably give Cyber City Oedo 808 a shot. I need to find time to watch VOTOMS' Space Vietnam arc.</br>  <br> Mobile Suit Gundam <br>The birth of Real Robot, corny but decent.<br> Zeta <br>The epitome of Tomino, great world construction and mech design, terrible understanding of human beings and women in general. Char is literally the only sane person in the series.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oniisama e... Is the best dezaki show.</br>  <br>Nice meme opinions, do you parrot everything you see other people say?</br>  Watching Rose of Versailles right now.<br>The parts about von Fersen really annoy me for some reason.</br>  I just finished Turn A.<br><br>That shit was good.<br><br> FUCK POLE, THOUGH! HOW THE FUCK DID THAT GENOCIDAL MONSTER NOT SUFFER FOR ALL THE SHIT SHE PULLED?! YES, I FUCKING MAD!! </br></br></br></br>  <br>That was my honest assessment after watching the show.</br>  <br><br><br>Indeed.<br>They NEVER mention that Char goes insane for some reason for Char's Counterattack.</br></br></br></br>  maison ikkoku and legend of the galactic heroes<br>i started watching logth but got sidetracked and dropped it,then later started watching maison ikkoku and dropped that.. now im watching logth again.<br>maison ikkoku is an alright anime imo. it's not bad but not really top tier either, just alright that<br>legends i like but i haven't watched too many of the series yet. only up to episode 30 or so, still good series.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, I wasn't talking about Char's Counterattack, I was talking about Zeta.</br>  <br>And what comes after ZZ?</br>  <br>Why does that matter? When I talk about MSG Zeta I'm not talking about CCA, or 0079, or the OVAs, or ZZ, or Turn A. I'm talking about Zeta. On it's own.</br>  <br>I guess I should try to get over this hurdle then.</br>  Green Lupin is best Lupin  "Lovely Angels"  <br>It's one of my favorites as well but I feel like the drama in the beginning is way over the top. Probably something I would enjoy more with a second watch.</br>  What show has the best BD remaster? Outlaw Star?  <br><br>It's pretty melodramatic throughout, never taking a step back for more than a episode at a time. The worst offender is Miya and her love, which is near the end of the series. Still, it's my second favorite Dezaki (though I've only seen 4).</br></br>  <br><br>What I said here. </br></br>  <br> great world construction <br>You dont actually believe this, do you? Zeta's biggest flaw apart from the incredibly fast pace and hordes of inconsequential characters is the fact that there was little to no world development or depth at all.</br></br>  <br><br> Zeta <br> Incredibly fast paced <br><br>That's just a stupid thing to say.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the art reminds me of popolocrois</br>  <br>I find its fairly love or hate if you can accept the melodrama and love it's ridiculousness you'll love it. If you can't hate.</br>  <br>Moeshit only started with K-on! and Lucky Star.</br>  <br>Why? They try and squeeze in too much in a 50 episode series, most of which is ultimately made completely irrelevant by every single series made after it.</br>  <br> Pic related <br>It came out in 96 I think, it's still better then some of the crap that's came out recently.<br> I downloaded Gundam 0079 and Zeta Gundam <br> Never watched Gundam, is it good? <br>Those are 2 of the better series out of them all. If you don't mind the older animation. If that's not an issue I'll just say pretty to have you life become amazing</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Given how Dezaki's style only serves to highlight that aspect, it would be hard to stick with it if you couldn't accept it.<br><br><br><br> Zeta was made irrelevant immediately <br> ZZ's major story events are only possible because of Zeta's major story events </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Before anyone asks.  <br>I said "most of which". <br>Haman and Axis-Zeon only appeared in episode 30, and only the events of the last 15 or so episodes were relevant to anything in ZZ. Barely anything that happened in both was relevant to CCA. Even Amuro's love interest, Beltorchika, the focus of several episodes was completely replaced in CCA. There is no overall consistency between the series, because Zeta was poorly thought out.</br></br>  I just finished Macross in  English dub <br>That's about it</br>  <br>  racist designs listed in negatives for G Gundams </br>  <br>Why didn't you post the more accurate one?</br>  <br>Did those two ever fuck? Because Relena had a massive wide-on for Heero.</br>  <br>been working my way through the mecha genre since I've seen so little of it. finished gun/diebuster, now about to start watching giant robo: the animation. I have a hard time getting into franchises with tens of different releases, so gundam is gonna take a while for me to actually pick up</br>  Who likes Vampire Hunter D?<br><br>I don't know if anybody has too strong an opinion on this but, I feel that Vampire Hunter D (1985 film) was inferior to the sequel, ‎Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust.<br><br>And I have yet to read the novels yet.</br></br></br></br>  This is a series that I'm disappointed has never been adapted into an anime.<br><br>That being said, we do have a bunch of live action movies, and tv series.</br></br>  <br> I feel that Vampire Hunter D (1985 film) was inferior to the sequel, ‎Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust. <br><br>Everyone agrees.<br><br>Also, nice relevant trips.</br></br></br></br></br>  I still have to watch Evangelion. I've never, ever, watched it. Currently still going through Gundam G.  <br> on 4chan <br> hasn't watched NGE </br></br>  <br> ~ Little Memole | Little Beret Memoru | Memoru in the Pointed Hat | Wee Wendy | Tongari Boushi no Memoru |  <br> One year ago the pint-sized Memoru and a few hundred of her people crash landed their spaceship on Earth. They've since been living on a lake island, with only the large objects that wash ashore as their knowledge of humans. One day, young Memoru and her friends head towards the sound of beautiful music and find a huge house with an equally huge human girl inside. Memoru wants nothing more than to be this girl's friend, but she soon discovers that the girl is sick. Heartbroken, Memoru cries on her would-be friend's face, miraculously healing her - and thus their friendship begins. Together with her people, Memoru experiences life on Earth with a smile and meets plenty of new companions along the way. <br>Where have you been all my life</br></br></br>    <br>Finally started watching LoGH the other day, it's good so far.</br>  Anyone knows where I can get subs for Sei Jushi Bismarck, Tobikage and subs for the BD rips of SPT Layzner?  <br>A little bit confunsing, the MC, as other anon said, is a proto Shinji and I don't like the ending, but the animation is good (for a somewhat obscure 80's OVA), the mechas are great and the battles are very good</br>  <br>Absolute garbage except when Zeorymer is on screen<br>So like a 4/10 overall. At worst you'll waste two hours laughing your ass off and how much of a dick the villain is.</br></br>  <br> Bismarck <br>Enable subtitles on Saber Rider<br> Tobikage <br>Hong Kong or you can wait for Discotek, I personally have very little faith in them getting it released on a timely fashion<br> Layzner <br>Rip the subs off the DVD .mkvs and apply them to the BDs. The one minute of research I did indicates the timing is slightly off</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Re-watching Orphen  in spanish dub <br>I wonder why they didn't make a second season.</br>  whaddup  <br>Thanks!</br>  I'm going through the Galaxy Express TV series and Ashita no Joe now. They're good, but I think I'll watch something lighter after these. They're not the happiest of series.  <br>Saber Rider is just a joke you know, Saber Rider with subtitles is just going to be subbed Saber Rider. Nobody really gives a shit about Bismarck. At some point in the past the entire series was on youtube subbed but it ain't there no more</br>  I'm watching the first Macross now. <br>Really liking it. The focus on the characters and romance is nice and the fights are cool. <br>The QUALITY is insane, but I guess that's to be expected.<br>That dream episode was fucking trippy.</br></br></br>  <br>Did you enjoy Metal Max Solid: Tactical Valkyrie Action?</br>  Is Dallos any good?  <br>You mean when he was disguised in the enemy ship? Yeah, that was fun. <br>On that note, Max is awesome. Ace pilot, handsome, charming. This nigga's going to steal the show.</br></br>  <br>The novels are alright, Kawajiri is a perfect director for the series, and could really animate them.</br>  <br>He does, he's way better than Hikaru. DYRL Hikaru is way better than the TV version though. By, you know, having an actual personality.<br><br>By the way,  KYUN KYUN </br></br></br>  <br>I didn't like it at all, dropped it halfway through, didn't like any of the characters, especially minmay and the plot seem kinda ridiculous. With the giant aliens vs the tiny humans.<br><br>Too bad, wanted to get into it, could I just watch Do You remember Love?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't remember seeing nothing but the first episode subbed on YT. A shame the only subbed 80's mecha series there is Golion, wich is pretty mediocre at best.</br>  <br>DYRL is the movie right? Is it meant to be a sequel or a sort of Rebuild type thing?</br>  <br> that spoiler <br><br>Goddamnit, couldn't they have used different songs, that one got annoying pretty much after the first time.</br></br></br>  <br>Why would watching a different version of the same plot be different if you find the aliens ridiculous?</br>  <br>I like it. But I just got past the episode where  Focker dies  and they played Silver Moon, Red Moon which I like a lot more.</br>  <br>I blame this series for getting me to fap to chinese cartoons.</br>  <br>Crest of the Stars, my reaction is:<br><br>where have you been all my life?</br></br></br>  <br>prepare urself for an entire episode of kaifun fighting aliens and the transition of the first macross into a kung fu battle series</br>  <br>It's basically a remake of the middle bit of the series. <br><br><br>Okay, no KYUN KYUN, but how about  SHAO PAI LONG </br></br></br></br>  <br>What<br>I thought Kaifun hated fighting<br>what does kung fu have to do with robots</br></br></br>  <br>SHAO<br>PAI<br>LONG</br></br></br>  <br>Even though I don't like I still have that feeling that I want to know how it ends, a movie is certainly easier to watch than another 13 episodes.<br><br>Mind spoiling me how it plays out, I dropped after some of the aliens shrunk themselves and were sent to the Macross.</br></br></br>  <br>The most I can tell you is that the movie doesn't play out the same way and the show goes on for several episodes after the end of the war.</br>  <br>Kaifun is actually Shao Pai Long, the last successor to an ancient Chinese martial art used for assassination. He rejects fighting due to his harsh training but when the Zentradi kill Shammy after she personally sorties to save a giant space fish, he forsakes his beliefs and starts a one man war against the entire fleet while being careful to not expend too much power and accidentally destroy the Macross in the process. This was not popular with the otaku of the 80s, hence the series transition into plane robots and musicexclusively</br>  <br>Ridiculous is the name of the macross game. If you disliked that about sdf, you will not like the rest, save for zero, which is boring garbage.</br>  <br><br>What am I reading</br></br>  <br>Plus is slightly more series than the rest, somehow. And is fantastic.</br>  <br>True, but I don't think anyone who hates sdf deserves plus.</br>  <br> series <br>Fuck me, I meant serious obviously</br></br>  <br> Watch every single Gundam in production order up to and including Turn A. <br>  in production order <br> production order <br>Fuck you</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish this would amp up the space epic stuff and tone down the human boy and his perfect curious noble alien girlfriend stuff faster. I mean sure that's what many love but just don't care a bit and feel slightly misled.</br>  <br>How do all of those lead to Turn A?<br>Especially G.</br></br>  Watched Gunbuster last week, was good as fuck.<br>I want to watch some more 80s mecha.</br>  <br>Turn X literally has Shining Finger</br>  <br>Go watch Ideon<br><br>The TV series then Be Invoked, blurays are out up to episode 20-something right now, and Be Invoked has had blurays for a while.</br></br></br>  <br>What?</br>  So, i've never watched any Gundam. Yes, not even Wing (didn't have Cartoon Network when it aired, had shitty local cable with ten channels)<br><br>What should I watch? Does it matter in what order? I really love the art in pics like OP's and I want more of that.</br></br>  <br/>  Dropped Victory recently, probably the worst Gundam I've seen so far. Going chronologically from 0079 to Reconguista.<br><br>Also picked up Dragon Ball, mostly because of influence it had but also my friend has been hyping up Super. It's pretty fun so far, I expected it to be utter shit.</br></br>  <br>I liked Victory<br>Great mech designs, fight choreography, and music. The characters and story were pretty shallow though.</br></br>  <br>Watch 0079, don't listen to anyone who tells you to just watch the compilation movies. They're a good summary if you watched the series already but don't watch them for a first watch cause they do skip shit.</br>  <br>Considering that I'm almost finished with the damn thing, yeah, it picks up.</br>  <br>fuck outta here hothead</br>  <br>I'll give you designs and music but choreography?<br>It was more creative than last few series thanks to some new elements of mobile suits and pilots utilized them far more but most of the fights are standard Gundam affair which is pretty boring. You get a shot of someone firing then a shot of someone either dodging or getting shot at. Tomino keeps reusing and adding some interesting moments to fight but he can't really depict them properly.</br></br>  <br>I thought the creative parts added to the choreography. Seeing Uso launch a part of the victory to throw off an enemy was cool. There was also that part where an enemy tries to attack the victory from behind, but Uso uses his thrusters to counter it and rotates his head to use the vulcans.<br>It was pretty imaginative compared to the other gundams.</br></br>  I just finished Panzer World Galient. It was alright - mechs with rollerskates can't really go wrong.<br><br>Seeing a villian being justified and somewhat sympathetic was good too - Mardoul was probably the most compelling character in the story. Unlike the standard CHARs seen in mecha anime, he wasn't just crazy. Nor was he a Char.</br></br>  <br>It was imaginative and that can be said about a lot of things Tomino made, I think. But outside of those parts fighting was severely fucked thanks to Tomino's direction.</br>  <br> 666 <br><br>i like this<br><br><br>Also i watched Wings of Homnneaise today for the first time and i was really nice. A bit slow paced sometimes for today maybe but i still liked every second.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Just finished episode episode 16 of Utena. Am I the only one that keeps forgetting that they are middle school students? The way they look and act seems like that of someone much older. <br><br>Also, Nanami is best girl   that episode where she turned into a cow seemed really weird and out of place  </br></br>  <br>Fair enough.<br>From what I've seen Victory is one of the more 'love or hate it' types of Gundams.</br></br>  <br>I thought they were highschool students?</br>  <br>Nope. Utena and Mickey have mentioned being middle school freshmen, and I'm assuming the rest of the characters are around the same age.</br>  <br>Am I the only one who thought that the comedy episodes with Nanami were funny or the comedy in general? Those elephants, man.<br><br>Also, I finished downloading the 1080p rip and put the subs on them, can't wait to rewatch it like this.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, that makes some of the later twists pretty awkward.</br>  <br>If Utena were a highschool student it wouldn't have counted as  rape when Akio sexed her </br>  <br>I agree that they were funny, the fact that she literally turned into a cow was strange to see</br>  <br>I liked the curry episode, but the egg and cowbell episodes were just weird.</br>  i've started watching Nadia, but i can't really get into it. <br><br>also downloaded Slam Dunk in 720p rips, but haven't gotten around to it. Love the OP, tho.</br></br>  <br>Mickey's sister Kozue is already a huge fucking slut in her first year of middle school. So yeah, it's pretty weird</br>  <br>There was a lot of unique tactics in Victory. The shoulder beams and wires on the Zoloats, the washing pole and saber wall, etc. But yes, there was a great deal of the same old of Uso trying to shoot a Mobile Suit and missing a few times until it finally hits. Especially during the initial venture into space, where he's completely unaware of how to handle battles.<br><br><br>Victory had some nice Mobile Suits. Almost all of the grunts look good.</br></br></br></br>  <br> he didn't get the metaphor of her turning into a cow. <br>better quit now, you're watching it wrong.</br></br>  <br>Nadia gets better as the show goes on aside from a lot of the island arc. Prepare for Nadia being a bitch.<br><br>Slam Dunk is fucking fantastic though.</br></br></br>  <br>Nanami was my favourite character.

Why'd Homura send Madoka to America of all places for those three years?  <br><br>So she could develop the same natural affinity for firearms and explosives as Homura. Her plan was to bond over how great guns are and then fuck her with the barrel of a mosin nagant.</br></br>  So that Madoka could experience freedom before Homura took it away.  They're all part of Kyouko's harem, Homu is second in command  <br>Pandering to the high amount of overseas fans.</br>   wake up <br> curse of of 4chan <br><br>Oh well. Madoka's worst subject is english so Homura used the opportunity to have her go to America for a few years to learn better.</br></br></br>  <br> Not the barrel of a M1 Garand <br>Don't act like you know us, commie scum.</br></br>  <br>Kyouko's only harem is  the food on that table. </br>  Homura is worst girl.  Because it's the greatest country in the world.  <br>No Sayaka is</br>  <br>Homura, Sayaka and Mami are worst girls</br>  <br>I would have agreed if you didn't throw Mami in there</br>  <br>Why did the movie exist only to fuck the already amazing end? fuck it</br>  Post best girl who will one day kill Homura for betraying her  <br>If she has the heart to do so.</br>  <br>I can't help but see that picture as something to do with smoking weed.</br>  <br> The marriage equality </br>  <br>I like the way you think.</br>  <br>So fluffy</br>  So she could shit post on 4chan  <br>Related<br><a href="https://i.4cdn.org/f/sayaka_dropped_the_flag_2.swf" target="_blank">https://i.4cdn.org/f/sayaka_dropped<wbr>_the_flag_2.swf</wbr></a></br></br>  <br>I don't see it</br>  <br>It's mostly the really cheery expression coupled with floating green stuff.</br>  <br>That's something only people who smoke weed or is around weed culture would think.</br>  <br>I never seen someone high.</br>  <br>She wanted more Madoka, the easiest way was to rewrite time so she lived in Murrica for a few years. Unfortunately, her stay at home dad made sure she kept a balanced diet.</br>  <br>You want Madoka to look like this?</br>  <br>I'm suggesting Homura did.<br><br>However, that shit is adorable.</br></br></br>  <br>More Madoka means a happy Homu</br>  <br><br>Funny part is, Madoka is canonically a Big Eater.</br></br>  Reminder that Homu did literally everything wrong.  <br> Why'd Homura send Madoka to America <br>what?</br></br>  <br>You saw Rebellion?</br>  <br>So they could fuck and get married? I'm not sure myself.</br>  Because she wants Madoka to learn how homosexuality can become accepted and legal.  <br>In Homura's recreated universe Madoka was in the US for a while before moving back to Japan.</br>    <br>Homura says it was so she could remove Madoka from her friendships that already existed, so that Homura could be the only person in her school life she could rely on.<br><br>She wouldn't erase Madoka's family, though, that would be too cruel. Even for a Devil.</br></br></br>  <br> If she has the heart to do so. <br>I highly doubt she has the heart to kill Homura anyways.</br></br>  <br>Plus, she kind of needs Madoka's parents so that they can, y'know, make a Madoka.<br><br> Though, I don't think Tatsuya is necessary for that, so his continued existance is an enigma <br><br><br>Madoka broke down into tears upon killing Mami to save Homura and herself in one timeline. She'd probably pull the metaphorical trigger if backed into a corner, but I don't foresee a situation like that occurring. Odds are we're getting a Friendship end of some form.<br><br>And I'm ok with that, as long as it's written well. And this is Madoka, so that's a foregone conclusion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Madoka is sweet. She only killed Mami because she saw how she was going to kill them after Mami killed Kyouko.</br>  <br> as long as it's written well <br>This is where a huge problem could lie in a sense of "you can't please everyone". It could be well written to you but to someone else they'll call out for blood.</br></br>  <br>Put down the rabid dog.</br>  <br>True enough. Still, I wager if it's on par with Rebellion, or even better, then it'd be a success. I guess we'll just have to let time tell.</br>  <br>To legalize gay marriage. Homura is already thinking long term.</br>    <br>You're a rabid dog.</br>  <br>Sorry but Mami's the one that broke down, there.</br>  <br>The notion of Madoka acting out some petty revenge fantasy is so silly. I doubt Homura can be simply overpowered anyway.</br>  Bigger question is what state was she in? <br><br>I vote Minnesota.</br></br>  <br>Obviously, San Francisco.</br>  <br>Forgot to mention California.</br>  <br>The state of Maine.</br>  <br>South Carolina.</br>  <br> mfw she visits sunshine state <br><br>I really wonder what state she lived in.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Not even the best Carolina</br></br>    <br> Implying <br>Your flag will never be this cool looking</br></br>  <br>Isn't it Kyouko?</br>  <br>Both, actually. We just don't see Madoka eating as much.</br>  <br>Texas, if homu wanted her to love freedom and guns then she would be in the best state. Not the the faggot ass states</br>  <br> boring, genuine answer <br>So that Madoka could spend some time in Homura's shoes, and so that Homu could welcome Madoka back without it seeming strange.</br></br>  <br>But anon, they're ALL faggot ass states now.</br>  <br>Another homu thread...praise the true goddesses homu for this..</br>    <br>Texas is least gay. Still a faggot ass state thanks to faggot asses.</br>  <br>why was she in the US?</br>  <br>That's the question.</br>  <br>We really lack Homu these days. Feels like the movies gave us lots of anti-fans.</br>  <br>Next movie when?</br>  <br>In 20 XX </br>  <br>No idea but I think it involves Junko's line of work.<br><br><br>Never, possibly.</br></br></br></br>  <br>War was Beginning.</br>  <br>Well, with advances in the medical field, I just might live to see it.</br>  <br>Worst girl</br>  <br>There are 1.5 madoka threads a day and they usually get derailed into homu threads.

You'd look really gross to her as well.</br>  <br>Nah, I don't really get her role in the story besides to cockblock rito in that household. I mean I don't hate her and i'm turned on by her. But her presence is a hindrance to all Momo could be doing to Rito's dick and body as a whole.</br>  Needs more Yui?

Don't worry anon, my autism is equal to all.</br>  <br>Because that's not a thing in anything other than the first game.</br>  This was the best anime scene.  <br>Disgusting cowtits.</br>    <br>I wish I was Vert's imouto.<br>I would sit in her lap as we played video games together and fall asleep resting my head on her big titties.</br></br>  Why do people like this?  I DEMAND MORE UZUME LEWDS  <br>One day you will be the imouto anon.</br>  <br>It's cute and fun</br>  <br>It's a somewhat mediocre game series with a bunch of fun characters, with some nice self-deprecating humor. And that's it for the most part, but that still makes it quite a bit better than the majority in my opinion.<br><br> The developers are also not as dickish as some certain companies  CoughTalesCough  and admit their games are kind of shitty and they've made actual attempts to improve them. So I give them props for that.<br><br>I actually felt the need to buy a PS4 when VII was announced, which is pretty sad if you think about it. Though considering the trend of all the re;birth games getting PC ports, I'm wondering whether or not I should just wait. <br><br>How's the performance for the PS4 if anybody minds me asking? I remember playing them on PS3 and there were some major framedrops and shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I haven't noticed any significant issues with VII so far, but I'm probably not the best source on this since I haven't had the time to put more than a couple hours into it since I picked it up.</br>  <br>Uzume's feet are lewd.</br>  <br>Orange Heart is unexpectedly stacked</br>  I just finished this and now I kind of want to play the games. Which shoukd I start with, the PS3 games or the Vita games?  <br>Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One.</br>  <br>The Re;Birth games are just the PS3 games remade for PC/Vita, so no real reason not to go with them unless you want NISA and Gust (I really want these two back). The first game's kinda shit, so I'd recommend Re;Birth 1 over that at the very least.</br>  <br>Okay so I'm getting kind of confused now, ever since victory happened Purple Heart's breast size have been changing all the time. <br><br>As of VII is her chest her original D, or is it an E again? Because they change it for reasons I don't understand.<br><br><br>I suggest if you want the full experiance watch the first game's story on Youtube (the game is really shitty to be honest) then play the Re;birth games on Vita. <br><br>Re;birth 1 is a remake of the first, but it is really different, both in terms of gameplay and story. But they still make references to the very first game so that's why I recommend you watch it on Youtube. <br><br>Re;birth 2 and 3 are identicle to the original versions story wise, so you might as well play them on the Vita too. <br><br>Though if you happen to have a decent PC, I highly recommend the PC version. It is actually an amazingly decent port, and runs extremely smooth compared to the console version.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> identical <br>Whether or not that was a freudian slip is something I'll leave up to you guys.</br></br>  <br><br>Post manga Nepbutt</br></br>  <br>vita port when?</br>  <br>I hope as soon as possible, vitafriends. Same thing for PCfriends, since I like my neps on my PC too</br>  Now that Jojo ended, will we get S2?<br>I miss nepnep</br>    Time for an anime sequel, if only to promote all the new games.  This is Nepgear.  <br>I want to give Nepgear a big hug.</br>  I want to throw myself before Blanc and confess my love for her.    <br>Uni's breasts are perfect.<br><br><br> amazingly decent port <br>The mouse support is so shit it's unusable, the button prompts are for controllers, and it maxes at 1080p windowed unmodded. Once you rebind everything you can control it keyboard only without too much hassle, but they clearly didn't put much thought into adapting shit to the PC environment.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> using M+K for PC ports of console games <br> not having a controller for PC </br></br>  <br>There are plenty of ports that do M+K just fine. Even if a controller is better, you can't really call it a good PC port if it doesn't support the most common PC input devices well. It's like a mobile port that doesn't support touch screen controls.</br>  nep  I want to make Nepgear my wife.

Vert can do 9999 with some of her hits with her exe attack, but nep's keeps going past that.  <br>she's the main character :^)<br><br> she also has an innate limit break trait, so she can go past 9999 in a single hit. you can get a plan to disable limit break for everyone else later on, though </br></br></br>  <br> You will never walk in on this. <br><br>I get the feeling Rom and Ram would be DTF to any guy they thought was cute enough and nice.</br></br></br>  I only want s2.

As Orange Heart, she is more cheerful and less serious, with a personality more akin to a childlike idol singer. <br> In a way, she is the complete opposite of Neptune, going from a more serious personality to a more childish one. </br></br>  Her voice actor, by the way.<br>http://myanimelist.net/people/8805/<wbr>Honda_Mariko</wbr></br>  <br>Amazing.

NGE is good enough by itself. <br>I like neps. I have all the nep games. HDN and mk2 are also good enough by themselves. Their stories are at least better than V's. Especially V's true route ending is maximum shit.</br></br>  <br>Fair enough.</br>  Thread so dead<br>Need a healthy nurse?</br>  <br>Cute as fuck.</br>  <br>I hope I'm not the only one but I enjoyed the dub just as much as the sub. Though for some reason the dub was only slightly funnier. Emphasis on SLIGHTLY.</br>  <br> 2nd <br>Okay then who do you think has the best?</br></br>  <br>They completely fucked up pururu, so I can't forgive it. And nowa sounds like she deserves the hate with her dub voice. Nep and compa are alright.</br>  <br>It has enough changes to the battle system and synth mechanics to make it worthwhile, not to mention they went crazy with the DLC characters, not only are they free but you get most of them early in the game. <br><br>It's more of significant change that what ReBirth 2 did for Mk2.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>There's about 1 in 10,000 cases where the English actor is better than the Japanese actor. <br>Compa's is one of those.<br><br>Having said that,<br> Neppu! There's two big balls of yarn in my face! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> preferring english when jap is pure sex </br>  <br>No, it's just that Compa's is just that bad. The rest of the Japanese cast is divine (so to speak).<br><br> Rina Satou <br> Asami Imai <br> Rie Tanaka <br> Kana Asumi </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cristina Vee is great at her dubs. That's what makes Noel best girl in BlazBlue whereas in Japanese she's generic shy girl.</br>  <br> compa voice <br> bad <br>Now that's just wrong.</br></br></br>  Anyone else thought the Neptunia anime looked weird? Like everything was too pale AND too bright at the same time? Sort of like someone put a bloom filter all over it.  <br>To be fair, I got why people didn't like how they handled Plutia. I personally didn't care but I'm the minority because it's still Plutia to me.</br>  <br>My biggest complaints were the balloon tits and the fucking tiny mouths</br>  <br>Balloon tits are the whole point of Vert and Peashy though.</br>    <br>I fucking love that face.<br>Where's my Nepgeardam merchandise?</br></br>  <br> Blanc. <br> Ass. </br></br>  <br>Best Nep.<br>Still pretty salty she had like a whole 3mins. of screentime in the entire show. At least I can play with her in ReBirth 2 and 3.<br><br> MAGES A SHIT! </br></br></br></br>  A question for anybody who has played both Japanese and English versions: is the humour different? I only played the original, MK2 and never bothered with Victory in English with Japanese audio and the subs felt Commie tier, other people felt the same but I wondered if somebody who played the Japanese version can confirm this. <br><br>Thinking of going back to get the platinum for Victory, what do I play after that? I don't have a Vita yet.</br></br>  <br>My only issue with MAGES. is that she gets kurisu's outfit in the first rebirth. Noire should get it since she shares kurisu's seiyuu.</br>  <br>Why of course</br>  <br>I know, but the way they were drawn is just off-putting. There was no reason for Vert's to bounce that wildly from little movements.</br>  <br>Of course it felt like commie, look at</br>  <br> IF <br> saying rub a dub <br>If it was neptune, I could somewhat forgive the stupidity, but that just doesn't make sense.</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair I haven't actually watched commie subs except one episode of P4G.</br>  <br>I don't come to the SFW boards much.<br>Not quite sure what the limit on this stuff is.</br></br>  <br>Just don't post a picture with a visible nipple, cat, or phallus and you won't be banned.</br>  <br>What about Shinfogeah?</br>  <br>waka flocka plz</br>  <br>Any official art from non-H stuff is a-ok, you fucking crossie.</br>  I want a Neptunia series without plot.<br>I don't give a shit about interdimensional travel or the R4 chip or anything. I just want cute console waifus lounging around.</br>  <br>Fair enough. Any honorable mentions?</br>    <br>I don't know enough to tell you what the original humor was, but a bunch of lines don't match the audio at all and that usually indicates localized jokes. The nicknames are what I hate the most, though.<br><br><br>Because MAGES. is the Steins;Gate character. Or, more accurately, the developer of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Iwata is dead</br>  <br>Too soon.  ;_; </br>  <br>I want to loosen Nep's anus with my fingers and eat out her butt with my tongue.</br>  <br>That made me drier than California.</br>    <br>slut</br>  <br>人殺し</br>  <br>This is nepgear.

Maybe until sunrise. But after that I would need my dick to go for a week with Neptune, Noire, Rom and Ram etcetera.</br>  <br>White Heart wouldn't stop.
