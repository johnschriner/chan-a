[ spoiler 794<br><br>chapter about sabo<br>http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/374<wbr>261</wbr></br></br></br>  meh  <br>so, he just controls birds? wtf</br>  <br>Is that the true Doflamingo?</br>  <br>it's early</br>  <br>Damn Franky really fucked up himself, how did he even manage to operate on himself?</br>  <br>Could be the power of a different member of the Revolutionary Army or a species of animals that they've trained to use for transport.</br>  What a pointless chapter. And hiatus again.  <br>Oh my fucking god<br>Praise Oda, praise the flamingo king. And of course praise the kindred spirit who asked for this.</br></br>  <br>Nah, I thinks he's giving his flamingo friends their own army of toys so they can imitate him.<br>The best part is Doflamingo covering his face though, because there is no way to know if it's just to hide to face or out of embarassment.</br></br>  wow mangastream was first.<br><br>fuck youuuu mangapanda</br></br>  WHERE the FUCK is my 2 page spread victory feast  Shit chapter.<br>We didn't learn anything new.<br>Sabo's amnesia was forced and pointless.<br>Only good thing was Robin's new look. She's become an 11/10.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Forced </br>  <br> Doffy is actually the glasses itself <br>  the human body is just a puppet controlled by his DF </br></br>  <br>No time for victory feast. Sanji and the rest could be in danger right now.</br>  <br> Sabo's amnesia was forced and pointless. <br>As fucking stupid as the amnesia excuse is, it was pretty much the only thing he could write that made any sense. It's the only excuse for not having Sabo show up before this that made any sense at all.<br><br>Of course, it would have been better if Oda had not tried to force Sabo into the story like this, then he wouldn't have had to come up with an excuse in the first place.<br><br>Sloppy writing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We got a sleepover with Bellamy instead. It's cool.</br>  Zoro is cute! CUTE!  <br>http://www.mangamint.com/one-piece-<wbr>794?page=4<br><br>Chapter is here. Should i Dump?</br></br></wbr></br>  ... well i think sabo's gonna die too <br>mera mera is cursed</br>  <br> not getting chapter from mangastream </br>  <br><br>Almost everything is sloppy to you nerds nowadays.<br><br>Do you even enjoy things anymore?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wow. Two watermarks from different sites. <br>Top of the line pic there champ.<br><br>Posting watermarked shit should count as advertising and be a bannable offense.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm satisfied with this.</br>  <br>Why ? It's on mangastream. Let them earn their advertisement money instead of spoiling it/giving it to these frauds http://readms.com/r/one_piece/794/2<wbr>860/1</wbr></br>  <br>The fact that he had to come up with an excuse means that it was unneeded and sloppy. Don't fucking write something in if you hadn't planned it from the beginning. ESPECIALLY if you then have to make excuses so it makes sense in the context of the story so far.</br>  how could sabo knows about the mera-mera in dressrosa?  <br>I doubt Oda has thought that far yet. He is clearly making up the story as he goes now.<br>But don't worry, whatever excuse he comes up with, the fans will eat it up and defend him online.</br></br>  <br>Well what makes sense to you then? Amnesia is a valid explanation. Also don't be an autist, it's completely fine to write something unplanned.</br>  <br> Don't fucking write something in if you hadn't planned it from the beginning <br>Keep telling yourself that.</br></br>  <br>it was the reward for tournament dumbass</br>  <br>Because doffy announced it the day before?</br>  <br>fuck uuuuuuuuuuuu</br>  <br>Did you forget the part about how Doffy advertised it and thats why there were so many big shots at the tournament?</br>  <br>How was this not sloppy writing?<br>Oda introduced Sabo out of nowhere after Marineford, because he decided he needs a 3rd 'brother' as an heir for the MeraMera.<br>But than he had to come up with a reason for him not be at said war.<br>So he he went the easiest was possible, amnesia.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I just post from wherever I read from. You guys never complain when its a panga manda trasnlation</br></br>  <br>Amnesia made enough sense to me, but maybe that's because Bleach has shifted the balance so far toward absurdity that I can accept almost anything now.</br>  <br> Well what makes sense to you then? <br>Not making up a character and trying to write him in the backstory halfway through. <br>Luffy having a second "brother" that was never mentioned up until that flashback arc, and him never having any contact or anything to do with the story until now. Amnesia, it's fucking absurd.</br></br></br>  <br>Your fanboy is showing.<br> Oh, i totally forgot: Luffy had a third brother. <br> Sorry for not even giving the slightest hint in the last decade </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I'm suprised that he would pull that shit when the revolutionary army and dragon in particular always had Luffy's bounty hanging around the place. <br><br>I'm pretty much convinced by now that Oda is dead. Chapters are slow as fuck and Hiatus every 2 weeks</br></br></br>  <br>Because shitty as it is, mangapanda actually does their own translation, dumbass.</br>  <br> out of nowhere <br> the third sake cup was clearly visible in flashback panels before Ace even died <br>Don't blame the master for your own stupidity.</br></br></br>  is this narutoforums now<br>fuck</br>  Oda's not even attempting to hide it anymore  <br> Yeah I'm suprised that he would pull that shit when the revolutionary army and dragon in particular always had Luffy's bounty hanging around the place.  <br>Exactly, how did this particular news story trigger him to cure his amnesia and suddenly remember everything? Ace and Luffy would have had their faces plastered all over newspapers countless times before, and that never made him wake up from his amnesia? <br>It's so ridiculous.</br></br></br>  <br>THis made no fucking sense. I said you retarded shit that no one complains when I link from mint when the translation is a panda. Now youre bitching because I guess i should feel sorry for stream because they are the better of the two evils. I do the links and dumps every week and have never gotten a complaint.</br>  <br>Sabo was foreshadowed before the war.</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>Unless someone comes out and says otherwise Oda is either dead or dying. The recent chapters have been the worse I have read in some time</br>  <br> the third sake cup was clearly visible in flashback panels before Ace even died <br> before Ace even died <br>How many chapters before?</br></br></br>  <br>Getting your memory back would mean a heavy trigger of sorts.<br>Bounty posters only show their faces and the prices.<br>Sabo read a newspaper clipping complete with info like the Mera. He most likely saw Luffy's name there as well.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  Another one for the "why doesn't he smile anymore" collection  <br>Does it even fucking matter?<br><br>You claimed Oda didn't foreshadow or plan Sabo. Go back to your whine circlejerk.</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck, are you twelve ? Anyways you shouldn't do that shit for panda either. Anons are grownup enough that they know where to find the chapter. They don't need you, the attention whore who actually think he useful, to link it for them.<br>And yes, I was the one who linked to mangastream. Why ? Because this is release day, and I don't want the average lazy twelve years old coming to this thread to follow the wrong link you posted. I wouldn't have had to do this if you hadn't posted a shitty link first.<br>Now please go back to naruto forums.</br></br></br>  <br> moving goalposts </br>  Is this for the eventual "Episode of Sabo" special?  <br>Foreshadowed him what, 300, 400, 500 chapters into the series? Stop being a shit eating fanboy.</br>  <br> You claimed Oda didn't foreshadow or plan Sabo <br>And that's true. That sake cup panel was drawn 25 chapters before Sabo was first mentioned. <br>Considering OP had 500+ chapters at that time, that's still a last minute idea, especially if you have any idea how mangaka work.<br>No one here says that Oda came up with Sabo a day before his first appearance. <br>I don't get why you desperately try to defending Oda.<br>Everyone makes mistakes, especially in such a long running manga. Just look at Shanks and the Sea King.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I link to Mint because of all the manga sites on the net their updates are the fastest for all the manga that I read and they host stuff other sites wouldn't have up. Why should i run in between sites to see which ones have the manga up when I can just go to one place. stay mad stream fag</br>   put a water mill where there's no river <br>Sasuga Kyros.</br>  <br>Stop making excuses for Oda.</br>  <br>How can they be the fastest if they are just reuploading from others? Are you dumb?</br>  <br><br> panel was drawn 25 chapters before Sabo was first mentioned <br>So he still foreshadowed him.<br><br>Call me whatever you want <br>it's more pathetic defending an argument with holes just because they're afraid of being labeled a fanboy or shit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> feeding traffic money to frauds who only take the time to upload the work of others instead of giving it to the people who actually did the shit <br>If you don't see the problem, then there's nothing I can do for you. You just weren't raised well enough. I hope you die smothered by your own ingratitude someday.</br></br>  <br>I'd rather make excuses for an accomplished author than be someone who makes excuses for his own /a/utist self.</br>   people seriously defending amnesia ITT <br>It's literally the cheapest plot tool</br>  <br>Volume 58, chapter 558, on the 3rd box of the 11th page.</br>  <br>Fuck off, Oda will show you the reason there's a watermill in the next few chapters. If not, we will make one up. <br>Stop criticizing the master!</br></br>  <br>You didn't read my post did you. This is a first for stream their chapter update wouldnt come until later in the day. I wouldnt be looking for the chapter on stream till about 2pm est. Now anon what i\I'm saying to you is that as soon as the scanlators release the scans wether it be stream or panda it would be up on mint. Why would I be searching back and forth on both sites when mint has it up within minutes of it going up on either.</br>  <br>why the fuck are you so mad anon? I would only understand your anger if you work for stream. If not stop getting your panties in a bunch about net traffic.</br>  <br>Fuck off cancer, supporting online readers and especially ones that steal from others should be bannable.</br>  <br>Yeah! That's total bullshit. Why didn't Oda foreshadow everything that would happen over the course of the manga during the first 20 chapters?</br>  <br>Foreshadowing doesn't mean Oda had the idea of Sabo from the beginning, you Idiot.<br>I said Oda introduced Sabo out of nowhere, because he needed a new character tied to Luffy and Ace.<br>And that cup panel shows that. He wrote Marineford and all that fighting and then came up with the idea of a 3rd brother. But that idea wasn't fleshed out. That's why he drew the tiniest shadows so he could play it out as foreshadowing or, if he decided to drop the idea of a 3rd brother, it wouldn't matter because 99,99% of the readers didn't even notice it.<br>And when he actually introduced Sabo, he still needed a reason for him not being at the Marineford war. <br>And all he could think of was amnesia. Sabo lost his memories and gained them back in 10 pages. and it doesn't even make sense, because like people said, he should have seen Luffy's and Aces's bounty flyer WAY earlier.<br>tl;dr: You suck Oda cock and are the reason why OP fans getting more and more hated on /a/.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If youre so mad at this you should be mad about mangastream basically robbing oda and jump of their revenue. Fucking autist</br>  <br><br>Actually I wouldn't be surprised if Kyros just grinded the stuff by making the mill turn with his own brute strength. Because he's badass like that.</br></br>  <br>There was no need to foreshadow anything, he should have introduced Sabo a long time ago. A third fucking brother with a nicely convenient amnesia, give me a fucking break.</br>  <br> being this mad <br> &gt;being this summer </br></br>  <br>I'm not mad. I'm just appalled.<br> unironically posting 9gag tier reaction pics <br>And I was right to.<br>Maybe in a few years you'll start posting pepes.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Foreshadowing doesn't mean Oda had the idea of Sabo from the beginning, you Idiot. <br>You didn't say that. <br><br>You said Oda didn't foreshadow Sabo period.<br>Which is a lie.<br>You're just a Sabo hater trying to justify his hate.<br>amnesia is literally the only thing that could justify Sabo yet you hate it because it explains everything?<br>And you call that lazy?<br><br>What a retarded fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   another hiatus <br>also was Sabo talking to the birds? Who or what are they?</br>  <br> &gt;not realizing that scanlation on a whole is stealing. <br><br>At the end of the day sites like panda and stream are stealing from jump. So your argument holds no weight</br></br></br>  <br>All four puppets are from the Wizard of Oz, is this foreshadowing anything with the Kidd alliance?</br>  <br> You're just a Sabo hater <br> hater <br>Opinion discarded. Go back writing under Youtube videos of "Epic One Piece Moments"</br></br></br>  <br> he should have seen Luffy's and Aces's bounty flyer WAY earlier. <br>I'm sure seeing a bunch of faces without context is enough to bring someone's memories back.<br><br>Unlike something that has information on it and probably mentions Luffy's name as well too, like a newspaper report.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, and should websites like mangafox or mangamint disappear no one would miss them because they don't actually do shit.</br>  <br> amnesia is literally the only thing that could justify Sabo <br>Yes, because Oda wrote himself into a corner. Do you even follow the discussion or do you just randomly reply to comments and write bullshit?</br></br>  <br> 9gag tier reaction pics <br>Nigga leave. All these may mays came for the shithole you're posting on now</br></br>  <br>That's retarded, why would Sabo have been introduced sooner? In what situation would it possibly have made any sense to introduce him?</br>  <br>What the fuck am I supposed to call you then?<br><br>This hating on a drawing is pathetic man.<br>You don't have any reason to discredit Oda besides disliking the character.</br></br></br></br>  Crow zoan fruit user?<br><br>Also Bellamy is recovering with the team, he can finally join Law's crew now</br></br>  <br>I wouldnt miss stream or panda so whats your point?<br><br>12 year olds all day</br></br></br>  <br> Yes, because Oda wrote himself into a corner. <br>Explaining everything within 10 pages and opening a whole new door of possibilities for Sabo is writing himself into a corner.<br><br>Got it, nerd.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bounty flyers have the names on them.<br>Also Luffy is Dragon's son, i'm pretty sure he or another one of his crew would mention that name to a high rank officer like Sabo at least once in 10 years.<br>And Ace' name and face was literally all over the entire world before the war.</br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't mean it's okay to post them. Just because you wore bell bottoms when you were young doesn't mean it's okay to wear them now.<br>Just fuck off, 4chan clearly isn't for you if I have to explain this.</br></br>  <br> You said Oda didn't foreshadow Sabo period. <br>I don't know who you are even talking to, but I have not noticed anyone claim that. <br><br> amnesia is literally the only thing that could justify Sabo yet you hate it because it explains everything? <br>That is exactly the fucking point.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You wouldn't miss your chapter being translated and ready for you to read on tuesday ?</br>  <br><br>Nobody knew Luffy was Dragon's son before the war.</br></br>  <br>It wouldn't have made any sense, because he shouldn't even exist.</br>  <br>He already did it when he turned from Cutty Flam into Franky.</br>  <br>If names and pictures with no context were enough to solve amnesia it wouldn't be a problem.<br><br>The difference was that Ace died, it's what triggered his memory.</br></br></br>  <br> That is exactly the fucking point. <br>I don't understand. Should One Piece not make sense?</br></br>  <br>lel when did 4chan recquire some etiquette to post. Your autism is showing kid. do reaction pics trigger you that much? Here's one more for good measure.</br>  <br>What a convenient amnesia.</br>  <br> You don't have any reason to discredit Oda besides disliking the character. <br>No one is discrediting Oda, you fucking fanboy. <br>I and some other anons just give examples of shit writing. <br>Oda is writing the most famous and best-selling manga of the last decade. He's under immense pressure, of course he makes mistakes.<br>But everyone has the right to mention these mistakes and call him out on it.<br><br>Serious question to end this discussion: Do you think Oda is infallible? Yes or no.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the guy Doflamingo despised joining the crew of the guy Doflamingo worshipped <br>There's something wrong about this.</br></br>  <br>Nope. I actually have other things to do than read mango.</br>  <br> i'm pretty sure he or another one of his crew would mention that name to a high rank officer like Sabo at least once in 10 years. <br>It was shown literally this chapter that the revolutionaries didn't know Luffy was Dragon's son until it was revealed at Marineford, did you even read the chapter?</br></br>  <br>That's right, taking him 9 years until seeing the news of Ace's death made it so convenient. It must be great having amnesia.</br>  <br>It should, but being forced into a situation where you have to write up a convenient amnesia for it to make sense is shit. Just plan ahead and stop adding shit to your already overly long saga halfway through and we wouldn't be in this mess.</br>  <br>Not even a Zorofag but that smile is adorable.</br>  <br>Why? Law can be the new pride of the North Blue which is why Bellamy joined originally, also he wants to survive the 'great wave' mentioned in pic related.</br>  <br>Just like people have a right to mention mistakes, other people also have a right to disagree that they are mistakes.</br>  <br>Then why aren't you doing them right now ?</br>  <br> But everyone has the right to mention these mistakes and call him out on it. <br>Show me how Sabo as a whole was a mistake.<br>Because I don't see it.<br>All this shit in this thread boils down to one person's flawed assumption that Sabo wasn't foreshadowed, then moving the goalposts and saying Sabo wasn't foreshadowed since East fucking Blue.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I am.</br>  <br> still responding to retarded turbofaggots </br>  Oda could introduce a 4th brother and you faggots would eat it up.   kyros has 2 legs again   <br>You can't fucking disagree with facts, that is what makes you a shiteating fanboy.</br>  <br>What you're saying makes no fucking sense. He wasn't forced into doing anything, he came up with the idea for having a third brother who was missing and amnesiac and then added it. You're acting as though he came up with Sabo and then years later scrambled to come up with an excuse as to why he wasn't there.</br>  <br><br> he can't multi-task </br></br>  <br>Well... where exactly do you draw the line? Don't tell me you're one of those people who think haki wasn't planned.</br>  <br>Again, how is being convenient mean bad?<br>It makes sense.<br> Just plan ahead <br>He planned 25 chapters ahead<br> stop adding shit to your already overly long saga halfway through <br>I'll judge the whole saga after I reread the whole thing in one go.<br>I'd like to believe I'm a chill fuck like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No you're not, you're wasting your time arguing with me.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br> unironically claiming your own opinion is fact <br>This is why no one is taking your criticism seriously.</br></br>  <br>I prefer sister.</br>  <br>Honestly didn't notice.</br>  <br>Kids nowadays have the attention span of a gold fish. Its literally impossible.</br>  Well at least we got a look at the kind of person Dragon is.<br> Is it true he's your son? <br> Huh? Oh yeah. </br></br>  <br>We wouldn't, seeing as the cups on the trunk were set on 3 even during the flashbacks full of only Ace and Luffy.<br> but what if he was late to the drinking <br>It wouldn't work seeing as he doesn't have any way to get included in the flashback.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Good thing I'm not a kid then.</br></br>  <br>Keep telling yourself that.</br>  <br>Yeah...your mum</br>  <br>delete this</br>  <br><br> keep telling yourself that <br><br>I will as I do it all right now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No one is saying he wasn't foreshadowed.<br>But he got introduced into the story as a last minute reason.<br>He's such an important character to Luffy's entire personality, history and one of the reasons why Luffy is who he is today.<br>Luffy's father was introduced in Louge Town, Ace was introduced in Alabasta, but Oda waited 6 years after that to introduce another "family" member (pretty sure we will never see Luffy's mother alive).<br>The entire 3rd brother story makes absolutely no sense. At least at Alabasta, when Luffy introduced ace as his brother, don't you think it would be a good time to mention Sabo? Or at least foreshadow him then.</br></br></br></br></br>  I like how they're all relaxed and don't give a shit about Sanji    <br>Who?</br>  <br> Haki was planned <br> This is was fanboys actually believe <br>Ok, so you're saying Haki was planned?<br>Then why did Shanks, one of the most powerful Haki users in the entire OP universe, lose his arm to a baby Sea King, that Luffy could one shot at the start of the manga?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop criticizing Oda you shiteater!</br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>Fuck off.<br><br><br> why did Shanks, one of the most powerful Haki users in the entire OP universe, lose his arm to a baby Sea King, that Luffy could one shot at the start of the manga. <br>Same reason he got a beer thrown in his face instead of obliterating the guy who threw it.</br></br></br></br></br>  AHAHAHAHAHA<br><br> Rebecca is not here <br> Bartolomeo is not here <br> BELLAMY IS HERE <br><br>NAKAMA CONFIRMED. Kyros is here because it's his house and Law is here because of the alliance.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No one is saying he wasn't foreshadowed. <br>Missed the few posts up there anon?<br> But he got introduced into the story as a last minute reason. <br>25 chapters before the war is last minute? CP0 is last minute not Sabo.<br> Or at least foreshadow him then. <br>He was dead to them. There's no point.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br> Then why did Shanks, one of the most powerful Haki users in the entire OP universe, lose his arm to a baby Sea King, that Luffy could one shot at the start of the manga? <br><br>Powerlevel fags in a nutshell</br></br></br>  <br> actually caring enough about what I think that he'd show me what he's doing <br>This is golden.<br>I too can open audacity, make a screenshot and pretend I'm doing shit though.</br></br></br>  <br> Same reason he got a beer thrown in his face instead of obliterating the guy who threw it. <br>That's probably the most retarded answer i ever got to my question.</br></br>  <br>Another double watermark. Jesus fuck, how do you people read your manga? What the fuck is wrong with you?</br>  <br>How is it retarded?</br>  <br> THIS IS ACE, MY BROTHER WHO'S STILL ALIVE <br> Wait, what? <br> Nothing, don't worry about it, you'll find out in 6 years <br>Yeah that would have been so much better.</br></br></br></br>  <br> why didn't Luffy, a character who never volunteers anything about his past even to his closest friends and who never dwells on anything personal unless it's immediately relevant, tell us all about his backstory immediately <br>lol okay</br></br>  <br>Why did Shanks get his shit pushed in at the bar?<br>Why did Luffy's dumb ass emulate him years after?<br><br>It was to make a point. Stop being a shiteater.</br></br></br></br>  What is Sanji doing?  <br>Flock of birds logia.</br>  <br>interns fucking up</br>  <br> Then why did Shanks, one of the most powerful Haki users in the entire OP universe, lose his arm to a baby Sea King, that Luffy could one shot at the start of the manga? <br>This is a retarded argument, because even without Haki Shanks still should have been able to easily beat the seaking, so it really has no bearing at all on the Haki argument. The real answer is that Shanks decided to sacrifice his arm to push Luffy towards whatever he thinks he can become.</br></br>  <br>What reason would he have to obliterate someone that threw beer on his face? How is that related to him losing his arm because he doesn't bother defending himself against a monster?</br>  <br>Why does everyone forget about Ace's tattoo? Also Ace was shown in Drum Kingdom first.</br>  Why does this girl keep calling her future husband a jew?  <br>Hatoko a best.</br>  <br>She is an insane person who gets jealous far too easily.</br>  She plays dirty  and I like it   <br> Keeping it straight with her main competitor <br><br>If anything, she's a fucking gentleman for implicitly asking for an straight up duel.<br><br> I'd say lady, but sounds fucking awkward </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She knew the red head wouldn't say shit.<br>She was killing off the competition with a single blow.</br></br>  <br>Too bad the shitty tsundere will still win. There is no justice in this world.</br>  Cookie needs to grow the fuck up and just let him have her.  <br>Only made Tomoyo reaffirm her love for Andou in the end though so we can't really say what Hatoko intended with her confession.</br>  <br>Gotta say, 029's illustrations translates very well into anime. I wouldn't be surprised if this was set in the same universe as Maousama</br>    I'd hate to be fucking Andou. All these girls are fucking insane, he really should just go gay or something.  <br>Considering the nature of there powers, I'd say they are insane for how sane they are as of now.</br>  She is perfection in every way  Hatoko &gt; Mirei &gt; Kuki &gt; Chifuyu &gt; Sayumi &gt; the girls in the other chuuni group &gt; Tomoyo  Would you go and catch her /a/?  <br>Hatoko a shit. A SHIT.</br>  <br><br>I hate to be the one, but I really do feel like I'm the only one who likes both.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off Tomoyoshitter.</br>  <br>too bad shitter tsundere wins the vast majority of the win in LNs.</br>  <br> Wearing a sweater like that <br>Why does she dress like a retard?</br></br>  <br>Index is about to sink the shitty tsundere ship hard at least.</br>  <br>What's so good about Hatoko? Even Andou find can her annoying.<br><br><br> Hatokofag <br>Enjoy your shit taste.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If I were Andou Cookie would be in for a surprise when she finds out I actually want to fuck her not teleport girl</br>  Can't he just marry all of them except the red head?  <br>Yes. Tomoyo a shit and that's a fact.</br>  JEWS<br>JEWS<br>JEWS</br></br>  <br>Tomoyo &gt; Chifuyu &gt; * &gt; * &gt; * &gt; Shit &gt; Hatoko<br><br><br> fact <br>Typical Hatokofag a worst fans.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tomwho?</br>  <br>Tomowhore.</br>  <br>Reminder.

Many authors and creators that make your anime and manga are chuuni, you know.</br>  <br>I want to marry her voice</br>  <br>Grow up.</br>  <br>My life is nothing but cold, bitter hatred.</br>  <br>Did you lost your way to reddit or something?</br>  <br>I watch anime because I'm a loser.

It's not Tomoyo's fault that she and Andou connect on the same wavelength more than everyone else while Hatoko can't and is close to dead last in winning.</br>  <br>I'm so glad pomf doesn't exist anymore and you can't spam your shitty wembs.</br>  <br>They're not mine, but I did posted them often. I like how it shuts up and Hatokofags up since no one can argue and deny the chemistry between Tomoyo and Andou.</br>  <br>shuts you*</br>   77 posts and 22 IPs <br><br>Goddamn people.</br></br>  <br>It's her fault because she ruined Hatoko's chances by existing.</br>  <br>All me.</br>  Hatoko was the only humanized girl in the show. The rest were two dimensional and annoying.  <br>Just proof that Tomoyo is a better girl for Andou. Fate dealt its cards. You'll have to deal with that.</br>  <br><br>Don't mind the delusional Hatokofags, anon. They're normalfags and blind tsundere haters being retarded.</br></br>  <br><br> What is phone, spoofing, etc <br>Being new or pretending to be retarded won't change what's fucking obvious.</br></br></br>  <br> look at me I'm always right about everything </br>  She was born to give birth to lots of children.  <br>What if they inherit her stupid?</br>  <br> stupid <br>She's redpilled as fuck.</br></br>  <br>What if they inherit her normalfaggotry?</br>  <br>That's good, you don't want those kids becoming losers like /a/.</br>  I'm still mad at the episode 2 ending.<br>Like, really fucking pissed.</br>  <br>Then they will live happy lives.</br>  <br>I want to see her raped by niggers.</br>  <br>What if they inherit her worst girl traits?</br>  <br>What if they inherit her shitty fashion senses?</br>   people still care about this show <br>I have nothing against Hatoko but I think Tomoyo was the best girl, can't understand why some people shit on her. Nice design, the tsundere antics were standard fare but somehow fresh because of her voice, and the chuuni thing was fun to watch. Especially when she freaked when MC caught her writing the LN. Speaking of which, light novels translated when?</br>  <br>Bitch is fake as hell, Hatoko is the truth.</br>  <br> fake <br>Explain further.</br></br>  <br>Tomoyo is perfect, all-around good tsunder with interactions and chemistry to bring out the best in her, and is a bro.<br><br>Really, only Hatokofags hate because they lash back to the hate Hatoko receives. And then there are the few anti-tsunfags who are extremely vocal.</br></br></br>  I love Hatoko!  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mqb<wbr>2Cee83no</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sCE<wbr>ONqbuqSU</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Not exactly your everyday voice actress.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I want Endless Paradox in my life.</br></br>  Hatako is life and the voice of reason.  <br>Agreed.<br><br>Couldn't care less about any of the other rankings, as long as Hatoko is first and Tsunshit is last.<br><br>Maybe Chifuyu second</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't meet girls if you never leave your basement</br>  <br>Chifuyu and cookie should be equal second place.</br>  Tomoyo a shit.

Move here down more.</br>    <br>her*</br>  <br>Maybe kill yourself?</br>  <br>I fucking hate it when people make this excuse.<br>According to this logic you already lie to yourself when you stop shitting in your pants.<br>Be honest with you neither does mean to disregard others people opinion or feelings, nor does it mean to stop developing.</br></br></br>  <br>I forgot what the powers of each girl were.</br>    <br>Did you even watched the show?</br>  <br>Holy shit. Doujin when?</br>  <br>When Tomoyo stops being a sht, so never.</br>   nonviolent tsundere <br> very cute <br> great fashion sense <br> likes writing <br> tells MC to get it together <br>So what exactly is the issue with her, again? I keep hearing "chuuni" but that's what the MC likes and wants.<br><br>Yes, they'll have to grow out of it sooner than later, and maybe Hatoko is right to tell them so, but they only have a few more years before they become adults and join the no-fun-allowed society. Can't fault them for wanting a last hurrah.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Did you even watched the show? <br>I also hate this remark.<br><br>Yes I've seen it. My statement doesn't refer specifically on this show but others like the second season of the KyoAni Chuunbyou.</br></br></br></br>  Why does this shit still causes so shitstorms here? Anime was weak, only memorable scene was rant of that boring bitch.  <br>Waifu wars<br> Also the ED song was great </br></br>  <br> I thought it was pretty good. </br>  <br> nonviolent tsundere <br> tsundere <br><br>There's the problem with her. Tsunderes are shit no matter what.</br></br></br></br>  <br> what exactly is the issue <br>See <br><br>Even when they become older, their chuuni shouldn't go away. The story here is that chuuni is acceptable rather than something to be embarrassed about. Andou and Tomoyo are the non-autistic kind of chuunis, they are self-aware so it won't be a problem for them to switch out and be serious when they have to. <br><br>If the parallelism hasn't been noted to you before, both of them are going to be like Hajime and Hitomi when they grow older. Tomoyo most likely as a LN author and Tomoyo probably as an editor.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tsunderes are shit no matter what <br>But that's like, your opinion man. Tsunderes are okay in my book if they're cute and get along with MC in spite of the B-BETSUNIs.<br><br>inb4 that fag comes in with "THK"</br></br></br></br>  <br>She still isn't sincere about her feelings. Girls like Hatoko who never hide their intentions and know what they want should realistic be favored over the generic tsunderes.</br>  <br>Are you trying to emulate THK? If you are then you're doing a pretty decent job.<br><br><br> in spite of the B-BETSUNIs <br>Why do you make it sound as if that isn't part of what makes them cute? Betsuni reactions are wonderful.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She still isn't tsuntsun about her feelings. Girls like Tomoyo who isn't honest about their true feelings, but are transparent behind their actions and words should realistic be favored over the generic deredere because they are cuter. </br>  <br>You misunderstand, I like Betsuni reactions but they often get in the way of a working relationship or cause dumb misunderstandings. <br><br><br> girls who never hide their intentions and know what they want should be favored <br>The problem with this is that it's not always a good thing, see Yandere</br></br></br></br></br>  Why are you guys arguing about that red headed loser and not talking about this wonderful girl?  <br>I dunno... there isn't much to talk about her</br>  <br> loser <br>Your pic related.<br><br>Also </br></br></br></br>  <br>Normalfag | Casual Anime Viewer | /a/ | (weaboo) Chuuni<br><br>She tried to take him all the way down.

She needs to help someone, and her assisting Yuki was probably enough to keep her sane, but now Yuki doesn't need her help anymore.

She's gonna get that smug smile bashed off her face after she succeeds in doing whatever the fuck her group is trying to do at the university (probably let zombies in so they can ransack the place for their medicine, since they're partially infected like Kurumi and realize the zombies won't chase after them so long as they stay quiet.</br></br>  <br> Glasses is a girl <br>I was talking about the crossbow boy.<br>Or that one was a girl as well?</br></br></br>  <br> Or that one was a girl as well? <br>Probably not. I just know that faggot has freckles, and if it's a girl then she deserves a good facefucking. Same may or may not apply if freckles is a dude (depends on how girly he looks). <br><br>That aside, it's interesting to note that the university seems to be separated into small little groups squabbling over resources (helmets, those girls, etc.) so it's somewhat safe to assume that the place is clear of zombies for the most part, but has a good number of people reliant on medication.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I love how there are no blatant panty shots, yet they exist on a non-obnoxious level.</br>  <br>Love dog!</br>  It's about cute girls doing nothing because the author doesn't know what pacing is  <br>The author is trying to make the anime a different experience than the manga, like making Miki a member of the club since the beginning.</br>    <br>I appreciate that but I don't think they can make the anime that interesting given the source material</br>  <br>what?<br>if you complain about the author dropping the SoL parts, well yeah the gap effect has disappeared but still good enough.<br><br> The author is trying to make the anime a different experience <br>Is the author doing the series composition for the anime or what?

Megu-nee is clearly already dead, yet Taroumaru is still around and doesn't appear to be infected. <br><br>I'm assuming we'll find out pretty soon, but they must have decided to change things around so that Megu-nee was infected in some other way? Taroumaru isn't a delusion, as everyone including Miki interacts with him. Wonder how they are going to play this whole situation.</br></br></br></br>  Oh, Anon! We've been waiting for you, come on in!  Shovel cannot die. I won't let it happen.  <br>This is something straight out of a Tool music video, Jesus Christ.</br>  <br>NOPE</br>  <br> yfw </br>  <br>The dog wasn't the cause in the first place.</br>  chapter 38 spoiler  <br> that art <br>Yeah, no.</br></br>  <br>Mii-kun's warm mouth must be feeling good to her cold skin.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, just realized that, not sure how I got mixed up about that. Still, in the manga he was infected from the get-go and Megu-nee had to get rid of him. I guess in the anime they'll let everyone get attched to him before he runs off and gets bitten, then have Shovel-chan or Riinsane be forced to kill him.</br></br>  <br>Miki will probably go crazy when Kurumi's condition gets confirmed by someone, probably almost stopping her doing whatever it is she ends up needing to do to help her.</br>  <br>It's suffering all the way down either way</br>  <br>I don't know if that's a good decision. In the manga, everything happened before the story started. The flashbacks showing how things happened gave a depressing, hopeless feeling instead of shock value, since we knew what is going to happen. Killing the dog after getting attached to it just feels cheap and not GG! like, keeping you on the edge all that time that is.</br>  <br>I wonder what she tastes like</br>  <br><br>Cold and dirty, with a hint of corruption, disease, and a slight tinge of rotting meat.</br></br>  <br>Cold yet delicious, filled with love.</br>  <br>Disgusting, yet arousing.</br>  <br>not even in the same art style</br>  <br>despair</br>    <br> Another anon fall for it <br>Fell ya bro.

It's not like I'm wrong. She's a filthy slut and she knows it.</br>  <br>Is anyone else scared the popularity will just drop after the second episode? I can see the first getting crazy attention because of the reveal, but I'm scared people just won't stick with it.</br>  <br>It's not like the popularity actually means anything. It's not boosting sales - just getting talked about a bit more in Japan.</br>   tfw your waifu is going crazy <br> tfw it might get her killed <br>Her only options now are her getting better and surviving for anther day or going deeper into the rabbit's hole until shes complete crazy and dies.<br>Don't do this to me, please.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't being talked about part of getting more sales?</br>  <br>If only.</br>  <br> I don't like her anyway </br>  <br><br><br>Manga sales have skyrocketed, each volume has gone full mainstream sales expected of the other top Manga's atm. It's a success.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah, I can forsee this getting more and more popular and staying that way. It really does an excellent job of walking a fine line between edgemaster suffering and inane CGDCT, (the manga at least, we'll see about the anime,) manages to incorporate the best elements of both without veering too far inone direction or the other, or becoming cheesy or overdone. It really is both cute and tense at the same time, which is quite an accomplishment if you think about it. Most series can't even do one or the other well, while GG, (again, the manga, though the anime has potential to do it too especially with the manga author onboard,) manages to do both well without compromising or getting too cliche, at least so far.</br></br>  <br>Too bad the manga is starting to become The Walking Dead. Especially if the new girls turn out to be bad like people think.</br>  <br>Ah. That's true. I was thinking more of anime sales.</br>  <br>Even anime sales are comfortably rising as it gets more popular, though at this point it's a bit stupid trying to garner any idea of how well an anime will sell this early in the season.<br><br>As said, the good point is that no matter how mediocre the anime may or may not sell, it's a success due to the amount of manga sales it's drawing. An abnormal amount of success even.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't either when I first started, but she grew on me,  and them tits also helped </br>  <br>It is still focused in the main group mind state.<br>As long as the author maintain it as that, he can't fuck up.<br>Also, it is impossible for this to continue forever as The Walking Dead.</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=z3q<wbr>m2tTD_oQ</wbr>  [ ]<br>Shit is guna b gud.</br></br>  <br> implying <br>we already have a semi-cure, so none of them can die right away, and its stated its a world pandemic, so no outside help.

Seeing as I like this series, I decided to do it myself. I just finished the first, and I'll be continuing straight through the next three so long as my motivation holds tonight. Here's the first, and I'll be posting more as I finish.<br><br>http://pastebin.com/xKr64Qre</br></br>  <br>It's okay anon,  thanks to medicine she only turns slowly over the course of a couple of months instead of in a day!  </br>  <br><br>Based Akatsukin!

That would be amazing.</br></br>  <br>Thank you based Akatsukin, it's nice to see you aroung here<br><br>Asenshi already said they don't have plans for summer.</br></br></br>  <br>There is no way this goes for 40 episodes more. It is simply as that.<br>And it will not get cancelled thanks to the new peak of popularity.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm well aware. I was asking if that may have changed, being that as far as I know, Akatsukin is the main Asenshi guy and said he likes the series. <br><br>Glad you got a chance to pop in with a condescending remark though, anon. Good for you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Forgot to actually link it. There's some very telling information in this chapter.<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;112097001 </br></br>  <br>Who can say for sure?<br>Its all depends on the manga</br></br>  <br> That school song <br> 1968 <br> The school was specifically designed to be completely self-sufficient <br><br>Jesus christ.</br></br></br></br></br>  How long has it been since it all started?<br>Like 3 months or something?</br>  <br>Great job man, appreciate it.</br>  <br>Wow, that's nice.<br>Thanks.</br></br>  Chapter 2, way shorter than 1.<br><br>http://pastebin.com/8rz8gEUM<br><br><br>I suggest Vivid.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, I'd almost given up hope.</br>  <br> I suggest Vivid. <br><br>Thanks, that's who I went with for Ep.1, I just love you more. There's something about watching those damned meters fill up. I suppose everyone needs a little time off though.<br><br>Anyway thanks for the extra translations, interesting stuff.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's great. I was just going to look for a translator for them. A translation for volume 4's Megu diary was posted at https://archive.moe/a/thread/112999<wbr>146/#113004805 and I started typesetting it the other day. Are there any errors/missing parts in that, and mind if I use your translations for scanslating the rest?<br><br>Also, the copyright police are sending takedown notices for gakkou gurashi now. Mediafire deleted the old chapter 14 ddl.</br></br></wbr></br>  how do we save kei  <br> Fat people actually starve faster. <br><br>To elaborate, fat people will have heart problems if the reason they are fat is lack of exercise, as their bodies will consume more muscle when starving.</br></br></br>    After watching the first episode today, I decided to read the manga, so I read it entirely<br>There is one thing I did not understand, why did the helicopter crash? I think the guy just though they were already dead so he gave up to despair, but I'm not sure. I probably missunderstood it</br>  <br><br>Fucking Yuki-chan is 2qt4me! Adorable.</br></br>  <br>The one thing I'd question about Vivid's was they used "into trouble" instead of  "casualty"  for Megu's line, which doesn't emphasize the double meaning, but I don't know enough moon to tell what the original line was like. Otherwise it was good; no reason to regret using it.</br>  <br><br>To me it seemed to be implying he was infected and reliant on the serum, same as Kurumi. It was wearing off and he turned before he was able to get out a new dose and administer it. Or, alternatively, he was turning for the first time and didn't administer the initial dose in time. Maybe he had been infected without realizing it? <br><br>Either way it seemed to me he needed the serum, got it out, but turned before managing to hit himself with it, then once zombified he crushes the syringe and crashes the chopper.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The pilot had a seizure. The details are a mystery, but speculation is he was infected and using the serum like Kurumi, and it lost effectiveness over time, so he started losing it like she did on the couch because he was too late with the next dose.</br>  <br>Pilot infected but had serum. Noticed symptoms appearing during flight, tried to administer serum, hand spasmed and crush vial. Pilot go bye-bye.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, I noticed that as well. I watched Vivid, then also watched HS/CR for comparison and that was the only line where it seemed to me that CR might have had a better translation choice. Haven't looked at the DDY release yet, but I'm betting Vivid is probably the best option.</br></br>  <br>He was infected through unclear means and before he could apply the serum he suffered a muscle-spasm of sorts, accidentally destroying the needle with the serum. This lead to the helicopter crashing as he lost control from panic/infection.</br>  <br><br>Why cute girls only then?</br></br>  <br>It's easier for us to empathize and self-insert.</br>  <br>It's a clever twist on the cute girls formula, don't think too deep about it.<br><br>He even avoided some cliché like the yuri subtext, by making a girl actually have a crush.</br></br></br>  <br> It's a clever twist on the cute girls <br>Is it? if they werent there it wouldnt be good? I dunno what to think. Like you said maybe I shouldn't think about it too deeply but that is hard to do.</br></br>  <br>The thing I love about this series is that good times always follow the tense and bad times. Like, Miki and Yuki almost died, then they had that little sports festival. Kurumi almost died, then they found food and supplies and had a feast. Radio girl dies, they get an RV and go swimming. If this keeps up next chapter they'll have a real happy and relaxing time with the Uni sluts before they get betrayed.</br>  <br> self-insert <br>How?<br>I don't wanna be a cute girl, I just want to fuck them </br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but myself I have imagined myself saving Rii-san after she gets separated from the other girls, and living with her while searching for the others.<br><br>After a while, we find them but Rii-san decides that I go with them, because she's already carrying by baby inside her.<br> <br>Then I die saving my new family.</br> </br></br></br></br>  <br>The way you are saying it, looks predictable. Like its original at some parts but following a same flow can lead to that.<br><br><br><br>Be a zombie.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of that, I've been cursing the lack of porn of this series, but because of that I've been forced to use my imagination and find that it's not so bad. It's a nice change of pace and always has a story that suits your tastes.</br>  <br><br>Wow anon. What an elaborate and specific escapist fantasy you have based around this escapist malaysian fantasy comic book. Very healthy.<br><br>Don't you know  Riinsane a SHIT ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shut your filthy trap, Rii-san is the best and most beautiful.<br> <br>Also I've been thinking about this setup for a while.</br> </br></br>  <br>She will be cured of her insanity through the power of dick. Carrying and caring for a baby will make sure her caring personality will be too busy for delusions.</br>  <br>Narutaru, right?</br>  <br><br>When his spoiler happens, she'll replace him with a teddy bear with a strapon and continue waking Yuki up in the middle of the night.</br></br>  <br><br>I knew I recognized that style! What a very appropriate OP to draw from. Most misleading opening in the history of anime. That fucking series was some dark shit. Manga was even worse than the anime, by far.</br></br>  <br> change of pace <br>People don't usually do that? Too much time spent thinking as a kid got me countless fleshed-out scenarios that I can get off to just as easily as I can anyone else's work.</br></br>  <br>She is the craziest and only dead weight to the group as well.</br>  <br>I don't, it takes me an hour or two just to start getting into it when I use my imagination. I keep going off-track and imagine non-sexual scenarios, which is fine as well, but I don't really have the time to do that.</br>  <br>She took the lead just until 5 chapters ago, she also cooks and dooes the house chores.<br><br>She's no dead weight at all, I'd say Miki is the one that does nothing special (she can drive just like, but so can Rii-san), Yuki too, but at least she keeps the spirits up.<br><br>If it wasn't for Rii-san and Kurumi everyone would be dead already.<br><br> the craziest <br>You say that like it's something bad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Riinsane <br> Rii-san <br>Riinsane should be her new name, it's only a few letters added and it sounds real nice.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks good in text, but actually saying it out loud or even in my head it doesn't really sound all that well because of the different pronunciations.</br>  <br>Before they had to protect a deluded Yuki that acted like a little kid in school grounds.<br>Now they have a deluded Rii-san that thinks her teddy bear is alive, in the outside world where there is no protection.<br>Granted that before she was useful, but she is becoming more and more useless as time goes.</br></br></br>  <br>She only needed protection against the bowgun, and nothing else.<br><br>The fact that she's still useful doing chores and driving, while her insanity is far less impairing that Yuki's, stops her from being a dead weight.<br><br>It's okay if you don't like her, but you shouldn't be lying either.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but sadly I do the same thing<br>This is what happens when you have 4 hours of alone with your thoughts.<br> Fuck working at UPS </br></br></br>  <br>It is not lying, it is stating the truth.<br>Or you think going completely alone to a school full of Zombies to get a teddy bear is fine and okay?<br>And she is just cooking and occasionally driving, but thanks to Ruu, she will now try to protect her which means putting herself and everyone else in danger as she already have shown with crossbow</br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but she's really been the weakest link since Yuki stopped being deluded. There isn't anything she can do that no one else can, like Kurumi and Yuki, and she's not as well-rounded as Miki.</br>  <br> Or you think going completely alone to a school full of Zombies to get a teddy bear is fine and okay? <br>She didn't really hurt anyone did she.<br>Kurumi also put everyone in danger by testing her zombie powers, yet you don't see people calling her a dead weight because she can kill the things, she has a set role in the team just like Rii-san.<br><br>Yuki and Miki don't do shit aside from the occasional helping, but they do have their spots on the team. Yuki keeps everyone in a good mood and Miki is the smart guy.<br><br>No one is a dead weight, and everyone has their own issues, Rii-san hasn't been insane for a long time, nor it really affects anyone aside from the bowgun incident.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  There isn't anything she can do that no one else can <br>Yet the others don't these things.<br>Yuki is far from being capable too.</br></br></br>  <br>Yuki's much more capable than Rii is at this moment. You'd have to be as deluded as Rii to think otherwise.</br>  <br> Rii-san hasn't been insane for a long time, nor it really affects anyone aside from the bowgun incident. <br>That's the point.<br>She just began with the teddy bear delusion and she becomes a problem almost immediately after.<br>It clearly shows that she is seriously weighing down the team, not that it matters for the characters themselves, but is clearly a fact.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuki still hasn't proven to be more useful than Rii. She's still mostly a mood maker than anything else, considering she's still childish and others have to do the chores for her.</br>  <br>Nothing wrong with blatant. Prude go home</br>  <br> It clearly shows that she is seriously weighing down the team <br>But she isn't, as I said in my post others have also put everyone in danger before, yet they have their roles as much as Rii-san. <br><br>"Seriously weighing down" is a huge exaggeration.</br></br></br></br>  I think we're definitely getting a Miki focus in the manga soon. She's the only one of the main group that isn't 'compromised' at this point.<br>Kurumi could go south at any time, and Rii and Yuki are off in la-la land, so Miki has to be ready to kick ass at a moments notice.</br>  <br>You'd need a time machine.</br>  <br>You mean that ruining a chance of human interaction is only a small problem in the situation there are?<br>Yuki was a dead weight when she was deluded, and the manga make clear that even the moral support could be done better.<br>Why should be different for Rii-san now she is the deluded one?</br></br></br>  <br> Also, the copyright police are sending takedown notices for gakkou gurashi now. Mediafire deleted the old chapter 14 ddl. <br>Were those just the same images as on batoto?</br></br>  Is it even possible for Nitro+ to do a lighthearted story?  After the Helio scene, Rii has been losing it more and more. Adding that all she can really do now is cooking and driving, she can't contribute much since they left the school and its making her crazy. Teddy sister can either make or break her at this point. Granted I would say shes still more sane than Yuki because she acknowledges the danger while Yuki is still a bit oblivious to it.<br> First Shovel gets bitten and my waifu goes mad. I want off this crazy ride. </br>  <br>Anon, things should be addressed BEFORE the consequences happen, not after.<br><br>It might seem like Rii's situation is "no problem" but that's only until she starts protecting a teddy bear during a horde of zombies compromising the whole group, or fights with strangers over a teddy bear (like she has already done, but worse).</br></br></br>  <br>But Rii-san is still more useful than Yuki though, even if she started losing it.<br><br>Also, they got to the university fine, if you didn't read chapter 37.</br></br></br>  <br>That has not happened yet, so again, saying she's a huge weigh down is an exaggeration.<br><br><br>Even in school she was cooking and taking care of chores, and she still does that, while the others don't. Her usefulness has not decreased at all, only her sanity.</br></br></br></br>  <br> That has not happened yet <br>do you not understand what i'm saying<br><br>because it seems like you don't understand</br></br></br></br>  <br>A shame he seemed an honest man.</br>  <br>Yuki is becoming more useful as time goes, while Rii-san is becoming more useless as times go.<br>Does that sound right enough to you?<br>Also, it was thanks to Yuki that they calmed down and resolved the crossbow situation without major incidents.<br><br><br>Sonico is their mascot.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon, you're theorizing hypothetical situations to say she's a serious weigh down.<br><br>You can only make that statement after she has proven to be such a problem, which she really hasn't aside from that minor bowgun incident (which did shit at the end, because they still went into the uni).</br></br></br>  <br>OK she still useful, but now shes a liability.</br>  <br><br> Yuki is becoming more useful as time goes <br>Not particularly, but less insane, which means she's not a liability anymore.<br><br> while Rii-san is becoming more useless as times go. <br>Not particularly, but she's more insane, which means she can be a liability now.<br><br>Does that sound right enough to you?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't get why everyone doesn't carry a weapon. They should all be armed with baseball bats at least.</br></br>  <br>I'm fairly sure anyone can kill a zombie, it's just that Shovel got that role.</br>  So what did Megu-nee mean by that she was the cause of Yuki's condition?  Oh boy, Miki's gonna regret throwing the pistol away when the uni girls decided to rape her.  <br>She proposed the idea of the school life club and such.</br>  <br>that seemed like a rash decision.</br>  <br>Yuki seemed to start going craycray after Megu-nee's death.</br>  <br>I would argue that you should accept the fact of Yuki being more useful.<br>She is learning new things to help everyone and still is one of the reasons that maintains them from breaking down.<br>But whatever works with you.</br></br></br>  <br>Megu-nee wouldn't have been able to say that if she was already dead, you know.</br>  <br>I'm just tired of people shitting on Rii-san for no good reason, sure, she's a little crazy, but that's all, not enough for all the shit she gets.<br><br>I've said numerous times that Yuki has her own useful role as the team's mood maker, just like Rii-san is the team's mother, Kurumi is the brave one and Miki is the smart one.</br></br></br>  <br>Yuki is being useful spiritually and mentally. <br><br>Without her, the whole group would fall apart and everyone else will go batshit insane. She's like a backbone of the group.<br><br>But yes, physically and situational awareness wise she is useless.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon, that has been stated many times already.</br>  <br>Yes, the ddl zip was uploaded to batoto as-is, and it's the same on Madokami.</br>  <br> which did shit at the end, because they still went into the uni <br>Again, that's not how you judge a problem. <br><br>But whatever, ignore storytelling because muh waifu, you're about half of the target audience of this manga anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well genius I'm replying to his reply on how Yuki is not useful.</br>  <br>Anon, it's actually me who has stated that many times, and I didn't say she wasn't useful, I just said she hasn't particularly become more useful than before, she's just not insane anymore and as such she's not a liability (just like Rii-san is not becoming less useful, but is becoming insane and may lead to trouble like Yuki did before).<br><br><br> But whatever, ignore storytelling because muh waifu, you're about half of the target audience of this manga anyway. <br>You don't have to get this angry, I'm not ignoring storytelling either.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget Rii-san has continuously shown to be unable to handle stressful situations, aside from the time she saved Kurumi. When Kurumi got bit, when the helicopter exploded, when they didn't find her sister, she had to have someone else save her. Yuki on the other hand seems very capable of handling them, surprisingly.</br>  <br>Of course you're ignoring storytelling. I would need more than 1 image to shut you up, but I'm not gonna put the effort.</br>  Gakkou Gurashi Extra Chapter 3<br><br>http://pastebin.com/hgr2a3ZL<br><br>I'm gonna be honest, this actually kind of scared me. It's the secret emergency manual. Whoever mentioned the volume 4 one, I skimmed a bit and it seems fine to keep going ahead with.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuki had the benefit of being delusional back then.<br><br>Also she was handling Kurumi well enough, if Kurumi turned into a zombie someone have had to kill her.<br><br>Let's just hope it doesn't escalate further than Ruu.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where are these extras coming from?</br>  <br>From her diary<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/112999<wbr>146/#113004805<br> I wanted Yuki to smile. <br> I was the one who built the illusion of a normal school life. <br> When she started regressing, it was me who thought it was a good thing. <br> Everything that led up to this is my fault. <br><br>She saw the signs and did nothing to stop it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>You realize Kurumi is talking about Yuki keeping them sane right? This is something that has been acknowledged already.<br><br> ignoring storytelling <br>Sure man, whatever you say, Rii is bad and is going to kill them all because of your hypothetical situations.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Alternatively, widespread infection may lead to mutation, and different versions may appear <br>oh shit<br><br> the manga goes to shit if they introduce Tyrants </br></br></br></br>   Nobody mentions how Yuki is a boss navigator, allowing them to use the car to go where they want and not waste time and resources getting lost <br>Also, she's not delusional anymore. She's playing along with Rii-san to keep her calm.<br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br> Chapter 3 <br>At long last, we have the manual. Thanks.</br></br>  <br>What can I say, after looking and Rii's and your mental state I think you two are perfect for each other.</br>  <br> You realize Kurumi is talking about Yuki keeping them sane <br>??????<br> Yuki cleaned the place for us <br> meanwhile Rii was having a mental breakdown and would have literally suicided into zombies and Megu-nee's image if it wasn't for Yuki <br><br> Rii is bad and is going to kill them all  <br>See how you write? You aren't really interested in seeing the story progress, you just want to defend your waifu. I have no interest in that shit, I'm just stating the facts and if you want to ignore the current arc they're setting up includes Rii going insane, then that's gonna be bad for you when it explodes on her face.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fast zombies confirmed, Mii-kun shouldn't have thrown that gun away.</br>  <br> She's playing along with Rii-san to keep her calm. <br>This is pretty obvious. Kurumi and Miki actually talk about it in chapter 36.<br><br>Yuki is useful for that though, I totally forgot about it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn, its creepy as fuck.</br>   that part with zombie Megu-nee's thoughts <br>Jesus Christ.</br>  I've been thinking, don't you guys find Yuki as the strangest in the group (strongest as in keeping shit together and being sane)? <br><br>I feel like Kurumi, Rii and Mikki would have snapped and go apeshit if they were in Yuki's postion.</br></br>  So what the fuck is wrong with Yuki? Miki already read about all kinds of personality disorders and she said there's no way her condition is real.  <br>Technically speaking, zombies shouldn't be real either.</br>  <br>She was delusional about the factual reality of the school, but not about her friends' stress and mood so she ALSO overacted to soften the mood (without knowing exactly where the distress came from).<br><br>Now she remembered all about the outbreak and is sane, but keeps doing the act for the same reason.</br></br></br>  <br> ?????? <br>When Kurumi says she has always been a great help (and Miki supports this), she's talking about how Yuki has been the one keeping the group together with her cheerfulness. Learn to read between lines.<br><br>There is  too, which I forgot, but she clearly wasn't talking about her navigation skills in your image (that's beside the point though, Yuki's navigation is really useful).<br><br><br>  You aren't really interested in seeing the story progress, you just want to defend your waifu.  <br>Do you know I was being ironic right? You're making up hypothetical developments for the arc to justify calling Rii-san a "serious weigh down", that's not "stating facts, it's literally making up shit. <br><br> to ignore the current arc they're setting up includes Rii going insane <br>I've never said she's not going insane either.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit gets pretty damn heavy pretty damn quick<br> If you have broken the seal on the main book, tolerance and sympathy are no longer virtues. <br> Prepare yourself. <br><br>And the advise to isolate affect people. At gunpoint if necessary. Using deadly force as required. Their deaths being nothing compared to the loss that could occur.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She definitely doesn't get as much credit as she deserves from the fan base, I think. She pays close attention to the others' mental states and does what's necessary to help them and is pretty quick thinking in a pinch.</br>  <br>Isn't it already obvious that that's her role?<br><br>Rii-san is the responsible one, Kurumi is the brave one, Miki is the smart one and Yuki is the heart.<br><br>They all got their issues, though Miki is likely the more composed one because her own issues were solved already in the school arc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> When Kurumi says she has always been a great help <br>Are you retarded? I'm talking about the other fucking panel, where Kurumi states Yuki cleaned the whole place up for them. Something Yuki did not do at the beginning of the manga (i.e. taking care of stuff). Therefore, Yuki has become more useful.<br><br>Damn man, you really need to understand what people say to you.<br><br>I wasn't the guy talking about who weighs down what, but if you think Rii hasn't become less reliable and is close to being a liability just from what has already happened, then I fear for your future in life.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   emphasizing the whole "self-efficient" and independence in the extras  <br>I'd wish the author explains the back story and the relationship between the infection and the school.</br>  <br> Reproduction Forbidden <br>YOU CAN'T STOP ME</br></br>  You know what's really funny about GG?<br>It has less drama than Hanayamata.</br>  How old are the characters? Yuki said she's second year or third year (I can't remember it). Does she mean they're 17-18?  <br> I wasn't the guy talking about who weighs down what <br>That was the argument in the first place, you dolt.<br><br>  but if you think Rii hasn't become less reliable and is close to being a liability just from what has already happened <br>Except I know this, and I've clearly stated it, numerous times, for example here: <br>(Yuki navigation skills are really useful though, and I said already that I forgot about them)<br>If you're going to come into an argument and say shit about me "ignoring storytelling" then at least have some idea of what the fuck you're talking about.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>17-18<br>Miki is 16-17</br></br>  <br>They're all 18 except for Miki, who is 17, I think.<br><br>They're graduating this year after all.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Does Hanayamata have an unexpected big plot twist or something?</br></br>  <br>I think everyone is18 while Mii is 17</br>  <br>No, it's just drama.<br>Drama.<br>Drama.<br>Drama.<br>Endless drama.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuki's the oldest. Probably.</br>  <br>GG seems to just take things as they are instead of making a big deal about it, its about schoolgirls surviving a zombie apocalypse after all.</br>  <br> But yes, physically and situational awareness wise she is useless. </br>  <br>Nothing came out of that though</br>  <br>She didn't do anything though, Kurumi and Mii-kun got out on their own.</br>  <br>So do we know what's in the main book?</br>  <br> But yes, physically and situational awareness wise she is useless. <br>Yuki doesn't even need a shovel to fuck a zombie up. She can kill one with a broom.<br>Don't underestimate her, she is one tough as nails motherfucker.<br><br><br>But Yuki's more than that. She's also the best leader.<br><br><br><br>It was foreshadowing for what she'd do later on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>How does it matter whether she did anything, the point is she was ready to do things<br><br>This is stupid, do you think Shovel's fuckup with the zombie "doesn't matter" because they got a cure too? Or that Rii's literal disfunction as a human being that almost got her killed first, and the other two raped by bikers later, is "okay" because it didn't actually happen?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> She can kill one with a broom. <br>When did this happen? I read the entirty of the manga and I didnt see this happen, hell the site I read it from didnt even show Shovel pickup the gun.</br></br>  <br>Full retard.</br>  <br>Just before when they held their mini graduation ceremony and leaves the school for good.</br>  <br>While it's too early to say she's useful for the physical stuff, it's definitely wrong to say she isn't useful situational awareness-wise. Again, I bring up the case where she saved Miki and Kurumi with the school's PA system, and the time she announced that zombies were coming and called for the others to get into the car and leave.</br>  <br>Looks like you skipped over a couple of chapters entirely.</br>  <br>Rii's issue got nothing to do with the bikers.<br><br>Who are likely good guys anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>Old enough</br>  <br>No wait, that was all in chapter 29. Just one chapter you skipped over.</br>  <br> Yfw the bikers were actually girls <br> Yfw the bikers chased them in a car because they recognized the van <br> Yfw the bikers   were friends with Radio 111 </br></br></br>  <br> Using XXX virus as a base, it was made to be heavily resistant to existing vaccines. <br> Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, vomiting blood, and hemorrhages. Infection through blood. <br>Sounds like they used Ebola.</br></br></br>  <br>those girls must have been wearing shoulder pads.</br>  <br><br>Yeah I just noticed,<br>Just read it and shit, that was a really important chapter.<br>I guess after that moment Yuki stopped projecting and is only pretending.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Got to armour up</br>  <br>Kills Africans<br>Harmless to Americans<br>Turns Japs into zombies</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>So these would be chapters 6.5, 12.5, 18.5, and 24.5, right?</br></br></br>  What are those side antenna on Yuki? Ear hair?  <br>The big plot twist was that it was full of drama, and so /a/ shit all over it.</br>  <br>wow that's interesting and lead to more and more theories about the outbreak<br><br> Alternatively, widespread infection may lead to mutation, and different versions may appear. <br><br>so we can assume that there's possibility the virus is mutated inside shovel's body and turned her into wesker-like being right?<br>also what strain that spread through the story? i think it's beta strain but this<br> The virus should die out seven hours following death. <br>makes me doubt about it. and we don't know anything about omega strain<br><br><br>ever heard that ebola's victim waking up from the dead? also so many theories that said ebola is actually biological weapon</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Spooky.</br>  <br>There's two possibilities<br>It's the Omega strain, in which case whatever, they're just being creepy<br>It's not the Omega strain in which case get ready for TYRANTS  pls no </br></br></br>  <br> Instead of Wesker I see Kurumi becoming something like this guy.</br>  <br>nah i think the author wont add tyrants to the story. it's gonna be fucking mess if he do that<br>but running zombies like in 28 days later may be appear</br></br>  Since they are high school girls, how do they do to suppress their urges ?  <br>I want this manga to go the I AM A HERO route. Except with loli deaths and schizophrenia.</br>  <br>You mean, do they itch their ditch?</br>  <br><br>What are you implying? They're pure and innocent.</br></br>  <br>They are 18, they must have sexual urges of some kind.</br>  anyone got a webm of the end of ep1  <br>Except that Shovel-chan probably has a torn hymen from all that training, probably.</br>  <br>Yes, I do.</br>  <br>No. No sexualizing the gurashis!</br>  <br>Hey man, I understand. It's a zombie apocalypse. You have other things to do like chop a zombies head off with a shovel<br>But sometimes, you just have to dedicate some time to yourself, you know? Just lay back, relax, check if you restocked on tissues</br></br>  <br>can you tell me more about that manga? i have heard about i am hero but i haven't read it (even though the comic book has released in my country for a while)</br>  <br>They're so damn lewd though.</br>  <br> pure and innocent <br> Kurumi wanted Senpai's dick <br> Miki flirting with a drunkard <br> Rii-san's lewd body <br><br>Yuki is likely to itch the ditch.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  You're all delusional degenerates!  <br> so we can assume that there's possibility the virus is mutated inside shovel's body and turned her into wesker-like being right? <br>I doubt it. They're talking about biological warfare, the drug probably just blocks the lethal mechanism while otherwise allowing the infection to run its course, so that the zombies don't recognize the soldiers you send to clean up afterward.<br><br> also so many theories that said ebola is actually biological weapon <br>Ebola is naturally occurring, it primarily affects bats but is lethal in humans. There are no doubt weaponized strains under lock and key though.</br></br></br></br></br>    Just finished reading.<br>Are there more translated chapters somewhere? Batoto has up to chapter 35 and the last update was two months ago...<br><br>And what's all that about the riders you keep talking about?</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, they're pure and innocent. If any of them tried to jump a dick Yuki would bust through the door shouting that Megu-nee says no, because Yuki is smart and knows what happens when you have sex in a zombie story.</br>  Reminder.  <br> What happens when you have sex in a zombie story? </br>  <br>Check the archive  or this fucking thread </br>  <br> recommending the usage of weapons on police officers if they don't agree to follow the guidelines in the book <br><br>God damn. Also, this manual reminds me of those US Government manuals on what to do after a nuclear apocalypse.</br></br></br>  <br> Also, this manual reminds me of those US Government manuals on what to do after a nuclear apocalypse. <br>Link?</br></br>  So the alpha strain is a mushroom engineered for higher infectivity and range. Remember the insect mind controlling fungus Ophiocordyceps unilateralis? Referred to as a zombie fungus, it counts as a type of mushroom. The beta strain is based off a virus and sounds just like Ebola. <br><br><br> ebola's victim waking up from the dead? <br>This means both bases have the zombie theme.<br><br>Then we have the omega strain with details redacted. Perhaps they somehow combined alpha and beta to create omega, a biological weapon that afflicts humans with the mind control of the fungus and the lethality of ebola. This may be what the zombies have, or perhaps a version of it that mutated to gain the ability to breach their containment safeguards.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Usually, you die.

Just imagine an old postman on a bicycle suddenly showing up in front of the School-Life club back when they lived at the school and handing them change of address forms, very timidly asking them to fill them out (though asking them every time he spoke), and when they finally fill it out he takes it and leaves, weaving through zombies and ringing his little bicycle bell.</br>  <br>that's makes sense. but in other zombie story drugs can lead virus mutation so yeah i think the probability isn't 0<br><br>i seriously scared when thinking about if weaponized strains leak and causing the outbreak<br><br><br>i remember when the news occurred the headline's first sentence is 'Zombie Outbreak?' <br><br><br>well if i look at the cover, i know you're right</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>You realize the whole "ebola zombies" thing was a hoax, right?</br></br></br>  <br>Use capitalization.</br>   Ghost are drawn to voices <br> Megu-nee shows up <br>I heard that she's dead, kind of spooky</br></br>  <br><br> If you have broken the seal on the main book, tolerance and sympathy are no longer virtues. <br><br>Creepy. Anyone know if the next extra is the "main book"? Would love to read that.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I got the impression that it's definitely an outbreak of the mysterious Omega Strain that has caused the zombie apocalypse. Seems the Randall Corporation, likely with the help of the government and researchers at St. Isidore University, have been researching biochemical weapons for some time, (probably what caused the disaster in 1967 or whenever mentioned earlier in the extras. The first two strains don't sound like they match up with the symptoms of the disease we've seen, it has to be the omega strain that causes zombification. That;s clearly the one they were most worried about, and the one where all info has been redacted.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128107994 <br>I saw "vomiting" in the beta strain symptoms and assumed that's what the zombie one was, because we do see an infected person vomit. I just assumed the blacked out text meant it wasn't something we were supposed to know about just yet and was a new strain we haven't seen yet. I mean, I think it'd be somewhat strange to black out any text in a document like that otherwise. The only other time text was blacked out was when it was contact information, and that's because those names and phone numbers are irrelevant to the plot. Maybe the zombie virus really is the omega strain though, I don't know.</br></br>  <br><br>Text isn't blacked out because it's irrelevant to the plot, it's redacted, like in government documents where some information is classified, or court documents released to the public, but with certain bits of information withheld.<br><br>The Omega strain is obviously the zombie virus. As you mention, the beta strain includes ONE symptom that we have seen one infected person have, and barely at that, he looks like he could have just been drooling heavily, or foaming at the mouth, while omega strain description seems to indicate massive explosive vomiting, shitting, and hemmorhaging blood from every orifice. The rest of the beta description doesn't fit at all with the symptoms of the zombie infection. Neither does alpha. It's so obvious it's an outbreak of omega I'm honestly shocked that it's even a point of discussion.</br></br></br></br>  Ahahahaha ha ha<br><br><br>;__;</br></br></br>  <br>Stuff was redacted in the in-manga version as well.<br>Possibly teachers get to know less than other people that may receive the same document without redaction.</br></br>  <br>Also FEMA with their "most efficient use of fuel in body disposal" study (made in 60 or 70, something like that) after a nuclear war. Basically said to use earth moving for adults and set the children on fire because higher %body fat.</br>  <br>I like how Yuki's eyes are blocked out in the top left panel.</br>  <br> IRS <br>For what purpose?</br></br>  <br>This reminds me Kurumi has a big sudoku flag on her.</br>  Really I'm kinda more interested the the school guide book posted earlier.<br>http://pastebin.com/xKr64Qre<br><br>With stuff like<br> Ever since that terrible event in 1968, <br> 1968: This year, Danto's (男土) population was cut in half. It was later called Danto's Night. <br><br>and <br> On school grounds, water from Wicked River {name translated} or groundwater is pulled and purified with on-site equipment, part of which is used for drinking water or pool water. <br> Atop the seven hills, a sword saint glimmering in the heavens, in the Wicked River a nine-headed poison spewing serpent <br> Day came to the seven hills, and you who have forgotten the saint, we shall hold in our hearts his blade as his descendants <br><br>Shit's happened before. most recently killing half the town.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I read the manga yesterday and was not impressed, but it still was enjoyable. Do you guys consider it great or just good? How much would you rate it out of 10? I'd give it a 6, it was decent. It feels like it would be better enjoyed reading it as chapters come out than marathonning it though.  There's no going back at this point  <br> They don't have the balls to kill off a main character like that; she lives by the grit of her teeth </br>  <br>Also there seems to be an inordinate amount of things focussing on October. <br>Maybe complete coincidence but the school festival, creation date of the emergency manual, and the calendar in Miki's mall are all October.<br><br>There's also a lot of sevens in the school history, and 4 mains + 3 uni girls = 7.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't think that's true, because it says <br> If [the main book] is opened without permission, under the incorrect circumstance, or leaked to a third party, immediately contact the XXX disposal unit.  <br>Seems like it'd be very counter-productive to actually black that out. Also, with the emergency contact list. They give us the Randall Corporation as an emergency contact, but black out the phone number. I haven't read any Government documents like this, but it seems silly to me to black out the publicly available phone number to a business if you give out its name. And even though they give us the name of the Randall Corporation they black out the names of the army base, the air base, and the hospital, the three of which are irrelevant to the plot. It seems too inconsistent and it feels hard to understand why they blacked out certain information unless I assume they were blacked out because we as the reader aren't supposed to know.</br></br></br></br>  No way back.  <br>I didn't think it was the case but this page is making me think, maybe they DO know Yuki's sane now and it's an accepted fact. I wonder why the whole megu-nee shit and other stuff akin to delusions (from Yuki 'pretending') keeps coming up then.</br>  <br>And of course...</br>  <br>Rii-san's the one bringing Megu-nee up and shit now, because she wants to believe Yuki's still the retarded little womanchild she could depend on to be depended on.</br>  <br> this isn't about cute girls doing cute things <br>That's exactly the reason I picked it up, it's a nice twist on the genre.<br><br>Kurumi is best girl right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not quite but I love her still</br>  <br>what chapter is this from</br>  <br><br>For my guess on what happened in 1968, see previous post:<br><br><br><br>The Randall Corp has been up to no good in that town for a long while, and some sort of biochemical weapons testing mishap is what caused "Danto's Night".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuki is, both pre and post delusions.<br>Besides, Shovel will be dead in 10 chapters anyway</br></br>  <br>35, when they find the kid zombie with the message around his neck.</br>  <br>One thing I'm curious about is the mention of a First Aid package marked "Alpha".<br><br>Does that mean there are packages for each strain distributed? If so, they were pretty lucky Miki got the right one.<br><br><br>She's definitely my favorite, but post-delusion Yuki is getting up there too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> yfw   little sister's outfit suspiciously looks like Yuki's teddy </br>  Yuki  post-delusion  &gt; Kurumi &gt; Miki = delusional Yuki &gt; Radio-chan &gt; Rii &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Teddy bear <br><br>Uni sluts are in a much lower tier until more chapters.</br></br>  <br>That wasn't subtle at all to be honest.</br>  <br>Are we still on this? Everyone knows by now that she's the bear  Or the author is purposefully making it seem like she's the bear to play with our expectations </br>  <br>Kurumi &gt; Miki &gt; Yuki &gt; Megu-nee &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kei &gt; Rii</br>  <br>   Or the author is purposefully making it seem like she's the bear to play with our expectations <br>That would be retarded and gimmicky. Twists for twists' sake are awful.</br></br>  <br> they were pretty lucky Miki got the right one <br>Who said she did? If the strain she has is similar but not equal, it would explain why she's still turning, albeit slowly.</br></br>  <br>They'd probably still turn no matter the serum, we can assume the pilot got the right serum (if there are many strains) and he still turned</br>  <br><br>I really hope he doesn't do this, but it seems to me that he will do SOMETHING unexpected with Ruu, or else he wouldn't give us so many hints that she's a delusion. I can't fathom what, though.</br></br>  <br>Of course the reader isn't supposed to know. But that's not because it's a new thing that we haven't seen yet.<br>It's because they want to impose the idea of a conspiracy blacking out secret documents, and also because the details aren't important. The actual strain of virus on the loose doesn't change the fact that it turns them into zombies. Type alpha and beta certainly don't include zombification as part of the prognosis, only mystery type omega may contain such a thing.<br><br>As an aside, they should find a new copy of the manual with the contact numbers intact, and have the numbers be real and hooked up to an answering service. Have it just be a loop of "This number is not accepting calls currently, if an A-1 has been declared, follow the instructions in your manual" or take messages and see if you can get some juicy lines to run over a radio in the anime or something.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Was it all a ruse?<br><br>wow!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Eh, hopefully it's just done for impact when it breaks on her face, you know with some panneling and transitions.<br><br>I'd have preferred to show straight up that it was a bear and have it be "Ruu" from Rii's POV only occasionally, but what we have so far is way better than some retarded twist just because<br> lol im the author im always one step ahead xdd </br></br></br></br>  <br>This won't go Kotoura-san route because it actually delivers the suffering, in Kotoura-san's she stopped suffering just right after ep 1.<br>I expect this to be get more and more popular.</br></br>   1 day and 3 hours remaining <br>More animated shovel soon.</br>  <br> Rii sees her zombified dead sister right in front of her while holding onto Ruu <br> Rii flips the fuck out and rips Ruu apart, then breaks down sobbing as her imouto saunters toward her <br>Alternatively<br> Rii fucks the GGs over hard because the universisluts "kidnap" Ruu <br> Rii gets bitchslapped by Kurumi to get a hold of herself and gets the same treatment Miki gave to Yuki, but with less tact given how imminent things are going to get worse for them at that time <br>Rii's so much more dangerous than Yuki ever was, goddamn.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One thing I'm wondering about is if they already suspected something was with starting to feel wrong with Rii at this point or not.<br><br><br>Well it clearly worked to some degree at least so either all serums have some kind of effect regardless of the strain or they got the right one.<br><br>If the former is the case though you have to wonder what the long-term effects are.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't wait.</br>  <br>See, I was thinking the reason they didn't mention any zombies or zombie-like traits was in case the document got leaked. I mean, in a zombie apocalypse, you'd clearly know what it was referring to if the infected were exhibiting the symptoms mentioned in the booklet even if it didn't mention the very important "zombification" symptom.<br><br>I hope you're right anyway, though. I'm not really interested in seeing another type of zombie in this series.</br></br></br>  <br>It's the moment when she talked about how she wanted to go back to the club room that tipped them off that she was losing it.</br>  <br>That was after she already imagined Yuki as Ruu, so Yuki at least already suspected something at that point.</br>  <br>It was kinda obvious. Yuki's delusion contributed to the moral of everyone. Rii's delusion is totally personal and most of all too recent. She's a true time-bomb, just like Kurumi. The problem is, she might explode sooner than Kurumi, it all depends on the uni sluts at this point, which could very well fuck over the entire group before they are decimated by Shovel-chan.</br>  <br>Nervous lads</br>  <br>I said in one thread that she could be half zombie but then there was one anon asking why she hadn't attacked anyone yet. Is it possible that Rii brought extra healing serum and that's why she's safe at the moment?<br><br>Then again though, after reading it again I feel that the author never really tried to bring retarded twist after dropping some hints in earlier chapter. What I mean to say is that the author would always give the expected conclusion from those hints and never really did like what this anon says </br></br></br>  Gakkou Gurashi! - School-Live<br>Too bad they missed out on the opportunity to make the subtitle "Living at the school" which would've had a nice double meaning as both an innocent description of the club, and as a message to the world.<br>If the dub gets that title I want royalties by the way.</br></br>  Ruu's an odd case because it seems obvious, but at the same time the fact that the author is maintaining a facade around such an obvious thing makes you think perhaps it's TOO obvious and something is wrong.  <br> uni sluts <br> decimated by Shovel-chan <br>Kurumi killing living people? I want to see this.</br></br></br>  So, predictions, do we get a new OP yes or no?<br><br>If yes, new song or just new visuals?</br></br>  <br>It's probably to provide contrast with when Yuki was insane. Besides, Ruu doesn't provide the same comfort as insane-Yuki.</br>  <br>Watch as Yuki is the one that calms her down after she freaks out over having killed living human beings, no matter what they tried to do.</br>  <br>It's almost a given. Things like "humans are the worst enemy in post-apocalyptic situations" always finds its place in such scenarios. Kurumi is by a large margin the most skillful when it comes to fighting, especially with the übermensch reflexes she demonstrated in chapter 37. She's gonna kill some humans and perhaps experience an emotional breakdown as she realizes she's starting to turn inhuman physically as well. The situation might get worse or better at this point, it depends on Yuki (mostly) and Miki. We can all agree upon the fact that Rii is useless at this point.</br>  <br>I want to see them abandon the uni sluts to be killed by zombies after their plan to betray them blows up in their face. And Kurumi and the lead uni slut look into each others eyes for the last time, the slut pleading for help, but Kurumi turns around and walks away.</br>  <br> shovel rape time <br>I looked around but could not find those chapters. What does that mean?</br></br>  <br/>  You know when an anime became a hit?<br>When the Japs make awesome MADs like this one<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>76143</wbr></br></br>  <br>Billy Herrington and Friends x Gakkou Gurashi OP soon?</br>  <br>The SnK is pretty unfitting and I wish Nico would stop giving me eyecancer.</br>  <br>I felt like I wasted my time watching this.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Screaming Nips.<br><br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>76476</wbr></br></br></br>  Apparently, the anime would have quite a different plot structure than the manga. There's taroumaru in the OP, megu-nee beyond the desk barrier and all that. Though I heard that the anime script is written by the manga author, so it's fine.  <br><br><br>Come on it wasn't bad.</br></br></br>  <br> megu-nee beyond the desk barrier and all that <br>That wasn't Megu-nee, that was just a zombified student.<br><br>Manga's author is doing script composition, so yeah.</br></br></br></br>  <br> That wasn't Megu-nee, that was just a zombified student. <br>Maybe, I just have a feeling that it was assumed to be her. The portrayal is quite similar to the megu-nee from the manga, too. That panel with the teeth and half-rotten lips</br></br>  <br>Insane-Yuki was sort of harmless, especially because she could step up anyway if the situation called for it.<br><br>Insane-Rii on the other hand, now that's a walking timebomb. Especially because her delusion is not about zombies being there or not, but it's a delusion that interacts with the zombie situation and clouds her decision-making</br></br></br>  <br>I can't fathom why you'd think that. They look nothing alike at all. The zombie's even wearing a student uniform.</br>  <br>It's not written by just the manga author, he called up like 5 different Nitro+ buddies to write the anime with him.<br><br>They're probably gonna change shit up a lot.</br></br></br>  <br>Ah. My bad then.<br><br>Yuki is strong, while Rii is weak. One more push and she'll crumble into madness.</br></br></br>  <br> Kurumi: Oh god, I killed a person.  <br> Yuki: (with a dead look in her eyes and a small smile on her face) If you didn't kill them I would have. We're all going to make it out alive, no matter what it takes. Remember that sympathy and tolerance are no longer virtues in this world. You did the right thing.  <br>And then Kurumi will cry and they will hold hands with each other. Good end.</br></br></br>  <br> Insane-Rii on the other hand, now that's a walking timebomb. <br>She's been putting everyone at risk these last couple of chapters, but I can't really blame her, I just feel pity for her.</br></br>  <br>why is it always the stable ones that end up being the most unstable as soon as something actually happens?</br>  <br>I'd rather Kurumi's girlfriend Miki do the comforting.</br>  <br>Probably because they keep it all inside until they just break. Remember the  helicopter crash and explosion?  Until then Rii-san has been holding on pretty well, after that moment she just couldn't hold it in any longer. She's losing it.</br>  <br>Miki's always the anxious and stressed one, she couldn't calm down a butterfly.</br>  <br>She was never stable to begin with. She was just escaping the truth in her own way by playing the onee-san.</br>  Is Rii's little sister even real?  <br>Miki and Rii are dead because Rii accidentally dropped and went after the teddy in a dangerous situation.</br>  <br> Please don't throw me away <br> Help me <br>I really loved all these little things that were in her delusion.</br></br></br>  <br>Can we agree that GG is a pretty good and well thought-out work?</br>  <br>Sounds like only Rii would be dead then to me.</br>  <br>Yeah I can agree to that.<br><br>You guys hyped for the Library  where we get to see that Yuki was alone the entire time? </br></br></br>  <br>She could be the Teddy bear that Yuki left in the school.</br>  <br> Miki flirting with a drunkard <br>it was miki's friend that interested in the leader. some drunktard tried to get close to miki but her friend saved her.</br></br>  <br> that moustache </br>  <br>Rii would lose it and get Miki killed as well, because Miki would try to stop Rii from going back and getting the teddy while the two of them were being chased by zombies.</br>  <br>No, that's the little girl that Rii thinks she found in the school, not her sister.<br>I'm asking if Rii's actual little sister that she remembered is even real.<br>It might just be another facet of her descent into madness.</br></br></br>  <br>We don't really know.</br>  <br> Rii that low <br>Don't make me angry now faggot.<br>You can't insult my waifu.</br></br></br>  <br>I can't see why she wouldn't be, her using Yuki as a coping mechanism and then remembering her sister when she couldn't use her like that any more makes sense. You could be right though, maybe making something up to make herself feel more useful?</br>  <br>If ep2 delivers good shit just like ep1 then GG will be confirmed as AOTY.</br>  <br>Maybe. There's some really good stuff this season, though.</br>  <br>It's pretty bad. It's Naruto AMV level bad</br>  <br>She only thought Yuki as imouto but didn't much for her actually.<br>I believe the whole "I had an imouto" is another delusion she is having at the moment.</br></br>  <br>I hope there's porn where the men in that group snap and rape Kei and Miki at the same time.</br>  <br>WeII if you didn't like it then it is okay.<br>I liked it though.</br></br>  <br>I was expecting... something else. Anyway, thank you.</br>  <br>Yeah but Japs are all about GG right now.<br>If anime keep the hype going on then it will be AOTY.<br><br>Will we get that scene though? Anime kinda fucked up by adding Miki in Ep1.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What are you, some sort of pervert?</br>  <br><br>Fatalpulse is totally going to do a doujin about this isn't he?</br></br>  <br>One can only hope.</br>  <br>No, that's not quite right, where do you think we are? You call that anon a faggot and tell him to kill himself right now.<br><br><br>I think they'll keep a lot of the core moments familiar to the manga and the library is quite distinct when you look back at it after reading a few more chapters. I may be naive but i'm sure the author will integrate Miki in some way that's acceptable like he did (in my opinion) in episode 1.</br></br></br></br>  <br>For some reason the designs just scream Fatalpulse so I hope so.</br>  Why does this show get so much praise? Sure, the first 6 episodes were interesting, but then it turns into generic slice of life moeshit; it tosses all interesting concepts to the wayside. Am I missing something?  <br>Way out there hahaha yo momma so fat, when she jump for joy she get stuck! Jk jk</br>  <br>I wanted to kill myself very violently</br>  <br>biting your own penis off and sticking the piece part will suffice</br>  <br>So when some autist on 4chan hears how I bited my penis off, I could be turned into a meme? I'd rather kill myself normally but still very violently</br>  <br>how about giving yourself endless papercuts then bathing in alcohol</br>  Any good ones that's not Kinnikuman.  <br>I skipped out on this because it aired censored. Where the BDs worth the wait?</br>  <br><br>kek that file name tho</br></br>  What do you think of the Higurashi anime?  <br>only oldfags remember</br>  I try not to think back to it having not played the VN. <br>Why is it even a VN, with no routes, no voices, terrible pictures and sounds. Why can't it just be a book?</br>  Which higurashi would you fuck?

Whether it's because he's tired or because of its fading popularity, the more this arc goes on the more he seems to be rushing through things.</br>  <br>Everywhere else is already fucked, where else are they going.</br>    everyone jobs, the chapter <br><br>But GODAMNIT, I refuse to believe Liltotto/Gigi/Bazz are dead, did they seriously went against their broken ex-boss who has gotten even more overpowered without any plan ? And what's more this happen right right away at the start of the battle ? Cut this shit Kubo, I want more of them.<br><br>Though Giselle looks as "dead" as in her previous defeats so there is still a chance.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yhwach has future sight. Whatever they plan will be useless in front of his eyes.</br>  <br>Because Jump rankings are mostly about what series Jump wants to try and push, and theres no reason to push a series that doesn't have an anime and is in the last arc.</br>  <br>So ? They could still try something besides attacking him straight ahead like retards. He's not omnipotent. Might as well say the same thing for the shinigamis and we know they're gonna win. Why making them back to set all the 'abandoned soldiers" revenge if it's only to make them die right at the start of the battle ? Especially when it was shown Liltotto is far from being stupid.</br>  <br> Bad guys want to join you in fighting the main bad guy <br> They run off to their deaths while occupying strong enemies <br>Two birds one stone.</br></br></br>  <br> I really wonder why bleach is suffering so hard in the ratings. <br>because focus on boring characters. At least the esada were fighitng against fan favorites or where fan favourite themselves. But who the ever living hell cares about bazzbe and lord toofsy?<br>Blue balling us with a few anel of grimjow, el, aizen and kempachi before changing focus didn't help.</br></br></br>  <br>There is no fading popularity, its been pretty steady since this arc has been going on.</br>  Hype  <br>They foolishly try to get revenge and fail, showing how strong Toofsy and Bach are. I see no problem with this at all.</br>  <br>What in the world is this thing?</br>  <br>Yeah but that's the thing, they didn't occupy shit. Ideally you'd come up with a plan to make them useful before you use them as fodder.</br>  <br>They should know their strengh way more than the shinigami, there is foolish try and being retarded. Might as well help a bit the shinigamis to get all the changes on their side. It's like they weren't even trying.</br>  <br> Zaraki and Mayuri double team <br>This has the potential to be one of the craziest fights yet. Hope Kubo doesn't fuck it up.</br></br>  <br>*all the chances on their side</br>  Why did Kubo have to kill off Gigi? But at least now things are getting interesting, Kubo has my attention. Oh and I guess Hisagi is also dead so no bankai from him.   Hisagi snipped and dies like a literal bitch <br>KUBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</wbr></br>  <br>I always keep repeating Ken and Mayuri gets way too much screentime when others characters would deserve some, but damn, this duo is way too good.</br>  <br>I fear it's another fake hyppe that will be followed by some asspull ass resurection to mirrror what happened with the sternritters a few chapters ago.<br>Might b Orihime, Mayuri, or Squad 0, most won't stay dead.</br></br>  <br>And he has a particular hatred for Kensei and Mashiro too, they both jobbed off panel by never mentioning them ever again for the rest of the ark.</br>  <br>They aren't trustworthy enough to actually plan around or rely on, but they are disposable enough to let them tag along and rush in ahead.<br><br><br>The sternritter wanted revenge for themselves, even though they knew they could never win. I couldn't really see them actually seeking help from the shinigami.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> They actually think Hisagi is dead <br>Kek.<br><br><br> Mayuri <br> Too much screentime <br>No such thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The X's shot seemed to go through around where the heart/lungs are, and his shots go through everything. And you know Kubo and his hearts.</br>  <br>Try reading Bakuman to know about Jumps inner workings thanks</br>  <br>Oh, Kubo will definitely fuck it up.</br>  <br> They actually think Hisagi is dead <br>Just like Kira is not dead, right? Kakked at Kubodrone.</br></br>   Miracle is the team joke more than levar hiself <br> power is literally miracles <br><br>I can already see the resurection plot coming.</br></br></br>  <br>There's a bit of a difference between getting shot and having half of your torso blown away. It also seems that you're forgetting the golden rule of Bleach deaths, that no matter how injured someone is, as long as a top tier healer gets to them before they die they can be saved. Hisagi might be dead and he might not be, but its too soon to assume for sure and be mad about it.</br>   Fuck it... I'm gonna kill it. <br><br>Kenpachy best Bleach.</br></br>  rip in holes hisagi  <br>The only thing worth being mad is how shit Bleach became.</br>  Grimjow, more like Grimjobber amirite?<br> cafeine AND milk poisoning <br>he's literrally sharting himself to death</br></br>  Hisagi will survive because the sniper didn't blow his head off.  <br>If you don't like it why are you reading the chapter as soon as it comes out and then discussing it in the thread?</br>   liltotto portrayed since the beginning as a caculating rational person <br> dies after attacking the very source of her power heads on <br>This is the worst. Gigi being tupid is OK but liltotto as literally disposed from the tory there with no dignnity</br></br>  <br>Reminder that when an arrancar uses resurreccion their wounds are healed.</br>  <br>It was obvious from the beginning that the sternritter were launching a rage filled suicide attack. The only people upset by this are liltotto fans who wanted her to survive.<br> MUH WAIFU IS 2 SMART 2 DIE LIEK DAT </br></br>   Liltotto, Giselle, Grimmjow and Hisagi literally one-shooted <br><br>Also, based Askin Nakk Le Varr and Lille<br><br> None of them died, right?! Right?! Gigi is still alive, huh? Huh?! </br></br></br></br>    tfw Grimmjow got really beaten like this and will be out of the battle for months <br>  tfw Askin does exactly the same thing to Nel in the next chapter and it works </br>   Hisagi down <br> Grimmjow down <br> Rebellious Quincy down <br> Kenpachi nearly decommissioned <br><br>Not a bad chapter.</br></br></br></br></br>  What does having an imouto feel like?  <br>It's cool until she turns 16</br>  Salty milk and coins  <br>What happens then?</br>  Shit.<br><br>She blue-balls you until she moves out and gets with your otouto's best friend, spending the rest of herl life smoking weed and getting pregnant.</br></br>  <br>Spends all her time on his smartphone</br>  I warm, soft daki.  <br> until she turns 13 <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br>Coins of salt and baggy milk.</br>  <br>Really not as fun as it looks.<br><br>Really.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably like your ban for not being /a/-related.</br>  <br> implying that even matters anymore </br>  <br>Actually, it's annoying until she turns 16. She's this loud girl that constantly seeks your attention and you try to keep away from her because of the kid's "eww girls" mentality. Then you grow up and finally see the light, but it's already too late, because she either hates your or is totally indifferent towards you.<br>It's basically the first episodes of oreimo for all eternity.</br></br>  <br>If imoutos are not /a/-related, then I don't want to be here anymore.</br>  <br>wow, that's depressing</br>  <br>I assume it's significantly worse than having an otouto</br>  <br>The worst. She´s no longer cute, and some unknown guy bangs her in the room next door at the end of the week. Sure, they keep quiet, but the bed noises can´t be muted. Dad doesn´t care, must have stop loving her since she dresses like a slut. <br><br>On the other hand the girl next door that´s the same age as lil sis is one adorable mess, and is just the sweetest with her silly crush on you. Blood related imoutos are the worst.</br></br></br>  <br> video game mayms <br>go offline</br></br>  <br>Too bad Oreimo went to shit after such a good premise. Always the stupid incest shit the nips must do.</br>  <br>replace imouto with girl next door. problem solved</br>  It's shit, she a fucking cunt. I'm glad she left the house and is living with some 30 year old college prof.  <br>you failed as a big brother<br>and since you still seem to live with your parents, you also failed at life</br></br>   All these salty oniichans <br>Maybe the problem is that you didn't look after your imouto.</br>  <br>I'm not a bad person, but she is.</br>  <br>see </br>  <br> Maybe the problem is that you didn't look after your imouto. <br><br>Exactly what I did, having a fake imouto is the best.</br></br></br>  <br>Meant to quote </br>  Terrible, you won't get a free house if you have siblings once your parents die. <br>You'll have to share.<br>Sharing is gross.</br></br>  First they're adorable and lovable<br>then they turn in to horrendous screaming teenage cunts and break your heart<br>then if you're lucky they grow the fuck up eventually and become lovable again<br>if you're unlucky they major in women's studies</br></br></br>  <br>She is an annoying bitch.<br>Dunno if she being manipulative but  I like it when she 'depends' on me </br></br>  She is disgusting 3D Creature <br>why should i care</br>  <br> if you're unlucky they major in women's studies <br>that's what honor killings are for</br></br>   tfw your imouto wants to watch anime with you <br>What should I get for her /a/</br>  <br>Monster musume</br>  <br>Oreimo</br>  <br>Naruto</br>   tfw imouto visitng her best friend inthe USA <br> I don't have any control over her there <br>I'm scared of anything "bad" happening</br></br>  <br>What city?</br>  <br>Like niggers for example?</br>  <br>Detroit</br>  <br>She's probably getting the black mamba as we speak.</br>  <br>I'm 26 and an only child.<br><br>I've always dreamed of being able to spend afternoons in the city with a sister holding hands with her. <br><br>I imagine that it's nice being able to hold hands with a girl your age and not have it be romantic/sexual or shit like that.

Is she a slut?  Reminder that Funimation censored Shimoneta. These little chibi illustrations are not from the original broadcast.  <br>But technically they are. There's two broadcasts in Japan, one censored and uncensored. Funi has rights to the censored one</br>  <br> tfw laptop is being repaired <br> tfw have to stream everything on my iPad <br> tfw can only find HS </br></br></br>   Censoring an anime about fighting against censorship <br>Sasuga, Funimation</br>  So which subs are showing the uncensored version?  Why would you ever watch a show like this on release?<br><br>This is the epitome of Wait til the BDs</br></br>  <br>fuck funimation not getting the rights to the uncensored like the retards they are.</br>  <br>Over half the fun of a show like this is shitposting about it on /a/ while its airing. You can just rewatch the BDs later.</br>  <br>there already exists an uncensored version and funimation just isn't simulcasting the uncensored version<br><br>don't even need to wait until BDs</br></br></br>  <br>What about hiryuu?</br>  <br>People who eat up Funi and CR's shit won't know.<br><br>They don't care about us. <br><br>Why do your jobs when most people don't care, and the only ones who do don't pay you?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Funi did the censor of the broadcast <br>Japan did their own censoring since it was on local stations. The AT-X broadcast was the only uncensored one.<br><br> Funi is still shit regardless. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Who does the subs for AT-X then?</br>    <br><br>If there were two broadcasts then why is only the censored one uploaded?</br></br>  <br>So what you're saying is to stop and wait for the BDs?<br><br>Welp, add that to my list right next to monmusu.</br></br></br>   censoring a fucking mushroom <br><br>This is too far.</br></br>  <br><br>Do they get to choose, or are they idiots? I hate censorship, even if censorship is supposed to be "the joke".</br></br>  <br>I think Ohys-Raws are unsensored and probably Leopard, so anything using them is likely to be alright. <br><br>I don't know why someone would watch funirips anyway, censored or not they're still hardsubbed eyecancer.</br></br></br>  <br>The only reasons to use funi is if they're the only ones available or for speed if you're an impatient baby.</br>  <br><br>Hiryuu subs the AT-X broadcast. They should have their release by today.</br></br>  <br> Over half the fun of a show like this is shitposting about it on /a/ while its airing <br>I don't see what's fun about shitposting in a slow as fuck threads this show gets. Besides, you don't even have to watch this anime to participate in discussion</br></br>  <br><br>Would the AT-X version even have any nudity or this show supposed to be another SYD?</br></br>  <br> speed <br>Nut usually there's another option within a few hours or a day at most, even if it's just a better raw and subs ripped into an .ass. No one on /a/ should be so much of a pleb that they ruin the entire watching experience just because they want to watch it 5 minutes after it airs, that sort of behaviour is for people who post on anime forums and who actually pay funi and crunchy to watch their shit.</br></br>  <br>Probably not, but AT-X doesn't censor the hand movements and crap like the Mushroom licking girl</br>  Actually, checking again it seems Ohys and anything that uses them also has that weird censorship.  Which is annoying because I actually liked Funi's script better that Hiryuu, so things like Senketsu and Clawhammer are out.   <br>How's AnimeRG?</br>  <br><br>Using the uncensored broadcast and Senketsu subs.</br></br>  <br>Would it really be so bad to just get Ohys and Senketsu?</br>  All the raws i could find for episode 1 had the censorship, and funi's version had more censorship for whatever reason.  <br>I thought it was a banana.</br>  <br>I think they only have one episode out so far. Even then, it is still partially censored</br>  <br>That seems to be the middle ground, better than Funi eyecancer but still with some shitty censoring.</br>  <br>You do realize that the "uncensored" version still still censored. A lot of it, like that screenshot of the intro you posted, is intentional</br>  I can't tell if this thread is baiting or just plain retardation.  What show?  <br>this, would wait for the BDs but fuck its gonna take so long</br>  <br>wouldn't count on it being removed in the BDs. It's pretty obviously part of the show.</br>  <br> liked Funi's script <br>Go kill yourself or go get some standards.</br></br>  <br> Over half the fun of a show like this is shitposting about it on /a/ while its airing <br>Hate this meme</br></br>   [Hiryuu] Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai - 02 [720p H264 AAC][7E4F86E3].mkv <br>Based Hiryuu saving us from funi once again!</br>  <br>I don't believe you.</br>  <br>Go check nyaa. It's there.</br>  So wait, if I want the best quality of the 'uncensored' version, do I get Clawhammer (which is just pre-combined Ohys and Senketsu) or AnimeRG?  <br>You get Hiryuu. Why would you watch funishit?</br>  <br>dont care, the chibis are kawaii and they make whats underneath them appear more lewd than what it actually is</br>  <br>Either way, I still want her to dominate me.</br>  <br>I really hope people don't take that out of context. Last thing I need are shotacons in these threads.</br>  So tanukichi has big cock?<br>How are japanese able to self insert into that?</br>  <br>That picture was more interesting before I could see what it was supposed to be.</br>  <br><br>Because you thought it was going to be a real dick?</br></br>  <br>There are some parts of Funi's script that I liked better, aside from stupid bullshit like changing mushrooms into carrots or whatever that was. Plus, there's still some censorship with the Hiryuu version.<br><br>From what I can tell there are three versions currently floating around: The regular censored Japanese version, the even more censored Funi version, and the almost no censorship/no censorship version.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes they are, funi just copy pasted them over different scenes.</br>  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE KAJO  <br>Tell me about her? Why does she wear the mask?</br>  <br>To make sure her cover isn't blown</br>  <br>No, there are two.<br><br>Normal version and funi-censor-it-more version. There is no fully uncensored.</br></br></br>  I want to teach her the meaning of life  <br>Ah. Thanks for clearing that up, then.</br>  <br> the almost no censorship/no censorship version. <br>no. you've been bamboozled.</br></br>  <br>Too bad, she's already getting pregnancy lessons from me</br>  I think the censorship can enhance the humour sometimes by adding a funny sense of ambiguity to things.<br><br>Like  for example. With the censored version it's implied that there's an actual dick in the drawing so it's funnier that everyone doesn't know what it is and mistakes it for a mushroom. Revealing it as an actual mushroom kinda killed the joke there.</br></br>  <br>Only modern, newage faggots who think everything and everyone is child abuse would.

If you're not new then you know that's not the main issue with Funi.</br></br>  The flustered face of a pure-hearted maiden.  <br><br> not understanding that only a bare minority of actual fansubs are worse than Funi/Crunchy <br>Don't lump the good guys in with the dipshits in groups like Commie. You're just going to look like a colossal troll AND give the good guys a bad name. Did you bother taking note at how much more legit bitching than usual went on last week with how Funi handled the first episode? I'm not going to slam Funi about everything or call them the worst, they've done good translations before, but this show isn't an example of one.<br><br>tl;dr, I don't have a tl;dr for this one, read.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'd take their script over some lazy ass translation done by fans. <br> implying Funishit's translations isn't amateurish <br>Funi is retarded. They try too hard appeal to their murican audience and change words/terms when it doesn't match the original description. They even use the exact scripts of theirs dubs in their subs which makes no fucking sense.</br></br></br>  That little chibi is part of the show and it will probably still be there in the BDs, you fucking retarded. AT-X is actually uncensored, and maybe if you weren't so fucking inpatient or casual you could enjoy a better version without having to whine about it.  Who is subbing the uncensored version?  <br>Me, but only if you ask nicely.</br>  <br><br>Here's the HS version before you call me retarded. FUNimation and Crunchyroll are ALWAYS gonna get the censored version. Seriously, I thought this was common knowledge? How new are you, OP?</br></br>  <br> A lot of it, like that screenshot of the intro you posted, is intentional <br>Nope, it's just crappy TV censoring and will be uncensored in BD.</br></br>  <br> FUNimation and Crunchyroll are ALWAYS gonna get the censored version. <br>Crunchyroll is doing both censored and uncensored versions of okusama ga seitokaicho.</br></br>  <br>See</br>  <br> Who is subbing the uncensored version? <br><br>I just watched hiryuu version AT-X broadcast episode 1... and it was censored!</br></br></br>  You guys are fucking ridiculous.<br><br>I'm watching the supposed "good" subs and they're just using different wording. In some cases Funi's wording is even better. The bias is real. If you guys want to wait longer just so you can be anti-mainstream hipster then be my guest.</br></br>  I think Clawhammer also subs the uncensored version.<br><br>I man I could see the mushroom and everything.</br></br>  <br><br>I don't remember any of these being in the episodes</br></br>  <br> probably </br>  <br> crappy TV censoring <br>yeah, because it makes total sense to censor some hand gestures but not any of the actual pornographic images.</br></br>  <br>Sometimes censoring is not that bad.</br>  So is this like a meme or something? Or are people actually retarded enough to not realize that a lot of the censors are part of the show?  <br>Funi crappy translator, pls.</br>  <br>I don't mind their translation but look at what they did to the second of episode of Logos</br>   that grin <br>best girl.</br>  <br><br>Still looks a lot sexier than that stupid chibi. I can fap too it cause the ass is fat. Shit like the chibi in the OP is partnof the show though and it does so in a funny way because the gesture she's making is something children do and isn't really considered obscene.</br></br>  <br>Daily reminder this is a shounen series so the censorship was expected from the start.</br>  <br>It's Japan, what did you expect? For example, on AT-X they censor blood and gore too, while left all nudity - see Freezing broadcast.</br>  <br>This how it supposed to look</br>  <br>Ohys-Raws + Senketsu Funi OCR</br>  <br> he wasn't there for slicing simian </br>  After reading through the thread, is Clawhammers stuff on nyaa uncensored?<br><br>He uses Ohys's AT-X release and Senketsu's subs.<br><br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>08386</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's from the OP</br>  A or B?  <br>Only if you have ADHD - incidentally a lot of retards on /a/ do in fact have ADHD.</br>  <br><br>Also all broadcast versions will be censored unless it broadcasts first on AT-X for all of you casuals out there that will surely complain about this in the future.</br></br>  <br>Eye bags are justice.</br>  <br>I'm confused. What's the difference. The first one is lower quality, but only because it's bigger.</br>  <br> watching shitshow. </br>  <br><br>A, because her sleep deprived eyes are part of what make her attractive.</br></br>  <br>A. Too generic without the dark circles</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>A</br>  <br>A<br>I want to stay up all night with her.</br></br>  <br><br>Fuck off, faggot. I bet you only watch srs anime for srs and mature people such as yourself.</br></br>  <br>The only part thats uncensored is the shit covered up with chibi images and it adds absolutely nothing to the show. You'd be waiting longer for nothing.</br>  <br>I literally do not understand why anyone would not choose A.</br>  <br>You have the shittiest taste if you think this fodder is worth waiting for the BDs.</br>  <br> Dislikes: Peace and Love... </br>  <br>The Gangsta thread is this way &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>oh wait. There isn't one.<br>Is that why you're mad, kid?</br></br></br>  The eyebags signify her inability to sleep because her brain is always working and keeping her awake.<br><br>Eyebags are CURIOSITY!<br><br>Eyebags are SCIENCE!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not everybody subscribes to your "glorious" American capitalist ideology.</br>  <br>I'm glad I helped you discover a meme from 2008, summerfriend.<br><br> point objects <br>Was a big thing on /a/ at one time.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And you have the shittiest taste if you think it's not. This show is actually enjoyable and so is the source material. It's fucking hilarious. I'll bet you're the person that's just salty that the Kangoku Gakuen adaptation is shit and now you want to shit on the other JC show this season. Have fun waiting for the KG BDs though :^)</br></br>  <br> The bias is real. <br>You don't know what you're doing, do you?</br></br>  <br> 28111410(You) <br>So it's censored on AT-X aswell? I'm still gonna watch it, just curious.</br></br>  <br>Both.</br>  <br>The first one is blurry as fuck<br>Here's the 720p</br></br>  <br>I never realized how hot she was until I saw this.</br>  <br>Eye bags can be genetic anon,  I have thin skin underneath my eyes so I always have bags. </br>  <br>I didn't say it wasn't enjoyable, but I make a clear distinction with seasonal fodder and shows that benefit from BD releases.<br><br>Nothing that's censored takes away from the quality of the show. Especially not enough to warrant waiting for BDs.</br></br></br>  <br>But Hiryuu are good, are you a homo or something?</br>  <br>Nice deflection.</br>  <br> mfw 6 inches is humongous in nippon </br>  <br><br>B. Eyebags are gross.<br><br>There's a reason girls wear makeup to cover them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Genetic bags are not that heavy.</br>  So /a/ which release is the fastest one out and is uncensored with subs?  <br>You'd be surprised.</br>  <br><br> implying this show is seasonal fodder <br> implying this show won't benefit from BD releases <br><br>The anime you're looking for are Monster Musume and Prison School</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ouch</br>  <br>The censorship in the AT-X broadcast is intentional and just part of the show's running gag. Its not as heavily censored as the regular/Funi's broadcast,</br>  <br>AT-X has the uncensored versions of shows, typically, but if the studio itself inserts the censors, the station can't remove them. The censors that remain on AT-X are for self-deprecation of the show and its plot and style of humor. In other words, it's supposed to be there to begin with. The censored version used for the streams/streamrips adds censorship on top of that.<br><br>Nice missing my point, though I should have been clearer since you're clearly too lazy to try to understand. Lemme put it this way: you're a fucking hypocrite.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, enjoy your low quality sex jokes faggot.</br>  <br><br>Read the fucking thread you retard, there I spoonfed, you.</br></br>  <br>Link me to a post you moron, I read it already.</br>  <br><br> being this new </br></br>  <br>I'm wasn't saying Funi is better, sorry for not being clear. I just don't think non-Funi subs are objectively better when all they do is use different wording. It all comes down to which phrasing you prefer.</br>  <br>Alright, thanks.</br>  <br> implying /a/ isn't filled with low quality sex jokes </br>  <br>I thought his name was Chainsaw Chimpanzee</br>    <br><br>Low quality=\=unfunny<br><br>Just because the jokes are juvenile doesn't mean they aren't funny or enjoyable. Hell even american children's cartoons have sex jokes. Ever heard of El Chavo del 8? That show is literally pure hearted, play on words jokes and it still manages to be one of the greatest shows of all time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm mad that her hair is brown.</br>    <br> being an autistic fuck who doesn't understand Japan's censorship </br>  <br><br>Obviously you didn't read well enough or you're fucking lazy, either way I'm not spoonfeeding you again, you little baby.</br></br>  <br><br>It's not though, maybe if you took the time to observe the fucking picture you'd realize that it's a reflection of the light coming in from the window.</br></br>  <br>Yes, AT-X is still censored, but it's LESS censored.</br>  <br><br>This right here is literally the answer to the whole thread.</br></br>  <br> spouting retarded shit <br> get called a retard <br> YOU DUHT UNDERSTAND <br>Okay.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's still colored brown.</br>  does this happen in real life?  <br>Too bad /a/ can't read.</br>  <br>I want to impregnate her when she's her normal bespectacled self.<br>That normie shit turns me on!</br></br>  <br><br>No need to be butt blasted, enjoy your show.<br>Fucking 12yo.</br></br></br>  <br>My hair is black but it becomes brown in the sun or really bright lights</br>  <br>When a girl is too stupid to know what her vagina is for and ends up masturbating by accident</br>  <br>Only buttblasted kiddie I see here is you shit taste-kun.<br>Why don't you go watch a mature anime for mature people such as yourself.</br></br>  <br>Picture this: <br> You haven't fapped ever  <br> You're in High school  <br> You have something in between your legs multiple times more sensitive than a penis  <br> something angular stimulates it  <br> yfw </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe in Saudi Arabia.</br>  <br>Funi dev, please.<br>You don't need to keep shilling. We all know that Hiryuu is better. The fact that you're implying that the wording is different shows that you're already not qualified to judge.</br></br>  <br> can't back up your claim <br> resorts to shitposting <br>Prove us wrong you presumptuous cunt. Oh wait you can't faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>I bet her clit is huge. Hitting it on a corner like that is pretty hard normally with all the meat flaps and shit around it.</br>  <br>Same kind of lighting. Her hair isn't as bright a brown as it is in that picture.</br>  <br>I want doujins and I want them yesterday</br>  Hey guys is this the newfag thread?  <br>Hiryuu are not very good either, though.</br>  <br><br>And the light isn't directly on it like it is in the other picture either. Also people have different drawing and coloring styles. But you seem like a little bitch with autism anyways.</br></br>  <br>Yeah. What brings YOU here, /a/non?</br>  <br>Retarded imbecile faggot, it can't be "proved" either way until BD's out.</br>  <br>How so? They're several steps further than Funishit.</br>  <br>Clearly everyone else thinks otherwise.</br>  <br><br>Go back to /v/, faggot.</br></br>  <br>Today it's choosing between shit and less shit. Same as with Gangsta, only Hiryuu slower and better than Underwater.</br>  <br>My biggest complaint is the giant symbol. Hiryuu says it's supposed to be a dick, not a pussy like in Funi. Besides that, everything else was on par and/or better.</br>  <br>A<br><br>I usually dont get a boner so easily but damn.</br></br></br>  <br>Lighting is more direct here. As for the style it's not that I don't like it, I just prefer muh jet black hair on my waifus</br>  <br> everyone else <br> 3-4 shitposters that give no shits about anything factual <br>ok</br></br></br>  <br>Never been on /v/. How do you like it there?</br>  <br><br>Why are fansubs getting lazy?<br><br> Monster Musume has been out for 2 weeks and no quality subs <br> Overlord doesn't have quality subs <br> Prison School doesn't have quality subs <br> Gate doesn't have quality subs <br><br>Fucking hell</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  B-b-but my fig gesture  This show is retarded<br>Even a horny 13yo would not like this shit god</br>  <br>Thanks for the input.</br>  <br>Obviously you shouldn't give a shit about people who don't give a shit.</br>  <br><br>Then stop posting /v/ memes, fucker.<br><br> inb4 yuh no /v/ memes so yuh must b frum /v/! </br></br></br></br>  <br>Cool beans</br>  <br>Overlord has decent subs.<br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>10769</wbr></br></br>  <br><br>You're so cool.

You haven't, so fuck off.<br><br>The "dev, please go" route is a nice deflection.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll be honest I don't think people are hounding for quality subs for a show like Monster Musume</br>  <br>which one is correct? i don't know nipspeak, and i especially can't hear over their sound effect censoring it.</br>  <br>Liking this show is a meme on /a/, we don't really like it but the threads are funny.</br>  <br>Well if you know /v/ memes you must be from /v/. Also what does inb4 mean?</br>  <br><br>Are they even any good? Literally have never heard of them. Same with AnimeRG</br></br>  <br>I'm not the other two guys but whatever man, don't think that only 1 person on /a/ right now dont like this shit.</br>  <br> fansubs getting lazy <br>I don't believe that's the case. If anything, they put more effort into their releases then they did years ago. They're just low on manpower.<br><br>/a/, why aren't you joining the cartel?</br></br></br></br>  <br> funny threads  <br> on /a/ </br></br>  <br>i'll have a got at A while B fucks me with a strap-on</br>  <br>Sorry anon, i'd like to know as well. They both agree on it being a power plant symbol at least.</br>  <br><br>I would join but don't know moon. If some one just summarized all of the dialogue for me I would definitely reword it and sub it though.</br></br>  <br>Well, it has active fansubbers working on it. I watched it without paying attention so I can't say whether it's good or not but it's decent at the very least.</br>  <br>sweet opinion</br>  <br>If you don't like a realistic depiction of the future that's your problem.
