[ Wakaba thread!<br>This anime's all cute and colourful, but it's short as hell</br>  It could be shorter though  and it's shit.   PIN PON NARASHITE<br>PIN PON TAIKEN SHIYOU<br><br> I can't stop listening to the OP, help </br></br></br>  Is Wakaba autistic?  <br>Yes, and that's why we love her</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Better than Kiniro Mosaic, at least.</br>  <br>Cute as hell though.</br>    <br>It is literally Kiniro Mosaic with all the shitty parts taken out.</br>  Mao best girl    <br> no Yoko, no Karen and no fucking Alice <br>Seriously, it's perfect.</br></br>    HQ Version: https://d.maxfile.ro/nouwmodenj.web<wbr>m</wbr>  <br>you...</br>    <br>I thought you said you weren't gonna bother with this show?</br>  <br> That was confusingly enjoyable. </br>  <br> this is my first time on /a/, what's it about? </br>  <br>This is the most disappointing anime I have seen in my entire life.<br><br>I misread the synopsis and thought it was going to be a SoL/comedy about a group of innocent schoolgirls slowly turning into gyarus.</br></br></br>  <br> Wakaba = Shino without shitty blonde fetish <br>Perfect indeed.</br></br>  <br>Mao is Karen lite though.  Which is a good thing, since she never gets as obnoxious.   Better voice, too. </br>  We were told Nao is a fujoshi. When the hell are we going to see that?<br><br>Also... Rie Murakawa can sound like that? I'm used to her being Mitsuki from Kinmoza and Megu from Gochiusa.</br></br>  <br><br>This guy<br> different opinions are bait <br>This show is much better than Kiniro.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hell, why didn't Yui Hara continue this after 2013?</br>  <br>I figured I can still get away with doing the entire episode each week, rather than doing random images/scenes. It's fairly low-effort.<br><br>Gakkou Gurashi threads are too spoiler-heavy. I need to read the manga before I can start bullying properly there.</br></br></br>  <br>my prayers have been answered <br>is there a possibility you can do symphogeah next</br></br>  <br> Mitsuki from Kinmoza <br><br>Who?</br></br></br>   my favorite show this season is an 8 minute short <br>This depresses me.</br>  <br><br>Who knows.<br>KinMoza is her best-selling work, so she probably has to continue with that.</br></br></br>  <br>Beautiful</br>  <br>Girl on the left, Yoko's sister.</br>  <br>The most fuckable one.</br>  <br>That's surprising. I never would have thought you'd be deterred by spoilers.</br>  <br>Same here.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YO3<wbr>_PgFEv4M</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Send help </br></br></br></br>  <br>Wakaba is the girl I want to be when I'll be a highschool girl.</br>  <br>Single when?</br>  <br><br> You'll never be a highschool girl </br></br>  <br> Megu from Gochiusa <br><br>Who?</br></br></br>  <br>Is there any gif like this yet with the other girls?</br>  <br>Girl on the right.</br>  <br>Mao deserves a gif, she's the best dancer in the OP. Nao's dance was a little too showy.</br>  <br>It looked more like the kind of dancing I'd expect from ouendan than cheerleeding. Which is still cool, and pretty fitting for her.</br>  <br><br>Mao is best girl.</br></br>  <br> But I'm a Wakaba fag. </br>  <br>My nigga</br>  Tomorrow is the day, right? Can't wait.  <br><br>She has a lazy eye.</br></br>  <br> vlcsnap </br>    <br>I literally will, I just need to master alchemy and transmutation,</br>    Mori's gone to Japan though. Boo.  <br>How can you make good anime series with 4 chapters of 4-koma? It's impossible because this anime is about nothing and it's poorly designed. Also dialogues are pretty bad, character design suck and graphics isn't anything special.</br>    <br>It's cute.<br>That's literally all that matters.</br></br>  <br>It's cute, colourful and 7 minutes long, I can cut it some slack for being generic.</br>  <br>Ganbare, anon!</br>  <br><br>Cute Girls anime is not for you then, look for something different.</br></br>  <br>It's 7 minutes, so you won't get burned hard.</br>  <br><br>Watching it as cute short in background is ok. I'm still hoping it'll get better gags.</br></br>  <br>Depends on the show. <br><br>SoL, I couldn't care less to learn that Karen gets her hair cut, or what the deal with that oboe player is, or whatever. But something with an actual story to it, I want to experience first-hand, rather than just be told, "Oh yeah, that character dies" weeks in advance of it happening.<br><br> /blog </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That clover got some sick moves</br>  <br>Clover true best dancer</br>  <br>Never noticed that...</br>  <br>i'd give her zedong if you know what i mean</br>  <br>I love Shiba-san's D cup so much.<br><br> OP single when ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>PIN PON<br>I<br>N<br><br>P<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   OP single August 26 <br>TOO FUCKING LONG</br>  <br>Made me chuckle.</br>  <br> August 26 <br>Well, shit.</br></br>  <br>Karen doesn't even get her hair cut- she pulled off that wig trick again to troll everyone.<br><br>INCLUDING MY POOR KUSSHI, HAVE YOU NO CHILL KAREN</br></br></br>  <br>Did someone say D-cup?  I'd like rainbow sherbet please,to make sure there is gay oozing out of this show. </br>  <br>That excitement was so cute. I'd love to treat Wakaba for an ice.</br>  <br>I really like the faces in this anime</br>  moe chan a cute<br>also mao/nao skinship when?</br>  <br>Are there items in this manga anyway?</br>    <br> no Karen <br>It's shit by automatic default.</br></br>  <br>Is the clover implying 4chan?</br>  <br>OP of the season.</br>  <br>If the synopsis on neregate looks interesting it's almost definitely a short</br>  <br> graphics <br/></br>  Is this yuri?  This anime is like eating a box of strawberry pocky and washing it down with a vanilla shake.  <br>Not yet...</br>    Are they all friends with Wakaba out of pity?  <br>At first, but then they realised she has loads of money</br>  <br>Anon, you might be a plant.</br>  <br>There's a certain gift in being able to have a show with no drama yet is still able to really pull in emotions out of the audience. Dramas are the easiest way to generate those from people. A highly traumatic event, couple to root for and to get sad for when they have troubles or die. Cliffhangers to force you to tune in next week because implied sudden death. Dramas are actually easy mode in comparison in terms of ease in getting emotional connections from the audience.<br><br>As an example in shitgatsu wa kimoi no kuso, you have Arima as your weaked will traumatized protagonist, 2 cute girls to act as the love interest for your shipping need and another dude as the rival for the main heroine affection. So you thought he overcame the trauma after his successful cameback recital with the violin slut? Think again, he reverted back to his old shell once the slut faint and all his flashback to his dead mom came back faster than you can say WOW. Is this what the baka waito gaijins think of good anime with a good drama?<br><br>For a genuine SoL (moeshit as you normalfag like to call it) to draw genuine laughs, tears, nostalgia and familial-bonding type feelings without needing any drama or plot at all, is an achievement not at all to be fucking written off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is just too innocent and didn't have friends (I suppose) before.<br><br><br>Only that Mao bitch is the one after Wakaba's money.<br><br> Plans to get ice cream <br> Doesn't have money <br> Gets invited anyways <br> Start eating it <br> Suddenly she doesn't want it anymore <br><br>What a bitch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  bump because i just got here and wakaba a cute    Mao a shit.  Bakawakaba  <br>A cuter Baka than Shino. Shino a shit.</br>  <br>Why is this poster so shit? He ruined the whole thread.</br>  <br>Your wife a shit. Fight me.</br>  <br>I want to fuck Alice in the anus.</br>  <br>Shino is a wonderful person. Please no violence.<br><br><br>Get out. You're not Shino.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I will save her from her lesbian phase with the power of the dick.</br>  <br>Too late for that, she's married and happy and have a daughter.</br>  <br>Moe is pretty hot, so I wouldn't care about turning alice into a grandmother.</br>  <br>Shino craved the Karen, wanted to lock you up in a glass case and eat your hair.<br><br>No.</br></br></br>  <br>Is Wakaba /a/?</br>  I don't care if this is terrible, it's the greatest thing I've ever seen  <br>Wakaba is Shino and Karen's daughter.</br>  <br>Alice put a Shino's wig on Karen, created the Shino-bu and always compared Shino to a Kokeshi doll.<br><br>Their obsessions are mutual. It's obvious why Alice can't see anything wrong with her.</br></br></br>  <br> Alice and Shino's daughter isn't blonde <br> she most likely dyed her hair <br><br>Shino must have been a real cunt of a parent for this to happen</br></br></br></br>  <br>If that were true, either WOW THEY LOST A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM AND CHANGED THEIR HAIR COLOR or Wakaba was given up to her now brunette mom and black haired sister.</br>  <br>Or Alice actually dyes her hair</br>  <br>Main couple is bleh. The secondary couples are best like  Kusshi and Karasu, which needs more ammunition. </br>  <br>Wakaba is /a/<br>Moe is /c/<br>Nao is /sp/<br>Mao is /b/</br></br></br></br>  Has /a/ paired any of the girls together yet?  <br>The wakabas should not be used for yuri fantasies</br>  <br>From Wakaba? The anime hasn't shown enough material to do it, but the official art put them like this.</br>  <br>When you come off from the author's more famous work, it can't be helped.</br>  <br>Can't wait to see it in action.</br>  This anime is great. It's way too cute.  <br>Our Kinmoza girls are good people, adopting those girls like that.</br>  Err... why is the Blu-Ray/DVD all the way in January?  <br>Bundling all the short episodes together and releasing them post-season?</br>  <br>http://wakabagirl.com/news/index001<wbr>10000.html Maybe I misinterpreted. Is this some sort of live thing?</wbr></br>  <br><br><br><br> be carefree, genki highschool girl who people think is just a little out of touch and overly excited about everything <br> they don't know you were once all alone, abandoned by the world, a depressing existence <br> they don't know the truth, that it's really all just a VR simulation <br> one which you used to escape your past life <br> no, there was no past life <br> this is the only one there is <br> this is the world you are alive in </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the thing is, it wouldn't be complete unless there was artificial intelligence for the other characters.</br>  <br>Can we just assume it's basically on the level of Matrix VR?</br>  <br>I'm talking about in real life anon, not sci-fi</br>  I'm a 2d school girl and I like this show a lot.  <br>What does that have to do with my greentext story then?</br>  <br> because I'm imagining your story becoming real in a couple of decades but artificial intelligence won't be around yet </br>  <br>It's blonde enough for a mix of Shino's green with Alice's blonde.</br>  <br>But that doesn't make sense. If we had such advanced VR by that time, why wouldn't AI become just as advanced?</br>  <br>Yeah it's a live event with the VAs for the people who brought the series, so the disc is probably going to come with one of those lottery ticket things.</br>  <br>What'd be hilarious is if the mangaka showed up there.<br><br>She never showed up at any Kinmoza live events did she?</br></br></br>  How much for Mao?  <br>A shit.</br>  <br>You a shit.</br>  <br><br>You can't just buy the Chairman.</br></br>  So is Wakaba going to get a miniskirt or just keep her long skirt the whole time?  <br>I'm going with this for now.</br>  HOLY SHIT  <br>Somehow I think she'll keep her long skirt for the duration of the show.</br>  <br>I want to see her with Honoka's braid.</br>  <br>TWO SHITS FUSED.</br>  <br>Why are you such a bully /a/non.</br>    I want to stick my dick in Mao's butthole.  <br>no</br>  <br>I'm guessing you're a non-native English speaker.</br>  <br>No, I literally just woke up.<br>To answer the question, it's because they are two completely different technologies that just barely have a relation to each other.</br></br>  <br>So you're saying only one technology can advance over so many years and somehow other technologies can't just because they're different technologies? That shouldn't, but it sounds like that's what you're saying.</br>  <br>I'm saying it makes no sense to hold them to the same rate of advancement. They don't necessarily develop at the same pace as each other.<br>Just like how just because we have computers we can hold in our hands, doesn't mean we're capable of interstellar travel.<br><br>That's not to say it isn't possible though. There could be some breakthrough in AI overnight that leaves VR in the dust, or vice versa. But it isn't likely.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>My god. I never thought I'd ever witness perfection of such a high degree.<br>It's beautiful, no, it's beyond beautiful, it's what god created when he deflowered his wife.<br>It's like heaven had a child with itself.</br></br></br></br>  Today's the day, I'm ready for the vibrant colours  <br>Wait three weeks and watch 3 episodes back to back to back.</br>  <br> Can read it backwards <br>Holy shit.</br></br>  30 minutes.<br>Are you hype?</br>  No Mori  ;_;   <br>Hyped as shit. I need more Mao in my life.</br>  <br>Cute.</br>  <br>HS are decent?</br>  <br>Why is Karen so pink? She ruined the whole blonde fetish.</br>  <br>Kiniro Mosaic have shitty parts? I haven't noticed any. Guess I was too distracted by Karen being perfect.</br>  <br>There were a few parts without any Karen at all.</br>  <br>I don't understand, Aya and Yoko are perfect.</br>  <br>You mean Kallen, right?</br>  Is the manga just one volume long?  <br>Afraid to read two volumes?</br>  <br> S3 never <br> No more Ayaya perfection </br></br>  I'm okay with that.  <br>I'm just asking because manga-updates say it's already completed with one volume out, and that there would only be one season.</br>  <br> Watching HS when there are alternatives. <br>Please love yourself.</br></br>  <br>Anon, I think you just pinpointed why K-on!! of all things made me cry like a little bitch. After lots of fun and sillyness they slowly realizing the end of their highschool days and the weight making them suddenly to tear up torn me apart. I guess it shouldn't compare with the death of a relative or facing the horrors of war and stuff but its touching in its own way.</br>  <br>k I will.</br>  <br>HS is actually not so bad for this.</br>  <br>if you say so</br>  <br>Still better than Commie, not that that is saying much.</br>  <br><br>HS are the only ones that provide 1080p.</br></br>  <br><br>Who cares, watch Mori</br></br>  <br>I like Ayaya but I don't understand why is she so popular. Aren't confident girls better by default? Why insecure girls get so much attention? Guess its kind of a soft abusive relationship, people like her because she's easy to pick on.</br>  <br>Yeah, it's done.</br>  <br>How do you know it isn't upscaled 1080p which it likely is?</br>  <br>Commie provides karaoke. You're wrong by default.</br>  <br>They also barely are able to correctly translate anything.</br>   [HorribleSubs] Wakaba Girl - 03 [720p].mkv   <br>Commie can win you with so little?</br>  <br>[Citation needed]<br><br><br> karaoke <br> little <br>You must not like being able to sing along. Please learn to love yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  For fuck's sake, CR.    <br>I can sing along with singers.</br>  <br>I wanted one of them to play it and become a fan. I love it when that happens</br>  <br>Commie only uses the translated song, you can't even sing along.</br>  I want to marry Moe-tan.  <br>hahaha owned</br>  <br> [Citation needed] <br>Have you even seen their pathetic GuP OVAs translation attempt?</br></br>  <br>she's the best</br>  <br>You can't.</br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/waxilflhcw.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  <br> commie only uses the translated song <br>Confirmed for not watching their Log Horizon subs. They do both the translated version and the romaji.<br><br><br>Nope but I've seen their other subs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kill yourself any time.<br>Watch LH raw before doing that though.</br></br>  <br>I want to marry Wakaba</br>  <br>no subs</br>  <br>Wut? There are subs.</br>  <br>Just try and stop me.</br>  <br>I don't see them.</br>  <br>I want to marry her sister and her mother.</br>  <br>She's a good girl.</br>  <br>lol no she isn't</br>  <br>They have become tainted.</br>  <br>Their what?</br>  <br>That was seriously inconsiderate giving her a gay game just like that.</br>  Whatever.  <br>Minds.<br><br>and panties.</br></br></br>  <br>Just minds.</br>  <br>For now.</br>  <br>?abakawakaB</br>  <br>Leave the adults alone.</br>  Why is she silly  <br><br>It's easy to discern an upscale from an anime that was produced at higher resolution by simply using your eyes and your brain. Look e.g. at the small letters in this shot, they're not completely sharp, so it's probably not a native 1080p. On the other hand it might have been produced at a higher resolution than 720p. Hard to say, not going to download the 720p version to compare.<br><br>On a completely different note it doesn't matter as I'm watching my anime fullscreen on a 1080p monitor, so between watching an upscale on the fly or downloading a video that has at least a realistic chance to be not an upscale the latter wins. Unless you have problems with drive space or download limits.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That is not silly. It prevents the spread of germs.</br>  <br>But the shades, though?</br>  <br>Do you see how bright it is in there?</br>  <br>The question is who is more autistic Wakaba or Hajime?</br>  <br>Is that Aozora Stripe?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Nobody will see through that disguise.</br>  <br>It could be many different people.</br>  <br>Wakaba ain't autistic so the answer is pretty obvious.</br>  <br> Wakaba ain't autistic <br>Sure about that?</br></br>  <br> wakaba isn't autistic <br><br>what?</br></br></br>  Reminder that Mao is best girl.  Moe the moest.  Green &gt; Spiky Hair &gt;&gt; shit &gt; Red &gt; Silver  <br><br>Mao moe?</br></br>  <br>Shit, this was too cute.</br>  <br>Because she use vlc.</br>  <br>She's a watered down Karen but yes she is.</br>  <br>No, are you?<br>The fact that she is over-reacting to every day situations is not a symbol of autism, just a lack of experience. You could call her a late-bloomer though.<br>Then again, I'm not a doctor and I'm probably autistic too.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't say nice things about yourself.</br></br>  <br> 2 glasses boys <br>This should be illegal.</br></br>  <br>Mao posts on /a/?</br>  <br>It is.</br>  <br> Mao <br> Literally a demon king. <br> Literally a Marxist dictator <br>She's shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Marxists ruin everything.</br>  So, how many times did you you receive a BL game from your highschool girl friends and play it in front of mother and sisters?  <br>Mah nigga</br>  <br>Fuck communism.</br>  <br>Thank you!</br>  <br> DeadFish <br>Look at him; look at him and laugh.</br></br>  <br>I cannot laugh.</br>  <br>No, Bakaba is best girl.</br>  Are you an otaku?    <br>Just a fan.</br>  I want to whack a Wakaba.  <br>Cruel.</br>  <br>how many seconds for each section?</br>  Is Moeko poor?  <br>60.</br>  Moe is as tech incompetent as her parents.  <br>Very.</br>  <br>Was it just the word or does she find Otaku so ridiculous?</br>  <br>You misspelled pure.</br>  <br>Saying otaku is fun.</br>  <br>Now I feel bad. Not only did Moeko get the smallest cone, Wakaba had to eat the bulk of it.</br>  <br>You misspelled porn.</br>  <br>It's ok, Moeko is only hanging around for Wakaba's money.</br>  <br>It's a doggy-dog world.</br>  <br>That's not how the saying goes.</br>  Her mom's reaction is cute.  <br>Which one is the mother?</br>  <br>Very milfy.</br>  <br>Do go on.</br>  <br>The old looking one of course.</br>  <br>They both look odd.</br>  <br>The one old enough to lose colour in her hair, then.</br>  <br>She is lucky to have such cute moms.</br>  <br>Is that how it works?</br>  <br> The other person is Wakaba's sister. Stop enabling impure delusions. </br>  <br>We both know this is the KM universe.</br>  Not really surprised in the slightest that this slut is into otoge and BL games.  <br> Not knowing enough samurai <br>ばかわかば</br></br>  <br>I like the way you think!</br>  Also the subs are pretty shit, while we're at it.<br><br>So many awkward translations.</br></br>  <br>But the usage of moonrunes wasn't mentioned.</br>  <br>Improve them then.</br>  <br>We're all weeaboos here, you should know what we're talking about.<br>バカワカバ</br></br>  <br> waiting for mori <br>Anyone know what time he will be releasing?

I'm using an episode guide to see what the important episodes are and I have made it to episode 40 in just 3 or so hours. Does Yuma stop being a dumbfuck?  <br>She is the best Yugioh girl to fap to, objectively</br>  <br>Nope, he turns into a super saiyan but he's still annoying</br>  <br>Yes i do...she cute and all but its annoying in the anime all she says is "yuma" "YUMAAA" thats it.</br>  <br>Both are great.</br>  <br>Zexal might get pretty good with Zexal II but Yuma stays crap.</br>    <br>Even in the duel against this guy?<br><br>Reminder he was cheated to heck and back by the fourth "too OP pls nerf" deck in the entire Franchise and he was dueling by himself with no power ups and still won. Best duel.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>People are overthinking things, as usual. Last duel was just Jack being Jack, he likes to trash and humiliate his opponents and he thinks and acts like he is the top dog and he does to let you know it.<br>In 5Ds he did the same, but Yusei was stoic/autistic enough to not take the bait and focused in the important things. Yuya is not Yusei and Yuya is a lot more emotional about things like that, so he took what Jack said too personal.</br></br></br></br>  <br>what do you expect? He's 14.</br>  <br>Can't handle the bantz of AUSTRALIA JACK</br>  <br>Yugi was also 15 and didn't bitch and moan when shit happened either, at least not on Yuya and Yuma's levels. <br><br>Also going back to the convo earlier, a variety of formats would fix the TCG up pretty nicely combined with multiple banlists for each format, but that's too much work for KoJ/A, just make more broken Xyz and call it a day.</br></br></br>  <br> Yugi was also 15 and didn't bitch and moan when shit happened either, at least not on Yuya and Yuma's levels. <br><br>People act different? Shocker,anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Naaah, Zexal is KR Double and KR Gaim (before Kouta made it cool) .<br><br> Fusion required to henshin <br><br> Zexal I = Base Form <br><br> Zexal II = Kachidoki <br><br> Zexal III = Kiwami and   Overlord powers <br><br> Zexal Weapons = Arms for Utopia (One is even literally called "Arms") </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuya is a bit much though, I like him, but they do need to dial it back a tad.</br>  <br> You talk too much. </br>  <br>Yugi isn't as stressed out as Yuya is right now, as far as I can remember.</br>  <br>I know Yu-Gi-Oh is known for crazy shit<br><br>But this? This is just silly.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw this comic will never be translated. </br>  <br>Yugi had his grandfather hospitalized and then carded within like the first 2 episodes.</br>  <br>Zexal 1 is mostly garbage, but 2 is somewhat better and it has some really good duels towards the end.</br>  Cutest and strongest  <br> has some really good duels towards the end. <br>you mean that bullshit where Yuma literally pulls a fucking card out of his ass.</br></br>  <br>Masumi supposedly is quite beautiful and fashionable. Is she a metaphor for tan girls being considered hot in Japan?</br>  <br> strongest <br><br>I wasn't even at my strongest.</br></br></br>  <br>i want to see the tomato cry.</br>  <br>He had a way to get him back and a spirit who won all his duels for him. He also got to talk to his grandpa though the camera he was trapped in, in the manga version.</br>  <br>i dont know, but tan girls are the best girls.</br>  so why does everyone always say Zexal is shit? I've never seen anyone elaborate on this point. I'm on episode 130 and Zexal II is an improvement over the first season but I don't think it was bad <br><br>Most of the filler was alright although there were some bad episodes (like that short guy in the Heartland tournament) and the show has a lot of good points (some good characters, atmosphere, setting, music etc) <br><br>I don't necessarily disagree with the statement that it's the worst YGO series, there have been a fair amount of times while watching where I felt it wasn't nearly as engaging as 5D's which I also recently watched. Overall the duels aren't that good or memorable at all, I can't even remember how Yuma won duels that were only 10 episodes ago, but I still think the hate is exaggerated<br><br>I'd legitimately appreciate some discussion as I don't really have a problem with being proven wrong, I just can't put my finger on what is dissatisfying to me personally about the show. Also I really like some aspects of it which makes me want to say it's legitimately good but even that feels like a stretch<br><br>the IV vs. Shark duel was good, but it had some pretty shitty moments</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but what does Yuya have to bitch about? He knew Yuzu was likely safe with Yugo, didn't give a crap about any of the rest of his friends, and then gets highly upset when Jack tells him his dueling isn't fun and that his is better, which to the people of Synchro, it is.</br>   <br>I'm mostly talking about the last Kaito duel and the last 2 Vector duels.</br>  <br>I'm with you on that. Zexal is Shin Yugioh Tensei.</br>  <br>Zexal II is fine, Zexal I is the train-wreck where Yuma is a bigger dumbass than Judai (who forgot the rules half the time) and manages to constantly lose and act like a fucking tard.</br>  <br>I enjoyed Zexal, but some parts of the plot annoyed me. Like Kaito's dad being the one who created Heartland, and the reveal with Yuma towards the end. I won't go into that though. <br><br>Anyway, I don't know where Zexal stands on my list, but Arc-V is legitimately one of my least favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! series. And I know /a/ will try to call me out on having shit taste, but I don't really give a fuck because half of the people in Arc-V threads aren't even real Yu-Gi-Oh! fans, but parrots who got into it specifically because of Arc-V. And you'd be hard pressed to tell someone their entry series is bad. <br><br>So far, I feel like Arc-V is just a big disappointment. That may because it's such a fucking broad series. But I'm hoping the manga is better since they usually are. I'm also hoping some side-stories come from it, it's got a setting that looks like it'd be generous to such.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>my dislike of the show is the MC he shows no growth and he acts like a fool and ignores help until he's getting shit on, overall i hate his personality</br>  <br>To be fair to Yuuya other must be difficult for him to do his Circus Ringleader act while riding a motorcycle at high speed. The atmosphere is just not the same</br>  <br>I only have digital devil saga which I recently got on psn and haven't played much of <br><br>do people hate the SMT games or something?</br></br></br>  <br>If you want to be a true entertainer you have to manage different styles. Yusho would have agreed.</br>  <br> Didn't give a crap about any of the rest of his friends. <br>I wish /a/ didn't exaggerate.</br></br>  <br>Was Yuya even really trying to be entertaining that Duel. It didn't feel like it, it sort of just felt like he was trying to blow Jack the fuck out.</br>  <br>Crow had to literal tell him to think about the rest of his friends. Reiji had to literal tell him to think about everyone else and not just Yuzu entirely. <br><br>It's not an exaggeration when we have characters straight up telling it to his face.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean that it's an Order Versus Chaos story.<br><br>Eliphas is *very* similar to YHVH, and while Dong is not similar to Lucifer, the origins of the Barians as castways of the Astral World are similar to the forces of Chaos.</br></br></br>  <br> Yeah but what does Yuya have to bitch about <br>The interdimensional war going on.</br></br>  <br>It was Yuuya's first time and he went against the very best. I think he did it decent all things considered.</br>  <br>Didn't seem like it, more like he got upset that Jack said his dueling was more entertaining and he got upset and even more so when Jack told him his entertainment sucked.</br>  I want the zexal fags to leave. they are like dm fags but even dm fags like a show thats objectively decent/good. Zexal is just retarded.  <br><br><br><br>Because they continue in resetting Yuya's character. He was okay after the qualification of the tournament, he was focused in being the best duelist around like his dad, then they added more drama with the death of Yuto and the soul that was trapped within him, thus destabilizing his personality.<br>Then he was okay after his duel with Reiji, he was focused in rescue Yuzu, Sora, uncard all the people, and defeat Academia; but no Yuya, you must EGAO no matter what, not even in a fucking war. And so we are here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aren't all duelists warriors though?</br>  <br>well at first Yuma didn't listen to Astral at all and then he started relying on him hardcore, now he's had a duel without him and also not that it counts for much but after a while he learned how to play even though he was dueling with Astral. He'd take Astral's advice (or ignore it) once in a while but overall he learned the combos and how his monsters worked<br><br><br>yeah Yuma is a dumbass but for the most part it got better even in Zexal I, I don't think it's much of a problem that he loses though. He lost more than other protags but in the grand scheme of the show it wasn't much <br><br>How is it a train wreck apart from Yuma?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Crow had to literally tell him to think about the rest of his friends. <br>They're all competent people though, otherwise they wouldn't be Lancers.<br><br> Reiji <br>Reiji doesn't give a fuck about anyone. This is blatant hypocrisy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Zexal had a better planned story and was more entertaining. At least a better planned story than 5Ds (an extreme trainwreck, to put it mildly).<br><br>And it's not as pretentious. The very second I heard the word "prison" was the time I knew 5Ds was trying to be a seinen show when it's shonen and it's badly executed at that (FMA is also like that but plays it better).<br><br>And now Arc-V is following that shitty format. <br>We really need to leave the Synchro Dimension ASAP.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuma grows the most out of any character bar Shark and maybe Kaito. Just because his strategy remains the same, doesn't mean he doesn't grow as a character.</br>  <br>I think my reading comprehension is shit<br><br>Did you say Judai forgot the rules sometimes? Because if so that isn't true.</br></br></br>  <br>I've been watching YGO since DM first aired in the US, Arc-V is pretty fun, but to each their own.<br><br>Yuma has lost leagues more than the other protagonists, he lost like 25-30 times, he lost quite a lot. As for other problems, most of it is just Yuma, that's it. He's just an awful protagonist, outside of that the series got a bit much, most of the time it was just about magic and the rare super thing like Judai doing Prince of Persia shit in Venice or say Yusei shoryuken or Shun/Sora in Arc-V, but they went full on space saiyan and pulling magic cards out of their asses. Like cards have been pulled out the ass before like Yuya's pendulums, but they were literally drawing the cards, showing them, and then changing them in Zexal, on top of the ending sucking shit in Zexal. <br><br>Zexal isn't terrible, Yuma is just terrible and everything that typical involves his character in any way, but yes, he is less annoying in II outside of the end.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I appreciate that you're the most enlightened individual on /a/, and I wish to learn more of your secrets. How may I get in contact with you so I may finally have as an exquisite and refined taste you have for all things animated?<br><br>I'm not being sarcastic, by the way.</br></br></br>  <br>I think he cares about Reira. Maybe. Probably.</br>  <br>Okay, what is wrong with Arc-V? Like you just did what a lot of anons do by saying you hate the series but you don't say why.</br>  <br>1st generation (DM) oldfag here. So far I'm enjoying Arc-V, it's true it have some lousy parts (Yuuya's qualification filler arc was boring at points) but the parts that are good are really good so it keeps me motivated enough to keep watching, also like you said there's lots of interesting stuff happening on the sidelines that I hope gets some attention. I guess what I like about Arc-V is that so far it seems to be heading up to play with several concepts of the show in new ways so it was refreshing. <br><br>Haven't seen ZeXal in detail, I saw like 3 episodes then decided to skip it entirely (I retired from dueling as well, just recently like 6 months ago I started to return to the game).<br><br>I've been nostalgic recently and I'm watching DM again (this time in Japanese). Time will tell if o get convinced to give Zexal a second chance.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How?</br>  <br>Doujin when?<br>Duel when?</br></br>  <br> They're all competent people though, otherwise they wouldn't be Lancers. <br>Sawatari is not competent, don't you lie. <br> Reiji doesn't give a fuck about anyone.  <br>He cares about Reira, Serena, and his Ninja. <br><br>Poor wording on my part, but I remember him forgetting that the holograms weren't real when dueling sometimes, especially an under-water sequence or not knowing shit all outside of his cards. Judai was fucking dumb, but Yuma was more dumb somehow.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Never.<br> Never. </br></br>  <br> 1st generation (DM) oldfag here <br>Seeing DM first isnt being an oldfag, its the norm. The only people that'd qualify as oldfags is reading the manga before the show</br></br>  <br> but I remember him forgetting that the holograms weren't real when dueling sometimes, especially an under-water sequence <br>You mean during the Seven Stars where that happened literally once and it wasn't that Judai forgot that holograms weren't real but it was that the guy dueling him didn't finish his sentences and fooled everybody into thinking he was having a Dark/Shadow Duel<br><br> not knowing shit all outside of his cards <br>What?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm an oldfag and I agree with . In fact, Arc V was the one that got me back into the series after I dropped it midway through the 5D's WRGP since it was just getting dull. I tried ZeXal, but the duels were such a pain to watch and there were a lot of concepts I found ridiculous that I couldn't really get into it even though the Barian subplot caught my interest a bit.</br>  <br>Judai didn't know what the word fiancee meant.</br>  <br> he lost like 25-30 times  <br> counting an offhand comment about how many duels he lost in the beginning of the show that weren't even shown  <br><br>I agree about the space saiyan stuff though, I wouldn't mind it at all if they didn't pull such retarded shit out of their asses. Other protagonists had destiny draws but it was just completely over the top with Zexal. It's one thing if you use magic powers to draw a card that lets you summon your ace monster at the end of a duel but Zexal really made it into a gimmick. Barians Chaos Draw and all that. And Yuma just drew random new Zexal weapons with retarded effects. I don't see why they couldn't just give Yuma better new aces to summon with Shining Draw instead of bullshit equip cards etc, would've felt less cheap but they needed to throw on extra effects because he'd always already have his shitty ace out<br><br>Also a huge portion of the monsters all have the same effects. Overall the show also just feels like it's more focused on summoning monsters than other series, like that's almost all there is to it</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a shonen trope, anon. Goku didn't know what it meant when Chichi said they would get married.</br>  <br>How is this different from any other show?</br>  <br> MC is oblivious to love <br><br>Literally every shonen ever what the fuck</br></br></br>  <br>Two words: Executive. Meddling.<br><br>You know, the one that ruined the Dark Signers Arc? (Damn Carly VA). Or the one that made the show more larger than it should have been?<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I like Bruno, Yliaster, Aporia and Z-one (especially Bruno-chan) but their arc was very forgetteable because it was not meant to happen.<br><br>Zexal in the other was more planned, as in, a little more than 5ds and GX. It was also very childish to compensate for 5Ds pretentious pseudo-seinen plot bored the japanese kids watching the show found boring. I'm so sorry for the people who don't want to admit they are watching a children's show.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think anyone thinks 5D's isn't a childrens show <br><br>Just because a lot of people say it's the best doesn't mean they think it's ultra mature, you'd have to be retarded to think 5D's is anything other than a kids show</br></br></br>  <br>Pls no.</br>  THE NEW CHAPTER IS OUT!!<br><br>http://readms.com/r/dgrayman/219/28<wbr>65/1</wbr></br></br>  I wanna kill this fucking cunt.  <br>Enough that Allen never celebrates his "birthday" or tells anyone the story</br>  <br>I like him.

My first delivery from Boa. Thanks for drawing my pizza butt. I love it. Thanks so much!<br><br>Cheers!</br></br></br>  Because I know not everyone checks the general drawthread, I'm reposting this here.<br>I wanted to thank Orz and Sharkbro for drawing those wonderful images for me.<br>Also I won't be requesting this weekend, since I've gotten way too many wonderful deliveries the past weeks and this past weekend alone.<br>Have a nice weekend everyone.</br></br></br>  <br>Crap, I was too late  ;_; </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128209221 <br>Shhh, don't let the Boa fanboys hear you say that.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128209221 <br>oh, guess it wasn't the body</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128209221 <br>What's your problem?</br>  Boa is very decent but after that episode of "as good as doom!" yesterday the urge to shitpost is -intense-.<br><br>This is why ranking your drawfus is bad.</br></br>  Requesting Stocking drinking cocktails with chubby anon, please.  <br>It's all relative, body being too small or head being too large.</br>  /r/ing Aika in a full body shot with her eye-to-eye length duct tape over her mouth, please.

Requesting Sailor Jupiter cosplaying as Mai Shiranui, preferably in her jiggle-crouch pose on the bottom right.  <br/>  <br>Jupiter's from an anime<br>Are you saying I can't request my waifu cosplaying as Chun Li or something?

But wanting her drawn in a skimpy outfit with her tits bursting out and jiggling doesn't seem what a "normal" waifufag would request.</br></br></br>  <br> But wanting her drawn in a skimpy outfit with her tits bursting out and jiggling doesn't seem what a "normal" waifufag would request. <br>You must be new here.</br></br>  <br>You know I am, I wanna buy this game for the third time. I love the game that much.<br><br> If only I could play it on my vita... </br></br></br>  requesting this qt3.14  <br>Outsdide Mishafag and the other lewd requesters that request here and in the general who else does it?</br>  <br>Whoa that was fast! A pencil sketch is fine too, gives it a different kind of a feeling than a digital drawing. Thanks so much, it's really cute and a great way to start the weekend!</br>  <br>We do request less lewds in the WWD than in the regular drawthread, but nothing on the post itself hints to it being a haremfag, some sort of shitposter or anything but a person requesting his waifu. I mean, we do humor that fatchouli fag every weekend.</br>  <br> someone finally requested the best side-character ever created </br>  <br> Aside from the people who do it, who does it? </br>  Requesting Minatsu wearing a nontraditional miko outfit. Visible midriff and outfit matching ribbons is a plus.<br>Anything else is fine too, thanks!</br>  <br>I dunno. I haven't even the chance to save whatever <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128209612  posted.</br>  How's the coloring on all those Sharkbro drawings?  <br>Slow and painful. I won't be done with mine for a few weeks.</br>  <br>4/14<br>though those 4 are still not complete</br></br>  <br> Mishafag <br> a person <br> not human excrement given life <br><br>Well that's a bit of a stretch.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>WIPS?</br></br>  <br>Still stuck in husbando coloring duty. Next week I'll see what  and  have and pick some that haven't been colored or aren't in progress yet.</br>  <br>I am done with 3 which I'll post this weekend. Working on a 4th one.</br>  <br>It wasn't a fix, it was just a rough edit.</br>  <br>Was something wrong with it? Or I guess the one who drew it deleted it.</br>  <br>I love your work, by the way, even if my husbando is  a waifu .</br>  <br>It fixed the proportions but all he did is select and re-size the head and arm. The lines don't match up and he probably can't recreate Boa's linework.</br>  <br>So I don't get why it was deleted...</br>  <br><br>Here are the 8 I'm working on. I haven't had much time to work on them since Monday but they are all still in progress.</br></br>  <br><br>It's not much different than a simple semi-lewd request; if an artist who wants to pick mine up and draw her with her boobs busting out, that'd be fine, too. If push comes to shove, I'll just ask for a commission.</br></br>  <br>You're doing God's work Tamabro</br>  <br>Man, I love the thread police tho</br>  <br>I dont think people would take issue with this if you werent spamming the request in the general during the week and just so happened to appear here now. It looks like you are requesting here simply because it is more active as opposed to that actually being you're waifu.</br>  <br> Here are the 8 I'm working on. <br> 8 <br>Holy shit, dude.</br></br></br>  <br>zzz</br>  <br> __? </br>  <br>kek, nice stuff boa</br>  <br>no wip because don't want to open photoshop</br>  <br>Really cute. I like it a lot. Not OR.</br>  <br>Well, that is party true, as I thought it'd make sense to post in two threads at the same time for that reason, I admit it. I only requested this in the regular drawthread once yesterday, and I'll probably post in there once more before I give it a break. I have no intention of spamming it in both threads; once again, I'll go ahead and commission it somewhere else if nobody's picking it up, I have absolutely no problem with that. I'm just like most of the requesters here and don't want to start any drama regarding what makes "lewd" art.</br>  <br>Not sure if cute or scary, but good job</br>  <br>That's kawaii shit</br>  <br>No, you thought it would make sense to request it here because people actually draw in these threads.</br>  <br> this ain't candy </br>  <br>Again, partly true, but with threads like these, it comes down to trial and error and dumb luck depending on the request. I don't want to start any more beef, alright? If it's not done here, I'll fuck off myself without devolving this into a flame war. Simple as that.</br>  <br> 8 <br> a lot </br></br>  <br>How many are you working on</br>  Requesting riko taking a bubble bath  <br>When did she dress like Powergirl?</br>  <br>Roughly 40 in a queue.<br>3 are complete.</br></br>  <br>Just needs a black bar.</br>  <br>Why would anyone assume I'm anywhere near doom?</br>  <br>I see you've been the the /i/ thread too.</br>  <br>It's a new project. Not an HD remake.</br>  <br><br>Really? I usually work on one until I finish it.</br></br>  <br>Because they like you. Don't take it too personally.</br>  Requesting sleepy Tamaki wearing an oversized dress shirt as pajamas and yawning cutely please! As always anything else cute is appreciated as long as it's not too lewd  even cute lewd  . <br><br>Thanks for reading and have a comfy weekend!</br></br>  <br>Hey that was amusing, nice work Boa!</br>  <br>You made me do this</br>  <br>it seemed that you've got quite the fanclub, congrats</br>  <br>You made a real worm turn into a colorful dildo?</br>  Homura eating a big cookie  Requesting my dear sweet Lancer in Doutanuki Masakuni's battle clothing.

Requesting my king Revo.<br>Him with a Léon plush would be amazing, anything cute or cool is appreciated though.<br><br>If anyone want to arttrade I'll be up for it.</br></br></br>  <br>And with cookie you mean...</br>  <br>I tried. Sorry.</br>  <br>Every time I open it I think "ehhh" and then go do something else.</br>  <br/>  <br>Chocolate chip</br>  Can somebody draw Gakupo?

May God bless you.</br>  Good evening~<br>I missed the end of last weekend, but thank you so much Sharkbro for drawing my dear Hanako, I really love the line art, her pose, her smile, and shark outfit. It all looks wonderful.  You didn't draw her scars though.  I ended up coloring it myself.  And added little sharks on the sheets and if you ever want to color it yourself I'd like to see how it ends up. <br>Also thank you orz for adding my Hanako to that collage, all the waifus looks so cute in it and  especially Hanako  and the heart shape is a great touch.<br><br>As for this weekend, I would like to request my dear Hanako as Cure Scarlet doing mahou shoujo things, but anything else would be lovely as well.

Again. For the 5th time in a row. The god damned circle is driving all the drawfags away and they refuse to draw my waifu. I fucking hate the circle, I hate drawfags, I hate this shitty thread.  Requesting my dear husbando Kakyoin Noriaki! I'd love to see more of him wearing the fabulous rings and other accessories that were featured in last month's issue of Animage Magazine, something like these pictures http://i.imgur.com/6Run00f.jpg with him sitting on a throne while showing them off would be fantastic. You can even add a crown, since he's a Leo and it might fit with the whole picture. But anything of him as long as he looks happy or cool is perfectly fine. Thank you if you consider drawing him, have a great weekend everyone!<br><br><br> Ionbro, sorry it's not a delivery. but I wanted to thank you for the great colouring of 34's lineart you posted last week, sorry I wasn't around to thank you in time. Your colouring is stunning, even higanbana looks very pretty, the way you colour flowers is great. I love it, thank you so much for taking your time to colour them all, SPW and DIO look good too! Anyway, sorry once again and I hope he gets drawn! Ion wasn't my fav ToA but your husbando is a cute and he definitely didn't deserve all that suffering. Good luck! </br></br></br>  <br>Who is she? And would you accept I kinda shitty delivery?</br>  <br>Damn that's nice.</br>  <br>Why would "da circle" drive away drawfags?</br>  <br>What is this "circle"?</br>  <br><br>Don't respond people, it's a shitpost.</br></br>  <br>its not fucking fair</br>  <br> literally draw random waifus <br> still get blamed on the circle <br>whatever I hate you guys too.</br></br></br>  <br> The god damned circle is driving all the drawfags away <br>This, I had to stop being a drawfag because they shitposted me so much.<br>I'm only here to request my waifu now.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks! I had a lot of fun coloring his hair, I love that dusty pink/salmon color, I'm really glad you like it!<br> All the ToAs are so good, it's hard to pick a favorite, or a 2nd favorite in my case. Ion just needs more lines, but thanks! He definitely didn't. <br><br>And now for Rukako and Ryuuji. I'm naming the files now, since I'm starting to enter unknown character territory.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Only 5th week in a row <br>Some waifus have it harder you bitchboy.</br></br>  <br>How do you know it was them?</br>  <br> Adding feet to a drawing <br>I know what I'm requesting next week</br></br>  <br> I feel pretty <br> Oh so pretty <br> I feel pretty and witty and gay </br></br></br>  Tosh should really start giving out character designs to other mangaka. It's a shame for some of these to not be main characters of their own series.  <br> Alice showing her tits to Kurokiba like it's nothing <br><br>Good.</br></br></br>  <br>Megumi orgasming for no apparent reason.</br>  <br>Umis are the cutest.</br>  <br>that's the joke</br>  <br>he's locked on to them too, probably why Alice is frustrated that he's not paying attention to what she's saying</br>  Best cover story aside from From the Decks of the World.  <br>dude, that was what I was implying. And yeah kuma has the nikyunikyu, but he could show up again and die. I doubt oda would have a problem killing off kuma since he's already brain-dead and has been since the whitebeard war. it would just be destroying a robot</br>   implying Mononosuke isn't going to stowaway and be the new strawhat at the end of the Wano arc   <br>I honestly think Kuma can be reverted. I think Vegapunk might have some kind of way around it.</br>  <br>It was already foreshadowed that Franky would save Kuma when he thanked him for guarding the thousand sunny.</br>  <br>This is the best of all choices.<br> kid on board for more variety <br> interesting ability <br> ss doujins </br></br></br></br>  Chapter 51 chinascans: http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/374<wbr>271<br>Chapter 51 TLfag translation:  <br>Chapter 51 FA translation: http://famatg.com/2015/07/16/update<wbr>-my-hero-academia-chapter-51-eng/<br><br>FA is shit as always. <br>You know you're terrible when some random guy from 4chan does a better translation by himself than an entire team of dedicated translators.
