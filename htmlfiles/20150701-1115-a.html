I'm too lazy to look it up, but when asked about his family Killua referred to his four brothers even mentioning Alluka by name if I recall.</br>  <br>When talking to Morel on the airship Killua called Alluka otouto, what now?</br>  <br>She's very flexible</br>  <br> refers to her as a girl numerous times among family and servants, regardless of whether or not he's saying it to her face <br> uses a male-coded word exactly once to a complete stranger (to Alluka, that is) while he obviously wasn't in a position where it was appropriate to explain his family dynamics </br></br>  <br> doing these mental gymnastics just to stay in denial </br>  <br> mental gymnastics <br>You might want to get a brain scan, anon.</br></br>  <br> mfw all the doujins are loli </br>  <br>Killua could've called Alluka his little sister and Morel wouldn't have known any better, since he was, as you said, a stranger to Alluka.</br>  <br>The Zoldycks are famous.

It's not that hard. The x is put in there to make it look less retarded on paper.  <br>It's "gon" like in "gonads"</br>  <br> you can't real </br>  <br>gonads is more like 'goun' it's more like the english word 'goal' except with N instead of L</br>  Why argue about the gender of a fictional species? Rule 63 is a thing. Only absolute retards care about the answer. You aren't going to logic me into being gay.  <br>That's what I meant?</br>  <br>nobody was talking about your shitty waifu</br>  <br>since when was alluka a fictional species? Unless you're talking about nanika. I'd doubt that gas blobs even have gender.</br>  <br>nah<br>gon as in gonads doesn't sound like Gon's name.</br></br>  <br>Pitou is a she<br>Kurapika is a she<br>Kalluto is a she<br>Alluka is a he</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shitposters are in full force today, I see.</br>  <br> Kurapika is a she <br> Kalluto is a she <br>for the love of christ stop being retarded</br></br></br>  <br>ゴン (gōn)<br>Another comparative word would be goal as you've said, as well as goad, gore or gopher.</br></br>  <br> Pitou is a they <br> Kurapika is a he <br> Kalluto is a he <br> Alluka is a she <br>ftfy</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but in the english word gonads go is pronounced like japanese gou (ごう/ゴー) not go (ご/ゴ)</br>  <br> Alluka is a she <br>No</br></br>  <br>fuck off illumi</br>  <br>underage pls go</br>  <br>You're right in a strict sense but English is flexible. Japanese is not. Gonads is more or less the same way to pronounce the Go, unlike Gone.</br>  <br/>    <br>Pitou is an ant<br>Kurapika is male<br>Kalluto is male<br>Alluka is  a shit </br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess you have a point there. In the american accent we replace like half our vowels with 'uh' anyway</br>  <br><br>Is it so hard to accept the truth?</br></br>  <br>The truth is that Alluka is Killua's little sister.</br>  <br>for you? apparently</br>  <br> I wish I had friends <br>True that</br></br>  <br>Yes and accents are also highly variable, people like to speed up or distort the vocabulary as generations pass.</br>  <br>Wait people are actually butthurt about that?</br>  <br> Pitou is an ant <br>Pitou was human.<br> Alluka is a shit <br>How?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You should have seen hxh threads a few months ago. Gon was the most hated character and pitou was fucking loved. It was disgusting.</br>  <br>Alluka, just like all of Killua's siblings, is male. This has been explicitely stated. <br><br>I'm genuinely curious about why you insist on staying in denial this much. Is Alluka your waifu? If not, what reason do you have to lie to yourself?</br></br></br>  <br> gon and killua will never raise alluka as their daughteru </br>  <br> raising a boy as their daughter <br>Why would they do that?</br></br>  Hanta n Hanta  <br> why would they raise a girl as a girl <br>Gee I wonder</br></br>  <br>Alluka has a wiener but Killua says she's his sister, and Killua loves and cares for her the most out of anybody. So she's a girl.<br>You're supposed to accept this, because everyone who consistently calls Alluka a male are either antagonists or haven't been portrayed as good people.</br></br>  <br>But now they are an ant. That's like saying ant Kite's male because human Kite was male.</br>  <br>But they don't know any girls they could raise as their daughter. All the girls they know are older than them. All they have is Killua's little brother, Alluka.<br><br>Killua calling Alluka a girl doesn't make him one. Why would you say such silly things?</br></br></br>  hunta hunta. Also<br> having friends </br>  <br>Nice reading comprehension, anon. Was, as in, before Pitou died. Gon considered Pitou as human.</br>  <br>What are you even arguing about? No one made a correlation between Pitou's gender and her species.</br>  <br> Killua calling Alluka a girl doesn't make him one. <br><br>oh you</br></br></br>  <br> shitposting </br>  <br>Does it? I didn't know Killua had that kind of ability.<br><br>Good rebuttal anon.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I am obviously retarded. Leave me be.</br></br>  <br>Shota x Shota</br>      Would you a Bisky /a/?   In either form    <br>Disgusting<br><br>Yes</br></br></br>  <br> In either form <br>Yes</br></br>  Discuss Togashi's bad art here.<br><br>Togashi did nothing wrong.</br></br>    <br>these threads escalate too quickly</br>  <br>togashi is my waifu<br>I'm gonna pound that sweet bp</br></br>  <br> Togashi <br> bad art <br>Just look at that turkey</br></br></br>  <br>Discuss Togashi's qt art here.</br>  <br>These things happen when you have such crazy deadlines.</br>  <br>H O L D I N G H A N D S<br>O<br>L<br>D<br>I<br>N<br>G<br><br>H<br>A<br>N<br>D<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>at least he seems gon-like in this one<br><br>not demure</br></br></br>  <br>Considering there is a Gon dress up game where he does cross dress, putting Gon in a dress isn't as strange as one might think.</br>  <br> you will never hold hands with   Gon </br>  <br>Just awful, Gon is drawn like a girl. Killua not like</br>  <br>It looks like it was taken from a stock photo then turned to monochrome for printing.</br>  <br>That was for a gag, wasn't it? There was even a Tanuki costume.</br>  <br>According to the author, it's Hunter Hunter. I still say Hunter x Hunter because I'm retarded.</br>  <br> implying gon isn't the waifu </br>  <br>Seriously, how can anyone be expected to work under such harsh conditions?</br>  <br>It was a part of the extra for the manga. They even put him in one of the outfits for an ad for HxH Treasure.</br>  <br>I figured it was Hunter Cross Hunter, like Digimon Xros Wars.</br>  <br>To be fair, despite what 2011 wants people to believe Killua is the more boyish between the two of them. But with Gon the only thing keeping him looking like a boy is his hair.</br>  <br>Why hasn't Gon casually worn girl clothes in the manga yet?</br>  <br>He's the househusband. But he does not have girly proportions like in that picture.</br>    <br>Being a self-centered drama queen is very feminine. Killua is a self-centered drama queen.</br>  <br>Crossdressing is cute, but in togashi's depictions of Gon in drag still have him looking like a boy.</br>  <br>Because Shuiesha.</br>  <br>In his head. Killua keeps his feeling bottled up, which is a masculine thing to do. He's also not very affectionate or friendly and doesn't take other people's feelings into consideration, also masculine.</br>  <br>Because he kept his hairstyle the minute you Gon long hair though he doesn't look like a boy.</br>  <br>Because that dress up game isn't part of the story.<br><br>You could say that about Gon as well.</br></br></br>  <br><br>These have been posted by the same guy in every HxH thread I've seen.<br>Someone is obsessed.<br><br>And of course despite the fact that the art was always fixed in the volume releasese since over 10 years ago.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what I thought too. it may take a while for me to start saying Hunter Hunter. I just assumed it was like Project X Zone, where you say cross.</br>    <br>Actually Gon is characterized by being honest with himself and his feelings. He has never held his own thoughts or feelings back even at the worst times.</br>  looks like a fucking boy to me  <br>I know anon, no need to be so much on the defensive. It's a joke. <br>Togashi's art usually ranges from very decent to good.</br></br>    <br>Photoshop long hair on him and we'll see if you keep that opinion.</br>  <br>I love it when Togashi does panels like this. Telling a story without words.<br><br>I really hope he does it more often when the exposition nonsense is over.</br></br></br>      <br> Implying it is only good when he draws detailed background fluff. <br><br>Get your eyes checked.</br></br></br>  <br>Pic related. Also keep in mind that Killua is the only one to have opened up to someone else. Gon had an emotional breakdown when he was alone.</br>    Old thread is almost dead  I want to be a second year.  <br> the cute feet </br>    <br>First years for life.

I have to warn you, it may cause some anons to have feelings of nausea and/or terror.</br></br></br>  <br>You fucking piece of shit eating monkey raping ass jamming dragon dildo</br>  I haven't enjoyed a cute girls doing cute things with yuri undertones so much since K-On  <br> spoiler  <br>Hell isn't enough for the likes of you.</br></br>  <br>Twice the best girl</br>  <br>The first one was actually pretty reasonable.  But as long as there is a thread I feel almost obliged to post in it. </br>  How exactly does this uniform even work? Is it a huge skirt with sleeves? What's up with the weird shirt with only one button? This is probably the weirdest uniform in anime.  <br>China x Akari, who actually ends up making the first move?  Also, tl? </br>  Bit late to the party, but I just finished Nachuyachumi. It was so amazing. An hour flew by without me even knowing. Even cried a little towards the end.<br><br>Some of the dialogue was incredible. I really liked the scene where Kyouko nagged Chinatsu to buy snacks. Made me all warm and fuzzy inside.</br></br>  <br> Is it a huge skirt with sleeves? <br>pretty much, it's not that weird really</br></br>  <br>pretty much, don't know about everyone one else but i like it</br>  <br> only one button <br>infrequent reminder that it would be easy to quickly undress the yurus.</br></br>  <br>It's just 2 pieces. I could see it working as an actual uniform if the dress was a proper length. Its far from the weirdest uniform in anime.</br>  <br><br>I did warn you.<br>It is just too real for words. It took me years to get over that terror, I hope you can recover soon and that it does not affect you as much as it did I.<br><br>Here is a totally real, not terribly done in MS-Paint, picture of a young girl discovering the beauty of yuri and her own sister's homosexuality. Words cannot describe how wonderful it is that this girl has found others like herself, and that she is not alone with her sexual identity.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I couldnt get past the second page fuck this</br>  <br>why?</br>    <br> I hope that's just water on the tomato </br>  <br> not showing how to put it on from the very beginning </br>  <br>Are the longer sleeves an option?   help  </br>  <br>I think the longer sleeves is the winter version, and the shorter one is for summer</br>  <br>The longer sleeves are their winter uniform.<br>The joke pictured relies on that, they go from their summer to winter uniforms as she changes the calender.</br></br>  <br><br>Ahh, I see. Thanks.</br></br>  <br> two best girls in one image </br>  <br>Silly anon, you replied to the wrong picture.

Thanks for your concern though!</br>  <br> tfw didn't know what that thing was until your post <br>That's  lewd. </br></br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  <br>Yeah I'm a big fan of Akari and Chitose too!</br>  <br>winter uniform a best<br>mainly because it looks cuter and this</br></br>  <br>I find your innocence as endearing as I do appealing.</br>  <br>Why would someone remove the best girl from that picture?</br>  <br> best <br>probably because ayano looks cuter alone</br></br>  <br> ayano looks cuter alone <br>Wh-what are you saying?</br></br>  Why is Nadeshiko's jumper/vest a different colour than her friends? Is it just that her school is not that strict on uniform.<br><br>Or is Nadeshiko a special student.  Nadeshiko is dating the teacher </br></br>  What if  Ayano wears the same pantsu as Kyouko and Akari?   <br>maybe some schools have a slightly looser dress code and they allow you to choose from a selection of vests</br>  <br>the namori ones?<br>nah</br></br>  <br>It's because she's the queen dyke, hence why everyone wants to be her gf</br>  Leaked S3 PV:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nSj<wbr>oVGve8Ro</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  i just realised how good looking their uniforms actually are compared to other shows<br>yuru yuri as a whole has so much to offer that other anime's don't</br>  <br>Chitose looks exactly as you imagine she'd look in real life.</br>  <br>this is why we need to exterminate 3DPD</br>  <br>wut</br>  <br><br> implying you need to even touch that button <br><br>the skirt literally reaches the breasts so you can lift everything up there and roll it in one direction in 2 moves and BAM rape</br></br></br></br>  <br>it's not rape if it's just practice</br>  <br> rape <br>what the fuck is wrong with you? we're only undressing them to help them get into their pajamas.</br></br>  <br>I want to erase my memory of this horror.</br>  <br>Don't forget the amount of different clothing the yurus wear, while not in school.<br><br>And the fact that all the girls are lesbians. As in they actually fancy other girls.  Also the lack of men, it isn't because they live in a world without men. Here is a picture with Akari's dad. But rather to illustrate that they have no interest in men, that they don't care for them or are attracted to them. Hence why they are usually never shown in full. Because the yurus just don't care. They are too busy focusing on the things they are sexually attracted to. Like for Sakurako, breasts. </br></br></br>  im rewatching yuru yuri for the first time now and i love seeing all of the subtle appearances of rise that i missed the first time around.  <br>Honestly, I think they nailed how Kyouko would look in real life.<br><br>Like a child molester.</br></br></br>      <br>she sure got some good taste in children though</br>  <br>Did Yui's foot fall into a trash compactor or something<br><br>And she's only got 4 toes</br></br></br>  <br>are you thinking about the part where ayano tries to cheer up yui?<br>nah i don't think so</br></br>  <br>too much skipping</br>  <br>This is not okay</br>  <br>even less presence that this red haired girl</br>    What's the point of these daily generals? We're discussing literally the same shit we discussed 2 days ago. At least when the anime comes out we have new shit to talk about.  <br><br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rHo<wbr>pdUdGAXg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can just ignore the thread. Picture related.<br><br>I really love how Rise was totally at the beach with them. But I didn't notice her at all when I initially watched the beach episode.</br></br></br>  <br>This is ace, needs subs though</br>  don't die on me just yet  <br> and filters </br>    <br> not liking a blurry mess </br>    just a reminder  <br>Someone needs to be shot.</br>    <br>I chortled.</br>    <br><br>I found tons of shit on my first rewatch. Literally within the first few seconds of the first episode I noticed something new: Akari's Namori alarm clock.</br></br>  <br>Also another bit with Rise that a lot of people probably missed since so many skipped the credits.</br>  <br>The more subtle references to the time loop took me a few times to catch.</br>  I found Saku's car.  <br>That looks fun to drive.</br>  <br>Because it is.</br>    <br>two best pairings</br>  <br>Is it weird to enjoy this series without even caring about pairings/shipping or whatever you call it?</br>  <br>The actual yuri content is kept deliberately light as the focus is more on comedy, so I guess not</br>  <br>No, but a lot of fun can be had in seeing what kind of subtext/shiptease stuff Namori will throw out next.</br>  <br>Yes, they're very clear and a big part of the story</br>  Keep this thread alive! For the Yuru's!~  <br>it would help if you didn't post random gifs of steam appearing out of nowhere</br>  <br>Buttons breaking would be a nightmare.</br>  <br>Where are those images coming from?</br>  <br>I just hope Himawari is good at sewing</br>  Love this fucking show :3<br><br> Yuri dominance rape when? </br></br>      <br>That would be the oppai-monsters only talent.</br>  OK, time to settle this once and for all.

All other assassins (Say Judas or Brutus) only killed one person, and modern ones just aren't interesting. The only other one I could think of was Zodiac, but I already have Houdini for the "American" variety.</br>  <br>Hannibal Lecter?</br>    <br>John Wilkes Booth?<br>Lee Harvey Oswald?</br></br>  NisiO Grail War<br><br>Ruler: Medaka <br><br>Saber: Any Yasuri or Deviant Blade user or Kokorowatari user. <br>Lancer: Udou Bukiko<br>Archer: Emonzaemon<br>Rider: Yozuru Kagenui with her trusty steed Yotsugi. <br>Berserker: Iihiko Shishime<br>Caster: Anshin'in <br>Assassin: Kumagawa. <br><br>Lancer and Rider are bastards since only one person uses a spear and no-one is well-known for specifically using a vehicle of any form.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They are both only famous for killing one person, not really an exciting assassin in my book.<br><br><br>Thought about him but I wanted to stray away from "Completely fictitious" and more mythological.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Harold Shipman?<br><br>I judge assassins based on the way they killed not so much the number they killed.<br><br>Then again, both JWB and LHO got found out. Not exactly legendary.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How about Mary Ann Cotton?</br>  <br>Yeah that too. What marks a legendary assassin is if they killed a lot, and were not caught. Jack the Ripper and Zodiac are in my opinion two best options for western assassins.</br>  <br> Kumagawa not lancer <br><br>come on he literally fits lancer to a T.</br></br></br>  <br>what about Zodaic Killer? He's got the same kill count as Jack.<br>or any other serial killers for that matter<br><br>10/10 lol'ed</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty damn good. Especially your selection for lancer /suffering </br>  <br>got a template?</br>  <br>I did consider his E minus minus luck and Bookmaker but in the end I figured that being in the class that is irrelevant and no-one likes even in-universe fits him best. <br><br>Obviously Kumagawa can multi-class like Anshin'in or Freshmaker</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I was thinking of Zodiac as well. It was tough to pick between Jack or him, but I really wanted Houdini as the caster, so I didn't want to add another American servant. But yeah, I would probably prefer Zodiac over Jack since Jack is kinda already done.</br>  <br>Nah I don't I made this years ago.

They did so on purpose? or technological problems?<br>I'm curious how the story changes if they are long life or immortal.</br>  <br><br><br>I couldn't get past the first episode. It was labeled sci-fi but I don't think the writers even finished school yet.</br></br></br>  <br>Because they want you to keep buying giftias. Look up planned obsolescence. <br><br>This is why we need an open-source alternative to giftias.</br></br></br>  <br> long life <br>Story doesn't exist because the conflict is gone<br><br> immortal <br>Story takes place over a lot longer timespan and ends with Tsukasa being kill. This has already been done like a million times in other stories.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was technological limitations. Did you even watch it?</br>  <br> This has already been done like a million times in other stories. <br><br>In literature? Sure, but what hasn't?. In anime? u wot m8</br></br></br>   There's already a artist making a NTR doujin <br>Stop, she's already dead.</br>   Wafiu's never die, can't wash this hotglue from your hands, let the world feelllllll   <br>Whos the autist that took the time to make this?</br>  <br>I don't get it. That was a compliment.</br>  <br>Somehow, it does look familiar enough during airing time.</br>  <br>Why do you type like an idiot?</br>  <br>He is being reminded that this is the end for isla. and their relationship.</br>  I cry a lot when reading, but this is the first anime that made me cry.<br><br>Are there any other like this? Most other animes ive seen that try to be sad end up making the MC, or the love interest, look pathetic.</br></br>  <br> reminded <br>More like he finally realizes it, and it could have happened at any time.</br></br>  <br>try anohana or angel beats. what manga makes you cry? i never found one that even made me tear up a little.</br>  <br>I remember reading at least one that made me cry, but i cant remember them anymore. Il have a loot at my manga and see if I find one.<br>Western books are what makes me cry usually.</br></br>  I do not know why you liked this<br>It failed as a SoL, It failed as a drama, It failed as a sci-fi. The characters were very generic. Only good thing that came out of it was the ending since i was honestly expecting some asspull where isla would survive.</br>  <br>Show was really bland and unappealing, the ending was solid though</br>  <br> Only good thing that came out of it was the ending <br>This is the format a story should be, not useless SoL filler, or focusing on the sci-fi details, it should have a little bit of meat to keep it going but build up to the final as the main point. <br><br>This seems to be extremely rare in manga/anime since they always just leave the ending out, or rush it in some way. Japanese people suck at endings. They never plan for it, either they keep it open to make a season 2, or they just keep fucking about till it gets axed and they need to rush it.<br><br>Name one other anime this season that had a good ending.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Name one other anime this season that had a good ending. <br>Easy, Houkago no Pleiades.</br></br>  <br>Danmachi</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>Good ending, while Gary Stu as fuck it fist the context of the show</br>  <br>Find peace, Snake.</br>  <br>You picked the wrong season to ask that.<br><br>Otherwise I agree, Japanese writers don't place enough emphasis on endings and tend to either force their idea of a good ending into the story even when it doesn't fit, or just slapdash rush the ending because they can't pace things right.<br><br>Pleiades and PlaMemo both gave plenty of time for their endings to develop naturally and didn't attempt any stupid asspulls either. With that in mind. this was a surprisingly great season for original anime ending-wise.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him but have you tried Ikigami?</br>  <br>We need Isla holding the cup.</br>  <br>Ai-Ren is pretty similar to this show.</br>  <br>Too lazy to browse episodes for screenshot material.<br><br>Here's the mug: https://d.maxfile.ro/tuqehfkvba.png<wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Covered up that shit eating grin </br>  <br>Matched the color of her hand</br>  <br>i want to f orget  isla</br>  <br><br><br>Isn't she 9 years old ?</br></br></br>  <br> shit eating grin <br><br>You say that to my face you asshat ;_;</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you<br><br>I dont often mean it when I say this, but I do this time.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe you have been asleep for 13 episodes but that's as old as they can get.</br>  https://gifsound.com/?webm=i.4cdn.o<wbr>rg/a/1435477324342&amp;v=EU_Y-uIyq14&amp;s=<wbr>13<br><br>And here come the bitch tears again. Been along time since I felt so shit after finishing a show.</br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br> shit <br>I always feel great after a good sad cry</br></br>  So who else has ordered the Isla Memorial magazine?  <br>Good to see people are morning for her.</br>  <br>Fuck, forgot pic</br>  <br> morning <br>Morning Rescue?</br></br>  <br>Can't dodge the rodge</br>  Even with "technological limitations" the premise was still ridiculous. There's no way technology like that would be greenlit in our world for mass production. There are a lot of ethical concerns, and not just because of robots- actually having ownership over another human being is more or less taboo in most societies now.<br><br>The weird behavior of every character in the show around the giftias was uncanny as fuck too, and it turned me off constantly. Non-fictional people would behave much differently (be extremely fucking uncomfortable) than the people in the show did to owning a sentient artificial human with a limited lifespan. <br><br>In the end it's just another anime with shitty worldbuilding that was designed too awkwardly to fit the premise, rather than the other way around, which led to a lot of illogical results. <br><br>The saving grace is they didn't give a fuck, so the drama turned out ok because they didn't make it worse by trying to fix things.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just a romance with one character dying of cancer.<br>If you really want a show about androids and ethics, go watch that UK slut empowerment TV show.</br></br>  no asspulls<br> arc with fake collector stealing a giftia literally about to break down and go berserk <br> shota owner had NO ONE assigned to sit there and watch him so he somehow is able to follow them (does little boy have a car?) <br> the bad guy even needing to STEAL a giftia in the first place when the corporation which produces them very likely has extremely loose morals when it comes to sexbots considering all giftias are FULLY functional <br> the corporation has a Psycho-Pass Disintegrator weapon which ONLY damages giftia electronics, but instead the PMC hired to hunt it down hunt it with assault rifles because collateral damage is fucking awesome <br><br>nigga just wanted a free sexbot with the chance of murdering him violently, i guess.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> complain the world isnt built up enough <br> complain the world isnt close enough to our own <br>make up your damn mind.</br></br></br>  <br>It didn't go as we wished, but as we foreseen, all thanks to the shitty early story setting<br>I also prefer this ending, knowing that with even proper and suitable setting it might not messing with our feelings that hard</br></br>  <br>This<br>Also already forgot that it's sci-fi while considering it to be pure sol and rom com(until recently)</br></br>  <br> no way technology like that would be greenlit <br> ethical concerns <br> having ownership over another human being is more or less taboo <br> Non-fictional people would behave much differently (be extremely fucking uncomfortable) <br>what the hell are you talking about?<br><br>Theres a reason its called fiction. <br><br>This sounds like someone watching a show about magic and complaining that the people are using magic (which is obviously not realistic). <br><br>People like you are why there is never anything original in entertainment. because you guys just want the same old shit retold a hundred times.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Dropped after one or two episodes because I felt this was exactly where it was going and was in no mood for all the forced drama it would've obviously used <br> Months later series ends as predictable as expected but for some reason most threads were about crying and weeping over a robot that was obviously dead from the first episode <br><br>Really, help me understand how something as obvious as this ending can be so highly thought of around here?</br></br></br>  <br>A story isn't just a beginning and ending, you know.<br>We had 13 episodes to grow attached to her.</br></br>  <br><br>It's not an ending though, except of that story arc. It's literally a beginning where Bell is presented as the last Hero of Zeus Familia who will make a triumphant return to fix something or another with the dungeon. The important parts of the story haven't even really happened yet.</br></br>  <br> as obvious as this ending can be  <br><br>So what? In the beginning she doesn't care about dying and as the Series goes on she starts to enjoy her live so of course it's sad to see her go in the end.</br></br></br>  <br>It must suck watching /reading anything if all you care about are plot twists</br>  <br> forced <br>I love how forced is the new buzzword on /a/. People are using it even more incorrectly than they did edgy</br></br>  <br><br><br>That's exactly my point, it was obvious she'd die at the end with rivers of tears from all sides. Really didn't feel like going through that. Especially since the circumstances felt pretty damn cheap. They had the bloody technology to build androids yet for some reason couldn't stick a few more hard drive slots in there. There are plenty of other examples, but the first thing that comes to mind is Yumemi. She lived for what a hundred, two hundred years? And her memory unit could fit in a cigarette holder. Any other way to break her and I might have considered the show, but a memory limit sounds bloody ridonkulous.</br></br></br>  this show will be completely forgotten about come next season  <br>I will never forget her.</br>  <br>I still feel it,and atleast she's happy</br>  <br>fuck off Kaz</br>  <br>*was happy<br>FIFY bra.</br></br>  Who wanted an asspull ending? I did. I wanted Isla to live. Now she's gone forever. :(  <br><br>Me too. Fuck this death acceptance thing, in a fucking SF show even.<br><br>Meat waifu dying? Cryonics and research to cure her. Robot waifu dying? Suspend functions and research to fix her.<br><br>That's love, that's overcoming adversity.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I did, in a way. It would have been cheap but I'd have been smiling, and she deserved it.</br>  <br> she's happy <br>She's dead, Jim</br></br>  <br> research <br>None of the characters are scientists, and none of them are rich either. The most they can afford to do is basic maintenance and observing physical ability.</br></br>  <br>She will live on as long as you keep her in your memories ;_;<br><br>I actually have trouble sleeping if I think about the last few episodes before going to bed. My Faggot levels are off the charts these last few days.</br></br></br>  <br> Can afford an android <br> Can't afford a second hard drive <br><br>Full plebs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what retards say about every show, anon. Don't be a retard.<br><br>I remember everything. I even remember Nobunagun!</br></br></br>  It should've ended with Tsukasa going full mado scientisto, creating/reviving Isla whatever it takes and have revenge to the world  <br> Forgetting Nobunagun <br><br>Heresy!</br></br></br>  <br>I remember everything I've watched past seasons after reading their title on my watched list.</br>  <br>I finished it before going to bed last night.<br><br>How do I make this pain stop?</br></br></br>  <br>That show was fun. <br>Nobunagun OST &gt; Noragami OST</br></br>  <br>I'll always remember fondly that beautiful ending  and the tentacle rape. </br>  <br> How do I make this pain stop? <br>Just give it time. If you really loved her then you'll stop missing her so badly after around 10 years or so.</br></br>  <br>Buy everything Show related and hope for S2.</br>  <br> and hope for S2 <br>You know in your heart that there will never be a S2 because S1 was beautiful, sad and perfect  as long as you ignore all the shit episodes. </br></br>  <br><br>They can always do a sequel in novel format since they already announced that it`s getting a novelization.</br></br>  <br>Must ne a clogged artery anon you should check that out</br>  <br>Sry.

I get where he comes from; superficiality, putting on masks, deceiving others can be bad but I feel as if he is taking it to the extreme. <br><br>Vol 11 has me lessed hyped for the series. Yui was awesome but Yukinoshita's moeblob dependency is not what I was expecting. And Hachiman is starting to fucking annoy me. Just man up, figure out your feelings, and reject girl(s). You want things to be genuine? Then why not look at the root of the issue (yourself) because how do you expect a dependant moeblob and a girl who has tried her hardest to win over your affections to do so<br><br>You're a fucking hypocrite. You want girls to be genuine but you arent even fucking genuine with yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was never confirmed she actually had a crush, was it?<br><br><br>At no point was anything said about it being in the third year.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The club disbands after the competition is over, they sort of allude to this making the requests from the club members as the final ones.<br><br>Komachi enters Sobu high next year so she'll probably join the club after the previous members quit.</br></br></br>  <br>Feels good to be on this ship.</br>  <br>sexual</br>  <br>There's a difference between not being honest with your feelings and not understanding them yourself. So this part?<br> Just man up, figure out your feelings, and reject girl(s) <br>Kinda what's up next on the menu along with supporting Yukino in figuring out her shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Why reply if you have no argument?<br><br><br>That's the "crush" part.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He already knows his idea of genuine is hypocritical, he wants to understand but not to be understood.</br>  <br>Vol 10.5, Club's photo, Iroha do her best for tsundere 8man</br>  <br><br>I wouldn't say he's taking genuine too far, but unfortunately outside of vague hints for all the girls the author won't give Hachiman a definitive preference because that'd cause a shitstorm and make lots of people not buy the next volume.</br></br>  <br>It's not that he took it to far, it's that he never took it far enough.<br><br>Also 8man can't reject them if they won't even make their feelings clear to him, though doing things like organizing the chocolate event certainly didn't help in that respect.</br></br></br>  <br>Glad it was mutual then.</br>  <br>It's not though, 8man's non-genuine.</br>  Late but<br> care to pastebin your stylish?</br>  School Rumble S3 when  <br>After S&amp;W 3 of course.</br>   You either die a loner, or you live long enough to see yourself become a nice guy.   <br>Just ignore the troll, brother. It's enough that we understand the depth of Yui's love for 8man.</br>  <br> Yuigahama dropped her shoulders with a sullen look. She then briskly walked ahead and voiced her complaints. “There you go again with that stuff… Can’t you read the mood?” <br><br> “Mood, huh…?” <br><br> Like what kind of mood? <br><br> For example, the mood on Valentine’s Day? <br><br> I suppose I could understand in that case. Occasionally, I’d learn from the masses, take in the mood, and play it off. Then, I’d just brush it all off with a simple “it’s what everyone’s doing.” Doing that made you want to have expectations, be spoiled, lose yourself, and wait. <br><br> But I don’t think that’s something you should do. <br><br> It’d be insincere if all you did was wait. Regardless of the answer and conclusion awaiting you at the end of the tunnel, you should make sure to take that step forward without deception and incredulity and leave the regrets for afterwards. <br><br> That’s why, I took in the mood and decided to ask now. <br><br> “By the way…” <br><br> I squeezed out those words with a hoarse voice and Yuigahama turned around. Her inclined head and her eyes urged me to go on. Seeing her straight-on was somewhat dazzling that I slightly averted my face. <br><br> “…Do you have a day you’re free on soon?” <br><br>So here we have it. Putting Yui aside, was the 8  genuine  or just following the mood?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll do it when I get back home in about 4 hours.</br>  Would accept an 8man confession? Would Yukino?  <br>he was genuinely going with the mood.</br>  <br> The club photo will appear as the last page of the final volume. <br>My tears are not ready</br></br>  <br>*Would Yui</br>  <br>Fucking Watari man, Yui can't get a break.<br>That's so sad for her.</br></br>  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br> Iroha <br> tits <br><br>NOT GENUINE</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll be waiting patiently, anon.</br>  <br>"thanks but I have someone else I like"<br> yumiko suddenly walks in and hugs 8man's arm <br>"goodbye"<br> they walk away as yui/yukino stare with her jaw dropped </br></br></br></br>  Who Anyone but Yuckynoshita  <br>いろはす～</br>  <br><br>Yui wouldn't give him time to finish his sentence before she tackles him to the ground and crushes his ribs between the floor and her tits..<br><br>Yukino would be flustered but give him what sounds like a snarky pseudo-rejection before calling him a "stupid hachiman" and accepting.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yui <br>Heart shaped pupils and deep kissing him in seconds<br><br> Yukino <br>Light teasing and a definite yes. <br><br> Iroha <br>Sorry, there is someone I like yada yada</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Where is our god and savior Spyro?    <br>We know how it will end.</br>    So was this moment when Hachiman implicitly answered Yukino's request to "help me someday?"  <br> I suppose I could understand in that case. Occasionally, I’d learn from the masses, take in the mood, and play it off. Then, I’d just brush it all off with a simple “it’s what everyone’s doing.” Doing that made you want to have expectations, be spoiled, lose yourself, and wait. <br><br> But I don’t think that’s something you should do. <br><br> It’d be insincere if all you did was wait. Regardless of the answer and conclusion awaiting you at the end of the tunnel, you should make sure to take that step forward without deception and incredulity and leave the regrets for afterwards. <br><br> That’s why, I took in the mood and decided to ask now. <br><br>Be my guest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Does Iroha realize Y+Y are a threat and that she should lay low so they don't suspect something?  <br> Sorry there's someone I like <br>Nice meme</br></br>  <br> "Help me someday" <br>That wasn't a request that was her asking him  as a friend. <br><br>Her true request comes next volume.</br></br></br></br>  <br>According to my dick, she's on par with that smug-looking girl from Hyouka.</br>  <br>No. She formally requested help at the end.</br>  <br><br>I didn't mean request in the formal service club sense of the word.</br></br>    <br>Obviously.<br><br>She even subtly said that it botters her that she has to compete with Yui and Yukino.</br></br></br>  <br>That EH was cute as fuck though.</br>  <br>Yes, that's why she tells Hikki to keep the chocolates a secret, she doesn't want to get involved with the club.</br>  <br>Yes. She lowers 8man's AT field with StuCo work and bypasses YY by increasing her sly levels when they're not around. She wants genuine love, but she does not care about fooling YY. No reason to GENUINE them.</br>  <br>The Service Club disbandment is inevitable and doesn't mean an Iroha victory. <br><br>The Service Club disbandment can convey: Hachiman, Yukino, and Yui camaraderie can survive.<br><br>For a while, I think that was an issue, rather their relationship is united by the fact they are in the Service Club and are "friends" or does their relationship go beyond being members that they can regard the other as friends.<br><br>Moreover, with the final request, it is Watari message of saying "Oregairu is concluding" remember the final request is two requests: Yukino's and Hachiman's, it is like an omnibus request, so volume twelve may deal with Yukino's request and volume thirteen conclude perfectly with Hachiman's request and him finding something genuine with either Yukino or Yui (Iroha being the third option). <br><br>Indeed. Thirteen volumes is perfect to conclude Oregairu. Alternatively, volume twelve is the final volume, Watari can always have Hachiman's plus Yukino's request coincide the other.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The densest object in the universe </br>  <br>She's too genuine for that kind of thing.</br>  <br> I want your 8 but don't you dare pull me in your club's dramafest </br>  <br><br>Irohasu~</br></br>  <br>Why do people ask oddly specific questions such as these?</br>  <br>c, b/d, b, a<br><br>Unsure about Yukino because even though she obviously cares deeply about 8man, and even though she obviously has some degree of romantic attraction towards him, it's still pretty hard to tell where the platonic feelings end and the romantic feelings start.

You could make that argument with literally any stand other than Star Platinum but since SP is just a dude and damage to stands reflect damage to the users Kenshiro could totally fuck up Jotaro. Unless he just stops time.</br></br>   even if we get a part 4 anime it will never be this good looking   <br>Kenshiro couldn't even see or damage SP. it's a stand. He'd have to get in and hit Jotaro.</br>  <br>I just want them to keep pulling of shit like Part 3's opening.

Stands can be hurt by ordinary shit.</br>  <br>That kinda style works for a commercial but it'd be really annoying for a full fledged anime. Shit would look like a slightly higher quality Ninja Slayer/Inferno Cop</br>  <br>I really don't see what people like so much about the OVA. Granted I watched it after I watched the anime just so I could compare. I will admit that the anime does have a few aggregious QUALITY shots but overall, I think it's vastly superior.</br>  <br>It depends which Jotaro we're talking about, because Araki has changed the stand rules many, many times, but according to the list he initially laid out for part 3, stands can only be damaged by stands.</br>  <br> Stands can only be damaged by stands. <br>Has that rule been broken yet?</br></br>  <br> ASB&gt;anime&gt;araki&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ova <br>great animation doesn justify this ugly artstyle even for the anime fair share of QUALITY<br><br>the artstyle was great but the animation was meh</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think people like the OVA, ( well I do ) because it takes artistic liberties to improve the pacing and does stuff from a different angle, and I like the changes. You can't tell me the extra clases Jotaro and Dio do in the final episode isn't great, the train thing is fantastic.</br>  Can someone repost that thing describing JoJo parts? I remember that part 8's description was "Araki shows all of his fetishes" or something  <br>what turtle in part 8?</br>  <br><br>this right?<br/></br></br>  <br>I can't make out the moonrunes of what Zeppli says<br><br>Kore ga unmeinara aru ka mamauke</br></br></br>  <br>The 2000 OVA took the character designs of the 1993 OVA and somehow made them worse. Jotaro looks like a low rate Kenshiro here.</br>  <br>Yes, thanks Doc.</br>  <br> the artstyle was great but the animation was meh <br>That's why I compared it to Inferno Cop/Ninja Slayer</br></br>  <br>oh wait, found it<br><br>The best Jojo quote<br>これが運命ならあるかまま受け入れう</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's kind of amazing that ASB manages to look better than the manga while also looking exactly like the manga.</br>  <br>Basically this <br>I'll take Dio vs Jotaro over the 2015 version. Not that the latter's bad by any means</br></br>    <br>Zeppelli ;_;</br>  <br>i meant to say that i agree with you.sorry if i didnt stated it.<br><br>thats because its always on model and most of the ''there to be there'' type of lines that araki draw on his character bodies and faces were either removed or switched to shading which make the artstyle more easy to the eyes.</br></br></br>    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=TPX<wbr>BiWC5dDw</wbr>  [ ]  <br> tfw johnny look like a pink haired and big titted girl i was messing with at school <br>head game was viscious</br></br>    I have no more [D O U B T S]  <br>I thought that was Kakyoin's torso</br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/YGj8QB_Q0yM?t=21s  [ ]</br>  <br>Only stands can beat stands. Body vs body though? Jonathan would be a better competitor and he'd still lose.</br>    <br>Jotaro kind of is a low rate Kenshiro.<br><br>Also Junichi Hayama has a massive HnK boner/old manly manga boner. He's still a really good artist though.</br></br></br>  <br>It's probably all a bit mixed in there</br>  Hypothetical question here: If a two humanoid stands were fighting one another and one managed to break the others leg, then the stand users leg would also break, right? Does this mean the Stands leg will also be broken, or would it still be able to use it?  <br>Nah, that would be Jonathan. Jotaro only has that stoic feeling from him.</br>  <br>Also this is the most masculine Giorno will ever look.</br>  <br>Can you post the pic by the OVA character designer that has Avdol lighting up Jotaro's cigarette?</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wJJ<wbr>VMyV-odU</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Polnareff lost all function in his lower body sometime between Parts 3 and 5, but Silver Chariot's body was fully functioning upright and even attacked Diavolo. <br><br>I don't know how effective it is, but the Stand still operates.</br></br></br>  <br>I disagree, Jonathan only looks like Kenshiro. His personality is completely different. Whereas Jotaro acts like and still looks a tiny bit like him. He has Ken's stoic attitude and lack of mercy for opponents. <br><br><br>You mean this?</br></br></br></br>   look up my tarot <br> get the star+strength, think its cool as fuck <br> read up on their meanings <br><br> strengths <br><br>What the fuck?

You don't need to draw Arnold Schwarzenegger to show a respectable and merciful man.<br><br>Spike Spiegel or Vash the Stampede are skinny as fuck but still manly, right?</br></br></br>  <br>No worries, I really like his art style. <br><br><br>To be fair, the GOAT manly anime character (Captain Harlock) is not swole in the slightest. <br><br>Part 5 had some outrageous shit going on it but the way Araki started drawing eyes/noses/facial features along with people have more normal sized bodies meant his characters started to physically look more female. Not that it mattered that much, I still liked it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Araki stopped caring about how to draw noses by the end of Part 4.</br>    Reminder that Kujo Josefumi's hair looks stupid.  <br>He remembered how to after a while though.</br>  <br>it looks way better than the sleeper agent's from part 4</br>  <br>It took until later in Part 7 for him to start caring again.</br>  <br>ASB has the best look for Johnny.

This one is really nice. I expected it to be full on yuri action with lolis but was pleasantly surprised. It has its share of nice funny moments and some drama and Yuki is heartwarming.  <br>No not really. Hanayamata was Kirara Forward, don't remember how much it sold but it wasn't spectacular by any means. <br><br>The Kirara magazines have different audiences, so even though KinMoza that runs in Max sells well, this might not. Kirara adaptions have been pretty up and down in terms of sales.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon~</br>  <br>I see. <br>Damn there's a lot of different Kirara magazines, I never expected so many.</br></br>  <br>There used to be more but they scrapped a few, Carino (Mado no Mukougawa please come back) comes to mind.</br>  Probably far right, Side pony tail is cute as shit.<br><br><br> fang. <br>Oh here we FUCKING go.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you read any manga at all? It seems like you always only watch anime and never read source material. You really should read Gakkou Gurashi's manga, it's very good.</br>  <br>Yes, please read it. I don't want to see you shitting up the threads with how it's nothing like you thought it would be.</br>  <br>Please make us a favor and read the manga. At least this time, Lelouch.</br>  <br>did she just stop a bolt from a crossbow fired from other survivors tuned raiders?<br><br>damn, that's really becoming just like my zombie apocalypse games.</br></br></br>  <br>It's ok she's turning into Wesker</br>  <br><br>Kurumi, I started reading the manga a few days ago and am really enjoying it now, can't wait for the anime to start airing.</br></br>  <br>Don't know anything about this series but I'd furiously fuck twintails girl.</br>  <br>Sorry for /v/, but from the latest chapters, GG is really turning into DayZ with cute girls.<br><br>It basically has everything: Zombies that are dumb and predictable, but are still a deadly threat when outnumbering you, other survivors and raiders you learn to fear and shoot on sight, that looting and scavenging in the ruins of a abandoned city, driving around with a car you have fixed yourself, the camaraderie of your small band of friends... It is basically amongs the best zombie-outbreak survivor story around in this medium. <br><br>It only lacks the can of Heinz Beanz, and you are basically set.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>C R A Z Y<br>R<br>A<br>Z<br>Y</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>;_;</br>  <br>I want to feel her softness.</br>  <br>She looks way too young compared to </br>  <br>Looks like Yuki can only hold people together for so long. Wonder what will happen when she realises she's useless.<br><br><br>That's a very weak link. Plenty of films have also have the same idea.</br></br></br></br>  btw, on the day the anime air, should the thread be turned into an innocent thread which everyone act as if they haven't heard of the existence of manga?  So is Yuki just really stupid or is there something wrong/speshul about her?  <br>Of course.</br>  <br>Don't fake shit. There will be plenty of people who genuinely went into this thinking it was going to be a moe SoL already making threads of their own.<br><br>The OP of course shouldn't spoil it though.<br><br><br>Read the manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wont work, because there's always someone who will spoil.<br><br>But, yes. I'll do my best.</br></br></br>  <br>The whole manga should be dumped in the first thread, or at least the first volume.</br>  <br>I did. It's confronted but not explained.</br>  <br> btw <br>Out</br></br>  I hope this shit don't have yuri because I will riot, shitpost and samefag to the maximum level of butthurt.  <br>well, you can see her eyes isn't normal anymore<br>so yeah she's turned into wesker-like human</br></br>  <br>It doesn't and won't unless the studio decides to pander.</br>  <br>Yeah, anime design made them look like middle schoolers at most.<br><br>I dont hate it, but it is far from ideal.<br><br>The more mature look of the manga characters made them fit the gritty art more.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just some light subtext between Mikkun and Yuki, and few moments between Mikkun and Kurumi. Other then that, it's just your regular cute girls fighting zombies kinda deal.</br>  <br>Get ready.</br>  <br>The question is will it keep growing? She didn't seem this fast or strong earlier. If it does, she could turn into a monster in from of them. Ultimate suffering.</br>  <br>Fuck. Lelouch has arrived. Series is ruinned for me now.</br>  <br>Well, for now, Kurumi being this awesome is what's keeping them alive every time they have to fight. We'll see what happens later on.</br>  <br>Nah, it doesn't have yuri</br>  <br>and also, as from extra of earlier volume, the virus for the incident can be transmitted. Does these symptoms mean viruses in her body still growing and eventually will infect someone else while herself remain save?</br>  <br> Lelouch always liking the big onee-san-kinda girls. <br><br>Why is your taste so good, but you are still so shit?</br></br></br>  <br>That's a honey-trap for ambushing other survivors.<br><br>Garters is playing the trap, while Shovel is in hiding, ready to strike the first one who goes near Garters to rape her as she is lying around so lasciviously.</br></br></br>  <br>Kurumi turning into a monster or Rii going beyond mental, wonder what will happen first. <br><br><br>I think so. Consider she has essentially a block on the zombie symptoms but still actually has the cells inside her. She's safe but if anyone's dream does come true and they have an orgy then everyone else will catch it, I guess. <br><br>If you tell me which volume I can go check if it hasn't been translated and uploaded somewhere.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Rii isn't mental already. </br>  <br>vol.3, i believe</br>  <br>i can see that scenario is the perfect ending of the series<br> they saved by government / JSDF by helicopter <br> kurumi turned into a zombie before she's get into the helicopter <br> the rest of the group watch kurumi is being killed by government army / JSDF </br></br></br></br>  Rii has such a nice body and all of her poses are naturally sexual.<br><br>Even when fighting zombies.</br></br>  <br>Not crazy enough yet. She needs to reach the level where suicide seems like the right option. Then after Yuki saves her she just gets worse and turns into the kill everyone else crazy. <br><br><br>Don't even know what good end could happen honestly. <br><br><br>I'll go see if I can find it, there's so much extra stuff at the end of the volumes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> impyling she wont be like Megu-nee and use her sheer willpower to protect them, even if she was turned a zombie, holding off a large horde to buy her dear friends some more time. <br> implying they wont cry and watch her from afar, how she is fighting like a beast with her shovel and getting eaten limb for limb. <br> implying this wont scar the girls forever and all will end with PTSD </br></br></br>  Mii-kun is cute.<br>CUTE!</br>  <br>well the writer is nitroplus guy after all<br>good ending is not an option</br></br>  <br> Then after Yuki saves her she just gets worse and turns into the kill everyone else crazy. <br>Call me optimistic, but I think she's going to get better after she accepts her sister is dead. Yuuki herself was really fucked up but she got better eventually.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't, but you should kill yourself for even thinking about shitposting.</br>  <br>Not happening.
