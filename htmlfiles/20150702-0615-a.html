[ Last chapters Crafty spoilers (so that the suspense stays) are out. The ride will be over im hours.<br><br>What are yout bets, people?</br></br>  <br> that Kushina <br>She's really getting into it, isn't she?</br></br>  <br> At that point in the story and Sakura supposedly having those "feelings", Naruto wasn't rich, or ultra famous (infamous, maybe), her having a subtle, yet telling transition in which she gets over Sasuke and starts to have romantic feelings about Naruto wouldn't have looked that bad and would have given her an actual development (at least if she only gets over Sasuke). <br>It could also be because Japan culturally have a soft spot for "retardly loyal" characters. Characters who stuck to their allegiance even though it no longer suits their own interests, because they rather die than change their position. In Japanese culture there seem to be a level of respect given to such characters.<br>The issue here is that it gets very bad vibes of Sakura being stuck in a struggling relationship.</br></br></br>  <br>He did say he briefly considered turning Sakura into the romantic interest, and I say that as a Hinatafag.<br>He also considered making the Third a dog and Naruto an actual fox cub that transforms into a real boy.<br>He had an idea, then discarded it as garbage even for him. He probably also 'considered' making Hinata the main heroine after having half the people he works with spell it out to him how much better she would be in that role, but nothing came of that either.</br></br></br>  <br>it's not about money, naruto was already getting popular by the time part 2 started</br>  <br> worried about Sauce acting like an asshole <br>Why? Then we know everything as it's supposed to be. If he starts acting like a good husband and father, then we worry.</br></br>  What's wrong with this image?  <br>k</br>  <br>that's right bitch you ain't got shit to say to me right ese<br><br>fuckin nerd watchin his stupid sol harem crap and thinking it's such nongeneric high classy taste</br></br></br>  <br>They couldn't get rid of their wonderful leader though</br>  <br>projecting again?</br>  <br>i'll project my big black dick into your eye sockets</br>  Left or right, /a/?  Black &gt; Pink &gt; Orange &gt; Silver  <br> Silver <br>More like Diamond amirite?</br></br>  <br>not nearly enough people still care about oreshura</br>  Orange &gt; Pink &gt; Black &gt; Impassable Wall &gt; Shit &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Silver  Left. Uncommon loli figure&gt;&gt; figure of a hag  DATABASE DATABASE<br>JUST LIVING IN THE DATABASE WOW WOW</br>  I FRY, AMAZE IT CRORE VAVY  UU~ NYA~ <br>UU~ NYA~</br>  ZZAAAAANNNKOOKUUU  NEKO NYAN DANCU<br>NEKO NYAN DANCU</br>  BESTU NI GO GOUIN NI MAI YEAH  Evangelion is garbage.  Rei is the best girl  Agreed  <br>yep i agree</br>    Agreed, Q is terrible. NGE is still fantastic though.  One Page Thread          <br> won <br> korean dog cartoons </br></br>  Crabs will attempt to explain this.  <br>I would not make up my own plot, but the plot is much less important in the Monogatari series compared to the other factors. Obviously it is nice that there is SOME form of plot, but the series is already very good without the plot being a major point.<br><br>I spoiled it because some people have a thought process that goes like this.<br> fanservice <br> inherently shit <br>even though this series uses fanservice in a very good way.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm Japanese <br>Why you gaijins can understand Japanese Anime?<br>it is usually japanese costom described<br>it is a question</br></br></br>    <br>Probably didn't have to be that soft but meh. I'm just going to assume they're dumb and not malicious in this case.</br>  <br>You little shit</br>   No KyoAni this season <br><br>Why live?</br></br>  <br><br>Did the Free! boys save the world with a kiss? Did the Free! boys possibly save the world hundreds of times over by standing up to God with a raised fist, causing her to rethink her opinion of other people as her toys and somewhat calming her overactive imagination in the process? Protip: pic related.</br></br>  <br>if you want one so bad why don't you ask for it?<br><br>81 774-33-1130<br><br>maybe you can ask them why chuu2 sucked so hard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks, I think Kanna might be second on my KyoAni girls list. Haven't really thought about it or anything, but she's pretty great, not that this is a unique opinion around here or anything. /a/ has always loved Kanna.</br></br>  <br>Finally someone who hates the too perfect Miyuki. Mugi was a 100% better character despite what LS fags might say.</br>  <br> There isn't enough CONTENT for another Haruhi season <br><br> suggesting kyoani cant drag haruihi content out </br></br></br>  Check your favorite manga site.  <br>Kuro, Kirie y Karin.<br><br>on the other hand<br><br><br>Touta will be jealous of negi, fate and Nagi.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I  hope  that kuro will be a bro in the end. Even with how girly he acts, it feels like all he wants to do is fist bump touta and engage in some jolly cooperation.</br>  <br>yes, i hope that Touta and Kuro will be the best friend.</br>  his chapter, in some way, I feel VERY sorry for this Evangeline, besides I think that the Evangeline of the present time besides suffer all this, she hadnâ€™t Touta at her side if Dana erased her memories about Touta.  <br>yeah I see some arguments about this over in jp forums too. This chapter has 10 years fgo by for her, but how long do all the other gaps go.<br><br>Is she counting that headpat in her 18 years statement? If so, then there's another 8 years during those other appearances. On the one hand, she seems to talk about days and weeks before meeting, but on the other, there's stuff like how they didn't speak a common language at first, but then Eva was able to speak to him on subsequent appearances suggesting a real passage of time. Not to mention the growth of her power and knowledge.</br></br></br>  Araki is a genius. What are your thoughts on the new Jojo chapter?  <br>It's good that Araki is still going strong. Why can't Miura and Togashi follow his example?</br>  <br> canon colors <br> Jojo <br><br>At least you're right about Yasuho being best girl. I sincerely hope that outfit will be one of her alts in EoH.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Araki isn't a /v/irgin, unlike those two scrubs,</br>  <br>Pink makes sense but idk about brown. If it were "canon" brown her hair would be darkened in the manga. When it's white, so it'd have to be a light color.<br><br><br>We need that and her biker outfit or riot. <br><br>Speaking of alt costumes, what are your alt costume wish list for EoH. Including characters that aren't in the game</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If Trish is announced, I'd like to see her in her cleaning lady outfit.  I also hope she can partner with Mista, because pic related. </br>  I made a thread which accidentally broke the rule that you cant ask for any reccomendations. There, people expressed their hatred towards harems and TWGOK. Why do people hate harem and TWGOK so much?? How are harems not good?<br><br>I really hope this isnt breaking any rules...</br></br>  <br>bad example. worst example.</br>  <br> same thing applies to people who constantly whine about their lack of a healthy social life <br><br>Also, what did that actually have to do with the anon you replied to? How is that a response?</br></br></br>  <br>Why am i not surprised?</br>  <br>But photos on android are usually named with date/timestamp/counter, it's iShit that renames/converts everything to image.jpg</br>  Why is it okay when people make disguised rec and sauce threads? It's not like they're any more knowledgable than those that just ask. They're just as unaware.  Takeuchi: "This will surpass UBW"<br><br>Can't wait.<br><br>http://otakomu.jp/archives/273516.h<wbr>tml</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> what is KnK <br>But its not like they've done a lot of series.</br></br>  <br> only to make up for the shit that Kariya was <br>No, it's because Zouken wanted to screw Kariya over. Kariya could have actually sustained all that's needed another servant class. Had Zouken decided to have him summon Lancelot in another class, Kariya would have fared better.</br></br>  <br>How about you quote something that says Berserker Lancelot would have higher stats under a stronger master? <br>Go read the fucking LN and VN before you come here and post fanfiction.</br></br>  <br>Can't handle the darkness, which is why her Instinct also got fucked. Lancelot has EAM to deal with rage issues.</br>  <br>KnK wasn't very good.</br>  Spoilers out, Sabo refuses to finish off Burgess, Burgess bt- oh wait, I forgot, I'm over 18.   reminder that the doffy vs luffy fight is almost 4 and half hours long <br> entire dressrosa arc is longer than the lord of the rings trilogy  <br><br>I'm going to hang up one piece until the series ends and marathon this shit for two weeks, got the time off work ready to go.<br> my bosses faces when I explain why I need two weeks off </br></br></br></br>  <br>Cool blog man, where do I subscribe?</br>  <br> spending 8 years away from One Piece <br>I don't know how I could handle it.<br>All the fucking spoilers.</br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't go necessarily say the series needed to mature after the timeskip, but following up the most serious, high stakes arc (which had been steadily built towards) with everything Fishman Island was was a bad move</br>  Which part of One Piece brought the heaviest feels to you?<br><br>Pic related.</br></br>  ITT: Girls who should have won.  <br>Yup, Yui<br><br>And I guess you're right about that. Besides Yui, I guess Kanon also had her life changed positively?</br></br></br>  Weren't there a bunch of unresolved plotholes?  I'm still upset about this.  <br>Rushed plotlines, not unresolved.<br><br>Elsie was probably going to be more antagonistic.</br></br></br>  <br>Because idiots can't distinguish them liking a character from the protagonist liking a character.<br><br>You don't have to like who Keima likes, but shit like  is pure retardation.</br></br></br>  Monmusu thread!<br>Go.</br>  <br>Each girl doesn't know much about human cinema and wants you to surprise her.</br>  <br>Then you ask her if there is a specific genre they would like to watch. Who knows? Maybe your homestay likes horror films or superhero movies or even, heaven forbid, romantic comedies.</br>  <br><br>Come to think of it, we don't know much about each girl's tastes in media and fiction.<br><br>For Miia, all we really know is that she likes Fairy Tales and the Magical Girl anime genre, and hates horror-movies.<br><br>Outside of that it's a shot in the dark for her.<br><br>My guess is that she'd probably be into any tradition Magical Girl anime that isn't total shit (she also wouldn't mind watching it with subs since she was apparently a fan of the genre before she learned Japanese).<br>She'd probably also get a kick out of shows like Once Upon A Time that bring the concept of Fairy Tales into a modern urban setting in an interesting way (which has eerie parallels with the world of Monster Musume no Iru Nichijo, now that I think about it).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Best Beast  <br>What size are those tits? I remember Tio bring a P cup, those two have the biggest tits right now</br></blockquote>]
