And a general doesn't necessarily have to be labelled as such.<br><br>The existence of that thread preempts the existence of this one.</br></br></br>  Casear makes my heart smile  <br>Thought I was the only one. He doesn't seem very popular around these parts</br>  Post your favorite tankobon cover art.        <br>TOGASHIIIIIIII</br>      <br>You. I like you.</br>      <br/>  <br>Mah nigga.</br>  I just love colorful Hoshino's art is.    <br> pitou  <br> girl  <br><br>CONFIRMED</br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks pretty washed out to me.</br>    <br>do you know what an allegory is? do you know the difference between literal and figurative language?</br>  <br> comic books <br>Shouldn't you be at /co/?</br></br>    MPD Psycho has some of the most arresting covers.        Actually almost every Yotsuba&amp;! covers are my favorite. But this one takes the cake I guess.      such a mischievous and playful cover, I love it.  <br><br><br>Do you?</br></br></br>      <br>yes, which is why the allusion to the actual painting isn't indicative of Pitou's gender - of which whose gender isn't the point of its character's importance.</br>  Such an amazing cover art.  <br>Based Velazquez</br>  <br>the tankobon art alone certainly isn't indicative of pitou being female, but it sure does add to the case.</br>  <br>only if you're desperate enough to use confirmation bias and moreover if there is even a case to be fought over - Pitou's gender is inconsequential because it's intentionally ambiguous. Togashi operates a certain way for a reason.</br>        Read the guide before asking anything buyfag related.<br><br>http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  I have Sayla preordered.  <br>That is one pretty figure.</br>  maybe one day i'll finish gundam. then i can move onto zeta  <br>Then you can watch the true masterpiece, ZZ.</br>  https://order.mandarake.co.jp/order<wbr>/detailPage/item?itemCode=101386728<wbr>2&amp;ref=list<br><br>Version 2 coming too I bet.</br></br></wbr></wbr>  I got something a little different from the usual buyfaggotry in the mail today. My Takarajima (Treasure Island) animation cel arrived today. Cels from Takarajima are really hard to find. I've only been able to find one site that has them, they only had a small selection.  <br>Anime ja nai!</br>  <br>I never said it was.</br>  <br>Its Ple</br>  <br>I thought turn A was the masterpiece</br>  <br>I watched about 16 episodes, it's kinda stupid and the mecha designs are awful. At least Laura is cute.</br>  <br>Good to know the site's at least legit.</br>  <br>Don't you already have a few of these?<br><br>Anyways, they're not uncool. Congratulations on your finds.</br></br></br>  Can't stop thinking about this beauty.  <br>So many gatari characters, I don't know if I should buy them all or none at all.</br>  <br>How about you only buy Kissshot and Shinobu.</br>  <br>Right now I have both ougi and kiss-shot on preorder. You just gotta get both.</br>   moving out because you can't bear the shame of your figure collection of half naked women to your family   <br>I already preordered Kissshot. I'm considering Nadeko.</br>  I didn't see anything in the guide related to managing finances related to figure purchases. I was wondering how you guys keep track of how much you will owe per month and all that.<br><br>Thinking about making a simple Excel file, but I was curious to see if anyone here does anything different.</br></br>  <br>I fucking hate Ougi but this is really nice.<br><br>Such a strange conflict.</br></br></br>  <br> not hiding your figure collection in your closet in led lit deltofs </br>  But what if I only want GAR things?  <br> still living with your parents when buying that shit <br>damn you really fucked up</br></br>  <br>Nope, this is my first cel.<br><br><br>Yeah, they were pretty fast with shipping too.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm the only one who thinks this will bin?<br><br>Just going by MFC numbers, there's 1k people with her on pre-order, then add the Japanse and the number can grow 3 times more or so, yet she's still available fucking everywhere. Kinda feel this is going to end up like Mikasa, shit ton of people with her, yet it never ran out of stock and now is selling for like 6k.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I just display them anyway</br>  <br>whatever</br>  <br>Work is less than 30 minutes away and I live here rent free while paying student loans.<br><br>Seems dumb to move out. Besides the obvious shame.<br><br><br>Could try this.<br><br><br>You are a better man than I.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it might be a case of them overestimating the popularity and making too many, or it's just been SO LONG since it was announced nobody cares any more<br><br>... or they're just waiting for kizu to air then it'll be super popular - himouto stuff on amiami went from nothing to the 5 most popular spots after the first episode aired so it can happen if SHAFT actually fucking finish it</br></br></br>  <br>Even though you ask, it's not like there is any solid alternative to an Excel spreadsheet.<br><br>I recall many people here manage their orders on Excel. It's easy to make and use.</br></br></br>    Anybody else getting the pink version? I'd prefer the original version but I missed out on it. Pink hair looks alright to though.  <br>I used one for about a month and stopped. I don't see the point unless you spend a huge amount every month or are really poor.</br>  <br>who wants a gomora?</br>  Does anyone have experience with those $15-25 chinese knockoff oppai/butt mousepads form ebay?<br>Not expecting them to be anywhere near official ones, but are they at least serviceable?</br>  <br>Get the best one.</br>  <br>I like Ultraman, so this and the Baltan have me kind of tempted, but I don't collect girl figures.</br>  <br><br>I use Excel, I got a job exclusively to maintain this hobby, so it helps me keep track of how much am I going to spend each month and if I can spend more if anything goes up without warning.</br></br>  <br>How about you just buy an official one?</br>  <br><br>I don't known the character and I usually don't like male figures, but that one looks pretty cool.</br></br>  <br>Wow<br><br>super cute</br></br></br>  <br>I have the original, but I can't decide if I want to buy this one, or not.</br>  <br>It's just aesthetically pleasing, don't mind the the character.</br>  <br>the only official ones that interest me are in the hands of scalpers and cost about 3 times as much as I'm willing to pay.</br>  <br>How is the original anyways? Besides being over hyped, did it turn out alright?</br>  <br><br>Dat ass so phat, even the skirt clings to it.</br></br>  <br> did it turn out alright? <br><br>It turned out pretty great. <br><br>http://toy-navi.net/archives/441507<wbr>55.html</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they are probably made by the same chink as the official ones</br>  <br>That is super lewd.</br>  <br>Looks like I'm getting the strawberry version then.</br>   I missed preorders <br><br>Do you think there will be any Rankos after she gets released?</br></br>    <br>That's a tiny butt.</br>  <br><br>But it looks firm and tight, those are the properties of a good butt.</br></br>  <br>I think it could use a little more depth.</br>  Please sell on the PLUM shop so someone can sell this.  <br>This is the only worst girl worth getting.</br>  <br>Yes, preorders have been closed for months.</br>  <br>I buy too much with my dick. I have a thing for lolis in bathing suits / bikinis or lewder.</br>  <br> not putting them back in their packaging and hiding them in the closet every time you leave the house </br>  <br>I think it looks good.</br>  <br>are you me</br>  Is the Doflamingo figure worth the extra $40 to pre-order the European special edition of Pirate Warriors 3 or does it look like shit?  <br>It's not a bad figure but I don't want to support Date a Live since I hate haremshit. Tsunako's talent is wasted on it. Going to get the Black Heart figure though.</br>  <br>No other places open for them? I checked everything in the guide.<br><br>Here's hoping that some fags dont pay for her when she comes out or she gets a rerelease.</br></br></br>  <br>How is it haremshit if Touka is guaranteed towin?</br>  <br>Read the guide.</br>  <br> Tsunako's talent is wasted on it <br>You mean on nepshit.<br><br>DAL girls are much better.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying your parents won't visit now and then anyway <br>there's no escape.</br></br>  <br><br>Holy fuck, I want this.</br></br>  <br> I hate haremshit <br>pleb taste</br></br>  <br> that face <br> worth getting </br></br>  <br>Will someone please tell me what anime she comes from? I will fuck off afterwards.</br>  <br>yeah</br>  <br> Date A Live </br>  <br> likes haremshit  <br> calls me a pleb <br><br>Well, okay then.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks anon. I appreciate it.</br>  <br> I only like mature cartoons for mature men such as myself </br>  <br>Nigger are you retarded? I think you are if this is how you view people who don't like haremshit.</br>  <br>Is there a Nadeko fig up for preorder?</br>  Got this haul, everything was pretty well priced. Was happy to go 3/3 for best girls on the blind boxes.  <br>Damn fine camerawork<br>Damn fine image name<br>Damn fine figure</br></br></br>  <br>Could you please delete your comment? I'm black and this really offends me. Mods?</br>  <br>Stop being black so you won't get offended</br>  <br>I'm black and I think his post is aight<br>You on the other hand need to get your ass to reddit</br></br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128270385 <br>Please stop, I'm shaking because I'm so angry.</br>  <br>Harem genre is a founding father of anime. If you hate harem, you hate fun and all anime.</br>    <br>There's always a few around near release, plus if she gets delayed (she will) then there might be a few open then, too.<br><br>I'm hoping for a similar thing, I held off on getting any CGs for ages and now I have Mika and Rin I want Ranko too.</br></br></br>  <br>Ranko box has already been shown. It's coming out next month. It's already had two delays anyway.</br>  <br>BUT WILL IT LOOK LIKE SHIT</br>  <br>If you read the guide you would know.</br>  <br>Nothing wrong with it.</br>  <br> I'm black </br>  <br>You won't get much help around here, even for shit not in the guide. Then they'll complain about spoon feeding you.<br><br>Some links in the comments. <br>http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>304196</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mead's designs <br> awful <br>Fuck you</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks bro, this helps.</br>  <br>Only that one picture you've probably seen already but it doesn't look too bad for the extra money. Get that nice box too.</br>  <br>This is the only nice one.</br>  <br>I really hope we get to see the actual figure at wonfes</br>  <br>Like I said, fuck you and your shit taste.</br>  <br><br>Is that a new Regi pokemon?</br></br>  <br>I'm betting no, since it was only announced last Wonfest. They've been much slower on the time between announcing and sculpting figures these days.</br>  <br>Total opposite, most manufacturers used to announce figures that were released years later. Nowadays we get some figures and preorders going up in mere weeks.</br>  <br>Figures also look better than ever nowadays.<br>I wish they would go back and do some old properties, some characters only have shitty figures or none at all.</br></br>  <br>今冬</br>  <br>Of course buddy, this winter. I swear</br>  <br>I'd spread my vanilla all over that ware</br>   Amazon selling nendoroids directly from their warehouses <br>They can be trusted right? They have one I want for the same price as mandarake but I won't have to pay shipping on amazon and I get that prime 2 day.</br>  Out of curiosity, why's Alter's Vivio always so cheap?<br><br>The figure looks amazing, why's it always like 3k when all other Alter figs tend to shoot up in price?</br></br>  <br>Ya, you're totally right, just like Phat's Anastasia, or GSC's Kiss shot, or MF's Lucina/Satsuki.<br> newfags </br></br>  <br>How much did the madoka production notes cost you? I already have them, but I'm curious.<br><br>And I got that prize figure this month, she's great.</br></br></br>  <br>it's old</br>  <br>You mean three figures that g against the general trend? Shocking. Now compare that to every Sin by Amakuni, Hestia and Momohime by them as well, or all the figures by Alha Max since their first Alisa. <br><br><br>Now go back to some years ago and check what we had back then, DArtagnan took 4 years, ignis of the endless winter took 5, All the Hyaka Ryouran Figures took at least a year, go even further back, Shii by GSC took 2 years, BRS took two years as well,. It wasn't that rare to see the exact same figure unpainted for three straight wonfes. <br><br>And if you want a larger sample look at Orchid Seed, they keep a years long queue of figures since 7-8 years ago and jsut recently they hav gotten into the sub-yearly releases.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody liked Vivio in Strikers</br>  <br>As long as it doesn't look like shit it's an insta-buy for me, I love snake god Nadeko.</br>  <br>The fact she barely even appears in that form, probably. I have her though, she's pretty great. Looks lovely alongside Signum too.</br>  <br>theres also the ougi figure that was posted before.<br>it was announced at the same wonfes and is already up for preorder.</br></br>  <br> talking about a GSC figure. <br> writes a paragraph on non GSC figures, as if that has anything to do with what was said. <br>dumb.</br></br></br>  Did anyone here buy the various merchandise for Houkago no Pleiades? <br><br>I bought the entire set of it, for some reason they didn't ship it all together though and one of the packages is stuck in customs.</br></br>  <br><br>Says the retard who can't even read.</br></br>  <br>Nothing pains me more than knowing that this masterpiece sold poorly and we'll never see anything more than what is already out on amiami. I bought a key chain, quality figures never ;_;</br>  <br>I'm sure they are fine,   but I'm not sure and I just ordered one too.  </br>  <br> How your car will perform with these new additions </br>  <br>I don't even know who this is but I want it.</br>  <br>I preordered a mug on amiami.</br>    <br><br>Was this honestly worth picking up? It was one of the few series last season I didn't even watch the pilot of.</br></br>  <br>yeah, sure bro</br>  <br>I got both for 160. I wasn't going to get the normal note but I figured the autism of getting one and not the other to save around 10 dollars would eat at me. Felt the same about Hibiki until I noticed I couldn't find her cheaper online.</br>  <br><br>That fucking paranoia, holy shit.</br></br>  <br>How do you not know Sayla?</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Maybe he's new.<br>Also, any Lalah figures?</br></br>  <br>Aunt Jemima bottles are still a thing, I think.</br>  <br>I instantly dismissed his comment as sheer bait and didn't even bother replying since I assume everyone knows the important characters from the original Gundam--if they don't know them then they aren't even worth responding to in the first place.</br>  <br>Eh... I don't get it.</br>  Why do most shows get clear files for merchandise? Do people actually use them?    <br>I think it's just an easy way to merchandise illustrations alongside posters.</br>  Who would buy this?<br><br> page9.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/jp/aucti<wbr>on/k193343255</wbr> </br></br>  <br>I use them, they come in handy sometimes.</br>  <br>Holy shit that is hilarious. Look at pochaco go. Too many people scared of going boom.</br>   awesome design <br> unique take on character <br> <br>Oh yeah, I can't wait to... <br><br> Play Arts Kai <br><br>God.Is.Dead.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck. Looks like some bid was rescinded? Shows 702,000 en now. Still, too fucking much.</br>  <br> awesome design <br>That's debatable.</br></br>  <br>I thought Rin hasn't gotten a phat yet.</br>  <br> people still think paks are bad </br>  <br>Maybe recent PAKs aren't as terrible as some older ones, but they are still shit.</br>  So, amiami isn't letting me log in and I don't know why. Whenever I try to log in it says "There was an error with your e-mail address and/or password. Please try again." and I even tried the "did you forget your password?" option but it isn't working either. <br><br>What's up with this? My account was working just fine a few days ago.</br></br>  <br>At least Subaru has an okay figure that's not too hard to get. <br>There's also that one doujinshi and the artbook, although the former is impossible to find at a decent price so I just settled for xpoz's other unrelated doujin.</br></br>  <br>Did you cancel anything recently?<br>I'd say shoot them an email.</br></br>  <br>I found the scene the cel is from. It's from episode one, the scene where Benbow attacks Billy Bones.</br>  Why havent NG gotten figures from Phat yet? Minami is next.  <br>Happened to me before, just send them an email saying you can't log in and don't wanna make a new account since it's a rule violation.</br>  <br>Because they got ones from GSC.</br>  <br>I have one of mai waifu I use for keeping paperwork and info pages in when I'm travelling.</br>  <br>So phat isnt allowed to do the? I want a good Rin and I dont like GSCs</br>  <br>She hasn't, I got the GSC one. Since Phat is under the GSC umbrella they're probably avoiding doing the same girls.</br>  <br>It may happen eventually. I like the GSC ones but I'd like a set of NG in matching outfits.</br>  <br> NG in matching outfits. <br>Fuck NG. I want Triad Primus in matching outfits. I'm really tempted to get Rin's GSC but I'm holding out for something better. Phat ones are an instant preorder though,</br></br>  <br>WASH AWAY THE ANGER.</br>  <br>Who did the Subaru fig I want to pick one up now</br>  <br>Not enough belts.</br>  <br>And she was from back when the ova happened in 2012</br>   some shitty watermarks but whatever <br><br>This figure looks hot as HELL</br></br>    <br>Didn't cancelled anything, idk what's going on.<br><br><br>Thanks! Emailed them already.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Link?</br>  <br>Only if it's fulfilled.</br>  <br>No. How hard is it to search Pleiades, or even Pleiades + mug on amiami? Come on.</br>  <br>Did you import the swimming wear?</br>  Thinking about ordering this in the hopes that they make a Yuudachi one too.  <br> being gaijin and supporting boatshit.  <br>I'll never understand</br></br>  <br>What does that have to do with anything? It's not like gaijin can't play.</br>  <br> being gaijin and supporting japanshit <br>It's fucking retarded, right?</br></br>  <br>What does being gaijin have to do with anything? We can play boats just like anyone else.</br>  <br>Not all gaijin are EOP, and you don't even need to know nip to play the game or enjoy the character designs/voices.</br>  <br>You are actually fucking retarded. The irony is real</br>  <br>Because the series revolves around japanese warships and a lot of Japs support it also because they see it as nationalistic. It's not like they're American or EEuropean boats</br>   http://page4.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/<wbr>jp/auction/d168072732</wbr> <br><br>How much are you willing to pay for your waifu /a/ ?</br></br>  <br>this actually looks really good. i've never even played kancolle</br>  <br>and?</br>  <br>A lot more than that.</br>  <br>About tree fiddy</br>  <br>at least twice that</br>  <br>those hips</br>  <br>I'm German. I am 100% ok with supporting it.<br><br>Unlike butthurt Americans, apparently.</br></br></br>  <br>the amount of references to the ships being sunk in real life is pretty funny.</br>  <br>Thanks m8 just ordered her from hobby link</br>  <br>No, I got them at  SDCC . The shop had it for retail price, same as the GuPs.</br>  <br>What are Bismarck, Prinz Eugen, Z1, Z3, U-511, Littorio, and Roma then?</br>  I love getting multiple packages in a week.<br><br>Somehow Amazon's packaging was better than FromJapan's.</br></br>  <br>Non-Allied ships.</br>  <br>What was your recent activity on the site?<br>You might have gotten banned, happened to me when I purchased an item for a trade with a guy on MFC, had it shipped directly to him.<br>They unbanned me but I was pretty mad.</br></br></br>  <br>No shit, you're an axis power. Of course you'll support your Japanese brothers.</br>  <br>Wow, AX was selling the GuPs for $10 each.</br>  <br>i need this in my life</br>  <br><br>I am convinced the crotch plate is forced cast-off. But i need proof.</br></br>  <br>Eagerly awaiting owari in the fall.</br>  Starting to realize I hate long hair on figures. Always feels like it's going to break.  <br><br> being butthurt about a conflict that ended decades before you were born </br></br>  <br>That's the price he bought it for. I saw the booth at SDCC.</br>   https://<span>youtu.be/-Jsy7xx0ltA  [ ]   <br>Buy it and let us know</br>  <br>I saw another shop selling blind boxes for 15+ apiece too, nobody there bought anything from what I could see.</br>  <br><br> buy it. <br><br>Like i can now.</br></br></br></br>  I preordered Sayla<br><br>Now give me a good figure of this goddess.</br></br>  Symphogear scale this WF?  <br>After listening to the OST properly I feel like I should buy it.</br>  <br>Don't hold your breath, anon.</br>  Postman showed up right before I left on a trip so these pictures were rushed. I'll unbox them and post pictures when I get home if no one else posts theirs.  <br>We need a Char figure more than anyone else.</br>  <br>There's already one.</br>  <br>Then why do you care?</br>  <br>Still waiting on an Amuro. I almost bought his prize figure for 5000 yen a while back. Kind of regretting not doing that, since now I can only find it on YJA and it's more of a hassle to get it there.</br>  <br><br>Because i want to own it anyways.</br></br>  <br> I love getting multiple packages in a week. <br>Same here. Getting a package can just brighten up your day. I'm glad years of being a poorfag taught me some self control, otherwise I'd be getting figures in the mail nonstop.</br></br>  <br>I don't understand why some of you faggots do this. What do you need to rush and post shitty pics for? If someone else posts it doesn't mean you can't, it wouldn't even take much effort to do better than this. I just hate you.<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128278804 <br>By shoving all my merch up your ass.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128278804 <br>I ask them to understand.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128278804 <br>i cover them in a blanket of cum</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128278804 <br>Like this</br>  <br>R.I.p</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128278804 <br> hiding things <br>I display them at work. Not the lewd ones, obviously.</br></br>  <br>I was just about to order the Hibiki figma off of the after market, but I think I'll wait until Wonfes is said and done to see what comes out of that first.</br>  <br>Use excel. It's really the best way. I'm not poor like one guy mentioned but it helps if you order a lot and from different places. <br><br>In my excel I put down what I'd estimate shipping to be, paypal conversion, links to the item, etc.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's pretty great. Iwasaki Taisei did an amazing job for his first anime soundtrack.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128278804 <br>I don't. Even my naked/lewd loli figures stay out in the open. Family and friends either don't care or they think it's "cute".</br>  <br>Actually there are far better alternatives, depending on the use you want from it. Personally I use Mint for Android, keeps track of expenses, income bills and whatnot.</br>  <br>I just have a note on my iphone with figure names, release dates and prices.<br>also have any other stuff like video games there so i can make sure im properly budgeted for everything.</br></br>  <br>I want to do indecent things to this body.</br>  I just manage my figure expenses like this. I have a 300-400 monthly budget When I receive an item, I just save what I spent on mfc.  <br>I usually don't do stuff like that but I wanted to prompt someone else to post theirs since I can't enjoy mine yet, sorry. Usually I'd take the pieces of cardboard out of the window for more light but it's a bit of a hassle and I was being rushed out. I still tried to put in some effort where I could, the original pictures were much darker.</br>  <br>Don't do anything lewd to Noel's body please.</br>  <br>Ya blew it kid.</br>  <br> signed up for Mint when I had no job <br> each weekly email was a depressing reminder of all the money I didn't have <br>That said, this thread was a huge help during those times before I got a job, which was recently. It was kind of inspiring to see people's monthly orders and all the new figures that were coming out. Thanks, guys.</br></br></br>  <br>Shut up poorfag.</br>    In your opinion, what figures have exceptionally delicious thighs?    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128278804 <br>My collection is mostly made up of mechs and male figures like Lupin III and Cobra. I don't have anything that would warrent hiding even if I had a girlfriend.</br>  <br> mechs and male figures <br>Yes you do.</br></br>      <br>Na, this stuff is surprisingly acceptable around normalfags.</br>   want all the Kayon Alters <br> would cost me $400 <br>I should probably sell my Apple watch.</br></br>  <br>My dick</br>    <br>Head looks bad<br><br>Delicious body though</br></br></br>  Who is going to buy all 38 life-sized standees to party with 24/7 at home?  <br>He's not poor anymore you retard.</br>  <br>Horizon's shiny thighs are probably my favourite amongst all my figures.</br>  <br>Yeah they accept you for what you are, a manchild.</br>  <br>What are you going to do with them anon? Conga Line?</br>    <br><br>Yeah this just screams manchild to me. It's like adult transformers collectors, except worse.<br>At least with bishoujo figures people will think you aren't gay and you can be surrounded by pretty girls.

Thanks Anon!</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128282026 <br>I wish this maymay would end</br>  Is there a way to browse all figures binning on amazonjp or a way to setup alerts on new figures being binned?  <br>Na, it is Who's. As in who is pretending.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br><br>How?</br></br>  <br> the guide </br>  What's the general opinion on this? <br><br>I think it looks pretty good and most of the Broccoli figs I've seen look nice, but I'm still unsure.</br></br>  <br>Nice meme, faggot.</br>  <br>It's my favorite.</br>  <br>Cute as fuck</br>  <br> most of the Broccoli figs I've seen look nice </br>  <br>Looks adorable. I also got it preordered.</br>  <br><br>except I've read it and it doesn't tell me how to browse "all discounted" or something like that.</br></br>  <br> most of the Broccoli figs I've seen look nice <br>Maybe the prototypes.</br></br>  <br>It makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside whenever I see this. I am really looking forward to getting her. That being said, the fluffy bits such as those on her ankles, wrists in the ears tend not to translate well into 3d. <br><br>Something about a swarm of maggots spilling out.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No, the actual release.</br></br>  <br> Pic unrelated </br>  <br>Those looks rather bad paint jobs. Actually the pics in mfc with better lighting show the flaws way better</br>  <br><br> It makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside whenever I see this <br><br>Pretty much the same here, kinda weird since the source was more lewd than cute, at least for me. <br><br><br>Those are pics from users in MFC, you can check them yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The good quality pics at MFC just show how bad L broccoli is though.</br>  <br>You are hard to please. I bet you have trouble getting off.</br>  <br><br>I'm blind then, because I really don't see anything bad with them. I've seen way worse things from Koto and Phat! yet they are regarded as good.</br></br>  <br>Far from hard to please, just stating that they are not even average as a manufacturer, they are on the shit side of the spectrum.</br>  <br>What are you basing this on?</br>  <br>They're regarded as decent. Not good since their quality control is iffy at times.</br>  <br>Her boobs look like marshmallows</br>  Will she be delayed?  <br>Because only shit manufacturers dont even use proper skin tones on their figures . Hell the only ones I know that do that shit is Griffon, even QuesQ left that train long ago.</br>  <br><br>Griffon is the shit side of the spectrum, and those on the pic are nowhere near close to things like pic.</br></br>  <br>Hope not I want to hot glue her ASAP.</br>  <br>Yes, and this guy is gonna kill his neighbor's cat when it happens.</br>  <br><br>What's even a "proper skin tone"?</br></br>  <br>Yeah you are right, a t least griffon doesn't use stupidly pale skin tones</br>  <br>Do you see a date?<br>http://www.alter-web.jp/shipment/in<wbr>dex.html</wbr></br></br>  <br>what a fucking shitter.</br>  <br>Bona fide pussy slayers are a rare breed on /a/</br>  <br><br>but she IS pale in the fucking game. <br><br>Honestly, it feels like you're just grasping at straws at this point.</br></br></br></br>  Also should we go to how shitty their lining on the paint looks? Or how bad those seams are?   people buy figures that aren't Alter/MF/Koto   <br>Ah right, how about THICK FUCKING NECKS<br><br>And seams, and paintjob again, and that hair</br></br></br>  <br> listing Koto <br> not GSC </br></br>  <br>You are 5 years late or so, Koto has been out of the loop for a while.<br><br>There are better players in the game now.</br></br></br>  <br>I think you mean GSC/MF/Alter. Plenty of people avoid Koto.</br>   checked out the Stahldas glass display cabinet from last thread <br> Europe, UK, and Ireland company <br><br>So is there a similar large glass display case one can find in the US that isn't covered in wood on the sides? I've been on the fence with detolfs but I'd easily need 3-4 to hold most of my collection.</br></br></br>  <br>Uni was never that pale at least not flatly pale.</br>  <br>Not even that anon but as someone who likes uni that skin tone and face was the main reason I didn't get it.<br><br>She was pale but her skin tone looked like a skin tone, not whatever that is on the prototype.</br></br></br>   Delayed <br><br>Well. That's a bummer. My July order just got a lot slimmer.</br></br>  <br>Why does her face always look so fucked up?</br>  <br> Racing Miku Delayed <br> Matsuri Delayed <br> Jack the Stripper Delayed <br><br>At least you still have a July order, mine is nonexistent now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128278804 <br>Who the fuck has, or wants a 3D girlfriend, you gigantic faggot?</br>  <br><br><br>How long does it take for AmiAmi to tell you an item has been delayed and reflect it on your order? I have Muramasa and Koishi in my order, Koishi is in stock but since Muramasa is not and they're still part of the same order it's bogging the rest of the process down.</br></br></br>  <br>Tacky and ugly.</br>  <br>1-3 days. If you want them to split the order faster you can send a ticket/email and they comply within hours during their working hours.</br>  <br> Soiling Mikoto with your homosexual opinions </br>  Who getting Anya?<br><br>Minami is also announced. Do you think Minami will be in a Love Laika outfit as well? I'd like something more original to herself personally.</br></br>    <br>Matching Love Laika would be great but that would mean Minami would be laying down as well and that takes up more shelf room.</br>  <br>Yes she will. <br>Phat's other CGs are all card based, but this isn't so the fact they announced her as Anya's prototype was shown most likely implicates they will match. <br><br>However I would prefer non unit based unique outfits, but to each his own.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I was looking forward of getting a new figure</br>  <br>Was considering it until I saw pic related.</br>  <br> announced her as Anya's prototype <br>Wouldnt that mean Minami comes out before and not after? <br><br>I dont like how Anya is lying down, the matching will be off if ones standing and the other lying down.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why not get all the Prisma Illya scales? She is an amazing person.</br>  <br>Stop tempting me!</br>  <br>Is she great enough to cum upon?</br>  <br>Give in anon, it will be daijobu. You will have a magical time if you surround yourself with her.</br>  <br><br>Considering that one is going to come out until July 2016 at the earliest I'll get both.</br></br>  <br>Minami is already confirmed Love Laika. <br><br>Love Laika is sex, so its fine for me. I love Walking Sex and Russian Hooker.</br></br></br>  <br>Sex sux</br>  <br>This is the most fucking evilest bd bonus I've ever seen. I need it.<br><br>But it's a huge cocktease.

The figures themselves look fine, though. Any chance GSC would be willing to exchange them? I know they do replacement parts for figures, but I'm not sure what they do about damaged boxes.  <br>Mine too. There's a big blog about destroyed Snow Miku boxes on MFC, which goes into detail about why they don't replace boxes.</br>  <br>combination of Lacrosse (sport that she practices) and sex</br>  <br>Oh, I get it now<br>Thanks anon<br><br>But why Walking Sex?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Loaded question, I can't answer. I think LL is more popular, but it isn't a fair comparison because iM@S existed before the figure/merchandise boom of the late 00s.</br>  <br>I'm getting all of those, but sex still sucks.</br>  <br>So just suck it up and pay the 500 yen fee instead of paying 500+ yen on shit you don't want that'll just add to the shipping cost.</br>  <br> takane <br> OG <br>My head.</br></br></br>  <br>She's OG in my heart.<br><br>And is the new game not going to be XBOX One and PS4?<br><br>Why the fuck did Bamco make it Xbox when that shit is never alive in Japan?</br></br></br></br></br>  soon  <br>Does anyone actually think she's best girl. I bought the Nendo just to have new generations, but honestly I don't think I give a shit about her.</br>  <br>GSC could have easily made something better.<br><br>No thanks.</br></br></br>  <br> Why the fuck did Bamco make it Xbox when that shit is never alive in Japan? <br><br>No one knows, honestly. The 360 at best was selling like 10 per month or some shit like that.</br></br></br>  <br>MS and Bamco had a lifetime contract on the first game, timed exclusive for the second, then it went PS3.<br><br>They did the same for Vesperia. Honestly releasing Japanese games on the XB1 is financial suicide at this point.</br></br></br>  <br>She's shit.</br>  <br>Maybe she is not best girl, but I'm sure she is one of the best girls in this show</br>  <br><br>I expect the PS4 one to be the best selling one then. I hope it hits 100k first week.</br></br>  I can't stop buying gundams someone help me  Anyone familiar with Bandai posable figures?

They are probably just doing it after Jouichiro's small arc.  They won't skip it.  <br>It's better than the entire selection tournament and it explains why glasses dude has beef with Soma to send Giganigga after him. <br><br>It also has one of those fox type ladies with the slit eyes that I fucking love.</br></br></br>  Chapter 127 by Casanova<br><br>http://casanovascans.com/read/shoku<wbr>geki_no_soma/en/0/127/page/1<br><br>Official Twitter accounts<br><br>https://twitter.com/shokugeki_anime<wbr><br>https://twitter.com/syokugeki_off<br>https://twitter.com/tsukudayuto (author)</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>No it isn't.</br>  <br>Soma's dad is a fucking stud. I wonder if he and Gin used to fool around.</br>  <br>Tournaments are shit by definition. The only reason the Election wasn't so bad was because they managed to cook up a lot of interesting characters for it, but it's still a long-ass stalling tactic and those same characters are more fun to watch OUTSIDE the tournament proper.</br>  <br>Holy shit, is there any free will left in Ryou?</br>  <br> stalling tactic <br><br>I doubt that was the point this time, Just look at Nao and Hojo both were introduced during the tournament so we know who they are and what their specialty is when Soma is interacting with them in various arcs. To a lesser degree the same applies for Hisako to a lesser degree since we knew nothing about her before the tourney.<br><br>Yeah the latter half lasted too long but the preliminaries was great for setting up characters and situations for the future of the story.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Like I said, they managed to make it work because they focused on a lot of stuff outside the tournament proper and because the characters they introduced were all interesting. But it's still easily the worst arc overall.</br>  <br> used to <br>What do you think that "business" he had to attend to was?</br></br>  <br>Being Ryou is suffering.</br>  Soma's dad probably fucked his love interests<br><br>it's a cuck anime</br></br>   They skipped the introduction to the Autumn election <br> Megumi didn't sleep because she was worrying about being nominated so she stumbled onto the father son contest <br> She hasn't been nominated in the anime, why couldn't she sleep <br><br>BRAVO.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Interesting, is that what's required for you to self-insert?</br>  <br>More importantly, they skipped the ping pong match. <br><br>Unforgivable.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Soma's dad mere presence made every girl in the dorm wet when thinking about Soma's future potential. <br><br>The boy's pussy magnet-itude went up at least threefold from that visit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I will laugh at you when they do it two weeks from now.</br>  <br><br>It still messed up the continuity, stupid.</br></br>  <br>anon he's been with her ever since he was a little boy, He had to deal with all her quirks for a long ass time he simply broke and just went along with it.</br>  <br>whatever works for you man, if the show is more enjoyable for you with that idea then by no means go ahead</br>  Seriously though, it's fucking weird. By Skipping Sensual Karaage and the Ping Pong match, they basically made dad's visit pointless, since he served primarily to encourage soma and megoo for the tournament.  <br>Erina's going to lose her shit when she finds out not only has her superhero husbando put his penis into another woman who wasn't her, but did it so often that it produced her nemesis.</br>  So Casanova are doing the recipe omakes right? Don't know their policy on this thing.  <br>Original end incoming imminent.</br>  <br>No, we'll have a S2.</br>  <br>I don't think she stupid enough to believe that such perfect semen material was stumbling around all this time before she was born, grown, and they meet.</br>  <br>They aren't mutually exclusive, just watch Magi S1 ending.</br>  <br> nemesis <br><br>You mean the guy who she's been pretending doesn't make her wet?</br></br></br>  <br> logic from a female <br><br>You're giving her far too much credit.</br></br></br>  <br> You mean the guy who she's been pretending doesn't make her wet? <br> this projecting <br>If you can't recognize the difference between tsundere and pure contempt, I truly feel sorry for you.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not logic, it's a woman intuition.

Do you take all her chibby ranting as a serious thing ?</br></br>  <br>Get over it, sunshine, she despises him and everything he stands for.

It's literally the entire reason he threw in with Giganigga.</br>  <br><br>Can always modify that the scene works right within the flow of the anime without having to deal with the entire boring arc.</br></br>  <br>The tournament is still in the anime</br>  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA!  <br>Iit's actually a quite enjoyable arc that serves as a breather from the training and start setting up the tournament</br>  <br> waiting this long to drop <br>you must be one of those fucking casuals that i have heard about</br></br>  <br>She only wants Joichiro's cock. Only that level of perfection can be placed on her table.</br>  <br><br>It's hard not to go along with her when she makes faces like this.</br></br>  <br>I mean just look at those dead eyes.</br>  <br><br><br>Worst fucking character<br><br>Ruined Alice, since he is always where she is.</br></br></br></br></br>  It's finally over. Ending was satisfactory, but the overall show was still shit.  <br>All for a rabbit pun</br>  <br>Usagi </br>    <br><br><br>On those lines, if the originally planned Sailor V anime had been made, the exact same thing would apply.<br><br>The only reason Sailor Moon as such exists is because Toei wanted to create their own sentai maigcal girl show and took the opportunity to ride on the back of the name of Takeuchi's Sailor V when its anime never panned out. While Naoko's manga technically came first, it was never the reason for the genesis of the series proper or the success of the original show, which would have been spawned in an alternate form anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Oh god it would be such a delicious trainwreck if it had come to fruition. I would seriously pay cash to get the pilot to show up somewhere.</br>  I want to hug sleepy one-eyed sniper Hibiki.  <br>Even edgy Aoi is a miracle!</br>  <br> Symphogear GX <br> Rokko's Modern Life no Yuusha <br>I don't know VAs.</br></br></br>  <br>Look at this fucking otaku!<br><br>Where's your buddy Silvermask, huh?</br></br></br>  In which we argue about how useless Hibiki is for another 500 posts.

I mean Maria's Gungnir worked fine at the same time and that was also just a shard from the original spear.</br>  <br>DESS DESS DESS</br>  <br>I hope Tsubasa and Maria go on a cute deito now that neither of them has anything to do.</br>  <br>Dess Henshin sounds like a band name.</br>  <br> will be <br>What do you mean will be? She already fought a doll without a gear, she moved Tsubasa away from civilians and saved them due to quick thinking, she didn't get anyone hurt and she took responsibility for all her actions while looking to the future and making plans for how to fix things. Maria is fucking on point.</br></br>  <br>best way to think is to state that gungnir shattering during swan song is what killed Kanade. so we dont have to speculate.</br>  <br>What exactly will Maria be doing to spoil Tsubasa?</br>  <br>Please translate it, friends.</br>  I want to Anime-chan's beef stroganoff.  <br>Going by OP, Red has an insane amount of bloodlust</br>  <br>So we could have an army of Ichiaval users running around if we chose to ignore morality?<br><br>That'd be pretty sweet. <br><br><br>But speculation is the fun part. What-if, what could have been. All that good stuff.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SU TO RA GO NO FU</br>  <br>That or drunken adventures will suffice</br>  <br>Walk right up to her and whisper in her ear:<br> "Rorschach dies." </br></br>  <br>There's 3 entire doujins that need it.</br>  Thinking about it, I wonder what are the 3 girls with broken relics going to be doing while waiting for whatever plot related event fixes their gears.<br><br>I guess Maria can spend time with the kids since they're injured. Tsubasa can go train while pretending she's a sword and Chris watches more movies if she's not at school. Maybe spend time with Elfnein too.</br></br>  <br><br>That song was really good.</br></br>  <br>Tsubasa and Maria can take Elf9 clothes shopping while everyone else is at school.</br>  I just noticed that Elfnein actually says "Zababa" here.<br><br>Maybe this is hinting towards how DMJii will be able to use their gears without linker (something apart from Dwern Dain's legacy upgrade).<br><br>I always wondered why they say "tron" in their chant while the other linker junkies use "zilzz"</br></br></br></br>  <br>Figured she was just correctly identifying their gears, like she did Chris's.</br>  <br>More like 4 since Kohakura released one of their old doujins on pixiv</br>  <br><br>That song may have been the best thing that has happened in all three seasons of this show.</br></br>  <br>Of course it doesn't actually make sense for her to have that knowledge  unless Carol intended for her to meet them all along. </br>  <br>But that's Chris's job. Tsubasa and Maria can go spar and get Maria her ninja training.</br>  If animechan dies episode 7 I think im done with symphogear.  <br>I want Tsubasa to take Elf9 for a stroll taking her to places while riding her motorcycle.<br>And I also hope it doesn't blow up.</br></br>  <br>Her odds of making it through episode 4 aren't looking great.</br>  <br>Oh, the comment at the end was for Chris. Maria spends time with the kids, Tsubasa can train (and bring Maria along to train with now that you mention it). Chris just watching movies seemed boring so she gets the buddy time with Elf.</br>  Atelier Carol when  <br>Meant it for </br>  <br>Who are the other two Atelier's though? It always comes in a trilogy IE Meruru/Totori/Carona Lite.</br>  <br>What if Elfnein is the final boss and she's just befriending the gears as part of her plan?</br>  <br>I'll say Maria is useful when the seasons over and she hasn't spent most of the run time cry or being wishy washy.</br>  <br>It was. And this is a show with some pretty fucking amazing moments, so that says something.</br>  I'm way too fucking drunk for this thread  Quote soon  as she's dying.   <br>Gee, two and a half seasons in, you sure showed them!<br><br>Why would it even be in episode 7 anyway?</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry sport. I don't translate H-doujin for most series.</br>  <br>Nana said at a concert that she does a lot of screaming in episode 7.<br>Kaneko said that people think he crossed a line in episode 7.</br></br>  <br>I want to cover Bikki in my baking flour.</br>  <br>Translate the individual page then, give us a taste.

Gotta collect all the titty monsters.</br>  <br><br>well for starters Kanade is DEAD<br><br>second of all that was more sisterly, especially considering Kanade's little sister apparently resembled Tsubasa</br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably because it feels forced, but a lot of it is because, up until the second half of this episode, they were both on an entirely different continent.</br>  <br>It's funny because she did it in Cross Ange too.</br>  <br> that KanaDAD hair <br>No homo of course.</br></br>  <br>I really fucking wish someone would scan the design archive.</br>  <br><br>so Chris/Tsubasa/Maria poly trio?<br><br>I can get behind that</br></br></br></br>  <br>Its funnier because Nana's actually kind of flat in real life.</br>  <br>Why should being dead matter? Does the 2D/3D barrier stop you loving your waifu?</br>  <br>Ah, so Tsubasa is literally a self-insert? That's a funny thought.</br>  <br>Maria/Hibiki/Kanade poly trio. C'mon man, three girls all up on that massive spear.</br>  <br>Whose hands are these?</br>  <br>The only thing Tsubasa and Nana don't have in common is their height.</br>  <br>Tsubasa is Nana's self-insert from the very start.</br>  <br>Didn't the drawing make that obvious?</br>  <br><br>I don't really go for the waifu thing, anon</br></br>  <br>Tsubasa's still a fucking shrimp compared to me. I could knock her over.</br>  <br>Well, I can't imagine Nana being tall anyway.</br>  <br> 777 <br>Since when did you learn to post in 4chan, Nana?</br></br>  <br> 5' 0" (1.53 m) <br>Jesus, she manages to be smaller than my eldest sister.</br></br>  <br>Kanade and Tsubasa. <br><br><br>Ah, well that rhetoric backfired. Didn't know my crowd well enough it seems.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Look, I just want Tsubasa to be happy and loved.<br><br>Hard to do that in canon with a dead wife</br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder of what happens in Episode 7 for the last two seasons?</br>  <br>And yet from that small body she can produce a very powerful voice and she has more guts than a woman that is 6 feet tall.</br>  <br><br> That sly peek at 0:17 </br></br>  <br>If your waifu dies in canon, she dies in real life.</br>  <br>Just think that once Tsubasa dies she'll finally be able to reunite with her waifu in Heaven.</br>  <br>I see your point but do you think she'd be happy with Maria or Chris?<br><br>Maria is just a poor replacement for Kanade and Chris is just her lovable junior. <br><br><br>Bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>s1: Zenbu zenbu zenbu<br>s2: Hibiki finds out she has cancer</br></br>  <br>I could still probably pick her up and chuck her into a lake. Don't fuck with me, Nana Mizuki.</br>  <br> Don't fuck with me, Nana Mizuki. <br>I can pick you up and chuck you in front of a Japanese death truck. Don't fuck with Nana-chan.</br></br>  <br><br>chris challenges and snarks at her. every day would be an adventure.</br></br>  <br>Don't worry, I'm sure Nana doesn't want to fuck you anyway even if you force her to.</br>  <br>S1 was Miku Pls<br>S2 was Relic Cancer</br></br>  I still can't handle the previews only being a few hours away from the next episode.  <br><br> needing to use a truck <br> implying he wouldn't be literally torn to pieces by rabid fans </br></br></br>  <br>It would get old fast. Chris wouldn't be able to grow as a person if she has Tsubasa to rely on.</br>  <br>You can pick her up, she's small and light anyway.<br>Your only problem is the million of faggots that will feast over your dead body the moment you forcefully touch her.</br></br>  <br> So we could have an army of Ichiaval users running around if we chose to ignore morality? <br><br>No, because you need a converter to turn a relic into a Symphogear. Hence why Chris, Tsubasa and Maria are down and out despite still having their relic fragments.<br><br>I'm guessing Hibiki didn't need one because the Gungnir itself responded to her, which is also why she could override Maria's transformation.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Yeah? See how they like my FLAMETHROWER.</br></br>  Suddenly, best girl  <br><br> Throwing swords into lakes <br><br>Who are you, Sir Griflet?</br></br></br></br>  <br>This.

You CAN learn Japanese!</br></br></br>    I just read for two hours and now im listening to stuff.<br>Is there anything else I should do? I already finished reps and all of daily routine.</br>  <br>Start actually learning Japanese.</br>  Is being White a disadvantage in Japan?<br>I assume it's like the west where all the cultural enrichment is mostly contained in the big cities.<br>But I don't like big cities.</br></br>  Guys I'm obsessed with meeting a woman old enough to be my mom and becoming a ひも. <br><br><br>Disadvantaged in what? If you're looking to meet pretty young women it's a huge advantage. If you're trying to find an apartment or start a business you might be at a disadvantage.</br></br></br>  Someone posted this in the previous thread. Does anyone know where it's from?  <br>Yes. The Japanese are incredibly racist, and they purposefully ostracize anyone whom they believe may be a foreigner. Being white in Japan is to be oppressed, and the Japanese are oppressors.</br>  <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br>  For those of you that learned Japanese for a manga/LN/VN/anime, did you immediately jump into it after finishing Tae Kim and Core2k or did you start with other materials until you felt you could read fluidly?  <br>http://www.mediafire.com/view/bizq3<wbr>79k4oeig2d/fora.pdf<br><br>Here you go my freund.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>ありがとうございました!</br>  <br>Started reading Yotsuba and playing Wizardry Summoner with 500 words into 2k, before finishing tae kim, didn't have much problems with them. <br>Problems with the language, I mean, Wizardry is hard as fuck to beat.<br><br>I don't see how it's even possible to become able to read fluidly without spending some time reading first.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this how it feels to be a nigger going to Europe?</br>  <br>I haven't finished reading Tae Kim and I'm only about 700 cards into my anki deck yet I'm slowly reading an  otome game . Reading at this low level can become time-consuming for sure. There's plenty of vocab I don't know but I think the real frustrating part is my lack of grammar knowledge. I don't believe in waiting to read though. Even if it's only a little bit of reading a day, seeing kanji and vocab outside of anki does better for my memory than spending an additional hour with it.</br>  みんな、突然だけど<br>うんこが出たんだぞ</br>  <br>乙</br>  <br>How many lines are you reading a day?</br>  <br>This is what we call true shitto posutingu</br>  What does エッチそうだと噂されている mean when talking about a person?  Is it a good idea to learn Japanese in university? Anyone of you guys have a Japanese class?  <br><br>The prevailing opinion is that they go far too slow</br></br>  <br> From what I'm hearing, he seems like a perverted individual </br>  <br>Learning in class usually goes at the same pace the stupidest/laziest person can go, so unless the stupidest student is you it's a bad idea.</br>  <br>I was looking at some of the modules in a University near me and what they teach in a full semester you could learn much quicker by yourself. Advantage is having a wide variety of people to practice with and lots of feedback though.</br>  <br>What people have already said plus the fact that first semester Japanese classes are full of insufferable weeaboos.</br>  <br> what they teach in a full semester you could learn much quicker by yourself <br> quicker by yourself <br>That is, if you're motivated enough.<br><br>You can learn all you want by yourself, but you need to means of retaining what is self-taught.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm going to add to this question<br><br>I've been studying for a year and once I get my two year would majoring in Japanese be a good idea?</br></br></br>  <br>It's inconsistent, but usually between 50 and 200 lines. I space them throughout the day because otherwise it quickly becomes mentally exhausting.</br>  <br>What are you talking about?<br>How are the means to retain something that was self taught different than the means to retain something taught in class?</br></br>  Holy fuck VNR is a piece of shit. Why can't ITH hook light games?  <br> 200 lines <br>That's nothing. Do you look up every unfamiliar word or something? Consider reading manga with furigana until you know enough kanji to read VNs without constantly looking shit up, improves reading without putting much strain on you.</br></br>  <br>Is majoring in drama a good idea?</br>  <br>Its a good way to start off or for getting some practice with speaking/writing. If you need language credits or electives then it might be a good idea since its time you can dedicate to learning Japanese instead of some other thing. The pace will mostly depend on how many class hours there are in a week.</br>  <br>Not him, but is reading something  super interesting with furigana like To Love-Ru  as a first manga a good idea? Or are there any simple manga that don't have much slang/abbreviations?</br>  <br>Every manga has slang/abbreviations but there really aren't that many of them and they are pretty intuitive if you know your Tae Kim.</br>  <br>It isn't even the kanji. There are probably two per line on average that I don't recognize. When I don't recognize them, image recognition can pull them up in a second. What I struggle with wrapping my head around is grammar. <br><br>Thanks, though. I will take your advice and read some manga for the next few days and see if that suits me better.</br></br></br>  <br>Good idea for what? <br>If you expect your major to impress 3DPD girls, make your parents proud and make you rich then nope.<br><br><br>Most shonen jump manga is pretty simple, but people recommend よつばと！as a first for a reason.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What I struggle with wrapping my head around is grammar.  <br>Are you struggling with understanding the meaning of sentences? Or just understanding why X structure was used and other more detailed things?<br><br>Because if it's the latter, you should really just loosen up and focus on reading more. Nothing good will come from spending hours trying to figure out why the moe girl sticks なのよねです at the end of every sentences.</br></br></br></br>  is there any hope for people who read 3 lines a day?  <br>No.</br>  <br>why?</br>  <br>It's a little of both. I said earlier that I haven't finished reading Tae Kim and I know that's a big part of why I struggle with grammar. However, I don't feel like I'm doing enough if I don't read a little. I don't think I'll reap any real benefits by speed-reading Tae Kim and I already know what my anki limits are, so after I've met my daily goals for those I feel like I should be doing something else.</br>  <br>The university near me teaches Genki practically throughout the whole Japanese course.</br>  <br>You can try to hope that reincarnation exists and you'll be reborn as a Japanese girl in your next life. But even then you'll have to read more than 3 lines a day as a Japanese girl.</br>  N5 - beginner<br>N4 - intermediate<br>N3 - advanced, but not quite fluent<br>N2 - fluent<br>N1 - beyond fluent</br></br></br></br>  <br>The only hope is that you stop being someone who reads 3 lines a day.</br>  Where do I go download raws for manga that aren't in the CoR?<br>I assume there isn't any big site that hosts everything like we have for translations</br>  <br>how many should i read then?</br>  <br><br>Uh... N1 is more like "almost fluent." So your whole chart is fucked up.</br></br>  <br>No.<br>I've passed N1 years ago, learned a lot since then, and I don't consider myself anywhere near fluent.</br></br>  <br>Even anime have more than 200 lines</br>  Are there situations where the imperfective forms of verbs are used like nouns?  <br>That's because you learned autistically and didn't talk to anyone. Normal people are fluent by the time they reach N2</br>  <br><br>Nyaa? http://raw-zip.com/? http://raw.senmanga.com/? Just google whatever you're looking for and see what you can find.</br></br>  <br>so should i just read 200 lines per day?</br>  <br><br>Just stop. Even the JLPT considers N1 "near fluent."</br></br>  <br> Even the JLPT considers N1 "near fluent." <br>Just making stuff up now, eh?</br></br>  <br>I guess if you could actually speak at N1 level you could consider yourself somewhat fluent. Of course just passing the test means nothing.<br>N2 is a joke though.</br></br>  <br>Did that guy post that here?<br>What a dumbass.</br></br>  <br><br>How's the weather on Mt. Stupid? <br><br>Must be nice this time of year. Although the weather's always nice when you're 2 months into learning Japanese, since it's always summer at that point.<br><br><br><br>No, sadly.

Last thing i would want is japanese getting mainstream.</br>  how do i stop worrying about everything in a sentence and feel it?    <br><br>Actually learn Japanese instead of just learning vocab on anki.</br></br>    <br>why?<br><br><br>but i only learned all grammar though</br></br></br></br>  <br>Try doing more Anki then.

He's fluent, too.<br><br>Fluency isn't the point where you're on par with an educated adult. It's the point where you can express yourself in a conversation freely and coherently. This means that if you don't know the word, you can still describe the concept, or understand the concept when it's described to you.<br><br>6K words is probably just about the breaking point, assuming that they're the right 6K.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Yes. What most people refer to as "fluency" is actually called "proficiency".</br>  <br>Get lazy. Looking shit up is such a pain I never do it, unless I see an unfamiliar kanji.</br>  <br> That poster gave you very good advice, how about you listen to it? <br>Not him but how?

Scots are anglo as well and use flaps and trills in addition to the approximant. There's also variation in which approximant it is (retroflex vs alveolar vs postalveolar).</br></br>  <br><br>They speak that way because of their Scottish accent.

Piggy piggy ohio arimas. <br><br>Then you're not going to get any bad habits that a kid doesn't get either.<br><br>Matter of fact is that looking up everything you don't understand is going to waste time. It's more effective to continue and only acquire the things you barely understand (as opposed to not understand at all). There's no harm in studying grammar separately, but looking up things you don't understand while you're reading cuts into your reading time, and consuming things that you barely understand is how language learning works.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Oh wait, your mind isn't as malleable as a kid's anymore. <br>Yeah, it's even better because kids are dumb, lack experience and can't read.</br></br>  <br><br>Oh my, piggy jiggy jig.</br></br>  <br>Actually, language is acquired by consuming things that you pretty much understand. There can only be a few missing parts; otherwise, you can't infer anything, and it might as well be gibberish, so if there's too little content for you to be able to infer, then you've got to be looking things up.</br>  <br><br>What the other anon said.<br><br>In your native tongue, you've been building up massive amounts of knowledge and intuition since you came out of the womb. That's why you don't need a dictionary for those ten words in the novel that you don't recognize. You know enough about the language already to fully understand from context.<br><br>Hell, even in your own language, if you're entering something completely unfamiliar (for example, a scientific study in a field that you know nothing about), you might need a dictionary open if you don't want the author's writings to be half gibberish.<br><br>Until you've gained this knowledge base that enables intuition in the language for Japanese, it's stupid to not look up each and every word that you don't know.<br><br>Thankfully, we have plenty of tools that make looking up Japanese words pretty easy. Text hookers, rikai, kanjitomo, etc. And failing that, we still have traditional dictionaries and means to draw the kanji or search by radical.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Droidfags do you use the hiragana numpad or the QWERTY keyboard?  <br> In your native tongue, you've been building up massive amounts of knowledge and intuition since you came out of the womb. <br>That intuition doesn't just vanish when you read something in another language, though, and you can use most of it to figure things out. Of course with Japanese things are a bit harder and you have to know your kanji, but once you know them you need a dictionary even less since they give you even more hints about the meaning of the word. <br>If you just look up every unfamiliar word you encounter you wouldn't get much reading, and forget most of the words you looked up right away.</br></br></br>  I was doing RTK, and I got to 説, which Heisig marked as "explanation". But the anki deck I'm using shows 釈 as "explanation. I checked and 釈 does mean explanation, and 説 means opinon/theoryrumor. Heisig calls 釈 "interpretation" later in the book. <br>Should study the definitions as they are in RTK or should I change something?</br>  <br>That's why you should drop Heisig earlier on.</br>    <br> stories are worthless shit <br> only teaches you the meaning, not even how to fucking read the kanji <br> and the meanings are wrong <br> mfw people actually went through the entirety of this book <br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Should study the definitions as they are in RTK or should I change something? <br>The goal is learning the idea behind the kanji, not the english word that represents that idea.<br>It's easier to tie meanings to readings, though, shame RTK doesn't do that,</br></br></br>    <br> definitions <br> in RTK <br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>But meanings don't tie to readings, radicals do.</br>  <br> But meanings don't tie to readings <br>Who said that? In my head I can tie whatever the fuck I want.</br></br>  <br>Explanation can be a valid idea/meaning associated with 説. See 説明</br>  <br><br>Look up some of the words they are in to get a feel for them. 解説 and 解釈 might be good since they share a Kanji. 説明 and 演説 are also key words. That said if you don't know those Kanji/words this gets a hell of a lot harder, which I don't really have a solution for. It's hellish at the start.<br><br>The closest to explain I can think of for 釈 is 釈明. Much like "explain how this works" and "explain your conduct", they're different kinds of "explain".<br><br>Sorry if I get anything wrong/seem like I'm just dumping shit on you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's unnatural as helll but if it helps you remember the kanji, be my guest.</br>  <br><br>Sure, it does transfer to some degree. You don't lose all human communication skills. That's probably around half of why you learn so much quicker as an adult.<br><br>However, a large piece of this intuition comes from a deep understanding of the grammar and knowing all of the nuances of each of the other words around the unknown word. When you first begin studying a new language, the language will be in a haze.<br><br> Huh? That doesn't match what I was expecting at all. <br> What is this even supposed to be? <br> Did I just understand that right? <br> Is this a slurring of a word that I don't know? <br> Is this some kind of weird phrase? <br><br>Your knowledge of human communication gets the cogs turning, but it's not enough to compensate for a poor base in the hard skills (such as vocabulary) of the language. This haze continues to exist for a long time.<br><br>Looking up the words makes it exponentially quicker to grasp vocabulary. The sooner you get your vocabulary up to snuff, the sooner you can make it easier to access, and subsequently, the sooner you can remove this haze in more cases than not. This goes double if you're at a point where looking things up would slow you down significantly.<br><br>Also, you mentioned kids learning the language earlier. Do you honestly not remember the days of "What's a 'radio mast', dad?", "What's an 'ICU'?", "What's a 'manhole'?" Also, have you never seen kids ask such questions? Kids are also always looking to greater sources of knowledge to explain the language to them. Actually, this behavior doesn't even completely stop as adults, as in the example of science studies that I mentioned before.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 釈明 <br>"justify", "vindicate", "elucidate"</br></br>  <br><br> 釈明 <br>"(an) explanation", "(an) apology (わび)", (a) vindication (弁明)"<br><br>Well, yeah.</br></br></br></br></br>  I understand the conversation but I'm having trouble figuring out what the 帰ろっか、てくー、and ないっけー　are doing in this panel.

Gives you a lot of freedom in terms of career between marketing/diplomacy/political but more importantly translating/interpreting (job opportunity, I think the most important part of a degree). It will be useful even if you don't want to work in Japanese and it is just an informative degree.

Why hasn't anyone started fighting yet? <br>Why was this script green lighted?<br>Why have they almost copied BOG word for word up until this point?<br><br>It stinks</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>most people remember these parts about DBZ: <br><br>what they don't remember is the fucking retarded side characters, awkward silences, and general tomfoolery</br></br></br></br>  No episode next week because Fuji TV being a shit.  <br>I'm aware, but it's still the dumbest thing ever.</br>  The Ginyu Force sure got high ratings.  <br>can source?</br>  They are third years now, but the guy Kurumi liked was her sempai, so he was at least one year older. Yet he turned into a zombie while being in the school.<br><br>Which means it's been at least 1 year since the zombie outbreak.</br></br>  <br><br>That's strange. I always remember it like that.<br>Didn't they talk about it in one chapter where they told Yuki to hold back a year so that they can graduate together?<br><br>Must be because I marathoned it in a hurry.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuki and Miki had that talk as a joke about Yuki's progress. Miki was specifically introduced in her second year. And then there was a graduation ceremony for the three 3rd years.</br>  <br>School Days?</br>  <br>Alright then. Sorry. Fuck my rotten brain.</br>  Speaking of grades, wouldn't their seifuku imply that Yuki is the only one of a different grade than the other three?  Where were you when sensei got BTFO and is going to murder all the rival  <br>Who?</br>  <br>who?</br>  The loli already gave up on Keita right?  The sisters were the tutorial level: teaching him how not to jizz in his pants the first time he touches a bare breast. Piss-chan and Sensei are the final boss. He only needs to not let his dick lead him around in order to win. Like that's going to happen though.  <br> NBR shit <br><br>nah fuck that route, only benefit is to see Rika's scar</br></br></br>  Meanwhile on bizarro /a/  <br>I am glad sad panda is dying, it was as shitty service. Fakku is great</br>  Oh man, this new protagonist of Pokemon is great. Glad to see the anime adaption of the manga is going strong too!  Gurren Lagann, not so bad.  Why is Touma so depraved? Does he even have a concept of morality?  <br>Kirino best girl</br></blockquote>]
