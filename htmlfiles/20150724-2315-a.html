[ Where were you when this actually turned out  good?   <br>Ep 2 out already?</br>  <br>Up to episode 3 now.</br>  <br>probably watching anime</br>  So is Near here a woman?<br>Near 's actress is a woman and the synopsis said that Near was a dangerous beauty</br>  <br>Yeah, Near's a girl in this. Melo is a puppet, alternate personality of hers as well. Melo being a puppet is the only real annoying thing in this that has persisted so far.</br>   Near is here <br><br>So L is confirmed to die?</br></br>  <br>Are we sure about that?<br>Seems kinda weird to change something that big <br>So far they've only changed small things like Raye Penbar's name and stuff</br></br></br>  Stop lying<br>Is episode 3 good or something?</br>  <br>But L and Near are white.</br>  <br>Episode 2 was an improvement and episode 3 made some changes that actually made it intense to do with Raye:<br><br> &gt;Light lures him into a cafe without cameras to do that FBI killing part like the anime<br> L lets the FBI die because he wants to discover how Kira is doing it <br> Raye writes all of the names except his own <br> Light tells him to go to this deserted warehouse <br> Light goes to collect the pages, but Raye was faking dead <br> Has him at gunpoint and was going to kill him <br> Misa found out he was Kira at the concert using her eyes and saves him <br> Light barely gets away from his dad and another police officer checking to see if Raye was dead(tracking device on his phone) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br>  <br>I hope not.<br>In fact, if L dies, I'll actually watch it all.</br></br>  <br>The L wank needs to stop. It's been mentioned before, but there's no point if things are so skewed in his favor and Light is so dumb to the point where Misa has to save him</br>  Has Naomi appeared within the series yet? I'm curious to see how fucked she gets considering she's the Death Note whipping bitch.  <br>No, Instead Raye Penbar has a white American fiance <br>Though there's a new character in the L Investigation crew and it's a girl</br></br>  <br>They merged her plot into Raye's. Raye has a fiance Light sees on a photo, but it's some random white girl called Cathy Campbell.</br>  <br>There is no Naomi, Raye's gf is a white girl</br>   L is more attractive than Light and has professionally done hair   <br><br><br><br>Shit. Well that's a disappointment. Thanks you three very prompt and well organized anons.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Don't worry though, they did do it well though. I was pleased with how they handled Raye.<br><br> Thank you, anon. </br></br></br>  <br>It bothers me because L is the one who's into idols shit, not light.</br>  <br>It bothers me that L is so arrogant and foppish instead of a weird autistic manchild</br>  <br>It's J-Drama, they're setting it up for a Light x Misa romance plot most likely.</br>  <br>I want a L x Misa plot</br>  <br>It wasn't</br>  <br> near has black eye brows </br>  Why watch it if they aren't gonna even get rid of Near?  <br>I get Near has a puppet (s)he calls Mello that represents a different side of thinking, but I hope that's not all Mello is. What would be the point? I hope maybe Mello is a real kid in this and died or is absent for some other reason and this is Near's way of making up for it. But sadly they probably really have merged Near and Mello into one.</br>  Is it on nyaa?    Misa was the worst character in the original series.  What's the reason for they rewrite the whole thing?<br><br>Does the original death note author even approved this?</br></br>  No really, please tell what has made it good because the first episode was fucking awful  Mello Puppet is a fucking waking nightmare.  <br>Drama will go all the way to the end, with L dying and Near taking over</br>  <br><br><br>If you want to discuss Death Note on /a/ post the manga or anime, faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>You didn't even read all of the rules faggot.</br>  <br>Because why not?<br><br><br>Oooooooh fuck no. If I have to constantly see Light Novel bullshit around here, we can talk about a live action adaptation of a manga series.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good that they changed them. They made the anime shitty when they were introduced</br>  <br> tfw I thought Raye   actually died <br><br>This show is surprisingly good</br></br></br>  <br>L looks like Kai from EXO and Raito looks like Jaejoong from TVXQ<br>N looks like a girl?</br></br>  <br>is a girl</br>  <br>another kpopfag on /a/?</br>  <br>rekt</br>  <br><br/></br>  Oh my fuck.<br>You faggots reminded me that I still didn't start episode 1 and I was blown away.<br>I didn't expect it to be almost movie-length AND better than the actual movies.<br>I just assumed it was going to be shit because it's an adaptation of an adaptation. I never even considered that Japan could actually into live action.<br>Makes me think maybe I've been doing it wrong by skipping over things like Kamen Rider too.<br><br>Also what the fuck is up with that Mello doll? And why does Near sound like a grill?<br><br>Anyway this is a rare occasion where I can actually get into 3D shit. Is every episode as long as the first?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Episode 2 and 3 are 40-50 minutes</br>  <br>Sorry I just couldn't help it.</br>  <br> skipping over things like Kamen Rider too <br>What's wrong with you? Forget Death Note go watch Kamen Rider now</br></br>   live action series <br>Why would you torment yourself like that?</br>  <br>Because some are fun</br>  <br>I really love this series. I wasn't expecting it to actually be good.</br>  <br>How old is this Light supposed to be? He looks like he is in his 30s</br>  <br> they whole cast is ridiculously attractive <br>Dropped</br></br>  Ok, I think I might check out this series.<br>What subs should I use?</br>   tfw you're enjoying a live action Death Note adaption <br>Who would have thought.</br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #1<br><br>Remember to relax and take it easy.</br></br>  Requesting reimu in a bloody mess and presenting the waifu of your choosing's liver to the viewer after having a yandere relapse.  good luck  I would like to request a drawing of Mai Natsume.

It may be overrated, but it is far from the regular overrated trash anime. The story was well executed, it didn't contain any of the awful anime clichés. The main reason why it seems to be hated so much on /a/ is cause of its eginess.  <br>We don't really have weebs in Romania, so I can't tell, but back in my school days people were all over Naruto.</br>  <br> The story was well executed <br> you killed my siblings, but I forgive you <br> well executed </br></br></br>  <br>That was 3 minutes ending scene</br>  <br><br><br>Edgy stuff simply makes them think they are full.<br><br>The key is to make them blindingly uncomfortable.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a mostly naked autistic girl running around mweeing and then switching to evil and ripping heads off. It's shite.</br>  <br> Cheap manipulative garbage. <br><br>I know. I mean, EL is a mediocre and pretentious show, but it has its moments of entertainment value if you are willing to accept that the whole thing is stupid and switch your brain off. So while it's definitely overrated by newfags, it isn't so greatly over-praised that it matters in general.<br><br>Clannad on the other hand is the biggest complex of bizarrity I've seen hailed as a masterpiece by anime fans at large. You'd think it would be shit on and considered a sentimental newb trap for all the same reasons Lied is, but for whatever reason only the most self serious people do so and most of the affection it gets seems genuine.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  it didn't contain any of the awful anime cliché </br>  <br>The LRD popsicle is good for that.</br>  Fairy tail maybe.

My only reason to get the Sorceress would be that is based on Oda's art, but since they decided to make it a complete bitch to pre-order and after watching the anime all my hype so to speak just dropped completely.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  penis  <br>Not really, just nishi's old as fuck fetish.</br>  <br> tfw I don't either </br>  <br>If it doesn't have pubes, I'm not buying.</br>  <br><br>I'll take your word for it brothers/sisters.</br></br>  That turban better be removable.  <br>Where is James?<br> Implying I care enough to learn his Jap name </br></br>  <br>He's still in these threads unfortunately.</br>  <br>It's Jamesu-kun.</br>  <br> Not Juan-kun </br>  Out of nowhere we finally get preorders open for Bruce Lee figma.<br>http://www.amiami.com/top/detail/de<wbr>tail?gcode=FIGURE-012864&amp;page=top<br><br> I wonder if this has anything to do with Bandai announcing an SH Figuarts version of him coming soon?

You can keep that card.</br></br>  Anyone just consider stopping buying figures minus their waifu and just buying other merchandise? I feel like one get's to a point where they have too many figures to enjoy them all.    <br>I this going to be a figure? I want it.</br>  <br>MUST BUY<br> So that my Haruna can squeeze her to death </br></br>  <br>Fuck off retard</br>  <br>Celebrities are the easiest things to search for on Google.</br>  <br>I am pretty sure that one was a GK.

All I ever see is people complaining about it.</br>  <br><br>I see the STD/DX version, release date and scale, but not a price.</br></br>  <br>People with shit taste.</br>  <br>More idols than my wallet would like probably</br>  <br>Extra torso also most probably limited+exclusive, do you want to guess the price?</br>  <br>It was shit.</br>   otakumode still hasn't restocked the mushishi art book <br>Fucking cunts.</br>  Today is a good day.  So do you guys think this is all we'll be getting to see monmusu related besides maybe the Miia daki?<br>I hope we see a scale or something</br>  <br>STD is the worst abbreviation they could've used.</br>  <br>I am sure there will at least be announcements at wonfes.</br>  <br>that's why you should buy the DX one.</br>  <br>She looks terrible in that picture. Mostly because of the paint.</br>  <br><br>She's probably going to be as much as the Sorceress, meaning I'll pass.

Hopefully we get better photograph soon.</br>  <br>I've always had fantasies of this being a good Miia scale<br>her tail could be the base</br></br>  <br><br>That works. And the one with Cerea has her in a sitting pose as well.</br></br>  <br>Hunter a best.</br>  <br>We saw the sculpt around four months ago. Seems like a fairly standard time schedule to me.

I probably won't order from GSC's site, would rather jew off $15</br>  <br>Figure name?</br>  <br>it's in the picture.</br>  <br>I wonder who is more disappointed in you. Me, or your parents.</br>  <br>Hunter from Bikini Warriors</br>  <br>Pre-ordered. Maybe I'll watch the show eventually but either way that expression does it for me.</br>  <br>Haven't seen the show nor have I ever buyfagged but god damn that is cute. I want it.</br>  <br>Get her.</br>  <br> it <br>get lost, normie</br></br>  <br>Superior version.</br>  <br><br>Pretty much the same here, the expression and the surprisingly cheap price is making me want it. Will wait till after Wonfest to order her though.</br></br>  <br>My bad. I guess it just happened since I haven't seen the show.</br>    <br>Remember everyone, these kind of people vote, breed, and breathe the same air that we do.</br>  <br><br><br><br>It honestly isn't. At all.</br></br></br></br>  How come no one says "Madokashit"? Is Madoka universally accepted here?  <br>I haven't seen much Madokashit being posted recently.</br>  <br>It's at least better than fate/boats/sins/most other shitty mainstream shows</br>  <br>I can't even remember what the last Madoka fig was.<br><br>Psycho yukata Madoka?</br></br></br>  <br>Maiko Mami came out last month. Sayaka and Kyouko are due out in November.<br><br>There have also been 3 Akuma Homuras in the last 6 months.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know how to describe Madoka fans more than pleb, shit taste, meme, etc. Mostly just stupid. Boring. Uninteresting.<br><br>Like bugs being drawn to a light source at night. Endlessly bumping into it like a moron.</br></br></br>   http://myfigurecollection.net/item<wbr>/330951</wbr> <br><br>So it's finally happening.</br></br>  <br>Cool, I just started playing Muramasa the other day.</br>  http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>330952<br><br>Alter is making more idols too.

He is a faggot and I don't even like him but I need to complete my collection.</br>      <br><br>Mother of god<br><br>I can't believe it's happening, going to preorder on amiami as soon as she's available.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And so begins the WonFes hype</br>  <br>"Do I fit in yet guys, please let me know if I fit in"</br>  <br>Another Ignis scale?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  I really want this wall scroll.  <br>would murder for rachnee in her hammock.</br>  <br>post a better angle</br>  <br>Does she even have a tail?</br>  <br>Because they only ever put her in fucking swimsuits for her scales</br>  <br>I hope they make this pose and not the same pose GK has. This is a lot cuter.</br>  <br>Not likely</br>  <br>Depends on HLJ's discount. Not really a fan of GSC's random charging either.</br>  I want the full art for that swimsuit Satan.  <br>Swimsuit is guaranteed seller. Anything else could bomb.</br>  <br><br>God, I'm so fucking sick of swimsuit figures.</br></br>  Skytube.    <br>Stirrups are hot.</br>    <br>I want the full art of everything, especially of fluffy Belphegor.</br>  <br>I watched the show, hated it, but still pre-ordered her. The show might be shit, but I liked her. She's miles better than the other girl.</br>  <br>she looks really cute in that picture. I should reconsider picking up her scale.</br>  <br>What's with all the pokemon merch lately</br>  <br>fuck.</br>  <br>20th anniv</br>  <br>It's not that great a game. The character designs are the best part.</br>  <br>It's a shit overhyped game, the figs are fine though</br>  <br><br>I dunno, I like it.</br></br>  Anyone else going to wonfes on sunday?<br>Any veterans have advice?<br>I'm salty i can't make it to comicon but this seems like the next best thing.</br></br>  <br>Have fun. Keep hydrated.</br>  <br>Unless you're a GK buyer, Wonfest is more of a one and done type of thing. Since everything else good is already sold out by the time you get to the front of the line.<br> <br>Figure out which line you're going to wait in before Saturday night.</br></br></br>  <br>Well fuck, I'll buy 3 of that.</br>  Ultra pleb here. Since AmiAmi specifies yen only, if I use an American debut card will the currency automatically translate and the transaction go through with no problems?  <br>A newfag to this whole buyfag business.<br>How much is the price difference for shit in Japan and otherwise? I know it must differ depending on many factors, but the question is how often and how much? Just thought that I can buy shit here for lower prices and send it to anons, so I came here with questions.<br><br>I know that I don't make any sense, I'm sleepy, so yes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Have faith in Crabman it's all we can do for now.</br>  shit.  <br> No visible pubic hair <br><br>Not interested</br></br></br>  <br>didn't you notice her tiny head?</br>  <br>I noticed that there's no pubes. <br>That's all that matters on a fig.</br></br>  <br>Which one is this? she's beautiful</br>  <br>headswap?</br>   that Jessie <br><br>Instabuy.</br></br>  <br>How can a figure have a flabby ass, but no ass at the same time?<br><br>It defies logic.</br></br></br>  <br>Usually yes.<br><br>You should also be aware of what % your card charges on foreign currency exchanges. Some banks might find a foreign transaction to be suspicious and block it. In that case you will have to get in contact with them.

I did it for Anzu.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You might need some lube.</br>  <br> My only reason to get the Sorceress would be that is based on Oda's art, <br>Mage was Saitom, Oda did Dark Elf</br></br>  Hey look, more kekkai sensen merchandise. I wonder whether ther will be any proper scales or super deformed announced at wonfes.<br><br><br>I am pretty sure when he said sorceress he was referring to Dark Elf, not mage.</br></br></br>  <br>Those 30 seconds she had sure were great.</br>  <br>Which 30 seconds?<br>She appeared more than that</br></br>  I want to  live off of  Anzu's  royalties.       <br>details? <br>As far as i know this is the only kongou from arpeggio.</br></br>  <br>FAKE NEET<br>FAKE LOLI<br>FAKE IDOL</br></br></br>  <br>Really cute, though.</br>  <br><br>Looks weird TBH</br></br>  <br>Just like all idols and celebrities.</br>  <br>Did they really post this with such tiny text?</br>  <br> No pubes </br>  Hey, anons.

I'm thinking of getting into im@s, will I have to buy an xbox and play through the games before watching the anime?  I'm half expecting responses to be la guia </br>  What are the chances of seeing/hearing anything about pic related (or I guess any of the Hibikes)? I want my PVC euphonium.  <br>With all the circles posting the garage kits they will be bringing and the major manufactures leaking out teasers it is already sort of underway.</br>  <br>Alter when?

Take especially care of the Kotomi figure I stopped caring about, she's in dire need of a peg repair.</br>  <br>They are both trash.

Today is really busy.  <br><br>360 release is the main original game, introducing Miki (arcade version actually starred Haruka).<br><br>It has fleshed out full routes of all idols but starts you off with only one idol. You have to work your way through multiple playthroughs in order to create duos and trios, as well as collecting accessories (presents from fan letters) which "randomly" appear after every evening.<br><br>L4U is a fandisc (basically Taiko) which skips out the grind of getting 3 idols + favorite song + all accessories in the original game. Also has a ton of DLC, but unlike the original game, the DLC in L4U has no attributes/influence on the game itself. It's purely cosmetic.<br><br>2 is set +1 year in a different timeline; anime is an adaptation of it. Forces you into choosing 3 idols. Also, the president's voice actor is new, because the original game's president's voice actor died (irl), as well as Yukiho, who has a new seiyuu. 2 has fleshed out routes and has a linear path, expects multiple playthroughs much like the first. Generally not as liked as much as the first.<br><br>2 introduces Takane and Hibiki, which are also in the PSP releases, which are basically just rhythm games. Also, the PSP Shiny Festa games were released in iOS, in English I believe. I didn't bother so no idea if it's any good.<br><br>OFA is more of a streamlined, easier version of the former games.but expects the player to have played the former releases beforehand. Has a levelling system.<br><br>There's also an iM@S in the works for PS4.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br><br><br><br>Seems as though people  donut  want this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>getting tired of this cunt</br>  <br>I just want a fucking Ononoki</br>    <br> boring fujotoy gets scale <br>Good Kekkai Sensen figures never.</br></br>  I think I grew another dick.    <br>Maybe Alter will do others too if Leo sells well.</br>  has anyone made WF bingo cards yet? those always amused me.  <br>Oh shit thanks anon!

You would need to import a Japanese 360 if you want to play them (1 + L4U). However, I think it's worth it because 1) the prices of Japanese 360 units has dropped significantly, someone on eBay was selling them for $60 a little while ago and 2) there's a pretty nice array of exclusives out there.<br><br>2 is also on 360, so you wouldn't need a PS3 for it, unless you really wanted to play OFA or G4U (the gravure photoshoot games bundled with the anime blurays). Also, I realize this is really minor, but since I own 2 for both 360 and PS3, I can say that the 360 version is slightly visually superior (and the green/blue/red notes correspond with the controller, unlike PS3). <br><br>If you decide to look into PS3, all the G4U volumes are on JP PSN digitally for cheap along with 2 and OFA itself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mr.Color <br>Are figure like nendos hand painted? <br>I sincerely have no idea how figures are painted.</br></br></br>  <br>Can't wait to place her in yandere row next to Reimu and Madoka.</br>  time to get scolded<br>http://hobby.dengeki.com/news/84718<wbr>/</wbr></br>  <br> headless guitar <br>Disgusting.

Still finished watching it, but heck it's just cute girls doing predictable idol things.</br></br>  <br>I think you can just mod or unlock a 360 or something if you don't mind no online.</br>  Arpeggio hype still going strong in Nipponland?  <br>That mouth is awful.</br>  <br>2nd movie is still in the pipeline</br>  <br> Wish I can watch it uncut. <br> Islamic law, cut out bikini parts in 1st movie </br></br>  <br>I had that question and went with Love Live! for no male characters and yuri, it was decent, I don't regret it.</br>    <br>If they find your collection, will you get beheaded?</br>  <br>The first 15 pages are double sided and are a variety of ttgl, p&amp;s and idol stuff. <br><br>Chapter 1 makes up the bulk of the book and is in full color.<br>Up to page 53 is idolm@ster. Gurren Laggan carries on until page 107. Panty and stocking continues on until page 119. From there it is an assortment of those three and some other things such as groovy magic until page 146.<br><br>Chapter 2 is character designs.<br><br>Chapter 4 has kill la kill.<br><br>Chapter 5 is nice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The hand there made me think this was a furry figure.</br>    <br>Ranka Lee by Koto.

Thanks.</br></br>  <br> simpsons <br>i feel bad for celty</br></br>  <br>How popular is Wixoss in Japan? That 20k price tag is killing me. Is there a chance in hell that she would bin? Even a little? Or are we seeing another case of Yamato here?</br>  <br> the Simpsons <br>go back to Reddit, faggot.</br></br>  <br>You're absolutely right. But I don't really have wall space in my apt for a showcase. And I don't really have the money to buy one.</br>  <br>Forgot image</br>  <br>Idolmaster is the better show, but I guess if you want in on "idol animu", Love Live might be what you are looking for.  It's utter garbage. </br>  <br>It's a gsc exclusive. There's no way it'll bin</br>  <br>How dare you, to have simpsons crap next to Celty, please leave and never come back again.</br>  <br>It's a card game popular enough to get two seasons, Tama is exclusive and she's the only figure of the series.</br>  <br>Taking a closer look it looks to all be covers from BDs, CDs or magazines such as newtype and febri. The only thing that might be new is pic related.</br>  <br><br>So another case of Yamato then. Fuck.</br></br>  <br>Nah those aren't new. Thanks for checking, though.</br>  <br>Looks like a dumber miku</br>  <br>You don't deserve to have her.</br>  <br><br>Reminds me of this.</br></br>  <br> being surprised that a character that was retarded in the anime looks retarded as a figure </br>  <br>You still have to cross the border again dumbfuck.</br>  I wish there was a good Palutena scale.  <br>Especially shit past 8th season.</br>  <br>I don't play the game nor did I watch the series. Why does she have white hair there when she has green hair here?</br>  <br> exclusive <br>Are you kidding me? So long, Tama, I like you but not enough to sell a kidney for you.</br></br>    <br>dat chin, still good for 6,6k</br>  <br>LL is better if you want light heart CGDCT show. I watched it out of curiosity after seeing all the im@sfags' buttmads and I enjoyed it more than idolm@ster. It also have tons of better figs so definitely good for collection purpose.</br>  <br>IM@&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;LL</br>  <br>LL shit is going to bin hard in the long term, you better don't buy that crap.</br>  <br>Where are you basing the assumption from? Honest question here.</br>  <br>no delay , she will be released on the 28th July</br>  <br><br>Season 6 was pretty weird.</br></br>  <br>I don't think they're the same character. I think tama was based on tamayoruhime, although a more dedicated wixossfag would have to verify that. tfw no iona yuki/chorizo scale ;_; </br>  <br>I guess This is the Hong Kong anime convention</br>  <br><br>Details are a little fuzzy,  but I think that's Tama and Yuki combined or something. </br></br>  <br><br>Stop infecting another thread with your autistic hate. Love Live is fine so as idolm@ster.</br></br>  <br>The LRIGs have different grow paths. Here  Tama is level 1,here  she is level 4</br>  <br>Shit, that was fast. Maybe we'll get to see Dark Dragoon Forte soon.</br>  When does BS11 air it?  <br> Naked nendo of raiden <br> Not one of naked snake </br></br>  Why did she send such a lewd card to shinji, he's like 14 right?  <br> Why did she send such a lewd card to shinji, he's like 14 right? <br>She's massively immature and inappropriate.</br></br>  Because of her self esteem and daddy issues.<br><br>C'mon, you didn't notice a running theme in the series of people having problems, handling them in all the wrong ways, and thus ending up even deeper in the shit? Yeha, that's Anno telling his countrymen "See this shit? We gotta stop doing this."</br></br>  How about a game of guess the owner of that haircut.<br>Make, post, guess.<br>I'll start with a moderately easy one.</br></br>  What a normal haircut.  absolutely normal  In b4 snake  <br>Unique Bebop</br>  <br>That one is actually pretty hard, it's too normal to draw much from. Unless it's just a silhouette and is normally a weird color?</br>  No time to be depressed about Karasu=SAN, the ED album is out. Too bad it hasn't been leaked yet.  <br>Can't wait for it.<br><br>Also hoping this time for that flashback on how Fujikido met Yukano and Gendoso.</br></br></br>  <br>3rd ED a best.</br>  <br>Same here. Speaking of which, the next episode has been shown at an event on the 19th, though of course, no one is allowed to talk about it. The official hints are pretty vague, as lots of episodes can be described by them, but nonetheless, here they are:<br> Could it be, that...? <br> Kawaii, hooray! <br> Merciless! </br></br></br></br>  Dat hair waving around  <br>4 is my favorite https://vimeo.com/127257730</br>  <br>I really hope it will be the flashback. That, or Fujikido going around thinking about his past before he became Ninja Slayer.</br>  <br>Ninja Slayer confirmed for best ED of the year then?</br>  <br>If you have this many ED's, then you have quite the high chance.<br><br>Only question which one is THE BESTEST.</br></br></br>  <br>Koki a cute.</br>  Bumping it.  2nd ED is best, full version especially. Some of the recent ones have been cool too though, that hip hop one was dope.  In the end, it's Sushi-Night at the Barricade. We are introduced to the resistance ninjas, and a certain enigmatic beauty makes her debut.<br><br>Oh, and there's a Ling Tosite Sigure ED.</br></br>  <br>Did you buy the full second ED, or was there a leak that I didn't notice?</br>  <br>A ninja of fine taste</br>  <br>It's a part of their tour set, so there are live versions.</br>  <br>Sexy Zone rip when?</br>  <br>FAIR ENOUGH.</br>   WASHOI    Episode 15 is already out on Viewster <br> It's still not out on Funi </br>    http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>15096</wbr>  <br>YEEART</br>  <br>Viewster releases episodes 2 hours before Funi</br>  <br>YEEART!<br>By the way, where is today's episode?</br></br>  <br> http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=<wbr>715096</wbr> <br>Huh?</br></br>  DŌMO, HAJIMEMASHITE, /a/-SAN.

Seems like Nancy had the most change; she looks early 20s in the anime and late 20's-early 30's in the novel.   Ponytail Yukano <br>Oh, my Buddha!</br>  The episode had too much animation even the generic guys had mouth flaps  <br>NINJA?!</br>  I don't like new Yukano.  <br>-I mean, AMNESIA-san</br>  <br>Damn, she could use those as a weapon</br>  <br>Silver Karas lives on in the sword.</br>  i lost my shit when ninja slayer handed him the origami turtle<br> it was a turtle, right? </br>  <br>Yep.</br>  <br>ouch</br>   dat ED   <br>They just sound like really bad math rock x piano wanking.</br>  <br>B-but it's really good sounding bad math rock and piano wanking!</br>  cynthia ED when  <br>Yeah that's fair.

Just perfect.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  why didn't ninja slayer remove the damn explosive fuses from rupture?

It's still cool, though. I know it's satire, but /cyb/ stuffs are always cool for me.<br><br>I don't even know why she was amnesiac in the first place.</br></br>   Anime Expo panel <br> Imaishi stated he is in charge of all the big manly dudemonsters who keep getting destroyed <br> The actual director is sick of his shit, so he spends a lot of time assigning him to draw dumb things that die immediately <br> Imaishi has literally zero control over female characters <br><br>I love Trigger.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> character who occasionally interacted with MC falls in love with someone who isn't MC <br> ntr </br></br>  <br>DIE SLUT!</br>  <br> Will Nancy get something? <br><br>at the rate she's gonna she's probably jsut gonna get raped</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't it more like "Don't let Imaishi near the female designs!"?</br>  <br>They could've at least given her a cool dude to fall for.</br>  <br><br>I can't help but wonder if we skipped a lot of content or if there's gonna be a flash back in the future</br></br>  <br>plastic tic tacs</br>  what did he write.  <br>Cuck</br>    <br> SAYONARA!! </br>  <br><br>well that's not very friendly</br></br>  <br>"I'm the GARest"</br>  Not one of the best episodes, but still pretty good. Was nice to see what had happened to Yukano.  <br>NAMU-SAN</br>  <br><br>I didn't think it was as good as the recent too Koki episodes but it was better than pretty much the three before that<br><br>I don't know what it is but whenever Nancy is on screen I am just bored beyond reason</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rapture-san ;_;</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=K0z<wbr>K3zSYlVU</wbr>  [ ]  Im probably gonna regret asking but where are Koki's parents   Yukano loses her memories and her comfy clothes <br> her bust became less ample <br> we got fishnets, ass and ponytail in exchange <br>I'm conflicted.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;her bust became less ample <br><br>it's about as ample just more bound. Fish net under mesh clinging to her bosom tightly</br></br></br>  <br>They look as ample as usual in that scene, but they felt a lot smaller everywhere else. I don't know.</br>  <br>Amazons preferred to BURN OFF ONE OF THEIR BREASTS than twang a nip on a bowstring.<br><br>Just sayin'.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Amazon's never existed</br></br>  <br>She accidentally killed them as far as I recall.</br>  YEEART    <br>Probably something like that he understands what Yukano/Amnesia wants, but still Gendoso wants him to keep an eye on her.<br><br>Not to mention that if she will want something from him, then she'll know where to look for him.</br></br></br>  <br> full version <br> less than 3 minutes long <br>Still amazing, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Its amazing. Still my favourite ED</br>  Why does /a/ think of my nigga Luke Valentine?<br><br>Dat nigga cool as ice</br></br>  <br>'bout time</br>  Great ED this week, but why is Yukano dressed like a Taimanin?

I do like Hatoko but I'm not a Hatokofag. I'm of those that think that everyone in the club was shit. Only the President was the one that actually was tolerable and she got btfo'd. Another one that was best was the teacher but it would have been unrealistic to think she would win. So that leaves us with nobody in the series and that's okay, because it was fucking boring shit.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128477078 <br><br> Hiroyuki Saber.png </br></br>  <br>She's pretty much the only great girl in the show.

Fuck the reds and whites they ruin everything.</br>    <br>Sayumi and Mirei best girls</br>    <br>I have nothing against Mirei, but that's just bullshit. Mireifags were quite zealous and aggressive since episode 2 came out. Some of them took shots at the entire club and started fights with their fans over a misunderstanding on their part.

Oh wait, what have I got here?  <br> Thanks for the dump </br>    <br>Not that guy, but you're doing God's work.</br>  <br><br>Man of culture detected</br></br>  <br>Who made these?

Best girl too of course.</br>    Only real chuuni in the show.  <br> tfw she neglected to being ED bait for most of the show <br><br>Why are the best girls always seldom seen ;_;</br></br></br>  <br><br>Forced tsundereshit.</br></br>  <br>season 2 never</br>  <br>old news from an old and busted show<br><br> S2 never   ;____; </br></br></br>  Tomoyo is overrated. Kuki and Chifuyu best girls.  <br><br>They're so perfect for each other.</br></br>  <br>Hatoko is perfecter for him.</br>  <br>She's only half perfect for him. Endless Paradox both understands him and doesn't understand him since they're both Chuuni. When they both understand and not understand each other is when the paradox is broken and love blooms.</br>  <br>Tomoyo has chemistry with ANdou and is on the same wave length as him. Hatoko barely has that. Andou disagrees, don't bother him about it.</br>  <br>Andou says Hatoko is special for him. He will fall in love with Hatoko when he realizes how much of a hassle and bother Tomoyo is. Nice and motherly girls win in the end.</br>  <br>A Trigger animator.</br>  Why was Andou so fucking based? Like it's the little things that he did that made him a top-tier MC. Telling Chifuyu not to create life, wanting to leave hope that Route of Origin could erase their powers. Pic related. He was a pretty damn cool guy.  <br>The only bad thing about him is that he likes the generic tsundere.</br>  <br>She was shit.</br>  <br> S2 never </br>  <br> muh "generic" <br>You wouldn't recognize generic if it came out of your ass.</br></br>  <br>This. <br><br>Hatoko and Mirei were infinitely superior.</br></br></br>  <br>Tomoyo is so generic it hurts.</br>  <br>Mirei was, Hatoko not so much.</br>  <br>Does this girl win? Is she first girl?</br>  <br>Why did this show look better than Kill la Kill? This was supposed to just be some quick adaptation to pay the bills, right?</br>  <br>At least Hatokofags now see that Tomoyo won.</br>  <br>The characters are all fucking generic<br>This show is a play-by-tropes with very little originality/creativity, the only reason it got on /a/'s radar is because of WAKANNAI</br></br>  <br>He was cool for a harem lead but he is also the kind to pretend to not understand the girls feelings just to not break up their group.</br>  Season 2 when?  <br>Never because Kadokawa is a pack of Jews. No AmaBuri S2 either.</br>  <br> why live </br>  <br>There is still a chance that best girl girls, so don't claim victory yet.</br>  <br> No AmaBuri S2 either. <br><br>this is what hurts the most</br></br></br>  Commie or HS?  <br>There's literally 0 reason to choose HS over commie</br>  <br>Delicious. Hatokofags's tears sustains me. Best girl the Andoubowl and they can't do a thing about it.</br>  <br>Technically, Tomoyo and Chifuyu are best girls. It is not a coincidence they have the best powers too. Fuck and marry both to have control over time and space.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br><br> Tomoyo <br> best girl <br><br>Does not compute.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's a very relatable character (Self-infertable waifu bait in buzzwordese).<br><br>She wants to be seen as a normal functioning member of society and does not want to associate herself to the Chuuni culture despite secretly immersing herself into it writing her own delusions in paper. It's pretty similar to early Ogiue who would buy mountains of BL in Comiket while constantly insulting otaku and otaku culture at the same time.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Tomoyo being best girl is undeniable. It helps the great chemistry she has with the MC could never be argued against.<br><br>https://my.mixtape.moe/uxqlnw.webm<br>https://my.mixtape.moe/mxzmoz.webm<br>https://my.mixtape.moe/crhgjy.webm<br>https://my.mixtape.moe/dvsukv.webm<br>https://my.mixtape.moe/jiqach.webm<br>https://my.mixtape.moe/rjaofp.webm<br>https://my.mixtape.moe/blpdre.webm<br>https://my.mixtape.moe/rjaofp.webm</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does she like it up the butt? Is this the reason Hatoko lost while having that insanely sexy normalfag body?<br><br>Taking it up the pooper can be a dealbreaker.</br></br></br>  <br>She's a chuuni. So she probably likes all kinds of depraved crazy things like  missionary position and handholding, leg locking, and cumming inside for procreation.  </br>  <br>And yet none of those scenes are as good as Hatoko's stellar moment in the series.</br>  <br>The only good thing about that scene is her VA. Hatoko went to shit for being a normalfag. Everything about Tomoyo is better than Hatoko as a character.</br>  Tomoyo can beat anyone in a fight, her power is too strong.  <br>She is great. Really great. I think their chemistry and interactions may beat even Raku and Chitoge's. <br><br> No webm of their date <br>How can you not have that?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Time powers are always broken.</br>  <br>Still can't write good novels</br>    <br>On its own it's pretty good, but the fact that when they meet back up it's just a casual "I'm sorry" "no I'm sorry!!" and then they act like nothing happened kinda takes away from it. Of course this is just my  opinion. </br>  <br>Man this scene was stupid.<br><br>My friends are into stuff I don't like but I don't launch into 3 minute tear filled tirades over not liking what they like.</br></br></br>  <br>Even  Accelerator? </br>  <br>Well, the thing was the MC would talk to Hatoko about all this shit non-stop even though she knew fuck all about it. I can sort of see a reason for it if it's your childhood friend that's been doing that for so long.</br>  <br>Even so the tears still seem ridiculously over the top.</br>  <br>You'd think she'd learn to deal with it at that point then. If it bothered her so much she could've just not talked to the guy.</br>  <br>She exists in a harem world. Which means she either compete for the 1 designated MC or be alone the rest of her life.</br>  <br>Took some time, but I did it.<br> https://my.mixtape.moe/acmnfd.webm<wbr></wbr> <br>Date.<br> https://my.mixtape.moe/oihbbk.webm<wbr></wbr> <br>I also made the restaurant scene with her brother.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Woah, you did it? God's work etc, bro.<br><br>Watching these webm makes me want to rewatch the show.

I think it'll be worth it start translations from scratch since Trigger has taken a significant amount of liberties in the ordering of narrative.<br><br>This is my first time doing it so I can't guarantee any quality and speed. I'm also not a moon speaker so I'm translating from another language so I won't bother for literal translations.<br><br>http://pastebin.com/3mpQnxmc<br><br>Here's an excerpt. R8, h8, b8 etc.etc.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No bother. Here https://my.mixtape.moe/ovarjs.webm<br><br> https://my.mixtape.moe/hdqhdb.webm<wbr></wbr> <br>Also made this since it's one of my favorite scenes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Based Tomoyobro</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>thanks m8</br>  <br>Wow. Are you the Tomoyofag who said he'll work on translating the LN if you got enough motivation?</br>  <br>No<br><br>But I am a Tomoyofag</br></br></br>  <br>Strange, you're not the same anon? Either way, you're awesome. Thanks for translating.<br><br>So not from moonrunes so no literal base translations. But I do hope you won't localize otaku slangs and will try to keep popularized honorifics at least.</br></br></br>  Would you?  <br>I would make her my  chuuni lover from a past reincarnated life. </br>  <br>Thanks anon, this could be neat. What language are you translating from?</br>  <br>There was a Tomoyo fan who said he might translate the LN if he was more interested, and I believe he said he'll do it from his native language, which was  Korean . If he''s the same person, then it's probably that.</br>  She's super cute, but I bet she has the smelliest cunny.  Fuck this show.  <br>I don't think it was me,but I am translating it in Korean. Seems like the overall quality of itnis alright so I think it'll at least be better machine translated Chinese scans</br>  Raws incoming soon supposedly, who hype for food cart comeback?<br><br> Erina's face when she keeps getting her hopes up for Souma getting expelled and then he survives </br></br>  It's just her sadistic side. She wants her husbando to suffer.  She wants him to win tho.  <br> she keeps getting her hopes up for Souma getting expelled and then he survives <br>Not in the last few chapters though, she mellowed out quite a bit, even asking him on how he plans to beat Kuga if I remember right</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure she's only just getting to the point of sexual awareness period, let alone being attracted to any one male in particular. It will be a while before she develops and then acknowledges feelings for him. At best, she just sees him as an increasingly threatening rival.</br>  Chink scans never.  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-07-23/food-wars-shokugeki-no<wbr>-soma-gets-original-event-anime/.90<wbr>807</wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br>She asked him that several chapter ago yes. More startlingly, like 2 chapters ago, she told him to stop worrying about other areas and focus on beating Kuga.</br>  <br>Is it just me or has Tosh made several characters' flair kind of fluctuate over the months since the anime started? Like here Souma looks pretty boyish, but when he had the full page when he arrived back at the PSD after the stagiaire arc, he looked absolutely manly. Both styles are good I suppose, but there seems to me to be less consistency.</br>  How does Erinas butthole smell like  <br>Alice's farts probably smell gastronmically balanced and delicious</br>  <br>What does "original event anime mean?" An original short? An OVA?</br>  <br>Man she's in for a ride once she finds out about his dad</br>  <br>It means an SnS themed event in real life during WSJ's tour thingy. Could be an interview with the cast, could be a special screening, could be CD giveaways, who fucking knows.</br>  <br>I feel it's more about what he wants to convey each time, and that's fine for me.</br>  <br>I think that's what he's doing too.</br>  OTP  It's blatantly obvious she'll turn into the most generic tsundere possible when she finds out who Souma's dad is, enjoy her while she has a personality  <br>He isn't even a decent rival, so much that Souma barely gives a fuck about him.</br>  <br> enjoy her while she has a personality <br>Is conceited bitch a personality? I figured it was closer to a mental disease.</br></br>  <br>Would you buy a plushie of your qt rival?</br>  <br>Literal fucktoy<br><br>captcha: bicycles</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh, boy.</br></br>  <br>Even as a kid Erina wanted to fuck Soma's dad.<br><br>She wants it.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to hug this plushie.</br>  <br>Two week time skip does things to you.</br>  so what will happen next? Soma will beat Yugi in a Shokugeki and get his spot in the Elite10? then I guess we will get even more Erina, and she might actually find out who his dad is already.  Would she die ?  Hishoko is an angel.  <br>Erina is going to advance seats, I don't think she'll ever be below him.</br>  <br>That feels too early. Also the subplot where Kuga and Tsukasa have some sort of deal going on needs to be adressed. So I'm guessing Kuga wins, but barely, then gets rekt by Tsukasa in a shokugeki (maybe that was promised) then we get another arc, maybe two where Soma gets better and then finall Soma wrecks Kuga also in a shokugeki<br><br><br> implying endgame-posttimeskip-marriedtosoma-<wbr>momerina won't have short hair anyways</wbr> </br></br></br></br>  <br>She'd be sad.

If she ends up losing Soma to Erina, she won't have a guy to marry.  <br> That feels too early <br>We need to properly meet half of them before they leave in 4 months, it feels appropiate.<br>The deal with Tsukasa will probably be some fucktarded condition for a shokugeki which Souma will make him fail, so he gets buttmad and tries to wreck him in a shokugeki in front of the whole academy.</br></br></br>  <br>You really can't see why this wouldn't be a first shounen series for many people?<br><br>Hint:  It's because its a series about cooking and not about ninja's, swords, and magic. So its not your typical sounenshit that /a/ hates </br></br></br>  <br>Tosh's art is insane for a shonen mango</br>  <br>they probably are okay enough with him now since the knives that they wouldn't boo him during the inevitable souma-takumi shokugeki, but they'd still probably treat him disdainfully as takumi's rival. no heckling, but they might voodoo doll him or someshit. stuff like that.</br>  <br>I suppose that makes sense. I can honestly picture /a/nons looking at a series and disregarding it completely when they see in its description that it has any kind of fighting or magic in it. Many of them probably started reading Shokugeki no Souma thinking it wouldn't even be a traditional shounen.</br>  <br>350~450 chapters i say</br>  KUGA STATUS<br><br>[ ] NOT TOLD<br>[ ] TOLD<br>[ ] FUCKING TOLD<br>[X] MAPO TOLDFU</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It would be extremely painful?</br></br>  <br>souma's banter has always been super effective against kuga</br>  <br>It's not like Souma's ever really fought Takumi, so I don't think they'd care too much.<br><br>They must hate Mimasaka so much though.</br></br></br>  is there anyone that could win houjou's houjous?  <br>Yugi.</br>  what even was the point of takumi having a super-special-ultra-deluxe SECRET TRUMP CARD if it failed completely and spectacularly? might as well just not have given it to him at all, and instead set it up so that his "rebound" was based purely on innovation under pressure with the ingredients he had left, and it just wasn't enough.<br><br>intentionally giving him a gimmick and then having the gimmick get BTFO just shows takumi to be a really talentless hack in comparison to the top-tier cooks, because he can't figure shit out on his own.</br></br>  <br>megumi of course, houjou sounds like she'd be into that.</br>  <br>No she won't. At least not yet. Souma isn't challenging Kuga to a shokugeki for his E10 seat. She'll likely to advance next year when the the top 5 seats become vacant.</br>  <br>The real question is, will she hop over any of the current 2nd years in the process, or just remain in the status quo as 5th seat next year?</br>  <br>Most 1st years would have lost in that situation, Souma would have been wrecked hard against giganigga if he hadn't known his gimmick.</br>  <br>It wasn't so much about Takumi as about Subaru. To show off just how absurd his stalking predictions could be.</br>  <br>There's a lot of people who are willing to marry her anon.</br>  <br>That's not the point. The point is not that he was designed to lose, nor that he only was able to start a comeback due to quick thinking. The point is that you could do both of those things without introducing a gimmicky secret ace up the sleeve, it was completely unnecessary. If you're going to go so far as to introduce something like that, it should be a guaranteed win, since it's an emotionally-tied one-time-use trump card. If you're going to make it lose anyways, then the process of doing so should make Takumi look better in the process, instead of worse. Having him freak out under pressure and release his ultimate backup plan in a panic, shows him to be even more immature of a cook than before, particularly because his poor judgement was shown when it just wasn't enough to win.<br><br>You could still have all of the same plot/character development without the gimmick. Just write it so that he had a few more ingredients to begin with, and have him come up with some uniquely innovative idea under pressure. That's the same thing as what happened, but without using a gimmick to make it happen, so it comes off as more legit and less stupid when he loses.</br></br></br>  <br>It was more to establish that Subaru was such a badass he anticipated that Aldini would make at least one innovation and then make another one.<br><br>To be fair to Takumi, had he known Giga Nigga's gimmick he may have been able to pull what Soma did.</br></br></br>  <br>It really depends on Tootsuki's evaluation of her as well as other students gunning for a seat in the E10. If no other third years get into the E10 and Kuga drops out from their ranks she could get as high as fourth next year.</br>  <br>It wasn't even about that retard, don't listen to the other guys either. It wasn't about takumi's mental strength or giganigga being super hyped as a result, but about giganigga exploiting and corrupting the bond Takumi has with his brother. The gum on the mezzaluna, the insulting his brother's talents, the anticipation of the oil, the stealing of his mezzaluna, all were orchestrated to completely DESTROY takumi's bond with his brother. Giganigga isn't satisfied with merely winning by a landslide, he feels the need to emotionally cripple the opponent too.</br>  <br> implying she won't do side ponytail like Hinako or tie it up like a bunch of milf archetypes do. </br>  <br>Hot.</br>  <br>or she could just pass up kuga and eizan straight up, and be 3rd behind isshiki and nene<br><br>if some secret (to us as of right now) 2nd year makes it in as a 3rd year ahead of erina, she could end up as low as 7th too, with only 3 spots left for the current first years.</br></br></br>  Wasn't Erina's character song supposed to have come out recently?<br><br>Does anyone have it?</br></br>  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA!  <br>for some reason untie hair is my fetish.</br>  <br>She's only 15, you sick fuck.</br>  I WANT ERINA TO GIVE SOUMA  A LITTLE BROTHER!   <br>Perfectly legal.</br>  <br>You made me picture a cross-dressing Erina. I don't know how I feel about that.</br>  <br>It came out yesterday, just wait a few days.</br>  <br>It means she fucks Jou, retard</br>  <br> cross-dressing Erina <br><br>You mean Takumi?</br></br></br>  <br>But what I said implied that what I pictured wasn't what you meant. If you had actually said that I wouldn't have commented.<br><br> I knew you meant that, retard </br></br></br>   Raws incoming soon supposedly <br>I don't understand<br>it airs tomorrow right<br>that's not very soon</br></br></br>  <br>GET IN LINE!</br>  <br>someone post the gordon ramsay image about where's the subs it's raw, etc</br>  So they're skipping the Karaage arc?<br><br>The anime is going to adapt until chap 60, Shueisha will announce the second season for Spring 2016, r-right?</br></br>  <br>He's talking about the manga.</br>  <br> autumn election <br> in the spring <br>heh</br></br></br>  <br>what manga?</br>    <br>Shokugeki no Soma is a cooking manga.</br>  <br> Shueisha will announce the second season for Spring 2016, r-right? <br>Not with those sales</br></br>  <br>wait really? I thought those images were just a fan work cause it looks like some porn I've read</br>  <br>It's a WSJ manga draw by Tosh. Please go read it.</br>  <br>That's because Tosh used to draw porn.</br>  <br><br>you should ask hayama that</br></br>  <br>BD/DVD sales really don't matter for WSJ manga when it comes to a second season. We'll probably get a S2 just because the anime boosted the manga sales.</br>  <br>wow never thought of that, he could probably tell from yards away whenever someone farts huh? not to mention the exact number of hours since someone has showered if they're near him.</br>  does an extremely aged loli smell good? rotting could be a weird preference  <br>virgin christmas cakes probably dump out tons of pheromones in a desperate attempt to attract a mate</br>  <br>It seems to do wonders for the quality, I think more should do it for the  experience </br>  Is this show gonna keep going after this season? It's kind of become my favorite thing ever.  <br>Yes.  in the manga </br>    <br>And then you stop and remember that he grew up in an Indian slum and wonder how on earth he could have survived those odors.</br>  <br><br> Teiki <br>Kill yourself, shitstain.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, probably. But you can always read the manga.</br>  <br>We'll see after this week's episode. We're hoping JC Staff just rearranged the arc.</br>  <br>It will likely get a second season. Maybe even a third once there's enough content from the manga to adapt. Not sure if they can go further than that.</br>  Where da raws at?  <br> Raws incoming soon supposedly, who hype for food cart comeback? <br><br>What?

Surely there's a chink on here that's a fan of this manga?  <br>Damn. At least ill have something to look forward too after work.</br>  <br>Are there any more LNs coming out or is it just those three?</br>  <br>I think we'll have more soon.</br>  <br>We have the Jifeng staff, they always give us spoiler pics.</br>  <br>I hope she gets character development someday.</br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>Erina's hair is super long.

I think not, we need one more bitch and we will have 5 end game pairings. Souma x Erina and Kurokiba x Alice are basically confirmed, Takumi x Megumi seems pretty realistic after that Drama CD. <br>Then, ehm, Hayama x Hisako? I mean, they had a pretty intense match, and he was basically a reason why she felt a need to left Erina and all that.<br>Nigga can fuck Stalker bitch.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Takumi is already a bitch though</br>  <br>It's just the number you need for baseball.<br><br>Pitcher<br>Catcher<br>1st<br>2nd<br>3rd<br>Shortstop<br>Out right<br>Out center<br>Out left</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Souma x Erina and Kurokiba x Alice are basically confirmed <br>Nah.</br></br>  <br>Souma-Erina it's obvious<br>Ryou-Alice is semi-canon</br></br>  <br>  </br>  <br>Fucking lucky currynigger if that happens.</br>  <br>She can tie it all up really well when she wants to.</br>  <br>SHE'S A BIG GIRL</br>  <br>Is she wearing anything underneath?

The story is set up for three years from the start anyway, as Jouichirou is closing up Yukihira's for three years.</br>  <br>I love you anon, thanks.</br>  <br>Fuck, a chapter with no Erina is sad. It's like the election arc all over again.</br>  No, really, how did he get so far in the red with such low operating expenses in the first place?  <br>Thanks, anon.</br>  <br>She isn't even the best looking girl in the series</br>  <br>umm...what the fuck is this</br>  <br>I don't know how to tell you this, but anon, I think you have a problem.</br>  <br>Haganai and Yahari, among others. But those others are just timeskipping through the 3 years.</br>  <br>plot convenience</br>  <br>Those are LN, btw.</br>  <br>Pretty meh.<br><br>Kuga's faces saved the chapter.</br></br></br>  <br>Isshiki's booth fucking when</br>  <br>Nope<br><br>Alice, Ryoko, and the Chinese feminist are better looking</br></br></br>  Damn Souma is cute.  <br>It's just an exaggeration and the author tries to give us some fun with Yoshino reacting excesively to that.</br>  <br>Not that anon, but while Alice is best girl, she's not better looking than her cousin. Ryouko's the only one I see truly giving Erina a running in the looks department.</br>  <br>Last chapter there's a girl wiping food from a boy (presumably her bf)'s cheek. Before, boys were admiring Houjou's body and two couples were in the hallway while Souma talks with Erina. Tosh has been sneakily building up for romance.</br>  Which jobber is best jobber.    <br><br>This really</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't call Isami a jobber, he doesn't do much to begin with, Takumi on the other hand...</br>  The festivals been going pretty briskly; I think we are on day 4 within 5 chapters. Because we are focused almost entire on Souma though, it kind of feels like he should get to the point already, even though it's not actually dragging.<br><br>I wish we'd see more of the others. I thought for sure we'd see the rest of the elite 10s setups since they were just introduced. I guess there's still time though.</br></br>  <br>250</br>  <br>I like the Chinese girl. She hits all my spots.</br>  <br> Being put with the best eight. <br> Being put with the bros. <br><br>Meat just doesn't fit, can she just fuck off already.</br></br></br></br>  <br>300 at least.</br>  <br>She should move into PSD and become an irrelevant cutie with Ryoko and Yoshino.</br>  <br>Except Meat isn't nearly as cute as Yuki, let alone Ryoko</br>  <br>Nope seriously fuck off with your hate, is there not a stupid thread where you can't stop whining about her. Shit she has barely DONE anything lately, give it a rest.</br>  <br> http://www.jifengi.com/5646 <br>I would assume there is some time of land renting thing he has to pay every day.</br></br>  <br>Meat is plenty cute, stop hating.</br>  <br> short hair Erina <br><br>For the first time I'd say for once this does not suit the character at all. Went from 10/10 to mediocre.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I can see this happening after Erina loses her seat in 2nd year. She cuts it out of shame and goes homeless until she ends up at Polar Star.</br></br>  <br>Just no.</br>  <br> She cuts it out of shame and goes homeless <br>Opens up a shop like Souma's.</br></br>  <br>You ruined both of them.</br>  Who would you Marry, Fuck, and kill between Hisako, Erina, and Alice?  <br>Fuck off.</br>    no erina again this week <br><br>Why even consider breathing</br></br>  <br>I'm just asking a question, no need to get mad anon.</br>  <br> Marry Hisako, leave the other two alone.</br>  Did anyone else notice that this chapter is called 死角 (blind spot) and not 視覚 (vision)? It's interesting that both are pronounced "shikaku."  <br>Thank goodness there's no Erina. It's good that other characters get screen time instead of her because to be frank she's a shitty character.</br>  So it is a Mapotofu noodle with a "lion's head".<br>as a chink I must say those hardly match each other.</br>  <br>You tried to start a thread with that question as the OP, but the thread was considered too cancerous to be used and was deleted.</br>  <br> hype over fan service the porn face manga <br>you are all degenerate scum</br></br>  <br>Marry Erina, Fuck Alice, and protect Hisako.</br>  <br>I'm only here for Hisako anon. She's too pure for fanservice.</br>  <br>Why use Alice's first appearance, where she looks like shit?</br>  <br> She looks like she is on drugs, and her style of cooking doesn't help too much to dismiss this idea.</br>  where I can find the old chapters in color?  <br>this<br>shit is rigged</br></br>  <br>Better now anon?<br><br>Honestly though I would marry Hisako and have a family restaurant with her. Fuck Alice and probably just ignore Erina.</br></br></br>  i just finished reading the election arc<br>Alien x Zombie OTP</br>  <br>&lt;spoiler&gt;mangahere&lt;/spoiller&gt;<br>They mark color chapters as .1 releases</br></br>  <br>Alice is the better character but Erina is hotter</br>  <br>they now look like they belong in some moe blob anime</br>  <br>The stupid thing is that her first appearance design was changed the very next chapter and then her final design after 3 chapters which mainly involved her eye coloring.</br>  <br>No that's Hisako anon, get your shit right.<br><br>There's a reason why the Author's favorite female character is Hisako.</br></br></br>  <br>You're the devil for doing this but<br><br>Marry Erina<br><br>Fuck Alica<br><br> protect  Hishoko</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree, I was just talking about the Nakiris, since that other anon said he'd fuck Alice over Erina.</br>  Honestly why the fuck would you want to marry Erina when she's just going to be a ice cold nagging bitch. Wouldn't you want to marry Hisako who's loving and pure. Fuck even Alice would be a better choice to marry than Erina.  <br>Fuck off with your lame question. Not even sure why the fuck would you even want to pose that rubbish.<br><br>You need help, period.<br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her eyes are always changing and her design so I am not sure how she truly looks like.</br>  <br> Erina is rich as fuck and great at cooking.</br>  <br> ice cold nagging bitch. <br>See this is why I am not fucking her and fucking Alice. When you marry a tsundere she is suppose to be in the dere zone or else you wouldn't be marrying.</br></br>  <br> There's a reason why the Author's favorite female character is Hisako. <br>anon, no.<br><br>All that was written was that she's "one of the top bishoujo".</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or they started reading it because of Saeki Shun aka Tosh.</br>  THESE GIRLS ARE 15  <br>They eat well.</br>  <br>Anon she's probably not Tosh's top favorite but she's definitely Tsukuda's favorite female character.</br>  <br>anon, no.<br><br>"The author" that's Tsukuda<br><br>"thinks that lookswise" just talking about only looks and nothing else<br><br>"she's one of the top class bishoujo" Not the top, just one of the top ones.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure erina is his favorite<br>He have a pic of erina in twitter</br></br>  <br>Marry Erina<br>Fuck Hisako<br>Befriend Alice<br> I actually love Hisako but Erina has more wealth and superior genes so can't be helped </br></br></br></br>  <br> implying all female character TOSH made is not his favourites </br>  <br>Doesn't stop my dick from tinglin'.</br>  <br>I'm pretty damn sure that the writer said something about liking Hisako the most some time ago whether it was a interview or something. Anyway it doesn't matter because he still likes her character a lot which can't be said about Meat.</br>  <br>and?</br>  <br>I know anon, it's sad.<br><br>We'll get a lot of her when she works together with Soma, don't worry.</br></br></br>  <br>That's good.</br>  <br>For a supposed MC she gets less screen time than support characters. She's definitely not the writers favorite character in the slightest.</br>  <br>Erina is tsukuda's favorite character iirc</br>  <br>Let's be real here, he probably likes her design but not her character.</br>  <br>Anyone who thinks he doesn't like either main heroine doesn't read his tweets.</br>  <br>Fuck Alice<br> Marry Meat <br> Kill Megumi </br></br></br>  <br>Prove it</br>  <br>How the fuck would you even know</br>  <br>Never said he didn't like Erina but I said she ain't his favorite.<br><br>The only reason to like Erina is for her design, not her actual personality.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm Tsukuda's wife</br>  Meat &gt; Alice = Erina &gt; Hisako &gt; shit &gt; Megumi  <br>Because Erina's character is pretty shit. She has a terrible and bland personality.</br>  <br>What does meat have to do with anything? Even if she is irrelevant she appears everywhere which says that she is liked.<br><br>Actually why would any of them dislike any of their characters that's just stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sorry, but your thoughts aren't his.</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>Too bad meat is forever useless and irrelevant.<br><br>Hisako is the best and doesn't need to show off her breasts because she ain't a slut like Meat.</br></br></br>  <br>Good taste</br>  i want to slurp at meat's hot meatpot and plunge my chopstick into it  <br>Stop baiting you cancerous fuck. Stop trying to start a waifuwar and using Hisako.</br>  <br>Read his tweets<br>He seems to really be a erina-fag</br></br>  <br>You can see all the care he is placing with the melting of her tsun.</br>  <br>He doesn't make so many about them to say that, but there's enough to make it clear that he really likes both Erina and Megumi.<br><br>But that should be obvious anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you fucking retarded?<br>Tsukuda is a huge Erinafag, even his twitter icon is Erina.<br><br>And She got left out of the largest arc to date because she's an E10 member and an organizer which would leave her with nothing to do on screen.<br><br>Ignorantfag please go and stay go</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone do Leonora with short hair.</br>  <br>I really want to see Alice with long hair.</br>  So Souma is still not winning but showed his trump card?  So, besides the cook off with Jouichirou in the dorm, what do you think this next ep will have? I mean moving Jouichirou's visit does skew some things, so I'm pretty curious.  <br>Easy <br><br>Marry Hisako<br>Fuck Alice<br>Kill Erina</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Curry time</br></br>  Honest question do some of y'all actually like Erina as a character? I mean personality wise and everything.<br><br>Like what if hypothetically in the real world, she made you almost lose the chance to go to a great University because of her selfish shitty behavior even though you qualified on every right. Would you still forgive her? That's basically what she did to Soma in the beginning and it left a bad taste in my mouth and a really fucking bad impression of her.<br><br> inb4 people can change and everything  <br><br>Yeah I understand that but it still doesn't change the fact that she has a bad personality and at times is unbearable. Yes the author is trying to mellow her out but I feel he fucked up real bad because her personality is pretty shit, like he should of done that earlier. And her smugness is aggravating as fuck. At this point I feel like people only like her design rather than her actual character.<br><br>Although hopefully he does something good with her character because right now I just can't stand her even when the author is trying to redeem her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He seems to like Hisako a lot as well.</br>  <br> words <br>Okay</br></br>  <br>Kaarage next next week then?</br>  shokugeki no anal sex  <br>Seems to me like you need to give less of a fuck and just enjoy the damn thing. I find your whining aggravating. I actually find it fun to see a tsundere not mellow out too fast.</br>  <br> I actually find it fun to see a tsundere not mellow out too fast. <br><br>How can you find that fun?<br><br> God this is why most Tsunderes are terrible.</br></br></br></br></br>  Daily reminder Hishoko will win the Soumabowl.  ;_;   <br>  Hisako <br>  foreshadowing  <br><br>It's gonna happen anon, just believe.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because I do? I enjoy the dynamic when the tsundere isn't bipolar but just takes time to defrost. I am not that autistic to not forgive a character in a cooking manga because of mistakes they made.</br>  <br> not understanding that Takumi is the professional jobber in this series </br>  <br> Takumi is the professional jobber <br>Anon please, he jobs so hard I fear he might win once just because he will job at jobbing</br></br>  <br>Yabuki has ruined me, I immediately looked for a vagina in the reflective surface.</br>  <br> too pure <br> kills without a shred of remorse or emotion <br>sure anon. sure</br></br></br>  <br>  not realizing that tsunderes is a common archetypes in anime <br><br>Being you must be suffering</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's obvious that Hisako goes to the past to become Souma's mom.</br></br>    <br>It's good to see slow and more believable development, rather than breakthrough when tsundere does complete 180. I know Erina will have one too, but the buildup makes it better.</br>  <br>I am salivating at the thought.</br>   Kuga will be defeated and then forgotten <br>Please tell me this won't happen, this manlet is already in my top-5 of favorite characters.</br>  <br> It'll probably be a "Didn't get expelled but didn't win either" thing. Though Kuga will be forced to admit that Souma was better than he thought.</br>  <br> implying Souma won't be 1st the last day <br>It's something worth it just to see Kuga's face.</br></br>  <br> that Erina </br>  <br>That is exactly what I would do, so I think it's quite possible, yeah.</br>  what was he saying here?  <br>I hope Kuga's shop implodes in a rage fit.</br>  <br> now </br>  <br>Probably. I'm not sure Kuga can really lose at this point. 2 days remaining, Soma's still in the red, and Kuga's been running massive profits the last three days. I mean it is a shounen and all and that kind of shit is par for the course, but I can't picture him actually making more overall. Outselling him the last two days (or just the last) though, absolutely.</br>  Is this an accurate depiction of a vicious vampire?    <br>He is though.</br>  <br> username <br>into the trash</br></br>  <br>Newfag please.</br>   My faggot loli doing this faggot look every time I come home.

Makes them appear to be too much of the good guys? <br>As compared to what? Overthrow the government and turn the whole planet into another Iraq? The manga even outright stated that Japan doesn't want to deal with the problem of crippling the main world power in the Gate world, it leads to mass civil unrest.</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Jtg<wbr>hY3p8luE</wbr>  [ ]  <br>No, more like display overwhelming military might directly to the King and force fast negotiations instead of sitting around and letting the King and other Senates think that they have a chance of retaking Arnus Hill.</br>  <br><br>"Jap Blue" paint jobs make me feel funny inside.<br><br>And they make me wish the US would still do "Army Green" for their fighters.</br></br></br></br>  <br> No, more like display overwhelming military might directly to the King and force fast negotiations instead of sitting around and letting the King and other Senates think that they have a chance of retaking Arnus Hill. <br>That's what the Dragon Head is suppose to do. The point is that the JSDF doesn't have the mandate to overthrow the government and they were using standard negotiations done by the modern world. They are not trying to be "good guys", they just have laws and regulations they folow because they are Japanese and red tape is everywhere. Itami is the crazy main lead who doesn't follow orders properly.</br></br></blockquote>]
