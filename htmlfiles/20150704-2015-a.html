This hunger.  <br>Magic.</br>  <br> no panties, ever <br> not even the shadow panties from the first short <br><br>I'm confused. They made KLK, right? Why would they do this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>/co/ fucktards fuck off please.</br>  <br>if it wasn't summer i might believe you</br>  <br>I feel like losing your hat has to be the mark of a rank amateur, or someone who's kind of dumb, assuming they don't have the power or talent to cast "stick hat to head". You just wear a hat with ties on it, like a sunhat, or some cowboy hats. Maybe you lean on that if the Hat is compulsory Witch fashion and nonoptional until you know real magic and can make it stick when you have to do maneuvers that are ungraceful/not right side up.<br><br>Unwillingly displaying immodesty would be the same way. If you want to flash your panties, sure. If you are too incompetent to have magic that deals with that constantly or actively obscures your skirt dress, again, you clearly suck/have poor judgement in not wearing something sensible if you can't actually do that yet.</br></br></br>  <br> show made by japanese people in japan <br> surprised it's in japanese <br>They probably are speaking english, they're just shown speaking Japanese.<br><br>If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518?</br></br></br></br></br>  I approve of what my $300 helped bring together.  <br>Draw your own.</br>  <br>I know right.<br>PROTECT ME MARIA</br></br>  <br>She's Japanese.<br><br>Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this your first anime or something?</br>  So how are the subs for this?<br>Decent?</br>  <br><br><br>What are you talking about no retards here, that post doesn't even exist.</br></br></br>  <br>You wait for the Kickstarter for LWA3 which will be backed in a paltry 3 hours, along with all stretch goals and then some.</br>    <br>That's exactly what it feel like.</br>  <br>Spooky</br>  So the animation quality definitely isn't as high as the original, but what are your thoughts on it as a whole?<br><br>Even if it isn't up to the same standard I still think it's pretty solid</br></br>  <br>Is that what that was? I've never been to England, but I'm pretty sure britbongs don't screech like that.</br>  <br>who is this panda demon</br>  <br>There's a scene with Akko's panstu, they're dark blue.</br>  <br> If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518? <br><br><br> It is I, the animation guru who knows everything about animation </br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's any consolation, I'll make an edit of any future English dub so that Akko and only Akko still speaks moon.</br>  <br> Hand drawn Blingee <br><br>I like it.</br></br></br>  <br>600k is a pretty small amount<br><br>Consider that in the past, even for large animation studios like Disney they spent an average of 150k-300k per short for 8 minutes. That's without adjusting for inflation, either.</br></br></br>  <br> Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other Japanese girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas in Japan. </br>  <br>Animation quality not being as high was foreseeable, what with it being longer and all, and you could clearly see the segments the budget went to. A fluid and pretty animation even throughout the minor segments would have been too much for me too handle.<br><br>I liked it about as much as the first one, which is to say a lot.</br></br></br>   the boy tightly grabbing diana's ass the whole time <br><br>Fucking prick.</br></br>  <br>It is as cute and amusing as the original but yeah, animation quality is lower. I would attribute that to Trigger not having as much time as they do and should had spent now compared to when they were just starting up 2-3 years ago. Back then, weren't they only working on Inferno Cop and just planning out KLK?</br>  Did they release a copy without the English subtitles?  <br>Just like Dawn's are black, right?<br><br>But seriously, that tiny frame is like the only shadow panties in the whole thing? It's like a complete 180 from the first ep.</br></br></br>  So, when are BDs supposed to come out?  <br>I'll like it more if it had hand-drawn Snoop.</br>  Seriously. What the fuck is wrong with some of you. Trigger specifically asked you not to distribute this. Give them respect and don't be a douchenozzle who torrents this immediately. You're a selfish prick and I hope you all fall into a blender and get chopped up into a million pieces.  <br>Aug?</br>  <br>Up until the scene where the parade begins, it wasn't all that stunning. It was still enjoyable and fun but didn't really capture the feeling of LWA1.<br><br>As soon as the parade began, it was magical. I was somewhat afraid of what Trigger might end up producing but it met my expectations and then some. The new characters were very fun too. Maybe my expectations weren't as high as others after watching some of their more recent series.<br><br>Anyways, Amanda best girl from the new lot.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Someone get this hot-head out of here!<br><br> I agree with you </br></br></br>  <br>I realize that it's not going to look like a Disney movie without a huge budget. Google led me a cost of about 150k per episode of anime on average, this was from 2011, so with a bit under twice the budget they'd need for something twice a long as a regular episode I figured they could have made it look better.</br>  <br> Not downloading now and buying the BD and all surrounding merch later. </br>  <br>Nigga I backed this and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa.</br>  <br>why you yelling at me for , I gave them money and watched it at vimeo</br>  <br>cry more</br>      <br>That $600k+ also went into merchandise and other stuff.</br>  <br> and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa. <br>why arn't you getting a BD anyway?</br></br>  I want to beat the living shit out of those normie brats who were pelting our witches with disgusting commoner fruit.

Everyone else just gets a special thanks on their website, I think.</br>  <br/>  <br>yeah someone here said 300+</br>  <br>Yeah, it was like $300 or more.</br>  <br>Poorfags BTFO.</br>  <br>She was alright. She did a lot more by not talking and being aloof, in my opinion, it shows her character, but I agree with  in that Food girl needed something other than food.</br>  <br>Can this be a gif? Or even a Youtube?</br>  <br>Yeah that's true. Neither of them had a whole dance routine of time devoted to expound on their background.</br>  <br> implying a 30-something NEET lowlife living with his parents would donate enough to have their name put on the end credits </br>   diana cheering akko on <br>cute</br>  Do we know how much money was on TRIGGER's end?  So what do we need to do to get a full series? I was wary at first of getting LWB without the animation quality, fearing the animation is what gave it its charm, but now I have confidence in Trigger to give LWB proper presentation with a more limited budget, since the characters and universe are well-thought out and charming enough.  <br>I have you know I'm a professional engineering living with my parents.</br>  <br> somefaggotsstupidname (Sup /a/?) </br>  <br>Do we know if they are going to make more money from this movie too?</br>  <br> I'm a professional engineering <br>Sure you are.</br></br>  So Good Smile Company is plastered on the front and end of LWA2. Does this mean that they'll finally get around to making figures?  <br>Please be nice to Collin. He put over $300 into the kickstarter you know.</br>   Sorry, comments have been disabled by the owner of this video.   Did Takafumi Hori save Trigger's animation once again?   AOTY   <br>Anyone?</br>  <br>Probably. But that's kind of risky, the figure market in the west is nowhere near as huge as in Japan. Is LWA even popular in Japan? It looked like Trigger was making it mostly for the west (in the credits you don't see many Japanese names).</br>  <br>There were no panties in the first ep. Just impossible skirts.</br>  I like Amanda enough that I wish she'd been in the first OVA  <br>I dont think many japanese know what kickstarter is though do they?</br>  <br>Skirts like that exist, you know.</br>  <br>Well, Kickstarter is mainly a western thing so that makes sense.</br>   /a/ backs LWA2 <br> Trigger delivers a great movie <br><br> leddit and Tumblr back Under the Dog <br> CIA in shambles, production drama and setbacks <br>Feels great.<br><br><br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>They liked the animation but wasn't all over it like the West.<br> in the credits you don't see many Japanese names <br>I don't think they're familiar with KS.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I really don't understand why there isn't more like this. CGDGT slice-of-life as everyone seems to enjoy, just in a slightly more novel setting with a fantastic or sci-fi element to jazz things up a bit.  <br>That might just be Elevens not being into Kickstarter. Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously).</br>  <br>There was lots of Japanese names, just in romaji</br>  <br>That's just cause not many japs paid 300 dollars to be there.</br>  <br>jokes on them , I can fap to thighs alone.</br>  <br> Under the Dog <br><br>Was that one with Kojima?</br></br></br>  <br>Man, that Akko bitch ended up trashing Lotte's pillow.</br>  Is this the tripfags general?  <br>What a slut</br>  <br> Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. <br>[citation needed]</br></br>  <br>B-but muh slightly different school clubs are so much more fresh!</br>  <br> Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously) <br>I was in  the Yaraon threads  and they were more surprised/amused by that than anything. Only a handful of trolls were saying anything like that, and it was pretty clear they hadn't watched the OVA.<br> so this is a ripoff of Madoka funded by Amerika-jin, right??? </br></br></br>  It's official. LWA 2 &gt; LWA  <br>And hey, at the end of the day, if UTD comes out and is good, we can still enjoy it, if not, we can snark on it. It's win-win.</br>  <br>Literally the next sentence it is pointed out that that statement could be false.</br>  <br> CGDGT  <br>That's one long-ass acronym.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>   Fat-chan literally did nothing but eat, give food, and generally be fat <br>Impressive. She was still adorable though.</br>  I need a webm of Akko's transformation scene  <br> &gt;Fat-chan literally did nothing <br>she acted as the weight for the catapult.</br></br>  <br>I await the butthurt tumblr will have about fat shaming despite the character being fun, funny and cute.</br>  where is the high definition torrent? the vimo stream is choppy and atrocious. (my toaster doesn't do well with streaming)  <br>sankyuu</br>  <br>Looks like it was 20$+ to have your name on the website. I'm in the poorest of the poorfags.</br>  <br>I had<br> and generally be fat <br>for that one. The catapult was hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe not in that scene you posted. And I said shadow panties, not actual panties.</br>  <br>LWA3 when?</br>  <br>I don't think we'll get better than the 720p stream until backers get their actual BDs.</br>  <br>Yeah, she was the weak link of the secondary power trio.<br><br>I'd actually like to see a third OVA of the secondaries, but with Diana instead of her.</br></br></br>  Where the fuck is the 720p on Nyaa?  <br><br><br>WHAT THE FUCK<br><br>IT WAS JUST DOLPHIN PORN YOU FUCK</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yaraon threads <br>whats that?</br></br>  <br>She seemed to make herself larger there too. I wonder if that was just a visual gag or if she's one of those calorie-consuming magic types like Chouji in Naruto or that Zero Squad lady in Bleach.</br>  <br>Japanese Gaia, more or less.</br>  <br> DOLPHIN PORN <br>thats good too</br></br>  <br>720 is high definition you idiot, and that's what i was asking about.</br>  <br>Picked up.</br>  Was there no Kickstarter update?  <br>It's  2 years lurking before posting, faggot </br>  <br>so filled with 13 year old kids?</br>  <br>nvm, found the Trigger email</br>  <br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>I remember that trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend</br></br>  <br>I fucking wish I could make that joke.</br>  <br>Christ, someone's mad they can't get their pirated anime as fast as they want.</br>  <br>They did mention the emails going out around the AX screening in one of the previous KS updates but no, no update when the emails did go out.</br>  <br>Scene-wise, I think the first one was more memorable and better animated but overall, I think the second had the better story and characters.</br>  <br>If I never got into Ragnarok I would never know this feeling.</br>  <br>Trigger got probably more fan outside of japan than inside.</br>  <br>Some of the posters are clearly what we would call underage, yes. You'd fit right in.</br>  <br><br> trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend <br>s-seriously?</br></br></br>  <br><br>i am a backer, my computer is just a toaster and can't stream.</br></br>  <br> magnet:?xt=urn:btih:00820fc737e6cdd<wbr>fa2ea27fe37cd48928df06f30&amp;dn=388264<wbr>041.mp4&amp;tr=http%3a%2f%2fopen.nyaato<wbr>rrents.info%3a6544%2fannounce</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br>Does this work for you?</br></br></br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2013-08-12/little-witch-academia-<wbr>tokyo-event-cancelled-due-to-low-ti<wbr>cket-sales</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Not the only one, my friend.</br>  <br> first KS <br> was a student working at a deli <br> back $100 <br><br>If they open a KS for LWA3, I'm tossing a lot more in it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Because they didn't advertise it well enough. Most nips didn't even hear about the event until it was over.</br></br></br>  <br>it appears to be on kissanime</br>  <br>First definitely was jaw dropping around everything concerning magical fiesta. But I got chills when the parade started, and I actually think this has the better animation. You can see it clearly in Amanda.</br>  <br>If you were a backer you would know that you can DDL it from Vimeo.</br>  <br><br>if my computer is a toaster, and i say it's a toaster, what part of your small undeveloped nigger brain can't put 1 and 1 together to figure out i can't even magnet? <br><br>if there's an actual torrent on nyaa, say so, because i can't find it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> In order to kick off the event, Studio Trigger needed to sell at least 200 of the 400 possible tickets, but sales ended on August 12 with only 94 tickets sold.  <br><br> only 94 tickets sold <br><br>Damn.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't know that<br>how do you do that?</br></br>  <br>fuck off faggit</br>  what is the runtime for this ova? 35 minutes?  <br>if i never stream or used vimo, how would i by default know i could download the file? oh right, i wouldn't.</br>  <br> This video cannot be downloaded any more right now. Please try again later </br>  <br>Rude.</br>  <br>I never did magnets before but it worked fine for me.</br>  <br>The fuck are you on about? I don't know who you are.</br>  Jasmineka will turn out to be something greater in LWA3. I hope.  <br>Plus it had been out for six months. Everyone had already seen it, so the only draw was the creator talkback, which for a single OVA by a new studio isn't going to pull much attendance as a stand-alone event</br>  <br>There isn't anymore. It got deleted. You've got the magnet as your sole option.</br>  <br>There's a DDL link right under the video. They seem to be capping concurrent downloads, but it's the middle of the night EST so you probably should be able to get it.<br><br><br>Uh, because Trigger told us that there would be a download for backers two fucking years ago?<br><br><br>Yeah, that's the antiflood. I got that about eight times before it let me download it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>53 min</br>  <br> You can see it clearly in Amanda. <br>The only place you can see it clearly, because good luck taking your eyes off her.</br></br>  <br> My computer is a toaster so I can't magnet <br>Yes you can. You just don't know what the fuck is a magnet or how they work.</br></br>  <br>  The torrent you are looking for does not appear to be in the database. </br>  <br>have you tried turning it off and on again?</br>  <br>Toasters can use magnets.</br>  <br>Akkovision and Am and a vision were about 50/50 and all qt.</br>    <br>I'm pretty sure I came at this part.<br><br>I want to do lewd things to Mandy</br></br></br>  <br>I actually watched the entire show a few weeks ago, it was pretty damn funny. Shame it had so few seasons and the seasons were so short.</br>  <br>the magnet didn't work for me. what was that about toasters being able to use magnets again? idiot. <br><br>anyways, i found the download link on the vimo. thanks for nothing to the rest of you inept useless virgin fags.</br></br></br>  <br>wayfu4layfu</br>  <br>Are you insulting yourself?</br>  Reminder that Sucy is the best girl  <br>Ha, get fucked.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me. <br>Then you were holding it wrong.</br></br>  <br>That's what I thought as well. Figured she'd be a lot more rebellious. Smoking cigs, talking like a delinquent, etc.</br>  <br>You can't even call it a toaster then.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me <br>Clearly you're doing something wrong</br></br>  <br> mfw the person who sat in front of me at the premiere posted a picture of Yoshinari &amp; Otsuka to Instagram with the caption "based trigger" </br>  <br>Have you tried to swipe it across your HDD?<br>Fucking magnet, how do they work?</br></br>  so the download is around 590 mb right?  Does no one else like this qt?  <br>596 to be exact</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Dis nigga ain't got no magic in his heart.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>596.9mb</br>  <br>I like her, she's like a loli witch freeman</br>  <br>I thought she was a fun character but you're mostly going to get posts to the effect of <br> Constanze <br> I seriously hope you witches don't do this </br></br></br>  <br>slice of life is easy because it's cheap, i'd imagine.<br><br>then again i have no idea how budget is distributed in shows. Do they just pay the quality of animators? is it based on the number of frames to be made?</br></br></br>  <br>I wish she got some lines. But she's in the top 3 for me.</br>  <br>Just allow it in program you're using or copypaste it directly you sad faglord. Don't blame your incompetence on objects.</br>  <br> Akko, Sucy, Lotte, Diana, Ursula-sensei, Amanda, Constantze <br>These are the witches that cause me pathological grinning</br></br>  <br><br>god damn right i don't. but i had 300 bucks in my wallet when the kickstarter rolled around. and i'll have another 300 for the third ep.<br><br>and i'm not a nigger. i'm a proud aryan american national socialist.</br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCKING MAGNETS<br><br>HOW DO THEY WORK?</br></br></br>  <br>For some strange reason throughout I thought Constanze was a boy</br>  Haven't watched it yet. <br>Is Sucy still best girl?</br>  Fucking magnets, how do they work?  <br>Use those 300 dollars to buy a better toaster. Maybe one with four bread slots.</br>  <br>Yes. Amanda is best new girl though.</br>  <br><br>you're not funny. don't you have MLP to watch and a fedora to tip? you should go do that. you can fucking spot the redditors a mile away, i swear</br></br>  <br><br>its my understanding they work when the field lines created by the movement of electrons tend to point in a general direction instead of randomly cancelling each other out.</br></br>  I want some magic in my life  <br> that lotte botting </br>  <br>Please, keep posting.

I would.</br></br></br>  <br>I want one</br>  <br>I could throw 1000$ at it now.</br>  <br>That's a misconception.

(cough cough law school)</br>  <br>Akko is literally's Sucy's bitch. You can tell right away she's dominant as fuck.</br>  <br>I paid for this. Why would I watch it on vimeo if I can torrent it?</br>  <br>why is she in a magic school if she wants to build robots?</br>  <br>How about a 16-slice toaster?</br>   German is the ugliest <br>Just like in real life!</br>  <br>This nigga gets it.</br>  <br><br><br>shippers need to die<br><br>waifuism is the only way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why not? I'm enjoying them.</br>  <br>I would. Didn't back the previous one because I had doubts. No longer.</br>  <br>But can it open magnet links?</br>    <br>why would you need to if you have that much toast?</br>  If anyone is still downloading how fast is it going for you? I'm getting only getting 6KB/s.  <br>I was worried they wouldn't be able to capture the feeling of the original but they did a fantastic job. Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious.</br>  <br>Comparing the two, I think the first one had better lighting and smoothness of the overall animation, but that doesn't mean that this one was bad at all. It would be an added bonus though if they actually continue to improve on it until we get the BDs.</br>   There is no need to be upset   <br> Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious. <br>yeah klk was not bad but it didn't particularly wow me either.</br></br>  Cool, sticky, now we can just keep it in one thread.

I can't remember off the top of my head where the cutoff was.</br>  Trigger saved anime again.  <br>seriously. I'll admit i'm a very cynical person, even more so than is warrented much of the time. But at the end of the video I actually caught myself smiling. This series is just too fun and adventurous for me to dislike.</br>   Fat-chan's early design was this.   If Amanda was going to get exactly one doujin, which three fetishes should it have?  <br>Futa and two others</br>  <br>I was downloading this, does it mean my download is corrupted?</br>  <br>I'm happier with what we got.</br>  oh shit.<br>LWA is still on my backlog</br>  <br>Squinty eyed girl is cute.</br>  <br>Christ.</br>  <br>I was still in school, technically the 100$ I gave from money meant for books and other educational expenses.</br>  <br>Hurry up fam</br>  <br>If you weren't rolling around on the floor, writhing in joy anytime someone other than Jasmina was onscreen, you're bad at LWA.</br>  <br>Was doing other stuff plus I don't check /a/ too often anymore. Whenever I do come my pic folder manages to double in size.</br>  <br>Well the magic is needed to power those robots and technology she makes.</br>  Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one?  <br>For Fat-chan, they could've put in anybody and it would've worked. She was pretty useless...</br>  <br>Futa  and scat and snuff </br>  <br>Spats<br>Cowgirl Position<br>Femdom</br></br></br>  <br>I think they need to tone her down a bit</br>  <br>Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes.</br>  <br>I don't know, but for sure it should be illustrated by hirame.</br>  <br>Non-H, adventures, and with Diana</br>  <br>$300 to be in movie credits<br>$20 to be on website<br><br>less than that, and you just get an e-mail.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah! The crossover was great. Did they release it yet?</br>  <br>spats and femdom</br>  <br>YES<br>FUCKING YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. What a delightful series.  <br>femdom<br>zettai ryouiki<br>defloration</br></br></br>  <br>Fat-chan delivers candy to the people.</br>  <br> Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one? <br><br>I wanted to punch her, she was too fucking much. Then she has a sob which auto redeems her character some how and the plot falls on her lap. She's probably the worst character in the whole series, and it doesn't help that all the new girls were so delicious, smarter and level headed. <br><br>Akko behaves like a 10 year old girl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They needed her to be to set up for the heartwarming friendship to come out. When Lotte showed up and gave Akko the hat, I teared up a little.</br>  <br>That's the full one.</br>  <br>Early on yeah, had to be so that she could fall out with Lotte and Sucy in order to make up and save the day with the power of friendship.</br>  <br>Right~~ She was fine in the first one, but sorta kinda very annoying in this one. At least she became okay in the second half of the ep.</br>  <br> I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. </br>  <br>straight<br>consensual sex<br>missionary position</br></br></br>  <br>Your name is only in the credits if you backed $300.</br>  <br>And then there's THIS faggot...</br>  Damn hardsubs  I'm finally watching the movie. Amanda is fantastic as people said, so is Diana, Sucy being best as always. But I have to say Akko was a bit more annoying in this one, I can see why Yoshinari doesn't like her very much. Not that I hate her.  <br>I think you mean the fat girl eating donuts is the best girl</br>  <br><br>yes</br></br>  <br>Catch up, nigga</br>  This is like a cross between gainax/trigger and Disney. Absolutely stunning. I seriously hope they do more original stuff like this even if they need to kickstart more stuff just so they can have the freedom to do what they want without producers stopping them.  You guys do know that at this point it isn't really anime? It's literally for the western audience.<br>Man, Trigger really sold out.</br>  <br>Sounds like you could have used those.</br>  <br>But the cannonball...</br>  What Akko needs is someone to calm her down. Like a girlfriend.  Like Diana   <br>Trigger confirmed for bros</br>  <br>You again? Go away.</br>  <br>Now I remember why I put the name as Anonymous instead of something fun. I would've loved to see my name in the movie, but I rather not have my name posted on a website rarely anyone will visit besides spambots. Can't wait to get the Bluray though.</br>  WHERE WERE YOU<br><br>WHEN TRIGGER SAVED ANIME?</br></br>  <br>give me a break I doing shots.</br>  This thread is moving too sanic for me now.  What's the point of the HorribleSubs release?  Is [HorribleSubs] good?  <br> Disney <br>Funny you mention that, because there was rumors Pixar was working with Trigger.</br></br>  <br> Not Sucy <br>She'll keep her calm.  Forcibly </br></br>  <br> Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes. <br>How would tomatoes work as a fetish? Like a bunch of shotas shoving tomatoes into her, filling her up with them?</br></br>  Lets be honest, nobody cares about this shit anymore. Wasted money.  <br>Gross.</br>  <br><br>How to spot the retarded Redditfag.</br></br>  <br>Saw my name in the credits. Kinda wish I had put a silly one.</br>    <br>Her girlfriend is sushi.</br>  I don't get it.<br>Why does trigger produce trash like kill lel kill, inoushit and ninja slayer when they have the original right LWA?</br>  <br> What's the point of the HorribleSubs release? <br>Well for one the previous upload got deleted, again</br></br>   sticky <br>Okay, now this thread is total cancer.</br>  <br>nothing weird like that<br>just reverse cowgirl while juggling tomatoes<br>thats good clean fun.</br></br></br>  <br>We know it's you Diana.</br>  <br>Ah yes, anon's bait.</br>  Amanda has some nice thighs.  <br>Because Yoshinari has yet to work on full-length TV shows.</br>  <br><br>e-peen.<br><br> we were the first to release LWA2, guys! </br></br></br></br>  It was worth it, Trigger is truly saving anime.  <br>I'm sure Sucy has ways of keeping people calm. I'm sure they involve mushrooms.</br>    I hereby claim that my $400 paid for Trigger to come up with Amanda. I called it, now you never can, neener neener neener.   that scene where Lotte sings <br> I imagine it's Rukia singing </br>  <br> CGDCT <br>Fuck off you lazzy cunt.</br></br>  <br><br>Maybe the shitposting won't happen as fast.</br></br>  <br>where is this from</br>  <br>Use the juice as lube.</br>  <br>who?</br>  Fuck I have work due and still have the first one on my backlog, should I just cram it all tonight or take my time and enjoy it tomorrow?  <br>Tomato juice would make terrible lube. Far to acidic.</br>  <br>Fuck work, nigga.</br>    <br>put aren't vagoos already acidic anyway?</br>  <br>Get to work man, the OVA will keep.</br>  <br><br>Of course. Didn't you know anime will become illegal tomorrow? Better get your anime in before the feds come for you, pedo.</br></br>  <br> How would tomatoes work as a fetish. <br><br>They use Roger or Kyouko instead of fat, balding, old men.</br></br></br>  <br>put in some baking soda?</br>  <br>Okay, that was amusing and that  is nice (nice triples) but as I said, she could've been replaced by anybody. I like her but she is the most replaceable of any of the new girls.</br>  <br>we will still be here tomorrow anon, take care of your obligations.</br>  <br>Standard procedure is to pay animators one ramen noodle per frame drawn. <br>That's why TV anime would often fall into QUALITY, since they were under extremely tight deadlines to shit out as many frames as possible.<br>KyoAni has been famously paying its artists by the hour, allowing for a slightly less stressed work output. Still often looks like shit since most of the animators are female, but you take what you can get.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. Most bodily fluids are close to pH neutral, unless you've got something wrong with you.</br>    <br>Screwing on a pile of tomatoes, throwing tomatoes at each other while screwing, licking tomato paste off each other,  inserting a whole tomato in her anus , etc</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  I never understood the extreme fascination /a/ had for LWA, I just don't get it.  Did everybody use their real fucking names? Where's the Nig Ger Dix?  When will Diana admit her yuri?  <br> Not really. <br>yes really<br>vaginal pH is typically 3.5 to 4.5.</br></br></br>  That furby  <br>of course you don't anon, you're just a fagoot.</br>  <br>Suck a dick, pinko scum.</br>    <br> Mohammed Malik <br>kek</br></br>  were all of you watching this with a hand on your dick? it wasn't that good, it was just okay  <br> tfw misread Guckin as "Cuckin" <br>I spend too much time here.</br></br>  Watching this made me really happy. It sounds dumb, but it made me feel joy in a way so few anime have. I'm so glad I backed and believed in them.  <br>Those names are the $300+ tier, probably not too many jokers in that bunch.</br>  When did this happen? I din't even know there was going to be a LWA2 in the first place.  I didn't know Akko was gay for Sucy.  <br><br>It's literally NOTHING special.</br></br>  <br>Lurk moar, faggot.</br>  <br> feel joy in a way so few anime have. <br><br>Maybe you just have shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br> Gameboy <br> Tamagotchi <br> Furby <br> SNES </br></br></br></br>  Full show when?  <br>uh, anon</br>  <br>And the tamagotchi too.</br>  Them thighs  I want to fuck Akko.  <br>neo-/a/ loves niwaka gaijin friendly not-anime type shit</br>  <br>They could've at least alphabetized it but yeah... what  said.</br>  <br>That rarely works for screencaps so fuck off.</br>  <br>goodTaste/10</br>  Here's some more.

I don't see why this isn't stickied in /co/ but in /a/.</br>  <br>Fucking Oli</br>  Thank you, based Trigger, for saving anime once again.  <br><br> devil "the boner snake" dante <br> abdullah al-moushari </br></br></br>  how much did the russian state orchestra donate to the kickstarter?    <br> for saving anime <br>You mean cartoons.</br></br>  <br> ban evading <br>You need to leave.</br></br>  Which witch would you tie up naked and throw tomatoes at?  <br><br>I just realized yesterday it's a portmanteau of egg-friend</br></br>  <br> Jesus Gomez </br>    <br> implying <br>If this is considered anime, then so is whatever the french, koreans, and chinese make as well.</br></br>  <br> Kyonko <br>Heh.</br></br>  <br> Inferno Cop </br>  <br>It's a common spic name. They pronounce it "hey-soos."</br>   Harry Potter reference for your new anime <br>Trigger confirmed for bros</br>  <br> dem short shorts <br> not fanservice <br>Sure thing, normie, I'm going to fap.</br></br></br>  <br>actually not that unusual , a lot of Hispanics name their kids Jesus for one reason or another.</br>  <br>Footjob, sumata, leg lock</br>  New torrent plx  <br>No, just confirmed for gaijin pandering.</br>  <br> Inferno Cop <br>Trigger, you can't back your own show</br></br>  <br> gg fansubs </br>  <br>huke too?</br>  Did anyone upload it to mega?  <br>This is my first reply to this cancerous thread and I'm ban evading.<br>If this is anime then why you faggots don't let me have a √îban star racers thread in /a/. This is the same shit. take your cancer back to /co/.</br></br>  <br>fuck off</br>  <br>Did Don Francisco appear in the credits?<br><br><br> koreans, chinese <br>They only do outsource work.<br> the french <br>It's only anime when it's headed by the elevens.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Devil "The Boner Snake" Dante <br><br>holy fuck, I don't know why I laughed so hard.</br></br></br>  Hopefully i like to think the some ~4000 people who backed it enough to get a copy of the film simply wanted a way to watch it more outside the time frame of it online. Like ideally i want to believe the people torrenting it did drop the money already and are not hurting the potential sales. It was well worth the money.  <br> It's only anime when it's headed by the elevens. <br>You obviously didn't read what I was implying.</br></br>  <br> "hey-soos" <br> not "Hey, Zeus" <br>You had one fucking job, nigger.</br></br></br>  <br> This episode is brought to you by: The color blue </br>  <br>Attentionwhoring, even in death.</br>  <br>What else in there?<br>Game Boy, Tamagatchi, SuperFami, don't recognize the wand, Walkman...</br></br>  Technomage is best witch, pass it on.  <br>Blue from /a/, though I'm not sure he posts with the name anymore.</br>  <br>No one cares what you think</br>  <br>Why is this the only time /a/ is against torrenting. Fuck off with the hypocrisy. Everyone should download the HorribleSubs release and only buy the BD if they liked it.</br>  Post your favorite background witches  <br>You were implying nonsense. Go whine in a Ninja Slayer thread, or make an Aku no Hana thread and shitpost about how Japan has fallen to Western standards.</br>  <br> Why is this the only time /a/ <br> implying /a/ is in this thread <br>This is normalfag central my friend.</br></br></br>  <br><br>but it's ok to torrent everything else? They had the production paid for completely, they aren't losing anything. Any sale is a bonus.</br></br>  I ship  Akko X Lotte   <br>I torrented it without paying.<br>What are you going to do bitch.</br></br>  <br>I remember seeing him a few months ago but nothing since. Did he died?</br>  Thank you trigger for show tomatos in face and that ducking stool. <br><br>Its as close as we're going to get to WAM stuff with dunk tanks fully animated in /a/.</br></br>  OST when?  <br>I ship  LWA2 BDs in August, thanks for the support </br>  <br>Lotte</br>  Quick stitch of all backers.  <br>And that's why they fucked up by sticking it in /a/. This should go in /co/ where it belongs. Also yuri pandering in an already backed OVA, Kek Trigger you're not selling high so why are you trying to get the panderbux?</br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br>If I'm not mistaken, he's still around.  meguca  maybe.</br>  Watched at the premiere today, sitting outside an event hall torrenting this on my phone because I want to watch it again; it was that good.   Witch Knight <br><br>Whatever that is, I want to watch it.</br></br>  <br>You're a sick man  and my nigga .</br>  There goes my ONE THOUSAND DORRARS.<br><br>No regrets, of course.</br></br>  Now we just need Little Gentlemen Academia  I want to marry Lotte.  <br>Shit meant to quote </br>  <br> GARfunkel <br> Edward <br>...heh.</br></br></br>  <br>All $300+ backers.<br>We paid good money to get our names there.</br></br>  <br> Diana's groupies will never belittle your penis </br>  <br>there will be people who choose to torrent or stream or find an uploaded version online that never intended to buy the physical copy. There will be plenty of people, me included, who watch the ova online and then buy the bluray when it becomes available</br>  <br>Uh huh...</br>  someone has a webm with fatty-chan and the catapult? That scene was glorious.  COLLIN, WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THIS THREAD. SPEAK UP.  was the first ova this devoid of music? Half the time it just felt really "empty" listening to Akko's voice over and over again without the whimsical music in the background.  So is horriblesubs better than the first one that got deleted. Downloaded both and which one should I watch?  <br>OVA three plot confirmed?</br>  <br>You already did, but here's another.</br>    <br>It's the same version. They just reuped it.</br>  <br>what about the subs are they identical?</br>  <br>Un-glassed eyes...!</br>  <br>Ask and you shall receive.</br>  <br> Cute no-glasses face </br>  <br>Shiny Chariot versus Witch Knight, with antics from the girls meanwhile? Or maybe Akko (as Shiny Chariot) versus Diana (as Witch Knight)?<br><br>There really needs to be one last finale. A trilogy would be perfect.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>And now male version w/ headphones</br></br></br>  <br>why shouldn't they be. This isn't fansubbed, it's the official subs distributed to the KS donators.</br>  <br>awesome, I love it.</br>  <br><br>Maybe she's Lotte's Chariot.</br></br>  <br> unironically implying yuri sells </br>  <br>i thought they are hard subbed</br>  <br> one last finale <br> not a 2 cour series </br></br>  <br><br>Not to mention the official subs are hardcoded, so there's no point in trying to lay out a new subtitle track.</br></br>   paying for anime <br>Am I on reddit?</br>   No "A believing heart is your magic" <br>You had one job, Trigger</br>  <br>Yuri hints sell. Madoka sold like crazy and so did K-On. Trigger wanted in on some of those panderingbux.</br>  <br>The quality wouldn't be the same, we'd get some ninja slayer animation</br>  <br>A trilogy of OVAs and then a series is fine too.<br><br>Learning more about the school and the other characters while they go on misadventures would be able to span quite a few episodes.</br></br></br>  <br>DASA!</br>  IS there an OST download?  <br>In this case not paying for it actually means it's not getting made.<br>If they didn't hit the KS goal it wouldn't of been created in the first place.</br></br>  <br> panderingbux <br>Added to filter.</br></br>  <br>It's weird, I had the same thought, though no outline to make that comparison.</br>  <br>Thank you! I really enjoyed your movie.</br>  Kinky.  <br> Wanting a TV series from Triiger. <br>If the OVA which took years to do looks OK at best in the first half then imagine how bad the tv anime would look. Maybe even lower than Ninja Slayer and they won't be even doing it ironically.</br></br>  <br>They sold for reasons not related to yuri.</br>  <br> kill la kill  looked good</br>  <br>Don't engage him</br>  <br>Explain LL then. Yuri hints sell in Japan. That's what Trigger wanted to which is a shame because the first OVA was better without all this nonsense.</br>  <br>That's why I originally said a trilogy of OVAs. They can amass the funds via Kickstarter again, take their time with it and have it look equally as good as LWA2 or potentially better.<br><br><br>You're going to get a lot of flak for that, especially with certain episodes and CG.</br></br></br></br>  I just got back from work.<br><br>Any update on when HD is being uploaded to nyaa?</br></br>    <br>It's a pet project, so I could see a kickstarter-backed trilogy OVA. <br>Plot-wise, Witch Knight would be someone other than Diana, given that small spiel about her family heritage. Is WK even current, or bygone like Chariot?</br></br>  <br>Nice fallacy.</br>  <br>no<br><br>it's a webm<br><br>webm is best</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy fucking legs</br>  <br>At the anime expo premiere the speaker had a shirt that said Pixar animation on the left side if his chest</br>  <br>Say you're right and it does sell. All Trigger did was make a decision to give some fanservice to the majority who would like it, seeing as how it's popular and sales-driving. In other words they don't care about you, the minority, so cry more.</br>  <br>Try reading some manga, there's a shit ton of comfy stuff in fantastical settings<br> Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou <br> Aria <br> Dead Dead Demons Dedededestruction <br> Kyoukai Senjou no Rinbo </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>As main director you mean? <br><br>Because he's worked as lead animator and episode director on more than one TV show</br></br></br>  <br>And Sucy collects it all and sells it off on some sketch site.</br>  i like how the giant got cute at the end.<br><br>Everything was comfy.</br></br>  <br>Japs wear shirts with random English on them all the time.</br>  <br>Love YKK. So pleasant.</br>  <br>Kek. You know this OVA is stained by the yuribait because Trigger wants some mire money when it could've been better without it but you will always defend it won't you Triggerdrone?</br>  <br> You had one job, Trigger </br>  <br>If I remember correctly, they didn't change that much (or at all) in the BDs, right? There was a lot of questionable animation for KlK. Never watched Inou Battle but I imagine that was decently animated.</br>  <br> yuribait <br> Triggerdrone <br>Gave yourself away pretty quickly, didn't you?</br></br></br>  <br> Inferno Cop <br>Yes<br> gg fansubs <br>No</br></br></br></br>  The fuck is this girly moe shit? I heard it was made by Trigger so I excpected something awesome and manly like KLK. Fucking false advertising moe bullshit.  <br>Here's your reply</br>  <br><br> shitposting in a sticky </br></br>  <br>KLK was manly?</br>  <br>And I don't care about them either. I didn't back their shit. I torrented it and uploaded it on other torrent trackers so that people find it easier to dl.<br>It's just laughable how people proclaim that Trigger cares about what they do and animate when in reality are no different than any other studio that does design by committee.</br></br>  <br>I know this is bait but<br> implying Trigger aren't the biggest yurifags </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>years ago Gainax actually paid a visit to Pixar. Safe to say they love each other very much.</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  Best girl. I'd fund LWA3 if we got more of her in it.  <br>Is that Shigeru Miyamoto with a wig?</br>  Based. Fucking. Trigger.<br><br>That sakuga everywhere. Pure animation porn.</br></br>  <br>People like yuri pandering so they gave it to them. What exactly is the problem again? Sounds to me like you're just  triggered. </br>  <br>Why is Saber such a slut?</br>  <br>Honestly, I'm glad they subverted expectations with all three of those girls. They seemed like a group that would be at ends with the original three until you actually saw them interact. Even the Constanze, without any verbal interactions, came off different than expected. I thought she would be somewhat similar to Sucy's attitude.</br>  Who is best Little Witch?  <br>The robot.</br>   no panties <br>Oh my.</br>  <br>Because she know how to please men.</br>  <br>Did they fuck?</br>  Sushi pls  <br>she is a cutie you monster</br>  Blewit indeed.  <br>Those are brooms.</br>  Did I miss something? Why is everyone talking about yuri pandering?<br><br>The scene with Akko being a guinea pig?</br></br>  <br> faggot mod stickying triggershit <br>fuck I miss moot</br></br>  <br>Sucy confirmed for degenerate.</br>  When did Akko and Sushi slip eachother love potion without the other knowing, then because they were already in love it had no effect?  <br><br>like rabbits.</br></br>  <br>That's Akko in the foreground.</br>  <br>One of them is Akko conducting the brooms.<br><br><br> Why is everyone talking about yuri pandering? <br>It's baiting, pay them no mind.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really really want to believe those are riding high spats, not shadows.</br>  <br> he wouldn't fuck a broom </br>  <br>I like how you can watch t whole thing and say there is no homobait in this. Free wasn't homobait too right?</br>  <br>Ha!</br>  <br> wouldn't of </br>  Shadow or see-through spats?  <br>Kill la Kill was good and Ninja Slayer is fun. Inou was a meh adaption of a meh source. Most of Triggers work is at least above average at the very least which is more than you can say for most studios.</br>  It feels almost like a TV show rather than another movie. In a good way though. It feels comfy rather than grandoise.  <br>anon hes probably not good enough for nvidia</br>    <br>She does know there's a patent on this kind of thing, right?<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8tab<wbr>9C3GW3U</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> witches <br> not sluts <br>None of them wear panties.</br></br></br>  <br>This.

The everyday lives of the nine super-powered siblings of the royal family are monitored by more than 200 surveillance cameras and broadcast nationwide. The people of the nation who are watching the broadcast will have the ability to elect the next monarch. Akane is the third-oldest sister who can manipulate gravity. She is shy and desperately does not want to be caught on camera.  Seems that maybe me and OP will watch the stream since anyone being silent about this show.<br><br>Oh well.</br></br>  <br>Was watching the Laplace stream, besides there's still an hour to go and that sabage show in 30.</br>  <br>Yeah, I was pretty excited for this show, I'm sort of confused as to why nobody else is. Unless &gt;Laplace. <br><br>Also, is it just me or is CC down?</br></br></br>   HanaKana as the lead <br>Oh well, I did watch and enjoy Saekano despite Matsuoka.<br><br>I'm good to go.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, I checked the archive and found that CC is dead. RIP</br>  Akane is the cutest, Scarlet Bloom too<br><br><br>CC has been dead for a while unless he came back without me noticing. Neetball is the new. <br><br>As to why people aren't interested, no idea honestly. It's a kirara series so I expected a few more maybe, though it only has something like 3 chapters translated so maybe that's why.</br></br></br></br></br>  Shuu and Satou are best OTP. Kanade's a cutie too.  <br>Maybe because subs are not ready for new season</br>  <br>Shouldn't stop people usually, there's plenty of things being discussed that still only have funi for subs.<br><br>Some group might pick it up after it's aired too. No idea who though.</br></br></br>  <br>Funi hasn't even released any of their new simulcasts this season.</br>  Don't worry anon, I'm in for this  <br>And stuff is still being talked about? There's plenty of people on /a/ who watch the livestreams. I'm watching it right now.</br>  Manga is finally scanlated. First 3 chapters are out since yesterday  <br> I'm watching it right now. <br>I thought it didn't start until like 20 more minutes</br></br>  So wait which stream should I be watching? Sorry I haven't watched a livestream for a while so no idea where I should be looking.  <br><br>People can't really talk much about the shows without subs, don't you notice how /a/ is slow as fuck, new season /a/ is usually fast</br></br>  <br>Who picked it up?</br>  <br>Some survival game show is on, it's alright. This is on after.<br><br><br>People still talk about the source and just random shit. This is strangely slower than a lot of other stuff. Faster than some things though.<br><br><br>Neetball</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I see channel offline at Neetball is that right?

Why doesn't Akane just wear pants?    <br>Pants aren't kawaii</br>    Man, this show looks retarded already.  why is misaki such a slut?    <br>Has to appeal in some way because she's got nothing else. All her clones are excellent in specific ways and she's just average in every way.</br>  That was actually better than the manga    <br>She can split herself into a load of copies<br>Imagine the possibilities</br></br>  <br>The girls are cute, which is enough for me. But the QUALITY and plot is retarded, I agree</br>    Is the monarchy and power gimmick really needed. It feels like this could stand on its own if it was just a SoL.  end card  <br>Yeah it did a good job of introducing the powers. You don't learn some of them in the manga for a while if I'm remembering right. Next episode is Satou, excellent.<br><br>End illustration by Harikamo too, guess kirara might be trying to push their manga.</br></br></br>  <br>If it wasn't the for the King competition and their superpowers what would the story be? Just a slice of life about a huge family?</br>    <br> QUALITY <br>Looked fine to me honestly, unless you're that autistic over CG cameras.</br></br>  <br>such lewd body</br>  <br>What's the problem with that? It's not like we've had a fuckhuge family SoL before.<br><br>Though don't get me wrong, I don't really mind it that much. I just personally would have preferred if it didn't have it is all. Still good fun.</br></br></br>  I feel like the monarchy is unneeded, that as a large family with powers it would work. The monarchy is retarded. They have all this money, yet come home to a small home instead of a mansion, and have family dinners where the mom cooks. Its like masturbation material for the "average Japanese family", as if that's the best way to live.  <br>Akane is my favourite, but oh god Misaki is so hot<br><br><br>Camera's looked fine honestly, they even blended in fairly well which is strange for CGI. Drones looked a bit dodgy when she first created them. Not something that ruins the episode though.</br></br></br></br>   AOTS   OP: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>wd3ue<br>ED: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>wd3x0</wbr></br></wbr>  this is probably shit but I love the character designs. How are they so good?  <br>Same guy who did twintails. <br>I don't think it's that shit, but I did import the manga a while back so I'm a little biased maybe.</br></br>  Is somebody saving us from Funi?  <br>Why the fuck do would you need all that space anyway?

Did they do some yuri?  <br>Less fighting and less obnoxious characters.</br>  <br>There's some QUALITY, but its IMS, so that's to be expected. I don't remember if there's any Yuri.

Anything in particular?</br>  <br>Oh god that's even better.  I probably should have caught that earlier as chuuni HanaKana was mentioned in this thread. </br>  S-subs where?  <br>They had practice with the author's style through the Twintails anime. The shots they have of Akane are much lewder here than they were in the manga.</br>  <br>Heh, I don't have problem with monarchy and superpowers in this anime. If you want to watch anime with family, just watch something like Sazae-san, Chibi Maruko-chan, Shinchan, Atashinchi, or Kyouran Kazoku Nikki.</br>  <br>Don't just assume things out of your ass, idiot.</br>  <br>  </br>  <br>Highschool Spanish, don't fail me now!</br>  <br> not vaguely understanding Japanese, learned through associating sounds with words, enough in order to have a basic understanding of what's going on the scene, then using visuals to further your understanding </br>  <br>http://animeflv.net/ver/joukamachi-<wbr>no-dandelion-1.html<br><br><br> not speaking spanish, english and vaguely understanding japanese </br></br></br></wbr></br>  I'm shocked this hasn't been done earlier.  <br> not learning 6 different languages in order to consume Japanese media at the soonest moment. (Those languages being Chinese, Korean, Spanish, Japanese, French and Russian) </br>  <br>b-but you only need japanese then<br> korean, french, russian <br>Do they have a big sub community?</br></br></br>  <br>Not really, but sometimes they get raws and translations faster than our communities. Russians love to put stuff online illegally, also.</br>  <br>I'm quite upset that I didn't even think of it.</br>  <br>Pretty sure they would. Spent a year abroad in Korea and one of my roommates was a korean weaboo. Watched his shows same week they aired and the officially translated LN business there was exploding with series. I think they get their books like a month or two after the release of the original in japan.</br>  Best girl coming next week.  <br>Why was I under the impression that her hair was pink all this time?</br>  <br>Same here. That said, why does this anime studio always fuck with the source material?</br>  Is this incest?  <br>Are you incest?</br>  When will HS come out? Or Do we have to wait for some groups pick it up?  subs wheeeeeeeeeeeeeere  <br><br>Thank Funi for this.</br></br>  I'm not a raw watcher but how yuri is this? I know there's a guy but he doesn't seem relevant from the promo so I have high hopes since the girls are 2qt and iirc this is published in Kirara.  <br>hardly yuri except some cute sister bondings</br>  <br>Wrong, she wants to fuck her brother.  Also fuck off spicshit. </br>  <br>Think we will see that animated?</br>  <br>There's no yuri but lots of incest.</br>  If Haruka can calculate the chance of anything, wouldn't he already know who will be king?  <br> inb4 the TWEEST is that he was final boss all along </br>  So the shota wants to fuck the loli, there's some pinkhaired twincest and the MC has a thing for her brother too?  Picked the fuck up   Did Haruka calculate the chance of grabbing Akane's ass?   not expecting incest in a royalty  <br><br>Royalty are notoriously known for inbreeding so this shit isn't a big deal anyway.</br></br>  <br>why doesn't she wear spats</br>  <br>Only sluts wear spats.</br>  <br>sluts don't wear (no) panties?</br>  How come the teleportation dude is the least popular? What did he do?  <br>Make muh dick bigger</br>  <br>Calculations depends on present state of affairs. You'll see some fun keikakuing around it during his focus episode.</br>  <br>He doesn't care.<br><br> As long his waifu votes for him. </br></br></br>  bump if I can  Did Shuu always have a fucked up leg? Never noticed it in the manga. I wonder if it'll pop up in volume 3, or maybe it ties in with what Kanade seems to be indebted to him for.  Subs when?  <br>The anime stuff they've done so far is a better opener than the manga is. So long as they don't meddle later on now that introductions are done it should be alright.<br><br><br> If I say we should work together I have 100% chance to grab her ass <br> Ë®àÁîªÈÄö„Çä </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of the 3 translated chapters out right now, I don't think it was ever brought up. Is the second half content of episode even the same as in the manga? Because I don't remember any teddy-bear competition.</br>  <br>No they've changed a bit to introduce them all I guess. Orders changed a bit too if we're seeing Satou next chapter. <br><br>Can't remember anything about Shuu's leg either. I remember something about Kanade and Shuu in there but I can't remember what it was, probably just Kanade liking Shuu. I'll have a proper look later.</br></br></br>  Just read this thread from beginning, why yurifags think this will be yuri? Are they retarded?  <br>Don't worry, we're being blessed with Satou next week.<br><br>Has that chapter been translated yet? Think it's a bit far into vol1</br></br></br>    <br>They always are.</br>  <br>Nothing, but that's why really. Teru and Shiori get votes for being cute.</br>  Subs when?  <br>Pretty sure it will be a few days at the least.</br>  <br>Spanish subs are out  I don't know I'm some percent Spanish and I think I got the general vibe on what is going on </br>      This show sucked fat donkey dick.  <br>Aren't Spanish subs usually horrendous anyway?</br>  <br>Yeah</br>   spic subs before english subs <br>Get your shit together fansubbers.</br>  <br>They've been out before English quite a few times in the past, the problem is they're usually really bad.</br>  fansubbing is DEAD  <br>Good.</br>  <br>It has been for a while. <br><br>Heil Funi + Crunchyroll!</br></br></br>  <br>Fansubbing was a mistake<br>-Koda</br></br>  <br>The boys look cuter than the grils.</br>  brb learning spanish  <br>Misaki is pretty hot</br>  <br>Eagerly waiting for Hana though Kanade can be pretty adorable too.</br>  <br>Imagine having all her copies except the one that goes for Haruka</br>  Bump for subs.  <br>Double bump for subs</br>  bump for justice   licence too many shows just to beat the competition <br> delays everywhere because the slaves they employ aren't used to the workload <br> awful quality subs because who the fuck needs QC, the retards who pay for this shit won't even notice </br></br>  I just want my twincest dammit  <br>At least if they do this they'll die soon.</br>  bampu  How much QUALITY was there?<br><br>Does it live up to the manga?</br></br>  <br>there was a fair amount <br>not terribly noticeable, though</br></br>  So I got my hands on the chapters after volume 2. Looks like Shuu having an injured leg does tie in with Kanade. Needless to say, Shuu is a 15/10 onii-chan. And Kanade getting jelly over Hana is cute as fuck.  <br>Any yuri in it?</br>  <br>yuri yuri yuri yuri yuri yuri <br>that's everything anyone wants to know about this fucking show. <br>that and &gt;where are subs</br></br></br>  <br> tfw people actually believe they're helping the anime industry by subscribing to funi <br>Kill me now.</br></br>  <br>Can you post some examples of QUALITY? I didn't see any. Except I wish they hadn't used that shot of them flying towards the castle in the OP, that looks shit.<br><br><br>Got some scans? If you fancy dumping go ahead but I'll get the third volume anyway when it's out soon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I swear to God, where do you fags come from?</br>  <br>They never stop asking, do they<br><br><br>I attach a picture of some quality. Enjoy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just generic shitposters posting "is this yuri?" in every thread because they know /a/ hates yuri.</br>  <br>Well excuuuuse me, I saw the promo art and saw lots of girls in it, it's also published in Kirara so I wanted to be sure</br>  <br>Have some more. If you think the faces are well-done for a first episode, then god help you.</br>  <br>It's happening in a lot of threads lately it seems.</br>  <br> it's also published in Kirara <br>Kirara publishes a bunch of series that have straight romance and/or don't focus on yuri. This means nothing.</br></br>  <br><br>I think you're being a bit overzealous with the QUALITY calling. They're absolutely tiny on the screen. Like the kind of people who pause at inbetweens and go "QUALITY"</br></br>  <br>When there's not much on the screen, it's hard to miss. Sure, the main characters look fine, but I like to actually look at what I'm watching. It's just standards. <br><br>But then again, we're all watching anime.</br></br></br>  bump for subs  <br>Please don't just let the thread die if there's no discussion or subs</br>  <br>Please do use proper punctuation.</br>  Any minute now.  <br>I got the Kirara magazines but I'll see what I can do.</br>  <br>Ah nice. Don't worry about scanning then if it's too much of a hassle, vol3 is only a month and a bit away so it might reach me by the time the season ends.</br>  subs never  <br>Learn Japanese.</br>  <br>learn spanish</br>  <br><br>Learn English.</br></br>  <br><br><br>START WITH THE GREEKS</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nigger, I'll bump all I want.</br></br>  <br>Very well.</br>  <br>the pink haired ones were the twins?</br>  <br>Yes?</br>  <br>Are we ever going to get it back, do you think?

It's not that hard. Everyone else in the world can do it. Why can't they?  They probably have to fix that declining birthrate first  <br> What would it take to teach the Japanese to write good characters, plots and how to write a good third act to a story? <br>Probably to tell their shit populous to stop eating up terrible writing. Why bother writing decent stories if people will still buy the shit ones?</br></br>  <br>I'd fix that declining birth rate if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>Because they're bad at business models. Just look at Nintendo and Konami. Japs can't into making consumers happy and make money off of it. Isn't Kancolle like, not making a profit?</br>  <br>If you are using Spongebob as a benchmark, that show has turned to complete shit since it's old writers disappeared or Nickelodeon assumed control or something. Anyways it's not a good jump off point.</br>  <br>There's plenty of good characters, plots and good third acts. There's also many more shitty characters, plots and third acts. Just filter out the shit, it's not that hard. Or revel in the shit, spread it over your body, become a shitslut, it's more enjoyable.<br><br>As for why there's so much bad writing in anime... people keep eating it up, I guess?</br></br></br>  <br> Everyone else in the world can do it. <br>Western media isn't any better than anything you insult nippon media for doing.</br></br>  <br>Western society has made 99.99% of all the greatest classics in literature, film, television and all other mediums. The other 0.01% is divided among the near eastern and far eastern societies with Japan getting only a handful of those. Very, very few considering its relatively large population.</br>  <br>Both of those companies are moving away from the money pit that is retail videogames.</br>  <br> Everyone else in the world can do it </br>  <br>That's because what gets to be a classic is decided by the West as well</br>  <br>Hi how are ya?</br>  <br>If garbage like Type-Moon is what the Nips buy nowadays then teaching them how to write well will kill their industry.</br>  <br>for that to happen /a/ would have to stop bitching. Obviously they do it to piss you ungrateful neets off</br>  That would require injecting liquid 'good taste' into all the otakus in japan.  <br>And in between Clockwork Orange and Watt is a trove of forgotten garbage. Saying the best is better is one thing, but in terms of modern media it's all the same entertaining drivel while waiting for the next masterpiece in both Japan and the west, and listening to /co/ freak out when they get a new good cartoon out of the 6 cartoons that come out each year while /a/ has 40 things a season to complain about.</br>  <br>But Japan hasn't produced even one single notable piece of any media since Kurosawa. It's been 30+ years of garbage. And before that was thousands of years of garbage. They had one good guy and nothing else ever.</br>  <br>Quit consuming media targeted at and designed to pander to teenagers.</br>  <br>How about you improve your shit taste and select something good?</br>  <br>0/8</br>  <br>What's your criteria for "notable"? Yojimbo is the only Kurosawa movie that I enjoy (and I guess Seven Samurai's impressive in the directing department), the rest of his work doesn't strike a chord with me at all. <br><br>There's been plenty of genuinely good, moving, entertaining anime. I feel like you're declaring Kurosawa as "notable" just because he's generally accepted as being a master of film, and you're trashing "30+ years" of material - anime included - for no real reason. I can think of a few anime movies and series I'd hold above Kurosawa's work.</br></br></br>  Bad writing is just a meme made by assblasted faggots jealous that some other work is more successful than their favorite  <br>Then how do you explain OreImo?</br>  <br>If you enjoy something, it's good. Simple as that. Just because it doesn't follow your generic formulas for "good writing" doesn't automatically mean it's bad.</br>  <br>But if it turns out to be actually bad, like OreImo?</br>  <br>So many normalfags and newfags lately.<br><br>Sure is summer.</br></br></br>  <br><br> there are people who unironically believe in this crap </br></br>  Read some books by Japanese authors instead of judging their literary ability from their cartoons. I'm not talking about light novels either.  <br>So you're saying OreImo isn't terrible?</br>  Japanese don't write drama in 3 acts. Their culture uses 3-4.<br><br>Read a book maybe?</br></br>  <br> Bad writing becomes good writing even if you don't agree with it being good writing because it gave you enjoyment while you watched it. <br><br>Ok...</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Are you claiming it's impossible for writing to affect my enjoyment of a work? Bad writing is writing I don't enjoy.</br></br></br>  <br>4-5*</br>  <br> implying <br><br>The fact that you watch shit anime doesn't mean that all anime are shit.<br>Fuck off to /co/ with your shit taste.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Have you never heard of the term "so bad it's good"? No one in their right mind would claim that The Room is well written but that doesn't mean that the dialoge is entertaining. Just because people get joy from his movie it doesn't automagically turn Tommy into a good writer or anything like that.</br></br>  <br>fuck off retard for completely missing the point</br>  <br> television <br>English-language television is even more garbage than your average harem.</br></br>  <br>Only a retard would bother addressing a point made by a /co/rndog.</br>  <br>Because greek invented deus ex machina</br>  <br>That's probably because it targets an adult audience. Enjoy your cartoons though.</br>  <br> /co/rndog  <br>that has to be one of most retarded insults i have seen</br></br>  <br>I really don't think so.<br>Japanese can write good characters and good plots.<br>The fact that OP is a retard 16 yo that probably have watched only some mainstream shit like Naruto or SnK or whatever is hip now, that usually have bad character and bad writing, doesn't mean that there aren't very good works produced by nips.<br>Also, please, learn to use capitalization and grammar, your new is showing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's because most of the West's classics are written by dominant Western powers. You do realise the East has classics too? There is some cross-over, but things like Sun Wukong aren't want immediately springs to mind when we think "classic" - despite being as influential as something like King Arthur - because it's influential in an entirely different culture.</br>  <br>That's why it fits so perfectly.</br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #3<br><br>Remember to relax and take it easy<br><br/></br></br></br>  Requesting Tharja in a casual version of her outfit please, or a Mirage interpretation of her.

Stars and strips are the best.</br>  <br>That wasn't me Boa, I already got a delivery.

I haven't gotten to S2 but yeah, that's what I think </br></br></br>  <br>First off, thank you for drawing her, Boa. She looks incredibly cute, and it's all the rigth kinds of patriotic. <br>And sorry about my reference being so bad. I never realized it was poorly made, since I figured just having character sheets and some other images for specific emotions and stuff was all it really needed.<br>I'll try to fix it up.</br></br></br>  <br>I hate S2's art style. It looks dull and lifeless</br>  Requesting Tatsuta  Requesting Momo as a WWII US tanker rejoicing about her first tank kill (the helmet is completely optional), but other ideas would be nice as well. Thanks in advance!<br>References: http://imgur.com/a/5bypJ</br>  <br>That's a fucking taco.</br>  MonMusu thread.<br> Let's Rach! <br>Only one week until we get an anime.</br></br>  <br>It's Sentai Filmworks, of course it wasn't going to be funi.</br>    <br><br> Daisuki to Stream Everyday Life with Monster Girls Anime in Asia, Central/Latin America <br><br>FUCK! this is Dog Days 3 all over again</br></br></br></br>  HAPPY 'MURRICA DAY EVERYONE <br><br> do any of you guys have that picture of Miia tying up her shirt from chapter 3 with the flag behind her? </br></br>  I've never used Daisuki. Is the region-locking insurmountable?  What's the saddest moment in anime?  Valverape    Kotoura san opening goes sad fast in minutes. Maybe not the saddest but after opening that you're defiantly sticking past the filler episodes (not everyones going to love the anime as a whole)  <br>When Mikono  wins </br>        <br>The only thing I remember about it is the  depression .</br>  <br><br>Thanks for making me feel bad</br></br>  <br><br>Wasn't sad so much as it was really disturbing, especially considering a lot of people watched that as young teens.</br></br>  <br>Totally canon.</br>  I was on the verge of tears.<br><br>R.I.P.</br></br>  <br>This, and this  spoiler warning </br>  The fight's over and all is well, but the camera goes back to the cockpit and something just feels wrong. <br>The show then just ends.</br>    <br>This. There have been 5 times that I've cried since I was 10 years old and this was one of them.</br>  When that one chick ran out of O2 on Planetes. Though it was also the dumbest moment,  as she could have switched out the near empty canister for a fresh supply of 02 with the girl she was dragging.   <br>Outlaw Star.<br><br>When Jim got stood up for his date, and never learned why.</br></br></br>  Memna's death in AnoHana.  <br>That fucked with me so hard as a kid<br>goddamn</br></br>  <br>What I felt during this wasn't quite sadness. Honestly, I can't even describe it. Just a full maelstrom of FUCKING FUCK SHIT WHAT.</br>  Only  best girl that both didn't have to die and had to die for the plot.<br>I mean, people already hated Rolo for everything, they didn't have to give us an ultimate reason for it</br>  <br>Not even the saddest moment in the show</br>  <br>And then Rolo's comeuppance comes around and goddamn it, they still managed to make me feel sad for him somehow.<br><br>Code Geass was a rollercoaster I will not forget any time soon.</br></br></br>  The only anime I cried to.  Was 100% not ready for this shit. Even made me drop the anime for like a month.<br><br>And then the episode right after made the tears come out in full force anyway.</br></br>  <br>Saddest part is that it went to shit after that</br>  <br>I don't agree, but we all have different opinions.</br>  <br>I was somewhat bummed out by Euphy's death, she didn't deserve Ledouche being a moron and losing control over the geass.<br><br>But man, Shirley's death really made me feel for her. All she wanted was a world ruled by love, so she went and got shot for it. <br><br> Part of me wants a R3 with a Rebirth theme, since both her and Lulu got deaded, but the end for R2 is pretty much vacuum sealed that it blows away any hope of it </br></br></br></br></br>   anime <br>more like anigay</br>    <br> anigay <br>more like anigay skywalker</br></br>  <br> disliking anime <br>Welcome to /a/, summerfriend!</br></br>  <br> implying this is bait <br>This is a super serious thread</br></br>   more like anigay <br><br>Fair point.</br></br>   op <br>more like GAYp</br>  <br><br>samefig</br></br>   pronouncing it like animay <br>its anime not animei</br>  <br>Yeah, I'm always disturbed about the amount of the gay audience watching anime too.

Best thread on /a/, and that's saying a lot.  <br>This is not snk thread.</br>  <br>I posted a thread here with the intention of having a deep and profound conversation about elements of homosexuality in relation to Japanese animation and the industry surrounding it, but all my efforts are not just being rebuked, but now also dismissed as "shitposting". All my hopes of having a serious, intellectual discussion regarding this subject have been dashed due to the incompetence of the users here. Well, I hope you're fucking happy.

It's the sole super power in the world despite its recent attempts to not be one. Actually, any fictional series set in the future should have all five 5 allies remain relevant.</br>  <br> even greece and canada got in <br>kek.<br>I guess that America doesn't exist anymore in a near future and get conquered by Mexico and Canada.</br></br></br>  <br> all the crap countries that international politicians don't give a shit about </br>  <br> Belgium is on Mars <br>Holy fuck, we exist.</br></br>  Come on the shit is starting, i can feel it.  <br> we're next to curryniggers <br><br>Fuck no.</br></br></br>  <br>Wafels en bier voor iedereen!</br>  CHI CHI CHI LELELE  The American base on mars is the entire other half of the planet  Why can't people be polite and discuss and argument like decent adults in 4chan ?<br>What kind of horrible life can make people so hateful and racist ?<br> It's the inbreeding right ? </br></br>   New Zealand <br> No Australia </br>  <br> No Russia <br> No China  <br> No UK <br> No US <br>So Mars was left to the unimportant countries wasn't it?</br></br></br></br></br>  Also got to love how the Nips place themselves near the middle.

America got wiped off the planet.</br></br>  <br>This is an anime. Japan is the world.</br>  <br>Notice how everyone of the countries displayed on that picture are complete third-world shitholes?<br><br>Not surprising tbh, Americans probably chilling on Jupiter or some shit, a 1st world planet.</br></br></br>  <br> Jupiter <br> 1st world planet </br></br>  <br> Americans probably chilling on Jupiter <br>Why would we want to live on a gas planet</br></br>  <br> imfuckinglpying it isn't <br>Although Saturn has all that jewelery, wouldn't surprise me if the high class first worlders are living there.</br></br>  <br><br>Helium.

All you American's deserve such a wonderful and beautiful planet like Jupiter. Go on, all of you.<br>ALL OF YUOU</br></br></br></br>  Will Germany and Japan try another Reich on mars ?  <br>Racism is inherent. You like being around people like you. It takes effort and time to get used to other cultures and language especially.<br>Liberals love to make it out like you're 'hateful' for just wanting basic human connection. Thats not hate, thats just anxiety. Plus, America has the best military in the history of the world, its not something you can just ignore as another nation when you know that if they really wanted to your entire continent could get its shit pushed in.</br></br>  <br>Hopelijk zijn de Walen uitgemoord.</br>  <br>Yeah and they'll win this time because all the useful countries in the war like Russia, USA, and Britain (lol) are elsewhere.</br>  <br>America won earth and kicked everyone else out</br>  <br> Ivory Coast? <br>What, did Jamal make a rocket out of coffee and banana peels?</br></br>  <br> more junk floating out space </br>  <br>Australia is doing the Death World thing on Mercury. Fucking pansies and their 'atmosphere.'</br>  <br> You like being around people like you. It takes effort and time to get used to other cultures and language especially. <br>m8 not liking people isn't racism. Belief that one race is superior to another is racism. Although I agree libs blow it up way more than it is, don't misconstrue what it actually is either.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm not talking about this anime, i'm talking about the horrible level of discussion that take place every single time other countries are discussed.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, if anything, that's where we want Israel to end up.</br>  <br>China is going I ether broke or civil war in a decade.</br>  <br>No fuck you, they did nothing wrong.<br>Reunification when.</br></br>   Implying USA with far superior Space technology isn't already out being Intergalactic Conquistadors.   <br>This is a future where a class of Japanese students got a budget of 50 billion to build a light single man cruiser. Needless to say the economy is either entirely credit based or the economy size is unfathomable by modern standards.<br>I guess imagine even the poorest is making 80k in todays money or something in order to imagine the kind of spending they would need to keep the whole system running.</br></br>  <br><br>People that shit on entire countries are no better than racists, some people are really convinced that every single human being in a specific country is shit, lazy etc. just because stereotypes.<br>If we had to take stereotypes seriously, america would be the shittiest country on earth composed by the most horrible people you can imagine.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, you're right. You made my own point for me, liberals have changed the meaning of the word around so it got harder to think of it in that way.</br>  <br> Tfw no intergalactic Jews </br>  <br>Its tribalism, everybody thinks their country is the shit and the other a shit. It's human nature, embrace the hatred <br><br><br>NEVER</br></br></br></br>  <br> Walen <br> niks verkeerd gedaan <br>Ge zijt toch niet serieus?</br></br></br>  <br>And Japan is going to be in an economic shithole filled with old people.</br>  <br> last 40 years of breakneck economic development <br> implying it isn't entering a golden age where they make breakthroughs in making their environment unshitty thereby saving earth from the global climate change </br></br>  <br> It's human nature, embrace the hatred <br><br>I leave you the task to accept the flaws of our nature, i will at least try to improve myself.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Let us have Wallonia + FN Herstal and go eat mussels with the Netherlands.</br></br></br>  <br> Belgium  <br> not Flanders </br></br>  <br>Liberals eat away at tribalism. The richer your country, the more hippies you can afford who ignore their national citizenship and just take it for granted that they are safe from foreign aggression despite that taking most of human history to achieve.</br>  <br><br>Well, it's space. The amount of resources available must be unimaginable.</br></br>  <br>I'm Greek and I was laughing my ass off at that.<br>Also,this must be the first time I see our flag in an anime.

Maybe the US ceded the territory as a sign of goodwill?</br>  <br>Their ppp is growing along with inequality, so pressure for democratization along with better distribution and transparency will come.

When off the clock, she's a pure girl who is weak against sexual things.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> The day Mika almost lost her virginity <br>I think Mika would have been the first idol to become a woman. She has been close a few times</br></br></br>  <br>Every single idol in CG is still a virgin, canonically.</br>  <br>Kaede x KWSM OTP</br>  Reminder that in the end Uzuki has to stand alone by herself and become successful by herself as an idol. No danketsu for Uzuki. It's detrimental to her idol growth.  <br><br>Even Ranko isn't safe from the loli cockblock</br></br>  <br>You mean pussy-block, technically.</br>  <br><br>Ranko is a good girl</br></br>  <br>Assuredly a safe assumption.</br>  <br>Her eyes can kill<br>Anya is an absolute beauty</br></br>  gyarus are okay as long as they are pure sluts.  <br>she is japanese</br>  <br>word</br>  Rin is Japan's favorite idol.<br><br>For once, Japan has excellent taste.<br><br>Truly, she is universally considered the best girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Rika is going to be the best</br></br>  <br>Miracle of the universe</br>  <br>Fuck off, Scamco.</br>  <br>Is her being yandere for Producer canon?</br>  <br> Japan only has good taste when it's convenient  <br>Nothing has changed, you just have shit taste</br></br>  <br>she has her snaps from time to time.<br>but it's not yandere more like typical teenager jelly</br></br>  <br>She's more jealous than yandere. Rin cares a lot for her Producer.</br>  There aren't enough Rin x P moments in IM@S. Why isn't Scamco more pandering to this?  <br>Rin is just the jealous type. She's not going to kill anyone over Producer, however she's not going to let other people beat her. Plus it's more of a perversion towards Producer than being yandere in fanworks.</br>  <br><br>Rin is going to fight for HER Producer</br></br>  <br>She'll hold herself back as long as a girl isn't overtly flirting with her Producer.</br>  <br>Rin a cute.</br>  <br>She's canonically perfect</br>  Why is this so lewd?  <br>Nah, she's a filthy mixed breed.<br><br>If you want perfection, check out the girl in OP's picture.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Rin is never going to let P go, never</br></br>  <br>This show literally makes no sense.<br><br>The point of being Cinderella is there is only one. If they're all Cinderellas then none of them are Cinderellas. If Rin's the one with the glass shoe, does that mean she's the one?</br></br></br>  <br> Beauty of a Russian woman <br> Personality and some physical traits of a Japanese woman <br>Perfection</br></br></br>  <br>Well, that's what the upcoming second season is going to settle.<br><br>We're going to find out who the "Cinderella" truly is. Most people think it's either Uzuki or Rin.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to punch Sachi in the tummy.</br>  <br>It's from the anniversary event the same year she was Cinderella Girl, no matter what Scamco thinks, they are all Cinderella.</br>  <br>Have you guys ever thought about how creepy this is? A grown man dating highschoolers?</br>  <br>It's not a grown man dating a high schooler though. It's a high school girl trying to seduce a grown man.</br>  <br>Blood doesn't matter when you're this beautiful, can sing with a great VA to boot, and is essentially 120% wife material.</br>  <br>She'll be facing competition if she goes the yandere route.</br>  <br>Do you even watch the show? First of all, all this ProducerxRin stuff is mostly fanfiction.<br><br>Second, even in the fanfiction, it's never the Producer attempting to hit on Rin. It's always the other way around, with a very reluctant Producer.</br></br></br>  <br> Wife material <br> No defining traits such as motherly, caring, domestic, or desire to have children <br><br>Sure.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anya has been caring to all the idols throughout, to be motherly is close enough to the same thing she can cook as she used to with her mom and grandma and if she was older she'd most likely grow to appreciate having children.</br>  <br><br>That's right<br><br>MikaXP is the only canon that matters</br></br></br></br>    <br>ProducerxRin is something that the anime seems to be pushing, though it's not particularly romantic as a relationship. It is one however that is based a lot on trust and also the two growing alongside each other as Producer and Idol, which can be misconstrued as romantic.<br><br>Honestly, I like it if only because I find it hilarious, though it is rather out of character for Rin. Then again, fanon does become canon for CG at the very least.</br></br></br>  <br>You Kaede x P, cause clearly she knows him too.<br><br><br>I think they're cute together, especially they were hilarious together in episode 1.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Funny that Rin's seiyuu was openly making a move on TakeP and even holding his hand.</br></br>  <br>But she DOES have those traits, some in the anime but mostly in the source materials.</br>  <br> Headcanon: The Post <br>Waifufags are a disease.</br></br>  <br>After carrying Rin and putting her down, Producer inquired as to the origins of a big wet stain on his suit near his waist area that smelled like raw seafood.</br>  <br> Headcanon <br>Besides the last bit which was just an assumption on typical anime women, everything else is from the Anime, NG manga and drama tracks.<br><br> I don't even have a waifu, I just have favorites. </br></br></br></br>  <br> like raw seafood <br>That's some heavenly aroma.</br></br>  BTW the banchou has voice now<br><br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>27851</wbr></br></br>  <br>Based on their game incarnations; among the main 14, the only one with a serious case of being P-sexual with explicit romantic connotation is Chieri.<br><br>The other girls who are teased to have a thing for Producer are: Uzuki, Rin, Ranko and Kirari</br></br></br>  <br>Uzuki I think is more friendly than anything romantic. She's not ready for romance.</br>  <br>I agree. Chieri is definitely P-sexual.</br>  <br>Uzuki and Ranko seem to treat him more like an older but close friend but I don't know about Kirari, I'd say she has the same relationship with him as Miria and Rika do.</br>  <br>I'll never get over how comfy that picture is.</br>  <br>Rin is a disgusting pervert.</br>  reminder alice has more japanese charm that all of those girls that are older than her.    <br><br>I think Uzuki is just too naive to properly recognize her feelings as romantic. She clearly is very fond of Producer and makes exceptions for him. Albeit she doesn't really know the implications of her treatment of him.<br><br>For example, in the voice event associated with her Sukumizu Beach S-Rare card, Producer accidentally lets the floater Uzuki is on wobble and as he tried to get it stable again, he gets a nice closeup of Uzuki's tight Sukumizu tits dripping with water.<br><br>Uzuki bashfully remarks that he shouldn't treat idols this roughly. But she doesn't exactly mind or reprimand Producer for the too close for comfort event just a few moments ago.<br><br>Normally, you'd think Uzuki is the type to go KYAA! or spill Spaghetti all over the place when this happens but she's unexpectedly quite cool about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is it that it's always the stoic/emotionless girls that are made out to be turbo-perverts in fandom?</br>  <br>Gap moe.<br><br>See also.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Emily has more.</br></br>   ultimate in retro-chic <br> so fashionable everyone else hasn't caught up to her yet <br>Most stylish idol.</br></br>  <br>For Rin, it's a combination of her being a dog owner and flower shop owner, which leads to her being a smell fetishist. They pretty much made Rin a dog girl. Because of how funny it actually is, it caught on.</br>  <br>That's just how it works. As the other anon said, gap moe. <br><br><br>Rin's Producer lust is always amusing.</br></br></br></br>    This thread needs more Kaede  <br>Sure.</br>  <br>Is she autistic.</br>    <br>Not really. That scene was just a joke scene anon.</br>  Hopefully Kaede will get more screen time in the second course.  <br>Isn't hallucination a sign of severe alcoholism?<br><br><br>Since you're misusing that word to mean "quirky behavior", no.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Sachiko is property of /jp/</br>  <br>It's a sign that she's having fun with herself.</br>  <br>That explanation is really cute, so it'll do.</br>      Advanced screening starting in 2 minutes. <br><br>Hopefully we'll get some pre-warning about how Lerche is handling episode one on twitter from people who went to see it.</br></br>  They're also autographing shovels, apparently.  <br>Any particular tags I should be watching?</br>  <br>Just search „Åå„Å£„Åì„ÅÜ„Åê„Çâ„Åó on twitter in half an hour or so, I'd say. <br><br>There also might be something on 2ch (http://mastiff.2ch.net/test/read.c<wbr>gi/anime/1435789845/l50), but twitter is the likelier bet.</wbr></br></br></br>  Short silver-haired girl in stockings is so lewd. I'm in love.<br>I haven't read the manga but I hope  she gets gored to death while screaming and crying. </br>  <br> It almost happens on multiple occasions </br>  <br> That may even be better. I just want to see her crying and in pain, so it happening multiple times will only make my dick harder. </br>  <br> I haven't read the manga </br>  <br>Read it now.</br>  <br>I'm going to Japan at the end of next week, so I've been holding off on picking up any new manga until I can buy some volumes while I'm over there.</br>  <br> Zombie apocalypse in a grimdark world <br>God damn. If the lolis dies without HEALING, I'll drop.</br></br>  <br>If you're going to buy it anyway, why not just read it now?</br>  <br>They aren't loli.</br>  <br>Please Jesus can we just not for once?</br>  <br>Because reading off paper volumes that you bought in a shop is so much more satisfying.</br>  <br>You're gonna get spoilered super fucking bad if you don't read the manga and wander into these threads. It's kind of inevitable.<br><br>It actually only takes about a night to catch up to the current chapter and is a fucking fantastic read, so yeah. Same goes for any other lurkers wondering if they could watch the anime and not get spoilered; basically you'd probably have to stay out of the threads altogether.</br></br></br>  Is this yuri?  <br>No. It's full-blown zombie apocalypse.</br>  It's over. Impressions are rolling in on Twitter now. So far all I've been able to glean is that it's heart pounding.  https://twitter.com/search?q=%E3%81<wbr>%8C%E3%81%A3%E3%81%93%E3%81%86%E3%8<wbr>1%90%E3%82%89%E3%81%97&amp;src=typd&amp;ver<wbr>tical=default&amp;f=tweets<br><br>Twitter's getting excited</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr>  https://twitter.com/Tamashari/statu<wbr>s/617238353855934464<br><br>Uh oh.</br></br></wbr>  I really hope I'm google translating some of these tweets wrong.  So is this some Madoka wanabe?  <br>This is the dumbest thing I've heard all day.</br>  <br>The actual mangaka wrote the screenplay for this though, so changes from the original were totally his call to better fit things; I bet he had a goal of having the anime end on Graduation at all costs.<br><br>Besides some of the early chapters weren't exactly good in my honest opinion; it kind of dragged for a bit while waiting for the "fucking duh" moment of Miki joining.</br></br></br>  Cute<br><br><br>How so?</br></br></br>  <br>Yui is cute!</br>  <br> tfw you'll never have a megu-nee tulpa </br>  <br>Believe, anon!</br>  <br>That doesn't say that Miki is with the group from the beginning, does it?</br>  <br>Megu isn't dead. Miki starts out with them. That one girl no one knew is the MC. It's terrible.</br>  <br> That one girl no one knew is the MC. It's terrible. <br>Dropped.</br></br>  <br>That's what I gathered.<br><br><br>Now that I don't believe.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Miku's with the group since the beginning. <br> The reveal at the end of the episode hit harder than the manga's. </br></br>  <br>Well, if you want to see her suffer, you're  in luck. </br>  <br> That one girl no one knew is the MC. <br>Explain why she's not in any promo art then.</br></br>  Just read the latest chapter.<br> Rii rescued her little sister in a swarm full of zombies, who survive months just by hiding  <br><br>Fucking bullshit.</br></br></br>  Twitter's responses seem for the most part very positive. Even with some changes to the manga's plot, the anime is looking like it'll be good.  <br>No shit it's bullshit. Think harder.</br>  <br>It's the teddy bear anon, she's just delusional. Why do you think Yuki is the only one to react while Kurumi and Miki look on worryingly?</br>  <br>Maybe don't skim through it so quickly next time.</br>   Finally get a loli <br> I-It's just a bear! <br>Fuck that shit. I won't believe it until it's 100% confirmed.</br></br>  <br>I'm much more worried that she got fucking bitten in the process and was expecting to see a mark revealed anytime. What does she even do about zombies again? I don't even remember if she uses the flares a lot or had some noise maker, basically only Miki and Kurumi can actually hold their own alone so I assume full and well that Rii's fucked.</br>  <br>Please don't start.</br>  <br>Is this moe/yuri shit?</br>  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>She hoses down zombies early on to save Kurumi, and she uses the glowsticks constantly.</br>  <br>Yes, better leave now.</br>  <br>Alright, thanks anon, I'll stay far away from this garbage.</br>  <br>Start what? I'm not calling the rest of them lolis like the shitposter. Ruu is a loli though.</br>   https://twitter.com/MAJ_Karso/stat<wbr>us/617241201838718976</wbr> <br> loose character animation <br>Google translates "yuru" as "loose", so I'm not sure if this post referencing the SoL fakeout or bad animation<br><br>Another post used the same "loose" yuru and made it sound like a reference to the SoL fakeout https://twitter.com/efutty/status/6<wbr>17241893605277696</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Glad I could help.</br>  <br> Rii thinks she hears her sister in the room somehow <br> No one else can hear shit no matter how they concentrate, while at the same time Rii is positive she heard someone <br><br>Wouldn't surprise me if Rii is also going looney. Her sister might have never even existed for all we know and she's going schizo or something inventing things; I don't see how she could have gone all this time and totally forget she even fucking existed until just a second ago.</br></br></br></br>  Read the guide before asking questions: http://buyfag.moe  Has any anon here remastered a prize fig by painting it, for example turning a sega prize fig into a FREEing tier fig?  <br>Hope they fixed her defects from initial release.<br><br>Anywhere with Chito still up for preorder other than 1999co?</br></br></br>  I wish to know how to deal with these certain black scratch marks on a figure.<br><br>Do you have to paint over it or is there another way around it?<br><br> Or simply, just live with it and cry? </br></br></br></br>  <br>magic eraser</br>  <br>Are you talking about this?</br>  Symphogasm/10  Is it possible that crack-kun is a redditor, is that why he types like a fucking retard?    <br>Nah, he's just autistic.</br>  I was wondering why CR/Funi didn't pick this up, then I started imagining how much licensing costs would be for Nana Mizuki, Aoi Yuuki, Youko Hikasa and Yuka Iguchi simultaneously.  <br>They won't pick it up because too much effort to sub songs</br>  You get to jump into any one universe to try and be THE BEST.<br><br>Which universe do you choose?</br></br>  <br>*ignition<br>I havent saw InuYasha and what about chaos dragon it looks digimonish first ep has aired</br></br>  <br> Rigel best girl </br>  <br>The kiddy SMT game did get an anime.</br>  <br><br>delet this<br>digimon logo is disgusting dub version<br>shamefur dispray</br></br></br></br>  <br> bug <br> having a skeleton </br></br>  So /a/ here is a question:<br><br>Wich is the show/shows you know that were utter shit but you still enjoyed it anyways ?<br><br>For me :<br><br> Fairy tail <br><br> Owari no Seraph <br><br> IIWTTPUGIAD   SO MUCH </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Samflam wasn't a bad show.
