[ A-1 [spoilerKae[/spoiler]delivers<br>TakeP smile status: PROTECTED</br>  So much Kaede today.  Someone remembered their promise.  post em up boys  Does anyone know if that japanese blogger that lurks here (and other sites) sometimes, posted anything about us being hype for S2 yet?  <br> Smile Protected </br>  Kaede-san...  I wanted to hate Mio like the rest, but I grew to like her.<br><br> Plus she built for sex and can be coerced easily. </br></br>  Why Mio so talented?<br>Will you buy her game?</br>  A-1 sure likes getting meta with their story set-ups.<br><br> Mio up in arms about girls getting cancelled/delayed debuts <br><br> CM1 batch news released <br> Most are puzzled as to why Kaede was one of the first chosen for a voice when there were several idols with more popularity than her at the time. <br> Koi Kaze was well received although her following was still comparatively small. <br> Years later <br> Kaede gradually grew into one of the most popular and beloved idols in CG <br> Episode is about not forgetting about where you started from </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Mio is a good girl.</br>  <br>that's the face of someone that has sucked a thousand dicks</br>  <br>Go sleep, Verty.</br>  I want to read books with Fumi.  Which idol would you produce?  I'm left wanting more.  <br><br>Rika, Mika, Ana, Rin, Uzuki, Chuuni, Shy slut, Uzuuki, shit, bigger shit<br><br>In that order.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The NG show is back. Kaede thankfully got to be the extra flavor this episode, but by that she also had much more focus and characerization than the majority of the cast got, especially Chieri/Kanako/Rika/Miria who continue to be ignored.<br>Fucking A-1 has really done it for good this time, no hope for improving.</br></br>  <br>Anya, Mio, Mika, Rika, Ranko, Uzuki, Rin, Chieri, Anuz</br>  <br>Mandatory<br><br><br> Mio, Anya, Mika, Ranko, Rika </br></br></br></br>  Here we go again.    <br>I like you<br>Never seen another Anya/Mio top two</br></br>    <br><br> What Mishiro does on her off time </br></br>   Shining Brightly Like A Star. <br><br>Sasuga top idol!</br></br>  <br>I made that chart specially for Miho, so it applies for CG only, and is obviously shopped, but even in regular one, both of them still have their place granted in my Top10.<br><br> This one got kinda obsolete, though </br></br></br>  <br>I don;t eve know what's going on here (i got here through thumbnail on main ) - Who is on the picture ?</br>  <br>name of happy ms meme :^)<br>your welcome</br></br>    <br>Великая Княжна Анастасия Николаевна Романова<br>You're welcome</br></br>  Is there a torrent yet for the latest episode? Just got home from work.  <br>check the usual suspects</br>  <br>where the heck was she packing THOSE?<br> and by THOSE I mean her huge cannons </br></br>  miku a best  <br>repostan</br>    <br> but by that she also had much more focus and characerization than Chieri/Kanako/Rika/Miria who continue to be ignored. <br> continue to be ignored. <br> I'm completely okay with that. All they have to do is stand there and look cute. </br></br></br>  So what's his proposal about? Any ideas?  <br> miss monochrome </br>  <br>My Princess<br>Your welcome</br></br>   wants to focus on marketing overseas <br>Might as well burn the whole building down and kill yourself while you're at it</br>  <br> Wants to increase foreign popularity of 346 idols <br><br>If she only knew...</br></br></br>  <br><br> Wet t-shirt <br> Bubble butt <br>I like this<br><br>I like this a lot</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A man of taste.</br>  <br>I want to say it'll be something akin to the Cinderella Girl election adapted into the anime but.<br>That really doesn't seem like something TakeP would think of nor want.</br></br>  Lil' Anzu butt.  Momoka next week   Kanako's snacks were hidden in the old office   <br> Nana's room <br>The chances are even bigger since it doesn't look like and of the CP girls but NG will be playing any significant roles now.</br></br>  I want P-kun's brother to join him and save the aidorus.  <br> &gt;wants to focus on marketing overseas <br><br>Just do what you are already doing. If I wanted something else I'd watch something else.<br><br><br>Next episode- Someone accidentally plays this song during dance practice and P-kun freaks out<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rye<wbr>EqTbFSv4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Patiently waiting for Momoka and Ichihara</br>   A character's trademark power song is finally performed <br> They insert talking throughout 80% of the song <br><br>I think I now get what Chihayafags felt during her Nemurihime performance.</br></br></br>  <br>God those prefab walls are awful!, I remember spamming those when I was a junior in my firm.</br>    Can we all agree that Mashiro at lest had good intentions and sorta did mostly nothing wrong?<br><br>For some reason, she just wanted to do everything fast instead of doing it slowly but surely.<br><br>I bet it's because  she got close with a certain Producer who was training in America at the time and, before they separated, promised to get their productions and idols overseas and worldwide fame. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't get that feeling.<br>I'm watching a show, not a music video. You can go and listen to the full song whenever you want.</br></br>    <br>Is there actually a link between these in any way?</br>  <br>Holy fuck. What a faggot.</br>  <br>I don't think they know what pedophilia is.</br>  <br>My nigga. Old hags deserve love too.</br>  <br>The fuck? Is the interviewer Brandon Orselli from NG?</br>  <br> Can we all agree that Mashiro at lest had good intentions and sorta did mostly nothing wrong? <br>Right idea, bad execution, she obviously isn't doing it for the misfortune of the idols, but business is business.</br></br>  <br>It made what Kaede was conveying in those scenes a lot more impactful though, especially given the verse they chose to end the song on.</br>  <br>Don't think so.<br><br>P-kun always looks so stoic and stone-faced, much like our Red-Shouldered friend.</br></br></br>  Kirari a cute.  <br> it's borderline pedophilia <br>What</br></br>  <br><br>She is probably under pressure from someone else.</br></br>  <br>Who is best c@ke and why is it KWSM?</br>  <br> waiting for lolis <br> CG anime <br>You better quit now.</br></br></br>   mfw we're never getting closure on this <br>Ah well. Maybe it's better for P-san to not have his wounds reopened.</br>    Dat cute cough Aznu does.  <br>They could have at least drawn the round end of her butt, but I guess she isn't a girl with a smoking figure like Miku who they can give buttshot of.</br>  <br>This.<br>Also Nemurihime was used in a shitty episode in a shitty way.</br></br>    <br><br>Those girls who left him are probably doing JAV now<br><br>Welcome to planet iM@S</br></br></br></br>  What do her pits smell like? I hear east asians lack sweat glands there.  <br>NG Hijack was always a thing, really not surprised this happened.</br>  <br>True. Also, to be fair, she worked from goddamn New York which is all about getting shit done as fast as possible.<br><br>I'm not sure if there's a reason why she wants to do it so quickly but having worked in a busy city like that would at least ingrain some habits to you.<br><br> inb4 she's just putting up a tough front because she needed to do that to survive the world. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For a fraction ofa second I thought they were Utena's shadow play girls, what the fuck.</br>  <br>She is a fucking bitch. No sugarcoating it.</br>  <br>It's like episode 2 and possibly the last time they'd be together as a team. There's actually a reason for them being in the spotlight (actually having a job).</br>  produsah is such a bro  ;-;   What did this say?  <br><br>Translation:<br>I never played this game and all I know about it is from 4chan</br></br></br>  <br> it's like episode 2 <br>And 10 episodes later it will be like episode 12, and still it will be all NG while completely fucking ignoring the majority of other girls, once again.<br>Hell, Kaede already got what most CP girls won't ever.</br></br></br>  <br> dissolve Candy Island it's fucking useless </br>  <br>If they left out the Awakened Miki route in the original game, they'd just have to work around some of the Ami/Mami teasing and there wouldn't be any problems.</br>  <br> It was mostly Kaede being a great girl and BTFO'ing Mishiro <br> lel NG hijack <br><br>Is ANY SCENE where NG makes an appearance now NG a hijack? Jesus people.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't get my hopes up.</br></br>  <br>765pro too stronk.</br>  <br>It's been a while</br>  <br> Child of the President <br> Fairly Young <br> Female <br><br>Being any of those three in a high position already gives a ton of pressure to you, especially in Japanese society. <br><br>There's this sort of need to prove their worth and that they are capable of handling it so they want to do something big with immediate results.<br><br>It's pretty common thing to see in the outside world.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We got Maple<br>We got Koi Kaze<br>We got her telling MishirOujo to GTFO, my fans EGAOs &gt; your shekels and prestige<br><br>BASED/10</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop defending a rigid bitch for fuck's sake, this is anime and I don't care about why she is the ways she is.</br>  <br>Well, that's still 10 episodes later, not the now.<br><br>Have a little faith, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh its "I-can-see-the-fucking-future-and-a<wbr>ll-my-predictions-are-totally-right<wbr>" anon.<br><br>Bout time you posted. Tell me, does Hanako get run over by a dog?</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Calm your tits, son. You'll only see what you want to see and if you want to see one dimensional villians, that's all you'll ever see.</br>  <br> little faith <br>14 episodes were enough to lose the last spark, thank you very much. It's clear who A-1 doesn't fucking care about.<br><br>Be sceptic while you still can.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sheryl </br>  <br>I want to catch Anzu's cold.</br>  <br>What do you think Anzu's panties smell like?</br>  <br>Lighten up, man. Just enjoy the show, the here, and now.</br>  <br>Programme Changes<br>Review Idol appearances<br>-Candy Island- -&gt; other units (rookie appointment)<br>Baseball Dosue (baseball cute) -&gt; Biweekly replacement<br>-&gt; Next Recording end on time<br><br>seems like talk about the game show</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Absolutely revolting.<br>Would suck on.</br></br>  <br>Vinegar.</br>  <br>But my favorite idols didn't do anything in 14 episodes. Hard to enjoy anything like that really, especially when NG takes the screen for the xth time again.</br>  Does anyone have an explanation of kaedes puns in this episode? Translation does a great job of destroying them  <br><br>Thanks</br></br>  <br><br>Such a QT</br></br>  <br>someone ban mio's titties<br>I can't even assess her objectively because of those assets</br></br>    <br>Well, they are the main characters. They had a legit reason for being in the ep. And that's like just for you. Some of us won't even have any of our favorite idols pop-up. That's not even counting all the P-chamas out there.<br><br>This ep distributed screen time jsut fine considering it had to appeal to Kaedefags as well as waste the first act on the Mashiro drama.</br></br></br>  <br>She looks incredibly thick in the in the ones on the left and bottom right.</br>  I want Minami to step on my dick while making this face.  <br>We got cake but no interaction with P-kun.<br><br>Still mad about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Rin seemed especially fascinated with Kaede this episode it looked. I have no doubts that Kaede is going to be involved in Rin drama.</br>  <br>By favorite I mean the favorite among anime cast.<br>For example Miria didn't do half the things or said half the line Kaede just did this episode in 14 episodes.<br>If you don't understand how that can kill a person's hopes, then I don't know what to say.</br></br></br>  Who else is hoping and excited for an Usamin episode next week?  <br><br>If she gets arrested</br></br>  So this means Mio's group is basically confirmed right?  <br>HELL YES</br>  This show needs more delicious Yuko.  <br> More Akane <br>FUCK YES!</br></br>    <br>I'm ready for antics.</br>  <br>I will spoon with her all night long.</br>  Man, seeing segment with the S(mile)ING bgm is a real downer, especially if you've had those kinds of experiences as well where the company you work for had been bought or taken over and there's new management.<br><br>A lot of worry about jobs and stuff.</br></br>  <br>I'm gonna need more scolpolamine for next week.</br>  Back to accurate Russian subs I see.   Daisuki can't handle those barrage of puns <br><br>I don't understand them but I'm still laughing.</br></br>  <br>Does it really look like her room though?</br>  <br>Anya is so lovely</br>  http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XfZ_<wbr>K8sJ6NY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> ＫＯＮＣＨＩＫＩＣＨＩＮ<br><br>ＫＯＮＣＨＩＫＩＣＨＩＮ</br></br> </br></br>  <br>Probably. The pink cutesy decoration, and also Nana has a shot when she's coming out from her apartment in the 2nd Season PV.</br>  <br><br><br><br>It bothers me that she has the same exact name as the Precure character.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A little bit, yes.</br>  <br> Mio's proposal is a school festival event. <br><br>Also,<br> Kaede giving out fans to her fans </br></br></br></br>  <br>Also one on the train. So it's easy to assume they're one after the other which could imply an ep, or at least a scene, of her daily life.</br>  How will Uzuki beat hallucinations and attempted murder?  <br>Wait a sec. Can someone check if this is Mio's room? it sorta looks like it.</br>  <br>What no. <br><br>Mio's room is covered in orange furnishings. Her windows are also clear glass panels.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I wonder if you could molest your loli hallucination.</br></br>  <br>Oh. Oh well. for some reason that cabinet on the left spoke out to me.<br><br>Well, if anything, the rabbit is the most concrete evidence for it being Usamin's room.</br></br></br>  <br>this is my room can confirm</br>  You can only pick one, choose wisely.  <br>Iri. Not a pedo.</br>  <br>Iri.</br>  <br>Marry Miyu<br>Fuck Kuro<br>Adopt Ilya</br></br></br>  Always Miyu.  <br> choose wisely <br>Irisviel, not even a competition. Now between Irisviel and the maids, THAT would be a difficult decision.</br></br>    <br>Where is Bazett? Where is Taiga? Where is Leys and Seyla?</br>  <br><br><br>Oh hell, normalfags ARE fucking up Illya threads indeed.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Christmascake fags please go and stay go.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> normalfags </br></br></br>  <br>Irisviel, but only if I can get Zero Irisviel. Otherwise, I choose  none. </br>  <br><br><br>Shit taste hivemind.</br></br></br>   this thread <br>No wonder nobody complains about the horribly drawn loli swimsuit figures, people just do not care.<br>Jesus Christ.</br></br>  <br><br><br> everyone that doesnt like lolis are normalfags <br>Okay, multiple special snowflake-san</br></br></br></br>  So is Miyu a cuck now? I'm not memeing, it's just that she seems perfectly content with letting Illya make out with Kuro all the time while just watching.  <br>No contest.</br>  For those poor souls who still hasn't seen the episode.  <br>Do you even know why they're kissing?</br>  <br><br> implying special snowflake <br> implying shit taste <br>Why not go back to your shitty /vg/ generals instead of shitposting?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I don't mind Loli really, I appreciate most body types, but Iri is somehow more appealing to me.</br></br></br>  <br>Marry Iri<br>Adopt Miyu<br>Fuck Illya<br>Kill Kuro</br></br></br></br>   loli anime <br> /a/ is picking the old hag <br><br>LRD is right you know.</br></br></br>  <br> everyone who disagrees with me belongs to /vg/ <br>Go on anon, its actually fun to see you reply.</br></br>  <br>Of Prisma Iri and maids? Leysritt. Sella has too much of a temper and Iri is Iri.</br>  Kuro is by far the sexiest. It's not even close. She's like 4 tiers above everyone else.  <br>Or the OVA.</br>  <br>I just wanted a decent shot of the girls where they look like they actually have a body, not just blobs.</br>  <br>Now we have the complete collection:<br> http://web.archive.org/web/2015061<wbr>2190032/http://a.pomf.se/xqvrst.web<wbr>m - 2wei (Kuro x Miyu)</wbr></wbr> <br> http://webm.host/e7421/vid.webm - 2wei OVA (Kuro x Illya - Bonus Miyu) <br> http://webm.host/edd11/vid.webm - 2wei Herz (Kuro x Illya) </br></br></br></br>  <br>Illya wins with her childish innocence, sweet white/pink softness/silkyness and absolute girlyness.</br>  <br> 3 normalfags is suddenly /a/ <br>Fuck off, LRD. You're probably samefagging.</br></br>  <br>Emiya-chan.</br>  <br>Now we wait for this one.</br>  Impregnate Kuro<br>Impregnate Kuro<br>Impregnate Kuro<br>Impregnate and marry Kuro</br></br></br>  <br>Two of those anons just mentioned Iri. She's a married woman, not cake. As for the maids, are they even over 25 in this universe?</br>  <br>I can't be responsible for this much shit taste, but I can at least understand who are the people who go apeshit by my legit complaint about fucked up fanservice.</br>  <br>Oldhags are oldhags, so you can fuck off.<br>And how is Iri no cake?</br></br>  <br>But 3rei isn't getting an anime though</br>  Fuck me, if I knew just picking Iri would have caused this much butthurt I would have said nothing at all.<br><br>Let me say it again, I DON'T MIND LOLI. If you want me to pick between those 4 though, Iri is my go to.</br></br>  <br>I'll take a raincheck for Angelica instead. She's delicious homunculus tier.<br><br>And we all know homunculi are the purest.</br></br></br>  <br>She is already married.<br>Not that I expect newfags to know what a cake is.</br></br>  <br>Just because it's an older woman, doesn't mean they're a cake.</br>  <br>That's what they want you to think.</br>  Chloe is the best Illya.  iri  <br/>  Illya = Miyu &gt; Kuro &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iri<br><br>Anyone who disagress has shit taste and should be castrated.</br></br>  <br> And how is Iri no cake? <br><br>because she's married.</br></br></br>  <br>You can stop now.</br>  <br/>  <br>I marry Illya and adopt Miyu, but since Kuro needs mana she can come as well.</br>  <br>None of them.</br>  <br><br/></br>  So this show is basically pedobait, which is cool because it's allowed me to unfriend some folks on facebook who were defending this shit.  <br>I"d fuck any of them untill my dick was raw. Except for Iri, not even because she's too old but just because she's too motherly</br>  <br><br>No you are probably just a kid, lolis are like red wine and caviar, your taste will become refined with age.</br></br>   LRD is samefagging as a normalfag <br>So nothing new.</br>  <br>If you are really serious about your "taste", then you should get the fuck out of Illya threads because you clearly don't belong and have missed the door.</br>  <br>Your kind should be prisoned. You are a menace to society.<br> also banned the fuck from /a/ </br></br>  <br/>  <br>Facebook itself is cancer, but discussing anime on Facebook? Fucking christ.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Stitches from the last thread. Keep them coming, stitch bro.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kuro, because delicious chocolate rapist loli</br>  <br><br>Stop replying to obvious shitposters</br></br>  <br> samefagging <br>That's not possible actually. I'm all in for LRD witch hunt, but don't use him as boogeyman when the thread is in trouble from actual normalfags.</br></br>  <br> red wine <br>Red wine is shit taste, I think you meant to say gin there, buddy.</br></br>  I just want cute, well drawn bellies.  <br>I don't think real normalfags watch this kind of show though.</br>  <br>Amen to that, me too.</br>  <br>Already posted them all.</br>  <br>Fate is extremely popular with normalfags. Those who would choose Iri above any of the lolis are obviously among those.</br>  <br>Well after UBW, who knows?</br>  <br>If they started banning discussion from /a/, then I guess you would get your wish.<br><br>This show is what it is: pedobait. Getting offended by discussing how much it appeals to pedophiles is some serious tumblr SJW crap on your part.</br></br></br>  <br>I doubt Iri is popular with the newfags. They would probably either chose Illya or Rin.</br>  <br>Zero attracted more normalfags.<br>Nothing can be worst.</br></br>   yfw     <br>I think you missed one. The old one we had was based on pv source. We need one using the good raw source.</br>    <br>jesus you're more afraid of normalfags than /r9k/, are you that fucking insecure?</br>  <br>The angle that her ass is in makes no sense.</br>  <br>It is slight fanservice for pedos, yet nothing too strong, and even if it would be, you would still be a retarded faggot for blogging about your SJW shit brain.</br>    <br>When they ruin threads like this, of course I'm afraid of them.</br>    Did anyone else notice that her staff looks different in the OP. Specifically in the last chunk of the Op it's got both ruby and sapphire in it's globe.    <br>Wow, it's still fucking nothing.</br>  <br><br>No but lolis were one of the pillars that laid the foundation of 4chan, we just want to keep that inner fire burning.<br><br>Also not liking/criticizing lolis has always been an strong indicator of newfagness.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What were you expecting?</br>  <br>It's Zwei Form doofus, of course it's going too look different.</br>  <br>Mein boner. You're doing God's work.</br>  <br><br>This is pretty much softcore porn now.</br></br>  Describe your hype at this moment.  <br>A little shine and texture to her body maybe. I don't know. Not really much, that scene was pretty bad to begin with.</br>  Between this and Non non, SL's animation and detail this season is pretty damn impressive.  <br>Why is this show so good?</br>  <br>My hype pretty much goes like this:<br>FUCK YOU SILVER LINK FOR BURNING THOUSANDS TIMES THE MONEY NEEDED FOR DRAWING DETAILED BODIES IN SWIMSUIT, YET YOU REFUSE THE LATTER. Basically.</br></br>  <br> http://webm.host/edd11/vid.webm <br>I might sound picky but can you edit this one without Mimi's parts on camera?<br>It kind of breaks the flow of the scene, and I found her annoying.<br><br><br>Everyone is bisexual in the series except for Mimi.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There are kissing noises during her parts though, so it'd kinda make the audio disjointed.</br>  <br>Kuro. Illya and Miyu are fine too.<br><br><br><br><br>Delicious. But we need webm with audio too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> muh CGI </br>  <br> dat Kuro tracing <br>Based.</br></br>    <br>I pick Caren.</br>    <br> that bubble butt <br>oh my fucking god</br></br>  <br>Postable <br>Audio: http://webm.host/edd11/vid.webm<br><br>Collection is here </br></br></br></br>  <br>That fucking animation.<br>I dunno what is better, UBW or this.</br></br>  <br>Puriya.<br><br>They're actually animating the in-betweens.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>They should just have done something other Fate related, since they seem to blow the budget into action shit.<br>No need for a Prisma Illya like this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't ufotable reallocated funds/staff for God Eater ?</br>  <br>Ilya, brown may seem lewd on the outside, but Ilya as way lewder internally.</br>  <br>Its the OP so I wouldn't my breath yet.<br>That aside, the OP looks amazing.</br></br>  <br> so I wouldn't my breath yet. <br>So I wouldn't hold*<br>Fuck.</br></br></br>   ***,777位/***,763位 (**1,095 pt) [*,**3予約] 2015/09/25 Fate/kaleid liner プリズマイリヤ ツヴァイ ヘルツ!　第1巻 [Blu-ray] <br><br>It keeps falling down.

Love the expression, it really fits Chihaya's character</br>  Requesting Pieri cooking or sleeping because /v/ is swamped with Fire Emblem requests atm and I don't want to anger them with a waifu request.<br>Sorry for the small request sheet. There isn't much of her out there as Fates is a recent game.<br>Thanks in advance.</br></br>  <br> Is the archive broken? I can't access it <br>Yes. What a tragedy this is comparable to burning of Alexandria Library.</br></br>  <br>Your logic astounds me.</br>  Requesting an answer to these questions:<br><br>Do the artists who drew these three pictures have sites? More importantly, do they take commissions?</br></br>  <br>See I knew I wasn't crazy!</br>  <br>From left to right, <br>Sites: yes, yes, no<br>Commissions: no, yes, no</br></br></br>  <br>Kuso takes commissions. <br><br>http://kusotoko.com/</br></br></br>  <br>Artist names?</br>  <br> Kuso will never find your waifu appealing </br>  <br>Thanks!</br>  Requesting Hibiki trying to cool off in front of a fan.  <br>Left is Hot Chocolate, right is Coupon, middle is </br>  <br><br>So the one in the middle was kuso?

I didn't have a color in the reference pic to go by, so I thought she'd look good with pink. I hope you like it!  <br> still attacking Riasbro </br>  <br>What's up with his heart?</br>  <br><br>ART! I meant his art!</br></br>  <br>YEEEEART!</br>  <br>OR here. Good Lord that is cute. Though I should probably add to post she's blond since there is 0 coloured pics of her. Still good choice, you really made it suit her. Bravo.</br>  <br>That's not really a good comparison. Reimu is arguably the most popular character of a series that has been wildly popular for almost 20 years, while Tama is one of the least popular main characters in a series that was one of the lowest selling of the winter 2013 season.</br>  <br>You know, I had a feeling she was blonde haha Thanks a bunch for the compliments, anon! Have a wonderful weekend!</br>  <br>don't remind me that gj-bu sold like crap and we will never get any Nendoroids of the cast</br>  Requesting a clearly annoyed/frustrated Nio playing Assassin’s Creed and saying something along the lines of, “This is such bullshit, su~.”<br>Here's a reference for her tattoos, in case you'd like to incorporate them (it would be greatly appreciated): http://imgur.com/a/VPcbp#0<br>Otherwise, anything cute, funny, or cool would be really nice. <br><br>Thank you to anyone who may be interested.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw unhappy your waifu's series wasn't popular enough for a theatrical release and there's only 8 figurines of her <br><br>I guess I could keep perspective.</br></br></br>  <br> only 8 <br>lucky.</br></br>  <br>Much better than only  0 , m8. Geez.</br>  <br> 8 figures <br>It's better than there being none.</br></br>  Requesting Marble in Taimanin Suit  <br><br><br> Reminder that Husbandos get figures on an even rarer basis. </br></br></br>  <br> no figures <br> no new content <br> no official art </br></br></br>  To be a Mikufag, and get 8 new figures every year.<br><br><br>Yeah, RIP you guys.</br></br></br>  Requesting Birdy in a Sarong bikini please.

I was thinking that her outfits kinda do give off the impression of her being taller, so I'm kinda trying to make it a point that she's mega tiny. No official measurements but she can't be taller than 4'10</br>  <br> 5 Seasons <br> 6 VN's <br> 3 series of manga <br>1-2 poorly made figures</br></br></br></br>  <br> only 1 fig <br> Beach Queens </br></br>  <br>Sorry Shionbro, we can feel bad together! ;_;<br><br>Have you considered commissioning a statue from bupi?

I really love that sweater and love you for drawing her in it. She looks so adorable and huggable. wait... why did it get deleted?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I realized there was a yellow splotch on her, so I deleted and then reposted her after fixing it. Thanks a bunch for requesting!</br>  <br>No figures no LN no nothing. She got a pen and a ruler, that's pretty much it. Couldn't even get one before they were gone for good. I cry</br>  <br>The Beach Queen is my  second  favorite tho.<br><br><br> Bupi will never finish it </br></br></br></br>  <br> 8 figures  <br><br>I'd be lucky if they actually made one that isn't a small key chain after all this time.</br></br></br>  <br>Better than the 0 I have.<br><br> The BDs don't even have a character sheet for her like everyone else has <br> There are minor, 1 episode characters that have a sheet </br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks a bunch for drawing her.

The tongue out is cute. Enjoy the rest of your weekend!</br>  <br> People don't even make fanart of her anymore <br>Feels so sad.<br> &gt;1 picture on pixiv </br></br></br>  <br>Glad you like it!<br><br>This is for the anon who requested Sawyer!</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks dude! I think you delivered for me before, right? I appreciate it!</br>  Requesting Tewi sitting in an (simple) area with neo-venezia/aria like atmosphere, dipping her feet into the refreshing water while sitting with the sun shining on her cute, short hair.<br><br>Thank you for considering, have a nice weekend.</br></br>  <br> as long as i live i will never commission any of the drawanons in these threads <br>Why not?</br></br>  <br>Tfw you make the majority of the images of your waifu nowadays.</br>  <br>Then I can't even complain. She actually had decent popularity back in her days, though most of the drawings of her are just copies.<br><br>That's literally pain.<br><br> I hope both of your girls gets drawn. <br><br><br>I dream that one day I will be able to give her this treatment.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw a figure of hers was at last year's con <br> already over my budget <br> couple other things from her series here and there <br> nextyear.jpg <br> go to con this year <br> not a damn thing for her franchise in sight <br><br>I deserved this</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   It's not humanly possible to make the majority of your waifu's new fanart, and you're only about the third best artist dedicated to her <br><br>Feels batman</br></br>  <br>Con I went to had like 6 figs of Hina.<br><br> That was 3 years ago </br></br></br>  <br>you're the best to me</br>  <br>Oh, thank you, almost missed it!</br>  <br>It's been literally thousands of years since I drew anime</br>  <br> and you're only about the third best artist dedicated to her <br> Being the third best artist in the world of your own waifu <br>Man you're living the dream.</br></br></br>  <br>I missed you ryai<br>You should draw my waifu again</br></br>  Hello requesting Kougyoku wearing Demon Slayer's outfit from DFO (http://imgur.com/a/XxRzU), or Shigure's summer swimsuit from Kancolle (http://i.imgur.com/JRsxSWF.jpg), please and thanks!  <br>I'm glad I have the opportunity to do it. These threads help but I draw her more often than I get deliveries. I should post them on Pixiv, but I don't want to spam</br>  <br>You should do it more often. This looks really nice. Delicious armpit, too.</br>  <br>Ill draw her anon, I'm working on a bigger piece this weekend and need breaks. <br>Do you have a style you want her in? I'm still trying new things and a prompt to that would be cool.</br></br>   mimifag will draw oora before finishing your request   <br>I wish you'd draw my waifu doing cool yugioh related dueling and card slashes a second time, Ryai.</br>  <br>you should do it. please don't deprive the people who love her too.</br>  <br>Not really.<br>Because if we're to be real here, he either has to draw it himself,  and as it's been said before, nobody wants to draw their own waifu, on account of thinking their own art is shit,  or he'd have to either request or commission the only other two artists to draw her for him.</br></br>  <br>You certainly haven't lost your edge in that millenia.</br>  <br>Missed seeing your drawings.</br>  <br> thanking a troll delivery </br>  Requesting mai gorgeous husbando Dio Brando wearing a kimono please, position is up to the artist.<br><br>Your consideration is appreciated &lt;3</br></br>  <br>She looks kind of souless.</br>  <br>You're either Orihimefag or Futayofag, I'm assuming. I did make note in my original post where I accepted the request that I might not finish or post it, "no guarantees", as I do every time I accept a direct request but if you wanted me to finish all you needed to do was ask again. My art isn't really worth your time anyway. <br><br><br>Eh, that's few and far in between nowadays.<br><br><br>It's fine.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ryai! I've missed you man, you're deliveries look amazing as usual</br>  <br> That design on her bra and panties <br> COBRAAAAAAAAA </br></br>  Requesting Yoruichi looking excitedly at kittens in a window at a pet store.  <br>Her year has already come and gone, I suppose.</br>  <br> dat face </br>  <br> that's few and far in between nowadays <br>just do it</br></br>    <br>It's called a bikini, fool. Underwear is a seperate matter, and I will not allow you to mock the difference between them with your ignorance!</br>  requesting, in a bikini  <br>I was on the fence about that too</br>  <br>gave up on the durararara girl?</br>  Alright /a/ I know you there are a lot of you saying that the UBW remake was shit.<br><br>Tell me exactly how you would change it. Be specific.</br></br>  I wouldn't.<br>I don't try to fix my own turds either.<br>I just press the Flush button.</br></br>  <br>Read the fucking VN, you filthy secondary</br>  <br>I did you cuck.</br>  <br>It became too popular for /a/.</br>  UBW is not a remake. <br><br> Tell me exactly how you would change it <br>I don't know. I  haven't read it yet  so art, I think.</br></br></br>  <br>There's nothing I could change without changing the entire UBW route. It was a good adaptation of a shit series, so it was shit.<br><br> "R-Read the VN!" <br> "It gets better I swear!" <br>Fuck off. I'm not going to bother wasting my time reading through some retard like Shirou's life and ideals.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> paying attention to the threadcrappers <br> unironically <br>What horrible way to start a thread. And this should ne the umpteenth time someone does this one.</br></br></br>  Why does Fate need 10 threads at all times?  <br>your threads ruined it for me before i could into it</br>  <br><br><br><br>this is why fate threads are shit, you can't even defend why you hate something<br><br>absolutely most autistic fanbase on /a/, the vn alone takes as long as watching 6 different anime</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>50 minute episodes, all monologues are included, absolutely no change from what happened in the VN, Miura gets burned alive and we get the film as a BD extra..</br>  TOHSAKA RIN PLEASES OLD MEN FOR MONEY  Fate is shit. The VN is shit, the anime are all shit, and especially the fanbase is shit. Literally worse than Naruto and SAO.  <br><br>I'd adapt Heaven's Feel instead.<br><br>Best thing about Ufotable's UBW adaptation was it reminded UBWfags that the route isn't as good as they thought it was. and many who have gone back to re-read the VN have been reborn as Heaven's Feel fags.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Fate was always popular. It's the most entry level VN in the medium, which is why the fanbase is so terrible.</br></br>  <br>It's probably the best continuation for Fate Zero, considering it follows up on Kiritsugu's and Shirou's ideals and how they clash. But yeah, the story meanders for a good while and doesn't have a lot of interesting action. Rider gets killed off-screen, Lancer does fuck all for a good part of the story. <br>It's got a good start and a strong conclusion, though.</br></br>  <br> It's probably the best continuation for Fate Zero, considering it follows up on Kiritsugu's and Shirou's ideals and how they clash. <br>What? UBW? UBW is easily the worst successor to Fate/Zero, considering how all the plot threads left behind from Fate/Zero are abandoned.</br></br>  <br> It's probably the best continuation for Fate Zero <br>No, no. You are thinking about HF. It's the one that gives best closure to everything set up by Zero.</br></br>  <br>Nobody in its sane mind should give a fuck about Zero, though.</br>  <br>Why should people not care about the best TypeMoon property after Carnival Phantasm.<br><br> inb4 secondary <br>I bet I read the F/SN VN before you did, you little shitter.</br></br></br></br>  they should have adapted fate first, fate stay night needs all routes to work.  <br>put a fucking kiss in the epilogue holy shit</br>  <br>There's already a Fate route anime, anon.</br>  <br>Change Rhino's profile.</br>  <br>Characters are no longer pure if they kiss.</br>  <br>do you recommend people watch Deen before ubw?</br>  <br>no longer pure shit, anyway</br>  <br>What the fuck was the deal with Tohsaka Rhino anyway?</br>  <br>The source material is trash to begin with.</br>  Fate is garbage  <br>Because Zero it's a fucking prequel, it matters shit which route it's a better follow-up, because FSN is its own thing. Zero is nothing more than fanservice for the VNreaders.</br>  Would not have adapted it into an anime.  <br>what makes it garbage</br>  <br>I'd fix Rin's facial proportions. The spacing between the eye and eyebrow bothered me almost every time she smiled.</br>  <br>starting directly from the exact beginning of the production process, my first change would be to not waste my studio's money on licensing to adapt a bullshit halfassed porn vn.</br>  <br>stay ez you faggot</br>  Really bad character renders. Everyone's face is so fucked up to the point of being distracting.  <br>Except for Archer. Can't bone his sword.</br>    <br> get in the fucking holy grail war, shinji </br>   have better alternative <br> don't use it </br>  <br>He did it in more ways than one, you know.</br>  Change the artstyle.<br>Make Shirou a LOT less obnoxious.<br>Then again the route was terrible so you can only polish a turd so much.</br></br>  Sort the music out. It's very forgettable. Would have taken Kajiura over the UBW composer.  <br>I would animate a superior VN like Muramasa or Baldr Sky</br>  <br>Choose F/HA instead. Though it would probably fail since there's more stuff to work with.<br>Anyway, I hope they'll add a batcave in the upcoming HF movie, it's better that way.</br></br>  <br>It is in a way a remake of the movie.</br>  <br>It would be forgettable again, Fate/Zero sounds like the leftovers of other of her works</br>  Is anime that expensive to make? It's like they dump all the money at the beginning and then make the rest from leftovers.  <br>Imagining all the Zero-only watchers suddenly getting thrown into H/A's slice of life antics with characters they don't know and Saber being cute is certainly amusing.</br>  <br>I'd love to see deredere Rin scene animated, but damn.</br>  <br>because the VN was shit meaning the remake was even more shit.</br>  <br>Does anyone have that comparison image of Saber swimming and her in fate/ZERO? She is saying something about how she cannot be stopped by water.</br>    Bryce Papenbrook as Shirou  <br> secondary <br>Kek please tell me how many of the anime you watch are based of light novels/visual novels/manga's then tell me how many of those you actually read to completion.<br>I'll wait.</br></br></br>  What servant aside from Saber would you like to see in Alter form?  <br>Have it make sense and be interesting.</br>  Fate is garbage  <br> UBW remake was shit <br><br>Nice meme, it actually improved on the VN.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't have a problem with it. It was a good adaptation though all the Zero pandering with Gilgamesh was annoying. I still hate Rin, the VN made me hate her even more. Please do not fuck up the exorcism, Nine lives and the final fight.</br>  They missed a lot of key scenes. Here's a list, I'm sure I'm forgetting a lot.<br><br>1.- Shirou's parallel to Rin's face when Archer betrayed her and how she was killing her emotions<br>2.- Shirou's second projection against Kuzuki. Remember? "Danger, this is too much for me, I'll die if I project again... I will die if I project swords...? I don't know about other people, BUT THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL I WILL DIE FROM CREATING SWORDS!"<br>3.- They removed some of Archer's lines before he fought Shirou, like when he said that he was hoping for a paradox, or this one: "Right, this is wrong. This is not what I wished for. I DID NOT BECOME A GUARDIAN FOR THIS!"<br>4.- Before Shirou dragged Gilgamesh inside UBW, they swordspammed a LOT more.<br>5.- They didn't use "Ever-present Feeling" for that Shirou and Rin scene, and they made Rin HIT Shirou for no reason.<br>6.- The fucking awful character design in some episodes, like pic related. Fucking UGUUU</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they made Rin HIT Shirou for no reason. <br>It was a push and it ended better than in the VN with her face on his back.</br></br>  <br>The VN must be really shit.</br>  <br>It also killed her character a bit and forced her into the tsundere archetype.<br><br>Yeah, it was bad.</br></br></br>  Let's talk about Miki.<br><br>What do we like about her?  What makes her best? </br></br>    <br>Wasted quads. The censor was awesome directing that emphasized the violence and left the gore aspect to the viewer's mind. "More is less" and "nothing is scarier", those tropes don't exist for nothing. It's actually an awesome explanation of how Yuki viewed the scene (it was utter mind rape for her) and why she reverted back to delusion stage afterwards.</br>  <br>DELETE THIS</br>    <br>Zombie edit when?</br>   seems like you lost your memories kid <br> y-yeah that really sucks <br> better take you back to your parent, aright? <br> N-NO! I just remembered that my parents suck dick <br>Is Oda testing me?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> To be fair memories might work that way in RL. Different kinds of memories are stored in different parts of the brain. A person with a phobia could lose his day to day memories and retain his phobia, even if he can't remember the cause of it.<br> For example people that have no memory of being raped as children but feel aversion towards certain places or people, which later on turns out to be the base of it.</br></br></br>  <br>no, but it seems you are testing how many shitty bait threads you can create on a single day</br>  <br> I don't know how the subconciousness works and I am a retarded faggot </br>  <br>Oh just stuff your piehole already grandma</br>  <br>Why do you keep on making these shit threads whining about the same thing?</br>  1 more fuckin month /a/  Another fucking shithead with another fucking bait thread. Oh boy, I wonder how fucking long it's gonna take for this thread to become a bigger shit fest.<br><br>At least Rebeccafag will be asleep for the most part.</br></br>  <br><br>nice paranoia sabofags<br><br><br><br>Why did Usopp never get amnesia?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> paranoia <br><br>Nice kneejerk reaction to people calling out your terrible bait threads, anon.<br><br> make literally nothing but similar threads in the same format whining about the same thing <br> wonders why people finally catch onto him </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>rposting replys</br></br></br>  I feel like Oda just forgot about Sunny's crew by this point. How much longer until we get a glimpse at what's happened to then?  How come we don't have any women admirals? Fishman island was all about diversity and equality and luffy likes diversity in his crews and enemies so why no women admiral. After the dressrosa arc with rebecca and oda saying mom is the opposite of adventure I'm starting to believe he's a misogynist. Just like kishimoto  <br>He has the same retrograde amnesia that Walter White had in Breaking Bad</br>  <br> Nice kneejerk reaction to people calling out your terrible bait threads, anon. <br>are you honestly retard?<br> anyone who doesn't like my favorite character must be the same guy <br>I don't see any greentext in the other OP threads OP you retard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  Am I the only one who wants to see the Kidd Aliance beat Shanks?  <br>I could be any chapter by now. <br>r-right guise?</br></br>  <br>You won't bait me twice with same hook anun</br>  <br>Are 2 and 3 any good even though they're not canon?</br>  Threadly reminder before I go to sleep  <br>There's a theory that women can't use any types of haki.

No devil fruit has ever created life</br>  <br>Amnesia is selective. It's very rare where you'll see someone who lost all their memories. And even if they lost their memories, they will often still have emotional attachments to people/things from before the memory loss. (You may forget your afraid of water, but if you see it again, your still gonna be afraid if you see it again)</br>  <br>Does Moria count ?</br>  <br>No, they would simply all have his will and be controlled by the user.

Like fear. Or laughter. Something outside of the box like that.<br><br>Atleast a sound logia would be neat.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why a logia and not paramytia?</br>  <br>zoro best nova but non SH Urogue<br>Kid best nova fruit<br>everyone knows best 63 is killer</br></br></br>  <br>He is talking about Moria's shadow. The shadow is it's own entity.</br>  <br>are you saying Capone is the best nova<br><br>a fruit that doesnt exist yet if the best DF <br><br>and that Lucky Roo is the best genderbend? The fuck is wrong with you?<br><br><br> girl with no face is somehow the best example of a genderbend </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> apoo was the sound logia all along </br>  <br>Because paramecias do not change their body like that. I would want a guy who can simply burst into a bunch of spiders that crawl into dark corners or somethign like that.</br>  <br> He's gonna be an absolute hax monster <br><br>This is what im hoping for. Used to his full potential(as in not gimped by the plot), he should be unstoppable</br></br></br>  <br>usopp his probably immortal, making his fears irrelevant. he just doesn't know it.</br>  <br>Luffy?</br>  <br>Everyone has different opinions and kinemon has the fruit</br>  <br><br> Humans are weird. You can take 10 shots and walk out of it, and people had, or you can slip on an orange peel and die.<br> People don't have life bars. Certain parts of the body are more fragile than others. Being a kid your skeleton is weaker. Ussop wasn't hit in the head hard enough, just all around it. Perhaps Ussop was hit in the head at the right place, but had so much adrenaline due to the fear and emotion he wasn't affected, that happens, or his blood was flowing too fast and didn't form a clog. Anything really.<br> <br> Justifications are easy to find.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the mask gives her a kinky sadist vibe you pleb</br>  Apoo is Kanye West of the OPverse.<br>Y'all just haters.</br>  <br>Not the Zombies. His shadow was seemingly sentient enough to go fuck knows where with Luffy. His bats too. It's arguable if they can be called "alive" but you get the idea.</br>  <br> and kinemon has the fruit <br>how is making disguises somehow the best DF power<br><br>and Lucky Roux? Really? where the hell did you even find a pic of 63!Roux?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have my ways</br>  <br> Kanye West of the OPverse. <br>Don't downgrade Apoo like that you shit.</br></br>  <br>luffy doesnt take as much damage cause of his fruit, even if blunt attacks hurt him they get mitigated a bit. <br><br>though it could be that luffy has taken more damage</br></br></br>  <br>Luffy is a given really seeing as he completely blows the crew out of the water except for maybe Zoro or 'God' Usopp.</br>  I don't know where and it might be a shitty translation, but I read how someone in OP said something along the lines of "the strongest man of the seven seas".<br>What are the seven seas refered to here?<br><br>the four blues, the calm belt, the grandline, and? Does New world count as its own sea? But then there would be four calm belts aswell. So it makes no sense to say "the seven seas". Or is the calm belt seen as a part of the grand line and the seventh sea is the all blue? (Four blues, grand line, new world, all blue.)</br></br></br>  <br> kinky sadist vibe <br><br><br>it's like you dont understand Killer's character or personality at all</br></br></br></br>  <br> No DF has ever created life </br>  <br>But moriah didn't create it he stole it</br>  <br>I do. I know he's motherly and shit, and a pretty mellow guy. I was talking about the aesthetics.</br>  <br>Not the shadows he stole<br><br>HIS shadow was sentient. he could also switch places with it at will which led luffy on a wild goose chase. <br><br>His shadow also was the one that would cut and free other shadows. It's pretty hard to fight against it as it's always a 2 vs 1.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about those qt shadow bats? Are they all an entire human shadow?<br><br>Also, could Moria steal the shadow of the moon during an eclipse? Would the moon then burn in the sun?</br></br></br>  <br>He's also, you know, a rubber man.</br>  <br>does anyone know what's going on with the PC version of this? I've heard all sorts of conflicting info about online play and costume availability and such</br>  <br> I was talking about the aesthetics. <br><br>I guess I see what you're getting at but I cant see past the Daft Punk</br></br></br>  <br>You never have to buy clothes ever again and you can't tell me u don't want a female lucky roo sharing her meat with u</br>  <br> awakening <br> Moria threatens to destroy the moon, which is where One Piece is <br> Kaido knew this all along. He was trying to take out Moria before this. </br></br></br>  <br>That explains lot because I can't stand Kanye either.<br><br>Law, Yami Yami, X Drake</br></br></br>  <br> You never have to buy clothes ever again <br>actually that would be a pretty convenient fruit to have in the real world.</br></br>  <br>Zoro<br>Hobby hobby (if it works like how I think it works<br>Alvida</br></br></br>  <br>But it's not like they were actual life they can't feel pain and have no free will</br>  <br>Didn't know Alvida was a supernova.</br>  <br>They don't take up space too. You can anything you want for the rest of your lives. But of course, no swimming and no relaxing baths</br>  <br>It didn't say the rule 63 had to be a supernova</br>  <br>they mean Alvida is best genderbend</br>  <br><br>Maybe he's just lying because he really didn't want to go back to his family.</br></br>  <br>that shit is plausible in real life, just saying.</br>  <br>I agree that his shadow was sentient but what I'm trying to say is no devil fruit has created life that can live on its own</br>  <br>And that's the way I imagine those spiders of the spider logia.</br>  <br><br>But then what about Ace.</br></br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>Well the objects that got forcefed zoan fruits by vegapunk fit your definition. Funkfreed and the Gundog</br>    <br>Kanye knows what he's doing. He's hilarious.<br>You just gotta roll with it.</br></br>  <br> mfw <br/></br>  <br>No one who thinks it is shitty writing thinks it because it would be unreasonable.<br><br><br> Also, could Moria steal the shadow of the moon during an eclipse? Would the moon then burn in the sun? <br>Holy fucking shit, what.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what the fuck is that</br>  <br>What the fuck am I looking at ?</br>  <br>Well you got me there I don't know what to say to that</br>  <br>I am glad everyone is confused as I am</br>  <br> No one who thinks it is shitty writing thinks it because it would be unreasonable. <br>then what's the fucking problem. seems like that's what OP was implying with his post</br></br>  <br>What's under the hat?</br>  <br>Oh I remember seeing this on the one piece website. It's the new cover for the wano character with the new side characters. They look pretty cool</br>  Volume 79 cover predictions are are incoming. Neat.  <br>The actual problem is that it is a cheap copp-out to use the "He had amnesia all along!" plot device to bring a beloved character into the show whom we never met or heard of before.<br><br>Listen, I really don't want to start another three hours discussion about this, we just had that one or two threads ago. So excuse me if I don't reply further if you are trying to discuss this now.</br></br></br>  <br>That's not the actual cover is it?...</br>  Psst....<br>Streaming Little Garden.<br>http://www.livestream.com/thisfinet<wbr>emperedstream <br><br>Bring snacks.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Fuckin' MS paint</br>  <br>KEK. I hope this is it, so i could watch penguinfag's loyalty crumble.</br>  <br>Do you even read?</br>  <br><br>It's the place with the helpful hardware folk.</br></br>  <br>Oh no. I will never be able to unsee this.</br>    What would happen to crocs main body If you trapped half of it in a glass jar?  <br>I'm not. But you're wrong if you don't think people are shitting about it because they don't think it's plausible like OP.</br>  <br>I guess it wouldn't be able to return to its original form and Croc'll be forced to stay sand?</br>  <br> a clone of Luffy, Law and Kidd as the same guy <br> Gin 2.0 <br>Well, shit</br></br></br>  <br><br>Logia seem to reform from the feet first when knocked into elemental form<br><br>not sure if it's necessary or what.</br></br></br></br>  Should Usopp be a part of the monster trio or maybe monster quartet? Those plant seeds he's gotten post-timeskip literally give him so many options and it would be cool seeing the cowardly guy from early one piece become the pirate who beats the shit out of admirals.  <br>Well, they are morons.</br>  <br>You guess or you know?</br>  <br>A-are you from the f-future?</br>  So, how does the Volume Cover predictions work ? Does Oda say what the cover is gonna have and people try to draw it ? Does he pick the best one ?  <br>Ussop is the weakest crewmember though.....</br>  <br> Should Usopp be a part of the monster trio or maybe monster quartet?  <br>No. He's still a backup fighter. I feel like the monster trio fits more with the brawlers of the crew.</br></br>  <br>You can't be apart of the monster trio without both forms of Haki. He is definitely doing somethings posttimeskip but this is just the bare minimum of what new world fighters need to be capable of.<br><br>he couldn't even beat caribou as he is right now. That disqualifies him.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;implying I'd dislike Penguin being OPM <br><br>On the topic of Penguin's hair, though, I think I've seen fan art of every color by this point<br> bald <br> blond <br> silver <br> white <br> red <br> black <br> blue </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How the fuck is he supposed to know ? You think he's Oda ?</br>  <br>I guess, I guess.</br>  Why haven't one piece party been scanlated yet? <br>Is Bepo getting NTR'ed again?</br>  <br>Shut up I'm talking to him not you</br>  <br>I think blue suits him the best.</br>  <br>You must be the same cunt who got assblasted about people supposedly forcing theories as facts. My bad. Stay blasted, bro.</br>  <br>and Shachi!</br>  <br>Stop replying I'm not talking to you</br>  <br>how do you guys even know who anyone but jean bart and bepo are in laws crew. like the other guys are generic faceless people how are they interesting at all? and why does jean bart never appear in any heart crew fan art?</br>  <br>It's turning other people into her.</br>  <br>Blue haired Penguin reminds me of a movie I watched when I was little called Scamper the Penguin <br><br><br>That's why I ask people to appreciate them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just tumblr/deviantartfags having fun</br>  <br> why does jean bart never appear in any heart crew fan art? <br>Jean Bart isn't yaoi bait, nor is he kawaii..</br></br>  How do people get excited for new One Piece chapters? It's been dull for fucking years, haven't read a new chapter in weeks.  What do you guys think of a gender bender arc where ivankov accidentally turns the SH crew into the opposite gendors? And they have fights with their new bodies  <br>I just wanna see an admiral or yonko fight already. This series turned to shit after marineford</br>  <br> and why does jean bart never appear in any heart crew fan art? <br>Because he's ugly and fujo's don't like ugly. They're pretty superficial when it comes to these things even though most of them are SJWs who shit on artists who draw their idealistic depictions of women more often than fat 'realistic' females.</br></br>  <br><br>I'd imagine awakened Robin is her clone having the ability to use the devil fruit powers as well</br></br>  I'm really bored.

I don't think the particles in a logia element correlate to a specific body part.</br>  <br>he's not a monster though.

I skipped a huge chunk of Hayate chapters and I should probably go back and read them.</br>  I haven't read Hayate in years. But is there any chance of these two hooking up when they inevitably lose?  So many good tsundere in this series.  Chapter 35<br> Mero kidnapped by "O" <br> Darling master chef, even Ramsay sucks balls at his side <br> TF delivers the chapter (1 thread ago) <br><br>Next episode, Suu incoming and that means tons of rape. <br><br>More HORSE PUSSY<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/14376<wbr>57745?via=thumb_watch</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Worst personality <br>That's Miia.</br></br>  <br>I can't blame her</br>  <br>Dude, really?</br>  <br>Now now mia isn't d tier. And this is coming from a cereafag, Mia should at least go to b at least.</br>  <br>Don't worry, I can.</br>  Rei or Asuka?  <br>Huh? Are you reading for comprehension or just to fap to your robot waifu?</br>  <br> asukafag autist replies with his usual damage control <br>You've been shitting on anyone who barely claims they have a preference for Rei. That means you've got problems.<br><br>Seek help.<br><br>Asuka didn't seek help. She crashed.<br><br>Asuka wasn't smart and understanding like Rei, so she could never accept reality as it is, and therefore she got screwed. Rei tried to understand herself even if it hurt and she was afraid.<br><br>Be better than Asuka, seek help now Anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because you're right. <br>  It wasn't even good fujobait.  </br></br>  <br>No she wasn't. Well I take that back, you could have replaced Rei with an Eva or an Angel for the exact same effect. Again, not integral to the series.</br>  <br> The only reason I watch Rebuild is to see Anno shitting on you autistic, victim-complex ridden, delusional, pseudo-intellectual shits <br>That can be construed as fanservice, and so my point is proven. Go home now Asukafag. <br><br><br>How is that a counter-argument anon? You pretty much argued that Rei does have impact and is part of the plot.<br><br>That's the reality, remove that reality and you've left with no show.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   tomboy <br> childhood friend <br> older sister type <br>   never killed anybody <br> secret girly side <br>Why does nobody love her?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shes is most popular ship though. I don't know what you are talking about.</br>  Shion is best Sonozaki  <br>Mion is olev. Apparently she was the cicada poster girl and R07's favourite when the series just got started. It only shifted to cleaverbroad later on.<br><br> I'll find that source someday, honestly </br></br></br></blockquote>]
