[ This fucking LN. It feels pretty fun and good at first, but after volume 3, I feel like I was being scammed, betrayed, NTRed and... fuck, I'm just mad. To start off with the story premise.  It looks like a harem   It feels like a harem   It isn't one  For now at least, though I doubt it will change in the future. Fucking hell, the MC got a bunch of girls surround him and NONE of them can be said to hold actual romantic feeling for the MC. They just stand around him, being useless for the most part and tease the reader like: "Maybe there will be romance in the near future", "Look at all of these delicious girls who don't have any interest in the MC". This shit is just hardcore blue balled.  Then next, onto the 3 main girls. The goddess is an absolutely useless sack of shit in every aspect who has no redeeming point, the chuuni is also an useless sack of shit but to a lesser extent, the hardcore masochist knight is so good at the first 2 volumes it turned out to be a scam in volume 3 and she just make me feel NTRed while reading the first 2 chapters. She redeemed herself a little after that but I'm still mad.  2 other good girls that stay consistently good is that one Lich who's not in the party and the perfect goddess who has no screen-time (I doubt she will in the future)  And then we got the whole fiasco in volume 3 where it's essentially Shield Hero all over again with rotten aristocrat being rotten except that the MC didn't retaliate at all and just going along with all of these MISUNDERSTANDING and unjustly charges after a little bit of protesting. Which is a shame because he's a pretty good MC, a MC who's not a beta faggot at all, actually have interest in girls and sex, isn't dense, actually have common sense and an advocator of true gender equality but not to the degree of edgy.             Overall, this LN is good in the sense that it make me actually care and feel some kind of intense emotion toward it. But please, stop with the blue balling, if it keep continues like that then I'd rather the MC accepted the death sentence and proceeded to meet his true goddess. Maybe then he would find his happiness and those useless fucks would realize the gravity of what they had done.    Agree. Now anime fucking when?     Eh? Next season?    I feel pretty fucking bad when darkness was being shit to Kazuma. Fuck i know that its a comedy but come the fuck on.    There are a lot of serious issues in the story but they're all being downplayed 'cause it's comedy. I think doing so has an opposite effect rather than make the story funny.    If moonreader spoilers can be believed  MC does get the Good End with Eris.      Chuuni wizard is a less useless retard who cant do shit othern than explosion   Goddess of water is so much of a retarded drunkardthat mc wishes he didnt revive when jack frost beheaded him   Crusader girl is a fucking idiot who dreams of NTR and rape   all this girls that cancel his suppose good luck  And whats worse that all the other aquintances he knows are ungrateful little shits and he has to pay debts. The Lich and the other goddess is the only one that is relief for him         Come on, it's not that bad. She just got turned on because of a pervert old man but she still saved the MC in the end. The 3rd chapter was cute, even.     The LN is very different from the WN now though, supposedly the last boss is Moi, but it seems its expanding it.    That was in in the WN though, wasn't it?    Oh yeah, I forgot that the mass population of the town now shit on him because of his bad popularity and associating with him mean = debts. Fuck them.  Crusader girl is a fucking idiot who dreams of NTR and rape  Well, at least she still has a little bit of common sense and stand up for Kazuma ass time to time. If only she wasn't that much of a pervert.  YES. Even if this doesn't happen in the LN, I'm still happy.            the MC didn't retaliate at all and just going along with all of these MISUNDERSTANDING and unjustly charges after a little bit of protesting  Dont forget that when he actually tried, Aqua and darkness remarks on the schemes he did to make money and because of that he got in trouble more and supposed to be executed until darkness intervened with her being a noble.     What are you talking about? Volume 3 was hilarious. Thanks to Darkness, MC was pardoned then set free as long as Darkness meets the aristocrat's son, who, as you noticed, is a very good man. In fact, the MC tried to set Darkness up with the son (to get rid of her, but still.)  As for the debt, it will be gone soon (then come back, then gone again). The MC's A++ Luck rank comes in effect whenever those 3 (and their E Luck rank) are not with him.      Chuuni mage loli is best girl.    Right, the court was pure rage instead of fun with the main offenders are Megumin and Aqua.     Which is a shame because he's a pretty good MC   Steal the core  But from vol 2 he was actually stupid, not annoying stupid dense like generic MC though.  He is deserve to got all 3 stooges for party.       Yes, after chapter 2 it's fun again. But chapter 1 is pure rage (with a mixed of fun as well, I'll admit), and chapter at 2 I was too busy worrying about Darkness.    Only that one moment is stupid though. It feels too out of character when he just did that, I guess he was just following the heat of moment.     MC dies of SHOCK when he tried to save a girl but didnt notice it was just a tractor   no one mourn for him a bit and laugh when he was taken to the hospital when even his body was being buried in his funeral everyone was still laughing in the way he died   Goddess even laughs the fuck at him   gets send to another world expecting to redo his life and become adventurer   too bad its the weakest class possible   oh here get some useless girls that does nothing but put a debt on him and only joins because no accepts their useless ass   MC gets more in debt and regrets more   hunts jack frost and gets beheaded because his party members didnt mention about it being strong as fuck   meets a humble goddess   about to get send to a world where he has a waifu and rich   Useless goddess tries reviving him and mc begs to get send fast but DENIED   some city destroying giant is gonns destroy town   put alot of efforts in destroying it   now his a terrorist because it destroyed a nobles mansion   tries to defend himself in court and part and "friends" even puts him more to shit  ITS A COMEDY                  reminder from chink tl reader that loli mage pretty much wants MC's dick in future volumes    The goddess is an absolutely useless sack of shit in every aspect who has no redeeming point, the chuuni is also an useless sack of shit but to a lesser extent, the hardcore masochist knight is so good at the first 2 volumes it turned out to be a scam in volume 3 and she just make me feel NTRed while reading the first 2 chapters. She redeemed herself a little after that but I'm still mad.  So what's this shit about? they fuck some other dudes or what?     Some fucking comedy. Where the fuck is Naofumi when we actually need him?    They pretty much only care about the MC since no other party wants them    Who /succubus/ here?  Nah, she didn't fuck the other dude. She was just being a pure slut who lust after anyone who would give her a good beating and humiliation. Anyone.        tfw he didnt get that wet succubus fucking dream because of his party  Why.jpg     The succubus don't even actually fuck their customers with their own body but just give them lewd dreams.  That's a pretty shitty deal if you ask me.      the point of this kind of story is that you don't supposed to self insert onto the main character.  Just enjoy it from an outsider perspective       pure slut   not fucking anyone  What?      It's a good deal actually. You don't have to worry about all sort of diseases and fucking a loose hole, even more, you got to choose whatever play you want  Hell yes, best service in the industry. Despite her lewd occupation, she seem pure as fuck.      Then your gonna like the arc where his party betrays him because he ''ripped the king a new hole" and chases after him for bounty and the princess only the one who tries to convince everyone that he didnt do it.    You wouldn't feel mad about injustice if you're an outsider? I don't think so, I've sympathy you know?    Demons don't get STDs    Is this a Shield Hero parody?    Hence the pure part.   whats up with the knight ? i havent read the 3 yet   Things happen, just read it. It's better to read than to explain.   Is this a ln that will purposely try to annoy you or what? I'm getting mixed messages here. The Mc seems cool but I don't want to read another one of those novels that blue balls you ad infinitum  I don't know how anybody could feel annoyed with this LN. It's fucking hilarious.   Depends what you're looking for. If you want touching romance, you're totally in the wrong part of town. If you want near-porn, go read Shinmai Maou no Keiyakusha.  Like the other anon said, this is comedy. It's even more of a parody of serious fantasy stories than something like Slayers. That's what it offers, that's what you'll get. Take it or leave it.      I don't know actually. It seem like the author was trying to be funny but he went way overboard with volume 3 and make some people feel mad instead. I think you should give it a try anyway, volume 1 and 2 is definitely fun, volume 3 is also fun but there are rage mixed in.    Is that Hayate no Gotoku spin off?    Its try to be comedic but instead making you fuckig laugh its makes you fucking mad.    Both.     he went way overboard with volume 3  How so?     All the people that he meet so far basically put him more into trouble when he was defending himself in court for accidentality blowing up a nobles mansion and its pretty rage worthy scene    It was hilarious. Maybe you should try reading something different. It was obvious since the prologue of the first book that what kind of comedy this series is.    all girls are best girl in terms of character design   no romance/harem   What's up with this trend of great artists carrying lackluster authors? I don't know what's worse, worst girl winning in a visually impressive show/series, or the fact that it isn't even an option because there's no romance to begin with.       the designer of the giant robot was a depressed drunkard who submitted a squashed spider as his superweapon blueprint to try and tell them to fuck off but they actually built a spider robot the absolute madmen!     Just read the thread? In volume 1 and 2, everything is still reasonable to a certain extent. Masochist knight at that point is only shown to be lust after monsters, demon and MC. The debt he shouldered isn't that unfair considering his companion was the one who brought the demon boss to the town and he didn't do much to stop her at the first place. Then in volume 3, shit hit the fan with the MC actually got sentenced to death when all he did was just blowing the landlord mansion up with no casualties because the situation demanded it. He saved the whole town by doing so. But nobody in the town is willing to help him despite knowing exactly what he just did, everyone turned against him even. His companions are fucking idiots who fucked him up even further when he tried to defend himself in front of the court. And the worst part, after doing all of those useless shit that troubled the MC up until volume 3, they didn't learn they lesson at all, they didn't even shown sign of remorse. Then we are back to the masochistic knight, she's the best one of the three and she stand up to protect Kazama many times, she also saved his ass in the court but after that she just dropped a bomb that she's also lust after fat old men, then she proceed to disappear for the next chapter to do "something" with the landlord. Et cetera... there are more than that but I only remember this much.      More like only care their own ass while having someone to pay their price and they found MC Let's call it selfish     She doesn't mind perverts who are too skinny as well!    No, it wasn't obvious.  It seem like there will be romance later in the story, but blue balling readers this much in a supposedly harem LN is a fucking crime though.       she just dropped a bomb that she's also lust after fat old men, then she proceed to disappear for the next chapter to do "something" with the landlord  She lusts after anyone who will abuse torture humiliation her. Also you seem to have missed the part where she was gone because she was busy negotiating, the end result of which was the meeting for arranged marriage with the lord's son. It's doubtful she was ruined for marriage if marriage was the goal.       I expect "hanged" ending though, featuring poor MC for not being able to return to his own world thanks to his "Oh please don't go" parties    You forgot that he got beheaded too and the supposed warm scene where he thinks the girls care for him gets ruined when they said that no one would help pay their debt and that no one is willing to party with them with him at thr rnd taking a bit of grudge     Yes, but do you remember Mitsurigi? She didn't like that guy so I thought that she has some kind of standard. Okay, so maybe she's turned on at the thought of being tormented by the landlord fat fuck, it's her nature, I don't blamed her for that. But she didn't even shown that she hate the idea despite being aroused, in fact, she seem to like it even. Yeah, I remember that one but I didn't mention it because despite knowing that it's a LN and nothing will happen, I still feel NTRed regardless when she disappear a few days after. How could I after she said that.      Atleast in the wn he manage to marry his true waifu after dying.    The thing is, it wouldn't even be blue-balling if the art wasn't so good, because no one would give a fuck about the series. And of course there's no chance of it ending in a harem end as it should with all of these great designs.    Wait, he died? Again?  Yeah, I feel like I still left out a lot of things.  The girls (except for Aqua and Megumin) are good too.        Stop self-inserting and stop taking this over the top comedy so seriously. Actually stop reading. This definitely isn't for you.    It's so damn unrealistic when you know his situation  But that would comfort me really       do you remember Mitsurigi? She didn't like that guy so I thought that she has some kind of standard.  Mitsurigi wasn't a rapey nobleman sadist.   But she didn't even shown that she hate the idea despite being aroused, in fact, she seem to like it even.  Which part of "she enjoys having things done to her against her will" do you not understand. The more she doesn't want it, the more she does want it.         He was the ancestor of the chuuni crimson clan.He engineered them genetically.    And Darkness who might even fuck the demon king simply because she can be "pleasured" is good too for you?  Simply a reminder    A reminder tha Wiz, megumin's rival and the princess are best girls.       Wow, what a load of faglords. You guys should listen to this guy.   You're all taking this far too seriously. Get a hint, the over the top suffering and ridicule of the MC is the whole point. It's only going to get worse in the future, if you can't handle it then stop right here.            The girls (except for Aqua and Megumin) are good too.   All of the girls' character designs are top notch in terms of art. If you're talking about their personalities, then that is once again the artist's amazing art being wasted on this author.     Masochist slut a shit. I hope either she reform her way into being slave exclusive for MC or gtfo from the party already.   It's his fault for even considering Darkness for waifu material. If he'd just recognized her from the beginning as a genuine NTR rape M fetishist then he wouldn't have been so upset when she did exactly what an NTR rape M fetishist does.    I would prefer that the talent of an incredible artist not be wasted on a shitty writer.    It would be much better if the retarded goddess is the one being the butt of the joke instead of MC.   Ironically all the anons calling for Darkness to get the boot from the party would just make her even more relevant since MC and her are only holding back due to not messing up their party relations.  Thanks OP, almost picking this up. You just saved me.   read this   No, I won't stop, good things are good. It has its bad points but that's no reason to stop reading. I'll continue to read and I'll continue to complain about the bad points and praise the good points.  You don't get what I mean, do you? Let me try a simple analogy: It's like you when you feel lust over real children, you think that it's wrong but you can't stop it. But in Darkness case, she doesn't think it's wrong, she fully embraced her masochistic side.  Well, she has her bad point but overall she's still good (or maybe my standard was lowered because of Megumin and Aqua)  I know it, and I still got upset. I think that's realistic and expected of her, but I've hoped that it wasn't the case. Goddamn.             What?   Most harem LN  Featuring dense virgin faggot MC   And awesome harem, with almost every heroine is well-liked    This  Featuring MC without most of the cliches   And harem-like party that no one in world would want it   Does ironically = guaranteed interesting plot?           Oops, it should be   read this<br/>        Well, she has her bad point but overall she's still good (or maybe my standard was lowered because of Megumin and Aqua)   You should be expecting a party of unlikable characters while reading this. At least vol.3 comforts me a little from that      It guarantees people to at least give it a read. But that's about it.    I was expecting so but Darkness is unexpectedly decent, combine with the fact that she hit the jackpots with my fetish, it's just inviting to get my hope up.     No, it wasn't obvious.   Are you perhaps a bit dense?     I'm currently reading chapter 2 of the LN and it seems pretty fine, what's up with this NTR shit ? I liked this for the comedy am i in for some raging moments ? Did somebody sleep with another guy or sumshit    This fucking LN. It feels pretty fun and good at first, but after volume 3, I feel like I was being scammed, betrayed, NTRed and... fuck, I'm just mad.   I feel sorry for you, OP.  Stop reading this series and leave more for the rest of us.       Sound good. I love NTR shits   Darkness revealed that she is fucking slut that would fuck any sadist.    Well, she's a slut    but did she fuck anyone ? I couldn't care less about her i like chuuni mage    This one of those series that bet girls are side characters. I wish Wiz or the goddess Eris appear more.    It wasn't obvious at all, in fact, volume 1 and 2 don't have rage, it was pure comedy for the most part.  Too bad that I won't drop a series so simple like that. I like this series a lot and I won't drop it because of a few chapters in one volume. Beside, with age come experience and wisdom, I've mastered the way of enjoying my rage and butthurt for sometime now.        Darkness revealed that she is fucking slut that would fuck any sadist.   She's been like that since the first time she was introduced. That's the joke! That's her character! She's a twisted M with rape-fantasies!  Anyone reading Kono Subarashii to get their NTR jollies and anyone reading it that actually FEELS any kind of NTRing is a complete retard.  Fucking NTR and anti-NTR fags, not everything is about NTR.          I just wish we get passed the age of " physical abuse or any kind of abuse " as a comedic effect and be done with. It's not funny and it triggers people.     with age come experience and wisdom  Heh. In that case this series shouldn't make you rage in the first place.    Wiz best girl   My nigga    Nice thumbnail.  Not really. It's like you're saying old and senile people don't get mad because they're old.      Who cares about the three stooges Yunyun a fucking best     She really, really is.    She's even more redarted than Megumin.     Yunyun  Stupid name.    Bet goddess   Who is the Saber clone with big boobs and worse color scheme?    Lalatina Dustiness Ford   I really like every girl.        saber clone   Don't you mean a Sharon clone?      Sharon who?    Even she herself found this stupid(or maybe just my misinterpretation. Prove me wrong)    Seriously? This is it? And faggots defend a stupid writer who doesn't aptly deal with such subject matter, but just laughs it off flippantly whilst castrating his MC with rusty plough shears becuase LOL IT A KOMEDY GUYZ.  I wanna read it. I haven't been mad in a while.      Yep, its try too hard at dark humor but instead making you laugh its just making you feel bad and mad for the mc.    I'm already mad   "Your family had reached the hospital, but before they felt the sadness from their loss, they couldn't help bursting into laughter after hearing your cause of death..."  "Shut up shut up! This can't be real! How could there be such a useless way to die, this is unbelievable!"  Looking down at me squatting with my head in my arms, the girl covered her mouth and laughed. "... Well, that ends my de-stressing session  "... Well, that ends my de-stressing session   de-stressing session   Gee, fukkin, thanks.              Sry I was replying on this<br/>    What makes you really mad is that the repeated jokes that are forced too much that instead of you laughing your mouth off it gives a bad taste instead    Making fun of other people misfortune  So basically this is as bad as that manga about peasant who accidentally killed hero and now using his body?   This LN got translated?    "translated"      peasant who accidentally killed hero and now using his body?  What?     I think they're talking about Yuusha ga Shinda.   Volume 3 has been pretty damn hilarious with all the Darkness antics.  It'll just get worse, OP. Even MC thinks it's too much, he even tries defecting and escaping his teammates later on.   Its Yuusha ga shinda basically farmer mc was making traps then a demon attacks about to save childhood friend he adore but instead got killed by the hero then hero falls into his trap when he tried stealing his pork and died. Then after waking up he find himself in the heroes body and finds out all his shit he did to get childhood friends atention was all for naught and that she is a slut and now he is forced to fight in a rottig body while being weak and childhood friends daily abuse.    Dont worry later on he tries to kill himself to meet Eris so that he can go back to his world and be reincarnated as rich mans child but fails miserably because of his high luck and every shit he does fails and he then tries to escape his party, but dont worry its just a dark comedy antics    Woah. Woah. Woah. The poor fucker got it hard.      Here's a link to the drama cd, thank those chinks on baidu, click on the folder inside to see the tracks. http://pan.baidu.com/s/1ntGCBDB Pass: pu8n  Now you can listen to Aqua's insufferable voice too.      This thing remind me again how twisted the Nips sense of humor it's. I wouldn't be surprised if this series is turned out to be written by some faggot who's specialize in bullying in high school.   It is basically telling those who want to get hit by a Truck and go to another world that they are pathetic retards that won't ever have an harem and that the only ones who care about them are the gentle gods who love everyone. Is it a campaign against japanese rising suicide rates?     Is this another of Shinzo Abe plot? First is Danna getting anime and now this.    Is this actually funny or is it just a run of the mill unfunny gag series like the manga makes it out to be?    Manga is 1:1 LN adaptation so its still shit I guess    So far it's just unfunny 'dark' humor which involves your typical nip MISUNDERSTANDINGS and fate in general shitting all overthe MC in a world where every one is an asshole, despite MC having high tier luck apparently.    Probably. Rising birth rates and lowering suicide rates at the same time.    There are no folders. It is white .    And talented, even the mitsurigi guy has it good.   I don't understand why there's so much hate for this. Yes, there's a lot of shitty misunderstandings nip humor crap, but other than that the humor is still decent and I get a good laugh or two each chapter. The characters are also cute and I'm glad that the series isn't some shit harem.   I really don't get this trend where the more generic light novel series are the ones that get translated.     It's just one or two NTR-victims and OP in this thread.  They have decided to cleanse the world of this thing they hate, even though they're objectively wrong about most things.  So basically a normal /a/ thread.         The usual sameposting faggots.    I like the mc still, he usually acts like how a normal human would do, fuck that scene where Aqua heard fapping in the stable was pretty funny, but somes parts are just insufferablr or maybe i dont understand how nip humor works   maybe it's a parody of the ressurection trend   MC didn't get a new body though.    No more like it shit on most reincarnation stories since MC is still weak as shit and has even more shittier life and more useless party.    Sounds like a parody to me.   Don't trust the japanese propaganda!They are all lies! Don't get married and have kids! If you see a truck jump at it and get transported to another world, they need you as the hero!!  Mushoku tensei new raw ch is out, Lucy POV.  Since this is getting an anime, is this basically the first MC dies and thrown into another world? Or not?    objectively wrong about most things     Yeah, I think it is.     DUR HEUHEUHE lookit muh dank meme guys, dis MC's life is shit, his death is worse and his next life is torture only my own twisted nip mind could devise, its so bad he wants to kill himself, tries but can't, and everything he's ever worked for is utterly ruined by his partners.  But its a comedy! Ha ha, Funny, right?       Kill yourself and return after you learn english.     Basically, dark humor is fine but everything has its own limit and different people have their own different limit. I'm not saying that those faggots who posted above you is right, but you aren't exactly in the right either if you think that there's nothing wrong with it.   Kill yourself   and return  Got me giggled.            Return   Learn   Anything  Not if I wind up with this cunt of a useless goddess      https://shikkakutranslations.wordpr<wbr>ess.com/kuro-no-maou/chapter-20/</wbr>   Honestly, people seem to be complaining excuse the series isn't just wish fulfillment. Hell during the trial people seemed so angry about, there was obvious tampering. Aqua is an idiot, but her detect evil sense is always right.    Jesus christ and the more I read the worse it gets. Now the author is trying to half assedly make it out that the MC actually ENJOYS his company    In the WN version he dies 8 times and some of them are his desperate plea to get transported to an another world because of his party, and the eight death is the only heroic death.    Yeah, this guy is cursed alright.   GoddessEris/Thief best grill.      No need to try so hard at making yourself mad for a reason to shit on it. Actually, from the moment you hold prejudice against this series and still going in for the intention of finding faults, your opinion on this series is already worthless.       At least the last one death landed him into the Eris end.    You're worthless. And despite the shit it just expects you to lap up, I'm still enjoying reading it. Even if sometimes it makes me think   Fuck they really expect people to take this seriously even as a joke?  Even jokes have an element of believeability to them., it's what makes them relateable and funny.       Even jokes have an element of believeability to them., it's what makes them relateable and funny.   I like you.  You're relateable and funny.        How did it end anyway? Like happy ending with Eris or Eris send him to another world? Or it's just that? An ending out of nowhere where he finally died for good and he met his waifu the second time and they live happy forever after?    Ooh, nice burn bro :^) I better go get the ointment.    Yeah, I'm sure the author is so sorry right now that he didn't write all of these stuff in a way that you can relate to and believe in. What a shit author he is, right?    Wait till you hear the story of the creator of thr chuuni tribe and mc's reaction to it.     I'm the only one who holds this opinion   Assuming this was your first mistake     I think most of these WN spoilers are just people making shit up. Take it with a grain of salt. I remember completely different end spoilers for that matter.   This sounds like Al Bundy, the shota. Shit life, hates his so called friends, does some scummy things, still a somewhat decent person, yet is constantly shit on, But he still tries. I hope   Doesn't happen.     You clearly don't get the point. The WN was a success, it got itself printed into LN and even an anime adaption. This mean it's something that a lots of people acknowledged to be funny, they found it to be relatable and believable, which mean your original opinion   Fuck they really expect people to take this seriously even as a joke?   Even jokes have an element of believeability to them., it's what makes them relateable and funny.  is shit.        Nip and western humor is different, what a shock. That doesn't mean that these jokes aren't shit by western standards. Furthermore  Japan   Taste  And even further is the fact that the story is interesting and it does have its moments even if its 'humor' leaves a bad taste in your mouth.        Stop liking what i hate!      OP doesnt know that a lich is the one providing the MC healing and relief when he cant take it anymore  Wiz is best girl, for a reason, her story about her mortal friend was great and they share the same grief when it comes to Aqua and her attempts to purify Wiz     Nigger I wouldn't read it if I hated it. I'm having fun. It's jokes aren't half bad when it's not trying to be grimderp.   Also that wasn't an argument. Good job      But you're shitting on the author, are you not? The point is the author didn't write this to cater to the Western standard, he wrote it to cater to the Japan standard.  Japan   not having taste  You sure are convincing when you said that despite you're on /a/ and eat up japan shit on a daily basis. I'm not even nitpicking the fact that you just generalizing thousands of people or the fact that the cultural of western and eastern is different therefore different sense of humor and et cetera...        He wrote it to cater to the japan standard  This is good and well, but it's fairly accepted that nips don't have good taste and generally you can see that reflected in the anime that get made, and those that get second seasons and those that flop. And the masses rarely have good taste no matter the country or culture. Why do you think something like taste spawns elitists? Me being on /a/ is neither here nor there. Just because I participate in the medium doesn't mean I think it's the best thing done ever.      In the web novel, at the end the main character sacrificed himself to defeat the demon king. In heaven, as the prize, he chooses the goddess Eris/Chris to be with him. They reincarnated back to modern Japan together, but a certain someone follows them back into Japan.       a certain someone  Oh god please, not her Pls tell me its not her       It's her ,Cue the suffering.     Motherfucker    Even when gaining his happy ending with the girl he loves, the MC will never be free of  Aqua.     The suffering never ends.    This is getting misleading. What are you trying to say now? To you, at this point is the novel good or not? Which part? Why? What are you trying to prove with this last post? Are you disproving that Japan having taste is wrong alone or it's still related to the novel?  Anyway, if you think that Japan taste is bad therefore the novel is bad, then I think that you're being unfair to the novel. The novel is made to cater to Japan taste, and Japan taste alone, it has done a good job at that. If it has done a good job and you still have problem with it, then it's the problem of the Japan standard at the first place, not the novel because the novel only follow the standard. Therefore what you should criticize at the first place should be the standard, not the novel.       Eris/Chris  So same person? No wonder when darkness prayed she became her friend, since no one will     No No NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO It's like a fucking horror movie, you'll never escape, you never will.  he chooses the goddess Eris/Chris to be with him  Why the "/"?   </wbr>      They are the same person. Chris, the thief girl, is Eris's mortal form.     To you, at this point is the novel good or not? Which part? Why? What are you trying to prove with this last post? Are you disproving that Japan having taste is wrong alone or it's still related to the novel?   I've been fairly clear, it's not my fault if your reading comprehension is lacking. The novel is alright. It's attempts at 'dark humor' are exceedingly shit and treads into grimderp territory. I dissapprove in otaku taste which holds the most influence in the direction of japanese anime, LN and manga and that setting and culture has influences on authors and can be seen in this novel.  Your last point of    Therefore what you should criticize at the first place should be the standard, not the novel.  However, is perfectly apt.          Chris is just a disguise Eris, it was supposed to be because Darkness wanted a friend,but then she took a liking on being chris and things. Personally like it when Kazums ditches his team and goes to a another party adventuring with her.     mfw Aqua purified her   mfw Kazuma shouting to stop   mfw on how Wiz just tells Kazuma that she can finally be with her "mortal" friend.   mfw after that Aqua downplays it as "part of her job' as a goddess   treated as a fucking joke  The Eris healing afterwards was pretty great but still.          So Aqua will always be annoying for the entire series...      lacking in reading comprehension  I was just unsure about your stance on the 2 matters but well, it's not necessary wrong. Anyway  However, is perfectly apt.  I finished what I set out to do at the first place.        But telling me to raise my concerns with japanese culture is a bit unrealistic, right? Where can I vent such frustrations? Who would even listen to a single filthy gaijin. surely it's not so outlandish to vent them in the thread dedicated to the work that gave me these frustrations in the first place?    Even if it's reasonable for you to do so, it doesn't mean you're right while doing so. It's not like you're exactly in the wrong because everyone does it. I pointed you out despite that simply because I felt like picking a fight with some anonymous who try so hard to vent his frustration or maybe he just want a reason to shitposting  starting to read a series because he want to find faults   updating his progress of nitpicking stuffs and complaining in the thread  Now that isn't an eyesore        Her plotline is basically being useless. Even her own followers are basically labelled as stupid.    In the first place, there's no reason for you to vent had you not read it out of spite.    DAMN SON Now i'm excited for the next vol.      I found something fun to read and wanted to complain about the bits that irritated me. It's what people do when they read things that don't always agree with them. I'm enjoying it for the most part.   Read out of spite   Try hard  I didn't exactly go into this seriously, so really it's on you for taking me and my complaints so seriously. I guess I just wanted some confirmation bias more than anything, like,   Hey, this is dumb   You think it's dumb too, right?   Lets talk about why we agree  And you challenged my opinion, which is fine too, but there's no reason to attack the action of voicing my thoughts alone. Attack the thoughts themselves if you must.            Seriously? That bitch seriously needs to die.    She doesnt, also pretty much all the sneers kazuma gets from another people is because of her carelessly spreading her complaints about Kazuma around the town.    Well, it's a goddess' job to purify the undead.  Doesn't make Aqua any less ignoring, if course.      Why he still didnt drown/bury alive/ hang her?    Did you really expect anything less? MC's suffering is funny to the author. What better way to end it then by bringing the persons responsible for his suffering with him to modern times? It's like Squidward.     I didn't exactly go into this seriously, so really it's on you for taking me and my complaints so seriously  That kind of people exists, it isn't rare especially when it's summer. But I kinda get that you weren't all serious about those complains when we were arguing. There are reasons to attack the action of voicing your thought though, what you were doing is akin to shitposting. No, seriously, even if you weren't meant to do that, the act of talking bad about a series like that is just inviting faggots to follow up your posts, and that kind of baiting is no different from shitposting. And you did that 4 times. Telling you to shut up is the right thing to do (though insult you while so it's not exactly right, but it's not like anyone would back off when they're told to fuck off or shut up on an anonymous image board anyway, so eh). Feel free to criticize about a series but don't do it like that. If you've been on /a/ for a good amount of time, I think you surely know what I mean to say.       Because when all his attempts on getting rid of het and his party fails because of his high luck being negated when around them.    I think you are making shit up here. Spoilers for the end of the WN were posted that was different.    Purifying/killing one of the characters that gives him warm healing when he gets down because of his party is just goddamn.    Look you have your points, and I agree that my comments were more numerous than warranted but reread the thread and tell me my irritation towards Aqua and the other cunts isn't just.    Does Galaxy Angels, Milky Holmes, and Accelerate World make you mad as well?  I think it's time for you to stop taking things so seriously.  I like this series, btw. Unlike Shield brother, the MC always get back at everyone in the most effective and funny way possible.        Here's an alt link. https://www.mediafire.com/folder/w5<wbr>vwmebc6qt38/「この素晴らしい世界に祝福を！」ドラマCD</wbr>     You fool!" croaked the frog, "Now we shall both die! Why on earth did you do that?"  The scorpion shrugged, and did a little jig on the drownings frog's back.  "I could not help myself. It is my nature."        I didn't say that they were wrong though. After all, I am the OP.  No? Different strokes for different folks, god forbid me from feeling bad about a person life. If everything it's so simple as "stop taking things seriously" then pedophile wouldn't have been a problem since you can just tell them to "stop lusting after children".       You know that the trial was rigged by magic, right? Although, Aqua and Megumin being retards and screwing the MC over with their plans to help him should have been obvious from reading the first two volumes.    It wasn't "rigged" though. The people being brought in for testimonies and the judge decision at the end are foul plays, that's for sure, but the bell is "accurate". That last part is obvious, yes.    The three girls are pretty bad, i really hope that thief girl or that lich wins the mc bowl.    Kazuma was going to be acquitted though. However there was tampering that changed the judge and Sena's decision. When Aqua says there is dark magic or evil, she is always right.   It's a parody of the rash of stupid fucking "hurr I died but I really went to the other world and got a harem of dolls in female shapes and became super powerful and successful."  Personally I like the series, the characters are pretty unique and interesting.  Also, only idiots think Darkness was going out to get fucked by the landlord when she's so clearly waving a flag for the MC.  Newsflash, retards: fantasy isn't the same thing as reality.         Someday MC'll be happy, but today is not that day.    He'll never be happy    Darkness is just head over heels for Kazuma, but her personality gets in the way. She wants to be dominated so hard. Plus she has her father's blessing by this point.    Aqua will follow him everywhere, he'll never be happy.   I'm actually planning to read this but I don't wanna waste my time if it turns out to be shit. I have a lot of other things that I want to read.   Can you tell me OP what is your favorite anime? I'm gonna decide then whether to trust your opinion on this and not read this LN anymore. You seem pretty invested on this series.     It's shit, there, I saved you a couple hours of your life, now you're free to do smarter things with your time.    Rejoice, thief girl wins the bowl    What? What if I tell you my favourite anime is Code Grass, or the all time favorite Eva?  Most of SHAFT stuffs before 2012, which mean Bake, Nise, SZS, Pani panic dash, Maria Holic, Madoka etc      Ty. Later will try it.    that fucking cliffhanger before the epilogue   So are there spoilers for this? From what I can tell    &gt;MC Sacrifices himself to kill the DL  Meets with best girl   Is offered the same choice   (?) Asks for aqua again (?)   Lives with Eris now somehow in the same world           SAO :^)    Fucking auto-correct. And it seem like the train of Darkness x Kazama is starting to move with this 3rd volume. I like Eris but right now, I like Darkness more so it's kinda pain me she won't get the MCbowl.      &gt;(?) Asks for aqua again (?)  Nope, he asks for Eris    Hey kids  Wanna see some party tricks?     Fuck off Aqua    First she should pay her debts.    She will simply make more debts. Say you went out to buy milk and run away from the city.    He asks for Eris. Kazuma becomes close with her so it makes sense he asks if she can be with him in the end.    After Wiz got offed by Aqua she is the only healing left in his life.   Series wont be interesting unless MC goes through some hardships, like getting manipluated/NTR'ed   That web novel is pretty depressing. The MC goes through a lot of suffering and unlike gifting, it isn't played for laughs. The author is a sadist that loves making the MC suffer.    Those spoilers are for the web novel incase you didn't already notice. Kazuma asks for Eris and they live in modern Japan.   I dont get why anything of this has to do with nip taste. I mean Twilight and that web novel about edgylord and loli vamp/Stupid bunny are both horrible.  I think some WB have a tendency to repeating "plot device" like everyone is a fucking retard in shieldbro     It finally works, thanks.     Darkness getting molested by Kobolds while Aqua gets chewed, Kazuma ordering Megumin to make them all explode  Only hear first track and i am already liking it.     It gets better once Wiz and Yun Yun shows up.   The author just isn't very good at comedy, you can't just play off every single horrific scenario as funny and expect people to roll with it, occasionally you need to play it straight so that we can see that the characters actually do care and aren't just complete assholes.   Why characters should not just be complete assholes? Aqua a kusomegami, megumi an adorable chu2byou and darkness a semen demon(in all meanings)    Gintama does it right     Because if you don't care about what the characters are doing and know they'll never receive any serious comeuppance for being dicks, it's hard to get invested in what they're doing?    Exactly, Gintama is a perfect example.         Seriously Wiz is more a goddess than Aqua.     At least tank was best girl.     romance   necessary    Not really related to Gifting, but it's finally happening.    seiken tsukai  Shit      14   Holy fucking fuck, finally after a year and a half..      Different artist though, but the art isn't bad.    Fianna volume makes me happy. Too bad everything is going to be solved in one volume.    Artist from this series took over.  https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/<wbr>index.php?title=Leviathan_of_the_Co<wbr>venant</wbr></wbr>      Why the fuck did this take so long anyway?    I dunno, really. Seeing as they changed the illustrator, I guess a severe Japanese cold?      2015年7月24日発売    one more month      What's happening?    There's this your usual shitty LN series with it's usual pendulum-of-quality where it's readable one volume and not so much in the other. Now this one actually managed to be 'good' in it's latest volume, let alone readable and we're somehow being expectant of it's next volume. Damn thing didn't get released since more than a year though.     tfw it took like 8 volumes to get good   I really have nothing to do in my life do I.     Fianna is one of the heroines that the author does better in characterizing I think. She doesn't fall into absurd extremes unlike the other girls.    I am happy vol. 4 will feature hot springs and Wiz    I like this. This is great. Are there any other LN illustrations from untranslated volumes?    Plenty of that sort of stuff.    Mishima Kurone doing LN illustrations makes me happy, but it also makes me upset that I don't know moon and can't read the web novel.     she doesnt hit him but she gets flustered instead  Best lich     It's all love.      Who is this and what is happening    It's Chris and I think she's being tickled.    Holy shit, fucking finally.      These are truly amazing.   I wonder if there was any other reasons why Chris chose to drop off Darkness in Kazuma's team.        Because she wanted to help Darkness. Darkness ,despite being an extreme pervert, is a force of good.    She leave her alone since she found "friends" which darkness wished for but Chris was suppose to disappear but hey she like being in mortal form.    Who is tickling her?     Well, I mean aside from those obvious ones.  Darkness is some sort of hardcore devout to Eris's religion, and I can see Eris helping her out. But I also wonder if she could somehow tell if Kazuma was a good person or even from another world back then or just some sort of coincidence.    Probably MC.          It's been forever. I can finally see my waifu again.    Eris good incarnate, only girl that felt pity and didnt laugh at his death.      Chris. Basically the MC was "invited" (read kidnapped) by the Princess to the capital. During his time there, a 'Robin Hood' started appearing. So he volunteered to be a bounty hunter for the princess and used his A+ rank Luck to deduce that the thief will strike the rotten aristocrat's mansion next.  So he setup a trap...and caught Chris.  And then together, they go on an adventure. One of the few that the MC really showed what he is truly capable of if those 3 are not with him.        MC has always been shown to be amazing. Honestly, despite having the 3 stooges as a party, they are probably the best you could ask for when it comes to really difficult situations. It's just that outside of extraordinary situations they tend to be a pain in the neck and useless.     Go on an adventure  What was their goal?      Earlier in the story, the MC died again when the demon force laid siege on the capital.  In heaven(?), Eris asked him to find and return 2 lost legendary weapons left behind by previous reincarnates . She stressed that although other people can only use a portion of the weapons' power, the weapons are dangerous enough (body swapping and control any summoned demon).  The MC says sure maybe if I run across them. He didn't think much of it until Chris said she is looking for 2 legendary weapons with extraordinary power.  Then he realized that the Princess just received one of them as a present, and that the giver might be planning to swap body with her and gain power.  So together, they sneaked into the castle's treasure vault. Due to his insistence on picking up an UNCENSORED Japanese ero book, they tripped the castle alarm.  From then on, the duo defeated every single guards, heros (including the Japanese hero with the sword), royal magicians, and everything else until they reach the princess' chamber, were the 3 girls and the princess were at.  There Darkness picked up on what the duo were doing, so she let them past. Megumin was too busy idolizing 'the mask thief' to do anything. Aqua, being the clueless idiot, fought back and magically suppressed the duo.  The duo made a dash for the princess. Chris stole 1 legendary weapon and (here is the good part) the MC stole the princess' engagement ring, that she has since she was born and supposed to give to her husband.  Then they both jumped off the room balcony and into darkness. Never seen again except for their legendary run.                      &gt;Wiz got offed by Aqua  Fucking casual spoiler.      After Wiz got offed by Aqua  Why I read this?  WHY?       Wow   Also  died again  Are you for cereal?       Anyone got raws where the pages are scanned individually? It's a very minor inconvenience, but it is off-putting.    Pray that the LN wont follow the WN Hope fucking fully it wont since its pretty Heart achingly sad      What happened to Darkness and Megumin at the end?   Fucking Aqua i swear to God     I think this is someone just making shit up. Seriously, the author might make Kazuma suffer, but this is a slapstick story not a suffering story.     Its just a comedy anon  ITS  JUST  A   COMEDY             That's what I'm saying. There's a shit ton of misinformation in this thread I feel. This is a comedy, not some fucking edgy shit like Shield Hero or other reincarnation stories.    I don't remember hearing anything about Wiz dying. The rest of the spoilers are spot on though.   Anri-sama LN when?   I have doubts honestly. Probably a few truths mixed with lies here and there. Like this post  seems to be mostly truths. However this post  I'm pretty sure is bullshit.       change illustrator  Wait really? So there's no more kitchen knife swords?     It's not. Check the archives. An anon who read both versions of the story spoiled the ending of the WN while summerizing the events of future light novel volumes. He even talked about Chris and Eris's scar that reveals their identity.    I thought Eris and Chris was the same person?    mind spoiling what she did ?    If you don't think romance is necessary then don't put a bunch of girls in it. I can watch Arslan Senki perfectly fine without romance because there's only one girl in the cast.    But it is. Not the page, but the spoiler itself is bullshit. Here's the link to the web novel if you'd like to check it yourself.   https://web.archive.org/web/2013102<wbr>5151907/http://ncode.syosetu.com/n7<wbr>145bl/   This one however is true. However it seems that anon is spreading a lot of bullshit by mixing truths with a shit ton of lies.   </wbr></wbr>      They are. Check the picture linked in this post.   Both Chris and Eris have an identical scar on their face. This is only one of the many hints that link the two together.      And why is a goddess going on the mortal world as a thief? What she do? Steal the hearts of people.    read     Just randomly picked up this series and there is a LN? Where can i read it? Is it even translated?   Dumping illustrations         I want to bully Wiz.          try googling the title and then add light novel. google does wonders    Wiz or Chris are the only choice or both.      Go away Aqua.    Neat hiding skill.         Did Vanir just use his ability to read everyone's minds?  Wiz and Yunyun are the best.               Putting that hiding skill in good use eh..      That's what you get for reading LNs and not expecting anything other than awful garbage.          How many volumes are there so far?    As many as I am dumping  v6      Aqua is so cute, it's a shame she's so her.    Whats happening here        Why is Aqua either being a drunkard or doing something stupid in this illustration?      Each cover illustration is a parody of another LN series' cover illustration.     that scar  HNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG<wbr>GGG</wbr>     Wait so is he kill again since he met Eris?     Each cover illustration is a parody of another LN series' cover illustration.  That explains everything.      masochist fighting against an enemy with whip  Darkness has already lost.     He will be kill many many time...to the point that Eris begs him to be more careful.  For example,  this time he was killed because he got cocky and ran into a group of goblins while defending the city. The goblins did him in, to the laughter of his 3 teammates (I mean really, goblins?)       As much as she loves pain, she does have a smidge of dignity, standards, and preferences on who she'd prefer to lose to. As messed up as they are, anyhow.   What happened to the other girls in the WN end?   You just realized that?  Too bad that not only her natural is fuck up, her preference is also fuck up, which mean the "dignity" you're talking about is probably different from the common dignity.       dying of Goblins  Really fucking really?     Mind telling which series??  I have no fucking clue      Nah, I recognized some of them but I didn't know all of them were parodies.    Well, she was frustrated that she couldn't participate in the fight against Destroyer and there's a moment against Beldia and Jack Frost where she shows pride as an actual crusader to protect or not give up.  Of course, I don't know if getting dominated by a woman is in her preferences. But her face doesn't really seem all that crazy hot about it.      She only likes depravated fat old men.     chuuni  I wish this shit would die already     But she's stated she likes anyone with a bad, lecherous stare, skinny or fat is fine.   But Darkness ignored my retort and clenched her fist as if she couldn’t endure it anymore, and said passionately: “Simply put, the type I like is the total opposite of that man who will achieve great things even if I leave him alone! He must not be too eye catching, either too fat or too skinny will do. It would be best if he loves me but has a weak will, lusting after other girls if they are a bit kind to him. A mandatory criteria will be having a lecherous look and is horny all year round. If he looks down on the hardship of life and just want to live his life easily like a trash will be great. If he has debts, that’s even better! He also has to drink all day and refuse to work, always grumbling that ‘this is the fault of society’. He will then hit me with empty beer bottles and tell me: ‘Hey Darkness, use your slutty body to earn back some cash!’... Hmmm…!”        First part is Kazuma while second part is Aqua?I would not want to party with such a man , think of all the debts!   I wonder if Aqua would keep fucking with Kazuma even if he dies and reincarnates in another world.  New episode Soon  new chapter raws also out   captain a cute    Nee-chan  ;_;    I hate to inform you of this kid but your nee-chan was a stuck up cunt who didn't want to be partners with the hero of this manga.    Nurse Kobayashi is a beauty    Yamano family is a lower class and Eiko worked her way to become a pilot only to see a dude from underground getting fasttracked.    so Capt's cosplaying as a medic this time again?    So the plot is still going nowhere    She isn't this time, working as an emergency nurse under captain uniform, no mask.      yep   truly the best girl    Am I the only one who thinks she looks terrible with her hair down?     Tomboy captain best captain   Nihei wants to sell it so badly.   Looks like it'd hold an onahole.     you will never be able to buy your own Sasaki from MHz     Spotted this during the first glance as well. It does look nice but this is kinda shameless plug.    The spirit of capitalism has found him.    You can buy a bear instead.     /m/ translation done, typesetting etc in progress but there's a readable script on googledocs. <br/>      Then they should've made better looking THI hoodies in white, green, pink and purple.    Nice to see Captain doing field works when her people need the most.  But no more immortal secrets?      Where do I buy this?    here  http://m-hz.net/?pid=90156386     so its confirmed for a timeskip then?    no? it's right after the battle       New episode Soon  10 hours to go...     And then 3 days for subs    i don't get it, i see the episode every friday with subs  with spanish subtitles    Hey I just started season 2 what the hell is this miniature thing?  Pic related 1/2      that tentacle up her ass  I never noticed     2/2    That's Ochiai's waifu    Ah I see...  Is there any real explanation or no? I'm looking at the wiki and theres no info      Read the manga, faggot.    I will after the current season ends.   Which one should I download, and is the 1080 just an upscale?     That's just Bestgirl, anon. Don't worry about it.    Read the manga you colossal faggot         Well tanikaze finally gets his true waifu.     $32 for a fucking thermos  The fuck is this?     Both TV and BD. BD has different angles.    Hopefully its truly made for space to justify its price     2D books      nolan pls     Anon, I don't understand what you mean.    Even if she was a bit cunt, she didn't deserve to die. She could be a good tsundere-type member of Tanikaze harem.    surprised she even got noted again    there are people here who would reject the clone of their dead waifu just because she's made of placenta  You people are horrible.    she's a gauna not your waifu    Well meme'd, my friend.    Pity Beni didn't get superior Tanikaze genes.  But then probably the Gauna would've been made invincible.     fuckin' delusional hoshijirofags man   every thread without fail   is a season 3 already announced?   BeniJiro returns   has Hoshijiro's personality and memories   has a split personality   switches to seductive, near-yandere Benisuzume once in a while   mfw        Do want.   New chapter in an hour, right before the stream at latest.   Sadly no.    what are they doing there? saying good bye?    Sales are shit. No S3    Why don't they just sell fucking GBEs    Looked like sales were pretty good last I saw. It was something like 19th this season for all anime at that point.     half of what S1 made   good      You are not alone, anon.   Is yucie dead? Where did the stream go?     To cc   Sidonia threads are so fucking dead it's not even funny.   I'm gonna miss these threads after the season's over. God damn it guys, don't leave me.     Yeah, it's too bad but I guess there really isn't all that much to talk about. It's not one of those stories where you've got no idea what's going on.    Well, now that season 2 ends, they'll probably only get rarer. Doesn't help that the manga is monthly. There's rarely much to discuss.    We will have less frequent threads, but that hopefully means the ones we will have will be better.   I just gotta say the previous episode made my dick diamonds. It's been awhile since I was so excited watching anime.   I sure am expecting the next episode to make my dick diamonds.    This coming episode would break a diamond.    Almost everything has been talked, and Sidonia is not as shippers-friendly as other shows so there are not many shipperfags to drive threads up.  Kinda sad but that's the cycle of it.     GBE is firing today  How closely does the series follow the manga? Are there any crucial details that have been skipped over?  This has definitely sky rocketed to the top of my favorites. Makes me booty blasted there isn't more shit like this.     Didn't cc stop working?    Everything good was skipped. Read the fucking manga, you lazy asshole.   As usual, if you'll see anything fucked up or can think of better phrasing, tell me right away.   No. Was fired back to the basement     First three volumes of manga are free on Amazon right now (2048px).    I know I shouldn't ask for this, but can anyone tell me how to find the Douyu stream? I have no idea what to look for on the site. Otherwise, I'd be fine with any other working stream. Aside from Yucie, the one's I know don't seem to be in use.   Check the archive.            I've participated in just about every thread in the last 2 months and I don't remember anyone mentioning any other streams aside from the ones I already know. Besides, there's only a few minutes left. I know it's a lot to ask, but couldn't you help out an anon for once?  ;_;       You should be able to find it in those few minutes.    Well, I've been looking and I can't. I'm desperate here, man.         tfw I can just copy a link while Angela is playing here  Nah, no spoonfeeding man, gotta respect that board culture          That fucking tea commercial    KITAAAAAA   is that from one of the newer chapters? I stopped following a month or two ago   AH AH AH SIDONIA  And it's lagging as usual.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127209381  Gives me nothing. Fucking hell.      Man. This new Horihone Saizou manga isn't as good as his others.       Oh shit, vag flowers!    HOLY FUCK, THEY ARE ENDING THE ANIME     They are taking over Lem IX anyway, so this still makes sense.       Those 80's-hair-kun and pony-tails-chan again.  Fucking hell. My dick was so ready. Now I have to wait for the raw.    Original anime shit once again doesn't make much sense. What was all that tension in the previous ep if they can just sent all the forces in no time?        End it with Blame!  where the fuck is the live stream?   They just have gauna getting wiped out of IX in one shot. Why not?    douyu    Man, that Sidonia stump floating through space looks so fucking sad.   CONGRATULATION ENDING   It doesn't help that the manga is slow as fuck right now So much shit happened on a single chapter of blame, or abara or biomega or at the beggining of knigths of sidonia But right now it's fucking sloooow     Fucking lazy reuse of scenes   Couldn't he have gotten out of those? Or does Kunato not know about the artificial kabi blades embedded throughout Tsugumori that can be launched for this exact purpose?    At least they managed to patch it up. Just imagine if they couldn't have done that.   Will there be a season 3?  Welp, the last ep sucked bear's balls   In this page, some lines are out of position.   Jesus, original ending incoming   that doesn't help much there's over 1000 channels. I'd never be able to find it in time. Just give the stream #.   Pfhahahahaha, no S3 for you. Sidonia dies with S2   Huh. Maybe they weren't separated properly in the script or something. I'll fix it soon.     not raising your elbow so forearm is aligned to a straight hand facing outwards.  0/10 terrible salute Shamfur Dispray!!! commit seppuku      Sol and penis killed Sidonia   dont forget, you have your own little tsumugi between your legs as a reminder.   Decent ending, all things considered. They didn't cover Kunatochiai going "What do you mean, I don't get to fuck both Enajiros?" to Sasaki, but hopefully it'll be on the BD version.  wooh did anybody screencap that yure+izana poster at the end??   He might not know about that, actually.    Kunato a shit.   so, no season 3?  Cooking has started. That's it. No S3   I expected him to die this time, but Nihei pussied out. Them being cool and all didn't work either.    Kunato can't die until he's finally made up slightly for being such a massive fuckup and kills Cloneochiai with his bear hands.  Accept it, anon.     nothing about Kanata (the new chimera) ?   Never    But Clonechiai haven't done anything wrong.   So who was responsible for killing Sidonia?  Tsumugi   inexperienced Hiroyuki Seshita   jews and no money      whick BD has more of Blame!?   He'd better sell some honokas.    They did 'read manga to know more' ending    Season 3 confirmed. They said they wait Nihei to end his work and they are currently busy with Ajin Movies so the announcement will not be made at the end of the episode.    It's a nice way to say "no S3, sorry"    No it's pretty old. How do you manage to forget that scene   nop, there is 3 movies for Ajin so S3 probably late next year.   He kinda did. See posts above.     Oichai clone standing like nothing happen    Just kill me.   they actually animated those vergina flower    Best girl won.    Actually best girls won.     princess carry the alien princess with your headless mecha  Loved that scene in the manga.     i hope she die soon   Alright, mangafriends, I need to know. How far "ahead" is the manga? Is it far enough that we'd get a season 3? Do you think the anime is successful enough to warrant a season 3?  I'm an animefag at the moment, but if I'm not going to be getting my weekly fix of sidonia through the anime, I might have to switch to the manga. They fucking blueballed me with SnK, and I haven't started the manga for that yet  mostly because I don't really like the manga's art style, but I like sidonia's manga's style , I won't be able to deal with not seeing a new season for either of them.     Come on Nihei, hurry up and finish Sidonia so we can see what you got ready for us next.  inb4 he goes on hiatus      hating Tsumugi      No tentacle tongue     Yes, fuck you and your beloved dick abomination.    only if you fill it with Tsumigi being "cute" and if we get a season 3, i really wish that they skip a bit of it    Didn't he announce that he was working on that one thing, with no information other than a title? It was called "android *something*". It was quite a while ago.     hating Tsumugi so hard      inb4 he goes on hiatus  it is a fucking monster who smells like shit for traveling all the time on those pipes, at least it could take the form of a qt monster girl but instead we get a 3 km penis who acts like a retard and sounds like rubber     249 and 167, for some reasons, stayed alive for the whole season.    Love the extra Hoshijiro service they had there.   Season 3 when?    hoshijiro shitting everything up from beyond the grave   Nagate completely forgets about Izana   Being an Izanafag is suffering.       because they want to photosynthesi together    There was, among other things.   When will we have another cool SciFi anime?   better romance than Nagata harem    I'm just about ready to see Nihei put the icing on Izana's suffering cake.    Ajin anime is soon     those tiny THI logos   I once tried a drinking game where I would take a shot every time a THI logo appeared on screen (the same logo on the same object in two shots doesn't count, though) and I gave up about ten minutes in. I could have died from alcohol poisoning.      when people see the selling point of mecha highschool girl        the mechs are women   Regular mechs make me hard. Bio-mechs do it too. You would think mechs that look like qt highschool girls would be extra boner, but for some reason this is an anti-boner.       Isn't this shit full of gore?   CONGRATULATION!     They aren't real girls, just soldiers with PTSD.     Why did they show us Kanata and Kunato (Ochai) seiing the battle between Tsumu and Beni if they don't plan to do a season 3?   Season 3 eventually, friend. It's like Fafner Exodus S2. These things... they take time.     isn't KOS full of smell fetish and genitals    So they can come back later, and claim that upon popular demand, they decided to make one more season,  which might not be the final one either.     It is. Joshi Kouhei just turns that up a notch.  It is not a bad thing but I don't think it will be animated any times soon.       167  Note that this dude managed to survive the last battle of S1 as well. The man is like the no-name hero.     Is the manga worth picking up if I'm a Hoshijirofag?   the mango is 10 time more glorious    Yeah but I dont want to start reading it if they're just going to keep Hoshijiro in a cage forever again    She gets Gaunafied early in the manga too.  Seems Benny has even been forgotten about.      if you like black and white stuff    Speaking as one of the original, surviving, enduring Hoshijirofags who has to put up with abuse from every other newage faction, yeah.   Get used to it.       read the mango and you will relise how awesome captaint is and forget Hoshijiro    If he was one of the handful who survived THAT, he's the baddest of redshirts.   I want to be punched by Sasaki.   Izana and Yure take a selfie.     Sasaki will never suffocate you with her Sasakis     Better version.     better  Your waifu2x abomination looks like shit.      That fucking pose   Real estate lady's face  Love it. Yuhata for Vol.3 was also a cutie.       OC being used to advertise the BDs  That's really fucking sad. I didn't mind the episodes until I realised that it's over. What an absolute waste of time. They could have done all the previous shit properly with all the time they wasted on Izana.     Izana and Tsumugi are both garbage characters.    All selfies.    Here is your reply.   Even BD/DVD don't sell that well they should net profits just because they recycle many things.   Midori is cute.    I want one with extremely blushing Captain.     Yuhata forever alone with her plamo     replace the high cost unit with Tsugumori 2 and ignoring captain battle armor are unacceptable, but they even go this far    Recap ED wasn't that bad.    Smoogy cliffhanger?    Who doesn't.   Those who don't want to be punched are pussies and faggots .   Those must be truly soft.        The cockpit breach in the manga has Tanikaze looking like he is going to snap while the anime made it look comedic.   more suffering pls   Holy fuck, I feel empty now. But at least I got some more Hoshijiro, so I can live with not having a third season for a while, though I sure hope they'll make one eventually.   Loved how they made her seem much more "alive", in this, though that honestly makes the fact that she won't show up again for at least a while even tougher.   Well, definitely doesn't look like they have it planned, at least. Let's just hope it sells enough, then perhaps they may make one once manga nears completion.   I personally prefer how the anime made most of her scenes, but otherwise, sure. Then you can join us other Hoshijirofags in hoping that Nihei hasn't forgotten BeniJiro.    that pic   ;_;                  Based   I'm pretty sure that was intended as a parallel to show how far he has come?         girl  sure, whatever     Nagate: What happened to Hoshijiro... the placenta?   Kunato: It's being kept as a valuable sample, for now.   Nagate: I see...   Kunato: After all, anything important, should always have back up.   mfw   So Enajiro getting separated from Nagate in quarantine is presumably in the Director's cut? Or would they not even bother since she was stark naked?          When your reminded of an old tv show call Skyland.     Hopefully that is, as well as Kunatochiai getting angry that he doesn't get the second Placenta.    wrapping up all the hints and foreshadowing  I sure fucking hope that includes bringing BeniJiro back. Preferably complete with Hoshijiro's personality and all her memories.      I'm somehow really happy to see Kobayashi able to to have normal interactions with the crew now that she took off her mask.     My dick is  megastructure     You will never wake up and be surrounded by honokas     Shouldn't Sasaki be the one who tells Nagate what has happened to Benijiro?     bringing BeniJiro back  I would expect something to happen, but at this point in terms of actual story relevance all the Hoshijiro 'clones' seem to be chimera production machines and nothing more.   I wouldn't say she looks terrible but having her hair up definitely suits her much better.        fuck that, i want to hand clasp with Nihei     all  The last one from Beni isn't a Chimera production machine, though. How the fuck did you forget that?    Dammmm this ep was dope  tfw no lifeless psuedo-human to rape me with tentacle tongue   Why live      Because Sasaki confiscated it before Ochiai could put it to use, then nothing happened with it, at all IIRC.  Has there been any development with the last one that I've forgotten about?      She's locked up at THI right now. Maybe she got freed. I hope Nihei didn't forget. Or at least he plans on doing something with her after the anime jogged his memory.       Short hair Kobayashi is the best Kobayashi.    See, that's exactly my point. They've been used to make chimeras and then fucking nothing. At this point their only real contribution to the story is making chimeras.  I'd be less surprised to see Tsumugi turn human-sized than to see a truly human Hoshijiro clone at this point.       that short hair cap at the ending scene    I'm not a manga reader so I didn't know who it was but it was the only 'new' scene added to the last clip compilation so it caught my eyes.   So it was the qt cap again eh      One thing about Sidonia that I like is how they pull a fedora-tipping list of japanese name. It's not that generic japanese name that you see in average anime, no....   The fuck are you talking about?     Izana shippers yapping about their fanfiction shit a few weeks ago   best girl comes back to win the Nagatebowl  Sasuga       Well, considering what's happened in the manga recently, there's probably gonna be quite a few changes. After all, between Benisuzume's final defeat and now it's almost been none stop war against the LMUS. Wasn't she taken by Toha on Kobayashi's orders, anyway? With Kobayashi seemingly having a big change of heart and the danger apparently being somewhat over for now, I could see BeniJiro return sometime soon.  By the way, the way they made the kissing scene in the anime, it makes me wonder again just how much of those actions were "Hoshijiro's" and how much of her memories and such have returned. She seemed very conscious, at least.   They've also represented the idea of fully "human" copies of people throughout the series. Besides, BeniJiro hasn't been used for making chimeras, at least from what we know, so that doesn't support your argument.  Once again, I'd argue that it would be strange if there wasn't more in store for her, since the gauna-copy idea has been present throughout all of the series.             Preferably complete with Hoshijiro's personality and all her memories  not going to happen     Not to mention that the closest thing to a 'big bad' is a parasite that isn't a Gauna at all and is a copy of a human's memories. Very Lockean.   My friend, this meme of yours... It's old and stale.        my deluded friend, your waifu is dead      Lol, what, did you completely miss the fact that Benajiro attacking Nagate was clearly juxtaposed with Izana trying to save him? I seriously doubt Izana is anywhere close to getting the N, but to claim that what happened today counts as winning for anybody is laughable.  Unless you were talking about his first love, the bag of rice.        lol      lol  Typical moron.     Nagate holding Benijiro's body inside the cockpit   Nagate's Tsugumori holding Tsumugi' body   Izana's body being inside the guardian's trunk  Poor Izana just can't win this race       not gauna   no penis  She's not even trying.      All this suffering of hers is her own doing. She should just accept that she's simply an important friend to him.    NOBLE CONFIDENT     so that doesn't support your argument.  That's not my argument. My argument is that the only plot-relevant contributions of the clones were the resulting chimeras. BeniJiro has been locked up and has contributed absolutely nothing since. Besides, BeniJiro hasn't done anything surprisingly human like anyway. EnaJiro managed to actually write to some degree, that's much more impressive than forcefully shoving tentacles down Nagate's throat IMO.  I think Nihei is just using the Hoshijiro clones as a vehicle for the running question in Sidonia, namely whether placenta copies could be considered human if they were able to copy a human precisely enough in the first place (closest was Shou and it 'devolved' when it consciously realized it wasn't human).  We'll see what's coming, but I don't even think BeniJiro would have any place in the story at this point. Bring her back as what? Purely a love interest/curiosity? I guess she could also come back as the magical gauna-human translator who brings communication or the magical gauna with a heart of gold that fights for humanity, but both of those would be cheesy as fuck.         I don't see this in any episodes this season, or do I miss something?     Wanting to get intimate with a freak of nature   When top tier Christmas cakes like Sasaki and Kobayashi are around      She did? After the date. She accepts Nagate's "Of course I care about you" and says that she couldn't ask more of him.    The anime is around 5-10 chapters behide the manga, I can expected another season of sidonia or a movie but not anytime soon.    She should've taken Kobayashi's course of action immediately after growing girly bits since that would've concisely solved her dilemma.     I guess she could also come back as the magical gauna-human translator who brings communication or the magical gauna with a heart of gold that fights for humanity, but both of those would be cheesy as fuck.   Read Zeb-Noid. Yes, BeniJiro being the monstergirl who brings the UNDERSTANDING end is appropriate and thematic, especially since the issue of Human/Gauna misunderstandings and them consistently trying to improve on the "become more humanlike" thing has been repeated throughout the series.      Nagate might just answer with that because Izana forced him to, but he is dense and Izana knows so that didn't seem to be a case.     Nagate   dense  He knows when he wants a girl. See: Hoshijiro and Tsumugi.      What? I don't understand what you are saying. Nagate answered with that because he does care about Izana, you can't deny that. She is basically family to him.    GWARRRH!    Oh fuck, forgot about that I guess. I have a hard time recalling all the details about the manga.   I'd saying a what BeniJiro has done is quite a lot more advanced than what EnaJiro did. She showed quite obvious emotion, sentience and self-awareness, compared to the small amount EnaJiro showed.  Besides, an UNDERSTANDING-ending doesn't have to be as cliché and cheesy as you make it out to be. I could see Nihei pulling it off in a unique manner. And as  said, it would be very fitting. Not only that, but Kobayashi's newfound gentleness makes such an ending seem even more possible.         He might miss Izana's point, which could intend to be romantically.    I haven't read Zeb-Noid so I have no idea what you're referencing (and I don't want spoilers either). If BeniJiro becomes the magical translator I sure as shit hope Nihei comes up with some very good answers to various things that contradict this possibility and/or make it unlikely: 1. Why BeniJiro and not EnaJiro (which to this point has shown more intelligence, remember that the 'kiss' happened while still connected to Benisuzume) 2. Why can't Tsumugi talk to Gauna? 3. Why did Gauna-Shou devolve when it realized what it was? How would BeniJiro prevent this from happening while also being perfectly conscious of her nature?  I REALLY hope the manga ends differently or Nihei brings some proper development to the table and doesn't end it on some crap deus ex machina magical monstergirl bullshit.  Also, I don't necessarily agree about Gauna actively trying to become more humanlike, the observed behavior could just as easily be explained as Gauna eating and copying Higgs-related shit simply because that's what Gaunas do.           No might needed, he completely, 100%, missed it. The point is that he does care about her very much, she didn't have to "force" him.  I get the feeling English is not your first language, we are probably just arguing about nothing!     Benisuzume shows a hell of a lot more intelligence and self-awareness that EnaJiro. EnaJiro was barely able to recognize herself in the mirror when we last saw her. BeniJiro on the other hand shows a tactical mind and a whole lot of sentience and self-awareness in the kissing scene. So much so in fact, that it makes me wonder whether she might actually have had some kind of reasoning behind what she did.     She showed quite obvious emotion, sentience and self-awareness  While connected to Benisuzume. Pretty sure BeniJiro didn't do anything special once Benisuzume was dead. EnaJiro showed intelligence and improvement while completely disconnected from a Gauna true body.  Benisuzume's intelligence isn't in doubt as it has clearly demonstrated its capabilities numerous times, all I'm saying is that BeniJiro, alone, hasn't done shit.       She is disconnected from the gauna at this point, and still shows emotion and self-awareness. She might have actually gotten "control" over Benisuzume to some extent when it lot most of its placenta. The normal eyes definitely might hint at that.  Of course, it's all speculation for now, but I still would say that her return is not unlikely.      See   I see you're operating under the assumption that Benisuzume=BeniJiro, I don't necessarily agree. Benisuzume obviously shows intelligence, as such BeniJiro as an appendage of Benisuzume could clearly show intelligence. The question is if BeniJiro by itself, alone, is intelligent. So far there has been no evidence of this. When Benisuzume dies BeniJiro becomes idle/inert and doesn't do anything.  As an analogy, Tsumugi's penis tentacle also clearly shows intelligence, but it's Tsumugi herself that's intelligent, not her appendage. This could very well be the case with Benisuzume and BeniJiro.           See  She's she also still mumbles as if sleeping, and the anime even has her moving her body accordingly.  Also, no. I'm not at all operation under that assumption. I agree that they're two distinct beings, but it seems like the mimicked brain gets some extent of control what the gauna itself has lost a lot of placenta. The changing eyes seem like a strong hint, to me.       Oh my god enough with the eyes. They don't even look normal in that panel.     Ohhh, missed that connection there. Good eye.    Pic related is even more fitting.   But they clearly change to much more human eyes, along with her demeanor as well as the fact that she had those eyes during Benisuzume's recovery. You can't tell me that doesn't mean anything.       Forgot pic.    This seems to unintentionally reflect art evolution in both anime and manga.    For fuck's sake, I keep forgetting things. Keep in mind that the art style has changed significantly between that and the final Beni battle. He uses a lot less black at that point. The situation is also quite different.     That's after the kiss, BeniJiro doesn't do anything noteworthy after that. I'm going by the manga by the way. Also the eyes don't change, they're human throughout.  The mimicked brain does obviously get some control, EnaJiro clearly proves this. I just don't see anything that would make BeniJiro, after being cut off, any more special than Ena.  All I hope is that if Nihei does go the route of making BeniJiro special he'll also provide some explanation that wouldn't invalidate several events.         She gives birth to Kanata    The fact we haven't seen her do much yet proves she's special.   Full retard.       I think that's more of a changing art style than any significance. Nagate's eyes are drawn in exactly the same style in the top panel. So are Sasaki's a few pages before, and she's on Sidonia, nowhere near any Benisuzume placenta.     What? No it's not lol. It's like 25-30 chapters behind depending on what scene you want to talk about.  Unrelated question. i'm trying to find the first mention of Kanata in the manga. The earliest reference I can find is the end of chapter 36. Is there one sooner than that?       He very probably went back to check on the previous panel to create a panel, yet he couldn't be bothered to darken the iris? While keeping Nagate's eyes black?   A 2-leafer points out that Lala's house does exist.    panel  *parallel     Again, she's clearly more self-aware that EnaJiro (who's honestly seems pretty brain damaged) when her eyes go normal. She acts the same until she falls unconscious and she still shows the same signs of self-awareness after she's cut off. What I'm trying to say is this: I think that, when Benisuzume lost most of it's placenta, BeniJiro got control. And she seems to be the same person both before and after she's cut off.   What about Sasaki's eyes in pic related?      survived   Nagate's eyes are drawn in the same style in multiple panels. BeniJiro's eyes don't change, pic related.   All BeniJiro does is mutter 'no' and 'um' after being disconnected, then falls unconscious. That's still pretty brain damaged to me. Also her eyes are always normal, only Benisuzume itself has the weird eyes (which it keeps until it foams).  From a storytelling standpoint your theory makes perfect sense, as in Benisuzume was the big bad for a long while so it would only be natural that her clone would also be special/extra smart. But so far the clone hasn't done anything to suggest this.         What? Not sure what you mean by here eyes   This scene was cut  ;_;    In the BD, friend. They had to make room for the ending sequence for the TV broadcast. Maybe. Hopefully.     They aren't completely black. Besides, BeniJiro is drawn with quite a lot more detail in there compared to most characters in other panels. In the end, it's not like it even matters all that much considering my argument. The eyes changing are a clear sign that the mimicked brain has some measure of control. Whether they look entirely human or not doesn't really matter. She is, after all, not completely human.    https://twitter.com/SIDONIA_anime/s<wbr>tatus/614488266914443264  今週日曜の宇宙最速上映会では最終話のディレクターズカット版が上映とな<wbr>りますが…</wbr>   これまた凄い濃密な内容です。   尺の都合によりOA版で描ききれなかったあのシーンこのシーンがてんこ盛<wbr>り。</wbr>  director's cut confirmed    </wbr>     Err, I think we've confused each other.  Think you meant to respond to someone else other than me here <br/>        Subarashii.    That's the point, they don't change. Nihei uses lighter eyes when the characters are experiencing strong emotions, Benijiro are fixed, like a cat looking at its prey. Even accounting for evolving art style they look nothing like Hoshijiro's used to look.     BeniJiro's eyes don't change though, not in the manga at least.    You're grasping at straws.    I don't even understand what you're arguing for anymore. So the Gauna copied Hoshijiro's eyes, perhaps somewhat imperfectly and/or without the full 'range' actual human eyes have. And they don't change after being copied.  How does that show anything related to the clone's intelligence again?        I am glad this is ending so I don't have to drop this. It took such a nosedive after the introduction of Tsumugi and could have been salvage if he actually did something with her.    I thought you were the same person and didn't understand the point I was trying to make.    season 3 announcement at the end  Pls Polygon   Yes, but that might just be up to the fact that she's not human. She's also riddled with placenta-bits all over the place, so she isn't in the most human physical condition. I'll try to summarize my point: I think BeniJiro is the closest to a perfect Hoshijiro clone. Benisuzume is able to make full use of Hoshijiro's combat experience and tactical thinking. Meanwhile, the gauna EnaJiro was connected to performed poorly in comparison, likely meaning that the brain wasn't as accurately copied. When Benisuzume loses a lot of placenta, BeniJiro takes some extent of control and clearly shows that sentience, intelligence, emotion and the ability to recall some of Hoshijiro's memories. So yeah, I hope that makes sense.   Benijiro are fixed, like a cat looking at its prey.  To me her expression rather seems to imply longing and sadness, especially with that "No...".   What are you talking about? They change between the Benisuzume eyes and the human-looking ones just like in the anime.  Alright, I wanna draw a little, so I might take a little longer to reply.                   What? No, I didn't mean to imply anything about the clone's intelligence. I think there is more than one conversation going on.  I keep seeing some anon insist that Benajiro's eyes looking human instead of creepy/dice faced/whatever are somehow proof that Benajiro might be a perfect copy of Hoshijiro. Anon said that she looked human while in the cockpit, my point was that it looks nothing like a normal human (...tentacles aside, of course): between the fixed stare and the cold eyes, in fact, it looks like a corpse. I'm only talking about the manga cockpit sequence, though.      Question, what did they ever do with the placenta? I remember reading about it but cant remember. I mean, by that time, Kanata was already in development so it can't be that.   See:     he wrote a penis monster into a harem manga and had her win. Her presence makes it the first true sci-fi harem manga, really    Sasaki's stress relief.    Ahah, you beat me to it.    Alright, I wanna draw a little, so I might take a little longer to reply.  Oh thank God, I don't think we'll ever   see eye to eye   and I absolutely need to study and get off 4chan. Have fun!        It seems like the battle will continue.    Well, these kinds of discussions rarely ever end with an agreement. Most of it is speculation in the end, anyway. I just keep going because I hate losing an argument.    Or rather, because I hate looking like I lost because I stopped replying. Foolish pride, I know. Well time to draw some Hoshijiro.    Pfft.     They change between the Benisuzume eyes and the human-looking ones just like in the anime.  They don't. Benisuzume has Gauna-eyes and BeniJiro has human-like eyes. By that I mean that BeniJiro never has those odd 'dice-like' eyes that the main Benisuzume body does. This is all in the manga.    I think there is more than one conversation going on.  Yeah that would seem to be the case. The eyes in the cockpit still look pretty human to me. Nagate's look exactly the same in several panels (there's an image above), at least anatomically. The lack of expression is another thing.         Capitan in love. She was melted by Tanikaze just like the hull of Sidonia was melted by the gauna's attack.      People like you are why threads turn to shit.     director's cut?   Get a room you two!    They don't  You're telling me that these aren't those dice-like eyes?   Hey, at least I actually discuss the show.        the series will end   it will be another 10 years before he draws anything new    none of his series will ever get a decent anime adaptation       'winning arguments' is the opposite of discussions. Discussions requires the acceptance that the other party may be right and that you are wrong.    And the haremshit is also a big reason for Sidonia doing the nosedive. I picked this up because the backstory and environment actually felt fleshed out and treated the need for humanity survival as a main focus instead of going full on mechaporn. But that got tossed aside way later to put the haremshit in focus.  The sol stuff was fine because it needs to be goofy lighthearted stuff to make the darker parts of the story hit harder like Izana's first sortie.  For me to feel like this story is "redeemed" Nihei needs to have balls and kill of Tsumugi so he can force Nagate to actually enter the last stages of his uncompleted character development.        Dont scare me anon    ooh my god an argument is a discussion. I swear the one time we are not talking about shipping...     at least I actually discuss the show.  So are the Yaharifags. And the Narutards. Doesn't make them less of a cancer.     Even then, you can't "win" an argument in the academic use of the term. You can win a debate, however.     You're telling me that these aren't those dice-like eyes?  Shit man I'm talking about the scene where Benisuzume invades Nagate's cockpit and gets killed.     I know full well I'm not gonna win and that that is not the point. But as long as I haven't seen a counter-argument that I can't argue against I see no reason to stop other than that it gets a bit tiresome at some point. I have said on several occasions that we won't reach an agreement and that most of it is speculation anyway. We're just throwing points back and forth, I'd call that a discussion.  Well, I'm definitely getting tired now. Shall we just agree to disagree?       deep in your heart you know it to be true   A live action (hollywood) Blame! would be awesome.      No.    What I'm saying is that Benijiro already had control at that point. Her eye´s are "normal" and Benisuzume has lost most of its placenta, which we know means that the clone itself has some amount of control and with time recalls more and more of Hoshijiro's memories.   Fuck, I think I'll have to leave this thread, I'm really getting tired. I'm essentially just reiterating what I've already said, anyway.      As long as the main themes are still in it (megastructure, huge spanses of time, cyborgs, etc) and done in a gritty Blade Runner style wise it would be great. Sure it would shoe-horn in some romance sub plot but who cares, the storyline for Blame! was mostly non existent anyway.    Was Hoshijiro placenta ever made relevant again or are they still doing 'tests'?    No. It'd be shit. Fuck off.       She could be the magic translator Sidonia is looking for so if she is out there the series will end quickly. So she has to be on the bus til Nihei wants to end the show.     Yea I was wondering the same thing. Unless I'm remembering wrong, she should be locked up in Toha storage somewhere .     Benijiro already had control at that point  She's strangling Nagate. If the clone has control then it definitely doesn't appear to feel the same way as the original Hoshijiro.  If anything the fact that it's strangling him shows that Benisuzume is still in control and aims to kill him.       deal with it bro, it would be great    I hope this scene   will be in as well.     Good goy.     implying I wouldnt pirate it   get kek'd reptilian      top TPP    Damn, she could have been killed off without any scratches to the storyline.   This season was shit.   dont remind me anon    confirmed   Why is the Captain so pretty?   Because of many days.     Still no mention of Izana  It's been over six months at this point, I'm worried.     Suffering is only entertaining if it has some little payoff every so often. As it is, it's coming off as kind of mean spirited.   I'm up to date with the manga too, but do they ever explain how the great mass union ship went from being 3 LY away to being that fucking close? That's one of the things that has been bothering me for weeks     Izana not really wanting to be there  Kek      People actively wanting to ruin the manga just so their waifu wins    <br/>    People still misreading this scene  She still wants the N pretty badly, she just decided that what he needed was somebody to be there for him for the time being. Really, she needed to push the situation further but she's too fucking concerned about his wellbeing and nice for her own good sometimes.        But the harem was never the focus until Tsumugi turned up, and it's the reason for it going to shit.    LMUS is still located at Lem VII where they have visited once so it is not that far away.    We must go deeper.   Why is Daiz so slow translating Sidonia? I don't speak moon why is he so lazy?   But the LMUS appears in lem system when the pacifists leave sidonia and get there, right? Or was it already there and they were stupid enough to just colonise a relly fucking close to it planet? Maybe I'missing something because it doesn't make much sense to me      馬鹿     馬鹿  wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww nice dubs btw       wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww  ｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ    Is the bakabt manga a good quality?   Yeah, what is problem? the spanish is a pretty languaje and soon everyamericans speak spanish too    meh    No    Some are.     A-are you okay?       Hmm, where better?     The last ep was shit. It's like they totally ran out of money.   It's a secret.     Ok.     Check archive    It is a big archive.    For you    And painful?    Search for mega links in sidonia threads for fuck sake    What have you got against spoons?    Is it vacuum insulated? If so would buy.    That's pretty normal for a vacuum insulated thermos, though I don't think this one is.    Deeper.    The truth lies even deeper. I hope Nihei's next work has him relearning to love the ink.    Rekt   Wait for BDs and Director's Cut.    Being Izana is suffering     Fast tracked.   Sent on every combat mission as a sort of civil service/death sentence for... existing.   Turns out he's the best pilot ever, and manages to not only survive, but turn the tide in hopeless situations.   Fast tracked.   Yeah.         The suffering never ends.    It's getting a little draining at this point. She deserves a little something going her way every now and then.    Maybe if she and her fans weren't so hilariously, hypocritically dense, they'd realize she has somebody her way already.    Never forget best thread    I still don't see it. Why would Izana go lesbian so late in the game.    She's not done finalizing. There's still time for her to regress a bit and grow a futa dick.    Well, after such a spectacular launch in the headless mecha, can we safely assume that 064-man has become part of the Tanikaze harem too?   I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO TURN MOTHERFUCKING NIHEI IN THE BLAME! RERELEASE, HE FUCKING REDREW THE LEVEL 1 EXTERMINATOR NEAR THE END, AND REMOVED THE CAGE IT PUT AROUND KILLY #1. WHY #2.

I have no problems extracting the CGs that come from it, but sometimes I can't even pinpoint where the directory of the script file is located at.  Has anybody extracted Fortissimo EXS's script before?     太陽万歳!     I get it, bro. The problem I was having was with と not は  But thanks for posting. I never thought of the は particle that way (being that it is always a stand-in or used in conjunction with something else). That actually helps.   Thanks for posting, anon.   You ever play it on DS?           What does "parent" mean in this situation?   What a loser, doesn't even look for his own shit in the guide. We could not make it any easier for you faggots and you still need it handed to you on a silver platter.  In the guide:   Visual Novels and Manga OCR and how to use Rikaisama with books:  *JNovel Formatter (Alternate Download)- Breaks down a .txt into bite-size (your choice of length) chunks and converts it to html. Makes the task of reading LN's less daunting. a utility that will convert Japanese novels (in .txt) to nicely formatted HTML files. It enables you to use text hookers (Rikaisama, Rikaichan) while reading LNs/novels. A massive collection of .txt books can be found in the CoR ('400+MB assorted LN txt file format'). The collection is also available in azw3 and html.  *KanjiTomo - This is an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software. Scans for words on your screen and tells you what they are and what they mean. Success rate varies widely based on image / character quality. Suggested for manga.  Capture2Text - Another OCR program.  *Interactive Text Hooker - This allows you to extract text from Japanese games as it’s being displayed. The extracted text is put in your clipboard for an application like Translation Aggregator to make use of it. Designed for reading VNs, so it will not work for most non-VN type games and unsupported engines.  *Translation Aggregator - Usually used for machine translation, but in your case, you’ll be using JParser (preferably with Mecab hinting) to help you parse Japanese sentences and enable you to easily look up words in the same fashion as with Rikaichan and the like.  You want the ITHooker, is a program that extracts the text for you. Please do look harder next time and save yourself the embarassment, faggot. (Seriously, look in the guide and you will find it)                    You made a pretty big post just to show that you don't know what you're talking about.    Are you retarded? Most of it is just copypasted from Guide.   What's a polite way of calling out to a stranger? 君? そこの人?   すみませーん～    It's only big due to the copy paste.   If anon has a problem using ITH to extract the text, perhaps he should post about that specifically instead of "how the fuck do I do this"      Just say あの to get their attention. You don't have to address them with a noun.    He clearly wants to get the whole script extracted so that he can analyze it for frequency or something, not just to get single lines at a time with a text hooker.   What do you guys make of this deck? https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/285<wbr>901155  I'm a vocab-fag that is thinking of learning individual kanji to make things easier.  </wbr>    Yeah, too bad you completely misunderstood what I meant.  I'm not looking to extract the text of a VN as I go - I'm looking to extract the ENTIRE script at once. ITH does not do that unless you manage to go through all possible scenes in the game. The VERY REASON I want to do this in the first place is to save the trouble from constantly typing up words in a .txt file and adding them into anki at once when I can already have a pre-made wordlist that's been arranged by frequency. It saves the problem of ever needing to 'mine on the spot'.  I don't mind if you try to be a condescending faggot, but at least give some proper advice instead of assuming that everybody who asks for a help is a newfag who has problems installing VNs or getting basic text-hooking to work.        There's some resources on TLwiki that might help you but I haven't used them.    Both this and Kanji Damage is a good deck if you have trouble distinguishing kanji. I'd say you don't really have to learn the readings, just learn all the shapes. This way you can breeze through it all pretty easily. You'll learn all the reading when learning vocab either way.    forums.fuwanovel.net/topic/4887-dat<wbr>a-extraction-thread/  To add onto this, I've tried both Crass (which supposedly works for all the Circus games - I managed to exact the CGs but not the script using this program) and ExtractData but have been unsuccessful so far.  Here's a few images of Fortissimo's directory, if you're interested. Either I'm unable to pinpoint the location of the script file, or its just jumbled in. Maybe I've already tried to extract the correct file, but it doesn't get extracted.  http://imgur.com/nvemArN,dStV7Aj,qx<wbr>Hi8JT,UVW1uok,ZkFU0mu,NeHZV7o,cRzwp<wbr>bI,Do69D9c,V6Z68up,ONtRxOQ,aTJKLHk</wbr></wbr>      </wbr>     Just out of curiosity, is there a way to play VNs in web browser? Just like you can watch movies/anime and read LNs in browser for easy Rikaisama texthooking (JNovel Parser and http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.p<wbr>hp?id=13318).</wbr>   you're joking     I'm already about 2000 words into core 6k, is it really going to be beneficial picking up individual kanji learning this late?  Also, the first word in the examples of this kanji. Where does the ゆ come from in 梅雨. From what I can see on the card the only readings are う, あめ、あま and さめ. Is ゆ just a morphed う reading in this sense? (Sorry for the odd question, just trying to get to grips with how this thing works)       tuyu? No...UMEAMA!   I just bought all the N2 Shin Kanzen Master books, what am I in for?   Yes, here : http://hima.gptouch.com/games/juras<wbr>sic_heart/</wbr>    A guide to reach second rate japanese skills    1)You are still far away from 40k, so it's not to late.  The important part is whether you have trouble distinguishing kanji or not. If you don't then learning kanji with RTK/KD won't be beneficial for you.  2)Kanji have lots of readings, textbooks/decks only teach the most common readings.        Well obviously they aren't materials that target N1 or post-fluency, but I was just wondering about anyone's experience with them.    I meant something that would let you play any game in browser.     2)Kanji have lots of readings, textbooks/decks only teach the most common readings.  This doesn't really answer his question, since つゆ is just an exceptional case that has nothing to do with any of the readings for 梅 or 雨      I'm already about 2000 words into core 6k   is it really going to be beneficial picking up individual kanji learning this late  You've hardly started.        Just learn radicals.       I burned out at chapter 2   2 or 3 three weeks       Ha, yeah I know. I'm at the start of my journey, but I do find that I often don't look at the individual kanji, more remembering the shape of the jukugo as a whole. When I see 自転車 I don't recognize it as being made up of 自、転　and 車 I just see 自転車 which could easily be confused with any other 3 kanji jukugo with a similar shape. I'm hoping learning individual kanji will help this.  Do you ever get to a point where you don't know the reading of a word but you know what it means from the meanings of the kanji? Like with 自転車. Would you see it as self-quick-vehicle or something stupid like that and be able to guess from there without knowing it is じてんしゃ        I also like the comment about the terrible mental stress of worrying that you may have forgotten what you're supposed to say when you get back home.    I was in a similar situation (perhaps worse even) and learning Kanji individually completely erased that problem.  Or do that  .      I actually thought it was sarcastic but now that I'm reading it again it does sound genuine. 怖いよ。     Do you ever get to a point where you don't know the reading of a word but you know what it means from the meanings of the kanji? Like with 自転車. Would you see it as self-quick-vehicle or something stupid like that and be able to guess from there without knowing it is じてんしゃ  I suggest you don't rely on that. More often than not you won't even get close to the meaning.  As for the your other question, you can learn Kanji with a method very damn fast if you know what you're doing, I don't know about KD but RTK gives you meanings, radicals and stroke order in one fell swoop and you can do the first book in about 40 days with a pace of 50 as long as you're using Koohii for mnemonics.        I know the radicals, but it still doesn't help when encountering kanji like 二階 because I have no fucking clue what 階 means, even with radicals.      Do you ever get to a point where you don't know the reading of a word but you know what it means from the meanings of the kanji?  Having gone through Kanjidamage, it's more like... Self-car running over a beheaded cow-car... ah! I myself drive my BIKE over dead cows feeling like a car! got it! next word please!     And this is why you use RTK.     you can never have too firm of a foundation  Oh, thank goodness. I thought the last 10 years spent exclusively on learning the subtle nuance of は might have been a bit of a waste.      苛めないでください これでも努力はしてるんだから      Whatever works for you, but for me the stupid stories make it way easier to remember stuff.    No, thank you.    So you can work out a jukugo from two kanji you already "know", but you can't work out a kanji from 2 radicals you already "know"? Sorry bro, you're retarded.    That particular statement is spot on though. You could've picked anything else of that to act like a smartass.    A foundation taken from textbooks is completely worthless for a language.  The best way to learn is to use the textbook as reference for real material that will make the concepts stick faster. Then you're done with the "foundation" in a week.      My thoughs exactly.    implying rtk doesn't rely on stupid stories  The radical meanings don't differ much from the real thing. And RevTK stories are way better mnemonics than KD ones.        Those silly stories in Kanjidamage, or the ones you make up yourself are really useful at first. I would try to unlearn them after a while and concentrate on readings and Jukugo tho.    Do RTK or KD then, anon. I'm serious, if it's really bothering you then do one of them. You won't regret it. And ignore this .     It's not really a case of "unlearning" anything. They naturally fade as you become able to recall the kanji's meaning and readings without them.  Mnemonics are like support structures to make neurons grow faster. Once you've got the connection, they naturally die off.      I agree that you shouldn't rely on textbooks but reading real material with only a flimsy understanding is not okay either. You should do both to have a good foundation and way to practice it. The so called "eternal beginner syndrome" applies when you don't read or listen to native material but formal study will never stop being beneficial.   reminder that you'll always be a doorknob scratcher    they naturally die off  just like neets     T-thanks...     I never claimed to be able to make out a jukugo from two kanji. I only did vocab. 10 for effort.      doesn't want to scratch those knobs     I think formal study can very easily fall into a loop of very slow "I'll get there eventually" progression, where it takes you a month to read a fucking chapter and you've already forgotten the start before you're at the end. So you restart, only to never really learn anything. What matters most in my eyes is challenging new material, instead of spending a year on a foundation that never really gets out of the starting gate.    おやって見て親と間違ってはただのバカしちゃったってじゃないよ！  あんたは自分で分かるんだろう、そのほのかな頭脳でどう日本語を習うつもり<wbr>か？出来ないだろう お前にもだれにも出来ないことがあっても越そうとしなければならないのだ！<wbr>もっとゲームをステップアップしないとなんともならない！  さあーぐずぐずするなって！ゴミの上へ上げれ！立て！レップして読め！何の<wbr>他のことでもしてはいけないのだ！日本語で食べて日本語で吐いて日本語で生<wbr>きて行けよ！  お前こそ出来るから諦めるな！ぜひ諦めるな！  </wbr></wbr>  </wbr> </wbr>      There's formal study material for all levels and there's no rule that says that you can't do a chapter a day. Go as fast as you like.   instead of spending a year on a foundation that never really gets out of the starting gate  I'm not suggesting that.        日本語でオナニして！     ゴメン、お前の投稿を見て諦めた    いじめてすまん    Formal study is fine but there are plenty of people who have jumped into reading super early and been successful.     What a dumb fucking language Why did it have to be the japs to start producing cartoon porn? Any country with a western language would've been better. Fucking dying chink shit, they have to steal every new word from english because they can't make up new ones. Even if you're doing business with them you don't need to learn the language because most of the time it will be them speaking your language. And anyone who doesn't isn't worth doing business with Even they recognize the superiority of the white man's alphabet      So, I am trying to read some shitty porn, and an early line is throwing me off.

But later, when the narrator is talking about the wife, there is the line:   学生時代は「街を歩くかわいい娘」や「美人コンパニオン特集」などの雑誌<wbr>グラビアなんかにも何度も載っている程なのである。</wbr>   As far as "学生時代は" is concerned, I can't tell if the narrator is talking about how the wife could be described in her school days, or if its something else entirely.           </wbr>     You could always learn Korean.    That's just as bad as japanese but without the 2 advantages of learning it    qt korean girls    That's how I also understand it, I can't see it in any other way.  The repetition of 学生時代 is kinda throwing me off but since you said "later" I suppose these two sentences weren't next to each other. That's what made you doubt too, right?      They might as well be androids what with their manufactured personalities and plasticine bodies. Maybe you're into that though.    Those lines are first person dude.

Or are all LNs hard as fuck?   I can inform you that kanji as a whole are obsolete, but you'd seethe with rage.    Most of them are fairly easy and aren't exactly high literature. Any sort of prose is going to be difficult at first.    Post your grid so we can see who you are.    Thanks for nothing, retard.    Come on down from mount stupid.    My nigga, I hope japnese and korean and actually similar    He isn't the one that asked the question. Probably he's just here to shit up these threads.    people more concerned with what is "easy" and what is "hard" than what they actually want to read   Holy fuck you guys are retarded.     Japanese learners (maybe learners in general, I don't know) tend to place a lot of effort on levels and progression. I guess this is just a motivating tool.    Experienced language learners all say interesting content is more important than easy content.    Yeah, no argument from me. Being motivated and engaged is the most important thing by far.   help me with my piss poor jap skills, trying to ask &gt;why does miku need that much money 何でミクさんにあんなたくさんのお金が必要 would that be correct y/n     Yes, though it sounds a little odd in my opinion without any kind of ending particle like かな or at least a question mark.    同人音声    I need to know kanji to read the plethora of masterpieces that lie awaiting me in the world of VNs and LNs, therefore it's not obsolete. Sorry for proving you wrong.    Post your grid.    Any VN needing more than 2500 kanji is overrated shit   I wonder how far I'd get by completely dropping my reps and just bruteforcing through with texthook and VNs.    Not like I'm asking because that's what I've been doing for the past 1-2 months.      I fail to see how my grid is relevant to the point I'm making. If you can explain to me I will gladly post it.  Even if that were true, so what? How does that imply kanji as a whole are obsolete? That would just suggest (not even prove) that there are a bunch of kanji which are obsolete, which I don't think anybody would ever disagree with anyway.      I was also interested in the answer to the question and got angered with his useless reply.    Play any ten VNs, even the easiest ones and you'll find that they sum up more than 3000 unique Kanji.    Not as far as you would with a well balanced rep program.    Having fun shitposting, son?    The easiest LN is the one that you enjoy. Differences between different works are greatly exaggerated and unless you're looking at something that's deliberately obtuse (using old language or something) it's not going to make the difference in whether you can progress or not.    But reps are boring, anon.    How deep in your ass did that one come from?     his useless reply.  You mean  Most of them are fairly easy and aren't exactly high literature. Any sort of prose is going to be difficult at first. this is useless? Because it's the sole truth. You're supposed to take it as meaning that if you're having trouble with one you'll have trouble with any other one so you might as well just pick one that interests you instead of searching for some elusive 'easy' LN which doesn't really exist.   Nobody said they were fun. If you can't take it, well, that's just the measure of how capable you are.          見透かされましたか    I wouldn't say skipping reps over reading is a matter of capability seeing as how reps don't teach you even a fraction of what reading does. THere are probably more people who do just either instead both on a daily basis.    are you supposed to guess instead or what     THere are probably more people who do just either instead both  That would be a sad state of affairs. I believe a balanced combination of both is the optimal state. If that were the case though and people in general just can't do both at the same time, I'd recommend reading over reps 1000 times of course.  It sounds pretty unbelievable to me. I imagine people usually start with just reps and then gradually, in a very slow process, increase the time allocated to reading (and listening/watching) from 0% to 100% as they become better and better.         You can get very far.    俺は勉教しない主義だから心配無用    It's possible. It sort of depends on your level though. Remember Komeiji? The Azusa waifuposter from a few years ago? He's reading Muramasa now and he didn't use Anki at all. If you're a beginner you need some serious autism to pull through in the beginning if you want to progress fast.    I only know from my own experience. I used to grind reps and do just that. Was probably down 2200 kanji before even opening my first VN. Still, don't really regret since grinding reps was fun at that point for some reason.   Daily reminder if you can't read Muramasa you are dumber than Komeiji.  Is writing random sentences using grammar points from DOJG and getting them checked (lang8) a good way to improve my production?  Reminder that Muramasa is overrated chuunishit. It has a generic high school protagonist and some bitch with chink eyes as a heroine. There's also no cute brown girls or blonde lolis. Just go play muv luv instead.   Did you read it yourself and come to that conclusion? If so I will do as you say.    There's that brown slut who yakiniku really likes. So there's that. But then again I don't even know what the fuck we're talking about.    Just read the first half of the first chapter and you'll come to the same conclusion. Just look at this shitty cliche antagonist.    Yes but try to write longer coherent texts, not just random sentences    Even if something you write is correct, it might not always sound natural. Lang8 is only as good as the people who happen to be checking your work.    It's better than doing nothing. Also, I think you should be pretty solid when it comes to reading before even starting up on production. That way you can eliminate retarded word choices because you'll know what sounds off.    Don't worry about production until you can read decently. Unless you have some reason to focus on production extra hard like if you are going to japan soon or something.   Also, I think trying to write thinking "how can I use this grammar structure" is totally the wrong way to go about it. You want to be able to take what you want to say, and say it in the most natural way possible.  Also the best way to practice production would be to actually make japanese friends.        I'd say it's a good practice, but not sufficient. You won't get a feel for what sounds natural and what sounds off until you've read tons of Japanese.     I'm already an advanced reader. And I've used HelloTalk for a few months already. But chatting in casual Japanese is kind of different from doing long blog posts with formal Japanese and more complex grammar. My active vocabulary is pretty shit too.       Try translating something that's actually hard    reminder that this is actually never used in real life      A wing B exit vinegar   "A" is the nest from "B"   tfw you took a break when you only had 50 reviews left but forgot to finish them and went to sleep instead.    Stop frogposting and stop being lazy. It's only 50 reviews. That shit shouldn't take more than 5-10 minutes tops.    I've already finished them. It just hurts my autism to see that I did that.    I had this happen to me just last night.

I either missed it or it wasn't in the guide, but what are good (mechanical) jap keyboards? It's hard to find information about this. My go-to manufacturers only do european/US setups   Model M     jap keyboards  Why?     Every time I see it I chuckle. I'm so glad that whole thing happened.  I'm waiting for someone to make pics of it.

Hello there, newfriend.     variety show is a meme here  You're not even rubbing orange juice on the doorknob, anon.      faster switching between english and jap keys with the extra keys  An extra key somehow makes it faster than alt+shift?      You're not making it easy for me. Last time I regularily browsed 4chan was years ago. Can't be expected to be in the loop with every new meme.     ヘラジカ野郎  What would this clever insult translate to?

Damn I'm clever.     Thanks to starting the the DJT have finally understood the DAY ONE meme in Yahari threads. だよねis actually a word, my mind was blown earlier today.   How is that even possible? All you literally have to do to fit in these days is post "x is best girl" or reply to somebody with something smart such as &gt;this guy add epic meme images to increase effect      this guy   Bulma is best girl.      You see? Later on you might even try shipping or talk about VAs, but that's when you're really tryharding.     I tend to ship the pre-destined ships.

If you used RTK you would be well aware that you are supposed to make your own stories. A lot of people who claim to have used RTK never seem to have read the introduction to the first book.   So I Anki a lot but I know that alone isn't enough. But is it really worth struggling reading through material with an OCR program that works 3/4 of the time and only makes things marginally clearer than they would be otherwise? It just seems terribly inefficient but I can't think of anything else to do.   Why not learn how to read on actual copy pastable text first? Why look for japanese text on images to learn how to read?    I agree that most don't read the introduction but making your own stories is extremely time-consuming and Koohii stories are going to be much better mnemonics than whatever you can come up with. The heavy lifting is already done for you, why not use it?   can someone help? pic related is two lines of monologue.  I don't understand which verb is taking 人 as an object. the object of やめて is usually an activity or job, not the agent performing it, right?  and then something about if slime isn't coming out ... 俺 at the end of the sentence ... i'm just lost.        Have you ever used RTK? After a certain point there are no stories. The heavy lifting is on you regardless.    So I read a bit of a manga today and I actually understood it! I mean, I've already gone over it six times and used anki to learn every word that I knew would be in it, but its a small victory!   Yes. I did the first book and I didn't bother making my own stories (outside of a few) because I don't think it's worth it. Stories for all 3007 Kanji are already made and I took advantage of that.     No. You're not even scratching the doorknob.    Beginner question  What is the difference between 終わりにする and 終わる?      buying the book  Sorry you made a shit decision and now feel that you need to justify it.      predestined ships   KyonxYuki  oh nigga no you didn't      終わりにする Try (make an effort) to end it with the implication that it still might not end  終わる To end (naturally with no volition on your part)  終える To end (on your own volition)  Also, nice satanic trips.             RTK doesn't even teach you compound Kanji, like when you have 2/3/4 Kanji making up 1 word. More like that book isn't even scratching the door knob.     終わりにする   Literal TL is towards ending something does   終わる?  to end  Give me your best shot djt         What does "scratching the door knob" meme mean?   What's the context anyway? It's a very strange sentence...   人をエイ扱いするのをやめてね、粘液出てないからね俺。 Stop treating people like rays (fish) will you, it's not as if I'm producing slime.  Think of 人をエイ扱いするのをやめてね　as a line he's saying to himself.   The word order here is typical of speech; slightly random as the person talks before he thinks. People do this all the time  Especially the 俺 at the end, it's added as an afterthought to clarify that it's he himself who is not excreting slime and not the 人.  The verb taking 人 as an object would be 扱いするin this case, やめてね is for the character himself.  To fix the word order a bit: 「人をエイ扱いするのをやめてね」,　俺から粘液が出てないから。                 I'm not sure what makes you say it's a very strange sentence. It's probably just a colorful way of saying "stop treating people like lower-order lifeforms". Of course, there could be something explicitly mentioned about rays, but that's unlikely.  I'm also not sure why you think he's saying to himself that he needs to stop. That doesn't jive with "I don't secrete slime". He's talking about someone else who needs to stop treating people like rays. Someone's talking down to him and he's not happy with it.      Wow that helped out a lot. I think I got down the whole にする thing. Thanks.    It's not a meme, it's an English expression.    Well, that's a whole 'nother doorknob.    If you aren't learning how to perfectly write speak and read with everything else in between in Japanese an anon or a group of anons will come out and tell you that you're even touching the surface of the language and you shouldn't be satisfied.  Just ignore.      There isn't any other way to read Volume 2 and 3 without buying the book.   How do the japs say Hitler? Hi tu re ru? Too lazy to switch ime    https://www.google.com/search?q=%22<wbr>scratching+the+door+knob%22</wbr>    I've never seen ray or stingray used as an insult that way, which is why I thought it's probably literal. If he's really not on a field trip to the sea or aquarium or something it's probably just an insult like you're saying though.  But no he is clearly talking to himself. Anything else is out of the question.      Wait I just had to go to his wikipedia page  https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%8<wbr>2%A2%E3%83%89%E3%83%AB%E3%83%95%E3%<wbr>83%BB%E3%83%92%E3%83%88%E3%83%A9%E3<wbr>%83%BC  wait shit why does it copypaste like this  </wbr></wbr></wbr>       I've never seen ray or stingray used as an insult that way  The great thing about language is you can make up colorful metaphors on the fly and people understand an appreciate them.   But no he is clearly talking to himself. Anything else is out of the question.  I have no idea why you think this, it's both possible and extremely likely. Why would he tell himself to stop treating people like rays and then say that he himself isn't secreting slime? If your issue is that it's an internal monologue, then realize that people (in both English and Japanese) can "talk" to people without putting their thoughts into words.        Oh wait, it could be someone treating him as a fish. I see it now. sorry     get proven wrong   better insult him for buying the book   A purchase from my dumber days. At least I have money you worthless fucking NEET.   I did. Fight me IRL   It's such a shitty book. It's not even rubbing the orange juice on it.   Lurk more.   Trudat.                   Yah its just the same にする that you would attach to nouns or na-adjectives to mean "to make or to have something be a certain way."    Websites are all coded that way on DNS servers. Your browser does the conversion when displaying it. For whatever reason when copy pasting out of many browsers displays the code rather than the converted Japanese.     It's such a shitty book. It's not even rubbing the orange juice on it.  I wouldn't say the book is shit, there have been countless success stories with the series. I doubt it's possible to go into the book and come out worse.      After a certain point there are no stories.  Not that guy but when I was doing it like 5 years ago there was a file with stories for all of them made up. Whatever torrent or resource file I downloaded had an rtf file with all 2042 stories for the first book.     Yeah I don't know what that is, but if you look at what I linked you'll see it's exactly at the point you linked. 1476, for example, is a different kanji.  Whatever you have is different from the book I have. Maybe he added them later or maybe someone else did (it certainly looks different from the book).   Either way, it's not as good as the earlier stories in the book. They're far more in-depth and meaningful than just METAL IS ADDED TO SILVER TO CREATE THE FULL KANJI FOR SILVER.       Why is it that in all H-doujins, the male uses 俺?  Like, is it just a cliche, or are they all trying to sound arrogant?  I am probably missing a subtlety here.        1476, for example, is a different kanji.  I mean, the order is a little different because there have been multiple revisions. All of the first book is there, minus maybe a few changes that were made 5 years ago or so.   Either way, it's not as good as the earlier stories in the book. They're far more in-depth and meaningful than just METAL IS ADDED TO SILVER TO CREATE THE FULL KANJI FOR SILVER.  I think they are indeed user created, but it's not as though all of heisig's are gold. He's got plenty of dumb ones. The point is that if someone just wanted to get stories and not think about it, the option is there.    俺 is extremely common among males in a casual context.           Maybe, but if you're not able to make up your own stories you're not even scratching the doorknob of possibility.    alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/data<wbr>/Heisig_complete_v3.rtf   Huh, I don't remember but I might have actually gotten this from AJATT. Might be his stories. His site is the only one that really comes up when I search the filename, anyway.  </wbr>     Why not learn how to read on actual copy pastable text first?   Not really sure where to start as far as that goes.      http://life.ou.edu/stories/ Here you go, first start by being able to read hiragana nicely. Once you can do that, start moving on furigana stuff like Yotsuba while learning kanji so you can then read kanji without furigana. http://livingjapanese.com/pages/rea<wbr>ding_packs.html</wbr>      Don't ever use that site and yotsubatos tough to read to read for new people in my opinion.    I'm starting to see why Reddit is such a popular website. It makes me laugh every time I go there.     this meme   not even rubbing orange juice on the reality      I don't know of any centralized resource for it (OP seems to be all manga) but you can find txt format LNs on nyaa for many things. A lot of stuff is image only, though, which is annoying especially if you want to read it on a mobile device.    is this another reddit meme?    It's literally a pure /djt/ meme.    lets pretend this never happened?   Will people on hellotalk find me boring? Also, how fast are the conversations, can I take hours to respond?     Will people on hellotalk find me boring?   Yes.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127232922  At least we don't have people like afroman here.      That's just sad.    After reading several of his threads, I have come to the conclusion that he is actually mentally retarded.    It's like he's not even trying to lift his arms. How are you supposed to scratch the doorknob without even that much effort?      yotsuba    tough  You're funny anon, if you can read hiragana you can read yotsuba      Some people say that Yotsubato is tough because she speaks in a weird way and with very little kanji. But I agree with you that it's much easier than it is hard.     I just dont like manga enough to care probably. I am about a year in and the only issue is vocab and I hate looking it up.      he doesn't have a good vocab base from watching anime  You can't learn Japanese      she     I don't watch either. That doesnt even make sense.     It?      Let's ignore the fact that you need to understand grammar!   Oh watching anime will give you all the vocab you need!   Can we let this meme die?       Alright guys its Friday night and time for that there listening practice.  Lets get into some shenanigans on niconico.  Anybody got any live people requests?       But you need grammar and vocab for everything. But with Yotsuba you need the least. How is this hard to understand?   Nub that's hit a wall with the kanji, here. Pic related's how I managed to learn all the kana including the alts like "go, ji, za, etc." and the compounds like like "kyu, ryo, bya, etc."  What's the best way for me to "brute force" the Kanji? I learn best by drilling the image in my head and forcefully associating that image with a sound.       Can we let this meme die?  But it's not a meme, I read yotsuba after learning kana. I've also never read any grammar guides either      Does anyone know a good resource like a video or some audio that explains pitch accent?   what you're asking for is basically what 90% of the people in the thread use.

If he's really not on a field trip to the sea or aquarium or something it's probably just an insult like you're saying though.  You were actually pretty close to guessing the context.  The character is in fact on a field trip to an aquarium. A girl got slime on herself from petting a ray. Another girl (who, as a joke, often makes fun of the main character) accused him of sliming on her. My pic showed his thoughts in response.           tfw I understood a line from a hentai,  the fruits of my labor everyone      そめさりやた if you really need help.   thank you, but the captcha already expired  i have to git gud....i've been trying for an hour...  http://www.lexilogos.com/keyboard/h<wbr>iragana.htm</wbr>          Read light novels and visual novels then. And just have the JED dictionary on your phone, looking up things is never a hassle.    If you spent an hour learning hiragana you would have already solved it    How many years have you been studying?    You should learn how to atleast read hiragana before trying to navigate a japanese site. Its the most basic thing in the language.     tfw speak enough japanese to understand most of a hentai     trying to solve it and find the right hiragana is actually having me learn it    maybe you can't solve it because you are a robot     You should learn how to atleast read hiragana before trying to navigate a japanese site. Its the most basic thing in the language.   えと。。。  わかります。  わたしのがんばれ ありがと  i typed that myself             nigger you can type japanese but you can't read it?     basically     Anyone who can write in romaji can write Japanese using the IME. They don't have to be able to read it, just have to make sure they transcribed it properly.    If you know the romaji, typing is pretty simple.  so i dont really get why people say "don't learn romaji".        They're not saying "don't learn romaji" they're saying "don't think you can learn Japanese in romaji", jeesh    Because it's useless. You'll have to learn without it by some point. It's like learning all the words without kanji. You'll eventually have to relearn them all with kanji, which just makes learning longer.     I dont get why people say dont learn the romaji     yeah but you'll have to learn the romaji too if you actually want to put the fucking character into a computer    You should have replied with the standard meme response:  http://www.aozora.gr.jp/cards/00030<wbr>4/files/1878_24292.html http://vocaroo.com/ </wbr>      You don't "learn romaji"  Learning japanese with romaji is not an alternative, it is an _omission_. You are cutting something out, and people telling you not to learn japanese with romaji are really telling you to not cur corners.      Updated.    Or just with the kana/kanji normally. There's no reason to bring romaji into this.     you have to learn romaji to be able to put in Japanese words   You're kidding right? How long have you been studying honestly?       ヲタクライフ！     useless     being this hardcore of a weeb  romaji makes appearances occasionally in native material, on signs, etc.   you also need it to input text into a computer if you're using a standard keyboard.  so, not only should you be familiar with romaji, you should be familiar with several romaji systems. (protip: hepburn's not the only one)             Are you guys saying you use the kana input keyboard?      You're kidding right?  Show us a picture of your keyboard.    Wake up 6 am. Start reps at 6:30 am.   I miss when I weren't trying to learn Japanese.      Hes implying that you need to study romaji...     When people say don't learn romaji, they mean don't study in it.

I am not saying you don't learn it naturally but don't study it. I am exiting out of this thread. Way too retarded tonight.       YOU NEED TO USE ROMAJI BUT YOU DONT NEED TO LEARN IT   this is literally what you are saying right now     Can't we all just get along?   You learn the romaji used to write the kana when learning kana. So you do study romaji but it's just to learn the kana and is easy    Everyone on /a/ knows romaji. When people say don't learn it, they mean don't study Japanese in it.    I was just taking issue with the assertion that romaji is "useless."    I've been at it for 2 weeks and the line was all in hiragana, so no fancy stuff for me.   Anon, I swear I will meet you there at the top.       Apparently not.   captcha fag here  i swear to god i thought i had it, but i guess i took too long and now im back to square one  can i commit sudoku now       So you're nitpicking a small fact and not learning Japanese right now procrastinating.   but but im on break   Also take this /v/ scumlord with you.<br/>        It's useless in the sense that you'll read hundreds of books, manga, games, etc and see at most a few lines of it for the names of companies.    There's nothing to learn, are you in special Ed. or something?  Why don't you tell me exactly what your romaji studies consisted of? Did you have to write "ta" 50 times on paper to learn it?  I mean, the rows are literally even english vowels. Sure everyone has to technically "learn romaji" but if it takes you longer than literally 15 seconds you're probably riding the short bus.          And too add to my point. Not all uses of the Latin alphabet are going to be romaji, Ufotable for example is pronounced ユーフォーテーブル, not ウフォタブレ.

This counts since it's when he found out.   mah nigga.     Because "suki" is too ambiguous.    You know...if you think about it, the three main girls wanted to fuck each other too. Her name is Subaru...so logically if the three girls bean rub...wouldn't that be Mitsubishi?     So did they get married?    Best girl won   tsundere is truly the purest form of love there is  Are there any decent manga with straightforward confessions that end up with each other? The only one I can think of is unbalance x unbalance but it felt like it ended 1 chapter too early.   I'm still so fucking mad.  It took so long to update just for that fucking ending.        well goat man obviously has a huge goat dick  and years of sexual experience      Mao is love Mao is life     i liked the anime   Confessing to your waifu   They don't hold hands for 5 months   Epitome of purity     probably one of the saddest love confessions of this manga       Less tears then expected from this one.    aw shit , now i need to know what happens    Forced romance. Honestly, PM should just be a comedy series instead of drama romance.       Read these then http://g.e-hentai.org/g/572739/389b<wbr>764c53/ http://pururin.com/gallery/12197/se<wbr>nsei-wo-mite-kudasai.html</wbr> </wbr>       So, a grown man like you don't confess their love. Wow.    /a/ liked Karin until Yutaka was retarded and rejected the confession, and then the manga dragged on while annoying the readers until it got cancelled.  The confession was fantastic, though.        you will never leave your order of monastic knights to protect your witchfu  why live?        I hope you enjoy it as much as I did      Is that you, Meta? Seriously, stop being fucking retarded in a thread not even meant for you.    this is a level of comfy i have never experienced before    I'm rooting more for their two friends finally realizing their feelings and becoming a couple.    A short manga, but pretty sweet    God, all this time and this one still fucking tears me up inside. It always has and it always will.     oneshot  Fuck you     You don't know for sure if she disappeared. You don't know for sure if i the final scene is some alternate reality and he's actually with her and they are happy.     ubango     She's gone, anon. MC married his crush, and poor used goods disappeared.    You don't know that I won't invent a machine to enter the 2D realm and use it to save her.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VUq<wbr>BM-Y4r9Q</wbr>  [ ]    I cried manly tears   This is basically a confession right?     SHE DID IT, SHE FUCKIN SCORED     How did it end? I dropped it.  Did they end up together?        Yes, more or less.     She's gona anon, she cut him off from confessing to her the page prior because she loved him so much that she didn't want him to throw away his life trying to save her. She didn't want him to break himself trying to be a hero so she gave him the happy ending she believed he deserved.    2nd chapter was wayyy behind the 1st. Still above average compared to other manga tho.    I think it could have worked out. I think he could have fixed her. I think they'd have two kids by now. I don't think this is the end.      some of the romance manga are oneshots anon    Hate to be that nigga, but I might die without sauce     &gt;love   it doesn't exist.  It exists in 2D. Not IRL.      Improve your Google-fu skills anon.    You have her name. Use your head and Google.    After story of his harem life when    This shit is fucking crazy, I have no idea where it's going.    I think I'd rather ruin my life trying to save her than let her set me up with my future wife. I'd feel like the world's biggest cunt after that.    I loved how much they hugged each other in the anime and manga.      She was love, the manga was pretty good; could have been a lot better, but Natsu was love.   [x] Hug used goods         Maybe the guy will get a second chance at life if he dies       Didn't notice the name. My bad.                  ed. note: wow pathetic...      ed note  W-well fuck you too editor       It doesn't exist even in 2D, anon.    The next chapter has a great confession as well from Seiji.    Nagisa a shit, [Spoiler]SHIIIIIIIIIIIT!!!    No, I read about it all the time.          now that's love         Wait what why   Who wins?       shit was gr8.    The show is called Midori no Hibi, of course Midori would win.    spoiled for lewd    14 months later the tears are still delicious    But Ayase tho..     Just for you anon I'll do the rest        You should post the most iconic page of that shit manga faggot.       I don't like seeing people suffer but I wanna read or at least watch this series     Thread's about confessions, not "people getting btfo"     Watch the anime it's decent, though a bit dated.   Ruri soon.  Sora when?  Yuya vs Yugo when?   not for like another 12 episodes at least    Who?    Yugo will duel Yuya because he sees him dueling the KINGU and gets jealous        In that case,I hope Yuzu hits him with the fan one day. It's like they forgot that gag.    Sora will probably appear in Synchro Dimension once Leo decides to send Yuri and Sora there with the Obelisk Force.  If Sora stays at Academia for whatever reason (I doubt it Leo needs all the help he can get to capture Yuzu and Serena), he could be used to properly introduce Ruri and Rin into the story if he meets both of the Ruris while they are imprisoned. Though I think Yuri and Sora's roles will be reversed compared to last time.  Meaning Yuri's mission will be to capture Serena (and succeed because Yuri is that good) while Sora's mission will be to capture Yuzu (and fail to do do. Meaning Yuzu wins the duel and escapes, Sora wins the duel but Yuzu escapes him regardless, or the duel is interrupted by someone like Yugo which allows Yuzu to escape and/or Sora gets BTFO).  Either way, it will end with Serena being captured and Yuzu will be reunited with Yuya.         why is yu ya  so perfect  How many people and who are they going to recruit people from the Synchro Dimension?   shinji is the most likely one   some characters from friendship cup maybe  the fact that they're doing high speed riders and making speed roids an actual thing makes me think yugo might not get absorbed       post the arc-v mega link  what would be the best final boss of arc-v? I'd say the 4 previous protagonists vs the 4 Yu's    https://mega.co.nz/#F!pN8SRTRQ!5JGF<wbr>8ifwaqTJN-XSjOERLg</wbr>     thanks    evolved yuri    The previous protagonists shouldn't appear at all, and especially not in that way.     not wanting to see supreme king jaden as the true leader of academia     I am Ruri.    You're right, I don't. They had their series already, go back and watch those if you really must see them again and let Yuya have his show himself.     a previous character appearing even if it's in the final few episodes automatically means the main character will have the show stolen from him regardless of the countless duels and development they've had     The previous protagonists had their fucking show, leave them there. And yes, if they show up in the final few episodes, the show will start fellating them at the expense of the show, and I know you faggots will accept it because MUH YUGI/JUDAI/YUSEI SO EPIC.      They're all better than Yuya and Yuya clones.    Then go watch those shows if you think they're so much better.    No.   Did Sound Duel 3 have this song?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=knG<wbr>bdJAfuJ0</wbr>  [ ]     no       You're being a real asshole m8. Arc-V is a series made for the 20th anniversary of Yu-Gi-Oh. The reason why Pendulum Summoning, Academia, City, Heartland, different dimensions, the fact that everyone in Standard can use different Summoning Methods, and shit like Professors, Security, Jack, Crow, etc. are all present is because of this anniversary.   You're saying you want Arc-V to be its own series and run on its own plot points but fail to realize some of those plot points are from other series. The main villainous groups right now are a Duel Academy and Sector Security, both from GX and 5D's. Shun and Yuto, the two characters that people say marked off the start of Arc-V getting really interesting are from Heartland from ZEXAL. The first opponent Yuya faced officially was a guy using Battleguards, from DM owned by Joey and Tristan.   Arc-V has been fellating off of previous series since the very first fucking episode and it's supposed to because it is celebrating those previous series.   Also   the show will start fellating them at the expense of the show   People said the same thing about Crow but Crow has did literally nothing so far                None of that means the protagonists will or should show up at all. They had their show, leave them there. Also, nothing has been explicitly said that Arc-V is an anniversary show, and in fact all the new DM related stuff HAS been stated to be related to the anniversary. You just sound upset that someone doesn't want to see muh Yugi/Yusei/Judai showing up in Arc-V.   Everyone shut the hell up and post Serena    None of that means the protagonists will or should show up at all.  I didn't say it did, where did you get that from?  The fact that Arc-V is celebrating all the past series and started airing near the anniversary time really suggests that the series was made as an anniversary saga, and how the show is being treated, its blatantly obvious.    You just sound upset that someone doesn't want to see muh Yugi/Yusei/Judai showing up in Arc-V.   All that strawposting is ridiculous. I don't even care if they return  maybe Judai  as I could care less. What I'm saying that you seem to not be understanding as all these callbacks and references and characters appearing from past series conveys a high chance that the previous protagonists will appear. It's not impossible and the fact that Jack and Crow are back should have put the possibility in your dense head.           It seems like fanartists like to depict Serena as a hungry Ruri lately.    No, it doesn't give a "high chance" for the previous protagonists to appear, but it does give a reasonable chance for other, non protagonist characters to appear. And the only explicit thing they've done is bring Crow and Jack back, and even then they're clearly different characters than their 5D's versions, everything else has been references and callbacks, nothing more.  And the entire argument before hasn't been "could they?", it's "SHOULD they?". And they shouldn't. You're the one that turned this into a "well the possibility is there," I fucking know the possibility is there, that doesn't mean I have to be for it happening.      Also, Yusei's VA already confirmed he wasn't called to come back.   Ruris are the fucking best.  Kill those who disrespect Ruri      4 on 4 duel  Fuck no, the 3 v 1s are messy enough as is     Omni-Yuya vs Omni-Yuzu Yubel-fied Yuya+Yuzu vs Super Mega Darkness God  Probably something along those lines.      why does everyone in this anime have secondary hair    secondary hair      No, it doesn't give a "high chance" for the previous protagonists to appear, but it does give a reasonable chance for other, non protagonist characters to appear.  Yes it does. Crow and Jack alone ARE protagonists from 5D's so previous protagonists CAN appear.    even then they're clearly different characters than their 5D's versions   But then who's to say the previous protagonists won't be different characters from their original versions? You're trying to make it seem like if they'll appear they'll be in full glory which they won't. Like I said before, people said Crow would ruin the series as soon as he touched an Arc-V episode because he overshadowed so many characters when he was introduced in 5D's originally being a side character, yet he's done nothing of the kind in Arc-V. He hasn't done anything and has overshadowed no one.    And the entire argument before hasn't been "could they?", it's "SHOULD they?". And they shouldn't.   Yeah and all you've said for why they shouldn't is because YOU think they will immediately ruin the show by the show pandering to them. All you are trying to say is that you don't want them to appear. You even said it with this  that doesn't mean I have to be for it happening.   You haven't said any reasonable reason why they shouldn't appear besides the show might pander to them. Even if they appear in the final few episodes you still think they would somehow ruin the show by the show catering to them. Just like you said to me, you don't want them to appear because "the possibility is there" that they will ruin the show.                Not everyone.    the black characters are the bodyguards    hair of a different color/style on top of the one they have    Selena's hungry duel when     Yes it does. Crow and Jack alone ARE protagonists from 5D's so previous protagonists CAN appear.  You dont know what that word means, protagonist literally means chief actor in Greek, you cant have more than one.   But then who's to say the previous protagonists won't be different characters from their original versions?  They'd have to minimalised so much to not take the spotlight that it'd be pointless. No way wouldnt we have seen Yusei have an effect on the universe if he wasnt anywhere near the person he was in 5Ds.   You haven't said any reasonable reason why they shouldn't appear besides the show might pander to them  Yuseis VA straight up said he wasnt coming back They would have announced it to hype up the series if they were Paying previous MCs to come back would be expensive as fuck for Arc V (I'm amazed they managed to get Kenn back for the movie)              Crow and Jack alone ARE protagonists from 5D's so previous protagonists CAN appear.  They're not THE protagonists. Jack and Crow means other, non-protagonists can appear, but not THE protagonists.  And no, I said they shouldn't appear because they ALREADY HAD their show, and I'd rather they stay the fuck there. And yes, they would ruin the show by appearing in the final few episodes, because those final few episodes would suddenly be focusing on them instead of the already established Arc-V characters. What, do you seriously think they'd just have Yugi/Judai/Yusei/Yuma in a SMALL role if they reappeared?      Is the upcoming DM movie not enough for nostalgiafags? Arc-V's already crowded in terms of characters, no need to bring in more  Do you want to take a photo of yourself desu~?  Today's manzai is just Sawatari and Yuya.  Sawatari's pretty excited about the Entertainment Duel Tournament and says he can't sleep because of it. Yuya is excited too, but he wants to sleep. Sawatari keeps bothering him of course.   tfw no Serena to stop Sawatari being a bother.        NO. It won't be enough unless they announce a GX movie right after, Yugi uses powerful retrained versions of Curse of Dragon, The two silent monsters, some new monsters that make Dark magician and girl not shit, and some maybe a boss ritual monster that's actually playable.     It won't be enough unless they announce a GX movie right after   Kenn   Ever agreeing to do an entire GX movie    More DM nostalgia support  Holy fuck, sets are already flooded with Red Eyes and BLS stuff         That's hilarious considering the magazine previews didn't even hide that Sawatari gets wrecked right away.   The movie will likely be Yugi vs Kaiba sitting on their aces and whatever new forms they get the entire duel with maybe a cameo of Dark Magician Girl destroying something before dying and fucking off for the rest of the film. I really hope they don't bring back the dweeb patrol as commentators,    No Serena to stop Sawatari being a bother.   Sawatari would constantly bother Yuya unless Serena is there to stop him    Wasn't he getting rekt by Security again and not against Chojiro?        Well, that was for episode 63. The manzai preview for today is for episode 62.    That preview was for 63, which is when everyone tries to jailbreak. The prison tourney is what leads into the jailbreak due to Shinji's plan, somehow.    sorry for the scrub question but what's a manzai   i hope he beats or doesn't get beat by chojiro, as in the duel is interrupted  i don't think i can handle two back to back losses         solid digits you have there my man    It's just an omake or extra after DM remaster's episode airs.  They replay the preview for Arc-V's next episode, then add an extra commentary from the characters with cute chibi pictures.  They call it manzai though since there's supposed to be at least an idiot guy and another guy who calls out the idiocy or at least notices it.       How did Shun manage to get so many RUM cards?    heart of the cards babyyyyyyy     Its been so fucking long since they were last on screen together. Yuya must be dying from citrus deprivation    Thanks you like my work.  Yuugo is the other big victim     Today's manzai:   Sawatari: Tomorrow is the Entertainment Duel Tournament!!    Yuya: You look pretty excited about it!    Sawatari: Yeah! It's been awhile since we had an exciting duel! You get some sleep too in preparation for tomorrow!    Yuya: That's right! Good night!    Sawatari: Yeah! ...Hey, what's that name of your hippo again?    Yuya: Eh? It's Hippo? Good night.    Sawatari: You too! ...Hey, do you want me to show you my new deck?    Yuya: It's Underworld Troupe! I already know that. I just want some sleep!    Sawatari: I'm so excited that I can't sleeeep!                       &gt;Sawatari: Yeah! ...Hey, what's that name of your hippo again?   What the fuck, Sawatari, how can you forget the most useless of Yuya's Entermate monsters?       &gt;Hey, what's the name of your hippo again?   &gt;Eh? It's Hippo?   I can't tell if that's cute or a bit stupid.       You mean scurvy.     Oh I forgot to mention a note about that. Sawatari uses the Japanese word for hippo which is「カバ」[kaba]. And in reply, Yuya says the english word and it's name, 'Hippo'.      Caring about TRASH cards     nice work     &gt;Sawatari: Yeah! ...Hey, what's that name of your hippo again?   &gt;Yuya: Eh? It's Hippo? Good night.   &gt;Sawatari: You too! ...Hey, do you want me to show you my new deck?   &gt;Yuya: It's Underworld Troupe! I already know that. I just want some sleep!  Holy fuck, I want to adopt Sawatari        Thanks. You can see them in deviantart or rule34 as jkcs1611991. I have finished a Yuya one recently but haven't upload. For me, Yugo clothes is lewd to me so I am working on him as well.   Enjoy (from Chojirou)     on the second episode of this anime, literally stunned at the amount of BS put on display rn maybe i should've started with 5ds like everyone here said     literally stunned at the amount of BS put on display   Mfw shitters cant create whatever cards they want mid duel     You guys, you guys. What if... all the Ruris think they're Serena, because of memory rewriting??     any card i want will be made and it will acquire any effect necessary for it to survive in this duel  what is going on       Stop projecting strawman    yo nigga that post was two hours old. He's not even here anymore.    how do you know, are you stalking him? then you're creepy unless you're together in which case d'awww    Yo son I don't give a fuck  I honestly just wanted to bump the thread      Not liking degenerancy   Is like you don't like tanoshii in your duels      New croissant animal girls when.    Shun.    DELETE THIS   oremay    Yuzu's look   She knows her Yuzus are smaller than Rin's Rins     S-Shit ;_;   Yuzu's yuzus are perfect.    Kenzan was another character I liked in GX. He was pretty bro tier and turning into a dinosaur in space was so retarded it was great.    I guess you're at the episode where I can finally ask this question  Why the fuck did literally no one carry Mystical Space Typhoon? If Jaden had used MST on Martin, he would have been able to prevent that duel from reaching such a shit hitting the fan level       Why the fuck did literally no one carry Mystical Space Typhoon?  Asuka uses it once, as do a couple other characters. But the answer is the same reason no one uses Solemn, or Dark Hole or any other staple. Nobody wants anime duels to be as homogeneous as real life duels     Yuzu!    Will Masumi ever become relevant again ;_;    She'll get killed by mega god Yuzu near the end of the show.    If they go back to Standard, maybe. It's a shame she never got to meet Serena.    She's going to get Shaddolls so she can eventually use Zefras.   laddies aan gentremen enterma duaelo    What mode will Masumi be in?  MUH YUZU   MUH HOKUTO   MUH MARCO-SENSEI   MUH HALIL THE FANBOY WHO YUZU WRECKED   MUH YUYA JUST TO TRY AND CUCK YUZU          MUH KUROSAKI-SENSEI!    MUH HATE FOR ACADEMIA! EVERYTHING IS THEIR FAULT!   Oh, man. Skulljoker makes Odd Eyes a great hidden boss in Performapal decks. All they need now is a tuner monster and I'll be able to run Meteorburst and Clear Wing, How long must I wait?    Noble Dragon Magician     Not a preformapal, it'd fuck up the whole thing    Season 3 was fucking great man  I hate it when people get on Judai for the shit that happened with the whole Supreme King dimension and all. The motherfucker had a monster that fucked up all his friends, lived a life without his parents and his brother in the hospital, and went to Duel Academy so he can have fun duels. Now that monster comes and fucks up everything, takes away his friend, and when he wants to go save his friend, everyone joins even though he tells them all to fuck off.  It wasn't his fault everyone were so thirsty for some Judai that they went into dimension and all got massacred. They all went in with their own free will. Hell if they all hadn't come, they wouldn't have died and Judai wouldn't have turned into a Supreme King and rescue Johan without any problems.  Judai is the fucking hero we all need but don't deserve           Current arc is about the conflict between Fusion, Synchro and Xyz   Fusion and Xyz hate each other   Synchro is currently neutral but sees Fusions and Xyzs are threats   Masumi, Hokuto and Yaiba are friends who each use the three summoning types.   Hokuto was kill first just like the Xyz Dimension.    I like candy.    Masumi should join Academia since they are Fusion users like her.  Except not really since Academia Fusions are better than LDS Fusions.   If you join, you get UNLIMITED FREE CANDY AND CHOCOLATE.  This is true.                 Shun will never be your dueling professor   he will never personally teach you how to rank-up   he will never show you his amazing rise falcon         Shun makes my falcon rise.    Why is Masumi so lewd?    Only Dennis and Serena aren't mentioned in the summaries.   Gon was mentioned earlier this month in the magazine summaries.   he will join along with Shun to fight off Security.   Dennis is obviously escaping with Yuya and co.   How do they plan on getting Serena though? Will she be forgotten?        Brown and a bully.   I love yugioh I play during recess with my friends    you'll never get bullied by Masumi     Selena will be hiding in Shun's coat.    Masumi is the original crude strong girl.   I found a torrent for Sound Duel 3 on nyaa, is it real?  Was getting the lancers caught part of Reiji's plan?    Odd eyes with Mufflio and Partnaga is just great  I lile about pure Performapals that the vanilla Odd Eyes is the boss monster and not some evolution. Except maybe Beast Eyes. But even then Odd Eyes + Beast Monster usually does more attack        Yes     No, but he'll act like it was and congratulate everyone for a job well done.      Anzu uses MST andnactually uses it to get rid of backrow   also runs Pot of Greed and Graceful Charity     discards pot of greed for burn damage and doesn't use Graceful charity and considered it a dead draw       It just hit me that Yuya's deck is rather good at dropping rank 4 xyz while Yuzu's has great fusion potential and Gong's all monster deck with such level variation makes it amazing for synchro summoning as he'll never run out of monsters. Was this planned?   Judai had Solemn in S1 and Dark Hole was forbidden, yet the Einstein dude used it.     Was this planned?  Well yeah, they do plan the cards they plan to shill at least a few months in advance. That being said, only Gon was really heavily hinted at (that one superheavy soul that made a monster level 5 was a giant syncro sign). Yuyas deck has a lot of level 4s sure, but so do most decks. And IRL Meldoius were just a weird bad lockdown deck, while anime Melodius were nothing pretty much      I remember when people said that Yuya's deck would be shit at Xyz because the only level 4 he used to use were Whip Viper and Bugondola.  Also Yuzu's deck is a shit fusion deck. Her deck specializes on swarming from the hand. Both synchro and xyz would suit her so much better.       What if her fusions become contact fusions like beast eyes and the shitty neos fusions?    l-lewd    tfw had a dream Serena was driving me around in an SUV   tfw she is a terrifying driver going 80mph around hairpin turns on a mountain fishtailing it thousands of feet above the ground   What the fuck have you guys and best Ruri done to me?      Yuya, at least, doesn't manage to escape.    When he brought out turtle and Chrono on the field against Chojiro, for half a second I thought he was going to r3 Xyz.    Don't make it sound dirty, you pervert.    Likely because in typical Yuya fasion, he got left behind trying to find Serena. Why are he and Yuzu such justicefags, their parents did way to good a job.       Well in Serena's case she just wants people to recognize her and have some friends.   She's a poor lost soul trying to find her place.      ____________ENJOY_______   YAMEROOOOO   UAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH</wbr>   What is this guy?  Stop or she will be treated as M.     Yuya and Serena are captured by Jean-Micheal and forced to compete in the Friendship Cup.      Treat her a whathever you want, I have a family to proudly take care of  On the other hand, based of what myths say about vampires I recommend you to let her be the dominant, just if you care about your life        Stop with the fucking jokes!      Implying Serena would need to be corsed into beating some faces in. Seriously, violence seems to be the only way to quill her Yuzu.wav. Just like Eago is for Yuya, maybe that's why those two are the easiest to manipulate in the Lancers.    I don't care, I really don't. I only want to see how are they gonna handle Yuya and Yuzu reunion and how many episodes we need to wait. That and also consider bracelet-kun.     Well, it seems like it's Reiji who's forcing them to compete, specifically Yuya, since that really was said in the previews. It's all according to Reiji's KEIKAKU for Yuya to join the tournament, after all.  Serena doesn't get any mention though. Who knows what she'll be doing.     Holy shit that's why he told you faggots to stay back home anyway  He keeps telling you to sit the fuck down and you guys keep following him like a lost puppy     It's sort of funny. Judai was the only one ever interested in the King of Games title, never won it, yet he's doing DBZ style fights and prince of persia shit in BBT.  Honestly I see Sawatari and Serena teaming up instead considering how brash they both are and want to prove themselves.       What the fuck    sorry guys       Judai stop speaking like one of your italian whores   I just realized, Yuya is literally that guy who says "It's just a children's card game."    Didn't paste for some reason      not watching the re-done subs with the dvd rips   VLC  Anon...  https://archive.moe/a/thread/125129<wbr>389/#q125140982</wbr>        More like "You can tryhard but at least have fun with it"    They went to school to learn fucking card games and alchemy They aren't the brightest bunch     Meanwhile we have Serena who thinks she's a Military Commander, Shun who thinks he's Che Guevara, and Reiji who thinks he's Batman.    No cheating allowed card makes it against the rules to summon a bunch of monsters in one turn   Lmao.     Even Judai isn't that bright, didn't he forget the rules to the game half the time or what his cards even did?    Oh god I remember these fucking godawful subs  (They talk about going after them)       0 seeders      (crowd not pleased with Judai's play)   Fucking kek      Even in Standard, which is the least edgiest dimension about the card game, people like Ishijima can gain a lot of fame and build wildly successful careers by simply beating others at duels enough times. Reiji and his mom manage to be leaders of the world in Standard simply by Leocorp controlling the card game and associated technology.     control hard-light technology   become masters of the world  Who woulda thunk it.      Kaibacorp was similar in having a lot of influence just for having power over the card game, even before Momentum.   And it's not like they actually use that insanely useful and versatile solid vision with mass technology for much of anything else but card games.       So hey if you're Reiji and his mom and Leo fucked off and you know he's gonna eventually come back with an invading force.  Why not, like. Use his company to make bombs.  Lots and lots and lots of bomb.         Kaibacorp was already fuckhuge because of massive weapons deals and one of the largest corporations in the world If anything Kaibacorp and Industrial Illusions just deciding to start pushing card games around the same time is what caused the world to be in the situations they're in during the show     Bombs don't stop magic monsters or the Pegasus card shadow realm.    Why do you think Reiji wanted Shun as an ally so bad?    This is correct. KaibaCorp used to be a military complex until Seto and Mokuba used their 51% ownership to drive Gozaboro out of the company, and then eventually Kaiba would completely convert the entire business out of military dealings into making card games solely to get revenge on an emo manlet for besting his real-death terminal.    You don't need to spend money manufacturing explosives when you can just print monster cards that attack using explosives.    Kaiba only took the company over to create Kaibaland for underprivileged children like he used to be and got all butthurt when his 'father' took his toys and games and shit.   which kill would you la kill for?  the one with the red  Rags fan here. Fuck Tampa.  I have to admit I never liked Satsuki. She acted like a bitch the whole way through.  Nonon   She was just a sison.   she just wanted her baby sister    which kill would you la kill for?  Best girl and waifu, Ryuko.      Tampa      MFW  How does this work?      tough fighter tomboy type   down-to-earth, knows when to cut her losses and run but isn't any coward   pragmatic and has a sense of decency   The thing I hated most about the show was her damn battle outfit. She looked a lot better in her regular school outfit. It was far less obnoxious, and she didn't need slutifying to be interesting.         The thing I hated most about the show was her damn battle outfit. She looked a lot better in her regular school outfit. It was far less obnoxious, and she didn't need slutifying to be interesting.  So I am not the only one that thinks this.    I hated this bitch so much. But at the same time her creepiness and always smiling turned me on   satsuki not being toronto maple laffs   Are you implying that Satuski loses?    Not in the least. She's devastatingly cute in her normal outfit, when she's being her normal spunky self.     Nui is like a xenomorph. Creepy but then annoying. Far as I know she doesn't reproduce through face rape but I think Disco Mom would give her a gold star for effort.    I would literally murder a person for him to be real.   satsuki is so fucking hot i want her to finger my belly button    I would literally murder a person for him to be real.  I don't think he'd fly for that depending on the circumstances.    satsuki is so fucking hot i want her to finger my belly button    finger my belly button   MFW           I know. Even if he hates me and I have to spend the rest of my life in prison, I just want him to be real.    The straight one.  Oh wait     Tampa bay all the way    I know. Even if he hates me and I have to spend the rest of my life in prison, I just want him to be real.  Just do it in the name of Satsuki. He'll understand.   The straight one.   Oh wait  One of them have to be. The one that is less likely to go lesbian because Disco Mom's rape and abuse caused mental scarring.         I'm sure theres probably a gamagoori walking around in japan  you're gonna need to ask him to blond his hair though     The Red Girl.    rags      I just want to ruffle her hair up. Even when it gets fluffy.    Tampa Bay      Kill? They're not worth it. I would rape them, though.    I want to fuck Satsuki in the ass.   /a/ giving a shit about sports.  Only the dead can know peace from this normal faggotry.     Kill? They're not worth it. I would rape them, though.  Disco Mom, what are you doing on 4chan?   I want to fuck Satsuki in the ass.  She seems like the type to enjoy that. Pic related and sorry for the mess. I'm an idiot like that.            you're new as fuck m8      mention to Satsuki you want four children   suddenly she's pregnant nearly every day for the rest of her life and you have almost 100 children with giant eyebrows like hers who all feud with each other for position in the Kiryuin hierarchy and their mom's affection       She's a fan of the Detroit Red Wings    I think Ragyo would at least get a pick out of her grandchildren.   you have almost 100 children with giant eyebrows like hers who all feud with each other for position in the Kiryuin hierarchy and their mom's affection  I'd watch that oddly enough.        I AM AN IDENTIFYING MARK        Kek. Why is my internet going crazy?      be Quebecker   hate hockey  I'm not a normie     nice, my favorite team  i'm gonna need someone to draw this up for me       So basically Kill la Kill meets Dallas.   Milf Satsuki    groups of her children rally around her old lieutenants and Ryuuko for guidance and training          Quebec   Fuck off faggot.      I'm sure this can not end horribly.    Lightning     You don't want dozens of Satsuki's children being trained by Gamagoori in the ways of the Head of the Disciplinary Committee?     i feel like hockey is the only acceptable sport.  but i'm not from Canada so that could completely change my perspective, being surrounded by it and awful people talking about it constantly.  i would love a hockey anime for the record.        I never said that. Let's see how that would go.     How fast would Satsuki kill me if I broke one of these? How is she going to know? I'm not sure why there isn't one for dating Satsuki but that would involve signing a contract with Ragyo and probably babysitting Nui. Is it strange that I think Disco MILF would try her hand eugenics if Satsuki had the life fiber parts like Ryuko? Just one woman's goal to find someone that is highly resistant to life fibers and have them get her daughter pregnant.   I'm thinking like this. I can imagedump the rest of them if anyone wants them.      I want to fuck Satsuki in the ass and then feed my dick to Ryuuko    I can't post the rest because my computer is having issues.  Hey, Anon, could you possibly help me with my plan to create a master race by getting my daughter pregnant?   That's how I see the whole situation.    I want to fuck Satsuki in the ass and then feed my dick to Ryuuko   MFW  That's lewd.          Tampa   not Rags   Better dead than Red, I guess.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12723656   could I join?     This can only be stopped in one fell swoop.   After everyone else of the original group dies off Ryuko goes insane and makes the Kiryuin clan Highlander each other to decide the dominant heir left standing, she kneels to let the last student become the master, proceeds to have severed head start manacle laughter ala Ragyo as it reattaches to disappear and haunt and strengthen the family for generations as she cant die due to the loss of life fiber blades. Centuries of the family line are considered cursed by the woman in red until she gets bored and one day shows up on the couch like its completely normal and proceeds to live an average life as a freeloader in the estate. Teaches the current head of the family lineage how to kill the life fiber core that landed as all reference of fibers were taken by Inu to the grave when his hard drives thermite bombed themselves as his heart stopped. Proceeds to guides this poor sole into becoming life fiber Batman. Then erases all memories of her existence from everyone else and waits for the need to rise again while the poor sole is thought to be insane with visions of the old family ghost.          That's lewd.   You know what's the lewdest part?   Ryuuko would do it too.          No, the lewdest part is they are sisters    I can go for it. I'm just picturing Satsuki and the father just looking at this mess and wondering what went wrong.    Surprisingly this has something to do with that. Again, sorry for the mess. Next one won't be a mess.    Best girl would have me wore down in at least a minute and a half.     So they get gay at the end right?      So they get gay at the end right?  Nope. Platonic sisters.       Ryuko has possibly absorbed fibers from Junketsu, Senketsu, Koketsu, Nui, and possibly the fibers infused with Ragyo's will. This combination can only end well in the long run as her mind turns into a self contained hive if they take root.       &gt;Ryuko has possibly absorbed fibers from Junketsu, Senketsu, Koketsu, Nui, and possibly the fibers infused with Ragyo's will. This combination can only end well in the long run as her mind turns into a self contained hive if they take root.   MFW best girl goes even battier than when she wore Junketsu.  I think in that case Ryuko would probably need mercy killing.       Incest makes it even better though     Satsuki is best girl but fuck Tampa.     Incest makes it even better though  How? That would probably cause memories of Ragyo's abuse to show up and Satsuki at least has a minefield of a psyche. That would be a rather messy explosion.    Fuck blackkawks Fuck Lightning     TFW she has the only means and ability to kill hybrids left.   At that point the only thing that probably could kill her is herself, unless someone realized the potential and made a contingency for it.     anyone have the episode reactions/thread reactions?   I'm with this anon     But then they can have those tender moments where they help each other get over their trauma.    I'd rather stick my peter in some blue boipussi    At that point the only thing that probably could kill her is herself, unless someone realized the potential and made a contingency for it.  Didn't Nudist Beach have some sort of bullet for something like this? Or go fishing for the scissor blades. I'm picturing Ryuko telling Satsuki to stop having kids before it got to the point it is now. At least around the tenth or fiftieth.    But then they can have those tender moments where they help each other get over their trauma.  At rationalize what their mother did to them. Chances that Satsuki would molest her own child do not look good in her favor.           Tsumugu Kinagase has himself frozen in secret by Nudist beach splinter operatives that refuse to rest until all life fibers are destroyed. Everyone's face when this man becomes humanities savior after all the bumblefucking of nudist beach when she least expected him some few hundred years in the future with a single starch bullet to the Medulla oblongata.

Yukinon is still way to autistic to even have a chance. She can't even say no to Yui's proposal without someone doing it first. I've always thought Yukinon was pretty awful as a character but this episode just proves how shit she truly is. How can anyone like her?    First for Gamama  Anyone else think the ending was bad? It didn't answer any questions, and  we didn't get to see Iroha   Goddamnit Commie.   Just give it up, dude.   What the fuck happened to the other thread?  Did the other thread get nuked or was everyone too busy being genuine to notice it was at bump limit?  so what happened to the other thread?       cuntkiller OP would be my guess.        it got nuked   Sides currently colonizing distant planets.   Mods are mad   Horriblesubs are out.   We only had 200 or so posts. So not sure why   What makes Yui think she could win though? She hasn't completed any requests.   My heart    tfw no "char"      it was the buy the LN ending i feared most and it came into fruition through the most unappealing boring let down of a cliff hanger makes me wanna go downtown buy a hooker and shove 10lbs of gouda cheese up her dead body only to eat it all out with some crackers   what the fuck happened here? is this important?  S3 CONFIIRMED     This was very disappointing     Ain't even a Yuifag, but Yuikinon is objectively awful.  Look at this shit. She was seriously trying to get Yui to stick around so she could help her give 8man the cookies. She knows exactly what's going on between the 3 of them. What a shitter.     Hamahead shark   yukino willingly gives the phone to 8man so her sister can talk to him   what a little bitch     I'm pretty sure she was Yui was holding her back.    WOOOAAAHH let me get a sweet pic for my foxy little sis aka best grill   Dump OP image tbh  also  buy the LN ending   spoils the ending of the LN   Retarded as fuck         No, Yui recognized what Yuki was planning on doing was going to give alone time for the other two. Yukino then froze and Yui was put in an extremely awkward situation    Nah nobody in 2ch thinks like that though    COOOMMMMIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEE</wbr></wbr>    No, she's that oblivious.    After a second viewing,  I think it's it obvious that Yui is just trying to bait 8man into doing the genuine talk.     She could have just stuck around, giving treats to Hikki isn't a big deal.    made my day    fucking commie. i will download CR for last episode   why is yukino so autistic and retarded about cats  it makes me cringe      isnt a big deal  hows the asylum this time of year?     This, but its still obvious that Yui still want 8man while maintaining their friendship.     Yukinon bakes cookies   Yui asks the elephant in the room if there are any for 8man   Yukinon just gives him some of hers   She actually has cookies for him   As they are saying goodbye, yukinon stops 8man and Yui sees the cookies   Yui tries to leave so that they can be alone   Yukinon begs with her shitty eyes for Yui to stay   Yui is like "what the fuck are you doing" and nee-san saves the day   Did you even watch this shit?            Good Irohasu~, everyone!   It's the only thing she can drop her act about and bee herself    Preach it.    Nah you clearly haven't read the 2ch thread.   原作とみんなのコメみてたら、結衣ENDかと思ったけど   アニメ見てたらゆきのんルートかと思わざるをえないけど   そしえら結衣がかわいそぎるやんけ         Because she's a Faker. This is why Haruno is shitting on her all the time.    This episode made it seem like Yui would have a better shot than Yukinon at this point. Where does Iroha stand in all of this?   The best moment was when Haruno pops up out of nowhere and Yukino pouts.  boner inducing.    Yui is such a cunt, holy shit   Watching that OP made the entire episode not horseshit because that was a big ass snoozefest.     Yukinon was pretty awful as a character  But she is the only character watari even bother to put his thought on.    Ara Ara gonna ara ara   Don't worry we'll get an Iroha spin-off.  She's actually quite poor and has a cross-dressing papa.  Makes her own service club with Komachi and 8man.  8man oniichan instincts get turned up to 11/10, openly calls Iroha imouto and makes her call Komachi imouto as well.  Club activities revolve around people paying to get advice on how to confess and/or going on mock dates.            Indirectly rejected according to the denial flags, has the best shot at the 8inch going by the Irohafags   Is that from the 2ch spoiler thread or just some random shit someone posted    If I can't have him neither can you     More like  I-I want to give Hikigaya-kun the cookies I made him!   But Yui might see, that will hurt her feelings!   Oh gosh, but if I do give it to him while we're alone that might make me come off as too clingy, especially with all the shit Nee-san keeps spouting...   Wait, no, Yui don't leave!   Wait, ohmygosh, doushio!          would watch and enjoy more then se2 ep13    No Idea man, but fuck. Now I have to read the LN.  The director is genius in the most terrible of ways.  S3 when?        Yui isn't going to win.  The purpose of this volume is to force Yukino to act on her feelings. Yui was just there to act as one of the triggers.  The 8man bowl is decided, I'm sure of it now.        I'm pretty sure Yukino just doesnt hurt Yui feelings that's why she's hesitant about giving 8man the cookies.   Yui on the other hand is asserting her dominance over Yukino. Listen to the stuff she says at the end       Makes her own service club with Komachi and 8man.   implying it won't be Komachi and Taishi     Yuki made some great faces this episode.    3 years of getting cockblocked  Poor Taishi       Retards who can't read between the lines.      Few threads back there was a post saying that Hachiman noted he liked old Yukino (from 2ch) or something. Anyone actually finished the LN to know?    Yui's lip trembling and hands shaking when she gives 8man the chocolates   oh god    Best episode of the entire series. Best episode of the season (as in anime season).  Whether you are a Yuifag or a Yukinofag, there's no way this episode didn't satisfy you.     S3 never. Not enough source material. If the rest of the series ever gets adapted, it'll be OVAs.  FUCK WATARI     Do wait, both girls are in love with 8man? Isn't that going to be huge down the line?   You been living in a cave anon?     down the line  Where the fuck have you been?      both girls are in love with 8man?   You only just realized that?      how...how could u possibly like this episode over all the others it cant be possible    Those aren't chocolates. Those were cookies. The point is that she was making a statement that she wasn't going after Hachiman anymore, hence thank you cookies and no chocolates.    good call if Taishi makes it into Soubu, Saki would have no choice but to join the club as well to keep him out of trouble. She can be the oka-san and go over the budget on her clip board     things aren't looking good for yui i hope she wins :(   jojo OP  come on  <br/>     So what did this penguin scene mean?   OVAs could be better than a third season.    r u kidding me? shit ended in an obvious cliffhanger to boost LN sales   Why have these stupid fucks taken so long to confess their feelings, also I feel retarded as they cover up how they truly feel by saying stupid shit, could a lovely /a/non clear this up for me.   I hope you're fucking joking.   They rushed through volumes 10 and 11 way too fast    Why have these stupid fucks taken so long to confess their feelings   Because that's how harem animes work        Marrige     Jojo   Kill yourself you fucking retarded cock sucker.      fucking kek so dumb its gotta be b8    Awkwardness for everyone.   HEALING WHEN   Watari uses Yui as a catalyst for the Hachiman and Yukino relationship; shes the bridge between them since forever  In the beginning of the series, Yui made hachiman run after Yukino. Her making Hikki promise to always look after Yukino during Culture Festival comes to mind; also genuine speech when she said for him to go after her  Nowadays, Yui is making Yukino go after Hachiman (in terms of feelings though). This entire episode was her doing that in subtle ways       I can't tell if this adaptation is just a mess or if I'm having difficulty understanding it. Yui proposed that the group stay together and literally does nothing about their feelings, right? And she plans on winning that battle Hiratsuka introduced, and then what? Is she planning on making Yukino confess to 8man, making Yukino step away from 8man, or making 8man date her?   I'm pretty sure if it was any of us were in that situation, it would probably go down like that as well.    Is this the new "I didn't see that live triangle coming." meme?   Those are some serious mental gymnastics, she literally said "I'm going to take it all." Hope you can overlook her asking Yukinon to drop her interest in 8man in exchange for depending on both of them because of chocolate vs cookies is beyond me.       Why do they cover their true feelings by saying retarded shit?    Sorry meant to reply to this    guaranteed replies/10    No I would have left. FUck that    it means someone has to die or disappear before 8man can move onto another chick bird pun     I read and just like /a/ there are one or two anons who have opinions like that, they are just say what they thought just like /a/, don't mean every 2ch posters think like that and don't take everything from there as a fact they are just like /a/.    Why would it make them awkward though?    Yes, the last scene and how Yukino was behaving lead me to believe 8man melts her panties and you would have to be retarded not to see Yui likes him ever since S2 episode 5       I thought Yui was trying to get Yuki to give her cookies to 8man too so as to make Yuki's romantic intentions clear, but Yuki still refused.    Nigga come on     Yukino just doesnt hurt Yui feelings   This just isn't true at all. The whole point was that Yukinon isn't able to make decisions for herself. It's not even at the level where she stops herself from doing something because she thinks it'll hurt her friend, she just can't act without some kind of support blanket - usually in the form of following her nee-san or someone telling her to do something.  The point of what Yui is saying is basically to try and force Yukinon into some kind of action. To do something that she wants to do all on her own. It's not about Yui asserting dominance or trying to make herself look better for 8man, everything she says is for Yukinon. Of course, I'm sure there's some part of her that wanted things to end that way so she could get the 8man D, but that's not the reason.        I feel ya. Just put the gun in my mouth and pull the trigger.     I'm pretty sure if it was any of us were in that situation  The situation wouldn't have existed in the first place.    Did you guys know Penguins are birds?   yahari isn't a harem they said    she will take eveything    yes    What did Yui think they were if not birds     2 girls   harem      Why aren't they called Penbirds then?   Irohafags are basically dead now, BTFO once and for all in just 20 minutes   No that wasn't the proposal. The proposal was for the club to help Yukino with her problems. As for the club contest, if Yui wins then she forces each of them to maintain the status quo. Of course, she says this knowing that Hachiman would reject it.    All that fucking tension   Fucking hell man do they expect me to enjoy this?    IT'S NOT A HAREM IF THEY'RE GAY   What if 8man just married both of them?  and has a secret relationship with Iroha     That includes herself. She doesn't want to lose anything so she's not going to do anything.   volume 11 is not going to be satisfying at all   Confirmed     and has a secret relationship with Iroha  That's nothing but deceit.      i-iroha has no feeling  fuckoff     She does but 8man doesn't    Not at all, he would still love them both, They would probably just be awful lays and wants some prime puss.    The "I will take everything" implies something other than maintaining the status quo, assuming that isn't entirely said to entice Yukino into action. What she proposed as a request was that they maintain the status quo until the winner of the competition is decided, effectively lifting Yukino's burden for the time being but not actually solving anything until the end.    Anon, there's only 1 girl genuine enough for the 8man.    Irohafags had nothing to talk about this episode because Iroha wasn't present.  You're just mad they got all them dubs and trips for their waifu.   Nothing gets solved. Even if they have a child.  Child is confused about who her mother is and where her father is. Child is told 8man is on a very important mission to protect Konoha. 8man running around with Iroha on "business trips".            8man does, it just hasn't blossomed because of limited exposure.  If Iroha was there from the beginning, she would've won by now. Her pace is ridiculous. Sly as fuck.  She has no chance right now though unless Watari goes with no love ending.        you are to new     In order of best to worst starting from the left    what Haruno was saying to Yukinoshita is basically what Yuki's issues is right? She lacks an "identity" which is what caused her to be dependent on some level   Too bad she isn't in that pic.    The child can grow up to be like 8man but he has 2 moms.     8man has feeling to anyone     I want to take that girl to Saize. Her laughter is adorable.   Melodrama the anime.    saize   HAHAHAHA ANON SAIZE      heh she will get 10.5 OVA and that will make yuifags and yukinofags mass suicide    You're going full autism anon, calm down.     OVA from a not even main LN   Sounds about right for Iroha      exactly what I wanted.   Can anyone explain why Haruno wanted to talk to Hikigaya on the phone?   You are not wrong but both the proposal and the contest related with each other    Haruno knew that the words she spoke was Hikki's words.    To fuck with Yukino    it was pretty lame.  beating around the bush the anime      She invited him back to Yukino's place if Yukino was going to stay at Yui's.  8man was too tired the following morning to walk Komachi to the testing area.       did they fug ?    He was just walked home gently.   Since the season is over which doujin are you going to jerk off to?   the sensei love hotel one   How can Yukino be such a tool and still look down on Hiki?  I can't accept your ways of doing things.   My way of doing? Oh I'll just copy my sister.      As a guy who marathoned S1 earlier this year, and then didn't pick up the LNs until halfway through this season, I'd have to disagree.  It's actually really nice to have your "second pass" for most of the major scenes be the original material because since you know the key details, the finer nuances tend to stand out more.      good man    Sensei is the only choice.     buy me a drawing tablet, so i can fix their bodies especially her vagina and his penis.  Still the most fappable one so far.      Boy this thread went downhill fast.    forgetting Chapter 3 this hard   Iroha can have her deceitful "date." Yukino's had a good one and Yui's had two. Then just like when Spyro released chapter 3, Irohafag crowing will suddenly die to a whisper when Yukino and Yui come to check on 8man's progress with the article.      The one where 8man fucks all the girls including the trap.  Love hotel is fine too.      I don't think you were here for the past 24 hours. We had 3 threads of just dub posting.    People with autism can be very unaware of their own problems.    I was the first o reply to OP   HAHAHA   HACK A C K       O for fuck sake    Does this mean sex scene between 8man and Yukino       So if Yui wins the whole parallel falls apart right?     well this becomes shittier every episode.  Glad it's over. Now i'll just have wait 2 weeks-1 month and Oregairu threads will be gone.     Yamato Nadeshitter always wins.  Japan and their cliches      We can only hope anon.    SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT   Why is there almost no oneeshota anime?  It's always loli this, imouto that.     I really appreciate it anon.    Ikenai Bikini no Oneesan by shuz    Not knowing Shuz   No actual sex is a bad thing  When did you become so gay, /a/?     your not welcome in Murica then!!    Google gives nothing.   Tomorrow is the final episode/epilogue so I thought I should post this.  For those who don't know. A artist on twitter by the name of Tsukumo has for every episode since UBW started up in October has posted multiple comics of Saber reacting to watching the UBW anime and Shirou reacting (along with other characters watching it). He was doing it based on what was should happen in the episode based on the VN (So he posted it when it happened live) and everything original in the anime.  It got really popular on both twitter and pixiv and he even decided to publish it as doujin.  Going to post all of it from episode 0-episode 24 along with the translated text and Shirou's reaction he posted with it on twitter.  Hope you enjoy.           TV Screen:You can't do that. Shirou, Archer is your... I know. I know what he is... I've probably known since the moment we met...   Shirou: (Our Saber is making a face as if she's just now realized it...)      In other words, Shirou has the possibility of growing 20cm taller as of now you say... I-I'm not a least bit envious of that you know! Stopped growing at the height of 154cm      You were the red man all along?   Poor saber.     Forced to kill himself again...   Shirou: Looks like that triggered a trauma for her...      Can Shirou actually project any food that's sword related?   http://manga.redhawkscans.com/reade<wbr>r/read/nisekoi/en/0/176/  FUCKING DROPPED  </wbr>   Because Marika is a lot like Yui but Tsudereish.    My favorite gag chapter, and for no reason other than it just made laugh was the bugs and such the reborn would use as ''messengers''   My favorite chapter was the snowball one for sure, again it wasn't that special or anything just fun and reminded me of days outside in the winter   Reborns first 25% will remain my favorite gag manga to this day        I dropped it at around 150 when chitoge didn't leave and everything stayed the fucking same. I just came to check what happened and surely enough it's the same shit. Besides, haru or tsugumi are out of the bowl, so there is no reason to read this shit anymore.    See you next week.      Chitoge and Tsuna's dialogue in J-Stars is about how she can't hide the fact she's in a crime family   Normal people don't have bodyguards you dumb bitch      Drawfag Thread 1523  second rarfag's files until thread 1509: https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku  Draw Friends Booru! http://drawfriends.booru.org/  Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!

IDK why Mai hasn't colored any of these, except the 1st one, since it's not hers      The new LN releases today. Let's all wait warmly for it while discussing cute yuushas     Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human.      &gt;Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human.      Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human.  It kills my kokoro that we know that something is wrong with Yuuna but we don't even know what exactly. During the whole second VN Yuuna acted like she was daijobu so the others don't have to worry. God damn it Yuuna you are supposed to talk to someone if you are troubled ;_;  Protect Yuuki Yuuna, even if she is 100% Vertex or godess or whatever now she still is perfect!         Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human.      &gt;Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human.  </blockquote>]
