[  X: The Animation    OP: The Gay Dumb Idiot    anime title consists of more than 4 words    the title is in english and it's spelled wrong     Gay    Fuck off racist cis scum      X: From Animation   Kingu soon  RURI A SHIT A SHIT   Did you say Kingu Shun?  WAVING THE FLAG OF REBELLION! https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=a0f<wbr>PvVyxWGs</wbr>  [ ]   The quality isn't going down, it's just that the rollercoaster of arc-v is back to the bottom of the arc again. It'll build back up, then it'll drop. Such is Arc-V. Hopefully.     you're right, the quality is going up.    Whoa, Yuya's; gonna duel Jack? I need to catch up, only on episode 30 right now. Hope Yuya eventually snaps one day, I swear he's got issues.     Go away Xyz Yusei      This just feels like we're killing time waiting for the friendship cup  It's called world building.     inb4 actual speed spells and speed counters cause tournament     on episode 30 right now    Hope Yuya eventually snaps one day   hehehe       Nah, prison arc is pretty fucking bad.    even the summaries tell of jobbing    not liking ENJOY!     Please That's everything I'm asking for They could have some extra rules for pendulums       SUPIIDO SUPERU - JI ENDO OBU SUTOUMU HATSUDO    Synchro Dimension has the highest QUALITY     How? The Enjoy duel was fucking glorious     I didn't like the prison arc in 5Ds (I dropped the show twice during that fucking prison bit at the beginning) so I'm willing to assume it'll get better when they get out.     ENJOY!    KOI KOI     I enjoyed prison more than seeing that pointless handicapped duel between Shun and Dennis     CHOJIRO CHOJIRO CHOJIRO        He's gonna have his time eventually  r-right?      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6aM<wbr>tT3ha_cU</wbr>  [ ]   DUSTY ROBES      At this point I'm just going to assume that Yugo, Yuzu, and Reiji started a tap-dancing group and are panhandling for change on the streets   counterless speed spell hybrids cause they are monsters? maybe the spell effects just count as monster effects so they cost no counters but can still be targeted as speed spells or whatever. I think it would just be amazing to see Yuya have a real Speed Duel against the king.    5ds prison arc was top tier though  Yusei fucking up the Prison Warden with sleight of hand and trash cards       It was a pointless duel but in the end it was just means for bringing Dennis, Gon and Shun together and setting up Dennis and Shun as opponents for this arc. Dennis is probably gonna all out against Shun and Shun is only hyped up because he's gonna job badly to Bennis, which in turn will hype Bennis up as a real fucking threat. It was obvious it wasn't gonna have a conclusion and at least we got new Raid Raptors and Entermages out of it       SILENT BOOTS     We already know that Yugo and Yuzu are laying low and lurking around somewhere in the slums, though.   It's Reiji who might or might not be up to something       Worldbuilding.   Includes Shun being the new Crow   If they need worldbuilding, they could always do that with Yuya and other characters instead of wanking over how powerful and cool Shun is.       I think the best way to do Speed Counters is to make them generic, to use a Spell Card, they need 2 or 3 counters or something.   So will Selena help Yuya and the Lancers escape, or is she still trying not to drop the soap in Butch Queerio Camp?    Academia uses it too. Dennis used his badge to show that he was an ally of Academy to the Obelisk Force     I want Reiji to have found an old abandoned military silo and hacked into Neo Domino's systems to revenge-keikaku Jean-Michel.     No but they could do stuff like pendulums using up a speed counter when you use them or something.     She'll watch some shit on that tv she has in her room.    Fuck you the last two episodes were great     3 episodes are an arc now?     that could work as a irl mechanic and would work uniform for all decks. I can see that being a thing. Maybe quickplay is 2 and normal 3 or something   Man, Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon would of been an amazing rank 4 if it treason discharge every monster on the opponents field at once, rather than target, especially sense you have to burn it's units for that.   I don't really care that much about a duel having to have a ton of drama/stakes or whatever hinging on it. Just as a duel itself, that 3000 LP handicap just rubbed me the wrong way from the start, and ruined the tension.   How they interact is also not that amusing since Shun can be so dismissive at times, it was just Shun going  bakana, this LDS fake-Xyz user isn't a total scrub!          Nah that would be stupid. The point of speed spells and speed counters is that you have to save up speed counters for the big and powerful spells, while weaker speed spells can be used immediately and most of the time don't even use counters.       Shun wasn't interesting, but Dennis was glorious     It's already a pretty good card.  Pity about that OPT clause so I STILL can't justify running cards like Overlay Regen.     The ENJOY and THE MAN duel was pretty cool.     They could have some extra rules for pendulums  How would they even know that?  Also I don't think they will shill Speed only cards anymore because they can't sell them        Remember the Eita arc? Was my favorite arc.     YES I'M ENTERTAINER    Summary anon delivers  Previous thread  just 5-8% remaining of chapter 5 and epilogue.  Neorigami best girl, Phantom best mom (?).      Phantom is MILF  Shiori a shit   Reine is probably older than her.   Shiori is a shit indeed    SAMEFAG!.  Where is summary anon?      Yoshino a slut.   It's NeOrigami, you fag    But phantom is young and tight    How does Tsunako keep on drawing even more lewd things?  Just when you think she can't draw anything lewder than the last one.     Are there too many dates in DAL? I think so.   I want to marry Kotori.      marry a table    Nigga what?     There is a less dead thread guys   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127162596      Fuck you this one was first    Enjoy your report, this thread was first filthy secondary.   the summary will be posted here.   Summary anon?   Is this the real thread?   Check the out when this was posted.    This is the  genuine  thread,  yes     The other thread have more than 80 replies from the samefaggots talking to themselves, terrible way to start a DAL thread. They're just calling shitposters in.   Daily reminder this is the end girl.   True End    Reine = phantom Phantom = Shidou's mom  Reine true end = incest end.  WHAT?       The one true thread Reine will be are guiding light!   come in this thread   see cancerous posts already <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127165753   And this thread is better why?     Who said Reine is Shidou's mom? for now all what we know there is Phantom and Spirit N°2 who was imprisioned on DEM industries, besides remember Kurumi knows who is phantom and who is the spirit numer 2.    Incest=Wincest    Why she's always the only one sane and competent person on the entire LN? I mean Koroti is a piece of shit as commander, the team of Ratatorsk is shit too.  She deserves a better team like the DEM ones.       Kurumi knows who is phantom and who is the spirit numer 2.  Kurumi is the oracle     I bet she's older than everyone, for some reason Kurumi is like a non-virgin 30 years old slut who keeps her looks using her own power.    Mods love loud retards.    Good thing the janitor works fast.  Oh and is the Material A = Mio thing was confirmed from the guy who did short summary spoilers or is it just speculation?      Kurumi is pure    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127165881   Samefag OP from the other thread getting assblasted because he doesn't know how to use the catalog.   Fuck off retard, remember guys report and ignore these secondaries shitposters.       Mods encourage shitposting apparently.    It is confirmed but seems like Mana and Shidou used to play with her when they were kids.    Are you retarded? It doesn't matter which thred is the real one as long as there is discussion and this thread is filled with autism    Enjoy your ban shitposter.   Miku is worst girl    non-virgin 30 years old  Im okay with this as well as Reine and Tamae      secondaries shitposters.  This secondary and cuck shit from Oregairu is really getting annoying. This only encourage more shitposting.       Reine  She's too lazy to ride dicks so she's virgin.   Tamae  She still virgin too, actually she doesn't even know what a dick is.       Reminder that Mana is a placeholder and a plotdevice  Reminder that Mio is Shidou's and Mana's childhood friend who was captured by DEM along with Mana  Picture related, Mio and Tohka being sluts       Just ignore that and keep discussing the series, that guy did the same last thread.     Mio    Posting RIO   What?       Slut and retard     Tohka   Slut  Fuck off      No DEM has the Second spirit it is unconfirmed if second = No 2. but a bit of food for thought Shidou and Mana's true last name does have 2 hidden in it 崇 in Takamiya (崇宮) contains ニ (2). And more fun with names. The Ma used in Mana can also be read as Shin (true).     well Mana is the true Imouto    At that point, nearly everyone has 一 in their names. But for Reine and Shidou, combining the kanji in their names straight up give you　十一 and　零.    What about Mana being spirit number 2? and that's the reason why she lost her memory?    I really want to know if Tachibana is running out of ideas, seriously, everyone knows what is going to happen with phantom and shidou. I think this LN have just 3 or 4 more volumes because at this point is turning into a trainwreck.    We might get a few more then that if he dose more volumes like this instead of new spirts     running out of ideas  Hardly, he's got one big event planned, but we don't know what it is. Or at least I don't know what going to happen. With every volume, he just keeps throwing out little bits of information that we can't do anything with. I just want to know what's really going on between Shidou, Phantom, Westcott and Woodman, but we usually only get a chapter dedicated to plot.     Meh I doubt it    do you think there will be more spirits then the ones on the tree of life like Rinne and Mayuri?

Almost everything Tachibana does that pertains to the plot is planned and isn't actually just pulled out from his ass. He just puts it out very, very slowly. I blame harem antics.     Nope.      More spirits   Why? we already have all what we want in terms of spirits and Rinne/ Mayuri are just cannon shit.  PIC RELATED       Hi all  Kaguya a Cutie     I get your point but wishful thinking    If he introduced more spirits without somehow working with the theme, then DAL would be kind of a wreck. But I doubt that'll happen.    Not likely as the color for number 2 is gray and as a spirit she would be much stronger and there is no way Wescott would let her get away. I'm more convinced it is their mother. The reason I brought up the Shin thing is there is someone with grey hair that keeps refering to Shidou as Shin and who he woke up to with them in his face after haveing a dream that was almost word for word what Phantom later told him in volume 11 with his name censored out.     Highest crown   Highest wisdom      both are semi related to the tree. Rinne is an alternate Da'at and Mayuri seems to be a reference to the lower order of angles.    all spirits are kinda ironic when matched on the tree    Miku-Redemption    Actually Origami is the most powerful spirit, even more than Kurumi or Reverse Tohka so yeah she deserves to stay at the top.    The tree isn't a ranking of power though    I think he is referring to Origami's repeated showing of lack of wisdom.     lack of wisdom.   Stop Kotori of killing Shidou   The rest of the girls just do nothing    Yeah sure anon, lack of wisdom.         all spirits are kinda ironic when matched on the tree  pretty much       Rinne, Rio, and Phantom are definitely part of the Zeroth Spirit group. Phantom might be Ain Soph who without her, the spirits might as well have never existed, hence why she calls all of them her children, even the human born ones.    That is lack of wisdom.   The logical thing to do was kill him. Logic before feelings. Always      USA was wise on throwing the atomic bomb on Hiroshima? because following your logic killing people for random reasons is wise.  Killing shidou was just a desire of part of the staff on Ratatorsk organization, instead of do some research about how stop him they create a superweapon, dat logic.      I'm not going to get into this actually but the US made the right decision. Learn some history, it was the only option to avoid more bloodshed   doesn't mean it was good      There was a second bomb too.    Showing wisdom once does not erase the other times she hasn't. And it is debatable if that really is a wise choice. We know it will work out because of the type of series DaL is, but the fact is if Phatom hadn't helped it is unlikely they could stop him from killing himself and millions of people. I like her but you have to admit wisdom is her dump stat   Where is summary anon? is he dead?  New nep looks the Yami's put togther   He said he will be late in the other thread.    Or maybe he just don't like this thread.        Said he would be late today   More of best team when?   Learning wisdom does, though. Phantom chooses candidates for their potential, not their current status. Origami is as wise as Tohka is worldly, which is to say not. They'll both get there, though. Eventually. Maybe.    Next volume   I love Yoshino!   You do realize they did reserch and found the only other way besides killing him was to seal all the known spirits. They've been trying that but Shidou is going critical about to melt down and he is going to do more damage then the event 30 years ago. Yes killing him based on the infomation they currently have is the wise choice.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127169157  But both can be pretty smart when the plot needs it tbh. Plus Tohka is surprisingly perceptive    Never   Is shidou going to die?  Please say yes dal should be yuri     Origami when she needs to be, Tohka is just Autistic    Yes.   And that's when Ratotoskr finds out this guy can seal spirits too.       No permanent change to Shiori    That would be a shitstorm  Specially when the bwaka falls for him       In the next game.     No, it's not, it's the short-sighted solution because it solves the problem of him exploding but does nothing to solve the long term problem of "these magical girls will not stop wrecking our shit".  In fact, it creates an additional problem, which is that the previously handled girls are now unsealed and sad/angry.  And yes, they *know* how to solve Shido's problem without letting him explode. All he has to do is kiss the girls. If they would bother to explain that he's a walking time bomb, the problem would go away because Shido isn't an edgy shit. It's because they avoided explaining the problem that the situation degraded so far.        That's actually wrong though considering through the series Tohka's made much wiser choices than Origami     Nope.     11=10+1. SOON.    Cute A.I when?    We can dream anon    Tohka was fallowing her heart not using her retarded brain     So anyways, are there stats for spirit Origami?     They are bullshit    You will never have Maria as an app on your phone     Aside from dumb innocence being her trope/gimmick for the series, she's probably never made a bad decision in the series overall. At least when things get serious. She's an ideal teammate for NeOrigami     Yeah, the charts in the bin were updated.    Devil op pls nerf    I still say Kotori is bullshit. Way too low.    she will never show up again     &gt;Educated Guess.   I still think we were not that far off with the information we were given.      These stats don't really give the whole picture though.  Kotori would kill any one of these guys.       Kotori can defeat servants  Discuss     You mean Yoshino, right?    Yoshino is weak as hell apparently    Kotori would blast away Yoshino's ice, water, steam, whatever.    Kaguya best base stats    She's got the second lowest INT though.    Tohka's main issue really is naivety and generally being gullible. She actually has a fair amount of wisdom I think.   So how much was left?   Smarter then Tohka that's all I need    She's the natural airhead that has good instincts towards people and battle sense     We've been through this before, small fast target with great ranged power and since Vol.11 close combat capabilities and additional armor and weapons. Her weakness being low con and not wanting to fight, a serious Yoshino would wreck shit.      They didn't sound the kill Shidou alarm until he started going critical and from the looks of it lost his capability of rational thought and a feild that even weaked the girls might not be able to get through. At this time there is likely less then an hour before he blows. So there choices are do nothing and bet on the nearly nonexistent chance the girls can defuse him where if they fail you can say good by to all of whats left of south east Asia and a high posablity of the spirits going inverse as well. Option 2 Kill him and hope you are able to talk down the spirits by pointing out Shidou would never have wanted to kill millions of people.   There is no golden option and having the spirits inverse is marginally better then another super spacequake      Now that I think of it, isn't Phantom's plan basically to make the ultimate Sephira crystal? Considering what we've learned this volume.    Shidou might as well be the successor of the First Spirit. All the Sephiras might have been one and part of the First Spirit, so Phantom wants to recreate him/appointed "someone" as the successor and so on. Who knows? Also: most people think that Reine is Phantom, but what if Tachibana says "You think so? F*ck it! Now Phantom is gonna be someone else!", wouldn't be the first time an author did this.    Her str is pathetic    - The beast surrounded with glaring light continue its way while flattening the tree in front of it. Kaguya and Yuzuru keep their eyes fixed at the beast while rushing through the sky. Kaguya asked Yuzuru if she is ready, Yuzuru answer her that she is while making fun of her. Kaguya raise up her voice while lowering their elevation. - Kaguya and Yuzuru surrounded Shidou from left and right. Kaguya and Yuzuru nodded to each other and release the wind to Shidou. Shidou slowed down a little at the wind pressure. Kaguya and Yuzuru don't really think they can stop Shidou with that wind. The real part is from now on.  "&lt;Rafael&gt; — [El Re'em]!"  - Kaguya shouted. A wing grew out of her shoulder, an armor covered her arm and a lance appeared in her hand. Kaguya attacked Shidou's barrier made of Spirit Power with her lance. Intense wind coiled up in the surroundings. The barrier that surrounded Shidou broke apart for a short moment. Within that short moment, Yuzuru raise up her voice,  "Concord. &lt;Rapael&gt; — [El Nachash]!"  - Yuzuru shouted, releasing her Pendulum onto Shidou. The string of the Pendulum twined around Shidou's hands and legs and stopped him.   "Chance. Kaguya!" "Coming!"                - They both close to Shidou in a split moment. Shidou growled.  "Shidou — I'm going to save you." "Returning. Just like how Shidou did to Yuzuru back then."  - Yuzuru and Kaguya said that and move their face near Shidou and placed their lips onto Shidou's lips. "……!" Kaguya and Yuzuru feel their body is getting hot. Almost like a flow of blood that has been stopped is now flowing again.   "This feeling… the Path has opened?" "Agreement. Probably. When Yuzuru is still holding Shidou, everyone please —"  - Before Yuzuru could finished her words,  "—Gaaaaaaa!"  - Shidou howled and break himself away from [El Nachash]'s restraint. Yuzuru and Kaguya are then blown away by the impact. Shidou continued his path. Before Yamai could follow him, a gigantic silver rabbit ran pass them.   "Yoshino!?"  - Yoshino then nodded at Kaguya who called her name.                      So? Ranged attacks and Spirit Ice based weapons.     So Kaguya and Yuzuru were able to kiss him and now it's Yoshino's turn? Looks like it'll be the same with the "dates": Yamai Twins, Yoshino, Natsumi, Kotori, Miku, Origami, Tohka.     It's unclear, her goal seems to be to create the Da'at, a being that is made up in parts of all the sephirots, but whether she just wants the crystal or it to be him is unkown.   He's had a lot of lead up to Reine not being normal about half of them point to her being Phantom the other half point to her being Shidou's mother. Then in volume 11 we got hints that Phantom is Shidou's mother so unless it was being set up as a long term red harring it's doubtful he would do a switch like that, it's bad writing.       Miku a shit LMAO.    Ah wait, it was a bit different with the dates. Sorry~    Origami the most powerful spirit confirmed.     Like that matters for caster characters.    Go Twins!    Stats are literally worthless for somebody like her. It's all about angel's powers.     Every time I see the charts, I can't help but think that DaL would be a nice Fighting-Game/MMORPG    kiss battle   Hilarious    Just realized how the colored parts for Origami's skills are shaped like the paper envelop thing with drugs she used for her date.    Neptunia\DAL crossover game when    02/31/2061     WHO THE FUCK IS NEP?     Best Retard for last    Get the fuck out    Hopefully    This is Glorious NEP  faggot        retardfags  Disgusting      That Tohka's gonna be last is something we can tell from the illustrations and the fact that she didn't get a date with Shidou (the rest was just food, food, feeding food and food again)    Defending retards   Atrocious      Nepgear a shit    Tohka a BEST        Tohka a BEST Retard     Tohka a cute. A CUTE.    Feels good     Landwhale   One thing about Tohka is good: there are many things she doesn't know/understand, so you could teach her many "good things", if you know what I mean *evil laugh*   Tohka A SHIT      Welcome back Summary Anon.      I can feel the Autism    Is that supposed to a bad photo anon? Cause it's adorable    Retard      It was a meme about Neptune being way too OP in that Sony fighting game ala Smash Bros, she reks shit and people don't know who she is.    Probably should have posted the picture.    Sneaking up on a Retard shame on you    It's okay    Rape is always the answer.    it's just non concensual sex it's fine    "—&lt;Zadkiel&gt;!"  - The rabbit-shaped angel open its mouth hearing Yoshino's words. The surrounding is then covered by cold air. The moisture in the air condensing and freeze the ground, rocks, trees, and even Shidou's legs.  - Shidou's movement is stopped by the ice. Yoshino let &lt;Zadkiel&gt; ran to front of Shidou and make her grovel to the ground. Yoshino lean herself forward from &lt;Zadkiel&gt;'s back and move her face near Shidou.   "Shidou-san… please back to normal"  - Yoshino then placed her lips onto Shidou's. She feel her body is getting hot. Her Astral Dress glowed with a faint light. Yoshino then called the person who is clinging on her back,  "Natsumi-san, please also…!" "Y-Yes…"  - Natsumi who is riding on &lt;Zadkiel&gt;'s back together when Yoshino then let her face out. Natsumi is the only one who is not wearing her Astral Dress. It's not because she don't want to help Shidou, but she already used up her Spirit Power in the middle of Shidou's capture. That's why Natsumi can't manifest her Astral Dress.  "…I'm sorry for causing Yoshino a trouble without thinking. I'll die." "Eh?" "N-Nothing… I have to help Shidou."  - Natsumi said in embarrassed tone. When Natsumi tried to lean herself forward from &lt;Zadkiel&gt;, she slipped her hand and fell to the ground on her face.   "Hebu!?" "N-Natsumi-san!" "I-I'm fine. I'm fine…"  - Natsumi pushed her nose while wave her hand to Yoshino. Even though she said fine, her eyes is teary and there is a blood coming out of her nose.   "T-Then Shidou, I'm sorry it have to be me. …It was originally your fault for not handing me the Spirit Power, that's why I'm this in form. Don't sue me because I kissed you while you're out of conscious… I'm going to kiss now, okay? Okay? If you don't want to then say it?" "Um, Natsumi-san, we don't have time…"                               - That moment,  "—Ahhhhh!"  - Shidou grit his teeth pulling out all his strength and shattered the ice on his legs. Shidou then attacked Natsumi who is nearby. "Guhya…!?" Natsumi screamed with a weird voice while bending her body backward. However, Shidou couldn't reached her. The silver pipe that appeared in her surrounding tied up Shidou's body.   "Ufufu~ I made it in time~."  - Miku in Astral Dress walked to her. She used her &lt;Gabriel&gt; to help Natsumi.   "Miku…" "Are you okay, Natsumi-san? If you want to thank me just give me a kiss~" "W-who will do that!" "Um, looks like Shidou-san is trying to move again…"  - Natsumi then realized the situation when Yoshino said that. She thought for a second and lightly placed her lips onto Shidou's.   "That's it! It's okay now right! That's counted as kiss right!?"  - Following Natsumi's lead, Miku also move her face near Shidou and kissed him. Before her lips leave Shidou's, Miku let out her tongue and licked Shidou's lips. Yoshino and Natsumi turned their face red at her actions.  "Ufufu… a kiss with darling, and an indirect kiss with Natsumi-san… what a good deal~" "What…!? Indirect kiss!? I don't…"  - Said to that, Natsumi then noticed something,  "Wait, eh? That means I also did indirect kiss with Yoshino…?"  - Natsumi turned her face red. Yoshino feel embarrassed at Natsumi's reaction. However, they can't continue their exchange of words for too long. Shidou broke the pipe that was restricting his body and continue moving forward, pushing &lt;Zadkiel&gt; out of the way.  - "Kya…!" Yoshino manipulated her &lt;Zadkiel&gt; to keep her balance. Miku stepped behind. Natsumi lie her face down to the ground once again.                                 Based Miku    Natsumi's so negative it's almost cute.  Almost. Yoshino best girl. Miku a psycholes.      INDIRECT KISSES EVERYWHERE!  So fucking gay  I love it       So shidou is just anout of control walking tank right now?    ALL THESE SPIRITS ARE FUCKING LESBIANS    All girls get a kiss   kiss count pretty much stays the same    what a useless volume      Natsumi is really useless     Tohka demands a kiss for each time he kisses one of the others.     If Shidou's not gonna do it, I would do it for free!    Well, we can't really change that now    what a Slut     implying         what a Jealous Slut   Fixed       Not true, these girls will be ahead of all the other new spirits.  Poor Kurumi getting BTFO      Kurumi gets the Dick though so it's good    Unfair    All the Kurumi clones will get to kiss him    Kurumi is too busy being chu2    Her own fault for being so difficult    she's too busy getting shit done and being best    She had her chance and refused it, and she's personally murdered the clones who've tried to take it (Utopia notwithstanding).    for then get hanged, sliced in halves, turned into ashes, frozen to death,etc,etc,etc  is hard to be a clone.      Kurumi is going to fail miserably though      but she will fail with style.    that clone can always come back  Star fest proved they never truly die      the fuck is with those arms    dem filthy hand    Sluts    They die, but it's possible for Kurumi to clone her clones if she's not careful. There's just the one that's problematic though.   She's going to go off worse than Origami.       Actually, it is more like they are all herself in a sense. They fuse back together when die. She even said she enjoyed being killed by Mana over and over, so she actually knows how it feels like.    Official "art" as always   Who in the fuck is Mio?   To hell and back     She's going to go off worse than Origami.   And it will be the most amazing thing ever  Inverse Kurumi when?         S2 is quality as fuck even in official art.     how dare they defile the Queen of darkness     Inverse Kurumi   Our dicks are not ready.       They never will be    What could an inverse Kurumi even do?Make clones of the people she sucked dry?   Three volumes from now. Next two will be Mio and dealing with the fallout of Isaac's dickery. After that Kurumi's going to try and timetravel to the First Spirit, only to pull her own Origami moment when she fails to travel back far enough.   I think there's going to be an entire second bunch of novels dedicated to bringing the Qliphoth Spirits in line.       make it so you were never even born     True time manipulation.     Rape you to death    Eternal night. Drain time from things other than humans. Add AoE effects to her weapons. Rapid fire. Shoot you so hard your grandfather dies of it fifty years ago.    1- she won't hold herself anymore, that means that she will try to use as much mana possible. 2- complete control over time. this could be mean that she would be able to re-write history as she pleases?  something I (we) havent seen yet is how Kurumi consumes her victims.       I would laugh if her personality becomes quite well mannered when she goes inverse    consuming their time, aging them?     oh yeah also each shadow is a potential deathly trap      something I (we) havent seen yet is how Kurumi consumes her victims.  Her clones pull them into the shadows and rip them limb from limb.   She's a goth loli right now. When she inverts she goes sweet.         What could an inverse Kurumi even do?     She's Tachibana's chuu2 creation. He's probably already thought of what ridiculous stuff she could do.    what I'm waiting for if she goes inverse is that her attitude is one of complete hatred. not just mindless rage as the others, complete control over her emotions and about her enviorment    Become A time lord    then why she doesn't try to age her rivals to the point they turn into dust?     New nep looks the Yami's put togther  The irony is that she herself  was split into two separate individuals just like the Yamai twins.  Only one of them is actually evil.         She is the only rank S threat non-inverse spirit. Inverse Kurumi is going to be insane.     Tachibana will probably have to nerf her just to give shido a chance     She can literally make plotholes to jump in     I want more interaction between her and Mana. They work pretty good unlike Kurumi and everyone else.    Shido? more like Tohka     Plothole Barrage   Retcon Bullet    Nerf Shoot       But shido is the one who ultimately must do the deed   Somehow I can see Shidou using Haniel to disguise himself as a Kurumi clone in Kurumi's sealing arc.   Answer this. who is the heroine? Shido obviously will seal her, but who will defeat her first?    I dunno man, these past volumes have been nothing but team work.     who is the heroine  Shiori.     Obviously Origami duh    Doesn't she have some kind of connection to her clones? She would be like "The f*ck? When turned a clone of mine into a male Kurumi?"    Looks like you haven't been reading DAL.    I like it. Natsumi pretends to be Shido as well.   Tohka and Origami. 10+1.       be always prepared for the worst.    I can't say I agree with you   Flatori a shit   White a cuet black a shet     Mana best imouto    Normalfag get out.   You mean Kotori.       "Looks like everyone who went ahead of us already succeed. Let's go too!" "I know."  - Kotori who covered herself in flames and Origami who covered herself with light are rushing through the sky pursuing Shidou. Shidou, who lost his conscious, is now like a disaster in human's form. He is a 'Spirit' by AST's definition. - However Kotori doesn't feel despair. Or rather, she even feel a strange upsurge of her emotions. Even though the situation is still desperate, the few percent chance to save Shidou is like a miracle to her. — Even though she don't feel like thanking &lt;Phantom&gt; for it. - Kotori snorted a little before calling Origami. "Origami! Ready!?" "Sure" Origami answered and glided to Shidou.   "—&lt;Metatron&gt;"  - Saying that, feathers then appeared above Origami's head like a crown. When Origami hold her hand, &lt;Metatron&gt; started breaking up. A light is released from each side of the crown to the ground. Origami didn't planned to hurt Shidou, only trying to block his ways.  - Shidou raise up his head at the attack and jumped into the sky. He then summoned &lt;Sandalphon&gt; and attacked Origami with it. "Origami!" Kotori raise up her voice. An attack from an Angel would be fatal for her who still don't regain her full Spirit Power. - However before &lt;Sandalphon&gt; could reach her, Origami's body turned into a light and disappeared. Next moment, she reappeared close in front of Shidou. Origami placed her hand on Shidou's cheek and pushed her lips onto his lips.  - Shidou shook his body a little. He then howled and swing his &lt;Sandalphon&gt;. Origami disappeared from in front of Shidou and reappear behind him. Kotori used that timing to close to Shidou. Shidou who saw Kotori coming swing &lt;Sandalphon&gt; releasing the wave of Spirit Power to Kotori's direction.                A body only a true pedophile could love    - Kotori evaded the Spirit Wave blade and thought Shidou's reaction is gradually changing. Back with Yamai sister, he was just a walking disaster. Then he become aggressive with Natsumi. And now he used an Angel to fight with his 'enemies'.  - Even though it means it's now harder to get close to him, it also means he is becoming more and more human. Kotori close to Shidou with both of her arms open trying to hug him. However, Shidou swing down his &lt;Sandalphon&gt;. - Kotori didn't evaded it. The blade cut her diagonally from her shoulder. The blood is gushing from her wound. "Kotori!" Origami called her name, but Kotori only hold her hand to stop her. Flames then started licking her wound, healing it.  - Even though her wound is already healing, that doesn't mean she don't feel pain. She thought this is good for her. The pain is her atonement for the fact that she were going to kill Shidou with her own hands.   "Onii-chan"  - Kotori hugged Shidou and push her lips toward his.   "I'll wait a bit more for an adult's kiss."  - Kotori smiled a little. Shidou raise up a voice and twisted his body to escape from Kotori. He then continue on his path.  "Only one left"  - Kotori placed her hand on her nearly healed-wound and moan in pain. The pain that were reduced by the upsurge of emotions and the excitement is now coming back to her. But only one left. Once the last person kissed Shidou, all the Path will opened up, and Shidou would return to normal. - Kotori looked at Shidou's direction with her dimmed eyes. In front of him, there is a beautiful princess in purple Astral Dress waiting for him standing her golden sword on the ground.                    lolicon*  Like Shidou.     posting best Origami     this neverending kissing assault  Poor guy      Your forced meme haven't been funny at all. I advise you to stop your shitposting. Killing yourself also works.    Best imouto.    That's mai waifu.     being this upset at a 2 year old meme   This post was so summer it gave me a tan.      Soon.    Go for the finisher   Retard for the win!    Implying 2 years when you only kept forcing it as a meme in this year of this current month  Anon pls.     Feel the autism flowing inside you, use that power to claim what is yours!    Someone needs to learn how to check the archive.   Where the fuck is AST? Did DEM call them off?   Light, Fire, and Sword are the final ones to regain their power. Yeah if my earlier hypothesis of Shidou's true angel being Uriel is correct, this definitely confirms it. Shidou's innate element is lightning, his Angel taking the form of a Sword that can channel innately Fire and light and Armor befitting that of God itself.    Uriel for the Sephirot and Chorozon for the Qliphoth, right?     Meme - forced repeated stockphrase over and over again   Not meme - your seldom normalfag nickname usage intended for negativism   Kill yourself already.     golden sword?   Still upset Penguin is best sister and flat a cunt?    Yup. Makes sense with his character too, having the knowledge within himself in order to solve and grant salvation to the spirit's problems with the world and all of them congregating around him, as the Angels that flock to God. He who guards the gate to Eden, hence why I think that Rinne's guardians under their veils probably look like Shidou underneath.     Going for u mad after getting refuted  Typical shitposting Manafag.      Rinne's guardians under their veils probably look like Shidou  Oh, that's a good one, never even thought of that.     Mana is delicious though    Are you literally retarded? He himself said it was a meme. That's not the issue retard, it's not some new meme he's forcing, it's one that's literally 2 years old.  Lurk the fuck more.       Get a good scanner.      It's a meme because I made it and used it like a clever nick!  Memes doesn't work that way, newfag. Also, you don't need to get a new ip to samefag.      He won't have a real angel. He's something else.      I don't get it     If you weren't mad you wouldn't have posted. Stay rustled newfriend.    Finally. So Kotori is second to last. I can see the order of importance she has and I'm okay with it. I remember the author once said that Kotori had the possibility of being the main heroine in one of the concept settings. How I wish ;_;   I want to explore Yoshino's tender anus with my turgid manhood.   If you think about it, the powers that Rinne had access to at the time of her birth was Fire, Sword, Light, and Water. Water power is established in this story as more of a defensive power so the only remaining powers that are more suited to offense would be Fire, Sword, and Light, the Canon Angel in real life has those powers alongside that of lightning.  The only thing we are shown in regards to his abilities is that the only weapon Angel he summons is that of Tohka's, which is a Sword. The other Angels are manifested as abilities only. The first 3 spirits we meet are Kotori, Origami, and Tohka who are respectively Fire, Light, and Sword and we know that he can use lightning as his own innate aside from the spirit powers sealed within him. Da'at is sometimes counted as an unofficial Sephira that isn't revealed until all of the others are revealed. And we know what they intend to do with Shidou once he seals all of the spirits is to extract that energy and turn it into a Sephira crystal, which are said to hold Angels inside of them. And like the Angel Mythology, sometimes Uriel itself is discounted as one of the Angels. Makes perfect sense that an Angel like that would be Shidou's Angel.      Shut the fuck up    White, okay Black, fuck no.     If you remove Tohka, Kotori would be the main girl. Right now, Kotori is the heroine that upholds the thematic date/war plot of the series, so she's pretty much like the second main girl in the story.   Origami a shit.   Faggot    She's begging for it     True.. but I still feel if you remove Origami's kind of comical role she could be right up there too     Origami has the most screentime after Tohka, and is involved in way more events. Kotori's tied with Kurumi in the second sphere, they're both ultimately support characters.    That's common sense thought because those are the only 3 girls that have been around since volume 1. In other words, the whole series.    Agreed      Well, she was pretty much the MC of this volume. She was the one moving the plot forward.    Ehh, I'm sure Origami is actually a bit below Kotori in terms of role and importance. Tohka, Kotori, and Origami are pretty much the central heroines.   Eternal reminder that Mana&gt;Kotori   I miss you 2013    Pretty much. Other girls sides Mana are for pandering. Mana and Kurumi on the other hand are more like the major players in the plot.    You missed the part where those two pander to people with horrible taste.    Mana will never be as good. and she will NEVER be an imouto   Poor Team Rocket. They never won.   Thank god   Main Harem girls  Tohko   Yoshino   Pending sealing to be added to main Harem  Kurumi   Main Sisterzone (Didn't die!)  Kotori   Dead Sisterzone (Is she dead?

TL seems to be slow today, he's probably just busy doing things.   I know you're masturbating, stop that and keep TLing       I try to finish each girl's part in one go this time. That's why it's taking longer.    No worries    I think for the sake of hype I'd rather you post each part instead of all at once    I thought so, no problem then    So wait, Tohka's part is that long? Wow, main character much.   Need more Shiori   no problem man, you're doing god's work making the summary.    Fucking Retards, man    - Tohka slowly opened her eyes after she feel Shidou coming near from the sound of trees collapsing, of Spirit Power and his howling. Tohka hold her &lt;Sandalphon&gt; with its point aiming to Shidou.  - Shidou who is also holding &lt;Sandalphon&gt; in his hand appeared while breathing a steam from his mouth with Spirit Power whirled around him. When he saw Tohka blocking his way, he ready his actions and swing his &lt;Sandalphon&gt; to her. - Tohka swished off that attack and ran close to Shidou. Two &lt;Sandalphon&gt;s strike each other, sparked Spirit Power around the surroundings.  - Every time both swords strikes, an impact is released to the surrounding and Tohka's feet sink down to the ground. Tohka never thought Shidou could keep up with her in a sword fight. Even though Shidou right now is Shidou, he is not exactly Shidou. - Tohka swing up her &lt;Sandalphon&gt; with all her might. &lt;Sandalphon&gt; in Shidou's hand is thrown to the sky then dissolved into light and disappeared. Even though Tohka right now is no match for Shidou for Spirit Power, her skill is far ahead of Shidou.   "Shido — I'm saving you now."  - Tohka nodded and close to Shidou. She placed her hand on Shidou's chin and move her face toward his. However that moment,   "…! Gu… ah…!?"  - Tohka feel a pain in her chest. She raise up a painful voice while holding her chest. "T-This is…" Tohka's &lt;Sandalphon&gt; and her Limited Astral Dress then disappeared. Tohka is ran out of her Spirit Power.  - That moment, she feel a strong force being pushed onto her body. Tohka is now directly exposed to the Spirit Power from Shidou's body.   "Ku—" "——"                     No shit      Tohka is a Tohka.    rip Tohka    - Shidou wave his hand. With just that, Tohka is blown away striking her back to the tree. Her conscious is dimming. Tohka feel the pain from throughout her body.   "Tohka!" "Tohka-san…!"  - Tohka heard Kotori and other Spirits' voices from the sky. However, before they could use their Angel to help Tohka, she raise up her voice.  "— Wait a minute!" "…!? What is it, Tohka!" "Please… don't help me. I feel this is something I have to do myself." "Tohka…"  - Tohka said in a calm voice. Kotori raise her hand and stopped everyone. Tohka thanked her with her eyesight and looked at Shidou's direction. Shidou is twisting his body while howling. Even though everyone else already opened the Path, right now Shidou still has the most of their powers. - Tohka walk to Shidou with her pained body. Her sight is already dimmed, her conscious is vague, there's nowhere in her body that she doesn't feel the pain. However, Tohka can't miss the last chance everyone made for her.  - The Spirit Power that whirled around Shidou increased its intensity as if it is trying to refuse Tohka. Tohka feel like she jumped into a sea of sulfuric acid with her body. The invisible power licked over her body, leaving only the pain that almost make her conscious to go off.  "Shido… so you always fought… while feeling this pain…?"  - Tohka let out her voice. Even though Shidou have Kotori's regeneration power, he is still a human with normal sense of pain. Tohka painfully realized for the first time how Shidou must feel when he encounter with Spirits and Wizards without Astral Dress.                      RETARD    - However, Shidou didn't gave up. No matter how many times he feel the pain, no matter how many times he was beaten down, Shidou always stood up. In order to save Tohka and other Spirits. - Tohka don't know the reason why Shidou was doing that much to save Spirits. It's unreasonable that Shidou must end his life here.   No, "……I"  - Tohka mumbled to herself. Even though Tohka is indebted to Shidou, that she can't return it even if she used up her whole life. And it's wrong for someone as kind as Shidou to not be saved.  - However, the reason Tohka is moving forward is not only that. Tohka would already have stopped mid-way if this was due to feeling indebted to him or due to her principle. But inside her, there is a feeling that won't let she gave up no matter the hardship it is.  "— Ah, I see."  - Tohka realized that for the first time at the end of her painful road. Even though she heard about it several times, this is the first time that matched up with the feeling inside her.  This is — 'love'.  - The kind love that is different than what she have for Kotori or Yoshino or others. Tohka loves Shidou. With her big crush on him, that's why she want to save him.  "— Shido"  - Tohka called his name and took his tie. Tohka pulled Shidou toward herself — and kissed him.   "——"  - Tohka feel her body is getting hot. The Spirit Power that whirled around Shidou popped and diffused to his surroundings. Not before long, Shidou's breath that were like a beast earlier gradually calming down, losing his strength. Once the light came back to Shidou's eyes, Shidou then shook after realized that Tohka is kissing him.   "…!? T-Tohka!? What are you doing…!?"  - The usual voice, and the usual reaction. — Shidou that Tohka loves still standing there. Tohka loosen her lips with relief and let out a small voice,  "I won't tell you. Baka… Baka"  - Tohka said that and lean herself toward Shidou, loosening her strength.    Next: Epilogue                                       Yay good job baka     Fuck you, she isn't.    being told your stupid by a retard    Which is the bigger win, saving Shido or realizing she's in love?    Adorable.    FINALLY. Of course it's love bwaaaka.    Tohka is a cute. Best girl    Retard finally understands what love is    cute retard yes, best girl no     That's actually real cute. I won't lie  Still team Kurumi!      Not much happened this volume.   YES   Another shitty volume where only 1 chapter was good and the rest is fanservice full of the same shit. Tachibana kill this shit already you can't milk DAL anymore.   and that's what I was waiting for, thanks anon. Are you doing the epilogue tonight?  Oh come now, it wasn't particularly bad at all       Are you doing the epilogue tonight  Doing!     Cool, thanks again!    Am I the only one who feels Tohka's dumbness is forced? Tohka honestly isn't a decently written main girl and love interest.    Anon, send me your adress. I'm going to visit your house, take you out on a date then give you the best orgasm you ever had.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127179999   deleting quads     count me in.    Why is her dumbness forced? It's the perfect set up for a character who came to the world with no prior knowledge and experienced everything for the first time. And she's still learning.     Haha, time for Elliot to be cool.   Forced... no, but it comes up a lot. Other series with similar characters have them integrate quickly. Hell, even Yoshino is basically adapted. Not so much Tohka, and it comes up a lot.  It's a pretty decent (if basic) portrayal of culture shock.         exactly why shes know as a retard    Nah, only Miku.  Miku a shit.      Ehh I think it's kept to retain her original baka character. But there's still been a lot of development with her. To be perfectly honest it's probably important to remember that it has NOT even been one year in DAL. They're still just a few months in, with that into consideration, Tohka's made massive strides actually.    Natsumi wants to go full Miku on Yoshino    Natsumi and Miku confirmed for shitty lesbians.    It's December now, isn't it? Means it's been eight months.      It's okay if it's a loli.  Lolis a best. A BEST.         Thing is, her dumbness comes off pretty convenient when the plot needs it. Kinda like how it's only recently Tohka learned how Shidou seals other Spirits. Despite being the main girl and getting the most screentime, she's in the dark a lot. Since she comes off like the non-serious type because of her clueless disposition, it's hard to take her seriously even in serious scenes. But the main problem is how she is written. I don't know, it's like her development turns off and on like a switch rather than gradual build up.     That seems highly unlikely with how many volumes we've had but if I think about it.. Tohka was sealed in April, The whole twins sealing arc was clearly around summer. Natsumi was around fall/halloween, and this one said December???   That's a really fucking slow timeline for 12 volumes actually        Miss them.     I bet they have a cute shota they keep enslaved to satisfy their sexual urges.    Want something even slower? Hayate the Combat Butler.  Having a slow flow of time is really normal.      I think the biggest issue is her being dim about how Shidou seals them. He's done it with her more then once and each time he kissed her. I'll need to double check but wasn't she right there when he sealed Origami? This is basic 2+2 stuff   So what's the Kiss count?   Well no one ever told her about the sealing methods, plus Shidou agreed to only kiss her (a lie!) so I could see the confusion. They leave her in the dark, and many other spirits because it's best to not get them worked up over things. I actually don't really see any problems in her development, so much as a problem is the actual writing of the series itself. The series HAS to give the new girl in the volume the main development/arc, so it's be pretty impossible to constantly have it just being Tohka, yet she still needs to develop as a character, so often it comes in situations like these where she's needed. It's really the harem formula that kind of throws it off in my opinion, but like I said, I dont have a problem with it, it's moderation for everyone. For her to be done better, you'd need a lot more of her    That's character development for you. It's a bit worse than normal since there are paired volumes, but without major timeskips you're better off showing character development in response to major events and realizations. Like, what in particular bothers you about Tohka? Because I'm on the opposite side of the equation, I'm irritated by how easily she slid into normal life when she and Yoshino have the least humanizing contact of anyone not named Kurumi.    Tohka: 4 Kotori: 3 Most everyone else: 2      post the the other part with fatty Tohka    Yoshino is 3 if I remember correctly. She wasn't sealed during the first time though.    Ah yeah, that'd do it. Can't really justify that one, I always thought Yoshino's book settled the issue.   Pretty sure Yoshino is also at 3.        Yeah she is at 3, but no seal with the first kiss though.     You'd be surprised. Soon enough we'll be hitting one year though  I actually think she's been written quite well considering limitations. I know people like to complain she's always around but I'd say DAL lately has been very balanced. For it being a harem series she still feels like a main heroine despite every girl having importance and an arc. and she feels different than she did at the start which is also good.  Yoshino is indeed 3        Yoshino is 3      It's not clear how much contact Yoshino had as she seems to be able to cross quitely and no one knew it as Kotori was shocked Shidou had met her before. She didn't flee from Shidou when they first met either    The other girls feels consistent. It's probably because they aren't...well, dumb, so they can go with the flow and pick things up. Tohka is like a feral child-like characters, so she needs special development to let her grow and development. This series doesn't do that. Tohka doesn't understand many of human's concept and common sense, especially of things like love. The story doesn't delve much into making her gradually learn it, but instead just drop a love bomb on her and then just say she now starts to get it for no reason. Basically, she doesn't go through the stages and inner conflicts of learning to deal with her emotions that should be new and something that takes time to grasp. That's how I see it, anyways.   Basically the above.   I know few main girls with similar premise as being ignorant about the world and eventually learn about love etc. The baka type of that isn't something that's done often at all, so in a way it feels different. But the writing is a lot to be desired here.          Epilogue: "The Second" Who Has Been Released  - In the forest far away from the town, a flame lighten up the night sky. It is not a dead tree nor a bonfire that is burning up, but rather a fuel of large transportation plane.   "— Ara, ara"  - In that flame, a girl appeared from a shadow on the ground.   "And you crashed like this when I was waiting in front of DEM's facility."  - Kurumi picked up a small piece from plane cabin and raise up her right hand, summoning her pistol gun from the shadow. "&lt;Zafkiel&gt; — [Yud]" Kurumi called and the bullet is charged into the pistol.  - Kurumi pulled the trigger. The bullet pierce through the piece from the plane into her head. Kurumi then saw an image of the transportation plane flying in the sky. Then an alarm rang. 'Material A' shook the plane like a fetus. - Reaction of mysterious Spirit Power that resonates with her came up and becoming stronger and stronger. The next moment, a ray of light is released from the mysterious facility from ahead of plane's course.   "…I see, so the direct cause of this is Shidou-san."  - Kurumi chuckled. She heard about Shidou's condition from her clones but she didn't thought that he would involved in it this way.                     I'm not certain though to throw Tohka another one(not out of bias) because of one short story where they were both locked in the gym's storage shed by accident and before Shidou was knocked unconscious, his lips touched something soft.     "The second Spirit-san found Shidou-san's Spirit Wave from inside the plane and looked for his help… I guess? But if Shidou-san's power went berserk out of that, she sure have caused Kotori-san and others a lot of troubles."  - Kurumi thought there's no use saying that to the Spirit who's locked inside the container. There's no use picking faults with someone looking for help.   "Either way — seems like I've unexpectedly been helped by Shidou-san."  - Kurumi stepped toward the back of the plane. Kurumi did put her clones at all DEM major facility where she thought the transportation plane might arrive. Even if the plane didn't crashed, she would still have the second Spirit. Even though that means she have to sacrifice a lot of her clones.  - Kurumi is thankful that she don't have to make any sacrifice. Because her objective is not only the second Spirit, but also to get the information about the first Spirit from her and to defeat it. The more manpower she could reserve, the better.  "— Well then, Spirit-san? Please let me see your face."  - Kurumi said while peeking into the container that dropped out of the transportation plane. However,  "Ara?"  <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127162307#p127181281">Click here</a> to view the full text.                    No, fuck off    mmm I don't think I agree Simply because they've already kind of done a bit, short stories like Tohka fearful and Tohka gamecenter highlighted that. Her understanding of feelings in volume 2 was probably the most internal conflict she's had in the whole series. And it's surfacing a bit still, and a few small examples throughout the series, like I said you'd need to give her a lot more focus in order to give better development.    oh shit        So, what's the result of Shidou and spirits sharing power now?  Find out in the next volume!     Ok is the term they are useing second as in order or as in the number 2?   Does Lum count as yandere?  Also why doesn't Ataru just politely ask her to stop electrocuting him when she "displays her love"?     She'll stop when he stops hitting on other girls.   Never.      I don't think so. Jealous as she can get, she's not deranged. She's on good terms with most of the other female characters as well.  I'd say the closest thing to a yandere in the series is actually Lum's friend, Ran. She will actually try to eliminate people getting in-between her and Rei.    Maybe really early on when she's fangier and trying to murder Shinobu.  They're displays of affection, that would be like leaning in for a kiss and being refused. She'd cry, he'd feel like a heel, then she'd fry him anyway out of anger.    Yangire.   I don't recall her trying to outright murder Shinobu. Just doing shit like monitoring his phone calls, refusing to let him see Shinobu, locking him in the house, following him, etc.   Actually, that all still sounds pretty bad.      Ran is the yandere.  Lum is deredere.     What about that episode where Ataru tries to end the triangle by picking Shinobu and she tries to murder him so they can have a lover's suicide?   Is Urusei Yatsura literally Cuck: The Anime?   I think that may have been in the very same episode I was talking about, but I forget which one it is specifically.    No.    No more than every Takahashi show with thirty intersecting love triangles.     implying ataru won't still chase other girls    The whole reason Lum is in the show is because she cucked Shinobu, while also cucking Rei, then Ataru continued to cuck Lum.  No RT show was so heavily based on NTR.         Shit, you might be on to something. Everything is second loves in UY, the cucks-per-minute might be much higher than is first apparent.    No.    Honestly, I just look at it like this. They're normal teenagers for the most part. They're going to fall in out and out of love a lot of times before settling. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.   I really wish /tv/ had not cracked open a dictionary and learned a funny new word.       I thought it was /pol/    I'm going to be perfectly honest with you: I don't understand what you mean when you use the word 'cuck' here.    Probably. They have a tendency to weed themselves into other boards.    That's because it's not the right word to use anyway.    That's when Lum was supposed to be a one off alien bitch. In the first few manga chapters, Lum was supposed to be gone by chapter two. But due to her popularity, she was brought back as the 'antagonist'. Then more people liked her, and Rumiko made Lum the focus and softened her features. Early Lum had more visible fangs, makeup, and openly tried to kill people. She was cruel to all other women. But when Lum became a fan favorite, she became Shinobu's best female friend.     The original idea for Urusei Yatsura was to have a new alien every chapter.    Between Lum's introduction and her absence in chapter two with the taxi driving alien, Lum gained a following.   this following was parodied in the manga chapter 3, creating the Lum storm troopers.    Lum never cucked Shinobu. Shinobu openly hated Ataru and didn't really want to marry him. She only 'fought' for Ataru cause she thought Lum was a whore. She instantly forgot Moroboshi's existence when Mendou came. Now go back to /tv/ with that cuck bullshit.         She doest hate him, she had to give up because she knew she couldn't win.    Reminder that Rumiko wanted Shinobu to win, therefore it's canon.    If she wanted that, why'd she change it to Lum? If anything, Rumiko fucked Shinobu over.  Well, she can't win against Lum.   Let's give her Mendou.   Lol nope.   She gets the furfag.         What are you talking about? Ataru and Shinobu were clearly in a relationship in episode 1.    They were dating.    Because the publishers demanded it. Do your research, everyone knows this.     Should have made Shinobu better than lum then, instead of having her be so boring.     Then it's not canon anymore. Since Lum won. Here's proof.   That's dating? Threatening to kill Ataru and force him to play tag by offering her hand in marriage is dating?      At least Shinobu didn't go dangerously cheesy.    At least Rumiko didn't make her fall for the fucking lip monster that chases her.    Should have been three boys like in the anime.    That's a pattern of breakups and reconciliations that's lasted ten years. Whatever else Ataru and Shinobu were, they'd also been friends since preschool.    Why don't more anime couples have sons?  I swear to fucking god, every single one that's ever existed has only ever had one daughter.      Because despite what faggots might say little girls are cute than little boys.     Lum was supposed to be gone by chapter two.  Oh fuck, really? Lum is easily the most well known character and liked from the series. I can't even imagine it without her.     Not the point.    Every otaku would rather have a daughteru than a son and otaku are the target audience. Better?    Not every single person that reads and buys these type of manga self inserts friend, or is so similar that they would all want the same thing despite what you've read on /a/    I think Lum won too, but that's fanart.    Well yes, I didn't mean to speak for everyone just saying that there are numerous daughteru threads and no son threads, whatever the fuck you wanna call it they didn't even invent a word for it because the demand does not exist.      otaku are the target audience   Urusei Yatsura was from before otaku ruined anime forever.      I seriously hope you aren't basing your opinions solely on what you see on /a/   Seperate thread for this Son/Daughter business:    I'm genuinely curious though. Is there a single example besides the TV version of Urusei Yatsura?        Urusei Yatsura was from before otaku ruined anime forever.  I don't think you're completely aware of what you're saying.     I am perfectly aware of what I said. I was just being facetious.  Urusei Yatsura was made by otaku.        Mendou is like Ataru except with money, looks, and crippling phobias.    To be honest, I wish Shinobu had ended up with  Ryuunosuke.     I wouldn't think so.    I don't think her dislike of him really came out in full force until after she decided to pursue Mendou instead.  But it's impossible to forget Ataru because he won't fuck off no matter how many times you tell him no or crush him with desks.      The only thing she dislikes about him is his fickle and flirtatious ways, she still wants to be friends with him but not date him because he has Lum now. She only hits him because he comes trying to flirt when he's in a relation ship.     Good thing people smarter then her were in charge of that decision.     Then even later after everybody's character is really nailed down she's still employing mind-control and blackmail, everything she tries to feed him is toxic, she's just fucking delighted if he's injured on her behalf, okay you know what maybe. It's not yan on the order of wanting to wear his skin, but still.   I thought this was suppose to be a comedy.  ;_;   I love Lum but Ataru is the true reason UY is so great.   I can agree on that.  Honestly, I like that Ataru, Lum, Shinobu, and Mendou can all be really vicious to each other but still do a lot of stuff together as friends.      It's okay anon. She got her wish in the end.    She wants him to openly admit he loves her which he is adamant about not doing when she asks because he thinks it wouldn't be genuine, he does show he loves her though as times like in your pic when he takes the punch instead of letting her get hit. He's almost fucking invincible though so people hardly worry about him actually injuring himself. She has been shown to be pretty absent minded so many of her schemes start off with the best of intentions then go badly and it's also why she tries feeding him stuff that are enjoyable to aliens but bad for humans. He actively tries to flirt with other women though so it's not like he doesn't have it coming when she tries to get him to do the same with her when they both know they love each other, so she's not yandere unless every girl in the series is also the yandere because they all act the same when the one they love flirts with another.    Lum is such a qt3.14   Why does this show have better animation than anything Trigger's ever done despite being 35 years old?   Because Trigger is shit.  Actually, Little Witch Academia looks pretty good. Although it'd probably look a lot worse if it had been a TV series.      What's going on here? Time for more Yurus!    best yuru    Why does she wear the buns?     yuru yuri is fantastic but i think the threads could use a break since there hasnt been anything new for ages unless theres a new chapter im not aware of      Wannabe general threads should fuck off.    I lacked presence until I put on the buns    Silly anon, we yuru yuri lovers don't do generals   I want to rewatch another episode of this, but I don't know what episode should I watch. What's the best episode you can think of /a/? (Besides the time travel ep, already saw it)   just watch all of them you dingus    b-but my backlog is huge enough as it is.    mine is too, but we have to accept that it'll never get smaller. follow your heart and rewatch stuff if you want to.    Making daily threads about a show with no new content. Could have fooled me /yyg/. You guys are a general in all but name. Kinda sad really.    wake up   see this right in your face   What do?      Stop making generals for a series without currently content.   The handful of regulars that bump this thread just to keep it alive should create a channel for the discussion and have a little more respect for the board. http://www.rizon.net/        without currently content   The manga is ongoing, dumbass. Get your facts straight before you embarrass yourself next time.       He's saying that no new (translated) chapter was released. OP should at least attempt to start a discussion, not a general.  I don't get how this is so hard to follow. It's like post-S2 again.     Yeah, I mean, come on. There's two OVAs coming before the new season. At least make it related.  And there's this, that's using the anime designs, which is cute. Feels like forever since any news, though.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127155363  Sounds like you're the one bitching instead.  Also, mods haven't deleted these generals because they've been tolerating them, not because they're quality threads. You'd know this if you weren't such an oldfag simply because you joined after the OVA.     Jesus tapdancing Christ, this is why we can't have nice things. I come here to get a laugh, not listen to you asshats bitch about proper posting etiquette.    Honestly? If you bitch about something, some other idiot is going to bitch back at you. I'm not going to pick a side, but don't try to be coy about it. And don't try to act like YrYr's threads are the only "Generals" up in /a/ right now either.      We could have had a pleasant thread, OP. We could have had nice things. But you chose not to post any Yurus in your image.   Now Kyouko is crying. I hope you're all happy. ;_;       If you don't want people to bitch, start by not creating shit threads.   Quality thread, gentlemen.     one of the cutest    Part of me wants to believe that this is just a cute Chitose cover, and not some nefarious subliminal shiptease. But I know better.     The manga is ongoing, dumbass  So make a thread when a new chapter is actually released. It isn't hard. These generals aren't discussing anything about the show anymore.    If you don't like how the site is supposed to function, find an IRC where you and the other ten regulars can ERP together.         And don't try to act like YrYr's threads are the only "Generals" up in /a/ right now either.  It isn't. That doesn't make it right. If you think those other threads aren't being reported you have another thing coming.   Two wrongs don't make a right.       If you don't like it, fuck off  Wow simple      You can't ignore the truth!    It's literally one-sided. Ayano doesn't even think of gran-chan that way.    When she loses the Kyoukobowl, she'll stop being so blind Just like how China will finally admit her love for Akari when she loses the Yuibowl    I want to hug Yui!   Welcome back!    Thanks! I love you anon-chan!    Whose birthday it is?    Well, recently it was Namori's, before that Nana's, and Himawari's. Maybe that anon can't read.     I know I know, I just like Sakurako on this pic.      I like Sakurako in all pics. Except for the ones that delve into weird fetish material.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127163471    K     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127163471  See you later.    Why is sakurako the best yuru?    Vampiric hypnosis   Which one would you?   neither. i'm into older women but not THAT old      both       <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127155046     ok I think the ass blasters are gone so now lets enjoy our Yurus our way        Ok, Kyouko wins a all paid vacation to anywhere she wants. However, she can only bring two friends.Who does she bring? and where does she go?   Ayano and Yui.   Anywhere, I don't care.       Quads must tell the truth     Who does she bring? and where does she go?   Easy. Chinatsu and Yui, Akari will join them regardless, because Akarin.  She would probably go somewhere really close, but take several trains and buses to get there.         From the catalog I thought this was a pregnancy checker    Obviously she brings Ayano and Yui.  She likes attention so would want to keep her dominant harem members close at hand.  She takes them somewhere that Ayano likes to make puns about, so that Yui can be cutely cracking up the whole time.        You think Himawari finally got knocked up by Sakurako? Her breasts have been looking unusually big...    She brings Kyouko and Kyouko, and goes to Comiket.    mom's spaghetti   If the yurus were in a band, who would play what instrument?   Akari would play  triangle.     Probably    what else would she play?      Kyouko: Guitar Yui: Bass Chinatsu: Costume design (she's aiming for cute, winds up with death metal) Akari: Triangle Ayano: Manager Chitose: Piano Brat: Drums Boob-chan: Shy lead singer           I could see it   Found this in my old screenshots today, Himawari sure has a big bush.     what the fuck      Indeed she is.    Because she can drink cocoa like an elegant adult        Drink Cocoa   Lewd.       My kisekae yurus were better, and edgier.     I bet they weren't.     Chizuru a cute. For some reason, Chitose a not so cute.  I think it's the eyes.      page 9  Chinaslug will slide us back to page 1     C-Chinafrog could have got us there faster. J-Just saying.     <br/>    Chitose is already cute, but Chizuru is extra cute because of gap moe.      not recognizing China Sue as uniquely beautiful    Don't judge a book by its cover, Anons.       best doujin  I was prepared for despair I really prepared myself for a sad as fuck ending   I was pleasantly surprised           no u       No words.     Well then guess I have something new to read. Is everything on bakkingamu site? I know they scanlated a few of them   Don't die while I'm sleeping, little thread.   if this thread is still here in the morning I'll be surprised   I want to cum inside tomato pajamas.     I will keep it up just for you anon. Sleep tight   What the fuck did I just watch    Admitting to browse 4chan   Holy shit  Indeed, who the fuck would do that irl?  You fucking know who.       no    Anybody else feel really uncomfortable at seeing girly Yuta? It looks like a creep crossdressing, even though I know she's a girl.    why not? i frequently go to school with my chen shirt    why not   ITT: Main girls who are also best girls  Obviously.    In celebration.     hahahaha, fuck no.    She's a tsundere, that's literally everything I need to know to decide she's worst girl.     Ellen   best anything  You'd have to remove pretty much every other girl for that to happen.         Most of them      main girl         Hell no. As insipid as Onodera.    Too flat. Too bitchy.     THK pls go.       Wrong from the get go.      NO    I didn't even noticed OP's girl. But this so much.    KILL YOURSELF      Well, enjoy being a pleb with pleb-taste. But Louise a shit.    Anon, this is a best girl thread not worst girl thread.    Why?    Autism   Ryuko    Main girls who are also best girls  Misaka pls      I could shoot her full of my DNA thousands of times and still never get enough.     Incorrect.      anyone else notice the water image is speaking and she is not?   too spooky for me!      she a cutie    Which one?       Not loving perflat   Implying loving senpai kuudere is in anyway bitchy  Cut yourself.      i see there is a bro here with superior taste. i congratulate thee!    Retard.   Neorigami best.            the best girl   Mein comrade.   Alright boyos here I go   FTFY     Don't forget me         Kill yourself      You got it.     Dude she's like  -2 years old .         Mikoto is only the main girl in Railgun and she isn't even best girl in there.        Too bad she lost.    Yuckyno a shit.    Normally I like tsunderes, but this is like 95% abusive tsun with 5% dere    Age has nothing to do with best girl status.       No      tripfag scum          Literally barf   Yeah oh well, Yuki is still cute as hell         There is so much wrong in this thread it's crazy.        my niggas         Yukino is utter perflation.      Can't expect much from tripfags.   Dejiko is the only right answer        THK is here  Of course you are.         WELCOME TO        Megumi a shit.       Eriri* a shit.     WELCOME TO    Best girl confirmed      How can you live with such shit taste?    And she got the kissu!   inb4 Hestiafags.   Can't believe I'm agreeing with you here.     Inb4 Shinkafags   MC agrees, don't bother him about it. She blew the competition out so easily.    AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  holy shit no          Eriri a shit.  FTFY      WELCOME TO MY HOUSE      Claire is the main girl and she is best. Est and Restia are second best though.    Restia isn't best.  Only one girl is bEst.        I came to made sure Louise got posted, and I am pleased.    Railgun is best Railgun.    That's wrong you fucking retard.     Claire   best   Said no one ever.       tittiko pls    you sir, have a good taste     houki i know everyone agrees    Fight me nerdlord   Why would you be surprised?         Both of you are wrong. Ranmaru is the best and most perfect girl.      There are better girls in the manga.      She has been more popular than the other main girls not Est and Restia in latest poll. Stay salty.     Shiina and not Aoyama     Shitmeragi   Tripfags being scum with shit taste as always.         Second best.  Real best girl is here.      does she even have competition?      I want to marry Yukina and have her birth me a daughter.   She hardly has competition.  Mai waifu related.    Well I like Nora the most but I know I'm pretty much alone on that. So I try to keep that to myself as much as possible.      Kazusa a shit. Setsuna did nothing wrong.    99% of them. Side character girls are always just fluff shit that people with terrible taste want   yes, a blonde and a bitch from the initial town...  but talking about the anime world, she don't      Wrong.      I thought the reflection wasn't opening her mouth, but grimacing. Reflecting (c wat i did thar?) her innermost feelings that she refuses to show.    Setsuna is a literal cuck.          Reminder that loli Misaki was best Misaki and best loli.    who needs competition when she's already best girl.    Steph &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shitty loli   obvious choice, you're a faggot if you say otherwise    Satone a shit. A SHIT.    Retarded and useless cow over cute and awesome loli     even deko's better than your image    ANY Misaki           literal rotten whore   best anything   Best girl Wanko won anyway.      FOREVER BEST   She isn't the main girl, but I agree nonetheless.  Same artist, so you reminded me of Aika.       Mero &gt; Rea &gt; Wanko       No she didn't. Those were Mero's grand kids in the epilogue. Wanko literally got rejected. The last line in the manga was that Rea and Chihiro would be together until her body withers away. Also further contribution.          both of them    Rea fags in denial so hard    But Yuckyno a shit.    What possible reason could you have for thinking Wanko won?  If it's the kids in the epilogue, one looks exactly like black haired Mero and the other looks like Chihiro with Mero's hair color. If it's not that, then what?      There can only be one.      Fuck you Seo     This one.     She's cute, dude. Let's not be gay.  Is a 3some ending out of the question?      Not the main girl in Index and not even the best girl in Railgun.    You mean Wanko with Chihiro's hair color &amp; chibi Chihiro with Wanko hair color. Mero didn't know shit and was all but nonexistant near the end. Shit was explained multiple times to Rea fags. They just don't want to hear that shit.          What does Mero not being present in the closing chapters have to do with the fact that the kid literally had a pony tailed version of her hair style and a similar face/expression? What reason do you have for thinking Wanko "won"?     Best Railgun for sure.    This. I still can't believe how great she was.  Also, contributing with Rokka from Youkai Shoujo.        Wanko didn't won. Wankofags are just delusional about this.    A. SHIT.    Let me guess. You're the one that said he would make up his own headcanon last time this was discussed.     the harem ending     I'm not, actually. I'm not trying to be facetious. I really want to know what reason/evidence there is for thinking Wanko won. If it's plainly stated somewhere that she did, I'll accept it, but I loved this manga and re-read those last few chapters plenty of times waiting for the prolonged updates, and I can't recall anything that hints at that conclusion.        Dude no.     FUCKING SLUT    I want to marry her.      Get in line motherfucker   There's only one girl for this beta male.     I love how she kept changing up her hairstyle    You have got to be trolling. Out of all the girls, you pick the absolute worst? She's so boring, bland, has no personality, and has god awful design. The megane makes her even worse. Mina makes Kosaki a great and fun girl by comparison. She's that bad.    That's not Monkey.    She's perfect.      She's not best girl in her own spin-off. How pathetic can she be?    Even though she went on the far side of the moeblob line a couple times     tfw aoi will never make fun of your outfit    ZERO contest.    Implying  Get off the internet, Misaki.              I'm not sure if I'm amused by your shit taste or horrified that you're actually serious             She can be forgiven.   you will never massage Aoi in your marital bed after she had to work a long shift      I usually hate tsundere but she's actually a likable one which baffles me. The others don't stand a chance. Truly a best.       Does smug-chan even have any competition?     I am in fact not trolling and disagree with everything you said.      Implying Saten is not the best thing in Railgun         Is that Griffith from the water fight scene?       How can there be a "best girl" in a non-romance show?              I wasn't aware this was a worst girl thread             When she's so perfect that you don't need romantic context to want to make her your waifu for laifu.    Orihime &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shit &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rukia    It just werks ok   Waifu related       my nigga      FUCK OFF    No.    Can't argue with that    kill yourself   As if Ranka was ever a competition.  Alto-hime is 2nd best girl     -10/10        Fuck off, chico a best.    How can perfection possibly have competition? Holo is love, Holo is life.      I'm inclined to believe she is also best Kyoani girl... is this my autism showing?    Is this nigga serious? Merry is undeniably the best by far. How the hell can anyone say otherwise?    This. Tomoyo a shit.    are you having a fuckin giggle     Worst Inou  Hatoko a shit.     No. And she isn't even the main girl.       The Original Mai-Waifu   Objectively wrong.   Endless Paradox &gt; all. Also OTP.        i think i like you mate    No.    Remove yourself from this earth. Now.     that small as fuck right hand       No      What a shit man you are.     main   are you retarded?      That was so cancerous that the cancer spread to her creator.   I'm going to post this everyday until you like it.   Sakurafish, you're back!   Hey, I'm starting to like this!  Sakurafish, have you accepted naruto threads on /a/?   I really, really like this picture. May I save it?    Took you long enough, I missed you!   bbbbbbb   Can you make a higher quality version of this, Sakurafish? I know it will be effort, but if we're going to spend the next few years together, eye candy would be pleasant.    You can have this but I will post what I post now.    Do you have it in PNG?      I HATE IT!  W-welcome back        Can't find it, Sorry m8    he's back! i still hate it!    but i missed you       I love it again! :D  But you didn't post it yesterday.    I think this is a biggest I got. There might be a vector of this somewhere...  oh, and welcome back!      you weren't here yesterday    Absent   But AngelFish and DevilFish were!     yeah, thanks   Try my hardest so you niggers will have your daily shitposting thread   No public thank you from Sakura  Okay...at least I have Rinko.    Loli haet imposter fishys!     That is mine, that thank you is mine. Do not steal.  There's no impostors, just 2 people have official authorization to post the fish and I only get to do it because I have a warehouse full of em.         Do not sexualize the Rinko, please.      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=X2P<wbr>1AArariA</wbr>  [ ]   I LOVE DENPA        I HATE IT and I hate you, AoG    But why?    No reason, really, just felt like it.   I'm going to post this whenever I happen to see this thread while I'm drunk.   I-it's not like I missed you or anything...     I'm glad you're back      6 fingers        You're probably my least favorite Fate girl, but your daily shitposting gives my /a/ browsing some sense of normalcy. So, I begrudgingly say  welcome back    I feel kind of insulted, I go for 60 days and no one cares but Sakura is gone for 3 and everyone loses their shit.   Take it boy.   <br/>   All fish are equal, but some fish are more equal than others.    ♂ＦＵＣＫ♂ＹＯＵ♂！     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ibQ<wbr>KvjT_dKg</wbr>  [ ] Average SakuraFish thread 2.   I like it.     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=NYw<wbr>Wuqhz-zw</wbr>  [ ]  Well thanks to Sakura becoming a homosexual in real life we are going to see a whole lot of gachimuchi going on from this day forth.     おやすニャン   Where does one acquire so much fish?    I appreciate your effort       <br/>   You buy them in bulk from a jewish carp.      Do you even Nagareboshi?      &gt;/pol/<span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;47016196   Even /pol/ likes it  So why don't you?       implying /pol/ is ever right     threesome date starts with 8man and Yukino staring into each other's eyes again, later 8man ditches Yui to go talk to Yukino   Yui gives 8man her chocolates and Yukino didn't. 8man stops her from giving up on the 8bowl   friendship end flags raised by threesome date and 8man's refusal to show romantic feelings for anyone     8man flirts with Iroha after mixing saliva   So basically flags were raised for every single ending. To top it all off he ended the volume on a cliffhanger instead of wrapping things up like he usually does. Why does Watari do this to us? Does he want us to suffer? Is this how he makes money, through our tears?       I want to kill this fucking cunt.   This is it, the end of the road. Our days in these threads are numbered now, anons. Guess I'll be seeing the brothers on future Iroha threads.           Yukino will win just go home.  Reminder that Yuckyno YukinoSHITa is objectively the worst girl.  Write a letter to Watari RIGHT NOW    I feel that Yui would be up for the rough stuff but Yukino would enjoy mutual oral sex.    Seriously hope Vol.12 isn't the last. I feel like there's still a lot more to be said.  So everybody overreacted to spoilers?  How much until "Good Irohasu!" post appear?   This is especially true because Watari loves giving needlessly long winded descriptions of 8man sitting places doing nothing.    Best mail all your sheckles to WW ASAP then    WHEN IS VOLUME 12 COMING FAGGOT?I'LL BUY THE DAMN LN.   [x] SEND DICK PICS   Dear Watari,  Please don't miss your deadlines and end up having to write 11.5  Also Japan is ready for a 3P end. You know it's the only correct option.        Don't jinx it.    I'll miss you captain, I'm guessing you'll just be lurking in the future LN threads?   Good Irohasu!   You were literally asking for it. Seriously.         God I wished Takeo would just come out of nowhere and slap 8man for being so Beta  Currently waiting for the Yui mom doujins   I hope the opposite.   How many will survive the incoming Yahari drought to tell the tale?  So who loves 8man more?   Yui or Yukino?    So, Yukino is pretty much Cloud at the beginning of FFVII, minus the mind lags due to being experimented on, but has the same self-steem issues, and pretty much copies the behaviour the people she looks up to.   Cloud was much cooler when he tried acting like Zack, rather than emoing around though.       threesome with 8man, gahama-chan and gahamama.  Japan please.     Are you kidding? It would snap the poor boy's neck and send his head spinning off into a ditch.    That image was the funniest shit in the world the first time it was posted. Now it has lost all of it's meaning, just like the very series it insults.  Perhaps that was the goal all along.     If you could change one decision 8man made, what would you change? Would you walk Yui home? Would you go over to Yukino and take the chocolate yourself? Would you fuck saika?      Yui is love and Yui is life, so I'll be in here for the long haul.  At least until Spyro finishes translating the whole series.        double paizuri    they both call 8man Hikki   Don't fail me, nips        It's a fun ride taichou.  Our goddess back down so the Club can solve their own problem. Now Yui and Yukino start moving, she must try harder in vol 11.5 and 12. I'll lurking till then...     Just ordered my Yukino body pillow. Bought an onahole so i will stick it in it and fuck my pillow. You can call me what you want, but I wont call you nigga    the only other fanart i can find of yukino mom is her taking the dick from who I assume is 8man and talking about NTR    I'll be on those, yeah. I'll post but not with the intent of killing the cunt.    where did you get the pillow from?    Pics of pillow please.   So what now? endless waiting until vol.12 comes out?   Pics or fuck off    Love you too.   Well the blu-ray side stories should be coming in a relatively decent span of time, so it isn't as bad as a wait. But it's still going to suck because of that bloody cliff-hanger.    At least you're honest about it, some people pretend it's for two different things when we all know they are bloody lying.   Good to hear, hopefully the threads will be calmer since the airing is over. I've always enjoyed your presence in these threads captain.             11.5 will come 1st, typical Watari    Basically. If all goes well, November/December      Not him but I posted these pictures in a thread not too long ago.       8man and Yukino staring into each other's eyes again   Why 8man and Yukino go full spaghetti when they look at each other over the last 3 episodes?      I'll assume most of his hangups make a lot of early scenes non-decisions in a sense, and instead of waffling at Destinyland I'd make plans to take Yui to the neighboring amusement park the weekend after Christmas. All the riajuu would be burned out from doing their Christmas Eve deitos so We'd practically have the whole place to ourselves.    the other side (I presume)       Aliexpress motherfuckers       Sexual tension of course.   When do the subs usually go up?   I-is she fucking naked? That's lewd anon.    They want to fuck.   Seeing Yukino as she is now, is like seeing Stone Cold when he started acting like a faggot after Wrestlemania X7.  Will the old Yukino return?    Does this look like the face of mercy?   Yukino End is best.    no signs that Yukino loves 8man for 12 episodes   hurr durr now she loves him  Shit, just shit. Hikki is Yui's property.     Iroha or Death, Captain!   I'll miss you Captain and Yukinofags plus Yuifags, we've went through our Cold Wars but it sure as hell was one great Cold War.       That, and 8man is forcing himself to suppress his feelings because he wants to help Yukino achieve genuine before he admits his feelings.    4/5 months till Vol 12    OVA who knows when    Let the waiting begin      Yuckyno a shit.    Well, I don't know about you but I am fucking her naked too.     It is obvious he has feelings for her    Reminds me of another time she wore a look of unshakable determination.    That's not Yukino, that's Ayase.    Yes    "Don't you think hose penguins look like birds?"   "Penguins are birds"   For fuck's sake Yui.      With how Yukino acted this episode, the amount of ice layers walling in her fragile personality was insane back then.    Fuck off    Old Yukino is gone, along with the comedy.    I hope this happens   Fuck. It's too good.     I was waiting for this since vol. 1     Well, one could argue that she wasn't thinking about what she was saying. She was more focused on her goals at the time.    Why are you comparing a 17 year old highschool girl to a wrestler? I think this is the reason why I am going to miss these threads.    I laughed, it was freaking funny.   So Yui started getting down when she saw the penguins grooming. Why?  Yukino got down when she saw that penguins only have the on partner for life. Why?        This still hurts no matter what boat you're on.      Yukino is just going through a dere phase right now because she's in love with 8man and doesn't know what she's supposed to do and when she's supposed to do it.      Because they saw, the penguins can only have ONE partner.    why must she suffer so    What a fucking retard. I probably would've told her to kill herself.      Why does that make them sad then?    In LN it's a fair scene. Since Yui did it to Yukino 1st, right after Penguins scene    I'm not gay but 8man is fucking hot there   Because I'm sure most of you don't have nearly enough Gamama in your life yet.  https://d.maxfile.ro/gxvsdbmrwb.mp4<wbr></wbr>     That's not accurate at all. Succubus are effectively powerless against those who can resist lust.  Furthermore they don't enslave men, they drain their lifeforce, killing them.      Dumb slut like her mother and she would probably become a teen mom like Yuimom.      Yui   Her smile and optimism: Gone.        fireworks scene    the music   It's like seeing someone slowly die. Well done Feel.      Hold my creditcard anon. It looks like a Yukino pillow won't be enough. Look at her face. I am looking forward to mastubrate in that face and cum on it   She had her moments in the LN; it was probably 50/50 Yui/Yukino when paired with Hachiman    When is the fucking Yukino figurine coming?    Because seeing Yukino being as lame as she is right now, is as sad as seeing Austing being lame after Wrestlemania X7.   A girl can be dere and awesome at the same time. Yukino is a ball of problems right now. Yukino used to be cool back in the days. The dere isn't worth the loss of her attitude.         You're the one buying merchandise. Watari cares about your opinion the most.  Tell us anon, who do you want to win?     Why did this scene immediately cut to Yukino? Did he just leave Yui to take pictures alone?    I'm not sure what you're trying to tell me.    whats those runes say     He wanted to talk to Yukino about being partners for life.  No but really he thought she was troubled and wanted to help her.  Not sure why he didn't take Yui with him since they're all friends.       penguins only get one life partner. Both Yui and Yukino want the 8 for themselves     I pre-ordered both Yui scales. They can't come soon enough.     My anon can't be this dense. Anon, they realise that they can't share 8man. Just one person can have him. That's why they get serious again.    That's not official merchandise, so Watari doesn't care. I think I might though. Is it cheating on your waifu if you have two dakis of her? I'm new to the etiquette of this.  The  genuine  one was released way back around S1.      Unless one of them dies penguins only have ONE partner for the rest of their lives.  This made the girls both sad but I don't know why.      Indonesian  subs is out.  beware of his shitty translation though     That penguins have the same partner until they die. Or just that they have one partner.   Not being bias here, but honestly I feel like the anime really didn't do the Yui's scenes justice.   The anime completely skipped over all the 8man's monologues that indicates there may be a chance for Yui end, wait for vol.11translation and you will see what I mean.  Even many nips in 2ch feel the same way.  アニメだけ見るとゆきのんエンドが一番可能性が高い    原作読むとガハマさんエンドかなと思う   印象が全然変わってくる             Soon anon, we can only hope.    And the fun side.    they obviously  like penguins and are sad when one dies     He offered but she said she was going to take more pics.      mfw so accustomed to English sub that looking at indosub feel awkward    So what's Yukino's request going to be.   The whole adaptation has been like this though. It was pretty obvious that they would do the same with this vol.    Feel must know Yukino will win, that's why.   I like dere Yukinon. I think in short spurts its perfectly fine (see ramen walk back in ep 1)  What I dont like Watari doing is putting Yukinoshita into these extremes where she was icy cold at the beginning and now shes some hopeless dere that cant do much (hurt me to see how much she wanted to give those chocolates to Hikki but couldnt)  Enough is enough Watari. Yukinoshita is suffering. She had to deal with Yukimom and haruno (twice) in a span of a day or so. She's the main heroine. You dumpstered her since like vol 6. Where is the light at the end of the tunnel?      Will Togashi die before he finishes Hunter X Hunter?   No.   He's dead already. this is the biggest Jump's conspiracy.   He's only 49 years old, so no.    So him being "sick" or "injured" is just Jump stalling for time as they try to warp the series for their own sinister gain? Everything makes sense now.   So what's his deal, is he addicted to Idolmaster too?  Also who the fuck is spamming HxH threads and why?   Its called Dragon Quest dad    Even if he were 18 he would die before finishing HxH    Forget about HxH, read a better manga.    You're thinking of Miura, Togashi plays DQ.  Someone who can't use the catalog.      How do you find something better than a masterpiece?     HxH is a masterpiece  Fucking kek.     U haven't read it.    Nausicaa     tumblr     Name a better shounen.     moron still thinks that Kentaro Miura still plays The Idolmaster  He does many things. You just don't know what he does.     JoJo    Urusei Yatsura    That's the only good part of hunter x hunter    KeitAi.     gay ass japanese title  Fuck that. kill yourself you fucking nerd      Only shounen manga can be a masterpiece   wut?    Why would you use those shitty quality short tumblr gifs?   ebin    NNT, Toriko and One Piece.    It's a masterpiece in the battle shonen type manga.    Its too silly to compare but it is good tbh.   Is this the bait thread?   A masterpiece in the shittiest genre, wow!    Fairy Tail.    That's not harem.    I never said that.    At least harem can have good girls, fighter shounens are just shitty sausage shits    Lol     At least harem can have good girls  Opinion discarded.     You havent read hunter x hunter    Ok.    Well, there are lots of IM games. It takes time after all.    Can't believe these losers actually see naked female cartoon characters as a plus.    Where do you think you are.    And even if you were 18 you'd still live out your entire life without ever getting a gf. Instead of sitting on your ass all day cutting yourself over hxh how about you go do something fucking productive and try to make some good out of your useless life.    You're such a dumb boy.    They also have annoying voices.    Your faggot shounen fighter MCs have the same girl voices.    You're right. I'm an idiot. Fuck this place.    sup normie    You haven't read Toriko.    Since when is loser an insult here?     Toriko even in the same league as OP or HxH   Fucking KHR is better than Toriko     Just wait for 6 months more     Rather hear a female make a little boy voice than a female make an annoying squeaky high pitched little cartoon fanservice bitch voice.    At least post the proper chart. https://hiatus-hiatus.rhcloud.com/     Yeah, you're actually right. Nice dog by the way.     You haven't read HxH.    Who said it was?    Neither have you.   I can't decide whether the chimera ant arc was the best or worst part of the entire story.  the pacing was all over the fucking place (did anyone really care that much about knuckle's stupid ability?) but the character development was excellent.     Thanks.     a lot of people get upset about the CA arc because it went on for almost a decade in manga form, and didn't include Hisoka/Chrollo/Kurapika at all (basically leaving the phantom troupe plot unfinished for nearly 10 years)      (did anyone really care that much about knuckle's stupid ability?)   I did      Numbers fuck me up    The ant arc was a way to introduce a DC creature that spiraled way out of control and turned into shit. Most of the characters were puppets to the plot and there was no reason for it to last more than 40 chapters.     puppets to the plot   only time where the plot dictated the pacing was when Komugi almost died  People say the stupidest shit to complain about this arc       the anime should have split the pacing in half. god damn that fucking castle invasion segment was borderline naruto tier.     Pacing was pretty shit, but I loved the characterization and how it set up the counter to the invasion.     The invasion was meant to feel slow and thorough, but it's true that they dragged out some scenes to get their best animators to work on certain episodes (this is noticable between episodes 113-115). It wasn't nearly as bad in the manga, each narration segment only took one panel.      I don't think so, Miura will die first........ then, I will go "BERSERK"     CA does have some pretty great stuff  -Meruem and his cronies all get some form of development, even Pitou who I never thought would display so much fear  -We get to see what Netero can do  -Cheetu getting his head crushed by Silva  -Gon and Killua unveiling new abilities  -Lots of progression for Gon's character arc in general  -Interesting reincarnation/duality themes  The biggest flaw of the arc is that characters that should have been minor (Knuckle and Shoot in particular) have way too much time devoted to showing the audience what they're doing.                    I hate the CA arc because the qt bee girl ended up getting killed off. And she wasn't even reincarnated as a cute bee-themed girl.      Ow man, it's hard to play     All characters (even minor ones like Ikalgo and Welfin) had a thematic role.    Onepiece, Naruto, Bleach    yep, the characters were only there for togashi's narrative points  it really sucked      Bait   will kurapika stay as a 'boy'? the 'twist' that kurapika is actually a girl doing a mulan has been obvious for almost a decade now, so i doubt togashi will ever give the audience the satisfaction of a reveal.   Sorry anon, your waifu is a man.   Yea in Dragon Quest   There was absolutely no reason to ever believe that he's a girl. He's expressly been a boy since chapter 2     do you think chrollo is a girl as well?      the 'twist' that kurapika is actually a girl doing a mulan has been obvious for almost a decade now  Delusional.      genders in HxH are fucked beyond repair anyway  look at the younger zoldyck siblings or pitou (despite there being female ants and looking like a cute girl, pitou is regarded as genderless)      This is now a Pika thread.    do you think chrollo is a girl as well?  Yes, because Hisoka canonically uses texture surprise to conceal her breasts.    Why is Killua's mom Robocop      He's so cute.    Why all this tumblr.     Gender ambiguity isn't genderlessness.    Alluka's a she, Kalluto's a he, Pitou's a they. Not that hard to understand. Now, if we're going to talk about sex instead of gender...    This. Pitou is whatever makes you want to fuck it the most.    Where else would i get the gifs?      More like Togashi is living off of his wife.  A divorce would shock Togashi back to reality where he then needs to start paying his bills by making manga again.        I'm pretty sure he got enough money from YYH and Level E.    maybe if you close your eyes and ignore the lady parts    Yes Togashi is horrible and has terrible work ethic.   He finished YuYu Hakusho and that's all that matters.   Why does Jump let him get away with this?     that huge streak during 2011 - 2012   coincidently when the anime started   Wow, Togashi fucked them in the ass later on when he didn't give a fuck again.      Togashi really live in a dumpster?    the pacing was all over the fucking place   yet still better paced than every bleach arc, shit piece arc, and naruto arc.        He's not lazy, he fucking mindbroke due to overwork early on in his career. Presumably he works slowly these days so he doesn't explode his heart. I'd blame his doctor, but really I'd rather he die before finishing HxH than be killed by HxH.      ya he's horrible with a terrible work ethic yet he made the best shonen manga ever created. stop cutting yourself over a childrens manga and get some fucking professional help.     mindbroke  Stop, you're giving me weird images.     That streak was his support for the earthquake/tsunami  According to Weekly Shonen Jump vol.7, Togashi Yoshihiro has renewed his record of the consecutive publications of Hunter x Hunter. He has been published the manga for 21 consecutive issues since August 8th 2011. The previous record of 20 issues was accomplished from January 2010 to June 2010. The longest hiatus for 79 issues was made from February 2006 till October 2007. Togashi said he will keep on publishing Hunter as long as possible to encourage people in the disaster area of Tohoku Earthquake.       Holy mother of projection.  Why would little girls want to date other girls, tho?       alright, so what?    Assburger detected.     Oh how I enjoy summer.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127141367   Hi, how are you.

It's nothing like YYH though. YYH became a chore so he ended it in a rush. He has even more control over his work now so could end HxH if he wanted, but he hasn't.  As for money, he married Sailor Moon, and this hiatus he stopped one chapter short of a volume so he mustn't care about getting any money from it.  I think he really does have health issues but also work ethic issues, most people would rather have year long holidays than work and Togashi has the freedom to do so.

The first page of hunter x hunter, Togashi says and i quote" I will work hard to crank out dozens of volumes I promise not to complain, I wont run away , I wont lose it , I think maybe..."   .... Incredible foreshadowing      Why is he so fucking unreliable? Does being a mangaka suck so much that he can't even churn out one chapter every month or so?    It's probably hugely in his head. He's feeling old and like he needs to start living for himself, not for other people, and he has enough money that he doesn't need to work, but he feels guilty about starting a series that millions around the world love, and nostalgia + guilt force him to write a new chapter every once in a while, and he's dedicated to putting his heart in it when he writes, so he only writes when he can do that because he doesn't want to put out a cheap chapter that's a waste of his followers' time.  That's what I like to believe.      I don't think he writes out of guilt, he seems to have no problem completely ignoring the expectations of fans and doesn't mind causing trouble for jump/his editors. But I do think he only wants to write when his heart's in it, for the story at least (maybe not the drawings).     finishes Hunter X Hunter  he already did     I know this is giving Togashi way too much credit, and it's almost definitely not true, but it felt like all his crappy illustrations were in the really lighthearted panels that were kid friendly, almost like those happy moments in the story were written and drawn like a child, and it was intentional.  Again though, I know that is giving him way too much credit, and it's like 99% likely that that is not true and he was just being lazy.       Again though, I know that is giving him way too much credit, and it's like 99% likely that that is not true and he was just being lazy.     These chapters were all redrawn, heavily so, in the volumes. It was just laziness.  What are you are saying is only probably true for the chapter where Gon meets up with Kaito at the end of the CA arc, but those weren't sketch's, Togashi actually used water paint for that chapter.         Definitely not, the scribbles happened during the first half of the CA arc and there was nothing childish about that.  But they weren't the worst thing in the world to me, scribbles done by a competant artist can still be tolerable to look at because they're just first drafts. I save scribbled fanart because I like the look of it.      Is it wrong that I love the idea of Gon and Killua cuddling in a platonic sense just being kids that aren't ashamed of cuddling, but I'm also ok with the idea that they might explore their sexuality too?    Of course not anon. Any sort of affection between them is a good thing.    Pitou is such a slut.    I sincerely hopeso, but only if it's in the next few years. I don't know how long this whole "four-chan" thing is going to last, but I want to be on /a/ to taste the tears and impotent rage of knowing HxH won't be touched by anyone for the next fifty years.    Her parents use gender neutral terms.   Since Togashi left so many things open, do you think Gon has an imouto somewhere in the world?  Realistically though, Togashi will probably never revisit the problem of Gon's biological mother.      sexualizing the pitou     Kill yourself.     Togashi will probably never revisit the problem of Gon's biological mother.  It's not a problem, though.     Bad word choice on my side, "question" maybe? Gon's relationship with Mito is great and I wouldn't his real mother introduced, though that wouldn't change things.     Gon already said he doesnt't care about his real mother, Mito is his mom now. Togashi doesn't have to explain shit.   Killua is cute!   That is a correct statement, thank you.    Because summerfags    Bur that's wrong.    Pitou is made for sexualizing.    Faggot pls refer to     Kill yourself.    That's rude anon.    Why would you say this? Don't say this    The fact that this actually has become a possibility makes it even more depressing.    Pitou's literally one of the least sexual people in the HxH world. Maybe you'd have a case with Leorio or Zazan.    They call her an it because they don't think she's a person.    Per volume sales sell on-par or sometimes more than Naruto.  Kishimoto wold get fucking wrecked if Togashi went all-out.       image.jpg   not killua_misses_his_target.jpg      see    your fat ass will die long before togashi does       really toriko has been constantly in what hxh would consider the dark continent     Pitou's literally one of the least sexual people in the HxH world.  Says you     I want Illumi to protect me!   www.animemaru.com/hunter-x-hunter-s<wbr>taff-going-on-hiatus-to-play-every-<wbr>dragon-quest-game/</wbr></wbr>   He's so normal.      You might as well say Meruem is sexual since he has large hips and thighs then. Go all the way, anon.    I want Illumi to discipline me!    His proportions aren't attractive     Pitou has an appealing design that people sexualize.      cute face and sexy body  speak for yourself    <br/>  Post Pitou  HxH was only good until CA arc, then it was mostly shit with a few good moments.  Best arcs are Hunter Exam and Greed Island and HxH will never be good again.         What a shit opinion you have anon. The best arcs were Yorkshin, Greed Island and CA.    You forgot to mention the Yorkshin arc.  Greed Island is the closest arc so far that delivered on some things that were promised in the first chapter, so it's probably the highest point. But the DC arc will get started eventually.  Still, one shitty arc really hurt the series because of its length and hiatuses.       Maybe. Togashi has literally no reason to work on Hunter x Hunter aside from wanting you. He's happy being a stay at home dad and playing Dragon Quest all the time.    things that were promised in the first chapter  Like what, Gon becoming a hunter and finding his dad? Those have been done in other arcs.     'Oh damn its a legit HxH thread!'   Another pedo fagets circlejerking  welp     HxH should have focused more on this type of stuff. Hunter Exam, Greed Island, DC, and whatever else Togashi could have imagined in place of Yorkshit and Chimerashit    Pitou isn't sexual no matter what Madhouse wants you to think.     Yorkshit  why?       It wasn't memorable and Kurapika ruins it at the last minute with moralfaggotry and loss of resolve.  I never liked power levels and nen in HxH       hurr this creature who doesn't behave in sexual ways is sexual because they have a female body     y-you too     realizing revenge isn't fulfilling and choosing your friend's lives over it is moralfaggotry   implying greed island isn't nen: the arc      Those were never the premise though. Just because Yorkshin and CA weren't what you were expecting from HxH doesn't mean they weren't great.   moralfaggotry  Oh okay, then he should have murdered everyone and let his friends die for his revenge and concluded the arc with "Yeah, sorry" i guess. Believe it or not, killing someone has some pretty big emotional weight.         i liked Greed Island   i don't like nen       Phantom Troupe is still out there and they won't forget about Kurapika. If he didn't have a big enough cock to follow through with his plan to destroy them he never should have started. He has to finish it eventually, they aren't just gonna roll over.   Not to mention there will be more and more victims of their cruelty who could have been saved by Kurapika.       Kurapika's stopping made sense, he is actually someone who has experienced loss so he doesn't want to lose anyone else.   I fucking hate how there are so many legit fags in HxH threads. Where did you retards come from? Maybe that's why he stopped writing this shit   yes    Amazing anon, you are really contributing to the discussion with your shitposting!     Maybe they will let bygones be bygones and just let it go? I mean let's be serious, Chrollo was likely seriously thinking about recruiting Kurapika and machi was alright with it. Nobunaga was the only one really asshurt about it and Chrollo made him calm the fuck down.     Kurapika has made a decision that you didn't like because he didn't become a murderous edgelord, how does that make Yorkshin bad exactly?     Fine then. Can we discuss what Kite's role is as a CA now? Isn't she the perfect guide to the DC? Will she die again? Can any human's potential even reach kite's as a CA?    Is the show worth watching or should I read the whole way through?    Hm read chapter 1 and then watch it. The anime is a 1:1 you lose nothing by watching it other than the kite thing at the start and it's a lot more  fun      Some episodes are definitely worth watching, but the manga is superior in pretty much every single way. However, there are some chapters where Togashi got sick/lazy and were drawn like shit, he eventually has redrawn them though. I think only bakabt has the redrawn scans.     He will become more mellow and kindhearted, and then when him and Gon are reunited all of his feelings will come back. But instead of Killua seeing himself as worthless in comparison to Gon he'll see himself as just lucky to have a  ___friend  as amazing as Gon.     murdering murderers   bad  He has every right to be edgy when it comes to the Spiders.      breeders gtfo    No     likes shit girls  even pitoufags are better than you.       mfw kurapika exterminates these spiders      He's completely normal, anon.    Joke's on you, i like Bisky too.    I want Illumi to hug me!    you should cut back your tastes a bit then, because it's starting to leak into shit.  I want Illumi to  carry  me       disliking the best arcs  What a shitty taste.  My husando Hisoka wasn't even a big part of CA and barely did anything in Yorkshin, compared to his great moments in Hunter Exam, the tower thing, and greed island, and even so I still admit Yorkshin and CA are immensely better than those...       But that was at the cost of his friends lives, and unlike Sasuke Kurapika's not an edgelord. He doesn't want revenge for the sake of it.     talking about shit taste   wanting Illumi to carry you  Speak for yourself anon.      illumi is best boy though   honestly illumifags have the worst taste    implying Gon wouldn't have moved on by then.    Killua's problem isn't just his self esteem but also his shit personality.      This is what the Spiders did to his family and friends. Kurapika would be doing a service to humanity by killing them, it's not just revenge.    there are people who unironically enjoy HxH just like there are people who unironically enjoy bleach    Almost as bad as Killuafags. Any sensible person knows that Leorio is the best boy.    D. Gray man ;_;    leorio is best man, pleb    See     Stop lying.     The anime is a 1:1 you lose nothing by watching it     I always forget this existed... And Iwatched all the episodes, if I'm not mistaken... can't even remember what it was about, the only thing I remember is the appearance of the main villain.    D.Gray-man is shit. Absolute shit.     implying Gon doesn't still love him     Gon is too pure for his own good, and doesn't realize that Killua is a shit friend.    True, but maybe Killua will get better Or maybe he does understand it somewhat and is just really forgiving     Illumi is a beauty.     maybe he does understand it somewhat  He really doesn't, he has some pretty serious self-esteem issues and believes that everything was his fault. I mean shit, he even tried to kill himself and said that he should have been the one to die.     Why is he so beautiful, anon?     you just don't know what he does.  I sure know what he doesn't do, fucking Berserk     My biggest fear is that somehow Togashi's intention actually was that Gon is at fault and Killua was totally justified when he was screaming "I'll make you apologize!"  but I hope Togashi is a better writer than that      It is because he is beautiful on the inside as well. He is the best big brother.   Alright so lets discuss how long each of us would endure without chapters before giving up on this series and moving on.  I personally am a pretty weak willed person so I would likely give up on HxH if the hiatus lasted more than 3 years with no news.  Also here's a shitty personality test chart I found       Obviously not, it's just that people mistook Killua's thoughts for actual narration.    what do you mean I'll just read the new chapters if they come     Yeah but I'd like to see some acknowledgement that Killua is wrong. The closest thing we got was Alluka getting mad at him for being hard on Gon.    As long as I can shitpost on /a/ I'll be fine.      not a catsomething discarded        How long will keep actively following HxH? How long will you keep looking for news related to it? How long will you participate in threads like these?  There has to be a point where you just go "whatever, if a new chapter comes out I might read it but I currently don't care about the series anymore".  Surely you aren't planning on clinging to a series for the rest of your life if it becomes obvious that a new chapter is not going to come?         I don't plan on the rest of my life    NNT    Well Killua wasn't around anyone who would have told him that he was a shit to Gon, if Bisky was around she would have let him have it, but she wasn't there, so there was no one who really could have called out on it.  Because of the DC arc involving Nanika Killua will probably end up having to face his fuck ups head on.      I hope so. I hate how that fagget gon looks.    Maybe Togashi plans to have Killua become self aware at some point then feel all guilty and scared of Illumi's ''you will betray your friends'' prophecy, at which point he'll either decide his brother is right and he's not worthy of friends or he'll try to make it up to Gon..    Gon is a miracle of the universe.    original meme do not steal    Is Gon asexual?     Isn't she the perfect guide to the DC?  I like this idea. Maybe she'll fight by Gon's side this time?     I doubt Gon and Kite have anything to do with the DC.    He has his mind on other things, he is supposed to be the pure and simple character. That's why he hates it so much Pitou, somebody who hurt a person he cares for, is doing a good deed by healing a human girl.Yeah though, I know he has some dark undertones especially the way he accepts Ging left him and that makes him very interesting. Maybe the pure and simple act is just a way of not thinking about such things.  Did he not hit puberty yet to be interested in people?     What?     she     What about her?    This is an interesting character design but the blonde loli version looked so cute. Well at least I assumed she was blonde.     I have no defense for myself or my shit series so hurr kill yourself  You should take your own advice anon, you are sad, your life is sad.     I don't know what grill Kite's real hair color is, but I'll pretend it's white like man Kite's hair.    That's some really nice fanart. I hope we see more of Kite in battle eventually.   anime only fag here  does the manga show the rest of kite's weapons?     Koala confirms it's red.    Not really. Was it only 2 or 3? I might not remember correctly.    No.    No. I'm still mad.  2, 3 and 4.      Damn, I'm dumb. I forgot about that   which HxH would you snuggle up and watch TV with?   Sensui       watch tv   not play joystation      Shizuku I guess.     that image  Gon was too innocent for the Hunter world.     Jump off a bridge.    we will never see the full series   we will never get blurays of the original show   Never, ever, EVER   Fuck. at least it kinda ends on the newest arc. It's not closure, but it's nowhere near as fucked as What berserk fans have to go through.  Shame about the original show though. The production values were so good. I would prefer it to the new one if they had actually finished it.         I've actually been wondering if there's an intentional parallel between these faces made by Gon and Killua. Of course it could just be Togashi using similar expressions and they might not be connected at all    Illu-nii.     The original show's style suits the yorkshin arc and chimera ant, but not the others.      Just finished the manga today.  Holy fuck it got really boring near the end.      end     Greed Island OVAs though.    I wonder, that face isn't reused anywhere else. And they both were in a similar situation.     Holy fuck it got really boring near the end.  Too much exposition?     You mean the DC exposition?    These don't exist.    To be fair both adaptations of GI were shit     In what way?     99 was shit animation and 2011 cut stuff for no reason, plus censorship     The exposition dump was a bore to me since I know the DC isn't going to come into play until maybe 2017 (if we're lucky)  Maybe it was scans I read, but the wordiness got a little extreme. I'm not saying that there were too many words, but the way they were presented didn't exactly make it an easy read. See kurapika opening his fine mouth.       forgot to post pic     I love how he developed his nen ability to specifically kill the spiders, yet it can be used as a dowsing rod..     He only designed two of them to work specifically against the spiders.    The viz scans on nyaa are less wordy, if you want to check them out.   would you give kurapika a  footrub?     Yeah, you should check out the Viz scans. The translations are better.      2017     The pacing was awful but the chimera ant arc is the only notable part of HxH and without it HxH wouldn't have been worth the time       the chimera ant arc is the only notable part of HxH and without it HxH wouldn't have been worth the time  Shit opinion, i love the CA arc but the rest of HxH is still great.     Its the truth At least CA arc tried to be different    Do you think Killua swallows  watermelon seeds?      its definitely above average, but without it hxh wouldnt be top 10 shonen battle manga    One. Only Chain Jail is restricted to the Troupe. Judgment Chain requires that his eyes turn red.     yes, i think he'd enjoy it after a long day.     I know, but he designed it to be used against the troupe. I'm pretty sure he states it when he discusses it with Gon, or just at the end of the Yorkshin arc.    lol I guess was being incredibly hopeful. My guess is we'll see beyond look out from his ship to the whirling seas then the chapter ends. then 2018 we see him say "there it is"     tried to be different   battles up the wazoo and literal explosions      Is that really all you got from it?    All of HxH tries to be different. That was almost the entire point of anticlimaxes.    illumi is intj    ENTJ should have been Pouf.    Truly the best boy.    10 years, still going strong.  You weak little cunt.       Killua   Idealistic   Loyal   Seek to understand people and help them fulfill their potential       togashi should just give his remaining script and character designs to madhouse. its obvious he just wants to retire and play dragon quest.    wanting retards to handle the material     Madhouse did a great job with Kite and those movies, i sure wish Togashi would let them butcher HxH more    It would easily stay top 5. Standards for battle shounen aren't high.    The CA arc knocked it right out of the top ten. Only DC can redeem it now.    Nice shit opinion, CA arc is great.    Nice shit opinion, CA arc is terrible.    its the best part of HxH so if its terrible, so is hxh    CA is what takes HxH from good to great, with some actual depth and notable character development.    I'm so glad that a bunch of throwaway characters received development. It really made the series special.    140 chapters is longer than most manga. You can hardly call them "throwaway", even without considering the fact that most characters that were involved in the CA arc are still relevant.    And others just got killed.    Stop    Quit crying about pacing.     Still mad that the royal ants didn't amount to shit.  Then you got characters like Shoot with hamfisted development, Kite and Pokkle/Ponzu who died way too early, Knov who got PTSD because the plot demanded it, Meleoron who wanted revenge but it never went anywhere or was mentioned again, etc.        didn't read the manga    how come pitou is shown with human feet here? I thought she had weird cat legs.   you forgot about palm whose brain was tampered with yet managed to return to normal with words alone    Killua &gt; brainwashing   so did pokkle get reborn? who do you think he ended up as?     No? she had bug knees but other than that the legs seemed pretty normal, with properly proportioned feet and a human shoe size.    meruem's helmet     the royal ants didn't amount to shit  What? The protagonists never once were in a position where they had the advantage over them.  Shoot with hamfisted development  All he did was find a reason to fight and a reason to die. It's not hamfisted in any way.  because the plot demanded it  What does that mean anyway? You can say that about anything significant that happens ever.  Meleoron who wanted revenge but it never went anywhere or was mentioned again  Meleoron realized that his role was to help the others as much as he could, what did you want him to do? Kill Meruem himself? Ging abandonned Gon because the plot demanded it  Pic related.               when she's shown briefly in the nude, she has cat legs      Ging abandonned Gon because the plot demanded it  That was meant to be 2 lines higher up.     That was a symbolic shot where she was being compared to a cat.    pitou turns kite, a skinny triangle faced man in a turtleneck sweater, into a cute little girl   gets her skull bashed in for doing so        implying that's not some random girl with Kite's memories   implying Kite wasn't perfection incarnate   being a Shitou apologist  What an awful post.        a kid palm disliked promoted her recovery after a part of her brain was destroyed   ebin development       implying Palm truly disliked him   "ebin"      Killua's cuteness can bend reality.    Yes.  He'll swallow anything as long as it doesn't taste bad or isn't red peppers.     she tried to stab him in the head out of love, then?     not expressing your love through violence     She also tried to kill Gon. Does that mean she doesn't like him either?  I think you missed the part where Palm was a yandere.      implying semen doesn't taste bad      implying Gon's semen tastes bad     semen's taste varies from man to man, the best ones are slightly sweet, with a salty after-taste and with a fragrant scent.    I want to drink Mizaistom's milk!    stop cutting yourself and go read a different fucking manga, you never gave togashi any shekels anyways so your complaints are MOOT.    Semen tastes fine though    You sound like a wine critic Anon.     this entire post     of course, semen is serious business    bad day?    Not surprised.    I love how understated HxH's humor is. 10/10.   Is it wrong that I feel as though Killua has the most potential for growth in the series? I mean next to Gon of course, of course Kurapika is OP just because of his bullshit eyes.   Just imagine when they reach adulthood, they'll be walking God hunters, also I don't see the fascination with Gin. He is regarded and viewed as some OP hunter but is he really that strong? He was said to be among the top nen users in the world.   I just see him as a shitty father who wants to go live in space with aliens.        most potential for growth in the series is potential power level  ur boring       not wanting Princess Naoko to take over her husbands work and turn all the boys into cute Sailor Senshi       Is it wrong that I feel as though Killua has the most potential for growth in the series?  Not with that personality and diet.   but is he really that strong? He was said to be among the top nen users in the world.  You just answered your own question.   I just see him as a shitty father who wants to go live in space with aliens.  What does that have to do with his strength?            What does that have to do with his strength?   I just meant that we haven't really seen him go all out or show what he can really do. I'm just wanting to see exactly how strong he is, I mean could he have gone toe to toe with Netero?   I have no idea where he would stand in terms of power level and strength, we haven't gotten a clear reading of it.   Is the strongest of the Zodiac? They don't really seem to fear him.           Is the strongest of the Zodiac? They don't really seem to fear him.  They don't even know each other's abilities. They most likely only meet up to discuss politics and shit.      They don't really seem to fear him.  So? They didn't fear Netero.     Have you read what we have of the DC arc yet?    Arc rankings   Favorite new characters (Election, DC)     Well I know Ging can be persuasive and intimidating, he also doesn't scare easily. He's a risk taker and doesn't have a problem betting all his chips on one outcome to occur, also he's an enigma.   He demanded to be Rat's number two and didn't even give a shit if anyone objected, of course when you have infinite money like he does you can just bribe and pay people off....which is exactly what he did.       Top tier  Yorkshin, Greed Island, CA, DC so far  Good tier  Election, Arena  OK tier  Exam  Eh tier  Zoldyck family            God tier  Yorkshin, Greed Island, first part of Chimera Ant  Great tier  Hunter Exam, Zoldyck Family, DC so far  Good tier  Election, Heavens Arena, Third part of Chimera Ant  Okay tier  Second part of Chimera Ant  Ging(or Pariston if he doesn't count as new), Cheadle, Mizaistom, Kanzai, Muherr              What berserk fans have to go through.  HxH is literally the opposite end They can't get on the boat Berserk can't get off of it.       Yeah, but in HxH's case it's only been a couple of years. It's been like 7 for Berserk.    At least other shit has been going on. 2 more months until HxH hits a year, 4 more until Berserk does.    killua get off of 4chan    Kil is not a slut.    Havent read the manga, just finished the anime, where should I start reading?     Youpi develops at like 300% the rate of Meruem     chapter 1    Chapter 1.    Honestly i liked the fact that Meruem's development was so gradual, it felt more realistic. He only reached his peak for a short moment before dying.    First chapter   Would you Chrollo a Chrollo?   I know. I thought Youpi's development happened way too fast.  Though I guess the arc suffers from poor planning overall.      Why is Chrollo so sexual?     Youpi's development happened way too fast.  It started at the very beginning of the invasion, continued when he discovered his ability to "implode", reached his peak during during the fight with Morel/Knuckle and then stopped once he saw what happened to Meruem. That's like 40 chapters, it's respectable enough.      Around 11 minutes. Too fast.    You are getting that in dc arc.  THe reason they became hunters wasn't for these typical adventure and hunting reasons. Kurapika wanted revenge, Gon just wanted to find his dad, Killua wanted to find a purpose and friendship, Leorio wanted to be a doctor. They focused on those goals.      Man, this panel is so powerful, Togashi is a genius.      I don't get it.    Chrollo's design is inconsistent, I wonder what he'd look like now.    He looked like him in his 99 design    He looks middle eastern    Meh try reading Warhammer 40k Togashi really isn't shit as a writer. He borrows from cliches more than any other manga artist I've seen tbh.     I loved CA but damn i miss the Ryodan. I really hope they'll be involved in this arc.   Regular updates, good story.  The art is fine, it was only ever bad in the beginning of the ant arc.      Like what? If anything he avoids the biggest cliches in battle shounen as much as possible or subverts them.     tfw 4 of my 5 favorite manga are on hiatus     Oh, fuck off.  40k is a quagmire of disparate elements meshed into a gothic space opera aesthetic and oversaturated in the most disjointed, pointlessly bleak narratives and characters in any setting. It's main vehicle is a buildup to a plot that will never progress because they can't deliver at this point: they oversold and under-delivered such that they're story will never be meaningful without radical change.  This doesn't mean Togashi is good. There are likely authors that can create a better, more cohesive setting if given the opportunity (and certainly at a much higher clip). But the ability to use story conventions isn't a failing. Even a highly derivative piece has merit if the execution and implementation is solid, and despite his shortcomings, Togashi puts together enjoyable work.        I mean for a while it was closer to just pick 1.    I always get either ISFJ or INTJ when I do that test.    She was wearing socks or shoes or something earlier but they got blown off when Gon punched her the first time. I actually asked that same question a long time ago and some anon went through and watched it frame by frame, her socks little get blown off.    Don't you mean just pick 1? This is HxH.    It's basically 1.5, always a good story, never regular updates, good art half the time    1.8    So Gon rocks the socks?      Why such a small reaction?     Pitou is a small kittybug :3       It's all you deserve.    because it's an ant    But that wasn't a :3    I deserve better.     Okay.     You don't, but i'm a generous person. Have a slightly larger Pitou.   Going to watch Evangelion, so do I start with the anime, then watch EoE and then the Rebuilds?   Also what am I in for?     Yes, though don't bother with the rebuilds.  You are in for spoilers if you don't leave here immediately.     You're in to get fucking spoiled if you don't exist out of /a/ right now.   It's alright I think I've already ruined it for myself, what's wrong with the Rebuilds? Also someone told me to skip episode 25/26 and instead watch EoE because it's meant to be the proper ending but instead they run out of money during the series     Also someone told me to skip episode 25/26 and instead watch EoE because it's meant to be the proper ending but instead they run out of money during the series   That's wrong, the correct order is the show, then EoE. Some faggots say watch EoE BEFORE the last two episodes, but they are wrong as well.  The Rebuilds are unnecessary once you've see the actual show.        Alright thanks anon    Have fun, the show starts kind of slow, but stick with it. It's one of those ones you have to have seen to even browse.  Mostly expect to have the OP stuck in your head for the next week.     Rebuilds are bullshit, especially this whore  Also wondering this too, how do you guys watch it, torrent or dvd/bluray?   That's probably the best way to enjoy the series. Rebuilds are nice; people really love to complain about them though. Watch them so you can form your own opinion about them.    It's best to leave a gap before watching them, they have legit ruined Eva for a lot of people. It's nice to at least have a time where your idea of it is the original show and not the shitty new version.   Beware, OP. The first 13 episodes of boobs n robots can be something of a slog if you come in believing the LOLSODEEP hype.  The producers ran out of money after episode 24, so the planned episode 25/26 were not made and we got the infamous muh psychotherapy ending. EoE gives you (what is based on) the original planned episode 25 and a new ending (this episode separation has its own title card, credits and an intermission).  The one true honest way to watch is to watch the first half of EoE (episode 25'), then episodes 25 and 26, then the second half of EoE.   According to Sadamoto (character designer and author of the manga):   : But I thought that the final two episodes were fine. I thought it was simply a matter of the connecting episode between episodes 24 and 25 being missing. That's why we're doing the original episode 25 (the remake version) now. I think it's just that that episode was missing. I saw the initial script. If the original episode 25 had been there, then there would have been a clear link leading up to the television versions of episodes 25 and 26. Just one episode was missing. So I thought [the ending] was fine.            wait till August 25th and watch remastered bluray when it comes out.    Series-EoE-Rebuild  Prepare to be edged     OP be sure to watch the Director's Cut versions of eps 21-24, called 21'-24'.    Also what am I in for?  Watching the Rebuilds you're in for a great disappointment.     21' is probably my favorite part of the whole show.    Um, define "watch" Cause if you're just watching it I don't care, but if you're "watching" it then my only advice to you is DON'T FUCKING WATCH IT    oh by the way, that wasn't a pun about clocks and time travel, I meant it as in "if you're doing a live action reenactment of this bullshit, you're retarded and you should stop"  see, there is LITERALLY, and I mean LITERALLY NO POSSIBLE UNIVERSE in which "Canada" doesn't lose horribly so we should all stop worrying and just have fun. I'm really not kidding          What?        wot u chattin bruv?    Don't spoil yourself by skipping the last two episodes to go straight into EoE. After watching Eva for the first time, you may disagree with this, but over time, you'll come to see Episode 25 and 26's merits.   faggot   I almost want you to do something retarded like work backwards from Campus Apocalypse just to see if the experience is different.   If Campus Apocalypse is retarded, then what would that make Shinji Ikari Raising Project?    Hilarious, because then you'd be watching slice of life characters live out NGE. It'd be like those really dark Azumanga doujins.    Lots of unfathomable fapp traumas      they have legit ruined Eva for a lot of people   Because people are stupid. Rebuild tells a different story and ultimately has no impact on the original series.   NGE and Rebuild are like Fullmetal Alchemist 2003 and Brotherhood. They start off in the same place and diverge into different stories.         I love the classified video at the start of 21'. Ultimately it tells you nothing of importance that you didn't already know, but it's neat to have a glimpse into Second Impact.   The greatest anime of all time, you probably won't like it.   The one who made that should kill themselves.     Also what am I in for?   After browsing a couple of threads I´m pretty sure you have an idea  Can I suggest you to watch other Anno stuff like Gunbuster, Nadia or Karekano before go full Rebuild?        I would absolutely suggest watching Nadia before watching Q. And because Nadia is a really good series outside that stupid filler arc.    Just watch that shit in order, Eps 25/26 are trippy as fuck and get further explanation in EoE. Watch the Rebuilds if you want, as far as we know they are their own standalone story. I personally liked Rebuild 1 and 2, however 3 was a bit disappointing (but watch it anyway I guess).     Because people are stupid. Rebuild tells a different story and ultimately has no impact on the original series.   Maybe if you're a dumb autist that's out of the touch with the world.  You don't even know about Anno changing the ending of ep 26 in the BD's with new voiceover and dialogue from Asuka. I pity your ignorance.         They never said they were changing it, they're including one of the two alternate endings that were axed from EoE. It'll probably be the one where Asuka says she won't let Shinji killer.  Cool your tits until there's something worth being outraged over, sperglord.  Also, fuck you, you presumptuous ass.        No, more like fuck you, you deranged fanboy.  Take five minutes without the "I MUST PROTECT EVA AT ALL COSTS" goggles and wake the fuck up to the fact that the Rebuilds are collectively shit, and they do in fact affect everything concerning the franchise.  Nothing gets made, said or produced that doesn't relate to the rebuilds, and moreover people are not as autistic as you suggest and do of course include Rebuild whenever they think of or consider Evangelion.  A bubble where only the original exists does not exist. Think ahead, not backwards.   also, even if they include scrapped crap, it's bullshit.             I find it rather funny that you're accusing him of wearing the "PROTECT EVA AT ALL COSTS" glasses when you are the one advocating for complete and utter purity of the franchise and all things relating to it.  Let me make this clear: From a multimedia and larger universe standpoint, Eva was fucked from the moment it got popular. Eva is exploited for marketing all over the place in Japan. But marketing has no effect on the actual television show Neon Genesis Evangelion, and neither do the Rebuilds have any affect on them. Sure, they can change your perception of them, but that's all. Nothing happens to the actual content of the original series. Even changes to said content don't change anything because the originals are still out there.  You can't control how everyone gets to and experiences the series. That's just how things are.        That's all fine and dandy, until Ghost Mari pops up in the NGE BD edition     I find it rather funny that you're accusing him of wearing the "PROTECT EVA AT ALL COSTS" glasses when you are the one advocating for complete and utter purity of the franchise and all things relating to it.  It's not funny because this is criticism, which isn't what those goggles are about. I don't advocate purity either.   Let me make this clear: From a multimedia and larger universe standpoint, Eva was fucked from the moment it got popular.  Bold statement. But your arguments are negated by yourself here:   Sure, they can change your perception of them, but that's all   Which clearly shows the problem at hand. I have not said that the owners of EVA are capable of time-travel. But they can do the next best thing, change people's perception. The idea that the "original changes" is little more than a strawman argument, because the argument and point of criticism is always about re-presenting something existing in an arguably worse way.   You can't control how everyone gets to and experiences the series. That's just how things are.  You can - just see what you yourself wrote. Retcons, remakes, even interviews and marketing do exactly that.  Getting back to the point at hand: this is why Rebuild and everything related to it has an effect on the Evangelion franchise. This is also why it's completely backwards and idiotic to think a bubble where only the original exists, exists.                  Anno confirmed Japanese george lucas     First watch the Anime, skip the last two episodes and watch EoE, and after that watch the Rebuilds, don't listen to all the haters in here, the Rebuilds aren't bad.    The Rebuilds are bad as a whole. But the first two are nice enough.     First watch the Anime, skip the last two episodes    Stopped reading here      The bursting point of Anno's frustration and budget?   Watch the anime's first 24 episodes. Watch EoE, pause at the credits sequence in the middle. Watch eps 25 and 26. Finish EoE. Rebuilds are optional.    Evangelion franchise  I think this is the big difference between me and you. When you think of Eva, you think of a multimedia franchise, and all of the fittings that come with that. When I think of Eva, I think of Neon Genesis Evangelion, the television series, and End of Evangelion, and I think of them as pieces of art, not as pieces of a larger multimedia franchise. Both of us are correct in our own way, I suppose.      Watch EoE, pause at the credits sequence in the middle. Watch eps 25 and 26.  Do not do this. EoE is a masterpiece in it's own right and deserves to be watched all at once.    Why do the rebuilds get so much abuse? Sure the 2nd half of 2 and 3 were full on retarded but I enjoyed 1 and the first half of 2. They made Rei a much better character.   Then why did she appear in the last chapter of the manga, you baka-ass nigger?    people don't like it because near the middle of 2.22 it stops going by the original series storyline and starts to write its own, 3.33 is 100% original from the series    No, the difference isn't like that. What you just did there was to avoid taking a standpoint by pretending the original is the only thing that exists.  Which also shows your earlier post was just trash - you can't speak of EVA as a whole and then later claim you only think of a few parts of it later. You've already failed to uphold your own standard there.  Neither you or anyone else can change the fact that Rebuild or any other spinoffs will have effects on what Evangelion is.         Going to watch Evangelion, so do I start with the anime, then watch EoE and then the Rebuilds?  Yes  Also what am I in for?  Being spoiled in this thead        manga is still being released to this day  does it go way and above and beyond the original series? or is it largely side plots and things that still "keeps it going"?    Shinji dies at the end of Clannad   No, I'm drawing a distinction between Neon Genesis Evangelion as a work and Eva as a multimedia franchise. The two are separate, and I simply failed to draw that distinction in my post.    The first two are decent, but the third one ruins it. Instead of character development and a serious turn, you get more fanservice and the major characters being blatantly shat on leaving them to be otaku bait and little else. The plot is a series of unlikely events strung together by out of character moments and pure idiocy.  It's all very transparent and unconvincing, you can see where the plot is heading since the characters or plot elements introduced have no other function than to look pretty/cool, or quickly force the next setting change.  For a similar experience, pick the lamest kind of fanfiction made by a sour waifufag.        It actually ended a couple of years ago, that image is outdated    Some stuff is moved around, some details are changed, there are some new scenes added, but it's more like decompression. It stays on point but takes longer.    The distinction you draw is entirely arbitrary and has little to do with any of the arguments presented.  You can easily make up Venn diagrams that shows overlap or box them in logical frameworks, but the indisputable fact remains that despite your framework, they still affect each other as far as perception and understanding (or lack thereof) goes.  Hence your interaction with any group or community on what you consider Evangelion will also be touched if not entirely overwritten by the rest of what EVA is.        god speed you magnificent bastard    really? so almost 10 years just to describe the events of 24 episodes of anime? there either must have been a slow release schedule or its a bunch of filler    The author took his time, and in the end it looks like he gave up. The two last volumes or so have a horrible story/plot, and the art quality drops severely.    No joke, there's 14 volumes and almost no original plots. Some episodes are even outright ignored instead of adapted at all.    You mean almost 20, right?  Start: Dec 26, 1994   End: Jun 4, 2013       How is the distinction arbitrary? NGE is its own work. EoE is it's own work. The Rebuilds are their own work. NGE 2 is its own work. Yes, they effect each other in how people perceive each work. But that's true of literally everything you experience. So unless you are saying that babies should be put into sensory deprivation chambers and kept away from all human contact until they are old enough to watch cartoons so their experiences don't spoil NGE, this problem will always exist.     overrated shit      How is the distinction arbitrary? NGE is its own work. EoE is it's own work. The Rebuilds are their own work. NGE 2 is its own work  Because you drew the line where you wanted it to be drawn - like you said they are their own works. The distinction is therefore arbitrary. Because when you refer to Evangelion, or Eva as we called it at first, you refer to it all - not just what you arbitrarily define as Evangelion.  Spare me your strawmen and weak justifications. Generalizing this as "but that's true of everything" only serves to prove my point on a broader scale. Saying that it'll always exist (which is true) also completely defeats your earlier standpoint - what are you even thinking here?   Now that's established that the works do affect each other on the level of understanding, interpretation and in terms of how the community around it acts, and that they all contribute to defining what we call "Evangelion", we can get to the actual point that matters.  The fact that it's going quite down the drain in terms of quality, to the point where you're idealistically pretending that only NGE and EoE exists when you think of "Eva".   Things like merchandising and so on is a natural consequence of the show's popularity - now this is where we start considering how much additions affect the overall gestalt of the franchise.   People are generally understanding of merchandising and are mostly immunized to it - it's viewed as lesser than and more or less irrelevant to the core of Evangelion. VN's, games and manga are a step up. Add influence if they're penned by the original authors.   <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127162573#p127181511">Click here</a> to view the full text.                   Oh shit! It's happening!  man, I wish show will continue doing those shocked faces,    I just hope that they'll get back together   Extremely unlikely. He is far too underdeveloped as a character for that.      Should I read this?    Get on it. Chapters are really short anyway.    Yes, if you enjoy cute adults doing cute things. Though there is a lot of stretching involved, which you can skip of course.   382 days to go  Soon be at that year mark   pretty sure that line only applied when it was originally said in the manga, but I'll take any excuse for SZS threads       How do Zerofags exist? I don't get it. It boggles the mind. Every fight in Zero feels like something from Naruto (He caught his sword and used it to deflect the other one!), and the plot is like a less mature version of Fate but with Heaven's Feel for an ending. This is ignoring that Zero is full of shitty CGI.  Even after Ufotable decided to remake UBW into the same sort of adaptation as Fate/Zero, Zerofags manage to actually bitch about UBW and how it isn't as "smart" or "mature" as their shitty spinoff.    It'd be cool if there was a cliff notes version that had like 30% less internal monologuing about breakfast.  Getting sick and tired of type/coon rehashing the fate series over and over again. Move onto something new.    Everything else was due to the circumstances and explained thoroughly, which is why I'm surprised we keep having so many "Why didn't X just Y" threads for it.  Why be surprised? Every other day there's a "What the fuck did I just watch" thread for EoE, and people still think Light was a dumb person acting rationally.     Because people don't fucking pay attention. Literally all you have to do is read the VN and that means actually read itm but apparently this is too hard for some people.    Expanding upon the Nasuverse is interesting.       Why don't we rehash Tsukihime?   Why does she look so angry?   She doesn't. </blockquote>]
