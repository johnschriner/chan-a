[ How in the hell did her mother not notice any bruises or marks from all the abuse she went through?  hit on head   Wrists are tied   duct tape on mouth   hit on face repeatedly   strangled   raped  For fuck sake, why did her mother not think anything was wrong?         Kids like to roughhouse  when did her mother even come back?   Lolis WILL be lolis, after all.   Reach for the stars UFO-kun    UFO-kun   looks like an Ayy  I thought this anime is about band (drama)?     Bow before the most special one!  Literally perfect.   i heard that she is going to be relevant next episode    source on that please   No. Remove ayys.   pls   Reminder     Kitauji concert band power levels     Oboe-chan  -- POWER GAP --   Asuka    Midori    Reina            She's the least cute one in her section.   Would you a Reinyaa    but she's also the most talented one in the entire band  Reina can only dream of reaching her brilliance        but she's also the most talented one in the entire band  Most likely. I'm amazed that she is the only oboe and there is no drama based on her. She practically keeps the band together.     The second novel says otherwise     and there is no drama based on her  next season     I just can't see this girl with cold, dead eyes having any energy left in her to create drama.     Oboe chan has a solo part a solo part in Crescent Moon Dance, and probably has one in Providence of the Wind. Since the next episode is literally the music episode, they'll probably give her direct screen focus for when she plays.     She won't be the one creating it, someone else will set it off  but she will be the center of it     I'm going to marry Aoi chan and tell her she was right    next season   Never;_;     Shuuichi the Shitlord   You won't. I will.     She's a runaway bride waiting to happen.    Any more context about how? She has been just doing her job so far.   the Reina lines that weren't translated  Kumiko   What did you just say?   Hey   What did you mean by you were alone with Taki sensei?   hold on, listen, Kumiko!         Right about compensated dating bringing in much needed spending money?    You shut your whore mouth.    But I'm not Aoi.     I really hope we get a S2, then.  This world needs more Oboe-chan.      /u/fags BTFO yet again, how are they holding up?  So we're not getting any KyoAni before next winter season?   How dare you    This is probably the most normal both these girls have behaved in the entire show. Development.    Ribbons burns all of her reeds the night before the big concert so that there will be one less person who is more talented than Kaori in the performance.   Still best girls.   But it was hetfags that were BTFO by that scene. Reina was clearly jealous about her girlfriend Kumiko spending time with a man.     A novelfag said a while back that her friend is the one who got all the current second years riled up and got everyone to quit.       normal being good   ever     Who best girl here?   Oh yeah I remember that. But still can't see if that's enough to just base S2 around.  Oboe-chan looks fragile though     Oh ufo or some say eupho Do you hear our prayers Grant us gud Grant us gud       The fagotts are smiling because they know they're the best.    They'll probably announce their Fall show soon.    Oboe chan using those hard reeds, like a champion.    How can one section be so based?    It definitely helps that all three have great, unique designs, especially when comparing their section to the b-teams like the horns and clarinets.     Has this show sparked a musical interest in anybody else?  Actually listening to Oboe solos right now     well the second novel has may components, but it's the more SOL volume of the three  main focus is beating Kansai tournament    main drama is that Nozomi (girl with the flute) comes back and Mizore (Oboe), gets kind of unsettled because of last year's incident. They were best friends.   -Asuka is completely against Nozomi coming back to the club  large focus on Taki sensei's past since his university friends come as assistant advisers   This is padded out by  Reina and Kumiko hanging out more (another festival arc)   Reina stalking Taki sensei in her free time   everyone goes to the pool   band camp arc where things totally do not get kind of gay  -Reina going yandere when one of Taki sensei's friends from university is an extremely attractive woman that Taki gets along well with, whom everyone calls Taki sensei's girlfriend                Unique character desing   Good characteristics   Playing based instruments   Talented and have an ear for music  If anyone from the band is going to have a music career this section has the highest chance.        concert band   no keyboards at all   how common is this?       do not get kind of gay  Do they super gay?      no keyboards   Keyboards  What?      same here. Today I spotted a girl playing her oboe near my uni and I looked at her trough the window thinking to myself "she must be a fucking talented bitch".    muh harpsichord.     Getting interested in music because of a Chinese cartoon      Reina going yandere   What? what does she do?     I don't remember seeing the harpischord in orchestras that much let alone concert bands.    Piano?    I haven't picked up my Oboe since high school but I kind of want to give it a go and see if I can still play.     everyone goes to the pool  Please KyoAni. Please.     No. Last time KyoAni went to the pool, they redid it 8 times.    nah, that would honestly be too much fanservice.   eventhough i'd love to see sapphire-chan in sukumizu        a piece of entertainment influences a person's attitude towards something in life  oh no surely that is unheard of   if you don't like anime you probably shouldn't be on /a/, or at least don't project your inferiority complex regarding anime onto others        Reminder that Midori has always been shooting for the moon.     Asuka is completely against Nozomi coming back to the club  About time she voiced an opinion.     but that's a lie  she went to this school specifically so she could turn her tryhard mode off      What a slacker      I want to hear her play Gabriele's Oboe. What oboe solos are you listening to?     Oboe solo   Not listening to based fagott concertos       What are you a bunch of fagotts or something?     She's mastered music. Now she wants to have meaningful friendships instead of around a band of Asuka's all the time.    I just like onsen episodes more.    Best of the best. Taki must be proud of them.   I'm happy to see that even when horribly depressed, Kumiko has still got it   Concert bands by definition don't have pianos or other keyboards, except for special cases of solo instrumentation.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YHY<wbr>WAXFvs0Q</wbr>  [ ] OST preview    I'm surprised the sister's reaction was rather mild. She must've been a slacker.   I love how Kyoani killed yuri for good with this show. Girls never love girls and not be unloved villains.    No Funiculi Funicula  Why would you do this to me?     What can you say when you get btfo that hard by your imouto?    Slap the shit out of her?      Well at least I'm not completely flat.      She fell into the trap most band geeks fall into if they don't get gud, they're parents pull them out to focus on study so they can actually do something with their life. sis failed and is bitter and keeps taking it out on kumiko    Both fagotts are just 10/10 character designs    Risky card to play, given she was still flat in her third year   BASSOON-CHAN WHEN?

Spin-off having the Double reed section as the main cast never  Why are you wasting such godly designs KyoAni?     Why, because she didn't stupidly let her daughters waste time and money in something that wasn't going to earn them a living when they get older? I mean, let's be real, Even through Kumiko is good, she's not professional level good, even through in the novels she wins nationals with her band and gets a man, that's not as good as a education.    No, I mean she's just not that cute.

Plus she's got two more years of high school to get even better. If Kitauji stays nationally competitive for those years I see no reason why she couldn't get into a good music program and pursue a professional career.     she's beating sticks on a surface I mean    You're making them unconfortable.Please leave.     band camp arc where things totally do not get kind of gay   How not kind of gay does it get?      Sometimes she bashes two things together.    If they win the nationals that makes her one of the best in her nation. She might even get offers from musicals schools if she wishes to go that way.   After Reina's confession I wonder how awkward it'll be for Taki to be around her. He'll probably leave Kitauji .   Sure thing, buddy.    I hope she does decide to try for a music school   Reina as some grade A autism eh    implying he doesn't already know       SLACKER SLUT     But after Reina confession she'll probably be more blunt around him, since she already let her feelings out so there's nothing to hide. she'll grab his ass and wink at him. he'll be scared shitless    [ReinForce] Hibike!

Ribbon: I don't want to hear that from someone wearing such a shitty t-shirt with a lame design  Natsuki is wearing a black t-shirt under her track suit  Natsuki: What's lame about my shirt?

What? Reina clearly was jealous because her Kumiko was alone with a filthy lecherous man at night.  Yea.  That must be the reason, the sole reason.       Time for a WEG thread.  Post WEGs.      Freshly made OC  Is there one for LOGH?   Make it yourself  Here, I'm even giving you the template           The last one barely died a few hours ago.         I love it     ;_;     Pretty much all I can recall of that movie is:   Don't do the thing I told you to do which would fix everything, Shinji   I'm going to do it anyway   ...I must go now, my people need me          this is what punchline fags actually think       still the greatest ride I ever rode      I don't get it.    I don't see the relationship between those. And I've watched/played both multiple times.    Shit, what's the name of this again?    They're both pretty cuh-razy and they both utilize character songs as an important theme (I'm convinced that Armstrong's fight wouldn't have been half as great without STANDING HERE)    welcome to WEG, the YLYL of /a/      Wolf Children   anyone have a Trigun WEG?   Oh lordy... food shows are torture sometimes.     4 and something around here   see this    Fuck you.         Kill la Kill tried too hard to be the new Gurren Lagann and Prometheus tried too hard to be the new Alien, I know is shitty but I was bored.    That's not really how WEGs work, pal          Prometheus actually had good lore. Klk just shoved everything to the garbage as the show went on.       The fights weren't good in symphogear, and neither was the music, so how did you get Revengeance?   Reposting from last thread     Too true.    Get rekt kiddo          Any more for stuff from this season?          If you had read the source you would have expected what it is. Animeonlyfags are cancer. Kill yourself.    Is this even good? I watch eps 1 when it came out but i thought it looked like crap so i quit.          One of the few shows that continues to make me mad to this day.   something saved from previous threads   The manga was better        I agree. Regardless of the ending though, i have to congratulate them on animating it well while remaining faithful to the manga's strange artstyle.   I don't know why, but it always bugs me when the anime people expect is newer than the show. I know everyone doesn't watch stuff as it airs (hell, I've got a giant backlog) but it still irks me for some dumb reason.   Can you rephrase that? I have no idea what you are trying to say.    So from what I gathered Plastic Memories isn't my long awaited Japanese Blade Runner, but is it worth watching or should I just go rewatch GitS?    Do you like series like AnoHana, SaiKano and Kanon? If not, go rewatch GitS. Plastic Memories is a melodrama with a thin veneer of SF with bullshit like the robots having souls.      Heh, sorry, I've been up way too long. I dislike it when the "what I expected show" is newer than the "what I watched". Like if you watched Haruhi and expected Lucky Star.      Oooh, i concur. On the other hand, i haven't watched nearly enough anime to be able to call anons out on that.          So it's FFIX: The Anime?  Sign me the fuck up.        No fuck you. Seriously fuck you. You fucks kept reposting this to the point that when I started watching it, I assumed I was in for some harrowing experience. When I saw the cute little moe girl doing cute little moe things, I thought she was going to get blown apart by a tank shell by the third episode.   And of fucking course all it is is fucking moeshit.       he didn't watch episode 7   he didn't make it to the end of the series  laughingwotos.gif      That's pretty good     Babylon 5   I'm tempted now.      Don't. The first episode was great, but the rest of it is downhill from there.     The atmosphere created in the first episode gets  shattered  by the end.       Only bad thing is that Meliodas have not even ounce of Zidane's charm    Anime gave me aidschan   my favourite weg   It's completely wrong though.      It's still of haram    Sonydicked    Gainax is dead, Love live TRIGGER    I want more of Nagate and Izana interactions on the ship - as long as progress is made. Those episodes were great.     Degeneracy      I don't even /pol/       I don't get it.    Is this a new troll method? I don't even understand what you're trying to imply.   ITT: shitty tumblr gif's.    Is second raid any better?      not liking Tessa  The fuck?    It was just perfect    liking that unsuited for life white-haired piece of shit             I'll fight you, fag    FMP would not work without the school episodes. They're what makes Sousuke's character development have impact later.  And also speaking as a Chidorifag, Tessa is a miracle, fuck you.        Watched -- YuYuYu Expected -- Cozy SOL Got -- Mahou shoujo suffering I think that's completely reasonable.       Of course, but it's the Taisha/Shinju who're responsible for the suffering.  Gyuuki dindu nuffin      Chidori is also meh for me  Anyways is second raid worth watching?              Shiki was such a great ride. Especially because I didn't know am I getting into, it was pretty much a mystery for the first couple of episodes.      Watching Ergo Proxy right now. Does it ever get good?    Now this is how you put more than one image in a panel.    It basically doesn't even count as more than one image because he essentially made a single entirely new image using snippets of others.      Nope.    Strangely I don't care much about the fanservice in this show because of the damn food. Makes me hungry as fuck.  And then I realise I can't cook.      Jesus, I just got hungry literally right after I stopped eating because I was totally full.    Ergo Proxy is not for kids    This is literally perfect.    Huh? What does Lucky Star have to do with Haruhi other than the protagonist liking the anime?      Sure, sure. But does it ever stop being 2deep4me vaguely relevant philosophical discussions in an excessively gloomy post-apocalyptic landscape? The first two episodes had me hooked but now it's becoming a drag.    The 16th episode (Dead Calm) is excellent. The rest of the series is dull as fuck    See<br/>    It gets good when best girl appears.  Also this, it's basically the only episode I remember.       Okay, I see. Does the ending at least provide some payoff?     It's basically Big Event + Close Call + MC Makes The Right Choice and it's all wrapped in the usual 2deep4me atmosphere     no utah yet?     The whole 15 minute per episode thing is what turned me off   Can someone post a FATE one?    Anyone have the other one?  Mandatory.     nailed it. Now I know why I enjoyed nanatsu despite of being not a fan of fighting shounen.     Guu is the magic mushrooms of anime?       someone didn't make it to ep. 7    I don't get it.     If you had read the source you would have expected what it is.  Not that anon, but that hardly would've made it any less awful. It didn't even pass as my "I'm so bored and need to fill the time with anything" series this season.     Not that anon, but I didn't either. I couldn't sit through 7 episodes of K-ON designs.    That's one bad case of shit taste you have there, friend.    Underrated one    Are you joking?    Barakamon any good?      because it was so bad right?    It's a simple and straightforward action adventure fantasy, but it does what it does well without biting off more than it can chew.      Would have accepted DQ VII also but you passs     the futa   Wait, what?      soo... in the end you get trope abuse? get every trope explained?    The show often breaks the 4th wall and points out tropes or parodies them.     Can't wait for mission 3     This one?    Are you implying fights in MGRR were actually good? Because they weren't.    its healing  no moeblob shit         Muh wotos!     Not muh wotos.           FUCK MY SIDES        There is absolutely no purpose in posting one with the same three images in each panel.    School eps were good tessa a shit      good     futa  Izana can be anything you want, darling!     Prisma Illya was already posted, faggot no penis.     moeshit implies that it was fun     he means the epic ones not that moeshit   Such a waste of time    I'm butthurt VNfag  Your taste is secondary. Go cry in /jp/       epic       Be more concise.     The fights weren't good in symphogear  Did you watch it blindfolded?     Since when is reading an amazingly written VN secondary in /a/?    He died of cuteness    Woah woah woah woah woah.    Since hipsters got in and started hating on Fate and Nasu beceause Type Moon stuff is popular       Fate gay nite   amazingly written VN secondary in /a/?   That maymay is old, /b/ tard        amazingly written  I can't resist this bait. Its too much for me.      What is even your point, retard?    Bullshit. Even Nasu watches Prisma Illya. That's proof that your taste is worse than nips.      But it's true That you don't like it doesn't make it less true       I wanted to like it so much. Everything before the time skip was at least interesting to read. After that though, it just got tougher and tougher to want to sift through. Then the end...God damn that end.    This is all true and factchecked.      any Type-Moon thing   well written   hahaha  HAHAHAHA        Get that shit off /a/     Made this after finishing S2 today. Just in time for GX hype   When did I say I hated Prisma , retard? I love both Prisma (in fact , Drei is the only manga I'm following as it comes out) and F/SN      ha  Naruto has superior writing.      Type Moon hater   Is a stupid shitposter   sasuga       Strangely I don't care much about the fanservice in this show  This, when the fanservice go to a second plane, it means your series is fucking good.     You're talking about how the characters cried constantly right?    I hope you aren't serious, narutard    Tell that to janny who keeps deleting your shitty Fate threads, shiteater.     2015   being a hipster elitist.      Back to the containment thread you go.    He's doing his job wrong because worse threads are allowed, and deleting threads because he doesn't like the franchise is childish  Maybe it's because of all of the shitposts from the haters ,and the fans (VNfags and animefags both) Anyways, threads being deleted in an imageboard on the internet isn't at all proof of the series being bad         2015   Liking generic jumb battle shounenshit like narushit and DBShit      Is a poorly made "feels" anime. The feels feel fake and forced. Do not watch.     Damage control   "This not muh real Islam of peace!"   Keep crying.       But KlK was better than Gurren.   Donquixote Doflamingos funeral thread  In memorium of the worst One Piece villain who ever existed  In Memorium to a selfish narcissitic sob story cunt  I'm glad he got rightfully finished off by Luffy finally.         Chapter when?     no teeth missing  It hasn't ended yet      I'm glad he got rightfully finished off by Luffy finally.  This is what bugs me. Why Luffy and not Law? I am not a Law-fag but he has more personal reasons to defeat him.      I'm glad it's over. The fight with Doffy started nine months ago.   There are people alive today who were conceived after Cora-San was first mentioned by name.   Anyway, is it safe to say we get 2-3 wrap-up chapters, one where Jinbei and Wadatsumi meet up with Luffy, join his crew, and bring him to Zou, and then we start the "Nami and co meet Big Mom" arc?       Nami had more personal reasons to defeat Arlong.   The Skypiea people had more personal reasons to defeat Enel.   Vivi had more personal reasons to defeat Crocodile.   Chopper had more personal reasons to defeat Wapol.   Brook had more personal reasons to defeat Moria.   Shirahoshi had more personal reasons to defeat Hody.             http://www.sentinelandenterprise.co<wbr>m/breakingnews/ci_28362171/don-feat<wbr>herstone-creator-pink-flamingo-lawn<wbr>-ornament-dies  Daily reminder that Oda did this to foreshadow chapter 791  </wbr></wbr></wbr>    worst One Piece villain who ever existed  He's only 2nd place after Hody     this    in 18 hours    they asked Luffy, but Law didn't    Neither of them (aside Shirahoshi) had nearly enough power to defeat the villain,and Shirahoshi lacked the guts to do it.    Law already fucked Doffy over with his ultimate attack that wrecked his organs. Doffy just sewed himself back up so he could do some damage before he goes down.    Law conceded when his final attack failed.    As a matter of fact he even wanted to finish it by himself.  Yeah, because muh routine of Oda. He could as well wrote it so that Luffy assists Law to execute his revenge. This way it doesn't necessarily question Luffys status as Protagonist in this arc.        i-is it finally over?    He had more depth than Enel.   What does her perfume smell like?   Doffy is not dead yet. The BIrdcage is still up!  I don't think Luffy's King Kong Gun killed him, yet I think that Law's Gamma Knife will end up actually killing Doffy making it Law's victory. One way or another, it's over.  Unless Mansherry is captured by some random family member and bitchslapped over Doffy in order to have him rise again due to her healing tears (I would be most displeased).        Why did Crocodile let her to join BW?     God   needing depth  BLASPHEMY!!!!!!!      He was bored.    He knew she was the princess, right? Probably to keep her under his thumb.    Luffy knew Law needed him, there was no need to ask him.    Did he? I thought the BW members never got to see Mr. 0 or knew who he was until that one meeting and vice versa. Croco never dealt with the members until then because he was a shichibukai and was extra careful on keeping it under wraps. Only Robin and the unluckies dealt with the members directly. Robin probably knew but didnt tell Croco about it. Croco's loose connections with his members, even officers, was probably his biggest flaw. Easy to infiltrate like vivi did.  Unless I'm forgetting something, and he said that he knew she was miss wednesday all along or something.     GOOOODDDDDAAAAA   top kek     take over country   sent flying into the air  He really was just a watered down Crocodile.      Yeah, cause Law kicked Mingo's ass in the bridge, right? Or maybe Law could beat Doffy with the high mobility he has atm    Beacuse hes gonna be the very best, like no one ever was. The Pirate King, Believe it! :^]    You mean Crocodile is a watered down Doffy.     There are people alive today who were conceived after Cora-San was first mentioned by name.    wouldn't it be cool if Sanji did some sort of Mr. Prince tactic like he did in Alabasta?  I mean, he also disappeared for a long time in little garden and Alabasta. I hope Oda is planning something fun like that with him and the others.     Oda doesn't like Sanji anymore. He will never make him do something cool again.   It's not over yet, Doffy is still conscious   The last time we saw him, he was ready to fight against Big Mom's crew on their ship. At least that's what we're lead to believe. What if he went straight for the "spine" of the ship. If he did it fast enough, it could surprise any crew. Most people would expect a frontal assaul on the crew aboard the deck, not the actual fucking ship. He's strong enough to do it,  unless the ship has haki.  He did some massive damage to the ship, and BM's crew is now too busy to fix it. The SHs Coup de Burst the fuck away from them, so BM can't take their ship over and is now forced to stay in one place and fix the damage.  Sanji bought a fuckload of time for them to escape and he didn't have to embarrass himself against a Yonkou crew.        conscious   He's dead anon. Luffy actually killed him, no way he's still alive after taking such a hit.      Nah, it's most likely this.     He knew she was the princess, right?  No  The entire reason Croc's plan failed is because he didn't know any of his members       I'm assuming the second he even considers doing any of that a good chunk of the higher ranking crew members will stop him straight in his tracks. I can only guess that they will have some around the same tier as Marco / Jozu / Vista etc.     Crocodile   watered   heh       Miss Wednesday's version of Vivi was a huge bitch.       Check 'em  Fuck, those two were me and I didn't posting better reply.       Sanji can navigate just above the water surface, or even from below it. Also, it'd be a surprise to them too. Take the BB crew vs Magellan fight for example. People can absolutely be surprised by weaker enemies, if they time their shit right.    Is the birdcage gone in the last two panels, or is there just no background?.   We Kubo now.    Looks like it's gone. That bottom-center panel looks like it was specifically drawn to show that the birdcage disappeared. I can almost hear the "poof!".    when did that guy get that hat?    Looks like the same punchclouds, or whatever you call them, as in the panel above.    except that's retarded considering suger doesn't remember who the person used to be when she turns them into a toy    everybody other does not remember =/= Sugar does not remember too, of course limited and depents on who she wants to remember    she literally said she can't remember, speedreader detected or reddit    really? when?     yaoihands.jpg     I know. I think those punch clouds give it that extra effect.   How could Doffy use clouds for his Sky path? Clouds above sea are made from evaporated sea water. His DF power, the strings shouldn't be working.    He shouldn't even have a DF power, if you want to apply any logic to this. Which you shouldn't.     How could Aokiji froze the sea?     You remember sky islands and fossil clouds? That's where he attached his strings.   If Doflamingo could fasten the shrink of the Birdcage, why did he wait for so long?   And less boring.    Because unlike Crocodile, he is retarded.    Because he is sadistic, and wasn't needed to rush it. He enjoyed the screams and the people's despair.     In memorium of the worst One Piece villain who ever existed  salty Crocfag detected     sanji going downhill fast since ts   zoro is a swordsman marty-sue and will never use asura again   sabo's involvement in everything stops giving me any feeling of excitement   niggerfist combat will be every single fight now   female characters can't ever keep up, all get increased tit 'n ass meat for relevance   big mums ship is on hibernation mode and she has yet to actually feel as an emperor, sub at most         whine whine whine bitch bitch bitch sob sob sob       every single fight now  Except for all the fights that weren't.  can't keep up  Except when Robin caught Hakuba's sword in mid-air, proving she could do something nobody in the Colosseum who fought him could do.  sub at most  Eh?          implying Enel won't be back in the future with new lackeys, new powers and new flashbacks     In the future   Blackbeard vs Shanks   Epic fight ensues   Shanks is in the floor about to be killed by BB   Suddenly, a red cannonball hits BB   God Buggy saves Shanks    yfw             implying Buggy would ever enter the New World      having the powers to turn everything into sand   better usa a poisoned hook and then a fucking knife to kill the rubber guy   not retarded  Crocfags sure are a delusional bunch       But he did try to use a knife. Luffy broke it.    that is the point, why even use a knife and a poisoned hook when you have fucking sand df powers? he just stopped using them in their final fight for no reason at all.     get soaked in blood   can't turn to sand   no reason at all  And he did attack Luffy with Desert Spada.       If Luffy can break through his strings, why didn't he break the bird cage?    What is Ground Secco?    Because sand a shit, Luffy was just way faster than anything Croc could trow at Luffy, plus Liffy already knew about the dryeverything hand.    A move that leaves him open when he can't turn to sand.    Doffy was trying to keep up with the dwarves, the remaining bits of his crew, the colloseum fighters, the strawhats, law, the dressrosa loyalty, his innards imploding, the admiral, to stall for chapter 800, but he just couldn't do it long enough.     He learnt about awakening in Impel Down   From there he decided to work out how to awaken his own fruit    It gave him the power to break things down at a molecular level   he turns Blackbread into dust.        he could have dodged Luffys water and blood punches like Aokiji dodged when WB tried to pierce him at MF    No he couldn't. If he could've he'd have.   Trebol did nothing wrong.    implying he's not now trapped by his ego and reputation   implying he won't try to use his crew to gain more power and moneys   implying he won't be dragged to the NW to save face   The great one will return as flashily as ever. The retards who think this comedic relief clown will ever be a legit threat are deluding themselves, though.  Inb4 hurr durr slit into atoms Roger's crew learned haki durr hurr           It shouldn't be that easy, so far and out of all the logia users in the series only Aokiji could pull that shit right.    He fell for Robin's clever disguise at first.    it was the same when he used it in round 2 on the roof, Luffy had water und was not faster then he was in the final round    Why didn't he turn the entire ground into running sand? After that Luffy's speed would be irrelevant.    further proof that Croc is a low-tier fruit user and forever inferior to Doffy     the dressrosa loyalty  How?     *not slower    Whoops, meant to say royalty.     If Luffy can break through his strings  Nope, he just ripped them by stretching. It's different from break them through.     he fell for Laws provocations   So is this guy dead /a/?   he let Usopp take down Sugar    Hopefully. All of Doffy's executives were hatable but this guy the most.    because the birdcage strings are countless entangled strings, some invisible strings were able to completely stop Jozu, how strong do you think are the thick cage strings then?    And the plot hole still left, because it wasn't explained why some of the Doffy family wore chains. In the flashbacks it was shown they weren't slaves.    I am satisfied with the outcome of this fight. At least it showed how far Luffy still is from reaching Doffys level.   to be fair, nobody could have predicted that tatabasco bullshit happening     why  Fashion. Ever heard of it?     yep in the last chapter he was quite literally above him    Usopp cut him with his shurikens. He was lucky, that they didn't hit his tiny body.    Still wasn't explained what the human disease was, how could some of the toys have they own wills (like Onepoco), why should the toys return every night to the Toy House, etc.    who else wore chains? buffalos weren't cuffs     why should the toys return every night to the Toy House  because it was part of the contract     Epik memer. Its time to accept that Oda made it pretty clear how strong Doflamingo is compared to Luffy. One of the two received infinite amounts of handholding during the arc. Guess which one.  Its actually kinda sad that we will never get fullpower vs fullpower fight. Apart from Moria all other arc villains got one.      I hope only solid logias can do that, it would be OP for gaseous or energy logias to do it.     Drying out an entire plateau with 1 hand   Creating sandstorms that can move by themselves across an entire country   The first one to introduce the concept of awakening   Can create entire whirlpools out of sand  He isn't a low-tier fruit user, he is just weak when it comes to actually having a reason to fight, which as we all know, in One Piece directly correlates to strength and capability in combat.        The problem with this whole storyline was that Croc can drain liquids/water. Blood isnt anything else but water with a bunch of elements mixed into it so theres no reason why he shouldnt be able to just absorb the water from the blood so he can turn back into sand.  Its impossible that he would risk to absorb all his blood by doing so or else the whole 'I turn into my element' wouldnt even be possible in the first place.      I really liked the idea, that he's a more imoprtant person who only pretends to be an idiot. But he was just a disappointment just like the other officers.     his willpower got rekt by WB     Epik memer.  there wasn't meme  Its time to accept that Oda made it pretty clear how strong Doflamingo is compared to Luffy.   Even though he couldn't handle g4  Its actually kinda sad that we will never get fullpower vs fullpower fight.  they both gave everything they had last chapter         He told Sugar he wasn't going to die. He's smarter than he acts.     how could some of the toys have they own wills  because Onepoco was not a slave toy, there were plenty of normal toys in the city while others worked underground for 10 years straight. and he being able to talk to toy kyros does not mean he had his own will.      Trebol   Dying  BAHAHAHAHA      The strongest man. Yup, not really surprised there, actually I think his will was mostly lost when he realised Robin would never give him the location of the Ancient Weapon    I am actually fucking glad he did not turn out to be a mastermind who manipulated Doffy to reach his own goals or some shit. too fucking cliched and it would have downgraded Doffy.     Kizaru and Akainu could do the same thing against Whitebeard and Marco/GayStache respectively. Seems to be a logia only power.     He was being able to talk Franky and explained everything about his wife and son. He clearly had his own will. Plus the "normal" toys were slaves to, they work was just different, they had to hang out with the citizens. That was their job.    Why didn't he use the cage's level of strings on Luffy?     they had to hang out with the citizens  yes, and that is why Onepoco did not have his own will, if he had he could have gone anywhere he wanted      invisible  implying they were really invisible and weren't just for delaying the reveal of Doffy's fruit power    Everyone is over looking two aspects of crocodile. One, he had retreated from the grand line and seeked power through external means, rather than constantly improving himself. Two, he had been using his powers to stop the rain. He stocked up the rain powder shit to frame the royal family but he didn't use it, and the drought wasn't natural. Croc and Moria both used to be stronger until a defeat ruined their confidence, making them leave the grand line and trying to gain power elsewhere.   But he did. He went away to talk to Franky about his past.    with invisible I mean not visible for the eye because they are extremely thin    they didn't left Grand Line, just the New World    I think they were visible for the characters but not for the manga readers.    Actually Croc headed to the New World, though he might have left and I'm missing something.    Because plot reasons. Oda realized that he made Doffy too retarded strong so he came up with stuff like Gamme Knife to make his defeat remotely believable. As far as we know Luffy only was able to beat Doffy because he was infected with lightning fast AIDS, had to fight countless gladiators, hax power law, other powerful pirate crews, organized a mass genocide while fighting and had to chase Luffy while he was shielded by hundreds of people who literally sacrificed themselves for him.  We will never know how the fight would have turned out if all of this stuff hadnt happened. My guess concerning the birdcage strings is that they are too stiff and think to just used them as a tool for pupperty. Dont ask me why he cant create a smaller birdcage though.      Arabasta and Thriller Bark/Florian Triangle are still located at Grand Line, so they didn't left it.    Thats just illogical considering how many people didnt understand what the fuck was going on when he used his powers. If they were able to see the strings then they would also know that he attached them to clouds and Law wouldnt have to tell them.    no he didn't, he talked to toy soldier and Franky was just listening to what he says in the background and he was near his wife and son the whole time     Dont ask me why he cant create a smaller birdcage though.  maybe he can but it would not have done him any good against Luffy since it takes some time to create    Man what was Oda smoking during Impel Down? Everything is weird.    Everything is weird.  welcome to One Piece     That's not Buggy.    well they found out he was crocodile so its possible he could have known as well    This and Doffy has to be at the center when creating Birdcage, he can't just form a cage out of strings wherever he wants, at least not without a string clone. He would have to stand directly in front of someone to trap him inside a small one.      what is Magelan suposed to be? human?    Probably as human as Moria.    Why do people give so much attention to Urouge?     Oda planned Doflamingo's defeat and death 10 years ago   he knew that the creator of the pink flamingo lawn ornament had Lewy body dementia and would be dying before 2020   he dies on the EXACT same day that the chapter Luffy lands the final blow on Doflamingo is officially released in Japan   all of the shitty unnecessary stuff that happened on Dressrosa was just to sync up death dates since Oda needed to pad the arc until the guy was about to die  It all makes sense now. Oda is literally a fucking god for doing this. I forgive all of the frodos, plot holes, jobs, and oneshots of Dressrosa. One Piece is literally poetry.        I think it's this https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Anc<wbr>wu_9KFTk</wbr>  [ ]     Because permanent trollface and because he's a cool guy without being edgy or tryhard.    Yes, human, the horns are fake and the wings are part of his uniform    the chapter gets officially released in Japan on the 29th though     I forgive all of the frodos, plot holes  list them please      crocodile never succeeded in taking over Alabasta   yet Doflamingo, who reigned over his for 10 years, and probably inspired Crocodile to take over his own country, is the watered down version  Look, I love Crocodile but Doflamingo is clearly superior in that aspect.      he meant new world    Those aren't New World Locations     Permanent shit eating grin   Faced down Kizaru with Apoo and X Drake without giving a fuck   His DF/Power is literally just sweet gains  He's just cool, man.       Buggy is almost 40 year old  How does it make you feel?    So, all supernovae ate a devil fruit, except Zoro, right?  What did Killer eat?      Spaghetti.    Killer didn't eat a devil fruit as far we know.  I think hes going to be a rival to Zoro however.     Luffy would have been able to escape Impel Down with ace if he hadnt jobbed to magelan   Zoro is literally yonkou-tier now. How would Killer even go toe to toe with him unless Zoro pulls the &gt;muh not even trying shit again?    Zoro yonko tier.  Yeah...      Oda will nerf the fuck out of Zoro when it comes to the fight with Killer because tension.    where did you get this idea? just because Zoro has shit stomped all Post-TS opponents so far, doesnt mean the trends gonna continue till he fights a Yonko   Would Luffy become a yonkou after the next (main) arch?   He had his own free will because Sugar forgot to say the "you will obey me bla bla" shit  Do you guys even read the manga     Major fight rankings:  Lucci &gt; Oars &gt; Crocodile &gt; Arlong &gt; Doflamingo &gt; Enel &gt; Shit &gt; Hody     Nah, I'm expecting a less strenuous arc now similar to Skypeia, without any Yonkou involvement. Luffy definitely won't end up as Yonkou himself at least until endgame, if at all.   I remember when people thought that Doffy is admiral level or even above.   yeah, in the end he really was.    he is though. It took an entire fucking island to take him down   If Doffy had fought seriously at the Marineford, I think the Marines + Shichibukai could even destroy Whitebeard's as well as Shank's crew as well.   They're headed for Wano by the end of the year. Wano is Japan themed. Luffy is King Kong Kaido is Godzilla or Godzilla-equivalent(ie: Typhon-zoan, another dinosaur)  Kaido is going to be in Wano so we can have King Kong vs Godzilla          as well as Shank's crew as well.  yeah no      implying  He was clearly shown to be inferior even to Fujitora, and Fuji is the weakest admiral by a wide margin.      Luffy won this fight all by himself  Thanks for reminding me      he was clearly shown to be inferior even to Fujitora  are you retarded mate?     It might be tough, and the Marine would be destroyed in the process, but I think they could do it.  Doffy's awakened fruit is just too strong AoE.       He was clearly shown to be inferior even to Fujitora  literally when?   Yeah after law took doffy's organs out        you are implying doffy &gt; Shanks whole crew m8 that's not how it works     I don't know if you noticed, but Fujitora is currently sweating all over his body because a certain cage is owning him.    That's impossible. No way Buggy could grab her tits, His hands should just slip off.     Doffy's awakened fruit is just too strong AoE.   while that is true, we know absolutely nothing about what shanks' crewmates are capable of. So I think going as far as to say they could have been defeated like that is a pretty far fetched assumption      yfw luffy has more gears than the amount of times asura has been used     Yeah after law took doffy's organs out  Not even then, thats why I made the post. He still required handholding from the entire island, including thousands of people. Multiple dozens of them even sacrificed their own lives to make sure he gets another shot.  Never before has a character received this much handholding. Ok, maybe he did in Marineford.       Good. Asura is dumb.     Doffyfagsbtfo retards in a nutshell.     still no new spoilers  Why are leaks so slow in the past few months for OP? Even this week they're slow for everyone.    It's almost like Luffy is the main character or something    whats up with yall wating Zoro to use asure?   when robin was introduced as being the potential assassin of the crew, I was expecting her to become a badass as shit silent killer with hands and feet shenanigans  I was a fool.   holy shit no. Why would he?        I think Shanks' crew is much like Shanks himself.  Most of them are probably Haki monsters. It would be impossible to defeat them with raw strength, which is probably why Kaidou backed off.  You would need unconventional devil fruit hax like Law or Sugar to deal with that stuff.         It's been shown since enies lobby, and then it kinda died out save for 1-2 times.  Luffy and sanji use their gears, diable/spectrum all the fucking time, this is the new world baby.  Zoro is like; Lol i'll just use my old moves x10, and later x100.  There is not a single indication to his level.           yeah, I have the same impression for some reason, and that's what makes it seem way scarier than the other yonko's crews, even kaido's mysterious zoan army.    It's okay anon, we couldn't predict the SJWs were right about Oda.    Because girl in a little boys manga, oda got married, and uh....ara ara?     Spoilers already   Neat.      [HorribleSubs] Ore Monogatari!! - 12 [720p].mkv   slut  Suna! Call the police! Takeo was violated!  Is it hamsterbanana time?  You should use spoilers for NSFW content.   No you shouldn't. That's explicitly against the rules.    Yes you should. That's explicitly follows the rules.      Spoilered pornography or other "not safe for work" content is NOT allowed on the work safe boards.       I like how Suna was scared when Takeo came in his room asking for a favour. You could really hear it in his voice.  so did everyone drop this?   Yamato was too much of a slut.    Nope it's just there are more people with shit taste watching shows like hibike   Oh baby its time  I haven't seen the episode but allow me to get   kyaaaaaaa   kyaaaaaaaaaa   SUKIDA   for 20 minutes   no plot or characters in sight   Suna sighs because he hates being here          Takeo's dad would be a handsome man if it weren't for his all black eyes. He looks frightening.   Incoming doujin were he cucks his son    Anon please. Takedad wants his women with some meat on her bones. Also I'm sure his wife could beat the shit out of him if he tried    the people on /a/ are way too mature for shows like this    No but most people are going to let it finish then marathon it. It's a good show but it just kinda drags at some parts   Suna is really giving me more and more gay vibes.   mfw this season    You marathon romcoms or else they aren't as good    I'm watching but I rarely drop by on the threads.    with the others, waiting to marathon it   Yamato's mannerisms were so damn cute this episode   I wish I could marathon it, but I can't help but watch it now. It's too damn good      Man I really like this anime. In most romances it is some normal, nice guy, with above average grades dating a pure girl who would never imagine doing sexual things.  In Ore Monogatari, though, the protagonist is not some decent student but a really tough jock who gets all the women to like him. He doesn't go for nice girls but prefers to fuck sluts who want to hold hands with him and do things to him when he sleeps.     When is the new girl going to appear and NTR that slut Yamada    implying they won't both cuck their son for Yamato    Chapter 35 next month, release probably on 13th or 19th.  Chapter 34 end was Mero being recalled, Darling saving the princess?   Also no more news about the adaptation, just MON designs and VA left.       There's no such thing as a correct version of a myth.  Cerea is also a cute dork.      Cool your head, anon, they're just puns. No need to lose your mind over them.     Dullahan mythology also says that anyone who sees a Dullahan is doomed to perish soon.  Her bio said that Dullahans had been sighted near sites of lethal accidents and talking to old men in nursing homes.      Now to be fair I thought she was hanging around there because of all the near death experiences "darling" seems to be subjected to.     Never caught the covered wagon before...   Dawn of The Final Day 9 Hours Remain   wkwk  Will Gainax deliver?  I'm scared. I don't want it to end.    No opening   Insert of full version of Stella-rium when Subaru starts to fix everything   You heard it here first folks. My dead finacee worked at GAINAX       finacee      I don't want this ride to end either    Hva you bought strawberry milk for the last episode, /a/?  Please let them remain together in their universe even after the alien and their powers have gone, Gainax!   Like I said, I'm lactose intolerant.     3 hours left     You mean 6. 7,5 until HS.   Hopefully we will get another kissu.   one episode left     KinMoza and SB69 are over   Pleiades to end soon   Etotama and DanMachi will follow too  It it not an end. Just a transformation.        DanMachi will follow  It's not all bad news then.     Danmachi was good.    Good for what it is perhaps, but that's not saying much.    It really wasn't.    Danmachi is just a LN advertisement. The booty in it was good though.    Hestia could only keep me going for four episodes before I dropped it.    Good.  So i can marathon the shit out of this in the mid-seasons week of nothingness.       not being white    Both excited to see how it ends, and sad that it's ending. Somehow this series felt like Gainax really put a lot of heart into making it.   I can't be the only one doing a marathon rewatch before the finale, right?     1 hour 25 minutes remain    I want Gyate Gyate of the Houkagos.     There's no time. I'm re-watching Aquarion and Symphogear.    Until what? It's 80 minutes left according to anichart, but in previous threads, images start appearing 4 hours from now, and HS is out one hour after that.    So is anichart wrong?    Yeah.    Zettai! I've actually done it throughout the past Week because of Work Schedule.   Nanoko's song is so beautiful. So glad I downloaded the singles for the OP and ED.  Where's the stream? Yucie and Neet are dead for me.    Preview https://<span>youtu.be/QEGqRYax6Lk  [ ]   inb4 ends with Subaru opening a door    a fucking black hole   Minato and Subaru together   I'm getting hype.      So 1 hour or 3 hours till it airs? Can I marathon it in time?    3 hours, but you won't have enough time to marathon in   Dat parallel universes. Dat fountain.   I think anin has enough time as long as he is not planning to watch the livestream and wait for subs instead     The spaceship appeared  So the earth is fucked? Inb4 time travel.     3:30 until it airs, 5 hours until subs. You can make it. Just don't get distracted and don't check the thread.       Okay thanks anons.   Enjoy your finale          You are in a car advert thread.   The OST is out today.  It's a shame the characters look washed out.   Hestia is the worst part of Danmachi and not what makes it good.   Reminder: by buying banana milk you are a filthy Bananaraffe xeno scum and you should be purged.   The animation looked way better in the pilot too. Wish they would have kept some of that fluidity in the show     flavored milk  Straweberyy is meme flavor tbh.      meme flavor  What does it even mean?    Futaba thread?   Ironic shitposting is still shitposting.    Yes    /sp/ pls.   volume 2 cover   The weakest part of this show is definitely the animation and art, which is a pity because it means the limited staff cannot fully portray the vast magnitude and grandiosity of the distances and celestial objects that the characters experience.  For example, while pic related was a great moment in the anime due to timing, dialogue and voice acting, it was just a few simple pans of a plain empty landscape and a starry sky, nothing even close to the level of fascinating alien geography that the concept art shows.  Due to the awful budgeting, this is actually one anime where I'm thankful that the staff chose to use extensive CGI for action cuts. Seeing the (3D) characters fly in dynamic ways with interesting choreography is a great distraction from the stasis and lack of movement in the 2D sequences. Had they chosen to animate solely in 2D for the flight sequences, the tragic lack of budget would have been a lot more egregious.        When was pic related used again?    Leaked art. It was the episode with the supernova.   Subaru is subarashii.  Just a reminder we have 7 contestants. Someone  probably Aoi  will be alone, or third wheel.  Okay /u/, riddle me this. We know why prez looks like a blue titty, but how come girls other than Nanako see him as that?     /u/      /u/     Why don't you fuck off and stay there?      Come on lads, it was a joke to instigate giggles.  So, any ideas why? It would make sense if Subaru made the drawing, or if Nanako is actually the protagonist.        Before Nanako gave him his form he was formless. So after she gave him his form everyone sees him like that? It never said that they all perceived his appearance differently.    Yeah, but how come they all see him the same way. It was kinda implied that everyone sees him their own way.     It could be that the first person to see him gives him his form which everyone sees him as.  It would be weird if everyone saw him differently then how would it work when they squeeze him and stuff?      Is there more?     It could be that the first person to see him gives him his form  He was a shota before he met with Minato, who gave him that form? The alien asked Nanako to give him a form so it is not automatic.       It'll probably be explained this episode who made him into a magical boy -- what I'm saying is get ready for TIME TRAVEL SHENANIGANS    I meant the link where you are getting them from nigga   My theory is that the aliens are actually just future human children in a flux state of possibilities.  I love you guys. I love this show. I dont want it to end.   tfw I will not be able to watch season finale with /a/ because I have to go out with IRL friends  Life is suffering.   GET IN HERE ONLY 5 +60  MINUTES LEFT    Fuck them.   Can't watch until later cause of morning shift, but I'm so hype.  the cutest   Absolutely.    Nah, she is for sex.     Not watching it with your IRL friends  Get some friends with taste.     Absolutely.    She is for sex and then taking responsibility.     My weebest friend moved to another country for works. My other friends are nerds with whom I share other nerd fields of interest, but not this one. It's not that easy. I can't watch anime 'cause I have to go to a fantasy fair     Spoilered and saged for blogspot.     Pretty sure the soopa speshul MC with the soopa speshul unique ability that makes him soopa powaful is the worst part of that garbage. Also he has a soopa speshul hair color just because it will make girls like him.  Actually the setting might be the worst thing.

Yay cultural exchange.          404 error on Yucie's channel   Neetball is offline   2 minutes left      Neetball streams it tomorrow.     Change the last word to princess.    Does anyone want to buy the OST digitally and rip it?    not the version with fixed episode 3    It started End is near    That worked, thanks.    No eyecatch, no new episode.   Oh gosh  KISS     YES      no dark Subaru  ;_;      But I like it in here, it's cozy and po-warm, unlike that ugly world out there.     kita-------:)------!!!   It looks like their shafts are vibrating out of control   10/10 finale    Great Too bad, it will their last show    10/10 Bravo Gainax.    Akane chan back We all loved her, right?     Who the hell is that?    That was beautiful  Even that random garden guy from last episode was relevant again     How can Minato be cuter than Subaru and every other girl in the show?    Aoi's girlfriend from Subaru's world Watch first episode     What a ride it was      What's with the character development?    Aoi finally gets her yuri ending     Probably the different versions from Subaru's world. Tomboy Itsuki looks lovely.         Itsuki getting tomboy hair  I'm actually fine with that.   Nanako in ponytail  IS IT NEXT HOUR YET?        adsoluting discusting brrrrr....    Just so you guys know, Pleiades won yesterday in "favorite anime this season" thread.   And there go the sales, looks that sponsored shows don't need to hide behind subtext having proper funding and not care about BD sales.  But then again making the guy more girly looking that any other girl in the show gives me mixed signals, especially if the girl acts like a guy should here...  Maybe more shows sponsored would mean more development in romance.       That was a good run Well, see you in the few years when next gainax original show will be aired Hope we all be alive until then     Fuck off tripfag    mostly subtext are romantic than avarage romance but just because they are both girls people here fixed just a bait     mostly subtext are romantic than avarage romance but just because they are both girls people here fixed just a bait  Translation anyone?       Just try to imagine how much V Itsuki gets in the parallel universe where she was born a boy         Chinga tu madre,pendejo!    10/10 And why i'm crying?      Well that was a great way to die from Gainax.   Thread hidden until subs arrival. Why the fuck are you guys impatient?   Why can't you into moon?     Learn to type you fucking faggot.     If thread is hidden why are you here?   Let's celebrate!    Delivering.  &gt;Responding to nearly eight-hour-old posts        not drawing the cat face on the mug      One last weekly mug time.  ;_;       Oh no I'm still catching up.  I hope you guys still have a thread when I'm done.      No, that twist was discusting    We will make a new one if we go over bump limit.    discusting  What is there to discuss?        Itsuki closes Aoi eyes knowing that if she see the kiss will hurt her   How long must I wait for the sub?  Somebody can post that chart?  A few minutes now.      I want to keep it like this now, but I doubt the marker'll hold     Why are Itsuki and Nanako such a huge shipperfags?    Nice job Misato san    Nanako just wants Minato for herself But seeing him with another girl, turns her on for some reason...      Due to production issues, episode 12 will be delayed. We thank you for your patience and understanding.      Due to production issues, episode 12 will be delayed. We thank you for your patience and understanding.      Ebin.      Nanako just wants Minato for herself    So satisfying    I fucking waited hours for that. And the episode is delayed. Fuck my life.         NISIO!    I bet you have tons of beer to go along with that strawberry milk.    Now you just have to wait for a cute little girl to randomly walk into your room    Due to production issues, episode 12 will be delayed. We thank you for your patience and understanding.  Okay, I am officially mad.    Anon, they are fighting over ET not each other    no mames guey, aprende ingles        patience and understanding   implying I'm not a self-entitled asshole      Soundtrack rip never   I don't get Itsuki sometimes    Nice edit. At least pleiades is better than interstellar.    The lewd thoughts overwhelmed her      fuck. I even left work early to watch it with you guys.     Way to blue ball us crunchy       While you wait for the subs, you can always listen opening again https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GNk<wbr>PJvVEm0s</wbr>  [ ]     no scene of Minato getting discharged from the hospital with Subaru going to meet him   They had one job      He is dead Jim.     That opening is great, and people said that this series will just be a shit car commercial.    Well, Kano is very cheap web singer...     not posting the latest version      not posting the transparency      Goddamnit, I merged the layers without thinking.       that low-res  Please      There, fixed. Nyatan's eye was a bit off.    Punchline  nope       Gave up waiting for subs and just read the thread, glad to see the show end with a bang. I wonder if we'll get another space heavy show like this again, it made for some fun threads.   The underwater episode makes me kind of want a deep sea exploration magical girl show.    Well, Gainax is working on a diving anime after this one.    Iaaaa shark-kun~    But is the end prize a tsundere shark boy?   Its supposed to be delayed how much time? 2 hours? 2 days?      Template?       Have fun.     Thank you.    Who do I blame? Gainax or Crunchyroll?    Crunchy    Blame yourself for not knowing moon.   It's crunchy, like it always is.       Is this for real? I haven't seen a show do this since GuP!    "What's that? You want to watch the last episode in a language you can understand! Too bad! Delayed, bitch!"   And people wonder why I don't like to pay for subs.       So its the sub that's delayed not the episode itself?    Yeah, only subs. The episode itself already aired.    You missed delays of Shirobako which is anime about anime production and delays as well    Wasn't Shirobako a thinly veiled recounting of the trials of making GuP?    I want a sticky of this.    Sorry m8, I like Etotama, but Nya-tan's face is not the correct expression.     But the other four don't even all have the same expression either.     It's a "the fuck" expression, where Nya-tan has more scared face.   My shift starts in 8h, and I still have to go to sleep.  do you really lick this pairing? because is bland as hell a episode ago Subaru admit that she don't anything about autismkun that is big proof that they don't development they romance is discusting      Watch it tomorrow when neetball streams it, subs+chat might be pretty great.    Well at least it wasn't the final episode. Oh wait.     Your use of English is disgusting.    That sounds nice, when is he going to stream it?    No idea.     Kill yourself Mugino.      I can't see anything scared in her face. It's a "the fuck"-face, like the rest of them.     Are you using google translate or something? I'm guessing   is you. Stop posting like a retard.          being this off          Not me but I will stay and fight     Implying she's a purityfag     He's streaming it on vaughnlive, right?       That one half-obscured eye makes her look a bit sleepy or something, it's odd.    Fuck you Crunchy. Ruining the last episode airing thread of one of the best episode this season. I fucking hate them. At least I can watch my glorious french fansub later.       of one of the best episode  *Of one of the best anime     That is better.    We know Subaru, we all know.    Yeah, but he won't be streaming subbed episode. You have to download it yourself, and play together with chat from connectcast. Oh, also ads. Keep an eye out for them and pause in right moment.     This is not po-warm at all. Where the fuck are the subs   Thanks anon, I will download the episode as soon as I get home and I will have his channel open in the background.   Maybe I won't miss it.      Good night!   I knew it I was going to watch the livestream but figured it'd be smarter to just watch with subs so I'll actually know what's going on  Even woke myself up in time for subs to come out for once this week.        What livestream. Like, in TV, or usual place? Because usual place airs Pleiades tomorrow.     Hmm, really? Neetball streams it tomorrow? Well, I probably could have used myniji or something like that if it really came down to it.     This is Shirobako all-over again.   I'm going to post this everyday until you like it.  I hate it   i dont get it   How many time has this been posted daily?  Why the fuck is AoG posting it? Is Sakurafish ban?    yes.    He hates it.     No you're not. Fuck off.    Dutchguy  Oh wow, I remember you. So it was you posting Rinfish this entire time.         Nope. The real rinfish actually isn't able to post right now due to unfortunate events. I'm taking over until he gets his shit together again.  That said, good night everyone.     I will hate it until the stars burn out and the light fades.  I hope that you will spend this time trying to convince me otherwise.    feikah  This is now a naruto thread.   Pain vs EMS pre-rinnegan Saucegay. Who wins.        I'm gonna derail a SakuraFish™ thread   Good luck, newfriend!       I declare WAR ON ALL LOLI!  We shall bully them all and make them CRY!  FOR FINDOOOOOOOOOOM!      We are off to do battle!  We will attack on the land  ...from the seas  ...and even the air!  I think I like it.   But seriosly though why do moefags get so buttblasted about naruto threads, yet shitpost generals like this are okay?     Why?   Have you written a strongly worded letter to the management yet?       You can always send a tasteful fruit basket (I hear that the are most favorable to Oranges and Strawberries) to the mods and see if that will make them more favorable to your cause?    Now we bully the Loli till they cry!    Where is Sakurafish...    not appreciating a proud cultural tradition of /a/      Where?     Heh.     WHERE ARE YOU HIDING HIM?    Hay guise!

Vanilla is perfection  I prefer caramel.    She is pretty delicious     Both. Either in a threesome or just lesbian.   Milk chocolate, but fuck elves  I don't like chocolate. Vanilla/cherry or banana milk are the best.    cherry   banana milk   how many dicks you've sucked?       vanilla maybe tanned but base should be vanilla     why not both?    Vanilla Aiz Cream.     hah, vanilla icecream     Is that really vanilla? Are you sure its not semen white?    fuck i need to watch milk chocolate again. One of the best designs of elves ive seen in hentai      Vanilla is semen white.    Wanilla!     Maybe     So it's humans versus half-dark elves?    Both    She's the cutest in the series.   Some vanilla ice cream does sound good on a hot day like this   Its a hard decision but I'll go with milk    Vanilla Ice is the blackest darkness.    Am I supposed to find this girl attractive?  Because I don't.       This shit again.   Am I supposed to find this bait funny?  Because I don't.       The cool kids strike back.  YAMEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO   And why is the great Neo New Shingo Sawatari not considered a cool kid?    Nice Ruri.    It's an exclusive club, no losers allowed.    NEVER THE PUREST LOVE WILL NEVER STOP    6th for irrelevant decks people want put on the banlist   I'm with that Anon, Sawatari belongs. Serena can't be part of it without her dumb comedy husbando.    He isn't missing or put into solitary confinement.     tfw Crystal Beasts gets pendulum cards and becomes absolutely broken     I just want Releaser to not be banned. I don't know what I'll do if that happens.  Yeah search for other ways but it will be harder now.      Try petitioning next year, maybe you'll get in.    Yuto's Passionate Soul  This is better than it has any right to be.     Purest   Vampire Vamp   And with that pic  secretkek       But Crystal Beasts already have Pendulums      I recruited him though even after he lost like a bitch.    See  And they're still shit  Djinn lock is some bullshit, but I don't really see why it would be banned unless the lock forced a 1-deck format  Also, we've been promised Jack and... No Jack. What the Hell Konami        <br/>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-9N<wbr>BvsmQ2Ik</wbr>  [ ] http://ygorganization.com/ocg-06222<wbr>015-ocg-japan-and-china-decklists/ tfw being on top </wbr>    Would Sawataris papa approve of Serena?   This should of been called Academies theme  http://<span>youtu.be/2ieZ6qQ9818  [ ]     He'd have to.     Nobody is using Berserker soul in raccoons.dek  Brb making Berkser Raccoons     Playing in TCG is like playing OU in Pokemon (unless you are in showderp).   Reiji's chibi doesn't even look chibi.   There's also other Serena expressions that isn't shown in the manzai, but appears in the website's "Duel School" flash app.     dat flustered Serena      flustered Serena  My heart and dick are in unison.     I like the second's second panel how is he like "Oh crap what I have to say now?"  If she get this cute I may start to like her. I am really into these moe cute faces with tsundere traits, that's something Yuzu sadly didn't achieve for me.       Actual Berserker Soul is nothing compared to its anime counterpart. If it was I would've already made Superheavy Berserker Samurais   When will they just fucking go on a date?   When they reunite.    Don't worry, she still likes you.  It's not like Nekroz really need it, more if you consider that Book of Eclipse is basically a big fuck you to Rituals with Releaser in general, unless they control something like Forbidden Lance. And to be honest, after the big bullshit it was the Agent deck (in my opinion, the most annoying lock deck), I feel Djinn-lock are not that hard to deal with it. I can see Book of Eclipse getting hitted at some point though. And Jack will return in Dimension of Chaos, unless you refer to anime. If that's the case.  KONAMIIIIIIIIII          When will they just fuck?  Now that's more like it. And hopefully we can get an exclusive OVA with that. Itadaki! Seieki animation.     Tfw no masochistic tomato     Only 500 dmg per draw   Implying you couldn't STEADFASTU DRAW with Susano'o  That's 7000 damage, isn't it? I mean, what could make the combo stronger?     did Zexal have this much QUALITY moments?    Yuzu sadly didn't achieve for me.   That's nothing to be said about, Yuzu's a horrible character and has been sense day one, she's just another Kotori. No matter what the Yuzufags will tell you.     So if the one who drew pic-related is one of the artists who occasionally draws for ARC-V, especially the DVD covers, this is Serena's full attire in the ED, isn't it?   This last episode was filled with QUALITY.    And Yuya looked more like a girl than usual, I guess the koreans got confused on his gender.    How about FUCK YOU    I'm not sure but I feel like it would still be more fun with the anime effect and just be able to attack indefinitely with a superheavy samurai.    It's a very nice outfit.    Come at me, Yuzufag, I'll wake that head of yours posthaste.    Oh yes, the girl deeply connected to the plot and is a major character and comptent duelist is a useless cunt that cries out the protagonist name while getting in the way and contributing nothing whatsoever to the plot.    Double teaming me now? You yuzufags are into some kinky shit.    Or, wait. The card only allows it's usage when you do 1500 or less damage. Which means it's basically useless in Superheavy sams and shit in Raccoon's.    He's just shitposting, anon, I can't believe you took the bait.    Yo, I don't think she is horrible, just it doesn't suit for me, the only ones who maded this far were Masumi and (to some extent) Mieru. She is cool, funny and likeable but not my favourite, that's all.  Calm down, anon.       the koreans  was this episode actually made by koreans or are you just rusing me     Korean animation studio.    I mean let's make a venn diagram in our heads.  Overlap: Female. No cowtits. Love Interest for the lead.   Kotori: Yuma.wav. Fanservice. Barely ever duels. Yuma don't give a fuck, totally devoted to Yuma anyway.   Yuzu: Appears without Yuya in frame ever, Duels fairly often and has an improvement arc. Crude and strong. Could probably be convinced Yuya is a bad, given enough evidence.   Nah. Points for b8 tho        Post any waifu or cardfu you want to be yours. Pic related, except that I don't have photoshop and used something I found in my folder.  Just imagine that Ladydevimon is Vampire Vamp and it will be enough    It's not like I'm into a crude, strong girl!     Could probably be convinced Yuya is a bad, given enough evidence.  Now lets not go that far.      strong.   I'll give you that, No normal girl could break a piece of high tech in a punch. But that's it. She hasn't had a duel for 17 episodes and she did nothing but lose after her "I got gud" duel against the fodder who lost easily to captain falcon.      It's been foreshadowed.  First she doubted that Yuto was a different person, even though he was worlds more violent than Yuya (in her eyes at the time), then Gon outright saying "You didn't believe in Yuya?!"   misunderstandings       your waifu/cardfu is shit, Selena best girl, selena a cute    She's the series Jounouchi. She gets Yuya's sloppy jobbers to prove she's gotten better at the game. And really the only characters consistently dueling onscreen at the moment are Yuya, Shun, and maybe Dennis.    Oh it's going to happen especially when he EGAO and noms Yugo.     a Digimon with a pregnancy test  It may look like a hot chick but it isn't a real woman. Digimon have no define sex Anon...    Why is Serena such a miracle of the universe and dimensions?    Yuzu slap.gif  wait what the fuck? that wasn't in the latest episode or its trailer for the next one.    Guess the father.   Yuya?    I just realized that they're dressed like Johan  Am I retarted      Jonouchi was not a bad duelist at all, he should have beaten Marik and won plenty of important duels. Technically he became the King of Games after Battle City, he had to beat Yugi to get back his Red Eyes. It might not have been shown, but he did get his Red Eyes back.    Yuri.    Oh don't start that bullshit here, anon. "Digimon has no sex" it's an annoying delusion from moralfags and nostalgiafags who don't want any other Digimon that are human or something like that.    Sorry Rin.   A little bit Anon. A lot of the cards are based on the characters. The Legendary Gambler is a young Solomon Moto.        I never said he was a bad duelist. I did pretty much say he takes Yugi's seconds, and that's not incorrect. It's basically what his entire battle city career is.    Digimon not having genders is straight up said in the shows. Fap to them all you want, I do, but they still don't have genders, they're just data.   With that said, this fucking Greymon is like a blackhole of always hungry in Re:Digitize.      it's an edit, I don't see how Yugo could make her mad enough to bring out the fan.    Shit card Shit fu     Serena.       it's an edit  No its not, watch the preview for the next episode at the end of the current one     I wouldn't call Yuzu the Jonouchi though, I'd call Gon that if anybody, while Sawatari is the Manjourne. Yuzu is more like the Asuka.    What about her younger form?   At the next banlist, an errata is announced.   Cyber Dragon Nova   This card must first be Xyz Summoned with the above materials.    y/n         he should have beaten Marik  Dude that's nothing to be proud of at all, he would have even lost to Mai if it wasn't for the random chuuni chant needed for Ra Did Marik even get a single legit win?      REVOLUUUUTIOOOOON    You can't tell me what to do.    That's a boy.       This is poor bait     Yugo: So have you guys kissed yet?   Yuzu: Wha-?!       That's a boy.   Implying Yuya would give a fuck if Yuzu had a fat delicious cock       Falling for bait.     Yuzu   Asuka  That's literally saying she's irrelevant to the series anon.  Yuzu seems like the Jounouchi due to how ARC-V emphasizes her importance second to Yuya. Gon barely isn't even important to the overarching plot.  If she isn't, then she's pretty much a whole new class of character herself.             I believe Yami Marik beat Yami Bakura/Marik legit, otherwise no, he didn't win a single duel without Shadow Realm and Chuuni Chant shenanigans.    Since Yuya, Yuzu, and Gon are seemingly meant to be the power trio, I'm pretty sure they're going for something completely new.    It wasn't the coreans this time, by taking 3 seconds to check the credits. It was Studio Blanc, and their episodes being full of QUALITY is nothing new. They're awful, I hope they eventually get dropped for a studio that can at least do a passable job.    nigga i don't read nip.    I doubt it was that, after all, she's not got that red blush.     Since Yuya, Yuzu, and Gon are seemingly meant to be the power trio  The concept of a power trio is as irrelevant here as it was in GX and early 5Ds    Shun do not click this image.   Still, Yuya/Yuzu/Gon is as close as you can get since they get portrayed as such in things like the second OP and the cover for Hanate.    Too late.    Is that the touMAN I see?    Poor Gon sure doesn't get to act like a member of the power trio though.     Still, Yuya/Yuzu/Gon is as close as you can get since they get portrayed as such in things like the second OP and the cover for Hanate.  Reiji would fit better than Gon if you want to force it     Everyone has a power trio this time around.    Main Characters  Yuya, Yuzu, Gon  Cool Kids  Reiji, Serena, Shun  Crazy Fusions  Shun, Yuri, Leo  etc. you get the point, only one that isn't part of a trio is Sawatari and he's too Neo New for that shit.             Not yet at least, but he and Yuzu still get most of the non-protagonist duels (even if Yuzu hasn't dueled for awhile), along with Shun.    Bakura, apparently. I'm looking at the Duel Script now and there's no shenanigans but.   Bakura plays Exchange   Takes Ra   Marik takes Monster Reborn   Bakura had a useless normal monster and a Spirit Message in his hand  I dunno if we can call this legit, because Bakura apparently suffered a brain aneurysm when he activated Exchange.            Hurp, meant to reply to     I'm catching up on Zexal in between episodes of Arc-V, and the production values are surprisingly strong. The soundtrack too. Really, if there was less 'Yuma being an idiot' stuff eating entire episodes whole, and great (female) secondary characters getting constantly shafted, Zexal would have been a very solid series.     Studio Blanc  I don't see any of that though. All I see are a bunch of names, Studio Wanpack, and Ace Company Studio Mark.      Sawatari, New Sawatari, and Neo New Sawatari are their own power trio      Not yet at least, but he and Yuzu still get most of the non-protagonist duels  Gon has dueled more than Yuzu       Bakura was a shit duelist. he only ever got one legit win that wasn't a straight up lose or no result and that was against that Bonz character.    And Bonz lost against Joey's normal monster with like 800 attack    Shun has dueled more than her too. Serena is right there with her too.     Shun under Crazy Fusions   Shun is not a member of Academia.  Yet.       Of course.  Meant Sora, guess I have the burning passion of revolution on my mind thanks to Sound Duel 3.      Never said they dueled the same amount.    I don't blame you, those Yuto and Shun themes were great.    To be honest, Yuzu doesn't look like she's meant for dueling anyway. It looks like she's meant to be someone who goes looking for plot action.  Although this time around, her role is to see things on the other side of the story, at least on Yugo's side.      I really miss Yuto, he was too young and too pure.     Yuzu doesn't look like she's meant for dueling anyway.  She spouts about how she's an entertainment duelist all the time when she duels. She's going to duel plenty more, just give it time.     Where does one find sound duels? I've been trying to track down the 5ds ones for a while now, and can't seem to find a decent site with them.  Also, I can't believe I somehow missed that Arc-v's 2nd AND 3rd osts were released.     He'll be back one day, be patient.    Someone had a mega of it yesterday or the day before. I don't have it anymore, but I'm sure someone here does.    What or who could possibly crack the crude exterior for Serena to act like that?    I-i will    Yours truly.         tfw I actually spend 20 minutes to do this   tfw I really have free time right now  I admit I had a lot of fun doing this, and also admit I never expected to be more or less good in photoshop.         His straw is broken    I need Yuzus. Post more Yuzus.   Lewd is preferred.     No lewd.    Sometimes you just get mad you aren't invited to the table to spend time with a Ruri.   No.       I need Yuzus  What for?     Ruris are only for cute.    Sorry, I only have a bunch of cute Serenas to share with.     Shun dressed up like J Jonah Jameson   I need pictures, PICTURES OF RURIS        Jesus, he really looks like Sonic there.    I didn't even notice he did honestly, but I'm glad you pointed it out, got a laugh out of me.    Obviously    You haven't seen things yet.    Shun looks uncomfortable.     Rins hair reminds me of amy     Found it in the archives, thanks for the tip.     Yuya is Knuckles   Yugo is Sonic   Yuto is Shadow  You're bending my head like a pretzel, Arc-V        Sonic   Sora   Manjourne   Whoever the fuck Yuri looks like   No prob.        Ayye, did I miss something or did Sawatari get his duel disk back while Yuya didn't? I also saw the blocks of the action spell Crossover.   And Yuri is Amy.   Also I love Serena, but I can't be the only one that dislikes how they draw her blue strands do I? They look more like a head band than her hair.     I feel triggered but I don't know why    Yuto is Manjoume      Sometimes you just get mad you aren't invited to the table to spend time with a Ruri.   It's the flashbacks.        How is a landlord related to circus animals?     that filename     Getting kinda cthuluy, Yuya.    Why is Yuto such a brute?    My skin stated crawling when I noticed those baby crabs.     Yuto's shitty little money pile.  What's wrong, Yuto, couldn't pick the  SILENTO BOOTS?     <br/>   Its symbolism about how the harder Yuya tries to incorporate egao into his life the more he corrupts and misunderstands it       see your art posted like a year later  Feels good.        This game is hard   I don't understand it   Where are the dragons       You should make more.    I really like the touches on the monopoly one.  Shun clearly taking them to school and Yuzu is getting butthurt   Yuto has already been cleaned out, has no money or properties left.    Name has Kaiba in it and 'Go to Shadow Realm' space.         tfw only buildings level up   tfw character creation screen is shit   tfw 2d6       We need more pictures Anon.   who infernoid here? vanitys sadlife     &gt;Serena dies the same way, passing her Moonlight Cat Dancer to Yuzu.     I PUT TWO HOTELS ON MY RAILROAD    Holy shit, I think I dimly remember you posting them the first time  What the fuck have I done with my last year       Give it to them...to everyone's future...with your power...   Tits.   And then Yuzu punches her.       Dunno what you are talking about, vanity btfo by galaxy cyclone or Dekatron.    I draw for you guys all the time. Pic related was me.  I draw a disgusting amount of Yuri and Serena http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=50351463 </wbr>        Yuto is /tg/  What boards would other Yugiohs use?

I'll probably try out IgKnights too, they look cool.        More monopoly then or other children's games then, like the game of Life.     Rua is /toy/   Ruka is /an/   Crow is /ck/       I want to draw the Yus playing Sorry now fuck      GX Yugi is /fit/      Sawatari is /fa/.     Not maining dank-o-tron     Good, do it.    Yugi gets swoll and stops being a manlet   /fit/ would be proud.        I'll post it tomorrow night, I need to sleep stat.   Now I just want tons of kids playing board games   Sora playing Candyland and everybody having to stop him from licking the board.   Gongenzaka trying to play jenga with his giant hands.   Yuya playing twister and his coat gets in everybody else's face.        Good I'll be waiting since I'm sure Re:Digitize will piss me off with how much meat these fuckers consume.    God help Yuzu if Ruri's a cow.     Shun and Yuto playing Chess   Shun flips the board screaming REVOLUTION   Yugo playing Checkers with Yuzu   Yugo does a Synchro Checkers Chuuni Chant when he combines two pieces into a King        Ruri is pretty much guaranteed to be flat.     SPREAD THOSE WONDROUS, GLOWING CIRCLES AND TRANSPORT ME TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BOARD AT LIGHT SPEED!   Jump, jump, jump.        Shun is definitely /m/.     OH RED CIRCLE SHINING BRIGHT ON THIS CHECKERED FIELD, BRING FORTH A KING OF ABSOLUTE POWER   CHEKKA SHOKAN   Yugo is still on his bike the entire time        Serena is playing chess with Roger   Yuya and Yuzu come by and ask "Hey guys, whatcha doing?"   Roger grabs two more pieces and drops them on his side of the board.      I wonder if Yugi and Kaiba will get chants for Dark Magician and Blue Eyes White Dragon. wait, do they do chants for advance summon?    wait, do they do chants for advance summon?  Im pretty sure Strong did one for Barbarian King      Shun is playing Connect Four with Yuto   They're both trying to overlay the pieces   They don't, but they're gonna get Synchro and Xyz cards, especially considering Dark Magician has an Xyz and Blue Eyes a Synchro. Hell they might even give them Pendulum, it'd make getting Kaiba's Blue Eyes a lot easier.       Yuzu did one for Mozart too.     They don't, but they're gonna get Synchro and Xyz cards, especially considering Dark Magician has an Xyz and Blue Eyes a Synchro. Hell they might even give them Pendulum, it'd make getting Kaiba's Blue Eyes a lot easier.   Silent Swordsman and Silent Magician synchro retrains when? I love those two monsters and I don't want them forgotten about there's just something special about the partnership of a physical and magical attacker working together to overwhelm their foes.      Well they gave Horus one so maybe we could get some LV retrains in later packs for sake of nostalgia.    Probably never honestly, I'd imagine some of the other cards getting Synchros instead.    playing Love Live   see a cute card girl   Name: Shun Kurosaki   mfw        Metaphys Horus is a Synchro   Metaphys Armed Dragon is a crappy normal monster  gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay      Shun a cute.    Wasn't there some spoiler fag wayyy back months ago saying something about retrained LV monsters? I mean they called the master of pendulum structure deck as well as the 3 Odd eyes extra deck monsters. But I absolutely refuse to believe we are getting a Miracle fusion card that works for every fusion monster. Can you imagine how bullshit that would be?     anime Breaker is 1500   card Breaker is 1600  Konami are laughing their ass off.      What the hell are you talking about? It's 1600.    In the anime, Breaker had its ATK lowered by 100 by some spell card of Haga's. It was 1600.      I really gotta clean up my Arc-V folders...and you aren't helping dammit.

Whereabouts can I find that Percy one? That worked much better than Devpro.    Not sure why would you want Percy instead of Devpro when there are much better players in the latter.    Are you talking about the percival one for android? If so, it should be on google play or percival18's blog somewhere.   Otherwise ygopro's site should have everything.       using Devpro to play other people   ever       playing Yugioh at all  Come to the other side folks.     Why are magicfags so insecure?    Cause nobody wants to play vintage with me  ;_;    I'm leaving this here as a reminder. http://exhentai.org/g/813747/4f79ac<wbr>1776/</wbr>    Aww, that panda looks sad. I'd give him a hug.

Then he got killed by St. George.    Where the fuck did Yuya pull all of those new Pendulum magic cards out of. His ass? Well, this is a prison arc after all.   Maybe he'll start channeling the power of Yuto instead of the power of EGAO.  Well considering he pulled them out of thing air in the first place, probably, or Reiji made them.     YAMEROOOOO  Now that's alpha.   HANASE      UAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH        YAMERO JA NAI  YUGO DA      Shun finally gets to talk next episode. I wonder what he's gonna say after that.    RR  Ruri Revolution~      Ruri Falcon when? Yuya can't just hog all the waifucards.    When we find out that Ruri is actually his pet falcon that he got because his real little sister died long long ago.   http://<span>youtu.be/Xbfekqs-7Kk  [ ]   DUSTY ROBE      For every waifu card someone else gets, Yuya will get two more waifu cards. Eventually he'll be able to go an entire duel only summoning Yuzus.   Odd-Eyes counts as a Yuzu.      Why does it feel so good to beat Odd Eyes Magician with pure Performapal   Because you are bad at games    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=v1x<wbr>FDbtqBmE</wbr>  [ ]     Hey Selena, how many did you get to beat?      Yuzu eats Serena    gets a green eye   eventually eats Ruri to get a pink eye   She is now Odd-Eyes    Serena ends up with a better record   it dejects Shun as a man            Serena ends up with a better record   There is only one way to settle it then.      You wouldn't hit a Ruri would you Shun?    He's not trying to hit her, Selena is just being difficult.    Difficult girls are best girls.    I wish they could surprise everyone and have him deck her or reject her outright, for whatever justifiable reason. The woes would fly with "Oh, he doesn't love Ruri anymore," when in fact it would just prove he's well aware that she certainly isn't Ruri at all.  The sooner that complacent stereotype is kill, the better.      To be fair he doesn't really seem to pay her any attention or give two shits about her. I don't even remember if he's even commented on her looking like Ruri, maybe once briefly?   Most of the stuff is just headcanon pairings and stuff with them, they seem rather indifferent to each other, they're just similar brutes, and only opposites attract.      Why on earth would he hit the person who saved his life?    At this point he probably figured out the AU counterparts thing. If anything I'm worried he'll run into the actual Ruri and go goddamnit another clone     The only fuel to the flames so far is that he looks at her/Yuzu obscurely, which everybody translates as "He's thinking of the Ruri." when in fact he's just wondering if he could ask one of them to sew the torn bits on the bottom of his coat back together.     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tdk<wbr>hQi_iEO4</wbr>  [ ]     I'm surprised nobody comments on their clothes or hair or anything. They only ever comment on their faces looking the same. I get that maybe they're supposed to look the exact same completely and they just look different for the sake of the viewer, but even then the clothes should give it away most of the time or their general height, size of the tits, eye color, or something.     To be fair he doesn't really seem to pay her any attention or give two shits about her.   He gave enough shits about her to fight for her despite his serious injuries. And tell her the truth about his dimension when prompted to by her despite refusing to do so earlier to Reiji. Not to mention he stayed with the Lancers because she asked him to.     Yusei fight for future, earth got xyz Yuma defend earth from d1k and whatever that thing in alternate retcon universe, we earth got pendulum. I don't buy Yugioh reprint after R now look what our publisher throw at us.      I'm guessing crazy hair colors and hair style in Yugioh are just as common as blonde or brown hair here.  So they might assume that they just dyed their hair (which also seems to be more common in YGO. I think it was confirmed that Yugi actually dyes his hair?).  I mean if you ran into your best friend you knew since childhood and he simply had blonde hair would you not recognize him? We just have to raise our suspension of disbelief to anime logic.  And they actually do recognize the clothes. Yuzu thought Yuto was Yuya changing into a costume and Serena and Yuzu swapped clothes to make Obelisk go after Yuzu          Insult me, fair enough. Insult my Mother, shame on you. Insult my cards, you're a dead man. Insult my comrades, hell hath no fury. Insult my Sister, WHITE WHALE, HOLY GRAIL        Well the hair dye makes since to a degree, but not for You Show to believe Serena was Yuzu, she wouldn't have had time to just go dye her hair during a Battle Royale.   Also as far as Yugi I don't think so. His grandpa's when he was younger was dark gray/blackish and gold.      Sawatari's papa was carded by Shun and nobody noticed    Why is she still in her Academia uniform in these?    Sawatari probably really doesn't care to be honest, he's too busy trying to impress the strong willed girl and save the universe.   How would you guys fill if Neo New Sawatari started using NEOS.      Translation?     New Sawatari started using NEOS.  It's a trash card that fits him perfectly     he gets a reprint thats worth using. Neo Neos Sawatari    Whoa, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. We do not talk about the new WAITO like this.     Neapolitan Summons   Strawberry: Fusion   Chocolate: Xyz   Vanilla: Synchro   Sawatari is gonna be great as this goes on, he'll stop sucking eventually. I mean he's not completely useless, he has helped quite a bit surprisingly.        Was Reiji trying to give Shun a Yosenju card? or Funky Comedian? or his own personal RaidRaptor Pendulum?   It was a ruri imouto card and he got upset about it.    It was Risebell. He didn't take it well.    It was this card.   Meanwhile in Academia, Yuri and Sora are being irrelevant doing irrelevant things for another 10-30 episodes because MUH SYNCHRO DIMENSION.    Reiji tried to give him Ruri Pendulum.   Shun gets annoyed and leaves, saying he doesn't need Pendulums.   Reiji tries to recruit Yugo by making a Rin Pendulum   Yugo goes full MISUNDERSTANDINGS and thinks that Reiji carded Rin because fuck logic.   We get Yuya vs Yugo   I'm just talking out of my ass right now just because.   But seriously, how much of a dick move would it be if Yuri learns how to Pendulum Summon after being told by Leo/Sora/Dennis... and the first Pendulums that Yuri gets is a Ruri Pendulum and a Rin Pendulum, setting both in the scales. It would NEVER happen for obvious reasons but it would troll the shit out of Shun or Yugo if Yuri dueled one of them.             Or Fusion Dimension is taking this time to prepare to invade Standard.    I can definitely see it happening but it's going to have a drawback.     Why the fuck is it only one card? You need 2 pendulum cards to pendulum summon, even I know that. Fuck you Akaba Reiji      I think Yuri has other ways to get under someone's skin      Yeah, but    http://strawpoll.me/4724660/  so my physical CD of Sound Duel 3 just came in  open it for the sake of 320ks or return it?  what to do, what to do        Play the sound of rebellion as you drive around town laying the smack down on unsuspecting duelists.     65 votes in 10 minutes  Hey, lurkers, wanna play Indian boardgame with me?    I fucking love  Shun__    yfw Academia invaded Standard Dimension off-screen   In like 30-40 episodes from now, we get flashbacks about the invasion.   Best dad is carded   Best mom is carded   YSDS Kid Trio is carded   Everyone from LDS that remained behind is carded   We find out that Yusho was missing because he was carded by Dennis/Leo/Yuri   Yuzu gets captured during Synchro Dimension arc because she sacrifices herself to protect Yuya   Yuya has realised TRUE ZETSUBOU that goes beyond a mere Edge Mode    Its not like anything is stopping them from doing it now. Their only line of defence is:  Himika (she probably isn't a duelist, but if she was, she would be the strongest on this list... which doesn't say much since she would still be shit)   Masumi (would get BTFO by Obelisk Force easily if Sora's implied statement about Fusion Dimension duelists being stronger than LDS Fusion users)   Yaiba (a jobber who lost to Kachidoki off-screen)   Mieru (irrelevant loli duelist who lost to Ninjabro)   Kachidoki (shit duelist)   Anyone else not mentioned (too weak to stand a chance)   Hell, Yuri doesn't even need to invade. Just send Sora with about 10 Obelisk Force, and then about 20 Slifer Reds that invaded Heartland and Standard is crushed. The Slifers invaded Heartland so they have the combat experience to know what to do with Standard... either that or Xyz Dimension was so shit that Leo only needed the Slifer Reds + Yuri to invade. Adding Yuri into the Standard invasion would be overkill.                      So Crow and Yuya part ways, why do you think it is? The preview mentions Shinji, who's obviously gonna be relevant at some point    Are people really that bored that ANY strawpoll posted on 4chan, ever, gets botted to death under twenty minutes?    The escape plan, obviously Yuya disagrees. Not for long because they escape the next episode and after that one he's fighting Jack, but he's disagreeing with Crow.     I'm sure he loves you too, Selena.      Where are the moonrune readers when you need them?

I need OEM decklist   Out of all the things to bot, that's hilarious. Pokemon TCG in 98 had more complexity and intelligence thought put into than Hearthstone does,    Yuzu's dad will be carded as a virgin   Feels bad man    POST FAVORITE Arc-V BATTLE THEME https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=a0f<wbr>PvVyxWGs</wbr>  [ ]    I got 1 Scatterfoil Odd Eyes, one of each magician and a Dark Rebellion. I would be happy but most of the scatterfoils I pulled were fucking Arnold Schwarzenegger monsters.    and being a virgin is bad because    Because things like this happens, also yes I've saved it and make some minor changes just to put that filename.   I miss Nakajima...   I miss Ruri    I miss Yuzu.    I miss Futoshi    I miss Yuri    If only our drawfag being tried.    Who is her last name again?    Have a son to play card game with?   GX would have been better if Judai was a girl.   Dammit Kotori. Is this your revenge for not being a good duelist in your show?     I feel like if duel monster spirit becomes real in real life and some of them get married with some anons here, it will be "I can't understand what my husband is saying" comedy show, only that husband is also AIBOOOOOO     Reiji is like Bizarro cool. Everything about him screams nerd that beat up daily.   And then I remember that he could beat the shit out of most people here.       Which Sora?    There's a Berserker Soul deck that topped recently. It's hilarious.    I fucking love Reiji    DM would be GOAT if Kaiba was a girl.    But then he wouldn't be Judai. He would be Homura Akemi.  With Johan as Madoka.      I miss Sora.     They kept the same pose  Noice     See <br/>     Already ahead of you    I can imagine the guy's face is like Yugi. Doro! Monsta caado! Gohyakku damegee! Doro! Monsta caado! Gohyakku damegee! Doro! Super caado- BASAKA SOUR!       The rest has to stay male, otherwise it doesn't work.      This is not an opinion, this is a fact.  Shou is finally happy that someone, especially a girl, is talking to him, and gets pissed that FemJudai is only using him to get to Ryo   Asuka is jealous that a new girl, especially a Slifer Slacker, is performing better and getting more attention than her   Jun is pissed that a Slifer Slacker humiliates him, especially a girl, but starts to feel all tsundere for FemJudai   Kenzan and FemJudai become best friends in a perfectly platonic relationship   Ryo at first ignores FemJudai's advances, but after their climactic duel that ends in a tie he starts to show her more attention, then becomes fluster when Rei arrives on the scene to compete with FemJudai   Edo's character revolves around being over-the-top in an attempt to gain FemJudai's affections   Daitokuji wants to rape FemJudai   Samejima treats FemJudai as the daughter he never had   relationship with Johan remains the same                 You guys really don't give me too much hope with Eccentric Archfiend, now it looks like it will be Secret here.     Why are the red girl uniforms lewder than the yellow or blue uniforms? Is it the thing highs?    Eccentric Archfiend is a generic, R4-ready, self-destructing piece of eye-candy.   I think it's the color.       Blue girls uniform looks really ugly, red girls bolero jacket a qt    Wasn't Rei like 10 at that point?    I'm more amazed at the fact that she was developing a cleavage at such young age.    In the Japanese version he's 11 when she first shows up and ~14 when Judai graduates.  She also went from an A-cup to a D-cup in one summer.      I wanna say she was 13 since she was supposed to be starting middle school then.    More reasons to be secret...    That's not a D.     She also went from an A-cup to a D-cup in one summer.  She should share whatever water she was drinking with Kotori      R4-Ready.   She's level 3 though.      It's a D when you're like 4'10" and have an itty-bitty waist. Spoilered because 3DPD, she's a 28D.   No, because then Kotori wouldn't be Kuwabara's pedobait.   Scale 3.

In just 4 days an exciting tournament arc will be underway and we'll finally have some more Underworld Troupe cards.    Can you give me a pic of the best pendulum magician monsters (and other cards) to use in a deck for both Synchro and Xyz?     Best charmer, best girl.     is what you want   Will Yuya get a Kuriboh? Is Winged Kuriboh even useful? I remember it showing up in GX once and the audience going gogogo over how cute it was.    he thinks Sawatari will duel on screen instead of getting enjoyed the fuck out by Tojiro offscreen     Yes, what the fuck? Have you ever heard of the Kuriboh OTK    The only useful Kuriboh is Rainbow Kuriboh from Zexal    Eh? What's that?    Creating a Winged Kuriboh who can attack twice with 5000+ Atk and not be effected by S/Ts    Battle Fader.    So far every protagonist in Yugioh has gotten a Kuriboh except Yuya: Yugi: Kuriboh, Kuribandit Judai: Winged Kuriboh Yusei: Junkuriboh Yuma: Rainbow Kuriboh Would Yuya get an Entermate Kuriboh clone?          Would Yuya get an Entermate Kuriboh clone?  Except for Yuseis none of the Kuribohs have been particularly related to the MCs archtypes     Probably Kuriboh Magician Pendulum.    I expect he'll get an Entermate Kuriboh. I wonder what side characters will have their own Kuriboh clone since 5Ds had Ruka with Kuribon and Zexal had Kaito with Kuriphoton.  Maybe Yuzu will get something similar that support the Melodious monsters, since the other characters wouldn't really work well (e.g. Shun, Reiji, etc). Though a Superheavy Samurai version of the Kuriboh clone would be amusing, if only to see what it would look like.  Though if a non-Yuya character got a Kuriboh then it would probably be Yuzu (because cuteness), Sora (a Fluffal Kuriboh clone wouldn't look out of place), or Yuri (purely to reference the link Judai had with Winged Kuriboh).   Perhaps Yuya will get a Kuriboh related to Yusho's archetype or will just be a generic Kuriboh that supports Pendulum monsters in general. This would allow the Kuriboh to support any Pendulum deck if you wanted to. I wouldn't be surprised if the ARC-V Kuriboh is a Pendulum monster just because BUY PENDULUMS, PENDULUM SUMMON IS THE GREATEST.                 I shall take this cutes things as my breed material if you don't mind.         Wow, just saw it now.  Props to Percy for the quality on the card pics this last update (Ygopro).     Serena stays with me, the rest you can have.   Yuya won't get a Kuriboh. They don't have a mouth, they can't egao.    You could draw the fur or shadows to give it the illusion it has a mouth.     Implying he wont get Kuriegao.     You mean Yuzuboh.    No, Kuriegaoh. When it smiles it reveals it's gigantic cheshire shark teeth grin .     Reiji, this new card you designed for me is nice, but is there anyway you could make some of its fur into twintales?     Take the rest, but leave the semen archfiend for me.    Northwemko is already taken by me, anon. You can have the rest.         Mieru.   Always close.   But will never get them right.       Northwemko a shit.   Anyone tried out the Speedroids yet?   I'm more hype for BLS, but why they made the Ritual EARTH is beyond me.   Because I am in a good mood I am going to say this.  How can you fuck a vampire without getting killed? Also vampires loving sex is just a lie.    Not Ruri.  Your boner will die before taking half of her clothes.  Goddess, plus fucking someone with a long ass hair is troublesome.  Topkek, demon, that's all.  Isn't she into bestiality?  Believe me they will.  I did, and they were like YAHOOOOOOOOO.                     Is this reportable?    Because of GAIA THE FIERCE KNIGHT.  You got a decklist for them? I want to YAHOOOOOO as well.      Can we share?    But the New Gaia cards are either dark or light.    Because the original was earth.    The difference is that the new set is made to be a chaos deck. He looks fun to use, but a dead card in your grave is not very good in the current game and I don't know if a single ritual card will be useful in a deck not built around rituals.     hurr durr it's the wrong attribute so it's bad  You're everything wrong with this community.     Adding Hurr durr in greentext doesn't do much to counter an argument.   Post cardfus deck, either meta or fun.  I don't need to put one because I have a social life C:     I get what you're saying, but I think this new BLS ritual stuff is more of an appeal to nostalgia than an attempt to make something that's actually relevant to the meta.    More like an appeal, it's making a nostalgia monster playable in the current meta, regarding the fact if it is a high tier or not.    It's also working with Gaia the Fierce Knight cards, of which they printed a new one, and which is also an Earth attribute.    If only Redox was with us still. Him and Tempest didn't deserve the banhammer.     I don't mind what they're doing at all. The Red-Eyes set was nice, even if they had some odd decisions in it. Blue-Eyes had a boost before and Timaeus and Clear Eternal Soul actually made Dark Magicians useable.  I wonder what they'll do next though. There weren't that many actual archetype decks in DM, most were type or attribute based. Bigger Machine Kings, perhaps?     Celtic Guardian archetype NAO.    Redox was pretty bullshit, though. He deserves a Limit, and Tempest deserves a semi at most.    And Mystical Elf.     CHI CHI CHI      Having a social life   Posting in 4chan about cardfus deck  AY QUE ME LOL XD        I'm waiting for the other Dice Tuner. Not a fan of combining decks, and they seem to be better pure.     Not a fan of combining decks  Tell me about staple s/t, do you use those?     Yes, why?     not Swordsman of Landstar   not full blown anti meta Jinzo with spell and effect negation       obnoxious celtic guardian   annoying celtic guardian   irritating celtic guardian   etc  And they're all immune to a different set of monsters        just wondering. Do you look down on people who do combine decks to make things work better, or do you just do it out of personal preference?    Personal preference. I do think some decks run better pure, others really need some outside help, and when they are meant to (Magicians and Performapals) I'm fine.

I like how she's apparently also invisible to the game devs.    They wanted everyone to experience Sherry's intimate side. Like when she caresses your dick with a spell card.    Why didn't Yusei go for Sherry? She's beautiful, european, and rich. What's more to want?    I actually have a question about Tag Force  I just started playing Tag Force 4 and 5 today and I want to bring my deck from Tag Force 4 to 5. How do I do that? I already loaded my save in Tag Force 5 and I'm in the deck menu     why is she so smug? and why does she make my dick diamonds.    Because you like sluts.     She makes your dick diamonds because she is so smug. She is smug because she knows she can easily make your dick diamond.    I was reluctant to watch the anime because smug-chan is so perfect in the manga. Then I marathoned the season in one sitting when i heard her voice. Perfect VA for smug-chan. Somehow made her even more perfect. Who cares about the shitty plot and insufferable MC, smugchan was worth sitting through 12 episodes of mediocre trash all by herself.   the last time i felt that way about a great character in a shitty series was Kazuma in Kaze no Stigma.          /thread    Quick, I need to see more of her smug face         why does she make my dick diamonds  Its all in the VA.    Why does Guren, that sexy fuck, have such a fantastic harem?   Hayamin is 90%, but the character design is based too.         Smug lolis are always sexy.     I want to break that smug.   I want to lick that neck.   Vampire please go.    If anyone deserves a harem, it's Guren.    Because the smug is just an emotional cover-up, a self-pritection.  It's those few, far-apart moments when she goes full dere (pic related) that make her attractive. The rest of time, you tolerate the smug because you are focused on not missing one of those incredible dere flashes.       tolerating the smug   not embracing it       Don't stop     Can't embrace a shit show    waifufags     tolerate   embrace  Either works. What you get in the end is still pic related. And it's DIAMONDS.         Stay mad vampire, smugchan will seize mc's chastity and not you. Your fate is elsewhere, to pick up the trumpet.      They did that scene justice. And those little noises the seiyuu was making... MY DICK     All the "waifufag" threads always have plenty of Guren/Kureto/Ferid/Crowley/Mahiru/Y<wbr>u talk in them too.</wbr>    Does anyone like Goshi?     Nobody does Smug like Saori Hayami, noted lounge singer.  https://<span>youtu.be/4SFavXl4J7A?t=582  [ ]  She even looks smug IRL most of the time. Go look up her picture and try to find one where it doesn't look like she's incredibly impressed with herself.          She always does that pretty much.  https://<span>youtu.be/aQyY1yfC8p4?t=647  [ ]       Great but not the best or sexiest loli in the series since that belongs to Krul.     Saori Hayami is never really a bad choice and just knows how to stand out. Only time she couldn't improve a character really and make them the show any time she was on screen was Miyuki Shiba because they gave her literally absolutely nothing to work with beyond ONII-SAMA!  Even here she's finding a way to stand out and she's not even really doing anything. All that other trash is wearing skirts and color coordinated outfits but you see she's too good for that so she'll just take the actual servers one.      Krul has a severe impediment of her fukkboi being a gay autist.  unless Krul is actually a shota in disguise     They set a giant loose among midgets.      shota in disguise   Possible.       Miyuki was a treasure, you monster. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rL-<wbr>nx3FXZF4</wbr>  [ ]      You can pretty much always pick Hayamin out in a seiyuu group shot because she towers over just about everyone aside from maybe Haruka Tomatsu. The average height for a woman in Japan is 158cm. Both are 164.      and why does she make my dick diamonds.  Shit characters tend to do that to anons.     Everyone is actually a shota in disguise.    Guren/Shinoa Mahouka AU art when    Smug/Angry Hayami is literally the only time her voice acting isn't complete shit tier.    I wanted to die about fifteen seconds in. Jesus Christ.    How can you live with such shit taste. Her soft voice while she's saying onii-chan is the best thing ever.    She's amazing in Yamada    Ugly 3dpd VAs ruin my perfect delusions.     liking her soft voice   enjoying the essence of ear cancer      Take it to      being an uncurable homosexual and fag  I feel sorry for you. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=h1A<wbr>YrdNrWC8</wbr>  [ ]      Keep your ugly whores out of /a/ - 2D/Random.     Not him but normalfag pls go    So who is this Kururu slut I keep hearing about?    The most perfect being in the universe and also best girl. I want her to step on me.       those bony arms  Fuck, it seems she really does everything to look good, even if it's unhealthy. I wish people wouldn't care about looks that much, she's actually cute anyway. And we don't like her for her body.     The enemy of humankind        bony arms   Murrifat with big bones detected.       Every time I see an OnS thread I want to self insert into the show and go full Father Andersen mode on everyone    Not murrican, but look at her shoulders and wrists. They are a bit too anorexic. Otherwise her arms would be good, I like girls with fragile looks. I just hope she's perfectly okay, okay?     But muh 2.5D     That's fairly normal size for an asian. A bit below-average, but not anorexic.   http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51056540</wbr>     She's pretty good. Shame she's smelly dumb vampire scum.     No.    you shouldn't have sat through 12 full episodes and just skipped through if all you were looking for were such scenes  she's absolutely not a loli  Krul was best girl  this guy gets it  Smug slug is disgusting            Mika, stop shitposting    I'm sorry the truth hurts.   She's the best waifu and Yu-kun knows it.   How about we praise a cute immortal loli vampire instead?      Mika, pls go.   I don't get it. She doesn't look smug.   Watch the anime or read the manga.  You'll get it.      muh vampire nigga    Oh lord, that face.    Never, she doesn't want oniisama     Whahaha~ What are we going to do in the SUV?    Nothing since you're too goddamn short.   Hayami Saori and Aoi Yuuki always voice best girls.      I love her. I love her so damn much.        Under 150 cm and small everything   Implying not loli  LRD pls go.             O-oh! You heard m-me Shinoa-senpai? Oh my, I guess you found out ehehehe  So... uhh WILL YOU GO OUT WITH ME AND PROMOTE THE CONTINUATION OF THE HUMAN RACE WITH MANY CHILDREN?!           Y-you too.     I thought I was going to hate that little fag but he actually turned up to be quite likeable.    For fuck's sake, Shinoa's not even the smuggest smug to smug this season.     Discount Armin was my favourite character in this show.       I'm with you guys, he's okay in my book.    tfw he will always be a virgin because he's too beta in a world of alphas          Shinoa will never be your boss      Who's this semen demon?    Why is she so perfect?        I don't get it. She doesn't look smug.  that's gotta be bait.   watch the anime or read the manga she's condensed and purified SMUG; and it's boner inducing.        Why is she so perfect?  it's the smug.  it's the constant trolling it's the small beautiful dere moments it's the fact she's not a tsundere it's the fact she's tiny and perflat  frankly, she's the best anime/manga girl in a long time to come out of area 11.            NTR'd in front of Ferid and the entire world  I'm pretty sure Mika's rage could power several jetpacks.    I DON'T WANT NOBODY TO GET KILLED     I'LL COME AND GET YOU, I AM ALWAYS READY TO FIGHT    SO DON'T TAKE ALL THE BLAME, WE ARE ALL AS BAD    I want to have my own Shinoa      DON'T TAKE ALL OF THE WEIGHT. YOU ALLWAYS DO    Don't worry. Unlike 3D girls there is an infinite supply of Shinoas for all.    WE'LL ALWAYS BE SOMETHING YOU CANNOT CONTROL      I want to have Shinoa figure, shame they care more with fujoshit  She is so cute even while running     Fu pls go.   No you Double Dick      not a gif        I have hope, fucking Asshime got a figure. If they did make a figure of her, it would probably be in the school uniform.   WHO HAS THE FULL ALBUM OF ALL SHINO SMUG TRANSPARENTS?  How many children Shinoa could have?   That depends. How many people are in this thread right now? Take that number and then account for the fact that most couples have around 1-2 children (i have no clue what the actual number is but I don't feel like trying to do numbers right now so that's my guess). Now take the number of people in this thread and have them all partake in sex with Shinoa which results in 1 or 2 childs. That's about how many.    But I would have way more babies with Shinoa than two. We would make our own smug football team.    CUCKED U C K E D         The kids in this show are so fucking dumb. The vampires basically have one strategy: Backflip behind you really fast. They do that constantly and you fall for it EVERY TIME.    But they do it super fast, anon.    Also, I just re-watched the few seconds after that. Where the hell was blue going? Coldsteel and drills went in the opposite direction.    Blue is Chess, Coldsteel is Crowley and drills is Horn. Just for future reference.    So swing around in a circle at all times and they can't touch you.    I knew Crowley but not the other two. Chess and Horn are retarded names.     Mika turns evil due to getting NTR'd   I can see it.      That is normal.    Well, anyone has a right to be smug when they're on the verge of dethroning Hanazawa.    Chess likes to play chess, Horn likes being horny  There is nothing wrong with that name      if only less than %1 women understood this concept. instead theyre all pathetic balls of crying and insecurity and no fun whatsoever.  oh wait maybe its the same for men       Banter is God's gift to man and we have neglected it      because smug is sexy OP    But she is cute anon.    how do those thighhigh feet smell like after a day running around in those boots?    But i won't share Shinoa with anyone   feetfags pls      It's not like I like Smug-chan or anything But I wouldn't mind r-ruffling her hair a little    Sex hair is always best hair.    Why don't they genetically engineer humans who have second faces looking backwards and two more arms bending back? They would be invincible to vampires.    Why do girl running like that?    Is she the Smuggernaut?    ask your mom    Isn't she already way too old for your taste, you old pedro?   This thread lacks happy shinoa   More sexy Shinoa.    You tried but you failed.     This threads needs to see more of her frusrated/despair face.   http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=42986852 Is this sexy? </wbr>    I think I ruptured my dick.    http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=manga&amp;illust_id=50478636</wbr>    Lewd    muh dick   Why did I finish this shitty show?  It's pretty terrible but I somehow didn't stop watching it.     Because of Smug-chan.   キャラクターデザイン門脇聡さんによる落書きのセラフ。 本日はクルル！1巻発売日なので正月的な雰囲気で！ 宣伝おーた #終わりのセラフ  New official twitter icons: http://owarino-seraph.jp/special/tw<wbr>itter.html</wbr>   Krul no shiro de odoritai.     that cute little kureto  I want a phone strap with his tiny frowny face on it now.    Vampire information (translated by  http://gomigeemu.tumblr.com/post/12<wbr>2336278313/vampire-information</wbr> ):  Page 122:  VAMPIRE Subtitle: A detested race that sucks living blood.  Picture caption: The amount of vampires that drink to excess outweigh those who will not let their partner die.  Header: The leaders of an apocalyptic world Article: Rather than humans, currently they are the ones who control the world’s surface. While 8 years ago they lived underground without human’s knowledge, when the world ended they appeared on the surface. They want to world to remain stable, so they broke the taboo and proposed to overthrow humans.  Box: The vampire’s biology  Header: Red eyes and pointed ears Explanation: They possess beautiful nihilistic eyes and pointed ears. The eyes are effective in the dark, and even when things are pitch black they can distinguish someone several hundred meters away.  Header: Pointed fangs Explanation: They’re well-shaped to pierce human skin and help easily drain blood. In the circumstances one is forced to have a vampire bite them, it leaves two small marks.  Header: A body that doesn’t age Explanation: At the very least they live for several hundred years, and no matter for how long they keep their youthful appearance. How powerful they are depends on how long they’ve lived.  Header: Ultra-violet ray neutralizing equipment Explanation: They have equipment to neutralize the effect ultra-violet rays can have on their body, which produces a toxin when exposed to it. On the occasion that vampires, who hate sunlight, go to the surface, they are sure to wear it.                            Header: A body 7 times more powerful than a human Explanation: Including their leg and arm strength, their entire power transcends that of a human. Furthermore, they can be brought back to life and torn off limbs can also instantaneously be reattached.  Box: How to defeat a vampire Explanation: You could try to destroy the vampire’s head, but destroying the ultra-violet rays equipment located on their left arm while they’re under sunlight would do it. Also, weapons like demon gear and so on’s curses that work against vampires are effective. However, there is the difficulty of the overwhelming power and offensive they can inflict.  Page 123:  Header: Humans changing into a vampire Article: By having a human drink their blood, the human in question’s body transforms. Only nobles have the authority to give their blood. However, due to vampires hating to increase their numbers, there is generally not much chance to do this.  Caption: According to how Mika was changed into a vampire thanks to Krul, they receive their Master’s power, and he was bestowed with high battle prowess.  Stamp: Results Report of secret intelligence activity Header: About the system and laws of vampire society Article: The vampires whom have no interests outside of blood desire a stable world and established a law to prevent the human population from decreasing. Committing to this, the high ranking nobles and founders ensure that there are sanctions in place. Everyone conscientiously leads a life observing these regulations, but there is no little amount of vampires who consider it troublesome.  Krul picture title: There’s to be no touching of taboo experiments Krul picture caption: According to the high ranking founders, things tied to the world’s collapse are absolutely taboo.  Lacus picture title: Drinking blood directly from the source is prohibited Lacus picture caption: Due to vampires killing their partners, there is an obligation to indirectly drink blood.

Smugtrolldere loli with ZR is instant diamond material.    http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=50357521</wbr>     Header: Ultra-violet ray neutralizing equipment   Explanation: They have equipment to neutralize the effect ultra-violet rays can have on their body, which produces a toxin when exposed to it. On the occasion that vampires, who hate sunlight, go to the surface, they are sure to wear it.  I think the anime removed hers for no apparent reason       Header: Ultra-violet ray neutralizing equipment  Shouldn't they wear helmets too then? This magic bs doesn't make any sense.     I don't think the concept of magic got to you    Well the magic of that pic certainly got to me.      Scans when?    when you buy it and scan for us    If it doesn't get scanned by cour 2 then maybe I will.    She makes my dick diamonds too. Her whole family does     Her whole family does  Good taste.      They must have some superb genes.      Kureto  Good fucking taste but Shinya is best boy but Kureto is a very close second     Other than Skrillex all of them (even Robodad) are pretty attractive in looks and personality.     I think the anime removed hers for no apparent reason  The reason is called budget.     Shinya is a foster child, but he sure is best boy.    You really think they didn't bother to draw 2 thick line because they weren't given another 10 dollars?    Polar opposite opinion for me. I hate the anime and her voice in it. In the manga I like her though. I was expecting something cooler/deeper, maybe slightly seductive. She sounds too bratty and high pitched for a smug character.    Was that the best scene of the season? Or was it Shinoa driving?    Less popular characters get figures so I don't see why she wouldn't. But the marketing and merch for this show is predominantly fujo, true. I don't think there's even a magazine spread with her.     inb4 obvious joke that she's too small for a magazine spread     The car scene was the best comedy, but the hospital is the sweetest.    Actually, that is the lyrics to the full song. The lyrics in the thread were specific to the op for the anime.    What if Shinoa became a vampire?  Would you serve her? Let her suck your blood?     Well ok then Kureto is best full blooded boy    Krul is basically vampire Shinoa    I want to see both mothers one day.   I want to suck her blood   I want a gold statue of robodad's dick for making such fine specimens    There's no "we are all as bad", and it's not like the TV Size changes lyrics from the full one. I bet you all took the lyricalnonsense one as the official one.    even skrillex ? if yes , you would be the first person ever who likes him     http://artbooksnat.tumblr.com/post/<wbr>118615740122/owari-no-seraph-newtyp<wbr>e  Does this count as a spread?  </wbr></wbr>    Probably.  My apologies.      No not that guy, he is bottom of the Hiragi list   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127118577   self-confident girls   implying it's not all a facade for all the shit she suffered and she isn't going to breakdown soon  Gap moe     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127118577   Queen Hayamin brainwashes us every season  I'm surprisingly okay with this.     I want to know how Skrillex even ended up like that. Did Kureto and Mahiru get all the parental attention so he had to make do with himself?    The vibe I get from robodad is that he wasn't really there for the kids and just wanted to spread the seed    maybe his dad ditched him because of his hairstyle    Seishiro is just a free spirit.   Shinoa is cute! CUTE!   In Shinoa's case. she's just enjoying the parts of life she can.    you will never fire 120mm DU rounds at vampires    Skrillex would look fine if it wasn't for that haircut.    Shinoa is a short treasure.       How would you react if a Captain autism is introduced into the story?  Various LN info (by  http://sosese.tumblr.com/post/12234<wbr>9169280/about-guren-ichinose-and-ma<wbr>hiru-hiragi-spoiler</wbr></wbr> ): 1. Guren and Mahiru slept together after Guren confessed he still has feelings for her after all these years. later on, Guren called and told Shinya about it. 2. Mahiru tried to turn Guren into a demon. Guren was infected by the curse. After woken from coma, he volunteered to be a test subject. 3. Guren got a list of names consist of all the children being human-experimented on by the Hyakuya cult 8 years ago, including Yuichiro, Mika, Yoichi, Kimizuki and his sister.The list was given to him by Mahiru 8 years ago before her death. 4. He used the list to recruit members for Shinoa’s squad. That is why he is able to create so many curse gear user. 5. Kureto threatened to kill Guren’s father if he refuses to kill Mahiru.There is no mention of how Mahiru died so far.         later on, Guren called and told Shinya about it.  This made me laugh. Poor Shinya.    Will Mika end up with Krul? How does this author handle anti hero characters like him? I'd really hope he doesn't continue some downward spiral without making new bonds. I'm still trying hard to see the reason they even separated him from his friend.   poor shinya     later on, Guren called and told Shinya about it.  This fucking guy     I can't not seeing him as MIcheal Jackson. Those feminine eyes, fuck it.     Guren called and told Shinya about it.  Guren a qt shit.   Kureto threatened to kill Guren’s father if he refuses to kill Mahiru.  Damn. Poor Guren.         fingersthatiputinurfiancee.jpg    It's a real shame she's stuck in such a trash series.    see this blood? it's not mine     She is perfect.   Does anyone know if the BD have been already ripped?   Is it out already?     Hey Shinya smell my fingers     June 24    STOP COPYING EVERY SINGLE THING I SAY AND TURNING IT INTO SOMETHING WEIRD  She's smug because she's a Muslim, and Islamic terrorists successfully took over the world       Guren called and told Shinya about it.   Fuck you Guren.      I wonder how that conversation went    Mahiru looks quite smug too Is she?      "Hey mate, what's up? Remember your fiancee, that one you are in love with? Well, I just fucked her. We cool right? See ya in the next mission"     She's the original Ahaha~   I enjoy the parts where Shinoa gets toldasaurus rexd by Guren. Messing around is fine, but when the trolling gets too much, people need to be put in their place.   All he has to do is remind her of her crush on Yuu.    I'm sure shipping them is part of his master plan.   Should I read the manga first or can I watch the anime and go blind?   Probably a bit tense.    She's Master Smug. If they'll ever adapt the LN I'd like also her to be dubbed by Hayamin.    Manga first.    She needs to be Noto Mamiko, the original    Oh, she could be fine too   How many children does she have with Yuu?   A boy and a girl. The girl teases his brother relentlessly.     his  Fuck. I meant her.     thread <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;2451270    500+ hours in paint    I am dumb,     It's really shit invest another 500 hours.    I'd enjoy that.   No need no know how to read moonrunes.  No need to know how to real at all.    Oh, thanks, almost didn't see this thread. Just use the Keyman filedrop if you wouldn't mind, I might not always see these.  This shit looks like its meant for eight year olds   This is why we don't have nice things    I just invited an anon from a different country over last weekend and enjoyed it together with him.   Thanks.  Once this generation of producers, writers and directors is over, do you think Eva will FINALLY lose all its relevance and the industry will be able to move on?   Madoka is the anime of Evangelion     the Christian symbolism was put in just because they thought it looked cool   WHAT DO THE TEXTS AND CROSSES MEEN?   simply sasuga        and seriously, EVA didn't save anime in any way whatsoever  Let me laugh at you.     This. Before EVA was made... anime didn't even have stories. And it was in black and white.     go ahead, if it makes you stop being butthurt you favorite anime only made some japs rich at the expense of the very same otaku retards they mocked.    My Youth Romantic Comedy Is Wrong As I Expected    Dman. 8an is fast with the recorder    Yuri rape confirmed    How come in the first volume, it clearly states red ribbon differentiates the grades in the school. Implying that the other grades should have different color ribbons. But here, Iroha has a red ribbon also? I just started reading this.    Don't ask, just enjoy them.    Does anyone actually want this? I feel like I'm wasting my time uploading if not.   Was I the only one who hated Yurika's seiyuu?   Mahou shoujos are supposed to project an aura of confidence, but Yurika's seiyuu sounded like she was afraid of being alive.     Anon, if you like LNshit that's fine. Just please don't pretend your preferred LNshit is any different than the rest.    Excuse me? Yurika's voice was the only reason why I watched this useless show.      OnC/Horizon is fairly different      All your criticism are sweeping generalizations. The type of media does not define its quality.  Do you hate harem just because it's harem even if it's justified from the first episode? Methinks you just made conclusions about it and started telling everyone who would listen it was LNshit.      Kawakami is very much different than most LN authors. His stuff is good.   You haven't addressed anything I've said. You're just plugging your ears and whining that I criticized the series. It's an LN harem, and the farther the plot goes along the more it's going to lose it's charm and originality and the more it's going to be generic haremshit. If the series doesn't lead into him being the reincarnation of that legendary blue knight they talked about and doesn't have him literally become a time traveling hero for every girl, I will eat the pants I'm wearing right now.    </blockquote>]
