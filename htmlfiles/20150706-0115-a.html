[ Are you ready to starting working anon?  <br/>  <br><br>Thank god she can't cut her hair.</br></br>  <br>this is moe anime retard</br>  <br>She can go bald.</br>  Anyone else felt a long delay between lines when they were talking? It just seemed so slow compared to what previous seasons  S≈çma is the red man.<br> Alice is best girl </br>  <br>I refer you to<br><br/></br></br>  <br>hey black shirt dude</br>  Erina is the best Blanka.  <br> Meat looks like a slut even when she is dressed as the other character </br>  <br>Ma Po Tofu is P good<br>Would eat again at a Chinese, or make it/10<br><br>Just makes me wonder how good it would be from a top tier chef.</br></br></br></br>  AOTYAY  <br>Why is Goten wearing that weird chinese outfit?</br>  <br>She should have just been a tomboy and a housewife.</br>   Chichi is still hot <br> Videl is even hotter </br>  <br><br>Hes wasting time being a fucking farmer in a time of peace. He wasted 3 days doing nothing just before the Cell games.<br><br>With that in mind, its impossible for him to TELEPORT to his son and daughter in law and visit for a single fucking hour? Get real</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's true, back when I watched DBZ you never heard anything about Japanese shit, it was just the english version as it was supposed to be. Now they ruin it all with this shit. Bring back Rock the Dragon.</br>  Who on earth would want to lick lolibutt? That just sounds really gross.  <br>Just for your information: we know you're joking, but it is so absurd that it's just hard not to comment on it.</br>  Moetan was the shit.  <br>Back when we had real loli fanservice.</br>  <br>Where did the good ol days go?</br>  <br>lolis probably don't even wipe their butts properly.</br>  What does /a/ think of Charlotte, AOTS?  O  <br>edge</br>  <br>Too chuuni for me. I'm tired of these types of shows.<br><br> HS <br> super powers <br> other students have super powers <br> let's battle </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's kind of out of context</br>  <br>U</br>  Berg Katze is so lucky. I wish I could be trapped inside that ribbon and spend all day resting against Hajime-chan's boobs.  <br>I like to think that she's from a planet where it's culturally accepted to go around naked because it's the easiest way to share life energy or something. Then she was sent to earth and OD and pai-pai tell her that she couldn't walk around naked in public because it's indecent or something.<br>Thus, she has to wear a dress or school uniform outside but when she's inside the Gatchaman headquarters, she only wears the bare minimum since she can't be entirely naked.</br></br>  Why did I want the new girl to have Kansai-ben?  <br>above 5K most shows pay off their production, then comes figure, OST, books, 9-10K is exceptional well<br>10-20K is mad money<br>20K&lt; we all get vacation in Bahamas</br></br></br>  <br>I assume it's something similar to what you suggested. Rui was probably slated to become a Gatchaman and Katze simply took advantage of that. If he could create Gatchas at will, what would have stopped him from creating a super powerful gatcha army instead of those puny Crowds created by Rui's gatcha ability?</br>  <br>That probably applies to CROWDS too. (If it performed bad it'd never have gotten a second season.)</br>  What makes an anime a 10/10?  Would you like a 2nd season of Ben-To?     Anime has an interesting concept about Fight Club with food <br> Halfway in it becomes just another haremshit LN <br> You guys still eat it up <br><br>Fuck you, I don't care about girls. I want Satu to beat up a metric fuckload of guys for some discount meat.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yes.<br><br>That is all.</br></br></br>  How do I get between them?  <br>Ben 10?</br>  DO IT<br><br> JUST DO IT<br><br> START A ANIMU ON YOUR BACKLOG<br><br> YESTERDAY YOU SAID TOMORROW<br><br> SO MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE<br><br> WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?<br><br> DON'T LET YOUR DREAMS BE DREAMS<br><br> JUST<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127625791#p127625791">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it all started from black twitter when some guy made and posted this picture.<br>It was posted on /tv/ which became a meme. Whenever someone with a silly haircut is posted it usually starts the "just fuck my shit up" word chain.<br>Later the meme merged with brendan frasier.<br>Then the "just do it" thing came later and also merged with the meme.</br></br></br></br>  <br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wq7t<wbr>tau76_Y</wbr>  [ ]<br>Zawa zawa</br></br>  <br>It's not that but something else /tv/ related<br><br><br>anyways how come this thread is still up?</br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sJG<wbr>mvyH7EMM</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>based toonami edition.</br></br>  <br>Yes, you can!</br>  It's airing now.  cute butt  How gay is it?  It doesn't start until about 5 minutes from now and they are airing the live-action part today.  <br>So many 2d Idols around me.<br><br>I want to hug them all.</br></br></br>  Anime with the worst endings:  TWGOK.<br><br>That last story arc + second worst girl winning was just absolutely horrendous.<br><br>I'm still upset.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You managed to reach the end? <br><br><br>Also, Blood Lad. 10 episodes hyping up to some massive event that never happened. Just an abrupt ending without any resolve.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're not telling me you made it through each episode up to the end right? WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU? WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?</br>  <br>New True Tears right here.</br>  <br><br><br><br> School Days <br><br>BITCH FUCKING DESERVED IT.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Muromi-san~  <br>levia makes me have a fish fetish</br>  myribswhen s2 never   S2 never   <br>It is summer so most anon that watch that are hibernating</br>  <br>neve4get anderson</br>  AOTS?  <br> it's the same reason why society won't put in things like parenting license to prevent all the bad shit from happening in the first place. <br><br>No, its society deciding they don't want to fucking live in an Orwellian fiction novel.</br></br></br>  <br>gotta be urethra or belly-button; ears and nostrils come in pairs.</br>  Rebecca Silverman of ANN totally slandered the episode saying the anti-sex ordinance and the rebellion was trying to excuse train groping. Pure slander. The episode was showing off how false accusations can and will be misused with such heavy handed punishments.  <br>Nothing that grand. People just fear to be on the losing end of such controls, don't worry about other parents treating their kids like shit, excuse themselves if they treat their own kids like shit, find it hard to rigorously identify any long reaching effects of such shit, and don't trust anyone enough with power to enact any sort of regulation given the prior four factors.</br>  <br><br>I don't know if you saw the anime, Psycho Pass but that world worked and didn't have the fear mongering you two are spewing.</br></br>  BEST HAREM MC IN YEARS<br><br>My cant more harem MCs save his waifu from rape by killing the perpetrator?</br></br>  <br>baba go home</br>  <br>fedora.</br>  <br>There's plenty of other guys to take his role. <br><br>Next 10 chapters, all the males of the island start the rebellion against the NTRing mainlander.<br>They all die, island is his.<br>Literally swimming in pussy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yukari <br> 17 </br></br>  <br>Off-topic, but anyone know what the font is where he says "Like they were insects"?</br>  No one hyped for Overlord?

Though I doubt they have the need to go full shitpost overdrive.</br>  <br>True form</br>  <br>Her real form, all the servants are monsters or demons and the humanoid model/AI programming is just to mask it. She was True Vampire and iirc only Origin Vampire was more hideous.</br>  <br><br>nice</br></br></blockquote>]
