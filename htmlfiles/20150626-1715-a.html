I accept your concession then.    How isn't Hidamari comfy though?    K-On is comfy and fun up until episode 20 of season 2. After that the vibe turns melancholic. It's definitely one of the best SoLs ever but if you're going for comfy all around there are better like Hidamari, Yuru Yuri or Lucky Star    Motion sickness isn't comfy.    It wasn't that way originally. Fucking KyoAnus.   Non non biyori Soremachi Hidamari sketch     The manga was too simple since it's just a 4koma, KyoAni made it better by adding more complexity and emotions.     he doesn't like SHAFT, the objectively second best anime studio behind KyoAni     sure isn't  but I can't imagine how something like that could give you motion sickness       just a 4koma   the complexity and emotions were added by KyoAni  Admit it. You haven't read it.      Oh you're the same troll from yesterday's thread. Fuck off.      Just read shit, fam.     My nigga.  Maybe he's just a goddamn pussy.        No Usagi Drop? Why?     You know exactly why, there's a pretty huge reason WHY    You think a SoLfag knows what that is?    Nyan passu    I love daughteru shows. I steered clear of the manga though.     It's popular as fuck.   Yuyushiki   The series starts out with the kid's grandfather dying and she turning out to be an illegitimate child. How the fuck is that comfy?    Literally this.     It was pretty shitty and I don't understand why there's weekly threads or any hope of S2  There are way better shows out there, what makes Yuyushiki so special?       This   I want to check this out, should I watch Cinderella girls or the first one(not mecha) ?  It doesn't matter. They're both about totally different casts of characters. Also, Cinderella Girls isn't even over yet; they're just taking a seasonal break.  Why don't you actually look up what each series is and realize you're retarded?  It's been a while since we had a Clamp thread. What your favorite series? Which series would you like to get an anime? Do you have a favorite character? Do you want a remake of CCS? Who is the prettiest female OR male?  I would like to see X finally get finished. It's been over 12 years already. I think they have alot of good stuff and they produce some beautiful artwork but it would be nice if they didn't jump around as much as they do.  Most of Clamp's stuff has had some sort of anime adaptation but I would like to see some good studio take on Gate 7. Maybe have them do an OVA collection where each OVA covers a volume in material.      The X movie is beautiful as hell to look at but it falls short on almost every other part.    Favorite series  CCS   Series to get an anime   I'm a filthy secondary and haven't read any of the source materials, so I can't answer.   Favorite Character  Tomoyo   Remake of CCS?  I really want one, but CLAMP is likely to fuck it up somehow.   Prettiest female or male   &gt;implying everyone isn't a bit gay for Yukito                    LURK MOAR    Boku no Pico.

Why don't you just leave it do its own thing. Eat some fucking plants, shit a lot. What the fuck man.    Is that Serena Williams?   To sell the tusks.    this one is just sad     Why would you ever kill an elephant.  sometimes they get to close to villages and destroy their crops or its for their ivory     gotta gi me som ivory mayne.   Ittekimaaasu!  K-kaa-san, Yamete kudasai.      That's depressing.  Fuck       this was the saddest shit ever in this movie    what the fuck's wrong with it?    Chinks will pay out the ass for magic dick tusk magic pills.  And y'know, elephants do have a nasty habit of stomping on farmland and eating villagers crops.      yes  no      food and safety bull elephants regularly kill people and destroy crops     j-just run pleeease    fuck you    never gets old    This. Chinks pay a fucking huge amount of money for this shit. Same goes for turtles from Madagascar.    Lion cub broke its back while hunting with its mom. Lioness left it to die.    I'm Crimean rivers here.    Somehow I didn't find it as bad as that sloth program they advertised with "babies getting pajamas! So cute!"  The weaker baby dies and then the second one refuses to eat or move and dies. Sloths just fucking give up. Like there's a video on youtube of a cougar chasing a sloth and the sloth just closes its eyes in pain and lets go.  Predators have so much more fun than sitting in a tree until an eagle eats you, even lion cub played for a while.   !!!   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=90M<wbr>7kH5wCtA</wbr>  [ ]  damn        Jesus Christ. I couldn't imagine being the photographer just watching that shit unfold and not doing anything about it.    Why'd they have to name the sloth? Why?    SARABA DA!

I'm waiting for a new photo book to come out but it's crowdfunded so it'll take til next year.    those little pink nib tails sticking out over their pantsu line         rulesofnature.mp3     What would you do, Unless you bring it to the zoo of NY it was going to die eventually.     I'm glad you liked my webm from the past thread anon, Here's something more for you.     Pretty sure all photographers encounter that feel at some point.    is that some mondo?    there will never be a nature documentary turned into over the top anime form   S-Sonna....    repeatedly stabbing it when it's already down  Why do niggers ruin everything?     You don't take chances with hippos.    If you're hunting, don't you want to make sure it's dead? I hate this stupid "don't hurt animals!" mentality where everybody assumes they're just killing because they can.     not FROG GUNDAMU, IKIMASU!     Hippos kill the most out of any animal and you DON'T want to be near it if it's angry.     dat sloth qt       Hamtaro gone wild  and wrong .   Ehhhhhh?!  Araragi-san.  shitsurei   Leave the baby hippo alone!  ;_;     The sloth accepting its fate and the crippled lion cub were sad, but seriously, fuck hippos.    Based Hippos    This, hippos are scary    Hippos are  big  animals    It's not like the hippos are killing anything that matters.      yes goyim. It is the dumb brown peoples who are your real enemy!       elephants regularly kill people  [citation needed]   I think you're mistaking elephants for hippos.       You saying humans don't matter? How pro-hippo can you be?       Where were humans mentioned? I thought we were talking about Africans?      black screen, oh oh I dont want to play that webm    There's baby goats and dolphin, trust me.      African nigger reporting in.  Hippos need overkill.  They WILL fight to the very end.  They're insanely tough creatures, even on the brink of death.  You know how white people call brave people "lions"?  Well in much of Africa, brave people were called "Hippos"               That one of the dog chasing the deer   That's all swell and nice, but giving a teeny bit of a distorted view of reality. 99.999999% of the time things don't work out like that. For every 1 dog and monkey pair of buddies, there's 5,000,000,000 wildebeest that are eviscerated and literally eaten alive by hyena.        That's how our ancestors hunted long long ago too.        How fucking tough are they?      I man up and did it, thanks anon    Stop being such a fucking killjoy faggot.    die three hours later in the woods tough    Don't think about it      Lion cub broke its back while hunting with its mom. Lioness left it to die.     MOSHI-MOSH~   Elephants can cry?    did the people rescue it?   OYASUMI   Of course not. Wildlife photographers are liberal assholes who would rather watch animals die on film than help them.   Mitte, mitte!  Itai....   For you   ITADAKIMASU!   omg is it okay??    Rule number one in to not interfere with nature. How they live their lives has worked well for millions of years and as tragic as it may be that lion cub in death will give life back to something else.   Human factory farming is a million times crueler than that but do you think twice about chicken or beef products?      disgusting     daijobu?    I really hate this obsession over 'saving' animals and treating them with rights, oftentimes treating them better than your fellow humans. Interfering with nature is the worst thing you can do.  Sometimes make me wish our culture was similar to asian ones.       It'd be more liberal to intervene you dumbshit     fucking why what the fuck is this obvious the bizon wanted to get away couldn't he get out the fucking way jesus man herbivores are fucking retarded        All that movement open the wound so wide its entire insides spilled out. Daijōbude wa arimasen     tries to bite off its own guts   that's some apostle shit there.      So how much money does random wild animal B deserve to keep it alive instead of being random wild animal T's lunch? Small things in reserves work, but treating something serious that will pull the animal out of any social contact for weeks or months will fuck it over indefinitely unless you pump even more money into reconditioning areas. A guy who's good with a camera isn't the person to rely on for those facilities.    instead of ramming the other bison it could've also just barreled through the wolf pack. "I'm not d-doing this because I like you or anything, b-baka." would be a possibility, yet theat cunt goes all "Keikaku Doori" on it's ass.    Kimochi.....    liberal  stop applying this to fucking everything, holy shit.     Gokuraku, gokuraku...         that feel when southern   that feel when have nursed deer left by their mothers, saved baby birds, fixed broken bones, saved wild animal lives   But please, tell me more about wildlife.           What the fuck    Whoops, didn't mean to quote.     Sometimes make me wish our culture was similar to asian ones  And there's this weeb.     Ok so how would you deal with the lion cub?     Congratulations your a libtard fuck living in the south?  What more do you want to know?       I-ikuuu~    Whoops, looks like someone spilled their yogurt on a bird!     Sometimes make me wish our culture was similar to asian ones.  shut he fuck up please.  wow this thread is full of all kinds of ignorant stage 4 cancer        Liberal has meant "anything I personally disagree with" for years.     it probably doesn't recognize what his intestines are. he just felt pain in that area and tried to pull of what he must've thought was causing it.   Yada.    Calling someone a weeb while on /a/ and shitposting in an offtopic thread  Please.     Fuck, I laughed     bird bukkake     Damn. That bunny looks hella comfy    Wouldn't it be more conservative to not save the cub in this case? If you're liberal, you'd save it, right?   .... CHOTTO MATTE KUDASAI!     implying conservatism is RULES OF NATURE   implying some of the greatest conversationalists and wildlife enthusiasts weren't conservatives      M-Masaka...   Wait, no, I've got it. A lion with wheels!   Kuso!  Fucking nyaaggers!!!    Neeeee-ssssaaan   Shoot it, like a true patriot.    KILL IT WITH FIRE    seriously fuck that smiling piece of shit.   Mou... Owari da...   ugh. The fuck, man    just before someone talks about blood; its not blood, its just the spittle from it.   hurts though       this if you can save it then why the fuck not, just because you save one fucking animal doesn't mean you support some bullshit make believe ideal where you want everything in nature to get along.  you saw some sad shit, so you help the cunt out.      It's almost like people can't just be lumped into two groups based on their beliefs in regards to wildlife and the environment.   Tadaima!  N-nande sugoi??   Americans link everything with politic.

Why people like uninteresting, dull characters like this? I get it, tsundere was a mistake and people hate noisy girls. But this can't be the answer.   In more and more shitty mangos can you find this archetype of the negative character building where you have the A supergirl, who can do shit and have a personality type, B supergirl who can do other shit and have another personality type and so on...  and then you have the contrast blob; a big pile of FUCKING NOTHING, they goo. And the MC likes her, because she has a cunny. I'm so mad about this. Why do authors do this? Why do they make 5 Mary Sues and a Shitty Susan?      Fuck you, m8. You're a fucking pedophile.  Onodera a best.     Kill yourself    Nice response, pedo.    Betas like boring-ass girls because they relate to them.     what I also don't get, how can people fawn over her, when the original didn't even had the character she was only introduced in the serialization.   And it's a huge mistake. Also they dumbed down the MC and left the heroine untouched. Harem settings corrupt everything. It'd have been a nice, straightforward story with only CHitoge but now it's all about shitty fanservice for Derafan otakushit,       Kosaki is shit. Chitoge is superior.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127184051     retarded tripfag can't look at poster count and just assumes everyone on /a/ is the same person    Just end your life you fucking attention whore. Did the lack of love you received from your parents result into you becoming a trip fag or did you just want to show everyone that you're retarded?      I wanted to fuck that bitch pretty hard and mindbreak her into a cockslave    More like Shitoge, amirite?   Aw, poor baby. Look at how upset he is.       Plain and boring no personality deredere has always been the worst dere. Even hajidere is better and more interesting.    Everyone in Nisekoi is shit  Except Ruri       calls a tripfag out   l-look how mad he is!   You're not impressing anyone, just stop.       You Are (Not) Kevin-kun    Liking Kosaki Onodera    Even Lelouch has better taste than you.      Keep making your shit up, m8.    Then why are you replying, you clearly want attention. Just admit it already, it's kind of pathetic honestly.    He's a Sayakfag in the cancerous Madoka generals too    This. There is nothing worse than deredere girls.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127184307  You're right, I should just let him continue being retarded.    How is it pathetic? I've been around here for over 4 years. Do you honestly think you're the first person to "crack the code".  It's more so pathetic that you truly think you're somehow better instead of loser who thinks he's smarter than everyone else.  Get wrecked, m8. Boring girls a best.        because beta nips can only handle bland doll charaters like onodera Rei     Bait  Chiwa isn't deredere like Onodera. She has a personality and bite to her. She's too spunky and competitive to be anything like Onodera.      I'm not even necessarily against deredere, but there's nothing to Dera's character, but that she can decorate food.    What a top quality thread, 10/10 Kill yourselves.     More like Shitoge, amirite?  its funny because you like the worst tsundere Louise      Why people like uninteresting, dull characters like this?    /a/ is mainly comprised of lonely spergs who are too ugly irl to get a gf, so instead of letting themselves get rejected by women over and over they just settle for cartoon girls since they cant reject them. it doesn't matter how poorly written the show or character is to these types of people, as long as the anime can provide them with cute grillz to ease their loneliness they will think it's a masterpiece. i call these types of people "shit eaters".       whole thread getting baited by a single tripfag   Stay mad his name isn't "anon"     Orange is genkidere. Get it right, shiteating Silverfag.   Normal girls are literally the best.   This is scarousing.    Chitoge is better, but Louise is good too, faggot. LN Louise is even great.    put your trip back on    Is she even relevant anymore? I stopped keeping up with the series.   Bset girl is Chiharu        Implying I only like Louise from ZnT.  And get the fuck off of it, m8. Louise a qt.    I'm too good to be here   or  Butthurt woman detected.   Not sure yet.            They're cute.   cunny  Kill yourself.        They sure are.     Maybe if you're a homosexual, faggot.    Ayumu had that one side plot with Hayate getting confessed to by a random minor character.   I'm gay tbh.   Literal perfection.   Because they represent that one girl they could never back when they used to be into 3D.   No one cares.    You do.   Here's the deal with liking so called "boring" girls and why people hate on them.  These girls are literally perfect. They don't have that stupid glaring character flaw that all other characters have nor are they perfect in every way like a Mary Sue. They are simply perfect for everything they do. They are what you expect the ideal girl to be like.  Pedophiles and women hate this. Pedophiles hate this because there's no such thing as a "boring" loli. They all fall into shitty character tropes and it offends them when they see a "boring" of age character. Women on the other hand are threatened because they know they'll never be as perfect as these 2D girls.      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127185030  Still replied.       Megumi    normal   A girl that ditches her family vacation on the other side of the country and gets back home to help the loser of a MC with a heroine act, dragging the other two haremettes with her can hardly be called normal.       No, she's exactly what a woman should be. She is perfect, bro.     She's just a girl in love.      Megumi is awful. Almost as bad as Onodera.     I'm just saying that she's far from being a normal girl. She has her own quirks and does things that a truly average and normal girl wouldn't do.    fuck off you goddamn stupid retard     Eririfag get out.     Explain further.   The "pure Japanese waifu" is a popular archetype. That's literally all she is. The girls in Nisekoi are pretty flat in general, and Onodera is just the best waifu material out of the cast. Her sister is pretty cute though.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127185189  dont call me that    Megumi is a literal goddess. Kill yourself.      literally perfect   Onodera in the post:   borderline retarded   although the MC loves me and I (should) know that, I better cuck myself   I have no talents whatsoever   I have no personality whatsoever   doushio, Ruri-chan, please people let my cling to you since I can't do anything on my own               A personality is something that can be formed over time. Besides that, wouldn't you rather have a woman who is easy to read and please?     Yamato nadeshiko    Nisekoi is just a collection of lazy attempts to blindly follow archetypes, it shouldn't represent any of them in any significant way    I should have known that term. I never bothered to look it up.    There are people right now who likes dull deredere  Literally why. Might as well waifu a rock.    boring characters   in nisekoi  Wow who would've fucking guessed. Trash series trash characters.     It's not really that obvious he likes her due to the fact that he's still (fake) dating another girl. The simple fact is that he should notice that she likes him not the other way around.  Her talent is the ability to make sweets look good, not taste good. She also has a soothing voice and feeling.  She has a personality. She's kind of shy and she tries really hard, but she's also very easy to please. Giving her phone number to a guy is good enough for her and she's not rushing to get fucked in the backseat of a Buick like all the girls you like.   It's an amazing thing.           Kosaki isn't a vindictive bitch. She's better than Megumi.    Its cute. That's all it is but I love excessively dere characters. It would get boring after awhile though. Genki is best archetype.      I think Megumi being a little vindictive isn't so bad.    She bounces off the other characters in the cast and ends up having the most presence in the group, ironically going against the initial 'lack of presence' gags about her. She's just subtle. The other girls being extremely archetypical and cartoonish help in create a stark contrast as well.   There's nothing wrong with deredere girls. Onodera is a bad example though.   Eririfags are really bad at baiting.     cute   friendly demeanor   not a slut   shy but tries her hardest and things happen  I don't think you know what dull means.  You're the type to say Vanilla is plain when it's the best and most flavourful ice cream.            Only Eririfags can hate boring and dull dereshit  Megumifags are seriously bad.       Only an Eririfag could hate Megumi.     Only Eririfags hare enough shit taste to hate her, yes. The sun is hot too.     Megumifags think she loves Aki   Reminder that her feelings for him aren't romantic. Enjoy your friendship end.       there's literally nothing wrong with being an Eririfag   has a hobby   passionate   talented   kind   loyal   dedicated   warm-hearted  once again:  has a hobby   has something other than her love life to the character                 That's what Eririfags tell themselves to believe she has a chance in the bowl.     They're practically a married couple by Volume 8.      Proving my point. Awesome.      Don't forget   a traitor       lmao   Top fucking kek. It's sad to see your ahop sink, huh, Eririfag?     thinks Megumi is "boring and dull dereshit"   Right back at you.     Plain girls are the most loyal and make the best wives   Our point has been proven over the course of Saekano threads since it started airing. You're defending the indefensible.     Lelouch   good taste   Aside from Utaha, pick one and only one.      Today's final episode covers chapter 106 and 100.  Boy  Harem communities sure do attract a lot of obnoxious, autistic people     Fuck off Eririfag, you've been BTFO already.      Megumifags can't into opinions   Megumifags are the worst.        has a hobby  If you haven't noticed, the whole series is about a hobby that brings everyone together.  passionate  Every character in the series is passionate, except for maybe Michiru.  talented  Also emotionally retarded.  kind  Haha oh wow.  loyal  You're kidding right? She betrays the MC twice, and she admits doing so.  dedicated  See passionate.  warm-hearted  Only when the MC pays attention to her. Even then, she would revert back to her bitchy self at the drop of a hat.  has something other than her love life to the character  She's still behind the other two girls. Well, maybe she has surpassed Utaha by now.                   I don't even know what show you're talking about  I just saw all the retarded shit in this thread and wanted to comment on it      Yoshida   Himeji   Ichika   Arashiko   Kosaki   Megumi   Akane   All worst or shitty girls  There's no such thing as a good deredere.           Fuck off I said.    How cute, hiding behind "opinions" to save face.     Megumifags are this mad and paranoid      And yours is a shit opinion. Anyone who's read or watched Saekano knows that Megumi is anything but "boring dereshit."     You're stating the obvious.    Just take a moment to look at yourself and see how upset you're getting on the internet over something so inconsequential    Megumi isn't deredere and she's good, faggot.   OP BTFO.           These aren't Megumifags. These are reverse trolls trying to make Megumifags look bad.            Angry Eririfag detected.    Are you feeling persecuted?      about a hobby that brings everyone together   yet Megumi does jack shit.    she's the model   gtfo       secretly likes and helps MC, even when he's a complete disgrace   traitor   if she were a traitor she'd have found herself a real bf                    Does that mean we will get a season finale feeling episode or just more of the same? I'm not masochistic enough to read the manga    OP is right though. Also, your taste is shit and you're a tripfag. Your posts itt are invalid.     Megumi does jack shit.    You haven't even seen the fucking show. Stop being a retard.      But OP isn't wrong.     See?     Kek. All this denial.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127186311  Damn it, why didn't I drop this   How did a Nisekoi thread turn into a Saekano thread?   You give yourself away too easy, Eririfag.    Curious. Why haven't you killed yourself yet?   Normal girls are lovely  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127186410  You're the autist fucking Eririfag.    Eririfags seeking for attention as usual.    Because I enjoy being superior to fags who insult my perfect taste.     Nah, they are Megumifags. The same shitposters who starts shit all the time in Saekano threads. They love blaming victim and shifting the blame to Eririfags. Megumifags are the worst isn't a saying for nothing.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127186462  Nice try.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127186410  You used Onodera as an example, you'd think it be more of a Nisekoi waifu war than a Saekano waifu war. Also, calm down, you flaming autist.      up to the manga chapter 175 nothing will happen  except for the usual  something almost happens         You've got it backwards, Eririfags usually start shit. There's a reason everyone hates them.     That bullshit is so funny. Sakeano threads for the last couple of weeks have been peaceful and civil, and coincidentally Eririfags weren't active. They turn to shit when Eririfags start shitposting.     Randomly raging and attacking anyone  Reverse troll. Don't fall for this, /a/     Saekano and Nisekoi thread   If ever there were a time to remove a collection of posters from /a/, now would be it      It's a lot easier to defend Megumi than Onodera. She's easily one of the best done "normal" girls in anime.     Liking Chitoge unironically  I don't understand her deal. Violent tsundere hitting MC for nothing. Nothing new.  "It's fine because she is a girl"   "it's fine because it's not real"  The thing is she is still tsuntsun and not dere. Only good part of tsundere is the gap moe when they turn totaly dere.  Tsugumi  Violent cuck.  imouto  Better tsundere than Chitoge.  Marika  Best girl. She would never do something that would upset MC. Truly a best waifu.  Onodera  Second best girl. But she needs to step up and be independet already.              Completely 100% on OPs side. I cannot think of a single bland character that I ever liked.  Worst is Hinata. She's literally shit, has nothing but big boobs. No personality. Her eyes are disgusting.  I hate you all you shit taste faggots.       But it's true, Eririfags are the ones trying to ruin this thread.    butthurt sakurafag detected    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127186410  Seriously, are people retarded? People have only been discussing characters that are related to the topic. There is no Nisekoi or Saenai thread or anything. It's simply deredere thread.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127186591  Then I'd have to go outside or watch anime    I hate Hinata too. Sakura is kinda bad, but she's tons better than her.    Her banter is really entertaining to watch. She is a good conversationalist.    Megumi a best.  Onodera a best.     Megumifags' butt are extra sensitive to asspain today. They think a handful of posts discussing Megumi suddenly makes it a Saekano thread. More retarded is how they think talking about her is ruining the thread.   I think I've entered a thread of irrationally angry people.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127184124  Avatar fagging is when you use a single character for all of your reaction images, including it in every post.  Newfags need to learn this.       discussing  Yeah, insulting and bashing her for no reason is "discussing".    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127186736  I told him in the other thread I'd BTFO because he's a pedophile with terrible taste.   Tsugumi &gt; Chitoge &gt; Yui &gt; Haru &gt; Marika &gt; Paula &gt; Kosaki &gt; Ruri Utaha &gt; Eriri &gt; Megumi &gt; Michiru     a tsundere faggot placing megumi and kosaki among the last   Color me surprised.      I'm sorry, Anon-chan.  That taste just proves it's terminal.      At this point I think it's just people being contrarians for the sake of getting replies. Megumi is one of the most well-received heroines I've ever seen, and that's a damn accomplishment in a harem series. The arguments made against her are easy to debunk. She's a good character that earns her respect and popularity from the scratch (unlike the already popular twintail childhood friend tsundere and kuudere girls that gain fans loyal to the archetype from the get-go) and is difficult to genuinely dislike. You can see how the author puts the most effort writing her.    turn on recursive hiding to filter kevin   half the thread disappears     Kosaki &gt; Chitoge &gt; Haru &gt; Yui &gt; Ruri &gt; Marika &gt; Paula &gt;Tsgumi  Eriri &gt; Utaha &gt; Megumi &gt; Michiru      Chitoge &gt; Marika &gt; Haru = Ruri = Paula &gt; Tsugumi &gt; Kosaki  Megumi &gt; Utaha &gt; Eriri &gt; Izumi &gt; Michiru      Replace Tsgumi with Chitoge and then Paula with Yui.   We only need the Inou Battle fanbase here.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127187407   Yahari   They're well contained in their threads at least.      I hate how dumb downed the mc is. Atleast in danmachi which is also kinda harem shit, the mc wants a harem and the girls.     Inou Battle  Another dere girl who is best.     I do not like Tsgumi though    Jesus. She was pretty damn perfect. Best hair and eyebrows. If she only wore glasses.   Bland girls are the best.   Back to /pol/ or /v/, negro.    She doesn't look like she wins.   But she has those tits, man.         Speaking about Zero no Tsukaima, who /Henrietta-ohime/ here?      Tits are not everything  You must learn to not be ruled by tits      ma nigga    Holy shit, man. That almost NTR scene. Fuck. I still love it.   Of course I'm not rules by tits. There's more to her that I like. For example, her ED was tits.       NTR Princess was the best.   In the manga, does Haru ever figure out that Raku is her prince?   She was perfection.    Yes. She finds out the same time she finds out he's in a fake relationship.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127187862  Heh.      Fuckoff  Onodera and Tadakoro is best girl of this season.why you cannot understand it?   when is kevin killing himself? i've been waiting for so long now do it just like the rest, you're already following their footsteps anyway    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127187957  I'd rather have neither they're both long overdue for a bullet in the brain     Yeah.    Megu-chan makes magical things to my dick! Help, my hips are moving on the ir own!   Back to /v/.    talent   actually mattering when considering someone as a person   Back to /pol/, racist piece of shit.   Ok, you do place an interesting view here, like almost none of these other ret/a/rds. Please elabora un poco más weh. I mean to elaborate a bit more if you would.                 Follow the rest  wut   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127187957  Edgy as fuck.         Ayano isn't bland, she is a hero of justice.   You guys are never happy with anything.   should we tell him?    I hate your post number.     aizwallensteinpastahere     So who exactly is your waifu Kevin-kun?    She didn't do anything though.    My nigger. Megumi a best.     Opened Megumi appreciation thread before   Implying Megumi is boring  Really?      She's not all that plain though. She's a closeted slut. If she wasn't in love with Raku, she'd be the town bicycle.    It's hard to explain, but I do not mean boring in the sense that she's unlikable. More in the sense that she doesn't have any over the top flare and that's what makes her so good. She isn't exaggerated.    I'm kidding, of course. Don't ask stupid questions.         I've been around here for over 4 years  Congratulations! You've become one of the most well documented losers of the board! What's the next step, Kevin? McDonalds?      I get it, tsundere was a mistake  I beg your pardon?      Implying I'm a loser NEET like you.      They are. They are almost always the worst girl.      Marika   best girl   All this patrician taste here.       I know this is bait but the only shit tsunderes that come to my mind are Eriri, Kirino, and Louise.    You post on /r9k/, I don't think you're in a position to talk down to anyone    She saved her siblings from being consumed by their power. And her self-sacrifice indirectly did end up saving everyone in the anime timeline, even if it did cause more suffering to every single person in the meanwhile and ended up helping the villain.

I want to know what a psychologist would think about you  You may be interested to know that he's a law enforcement officer IRL. That's right, your traffic cop might be the most cancerous tripfag on /a/.     Considering I image dump a lot and I've posted more than 33 today alone then no, I don't think I do.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127188671  Yeah, I changed Kevin to Mobile. Though I'm not sure why you haven't been banned.      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127188708   Troid's Madoka circlejerk shitholes  Those are approved by Troid? Holy shit, no wonder the blogging and imagespamming tripfags never get banned.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127188708  And I lost it. Aren't you permabanned from /a/?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127188797  wut       liking violent tsundere  sasuga /a/ doesn't disappoint me ever  well i knew everyone here had shit taste though       Still missing Akiha      When will you faggots learn that Kurisu isn't a tsundere    Because they don't need character development, they can just remain dere and boring for the whole series.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127188883   Implying I destroyed a shitposting hugbox thread with my dissenting opinion.   Well frankly because you're an underage piece of cancer.       Dull(specifically deredere) person hate thread exactly  I thought of it as Nisekoi thread until some hardcore Saekanofag come out shitting each other's waifu     Longhairdera is cute! Cute!!!!    like Sayaka   go to Madoka thread to talk about her   Kevin is spamming her as usual   fuck    like Onodera   enter Nisekoi thread   Kevin being a shit again and spamming her   FUCK             I mean to elaborate a bit more if you would.  Well, there isn't much else to say. Just think about it, if she truly was an average and normal girl, she would have been overshadowed by the two queens of the school, Utaha and Eriri. But no, she does unexpected things, is pretty much in control of the situation and is the central figure everyone gravitates towards.     Maybe you (are) kevin-kun   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127189008  He used Onodera as a pictorial example. I responded with Onodera and how she was a great character and I even expand on my feelings in other parts of the thread. So yep.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127189076  That's because he posted it in a fucking Fate thread AND he used that pedophile word.      Most anime girls have fucking obnoxious quirks.  The "normal blob" is the closest thing to a reasonable person in their respective shows.     They always got their own thread, sometime even more than 2 That's too much space for waifu war though    Tsundere is fine but  I will hit you for no reason cuz i am a gurl  types are the worst  What type is Marika?  best girl type :^)        Marika is the manipulative cunt type.  Best girl.      Marika actually is the  death flag -type.    The thing about some shows with "violent" tsundere (and honestly a slap or two to a dense MC never hurt him) is that they end before reaching the crucial development in the source material where the girl transitions from tsun to dere. So when people scream about a tsundere being shit they are being animeonlyfags and filthy secondaries. They're probably Americans too, because  reading is for faggots!    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127189412  Anon fucking hell you murdered him.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127189412    Anon. Best tsundere is the one who switches back and forth and not violent one. Even her tsun is cute and it's not annoying. And her dere won't be boring too soon.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127189412  rekt                literally reddit the girl                We all know but will we care? We are not even the dense virgin faggot Raku      Eririfag coming back for more after getting BTFO earlier    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127189412  Ice burns.     Put Rin and Shana in the good side, move down Chidori and your chart will be fucking perfect.     Wrong girl. Utaha is reddit.   Megumi is MAL.     Kevin, you literally ruin threads by posting. Why won't you take off the trip?   Nope. Megumi is /a/.     Megumi is /a/.      Everyone who hates Megumi is the same Eririfag. I just know it!  Megumifag again showing how delusional and bad he can be. The only one who got BTFO was you by being retarded.     There he is again!   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190140  The thread's dead already. I could post whatever I wanted and it couldn't get any worse.     She is. Look at the Saekano threads lately, they are almost completely comprised of Megumifags.     She's the most popular Saekano girl here by a huge margin.     There he is again!  Literally irony. The other anon isn't even me. Stay butthurt and retarded, Megumifag.     You sure do love to respond whenever someone says something against Eririfags. You're too easy to spot out.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190212  My bump is also irrelevant, given the post rate on this thread.     Reddit lurks /a/ all the time. You guys should go back to Reddit.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190263    samefagging   too easy to spot out.  Keep being ironic.      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190323   Michiru   the girl whose popularity dropped faster than Kotoura-san   You're even more delusional than the average Eririfag.        Utaha is reddit. I still remember those stupid weekly Utaha posts that were copypasted from there.    Megumi a shit. Worse than Kosaki.   This.   This show needs better porn.   Keep being retarded.    this whole thread    Megumi is shit, but she isn't that shitty. Megumi has worst fans compared to Kosaki though.      look at me guise, I can post with my phone!     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190422  <br/>    Eriri has the shittiest fans of all though. As expected of the worst girl.     Eririfag PLEASE.     Worst fans for worst girl. Makes perfect sense.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190501   Michirufags barely even exist. Her throwing out Tomoya's stuff hurt her popularity a lot.     Don't insult the people who browse 4chan on their phone. One of them might be moot.    If Megumi is anything like her fans ITT, then I'm sure she has to be THAT bad.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190501  Holy shit, your delusion is extreme. Eriri and Utaha were the main reasons people took a look at the show. Michiru was mildly popular during week 0. Things changed a lot and Michiru is the least popular girl of the bunch while Megumifags are practically all over /a/.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190408       Nice try. You won't change the fact Eririfags are the worst fans. Saekano threads lately are proof.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190686   ripping limited edition posters   Still a shit.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190686   pretend Michiru isn't one of the most popular and best girls.   No one is pretending. Michiru barely has fans. You have to be fucking delusional to believe she has more fans than Megumi, Eriri or Utaha.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190676  Oh, I'm just not liking that poster anymore.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190686  I wouldn't know. I'm far from the cancerous blight on this board. I'm thinking that title falls squarely on your shoulders.       You won't fool anyone, Megumifag. No other side uses cancerous buzzwords and shitpost ad nauseam like you guys do. And always provoking and starting shit with other fans who don't praise your super popular girl as best.    Objectively correct   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190721  Get off, /a/ you fucking piece of shit.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190819  So edgy. I can see you rage from behind the screen. Isn't it bed time for you, child?    How funny. You described Eririfags. Are you a comedian or something?    Her actions didn't save them, inevitability saved them.  Hebi-kun literally could not win, he could only loop until he eventually lost. Combining eyes is the power of God, and it decreed that all the snakes would unite in the real world.      Denial won't change history.    Quiet, shy, submissive girls who blush a lot are cute and desirable. They make the best waifus.    Megumifags get along with Utahafags very well. It's not a wonder because most have the two girls as first or second favorites. Threads consisting of those fanbases posting are nice and have good discussions. On the other hand, finding an Eririfag who isn't super defensive and provocative is rare. Finding a shitstorm not started by an Eririfag is rare. Eririfags are blemishes on what would be a better fanbase without them.      Please show. For science.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127191008  Delusional as fuck. Michiru fans don't make even more than 5% of the total general Saenai fanase on /a/. Eriri often has more fans than Utaha who's already pretty small.    Right back at you.    Eririfags get along with Utahafags very well. It's not a wonder because most have the two girls as first or second favorites. Threads consisting of those fanbases posting are nice and have good discussions. On the other hand, finding an Megumifag who isn't super defensive and provocative is rare. Finding a shitstorm not started by an Megumifag is rare. Megumifags are blemishes on what would be a better fanbase without them.    Wasn't this posted in that FSN thread about Rin's H scenes?    Parroting doesn't work when you're straight out spouting bullshit.    tsun entire series   1 episode of dere   she wins the MCb owl   meanwhile normal girl enjoys being cucked   only one who truly suffers is best girl who was showering MC with love from the first episode  The reason worst girls always win is this. Gap moe. Tsun-dere is too strong for retards like nips. Normal girls are just there for getting cucked. They most likely knew MC more than anyone. Like childhood friends. Best girls never win because they are too alpha for nips. Also if MC loved back the best girl shit would end.  THAT'S WHY HAREM IS SHIT           Saekano threads with Eririfags   nothing but shitposts   Saekano threads without Eririfags   chill thread   Guess which threads we've been having lately.          Just go to the archive and search for "weekly Utaha."      This      bullshit  Apply yourself.      Literally everyone hates Eririfags. I can't remember the last time an Utahafag supported an Eririfag but Utahafags generally don't mind Megumifags.     I can post threads to support my claim if you want. I know you won't because you know you're wrong anyway.    That's because Eririfags are exactly like the character they emulate. The same thing with Utahafags.   Thank you janitor-kun.  Go get a hot pocket mod, you've done well.    Nice phone.  Sprouting bullshit still won't change facts. There has always been fans who likes Eriri most and have Utaha as second. Same goes for Megumi first and Utaha second. But of late because of Eriri x Utaha, more Utahafags are okay with Eriri rather than Megumi.   The cause of any shitstorm that ruins threads are caused mainly by Megumifags who starts shit with Eririfags. Remove Megumifags and threads will be nice.          implying samefag   Why are you so delusional? Way to lose your credibility.       The cause of any shitstorm that ruins threads are caused mainly by Megumifags who starts shit with Eririfags. Remove Megumifags and threads will be nice.   Explain why Saekano threads lately have been so good. I'll tell you why, it's because Volume 8 nuked every other fan out of existence.       Start Megumi thread.   Eririfags come in and try and ruin it.   Buuuuuuuuuut guyyyyyyyyyys! It's the Megumifags that are doing it!        It's okay whenever I imply samefag, but it's not okay when people do it to me.    Being better than Yahari doesn't make it good.        What do you have against phones?  Also, the reason why any thread turns into a shitstorm of baiting, trolling, and pissing contests is because anons hate different.        The cause of any shitstorm that ruins threads are caused mainly by Megumifags who starts shit with Eririfags. Remove Megumifags and threads will be nice  True for the most part. Fucking THK is shitposting Eriri as a Megumifag, for fuck's sake.     It's funny because you can tell the time the Eriri shitposters come into a thread. First they try to be subtle posting an "eriri best" post, and then wait some minutes to start shitposting. Saekano threads can last a whole day free of trolling and by extension free of Eririfags.    Samefag device.   Responsible, mature, but shy girls are the best.    It's funny because you can tell the time the Megumi shitposters come into a thread. First they try to be subtle posting an "Megumi a best" post, and then wait some minutes to start shitposting on Eriri or start obnoxious circlejerking for Megumi to the point of bait. Saekano threads can last a whole day free of trolling and by extension free of Megumifags.      anyone who hates Eriri is THK   Exactly why everyone hates Eririfags.      Megumifags are an inherent part of Saekano threads. Eriri is far less popular and her fans are less involved with the threads. Just look at the thread when volume 8 came out. Not a single Eririfag was there.    Normal girls are a breath of fresh air after all those deres (and the occasional genki)     Implying I said or implied anyone  THK apologist pls go.    They are both equally hot. One of them might be silk hiding steel while the other one's going to be into collars and some freaky shit  Subs where  I want to kill this fucking cunt.    Subs never ever.   Iroha is better.<br/>        Reminder that Kaioh is a loser who has nothing better to do than fuck with high school students  It's over. Where should I shitpost now?  Does yukino even have 8man's number yet?    Please, Yuimom by a mile.  Yuimom is so best that she beats Yukino by herself.       No, she's to autistic to ask.    It doesn't take much to be better than Yukino.     No one.  Hayama witnesses what Hachiman and the service club accomplish together and the esteem Haruno shows them and feels envious. He decides he hasn't been living his life the way he truly wants to and breaks from Haruno and his family to go his own way, committing himself to be sincere for once.  Either that or he just fades into the background like he always does when the story stops being about him and we never really know.        Yahari Girl Power Rankings:  1. Sensei 2. Orimoto 3.

What if this anime ends wih a cliffhanger and an entire new season is announced for the next year?    I don't think there will be a hot war either, I think there might be a cold war and tension but it will be on the back burner to the plot. We still have to deal with Yukinon's fucked head and 8man's allergy to pussy.    What season within a year Watari would only be able to pump out 2 volumes at best.     What would they animate? Probably vol 12 will be out by then. I guess it's possible a theoretical vol 13 would be out by the time the anime ends.  But two volumes isn't much to go on considering how many volumes previous seasons have covered.       Now that's alpha.   Okay people still arent sure  Is Yui a part of Sensei Contest or no?  I dont think she is       Get watari to work 140 hours per week.   translation when?   Obviously not. it is only a forced conflict    Who's that?     Yukino would take rejection from 8man the best too.  This, Yukino would barely feel a rejection from 8man. She was ready to happily agree to no romance. Yui would be very hurt though.       I'm sure if Yui asked to join it she could. Doesn't she ask at some point during the student council event? I might be imagining that.  Regardless I don't see her winning it whether she gets to technically be a part of it or not. It's a Yukino/Hachiman race.       Is this even good     Yui would be very hurt   Literally sinking her own ship      the main girl in Watari's new LN.    Sensei wouldn't have graded her if she wasn't.    Yukino &gt; Yui therefore Yukino's mom &gt; Yui's mom    Nice cum coaxer here, also nice quads      Looks nothing like Yukinoshita.    0. Hachiman    Rewatch the scene, it was really painful for her to try and sink it. 8man saved it though.    No Sensei just mentioned her in passing when Yukino asked sensei who was winning (between her and Hachiman)  Still, its going to be between Yuki and Hachi as you mentioned   Pretty sure this Vol 11 Yuki would take rejection incredibly hard   Yui would get hurt, cry, but probably move on if she did get rejected. I think Yukino would be devastated honestly          Being Yukino is suffering, watching this episode make me realize Yui suffering is nothing    Damn, she grew up fast.     Doesn't change the fact that she's planning on sinking herself    Missing the hair ribbons and has bigger tits     Yukino would take rejection from 8man the best too.  Did you watch last episode? She was willing to take Yui's choice out of fear. Considering how much of a mess she is right now, a rejection would make her even worse.  Yui would definitely be hurt too, but unlike Yukino, she's well-adjusted. She's likely to overcome a rejection given enough time.        She literally says she knew that 8man wouldn't let her and felt satisfied by it.    I think Yukino would be devastated honestly  Why do you think that?        Rumi confirm    She's been suffering more than Yui has since Vol 6 or so. Yui's only suffering (so far) is that she isnt with Hikki and seeing her friends suffer  Yuki's suffering is what Yui goes through but with family and emotional issues  Was she really sad as fuck in the LN when she couldnt even muster the courage to give Hachiman her homemade goods?         happily agree  Were you even watching? She'll feel like shit but say and do nothing unless someone puts up a teleprompter.     Yui would be hurt but could easily move on, as she is actually emotionally healthy. Yukino is so emotionally fragile that the only thing she could possibly continue living with would be total ambiguity as it is now. Actual rejection would destroy her, since what relationships we see now are all she has.    That's the flattest ass I've seen. I think I even became a bit depressed after seeing it.  Whoever drew that should have been told to go back, and redraw that ass until it was nice and round as God commands it.       No, because the subs aren't out yet.     Speaking only one language    Kek anon       not liking flat everything  what are you, gay?     Unlike Yui's, Yukino's suffering is entirely on her.    No, I'm not your dad.    You actually waste time you could spend watching anime on learning Japanese? I'd make fun of you but you've already done that better than I ever could.     has bigger tits  that single detail makes all the difference     Not really, in Yukino's case is on her family. Though she could just stand up to them, given how she grew up that isn't as easy.  On the other hand, all Yui has to do is fucking confess.        Soulless bitch over 11/10 comfy MILF  I mean I can respect preferring Yukino over Yui but you're just trying to start shit, aren't you?     She's incredibly emotionally fragile right now; well she's always been since before the series began but she just hid herself behind the ice wall.   Hachiman I think is something of a special existence for her; I mean he's the only guy we've seen that can support her (likewise with Yui for girls), can understand her to some degree. Hayama failed her. Hachiman has yet to do so and often the one who aids her the most (he basically broke through the ice wall that she had when he went all genuine). She only goes full dere around Hachiman (before she would have minded but she doesnt anymore)  Anyways, its obvious she likes him and getting rejected by him would crush her. Yui can deal with emotions easily (its the point of her entire character),         Yukino would be devastated  She's a walking steaming pile of psychological mess. Dependency issues, family issues, and recently has conflicted relationship with the only 2 person she can trust. I'm not surprised if she can't learn to love after rejected.     Do we know anything about either mothers other than their combined 12 lines?    Her dependency issues and getting bullied in school can't be blamed on Yukinomom or Haruno.     I think it's going to be 'order' but more like something sweet that will make us go awww. What the order is exactly will depend on the situation at the end. If they are friends, it could be for contact info (since we're 11 volumes in and they still haven't exchanged it, it makes you think that's being withheld for a special moment). Or just acknowledge as friends (if Hachiman wins) because he's been refused twice now. If they're lovers or otherwise on a romance path it could be something sweet along those lines.    What was the talk in the end in the episode about?  Sounded like Yuigahama was forcing Yukinos hand on something and 8man interrupted before a mistake was made.  I didn't understand most of the dialogue but my heart was still tight during the whole episode.       DESTROOOOOOOOOOOOOOYED   Well Yukinoshita never tells lies (as Hachiman knows) and she told him that they can never be friends  Doesnt mean that they cant be boy/girlfriends i the end though. I mean its pretty sweet and incredibly cheesy but I think Watari would do something like that     68 / 9 / 33  We need more Image, pls anons.  i-irohasu <br/>      dependency issues  Those stem from being sheltered or not being taught independence as a child, which is a duty of the parents. Her getting bullied at school was likely a result of the inability of her parents to teach her how to mesh with the crowd or defend herself. You can't blame children for not knowing how to do things their parents neglect to teach them. Children only independently learn through simple negative and positive stimuli, and so such complex concepts must be actively taught.    where the fuck r the subs    The vol 11 spoilers posted are that Yui proposes that the service club all stay like they are now forever, essentially removing romance from the picture. Basically pretend like they don't feel anything for Hachiman. Yukino, since she was dependency mode was starting to accept Yui, but Hachiman interrupted and gave another 'genuine' speech along with saying Yukino had to solve her own problems and Yui had to be genuine. He rejected that sort of superficiality with people "important" to him.      Honestly though, I still think that an eventual loss is better for Yukino, partly because as you guys point out, she's so fragile emotionally right now.  Once 8man and Yui help her get on her own path, it'll be a hallmark that she can take the bad with the good, while Yui's victory will be a form of positive reinforcement for her going out on a limb and chasing what she wants.       don't know, but apparently it spends most of the LN being a romcom and then at the end aliens or something invade   If you listen to the entire OP (Harumodoki), there's a part at the end with the lyrics "yuki no shita."  raw where?   How is this?    She was overseas when the bullying occured right? Elementary school or something and Hayama never really helped her out right?   We still need more of Yuki's past I think; we've gotten hints over the novels but its just bits and pieces      Irohasu to you, brother.    confirming her being a SHITA ah i see what ur getting at     Does that mean Americans are the ones who bullied Yukino?     Are you that same guy who keeps spouting positive reinforcement as if Oregairu is some sort of skinner box experiment?  Isnt Yukinoshita also starting to chase after him too though?     Good Irohasu, anons.  What's the state of things? Memesubs when?      Once 8man and Yui help her get on her own path, it'll be a hallmark that she can take the bad with the good, while Yui's victory will be a form of positive reinforcement for her going out on a limb and chasing what she wants.  The thing is though, that the average person isn't this strong, much less the gesticulating puddle of emotional quicksilver that is Yukino. People who aren't strong by adolescence are unlikely to become so as they grow up, and are more likely to become emotionally dependent adults. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with that, but such people require more emotional support to remain as emotionally healthy. Yukino would probably never recover from losing the 8bowl.    Good Irohasu, everyone!   Her backstory is this as far as I can tell   be super good at school, but not get exposed to the same kind of public-facing stuff as Haruno so never learn to deal with them   other kids are envious, she asks her sister/parents how to deal with it, her parents tell her she's just superior to them and to ignore them, her sister eggs her on   she becomes ronery and isolated   gets into a love triangle with herself, haruno, and hayato at some point   haruno wins, but when hayato tries to do something she tells them she was just fucking with them   this creates the awkwardness hayato has around haruno and yukino   this also makes yukino put up the icewall so she's never hurt like that again   its the only real logical explanation of why she has such this vicious hate for her sister and why the rumor of yukino-hayato was distasteful to them              It looks like a Yukinoshita that is not shit.    I see, thanks anon. Subs can't come soon enough.  I wish there was some anime I could binge watch for me to be able to understand shit well enough, I really need to get on with it since I learned english by listening to music and watching subbed TV series.       She is a shita, but she'll win the 8manbowl.    Where my Yuibros at?   ;_;       Needing more is an understatement. Her problems are so incredibly vague that people have the creative freedom to twist and bend them to whatever fits their shitposting needs.  I just want clarification which I hope we were getting in this volume but nope, Watari is pushing answers back another 6 months.  Pic related, it's Watari and his editors.         Good Irohasu   Do any of you have any idea how stupid you sound?    So glad Iroha was nowhere to be seen    People actually think she has a chance  Are you guys fucking retarded?     S3 never?   Fuck you and your pic.   My neighbour just told be to shut the fuck up as I was laughing really hard at it.      One thing I noticed is that all the major characters in the story have experienced romantic rejection except for Yui (that we know of). And all of them responded to that rejection differently.  1. Hachiman has plenty of times. He has not handled it well obviously. But he has been learning a new perspective on it throughout the story for instance by gradually overcoming his hostility to 'nice girls'. And he's made peace with Orimoto.  2. Yukino did in the past with Hayato. She responded by, well, you can see. It was not mature reaction. But we see in vol 10 that she was starting to forgive Hayato for it. Albeit she was developing another problem at the same time.   3. Iroha did with Hayato as well. She instantly seems to have transferred her affections to Hachiman. Hayato remarked that her affections were "probably not for me" which suggests that Iroha has handled it by considering her true feelings. Not a bad response but it remains to be seen. At any rate, she doesn't have a hostile attitude towards Hayato for sure.  I really feel like being able to handle rejection in a mature way is one of the things the story is about. So it may be coming for Yui.           I don't know about that. I was just reiterating that Yukino's problems are not on her, as the anon I replied to asserted. I can't really answer your question. Have a new smug face instead.    We've earn enough points. Her saliva is love potion, it'll work in Vol12     not being taught independence as a child  You learn to be independent on your own. That's the fucking point. You also do not have to be "taught" how to make friends unless you're literally autistic, in which case it would be the responsibility of the parents to teach you basic social skills.     yfw we get a movie instead of an OVA   So is it going to be Toradora all over again with Yui giving Yukino up to the 8inches?    That strikes my sides as a dangerous activity.     fuuuuuuuuuck.    Yeah, but the difference is that Minori was a cunt.    Irohasu~     Tfw Watari is gonna make a shit ending    I'm worried       Why would I want to see an hour and a half of shitting on Yui when I can just have 30 minutes?    Are subs out yet?   yes right now    If we don't get an ova for the date with iroha I'm going to eat my own shit.     Thanks for signing up for Pan-san Facts!

Yukimom is obviously the overbearing tiger mom type, and Yui's mom is the normal housewife type. Other than that no.    you liar!    Not him, but this is where it's from.    kek I'm pretty sure if he text her 'I love you' the spam stops      Yuimom is a domestic goddess.      Is there something you can eat to maybe flavor your shit a little better?  It wouldn't hurt you plan ahead a bit.       Irohasu~~~~~  We're every where anon.  Atleast our goddess has her move on 8man with spoon feeding and a half romantic answer! Where're your girls at? still finding your honmono or still trying to beg 8man fix your trouble? Saliva &gt;cookies = chocolate       Well I'd say she did have a part the problems (her reaction to what happened) but I'm not going to fault her for it  I mean both 8man and Yukino put up walls and was mostly independent up until the series began. The big difference is that while 8man had loner problems because of his stance on girls, he was still an emotionally secure dude; having Komachi around helped too  Yuki put up walls but inside shw was pretty frail and she didnt have any support structure until Hachiman and Yui came along        Subs any minute now.       You learn to be independent on your own.  You underestimate the influence of parents on a child's growth, particularly one who is not naturally gregarious. That aside, the whole point of the traditional family structure throughout history has been to have the children be taught how to function correctly in society by their parents. Humanity is not some global do-as-you-please anarchy where there are no social rules. If the individual child is not taught to function by their parents, they will likely learn from their friends who were. Yukino's situation arises when a child with irresponsible parents is not naturally adept at communication, is put into situations where companionship is not easily come by, or has some antisocial notion reinforced by external stimuli. All three of these apply to Yukino, making her situation particularly severe, much more than the average "loner kid" or "guy who doesn't have many friends."     8man denied her about 3 times now nice girl speech, StuCo, and now her proposal.   Nothing happened this episode.    fuxk  What?      That's not really the same as the others experienced though.    Yukimom is a manipulator.  Yukino is just a nice soft quiet lady who loves kitties and pan-san underneath an icy shield.     you will never have two female friends fight over you     lady   Shes how old 16? 17? Not a lady.       nice girl speech  Refusing/Confirming her sencerity  Proposal  She knew it was going to happen       My nigga.     chasing what she wants.  She doesn't need to get everything she wants. She has perfect life Yui victory is way too shallow you think, it is so easy route.    Let her take the bad with the good  So lets her create another ice wall again          i'm not sure what it tastes like but eaten oats for an entire day and your shit will smell exactly like oats, i'm dead serious    Eguchi's voice has changed a lot since S1 I've noticed. He has much wider range now   Thank god   I want to give Yukino a pet parrot and listen to her repeat the same lines over and over.  Eventually all this sexual tension will reach a breaking point.   meant to reply to<br/>     overbearing tiger   bear tiger   bearcat   Yukino is just a spoiled brat and can't admit she loves her mom the most        Extreme fucking.   It's 1 AM lads  Where are the subs     Nope,  in the vol.11 LN 8man's monologue heavily implied that he still want to fulfill his promised date with Yui.  In the final volume, Yui will give up and try to run away from the club. After 8man realized Yui's feeling is the most genuine thing, he will chase after Yui.  This time he won’t wait, but he’ll go instead.            nyaa~  nyaa~  nyaa~  nyaa~  nyaa~  nyaa~  nyaa~  nyaa~           A lady is a classy gal. While lady may more often refer to an older woman, it doesnt mean a teenager cannot be a lady.    its 3pm where r the subs     When I fuck Camilla.    If they meant that much to you and you knew that picking one would really hurt the other I think it would be an awful thing to be in. If they were best friends you could fundamentally alter their relationship for the worse and there would be no way around the emotional trauma.   I would hate it and probably crawl into a hole if it happened to me.     5 hours  GO TO BED       USE CREDIT BITCH  No seriously who the fuck uses cash nowadays       He's alpha as fuck. Super emo alpha.    Wanting to fuck your own sister, you are a sick man.    She'd be the perfect wife for an anon too. Dutiful and careful, with plenty of banter, and she has her own quiet hobbies that she can silently enjoy as anon watches his cartoons. Hell, with the advent of the electronic headphone she can do it sitting in his lap and be unbothered.    Well that date is basically going to be where he either gets with Yui or in the end gets with Yukinoshita after Hachiman gave them the green light to wage war for him this volume  I think everyone knew that a real 1 on 1 date where he has to deal with Yui's feelings in some fashion was going to happen      subs never    I'd say a few more hours. Go shitpost some more.   THE WORLD CALLS FOR MEME SUBS, AND COMMIE ANSWERS  NO CAMILLA HYPE POSTS  NO WAITING UNTIL TOMORROW       Nobody cares what you would do. Don't worry about 8man though. He's too weak to ever make a decision and will probably just silently go off to college never to see either of them again.    We are trying to build to the point where losing 8man to Yui would not hurt Yukino. I think we will get there since Yukino isn't actually in love with 8man.    That can;t be real    Anything is fine if we get to see the ending   I'm sure it'll happen though, Yahari is pretty popular.      8man ditched Yui while she was looking at the penguins to fingerfuck Yukino    Yukino is too weak-willed and complacent to be manipulative.     No seriously who the fuck uses cash nowadays  Cash and debit cards are used by responsible people who don't spend money that they don't have and would prefer not to pay extra fees for doing so.     SYDNEY REPRESENT!   God I hate all this suffering. When is this going to end?   Gotta fill it up with dank memes before releasing.    I pay off my credit bill every month, pay 0 in fees, and get 2% back on all purchases through credit.   Why was Yukino making this face?  Was she afraid of Yui and couldn't go against her force?  Was the idea of throwing her love for 8man away that awful to her but she couldn't put it in words? Was she afraid that 8man may end up rejecting her so she would rather have the status quo than to lose everything?       this is the last episode    WA here. Thanks for being the cancer that is destroying the once-proud nation of Australia.   what was your favorite part of this season?  mine was when we got to see saki cry from the haunted house  something just rings inside me when I see a good girl suffer       I like rewards programs that I get; also I get interest by storing money in my account and only paying the bills when I actually need to     Was in the livewatch. Can't wait for Spyro now. I want to know what happened when Yukino left the two in the penguin attraction.  Also  Camilla  What happened?       It's 7 AM.  SUBS WHERE      Hopefully it's the last ever    You also get to hear yourself twice every time you talk to her.    Iroha marriage episode?    two whole seasons   Yet I still have to ask how the fuck are Yui and Yukino friends exactly?  They have literally no chemistry and nothing in common.        I didn't say such people only use cash and debit. I simply answered the question of "who uses cash anymore?" Good on you, anons.    Will Hayama fuck his crush Y?   I was replying to   That would be too weak of 8man. After telling everyone to be genuine they are more likely to act on their feelings so it is either rejection or acceptance.       WA here  Whats it like being in the backwater of Australia in the middle of nowhere?  Granted you probably don't have shitskins invading the place.       No, he is a cuck.    Gentlemen, it was a privilege watching with you.  What's the next series to follow with /a/ and shitpost endlessly about?      Shut the fuck up skiddiks   Is Hachiman actually Pan-San? Is that symbolism actually true     Yahari season 3     After Spyro finishes Yahari, we go to Watari's new work.     I think Yahari threads = best place for shitposting. Or you can try waifu war in Lovelife threads.    I sorta understand the friendship, since I have a friend like that. I don't even understand how it works.

Don't be tricked so easily  Try and think of one character that hasn't raped Tohka  I can't      Natsumi is gayer than Miku. And Yoshino is okay with it.     Mana     Flatori best imouto  Nothing to disagree about. Shidou already agreed, don't bother him about it.      But this entire volume was everyone raping Shidou.     The only rapey thing involving Tohka is her raping shido's mouth     I want to fuck the shit out of Kotori and make her my wife.     Get in line.    Why does she wear panties under her pajama?    Who doesn't?     I don't     - Shidou coughed. He remembered the promise with Tohka. After he captured Yoshino, Tohka said "don't kiss with anyone else but me" to him. Shidou keep quiet about it since he can't make Spirits become emotionally unstable.  - Shidou tried making an excuse. But Tohka said sorry that she made a contradict condition to him. She asked Shidou to save Spirits, yet disallow the method to do that. - However, Tohka then continued that he should have told her back then. She thought Shidou have other ways of sealing Spirit Power for all along.  - Shidou said sorry to her and lowered his head. Tohka shook her head once again and tell him she forgive him, but with a condition. Shidou widen his eyes because Tohka, while knitting her brows at the pain, climbed down from her bed and climbed up into his bed.   "Er, Tohka?" "I don't have any complains. But since Shidou violated our promise, —"  - Tohka counted off her fingers while calling the Spirit's name. Yoshino, Kaguya, Yuzuru, Miku, Natsumi, Origami. Tohka blushed and say in small voice,  "…Seven. That's the number of times you kept secret from me. I'll forgive you this time with seven kisses." "Wha…? H-hey, wait, Tohka!?" "No questions. Or you don't want to kiss with me?" "No, that's not what I meant, others are —" "Then there's no problem! Sit still. I'll be done fast." "W-Wait!"  - Tohka covered up him and pushed her lips toward Shidou's lips. Shidou feel a pleasure like his brain is burning up.  "N…chu…" "…! …!!"  - That moment,                          "Sorry to keep you waiting, Shidou. I've brought everyo —"  - The door opened. Kotori froze in front of it. Tohka widen her eyes in surprise and separate her lips away from his. Shidou's lips got pulled with her lips a little before it bounced back.  - Their lips are connected to each other with glittering thread made of saliva. With that scene, Kotori and the Spirits, and Mana rushed into the room.  "W-wait, what were you doing in this short timespan, Shidou!?" "U-um… you both just recovered, I think you…" "Ka, kaka… Tohka sure takes the cake." "Pointing out. Kaguya seems frustrated." "Kyaa! Eh? I didn't saw it properly, so could you do it again! Again please!" "UAW… you just woke up and did that… how gross." "…As expected, I can't be off guard." "Nii-sama! What are you doing!?"  - Everyone said that and surrounded Shidou's bed.  "H-hey, everyone calm down. I…"  - Shidou tried smoothing it over. However, he couldn't came up with any excuse.   "Muu…"  - Tohka is also the same. Since it came to this, Tohka then hugged Shidou. The Spirits raise up their voices "Ahh!".   "Haha…"  - In the tumult that Shidou felt it has been a long time since he heard it, he patted Tohka head while smiling bitterly.   [End]                               I WANT TO FUCK KOTORI!    this blatant favoritism     Based Tohka!    SEVEN  KISS     SUMMARY ANON WE LOVE YOU THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.   Remember Kaguya a cutie    Tohka being sly, that was great.  Also, thanks summary anon. You're too good to us. Get some sleep.       At this point, if this ends up having a harem ending it will be just an excuse to please the fans.    Time to sleep summary anon. Respects and thanks to you. Good night.      Thank you a lot, Summary Anon.      Thanks man and God bless you, splendid job with all the summaries.    Tohka BESSST  also thank you so much based summary anon. Sleep well      Afterword?    Why you dont suck a dick faggot, he do the whole volume already.        FUCK THIS RETARD FAVORITISM SHIT      Who cares about the afterword? I could probably tell you what's there.     Their lips are connected to each other with glittering thread made of saliva  Lewd. Thanks so much based summary anon    ku ku ku thank you summary anon   Tohka wins a flawless victory. Don't worry Origami, you can still be second.    Greedy retard, seriously I doubt this series will have a harem end.    Well I can't really be mad since she's got the guts to take the initiative. Night! Thanks    It will.   as long as bwaka gets her kisses      Tohka a greedy girl. Shidou belongs to everyone.    Thanks a lot, you're the real hero    Unless we  kill the Tohka.     S2 BDs never, did FFF drop it or is anyone else doing them?    and people say there is no favoritism in this novel.    Postword  - This is the first book since Tachibana's debut with a male character on the cover (total of over 20 volumes!). - The spread illustration this time is 'that thing'. If you don't know what it is, then open volume 1 page 131 (chapter 2). What a long foreshadow. Was it even a foreshadow? - New series "Itsuka Sekai wo Sukuu Tame ni -Qualidea Code-" will be released on August 18th. Illustrated by Haimura Kiyotaka. In a world that has been evaded by an enemy of grotesque looks, boys and girls are fighting to protect their country… but those boys and girl don't really care about the world being in danger or whatsoever. They just pour their love into a certain girl. It's like Origami being split into several characters. What is that how scary.  - Dragon Age 2015/09 will have Date A Live Marugoto BOOK that complies all articles from Dragon Magazine with few Tsunako illustrations that never been recollected anywhere before. - PSV Date A Live Twin Edition Rio Reincarnation out August 30. - Date A Live SS1 BDBOX coming out on August 31 with additional scenes. - Date A Live Mayuri Judgement screen August 22.  - See you again in DAL13 or Itsuka Sekai wo Sukuu Tame ni -Qualidea Code-.  - Tachibana will still continue writing DAL so don't worry.    Bed time. It was fun guys.  mfw back from Japan on August 19th   mfw movie will be screened on 22nd                     What a greedy slut  she needs a spanking from Reine     Not since volume 2.   You are the best summary anon! Thanks!   And she's even more dangerous now that she knows she loves him.   Night! Thanks       Thanks for this. http://pastebin.com/Kcm2PsAm      good to know Tachibana hasn't given up     I am, and I'm up first.    Thanks anon.    Thank you summary anon!   Movie thread next?   Thks for all your hard work, great summary Good night     Yes she is.   So now that we this  What was everyone's general thoughts of the volume?    She deserves more kisses anyway. Its only fair since he lied to her!    No she was just being retarded    3.5/5  A bit goofy. But we learned a bit more. Even if just a little.. Still enough to speculate      I don't think it was a Volume 7, but not bad. Though Tachibana sure loves to take his time with the reveals.  DAL 25 last volume?     meh it was alright all the plot happened then it was date time fallowed by main girl favoritism then it sets up for the next volume    It's a set up novel. Asked more questions than it answered and did more foreshadowing than we've had in a while.  Oh and it put Tohka at the head of the competition for the Shidobowl in case anyone had forgotten.      It was alright. And at least everyone got kisses    Probably going to have to back and reread the Phantom parts. That was a lot of info that just seemed to be out there.    Average, too much fanservice and not enough plot. Disappointed Shidou didn't do much in berserk mode.     with few Tsunako illustrations that never been recollected anywhere before.  My dick is ready.     A bit of a delay on a new spirit... Which is disappointing. But after the end I can't really complain that much    Things look bleak for the harem end, darn you Tachibana   So what do we think the last few spirits powers are?   Better than volume 5 and 6 but worse than 7. I was expecting much more.    4/5 It was ok, have a little plot and Shidou berserk was fun    Yeah, but it doesn't look like anyone is catching up to Tohka anytime soon.   No.2 spirit Next time   Inverse Kurumi when?     I wouldn't say bleak.. Note Tohka somewhat acknowledged she loves the others too. And I think she may just want some special treatment if he's gonna do stuff with the others too    Nah, still going to be a harem end. The harem will be "Tohka and all the others" though.     Once again, thanks a lot Summary Anon.   Such a bad timing indeed, Just a couple days away from the movie!        She's probably fine as long as he gives her some extra lovin. Which is kinda cute actually.    Not bad but disappointing overall, the scene where all the girls kissed Shidou was underwhelming as fuck.    WHY DID THEY CUT HER HAIR?!?    Nepgear?   Vol.20  Reine True End     I don't know if it's just the summary downplaying it or not, but I feel the same way about the dates too.    Tohka literally holds an advantage because she gets jealous  Its the ultimate weapon in harems. Kotori is waaay to discreet with her jealousy, while Tohka will literally voice how she feels. Being okay with a harem end (like miku is) doesn't actually bode that well for an individuals chances    Who the fuck is Mio    Keep in mind, we only read the summary. Translator anon, what were your thoughts?    You'll have to wait until tomorrow, he's probably long gone.    The Momo paradox in action.    Oh god my heart, she was so perfect.    Best mom deserves a good route.    I feel a bit angry to be honest, all that wait and only the last chapter is plot, some dates were weak and the scene with the girl kissing Shidou even though he was going berserk and the girls had little to no power was bland.    I think it was kinda cute. Mostly fluff in this volume. With some tiny bits here and there of plot hints   No.2 spirit Next time   Inverse Kurumi when?    Miku is worst girl   You think that the volume with Shidou on it would be more plot heavy, but apparently not. Quite a bit of setup, but otherwise just a twist to the generic DAL formula.    It was fun.    I think that's what almost everyone expected but the worst part is with Shidou going berserk this volume Tachibana can't use this plot point again for future volumes.    Moegami is best Origami.     we will never get her decently animated      Interesting slow down volume. Like the reverse take on making the Spirits take on Shidou instead of the other way around.     They aren't too far behind     That's a nepgear   This is also a nepgear.      Tohka has like 12 kisses now. Who's next, Yoshino with 4?      Maybe?... You never know with Tsunako.      Sure they can. Next time he can skip the berserk state and go straight to Inversing and raining fire and brimstone ovee the world.      Decent for a break volume but It didn't excuse the amount of time we wait for it.   Movie Thread Next?   but we need build up first and there must be a really good reason for that to happen considering Shidou didn't even go inverse this volume    I would have done her doggy style right then and there.    This may as well as be it, considering the thread is new and will be probably be here all night.

Plus now we know that Mana was actually kidnapped and something happened to Mio. However that happened four years ago, which was after Shidou was left with the Itsuka family. It's all a crazy time line.    This. Long wait, then Shidou on cover, "Itsuka Disaster", but it's just a break volume. Maybe there are some consequences for Shidou going berserk later on?    mfw tell myself I'll drop the series if the retard asks for kisses for all the spirits he's sealed   she does   It was a good run guys, dropping the series.      Shidou suddenly recalling those events, Mio and Phantom lines were the only new info we got in this volume, sadly.    I'd make her do more than sweat.    She only gave Shidou 1 extra kiss.    Ellen kills Mana in front of Shido after a whole volume of childhood establishing flashbacks.    SUFFERING SINCE KURUMI GOT NOTHING.   INB4 HER FAULT  I know. But still. It was alright. Also tohka has a frighteningly insatiable appetite for shidou kisses.      It's not a bad idea but Mana must become a spirit if she wants to get relevance for more than 1 chapter.    Not just that, but we also got info about Mana's situation. Ellen apparently was the one who captured Mana. I have to question if it was DEM or Phantom who memory wiped Mana, considering how we've only seen Phantom with the power of memory wipes. Plus it seems if Shidou does get his memory back, he's going to have real resentment against DEM.   Not only that, but we also got a better idea of Phantom's goal thanks to the explanation of Sephira crystals.      Dates were enjoyable, all the girls got kisses, setting up plot for the next arc, dealing with Kotori's killing Shidou bullshit. It was an alright bridge volume, so to call it. Too much blatant Tohka favoritism, but then again, it's Date A Tohka     I feel like the author trolled us with this volume. Anyway, it would be lame if he decides to use the "Shidou going berserk thing again" I mean the only threat he posed was being a time bomb but he wasn't destroying the city like Origami did and the girls in those very weak forms still managed to stop him.     Not just that, but we also got info about Mana's situation. Ellen apparently was the one who captured Mana  but Mana getting kidnapped by DEM wasn't anything new. We even speculate about it in older threads.     Don't worry author will reward us with Inverse Kurumi   Miku is worst girl  Any ideas what the next spirit will look like  Long hair and young looking.   another nep clone    Meant for      If she is Number 2 she may have silver/gray hair. If she is Number 6 she may be the drill/blonde high-class type girl. If she is not a Number she may refer to herself as a FREE GIRL.     Either a blonde or grey haired girl, he can also save time and just create another Nepgear.    Mayuri    Thats not Flatori    if some how he makes the movie cannon   Considering the current LN world and how it's developing, and how we pretty much got Birispirit for the movie  here's the daily prayer for Mayuri being tsuntsun   I'd say the next spirit will be some sort of sly foxy kouhai type of girl, if you know what I mean.       Grope her    What part will you grope?      (You)   What part will you grope?   this should be obvious her motherly mounds       Stop making fun of my girlfriend, asshole.    FLAT   So I just finished rewatching S1, does the novels go back and explain more about how Mana as approximately 10 years to live? Or is that something that hasn't been delved into yet since we haven't had a Mana Arc yet in the LN?   She's delicious     Natsumi's loli form still has a bigger chest than Kotori    I can't wait to gaze upon this cute creature   WIZARD MAGIC AIDS  AINT GOT SHIT TO EXPLAIN   Her body was altered in order to manipulate magic on a higher level than a normal realizer, however she's not too compatible with it or something and that fucks her up.<br/>          She'll be the first Spirit that Shido cannot save.     Yes she is.   You say that like it's a bad thing.      Her body's being destroyed by the power jammed into her     causing this much despair in a LN   in DAL of all places  lolno      Technically that was Rinne in her first end    Multiverse theory will make Mayuri cannon    Get out toriyama    What's the difference between Kotori's bra and Tohka's head?   Nothing they're both empty       I'd jam something into her alright.    Magic surgery    I want to take Mii on a dato.    movie will be a reset like utopia and remain Canon/ non canon indefinitely but will still be referenced in the main novel    but that was Kurumi    hasn't saved yet    The author never reuses the same endings, just look at Arusu.    11/10 Funniest post of the day.     Could happen. They've been hinting for a long time that when a Spirit dies it leaves a Sephira. If Mana's mostly dead and a Spirit is actually dead, the solution seems obvious.  Also, baseless speculation, but what if Mio is Shido and Mana's older sister?   Why does she have breasts.         Because she can't be saved, Shidou failed in volume 3 and there is nothing he can do about it.    I want the entire trio    but there is the problem she doesn't have a number in her name.    You can have the other two. I want to cutie with the glasses.    DAL isn't that dark and after all the origami bullshit you expect me to believe she won't be saved?    Anime breasts enhancement.   All the games are canon.   but Origami only killed her parents unlike Kurumi who has killed 10000+ people and I doubt Shidou will go back to the past again if Kurumi's plan involves killing Shidou and take his powers.      I think Mio was a friend of Shido and Mana's mother trusted before leaving for plot.  Also which are the kanjis for Mio in this novel?     I want to marry and anally ravage Tame   Except Ars Install and the third game.   Reminder that Mana is a placeholder and a plotdevice  Reminder that Mio is Shidou's and Mana's childhood friend who was captured by DEM along with Mana  Picture related, Mio and Tohka being sluts        Why does she have breasts.   Because she's best sister  more like only sister, fakes don't count       Cute as fuck  She's my second favorite.      Then there is a strong likely hood of the movie in some way being cannon the author dose have a hand in it after all    Too many sisters    Phantom is Rinne     too many sisters  Never     Shido is a generic nice guy he wants to save all the spirits    Glasses    Only Rinne Utopia is canon.    Tohka is pure anon    based summary anon. You tha' MVP.    and what does that have to do with saving Kurumi if he doesn't have the means to stop her?    Technically, neither does Reine. Not arguing your point, just observing.   Dunno, plus we only have her first name.      Miku is worst girl   Bwaka's can't be pure.     not liking glasses.     then neither does Shidou      Knowing the author he will come up with a solution such as Phantom sending shido back to stop her from killing the First because that doesn't fit with phantoms objective     wanting 7(SEVEN) kisses all at once   "pure"     Ratatoskr is filled with assholes, why not just hire better personal?    Doesn't love dfc Kotori  Why is awful normalfag-like taste like this allowed?     Phantom doesn't have time travel powers.   Now we have to wait for the actual translation   it's not confirmed that she doesn't have some form of it   Best Imouto  Shidou said so, don't bother him about it     Like the others aren't going to press for an equal number themselves, so status quo will be preserved.    Amusingly, he does: 五河. Five.    but that is Kotori's family name not Shidou's.     loli <br/>   Kiss count  Tohka: 5 Kotori, Yoshino: 3 Everyone else: 2  Disgusting         Tachibana would never do that considering Phantom is using Kurumi for her cause.    You're cute. Here's your reply.     he doesn't like glasses     Yoshino has 4 if you count that one in Date A Origami    Retard Favoritism    No Kotori's cute. That anon is just a shit head.    More like magnificent  If only she wasn't interrupted. Damn you Tachibana.     by the end of the series Tohka will have more than 10 kisses.    Excuse me while I vomit    dose Phantom truly want Kurumi to kill the first spirit? that is the question that would determine her action     The way it should be    She will die    He doesn't go by Takamiya though. He even thinks of himself as Itsuka.    and taken a half dozen dicks    Quit shit posting and hiding behind Tohka. No wonder no one likes her.    No, that's why I said Phantom was using Kurumi for her own cause.    Belive in the multiverse    But that's wrong.  I love her     He's still a Takamiya and Wetscott said he doesn't know anything about Itsuka Shidou but Takamiya Shidou is a different story.    That doesn't apply in the DALverse.    You're not helping her image. I liked her too, but you're leaving a bad impression.      Tohka in charge of remaining a virgin   A failed task if ever there was one      More likely because people are jelly the based Tohka, despite being a "retard" still manages to hold the lead.   Hopefully       fair enough, though I believe she will go through a hell of suffering then ultimately own up to what she has done, then and only then can she find redemption and be saved    Is there a pastebin with the entire summary?   He's taunting Shidou. What Shidou calls himself won't change even when his memories of his birth family return.    Retard.    Even a piece of shit can get the lead if the author writes it like that. Look at Oreimo    Utopia pretty much proves there is a Multiverse or at least alternate timelines    and? Shidou is still a Takamiya who was adopted by the Itsuka family.     Look at Oreimo  FUCK YOU, I ALMOST FORGOT    Serious question though, where does this rape joke come from?   What the fuck are you saying? Rinne just created a dream world. DAL only has different timelines so far.     joke      Kirino   bad  Fuck off mang.      From 4chan.     joke     Way back when volume 7 was not even translated we got spoiler with Westcott saying he wanted to steal Tohka's pride as a woman or something,    Someone thinks they're funny cause they spammed "retard" and "tohka was raped" for the past 2 years.    Volume 7 spoiler and that pic with mind boken Tohka.      Retard   Posting for old times sake   Origami is a spirit  After she becomes a spirit, she ask Kurumi to send her back in time to save her parents. 5 years ago  She goes to the past and ends up killing her parents, by spamming her angel when fighting phantom  She comes back to the future (or present, whatever you feel like calling it) as an inverse spirit, Shidou tries to save her but she's just gone man  Kotori dies from a light ray of darkness shot by Origami, Origami actually shoots and kills everyone in the Fraxinias ship  Shidou then wins a ticket to the past sponsored by everyone's favorite clock to 5 years ago  He meets Tama-chan and then we are waiting for Vol. 11   It's up to you to decide if Tohka got raped in Vol. 7 or not before going inverse    ORIGAMI A SHIT                       Yeah, that was a thing that happened. It's legitimately creepy too, but the spammers are just spewing shit and not referencing that.    I remember all that delicious Tohko suffering.    五河士道. Five is there, but that is a red herring since that is not his birth name. So if we go with the original 崇宮士道 we get 士 from the name and 十一 put together make his real number which is 11.    It was even more surprising how some Tohkafags thought the rape jokes were real.    Eden was an alternate space the engulft the city    No     That imagesize   &gt;archive filename confirms it Holy fucking shit, it's tohka bump limit retard       After seeing it for the three hundredth time it's hard to tell if anon is failing to be funny or shitposting.    This spoiled the volume for me unironically when I came here    Not amount of suffering can save Kurumi from his fate, changing her past is the only way.     mfw all those butthurt retardfags dropping the series every thread  Hilarious     Did you enjoy all the suffering in this volume?    I was expecting Kotori suffering to be honest, now there is no chance for her to go inverse.    then that's what Tachibana will do   Color anon where?  Coloring for this when?     it was Delicious     swimsuit theighhigh combo  my dick is destroyed     I doubt he will use the same method to save Kurumi, especially when Kurumi is the one who used it on Shidou.   I want to invert Tohka's anus, if you know what I mean.   I don't follow    Personally, I found the whole thing funny with those naive Tohkafags falling for such obvious bait.     prolapse is my fetish  m-me too     Retard.    Get the fuck out, Houkifag.     I only come for summary threads .    yeah I agree with you there it will be different, but Tachibana will find away this im certain of.  much hype for those volumes       In the end that paste managed to fulfill it's purpose, drive secondaries away from 2nd season threads.   Sisters harem when?   She got two kisses and you are still complaining? That's being greedy like Tohka.   which sento would you sento?  Is that from the OVA?   If the fairies represent each element, what does Sento represent?  Motherhood, health and fertility?       all dem clothing switches  Sento is FAT in the good way      The heart.     Why choose this ripoff when you can go for the real deal? It'll also be free of social retardation.    Heart, you dolt.     anal pounding    Where's the goddamn raws at?   Why does Snail have child bearing hips? What is this sorcery?    Nevermind, found it.    The one that is not Sento   Sento the BEST Amagi Brilliant Park   Yes.   KyoAni lost its way.  RIP    Facebook filename     I like where this is going.    All the creatures in this show have the same rape face, man.   And I love it, doujins when?      Wrestling anime by Kyoani when?   I wouldn't Sento any Sento.  I'd force her and Kanye to fuck and watch them carefully with my fingers Gendo-style.      One shitty wrestling anime is enough for one decade.     FIRE  ALL, BUT FIRE IS BEST      Where? Can't find shit on nyaa even searching for 甘城ブリリアントパーク     nosub tv   Has Kyoani ever created a more sexual character than Sento?  Oh fuck, totally forgot more OVA's were coming   Her name is Muse.    WHAT YOU GONNA DO WHEN PINK MAYOI RUNS WILD ON YOU?!     she is love       Wait, I know that there were little specials/shorts in every BD release, but I didn't hear about any full length OVA eps.   9 pages of doujins     I'd any Sento.   Jesus Christ those Sento's   Conversely, not having any Sento's makes her head look really big when wearing that outfit       sento is  T H I C K H I C K           Just. Pure. Sex.          The fuck is going on in this episode?        Just ask them both for double paizuri.   This episode just reiterated the fact that Sento is thick and sexy.    It'll also be free of social retardation.    implying social retardation doesn't make me fully erect       Maximum overlewd.    Everything.     I know Sento likes Kanie but do the fairies?

This better get a second season eventually. You can tell they had a blast making it.  Also, what was wrong with Muse's head?       slept wrong      we didn't see pic related  I know it's asking for too much, but I feel somewhat cheated.   Is vivid going to sub this?  Is Ashe in this?   I like how Kanye is hitting tirami in the back    MY DICK     couldnt even put up a picture wiwth her in the foreground     But that's lewd anon.    they wouldn't let a man pro-wrestle a woman would they?       you fucking idiot you're supposed to mention the new episode is out    when did kyoani become so lewd   Seriously, Sento is the most lewd character I've seen in years.     not having the fairies tag team avchan and then molest her after putting her in submission   you had one job kyoani        She's the combination of innocence but also lewdness      her voice is also pure sex    Pure heart, lewd body    No Sento in accountant outfit.  you WHAT.       implying ashe would be up for that     Do they combine into Captain Sento?    Her meeting outfit is close enough.    no group saying they're doing subs   Sento Claus would be my choice.   yup, a deadly combination for my heart, she's so incredible it makes me cry   Did they announce season 2 with the OVA?   Nope, just another OVA someday.    PresSento    You son of a bitch.    kek    Anyone?    I think I saw her in it somewhere    mfw they just keep making OVAs season 2 is made up of OVAs     source?  better than nothing I suppose     subs   air     season 2 is made up of OVAs  Sounds like SYD     Not enough ass. The manga was better regarding that. I can't say nothing bad about her Sentos though.    I just. Absolute perfection. Best girl combined with best element.     source?   google.ca       .ca    what is it about Sento that makes her so much more pretty than the other kyoani girls?   The fact that she  doesn't behave like a FUCKING ANNOYING CUNT  is a big plus I reckon    The fact that she always makes this slightly pained and reserved face? She always comes across as someone who is really trying.    There's more to her than just incompetence and/or anger.     her   pure heart     She has  9 pages of Doujins     Kyaa~    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Afx<wbr>itIDRK7c</wbr>  [ ]     I like that they give her a subtle smile instead of a big goofy smile.     pure    she was talking about pornokun    she actually is      ...oh right, I'm supposed to be mad about this.   ...Kyaa~      Subs fucking when   anyone has that muse stitch?   Who is this Sento Demon?   I'd take seasonal OVAs, even inconsistent once/twice a year OVAs over a season 2. Keep the anime alive forever. 5 years down the line I still want there to be amagi OVA being made      blood  THAT'S NOT PG    ¢o    please let her fullfill her wishes    that outfit makes me have dirty thoughts     that navel  I need to hunch over.          Why is it always that most fun shows don't get a second season? I still can't get over Seto no Hanayome and now this.    My dick.   Why was Kanye not in his office helping Latifa out?    fuck I didn't want to fap today goddamn you kyoani      I didn't want to fap today  what is wrong with you    I am amazed by how really close KyoAni copied Nakajima's art into the anime.   what did you expect their almost as godly as Ufotable     pure heart   tried to check porn and also monapis          She was being innocently curious    i know that i am asking for too much, but a pantyhose version would kill my dick       Latfia in a ponytail   Sento with her hair down.   This is what happens when great things are achieved,anons.         Miku Kadowaki is one of Kyoani's best character designer   Was Sento the only one in the Kanyebowl?   I'm curious, where did this, "fairies and navels," thing begin?    I want this callendar.    Kanye is the only other contestant. If he could clone himself but in girl form he would choose his clone.   SENTO U KAISHI    i still have two of them.  interested?     Of course.  How did you get them in the first place?        those butt fangs     tfw S2 never   so in the end who was the worse themepark manager? John Hammond or 50 cent?      give me your @      yeoldfakeacc@gmail.com    Who /watchingitraw/ here?  Meme subs when?    I haven't seen this show why is she crying?      because you haven't seen this show    Her group of friends all end up working together on a professional anime production. They've wanted that since the end of high school.    Thinkin' of dreams.   I'd Sento any Sento at any Sento fucking Sento   Tears of happiness. All 5 friends had finally got to work together on the same project.    ...so salama then?    So this is what it's like when two autist like each other but can't tell the other.     Tough choice between Air and Water, both look so sexy with Sento's looks.    SUBS WHEN? U B S  W H E N ?            I was really hoping for a suffering ending.    <br/>    I'm happy it got a happy ending.    How many times I wonder has this happened because I had no social capabilites.     My boner isn't.      Boners are never happy anon    Not trying to go to much into RL. But I know exactly two times where I found out that the other girl also liked me but I was too autistic to make a move.    how can so much sex be in one picture    i came just by watching this    Probably never if you're ugly.     implying        someone should have probably asked vivid before this came out    this is my fetish     this the best girl   what is this? A slut for ants?     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127174073  yours does not have thighighs    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127174073   Girl's thicker than a bowl of oatmeal.      Wrong.  She's second-best.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127174073    All of them.    this will never be subbed   you will never actually know what the episode is about unless you watch it raw     I don't think sento would get along with sento or sento     not learning moon    Who Tiramie here?  I miss this show.    learning mongolian for malaysian rotoscope toons     kyoani being kyoani     I want to fuck Nonaka Ai's voice     The result of what happens when Kyoani has a lot of free time    Macaron's daughter will never get animated  Why live   how long till kyoani just goes fuck it and adapts this uncensored   I think they should just go 'fuck it' and make S2 and stop trying for artsy fartsy.    But isn't this a hentai doujin unless I'm mistaken?    it's by the author and illustrationist     That moment when Kyoani starts making hentai     What's the context of this?    Officially canon   Kyoani found a way.  Too bad Hibike is shit.     Why not? Do you steer with your dick?    Because Zuka-chan finally stopped fucking up her auditions and got herself a VA role    Was it for an eroge?     I think they should just go 'fuck it' and make S2 and stop trying for artsy fartsy.  They don't have enough story. Right now there is enough for 6 episodes or so. And there isn't any plot on Chris Tucker yet. The latest book involved the waterpark.     Man, I really need to get around to reading the LN's.   according to nyaa comments DDY is subbing the ova         Kobori didn't make an appearance, did she?      She showed up but I don't think she got any lines.      somehow her midriff feels more erotic than the fairies?    its over  our dicks are finished     I think I know who directed this episode.   Dammit.  Now I'm really wishing for a S2.       Fire Sento  OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOD       Didn't notice that the other Fairies swapped outfits too, will have to dump that is well.    Those are some nice  airbags        I wanted drawfags to draw Sento in the Elementario outfits    mfw KyoAni did it themselves   A way was absolutely found. Too bad they're not all detailed like  but muh dick remains satisfied.          So these outfits are magically made to form fit and not get stretched?   My dick.    I can't tell whose more aroused in that picture       Salama excited that she's wearing Muse's clothing     once again worst girl ruins everything   oh my god        Water Koboldi     You trying to ruse me?    And here's the last thing I'm posting unless something else lewd crops up later in the episode (haven't finished watching it yet) Figured I didn't need to post this one since  is much higher quality art wise, but I felt bad about not completing the set.        Yooooooooo.        Why is it always that most fun shows don't get a second season?   There's a real danger the comedy won't be as funny as the first time.     Salama as Muse   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dOi<wbr>QYt7eqbI</wbr>  [ ]    how is this legal   I can't tell who is who in this picture       Seconds later, I see this. Kyoani finds a way.  You're a bit late to the party m8.              that shop      Salama showing Kobori Muse's erongenous zones   and her favorite spots to lick      Goddess of sex having such tiny nipples.     Jasas chrost.  Those sentos are out of control.  Her hips stretched the shit out of the fairies outfits.      no bully it took me less than 5 minutes    I am Sento, the fairy of semen     How hard would you Sento?   Oh lawd Lawd jesus If there's no season 2, we fucking riot brehs         are we going to need new names       Id rather my waifu.    Tell those Hibikeks you are not flavor of the season Sento.      Who is this dairy fairy?      Can't be.    I want to drink that bath water.     koboli actually displaying cleavage    Will based [Mori] save us?  This is classic Fumoffu of lewdness  pls tell me the clock was still buried under the cicadas  Mori only does specials       ... I think that's moffle    It's the Lucha guy wearing a Moffle outfit.    I'm taking a shit and now I can't take my dick out.  Goddamn.      how?    I was also peeing.    fucking amateur      THE SEMEN FAIRY    She won't be able to walk for a week.       how?        r9k goes on a date.jpg      implying she isn't going to be filled with something else     I would sento any sento.       Oh, shit, Sento, what are you doing?         tfw that discord between Sylphie and Kumiko's voice  how are these the same actress    well of course the voice actress of the worst girl would go onto voice the lead in the show distracting us from true perfection   KyoAni with the top-tier background waifus as usual.    salama   wanting that weirdo autist anywhere near her beloved       you will never inappropriately rub salama's gratuitous cleavage     This makes me curious, does Kyoani ever throw character references to their previous works in their backgrounds?   I would say they are above that, but with their flagrant /u/ and /y/ pandering, I don't know anymore.       /y/ pandering   kaniexmoffle is canon      Do I get that post if I order the bd or its sell in a special store?    They don't. Which is a shame because who wouldn't of loved a good ole game of "Spot the kyoani" character in the background with all the crowd scenes of the park. Too bad they don't own the IP's of there most famous works to make it work.     I'm pretty sure I saw a Dera lookalike in one of the episodes lining up to order lunch.      So hard, that her body would kaching kaching kaching!       I feel like this is a doujin in the making.   Brown haired shota seduces black haired kid's mom   Finds a place for some /ss/   Her son finds them   Brown convinces the mom to let him join in   incestuous /ss/ threesome commences   Then Tiramie out of fucking nowhere   Kicks shotas off mother   LET ME SHOW YOU HOW IT'S DONE-MIE   Proceeds to rape the mother   It seriously writes itself.               On that note about taking a shit and erections, I actually have a problem where if I want to go fap, I actually have a huge sudden urge to take a shit. Is it just me or does anyone else have this problem? Like just now, I was going to go fap to some sento, but yeah, went to take a shit instead.   No, you're just fucking weird.    https://amaburithetranslation.wordp<wbr>ress.com/</wbr>     This happens to me sometimes, but SOMETIMES, not always.     What episode is this screenshot from? We should get this without the text     still in volume 2  why would you do this? Why not start from whatever volume the anime leaves off on? Guess I'll come back 2 years from now.      Because the main arc of the anime ends in Volume 1. The anime pulled in a bunch of parts from the later volumes and extended the deadline of the park to fit them in    Oh, cool. I guess I'll read it after all then.   JUST FUCK ALREADY   Woah, calm down Migi.   Imagine yourself  hugging  Sento     Can't. Whenever I try I wind up imagining myself squeezing her boobs.    They've gone pretty far in the LN    No way, how would I hide my raging boner?     adjusting his tie  How are they allowed to sell this in stores? I'm gonna have a heart attack.     Their spaghetti is too cute.  The series may not be a romance but this is the kind of relationship that would have the best payoff. Hopefully Gatoh delivers just enough for KyoAni and Kadokawa to do a second season.   I fully expect Tiramie and Macaron to buy them a room at the love hotel         Please tell me they confessed, or at least realize they got feelings for each other but are too shy to do anything about it.    They at least realize, but still haven't said it out loud. Gatoh said it won't happen as long as they're co-workers    Oh, my budda.    Only if i try faping before my nooner I schedule all my poops it makes life easy     I feel bad for the guy.     But what will Kanye do that doesnt have to do with the park?    I try not to, my poor heart could only endure as much.    Any Sento is best Sento.     that swedish flag wraper  JUST CUCK MY SHIT UP WITH CHRIS TUCKER    Fuck Sento, post more Tirami   Exactly     it won't happen as long as they're co-workers   All this sexual tension has to give at some point. And I can't wait for it to happen.      nice memes   Salami is so fucking gay for Muse. Also, Latifa a qt.    You'll never inspect Sento's merchandise       just noticed salama has gradient hair    bump   <br/>       Soft?    sauce?   Subs when?           The softest    why is Koboli pulling her skirt down when her normal outfit shows her crotch?   S2 or riot.   RIOT    I think they stole it.  Even if it was, do you really see Kanye digging through those to see if there's something underneath?     I miss my fairies  ;;    This is technically a special    sometime probably     They miss you too, Anon.     someone shop this so they have the yugioh markings please    criminy jim jim I'd plunder that booty like the anchors flew outta me pants     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=h1z<wbr>GqRXZlnY</wbr>  [ ]     Perhaps they'll just have casual sex and kissing sessions while not being a couple    they are perfect    Sento wouldn't mind having sex with the man she loves, but I think she'd settle for  hand-holding.     THEY NEED TO FUCK    that isnt a loophole    Handholding using the excuse for "business" purposes. Someone will criticize the park for being not couple friendly so Sento and Kanye will try and become a pretend couple and do couple things to evaluate the park.   I never understood the point of Seiya's eye powers. He barely even used them.   It was a mind-reading ability that he can only use once for each person, so I can kind of understand it. Lot of missed potential for a good episode centered around it though.     Just what was on her mind that required that much consideration before telling us? Seiya thought of using his magical power, the one granted to him by the princess of Maple Land.    (No…)    Now was not the time.    This should be used if an important event occurs when and if she gets accepted to work for Amaburi.    Said the person who never used his grenades in games.              A fujo surrounded by lesbians  Being Koboli is suffering.    If Kanye's power is reading minds, how can he be surprised by the party?   Because he didn't use it then.  He can only use mind reading once on a person. It's not on all the time.       no doujin where muse and salama disabuse kboli of her misguided notions of heterosexuality     Thanks   this ep...wtf lol   Their kids will be so beautiful.   Why did they show Kanye calculate those numbers that one time in his head and make no mention of those skills ever again   I don't think he was ever in another situation where estimations like that would have helped.    It's estimating. It's not too hard.    God that made me smile   I can't get the mental image of 50 Cent wearing those lewd outfits out of my head.   It was hard for me...     Maximum overlewd.  oh god my sides. i needed that.      ...wtf lol  kill yourself    Hope we get subs soon.   And I think I'm due for a rewatch of the series.     Might as well since all the Blu Rays are out    the joke is that in most LN that deal with fantasy, the MC gets a magical power that nobody else has that lets him beat everything. Or he was born with them because he has a stupid backstory that makes him even more special. Kanye has an incredibly good power for getting people to come to his park but he never has to use it because he's motherfucking Kanye West.    There are a few parts that can be dull the second time around, but most of it holds up pretty well.  The pirate episode is always gold.     F-feet.Hngsasdfads      The pirate episode is hands down the best episode The "Invasion of the body snatchers" and the fairy episode a close second     I love the fairies but their episode was shit. Their BD special was pretty good though. The Kanie suit episode was the best by far   Why is Sento so lovely?   No secretary Sento to make love to during lunch breaks.  Why even manage?   All of them. All of them.          Her hair and the fact that she has just the right amount of thickness.   Which one?    Middle row, second from the right     Yes   Get in http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87   We're doing /a/ sings Sono chi, the full version. Recordings are due June 9th.   Email killahspectah@live.com.     What if parts 4 and 5 are part of the same season?    You mean July 9th, you nerd   fourth for wanting to eat hot pants' chunky peanut butter   Was part 4 hinted at?   I'm trying to find something about it but I can't yet.          https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PoR<wbr>Iv1ZDnRI</wbr>  [ ]    b-but, we're already sing it  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2wb<wbr>lN9-05AM</wbr>  [ ]     isn't part 5 kind of long?    SONO CHI NO KIOKU ORA ORA ORA ORA    It felt that way for me until the boss tried killing Trish, then it felt rushed as shit.  What confused me the most is that Giorno couldn't revive Narancia once his body was revived. I mean, Joseph came back to life and we saw his soul pass on for God's sake.     Did Araki every mention if it was Josuke who put his coat under the car and saved baby Josuke, and he just forgot to put it in?   Araki probably forgot Joseph was revived  Or maybe it was because he was revive from vampire blood and not stand magic?      It was just some guy.    Why did araki even revive joseph? I like him but it was so unnecessary.    I'd imagine he wanted to do something about that with Bites za dusto but ran out of time    it was josefumi of course    So we could have character development for Josuke, silly   Would you let rule 63 kira suck on your fingers?   Can Bites za dusto go back that far or am I just naive for not expecting an Araki brand ass pull.    n-no    Maybe he had already planned a bit of part 4's plot?  The only reason they found out about Josuke is because Joseph was planning his will, if he died in SC then DiU would never have happened      o rite  what if Josuke was Holly's second son?      Finding out your dad is dead isn't the type of news a person recovering from a nearly deathlike state needs to hear.    Would she kill me afterwards? I would let her suck my every inch for eternity.    nigger josuke didn't know who his father was until he was like 16  tfw no runaway girl doujinshi      no episode tomorrow    no chapter  I'm not feeling it anymore     Y'know, rule 63 every main villain except for DIO, and I'd be their fuckpuppet for all eternity  and DIO too      Hes talking about holly retard.    Why did that cat plant obey KQ and live in his stomach?    I was talking about Holly you double nigger.    Well this is embarrassing. Meant for<br/>    ZW will never do a porn with SP recording  Fuck DIO. If only he was good. ZW and SP could act all like bros and shit.    oh shieeeeet  fucking misleading faggot          I hate how in Jojo All Star Battle they gave pre Kosaku Kawajiri Kira the shity non killer queen tie.     What if there was a universe where stands were the people and humans were the stands?  What would this scene look like with the other jojo crews?  Continuing from the whole only stand user in the world thing, I think being a vampire would be fucking awesome as long as a random bit of UV light wouldn't kill you. Being able to slowly make my way to the top of the world under a lot of different identities over the years and having my own clan of vampires under me would be sweet.  I'm a VtMfag, shoot me   If you want your Runaway Girl doujin so badly, someone who can write in Japanese without sounding like and idiot please contact the mangaka.

Yeah sure why not Doesn't someone use it to undo the death of the universe in Jorge Joestar     If they fucked do you think they would make a stand like Stone Free?    I've been busy laying low waiting for the final episode hype to die down.       I guess I'll get that version for you soon then.    T-thank you Doc kun~   I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not.             Can stands control their user like that?    Of course not.    That one clip of the two voice actors singing the theme. I want my cookie.      His laughing in this scene was hilarious.   <br/>  Just finished Battle Tendency's adaptation Pretty good, Caesar's  death  scene was done greatly Gonna start SDC adaptation now     no more jojo fridays   &gt;possibly forever     cool   Can anyone give me a better resolution of this? Or rather can anyone dank it up, making him say "I came here to laugh at you" or even "I came here to kek at you"   Why didn't F.F. let herself get revived? She'd probably still be a good guy even if she wasn't the same F.F. Jotaro wouldn't need to worry about Jolyne getting skewered, he could just toss her in the way of some knives, rek Pucci and F.F. could save her.     I already made something like that.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=__j<wbr>PkucX_CM</wbr>  [ ] I just noticed LunarSpiral uploaded this  The girl crying over kakyoins death        Why don't you just go take the screen shot yourself faggot. MPC even has a screenshot key.    this is cute wish i could read it     Thank you Doc kun~    i didn't have the episode anon. don't be an asshole.  thanks doc      Didn't Pucci still have her disc?   Can anyone post the edit of that scene where jotaro lets go of the receipt that says "ur a fag"    he doesn't archive shows until BDs come out       I know anon. I deleted it like a retard. I don't want to download it again though.   Help /a/, my 9 year old cousin wants to be a marine biologist when he grows up. He's already researching all the different types of sharks.   Thank you Doc. You are my favorite   After STALKER      Kakyoin is 178 cm Everyone else is is around 190cm This makes no sense       not starfish  He's okay.     that kid is autistic mane sorry     How are we doing the ora part? Are we doing it like the song or is it a ORA ORA MUDA MUDA scream off?    here's higher res you can repay me by not using the word dank     Dank as fuck, thanks anon.    dank you anon  :^)    BDs when?   Joseph looks like he isnt wearing pants in that scene. Seriously it looks like his hairy ass leg is free in the breeze.     look at how he stands anon he is conscious of his height     https://www.google.com/calendar/emb<wbr>ed?src=ciaual7l89unnh1h4410vmn4u8%4<wbr>0group.calendar.google.com</wbr></wbr>   <br/>   They all aren't wearing pants, anon  Avdol has that censored void and the school uniforms obscure the other two's dongers      Those are called clothes you nudist freak.   Think you can make a better edit than this faggot?     It never even occured to me to think about making Dio's World/Jurassic World edits.     no dick in DIO's mouth   tumblr  what?     Josefumi has a dumb, punchable face. Shit hair doesn't help.   fucking hell doc     kissanime         Pucci attracted 3 of Dio's children   but not Giorno   Imagine if Giorno had been there to fight Pucci with GER  I guess we wouldn't have SBR then though       With all the shit that animeonly fags are giving over the Jotaro Vs DIO fight, just imagine what will happen when King Crimson is introduced.   how many times do we have to go through this, SBR isnt the ireneverse!    sbr isn't the ireneverse or anything like that     Well shit  Sorry, I'm still reading through part 6       The fags were giving shit because they were comparing to the OVA and all that unmanageable hype.    Is this confirmed? I always assumed Araki never confirmed or denied it is the same universe.     Nah, Dio's World really does have a ridiculous amount of "Why doesn't X do Y?" and it's all the more noticable when you're watching it instead of reading it at your own pace.    that's where i watch jojo before i download it if you have a high quality ova download feel free to link it     That too. Lots of plot armor and stupid crap Araki wrote at the time.     animeonly fags   unmanageable hype  oh anon      Are you serious? Did nyaa and all the private trackers shutdown or something?     never confirmed or denied it is the same universe  this, but the joestars being nowhere near florida convinces most people that there is no way for irene to get the star birthmark.     hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm    I failed to understand how this proves anything.   Favorite non Main Villain Stand battle in each part? I'll start. Part 3: D'arby The Gamer Part 4: Highway Star Part 5: Metallica Part 6: Guard Westwood's Secret Part 7: Scary Monsters Part 8: Born This Way         It's not just that. The SBRverse is different in ways that would make no sense if it was because of MIH.   I want the next main Jojo villain to be a girl. Is that too much to ask for?   3. Vanilla Ice 4. Highway Star 5. Metallica 6. Bohemian Rhapsody 7. True Man's World 8. Beetlemania         I think it would be really nice to have a female antagonist for once. I would really like to see what Araki would do.     I'M SORRY?     i'm serious in that i've never bothered to download the ova, yeah   GET IN HERE NIGGA  http://yourafool.keyblade.jp       what the fuck is that   You know what jojo rule 63 art I hope/wish exists? Something that would show Dio and Johnathan's body types being different in some way (like one having bigger boobs than the other or something), making it obvious that DIO has johnathan's body      we posting anime fakes?    where are these from?          I grabbed them from a past thread, reverse search gave me nothing Yukako looks super legit, i would be pleased if that was her official design.     koichi looks like an actual shark     that forehead  HNNNNG    Zero no Tsukaima LN Continuation Confirmed  http://www.zero-tsukaima.com/    How would they summon the spirit of the author?   Is the author coming back as a zombie?    BASED A S E D       Is MF Bunko that starved for ideas that they'd steal from the dead? This seems really iffy.  Not even death can stop shitty LNs from being produced it seems.   Tiffa will be fucking killed in your life time   FUCK YES    Reminder than translation never  Finally, besttsun returns!  Really? Who is gonna write that?  Should have just released author notes.   Novels from the hell.    Seems the editors.    Nah, it's the editor find a new author, just still don't know who he/she is.   It was shit but damn it is the definition of a guilty pleasure.  Really want them to have the series crossover with our world so they can travel between them. That would really refresh the series.   Also needs to Jam it Louise. She is craving his dick at this point.       He continues to live through his shit franchise that no one wants to admit to liking.   I could think of far worse fates.    I love ZnT and Louise though    I want to live    They're just finishing it, the last 2 volumes.  Tiffa will die, Louise will get it jammed and other things.     Zero no Tsukaima is a great series and everyone who "ironically" liked it instead of just outright liking it should stop being retarded.   2nd season has a special place in my heart as the final episode made me cry and feeling good.    Louise will get it jammed and other things.  She better. IIRC she is begging for it in LN at this point.        The second season's last episode's last 30 seconds are what made me drop the show. I did read the LNs after though, but all of that development right out the window in the last fucking 20 seconds of the show made me drop it on the spot.     last episode's last 30 seconds are what made me drop the show   Hilarious.     correct me if im wrong, but I only watched the anime. Does this mean that the next season will take place in the real world with louise and Saito? I wouldn't be surprised if their is some shitty excuse for the two to go back, like to fight some magical demon lord. They better not fuck this up, bringing back authors from the dead just for this.  louise is best girl!     I've done the same thing before, for other shows.  Also it's a shame they didn't adapt the war aftermath properly       next season  Anon, the anime was finished and will never get anything else.  this is for the novels.   I do wish we could get a Movie or something to adapt these two volumes, or an OVA or something.          Wait what? This is excellent news. One can only hope the notes left by the author will be enough to make a proper plot and Louise ending.   It'll still make you wonder what the author intended to do towards the end. This is just some random people trying to fit stuff together and make a different route albeit probably acceptable at least    Louise ending.   implying it will not be a Siesta ending      The editor probably knows the author's intentions so it should be fine. On the other hand, he could just say fuck it and tell the new writer to do something completely different.    That's the thing really, it's hard to consider this canon when the original author's six feet under.  My Opinion of course    I wonder how much they'll advertise this.  Would be stupid to just release with barely any advertisement. Maybe an OVA or something.    I SAY YES ZUTTO    病床のヤマグチ先生より完結までのプロットが遺されておりました。   Yamaguchi has finished to make the entire plot.      They're finishing the light novel?! How? And if I remember correctly, there was only a couple volumes left to write but remained unfinished due to the sudden passing. So the story was almost done.    Yes, author notes and editor will finish the novels. They will be releasing the last two volumes based on extensive notes left by the author in case he passed away. Seems like they are going to grant his wish of finishing his series rather than going full idiot and not doing it out of respect for the dead.      It sounds like the author and the family were all for it.    They also make sure to ask his family first.    Well, the last 30 seconds of season 2 is anime original   Saito is 'dead' for months in the LN and Louise tries to kill herself       Wedding version best version    Well let's hope the editor didn't find a lame author.    LNs are way fucking better, and now that they are getting finished the anime ending won't matter. Specially if the LN ends with them fucking like rabbits, Louise getting impregnated and then Saito showing Louise his world, home and family.     Yeah, I read the LNs after so I knew what was "supposed" to happen.  Maybe I'll go back and watch seasons three and four some day, but I really hated elf tits.     Thanks for the spoiler Anon.  No srsly Iam finally going to start reading the LN .    I don't really care if the LN is overall shit or not, I'm just glad the publisher want to respect the dead author by finishing it in his stead.    I watched all of the anime and loved it. S3 is definitely the weakest one but I still enjoyed it a lot.   I started watching anime because of this show.  I swear to God, if that maid cockblocks them AGAIN in the last chapter, I will go to hell and kill yamaguchi myself  That maid really needs to fuck off    Pure joy!  Concrete proof that Japan succeed to summon dead person's soul. They did it just for money. Truly evil... Evil... Absolutely evil...  I wonder how many orphaned children's blood they sacrificed for this depravity?     Bitch, i love the LN and best-tsun.   Last thing I remember from the LN is the mom chasing them down and them saying how fucked they were.   Keep in mind I'm not the biggest fan of this series but I would love to see the story finished. This better fucking end well!!    I think I remember mention of him leaving notes for his death.    Whose mom?    Anime is done, anon. This is only LN's. If they wanted to continue the anime they'd have to do even further original content.   Never forget    Summoning GARcher.   I guess she nailed it.      It's good, anon. You won't regret it.    Reminds me of that one Fate x ZnT fanfiction.   I'm still surprised that ZnT crossover fanfiction is still active until now       Louise's  IIRC there is a novel image of it but I can't remember the volume     I'm glad.   mfw we will never get more of Louise's mom adventures when she was hotter than Louise    I don't blame her. All she wanted was a decent familar and instead she got angsty asshole who wanted to kill his past self even though he knew 99% sure that it wouldnt undo his own shitty existance anyway.  I'd be unhappy too.      Everyone would get fucked from the get go if she had summoned Archer.   http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/?<wbr>title=Zero_no_Tsukaima  WILL WE EVER GET IT TRANSLATED THOUGH?  </wbr>   But there's no high-jump boy in Halkeginia. Also: summon servant's mind altering bind.    He'd get flustered and dere'd in 2 secs after forming the bond     Summon Archer   Every woman in their world panties flood wanting him     This is the news of the year.  The resurrection of Zero no Tsukaima is the best way to bid farewell to the author. His influential legacy will be eternal. Rest in peace.      flustered   GARcher vs RIEEEEEEEEEE   It'd be glorious.      Quick, who was more influential in the grand scheme of everything  Shakugan no Shana   or  Zero no Tsukaima  Quickly, respond!          What is it about Louise that makes her more likable than the other Rie Tsunderes not including Taiga?   The Era of Rie is long gone   I miss the days of constant bitching about hearing her.        It's not like I want to protect your adorable ass or anything.   I-it's not like I admire your coolness or anything!!!  ZnT: The Tsunderening     More perflat is always welcome   ZnT  I don't remember much about Shana as it didn't leave a lasting impression but I still remember ZnT crystal clear.     Anyone got the epubs/mobie/pdf. The links on BT are all dead.   ZnT thread  Obligatory  https://www.youtuberepeater.com/wat<wbr>ch?v=s0CuyZBaG90  Also DON'T FORGET TO PUT YOUR HEADPHONES  </wbr>      Someone needs to pick it back up, this should hopefully bring interest back into ot   If they go for a shitty tsundere end, here's a reminder it won't be canon since the author is dead.  Best mother   Read the thread Nigger.    It would beb based on author notes so canon.  Also Louise is love.     I wanted to fuck her bad. It would make her less bitchy.   Delicious loli-Karin    She definitely needed a healthy dose of Vitamin "D", stat.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_4Y<wbr>NB7azSBg</wbr>  [ ]   they summoned him as a counter guardian      I love Rie and wish we could usher in a new Rie era.  Also all Ries are love and life though      I don't see it being a tsun end, Louise is basically throwing herself on saito's duck the the previous 5 volumes, of only they weren't cockblocked by meido/elftits     new Rie era.  Well, we had Kagura, Black and Howaito this season.  HnA spinoff is coming soon too, she was in the expelled from paradise movie recently as well. Not good enough, but it's something.         Having to re-read everything again  Just fucking kill me     Gabe Blessing pretty much ensured it would never die after Hill of Swords.     I didn't care for his portrayal of Shirou. May as well have just slapped a fucking OC in there.    So ZnT x Fate is seriously a thing in fanfics?  I guess it ain't that much of a stretch with Summon Familiar.     Don't forget the robot.    Oh shit, you're right.  How did I forget her, she's so good.   The show is fucking atrocious though        Hidan No Aria was an underrated masterpiece.   Yeah I'm kind of blaming it for many edgy interpretation of Shirou in many crossover fics. I like his Louise development in that fic though    Did Lousie's mother ever appear in the anime?     So ZnT x Fate is seriously a thing in fanfics?  No, ZnT x ANYTHING is a thing because of Summon Servant.  Gabe's Fate cross is just what popularized it.       Wholeheartedly agree.  Honestly, it's a shame people don't like it more. Aria is fucking hilarious, cute and sexy.      Catches them making out in the boat    That problem isnt just related to gabe.  99% of Fate fics on FFN can be summed up as in name only and no matter how much they change thing he always has UBW at it's highest showing dispite how many things need to happen to create it.      Which season? Damn, I've forgot almost everything about this series.    2nd     He's dead. Louise a shit and didn't win. Deal with it.      being such an assblasted Siestafaggot     Louise has perfect genes. I hope she remains flat forever though.     I hope she remains flat forever though.  She will anon, she will if we all wish for it.      he doesn't like the worst tsundere ever made!   h-he must be an Xfag!  What are you going to do next, accuse me of being some made up bogeyman?      There's actually some pretty hilarious ones.   Louise starts summoning shit from Warhammer 40k   Louise summons Godzilla   Louise summons the Terminator         Oh man, I've read that the Godzilla one is hilarious.    I'm not that anon, but I'm gonna report you to moot    I think Murasaki Yukiya, Tsukasa, or Akira.    It didn't help that his fic after that was even worse in the portrayal. I didn't even finish it.    Also one of the recent one where she summoned a Gundam. Shame that it's probably under hiatus forever now    There's a guy on there called Neoalfa. His Shirou is the closest to Nasu's I've seen while being decently written.   Who is this perfection?    Louise summons a fucking Jaeger w/ Saito as the co-pilot.  Sadly its a one-shot.     The only non-shit Elf in the whole series   I don't even like Louise but I will admit she is better than the other tsunderes. Light novel better fucking end well.    Louise summons a Geth Platform   "This platform is the Juggernaut, female canine."     There's a guy on there called Neoalfa.  Path of the King is pretty great.          Hasn't updated his Dresden Files fic in 11 months   Gabe is kill       Stops at literally his best fic   Feels bad man.      I remember one with some horrible murica self insert who gassed the people of albion then set up a 'democracy' with only one political party which he was of course in charge of.  I laughed so hard i almost fell off my chair.     Great news, I just received my Louise figure and nendoroid in the mail too,  Thank you kamisama      Hot gue intesifies.     Finally! next one should be MM!, I hope so.    Congrats, looks great    Can't wait for Louise and her magical co in the modern world    A good one I've read had Louise summon Alex Mercer from Prototype, mindfuck and bloodbath ensues. It was a long time ago though, I should probably check for updates.     I couldn't blame him if he did    Wasn't there one where she summons Saitama from OPM?    It remind me that fanfiction were she summon a Necron lord.   She should summon  the EMPRAH    Never read that one, will look it up.     I laughed so hard    I'd love to see the day a ZnT thread doesn't turn into fanfic shit discussion.  Is there any other information other than they will finish the series?    I'll just leave this here  https://forums.spacebattles.com/thr<wbr>eads/zero-no-tsukaima-story-thread-<wbr>index-and-updates.229094/</wbr></wbr>      2016   Japan begins to resurrect LN authors to finish their works   One young and promising author is resurrected after he dies in a car accident but decides to stop writing and live out his life as a regular schoolboy   meets several beautiful girls and totally fails to realise that they want his   autograph  see it's all a set up for just another Shitty LN         Dat ZR using garter and dem details of her small delicious body  I want. That is one good and sexy fig.    New season when?   This. Let best girl win.    Sir, are you aware you have objectively shit taste?      I think you meant to quote a Louisefag.     Necron Lord thinks she's a C'tan   Louise cries herself to sleep thinking she's a world destroying monster         Non shit elf.    also a loli.   Welp that makes perfect sense to me guys.          She has shitty sleepy eyes though.    Jesus fucking Christ, thats a lot of volumes. No wonder the Light Novel outlived the author, holy shit. I want to read this but fuck all that overblown tsun in the earlier volumes, the cockblocking and harem status quo all spread out in 20 volumes and side stories of varied translation status.      Author will never finish the LN    Why live      It's worth it, I hope these news will revive the translation efforts. Specially since there's not much left.   Louise is great but goddamn is Saito an unfaithful cunt.   Pink hair is supreme.      Wants third worst girl to win  Fuck that.      JS06 S 0 6       Will the loli save us?    Not to throw you into despair, but ZnT really, really doesn't seem like it would be up js06's alley.     Louise will never sit on your dick, sliding her tight little vag all the way down on you      Louise summons the Terminator  Holy crackers the fanfics literally predicted Genisys.     But i can still fap to that mental image.      &gt;tfw ended up writing my own shitty summoning fanfic  I know some of you are also guilty of this, don't deny it.      The one where she summons the Skyrim player character is fun.       How many LN volumes did the Anime cover?   All of them, even to the unwritten ending.    You're telling me the new movie has a cute littel tsundere ojousan summon Terminator   Guess I'm reading the LN again.  But man did the 1 vs 70,000 sequence suck in the LN.    N-not exactly, just that the series is a prequel reboot with the T800 sent back in time to protect sarah. You can pretend its Louise with guns.     You can pretend its Louise with guns.  So, Aria?      tfw ended up writing my own shitty summoning fanfic  Haha, what a fucking autist!    I used to write mlp fanfiction and I don't really regret it. I still have a few fans that email me and tell me to write more.          mlp fanfiction  Reported      I don't really regret it.   Straight to the camps with you.        That's some great news.    Herald of the Void was a good read   I know nothing about this series apart from that the glasses girl has some great porn.    Shit taste.    I hated this show so much that I ended up loving it. I'm actually excited it's going to be finished.    Did they manage to gather the dragon balls?   I'm so happy that they're going to finish what he couldn't finish himself. I don't even care it it's shit, just knowing that it's finished will be fine.  Why.  Let it die like the cancer it is    Harem ending please  Where can I find the LNs in Japanese   maybe that actually happened and is part of the reason why EMIYA is such an ass   Why is louise the perfect semon demon?    the author died more than 2 years ago  Fuck, it feels like the sticky was only yesterday.     EVEN IN DEATH HE WRITES      Coming soon to a bookstore near you:  I Was A Light Novel Author Who Died Of A Myocardial Infarction Caused By Deep Vein Thrombosis From Sitting Still For Too Long While Writing My Works, But My Editor Who is Also My Younger Sister Resurrected Me To Finish My Most Popular Series.       Has LN names gotten too long?   I want more about the elves and the onee-sans, I don't really care about the rest of characters.   I feel the opposite.     Pretty soon they're going to stop writing the novels entirely and just sell the covers.     TIFFA GETTING KILLED SOON ALL ELFS GETTING BLOWN TO THE MOON WITH FREEDOM NUKES  BASED LN       They may as fucking well, with all the shit that sells based on it's art alone.     What    They should reboot the whole thing.   Pretty sure it has to be because she was a bitchy comic relief girl in season 1 of the anime, but by season 4, she was this clingy walking doormat that would let Saito fuck the maids just to stay around. Pretty drastic changes.  Also, the sexy pin ups help       mfw 5 seasons of well adapted ZnT   5 seasons of Rie   I only wish this and SnS could get a reboot and have more faithful adaptations        NUKES  Wait what? I haven't read this thing that far yet but what?     I'm just too distrustful to belive they want to respect the wish of the authour, I'd bet they only want to scratch some money and probably such notes he "trustued to his editor" doesn't probably exist at all.  I mean do you people read LN do you really belive these authors have notes about everything is going to happen till the end? If they struggle to end one fucking novel in time do you think they have 2 more plannead ahead?      It's certainly a possibility given how much this guy loved the novels. Also the fact that he could die means he must have left something.    Fire stones are big ass magical nukes if used right.    Are you this clueless?  Js06 translated Color Wars on a mere whim by flipping a coin when asking people on /a/ what LN he should translate next in a thread he made one to two years ago.  Among the LN choices posted, he ended up picking up Color Wars.        That's not too bad. IIRC the author of Guin Saga died leaving the series unfinished as well, so they did the same there. The famous Wheel of Life series was also completed after the author's death.    Most don't under normal circumstances, sure. But the series was supposed to be close to being finished, and the author knew he was dying. Those are the sort of circumstances in which they can set the plot in stone, figure out the key details, maybe write the the scenes they feel the most critical, and then when they die there's enough information on what is supposed to happen, and what happens to who, for any halfway competent author to wrap up the series.   I might have to reread the series again since remember jack shit about it, other than fapping an unhealty ammount to Louise   /a/ suddenly likes ZnT  What happened?    Where's Angela? She's voiced by the Rie and a tsundere, she totally counts.    The LN was ridiculously popular. Think mahouka levels.   Dont forget crazy shit like a crossover with sengoku rance.  Light novel series Zero no Tsukaima will be continued after author Noboru Yamaguchi's death. The last volume released was the 20th out of 22 on February 2011.  Before he passed away, Yamaguchi told his editors the remaining plot and ending and entrusted the series to them on his sickbed. His family also desires to see a continuation along with many requests from the fans.  Source: http://blog.esuteru.com/archives/82<wbr>30152.html</wbr>       The maid has fucked off. She and Louise reached an agreement in the LN. Now Louise just needs to shoo off all the other harem orbitors.    I'm pretty sure it was always fairly liked, not that we don't lik to point out it's numerous flaws or anything, b-baka!     LN getting finished  Fuck year. I never dreamed this would happened. My body is ready.  Louise is mai waifu. Please no touch.        More elves   Also can Overlap do the same thing with Infinite Stratos? I know Yumizuru isn't dead, but the series is pretty much dead in the water with him at the helm and literally anyone pulled off the streets could write better than him. The fucker likes using "ちなみに" too much, it's aggravating to read.      Would there be an improvement in the characters personalities?    Let IS die please     Zero no Tsukaima LN Continuation Confirmed   AH FUCK SHIT NIGGA, BEST NEWS OF THE YEAR      Can we have a lewd tread like in the old times?     Let IS die please  But they are doing so great    I hope this gives us more Louise doujins   This nigga knows what's up      Dude what the fuck.    Great quality in the water part    The LN's already killed it and the anime already butchered the source material and characters. What more do you want?   I want to masturbate by rubbing my penis on the soft inner walls of Louise's vagina   For it to stay dead and for its merchandise to stop clogging shelves    Okay, now they're just getting silly. How long before they start lifting stuff straight out of bond movies?   So i heard that the stupid dog dies and becomes a lich.   Does anyone have that lewd image of louise on a couch with the thumbnail magic?   Who NTRietta here?   No magic though    A shit.    /r/ing Rie the Man and Sugita the Bald photo. You must have seen that one.    FUCK OFF    Lovely    NTR queen is pretty fun though    I remember when Spacebattles went member only traffic because of the huge influx of users. Good times.     the author of Guin Saga died leaving the series unfinished as well  She didn't, the main story was finished, the books she was currently writing were side-stories.    Perfection.  Do you guys think we'll get an OVA or something maybe?     Holy shit the author came back to life?  Does MM! still have a chance?      I think they sealed the casket with that last season. They played the 1st season Op and everything.   I don't understand why you guys want Tiffa dead   Queen &gt; Bar Maid &gt; Tifa &gt; siesta &gt; Blue &gt; red &gt; shit &gt; Pink    Because she's fucking garbage, adds nothing to the series and deserves the worst ending possible. I hope Saito takes a gun and shoots her, leaving her alone to bleed to death    So now I guess we need Tanigawa to die so the Haruhi novels can continue.   Tiffa dies  Doesn't she have time powers or some bullshit? Can't she just ZA WARUDO her way out of a shitty situation?  In any case, it should have been different things summoned instead of stacking Saito and Aqua lad. Woudl have been far more interesting and pushed Tabitha's sister off the deep end.       yfw Togashi's death gives new life to HxH     i wish someone translated the LN    So, this ?    She is literally useless meat at this point.   What do you guys think of the "Dragon god thing" ending of the anime?   The entire ending sequence was hilarious to watch. Ended on a good note in that case.    stupid, worst arc of them all, felt rushed, and the fact Saito stole a fighter jet and flew into the eclipse is all just handwaved away. But god damn would I be hyped for a 5th season.    ZnT continues despite having a fitting end.   MM! will never get any sort of completion.      &gt;ZnT continues despite having a fitting end.  When did the LNs ever have an ending?     I have a boner for military tech  Jet vs mythological creatures was fine for me.      Both MM and ZnT's creators died. ZnT at least had an ending through the anime. MM! got a Christmas episode and no ending.    Yeah, the anime is not the LNs   I can't even exactly remember which part I stopped at for the LN.   How far along am I if Saito got a tank?     And neither will this ending be a true ending, but it doesn't seem to matter to most of you.     Zero no Tsukaima LN Continuation Confirmed  Wasn't the author, you know, well death or something?     Read the thread, both the rest of the development and the ending itself were disclosed to the editor by the author himself before he died.    Japan has finally gathered the seven dragon balls.    That's what they want you to believe. We all know who's behind this...    Please, the notion of there being author notes detailing the rest of the story and ending has been around for a long time.    There's really no proof of that being true though. I mean, it could be true, but the reason the shoved out the last season so quickly was to give the author some final closure, wasn't it? He knew he wasn't going to make it.  I think in the end, it's prudent to ask if this is right.      DFCfags    It's the right thing to do, the guy definitely loved the series enough to want it finished even if he passed away.    I don't know if you can say that. It might not be the right thing to do. They may screw it up. They may ruin the artful story he was trying to craft. We're talking about writing an ending here. This can make or break an entire story and cause horrible problems for the future. How many people do you think remember what JRR Tolkien's son wrote?     This Count?  the same VA, Tsun, and japanese boy      Well, I agree with you that it's a risky thing to do. But I will remain cautiously positive about this.  After all, it's more Louise.      Tread carefully, friend. It might not be the Louise you remember.   it may not be the ideal ending but the fans who stuck with the series and the author (and made him rich) deserve closure. he better have left good notes, he had plenty of time to think about it.    Plenty time to think about it while he was struggling with his own mortality in a hospital bed.   top kek, m8. be autastic somewhere else.      hospital bed paid for with the money his fans made him. he had cancer for 2 years, plenty of time to get his shit together.    Literal autism. I don't think I've ever seen someone so self-entitled. I mean, I can understand if I paid him money for an Alpha of a video game that he made promises to make better, but instead went on vacation every week until he sold it to M$, but this guy was literally dying.     mentioning shitcraft    Louise is mine. All mine.   Nah, she's mine.    are you Saito?     Implying she isn't on my bed right now with a vibrating egg in her   Remote in my hand, therefore I am master.   Aren't we all?        It's almost certain he left notes knowing there was a chance he wasn't going to survive his cancer.    actually it wasn't a japanese boy. the dude was like 17 and was a single father    23 years old with a 10 year old daughter.    wait what?    someone post the pic of that game   I remember Seven Seas was going to release the light novels in English, but cancelled the release after the author's passing. Do you think that this might entice them to release them? I'd love a professionally done translation.     True, but the reason this guy didn't write wasn't because he was a lazy piece of shit like most of them.  He was fucking dying.      Why do so many not get that the panties go on after everything else.      I don't understand the way you think, saying that she's yours, not mine. Sending roses and your silly dreams, it's really just a waste of time, because she's mine.      Fetish literature   That's why you're here.   How can she be so perfect?  You know for someone so small and flat, she sure is one of the sexiest anime characters around  Where does all her naughtiness come from?     Well she's a drawing    Le french   FUCK LOUISE   Mah half nigga.   Louise made me discover that I am slightly M   Cow tits are always worst girl you know.     Not having committed the entire series to memory  Come on anon, step it up       No, not everyone is gay like you. Deal with it.    Her dere part was done perfectly.    I wouldn't want her dead, but she's "useless meat" as people would call her. Just there for more fanservice and nothing else. The story tries quite hard to incorporate her into the story, but fails.  She's nice, cute, and nothing really wrong with her. But she feels kind of forced in, which rubs people the wrong way.      Kind of agree. She seemed like a total bitch in season 1, but it was like people in the studio kept hearing people call her a bitch, and kept toning her back more and more, and more, until by season 4 she was literally dressing up for Saito and blubbering over him if they were apart. Not to mention instead of the typical tsundere thing of blaming Saito for the kiss, she went up to the Queen, her best friend, and bitch slapped her.  She really has come a long ways.          What is character development  Animation studio had nothing to do with it. Author just wrote a complete perma PMS bitch at the start and over the course of each volume she got less and less bitchy and actually embraced her feelings for MC instead of still being a bitch and going "i-it's not like I like you or anything, b-baka!" This is how you do Tsundere. Sure she started really out there but that Dere was fucking worth it.        FIRST KISS kara hajimaru futari no koi no HISTORY  This series forever will have a special place in my heart      Yeah but then turned to trash at the end when both Louise and Saito do frequent complete character swaps and ruin their relationship for the sake of drama.    Although not much can be said about saito who only had marginal character improvement. He is still cruel to Louise by not straight out rejecting the other girls.    They had to deal with the harem thing at some point anyways, better than an open ending at least      Now I really can't die.    That was really annoying.   At first, it was kinda a harem, but when the MC choose a girls, it can't be a harem anymore.      The 'dealing with harem thing' should be resolved by Saito telling the two girls that keep trying to seduce him to fuck off because hes in a relationship. Instead he keeps flirting with them, acting like a dunce who doesn't know what hes doing, and meanwhile Louise becoming an emotional wreck over the whole thing. They made it like that because the last season would be boring as fuck if all they did was sit around and have sex between saving the world scenarios.    Go enjoy your distasteful cow tits somewhere else.    This is what ruins harems for me. Really stupid as fuck blue balling for the sake of maintaining status quo no matter how far fetched it would seem just to keep milking the shit out of the premise. Worse are the fucking MCs which never actually have the balls to go full harem, yet still keep leading the other girls on.      Just imagine the last season if it was like that: saving the world and being all lovey-dovey and shit in their free time. It would had been pretty confy   I wish Henrietta would die. Tristania deserves a better queen.    distasteful   The delusion is real. I'm pretty comfortable here, by the way.       Just moved in together with louise   Sleeps with her AND the maid who clearly wants to fuck him   Lets other DFC girl who is the next regent of Gallia who also wants to fuck him live with them   After a fight with louise, finds a secret chamber, and uses a magic mirror that bring louses best friend, the queen, to him and then proceeds to kiss her.   For a second time.  I'm surprised she stays with such a abusive guy.        But at least in other harems the MC is just a self-insert of the author or just an average looking guy with zero personality so the otakus can self-insert, so i can understand that the MC just doesn't choose any girl.  But in this case, he fucking choose a girl, and we know that he's for real, so it was really shitty      I would have loved it, but apparently the author and the main fanbase cant let go of their masochistic urges even to the grave. It really pissed me off watching each episode of that season but I had to see it through.    She isn't a very competent ruler. She frequently runs away, and easily falls to pressure from internal politics. Abuses her best friend for suicidal missions and then attempts to steal her best friends lover.    A lot of times when writing, you write the beginning and the end, and then fill in the middle.  Not all writing gets done in chronological order.        That was my point, anon. Rarely do MCs actually go full harem. The rest just pick a girl but still keep the fucking status quo    so I'm guessing another season in a year? is this any good anyway?    All was somehow alright before Henrietta though, they even shared the bed with the rest of the harem and the maid is close enough to Louise for it to not be a problem, if Henrietta and Saito weren´t so stupid and stopped with the secrets and sneaking and properly talked with Louise about it, it wouldn´t be so disastrous  Still Saito really needs to decide if he is going for a harem or not already if he doesn´t want to continue hurting Louise being so sketchy with the whole situation       Look at her face, it's pure sex   Louise is a perfect merger of the two  I wonder if they will make some ovas later   What a sexual body on the right one thought the one on the left looks like a shrew.     The best tsundeRie is so good that nobody realizes she's a tsundeRie.     She just needs the dick bad and she will be dere as fuck.   Is Louise more femsub or femdom? Does she get turned into Saito's little pet bitch or what?    cylinder next to the figure of a woman   perfect   She got the worst       Well at least with the maid, louise accepted her because they shared the bed. When saito and louise have been married for a few years I bet louise would finally break down and they would have threesomes.  Half-elf knows she has no chance and doesn't try. Tabitha just wants to sleep with the person she loves before she becomes the queen of gallia, but the NTR queen is really just a bitch. Trying to steal your best friends man is straight up evil.      She switches   Damn it!! I love Kugyus   It really depends. She likes to be a dom but if saito pressures her she instantly switches to sub mode. He made her say all sorts of things.   Push the tip in and she goes full sub-dere     Seems kind of annoying to have to deal with a stupid little girl who thinks she can boss you around, but I keep hearing this series is actually excellent and Louis isn't all that bad. I mean, you're obviously it's fans, but what would you say? Does this series have anything to offer someone who only likes strong women so they can be broken?      Hell not even that, kiss her once and her tsun armor falls apart. Like in that episode in one of the earlier seasons when saito is at her mansion and confesses to her in the boat. She became a moeblob for the next 10 minutes and ignored everything.    INFERNO AUTHOR!    She is not as tsun as the anime, and there is actual relationship building.           Trying to steal your best friends man is straight up evil.  It isn´t quite her intention to steal(though close enough), but she needs to stop thoughtlessly relying so much on her friend´s boyfriend without her consent     Holy fuck yes.    Fapped to day   Can't fap to louise  And my next fap is saturday      not being aroused by louise no matter how much you've fapped   Visit a doctor, /a/non, you might have the gay.      I'd take her flat sister. I'm used to girls like her.    I am very strict with my schedules    Suit yourself, I'm on my 4th fap this evening.   Here you deviants. Have some pure porn material https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=s0C<wbr>uyZBaG90</wbr>  [ ]  200% lewd mode https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tbm<wbr>3HmV2eUA</wbr>  [ ]          Wheel of Life  Wheel of time. Funnily enough a better author took over and the last three novels were better than the seven that came before them.    Dumping some louise official art in celebration.            Aren't both her sisters really busty though? If anything she'd end up a short stack       "I really want to live"  I'm so glad they're ending his life work          Bitch nee-san is flat as fuck<br/>          I don't know, it's pretty odd. Saito's pretty unique to LN protagonists in that he actually has SOMETHING resembling a personality and a character, and most of all, a love interest he follows up on.  But since this is still a harem, they have to push everything back to make it work, so it just makes Saito look worse off for it and look like a moron. ZnT's biggest problem is that it tries to balance a harem and a romance at the same time, and toes the line too far in either direction. We can have the characters develop, but not TOO much, or otherwise we can't have the harem elements work anymore.          Someone else other than me watched Dragonar?      Here, sup.  Eco was a very nice Louise clone imo. didn't really like the idiotic real dragon transformation from the end, but I enjoyed the show more than I expected to.          Brownloli masterrace, reporting in. The OP is really nice.       blonde onee-san a best         The ED was better imo  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1<wbr>wvltb_most-ijou-no-mostest-seikoku-<wbr>no-dragonar-ed-full_music   So small   </wbr></wbr>       Honestly? I hate Siesta the most. She really contributes NOTHING to the plot other than harem nonsense. She's literally just there for the sake of being a wedge between Louise and Saito for fanservice's sake. At least with Kirche, it was because Kirche was a shallow hussy and just wanted to have the newest toy to play with. But hey, Kirche changes (a bit) and finds something else in the story to do! With Siesta, she doesn't do shit!  I could see it if they actually went somewhere with Saito and Siesta's relationship like from the start of the series, but they didn't. But because it's a harem series, after everything that's happened between Louise and Saito, Siesta wants in too! And it'd be too mean if Louise just told her to fuck off and go away, so Siesta gets to sleep on the bed instead!  It's too far. It's gone too far between the title characters for Siesta being in there anything other than an obstruction.              Louise a cute     Dragonar Academy   Not Metal Armor Dragonar         underrated post      Yes.    I don't know, the idea of Louise summons X is interesting, but I kind of feel sorry for Saito  He's not that bad as far as harem LN protagonists go. Why is he so easy to replace?      Because he's just your ultra generic MC who's sort of shy, indecisive and will go full hero when the plot demands it. Of course, he's a character that's fleshed out throughout the series, but that's irrelevant for your fanfic      Eco is love as fuck     Those fangs     You'll love the show then   Unless you hate tentacles, then you'll like it a bit less.       Lets not let the thread die    Long story short: siesta and tiffa are pointless  fan service  characters.    should i watch this? never touched it before   Sure, give it a try.  Doki has a HEVC release for the 4 seasons.  It's not everyones cup of tea though, but stick with it, it's worth it.  Normally I would have told you to just watch the anime since the LNs have no ending, but alas this thread proves the LN will have an ending after all.   Still, watch it.           I think you're blaming the wrong thing here. Even if Siesta did not exist, some other cockblock would just replace her. The reason Louise and Saito don't have sex is simply because the editors decided they didn't want them to. Remember that ZnT is probably the most popular light novel ever. A lot of children read it.    best LN in my life thank you based god. thank you. one more reason to live      Remember that ZnT is probably the most popular light novel ever  SAO is more popularer      a lot of children read it  I wouldn't exactly consider the series child friendly. More like a lot of teenagers read it.     Not to mention the anime isn't that bad.    Right now sure but if you look overtime ZnT is by far the most popular. By the way Oregairu is more popular than SAO right now. Regardless ZnT was so popular that Louise has spawned hundreds of clones. In addition a currently popular LN called Blade Dance is a straight rip off of ZnT.     Remember that ZnT is probably the most popular light novel ever. A lot of children read it.   Implying Japan doesn't need to start strongly instilling sex into youth if they want to keep that birthrate from getting any lower.       tfw the author is probably now a spooky skeleton writing the story   Spooky as fuck       I wouldn't exactly consider the series child friendly.  What are you talking about? I've read around 14 volumes and it's a lot more tame than plenty of Jump series.     Claire a cute   &gt;my fucking face when "Buy the LN" end for the anime  No Iroha in the last episode  I hope the movie and OVAs that are sure to come are about Iroha          best LN in my life     A skeleton you say...          Why does the art have so much soul put into it?          GAR    Because that's all the author has left.    Because every one wants to fuck Louise, tripschan.    JC staff took a great series with very good designs and made them perfect, plus they really liked the show themselves and it shows.     plus they really liked the show themselves and it shows.  Isn't it their best selling show ever? Of course they liked it.     Animators definitely don't care about money, otherwise they wouldn't be animators.   So does rie like that her most known roll is louise?   Well, I'm not saying there wouldn't be a cockblock, my issue is that Siesta serves absolutely no purpose for the overall story than to be comedic relief/rehashing the same old jokes and driving a pointless wedge between Saito and Louise.  When Henrietta starts hitting on Saito and eventually makes out with him, it causes drama in the story that's used for various plot points. Shit, Louise runs away because of it in the LN. With Sesita there's no good reason for Louise to put up with any of her shit, and she's not particularly close to Saito at the end of the day, so why do it?        *badumtsihh*    Why are you assuming something horrible, instead of a digital copy uploaded into the internets?         pretty much this. You really must love the craft to actually apply for a job doing it.      With Sesita there's no good reason for Louise to put up with any of her shit  I guess you might have forgotten the time she saved her life and gave her the hope to search for Saito.     That never happened though    Please, no. Just let it die.    faggot    Or maybe you should actually read the novels. If you're seriously going to make me waste my time finding the page for you I'm going to be disappointed.     Maybe someone will continue the work of the author like in Trinity Blood     Seriously. What is it with authors of shitty LNs trying to shoehorn in a love interest that's almost entirely irrelevant and doesn't have a chance?   Did you like the duet version of El Ragna?   Yes. Can't stop listening to it; as well as the Vilkiss theme remixes.    BD 8 cover      Game is out   Volume 8 is announced   No OST4 or OVA coming  We have nothing left to look forward to from this show do we?       It's finally out? L-link please?      Also the manga is cancelled and the second volume of the spinoff manga won't even get a physical release.  At least there's new merch. Maybe we get an ova with Naomi at some point.      Isn't there an empty placeholder in the BD/DVD page? Anyway to the anon with the 7th volume: can you post pics of Ange and Tusk fucking?      It's on nyaa. Somehow the ancient people stole a copy three days before the release date so we got it early this time.   I wanted Embryo's version of the song, was that too much to ask?   This. The only thing I wanted out of this.     They probably didn't even have his VA sing the whole thing, seeing as they were very fond of re-using the "UTAE UTAE" part of the song.     My niggas. At least the next OST has to have it, right?      next OST  Probably not happening.     Will the bonus be only a shitty interview? No drama CD or event footage? The dramas so far were so fucking great, I want more. The second one was lewd as fuck.    Only new stuff will be an interview, an event ticket, and a "director's cut" of episode 22 (probably just showing more of Ange fucking Tusk with no nipples).     Yeah, found it right, should have thought before posting. Do you happen to know the track number for the duet?     I guess you found the flac upload. There's another one from that korean group with tagged files and everything.  But anyways it's the second track.       mfw there is not second track   Fuck, should I get the Korean one then?       What? The second track on the album. Number 2. There are 23 tracks on it. What the fuck did you download?     all we will ever have of his song are the parts he sung in episode 13, and we will have to deal with Ange, Julio, Vivian, Tusk, and Riza talking over him  Fuck.      Yeah, you are right, I downloaded the first one that came up after I searched on 'cross ange', it has all the songs....except the second track.     I don't know what happened. If that's the very first upload of the third OST then it should have the duet. But also if you search the archives there was a mega link in a thread with the same OP image a few days ago.   Damn, Salia would make such a cute wife. I want to marry her.    I have the flac on one, works fine. Thanks for the help.      tfw the promo code is close to expiration  I doubt anyone will buy the game in the future and there's zero discussion of it. Even though it's pretty good. At least a lot better than I expected. My expectations were probably lower than Salia's reputation.      promo code is close to expiration  What promo code? The PsVita theme one? I finally finished Yuuki Yuuna, so I'll begin the game tomorrow. It's great if it's not a shit fest.      Yep.  The VN part feels a bit linear; but it's still pretty good. You don't have many choices and sometimes they don't have any effect, but the touchy minigame if funny and lewd. The action stages are a lot better than I thought. The controls are fluid, the only real issue is that there are not many enemy types. I say it's worth the price if you are a fan of the show.     Fuck, I need to download the theme tomorrow then. Okay, sounds promising, a shame for the VN part though. Oh well, I'll have fun customizing my paramail and with the minigame.      Alektra will never be a cover      Salia's reputation  That of a best girl?      No cover with Yukanas     The VN part is still pretty good, but it seems there are no actual routes, just a single one and you occasionally unlock some extra content like a scene with a certain character alone or a talk battle or a touch minigame. And it fills in the blanks in the story so it's actually very interesting.    where's the larger res of that cover    Hilda is the best cover.    Such a shameless slut. I can't blame Ange for tapping that.    Rosalie was always the top.        Yeah in Street Fighter 9. Not in the bed though.    No. I only wanted to listen to Hocchan's voice.   Why cant Ange share Tusk's penis?    the manga is cancelled and the second volume of the spinoff manga won't even get a physical release   Where was that stated?      Where is it then? Nothing came out since last year.    What about the endings? Any interesting differences between them?     I'm only halfway through because I was busy. Also the Arzenal SoL part is so great it's hard to leave that behind.     but the touchy minigame if funny and lewd  Has anyone posted more screenshots or videos of it?    Is the duet version the one with Embryo or something else?   That of "worse than 3DPD" in the words of the elevens.    ANGE A BOSS    Elevens also like K-ON, so let's not pay too much attention to their opinions.    I hope you motherfuckers are buying that Robot Damashii Villkiss    Is it avaliable anywhere? Or will they open preorders again?    not in the big 3 probably some other site may have it, but it seems that if you didn't preorder, you are fucked    I wanted to see Naga and Kaname´s morning intercourse. ;_;   man, I miss when this show was airing    Are you saying you don't like K-ON? What kind of freak are you?    Ange and Sala duet.    Fuck it. Maybe someone will want to sell it without too much hotglue.    It's inferior to K-ON!!    mandarake may be an option shortly after it is released however, the price may be slightly above the retail one... or drop like a rock if the transformation mode is shit      Is there any videos of it? It's pretty hot when the character gets closer to you and starts moaning and blushing.    THAT was epitome of shit taste, though.  When Lelouch of all people went full edgy wanting her to DIE, I knew that she is best girl for sure.       vlcsnap       I that won't be the case. Not sure I want to buy it, I'd rather get a bunch of T-shirts to show off in public that I'm a norma enabler.    Salia is terrible, deal with it. She started out as top tier girl and then her role as Ange's likeable rival was replaced by Salamandrill. Once she joined Embryo, she became irredeemably shit.    Salia has her flaws, but she isn't worst girl.  I also can't just blindly go the opposite of Lelouch's opinion since that would mean declaring Vivian to be more of a shit than Chris.      Vivian wasn't really a character though. Just Fukuda's red herring.    Her flaws make her a better character.     irredeemable   shit   Because she dared to oppose special snowflake that was the Ange? Because she dared not to die when assaulted by her?  You was already proven wrong. Saliahaters lost. Deal with it.          I want to comfort her and make her smile. I'm close to waifu'ing her.    This is not the first time Lelouch is in opposition to me, and I am certainly not known for having shit taste, unlike somebody.  And I actually feel sorry for Vivian, because she was lovely. But there is always exception to the rule. So I will rather insist that Lelouch is magically right on Vivian, for this once.      Best gril  bump     I liked Melinda more.      So why did she got in the first squad at the age of 12 while Naomi was 14 and got there later? Was she retarded?    Coco was really smart, apparently. She was bad at piloting. Maybe Naomi was discovered at a later age, like Ange.     Or maybe she's a special snowflake like your average VN protagonist. A DRAGON, an artificial human created by Embryo, an ancient human like Tusk, etc.     She was bad at piloting.  Do we even know this? She never even put her Para Mail into Assault mode, and she got hit from behind the moment the singularity opened while Ange was distracting everyone with her escape attempt.  Ange or Salia could have just as easily been killed by that attack.       Same episode. Remember the VR simulator? She could control her paramail with out screaming her head off.    Couldn't*    Y'know, when you think about it, having Coco be a pilot was a bad desision on Jill's part If she's so smart, let her work in the bridge. She'd be better off working tactics then getting herself killed They sent Coco to her death     damn..... I already forgot about cross ange. its only been like a couple months.   Lill wasn't really known for making the best decisions through the show.    No no no no. Jill just did her job: sending rookies to the battlefront, and rookies are fated to fight in the frontlines. Zola, Coco and Miranda only died thanks to Ange's escape attempt.    Being a norma doesn't mean that you inevitably get assigned as a para-mail pilot.    I still don't understand if she was tricking Embryo into lowering his guard so she could capture him or if she genuinely wanted to be with him, abandoning everything.    Jill was a all around shitty commander. Poor Coco and Melanie could have survived a hell of a lot longer if it wasn't for her and retard Ange.    But if she failed most of the qualifications in piloting but aced everything else, she shouldn't even be on the front line. Zola's different. That was all Ange's fault. But Coco and Miranda not only died because of Ange, but because of Jill's bad decision in sending those who don't even qualify piloting a Gund- Para-mail to pilot a bloody para-mail     pity kiss     If you wore a full cover helmet you were basically guaranteed to be fucked. The red shirt of death for this show.     Maybe Coco and Miranda lacked any kind of talent or skill so they were sent to the meat grinder.     thinking Jill's intelligence has anything to do with it  If it wasn't obvious, Jill just plain wasn't a good person. She saw everyone around her as pawns, was willing to resort to tactics like threatening to open the airlock on Momoka, convinced a DRAGON girl to unwittingly commit genocide against her own kind, and probably took pleasure in sending rookies to their deaths.      Hey Jill, these two rookies are pretty smart but they can't pilot for shit. Maybe we should have them work on the bri-   Send them to the front lines   Bu-   THEY'RE SMART THAN ME. SEND THEM TO THE FRONT LINES        It's worse in the game. They sent Naomi out to fight real dragons, alone on her first test flight. No simulators or anything. And when she woke up from coma they told her that she has a 100 million debt for crashing her paramail. Because a random portal opened and a galleon class slapped her shit.    Everyone shits over Ange for not following Jill's plans, but you really can't blame her.    That sounds pretty suspicious. Have you finished the game? I want to know if my theory about Naomi not being human is true or not.     Not to defend Jill but Ange didn't follow her orders because she was so smart and foresaw the issues with Jill's plans.     Sending someone with no experience piloting a Para-mail to fight the Doragons  Now, I know it's been said enough that Jill is a terrible commander.  But Jill is a terrible commander      So do Coco, Miranda and Zola Die in the game as well?    Yes, offscreen.     Our master plan is: let's wait for a RM activation ring to arrive to the island along with someone not only able to use said activation ring but skilled enough to ride a RM. Did I told you how said plan depends entirely of said someone's goodwill? It's not like Embryo has other six machines with the same power under his command.    Jill's libertus was the stupidest plan ever. The ironic thing is, she had the best Para-mail pilot under her nose the whole time (Salia) and said pilot had as much potential to activate the Villkiss with its full power as Ange herself.      Yes, the events of episodes 2 and 3 happen while Naomi is in her coma. All we see of their deaths in the game are anime screenshots.     Sali   Best pilot  Now now hold on, Anon. I think you'd better lay off the booze. You're saying things that don't make sense!       Oh, well there goes any hope I had.     Everybody was pretty stupid in Cross Ange  Man I really want to watch this show again with people      Vivian was probably their best pilot. Unfortunately that wasn't enough to overcome how underpowered the Razor was in mech-on-mech combat when everyone else had Ragnamails and upgraded Arquebuses, so she was completely useless in the second cour.    While the mecha fights were short and inconclusive, you can't deny how Salia dominated all the opponents she fought, opponents using machines as powerful as hers (hell, she even unlocked Ariel, the most broken RM mode), and I talk as an Angefag who doesn't like Salia that much.    Oh, Cocofag. When are you to get over her?    Except for Salamandine. Of the entire cast she made the smartest decisions.          Salia spent most of her life training to become the pilot of Vilkiss, given the chance that Jill changes her mind, and she was one of the top pilots from Zola's squad.  Stop being silly Saliahater, it devalues any attempt for opinion on your side.      And Zola didn't even rape them in the shower. She was very nice to them. And they were best friends with Naomi in the school. I reaaly want to know wha Naomi got there later but my nip is shit.    That's not an excuse. A Paramail can defeat a Ragnamail if the pilot is skilled enough.  Unless the Ragnamail unlocked Ariel or Michael, but no one from the diamond rose knights managed to do that.  The RMs were broken but not undefeatable.       When are you to get over her?  Never.  At least Naomi was kind to them.       The Razor is actually a fast close combat machine, it wasn's useless. The Howitzers in the other hand... And Rosalie still managed to do something.      A Paramail can defeat a Ragnamail if the pilot is skilled enough.  Even Hilda's Arquebus, probably the closest one in specs to a Ragnamail with a pilot at about Salia's skill level, could only fight Chris's Ragnamail to a standstill.     I forgot something. You probably know this and you are not as ignorant as me regarding the Vita but you can only download it on a japanese account. Made me panic a little when I realized this.   I miss the Salia bullying.   The only thing I miss in my life is the Salia hugging and telling her how wonderful of a woman she is.    She makes for a decent waifu.   Remember when they revealed her and did nothing really relevant with her?   I'm so glad she managed to get over her issues and to free herself from Embryo's charm.    That's not true. She was an invaluable ally and without her the normas wouldn't have succeeded.   I miss this show, /a/, it was stupid but so upfront about it that it was fucking glorious.   Ange is gone and we will never see her likes again.     At least your favorite girl survived.    we will never be able to watch an alternate universe version of Cross Ange where Salia was the one to land on Tusk's island    I'd be more than happy with animated Ange Academy or the drama CDs. Or anything with Naomi&amp;Salia OTP.    Without Tusk to provide Ange the emotional stability she needed so much she becomes edgier than Chris, allowing Momoka to be killed, killing Sala and joining Jill's libertus out of pure spite and revenge, abandoning everyone in the island.  Hilda, Ersha, Tanya and Irma join Embryo. Chris and Rosalie join the Aurora.  Salia and Vivian are saved by Tusk, rejoining the Aurora later.  Moved by hatred instead of willpower, Ange is unable to awaken the Villkiss' true power. She ends being captured and brainwashed by Embryo during Jill's suicide Libertus. Without the DRAGON people's help and a soon-to-be-raped Ange serving as a singing beacon they are unable to travel to Embryo's pocket dimension. After a pointless battle where Hilda and co. massacre the Aurora, the worlds merge, everyone dies and Embryo rules forever with his cumdumpster Ange by his side.  Salia and Tusk die together, promising to find each other in the next universe.       I'm so happy that Salia is now mostly remembered fondly.  It wasn't easy defending her during the show.     I still don't understand why she got so much hate. She was one of the most interesting characters along with Ange and Hilda, and her suffering was fun to watch.    People don't like turn coats. Simple as that Look at Chris. Everyone loved Chris. But then she turn coated and everyone hated her.  But she got better so it's fine      You knew she was going be alright in the end. I knew it and it would have been too much of an ass pull to kill her off.   I still don't understand why she got so much hate.   Because fun thing were fun.       A combination of her being a whiny bitch that was almost always fighting against the MC and her then also becoming a traitorous whore.  Personally I thought her character arc was wildly entertaining but surely you can see why she might piss some people off.      How did chris get better? All she did in the end was cry and bitch to Rosalie to forgive her.      traitors  But they had no choice; those five were thrown into a seriously fucked up situation, falling into the hands of a very dangerous and manipulative individual who took advantage of the skeletons inside their closets.  I will never stop thanking Fukuda for sparing the entirety of the first squad.   Shame about the painter girl and the naked apron girl, but their sacrifice was necessary.         Because the best couple got back together Status quo was restored     Justified or not, people dislike traitors.   Fuck I miss discussing this show, the threads were so good for the last of couple months after the shitposters mostly left and the /u/fags fucked off.      People had a hard time understanding that all the traitors were in grave situations, except Ersha. Without Embryo they would have died, then he gave them a world they never experienced before. Salia was the most vocal and Fukuda pushed her hard to be the opposite of Ange so she got a lot of hate. It tells a lot about people who had their fun hating her when she was pure in all her arzenal life, with the most idealistic idea of romance among all the gangbanging degenerates, then became loyal to one single man who fulfilled her desires. Ange did the same except she treated her man like shit and cucked him with other girls but that was okay.    It was the opposite: Rosalie was the one who begged Chris to forgive her.  Chris realized how she had someone who genuinely love her and realized she committed a grave mistake by turning her back to said someone. If she truly falls in love with Rosalie, that's something we will never know, but if the epilogue is an indication, she's fine now.    For some reason almost all the shitposters left around the new year two-week hiatus; maybe they got bored or something.  I find funny how the guy who uses /tv/ reaction images is unable to let his hatred towards CA and its fanbase go; I'm surprised he isn't shitting this thread right now.         Ersha's situation was a grave one too, even when her own life wasn't the one at risk. She was never a soldier; she was just an extremely feminine woman with an strong motherly instinct.  Actually, Ange stopped treating her man like shit after she thought he was dead and she isn't cucking him; that gay kiss was just a pity one she used to calm that person.     Yeah, Ersha might have been killed by remaining soldiers but the others were on the brink of death.   On the other hand Ange almost killed Tusk for crotchdiving and complained to the others which led to some forced behavior correction on the second drama CD and that was after they opened the cafe iirc.      Ahahaha, really? I can't believe I'm saying this, but I feel bad for Tusk. Yeah, they love each other, but seemingly Ange just can't stop being a bitch.     Don't worry, whatever they wanted to do backfired and Tusk's mind ended up in Ange's body. Then TLR things happened and he tasted about everyone's pie until they figured out what happened.    And she still ended up as best girl    I want to fertilize her eggs.    C88 cant come fast enough.   Nana is a miracle of the universe    What a great character    Next week: Back to the swirly-haired pirates!   Enel's an amusing guy, but his fight was unhype as shit.    Enel gets his shit wrecked, starts fighting desperately immediately   Can't use the moves he's perfected, instead resorts to weird gimmicks with a staff   He actually has to get rid of Luffy and run away because he can't finish him   boring beanstalk interlude   Amaru's transformation was meaningless, it only powered up Enel's useless volt attacks           Everything you mentioned just made my dick get harder    Is there a name for this? Making the next pirate king rest on the floor and letting birds poop all over their head? Or is it just a popular bukakke pose?    My nigga    pigeonkakke?   In the end, does this count as yuri or not.   I'm guessing she was wearing a wig.    This spirit Yuuta is more informed than our Yuuta because our Yuuta pretty much explained the entire plot to him.     She uses the face mask     How does that thing even work.    watch that certain episode </blockquote>]
