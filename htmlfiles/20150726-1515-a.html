[ Finally I have found it, my very own sun<br>my   /ai/ idle activities  </br>  <br>Fukuoka has the last boss.</br>  <br>Is this a meme?</br>  <br>Of course not. Mmmm.

GIVE IT BACK TO ME AT ONCE EVEN THOUGH I CAN'T USE IT AND APOLOGIZE IMMEDIATELY FOR STOPPING PEOPLE FROM DYING!   I want to see SoL OVAs of Kazanari Family.  <br>I am pretty sure Chris getting killed would bring about the wrath of a Hibizerker the likes of which the world cannot contain though.</br>  Tsubasa a cute.  <br>Her sense of justice is too self-conceited, though. She's strong and brave but also have trouble acting when things aren't guaranteed to go her way. Even lashed at someone who tried to help her because she felt her right to decide was being taken away. That's arrogance true and through.</br>  <br>Genjuro is Chris's dad, you sick fuck.</br>  Vol 5 Ch. 3's been out for a while, if you didn't know.<br><br> mfw you'll never be as suave as Sebas <br>Why even live?</br></br></br>  <br>It's too big of a shift for me. Of course, that's the consequence of trying to introduce new character when the MC is broken as hell.</br>  So, Touchme is an obvious pun aimed towards his build<br>But since his build required the World Champion class to get the 100% damage mitigation, which was won in a tournament, how could he name his char with a pun from his future?<br><br> &gt;gotta love rename cash item </br></br></br>  So when do I get to this Shalltear is a chair thing? I'm almost done volume 4.  <br>Vol 4</br>  <br>I mean volume 3.</br>  OH MY GOD WHAT THE FUCK<br><br>SLUTSLUTSLUTSLUTSLUTSLUTSLUTSLUTSLU<wbr>TSLUTSLUTSLUT</wbr></br></br>  <br>How can one person be this ashamed about their body?<br><br>He was pretty much trained to be a total bitch, to be fair. And his way of thinking was pretty backward, like thinking that by caving to torture he was a bad person.</br></br></br>  <br>Guess you didn't watch the previous episode then. <br><br>He basically set her ff and it led to her stalking him and going sex crazy.</br></br></br>   Sakura is a slut <br> Saten is a slut <br> Winry is a slut <br> Kotomine is a slut <br>How many times, now?</br></br></br></br>   you will never commit acts of sexual terrorism with your 2D waifu   <br><br><br><br>This show is a sleeper hit, jesus, remind me read more LN's</br></br></br></br>  Read the guide before asking questions: buyfag.moe      <br>L U C K E<br>U<br>C<br>K<br><br>E</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that Shirley? Figma when?</br>  <br> tfw he killed himself months ago thinking it'll never happen </br>  Is Akane that much of an airhead?    <br> Akane and Hana are really similar aren't they. <br>Why do you think siscon like Shu ended up liking Hana in the first place?</br></br>  <br> homosexual overprotective best friends <br>The look suspiciously like /yys/.</br></br>      What does /a/ think of Sword Art Online?  <br><br>Not much more can be said that hasn't already been said about it.</br></br>  <br>It's pretty fucking shit.<br><br><br><br>You people disgust me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck off newfag, if you been on /a/ for longer than a fucking week you would already fucking know</br>  <br><br>at least Naruto had a great series 1. People have been blinded by Shippuden and have forgotten the time when the show was genuine quality. Like the Zabuza arc, Chuunin exams, Neji vs Spider nin, Kimimaro vs Rock Lee/Gaara, etc.<br><br>What does SAO have that compares to any of that?</br></br></br></br>    Who's going to be the most annoying kid born from Darling and the girls?<br><br> Little spiders <br> Little sneks <br> Mermaids <br> Slimes can have kids (?) <br> Horse  <br> Harpies  <br> Dullahan can't have kids? <br><br>As always the playlist.<br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?li<wbr>st=PLaWNUYckT3OPH6k_Ow2FB1CwijLzU3b<wbr>7p<br><br>For the casual faggots or the people who doesn't read the last chapter of the manga   go to prettyanonymus and download the chapter  </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Just realised that Smith's first name is "Black girl"<br>Ass in, "(Wo)Man In Black".</br></br>  <br><br><br>I doubt Rachnera or Arachnaes as a whole have inherited the trait of high-volume offspring from spiders.<br><br>The more large and complex an organism is, the less likely it is to produce mass-litters like that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Such fluffy ears!</br>  <br>Ah, right right. Still admit swarm of spider kids would be cute. But not demon spawn pile big</br>  So, Toei tweeted this shot of Patamon from the new PV that will be shown at Digi on Fest next week. Just one more week Anons.<br><br>http://digimon-adventure.net/<br><br>PV: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CN9<wbr>xpqG1giY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Examon best husbando</br>  <br>nono, not that it has something to do with it, but that we're looking at a similar situation, a squabble between royal nights only this time alphamon is the bad guy instead of omega. I did not mean to imply it would be a crossover, I'm pretty sure everyone involved with x-evo has forgotten about it.</br>  <br>I don't think the other Royal Knights are gonna have a big role here. Yggdrasil doesn't exist in Adventure's continuity.</br>  I will regret asking this, but is there any wargreymon hentai where he fucks the shit out of someone?  <br>Okay why can't they jogress anymore? I forgot the details...</br>  Why doesn't anyone listen to Daiz and his nameing sheme?<br>Why don't scanlator upload the chapters as pdf instead of zip/rar?<br>Why are /ak/-scans so fucking shit?<br>Why can't we purge jaimini's box and fallen angels?<br>Why do more than one group work on Tomo-chan wa Onna no ko!?</br></br></br></br>   TFW don't know any translators  <br><br>There's so much shit I want to work on</br></br>  <br>Learn japanese fag.</br>  <br> tfw able to translate but nowhere near enough time to work on everything I want to </br>  <br> Japanese  <br> Raws are usually in Chinese or Korean  <br><br>Waste of time boss</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> then batch the entire chapter and do other shit? <br><br>You win. I can't be bothered to explain why that is not the correct thing to do. You obviously have no understanding of how raster works or how to use a histogram.</br></br></br></br>  Characters who singlehandedly ruined the anime they appeared in  <br>Spinzaku.</br>  This guy right here, Hyouge Mono was becoming really interesting leading up to Nobunaga's death caused by Hideyoshi and the aftermath with Akechi Mitsuhide but then suddenly all of that is sidelined never mentioned and it becomes about 'muh aesthetics','muh black','muh imperfection'.<br><br>I never got what the fuck he was on about, I'm probably just a pleb who liked the samurai shit more than the aesthetics but it was enjoyable until everyone starts sucking his dick for no apparent reason.</br></br>    No one will disagree.     Character voiced by both KanaHana and Sugita <br><br>How can one show be so based?</br></br>  Gatchaman S2 is going to end up like Dog Days S3.  <br>Yeah, activating his power above ground would probably cause way too many casualties</br>  <br>I think OD is fucked from the time he fought Katze</br>  <br>Nose Bleeding, Honest Ruirui is so Cute<br> Google can do the rest .</br></br>  This VAPE guy has got to be planning some Zero Requiem type shit where he drives everyone further into Rui's ideology, otherwise his actions are just stupid and irrational.  Whats a show like this /a/?  <br>Maybe I wasn't in the right mindset going in but it didn't start to click for me until part way through the first cour. End of the first cour made me realize I was in love with the show and the second cour was amazingly fun and only got better. For me the graph is extremely accurate</br>  <br> Implying  and  aren't samefag </br>  <br>Any answer other than Master of Martial Hearts is wrong</br>  <br> quoting posts in greentext </br>  Gintama  ITT: Anime that only you remember  <br>D'eon, Shoujo Cosette, and Gankutsuou fulfil my Francophile fantasies . Also, that ED.</br>  <br>Oh god I am so glad the age of fantasy shows that are secretly sci fi shows is over. Though now they're sci fi shows pretending to be fantasy shows instead, which is hardly much better.</br>  I'm still not sure why my brain remembers this. I know it's supposed to be terrible but I kinda liked it at the time.  <br>I don't think this show is forgotten, what with all the "This is better than Eva" threads that pop up every once in a while. <br><br>S2 when?</br></br></br>  <br>That is called a column.</br>  Japan did a poll of their most popular web novels. <br><br>#1 - Mushoku Tensei<br>#2 - Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu<br>#3 - Sword Arts Online<br>#4 - Log Horizon<br><br>I don't recognize what #5 to #9 are. Anyone read moon?<br><br>#10 is Kenkyo, Kenjitsu o Motto ni Ikite Orimasu!.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   web novels <br> not shit <br>Pick one.</br></br>  <br><br>Have you two not read Baccano or Durarara? Arifureta and Monster Tamer are not an 'ensemble cast'. Multiple people are sent, yes, but the 'class gets sent to another world' shit is so overdone it isn't even funny.<br><br>I personally like settings where a stupid amount of people get sent, like Monster Tamer or Janitor Hero, except those are rare as hell because muh highschool class. And even in the settings where there's a ton of people from Earth or another world, the author rarely makes a setting worth reading.<br>Like look at how Monster Tamer handled it. What if a bunch of hormone driven, emotionally unstable due to being at the height of puberty highschooler all got sent to unknown world where some get superpowers, and are all told to survive in a stressful goddamn forest full of monsters? They'd probably eventually start killing each other is what I think, like how my middle school history teacher wouldn't shut up about how absolute power corrupts absolutely. And they did.<br><br>And then you have other stories where they all somehow stay true to their Japanese society beliefs of being cattle that kiss-ass to people in superior positions than them or who are simply older.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Otoburi, where the MC reincarnates into an Otome Game villainess.<br><br>At least four other people reincarnate into that world as well. Three other villainesses, and one person reincarnates into the Heroine.<br><br>Well, it isn't exactly reincarnation, perhaps.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not LN but, Cage of Eden.<br> You need to pay attention to sarcasm, anon. </br></br>  <br>Sauce? that sounds pretty rad.</br></blockquote>]
