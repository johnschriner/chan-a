I'd let her rule me anyway.</br>  <br>she would be the perfect queen</br>  <br> tfw you'll never be one of china's subjects </br>  I want to sandwich with suicide-chan and hagu-chan!  <br>Sure...so long as you're not a male.</br>  <br>Chinatsu is a satan</br>  <br>With Yui as her loyal knight, the kingdom has never been safer.</br>  <br>She is beautiful, innocent, kind and just. All would benefit under her leadership.</br>  Does Chitose suck the life out of anyone she kisses?  <br>I want to die.</br>  Do you guys actually like Chintasu or is this some new dank meme I don't understand?  <br>Chinatsu is an angel of love and purity.</br>  <br> 127891713 <br>b-but we can sandwich now that we have three people. are we not good enough?</br></br>  <br>How can you not like Chinatsu?

I love you anon-chan! <br><br> should I give an honorable mention to sandwicchi now too?  </br></br></br>  <br>China is an innocent, she would not hurt a fly.</br>  <br>Why are you stuttering now? We've talked a lot of times</br>  <br>He's embarrassed because you're being such huge faggots.</br>  <br>have we? i'm not good at recognising anybody besides suicide-chan. and i only recognise them because of their ESL status.  is also true</br>  <br>She often hurts Kyouko</br>  <br>kyouko is a tomato. tomatoes are not flies, nor even living things at all.</br>  <br>-cchi is already an honorific, I named him that way in reference to Yunocchi.</br>  <br>Did you fail biology class in high school, anon?</br>  <br>Yeah we have. You're somewhat easy to recognize</br>  I already see where this thread is gonna go.<br> Chinatsu's Brain Problems General <br><br><br>To be fair, it's often the result of the fact that Kyouko's practically molested China a half dozen times, just less dramatically than what happened with Akari.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Chinatsu is a good girl who has no brain problems so there's nothing to talk about.</br>  <br>r-really? how do you recognise me?  we're supposed to be anonymous here. </br>  <br>Most other people aren't such huge faggots.</br>  <br>this is a thread about lesbians.</br>  <br>Is Yuno cuter than the Yuris?</br>  <br> i'm not good at recognising anybody besides suicide-chan <br>I'm pretty easy to recognise thanks to my broken English.</br></br>  <br>Can't Chinatsu be a dank meme AND be truly loved?</br>  <br>But does not mean the male posters have to maintain homoerotic relations among themselves.</br>  <br>Yuno is cuter than anyone else.</br>  <br>Chinatsu can be whatever she wants to be. She's a miracle of the universe.</br>  <br> male <br>Funny joke, anon-chan!</br></br>  <br>Good taste anon<br>It's just that 95% of /a/ has her as a waifu</br></br>  <br>It's not hard to recognize the one person that never capitalizes letters on a new sentence <br><br><br>Heh I always thought our English was alike so I could recognize you about half the times</br></br></br></br>  <br>Epik meme, anon-kun!</br>  <br>Which reminds me that I should really watch HS and YY</br>  <br>i've seen other people type like this though.  Also, I sometimes type properly. </br>  <br>Are there any other cute anime? Only hs and yy do the trick for me.</br>  <br>yuyushiki. kiniro mosaic.</br>  <br>Well there aren't that many people that type like that <br><br><br>I've been wanting to watch NNB as well. Lucky Star is also pretty good</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty partial to KMB and Kiniro Mosiac, but I'm sure all anons have their own strong opinions on this. Cuteness is pretty subjective, after all.</br>  <br>Minami Ke and Sketchbook are great but unfortunately not as popular.<br><br> I don't know why, I loved HS, YY, Sketchbook, Minami Ke, and tons of others SOL, but I just can't bring myself to finish Aria because it bores me. </br></br></br>  <br>Lucky star was the most cancerous shit I've seen. It was like pani poni dash but not fun. NNB is great.<br><br>I'll try yuyushiki and kiniro, thanks anon</br></br></br>  <br>Sketchbook was comfy but lacking something, I don't know<br>Also isn't Minami-Ke famous as hell? I think it has like hundreds of seasons</br></br>  <br>Definitely second Yuyushiki and Kiniro.<br><br>Azumanga Daih is also pretty good if you haven't seen that, less cute, more funny. (Still cute.)<br><br>Non Non Biyori is extremely cute and less funny.</br></br></br></br></br>  Chinatsu is a cute and high tier Yuru.<br><br>Try Gochiusa. Also Yama no Susume.</br></br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br>I don't get it</br>  <br>Get this normie out of here.</br>  <br>She can't stop being amazing.</br>  One day, Chinatsu will realize there's an even better option available to keep her up at night.  <br>Is it me or where all the Yuurus a little more lewd in the older chapters, barring maybe Yui and Akari?</br>  <br>Yurus are never lewd!</br>  <br>Yes they were. Only Ayano is untainted.</br>  <br>She's figure it out soon enough. Her dreams are already trying to send her the message.</br>  <br>Purest purness.</br>  <br>Might have something to do with starting out Yuri Hime S. It had mostly male readers from what I read. But it's the characters have also gone through changes and their personalities are more consistent.</br>  Why did Chinatsu-chan soil both herself and Akari instead of remaining pure for marriage?  <br><br>You know she's masturbating like a maniac behind the scenes though. That's just the vibe I get.</br></br>  <br> You'll never kiss a tiny Akari's head <br> You'll never be a tiny Akari getting a kissu from a bigger Chinasue <br><br>Either way ;~;</br></br></br></br>  <br>Chiina please stop projecting.</br>  <br>Chinatsu would never do something so shameful.</br>  <br>Indeed. They're practically pure as snow now. I can't even remember the last explicitly lewd thing to happen in the recent manga chapters. Even boob-touching seems so pure in YrYr now, my brain didn't even register it.</br>  <br> that casual pat on Himawari's boobs <br>I wish I could do that too.</br></br>  Does Sakurako have any redeeming qualities at all? I don't want to dislike her, but she just seems to be bad at everything.  <br>That's exactly why she's great.</br>  <br>She's a cute vampire who is in love with an oppai monster.</br>  <br><br>She's cute but she's just... dumb.<br><br>Like, Kyouko is actually pretty smart, good at stuff and things, and comes up with fun activities. While Sakurako is just... dumb. <br><br>Surely there's more to her than that she's dumb and that she's tsuntsun for Himawari?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She appreciates Akari-chan.</br>  <br>Akari is so pure, she can unruin them both.</br>    <br><br>Being childish and spoilt at times is endearing, she's also fit and likes Akari.</br></br>  <br>She's a cute.</br>  <br> http://g.e-hentai.org/g/686295/6300<wbr>b27cf3/</wbr> <br>translation - when? -3-</br></br>  <br>This is one of the very few things that I like about her.<br><br> Akari-chaaaaaaan! </br></br></br>   you will never be either of these girls   Hey guise look what I made today!<br>  s/o to the anon who posted the template two threads ago  </br>  <br>She's mischievous and good-hearted.

It's official, China is Satan.</br></br>  <br>yui pun</br>  <br>The play's narration was wonderfully impartial Poor remarkably unremarkable elf.</br>  <br>I think it was mean of the narrator to slander poor innocent Chinatsu like that.</br>    <br>But it must have been the truth. Every nickname the narrator gave were true.<br>Even the show acknowledges Chinatsu as evil.</br></br>  <br><br><br> wanting to look at Akari's penis </br></br></br>  <br>You don't? What are you, lesbian?</br>  <br> penis <br>Uhh what?</br></br>  <br>Why do best characters never smile</br>  Not every nickname was true, because Chinachu's nickname wasn't true. The show only acknowledges that there are mean people who don't want to admit China is a miracle of love and happiness.  <br>That's probably the best episode of S2.</br>  <br><br>I was too distracted by Chinatsu's bestness to quote.</br></br>  Yup  <br> Not the time travel </br>  <br>Does a doujin where Akari does a Mirai Nikki exist?</br>  <br>You're so terrifyingly in denial that I cannot even be mad at you. I love you anon.</br>  <br>No one wants to admit that their best friend is evil, after all.</br>  Who is best sister?<br>I think it's   not Chizuru  </br>  <br>Mari-chan Is best even if she isn't a sister</br>  <br>Hanako, no contest. Chizuru ain't bad, though.</br>  <br>All the sisters are miracles of the universe  especially Kaede  but Nadeshiko is the most miraculous.<br><br>She's full of mysteries.<br><br>How is she so perfect?<br>Who is her girlfriend?<br>How does she share so many genes with Saku-sama?<br>Why is she such a pimp?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Fake sister.</br>  Why don't you create some YY OC anon?<br>It might help keep the threads more lively while we wait for the ova/s3</br>  <br>Draw your lightsabers, nerds.</br>  <br>I drew a Kyouko yesterday.</br>  <br>But I already am, anon.<br>I was going to finish it first, but why not?</br></br>  I drew this terrible Akari one time.  <br> why don't you get up and do something </br>  <br>Don't encourage people to make shitty drawings, anon. You and I both know pretty much no one here is capable of producing stuff worth looking at.</br>  <br>Chizuru is a great character though</br>  <br>Not as great as Chitose, though.</br>  <br>I do vector arts though<br>Currently doing an ayano one<br> too bad I never finished any vectors at all, fuck those eyes </br></br></br>  <br>dubs decide what i draw<br> but no lewd <br><br>also i can't draw but that's not important</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah<br>Greater</br></br>  <br>You're welcome, faggot.</br>  <br>Chinatsu lovingly embracing a crying Kyouko.</br>  <br>I would argue it is Chitose who is not as great as Chizuru</br>  <br>Nadeshiko holding a rifle <br>Pls</br></br>    <br><br>While I extremely disagree with both of your opinions, I respect them.</br></br>  My comment was randomly deleted...  <br>I love you too anon-chan!</br>  <br>But it is, indeed, Chizuru.</br>  <br>which one was it?</br>  <br><br>That was quick.</br></br>  <br> having a fetish for puns </br>  <br>What can a grad student do to create animu OC?</br>  <br>My drawings are fucking amazing. stfu anon.</br>  <br>Probably because caps and !! and ellipses. I don't know, I see much worse offenders.</br>  <br>Colorize and draw outlines of the manga <br>That works and is easy I guess</br></br>  <br>i actually do have a fetish for puns. i become  sexually aroused  when i see and hear an attractive female make a cheesy/corny/campy joke or gesture. it's just so cute...  ufufu </br>  <br>Why did it get deleted and which one</br>  <br>Yui pls stay.</br>  I sometimes put up screencaps that I haven't seen before and they get reused by people later. That counts as OC, right?  <br>Guess everyone has something special about them</br>  <br> screenshot <br> OC <br>Only if they have the same filename.</br></br></br>  <br>Which chapter is this from again?</br>  <br>What kind of bomb is that</br>  <br>At least it contributes to making the "same images every tread" guy a liar, though. R-right?</br>  <br> two s's </br>    <br>Yeah, I posted it once before and everyone thought that's what it said, so I changed the file name to be better.<br><br>Also, that's TWO frames stuck together, so I had to mess around in gimp for a couple whole minutes for that one.</br></br></br>  <br>I loved Himawari in that episode</br>  <br>Himawari is the shit.</br>  <br>progress report</br>  <br>That's actually pretty decent looking.</br>  <br><br>Hehe... it was this one: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127895173 <br>I guess I asked for it. I got super excited and started yelling in the comfy thread. I just think anon's Kyouko is the most awesome thing to come through in a while. So you were right <br><br><br>There are more sqaure chibis! I'm finding them here: http://www.mypapercraft.net/yuru-yu<wbr>ri-yui-funami-graphig/3327/yuru-yur<wbr>i-yui-funami/<br>This is a Yui one to keep Kyouko company.<br>Or you can make a China or Akari from the site.<br>I need to find some stiff paper for printing.<br><br><br><br><br>This is cool!

I didn't even notice. You're a pro.</br>    <br>Nice anon, she's crying blood.</br>  <br>The request does say she'll be hugged by Chinatsu.</br>  <br>From what side should Chiinachi attack?</br>  <br>Left sounds alright, or maybe she hugs her from behind, however you want to do it.</br>  <br>More importantly why is she crying and what's wrong with Kyouko's legs?</br>  <br>She's crying because that's the prompt and what's wrong with her legs is that drawing legs is hard.</br>  <br>That's because I reported it. Please write properly next time.<br><br>And  is the clothes. I don't think I saved a picture of a finished one, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon! So mean.<br><br> I will write properly next time... meany. </br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, /a/ is pretty strict on newfriends.<br><br>If you're gonna play the Akari card, I'll play the Kyouko card.</br></br></br>  <br>From Kyouko'e crotch.</br>  <br>It's so strick on newfriends that I've twice had posts deleted for being helpful to them...</br>  <br>Fuck go back to school and learn how to write properly.</br>  <br> That was probably me too. <br><br>Seriously, though, don't type in caps. Don't abuse punctuations and emoticons. Then you'll do fine.</br></br></br>  <br>Try Hanamayata. It was pretty good</br>    <br>Watch Yuyushiki and go to weekly /yys/ threads.</br>  <br>In retrospect, it wasn't that good. Too much forced drama with poorly done resolution. I think watched it purely because of the OP.</br>   randomly listening to yuru musiv <br> Wabasha, shuyaku akaza Akari desu starts playing  <br> subconscious takes over and plays the Kyouko version  <br><br>I'm sorry Akari  ;_;  </br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks auto correct <br>Watashi* wa shuyaku</br></br>  <br>You're right. I mean pretty good in the way that Hanamayata was the only moe show that did anything for me after seeing YY</br>  <br> Kyouko, Kyouko, futsuu ni dekiru ko Kyouko </br>  Why does Yuru music have to be so catchy?<br>  Save me from this darkness  </br>  <br>Embrace it. Let it become the soundtrack of your life <br><br><br>All that delicious Akari bullying. <br>Yes I have a problem</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not to mention that Tami sounds like an ojousama Kyouko with a bad cold. Shame that most of the main yuru seiyuus don't get big roles outside of Yuru Yuri.</br>  <br>Do you happen to know what ep. and time this took place in?</br>  <br>It was from an interview she did in Japan. The subs are accurate though, I swear.</br>  <br> forced drama </br>  Fuck me, this took WAY more time than it should have.<br><br>I had to hug a pillow for reference.

Proportions are fucking hard, I know.<br><br><br>She still looks bad, fuck. I don't think the "lovingly embracing" part can be done without it looking like rape.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's Chinatsu for you.</br>  <br><br>One way or the other, neither of them is good at the non-rape loving embrace.</br></br>  <br> implying implications </br>  <br> learn to write exactly the same as every other autismal cunt because we cannot handle change </br>  <br> writing proper english is bad <br>What the fuck is wrong with you?</br></br>  <br> actually defending illiteracy </br>  ponst em /u/<br><br>Not post shit in /a/</br></br>  <br>Go away.<br>This thread is for cute yuru's. Just because your thread is dead doesn't mean you can take this one.</br></br>  <br>You're both blowing this way out of proportion. It's a fucking 1-letter typo.</br>  <br>Tried correcting Kyouko's anatomy a bit.</br>  <br>You're the one that brought it up hours after it happened <br><br><br>Kyouko's eyes seem too small.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I'm really not, hence the "both."<br><br>I'm the one who originally made the typo.<br><br>Ignored the first autistic fuck who flipped out over a typo, ignored the second one who flipped out over "change"<br><br>But when people are fighting about defending bad grammar or saving the English language or whatever over a typo, it's time to call you both a pair of cunts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Arm still seems a bit off.</br>  <br>Eh, that one's a bit aggressive, have a cuter boob-chan to even them out.</br>  <br>(It's a trick, she is always the cutest.)</br>    <br>I wouldn't use that arm for comparison, their limbs were so ugly in the OVA.

Muslim jihadis fighting for their moon god and other minorities insurging to protect both themselves and finally claim their country when the government can't do anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh I've heard of it, didn't recognise the abbreviation.</br></br>  <br>The mystery lives on.</br>  <br><br>Well there's not much to be cleared out to be honest.<br>A small village and a salt factory is all there is.<br><br>Our Ruanapur could develope as a city state, people could work in the salt factory and generate income in the beginning.<br>After that we all make money with mercenary stuff...or selling translated doujins through the internet.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If she said she was a lesbian why did she try to seduce him?</br>  <br>we need the horn of africa. if we controlled those shipping lanes, we could all be NEETs and live off of the tarriff.</br>  I'd like to thank this thread for introducing me to Tomo-chan.  <br><br>What if we got the shipping lanes, and made Anons work half days so that the country doesn't go bankrupt and the populations can still watch chinese cartoons?</br></br>   KanaHana <br> Hiroshi Kamiya <br><br>Will the nightmare ever end?</br></br></br>  Daily reminder that Hana is the best girl.  No. Enjoy.  I feel like Namikawa Daisuke is wasted on Jo.<br>Other than that I have no complain.</br>  <br>HanaKana is perfect but Hiroshi Kamiya sounds odd on Kiyoshi</br>  I felt like they captured gakuto over the top reactions pretty well and animated it pretty good, but knowing /a/ they will find something to hate about it.     nightmare <br> KanaHana <br><br>Fuck off, she's a miracle of the universe.</br></br></br>  If it wasn't for the censoring it would be a top tier adaptation.  <br> Not liking crazy kanahana <br>Come on now.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter, show is shit. Monster musume is the far better ecchi this season</br>  <br>This is not an ecchi show<br>Its a comedy</br></br>   fucking everything about Meiko <br> in fact the entire show and premise <br> especially Meiko though holy fuck <br>Why the fuck have I not been reading the manga</br></br></br>   Hiroshi Kamiya <br>Is that an alternate reading of Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, OP?</br>  <br> Hiroshi Kamiya <br>You are literally fucking retarded.</br></br>  <br>But they're perfect choices.</br>  <br>I love how the fatty starts licking her spit on his face</br>  I almost stopped watching at the bathroom scene. Second-hand embarrassment can be too much for me at times.  <br>Your shit taste will never end. Kill yourself now to save yourself the suffering.</br>   Take responsibility, will ya?   God I want to fuck him so hard.   This is a boy's hip   Gay as hell  I love it how he's always sticking out his ass in every shot. Even the promo image. He knows his good parts.  Why does no one like loli-sensei?  <br>This. He fucking knows. <br><br>He's just flaunting it everywhere and teasing everybody. Holy shit.</br></br></br>  pls be be shonen-ai<br><br>pls let him fuk the trap<br><br>PLS JAPAN FOR ONCE GIVE US A TRAP ANIME WHERE THE GUY FUCKS THE TRAP</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's just you. Just saying.</br>  <br>He knew his teacher wanted to fuck</br>  <br>How?</br>  <br>But they did.</br>  <br>And you tell me it's a boy. Them hips goddamn.</br>   Murders!    draw a girl <br> call it a boy </br>  <br> be more sexy than most girls.... </br>  <br> that ass on the right <br>PICKED UP</br></br>  <br>Picking it up for the ass isn't bad decision. This has more little boy ass than good mystery cases.</br>  That fucking BOOTY.  Is it bad that I'm literally just watching this because of how much I want to jack off to Kobayashi?  <br>To be fair, no anime character resembles a human being in the slightest.</br>  <br>Not really, the entire murder case and its revelation were dumb and if that's how this show is going to approach the mystery theme I'm more interested in Kobayashi being crazy and seducing every man.</br>  <br> how can you be so sure? <br> because he was in love with me <br><br>I bet every fucking male in that school wants to take a gander at his boypussy.</br></br></br></br>  They're just faithful to the source material, the original Kobayashi is also described to be a 11-13-year-old boy with face as beautiful as girl's and he crossdresses in the books too. To be clear his face is described to be "shaped like an apple" which refers to round, girly facial features.  <br><br>There is nothing wrong with that.</br></br>  <br>The only thing that reminds me of apples is his ass.<br><br>ASS<br>S<br>S</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I swear, I'm not a faggot. I-I'm not gay.  ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>It's okay it's not gay if it's pedo</br>    <br><br>He's a fucking succubus</br></br>  don't bully  <br><br>The show itself is boring but hot damn i cant wait for the doujins,</br></br>  <br>Are these Japanese genes working?</br>  <br>It's a Sheila</br>  So it seems that my sexual orientation is "women of all kinds and animated boys" <br>Thanks anime</br>  God damn, I want to bury my face in his cute little boy booty so badly.<br><br>I want to spitroast this kinky slut with /a/.</br></br>  <br>There better be some kind of mindbreak/NTR doujins. Kobayashi is practically asking to get that kind of treatment, he's not just some innocent shota but he finds men with sick fetishes appealing.</br>    This is even worse than AssClass, god damn. His slutty personality doesn't make it better either.  <br>Who will you spit roast him with?</br>  <br>Whoever wants to join.</br>  I just finished the first episode, seem interesting enough. Will it keep it up? Why is Kobayashi such a slut?   Anime about mysteries   <br>Who are you quoting?</br>  <br>Probably the only moment he looked like a girl.</br>  <br>Please tell me that's not a guy.</br>  <br>You're kidding, right? Not only are his facial features those of a girl (he even looks girlier than some of the girls in his class) his body is also very feminine with wide hips and narrow shoulders.</br>  <br>He is. Not that I care, I don't have an actual sexual preference, I just like whatever is cute, whether there's a dick or a pussy.</br>  What the name of Anime?  <br>The mystery of Kobyashi's pants.</br>  It's been a while I've seen a show that is this obvious about the homobait, I kind of like it because the MC is a cute little boy so I can encourage megane to fuck him.  <br>Danganronpa: A Game of Lapdance</br>  <br>Please, what the name?</br>  <br>もっと潜みます</br>  <br>Rompe Madres: A Game of Ice and Fire</br>  <br>ha faggot</br>  <br> He is <br>GAYYYYYYYYY</br></br>   I'm not in trouble or anything, so the teacher must want to fuck me   <br>Filename, anon. How stupid are you?</br>  <br>My Love Interest Can't Be This Slutty</br>  Japan calling him slut shota and little demon too. It's just too obvious.  When is Kobayashi going to wear a cute dress?!!!  <br>I'd rather see him in gym bloomers</br>  <br>Well, it turned out to be true.</br>  <br><br>I wouldn't care if I'm gay or not. I like whatever is cute.</br></br>   tfw I think almost everything about this anime is pretty terrible but it's still my most anticipated shows this season because of Kobayashi <br>I can't help it, there's not too often shota MC like this. I'll feel betrayed if it was reverse trap after all.</br>  Picked up     draw a girl <br> call it a boy <br> AOTY <br>Every fucking time.</br></br></br>  <br>Slut shota's best shota</br>  <br>Wouldn't that be an Incubus?</br>  <br>He's draining men's "spirit energy", that's not an incubus</br>    <br>Lil' Honkers is cuter!</br>  <br>I'd honk the entire Honk family, mom included.</br>  <br>No honking lil' Honkers!</br>  <br>what about honkdad, the manliest (and only) man?</br>    Episode soon.<br><br>  Mora best girl  </br></br>  My nigga.  Mora is a BBA, not girl  <br>Why are they seven?</br>   Does Adlet eventually get some pussy?   <br> horse pussy </br>  <br>Fremy best girl.<br><br><br>Go read your shitty wish fulfillment WN anon</br></br></br></br>  <br> The best one <br><br><br>Go fuck yourself, Anon.<br>Can't a guy know some spoilers without you shitting all over him?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't, only in shitty WN do you read a MC getting pussy like that, they are busy fighting kyoma and finding the impostor.</br>  <br>You simply had to answer that he didn't. Instead, you're shitting all over the place with that silly problem of yours. What? MC or any other character can't fuck while fighting against kyomas? Take your stupid ass problems somewhere else.</br>  What a nice start.  <br> Implying anything with romance is WN <br>You are retarded as fuck and should leave right now.</br></br>  <br>Can't help it. Anon doesn't like romance and believes that's exclusive to WN.</br>  Alright when is eye patch coming in so I can fap.  <br>No one among them would be carefree enough to think about fucking, they are more preoccupied by the 7th and there's paranoia, they'd rather be anxious about the fact that the partner could be the 7th in such a situation most of them didn't even know each other.</br>  <br>This episode</br>  Why is Chamo so fucking autistic? What's wrong with this god damn retard?  <br>Anon, like I said. You only had to say no. The discussion about that topic would've ended there. You don't have to give several sentences of explanation.</br>  <br>Sex=/=romance faggot.<br>There are sexual relations in LN too but recently only in shitty wish fulfillment WN do you read characters fucking someone early, without any kind of development most of the time.</br></br>  <br>And you quoted me and posted other questions instead. Does he get some pussy is a typical question for shitty WN.</br>  <br>What other questions did I ask? I only asked if he has a love interest in a different way, yet you're treating this as a serious problem.<br><br>Seems like WN have angered you in someway. I suggest you taking your butthurt somewhere else.</br></br></br>   this thread   <br>He has a love interest, he fucked no one. Having a love interest doesn't mean you have fucked said person, this is very different from "getting some pussy". Yeah, wish fulfillment WN annoy me.</br>  Do they ever explain why saints powers are only given to women?  <br>Anon, what else did you think I meant? I guess wording it that way makes people think it literally meant fucking each other. I apologize for asking that, anon. I won't do it next time because other anons will be triggered like you.</br>  If women get special saint powers, what do guys get? Are they just regular humans who are just good?  <br>I don't believe they did or i missed it.</br>  How long till it airs?  <br>The guys get nothing.</br>    <br>Why does everyone have a glowing outline except the shota?</br>  <br> shota <br>Anon..</br></br>  <br> shota </br>  <br>...</br>  <br> What is the time again? </br>  Is this shit getting subbed?    <br>Worst girl.</br>  <br>I don't know man, in such story where deception and lies run rampant, sex seems fitting the theme.</br>  <br> Six heroes <br> seven member <br><br>So who's the fake? MC or bunny?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Both </br>  <br>bunny and cow</br>  <br>if it's the mc then it's lame because then it means that all that happened was the the bunny used illusions. And then it's all about him proving himself and dealing with low self esteem.<br><br>if it's the bunny or one of the others then it could be a real plot.</br></br></br>  <br>It could just be an element of the setting, with the goddess and all that.</br>  <br>shit taste there anon</br>  Why does Aoi Yuuki always voice best girl?  <br>Since when were you under the impression they are seven?</br>  <br>This. And it is not even over yet.<br> At least one of the 6 genuine heroes is a psycho. </br></br>  <br>What purpose do those iron sights even server?</br>  <br> Adlet is a tricky trickster </br>  <br>it's clear as day it's Hans</br>  Best girl Nuff' Said  <br> Hans <br> not the broest bro in the party </br></br>  15 mins  <br> girl </br>  <br> missing his thrill where he feels TANOSHII whenever they almost died </br>  <br>Hes just got a little pent up battle lust, theres nothing wrong with that.</br>  5 mins<br><br>get in here niggas</br></br>  Livewatch thread<br><br>http://dec.2chan.net/b/res/11981107<wbr>.htm</wbr></br></br>  <br> I was away from /a/ few months so I have no idea where you guy watch stream now. </br>  <br>She can't see shit</br>  <br>douyutv.com/meizhi</br>  what a nigger bunny  Fuck, their journey looks so comfy.  bunyy ass    <br><br>muh dick<br><br>and spoilerfags troll us all that shes worst girl<br>yeah sure</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Are we taking a trip to QUALITYland already?</br></br>  <br> Head on shoulder <br><br>DAMNNNNNNNNNN</br></br></br>    \  <br>Those both look fine.</br>    <br> those laquine hips </br>  <br>She will seem better and better untill you get kicked in the balls with the truth, dont say we didnt warn you.</br>  GOLDOF WHEN<br>O<br>L<br>D<br>O<br>F<br>WHEN</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>sweet baby Jezus</br></br>    <br>Muh hime</br>  2 more heroes on screen, cant wait to see Mora and Hans, fuck loli.<br><br>Ep 2 is the same as ep 1, no rush, which is a plus.</br></br>  <br>It fucking crashed . Fuck it. As soon as muh princess appeared it fucking crashed on me.</br>  <br>Really? 4 of the six strongest people in the world are women? I have a hard time believing that.</br>  <br>I fucking love "muh hime" waifufag knights.</br>  <br>I think it stopped for everyone anon.<br><br> She is one of the 2 traitors <br><br> Once you factor in the traitors, it's an even 3/3 </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You would since saints are like the spellcaster classes of this world.</br>  BANG  <br>Pls no bully</br>  <br><br><br>They should make her use the other eye in the future.</br></br></br>     that disappointed look when she realizes it's not Adlet   How many volumes are they animating?  <br>Probably 2.<br>I might buy the BD if it has some nice goodies.</br></br>  <br><br>Best girl kiiitáaa</br></br>  <br>1</br>  <br>She looks mad. <br><br>Fuckin slut.</br></br></br>  <br>You talk shit about muh hime, m8?</br>  <br>Im defending you, you piece if shit knight.</br>  <br> tfw the comfiness would end with this episode </br>  <br>Shit taste.</br>  <br>Worst boy.</br>  <br>I think that the slowest adaptation in recent years. Everyone thought I would be just your tipical lazily done LN advertisement, but they're doing a good job so far. <br><br>I didn't like first Fremmy scene, though. They kinda missed her "dere" look.</br></br></br>  <br>Her both eye are fine</br>  <br>She never had dere there.</br>  <br>Shit taste. Can't appreciate a knight devoted to his princess?</br>  <br>The translations actually gave her more of a dere look than she should have.</br>  <br>Yeah, but she is aiming with the eye patch on </br>  <br>I want to see fremy drawn by raita.</br>  <br>Best boy</br>  <br>You fucking piece of shit. Learn to say something other than muh hime.</br>  <br> muh_____hime </br>  <br>No, I can't. It's been used too many times. It's stale. I bet he loves her too.</br>  <br>2 at the most. Maybe even just the first one</br>  <br>The cloth might be thin enough so that she can still see through but not allow much light in. Just in case someone tries to blind her via light or dust.</br>  <br>LNfags, spoil me. Besides the princess, who does he have the best relationship with?</br>  <br>Compared to the princess probably everyone.</br>  <br>Yay!</br>  <br> Hans stays a bro and Rolonia is a little sister. He was brainwashed into loving Fremy. </br>  <br>No, you are retarded and acted like an idiot for even going on with your lame tantrum over that anon.<br><br>You are new here or so, since you didn't even got the meaning of what he was asking. Or maybe you are 15 or so.<br><br>And by the way you write, I get to know you don't even read that much of LNs outside the usual translated stuff, since you ignore like 70% or more that have even shittier development than a WN nowadays.<br><br> shitty wish fulfillment WN <br>Yeah, I know the neckbeards like you shitting over everything in this board, every time, so stoop being a faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That outfit looks so stupid.</br>  <br>Adlet.<br><br>You have no reading comprehension anon.</br></br></br>  <br> loving Fremy <br><br>Eh.</br></br></br>  <br>Indeed, she has the worst design out of the girls. Such a shame when she's supposed to be the love interest.</br>  <br>Are you serious?</br>  <br> of all the girls <br>Thats not Rolonia.</br></br>  <br> Worst design <br> Worst <br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>Shes the love interest? Bunny girl was I thought</br>  <br>Seems like first girl doesn't always win. Fucking shame.</br>  You guys realize this is power rangers right?  <br>Good. Adlet is a fag.</br>   Fremy goes full "freedom" <br><br>Vol3, ss2 never ;_;</br></br>  <br>What?</br>  <br><br>I wonder how things would turn out if Adlet didn't leave Bunny's side for Fremy.<br><br>VN when?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bunny in the light and Adlet in the dark, this was the last time the talked as friends.</br>  She is cute, but that bar censor ruins.  <br>They would have met Goldof together and Goldof would have been jelly all the time. Fremy would have been alone for a moment until her encounter with him,   things could have been more complicated or easier depending on the events after he left for the barrier  </br>  <br>No one, he's all muh hime</br>  <br><br>When does she show up?</br></br>  http://anitay.kinja.com/rokka-the-b<wbr>rave-six-flowers-is-aesthetically-a<wbr>-pre-his-1716138185<br><br>Yeah I know, &gt;kinja but this is not a bad comparison.</br></br></wbr></wbr>  Subs are out  <br>Why the fuck is she aiming with her eyepatch eye?<br><br>This bugs the living shit out of me.</br></br></br>  <br> [HorribleSubs] Rokka no Yuusha - 02 [720p].mkv <br>aw yiss</br></br>  <br>1)wrong person<br>2) Adlet was trained by the one knows the most about Kyouma and who was an expert in pratically everything. Expect some brainwashing inserted in Adlet to make it seem like they really brainwashed him.He is not so idiot to really expect a kid to escape from kyouma </br></br>   I will now proceed to pleasure myself with this carrot.   <br>Maybe she could see thru it since the eyepatch is only there to hide her Kyouma eye and the headband with the flower for the horn scar</br>  <br>   So, has he been brainwashed or not?  </br>  <br> Adlet is the one brainwashed, not muh hime aka Goat </br>  Who wants to summarize the LN for me? I can't read that shit it's painful  <br>   His post implies that Atro found out that Tgurneu had brainwashed him. </br>   Rabbit's face when she sees Goldof   <br>Read this<br><br>Picture of Godolf <br>And here he speaks about wrong person<br>Try to fucking read</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chamo best girl.</br>  Doujins when    <br>wait wut?</br>  <br><br>Not soon enough</br></br>  <br> not wanting a knight husbandfu <br><br>Adlet a shit</br></br></br>  <br>2unpopular4porn</br>  <br><br>Dem hips</br></br>  <br>He deserves better. She's toxic for him.</br>  The characters might be CG but I love the scenery.  <br>I thought Mora would be good for him but she has a husbandfu. <br><br><br>Oh well. Forever alone for poor knighty.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Guess who is on the cover of the first novel and manga tank.</br>  <br>Bros before hoes. He should hang out with Hans and loosen up a little.</br>  <br>I thought the new guy was a girl. Why does he cover his tits then?</br>  <br>I also think Atro knew Adlet was brainwashed.<br><br>Question is why leave Adlet alive?</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't it Chamo on the manga?</br>  <br> Use spoilers. And the best weapon against your enemy is the one they think they have full control of. Atro probably put some trap in Adlet like when he gets close to Majin something automatically happens , kinda like Tgurnu did for Fremy </br>  <br>Painful in what way? It's extremely easy to read compared to most trash translations.</br>  <br>Like fuck what they say about Passione and QUALITY as long as the scene layouts stay this good.</br>  <br>You should read better, his 1) was about Goldof, his 2) was about Adlet because someone had confused the two read this Adlet was trained by the one knows the most about Kyouma and who was an expert in pratically everything.   Expect some brainwashing inserted in Adlet to make it seem like they really brainwashed him.He is not so idiot to really expect a kid to escape from kyouma   <br><br>He's implying this </br></br></br>  <br> the two horses chilling in the background <br> "fiends don't attack animals" <br>White horse was a bro. Protected the bunny girl from fiends and didn't afraid of anything.</br></br></br>  <br> picture of Goldof  <br> speaks of Adlet <br>And about the spoilers i know cause i was the one that fucking wrote them.<br>  Picture of Godolf  <br>  And here he speaks about wrong person </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So did the goddess fuck up big time picking these fucking heroes or what? Every single one of them seems to carry huge emotional baggage that somehow fucks up their duty to even be a god damn hero. <br><br>The scary thing is that Hans seems like the most "normal" hero.</br></br></br>  <br><br>A bunny is fine too.</br></br>  <br>She was probably not doing past backgrounds or personality checks. Heck half the heroes are idiots, so a cunning and sly enemy would give them trouble.</br>   Bunny this episode <br>Pretty hnnnnggg  but you're actually telling me this is all an act and she's actually a huge bitch? </br>  Alright, that settles it. Bunny is best girl, no matter what lies the LNfags spout in these threads  <br>The goddess is too busy wearing the flower on her head and running around in cosplay.</br>  <br>Dont fall for her lies anon, shes just trying to ensnare you so the betrayal hurts even more.</br>  <br>Come back and say that when they solved the barrier mystery</br>  <br>What is this traitor crap? Please elaborate.</br>  <br>Too bad</br>  <br>Why would fictional characters betraying each other hurt? That only works on self-inserters. And/or moralfags, depending on the reasons.</br>  <br>I don't want my self-insert to betray Adlet though.</br>  <br> why would I have any emotional attachment to a character <br>gee I dont know.</br></br>  <br>You don't get it, 2) was referring to Adlet so I asked a question, asking if Atro had taken countermeasures. <br><br><br>The main criteria is strength, then the will to fight the Majin. It doesn't matter how fucked up you are as long as you get the job done, some of the ancient heroes were insane too.<br><br>No, it's Fremy.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really, she's genuinely interested in Adlet  until he throws her under the buss. </br>    <br>If you liked both of them then it would even out.</br>  <br> Buss <br>Throws her under the kiss?<br>What? Bus?</br></br></br>   A rabbit eating a carrot <br>So cute.</br>  <br>What a smug looking rabbit.<br><br><br> can slice and peel a carrot in mid-air without looking <br> can't hit a lizard three times the size of a horse <br> telegraphs her shot with slow moving sparkly lights <br>Way to roll a 1.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is trying to score points with the man.</br>  <br>She was merely pretending.</br>  Speeddraw a cute.<br><br>My personal AOTS so far.<br>Makes me want to pick up the Ln/Wn.<br>Are they fully translated?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean he was interested in her until she tried to frame him and have him killed for her pikachu ambitions</br>  Im confused, does she even like Goldoff? She was all "Damn, this nigga again".  People say bunny is a traitor, but I don't want it to be true. Can the anime change this? Adlet and her were looking so cosy this episode and it'd be a shame.  <br><br/></br>  <br>She's tired of Goldof always bowing and scraping. She seems to be the "princess who's annoyed at having no friends/equals" type.</br>  <br>I am with you anon. I refuse to believe she is a bad girl.</br>  <br>Anon...</br>  I cant visit these fucking threads because too many damn spoilers  <br>I bet there isn't even a fiend among the 7.<br>Goddes screwd up and their paranoia makes them kill each other.<br>Evil wins.</br></br></br>  So you're telling me after two episodes of exposition for Bunny, kuudere Infinite-Ryvius-chan swoops in and steals MC by saving dogs and shooting at him?<br><br>Fuck Japan, I'm out.</br></br>  <br>She tries to murder him. Enough though later it's kinda justified when you find out  what he is </br>  <br>Like I get that, she was looking pretty dodgy when Adlet said he knew of the traitors tricks and tactics, she was also fine with leaving people to die. And as your picture shows, she can actually fight really well despite Adlet saying that she new to fighting.<br><br>Nonetheless, I don't want her to be bad anon, there has to be a way. The OTP can't die like this either.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This body is pure sex, can I let my hatesex fantasy go wild or that's too forbiden?<br>  Some people last thread induced me to think that she's almost an Eldritch abomination, I don't want to waste all the effort to no spoil there, can you just confirm me that she keep this body? ;_;  </br></br></br>  <br>Plot twist: they're all fiends or brainwashed and the real heroes are off saving the day.</br>  <br>Nah thats not really the reason why, youll find out the real reason later.</br>  <br>No, there is a fiend, the fiend, among them....</br>  <br>Did she kill her own horse?</br>  <br> spoiler <br>Please go on.</br></br>  <br> only one </br>  <br>Same, does this look like the face of someone who is bad?</br>  <br>The demon god won 700 years ago and now he just sets up fake heroes and plays with them for giggles.<br><br>The Saint was him being bored and sending out a "hero" to drive him back since there was nothing to do after winning.</br></br></br>  <br>More like sacrificed it, if she can sacrifice humans like it's nothing then what's a horse or 2?</br>  <br> can't believe this stupid ass nigga fallin for this shit what a putz </br>  <br>This face, what is trying to convey /a/?</br>  <br>You act all smug now but I bet when you were reading the LN without any prior knowledge you were just as engaged.</br>  <br>Is the face of a whore who sucks kyoma dicks from long time ago, also a fucking bitch who betray her comrades and try to kill evenryone just because she wants to fuck up their job.<br><br>How does it feel knows even her himen is broken?</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br> How does it feel knows even her himen is broken? <br>Okay as long as it was Adlet or if Adlet fixes that later.</br></br>  <br>No, learn jap.</br>  <br><br><br>Too busy fixing Fremy's</br></br></br>  <br>The reveal happens in the prologue of the LN.</br>  <br>Can't see shit, Captain.</br>  <br>only supposed to be 6 heroes, there are 7 marks<br> someone is a fake and an impostor  protip it's  bunny <br><br>also after that  comes one more hero with yet another mark leading to another fake </br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't trust women nigga.</br>  <br>High quality fiend pussy.</br>  <br>Because they are basically synonyms</br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/jtzlafvsmw.web<wbr>m<br> audio version </br></wbr>  <br>If it is bunny why didn't she just kill Aldet at the start?</br>  <br>She's actually a slut?</br>  <br>So there's 8 of them now?<br><br>I got a feeling they will stubble into a room with just niggas hanging from hooks with marks on all of them.</br></br></br>  <br>Those are the best types of girls.</br>  <br>She needed there to be 7 heroes to foster suspicion and drive them to kill each other.</br>  <br><br><br>I better get some monsterxbunny porn before this is all over</br></br></br>  <br>which almost works<br><br><br>there are some hard things to explain about the fake ritual to get a mark though</br></br></br></br>  <br>But she is a Saint. Saints are good people.<br><br><br>What if everything is a misunderstanding and now there are just more heroes?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yep. She fucked the prince of a foreign country for aid.</br>   All this hate on bunny girl <br><br>She may be bad but she's entertaining. I'd get Nashetania over boring sheltered princesses you find everywhere.<br><br>She's obsessed with an idealistic goal and will do anything to get it. I think that's pretty based.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry its was a filthy demon, not Adlet. He actually loves Fremy. <br><br><br>Yes, and a huge one.<br><br><br>I really want that doujin. <br><br><br>Bunny is an impostor, not a saint.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her entertainment value sounds like it reaches maximum.<br><br><br> Goddess tries to make life easier by sending more heroes <br> the all become suspicious and kill each other <br>The goddess gets full points.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>which volume is this in? is it translated?</br>  <br> Yes, and a huge one. <br>Comiket can't come soon enough.</br></br>  <br><br>What the fuck was I even expecting?</br></br>   /a/ says this is bad <br>But my dick says otherwise.</br>   I think i figured out MC s teacher plan. One of the6 original heroes is a psycho that wants to kill the others but for some reason he wont move.Teacher managed to make eeapons of saint blood to kill off even kyouma generals. <br>Rolonia is saint of blood.<br>He teaches both Rolonia and MC ,together. When fighting Rolonia seems a psycho.<br>My guess is that she is going to kill off all the saints in the party and sacrifice them to kill off the majin for good.I still dont understand the need for Adlet though, i dont think he is so idiotic to think a kid managed to get away from Tgurnu himself.</br></br></br>   <br>So the anime will make her good now? Great!</br>  <br>Don't worry, she'll be making a comeback once Fremy blow herself up.</br>  <br>Source : My ass.</br>  I want to fuck a bunny!  <br> He actually loves Fremy. <br>Pretty sure Bunny still has her chances.</br></br>  <br>Rule number one: Always follow your dick.</br>  <br>How lewd.<br><br>Even better if she recited the Saint's legend the whole time.</br></br></br>  <br> has only seen media presented in chronological order </br>  What if the traitor ended up liking the group and wantso to become friends with all of them and now he doesn't want to tell everyone he is the traitor because he is afraid they will hate him?.  <br> Pretty sure Bunny still has her chances. <br>After all that's happened, I'm not so sure anymore.</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure Haruhi is a thing.</br>  <br>None, not at all. Her chances are less than zero, give up.</br>  <br>Who is Rolonia?<br><br> MC first sees the demon god before getting the crest <br>What a mystery, just who cold be the fake one?</br></br></br></br>  <br>If I remember correctly, the 7th has small POVs in the first volumes, and he sounds like a huge dick.</br>  What is Adlet's master is the grandmaster ruseman and Adlet is being strung along?  Wait. If Bunny betrays the group, why doesn't her knight also ditch the group and join her side?  <br>An ugly cowgirl</br>  <br>Not at all, Adlet already knows who is she and what is her goal. Now he wants to kick the shit out of her slutty ass.<br><br>Oh btw, she fucked different persons just to achieve that goal. So she sucks and is a whore.</br></br></br>  <br> drive them to kill each other <br>The reason being?</br></br>  <br> pikachu ambitions <br>wat</br></br>  <br>What a bitch. Its respect.</br>  <br> &gt;MC first sees the demon god before getting the crest <br> What a mystery, just who cold be the fake one? <br><br><br>:)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bunny actually asked him to follow her without any question but Godolf still has too much common sense left to become her mindless tool</br>  <br> she fucked different persons just to achieve that goal. <br>Pretty sure sex is prohibited in light novels.</br></br>  <br>Tgurnu is one of 3 demom generals though.<br> Rolonia is a fat cow(as cjamo calls her while stepping on her head)that was ttained with MC. Will join after bunny makes her escape.She can control blood and uses a 30 meter long whip covered in it.<br>While really shy when fighting she starts calling kyouma really bad names</br> </br></br>  <br> Everyone could just draw that symbole on their body <br>There is no way to make sure which one is real?<br>Fakes should be walking around everywhere.</br></br></br>  <br> Oh btw, she fucked different persons just to achieve that goal. So she sucks and is a whore. <br>Source??</br></br>  <br>vol 5 which you can't read</br>  <br>So then why do people not like him again? Im confused.</br>  What if bunny escaped because she thinks MC is the traitor and can't bring herself to kill him because she loves him?  <br>I read it and it is a lie.</br>   All this bullshit about evil bunny <br> Anons actually believe it </br>  <br>He does.

Is there a restriction on anime's age or something else?  <br> RWBY #7 <br>What?</br></br>  Is this like, the "normalfag anime fan" poll for Japan?  <br> kirito, bellkun <br> saber, asuna, hestia <br>good tastes</br></br></br>  <br> 2 Rin (CG) </br>  <br><br>You can't just put smug pictures in place of actually having a point.</br></br>  <br>Watch me.</br>  <br>Replaced by Kitty Toe.</br>  <br>In japanese anime simply means animation, however in the west anime has come to replace the word japanimation, aka it refers specifically to animation from japan when used in the west.<br>In japan frozen is also considered anime, but i don't think i have to tell you why frozen isn't discussed on /a/, do i?</br></br>  <br> Haruka is the most popular iM@S <br>Oh wow.</br></br>  <br> ban Jesus Yamato from Newtype <br> gets replaced by the second coming of Christ that is Kirito <br> Kira Yamato <br> Ki_______to <br> Kirito <br>Like fucking poetry. Jesus Christ.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Jesus Yamato's off the top ten list. So did the masses find out that he's a self-insert of that hack Mitsuo Fukuda?</br></br>  <br>RWBY has an anime aesthetic, moreso than ATLA or anything by Disney.<br> <br>There's a school setting, people fighting monsters with magic gun-weapons, and one of the main characters is a fucking neko.<br><br>Look, I get that we need this "taboo" that any cartoon made outside of Japan not be considered anime to keep order on the boards, I'm just saying that I find it funny that it shows up in a Japanese list of most popular cartoons.<br><br>No one would mistake Frozen for anime. You couldn't say the same for RWBY with really being in denial.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Year of the Rin they said   <br>You seem to still miss the point.<br>Of course RWBY is considered anime in japan, so is frozen, so is big hero 6, so is fucking scooby doo.<br>Anime literally just means animation in japan, that's why it turns up in a poll about anime in japan. I mean hell "Shaun the Sheep" is almost always showing up as most watched anime in japan. <br>However, in the west, and i don't think i have to remind you that 4chan is a western-based image board, anime as i said has replaced japanimation as a word. RWBY is neither japanimation or by modern western usage of the word, anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't imagine how shit anime would have to become for this to happen.</br>  <br> 4 Conan Edogawa (Detective Conan) <br>What happened?</br></br>  <br>No I got your point completely. I think you might have missed mine.<br><br>My point was not that RWBY is anime, nor that it belongs on this board. My point was that it resembles anime likely more than any other western cartoon, and that I doubt that if you took a random Japanese anime fan who didn't know anything about it and showed them RWBY, that they would assume it was made in the USA.<br><br> Just like many people in the west who didn't pay attention to the credits might assume that it is made in Japan.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Cagalli more popular than Lacus? Really? I thought Destiny took care of that.</br></br>  <br> If Jesus is banend, Kirito when? <br><br>Probably when SAO has been done for awhile. They probably thought Kira constantly topping the polls when his show had been over for a decade was enough.</br></br></br>  <br>Too many filler.</br>  <br><br> 2 Archer <br><br>so close</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is newtype a normie magazine?</br>  <br> Bit Cloud (Zoid Shinseiki Zero) </br>  <br> thinking takeo would be popular <br><br>do you understand how girls work?</br></br></br>  Why does Kirito keep winning? What the hell do Nips see in him?  <br>SAO is more popular than Fate. Deal with it.</br>  <br>A realistic image of what they could be. He doesn't have super powers like any of the other characters and he's really good at vidya. Not too hard for an otaku to do if they're dedicated. It'll be hard getting a top tier wife like Asuna though.</br>  <br>If we play the matching game there are some interesting results:<br>2 - Archer+Rin: Obviously a great match<br><br>1 - Kirito+Saber: Are you my master? I only go solo, sorry.<br>3 - Bell+Asuna: This could work since Asuna isn't Aiz<br>4 - Shiro+Hestia: Oh god, the horror</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> doesn't even have a show this year <br> a superior Kirito in the same chart <br>why does Kirito fucking number 1?</br></br></br>  <br>Shiro &amp; Hestia sounds strange and interesting to be honest.</br>  <br>I think that Anon was probably referring to the fact those results were full of Gundam characters.<br><br> Newtype <br> Gundam <br>Get it?</br></br></br></br></br>  It's shit, right?  <br>it's pretty terrible</br>  Its good if you want to fall asleep  yes  Pretty mediocre overall. I'd give it an 8/10  nope, now that they toned up the yuri it might be interesting  <br>Mediocre is a 4 or 5 not an 8</br>  <br>He probably comes from MAL.</br>  yes, very   criticize clumsy exposition in a previous show <br> do clumsy exposition  <br><br>BRAVO MARUTO</br></br></br>  <br>Its taking its time setting itself up, which means the instant gratification autists will hate it.</br>  The thing that I don't understand is why the new guy is obligated to close the school if all of his past works were "Go to this shitty place and make it profitable"  <br>I don't understand /a/. It's not amazing, but it's not shit. Just seems average to me. I'll keep watching, though, since the premise seems interesting to me and I don't hate any of the characters yet.</br>  It's OK  <br><br>That's what they said about Glasslip.</br></br>  <br>On the other hand, no gratification autists will say it's still setting up, and it will get better soon even by episode 10.</br>  <br>I think he's not meant to close the school, just the A-Tec,\ division, which is basically a money drain. It just seems like his brothers give him shit jobs partially because they enjoy being assholes but also because he apparently seems to be good at doing them. So I guess he's just the company "fixer", getting rid of situations that no one else wants to deal with.</br>  <br>You missed the part where his brother would send him to shitty jobs so that he would look bad when he couldn't fix them.<br><br>Since he was able to fix them and make himself look good, his brother is trying a new approach. Using him as the scapegoat to get rid of A-TEC, which despite its popularity is a money pit.</br></br></br>  <br>Unlike Glasslip, the plot exists and is coherent.<br><br>Like others said this isn't good or bad. A run of the mill show that will probably be forgotten by next season.</br></br></br>  <br>the only thing that annoys me about this situation is that these fuckers insist on making it be a school, even though its so far removed from everything else about it just for the sake of muh genre. its like they feel the need to write in a cover story to get the actual story past the whimpering anime police. <br><br>please just tell a story about commercial space exploration and development. real life now...</br></br></br>  lets talk about Dragon Ball Super and how its going to be "Goku Tales" costarring Beerus, Whis and Vegeta.  <br>Spanish fansubs not translated from English fansubs are almost always guesslations</br>  <br>http://www.ustream.tv/channel/galax<wbr>y9000<br><br>At 8 P.M.

Umaru used to live with their dad until a year or two ago. Their relationship isn't ideal, so the dad hired Alex (Sylphyn's onii-chan) to check up on them. Their mother died a long time ago, so Umaru doesn't remember her and Taihei barely remembers her.<br><br>This is all speculation.</br></br></br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>http://bitlasers.com/djt<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127874<wbr>473/</wbr></br></br></br></br>  Do Japanese dyslexics mix up words like 日本 ans 本日?   try to watch anime for that listening practice <br> force myself to watch Watamote episode 2 <br> I have to stop like six times and episode to read something or do something else <br> realize I really do not like anime at all <br> accpeting myself for who I am  <br><br>The only anime that I became obsessed with was Tonari no Sekikun because it was funny as shit.
