[ When does this show get good?<br>What's your opinion on this, /a/?</br>  <br>Nobody cares about it is that so?</br>  episode 4  ITT god tier manga that deserve anime adaptations.  i am a hero  seizon life  <br>No. What the fuck is everybody's obsession with anime adaptations? Some great manga being turned into a 12 episode, poorly animated, horrible VA cast snoozefest and the manga will always be better? Sakamoto is fine just the way it is.</br>  <br>true bro</br>    <br>Why is everything 12 episodes nowadays? Leads to tons of rushed shit.</br>  <br>trash</br>  It's a shame because the series has actually become fairly good.<br><br> It has been revealed that episode 3 of popular comic turned drama, "Death Note" (Nihon TV), which aired on the 19th, gave a rating of 8.7% (Video Research Ltd.). Episode 1 reached 16.9% (the current highest) and episode 2 only gave 12.3% <br> Main character, "Misa Misa" or Misa Amane's actress, bikini idol, Hinako Sano's (20) portrayal has been attributed to the cause. <br> Netizens scream in chorus, "Busa Busa"! <br>(Translation note: "Busa" is shorthand for "Busaiku" which means, clumsy or bland.)<br>"Misa Misa" was introduced since the drama started. In the original comics, "Misa Misa" is seen as a cute and slender girl, and many Netizens are claiming Hinako Sano is quite the contrary even though she is a bikini idol. In addition, they claim her face simply does not match and thus have started claiming in large numbers, "This isn't Misa Misa, this is Busa Busa!"<br><br>What does /a/ think of it so far?<br><br>http://news.livedoor.com/article/de<wbr>tail/10392805/</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can you post a pic of busabusa?

They have cute girls doing every other NEET hobby, now they just need cute girls rolling dice.</br>  <br>As a teenager, a girl falls in love with a boy who runs with a bad crowd. He does stupid things, but to her, he's perfect - they're absolutely in love, the both of them, head over heels.<br><br>Then he does something really stupid and gets arrested and goes to jail for a long time. The girl doesn't tell him she's gotten pregnant by him, because she doesn't want him to hurt for knowing it.<br><br>The girl becomes a woman, and her daughter grows. Seventeen years later, the boy, now a man, is released from prison. They arrange to meet, because that love has lasted, and because the woman feels so terribly guilty about all the things she never told him.<br><br>He goes to visit the girl - because she's still that girl, in his mind. At her home, the daughter answers the door, as the mother is still out on errands. The daughter is the spitting image of her mother, seventeen years earlier - so perfect that the man looks at her and thinks it's *her*.<br><br>He kisses her, and seventeen years of repressed lust and love come through in the kiss. She's never had sex before - barely even kissed anyone, she's a shy, bookish lass - and as his hands run up her chest and thighs she climaxes right there pressed up against the doorframe.<br><br>She's too shocked at first to protest, and then too dazed by the post-orgasmic glow, and he continues, and she orgasms over and over at his ministrations, and they fuck against the couch, and the kitchen counter, and up against the wall, and finally on her mother's bed, over and over, until the both of them are exhausted and fall asleep cuddled together.<br><br>Then the mother gets home.<br><br> The extra-kinky version would be if the mother doesn't look all that older than her daughter (either from particularly good genetics, or something /tg/-esque like magic or being an elf), and so she and her daughter end up both in the role of 'his girls'. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Betamoto Fagazaki is your ordinary high school boy who just wants to live normal high school life. That means he has no hobbies and no interest in anything, especially girls. He just wants to go to school, listen to teacher, go home, study and sleep. <br> But one day while he is coming back from school a girl falls from the sky on top of our poor, ordinary Betamoto. First she slaps him but then immediately falls in love with him because he asked if she needs help because this is really one special trait, being polite. <br> Betamoto brings girl home and childhood friend (who spends a lot of time in Betamoto house, wakes him up and makes him meals because his parents are working overseas and left their teenage son to live alone) and Betamoto's imouto get jelly in a second. But never mind that, the special girl, childhood friend and imouto despite their big jealousy towards each other still act very friendly and grope each other's boobs when they go to the hot springs. <br> During the next few episodes the class tsundere, the student council president and the tomboy also start to become interested in Betamoto and when asked why they reply: "He is kind." <br> The series end by Betamoto being beta and choosing no one. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No aliens, no transforming mech planes. <br>You say that as though those things would make Ace Combat any weirder than it already is.</br></br>  <br>Is this the new skateboarding lolis?</br>  Just replace every character with a loli.

She only has one friend - a male classmate who on the other hand is secretely in love with her. Her upperclassman is the exact opposite of her, she's beautiful, acts pretty arrogant and almost every boy in school wants her as his gf. Since she knows she's very likely to never get her she doesn't intend to actually approach her, but suffers from her desire every day. One day another mysterious, beautiful girl is transferred to her class, however unlike her love interest she's very kind and she befriends her, however it also happens that she befriends MCs love interest. Now MCs love interest falls in love with MCs new female friend. Now said upperclassman approaches MC and asks her to mediate between her friend and her since she has fallen in love with her friend. MC is so shocked that she agrees. So with this the four start to do stuff together and thus MC and her love interest get to know each other better. Love interest still acts kinda arrogant but it turns out she's not such a bad person. MC suffers all the time from her dilemma of loving her senpai but also having promised to bring her together with her friend. One day her friend asks her why she seems so down lately, and she tells her everything. Now her friend says that she never loved that senpai anyway and that she will help MC get together with her. From here on we get SoL mixed with drama between the girls. In this time, MC slowly starts to realize how nice and good looking her female friend is and starts to fall in love with her instead, without really noticing.  <br> Meguru <br>If we could get an Endo anime, I'd rather they give us Eden.</br></br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br>If you change Oreos for something less crazy you have a decent but generic romcom.</br>  <br>Would watch, great concept that doesn't include shitty tropes.</br>  <br>The Oreos are a thin metaphor for drugs, most romcoms don't roll that way.

She has an idea: why not sell Love Potions? <br><br>Thus with her knowledge of the arcane arts she mass produce her Secret Potion and sells it to girls in her school.<br><br>Soon girls are casting love spells towards boys all over her school turning boys into love zombies that yield to the fetishes of the girls. The remaining boys who are unaffected by the spells are scared shitless and slowly give in to paranoia. MC doesn't give two fucks since she's raking in money. She sits back and enjoy the chaos of girls dominating guys in her school. <br><br>Unfortunately, a sneaky boy attempts to steal a bottle of her love potion at her house but in an attempt to escape, he slipped and spilled the potion all over himself. Now he becomes lovestruck towards MC and tries to woo her everyday, acting like boys in K dramas to get her attention. And she accepts, he thus becomes MC's familiar and they both go on magical adventures in alternate mystical realms while evading the Inquisition which clamps down on magicians who use spells to manipulate and control the minds of others. <br><br>Over the course of the series, the boy slowly becomes aware that his "love" for MC is merely a mere effect of a drug rather than real. Not wanting to disappoint MC, he keeps the ruse up while she slowly falls for him. Eventually, the boy had no choice but to spill the beans on his real feelings as MC confesses to him. Angered by his rejection, MC force feed him more of her love potion, turning him into a love slave once more. This would go on for several times until the boy becomes desensitized to the potion that he turns against MC out of anger and fear, using the knowledge of the arcane arts she taught him and eventually overpowering her. Feeling lustful, he also rapes the MC before killing himself out of guilt and insanity from the constant barrage of MC's love potions that messed up his psyche.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mad scientist gets transported to a magical fantasy world by an experiment gone wrong.<br><br>After seeing the way the people are being treated cruelly by the kingdom, he now sets out to create a tech/magic empire through use of his knowledge of his old world as well as the help of a magic princess who is being hunted down by the kingdom due to her brothers</br></br></br>  <br>Samurai Flamenco Season 2</br>  <br>I need this.

Rather than waking up as a full-grown mage, he gets reincarnated as a newborn baby, retaining the memories of his past life. Before he can even properly move his body, he resolves to never make the same mistakes he made in his first life ever again and instead live a life with no regrets with the new one that was given to him. Because he has the knowledge of a middle-aged man, by the age of two, he has already become a magical prodigy and possesses power unthinkable for anyone his age and even older. Thus begins the chronicles of Rudeus Greyrat, son of swordsman Paul and healer Zenith, as he enters a new world to become the strongest mage known to man, with powers rivaling even the gods themselves.  <br>A Biomega adaptation that isn't a shitty net series like the Blame! adaptation.</br>  Typical shounen nonsense, however it focuses on the daily life of a middle-aged man who lives in one of the cities that constantly ends up leveled due to massive collateral damage from generic shounen fights  <br>I know it's not entirely the same.

Would 52 episodes be enough to cover Xenogears?  Guatemaltec lolis traveling in La bestia across Mexico to brincar la línea t Usa.  <br>A short, skinny, weak but smart freshman in high school is bullied by upper classmates. One bully in particular is a junior student who is a tall, big girl who beats him up and takes his lunch money. This becomes a daily habit until one day she sees him getting bullied by other kids and jumps in to defend him thinking that only she has the right to bully him. Then she gets confused for a few episodes while MC tries to think of a way to thank her.<br><br>She still bullies him, but it's different now, like it's just for show and he can tell. Eventually she opens up to him and he realizes that she has a very shitty home life with an abusive father that abandoned them and a mother that doesn't love her. MC realizes that she's actually a very vulnerable person and that there are different facets to her personality. She stops bullying him after that and instead now defends him against other bullies.<br><br>They eat lunch together and talk every day, sharing their problems mostly and discovering how lonely they both are; MC is also fatherless. Season 1 ends at the end school with girl confessing to him and they start dating on the very last day of the school year.<br><br>Season 2 is them getting closer during summer break just in the first few episodes, but as soon as school starts they run into alot of social boundaries and other problems.

If you like oppai, then it's likely your human object might have giant breasts.<br><br>How the object is chosen is completely random. It could be the priceless family heirloom that you've carried in your pocket since you were born, it could end up being the receipt that you threw out now turned into a loli and asking you if you are her master.<br><br>Generally women end up with male objects and males end up with female objects. This can change however and you might up with a bro instead of a waifu if fate just so happens to be fucky that day.<br><br>The important thing about this however is that the object always desires to be used for their original function, and can in fact do so efficiently. A journal turned human might have super memory to remember everything written on her skin, a gun turned human might be able to precisely and efficiently launch bullets.<br><br>Most people have at least one Human object by the time they reach college.

Basically, there's this detective who's been working a serial killer case for exactly five years. The serial killer has been killing a different person every month since the first murder, and ever since he got put on the case, the detective has been having horrible, surreal nightmares for five years. He shows up to work exactly five years since the murders began, only to be taken off the investigation because he's been working on it too long with no result. <br><br>He gets drunk at work and heads home early in a drunken stupor and passes out, yet again having those horrible nightmares, but this time they're giving him clues as to who the killer is. He sets off on his own to find out who the killer is, all the while being haunted/guided by hallucinations and nightmares, blurring the line between what's real and what isn't, which only intensify as he gets closer and closer to solving the mystery.<br><br> The killer is actually the detective from the future who uses his crime solving skills to create hard to solve crimes, time-traveling to ensure that his past self becomes him. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Ender's Game pretty much IS an anime in book form already.

(T^T)    An anime about a female middle school teacher shotacon and her comedic failures to seduce children who are too pure to understand she's a pervert and the only thing keeping her from commiting a crime, but also enabling her, is another teacher who has unrequited love for her.   seriously writing out a plot <br>These threads used to be one liners, what the fuck.</br>  <br>One night while dreaming of a murder, a detective, our MC wakes up to the phone ringing which is his department asking him to come in to solve a case even though he's supposed to be on holiday. Reluctantly he accepts only because it has a special interest in him. Arriving at the scene is a gruesome sight. Blood is smeared everywhere and there's not a trace of body besides little bits of smashed bone. Inspecting the scene the detective notes that it's similar too other killings by a famed serial killer he has tangled with before, however nobody knows what they look like and there on the wall in victims blood is the message, "Come play with me, onii-chan!". Taking a cigarette and smiling the detective replies with that he's glad that his partner phones him out of bed as this case is just too interesting to go back to sleep</br>  <br>A generic harem plot with stupid MC, but his friend who gets the best girl questions the logic and reasoning for the harem MC is in.

As Supergirl she is Tokyo's #1 celebrity, as the shy Clair Conners she must learn a new language, keep up her grades in school and learn to live a new life in a wonderful but foreign culture. Can Supergirl manage the teenage drama and romance of a normal Japanese high school life, while at the same time unraveling a corporate conspiracy involving everything from kaiju monsters to purse-snatchers?<br><br>Yes, I've dreamed of this for a while. It would have cute white girls (which are everywhere in anime these days) and kaiju, and superheroes, and some great teen romance/drama, what could go wrong? Also a mixture of English and Japanese dialogue, (like in Blood the Last Vampire) that would require the subtitles to be a mixture of English and Kanji making an equal viewing experience for all.

One day you walk through a dark alley and suddenly someone grabs you by the shoulder. You think for a second that it's a friend of yours joking around but when you look at the hand you notice a comedically large red glove. You look at the silent figure who grabbed you and realize it is in fact a clown. The clown's grip tightens on your shoulder and doesn't let go no matter how much you struggle, it is a very strong clown. Suddenly, the clown's hilariously large and colorful pants drop and you notice that he isn't wearing any underwear. his crotch area has makeup identical to his face. The tip of his erect clown penis has a clown nose on it. He forces himself onto you and the clown nose squeaks hilariously each time it rips your anus apart with a violent penetration. The clown is silent during the rape and only occasionally honks his horn into your ear, which leaves a slight ring into your ear. When he's done he just violently turns you around to face him and splashes your face with water from the flower in his breast pocket, then he honks twice and vanishes into the night.

Exploring the vast variety in the hobby as a young starry eyed MC works to impress the world with his modeling skills. Covering all sorts of model topics, from building dioramas, to train modeling, to miniatures and everything else.<br><br>If you want the kids to stay focused, maybe have some bullshit plot about an evil organization panning to use evil magic modeling powers to rebuild the world on a miniature scale for them to control, or modelling competitions for 'battle modeling' or something</br></br>  The world runs on cliches, where anime and manga tropes are the laws of nature. Around every corner is a mysterious exchange student to run into and take you on a wild adventure, every delinquent is actually a super strong warrior, every student council is an army, every school is full of magical girls, ancient heroes in disguise, chosen ones of legend, every old man is a master fighter, evil sorcerers, fiendish organizations and mad scientists are a dime a dozen, and practically every alley is filled with young girls being accosted by thugs, just waiting to be saved. This is the nature of the world, this is normalcy. However, there is one person in this world that does not follow the flow, the one sore thumb. A young lad with a very strange power, even in such a world. He has the "Eyes of Meta", allowing him to view the world for it's truth, every event flag, every character designation, every route and set up, every plot point, it's all in his sight, and with this knowledge he has tried his entire life to avoid being caught up in the madness of such a world. However, a mighty force seems to have focused in on his existence, the author, the god of this world, aims to throw him head first into the main character spot, for the entire world. <br><br> Personally I think it would work better as a manga, since it would be easier to use sight gags later down the line, such as attacking with sound effects, interacting with speech bubbles, and eventually messing with the panel lay out as well, as the MC begins to take advantage of his meta knowledge </br></br>  <br>I would read/watch the shit out of this.</br>  <br>That already exists. It's called Gintama.</br>  I really wished there was more anime where everyone has normal hair colors, the artists are forced to give the characters actual distinction that isn't lazy as fuck and it always looks better for it.  <br>He vows to eventually try and stop the author of the world but   He defeats the author and the world becomes dead and dull and   He becomes the new author to give the world life again  </br>  <br>It would be less of a gag series though, as the Author throws twists and tricks, bending the story of the world to force the MC into the roll of MC, from sending every villain character in the city after him at once, to forcing side characters and party members on him that will end up dragging him into the story even more, to even changing the setting and genre completely on a whim. The fighting would be less about the MC being super strong or using powerful weapons and more about him 'cheating' the world with his knowledge (for example that I thought up, fighting a villain with plot armor that the author has set up to win, so the MC piles up so many death flags on himself that it creates his own set of plot armor, since an author can't kill off a character whose covered in death flags, thats just predictable)<br><br>As the story would develop he would start to see more beyond the first layer, his vision allowing him to even interact with sound effect, art effects, speech and through bubbles, and eventually the panels themselves (such as having 'instant transmission' by jumping from panel to panel or escaping attacks by just stepping into the border)</br></br></br>  I notice that a lot of Japanese animes have an element of things being summoned by kids to do battles. So Marvel Disk Wars, Pokemon, Digimon, Beyblade, Yu Gi Oh, etc. And I notice Japan is lacking in cultural sensitivity. So I invented a new anime idea.<br><br>The anime is called "Trigger Nigger" (トリガーニガー [Torigānigā]), and it is about a Japanese school boy called Luther, who on his 6th birthday gets gifted a G.A.T (Gun of African Teleportation). This revolver like device contains six chambers, each chamber can hold a 'BULIT' (Black Undead Low-calibre Instantaneous Teleporter). These BULITs contain the spirits of black people throughout time and space. They may just be common ones, like Tyrone who lives in Atlanta or Bongani the Zulu. But the powerful ones that the protagonists seek are famous ones like Steve Urkel, DMX, Malcolm X, Precious, Al Jolson, Queen Latifah, Trayvon Martin, Oprah Winfrey, Tupac, Biggie, Benjamin Sisko etc.<br><br>The main arc follows Luther and his friends as Luther tries to become the ultimate Triggermeister. In this it's sort of like Pokemon, with Luther acquiring new BULITs and battling other Triggermeisters. The primary antagonist is Nathaniel Ahmed Alan Charles Paton (also known as NaAcP). His goal is to amass all the BULITs in the world, and trigger them at once, completely destroying mankind with the equivalent of a billion LA Riots all over the world. Luther and his pals will confront NaAcP frequently, as the series progresses.<br><br>The opening theme is New Slaves by Kanye West, but covered by SNSD.<br>The closing theme is Missing You by Sean "Puff Daddy" Combs.<br><br>Anyway, any ideas for how I could tweak it? Any suggestions to improve it? I reckon it could be the best shonen anime, as it mixes the great music of hip hop, with fascinating black culture, and with the always popular 'monster battler' format of show.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  An anime about a guy in school who's not a beta faggot.  <br>Still sounds like anime Deadpool to me.</br>  Fairytail.  <br>Only on a larger scale.

Y/N this is important</br>  <br>i would watch it</br>  <br>Holy shit. This is golden. I love it. Include the concept of a "nigga moment" in there somehow maybe? Lazy / bitch-ass niggas are like duds right? Where do you find BULITs? And how does a battle work? The powerful ultra giga-niggas are all famous but not nessesarily good fighters. Do they have powerful special attacks or something then? <br><br><br>I want to see Urkel in a fight against Oprah Winfrey really badly now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's enough anime about nothing as it is.</br>  Medieval Japanese black comedy (similar in tone to something like Seinfeld or It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia where the characters can't evil, but they're flawed human beings/assholes) with a style like those Japanese paintings that look like pre-made reaction images (pic related).  <br> characters can't evil <br>AREN'T evil.

During the fight, time seemed like it slowed down for her, and she somehow managed to kill the assassination squad all by herself. Her other squadmembers are unreachable and seemed to be attacked as well, so she sets out to find them in the sprawling megatropolis of Neo Cybercisco. <br>This serum also seems to have certain side-effects, as the MC starts to hallucinate often, and starts suffering from insomnia.

He's had the ability since birth and has never revealed it to anyone. It's completely automatic...if he's near someone he automatically knows everything that they are thinking. <br><br>Because of this, he comes off as a seemingly perfect person. He knows the answers to anything someone asks of him. Perfect grades and he's the most popular guy in school simply because he always knows what to say. <br><br>However, he's become depressed. He begins to resent the rest of the world because of his ability. He knows every sick, horrible thought that enters anyone else's mind. Because he knows exactly how someone will react to anything he says, human interaction feels empty. He lacks the courage to be honest with most people because he automatically latches on to what he knows they want him to do. <br><br>Eventually, however, he meets a girl. The girl is insane. She suffers from every mental condition imaginable. She's a bipolar, schizophrenic, obsessive-compulsive, paranoid-delusional nutcase. However, because of the bizarre way her brain works, he finds that he's completely unable to decipher her thoughts. <br><br>He is faced with the first person he actually feels that he can honestly interact with and eventually falls in love. <br><br>The theme of the anime will revolve around the importance of trust in relationships and being able to appreciate the difficulties that come with it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what</br>  An action hentai. <br><br>The plot revolves around power levels and a gigantic worldwide tournament akin to DBZ or Yu Yu Hakusho...but instead of trying to knock people out of the ring or something, the object is to make your opponent orgasm first.</br></br>  <br>How about a simple boke, tsukomi act between Cirno and Dyson fan?

Kancolle is only about the money there is hardly any heart in it. They put a few references here and there just to make the stupid fans more loyal and real in more $, But its not like strike witches where everything is a reference AND a tribute to real heroes. Kancolle has virtually no honor embedded in it which would actually mean more than you think considering how both SW and KC are set in WW2 where combat was centered around honor. Think about that for a sec please.  <br>The shit ones.</br>  <br><br>You'd think that someone would fall for your shitty bait. Think before you post, retard.</br></br>  <br>But I like both.</br>    <br>Someone will actually bite this shit for real.</br>  <br>enjoy your reply<br> Reply </br></br>  <br>I really wanna sock smugbono in the face</br>  <br>1/10, I replied. Apply yourself.</br>  <br>That's no bueno.</br>  <br>Amen</br>  <br>What? Its seriously not bait dude I have a point you have to admit.<br><br><br>okay so you like it even though you know how it copied everything from SW it stole the concept just to make money. Theres as much honor in that as there is in double-crossing which is what you are actually doing by supporting both. <br><br><br>its not bait dude okay seriously i dont know why everyone is calling it bait. Im just a strike witch fan in a kancolle thread speaking my mind,</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nagato/Musashi <br>More like Kongou</br></br>  <br>Zuikaku or Shoukaku on both, probably, since her engine is more powerful than Yamato's.</br>  <br>Is it shiptoasting time?</br>  <br>Nagato</br>  <br>You're not trying hard enough, seriously. Are you this bitter that your SW threads have always been dead and pure circlejerk that you have to shitpost here?</br>    <br>shut the fuck up dude your are so fucking annoying its like you say the same shit over and over again in every thread</br>  <br>Kaga would lose to Zuikaku, Zuikaku has more horse power to back her up. She's stronger and faster than Kaga.</br>  <br> combat about honor <br> killing all jews <br> japs killing themselves <br> nanking <br> nukes </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yesyesyesyes</br>  <br>What does Bismarck's sweat taste like?</br>  <br>Yeah man, SW invented the mecha musume genre. Totally, there's nothing wrong with this logic.</br>  <br> Mogami-class has more HP than Yamato-class <br>damn</br></br>  <br> both SW and KC are set in WW2 <br> Kancolle <br> taking place in WW2 <br> most of the ships are from WW1 and inter-war period </br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;killing all jews <br>If we had known about the world they were going to create, maybe the rest of us wouldn't have stopped Hitler...</br></br>  <br>Strength does not equal to Power though</br>  <br> KC are set in WW2 <br>This is next level bait. You can't even get a basic fact about the series right.</br></br>  <br>Fumikane seems to be fine with making boatbucks off boatshit anyhow.</br>  <br/>  <br><br> small c </br></br>  <br>no im not bitter im just speaking my mind <br><br><br>dude okay im talking about sorties in air combat compared to in ships. in ships yeah you pretty much know whats gunna happen its either you see an enemy ship and you shoot everything you have at him and one sinks first or you dont see him at all . In air combat you never know what you will have to do to complete your mission. You can get jumped by like 20 enemies from above, or you can jump another enemy and every plane is different handling and speed. You might get his but still survive only to be shot down by flak later like the possibilities are endless so you need nerves of steel to be a pilot. but what does it take to be a ship commander? common sense? basically yes.</br></br></br></br>  <br> pow·er <br> ˈpou(ə)r/ <br> noun <br> noun: power; plural noun: powers <br> 3. physical strength and force exerted by something or someone. <br><br> strength <br> streNG(k)TH/Submit <br> noun <br> 1. the quality or state of being strong, in particular. <br> physical power and energy. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone doesn't know shit about naval warfare.</br>  <br>He chose the perfect time to bait. I never see any moderation of this time of day.</br>  <br>That still has nothing to do with honor. <br>The jap pilots always killed themselves like fucking idiots tho.</br></br>  <br>The same could be said for most of us.</br>  <br>I think he means the ol' Knight of the Skies Air Force thing over the European theatre.<br><br>Which actually fucked up the Germans in World War I because said knights would immediately go and fight other fighters instead of taking down the entente artillery spotters that mattered on the ground.</br></br></br>  <br>At least most of us would know what to do in a night battle between a DD and a BB.</br>  <br>T-torpedo cut-in setup and star shell?</br>  <br>Yes, get within range and unleash torpedoes.</br>  <br>Hold hands and rub our bare feet against each other's feet for snuggling purposes?</br>  <br>Who's the worse protagonist: Mamoru or Bucky?</br>  <br>In either one, I use my radar to detect- oh wait, Japanese ships don't have radar. Guess it's time to turn on my searchlights or attack individually and hope for the best :^)</br>  <br>I want Corea to fuck off. I'm glad the abyss sunk the peninsula in the Vita.</br>  <br>Psst, there was no "honor" to air combat. Most kills occur when the one who was shot down had no idea the the one who shot them down was even there.</br>  <br>yeah exactly thats what i mean basically<br><br><br>also dude ur knowledge comes from an anime (that copied another anime) which i actually find that funny that you think you know more than me.<br><br>Well actually the thing is that SW at least teaches you more about how it actually was in ww2 air combat because its purely a direct alternate reality. But Kancolle started from a game so in order to set their gameplay mechanics they tweaked it to make it fun losing the realism element. and this is translated to the anime as well which is apparently where you get your knowledge from. In review which is more accurate, info an arcade mmo money-grab game? or A direct alternate reality of ww2.<br><br><br>they are both good characters actually.<br><br><br>thats just not true i mean u cant just sneak up to someone, escpecially not a trained pilot with good eyes and when its clear day and no clouds out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I like Kaga but feel bad because I'm a lanklet and probably wouldn't be able to pick her up in bed. If stand side by side she's thicker than me.  I can be your sister ship for tonight.  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/824563/87c36a<wbr>cf52/</wbr></br>  Cutest CV, followed by Taihou.  <br>I know that feel, anon. It doesn't help that my two boatfus (pic related) are both BBs and probably a lot stronger than me.</br>  <br> lanklet <br>Don't worry about that, living with Kaga will make you fat in no time.</br></br>  <br> more than one dude <br>Disgusting</br></br>  <br>Kaga is super cute</br>  <br>Did the artist forget to draw in the first pages or what?</br>  i am looking for a sad doujin that admiral tries to marry kongou but it doesn't ends well  <br> still not knowing kancolle takes place in moder times <br>Bait harder.</br></br>  Which Kamo would you kamo?  <br> swinging <br>I am disgusted</br></br>  <br>I'd kamo both of their faces.</br>  <br> SW at least teaches <br>SW teaches you nothing but planelegs with superpowers win war and shameless pantsu fanservice. In KC, you get an armada of ships in your arsenal: from CV, DD, SS, etc. unlike SW which Witches are the only ones who can fight Neuroi effectively. Also, please use your fucking caps and punctuation next time, retard.</br></br>  <br> Has the artist improved at all ever since he done these? </br>  <br>Be a man worthy of Kaga</br>  <br>Atago looks insane</br>  <br>You can't really blame Izuki Tazuku.</br>  <br>Yeah that craze eyes</br>  <br>You do know these ships had multiple admirals right? Swinging comes natural to them.</br>    <br>And this.</br>  <br>What kind of man is worthy of Kaga?</br>  <br><br> Those 2 with their imoutos never. <br><br>I hope the artist could grant my wish.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>i wanna to make takao and atago mothers.</br></br>  <br>There's something really wrong about Takao's torso here.<br><br>Same with Atago here.<br><br>This one looks really good, I guess torsos are really hard for him, otherwise they look really good, but Im worried that they are losing meat over time, not bueno.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I want Takao back.</br>  <br>The Arpeggio one is from when the anime was airing, they stopped being fat for that long you just don't know because they don't have a kai 2.</br>    <br>A strong man that will protect her from danger like me.</br>  <br>Why is he a holding a daki when she's right beside him</br>  What do you guys think about the adaptation so far, 3 girls introduced and now Suu, 2 chapters per episode (even if the studio probably is going to skip something) and is probably the best animation compared to other shows in this season full of awful QUALITY like Rokka.<br><br>To me is a solid 9/10, at least for now.<br><br>Youtube playlist, (there is another one with subs but isn't complete).<br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?li<wbr>st=PLaWNUYckT3OPH6k_Ow2FB1CwijLzU3b<wbr>7p</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  Whats up with all this shitting on Miia?<br><br>She's a cute</br></br>  <br> leg man <br> not leg fetish <br>Seven seas got this one right.<br><br><br>What sort of life does this man lead?

Does he have a car or use the train and just keep his hands in his pockets to keep his pants up? <br><br><br>This man must live a terrible life.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not enough Papi fanservice.</br>  <br>They know she is endgame</br>  <br>Like Hell she is.</br>  <br> Goes to fancy exotic foreign restaurant. <br> I can has cheezburger? <br><br>American Cheeseburgers *are* exotic in Japan.<br><br> What chapter did this happen again? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to fuck papi-chan  <br>Because of first girl syndrome.</br>  <br>Can you elaborate that idea?</br>  <br> that one scene <br>Which one scene? She had a lot of scenes.<br> The last one with that guy who unfroze her? </br></br></br>  <br>Shitty personality. Most of the time she's annoying, jealous and clingy. And when she isn't she's just deredere with nothing else to make her character interesting.</br>  <br>Is she really a Chunni if she actually has the power to manipulate death is is part of the reason Darling is still alive?</br>  <br>I want to fuck Centorea's  breast  pussy.</br>  <br> The one in the batcave where Terry swallows a a whole lot of ooze <br> I'm not even into vore </br></br>  <br>She openly admits she isn't the reason Darling's alive. He's just too determined to die.</br>   What do you guys think about the adaptation so far <br><br>It's alright. Not mindblowing, not totally shit. The source material isn't stellar but both the manga and anime are enjoyable, which is more than can be said for other shit this season.</br></br>  Cerea is my girl of choice.  <br>Then why did she travel to save him at the hotsprings when the Yuki froze him solid? <br><br>She didn't even travel up with them and then appears when Darling's life is in danger.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not AOTY or anything  and I'm actually enjoying Shimoneta a little more than it  but it's fun and pretty cute, and so are the threads.</br>  <br><br> 2 chapters per episode <br><br>This won't necessarily hold true for every episode.<br><br>There are several chapters I doubt could economically be compressed down to 11 minutes.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why doesn't she just ask Rachnee to custom make her a silk bra? Isn't spider silk stronger than thousand-folded Japanese katanas?</br>  <br>I think this is part mistranslation and part author ambiguity. She has something to do with it.</br>  <br><br>First Girl Syndrome<br><br>Not only do they want to root for the underdogs, but rooting for the underdogs is hopeless because we're getting a Snek End regardless.<br><br>That translates to a bunch of jealous shitting on best girl,  even though most of the other girls are pretty good. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She is waiting patiently for him.</br></br>  <br>I don't think she saved him. I think she just showed up because he was on the brink of death again.</br>  <br>I want to  love  Centorea's everything.</br>  <br> because we're getting a Snek End regardless <br>The Miiafag tears will be delicious.</br></br>  <br> first girl always wins <br> niggas be hatin' </br></br>  <br>It's a decent cheap adaptation of a meme-tier manga. I sure hope they add 500 more monmusu who no one cares about because god forbid anything happens other than fanservice.</br>  Number wan  <br>God, I hope Suu doesn't try something like that. There's a thin line between fetishistic and nightmarish.</br>  <br><br>Darling a best. Monmusu get rek.</br></br>  <br>What are these shorts? Did they come in the episodes?</br>  <br><br>That's not even vore. It's force-feeding.<br><br> And it's an underrated as fuck fetish in the S&amp;M category, and perfect for Slime-Girlslike Inque or Suu. <br> Personally, I totally wouldn't mind being held in place by Suu while she gives me a nice full meal of her excess slime, whether I wanted it or not. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Bike Cop will never get a Wolf-Girl partner. <br> They will never go on walkies <br> She will never get headrubs <br> He will never get alerted to her position by awooo~ </br></br></br></br></br>  S M I T H<br>M<br>I<br>T<br>H</br></br></br></br>  I'm enjoying it a lot thus far. But If they don't animate gif relayted or show Miia in one of Snake's outfits I will be salty for a very long time.  <br> tfw Miiafag <br> tfw want a harem end </br></br>  <br><br> Seriously believing Darling, or any of the girls that actually care about Darling, would stand for that. <br><br>It won't happen.<br><br>Darling is to much of an upstanding man to treat women like personal stock for his enjoyment. He's interested in what would be a traditional relationship.<br>The only girls that would POSSIBLY be up for this would be Suu and Papi (who are too retarded to understand what a real relationship is anyway), and POSSIBLY Rachnera since she's a slut anyway. Cera and especially Miia wouldn't stand for this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The main problem about "what is the best of the season" is how people judge every show, for example most of the people who likes Monmusume are going to say "AOTS" or "10/10" even if is a well done adaptation or not. On the other hand you have the casuals saying "it's ok" and the people who doesn't like it spouting "I-Is shit!".<br><br>There are some points to know how an adaptation is AOTS or at least a 10/10:<br><br>-Quality of the animation<br>-Follow the main source or change it a lot <br>-VA's work<br>-OP and ED<br>-It is friendly with new people? explain the main argument? the characters are likeable? <br><br>If we take these points Monmusume is really good, if Lerche keeps the hard work probably this adaptation is going to be a really good candidate for AOTS. Even stalker points shows how Japan likes it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw no buddy cop shenanigans <br> she will never wag her tail when they catch a criminal <br> they will never fall in love <br> they will never uncover a huge underground crime ring </br></br></br></br>  <br>You wouldn't need to be near someone to met them in the afterlife unless your implying that Lala is able to stalk Darling at all times.</br>  <br><br> She will never nuzzle her head against his neck <br> He will never get awoken to her laying on his bed, leg lightly kicking <br> They will never become the heroes the city deserves <br> Bike Cop will never beat Darling to the punch and marry Wolf-Girl, removing the impetus on Darling to marry a girl. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does this do it for you, Anon?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=UpN<wbr>R9d-2Ed4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Being forcefed slime from a slime girl is my biggest fetish, especially if you can feel the slime moving around inside you as she is controlling it </br>  <br>Isn't that basically how she met him in the first place? And how Dullans are depicted in their myths and lore? If Daring wants to truly get rid of Lala he has to offer her gold.</br>  <br> tfw when flip flopping between her and miia <br><br>Both are adorable and both my top two monster girls</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I think they did a good job on Cerea, they really caught her cute side good.   I want to do all sorts of naughty things to her even more now.  </br></br></br>  <br>She'd only be able to get away with it for so long especially since Ms Smith is already pissed at her for what she was trying to pull. <br><br>The big thing is if she had pale white skin she might be able to get away with being out in public, but since the blue skin is canon now, She sticks out like a sore thumb.</br></br></br>  There was horse version wasn't there?  <br>Stop being a retard and read the fucking OP.</br>  <br><br>the cutest <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Bk4<wbr>bcPoaKNo</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br><br>the cutest</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes and it was perfect in every way.</br>  <br>Why would I make my own webm when someone else has it already</br>  <br><br><br><br> Set up a chapter where Suu begins to feel like she needs not just be helpful in a practical sense but also in a nurturing sense for her Master to be a real marriage partner. <br> Darling comes in from mowing the lawn and makes an offhanded remark about being thirsty. <br> Suu dive-tackles him and holds him down, happily pouring her excess mass down his throat and into his stomach till he matches the physique of a full-term pregnant woman. <br> From that day on Darling could never walk by a dessert-plate of Jell-O without having a PTSD flashback. <br><br>Now I feel bad for imagining it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that all the girls are great in their own ways and fighting about who is best is pointless.  <br><br> especially if you can feel the slime moving around inside you as she is controlling it <br><br>That's OK for force-feeding, but unnecessary.<br>That aspect works better if it's a Slime-Girl giving you  a slime-enema .</br></br></br></br></br>   you will never be stuck with an icy-hearte, mean spirited Raptor girl due to the exchange program and slowly learn to love her as she learns to love you in turn, until eventually, one day, you get married <br><br>Why?<br>h<br>y<br>?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh anon, how could you completely miss the point about Darling's character and the harem setting? It's not about his personal enjoyment, it's about making everyone happy.<br><br>Darling literally conquers death every single day just for that purpose, as you can see in . He's not a caliph who wants to collect girls to be his concubines, he's fucking monster girl Jesus, coming back from the dead to redeem all of them with his huge and generous  heart. <br><br>Honestly, I'm surprised there are still people like you who don't get what MonMusu is all about. You'd rather shit on the other girls calling them retards or sluts when those are precisely the girls that already understand their situation. Miia has a long way until she realizes she's not the only one who loves him and that he'd never do anything that could make even one of them sad.</br></br></br></br></br>  all girls are best girls  <br><br> She will never learn to trust you enough that, one day, she asks if you could put a hood on her and take her out hunting. </br></br>  <br><br> Cera with her hair down <br><br>I'm Grand Wizard of the Horse Pussy Haters club, but DAMN would I even love to sit behind her and bury my face in that golden silk cascade.<br><br>10/10 hair, second only to  __Miia__ , because  nothing can ever beat red as far as hair-color goes. .</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What kind of garbage I'm reading right now.</br>  <br>But she has no presence.</br>  <br><br> you will never have to deal with a tsundere <br><br>Thank God.

All it takes is Cerea, Mero and, in particular, Miia, to be developed and there won't be a single person miserable in that house.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Slimes likely don't have the same psychological need for parental validation that other species have.<br>I doubt she'd feel bad about it.</br></br></br>  <br> the girls play part to become her replacement mother <br>   Lala does it the best </br></br>  <br> fellow red hair lover <br>red is the color of heaven</br></br>  <br>Discussing fetishes is fine, sitting there narrating your own personal fanfiction fantasy is Tumblr-tier and cringeworthy as fuck.</br>  <br> mfw there's 5 large girls and only 1 small girl for lewdness <br>Not very balanced at all.</br></br>  <br><br> Wanting your husband to not be fucking other women. <br> "egocentric" <br><br>When did Muslims start posting on this board?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Suu can be any size you want, why are you counting her as large?</br>  <br>I am shamed</br>  <br><br>Because that's 100% new to Monmusu-threads, huh?</br></br>  <br>Because she turns into big form whenever she does lewd things to Darling. So she's large.</br>  <br>Red haired girls are always sluts. Blue hair shows that they're refined.</br>  Which set of fluffy ears would you  gently nibble on?   <br>Great rebuttal. I'm counting the seconds until you start ranting about cuckolding.</br>  <br>Isn't that Kuudere?</br>  <br><br>There's not much to stimulate that wouldn't be painful from WITHIN the stomach, aside from some satisfying sloshing.<br><br>From the other end though, a Slime has plenty of things to work her magic on, namely the single most heavenly prostate-massage in the history of the planet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What are you talking about?

Either way I want a belly full of slime.</br> </br></br>  As an adaptation, it's as good of one the manga could hope for, but it's still a fairly mediocre harem that's only above others of its kind by the novelty of monster girls.  <br>The worst Miiafags are just as aggressive and delusionnal as any of the other fags besides papi and suufags who aren't</br>  <br>Are you implying lamias are muslims? Because they are totally okay with their husband fucking other lamias.<br><br>Ironically, Miia was seen by some readers as a prude among her village, but she only comes out as a selfish lamia compared to the rest of her species, if not immature. Darling's harem is actually God's punishment for her egocentrism.</br></br></br>  <br>That could we said about any waifufag in this thread, Anon.</br>  <br>And that's why red haired girls are sluts. Blue hair, on the other hand, is calmer, and therefore more refined.</br>  <br>The loli miko obviously.</br>  <br>Huh. Your last paragraph sorta describes Raven from Teen Titans, who is normally classed under KD. Aloof, slowly warming up to others. Oddly enough, a lot like Rach, even down to having multiple red eyes.</br>  <br>Sorry to disappoint you, Anon, but I'm not a Miiafag.</br>  <br><br>But I want to have sex with those too.</br></br>  <br>I'm a Papi fag but I know my place. This is not a series where a DFC fag should start a war against more favored girls.</br>  <br>I know in MGQ lore lamias are very possessive and territorial like regular snakes are, but I guess they do have giant orgies too.</br>    <br> Raptor girls would be way smarter than dumb-ass harpies like Papi, right? <br><br>Barely.<br><br>It's just Raptors have significantly more willpower and charisma, so they're *still* dumb, they just mask it with an air of mysteriousness and strong words.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tfw nobody else appreciates Rachnee <br><br>She has a tough exterior but a lot of integrity and care. I like her characterization even if I'm not much of a spider-fag.<br><br>I dunno how people can pick a favourite out of the current cast. They all offer something unique and appealing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It would be loving and tender sex, compared to the wild sex with the other kind of girl.<br> Not that there's anything bad at all about wild sex. </br></br>  <br>I think you might need a dictionary. If they are all married to him there's no adultery and they can't be called cucks. <br><br>Also, it's hilarious how you love to talk about it but always misspell the word.<br><br> how healthy emotional relationships work <br>Certainly not on jealousy and possessiveness.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> prude among her village  <br><br>Even tho her mom tells her she understands</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, in fact if I had to say<br>Cereafag are mostly not even revealing they are cereafag because of the "MLP, FILTHY HORSE PUSSY"<br>It can be said the same for Merofags with the "hurr Cuck" <br>Suufags are mostly saying "SUU BEST" and that's all<br>Papifag just compete with Poltfag to know who got the best butt<br>Rachnefag are the same as Suufag with more render<br>Miiafag, nah they basically have to humiliate other to make themselves feels good, it's probably caused by a single thing though, people who discovered the serie, saw her first and wants to fit in and follow the bad exemple.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>all the girls are great  besides lala  some girls just appeal to some anons more than other girls</br>  <br> Even tho her mom tells her she understands <br>I said some readers understood that, not her village.</br></br>  <br> Raptor are smart retards </br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Why are you all saying such things about the most American monmusu out there?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> If they are all married to him there's no adultery and they can't be called cucks. <br><br>Just because you call it "polygammy" that doesn't stop it from basically being an institutionalized form of cuckolding.<br><br> it's hilarious how you love to talk about it but always misspell the word. <br>Apparently you're the one that needs a dictionary, faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Bike Cop will never get a Wolf-Girl partner. <br>He is only of the brothers of the original doujin protagonists.

He saved Papi from broken bones(possibly even fatal falling), as well as getting deported(tied with punching the yankis for Miia). He saved Cerea from a (unknown at the time, but blunt) sword strike. He saved Suu from falling into the river, as well as caught a cold getting her in from the rain. He saved Mero from a lamppost, as well as from Suu. He put up with Rach's near-death experiences, and as with Papi, was willing to break the law for her sake. So yeah, Miia might have some reasons to love him, but to claim that the others fell for him at the same speed diminishes the fact that they had far stronger reasons to do so.</br>  <br>The best thing about it is that she doesn't know she's already the best.</br>  <br>http://monstergirlencyclopedia.wiki<wbr>a.com/wiki/Matango<br>Yeah any world where monster girls like this exist is a bad one.</br></wbr></br>    <br>At least someone else here understands it.</br>  <br>miia an absolute BEST</br>  <br> Yes. </br>  <br> He saved Cerea from a (unknown at the time, but blunt) sword strike. <br>Jesus, seeing her dere side come out after darling attempted to apologize for riding her.

Not the entire relationship.<br><br>Holy shit the fucking autism around here.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was directly stated that her room smells like that.

Was there a specific time or do you just mean because he cleans everything?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Mero tries to play vidya <br> Controller starts slipping out her hands every 30 seconds <br> Has to play turn-based games <br> Papi tries to play against her <br> Can't do any kind of planning because bird brain <br> &gt;Mero "accidentally" runs her wheelchair over Papi's talons<br> They're stuck in the floorboards now <br> Papi can't take 3 steps  <br> Finally a worthy opponent </br></br></br> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Still would love her shes is too pure  Lala a shit. She doesnt even seem like part of the harem and the auto win when darling dies shit is annoying  <br>If Papi were hypothetically crippled, would her brain never reset?</br>  <br>I mean he directly mentioned cleaning the room before. At least I think he did.</br>  <br>If Suu can hold a Wiimote, I don't see why Mero can't.</br>  <br><br>No. <br><br>Because Papi can't be crippled. She'd just were an  exosuuit </br></br></br></br>  <br>She'd become the next Stephen Hawking.</br>  <br>She'll be fine, just so long as she wears the wrist strap.</br>  <br> tfw you will never play Wii with them </br>  <br>/v/ here just to say Darling has a shit console.<br>PC monster race</br></br>  <br>Which he also did for everyone else. Except in the other cases, he sacrificed a lot more. To claim that Miia falling for him as fast as she did is somehow MORE justifiable than any other girl falling for him just as quickly is laughable at best, delusional otherwise.</br>  <br>FUCKING<br>D I S G U S T I N G</br></br>  <br>I'll take your word for it. Still, if she let it drop at any time or place, I'd have expected the other girls to criticize her for it.</br>    <br> next Stephen Hawking. <br>Not even kinda sorta. She might become as smart as a regular person.</br></br>  <br> no doujin where darling gets a whiff of the incense and brutality rapes Miia and beats her senseless while she pleads "darling...darling..." each one with less heart then the last as she inches closer and closer to unconsciousness. <br> it'd be so bad it'd require the [Ryona] tag <br> it's finally over, Darling leaves the warehouse <br> Miia's mom is there for her when she wakes up <br>   I guess you misjudged him, huh? this stuff only works on men who hate lamias. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>for the two adaptations I was waiting for this season and Since I'm still fucking mad how jitsu wa is getting adapted, this is a pretty good adaptation  I'm okay with the shedskinning episode being an ova </br>  <br>It's worth noting too, Papi and Suu didn't really fall for him right off the bat like Miia. Suu barely even had a personality when she first showed up, and developed around Darling and was influenced by the other girls who cared for him.<br><br>And Papi actually has a very clear arc in her feelings for Husband, which develop and grow a lot throughout the series.</br></br></br>  <br>Wont the shedding be in the EP Tuesday ?</br>  <br>I couldn't think of any crippled people whose names are synonymous with regular intelligence and is a bird name.</br>  I swear every time this MM posts come up, the section is always pretty fairly divided into talking about each of the girls. A bunch of posts for Merofags, a bunch of posts for Snekfags, a bunch of posts for slimefags. Damn if the centaurfag don't put up a convincing counterargument though.   Plenty of Anons insist that Miia doesn't have a cloaca, just pussy. <br> We've seen Miia bare from behind before. <br> No butthole. <br> That must mean... <br><br>Miia shits from her pussy. MIIA SHITS FROM HER PUSSYYYYYYYY!<br><br>At least Cerea's feces don't come out from her horse pussy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So who would win in a 2v2 battle? Papi No-Reset mode wearing ExoSuuit or Lala riding Cerea Headless Horseman mode?</br>    <br>Anime Miia has an asscrack</br>  <br>She might be smarter than Steven Seagull?</br>  <br>Maybe from the tip of her tail?</br>  Read the guide before asking questions<br>buyfag.moe</br>  <br>This is the first non shitpost thread.</br>    <br>Sorry I had to make another thread since the pochaco one was terrible.</br>  Dear baby Jesus  <br>Can't wait for this figure, insta pre-order for me.</br>  <br>Fuck meant to quote OP.<br/></br>  <br><br>But you used an equally ugly figure to start the OP with.</br></br>  <br> baby jesus </br>  So last week I got my GSC Wonfest orders in.<br><br>If people didn't know, for Wonfest they ship them all to America and then a company in LA distributes it.<br><br>In exchange shipping is "free" above 10k.<br><br>Well the shipping is quite shitty.

It had Starry in it and the three girls were idols in Akiba.</br>  <br>soruce?</br>  <br>Found it<br>https://www.mangaupdates.com/series<wbr>.html?id=120211</wbr></br></br>  <br> In the gateverse it all took was some humane treatment to win over most of the gatepeople. <br>On the other hand, it made a peace treaty 100% harder. The Empire ended up mistaken Japan's desire for peace as a sign that the JSDF has major weaknesses. Because they don't understand why an army with such advantages don't just sack the Capital. Thus most assumed Japan is bluffing.</br></br>  <br>Well all it takes is just taking some high ranking people to show what Japan is like to convince them they're strong but desire peace. And they did exactly that.</br>  <br>That's actually really funny.</br>  <br> Because they don't understand why an army with such advantages don't just sack the Capital <br> tens of thousands of troops die in completely one-sided battles, with absolutely nothing to show for it <br> WE'RE OBVIOUSLY WINNING GUYS. LET'S GO IN FOR THE KILL. </br></br></br>  <br> &gt;tens of thousands of troops die in completely one-sided battles, with absolutely nothing to show for it <br>The point is the Capital is unharmed. It makes no sense, to them, that an invincible army would AVOID conflict. So the conclusion is that the JSDF has some unknown weakness and that is why they want a peace treaty so badly.</br></br>  <br>Just to elaborate, in the ancient world you sign peace treaties if you are exhausted and don't see any chance of defeating your foe. You don't start talking peace unless you worry about not being able to win. The Romans simply suffered from cultural clash and misunderstood what the JSDF was doing.</br>  I've been wondering, how do they power lights in the capital? A generator out the back would create too much noise and constantly shipping in charged batteries would take a lot of effort.  <br>If it's not generators, powerline directly from the base ?</br>  <br>Is my absurd attraction to Kuri soley based on the fact that she sort of resembles Lili from DanMachi even though Kuri's already a better character?</br>  <br>Solar panels are a thing together with car batteries.</br>  <br><br>Just imagine how GATE would've played out if the Gate opened up in Showa-era Japan (Pre-WWII). There'd be a fuck-ton of raping, pillaging, torturing, executing, etc. Shit'd be brutal.</br></br>  <br>Well at least it would mean Japan wouldn't be involved in WWII, and they'd have a chance to rape and pillage some other world instead, for a while.</br>  <br> Just imagine how GATE would've played out if the Gate opened up in Showa-era Japan (Pre-WWII). There'd be a fuck-ton of raping, pillaging, torturing, executing, etc. Shit'd be brutal. <br>Err... That's normal for the Empire, so nothing they don't already do.</br></br>  <br> Imperial Japan conquers a whole fucking world and enjoys untold amounts of resources and is ultimately able to conquer most of Asia, as the US would never be attacked due to them being able to find an untapped oil reserve in the not-Rome. </br>  <br>I mean the Japanese would rape and murder everyone they come across. The Empire would be shitting itself scared instead.</br>  <br> and is ultimately able to conquer most of Asia <br>Why would they even do that? Why take China when the Empire is weaker and bigger?</br></br>  <br>Or America in the 60s seeing how barbaric our soldiers were in Vietnam. <br>Or Korea in that era seeing how brutal they were in Nam as well.</br></br>  <br> I mean the Japanese would rape and murder everyone they come across. The Empire would be shitting itself scared instead. <br>Err... THE EMPIRE DOES THAT TOO.<br>That is NORMAL to them. You must be confused, the Empire has no problem with torture, rape or murder by soldiers.

We don't start caring until American casualty either.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no close up on the girls  <br><br>pffft</br></br></br>  <br>Basically this most first world countries don't give a fuck what you do with your own citizens as long as you don't injure theirs.</br>  <br>How many months did it take from Book 1 to Book 5? 3 months passed in Book 1 so I know that much.</br>  <br>The politics is honestly the goofiest part, is it as bad in the manga?</br>  Why is she best girl anons?<br><br> I like Pina a lot too, and booze </br></br>  <br> Read the manga. </br>  Is anyone working on the novel? That's honestly the only part I care about.  <br>Persia is the best girl because she's comfy as a cat. If your waifu can't purr then she's not the best.</br>  <br>purrsia is pretty good too</br>  <br>She's not as furry in the LN, so she probably won't be that furry in the anime either.</br>  <br>Persia is a qt, but dangerously cheesy.</br>  <br>The past season was about PROCREATE propaganda. All make sense now</br>  I think Pinya is beautiful and I want to make gentle passionate love to her with our hands entwined in the missionary position as she leg locks me  <br>Mr bones anime has nmore gore than GATE. See episode 3</br>  <br>Mr bones anime also has more self insert bullshit in it. See all episodes</br>  <br>I think loli Pinya is better.</br>  <br>I used to think her Anime design was better cause it's cute, but her manga design is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</br>  <br>At least Overlord will no featuring too much fanservice instead the plot.</br>  <br>Yeah, but the manga is pretty good, so you can simply pay no mind to those few moments of "dinndu nothin'" and "everyone else is shady".</br>  <br> naked alBEDo <br> shallchair resurrection <br> lizard sex <br>three fanservice scenes right off the bat that i can think of</br></br></br></br>  <br>They weren't wrong. The JSDF hidden weakness is that they're not actually a real army, just glorified national guard, and there are major superpowers breathing down their necks.</br>  <br>Yea, anime design is cute but her manga design makes me Iron Hard.</br>  <br>The things I'd do to her<br><br>She'd be the happiest princess in history</br></br></br>  <br>I prefer the blonde knight woman with the drills.</br>  <br>Booze is nice too.<br><br>Booze and Pinya are both top quality wife material.</br></br></br>  <br> But you're not me <br> Literally everything I do makes her cum </br></br>  <br>I read all of the manga last night.<br> OH MY GOD, Only America has black agents! <br>I lost my shit with laughter, purely at how fucking retarded it was.<br>Those few chapters were by far the worst. "Oh no we didn't know the Japanese were well armed!"<br>"We lost over half the CIA's far eastern branch in one attack!"<br><br>The instant that one guy started talking about how his plan for defeating Japan was to find a country behind the gate stronger than it is also dangerous territory and better not lead to even more excessively dumb scenes or I don't think I'll be able to stomach it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly most of the Empire girls seem to be best girl material, except traitorous whores like Panache.  </br>  <br> The instant that one guy started talking about how his plan for defeating Japan was to find a country behind the gate stronger than it is also dangerous territory and better not lead to even more excessively dumb scenes or I don't think I'll be able to stomach it. <br>And this is a horribly constructed sentence, but my point rather is that I get the impression the author is going to skirt dangerously close to full retard.</br></br>  <br> that cuddle puddle at the picnic party after Itami "apologizes" to her </br>  <br>This pretty much<br><br>Most of the girls in Gate are top tier material and would make perfect wives.<br><br>They're all built to breed as well.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> https://www.mangaupdates.com/serie<wbr>s.html?id=120211</wbr> <br>Couldn't help but imagine Darth Vader's heavy/asthmatic breathing</br></br>  <br> They're all built to breed as well. <br> Rory <br> Lelei <br>Those are not childbearing hips nor baby feeding breasts.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Rory <br> Those are not childbearing hips nor baby feeding breasts. <br>I-it hurts.</br></br></br>  What kind of demihuman is Mizari?<br><br>A Harpy?</br></br>  She's my type of girl to be honest  <br>An angel.

This girl will grow.</br>  <br>nephilim</br>  <br><br>I just realized that they get suits in the manga as well.</br></br>  <br>I figured. It was between that or 'Murica.<br><br>At least China I can buy more, because China's force projection is garbage.<br><br>I was more concerned it was going to be America deciding to invade Japan and get repelled by superior Japanese training or something.</br></br></br></br></br>  How could you not want to impregnate this?  <br> panache <br> FUCK THAT WHORE </br></br>  <br>I'd call dibs on anything brown</br>  <br>I want it to be popular so I can get a figma of Lelei.</br>  <br>C'mon man, can I at least get the tan you hate?</br>  <br>Lelei's anime design is the only thing the anime improved on</br>  <br>Worth 2000 yen?<br><br>Better wait for a Kuribayashi figma.  It's worth 35 yen </br></br></br>  <br>We'll line them up and pick and choose like a game of kickball.</br>  <br>America wouldn't invade outright, they'd create a crisis by manufacturing Imperial testimony of Japanese human rights abuses and have the CIA instigate Japanese protests and grassroots movements against further Japanese occupation of the gate. Then once the protests turn violent they can move in to "keep the peace" and "investigate allegations of war crimes".</br>  No other worldly exploration with your buddies. <br><br>Why even prosper?</br></br>  They aren't churning out artwork fast enough for my demigoddess.  <br>That's both way too subtle and completely ignores how stupid everyone who isn't Japanese is in this setting.</br>  <br>You can have the brown girl, just let me have Mizari</br>    <br>Her composure and design much more resembles a Yuki clone and I like it for that.<br><br>Powerful magic users should be like Rurumo after all.</br></br></br>  <br>Because an all-out attack would be accepted by the whole world right?</br>  <br>If "anything brown" also mean brown bunny warriors, then I might have to beat the crap out of you, m8.</br>  <br>Feudal armies (mercenaries) would rape and pillage the people they were presumably hired to "protect". Why would an enemy army doing that phase them?</br>  <br>This is a manga where the CIA launches an attack on a guarded complex and is SURPRISED the Japanese are well armed.<br>The CIA.<br>Surprised by the arms of a nation that the US sells arms to.<br><br>Logic is already out the window here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're surprised that the JGSDF have special forces units at all.</br>  <br>Mercenaries are a shit. The only thing they are good off is to be put on front lines and let them die and dull the blade of the enemies so they will cut your own troops less. <br><br>Literally would invade a town, kill every single man and only leave the woman so they have something to rape.</br></br></br>  <br>I imagine a quick firebombing of Tokyo would destroy the gate (among other things) and put a stop to it</br>  <br>Skewed context. The attempted kidnapping was a rush job and the men weren't briefed properly.<br><br>A novelfag might be able to explain this better but what I remember is that it makes sense.</br></br></br>  <br>I like Pinã Colada</br>  <br>She kind of reminds me of the girl from Napoleon Dynamite. Turns me off.</br>  <br>Quit ruining things, arse</br>  <br>sorry</br>  <br>Even more?</br>  <br> the CIA are incompetent <br>Seems plausible to me. How many years did it take them to find one towelhead?</br></br>  <br>How can you skew the context to where that's absolutely not fucking retarded?<br><br>I don't believe it's possible.</br></br></br>  <br><br> the CIA are incompetent </br></br>  <br>Don't even know how to properly throw someone out of a plane.</br>  <br>Mercenaries were the main infantry force for medieval warfare. They were certainly not only good for dying. That's a job for peasants.</br>  <br>That the CIA makes mistakes?<br><br>They're only human, it's completely possible.</br></br></br>  <br>The whole anime's a nationalistic circlejerk anyways so why not go full retard</br>  <br>I doubt that. The base is a few days away right?</br>  <br>Oh good. that means I can claim the dragon girl. Because she's probably blue.</br>  I want to go off roading with my mates in another world, chase elven girls and shoot dragons in the face. <br><br>;_;</br></br>  <br> My question wasn't answered last thread. But is Gate popular in Japan? <br><br>You'll have to keep an eye out for survey results then. Measuring popularity from /a/ threads is difficult due to the hate Gate gets from China due to the past war history, ongoing patent disputes, ongoing copyright disputes, and ongoing claims by China of vast areas of the Pacific Ocean which even go out towards Midway (thus nearly surrounding Japan). China has already driven Japan off the Senkaku Islands since they have "civilian" boats that ram into japanese naval ships and japanese commercial and private ships that try to visit the islands.</br></br></br>  <br> I want to go off roading with my mates in another world, chase elven girls and shoot dragons in the face. <br><br>Sure thing. <br><br>The next city ruler or bandit magic user will put your crew to sleep and you will be turned into a slave with a magic slave collar to force your obedience.

They're not legit today, they're a ridiculous extravagance at the expense of taxpayer money that the JSDF didn't even need to fend off some 200k+ troops anyway. But lets just build the motherfucker anyway to show dem stupid Americans that forts shouldn't be made out of trailers and crates - even though the JSDF could be ordered to abandon the base and RTB at any time.</br></br>  How mad are you that Tomato-kun gets the fuck Booze every night while you can only jerk off to her doujins?  <br> brain-damaged <br><br>Hate to defend Chibi Usa but SMC and the manga both go into further detail as to why Chibi Usa behaves the way she does despite being 900 years old.

They wouldn't even need the tanks and heavy artillery to fend off another assault now.</br></br>  <br>I still believe, that modern medicine can help Rori to get more womanly forms to tease Itami, with the help of hormone therapy.<br>Meanwhile they would get huge benefits from doing research on her immortal body.<br>Just one hint from Kurokawa.</br></br></br>  <br>Why? She's fine the way she is. Although I won't deny the benefits of research.</br>  <br>Fortifications also serve to project power and impress the local yokels. The message is<br> we built this impressive shit, so don't rise up in revolt </br></br>  <br><br> literally mutating immortal DFC loli </br></br>  If you were Itami, would you have continued posing as Tuka's father knowing that she'd be open to an incestuous relationship?  <br>Why the stupid Americans? They can't see it.</br>  <br>What do you mean? <br><br>She wasn't open to an incestuous relationship ever.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Assuming they don't trip over or get stuck on the hundreds of dragon corpses littered around the hill.</br></br>  <br>The gypsy natives are already stripping the dragons. Corpses won't last long as warnings.</br>  <br>She climbed into Itami's bed naked and wasn't exactly disgusted when she asked if he was having a lover's tiff with her.<br><br>Seems like she wouldn't have a problem having her father inside of her.</br></br></br>  Don't mind me, just posting the page where Rory won through her insurance policy.  <br>Nah. Fairly certain she just wanted to sleep.

We don't know how gods fuck.</br></br>  <br>I think he's getting confused how Hardy want's to marry Rori.</br>  <br>She wants to marry Rory</br>  <br>hate to tell you anon, but wanting to marry does not equal wanting to fuck. Plus she's already ascended.</br>  <br><br>For all we know she just wants to "own" Rory, and marriage is the closest/easiest way to have a god as your property.</br></br>  <br>as believable as any other story we got right now.</br>  <br> reddit held a contest and mushoku tensei won <br>Gate was #2 though.<br>Which says something when you consider that every other series that was in the top 10 were at least partially translated to some reasonable degree, or has regular translations ongoing.<br><br>Yeah, the poll results annoy me.<br>So anyone think someone will pick up the novel? or maybe even the Light novel?<br>Yen Press seems to be in the habit of picking up anything that looks pretty, and has a good following?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think you're confused as to the point I'm trying to get across.<br><br>Hardy wants to marry Rory, so I'm simply implying that she retained her ability to feel human emotions, I guess until the specifics of why Hardy wants to marry Rory are explained, this could be the best reason</br></br></br>  <br>  http://ak-scans.wikia.com/wiki/Nove<wbr>l_Translation</wbr> <br>muh /b/ grade grammer<br>Might it be intentional ?</br></br></br>  <br>of all the companies you had to mention, YP is your choice?<br>YP don't even translate that fast. it's like 1 volume per year. <br>they put a C&amp;D on web trans even if they don't got one book out yet. they're the devil.<br> mushoku tensei won <br>fucking reddit MT ain't even that good.<br>i enjoyed it and was here when it was translated.<br>didn't last the whole way but read the whole thing.<br>but it don't deserve to get its LN translated someone legit is gonna pick it up anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yen Press seems to be in the habit of picking up anything that looks pretty, and has a good following? <br>And then just like most companies, they just sit on the copyrights and don't do shit with them except mail out C&amp;D letters.</br></br>  <br> YP is your choice? <br>Simply because of how they seem to be picking up the most in the last year or two.<br><br> YP don't even translate that fast. it's like 1 volume per year. <br>3 per year. Which is slow, yeah.<br><br> they put a C&amp;D on web trans even if they don't got one book out yet. they're the devil. <br>Really? For what series?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They haven't been doing that though. Their releases are slow, sure, but they've actually be putting out releases.<br>Unless there's a case I'm not aware of?</br></br>  <br>When volunteers can put out content faster than paid translators, something is wrong.<br> inb4 they have a lot of projects to do <br>Well maybe they should finish those projects first before they fucking buy up more licenses.</br></br></br>  <br>Gizelle says that she likes men more (but Hadry is fine too).<br>So she compares fucking men VS similar intercourse with Hardy. This implies she has lesbian sex with Hardy somehow.</br></br>   you will never cuddle with a christmas cake military waifu with huge breasts, and is built like a brick shithouse.  <br><br>Why does it hurt to live?</br></br>  <br> something is wrong <br>Yeah, I'm guessing they want to pad out release dates. They can clearly output more; SAO translator translates for all SAO material, including the manga and spin-off novel, which means instead of 3 books a year, SAO get 6 books, and 3 or so manga volumes a year.<br><br>One theory I've read is that it's to give more "breathing room" between release, for the fans that don't really have much money (teenagers) to be spending on a bunch of books so often.<br>If that's the case, I think they're padding too much; every other month should be sufficient, really.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where is the christmas cake? All I see is an 18 year old idol.</br>  <br> Really? For what series? <br>Haruhi<br>Spice and Wolf<br>Hataraku (before it even started too)<br>Durarara<br><br>least pirates can do now is offer scattered translations here and there since YP is shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You meant "the most", not "the least" right?</br>  <br> On the other hand, it made a peace treaty 100% harder. <br>So? An insurgency and symmetrical warfare would've been a worst bitch to deal with later.<br><br><br>She's in her early 20s at most. Unless you're trying to perpetuate that stupid chapter 35 meme.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh yeah i meant the most</br>  Cutie pie.  <br> I'm guessing they want to pad out release dates. <br>This is alright if the padding between release dates weren't so absurdly long.</br></br>  <br>How would symmetrical warfare be worse for the JSDF?</br>  <br>Typo</br>  <br>asymmetrical</br>  <br>Cutest potato.</br>  <br>It's shit, for the record.</br>  <br>SHE ANSWERS QUESTIONS FROM OLD MEN FOR MONEY</br>  <br>Kuri is 24 hardly a christmas cake</br>  <br>You know that was a gigantic dick move from Rory.<br><br>She basically forced her way into the dragon expedition and then says it comes with a price. What price is that? Well she just takes Itami's soul without bothering to get his approval.</br></br></br>  Damn. Just one chapter into the manga and it's obvious the anime totally butchered the adaptation. So many character defining scenes were cut...  <br>But she's 35</br>  Kuribiyashi a cute. Very cute I tell you.  <br>She looks like a shota.</br>  <br>Did you upload the wrong image? That looks nothing like Kuribiyashi.</br>  <br><br><br>Don't you guys know anything about LED luminaries?

Just so you know, I typed this up while watching episode 4, and put it in points. I'm also analyzing things to that extent in order to predict why she is acting the way she is, to get some sort of closure in my head. <br><br>Seeing as how you wrote all that just to accuse me of being someone in another thread, it seems that you have a problem yourself, shitposting Nao.</br></br></br>  is this shitposting nao some kind of meme that I'm not aware of?  <br>You're the worse kind of people. You want closure? Wait for the next episode and then the next. If the series ends with some major plot holes, then making these analyzations would make sense. But the fact that you have to have "closure" within the first 4 episodes further reinforces towards the evidence that you are stratospheric. I will also keep the OCD label on you as you still seem to be putting periods at the end of every line.</br>  <br>Some meme weeboes use when they see people post pictures with Nao in them. I just started seeing it today.</br>  <br>Ah, I'm sorry I'm using periods, I'll be sure not to use them anymore, anyway the show is obviously dropping hints at what is to come so why not use them? Like the words in the OP, why would they put them there if not to let people make more accurate predictions you faggot</br>   Aimer 3rdアルバム「DAWN」 <br> 09.

The entire structure of the Ufotable fight worked differently, with it being Shirou, using sword spam and his own abilities, fighting to rush to Gil.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>When will we see Illya route where Gilgamesh teams up with Shirou?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's literally the other way around in the VN. Shirou is in his face the whole fight, Gil pulls out Ea, and SHirou hesitates because he can't copy it, and still cuts off his arm. Ufo actually changed the whole end of the fight to make Gil look better. The grail portal thing saved Gil while he was running like a bitch in the VN fight.</br>  <br>The DEEN version also had gems like this, where Shirou pulled out Caliburn.</br>  <br>No, I said Ufotable failed on ever possible level, and compared it to DEEN in just how much they failed. Ufotable interupted the fight, added in way too much exposition, destroyed the choreography (and the one the that made the fight GAR), and boiled the whole thing down to generic narutoshit.</br>  Old thread died: <br><br>So which version do we DL for anon-kun's subs, and did he do it for the SP/uncut version? is the 720p containing banding like the 1080p version did?<br><br>Pls response.<br><br>Links:<br>[1080p] http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>16434<br><br>[720p] http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>16416<br><br>raws here:<br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>12806<br><br>subs here:<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128655732#p128655732">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  THE DEAD SHOULD STAY DEAD  Why couldn't the second season be good like the movie?<br><br>What went wrong.<br><br>Even Mika as a smug Sibyl dog was done better.</br></br></br></br></blockquote>]
