You CAN learn Japanese!</br></br>    Can someone explain what どうだか means? I've read a few explanations in Japanese, but I still don't feel satisfied. Is it really just expressing doubt in what the other person has had to say?  <br>The ね is important. I don't have a perfect understanding of it, but かね is used in kind of retorical questions.</br>  じゃ、今回では糞レスばっかしてみろよｗ  What's the best anki deck for genki?

I think it is more about the rhythm and beat created by the sounds they make with their mouths than the act of trying to communicate something. <br><br>Like beat-boxing but instead of emulating the sounds of instruments and non-human made sounds, they mimic the human voice by stringing phonetics together with a sense of creativity.

It's something you can go back to repeatedly as you forget it.<br><br>But really you can take your time to some extent - you aren't really going to be able to read anything without finishing about Core2k anyway, so just aim to get Tae Kim as solid as possible around the time you add the last cards from Core2k</br></br></br>  <br>Don't do this. Without fail every time you tell yourself you don"t need to learn something it'll bite you in the ass. Soon it'll be like oh I don't need this or this and so on, then at that point you aren't even learning anymore. And whats more so is those readings actually show up depending on the writer. The safest and certain way that'll help you the most is to learn every reading and instance of the character.<br><br>As an example 有り難う.

Bet most people here probably don't know what the fuck this is <br>Fuck off you tard.</br></br>  <br>掛かる is written as かかる more than enough to justify not including 掛かる for beginners. Textbooks aren't supposed to be highly inclusive and they only usually cover vocabulary related to both the reading level and grammar covered in the text. It wouldn't make a lot of sense for an introductory text book including something the student likely isn't going to come across before progressing to the next text book or something they aren't going to be able to look up themselves. <br><br>I think you might be out of touch with what an introductory text is designed to do.</br></br></br>  <br>VNs don't use baby Japanese.

It's literally the same shit every fucking chapter. It's not even worth watching or reading to the Japs. I'd rather if Kubo just left it unfinished because it isn't even worthy of an ending.  <br>did bleach rape your gf or something?</br>    <br><br>See how small this thread is? Yeah I think that speaks for how many people actually gives a shit about Bleach. Just get off /a/, it's not worth me mentioning. Everything after Aizen is pointless and that's just me bring nice, arguably the only high point for Bleach was the Espada arc and that's cause Kubo said<br> Naruto's Akatsuki... <br> ESPADA MUH AKATSUKI </br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh so you're a Narutofag.</br>  <br> See how small this thread is? <br>What day do you think it is, nigger</br></br>  <br>Autism detected</br>  <br>Says a Bleachfag<br><br><br>Either way, it'll still be smaller than One Piece or any other fucking threads.

But the trope "MUH EVIL ORGANIZED CRIME GANG" that Naruto did Kubo simply emulated into his shit series at a time when the hype fo that shit was popular. Giving it it's only hype arc.

Is Ichigo one of Yhwach halVES? <br><br>Beg for forgiveness.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Needs more swastika.</br>  I hope we see more Orihime. It's a little sad not seeing her.  <br>Yhwach absorbed Mimihagi as well as the Soul King, why else would Yhwach take on Mimihagi's visage?<br><br>By definition, if Yhwach absorbed the SK he also absorbed Mimihagi, as Mimihagi is the Soul King's right hand.</br></br></br>  <br>Cool. I hope the content you had there won't get lost. That would be a shame. Had fun reading those theories.</br>  <br>Full copy has been almost restored. Just some caching/thumbnail generation remaining. Now off to sleep.<br><br>I missed some things surely as I do not participate as much as I did. In case people want to get something on the site - labmember011@gmail.com<br>And it's for 4chan related stuff only, so I won't be bothered if someone sets a spambot to nuke that mailbox.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Remember when Ukitake said not to use it where people can see?<br>He'll activate it.Next time we see him, his enemy lies defeated on the floor.</br></br>  <br>But we did see it.</br>  <br>Swastikas are for the final 24 hours<br><br>The Final Release of Hype<br><br><br>Yeah, he absorbed Mimihagi, but what does that matter? Are you implying that Mimihagi is keeping Soul King intact even inside Ywhach? Doesn't sound plausible to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> femboy <br>She's not a female boy, she's a male girl. Get it right.</br></br>  <br>I was simply correcting you; we don't know how it matters but it likely will as the plot progresses, same with any other plot point.</br>  <br>I agree, Mimihagi will probably pop-out to do something nasty to Yhwach, who can't see his actions in the future. However, I disagree that it's Mimihagi who keeps the worlds from falling apart right now. It's Yhwach, with Soul Kings power, who keeps the world in check. Therefore, if Mimihagi won't do anything, Ukitake died for nothing. Ichigo failed to capitalize on the time given to him by Ukitake's sacrifice.<br><br>Now that I think about it, Ichigo is the MVP of the quincy team.</br></br></br>  <br>It goes without saying that if the Soul King is the lynchpin, and Yhwach absorbed the Soul King (and Mimihagi), then Yhwach is currently the lynchpin. At this point he can recreate the world as he sees fit. Were you going anywhere with this assertion?</br>  Shunsui vs Jugram would be fun  <br>I don't know if you're the same guy, but yesterday the discussion was about Mimihagi keeping the worlds in check, not Yhwach.<br><br><br>They wouldn't fit, I think. Kyoraku's lines are always more important than his fight, and I doubt that Jugram would bother speaking much to him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yesterday the discussion was about whether or not Soul Society was "evil", which was derailed into the discussion you're referring to. Which is irrelevant considering as I've stated Yhwach has now fused with Mimihagi. There is no longer a clear distinction between their beings.</br>  <br>Weren't you the guy who defended Ukitake's sacrifice?</br>  <br>You'd need to find the post in the archive, I don't think I posted anything which directly referenced Ukitake.</br>  so first round of characters gonna lose against the villains and the second round comes to clean up again?  <br>Nah, Bazz-B is going to beat Haschwald and then Liltotto is going to eat Yhwach and become the Soul Queen. The end.</br>  <br>Don't forget there may be a second round of villains, if the Royal Guard are forced to fight for Yhwach.<br><br>Not to mention Yhwach still has Zanka no Tachi.</br></br></br>  <br>but orihime is soul queen<br><br> Royal Guard are forced to fight for Yhwach. <br>sounds interesting; trips speaks the truth</br></br></br></br>  <br> falling in love with secondary quincy characters <br>It was bound to happen.<br><br>Let go before you get hurt more</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wow so edgy</br>  <br>Orihime being relevant is A+.<br>I like it, anon.</br></br>  <br>i keep hoping for her to do something. i still think she will</br>  <br>I'm trying to help you, that's the opposite of edgy</br>  <br>I was joking you autist. Obviously Bleach is not going to end with Liltotto eating Yhwach.</br>  <br>nope, now the most she and chad will get is being ichigo's first set of sternritter.<br>Everything now suddenly goes back to the quincy</br></br>  <br>hard to argue with dubs</br>  <br>I didn't comment that. I commented on your latent wish for liltotto and bazz to survive.</br>  <br>Bleach sucks who gives a shit</br>  <br><br>Thanks for the bump m8.<br><br>So, are we expecting Bazz-B to just die this week, or are we getting the rest of the Sternritter jumping in to save him? Him rushing in first is pretty in line with how he acted thus far and having the other defectors defend him would be some genuinely sweet character building, which the Quincy in general could use.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We'll get some final thoughts from him and then he's dead.<br><br>Liltotto and Gigi assault Yhwach in the meantime</br></br></br>  <br>Let's face it, he's probably going to job to a Schutzstaffel to show off how strong they are, so that Renji, Byakuya, or Shunsui can skullfuck them with their respective bankais later and look that much more powerful.</br>  <br> We'll get some final thoughts from him and then he's dead. <br>that will probably be the whole chapter. bleach's pacing is so shit</br></br>  What are you waiting for the most?<br><br>I just want to see Byakuya and Kenpachi's Bankais.</br></br>  <br> orihime winning the ichibowl </br>  <br>too many fucking OP characters obviously. Some people need to be sacrificed to the Jump Editor God.</br>  <br>A glimpse of Rukia.</br>   Soul King pulls a Kaguya and absorbs Juha and is now healthy again and the real final villain <br> the Soul King is the one person that can't be foreseen by Juha's bullshit eye magic <br>How do you react?</br></br>  <br>Seconded.</br>    <br>I would be happy. We've been hyped up for the Soul King since forever. He better not just be a plot device. <br><br>And besides, he had four irises and is Yhwach's dad. How in the fuck could he just be a cripple?</br></br></br>  dropped this around arrancar arc..... worth picking up again?  <br>Read it with OST.</br>  I haven't watched or read this in years but I do remember a scene from the first episode I ever watched. The orange headed dude was training with the hobo looking guy with his new sword or something. The only major thing I remember about is that he said something about when orange head counters he shouldn't let them cut him, when he protects someone he shouldn't let them die and when he attacks he should kill.  Ah~ I wanna taste a Rukia~  You know, Aizen having a second hogyoku was a very late asspull.<br>It was mentioned right before Gin's betrayal so that he'd actually have a reason to betray him.</br>  <br>I don't follow.</br>  <br>Everyone, including Aizen, acted like urahara was such a genius because he invented the hogyoku. Yet during deicide it was revealed that Aizen also invented the hogyoku. The presenting souls to the hogyoku thing was introduced in the same flashback, together with rangiku's rape. Merging them too.<br>So the setup for gin's betrayal was a single flashback right before that, which also introduced a retcon.</br></br>  <br>I still don't understand what your problem is here.</br>  <br>I didn't like that.</br>  <br>Perhaps Aizen invented Hougyoku only after learning of Urahara's device. Aizen did straight up say that Urahara is more intelligent than him.</br>  Shhh... Rukia is sleeping.  anime reboot when?  <br>OVA when the manga is done</br>  Shikai never.<br><br>Only shinigami other than Yamamoto we've seen that could stand up against Captain-class enemies and above just by punching them hard.</br></br>  <br>good ole days<br>I wish they had animated Ichigos shikai as sleek and cool as the manga did</br></br>  <br>No, it was to illustrate that the hou gyoku wasn't one of a kind, but also to show that aizen was inferior, and playing with power beyond his understanding.<br>If it was just uraharas, then we might believe urahara had special materials or something, and aizens control over it would be presumed</br></br>  I never really visit bleach threads though I do read it. This thread feels so calm,like you guys know you're shit and are actually discussing it. There's only one guy saying these threads shouldn't exist,but besides that this is a pretty good quality thread compared to other shit here. I like it  <br>I know it's shit. Only reason I'm still following it is because I want to see how it ends. Plus, it's fun to make up insane theories about Kubo's tendency to Kubo (practice named after him for good reason) his readers.</br>  <br> Plus, it's fun to make up insane theories about Kubo's tendency to Kubo <br>This<br><br> Bleach also has the best memes on /a/. </br></br></br></br>  <br>We will see more flashbacks and stuff just before the moment Haschwald kills Bazz. then Kubo will jump to a different fight leaving us with a cliffhanger.<br><br>100 chapters later. Haschwald cuts Bazz down.</br></br></br>  is this still being updated?  <br>I suppose that the peer pressure over the years has made us humble. We've had our shitstorms though. People get pretty butthurt when someone posts their waifu a bit too much.<br><br><br>That's not the last one IIRC, but it's not being updated anymore. We grew tired of it I suppose.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Unohana <br> Actually dead <br>I still think there are Banaki we will never seen, Isshin and Aizen come to mind.</br></br></br>  <br> Shunsui: "One of you is going to die." <br> Unohana: "Shit, I'm dying." <br> Kenpachi: "She's dead, I've inherited her everything." <br> fans: "she's not dead" </br></br></br></br>  <br>underrated post</br>  <br>Are you implying that people die when they are killed?</br>  bump  Will the flashback continue? When will we see Aizen?  <br>that's the last one I saw.</br>  <br>The only reason why this thread is dead is because people aren't discussing. That is partially due to the fact that most of the big questions have been answered, or because Kubo hasn't made any huge twists lately on the same tier as Ichigo accidentally killing God.<br>Me, or Lab not posting to encourage discussion is also a factor to consider.</br></br>  <br> implying you're the only ones </br>  <br>Of the tripfags, at any rate. There are some very attentive anons who manage to catch things that go unnoticed.<br>Speaking of which, Yhwach said that he could still "see" despite the fact that his eyes were closed in his fight with Ichibei. Another possible hint to Ichigo's power manifesting when he "sees into the heart" of those he fights, reads their fighting style and predicts their attacks.</br></br>  <br>I like when these threads are slower, purely for the fact that you post less. I don't have to see any of your asinine theories that you present as facts.</br>  <br>I don't think that Ichigo ever predicted anything. He said that he only realizes the things after battle.</br>  <br>I want to discuss Ginjo's origins. Is he a hybrid like Ichigo, or some of the retarded quincies who were culled in the past?</br>  <br>He reads the hearts like the hogyoku reads the desires of people around it</br>  <br>He would've died in his mother's womb if he was a quincy.</br>  <br>Like ichigo died? :^) ginjo might be a hybrid too. The not so successful experiment before Ichigo</br>  <br>Are you implying that Urahara saved Ginjo too</br>  <br>If that's the case, I have a question for you because, so far, I didn't see any satisfactory answer to it.<br><br>What did the Bleach world look like before the Gotei sealed the Soul King?</br></br></br>  <br>You'd have gotten a decent answer to that already if anyone actually knew for sure.</br>  <br>He doesn't always specify when he becomes aware of it. In Aizen's case he gave the impression of becoming aware of it after the fact. When he fought fused Zangetsu he could sense it as they were fighting, he said that Zangetsu's blade was only giving off the feeling of loneliness. When he trained with Ginjo he said that he could not read Ginjo's heart, that was due to Tsukishima's alterations. In his first fight with Ulquiorra Ichigo claimed that he could not feel anything at all and that it was like fighting a statue, or a robot. However later on he could read Ulquiorra and he attributed that to the fact that they had become more similar since their last fight. <br><br>In my opinion it was simply a matter of difference in power. Ichigo later claims that when he gained the power to stand on equal footing (read: curb stomp) with Aizen he could read him as well, implying that previously he could not. From this we may infer that the powers of the almighty can be blocked by a stronger reiatsu and to support this we have Yhwach who was unable to read the Soul King's future.</br></br></br>  <br>Urahara or Aizen are always involved</br>  <br>it doesn't have to be 100% truth. I'd just like to hear a somewhat plausible and not completely idiotic theory.</br>  Teppu final chapter<br><br>https://www.sendspace.com/file/kgql<wbr>q5</wbr></br></br>  <br> final <br>stop bullshitting me</br></br>  <br><br>Known since last chapter, reported by Comic Natalie yesterday, shit sucks<br>http://natalie.mu/comic/news/153081<wbr><br>can't pretend anymore.</br></wbr></br></br></br>  What happened in it I can't download it  <br>fuck fuck, this better be a lie.</br>  <br>Godfucking damn it anon</br>  <br> Teppu is over </br>  Wait, did she dream her brother came out to watch kungfu movies?  <br>I always wanted to get into the series but I wasn't sure if it was going to have the legs to go the distance so I didn't. <br><br>Now I'm disappointed.</br></br></br>  <br><br>try this<br>https://d.maxfile.ro/cpzpponyqw.zip<wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>was that her brother ?</br>  Why does her brother hate her again?  <br>yeah<br><br>better than him and all physical activities, taller, and her beating up his bullies just made him look weaker.</br></br></br>  <br>please tell me the artist is coming back a year fro now<br><br>I don't care how long it takes, I want more teppu</br></br></br>  Teppu's outdated now.

You doesn't fit in the house and you can't even give her a  full body hug  or  make love  while looking into eachothers eyes.</br>  <br>Let her tenderly dominate you. As you lie in your bed, tied down and unable to move, let her overwhelm you with her love and wipe your tears away.</br>  <br> Not doing couples yoga with your centaurfu to do all of the above. </br>  <br>Ask her to blindfold you.</br>   manga about monster girls <br> some people think Ms. Smith is the best girl <br>Why</br></br>  <br>fap to spiders every day</br>  Friendly reminder: Suu is, without a doubt, the best girl  <br>There are those among us who believe her to be a Succubus.</br>  <br>plebs gonna pleb</br>  <br>get over it with counseling or something <br>that's what i did with Miia and snakes and she's been my waifu for 3 years now</br></br>  <br>The same folks who go to Baskin' Robbins, ask to use their restroom, then drink from the tap.</br>  <br><br>Mizore shiriyuki is the best monster girl ever created. <br>This one does not hold an icicle to mizore.</br></br></br>  And normally I hate anime openings.  <br>How can anyone be afraid of snakes? Spiders I can understand because of how absolutely alien looking they are. But snakes are just these big soft squirmy guys with big kawaii eyes who you can wrap around your arms and have big snakey fun time. The only way you could make snakes better is if you added cute girls, which are why Lamias a best and Miia is best girl.<br><br>Then again I'm terrified of beetles and beetles alone.</br></br></br>  <br>Legs and now ass.</br>  <br>For me it's the endings, but this time the anime was sold on me at the end</br>  <br>I love suu's opening appearance.<br><br>I seriously want to fuck a slime though.</br></br></br>  <br>That's how I've learned to see them, but i had a bad experience with one when i was a kid where one bit me and scared the fuck out of me, made me really spooked of them for a long ass time <br><br>which is strange because i've been bit by a lot of things since i worked with animals a lot growing up, and the snake was the only thing that really stuck with me</br></br></br>  <br> Then again I'm terrified of beetles and beetles alone. <br>But they make the best heroes.</br></br>  So what do you do if you're with her and this happens to you on the job ?  <br>They clearly made her hips and thighs wider in the anime design.  No complaints here. </br>  So I'm really not a fan of harem anime in general, mostly because I hate the concept of love triangles or characters "competing" for someone's affections. I love me some MonsterGirls and cheesey romance, though. Would I like MonMusu or would it just piss me off? I know the obvious "Watch it yourself, faggot" but I hate only watching part of a series.  <br><br>She may not be entirely Human as far as we're aware or its just assumed that she Human.</br></br>  <br>She's a gag character, so no matter how many bones she breaks while falling on top of you, you're guaranteed to be completely healthy by the next frame save for a few bandages.</br>  <br>The MC has seven girls living under his roof, competing for him. If this idea puts you off, then it puts you off. I don't really care, because they play off of each other well.</br>  <br>I don't.<br><br>I want to cum inside her arachnid pussy and have arachnid babies with her.</br></br></br>  <br>I guess the question is more "Is the MC waffling about between girls or is it apparent which girl he likes/is going to win?"</br>  <br>The series will either end without any conclusion, or then the first girl will win. That's how these things work.</br>  <br>slime &gt; snake &gt; bird &gt; all else</br>  <br>Friendly reminder than Miia is still very much in first place in the darlingbowl<br><br>Even if she's not best girl</br></br></br>  Keep the subhumans for yourselves while I impregnate Smith.  <br><br>What if that had happened to Manako ?</br></br>  <br>Two sides of the same coin.</br>  <br><br>Are there going to be BD nipples?</br></br>  <br>Fear boner best boner.</br>  <br><br>Miia being the adorable snakegirl, right? Alright, I'll give this a shot then. Thanks, anons.</br></br>  <br>Maybe humans are the real monsters.</br>  <br>deepestlore.webm</br>  <br>This<br> was first girl, so automatic harem advantage <br> Papi and Mero are no competition, Suu isnt really either since she would just do what anyone in particular wants. Meaning her competition is horse pussy, femdom spider, and dullahan of no screen time. <br> Darling communicated with her mom the most, as the other moms were pretty focused on their child, not on Darling <br> Being an all-female species, is most suited for human shlonging </br></br></br></br></br>  Finally watched the first episode<br><br>I forgot Lerche was so good at animation. No wonder you guys were so hyped at the announcement. They should do more stuff.  Lerche Fate adaptation when? <br><br>Not a huge fan of the OP, but I like that the girls sing different lines. Good episode. Great ED.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, Miia is the silly snake. Papi is the ditzy Harpy, Cerea is the "honorable" Centaur, Suu is the rapeblob, Mero is the rich mermaid with weird fantasies about tragic love, Rachne is the bondage spider and Lala is the headless whoresman.</br>  Why are Rachnee fags so obnoxious?   there are no male lamias <br>How did they show up to begin with?</br>  <br>She'd cry.</br>  <br> subhumans <br><br>But why would anyone want that obnoxious couple?</br></br></br>  <br>Miia actually has the plot armor of her race being completely dependent on male breeding partners as well as being first girl<br><br>She's really far in the lead.<br><br>Mero might make up ground now that she realises NTR isn't fun<br><br>Horse Pussy's chances are slim<br><br>Rachnee can charm darling very easily</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't cut yourself on that edge.</br>  <br>There are plenty of animals that function with only one sex.</br>  <br> Mero is the rich mermaid with weird fantasies about tragic love,  <br>She's a cuck<br>Just call her a cuck</br></br></br>  The best monster girl.  <br>Cross genetics anon.<br><br><br>Obnoxious because we like stating the obvious?<br>(That Rachnee is best girl and should be worshipped)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I haven't watched this show yet but in some universes with Monster Girls, they are explicitly Monster GIRLS, and there are no males. They mate with humans, all male children are fully human and all female children are new Monster Girls.</br>  Let us not forget the one big advantage here.  <br>But she realized herself she doesn't like that.</br>  <br>because theyre the most vocla</br>  <br><br>Are you sure she wouldn't white out ? <br><br>I recall them assassinating her color at one point when they were going shopping.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No you don't. That is probably part of her spider anatomy.</br>  <br>In MonMusu, there are some males depicted (male orcs come to mind), as well as implicit males of species with only female depictions (like how everyone assumed Lizard Lesbo was a boy).</br>  <br>Don't worry, it's a very dull edge by now.</br>  <br>I just feel like Rachnee showed up way too late in the game and hasnt gotten nearly as much screentime as the earlier girls, I mean she will probably get more time later, but poor lala needs to at least show up somewhere.</br>  <br>Some female lizards in the animal kingdom can have children without a male.<br>They basically function as a genetic clone of the mother.</br></br>   I like spiders   Episode 1 did a much better job of showing the monster half of miia than the manga did.<br><br>When the yankiis were laughing at her a second time she began to hiss and bare her teeth and shit, it may have been overshadowed by darlings touma punch, but I like the animal side of miia as much as her deredere human side.<br><br>I'm still a slime fan though, so hopefully they handle kaiju suu and poison suu equally well.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I think there's a type of lizard that can reproduce asexually. The mother just produces a clone of herself. But there are males as well, and they can also reproduce heterosexually if they find one.<br><br>I think? I might be remembering this wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really<br><br>She doesn't like the idea of getting cucked anymore<br><br><br> late in the game <br>No such thing anon<br><br>She arrived at precisely the right time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The cutest  <br>and they're the most vocal because they're the most numerous<br><br>remember, tend to have shit taste<br> Rachnera is top 5 tho </br></br></br></br>  <br> precisely the right time <br>Is she a wizard?</br></br>  <br>The biggest problem is that the series is a harem, and a big one at that. Crab has introduced too many girls for there to be a reliable mate for MC.<br>A better idea would have been to pair up Darling with Miia, spend a few chapters with them, and then move onto a new couple; or end the harem at Rachnee and focus on multiple families.</br></br>  <br>Also centaurs with cuckoldry as as central point in reproduction.</br>  <br>the majority tend to have shit taste*</br>  <br>Reminder that she asked to hold hands.<br>A SLUT.</br></br>  did crabman say anything about the anime? he liked it?
