She mentions she never knew it had those kind of powers/curses on it before, and also it sounds chunni as shit</br>  I just noticed that whenever possible players are mentioned, it's always in groups. Like the six gods or the eight greed kings or thirteen heroes. It sounds to me like it's individual guilds getting transferred over.<br><br>Too bad Papa Bones is a lonely skellington.</br></br>  <br>Rolling for Demon Lord to join up.</br>    <br>The fuck is a chunni</br>  <br>Had they all logged in, Momonga would probably have convinced some to stay on until the very end and whoosh, there'd be more than just him now.<br><br>One of the dragon's specialty is turning players against each other. Wonder how that's going to work with Papa Bones. Without a WC item, turning the Guardians against him is nigh impossible.</br></br></br>    <br>lets do this</br>  <br>Alright lets go faggots.</br>  <br>You know how you wanted to be something nonsensical like a T-Rex or Harry Potter as a kid? Well a chunii is someone that nevr grew out of that phase and still spouts stupid shit like "Witness my Flames of Obliteration, mirrors of my dark soul!" well into his teens and adult life.</br>  <br>TOMB KING REPORTING FOR ACTION</br>  <br>But these people can actually pull off flames of obliteration.</br>  Ayy fucking finally lmao<br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>13399</wbr></br>  <br>She doesn't and that's why it's funny.<br><br>She's a cleric with a dark power sword and great warrior but she still wants to pretend she has a cursed evil energy and dark flames and all that shit when she doesn't.</br></br></br>  <br>As long as I'm a cute grill, I'll just charm my way out of any situation :3c</br>  <br><br>Technically this is a lie while also being correct</br></br>  <br><br>I still don't see what's up with the princess but i'<br>d kill her anyway since they are hammering us over the head that something is wrong with her</br></br></br>  <br>rolling as slime</br>  <br>Well as long as she isnt telling people its ok. Reading it it seems like they overheard her talking to herself.</br>  <br><br>I WANNA BE THE GUY</br></br>  <br>Her faith seems iffy for a cleric with this fascination of dark powers.<br><br>Honestly holy power doesn't even make sense to me most of the time. Can anyone that plays enough tabletop explain what holy damage is? I can understand healing and how it can damage undead, but what the hell is going on when holy damage hits a non-undead. I can't even fathom how it can be translated to reality.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I was pumped but he's probably only a little bit stronger than iguava. can beat maids and thats about it</br></br>  <br>God smites people in the bible. That's basically what holy damage is. Divine retribution striking people dead.<br><br>I would agree that it's pretty vague, but that's how it is.</br></br></br>  <br>Gods wreck people all the time. They just wreck undead more.</br>  <br>Yeah, I just don't like how it has no analog to anything in reality so it's hard to imagine.<br><br>I always try to see it as either physical construct of light hitting something like green lantern rings or a burning light.</br></br></br>  <br> Her faith seems iffy for a cleric with this fascination of dark powers. <br><br>Again, that's why it's funny. This is a universe where you can gain dark power but she's not actually pursuing that, she's just being silly chuuni about it for fun.<br><br>As far as holy power/damage goes it's literally asking your chosen deity/source of holy power to add some FUCK YOU to whatever thing you're trying to attack. Depending on the system sometimes it doesn't modifying attacks against a non evil enemy but most of the time it's just another damage modifier that just happens to effect evil/undead more than it would a neutral creature. Just imagine it like adding fire damage or something to an attack but it has the added effect of doing 4X damage on undead and shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also a maid and total qt.<br>All the girls are top tier semen demons.</br></br>  <br><br>Basically pic-related</br></br>  <br> Ninya <br> Lukeluther <br> Peter <br> Dyne <br>Nevar forget ;_;7</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I just don't like how it has no analog to anything in reality so it's hard to imagine. <br><br><br>It's easier to imagine than "arcane" damage and shit. Still, sometimes it takes the form of light or fire or lightning but that doesn't necessarily mean that's what it feels like when you're getting hit by it.</br></br></br></br>   people in the New World using MMO lingo <br><br>that's kind of neat, im guessing some of the players became kings or some shit and propogated that shit</br></br>  <br><br> grasping her right hand <br> rings on all fingers <br> talks with her dark personality <br> darkness powers <br> darkness <br>comeon</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They were easily forgettable as far as killed off characters go. <br><br>Most of their interactions were just talking to Ainz and I don't think we ever got internal dialogue from any of them. They were also only there for a short time and were absent for like half the time they traveled with Momon. <br><br>Really easy to kill off overall. Compare that literally anyone else from the LIzardmen on and you can see how little you should honestly care about their deaths.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Magic doesn't have an analog to real life either though. Especially not "dark magic/energy".<br><br>I think of it mostly like a really focused ray of light from the sun, almost like a laser except sunlight. The reaction a vampire would get from normal sunlight, i.e. being scorched.<br><br><br>Aye, but I'm still not feeling people with "martial arts" (hoping for a better translation tbh) "activating skills". Sounds retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ninya <br>Male or female?</br></br>  They need to introduce some more players soon. Not that I don't mind Momongas rape train, but he needs some real adversaries.  <br>They all dudes. They even talk about how having a girl would be weird with them all probably wanting to fuck.</br>  <br>Sure, but they were nice and relatable, and didn't deserve to go like that. I liked them.<br><br><br>Male.</br></br></br></br>  Last one hit bump limit  Starting the thread off right  Luffy/Zoro appreciation thread ? <br>Luffy/Zoro appreciation thread.<br><br>Absolute best bros.</br></br></br>  <br>The best thing about Luffy is the faith and trust he has in his nakama</br>  <br>Aw yeah nigga!</br>    <br>Absolutely. Moments like that is just satisfying. <br><br> Sanji: Permission to return fire on Big Mom's ship <br> Luffy: Sure, have at it. <br>Both of them don't even know if a bloody Yonko is on board but Luffy knows they'll be fine.  maybe </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I only started noticing how similar their reactions are after the ''Hero'' definition thing.</br>  Starting this thread off with a song sung by best Straw Hat about best Straw Hat<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GKf<wbr>AmJK2yO8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>That's nice and all but this is the song we really need in this thread<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-YU<wbr>0NxTcdcg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>   yfw Bon-chan was smart enough to figure out Zoro was Luffy's biggest bro, near Usopp <br>Bon-chan was so based.</br>  ONE PIECE EARLY SPOILERS <br><br>Franky: Confirmed<br><br>Chapter 795: The land of Sakura Trees, Wano!<br> <br>No chapter today ;_;</br> </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait. That happens pre-TS ?</br>  <br>Dont make me sad, man, flashbacks to Brook</br>  <br>The song ? No, I believe it was released separately. I can see them singing it when they reach Laboon though. And it's gonna make me cry a river.</br>  <br>Oh come on, focus on the good part! The crew is together and singing and partying! Think of how happy that makes Brook feel. Don't make me write an essay about how broken Luffy was over losing Ace, like in the last thread.</br>  <br>I just noticed how Zoro was in the middle of the first panel and not Luffy. That's kinda awesome.</br>    <br>No, I meant the page you posted.</br>  <br>I was foucsing on the good part and I saw your essay</br>  <br/>  <br>Of course it happens before Pre-TS. before they got to Sabaody, they meet the Flying Fish Riders, remember ? With Sanji meeting his betrothed ?</br>  <br>My favorite part on Jaya arc was BB smashing Sarquiss off the ground. Luffy and Zoro understood that they were the actual threat after beaten up.</br>  <br> watching the series for the first time 2 years ago <br> feels like tons of buildup to that weird looking motherfucker on the marine train <br> luffy/zoro finally run into them <br> steamrolled <br><br>I laughed so goddamn hard at that shit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damnit man, why did go back to the past ? Stick to the present. Just keep spinning.<br><br> Zoro and Sanji save Luffy instead of Zoro saving Chopper. <br>Getting your priorities straight.</br></br></br></br>  <br>To me, that scene is one of the best written parts of One Piece. The simple message of Brook's story is so profound. <br><br>One day, you and everyone you've ever loved will die. But as long as the journey was full of happiness and joy, it was a life well lived.<br><br>I listened to that song on loop when my grandpa died. He was a sailor.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My memories are cloudy, I'm in a rereading process, but I'm at vol 44 aka Merry's funeral.<br>But I somehow was sure Keimi only appeared outside cover stories after the timeskip. But I'm realizing I'm stupid because I forgot that moment with the tenryubiito</br></br>  <br>Yea, that scene gave me goosebumps. Luffy and Zoro knew Teach was someone special. Vice versa too, Teach knew those two weren't some random kids.<br><br><br>I felt kinda bad for T-steak actually. Zoro even kinda hyped him up a little bit but Nope. Just gtfo, have a good day. Was a cool dude though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Brook's backstory was shit and you're an oversensitive fag for actually crying over stuff like that.<br> No, i wasn't talking about your late grandpa. </br></br>  <br>Not even him, but fuck you, man. Don't you know that different things resonate with different people? One Piece has so many great moments, that there's something for everyone.</br>  <br>Sorry for your lose bro.<br><br>But yea, Brook's past was the most hard-hitting for me. Strange too since my mother and father kinda left me and brother when we were young so I figured I would connect with Robin more but apparently not. The amount of sadness Brook had to go through for 50 long, dark, lonely years is just messed up. I think his dream is going to be one of the most satisfying when it's fullfilled. It's going to be awesome.<br><br><br>Aw man, how could you forget that amazing punch ? I won't judge you though. Too many people calling others ''speed readers'' when the reason is just that our memories are shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't respond mate. Just leave uptight twats to themselves. They're just irritated over their sandy vaginas.</br>  <br><br> responding <br><br>don't</br></br></br></br>  <br>Miss Valentine was a cute.</br>    When will Brook finally have a real, serious battle that shows he's not absolutely useless?  <br>Bellamy is probably the biggest cunt in the series during Jaya. I don't see how him being a beta sack of shit in Dressrosa redeems him in anyone's eyes</br>  <br><br>I still think L+Z should've slapped bellamy's shit.<br><br>There's nothing to prove by getting beat up like a bitch, it even motivates them to keep insulting the same way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Agreed. I think Nel Zel did some thing of her, if you want to check that out.</br>  <br>Miss Monday a cute</br>  <br>Haha, the worst part is that I didn't forgot the punch, just the reason of the punch. But I remembered a lot more, now.<br>I hate how the brain functions.<br><br>Still, speedreaders are a thing when they can't grasp things that happened in the last chapter. Fortunately, it isn't that frequent among all readers, stupid fucks are just more loud.<br><br>Anyway, you seem to be a nice guy anon, that's pretty rare here. Enough to be said.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In Dressrosa, when he saved the Ship and the crew. <br><br><br>He was apologetic though. He clearly regretted it. And he was nice to Luffy. Anyone who's nice to Luffy is a good guy in my book.<br><br><br>Maybe. But it would have left a bad taste in their mouths. To me, that scene showed Luffy's dedication to Shanks and Zoro's dedication to Luffy. Like Shanks said, there's no need to lose your head over a bar fight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What the fuck is bink's sake mean anyway? Sorry fags but it's forced as hell. They died like a bitch. If Oda was a proper man, he would make that moment in pure silence.</br></br>  <br>Hopefully he gets one here, or at Wano, though that will probably be Zoro's time to shine</br>  Comfy early duo  <br><br>When he's forced to fight Kinemon because Kinemon is somehow honor-bound to serve Kaido</br></br>  <br>I think the main reason people can't grasp the previous chapter is usually because of translations. A lot of people get the idea quickly when someone fully explains it instead of just saying ''ur a speed reading cunt. end of story''. That's just annoying, in all levels.<br><br>It's such a comfy thread. No need to ruin it all over a single post bro. 'Be nice whenever possible. It's always possible'. Learned that shit from a wallpaper in /b/ and I've been trying to do that ever since.</br></br></br>  I'm on watching OP anime, but why is Doflamingo weaing a katana, does he turn out to be a swordsman?  <br>Sorry that it wasn't heterosexual enough for you, anon.<br>Maybe a close-up of a shirtless muscleman marine saluting them while crying a single tear would have hit your sensibilities more.</br></br>  <br>sure thing buddy.<br><br><br>Man, they really were 2 peas in a pod, huh ?<br><br><br>Surely he would fight Zoro instead ? he needs to get back Ryuuma's sword. 2 birds, one stone ?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doflamingo kills Kyros with his Awakened String Iaito Style</br>  <br> watching the anime <br>Kill yourself</br></br>  <br>Yea, he and Fujitora fight Zoro at the same time. Shit's pretty cool.</br>    <br> pic related <br><br><br>Don't fell for it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, its just the OP anime makes me very angry</br>  <br>Pretty sure it was just a joke Anon. Not actual bait.</br>  <br>It's a joke for people who know what's up, but a bait for morons.</br>  Zoro x chopper when???????  <br>yup, they still are, also checked</br>  <br>They'd have to Luffy/Chopper levels of moronic. And I'm not sure that kind of anomaly exists in this world.<br><br><br>I'm sure there's lots of it online.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cheers. Another page of them having a single brain that they share.</br>  <br><br>I'll only be okay with it when Chopper''s 18, and only when he's in Heavy or Monster Point</br></br>  I'm suddenly reminded of some retards saying that if Luffy had beaten Mihawk at Marineford, he would have become the world's best swordsman and Zoro would try to kill him.  <br> And I'm not sure that kind of anomaly exists in this world. <br><br>You don't seem to hang around in these threads often.</br></br></br>  <br>Im assuming Zoro got most of it</br>    <br>Isn't chopper supposed to be the oldest on the crew in human age?</br>  <br>Well, I mea- <br>Never mind. Point taken. I honestly think 70% of the time people are just joking, looking for attention, lonely, making themselves laugh and what not but some of the conclusions being reached can only be achieved by a mad man.<br><br><br>That's highly debatable sometimes. I think they both have 25% and take the other 50% from a Bank when needed.</br></br></br></br></br>  Zoro is the coolest.  <br>If you don't scroll down all the way it looks like Luffy just Supermans into the sky and its even funnier</br>  <br>I never got that shit. Why do cats and dogs have different age, compared to us ? Do they have a calendar system ? I mean, why do they have some kind of other ''year'' ? And Oda said he was 15-17 so I'm just gonna stick to that.</br>  <br>What's the average life expectancy of a reindeer?<br>Because Chopper may not have much left to live if so.</br></br>  Those colored scans look really fucking good.<br>Where can I read them?</br>  <br> Q's ass is taller than Zoro <br>This is where Oda first got really weird with proportions, right?</br></br>  <br>It also looks like he's being abducted by a Bird alien.<br><br><br>He certainly gets the priorities straight.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy and Zoro having casual conversation is the greatest</br>  <br>he was 15-17 as a raindeer. I guess it makes 65-70 in human life. Just compare it with their livespan. For e.g. if you cosider a dog's lifespan as 10 and a human's 100, a dog's 1 year would equal a human's 10 years.</br>  <br><br>He's the youngest at 17 as of the Time Skip, unless you're trying to do a "Reindeer's years to human years" thing</br></br>  <br>bato.to <br><br><br>Eh, I dunno. Crocodile was pretty tall. But yea, I think he may have made an effort to make Teach's crew all around the same height.</br></br></br></br>  <br>These pages are just proving that Zoro really is the coolest. Sometimes you forget just how cool he is.<br><br>Also, I'd like to see Nami wear more than just a bikini top more often.</br></br></br>  <br>15 to 20 years.<br>So yeahhh, unless the hito hito increased his lifespan somehow, it won't be much longer until he bites it. And even then he probably won't live past 40.</br></br>  Post coloured spreads.  <br>Was Luffy drunk in pic related? Always bothered me how out of character he was by turning so fast on Zoro.</br>  <br>It's just a colloquial way to explain why dogs have shorter lifespans. The average lifespan of a dog is like 13 years (discounting deaths by unnatural causes), so it's like they age 5 to 7 times faster than us.</br>  <br> 13 years <br>Really?<br>Nearly all of my dogs have lived until 16~ years with the oldest at 18.<br>The dogs of people I know are also pretty long-lived.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuuuck, that is so adorable. I never noticed that and I haven't reached there on my reread. Them both and Usopp, Chopper drinking Tea, talking about Mystery Currents was hilarious too.<br><br><br>I don't think he was 15-17 as a reindeer. He's 15-17 in general. But I still don't get why Animals get a different calendar/age system.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Law giving Chopper immortality as a fellow Doctor, confirmed ?<br><br><br>To be fair, it was pretty early in their journey and he had just woken up so it's safe to say he wasn't thinking right.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It varies depending on the breed, the dog's life style, how well you care for them, etc. Generally speaking, purebred dogs have shorter lifespans than mixed breeds. I was talking in averages. All the pure breed dogs drag down the average considerably. Like take Border Collies, their average lifespan is 12 years, but my own purebred Border Collie lived to be almost 15, though her last year was very hard on her.</br>  <br>Animals get a diffrent age system because retards can't comprehend other lifeforms don't have the same lifespan as humans.<br>So, they need some point of comparison, therefore people coming up with [x animal] growing older with some ratio.<br><br>That way, retards can realize their dog is old as hell even if it's 15 yo because in "human age" it's 105.</br></br></br></br>    Daily reminder that Law a slut.    <br> But I still don't get why Animals get a different calendar/age system <br><br>I guess that's why people don't want to feel bad when their beloved pet dies. Instead of feeling like it died young and feeling worse over it, they clang on stuff like that. but also animal metabolism forces us to make a distinction between lifespan models. That's the scientific reason.</br></br></br>  <br>Still dont need a reminder</br>  <br>So if a Reindeer is 5 years old, he's about 50 in Human years ? <br><br>Yea, I'm pretty sure Chopper isn't 15-17 in Reindeer form.</br></br></br>  <br>It depends on the breed really, but yeah 15 is going to be over the hill even for the most vigorous mixed breed. I had a black lab German shepherd mix growing up that lived to be 18, and she was swimming around and playing fetch even into her teens, only got bad in her last couple years.</br>  <br><br>Well, I understand now but I guess I won't fully like it. But that's fine. Thanks you two.</br></br>      What's up with the  birds?   <br>Someone's DF ability.</br>  Just a question about the chapter before the newest.<br><br>Is there a clue as to who the unexpected person/s on the island could be from the sound effect we see next to Urouge's face?<br><br>Could it be...  Enel ?</br></br></br></br>  Same damn brain, I'm telling you<br><br><br>Enel is a fan favorite and it would make sense for him to be up there. What does the sound effect sound like though ?</br></br></br>  <br>Thats the obvious guess, but I don't see why Enel would still be hanging out on cloud islands after amassing and army and flying ship.<br>I think its somebody from Blackbeard's crew, maybe Lafitte, flying up after attacking him for his fruit. We should also remember than Gan said there are easier ways to get to Sky Island's other than the knock up stream. Could really be anything</br></br>  <br>Ooh, I kinda like the idea of it being Lafitte, trying to recruit Urouge but do you think Teach would want someone like him or just his fruit ?</br>  <br>I don't understand why people claim it to be Enel. At the end of his backstory, he reached his dream and probably we'll never see him anymore.</br>  <br>Of course they want Uruoge, even without his power he can swing about a 108 ton pillar prior to the timeskip</br>  <br><br>Extremely unlikely to be recruitment, and does Urouge even have a DF in the first place?</br></br>  <br> probably we'll never see him anymore <br>Ahahahahah<br><br><br>True, but weight lifting isn't really a big deal in OP, is it ? Especially considering Urouge's size.<br><br><br>I believe he has a Fruit that turns damage into power or something like that. He turns bigger after fighting with the Pacafista and wonders if he can dish out the damage back. It was mentioned in one of the Databook thingies.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, if the "model" is 1 for 10, yes, we could say that.<br><br>Anyway you could argue that Chopper now ages like a human because human DF and fuck other zoans, they age like humans BECAUSE.<br><br>Also, why chopper's default form is his hybrid one and not his reindeer one ?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, he'd be a major asset to the crew, he's clearly one of the stronger Supernovas and it would really help them if they ever clashed with one of the other powers</br>  <br>Before that chapter I was adamant that Urouge was Blackbeard's 10th fleet captain, now I'm gonna keep pushing for him being a target for BB. He's the only supernova not associated with a Yonko, and the only Yonko with no immediate plot involving a Supernova.</br>  <br>Yes. He's listed as a Devil Fruit user in the Deep Blue databook.<br><br>inb4 some prick whines about how the databooks are fan fiction</br></br></br>  <br>Probably because it's more useful. Reading books, grinding medicine and pulling up anchors and shit would be rather awkward with hoofs/hooves.<br><br><br>I suppose. I really like the character, not as a joke either. I think he might have one of more interesting backstories yet. It just feels like Oda isn't using him that much. But maybe that's just me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I guess Bonney is unaffiliated too, but hers is more a point of being in hiding or alone.</br>  <br>bonney? <br><br>getting captured by BB for like 10 minutes doesnt count</br></br></br>  <br>Bonney is Yonko-free too, no ? Or am I forgetting something ?</br>  <br>I really hope he stays relevant outside of the meme sense, I think it would be really cool to have Urouge, who seems to be a Sky Person, stay in the story, hell, maybe he's from Skypiea and finds out about the fact Luffy and Co. saved Skypiea from Enel</br>  <br>Not you, maybe. But I'm sure there are plenty of others.</br>  <br> men in heels </br>  <br>I'm not speaking of his fav form, but really his default one, as seen when Franky throw him into the water to un-Monster point him, doing so reverts Chopper to his hybrid form, not his reindeer form.</br>  <br>I don't think he might be from Skypiea. He might have left Birka before Enel wrecked it. Or he might have been some other Sky Island's God's 'disciple', since they're called ''Fallen Monks''. His personality is kinda cool too, just laughing at everything, seemingly a bit more crazy that Luffy.</br>  <br>What is it with Oda and high heels on dudes?</br>  <br> kill Urouge <br> DF makes him buff when he takes damage <br> acquire said DF because it's what the BB crew does <br> BB's weakness is that he takes extra damage from being attacked <br> BB exploits one fruit's weakness as another one's advantage <br> ??? <br> profit </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>either way, I think it'd be nice if he allied with Luffy because he beat the crap out of Enel</br>  <br>pistol high HEEEEEEEL</br>  <br>I honestly can't find that chapter. Do you mean his 'human' form ?</br>  What chapter was it when they lost to someone before the 2 year thingy?  <br>That was kinda what I meant. <br><br><br>It looks cool on him.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> An Ancient animal spirit called a Lichen can turn into crows. <br> mfw Oda starts making mystical monster Zoans. </br></br></br>  <br>It is in the Enies Lobby arc, right after Kumadori jobs</br>  <br>It happens in Enies Lobby.<br>But I'm speaking of his little cute form, which is his hybrid one, his human one is the gorilla-like.</br></br>  <br>Around Chapter 512. That's when Zoro disappeared.<br><br><br> Oda starts making mystical monsters Zoans <br>Isn't the whole idea behind Mythical Zoans ?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw Oda starts making mystical monster Zoans. <br>Mythical Zoans already exist.<br>Marco's phoenix fruit and Sengoku's Daibutsu fruit.<br>There's also two from one of the games.<br>There will surely be more as the manga goes on.</br></br></br></br></br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br><br>BB has 9 fleets?</br></br>  <br>mythical zoans are the fruits im most excited about. logias and paramecia can be cool and all, but mythical zoans are just so much cooler<br><br>normal zoans are shit though</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes, I know when it happened, I just find the specific chapter. Batoto has an Arabasta chapter right in the middle so I think it might have gotten switched. <br><br>And again, it might just be because of convenience. Might be a subconscious thing, being small and trying not to be in anyone's way. Might just be Oda wanting to turn Chopper into a mascot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's hot as fuck.</br>  What other models of the hito hito no mi could exist?<br>Model: Neanderthal?<br>Model: Giant?<br>Model: Fetus?</br></br></br>  <br> normal zoans are shit though <br>I don't know, I think Lucci pulled his off very. very well. So did some of the Vice Admirals, assuming they are normal and DFs.<br><br><br>10, I believe.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It probably is the reason, but I was more looking for a in-universe explaination.</br>  <br>A fetus fruit would probably be the absolutely worst hypothetical fruit to ever exist.</br>  <br> Isn't the whole idea behind Mythical Zoans ? <br><br>Probably. I say the word monster because I think of things that wouldn't exactly be classified as an animal.<br><br>Marco's fruit is probably the best example, since its a mythical creature.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Model: Neko</br>  <br>I really don't want to see a Fetus zoan. <br><br>Maybe they have different Zoans for the different tribes ? Like Long-Armer, Legged, etc ?<br>Maybe Jesus and other various figures like Buddha. Maybe Angels and Demons or even Gods if Oda decides to go that route.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> crawl in tiny spaces <br> play dead, opponents leave you alone <br> choke foes with umblical cord </br></br></br></br>  <br>But it's a bird, it's got wings and shit and it flies. That's all Oda cares about. Buddha was a human, so shit, it checks out. We might get Sasquatch, Yeti, Big Foot and all kinda shit. I mean, most of these 'creatures' resemble an Animal in some way, right ?<br><br><br>I don't think we'll ever get one, to be honest.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I never understood how marco's fruit was supposed to be so rare.<br>Aren't DF's one of a kind anyway? Wouldn't that make his just as rare as chopper's?</br></br>  <br>Maybe there's hope in some SBS who knows.<br>Anyway I'm waiting to see the next SBS because Oda should have received a fucking barrel from some fan community and hasn't talked about it yet.</br></br>  <br>Oh jesus christ, why. It'd probably look like that little shit from Berserk. And it would just freak everyone out so automatic win all around!<br><br>Still a terrible idea though.</br></br></br>  <br> "The fuck is a dead unborn baby doing here?" <br> "This is creepy as shit, I'll pretend I didn't see anything." <br> Suddenly cord around their neck <br> Squeezing way too hard to be able to do anything <br> Look around <br> The last thing they see are the empty eyes of a malformed baby staring right at them as their neck is crushed </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is what nightmares are made of.</br>  <br>It's not rare in that sense. It's rare in the sense that it's a rare ''Type'' of fruit. There are tons of Zoans and Paramecia's around. But a 'Mythical' Zoan is super rare. Rarer than a Logia. Not every Zoan is really that good. So some are going to be more favoured and sought after than others. <br><br><br>I wouldn't hold my breath. I don't think a lot of people care about stuff like that. They might care about what Chopper's bloody penis looks like in all of his forms though. So I guess that's something.</br></br></br></br>  <br>its not each one fruit, its the type. theres fewer mythical zoans than regular zoans, way fewer. thats why theyre so rare</br>  <br>Zoro confirmed for having the same fate as rayleigh</br>  <br>it's only weakness is a coat hanger.</br>  <br>Baby enemies in anything are always the creepiest shit.</br>  <br>I would think because the fruit almost makes you unkillable so it stays with a person longer.</br>  <br>Would it even have the strength to squeeze something ? It's not even a full baby. It would just wrap the cord around someone, people will freak out and faint. Possibly crushing the fetus when they fall.<br><br><br>Oohohohhoho, that's pretty good right there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>'kay</br>  <br>If it's a Zoan, the user can always assume a half-form where they keep their adult strength but still have the cord.<br><br>Dear lord, the mental image I just created is way too unsettling.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Monster point <br> Giant foetus crawling around crushing goons <br> Giant placenta absorbs every living matter it touches <br> Foetus swings it around at targets <br> More nutrients for the foetus when powerful opponents are absorbed </br></br></br></br></br></br>  I miss Rebecca. Five days before Luffy asks her to join the crew.  heres an image to help visualize it<br><br>from witcher 3</br></br>  <br>I told you this was a terrible idea. I dun' told you. Jesus Christ, imagine a fucking half-fetus/half adult abomination choking you with a fucking cord that's tied to your stomach.</br>  <br>A spermathozoa fruit would be GOAT, though.<br> Get old <br> Crawl into pussy <br> Live forever </br></br></br></br>  <br>no chapter next week friend<br><br> rebecca joining </br></br></br>  <br>Penguin is so kawaii ヾ(●ω●)ノ</br>  <br>Okay, thank you for telling me.<br>But no, you aren't my friend, I don't even know you.</br></br>  <br> I'VE GOT YOU NOW! <br> STRAW HAT LUFFY! </br></br>  <br> Missing Rebecca </br>  So how about some other, non disturbing Mythical Zoans, eh ?<br><br>Chimera, Cerberus, Hydra, Medusa, Actual Harpy and so on.

Cyclops would be one too, I'm guessing. Are trolls the same thing ? Gnomes ? Would they even be Zoans ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well you're missing out faggot</br>  <br>So why did LZ take their shit just like that? That scene never make sense to me.

It's gotta be a one-up from other fruits. Like, Marco's resembled a Logia.

I can definitely see Griffin and Sphynx but the Pegasus would be fuckin' hilarious. <br><br>Also, it might be just me but I get a sinking feeling that we may not get Zoans that already semi-exist in the World. Like Impel Down had a lot of 'mythical' animals and Gan Fall kinda had a shitty Pegasus. Maybe just me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I knew Chupacabra's killed goat. <br>yea, a vampiric goat that kills other goats</br></br>  <br>What about Gin though?<br>I'll be very surprised if we ever see him again. Though I guess promises in the real world don't always mean anything either.</br></br>  <br>Oh right, forgot about his lame-ass horse. <br> H-how about Cthulhu? </br></br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chupa<wbr>cabra<br><br>Don't look like no goat I've ever seen. Even for a monster, that's a pretty wild Goat.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>The "mythical" animals on Impel Down were just awakened Zoan users.<br><br>Apparently, unlike Paramecia, awakening a Zoan really fuck you over by permanently turning you into a near-mindless monstrosity.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't really get the point of normal zoan fruits though. They're so boring, whats the difference going to be between a tiger,lion or cheetah DF user of the same skill? Thank god for Ancient and Mythical Zoans.</br>  Just imagine the Tiger is Zoro<br><br><br>He was also dying and taking care of a whole bunch of people and Krieg could have probably just offed him right when he woke up. This was early in the series so I wouldn't be surprised if Oda decided to let him die.<br><br><br> Cthulu <br>I thought Cthulu was water based ?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What chapter was that?</br>  <br> Apparently, unlike Paramecia, awakening a Zoan really fuck you over by permanently turning you into a near-mindless monstrosity. <br>I hope this isn't the case.<br><br>Until shown otherwise I'm of the opinion that the Impel Down guards were awakened prematurely, perhaps by Vegapunk science?<br>This makes them more animalistic but perhaps also more obedient and suitable for justice.<br><br>This really is just something I want to be true.<br>Zoans have really been the worst of the three fruit types during the first half of the grand line.<br>Now we're in the second haki has been a great leveler.<br>What I don't want to happen is for "awakening" to become this even cooler thing that makes logias/paramecias monstrous as fuck but gives zoans only mediocre power boosts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, I don't mean the Mino-Zoans. I mean the little Guards and shit they had. Like they had a 'proper' Sphinx and those little Lion thingies. <br><br>But that being said, how about Unicorns and Minotaurs ?<br><br><br>I guess that's why Oda doesn't use them too much. And the variety can depend on the User too. Lucci having the Cheetah fruit would be way different from Kaku having it, if that makes sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ah : Sometimes I wish the characters who only stuck around for a few arcs actually became Straw Hats.<br><br>Like Vivi or Jimbei or Sanji or Nami or Chopper or Brook.</br></br>  <br> quoting wikipedia <br><br>I think confusing people who report mangy dogs as chupacabra with the actual description.<br><br>can't find anything on it being a goat but it definitely wasnt a dog</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chapter 17, I believe<br><br><br><br>Yea, I'm pretty sure the Zoans in Impel Down is a rare case. Kinda like how humans, when given the power, turn cruel and sadistic and shit if they were Guards in a prison or whatever. The Users probably got warped by every day life or maybe they were Vegapunk's experiments. Artificial Zoans maybe. I don't remember if they had authentic zoans.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just checked the wiki to see if it said something about it being a goat. Then I saw the image and decided I'll just link it.<br><br>And I guess it doesn't really have to be that accurate in One Piece. I think Kaku's Giraffe was a Cow model or something. And Oda could doggy-ffy it maybe. Who knows.</br></br></br>  <br>They are fighting Croc's men so it can't be ch 17</br>  <br>DON<br>No idea what that means though.</br></br>  <br>112</br>  <br>Ahh, my bad, I just looked at the thumbnail. It's actually Chapter 112. Sorry about that.<br><br><br>That's just like an ''exclamation'' kinda sound, I believe. Nothing really specific. I don't know moon though, so I could be wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sanji was never a SH <br> He's just been paying for his ride to All Blue by cooking the SHs 5-star food <br> he'll never be allowed to leave because his food is too good </br></br></br>  <br>Have this. My treat</br>  <br>Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Genie<br>I'd be interested to see what Oda would do with a character who can grant wishes.</br></br>  <br>I always thought it was kinda like "tadam". Although I'm not sure that's an actual expression in English.</br>  <br>He'd be a total scumbag and would only grant wishes in a comical/gag way. It'd be very down-to-earth, as in he can't materialise money out of nowhere and stuff.</br>  <br>Looks a dildo, enel is not a dildo</br>  <br> tfw you thought that Zoro post timeskip didnt smile much but then got your eyes completely opened by the amount he actually smiles and laughs when a kind anon posted the compilation he made for you. </br>  <br>Monkey's paw style? I LIKE it. Oda, please deliver, he can even have a dark past where he didnt want to answer wishes but was enslaved.</br>  <br>Oh hey tripfag. The dildo is actually Urouge's weapon he uses. Its just a big iron pillar sort of thing he hits stuff with.</br>  still no word on 71+ color mangu?  <br>Yea, I love that image. People tend to not see stuff that they specifically don't want to see. Some guys thought Zoro was full serious and doesn't goof off and stuff after the Timeskip but whenever some posts an example, they go all quiet.<br><br><br>No, no, he'd actually already be a slave but would wish, over and over, that his life would get better. And one fateful day, he'd get fed the Genie Fruit for entertainment, except they don't know which fruit it is. They'll be disappointed and he'll escape when Fisher Tiger struck the place. It'd be something along those lines.</br></br></br></br>  <br>did you save? i want to see it</br>  <br> Luffy/Zoro appreciation thread <br> Did you save the picture with Zoro having a good time <br>What are you doing.</br></br></br>  <br>im sorry for doubting<br><br>here have a new one</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_0c<wbr>F2hs50U8</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>R u feeling it</br></br>  <br>Anyone ripped the Toriko digital colored manga yet?</br>  <br>god damn that robin music is arousing</br>  <br>This is a One Piece thread, but didnt know there was colored Toriko?

It doesn't deform you, and I bet the Awakening would be the ability to change the mass of things other than yourself by touching them, thus pretty much making you the literally strongest person in the world. <br><br>The girl with that DF could also counter the blind admiral's DF.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Woah, it's been years since I've heard these. Brook's sounds so heart warming<br><br><br>I will treasure it like the rest, Anon.</br></br></br></br>  Hannyabal was the best Impel Down character, prove me wrong.  <br> doesn't even know "that girl's" name <br> doesn't even know that devil fruit's name <br> doesn't even know "the blind admiral's" name <br><br>What do you read One Piece for?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bluenos DF is so fucking good but he couldnt use it for shit</br>  <br>Ryuuma's sword doesn't look like that and Nami's is kinda golden.<br><br><br>Depends on the limit of the fruits. I don't see how changing the weight of something makes you the strongest person. Just because you can make something heavy doesn't mean you can lift it. Not sure how Ms Valentine can counter Fujitora either. Even if the mass is different, there's constant gravitational pressure on you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Foxy could be so broken after awakening his fruit, just imagine making everything around you getting so slow, he would be like a reverse flash and way better than a "speed" fruit.</br>  <br>Jinbe, Magellan, Iva-chan and Inazuma were pretty cool too.</br>  <br>Speed can work both ways though, right ?</br>  They are third years now, but the guy Kurumi liked was her sempai, so he was at least one year older. Yet he turned into a zombie while being in the school.<br><br>Which means it's been at least 1 year since the zombie outbreak.</br></br>  <br>I'm starting to be annoyed by Cathat's hallucinagenic shenanigans. She's always putting the others in danger as well as her self.</br>  <br>Also. shovel a best.<br><br>A BEST</br></br></br>  <br>Didn't one of the chapters say it had been like a month?</br>  <br>Finally someone who agrees.</br>  <br>Shovel a slut.</br>  Why are the zombies always blurred as shit?<br>Why did they cut Shovel's blood splattered face and uniform?<br><br>I'm not liking the way they're handling the whole zombie killing thing, feels really tame and toned down so far. They also skipped the part with pre-delusion Yuki and the gang holding the door against the zombies. The way the whole zombie senpai things was presented makes no sense here, what the fuck was she doing staring at the campus with a zombie beside her, without even noticing?</br></br></br>  It's very possible senpai-kun-chan-dono was just following what the typical zombies do in this story, which is walk somewhere they feel comfortable or last remembered. He also could have been hiding there in the wake of the outbreak, but got caught up in things and got bit on his way to the roof. It's assumed that there were a bevy more students inside of the school than outside of the school when it began, but Megumi, Yuki, Kurumi, and Yuuri were the only ones who have made it to where they had, and they were clearing out zombies before making that powerful barricade.  <br>Maybe he was just her senpai in the club. He can be still her senpai</br>  <br><br><br>They guy has his sushi roll they are given when they graduate, so the outbreak could have happen when they were about to turn into 3rd years.<br>But in the bottom page she's wearing her PE outfit so they still had classes.<br><br>The problem is, if it's been already a year, how did they survive the winter?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Didn't he turn on the spot?</br></br>  Rii is not bad either  <br>The zombies would have to be censored if they didn't do it this way. <br><br> staring at the campus with a zombie beside her <br>It was a dream right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Winter wouldn't be so bad if they had access to heating the building (especially if they could only heat the rooms they use to conserve power). Otherwise wrap up I guess? It isn't insane to suggest they could've looted some winter clothing</br>  <br>She was only looking at a silouhette she recognized as her senpai. She didn't know if he was actually a zombie or not. It was even implied that the two of them spent a number of days on the rooftop just looking over at the horizon, which lays more credence to "going back to places they remember" idea.</br>  <br>So that they can kill them without thinking of them as humans. It's a part of their coping mechanism. Well it also helps with the censorship as well.</br>  <br>Just like Yuki's delusions are about things being alright, the others' delusions are about things being worse than they really are.<br><br>Also, do zombies have that much blood anyway? I always find it unrealistic when blood splatters like if it was a geyser.</br></br></br>  <br> no mole </br>    did they add stuff to the OP? I don't remember those scenes with the zombies and ruined classroom being in it before.  <br><br>What are you talking about? They were there the entire time.<br><br>You are being delusional again, Anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They were there in the original OP if I recall.</br>  <br>Thank you Mr. T.</br>  <br>Anon, you are not making any sense</br>  I think I've finally cracked why the zombies at the school were responding to the school alert system. <br><br>They follow all of their old memories and instincts blindly and aimlessly until they find a human body to chomp on. However, they seem to follow everything they remembered doing regularly. They went into the school because the rain would soak their clothes. They responded to the various school broadcasts because one might mean "Time to go home", so they would start heading home. One might've meant to head to fire drill locations, so they will auto-pilot their way to the fire drill locations. The meat-eating monsters they turned into seem to simply be running automatically, and they bite humans because they are EXTREMELY hungry and don't know anything else to eat.<br><br>It would also explain why they keep running after glowsticks and loose change, because those are some little commodities that a normal person might pick up and return to someone else, or they themselves might pocket.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the zombies would have much more problems surviving the winter.<br><br>Has any zombie story deal with snow?</br></br></br>  So how is the adaptation so far from someone who as read the manga, no spoiler pls.<br><br>Also is it heavily censored?</br></br>  <br><br>Dead Snow, those were nazi zombies that rose from the snow.<br><br>Never watched it tho.</br></br></br></br>  <br>World War Z had entire chapters about frozen zombies and winter survival scenarios.</br>  <br>World War Z explained it well. <br> Zombies go to a snowy location, as in FREEZING snow <br> Zombies aren't weatherproofed against it, so most of them, at minimum, are slowed down dramatically <br> A large number of them, and eventually all of them, freeze up and their bodies are just corpsicles until the weather changes <br> Those unfortunate enough to shamble into regions like Russia or float into Alaska periodically defrost and wander into areas thought to be cleared, or bite/infect people who get snagged on an exposed jaw or hand </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not as much censorship as it is cutting off the violent parts.</br>  <br><br>Dumbledore dies.</br></br>  <br>The only reason zombies would struggle with snow is mobility. The ones in GG are very clumsy, giving humans an even bigger advantage. Although snow would make more noise as humans walked over it</br>  <br>That's not really a valid example as the Nazis there were more like revenants (physical ghosts hellbent on revenge) than actual zombies.</br>  <br>Senpai in track club, not senpai in year.</br>  <br> They are third years now, but the guy Kurumi liked was her sempai, so he was at least one year older.  <br><br>sempai in the track club =/= higher grade</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think they'd live to see the winter. They'd run out of stuff to eat eventually. Winter would only make that harder I guess.</br>  <br>Winter zones are amongst the worst for humanity, as most of them would simply freeze and lay in wait indefinitely until anything that would defrost them, causing a second or third or fourth outbreak with every new spring.</br>  Shovel is impure.<br>Miki is a slut.</br>  <br> defrost and start moving again <br><br>Have them heard of frozen water crystals breaking the meat? Their flesh and bones shouldn't have the strength to hold them standing</br></br></br>  <br><br>He was graduating though, he's holding his diploma tube in the scene</br></br>  <br> The ones in GG are very clumsy, giving humans an even bigger advantage <br>One wonders how in a whole school with facilities prepared for a zombie outbreak, only a group of little girls survived.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, even if we disregard zombies decomposing, henceforth stopping being operational in less than a week, freezing does damage to the tissues.</br>  I've only read a few chapters (gonna try to catch up soon), but am I interpreting this correctly:<br><br>  Megu-Nee doesn't really exist, therefore Yuki is at least on a subconscious level aware of the zombie outbreak?  </br></br>  <br><br>Do you think Miki would've gone down on that guy if given the chance?</br></br>  <br>Most stories that do don't have the zombies turn into minutely shredded meat due to frostbite. Which is fair enough, because it would be a very short zombie apocalypse.</br>  <br>The same way only Miki and Kei survived the second outbreak of their group, they were on the roof with only one door to hold and one zombie to kill.</br>  <br>That's not necessarily true, the outbreak could have happened right around graduation, so a month or two at most</br>  <br>No shit, like most people with PTSD she is aware of her surroundings on some level.</br>  <br>What were they doing on the roof with Shovel? Was he getting back to the school sometimes to hump her once or twice? Maybe it was during class period so they could spend an hour on the roof, that's the only logical answer.</br>  <br>How is her vision of "ghosts" not a sign of awareness of the situation already?</br>  <br>You mean the leader of their group? Kei was more into him, and so where the other girls. She just didn't know how to deal with a drunkard.</br>  <br> Skipping school to go shopping <br> Doesn't reject drunkard's advances <br> Wears Garterbelt <br>She would've gone all the way with him if her shitty friend didn't butt in.</br></br></br></br>  <br> It would also explain why they keep running after glowsticks and loose change, because those are some little commodities that a normal person might pick up and return to someone else, or they themselves might pocket. <br><br>Please. So if I throw a pantsu to the floor, the male zombies will go for it? Lights and noises, nothing else.</br></br></br>  <br>Correct. <br><br> Megumi wanted Yuki to experience happiness amid the hell that was a zombie apocalypse, so she implanted herself deep within Sakura's conscious mind and buried her vision of what the world was really like inside of a fantastical world where everything was perfect.  <br><br> This delusion fades periodically and it absolutely devastates Yuki until she comes back to her happyland.  <br><br> Megu-nee existed at one point, but she died protecting all of the Gakkous. <br><br> You can assume, knowing this genre, that it isn't the last we see of Megumi. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The problem is, if it's been already a year, how did they survive the winter? <br><br>It's been less than a year, this episode takes place before summer and japanese schools end around like March, so more like three months.</br></br></br>  <br>She'll redeem herself eventually.</br>  <br>They need to know that you've thrown it. Pantsu don't make a sound when they hit the ground. Coins do. Glowsticks do.</br>  <br>I've never been to a war so I wouldn't know<br><br>which vision do you mean?</br></br></br>  <br>People sometimes go back to school for club and stuff like that. Didn't the keions go to their clubroom after they graduated to p̶l̶a̶y̶ ̶m̶u̶s̶i̶c̶ hangout with Azunyan?</br>  <br>Was she wearing the garterbelt before the outbreak or she got it then?</br>  <br>It's still time for humans to regroup and fortify themselves. Of course, contingent on technology level; the cold could be just as deadly.<br><br><br>Shovel said being a manager wouldn't suit her, and managers usually serve as cumdumps for the entire club in doujins. She's pure.<br><br><br>These are the same people who deny that zombies decay from exposure even as said zombies' skin sloughs off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean her knowing that ghosts are to be avoided in general. That might have been badly worded.</br>  <br> &gt;Doesn't reject drunkard's advances <br>She was obviously being bothered by it, take your slut-googles off.</br></br>  <br>Tan Shovel is even better.</br>  Which Gakkou would you Gurashi?  <br>Speculated by a character in World War Z, that ice ruptures cells in humans, so why doesn't it happen to zombies? Never answered though. Zombies gonna zomb</br>  <br>The zombie in library for example.</br>  <br> knowing that ghosts are to be avoided in general <br>Well shit, isn't that just common sense among little girls?</br></br>  <br>Fuck: Kurumi, Yuuri<br>Marry: Megu-Nee, Yuki<br>Kill: Miki</br></br></br>  <br>Not even ice can fuck with Tengen Toppa Solanum.</br>  <br>I want to marry Yuuri.</br>  <br>muh bruder</br>  <br>Humans tire and get careless. An alert human can easily deal with one zombie, but when you are up against a lot (early stages before they disperse) and are tired it's easy to slip up. And zombie outbreaks are essentially perma hell and hell difficulty</br>  I wonder if they're going to remove  Megu-nee on the letter? .<br>That was a nice subtle touch that Yuki did know deep down. It'd be a shame if they changed it.</br>  <br>Yuuri for second of every minute of every hour of every day of every week of every year for the rest of my life</br>  This is Miki.  She is Nuclear.   <br>Miki.</br>  <br>REMOVE DOG</br>  <br>All of them, at the same time.</br>  <br>You mean the we are daijoubu drawing?<br><br>BTW, in the manga, she only drew the 3 girls without megu-nee.</br></br></br>  <br><br> She is standing on the edge </br></br>     wasting water washing off your shovel <br><br>Shovel pls</br></br>  <br>You fucking ESL retard, I put that in spoilers for a reason. Yes, I've read the manga, I'm wondering about future anime original changes.<br><br>Serious advice here - kill yourself!</br></br></br>  <br>Enjoy your bacterial growths. She uses it for gardening remember</br>  <br>Is water limited? Seemed like all the taps and things worked.</br>  <br> Not cleaning parts of your body just because you it's not always in use <br><br>Might as well cut your dick off right now.</br></br></br>  <br>They have an unlimited supply.</br>     steppen king <br>Heh</br>  <br>Stay mad, autistic spic.</br>  <br><br>http://pastebin.com/xKr64Qre<br>http://pastebin.com/8rz8gEUM<br>http://pastebin.com/hgr2a3ZL<br><br>Don't remember in which link it is but they have unlimited water supply</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope. They got water purifiers, solar panels, a vegetable garden and all manner of resources  the school was sponsored by the same company who manifactured the virus, and was a hidden survival-shelter location in case of outbreak </br>  Is the final twist going to be that Yuki is actually the only sane person and acting as a doctor in a mental asylum while the others are all fantasizing about all that stuff?  <br><br>What of it?</br></br>  <br>In Walking Dead the zombies just freeze until it gets warmer again. They don't die because they don't drink (much) water, so the ice crystals don't destroy their brain and muscles.</br>  <br><br>I hope not</br></br>  <br>Where did you get that info from?</br>  <br> Skipping school <br>She wasn't, it got out early. The other girls were still there for club activities.<br><br><br>Before.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If that'd be so then  said doctor would slowly be turning crazy like her patients </br>    <br><br/></br>  <br> Inb4 Yuki is   actually a patient in an asylum and all this is her delusions <br> &gt;Miki, Kurumi, Rii-san, and her sister visit her on occasion, but they can't bear to see her like this </br></br>  3) Strains<br>Written below are the strains of research up until XXX Year XX Month.

I've not read the pastebins yet. Are they from untranslated manga or something?</br>  <br><br>They are extras anon<br><br>Link 3 has the outbreak info.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At the end of the volumes there's a load of extra stuff like maps of the school and all that.</br>  Would you watch it?  <br>What was the deal with this soldier guy anyway? Why did he crash?</br>  <br>Hell no.</br>  <br>REMOVE DRUG ADDLED CAT GIRL<br>On a more serious note, since they didn't send out the balloons how is the helicopter pilot going to know to look for life before he turns?</br></br>  <br>I think we need to make an image macro for this question.</br>  <br><br> Maybe </br></br>  <br>Said a hundred times already, he probably was infected before he did the mission, the disease took over faster than he thought and he couldn't use the syringe before crashing.</br>    <br>Infected and on the vaccine, as symptoms started to kick in again he tried taking another dose but crushed the syringe instead, turning zombie and crashing the helicopter.</br>  <br> didn't <br>They just haven't yet. They just found the balloons which means next episode they're getting the helium.</br></br>  <br>Are his companions alive in the base?</br>  <br>Concentration of best girls too high.</br>  <br>For yume best girl is clearly student council president though.<br><br>Yea good point, it keeps fucking with me since the order of certain events is so muddled</br></br></br>  <br>It isn't shown, so it's unknown. But it would make more sense that the base is fucked.</br>  <br>He was bitten, he got an injection of vaccine and needed to repeat the operation every once in a while in order to keep from turning. Pretty sure the "companions" are alrighty.</br>  <br>I want to fulfill Kurumi's dream.</br>  <br>We actually saw them opening the case with the drawing.</br>    <br> buying shovel from Kurumi-chan <br>Striping away their ability to survive?<br><br><br>I believe bloods shown in ep2 are pretty fresh.<br><br><br>..don't forget they live there.<br><br><br>shop name written on the image.

That's why I said "pretty sure".<br>Everything was fine in the school until the helicopter came out of the blue and crashed down the party.</br></br>    <br> But it would make more sense that the base is fucked. <br>Not really, they show the letters being examined by people in hazmat suits in a lab.<br><br><br> and needed to repeat the operation every once in a while in order to keep from turning <br>[citation needed]<br>There's been literally no evidence that the drug needs to be used more than once and that the pilot wasn't simply bitten searching for survivors earlier in the mission.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That actually still doesn't make sense to me. How did the helicopter crashing in the parking lot cause so much damage overall?<br>I mean even the fucking vegetable garden on the roof got completely destroyed, how the hell did that happen?</br></br>  <br>Well, this is just a guess. Your hypothesis could be just as right.</br>  <br>According to anime ep2, "summer is coming", so it will be at/before July. On the other hand, Japanese semester start April. This is hardly a year. btw, since Yuki back to her classroom at 3-A and able to relate things left there with people face, I suppose that mean It is after April? Or were all the human face simply imagination?</br>  <br> btw <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  They should have really added a male in the group, Who else can please Megu-nee?  <br>I don't remember exactly, but it caused a big fire and zombies also spread fire themselves. I believe cars exploded too.</br>  <br><br> a male in the group </br></br>  It'll be interesting to see if Kurumi has any other zombie properties. They ignore her (until she makes lots of noise, is colder than normal and it seems like the area where she got bit isn't healing at all). Could she infect people with bites, and if so how quickly would they turn compared to normal?  <br>Why would you please an illusion?</br>  <br>So I haven't been paying much attention but.. Does Yuki's Cat hat ears always turn to face the viewer? Kind of like Mickey Mouse.</br>  <br>She's not an illusion tho.</br>  <br>Wait, do the others know that she got bit?</br>  <br>Just read the OP animation<br><br><br>They still haven't yet discover the storehouse as of anime timepoint<br><br><br>Re-translation?<br><br><br>I believe this is a working way to use English as dictionary include this entry?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah they do. It sounds like  fwff </br>  Miki is a pure maiden and I want to marry her  <br><br><br><br>BROTHERS</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> maiden </br></br>  <br> &gt;I believe this is a working way to use English as dictionary include this entry? <br>Shut the fuck up, you autistic spic.</br></br>  <br>What zombies anon? Everyone knows there's no such thing as zombies</br>  <br>Others as in the girls? Of course. Do you not remember the chapters where Yuuri was prepared to kill her and Miki went to get the antidote? Although it's questionable whether Yuki has noticed (although she does at one point comment about Kurumi feeling cold)</br>  <br><br>Shut up Yuki</br></br>  <br> Sluts making out </br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=FqN<wbr>QbdD3kLw</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> Ayaya <br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YV<wbr>gR3hEXuU4</wbr>  [ ] </br></br>    <br>Still my favourite zombie movie to date. You can never go wrong with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost</br>    <br>It's super effective</br>  I've completely forgotten vast swathes of the manga.<br><br>Were Kei and Miki skipping school? Is that why they were at the mall?</br></br>  <br><br>They've come a long way</br></br>  <br>No, school ended, but it was nice out so they went to the mall instead of going home.</br>  <br>No visible bite marks, why the fuck would he get out and I don't think he would wait before injecting himself. If no one makes an image for the heli crash I will, but later.</br>  <br>And people say there's no subtext.</br>  <br>It's just the same people that say that for every Kirara series.</br>  <br><br>Really long way</br></br>  <br> There's been literally no evidence that the drug needs to be used more than once and that the pilot wasn't simply bitten searching for survivors earlier in the mission. <br>It seems to me that the entire point of the crash (aside from forcing the girls to move base) is to show that the cure isn't permanent, meaning kurumi will have to find more or die</br></br>  <br>Is there an /a/ edit yet?</br>    <br> inb4    Suckerpunch  </br>    <br><br>S-stop reminding me.</br></br>  <br><br>Sorry anon</br></br>  <br>That's probably the goriest page of the manga now that I think about it<br><br>And the first indication that Kurumi now has zombie strength</br></br></br>  How different do you guys think that the anime's timeline is different from the manga's? I know people say that  megu-nee and dog are illusions so it takes place after they both died,  but I think they just altered it so that miki and dog are there at the start.  Megu-nee is gonna die in episode 3 though.   <br>Yup. Well, the other 2 do, who can tell with Yuki?<br><br>As for Shovel's zombie powers... She was standing motionless, so maybe they're visual acuity is based on movement, like T-Rex. Or maybe the antibodies from the infection or whatever put her in the zombie blind spot, so long as she doesn't agitate them. As for being cold, who knows?<br><br>Being some kind of human-zombie hybrid seems like such an ass-pull, though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Megu-nee is clearly already dead though, there is so much evidence showing she isn't actually there</br>  What is your opinion about the latest development?<br> who's going to get cornered by helmet gang and be "almost" raped before it's a close call? </br>  <br>Imagine just going to class together with Yuki and then suddenly masturbating in front of her illusions. Shit would be so fucking funny.</br>  I don't even understand anymore,  is Megu-nee alive at the beginning of the manga?   <br>Miki. <br>But they'll stop once they realize that he's a boy.</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Marry Garter<br>Fuck Twintails<br>Befriend Nekomimi Hat<br>Adopt Ahoge<br>Ignore Old hag</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The dog definitely isn't an illusion since everyone is interacting with it independently of Yuki's prompts, the others have even held him.</br>  <br> Character development <br> IT MUST BE YURI <br>fuck off</br></br></br>  <br>No</br>  Are there links for the 36 and 37 scans? I can't find them in the archive.<br> admittedly i suck at using the archive </br>  <br>Not Kurumi at least. She could easily kill one with the shovel now.<br><br><br>You're an idiot. And I don't feel like arguing.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, she's still moving.<br><br>I hope that answers your question.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Your post doesn't make any sense.</br>  <br><br>Yuki<br> but crossbow-kun is going to save her <br><br> I bet the uni girls are working with the helmet guys </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dog is live, but Megu-nee is totally dead</br>  <br>Megu-nee is dead as fuck since episode 1 even tomarou isn't.</br>  <br> dog has a funeral hat like deceased/ghosts do <br><br>subtle.</br></br></br>    <br>Nah, helmet's are the heroes that are going to save the girls from the evil uni girls<br><br><br>They were on a test of courage anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Who is going to kill the dog if Megu-nee is already dead?</br></br>  <br>Can someone add a leash to her collar/choker?<br>Or make Yuki look like a zombo?</br></br>  <br/>  <br>probably miki</br>  <br>The dog will probably stay around the rest of the anime to be yuki's little buddy. Plus no one wants to see that cute dog die</br>  Could Rii be healed by  long, thick and hard megacocks?    before anime <br> nobody ever talks about the manga <br><br> now <br> GG generals 24/7 repeating everything that has ever been said about this series <br><br>Which was better?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That scene was so damn satisfying. I didn't want to see a girl die yet. To start the bloodshed so early would have meant that the manga was going down the edgy road.</br>  <br>It's on the sekrit madokami page dude</br>  <br>They're on Godoka.</br>  <br>It always happens anon,  it's always worse. </br>  What's wrong with Nyarlko's eyes? Does a japanese cold do this to you?  Her disease distracts her from maintaining a human form. In the novels she actually transforms to a more alien form and is instead forced to use several illusions in order to distract onlookers.

They fucking told us this is what was going on before. Who the fuck is directing this? Why didn't they just follow the Manga and make the big reveal happen RIGHT HERE at this moment instead of spoiling it before? <br><br>If I didn't already know what was happening and how it was supposed to play out, I would be confused as fuck as to what just happened. It barely acknowledges it as an important reveal.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Look at the opening, it's full of spoiler. They screwed all the suprise moment.</br>  <br>nichifags</br>  <br>They remind me a lot of Kota Hirano.<br><br>Seems like the basic premise was just "Seras Victoria is a highschool student"</br></br></br>  <br>I haven't read the manga and I don't understand whats so confusing</br>  <br> Why didn't they just follow the Manga and make the big reveal happen RIGHT HERE at this moment <br><br>The manga also does the reveal earlier.</br></br></br>  <br>That reveal was basically limped-dick failure<br><br><br>It shows her at a control panel, there is no mention of her being inside that body's head.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The only thing that might not make sense to anime-only folks is them not showing who originally made the ultra-spicy choux cremes.</br>  <br>And this is the big reveal in the manga. Truly a great scene that the anime ruined.<br><br><br> is them not showing who originally made the ultra-spicy choux cremes. <br>They do at the end of the episode.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No wonder when they made voicesin anime even worse than in manga</br>  <br><br><br>this joke is becoming more and more boring since everyone use it.</br></br></br>  <br> And this is the big reveal in the manga.

This is the last scene of chapter 4.</br></br>  <br>Why everybody hates this one so much? I haven't read the source material but  I like it </br>  <br>Shitposting.</br>  <br>not him, but it shit all over the manga reveal.<br>The point of the manga reveal is that it was her character chapter. The entire chapter focused on her and her being discovered.<br><br>The anime had it as a side-reveal for a side-character to romcom humor. That's pretty much the anime so far: Fuck the interesting parts we need more romcom humor.</br></br></br></br>  <br> They fucking showed Alium at her control panel inside her outer body BEFORE she jumped out in the classroom.  <br>But someone who hasn't read the manga would have no idea that that control panel was for her outer body.</br></br>  <br>it zoomed into her head</br>  I actually liked the first two episodes.<br><br>Has this "amateur but well-made" feeling to it.</br></br>  <br> flopped on 4chan, flopped on 2chan, flopped on youtube <br>What the fuck does that even mean?</br></br>  <br> &gt;flopped on 4chan, flopped on 2chan, flopped on youtube <br>POPULARITY</br></br>  <br>Since when it's good thing here? Small threads are better, you dickhead.</br>  <br>There is a story in the bible that's scarily relevant to that.</br>  <br>FLOP = No season 2</br>  <br>Sometimes success doesn't guarentee second season either. Besides it was obvious since studio was announced.</br>  <br>??<br>TMS did the second season of the FUJOSHI Bike anime (forgot the name)</br></br>  <br>Rolling Girls?</br>  <br><br>Yowapeda and yes, recently their only successful shows are only thanks to fujo sales.</br></br>  the preview of the episode 03 is out: http://jitsuwata.tv/story/ <br><br>(Pic related)</br></br>  Rock Lee probably found a ninja prostitute.  <br> he made salada start acting Sakura more <br>But she was always meant to be a combination of Sauce and Sakura.</br></br>  <br>You deserved one reply.</br>  <br>Natural instinct, you're biologically programed to want happy consensual sex for the sole purpose of procreation. It's why we all exist</br>  <br>Because summoning is so hard right? Heck even Jiraiya was embarrassed at how shit Naruto was at the start. Naruto could only summon the boss of the toads(under the fox's power) and small frogs/tadpoles. Not to mention the summon may not even listen to you plus they can get hurt unlike AOE elemental jutsu, the AOE elemental jutsu are much more reliable.</br>  <br>Bort would utterly destroy part 1 nardo. Sorry anon.<br><br><br> We don't know if he gets the chidori <br>It's most likely a Chidori variant. Sauce knew plenty before going full DARKNESS and whatever Bort uses it looks like he throws it like a javelin. It might actually be a literal lightning bolt.</br></br></br></br></br>   piss joke <br>Are they fucking serious?</br>  Its called comedic relief.  <br>When was it?<br>I don't remember single thing from this piece of shit.</br></br>  <br>First episode.

This manga is amazing. Funny and Lewd as hell, yet /a/ hardly ever sees it. Fuck It all  <br><br>I don't know man.

The art is interesting in its own right, though.<br><br><br>Do a TLR.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Do a TLR. <br>Thought so. Might as well read the manga while I wait.</br></br>  I just started reading since everyone says Prison School is one of the top ecchi manga ever. Read the first 6 chapters so far and it's barely been ecchi at all. I think people are exaggerating when they say it's borderline porn.  <br>I thank whatever merciful god put that voice in those situations</br>  <br>I prefer this kind of censorship. White glare censorship means that there's good shit drawn there, smaller less significant censorship is when there's smaller less insignificant shit to censor. BD's are gonna make this worth watching again</br>  KanaHana really impressed me.  <br>gr8 b8 m8</br>    <br>Well hurr maybe you should keep reading<br> It gets heavier </br></br>  <br>I had my doubts at first but she really fits the character</br>  <br>The pacing was okay if not excellent, that remind me of gag manga biyori pacing</br>  So how shit is it?  <br>Did they skip Gakutos sacrifice? Also I like that Hana has piss themed lipstick.</br>  <br>184 on yomanga is shit. The quality is poor, and misssing some pages, so you better read it from previous thread in the archive</br>  <br>Not to mention they even fucking left an entire speech bubble blank because they didn't know what goes there. Its obvious they are taking koreanbros tls.</br>   Hanazawa Kana is the VA for Hana <br><br>MOTHER FUCKER. I KNEW IT SOUNDED EXACTLY THE SAME AS EVERYTHING ELSE I HEARD HER VA BEFORE.</br></br>  <br>Exactly, they were taking wrong tranlsations.<br>The other Korean bro did it better.</br></br>  <br>They did it from the first thread is why</br>  <br>new PS 184 is here [from Korean] </br>  Because of this manga I want to see more girls get pissed on.  <br>Next episode is going to be great.</br>  <br>Yes it is</br>  Assman's voice is probably the biggest disappointment. For such a based character in the manga, he comes off as really flat in the anime. <br><br>Besides that the show is great. Definitely not the trainwreck /a/ was expecting.</br></br>  <br>I love how Assman makes everything so dramatic.</br>  <br>i've forgotten how great the scenes are with Mari constantly discovering chairman's pictures everytime she tries to have a serious talk with him</br>  <br>Mari is the best</br>  <br>Why would you be excited for that part.</br>  <br>Because its funny faggot</br>  Is it okay that I skipped the arc where the new student council put the underground student council in prison? It looked like an excuse to fill the plot with some ecchi  <br> IT SOUNDED EXACTLY THE SAME AS EVERYTHING ELSE I HEARD HER VA BEFORE. <br><br>The fuck? She sounds like an angry and crazier Sakura Ichiko, but that's all.</br></br></br>  <br> gag manga biyori <br>I was thinking exactly the same thing. The lightning pace just makes it better.</br></br>  <br> Skipping Andrenomics <br>No</br></br>    <br>the part where he abuses vice pres? then the arc where nobrows falls in love or something? I skipped the part where MC somehow gets back into prison</br>  <br> Skipping anything <br> Okay </br></br>  <br>I hope she was satisfied.</br>  <br>She isn't, that's only the begining...</br>  <br><br>Is Darth Nihilus satisfied after a meal? <br><br>No, he only wants more.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this is the same guy who colored Momo?</br>  <br><br>No idea, found the image on google.</br></br>  ATX version is censored too?  <br>Yup</br>  <br>It's a shame the underground student council didn't get beaten as much as the boys did, it would have been nice to see.</br>  <br>Hana best girl.</br>   Utoptia slacking off again   I've been meaning to read Prison School for sometime, /a/, figure I should start today.<br><br>What should I expect?</br></br>  <br>Yea their site has been down for days too, who fucking knows.</br>  <br>Erections from seeing bottles<br>Pee-fetish<br>Your sides transcending this plane of existance.<br>Believing that Hana is best girl</br></br></br></br>  <br> pee-fetish <br>Uh, man.<br><br>I hope it's done in a funny way, at least.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm joking about the first two, although some people have said they developed as such. The Hana pee stuff is funny, I assure you</br>   PURI-PURIZUN AI NO PRISUN   <br>Wait for Bluray version which starting from october,[when the anime finish] and every next month</br>  <br><br>Why don't you read and find out?<br><br>What's with people coming into these threads thinking they are Q&amp;A sessions of FAQs?<br><br>Not only do you annoy people by asking the same damn questions thread after thread, but this is also probably the worst way to find information.<br><br>You can read summaries, glance at the tags, watch PVs, browse the archives, and so forth to find out everything you want. Again, this place is not for establishing what happens in the manga/anime for the nth time, but having a conversation about something we've all seen/read.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The overwhelmingly majority you should already know are shitposts.</br>  <br><br>A lot of them are easy to spot, but there are people who I feel are genuinely interested, and don't mean to bother people, but end up doing so anyway, and it's really easy to avoid this by spending 2 mins on google.</br></br>  <br>You know we're still in this part right ? The prez is still in prison at this point.</br>  <br>im playing around with my balls<br>and your post made me what so hard that i pulled them<br>it hurts</br></br></br>  <br>I don't really care about pee itself I just like seeing Hana degraded.</br>  <br>I'd prefered if the episode ended with her scream. the few seconds of explanation after could fit at the start of the new episode</br>  <br>It's pretty bad. Censorship aside which is to be expected, the character designs and animation feel so flat and stiff compared to the manga's layers of shadows and dynamic poses. The music is also uninspiring and does not fit the mood of the scenes. As was said before, the pacing is way too fast. The manga at least has transition panels to imply the passage of time, but the anime seems fast because there are too few breaks in dialogue to allow for montages and other transitions. Voice acting is pretty good though especially Hana and Gakuto, but the principal is underwhelming. All in all it's a faithful adaption, but JC Staff brings nothing to the table to make it special.</br>  <br>Wait, is Hana actually going commando?<br><br>What is she doing with Kiyoshi's underwear then?</br></br></br>  <br>Wearing it. Like a boss.</br>  <br><br>JC STAFF = BASED.</br></br>  <br>So why isn't it poking out?<br><br>Is she like stuffing it in her ass?</br></br></br>  <br>Title page says it all</br>  <br> Kiyoshi comments on how can't see them underneath <br>The very first page shows the shorts rolled up tight into her ass</br></br>  <br>Literally everything on there is shit except Railgun, Toradora, and Utena.</br>  <br>How weak is he to get overpowered by a little girl like hana? She restrained both his hands above his head with one hand. How?</br>  <br>She's a karate champion or something</br>  <br>I really, really hope the manga doesn't delve into scat.<br>I was okay with the whole peeing thing, but I don't think scat would be okay.</br></br>  <br>We don't have to worry about that, girl's don't poop.</br>  <br>Please no skid marks.</br>  <br>More like he's not really fighting back because he's already in a bunch of trouble. Remember Hana was willing to lie about the shed falling down. So who knows what she'd say if he fought back</br>  <br><br>Huh, guess you are right.</br></br>  Why wouldn't Hana just take off the underwear?<br><br>Wouldn't that be much more comfortable?</br></br>  <br>Indirect sex.<br>Kinda like an indirect kiss but with more sex</br></br>  <br>She got used to it, shes jealous of the headband, its probably rubbing her happy spot.</br>  <br> Indirect sex. </br>  chapter 183 and 184 where?  <br>183 i don't think you can find it in the archieve, but 184 - just find the link in this thread.<br>Click settings and chose FIND then type: prison 184</br></br>  <br>Yomanga or achive.</br>  <br> tfw she cums on it <br><br>I really wonder what the next conversation will be. How exciting.<br><br>Maybe Hana will lose the race and be comforted. Who knows.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>thanks, found 183, can anyone post me link to 184 chapter (archive if needed) please,<br>thank you!</br></br></br>  <br>Just go to yomanga, it's on the homepage, right as you click on it.</br>  <br> gonna need a webm of the not having permission to sumo stomp bit. <br> &gt;&gt; <br><br>I haven't read the manga and so far I'm loving the anime. I think the seiyuus are doing an amazing job. So far there isn't much to be censored so I have no complaints on that sense. How many chapters per episode is it adapting?</br></br></br></br>  <br> <br><br><br>link is above for 184. But where did you find 183?</br></br></br></br>  <br>So far its been 6 per episode. I can see some episodes having more or theres gunna be some shit cut out if they plan on ending it where everyone thinks they will.</br>  there's some guy who make wikia for PS http://prison-school.wikia.com/wiki<wbr>/Chapter_12</wbr>  I watched episode 1 and dropped. I don't see how people think this kind of shit is good nor even remotely entertaining.  <br> Kiyoshi continually refuses to urinate despite her struggle to remove his hands from his trouserbelt and her attempts to lock his arms down <br><br>Pretty good. Who reads chapter summaries instead of chapters though?</br></br></br>  <br>Try a little harder anon-kun.<br><br>You'll get more replies if you try shitposting with a little more passion.</br></br></br>  do you think hana and kiyoshi might try something better in the future?  <br>Sorry, I just wanted to give my opinion. There's nothing passionate about this.</br>  <br>With the piss thing over itll be as good as hand holding intensifies was or better.</br>  <br><br>You know the future is now when people start having sex without touching each other.</br></br>  <br><br>Probably not in the near future. Their four major meetings were pretty far apart, and we just had the futon scene.<br><br>They might interact during the cavalry battle, but after that we'll probably have to wait for a while.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Indirect sex. <br><br>Mail the mangaka, I want this joke in the series.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, that was epic, hana wasn't even embarrased at all, she achieved her goal. Well I ship good for them, she is better candidate than Chiyo</br>  <br>Do you mean in relation to the manga or just as a whole?

Am I on to something here?</br>  <br>I don't think so bruh.</br>  What does going to the school even do, that shit doesn't make any god damn sense.<br><br>Why couldn't the police just kidnap people outside of school anyway, who's even funding that shit?<br><br>Am I just retarded and I missed everything?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Pizza sauce  is the true secret behind everything.</br>  What a terrible episode.  I didn't ask for these feels.  <br> Solid episode <br>Wow, you are really have shit taste.<br>Why don't you off yourself?</br></br></br>  <br>i didn't feel anything</br>  <br> If he actually loved her, he wouldn't, or shouldn't be able to let go. <br> guy decides to let go of the girl he loves in 30s <br><br>Consider the following:<br>First off, it wasn't just 30 seconds, it was something he already experienced when she passed away, when he was able to meet her again he should have known that there was a good possibility that their reunion wouldn't last forever, so he probably already knew deep inside that he would have to say goodbye to her once again. <br><br>Also, just because you love someone doesn't mean you can't let them go. Or does that mean none of our parents love us since they let us fend for ourselves when we're of age? When you really love someone, you should feel conflicted in these situations, yes, but at the same time ultimately I believe people would choose the option that would be best for their loved one, which in this case is exactly what happened.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> &gt;guy decides to let go of the girl he loves in 30s <br><br>He only felt frustration for not being able to tell her how he felt at the time and also a lot of guilt.</br></br></br>  <br>Must be a influential person that holds a lot of power that the scientists can't touch them once they are enrolled in the school.</br>  This further reinforces the notion that Nao only forces dangerous people to transfer to the school.<br><br>I wonder if she did that to speedbro.</br></br>  WE NEED TO FIND THE PENGUINDRUM!  <br>Kanba please.</br>  I hope the idol slut doesn't bring the show down.<br><br>She better get possessed by interesting people all the time because her default personality is boring.</br></br>  Holy shit, this is the biggest trainwreck I've seen in years. Disregarding for a moment the nonsense plot, the whole directing is completely rubbish. No sense of flow, no aesthetics, it's just random pandering scenes pieced together in a desperate attempt to make some money from the degenerate otaku. Don't even get me started on all the bloom and blur, the terrible CGI, all the forced animation, etc.<br><br>ＦＵＣＫＩＮＧ　ＤＲＯＰＰＥＤ</br></br>  <br>If I'm not wrong, she can only get possessed by her sister.</br>  <br>That whole seen was a laughable attempt at "drama" and "feelz", which is probably indicative of where this whole show is going anyways.</br>  <br>SEIZON SENRYAKU</br>  <br>This is exactly what Angel Beats felt like. Maeda has fucking lost it.</br>  <br>BUZZWORDS</br>  <br>Not subtle enough with your buzzwords, 3/10 for using wide text.</br>  <br> thumb not between her pointer and middle finger <br>Damn it.<br><br><br>0/10<br>Next time put forced animation further up, so I can disregard everything else in the post and not waste my time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What I enjoy the most out of this post is that you could literally post it in any other anime's thread and it would fit.<br>Good use of buzzwords, 8/10.</br></br>  <br>Is this post serious.<br><br> No sense of flow. <br>You're just spouting random nonsense here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If he makes something that sells 40k units again like Angel Beats then assuredly for some people he has not lost it.</br>  <br><br>It's meant to emulate the pacing of an eroge, you guys just don't get it.</br></br>    <br>Either way, it's pretty much failing at doing a good job.</br>  am i kawaii uguu  <br>Your standards seem awfully high for chinese cartoons.</br>  <br>OTP</br>  <br>Time and Comets. Something about once every few hundred years.</br>  <br>Punch Line set the bar high.</br>  <br>inb4 that anon is 30yo and actually still lives with his parents.</br>  Shouldn't we be using the subs thread?  <br> Punch Line </br>  <br>That's actually some really fucking poor phrasing. Ability to channel the dead would sound better. The subs for the whole episode felt off. A lot of it sounded like a direct word for word translation.</br>  <br>Yes, you are retarded and missed everything. Do you even X-Men?</br>   4U   <br> The subs for the whole episode felt off. A lot of it sounded like a direct word for word translation. <br><br>They got really bad in the second half, the "feels" scene was horribly subbed.</br></br></br>  Isn't it more likely that this is not a special ED and that every character just gets their own?  <br>That would be nice.<br><br>By the way, is there any other character left to be introduced? No? All right, should start getting more interesting now.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty good pasta.<br>Saved.<br><br><br>This one is doing its job fine. It's keeping the shitposters from the other thread.</br></br></br></br></br>  Meh episode.  <br>I got this</br>  <br>Shrink the size in half.</br>  Why is Kanye putting up with this shit? He had to feel the pain of getting his shit fucked up by Sonic and he stabbed himself.  <br>Because he's a beta faggot.</br>   previous thread <br> this thread <br><br>Finally shitposter has target charlotte.<br><br>It's just 3 weeks but it was fun. Good bye my friends.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Beta as fuck.</br>  Did MC do anything fun with his power or is it as shit as the second episode?  <br>Yu saying to nao I had enough of your shit when?</br>  <br>Actually, it's even worse.</br>  <br>It's basically the same.</br>  <br>i wish it was like the first episode the whole time, where the MC got whatever he wanted by using his power. But, after that bitch showed up i wanted to drop it.</br>    Hand holding never  <br>What are you guys making her do?!</br>  <br><br><br> self-inserting <br>Nao did nothing wrong</br></br></br></br>  <br>Blur the edges of the thumb, or at least make them thicker.</br>  <br>The eyes are fucking so big for the current anime eye style.<br>She feels like an alien.<br>Not only the imouto but the whole female cast in this anime.<br>The faggot sidekick is boring as fuck and the MC has become a docile guy just as we all had expected.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that this part of the OP lasts EXACTLY five seconds.</br>  This episode was terrible and the MC is boring now. I knew he was going to drop his personality that he had in the first episode but god damn it's still disappointing they couldn't stick with it.  <br>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN</br>  This episode was kinda shitty. It was necessary to introduce the idol because she's part of the main cast, but the whole episode felt like help this teen of the week episode. <br><br>Also, they really trying build up the tears when bad shit happens to the imouto and onii-chan can't eat disgusting pizza sauce anymore.</br></br>  <br>Don't go anon, I'll miss you ;_;<br>Just wait a few hours from now and it will quiet down.<br><br><br>He got tackled into a wall at high speed and stabbed himself.<br>Judging by episode names, the plot will start moving real soon, if we're getting the Afterstory around episode 6.<br><br><br>Getting there, maybe just a little more detail, so we can see the fingernail.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Punch Line </br>  <br>Worse, in a bad way.</br>  <br> bawww where is my gayloyche/lighto clone gary stu <br><br>Deal with it, shitposter. Or GTFO, either works.</br></br></br>  <br>When the comet arrives, their powers will become truly complete, and Nao will disappear from all existence.</br>  <br>So your saying he's going to control Nao at some point?</br>  <br>That part takes place inside a dream created by Freddy Krueger, and Yuu is using his power to stop it.</br>  <br>That's crazy!</br>  <br>And the MC will permanently take over someone else?</br>  <br>Yes my dick.</br>  <br>He's not the main focus of this episode.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128264271 <br> policing decades old internet shorthand behaviors <br><br>back to middle school little coolness policeman, this isn't your playground</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Oh, shit here comes the intelligent comment.<br><br>You know guys, I so can relate to all your feelings about this MC. You see, he's very different and clearly not the same as those light novel adaptation where the MC got a good looks, a calculating mind, and wicked sense of humor.<br><br>definitely original, and not pandering, and cannot be self inserted, since he's not a beta faggot (based on /a/ said).<br>Pretty refreshing, if you likes all those NON-shitty LN adaptation, or NON-forced drama triangle love romcom, which is the best genre in chinese cartoon.<br><br>And this is the best MC because the personality and wicked sense of humor, and nihilistic really do like me, and the viewers. Definitely not pandering though, they just know what the viewers want. <br><br> Real talk, I actually starting to like this MC. Sanic still the best though. But at least the edgyfag now can't self insert to the MC. I fucking love it. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She did come up with a corny plan that felt pretentious and made me cringe. Well, I guess that's anime.</br>  <br>I love you.</br>   best girl already dead <br>dropped</br>  <br> I knew he was going to drop his personality <br><br>You're probably too busy self-inserting to notice he kept trying to be an intelligent and nihilistic with a wicked sense of humor except he kept getting shot down because he's not actually that smart.<br><br><br>I appreciate your blatant shitposting in a roundabout way, Eggman autist.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nao don't you have a show to make smugfaces in</br>  <br>So demanding. Last one.</br>  <br>new pasta?</br>  Yet another based KeyBro.  <br>Pretty convincing. Thanks.</br>  <br> I reaped what I had sewn <br>Seriously CR?</br></br>  The best.  <br>Nao is cute!</br>  <br>Too bad his chances of winning idoru were substantially decreased since Misa has/had her own husbando unless they go with protective older sister that shows up to set him on fire when he tries to make a move dynamic or something.</br>  <br>Charlotte a cute.</br>  <br>CUTE.</br>  <br>being dead doesn't mean she's gone!</br>  <br>The kittymouth convinced me. <br><br>Charlotte is best Charlotte.</br></br></br>  <br>Who is Charlotte?</br>  <br>Pretty much, she'll probably take over her sister's body again when shit goes down.</br>  <br>Expect it often, remember Maeda is writing this</br>  <br>The comet, you dumb ass.</br>  <br>How does she know when shit goes down? Is she all seeing? I hope they explain it next episode.</br>  <br>The dead sister.</br>  Why are they only save in the Star Ocean Academy from Science?  <br>As much as I want him to win the Idoru I already know the chances are slim.</br>  <br>Eh, spirits and shit.</br>  <br>I'm always here. I'm the protector of this thread, I will always come whenever there's an edgy teenager posting in Charlotte thread. Mainly to extend the meaning of their own post.<br><br>Which is simply about, <br> how MC have to ABUSE it power,  <br> fuck the moral things. <br> MC is so original with best personality <br> something like that. <br><br>So if those edgy teenager stop shitposting about it, I'll cease to exist.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love the german sub for the Star Ocean Acedemy! Its Sternenmeer</br>  <br>She was supreme this episode. <br><br>Giving her sweet anal sex would be so good.</br></br></br>  <br>I see what you did there.</br>  <br>She is so cute! I want to hug hear!</br>  <br>But she was best girl.</br>  <br>They'll probably disappear by the time plot kicks into full gear. They don't have the attention span to watch a self insert-less anime for that long.</br>  <br>I see someone wasn't here for Angel Beats</br>  <br>She's dead but her almighty spirit can take over her sister's body, there's nothing else to explain.<br><br>But, what it does need an explanation is Yusa's power, can any spirit take over her body? How does that even work?</br></br></br>  <br>Err, my comment was about how they were both voiced by Ayane Sakura.</br>  <br>I think her character synopsis said she can only channel her sister.</br>  <br>Plot twist: Yusa dosen't have a power, she's just a conduit</br>  <br>She have a nice voice.</br>   no new lewd Nao faces <br> no Nao smug faces <br> barely any imouto <br> no sanic-kun slow mo action <br> retarded idolslut with brain problems <br> some dead bitch I don't care about <br> half assed love confession to a dead person <br><br>What a disappointing episode.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That isn't true</br>  <br>Talk about incomplete.</br>  <br>That's some pretty bad Shimakaze art.</br>  <br> no Nao smug faces <br><br>Fucking what?</br></br></br>  <br>Plot twist: Yusa is the one dead.</br>  Are idol characters in non-idol anime always unpopular?  <br>I just took one from my folder and didn't care about what it was as long as it's Ayane Sakura.</br>  <br>Untrue.</br>  <br>2deep, Maeda does it again</br>  <br>So why is it called Charlotte when there's no one called Charlotte?</br>  <br>Because Charlotte is the teacher</br>  <br>Because Charlotte is Unit 732s project name</br>  <br>There is someone called Charlotte.</br>  <br>What about the comet the imouto said passes over Earth every few centuries?</br>  <br>シャーロットちゃんかわいい！</br>  <br>ANON YOU MAKE NO SENSE</br>  <br>Because the threads are infested with french shitposters.</br>    <br>Charlotte is Yuu and   Ayu's   daughter name</br>  <br>MAEDA JUN did it</br>  <br>Neat, do this one next (with a PNG source of course).</br>  <br>They were voiced by different va because ayaneh sakoorah is dead</br>  <br>picked up again</br>  <br>How is this not a smug face?</br>     mfw no Speedbro to go get me stuff early <br>This nigga is based.</br>  <br>Why does this sound so plausible?</br>  What if they go back in time and end up saving Misa, but then it turns out doing that fucks up everything, so they go back in time and cause her to die?   sakura ayane   <br>Acts all big when help is with her, gets punched on the face and probably raped if she was alone</br>  <br><br><br>I'm sorry, that was poor bait.</br></br></br>  <br>What if it's a KEY plot and there's a dying girl in the snow?</br>  <br>Because there is something called Charlotte, we just don't see it yet.</br>  <br>I hope they keep showing scenes of the two just shooting the shit together, even if it's only one or two before the plot of the episode starts.<br><br>It definitely feels VN-esque.</br></br></br>  <br>We do know it's the comet though.</br>  <br>It feels really odd seeing his script and no Inoue art</br>  <br>Well shit, whoops.</br>  Glad this episode went off the deep end of shit. Last episode was borderline, but I feel much better dropping this show knowing how bad it really is.  <br><br>Welcome to Key, Aniplex and modern best selling "original" late night TV anime formulas aimed at otaku collectors where it's literally all just pure product that has barely left the conceptual phase as opposed to actual functional television with proper storytelling that you're supposed to watch and be interested in over the course of a season. Your average fucking kids show has better and more sensible storytelling these days and I'm glad I'm not just a brainwashed otaku so that I can actually see and laugh at this fact.<br><br>This is why I barely give a shit about the sort of stuff that's popular and talked about nowadays in the anime scene and just watch the shit that's actually good, interesting and have direction and sense of flow with characters that have proper arcs. You know, the sort of shit people barely care about anymore cause they just buy in completely to all the marketing hype behind the late night shit and can't realize that most of these show are hot garbage.</br></br></br></br>  Will Sanic win the idol? Or will it be some hilariously bad love triangle where he falls for the dead sister or something?  Reminder Japanese scientists have NEVER done anything remotely evil  <br>Go back to your sales threads retard.</br>    <br>That's a myth, just like the rape of Nanking.</br>  <br>More likely than not, speedbro will just remain speedbro and nothing more, being cursed to the fate of many Keybros before him.</br>  <br> look at me, I dropped the most popular show of the season <br><br>Literally one viewer less in thousands, no one will miss you.</br></br></br>  <br>So is this why precure threads have been consistent for the past 5-6 years?</br>  <br>Praying for Speedbro to break out of the Sunohara trope. Also, his phone.</br>  <br>Well meme'd</br>  <br>Why are they save from the Scientists in the Star Ocean Academy?</br>  <br>Is she showing her panties there?</br>  <br><br>Hinata broke out of it.</br></br>  <br><br>Not that anyone really realized it. Considering this seems to be only 13 episodes too at least for now I picture it ending up much the same and it'll probably still sell 30,000 copies a volume because Key and marketing.</br></br>  <br> not 5,1 </br>  <br>Gonna need a party hard edit for this.</br>  So what's the flaw in her pyrokinesis ability?  <br> MCs best bro <br> Ever winning anything <br>I mean it happens, very rarely, but it happens, so there's always hope.</br></br></br>  <br>Hence why I said many, not all.<br><br>Shit, Hinata had Yurippe on lock on top of Yui too.</br></br></br>  <br> buttmad someone dropped your shitty melodrama slapstick show, complete with spooky evil scientists <br>It's time to stop posting Jun, no one likes you anymore.</br></br>  <br>It can be extinguished with water.</br>  <br>She has to possess her sister to use it.</br>  <br>Doesn't Hinata technically count as MC since he was one in the prequel?</br>  <br>Here we go</br>  <br>It's smokes and mirrors</br>  Wasn't the dog drawn impossibly large?<br><br> W-wh-what happened to it after the older sister died?  ;_;  </br></br>  <br>Most top selling original shows are 13 eps, no idea when retards got that idea 24 episodes are needed unless you want some hardcore padding and filler.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br><br>It's kind of just reality, but people are so caught up in their own bullshit and celebrating mediocrity they'll probably never see it for what it is like I've started too. I mean people get fucking excited over a character with a split personality possession thing going on where one of the personalities is...SURPRISE a much more assertive type. AOTS this, girl of the season that etc. etc. It doesn't take fucking much really so yeah if it's a meme that I think it's kind of pathetic and lame I can only hope it catches on as much as this whole everything is AOTS because some dumb reason thing that's all the rage now.</br></br>  <br>Please stop replying to him, he's a known shitposter from Stalker/Aniplex's shows threads.</br>  <br>It's just perspective</br>  <br>Can't even burn marshmellows</br>  <br>Maybe they'll just show a pic of it hanging out with the redhead during an ending reel for the series or something, if Yusa isn't taking care of it (though that's doubtful since idol and all).</br>  <br>I wonder what happens in the VN if you choose Yui's route<br>Hinata get's ntr'd?</br></br>  One should just drop this instead of wasting ones time. It's like those fools who went through rewrite, hoping that it would ever get good, but it never did.  <br><br>I love you /a/.</br></br>  <br>No faggot, you literally recycled copypasta in that post so it's meaningless shit. Kill yourself</br>  <br>I'm not so sure.</br>  <br><br>I thought the most popular show of the season was that Gakkou Gurashi thing which I admit I've yet to even watch because I probably have no interest in it. Well in any case good job being butthurt that somebody dropped your latest mass marketed rehash of the Key formula that is already showing signs of being rushed and having no real story structure or sense of purpose 3 episodes in.</br></br>  <br>You become the Keybro instead and act as his wingman.</br>  <br>I heard there's no romance in Yui's arc. At least for Otonoashi. Plays out similarly to the anime, I think? Haven't played it yet though.</br>    <br>Those dogs do get pretty big and remember that moeblobs tend to be pretty small.</br>      <br>what car is that supposed to be?</br>  <br>oh shit</br>  <br><br>Just because somebody makes a post longer than a sentence doesn't mean it's a copy pasta. Why is /a so fucking utterly pants shitting retarded that it thinks this? People want to talk memes then that's clearly a good one to start. Remember kids if you type out your actual thoughts instead of just a collection of memes and one liners your just copypastaing.<br><br>Jesus fucking christ, no wonder nobody thinks much of anime fans, they're fucking dumb now.</br></br></br></br>  I hate Nao voice.  <br> Pringles </br>  <br>That bit was great, good acting from Ayane Sakura.</br>  <br>can't unsee it now</br>    <br><br>I like where this is going.</br></br>  <br> Misa <br> moeblob </br></br>    Does this semen demon have a special ability? Place your bets.  <br> Germ Shep heigh - 65cm <br> Average Nip = 171 <br> Crouchin so halve it = 85 <br> Moe so deduct anither 20 <br>Seems legit according to Otaku economics<br><br> Just because somebody makes a post longer than a sentence doesn't mean it's a copy pasta <br> nd this is the best MC because the personality and wicked sense of humor, and nihilistic <br> Not a meme <br>Kill yourself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They pet the dog?</br>  <br>Looks like it might be one of those tiny old Citroens with the canvas roof. Probably isn't though.</br>  <br>Her only ability will be causing MC to suffer.</br>  <br>Of course, that shit's cute as fuck.</br>  <br><br><br>Thanks anons.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh shit I remember that was fucking boner inducing, got the name?</br>  <br>She doesn't die even if she's killed.</br>  <br>She's the personification of Charlotte, she'll become a comet in the last episode and leave.</br>  Pray for speedbro.  <br>Is she living her life correctly?</br>  <br>Her ability is to be revived after dying from KeyAIDS.</br>  Realism and logic fags BTFO  Does this mean that there is no chance that Misa has had sex using Yusa's body?  <br> Super Puffy Vulva™  ability.</br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/771574/a24f22<wbr>6bcf/<br><br>Have fun.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>No, just because she believes she's correct doesn't mean she's right.</br>    <br>Thank you, damn man.

Stop being an ass.</br>  <br> But this isn't something to blatantly lie about to hide things from viewers.<br> He described Nao in that way and mentioned that her opening up to Yuu would cause their relationship to develop or some shit like that, but so far she has been shown to be more expressive and open about her feelings than everyone else in this show.</br></br>  <br> It's an old troll you dimwit. How new are you? <br>Ahhhhh, I didn't know about this troll hahaha, sorry</br></br>  <br><br>She isn't tsundere, kuudere, dandere or genki girl, she is well written character not some retarded stereotype</br></br>  <br>Rude!</br>  Why the fuck all the guys in this this show get bossed around by a bunch of girls?  <br>She was pretty cold and even went so far as to blow the fuck out of Yuu multiple times when they were talking 1 on 1 in episode 2. That is, when it was personal stuff rather than professional.</br>  This episode was kind of iffy. I think that end confession and farewell was meant to elicit an emotional response but didn't really work because nobody should really care at this point.  <br> character displays more than one emotion <br><br>Bravo bravo, extremely well written character! Such a refreshing design! Wow! Transcending the normal archetype so amazing</br></br></br>  Megane-Kun is cheap copies of Sunohara.<br>He will end the fachineiro.<br>MC will eat all the girls.<br>And infiar a stick in the mouth of this annoying bitch</br></br></br>  <br>Based anon. I tried in the threads for the first episode, by replying to every negative post, but it was too much. I'm glad you've taken up the mantle of protector now, it was too much for me. Keep doing good work.<br><br><br> Nao <br> Charlotte <br><br><br> stop posting Jun <br> posting this same shit in every thread <br>Kill yourself autist. Your shitty "the writer is hidden amongst us defending his work!" is the most retarded shit ever written. You should feel bad for thinking it was witty and funny.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The stand-off scene was corny too. The writing is kind of weak right now for the sake of introducing necessary characters with the bare minimum amount of background information.</br>    <br> can't decide on a character type for her <br> Oh I know let's just patch them all together <br><br><br>I think thats why it always feels so jarring when she's on screen for me atleast. It makes her seem bi-polar.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love Buratei Mari. It's a shame that people remembered her for voicing Irohaslut.</br>  <br>Like they're all just punching bags<br>Does Maeda think this is funny?</br></br>  Post your favorite KEY work and optionally give the reason why.  <br>I think she's insane. She'll probably break at some point</br>  <br> hitting your waifu/boss </br>  <br>Little Busters because Rin</br>  <br>She's a head delinquent, what the fuck did you expect?</br>  <br><br><br>Clannad because it has the best girls</br></br></br>  Dis bitch is like the weeaboo goddess. everytime time she talks a little bit of me dies  <br>poorly written rubbish as their fanboys delayed.<br>The Nagase Iori with syphilis.<br>Typical bitch bland, which is adored by fan with mental disorders</br></br></br>  <br>I want a little bit of her to die every time she talks.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=V1l<wbr>M3zkzEWk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Obligatory</br></br></br>   that ed <br>Let's go pal.</br>  <br><br>Reminds me of another shitty episode 3 that was supposed to make you cry.</br></br>  <br><br>Yes he does. Honestly it's kind of early 2000's humor in a way. Like Love Hina tier.</br></br>  Who will win the Yuball?<br>I hope that is not the mary sue bitch</br>  <br> I hope that is not the mary sue bitch <br><br>Misa? But she's already dead.</br></br></br>  This show is fucking weak. MC had potential, but his supporting cast and the overall plot are uninspired crap.  <br><br>Standards are pretty low nowadays. It's not exactly surprising to see people think that. Hell these days it actually almost is an achievement.</br></br>  <br> and the overall plot <br><br>You mean the one that hasn't even been revealed yet?</br></br></br>  WHY IS THERE SO MUCH FUCKING SHITPOSTING IN THIS THREAD AND WHY AREN'T THE MODS BANNING THE SHITPOSTERS?  <br>Mods are busy babysitting yuri generals.</br>    Why does she film it all? Won't they get in more trouble like that? They will get found out with the methods they use, somebody is just letting them do it.<br><br>Also why does imouto have slight death flags?<br>Pic related is best boy.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, I can let this pass but honestly "girl kicks guy" trope gets too overused in this show</br></br>  <br>I will always have a soft spot for Clannad AS.</br>  <br>There's only 10 episodes left.</br>  <br>And?</br>  <br>I just enjoyed it the most.</br>  <br>About the idiot character who is so shit.<br>Sunohara 2.0<br>Sunohara was much better and more fun than his Four-Eye of shit</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure they're dealing with feminism in one of the Shimoneta threads right now.</br>  <br> not liking a show is now considered shitposting <br>Try not being so hypersensitive.</br></br>  Meh episode, too little Imouto  <br>Yeah, I agree, honestly. At least Nao only does it when a guy is genuinely being an annoying shitter instead of tsundere shit though.</br>  An hour the bitch will break.<br>She has multiple personalities.<br>It is the weakest of all, and that is closer to breaking.<br>It is equal Nagase Iori.</br></br></br>  <br>m8 this is nothing, check NNB threads, that's some real shitposting</br>  <br> muh masks <br>I hope not.</br></br>  <br>What's the point of possessing him? It's a straight path with a dead end, and Sonic moves so fast that it's not like he's going to be able to dodge it.</br>  <br><br>fanboy his beloved dog is a transvestite who loves kicking men.<br>Generic cliche of Anime.<br>Loise and Taiga<br>By the end of the anime, she will kick Megane-kun 2-3 times per episode</br></br></br></br></br>  I didn't like this episode as much as the previous ones.  <br>Just to be safe. Sanic probably would've really fucked himself up even with the literal armor and slapstick armor if he slapped right into a brick wall. He probably actually could've done nothing and it would've been good, but he's not used to this stuff yet either.</br>  <br> she will kick Megane-kun 2-3 times per episode <br>He's used to bodily harm.</br></br>  <br>So Yuu would receive the impact damage.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gB5<wbr>qUxR6ch4</wbr>  [ ]<br>Best Op or?</br>  <br>The whole damsel in distress setup was unneccessary in my opinion.</br>  <br>she has the ability to   win my heart  </br>  <br><br>Probably yes.<br>From a look at 2ch.net, there they posted the radio interviews, and the VA said that she has multiple personalities according to occasion, and when asked whether looked like any other character, she said that the asemelhava<br><br>Demand is the number of topic 15<br><br>Charlotte - Charlotte - 15 [Reproduced ban] © 2ch.net<br><br><br>Demand is the number of topic 16</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If Yuu didn't make him turn around, the guy would have been slammed front first into the wall and probably break a couple ribs.</br>  <br>and that is closer to breaking.<br>It is equal Nagase Iori.<br><br>15</br></br></br></br>  <br>How about you fucking learn English before you post on an English imageboard?</br>  Words appearing in the 3rd ep's OP:<br><br> 75 cycle <br> 12 years before <br> parent blindness <br> the unknown particle <br> special ability = illness <br> vaccine study <br> geocentrism <br> time leap <br><br>You should be able to solve this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rewrite because Music and best girl</br>  <br>This really doesn't need an angsty 'I don't even know who I am!' character.</br>  Kanye did nothing this episode  <br>Suffering?</br>  <br>Nao is from the future and she's trying to prevent the scientists from studying people with special abilities and/or find someone with a super special ability, the unknown particle because it causes bad shit in the future. Now is actually 12 years ago for her. This is her 75th attempt. She's documenting everything for evidence. <br><br>Those words are probably some 2deep4u shit anyway though.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't steal Rewrite's plot just like that.</br>  <br>I can't see a time travel element working its way into this somehow.</br>  <br> Nao is a time traveller <br>Please let your post be a mere fan theory.</br></br>  <br>What if somebody can travel in time... but only forward.</br>  <br>Don't worry I pulled everything out of my ass. <br>There isn't even any source material for this shit. It's an original anime.</br></br>  <br>Maeda is just angry they left him out of Rewrite so he's making his own "Kids with Superpowers fighting evil Scientists" series.</br>  <br>Is Megane a masochist?</br>  <br>Probably, considering how he fucks himself up in each and every episode.</br>  <br>So that's how they'll use him for doujins. He'll be the subject of femdom.</br>  <br>Yeah, dropping it right now.</br>  <br> So we are going full Groundhog Day with special powers being Key AIDS?<br> Cool.</br></br>  <br> special ability = illness <br><br>great special ability, I wonder what the downside is</br></br></br>  <br>Yuu is the "trusted person" and the mysterious "third person" from the future.<br>Calling it now.</br></br>  <br>You can't die from it and have to suffer</br>  <br>I like Clannad because Tomoyo<br>and Rewrite because Akane</br></br>  <br>I mean, we saw today a girl whose special ability is to be possessed.</br>  By the way, his ability is teleporting. Stop blaming the subs.  a cute   bitch goes on and on about powers needing to be kept secret or the evil scientists will find you <br> show off their powers like a circus act to that corrupt asshat and think he'll just keep quiet  <br><br>Wow, what a great plan. How could this ever backfire?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Most based cast this season.</br></br>  <br>It seems like they don't directly kidnap or otherwise break the law, though it also seems like they get the go ahead to do testing on live children sold out by their families.</br>  <br><br>If he talks she'll just have him killed or put in a state where he can never talk again. Easy peezy.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm rock hard with so many TEMEE<br>https://d.maxfile.ro/zpmaudhxxq.web<wbr>m</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>So, this is another show with good potential that will get eventually ruined with forced drama right?</br>  <br>Go be new elsewhere.</br>  <br>Ayane's voice is really the epitome of insufferable bitch.  i love it </br>  <br>Why are you using off-site hosting?</br>  <br><br>I'm going to go ahead and assume that you're not watching hardly anything this season then, because everything is pandering in some way or form. You might as well just quit anime forever.</br></br>  <br><br>They stole it from Nirvana. <br><br>Smells like Teen Spirit mothafucka.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Moot didn't allow webm with sound outside /gif/.</br>  <br>Audio</br>  <br>probably doesn't matter once you join the safe haven</br>  <br>/a/ doesn't have sound and making a thread on /wsg/ is probably too much work.</br>  <br> You know i'm right </br>  <br>Planetarian because it's the only one I fully read without having to push the skip button.</br>  <br>There is an anime thread up at all times on /wsg/.</br>    <br>Planetarian is the shortest one anon. Do you have a short attention span? Not hating on Planetarian or anything.</br>    <br>how does Beef Tongue taste anyways? Sounds disgusting</br>    <br>Apocalypse end confirmed.<br> Ready to fuck some shit up? </br></br>  <br>12/10 bro, would do fun shit with.</br>  So how was the third episode?  <br>Sometimes brevity is best. I also felt the kinetic novel aspect really helped out. It felt more like a short novel rather than a choose your own adventure deal.</br>  <br>smug as fuck</br>  <br>Fuck.</br>  Drawfag Thread 1542<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1539:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1541 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Post it</br>  <br>is her feet like a human's, or does it actually have claws like shaped after her boots?</br>  <br>They're just boots  but they can be turned into flipflops if you like </br>  Someone draw &gt;if you raped papi and she took three steps it'd be like it never happened<br><br>After the deed, she takes 3 steps and forgets still covered in spunk</br></br>  Something of Eve and Yami together, maybe with their 'mother' Tearju - who is the SAME in both Black Cat and To Love Ru.
