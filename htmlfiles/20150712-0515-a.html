Everyone is entitled to their opinions here on /pc/!  unless that opinion is "Hummy a shit" </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the worst and most annoying character and fairy ever <br>Before it was just a shit opinion, now you're just wrong.</br></br>  <br> hahahahaHHAHAAHA <br>Stop acting like a tumblrwhore, he is easily the worst Precure character.<br> his character episode really made good use of that <br>He was a whiny faggot in his episode as well.<br>And in later episodes he starts up "NO ROMA NOT GOOD ROMA NOT LIKE THAT ROMA" like always. God damn it, not to mention that voice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alright, I'll humor you.<br>Who was more annoying or worse than him?</br></br>  <br>If you even have to ask, you haven't seen enough series. Aroma is top tier.</br>  <br>How about we start with king of the worst fairy Pollun and move on from there, Mepple and Lollun were almost as bad if not for the fact that Pollun made Mepple look good in comparison and Hikari toned down anything Lollun tried to start.</br>  <br>Porun was bad, but became less irritating and also he was a baby, not a whiny faggy bitch like Aroma.</br>  <br>Milk<br>Chiffon<br>Ai</br></br></br>  <br>Any of the baby fairies</br>  <br> Milk <br> Ai <br> worse <br>My sides can't be constrained.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I think you dropped this</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you anon, I might have dropped tha-<br>Wait, I won't fall for it just because that plushie is a bit cute.</br></br>  <br>That plushie literally screams for help when you shake it too hard.<br>Bandai supports Aroma bullying</br></br>  Nah anon, Aroma is fine. The only real bad fairy is Porun (he's actually so bad that Lulun becomes good by extension because she's making him suffer), and Chiffon, because she's just just a useless baby, but also has asspull powers.<br>Best fairies would be Sharu/Candy/Milk/Tarte and of course Pafu.</br>  <br> Candy <br>Candy was a shit though. Fuck that worthless fairy. The others are fine there though.</br></br>  So Haruka wants to be a princess, what happens after that? Does she rule over a kingdom somewhere? The demand for princesses doesn't seem high at all.  <br> Candy was a shit though <br>Nice trolling.</br></br>  <br>I don't know if I like this Haruface. Can someone tell me my opinion?</br>  <br>Funny that you say Chiffon is a useless baby with asspull powers when Candy was exactly that, but even less likeable, more annoying and even more useless.</br>  When are we getting the second Ed?  <br>Candy wasn't a baby. She loved the girls and they her, she bonded with them and tried to help even if she was very bad at it in the beginning.<br>She also had the most characterization of any fairy ever, maybe aside from Hummy (whom I forgot to mention despite being a best too), but I think she beats her too.</br></br>  <br>When he resurrects his mum.</br>  <br>Hopefully today.</br>  <br>Damn it anon, that was actually good.</br>  How could anyone have been surprised when Gon acted like an hypocrite? He's been that way since the exam arc, when he didn't have a problem with using someone else's death at his advantage (and was actually hoping for it) but only if it wasn't one of his friends.<br>Even Zepile noticed that he doesn't give a shit about right or wrong as long as it doesn't concern or benefit him directly.</br>  Gon  Were people surprised? It felt like a natural, albeit extreme, culmination of his character flaws when faced with a situation he couldn't handle. <br><br>Fucking scary though.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, i've seen a few posts who said they didn't understand why Gon changed so much, when in reality he hardly changed but just was pushed past his breaking point.<br>Also i don't think it wasn't only a culmination of his flaws, but of everything that defined him as a character.</br></br>  <br>You're right, not just his flaws but also his good traits like optimism and determination. I really loved that aspect of it.</br>  <br>So he's like kid Goku.</br>    Gon is so cute  I really like Gon, he's a great and precious character.  <br>yeah but it was subtle enough to pass the radar<br><br>the Crimera ant thing was much more easy to notice</br></br></br>  <br>gon a best</br>  What a nice kid.  <br>I wish Shoot got to thank him. He needs that right now, kind words and praise</br>  Hypocrisy is a construction of society, though. That's where the idea of holding yourself to some sort of stated set of values came from.<br><br>Gon just like what he like, and don't like what he don't like. It's the same as when Goreinu wanted to shit on Bomber, but but wanted to heal Killua instead. <br><br>That being said Gon needs to learn to chill the fuck out and he doesn't learn that lesson from being 99% dead then fuck him</br></br></br></br>  Tell me /a/, where does he place on the character alignment?  <br>definitely chaotic neutral</br>  <br>People cannot handle characters in shounen handling situations like real people would in real life. They think hypocrites are poorly written characters<br><br>Gon is a kid who needed to decide between avenging one of the few truly influential figures in his life or getting through with the rescue plan safely</br></br></br>  <br>Hisoka is Chaotic Neutral. Gon is Lawful Good, that's why he was so conflicted in the first place.</br>  <br> Gon is Lawful Good <br>What makes you say that? I've started rereading the CA arc and the only part where Gon seems truly "good" is when he tries to rush and stop Yunju from crushing one of the guys he kept on a leash.</br></br>  <br>Gon also could not understand how the Genei Ryodan would kill people they didn't know.</br>  <br>Nah, he's neutral good if anything. maybe chaotic good.</br>  Gon will be a fucking monster if he has to, it's just that he acts nice in normal settings.  <br>There was also this guy.</br>  <br>Can we say he tries really hard to be Lawful Good? I mean, Neutral Good and Chaotic Good are definitely Kurapika and Leorio</br>  <br>He isn't acting.</br>  <br>Isn't Kurapika more like chaotic neutral?</br>  <br>If he were Chaotic Neutral he wouldn't care about the eyes anymore as they serve no purpose to him. Him wanting to serve justice means he has some good, albeit twisted, inside of him.</br>  <br>He got mad at the Spiders for indiscriminately killing people with no regard for their lives.</br>  Since we're discussing alignment now, let me try to give the best examples for the remaining ones:<br>Lawful Neutral - Netero. Otherwise he would have gone on a dojo rampage after becoming super strong instead of becoming chairman.<br>True Neutral - Zeno. The Ant situation barely phased the Zoldycks and Komugi dying made him lament not being able to act truly neutral.<br>Lawful Evil - Meruem. Don't think there's a lot to discuss from this point onward.<br>Neutral Evil - Genthru.<br>Chaotic Evil - Pariston.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is Illumi?</br>  <br> Meruem <br> evil <br>What? <br>Uvo would be lawful evil.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Chaotic Neutral, just like Hisoka. He wants to preserve the family hierarchy but at the same time he wants to control Alluka's power.</br>  <br> Lawful Evil - Meruem. <br>get the fuck out of here</br></br>  <br>He could never realize the evil in his ways of maintaining humanity as cattle for the Ants. In fact, his revival only made his become more delusional about his intelligence and the true meaning of equality.</br>  <br> Chaotic Evil - Pariston. </br>  <br>Pariston stop posting</br>  <br>See<br><br><br>Although I can agree maybe we already have better examples. I'd like to place Chrollo and the Spiders or Gyro in that spot but we have no clue what their motives are.<br>their motivations are</br></br></br></br></br>  YOU    <br><br>lawful evil is pouf, completely bound to the 'rule' of serving meruem</br></br>  <br>CAN</br>  <br>But that was what he was biologically programmed for. Those were his innate instincts, there was nothing evil about it at all. He forgave Pouf, wished good luck to Welfin, spared Knuckle's and Meleoron's lives, judged himself unworthy of his RG's loyalty and gave up on everything once he remembered the thing he truly cared about as a person.<br>He is not evil in the slightest.</br></br>  <br><br>More like Teen Gohan 2.0<br><br>You do know the ENTIRE Chimera Ant Arc is based of the Cell saga, right? <br><br>Culmination of DNA built into one "perfect" being? <br>Check<br>Netero sacrificing himself for humanity? (Do I hear Goku?) <br>Check<br>Netero power up scene in front of Colt IDENTICAL TO GOKU POWER UP SCENE IN FRONT OF KORIN where both are told they're not strong enough? <br>Check<br>Self-destruction bomb used (TRIED to be used in DBZ) on perfect being? <br>Check<br>Young boy realising tremulous power that culmunates from hatred? <br>Check<br><br>Toriyama doesn't get enough credit for basically being the grand daddy of modern Shonen</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ho before bros <br> not evil </br></br>  Pariston is more chaotic neutral than evil IMO.<br><br><br> more delusional about his intelligence <br>What do you mean? Meruem was very smart and capable of rationalizing moral values; the only issue was that his standards stemmed from a position in which Ants were the key species, not us.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Teen Gohan 2.0 <br>How exactly? I'm curious, it's been a while since i read DBZ.<br> Toriyama doesn't get enough credit for basically being the grand daddy of modern Shonen <br>I'm pretty sure he does get an immense amount of credit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well the whole point was what would a perfect being like that actually think and feel upon coming into existence. Kind of like how Gon was like what if a super optimistic stereotypical shounen protagonist actually existed and had to deal with things like loss and failure?<br><br>It's no secret that Togashi takes influence from Dragon Ball</br></br></br>  <br>I understand where you're coming from but I'm judging him on the perspective of the story as a whole, not on each character's nature.<br><br>For example, maybe the Ryodan have a good reason for killing all those people, but none would make them be good. If I were to judge them from their perspective, they would be heroes.</br></br></br>  <br> you will never hold hands with Gon </br>  which part of hunter x hunter left the biggest impression on you? it was netero vs. meruem for me. the scale and brutality of that fight was insane.  <br>116 for sure.</br>  <br>The dodgeball game</br>  <br>gon and killua</br>  <br>Pushed to his breaking point. A usually young, playful, caring boy having power brought out by rage. Gohan's character changed when fighting Cell. He never liked fighting, but after going Super Saiyan 2 he only wanted to punish Cell. Make him feel pain and fear instead of killing him quickly. Basically torturing him. Though with the speed of DBZ, that phase didn't last too long. Gon, on the other hand, is an even more extreme version and is drawn out more, as you can see from Hunter X Hunter.</br>  <br>That picture is so disingenuous because Madhouse altered the events of the first chapter.</br>  <br>Not really altered, just rearanged.<br>Doesn't change the fact that everything you see in the pic would still have been in ep 1 even with the Kite flashback, it's a very short one.</br></br>  <br>This<br><br><br>If we're talking about scenes, though, it's definitely this:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VYQ<wbr>rOXbznKs</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Few were able to better flesh out characters like this scene did with Ging and Gon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's okay anon, at least we have this<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nDg<wbr>WDlvvaNQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Probably that one scene of Kaito under that cherry blossom tree at the end of GI, even though it's like one page. Netero vs Meruem was great too, I really liked the analogies of the field of needles and a contest in which one must consecutively make the correct choice.</br>  <br>This part. It sent chills down my spine when I first read it.</br>  <br>Togashi's really good at conveying expressions. Most other mangaka would have everyone looking shocked instead of tailoring it to each character's personality.</br>  <br><br>the yorknew arc made me realize this wasn't going to be an average shonen. aside from uvo, the phantom troupe all remained alive and escaped, as opposed to becoming structured 'boss battles' for kurapika. chrollo was also a very interesting 'villain', i haven't really seen anyone like him before.</br></br>  <br><br>gon-san jadedly smashing what remained of pitou's head, still muttering his rock-paper-scissors callout.</br></br>  <br>This is the essence of HxH</br>  <br>Right? The part with Gon and Killua following Kurapika's plan from Leorio's directions really sealed the deal for me.<br><br>Chrollo also looks like he's in just as much of a struggle as Kurapika to get to his objective, from the fight against Silva and Zeno.</br></br></br>  As someone who recently watched the 2011 anime then went back and read the manga, what is the justification for not showing Kaito's flashback at the very beginning? It seems like a pointless change.  anyone else find greed island just sort of...clumsy? the dodgeball finale was great but i thought the rest of it was all over the place.  <br>Gohan had gotten angry before and the thing that changed about his character was the maturation past his cowardly nature. He only needed a little push at that point and that's why Goku had him fight Cell. <br><br>Sure it was rage that brought him there, but he was still himself and was even still holding himself back.<br><br>More or less, Gohan is a regular person psychologically where as Goku and Gon are sociopaths.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty angry at the 2011 adaptation for making him look so fucking ugly. His appearance along with his somewhat disturbing facial expression was a big part of his charisma.</br>  <br>Same here. It had a lot of potential, specially since Togashi looked like he was gonna follow some RPG structure, but it turned out to be more like... all sidequests? It was cool that he managed to fit in the training sequence with Bisky in it without it feeling forced, though.</br>  <br>This video reminds me that we don't see enough of HxH's beasts. We see pterodactyls and "chocobo" in Kurapika's flashback arc, though. Where the fuck did he live?</br>  <br>These<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=QvNU<wbr>kqHni6o</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>he looks too 'cute' in 2011. in the manga it's impossible to determine what he's thinking, which makes him eerie/more of an effective antagonist.</br></br>  <br><br>Greed Island is a mess, the card system just slows the story down and the 'reveal' of it not being a game at all was pretty poorly done. I'm fine with the twist itself, but it didn't carry any weight.</br></br>  Hajimeruyooo~  <br>Nothing. Madhouse fucked up immensely.</br>  <br><br>all i can think of is to build mystery when gon/killua finish GI and encounter him under the tree. so the audience has more of a 'who the fuck is that' reaction rather than 'oh, it's kite'.</br></br>  <br>There WAS no reason. There's a lot of things Madhouse messed up on</br>  <br>GI is an amazing arc. Its obvious you dont enjoy it if you cant follow the meaning of the game for Gon's pals and for the rest of the players.</br>  <br> it didn't carry any weight. <br>I'm fairly certain it wasn't supposed to be an important plot point, they kind of just shrugged it off.</br></br>  <br>Director's waifu was certainly true</br>  <br>HxH is all over the place in case you haven't noticed. It's an intentional design.</br>  <br>Do you thin shonen characters turn strongers just because of power of friendship? Yes, GI is a "training" arc, but it gives a great sifnificant of nen and it gives too the support of how much Gon and Killua become stronger during the arc. And thats the reason why Biske is so important in the plot.</br>  <br>Damn, that directing is pretty fucking good. I think i need to rewatch the old version.</br>  <br>No, he understood how they could kill people they didn't know, he didn't understand how they could feel upset over their own being killed and nothing over anyone else.</br>  <br>I think you're almost right. He didn't understand how they could do it, but he wasn't upset at them for it, it seemed like he genuinely wanted to understand why. The only thing that made him upset is the fact that they could feel bad over one of their members being killed.</br>  <br>I watched the show first and that was my exact reaction. Thought it was kind of cool how they just jumped straight into the next arc with a new character we knew nothing about.</br>  <br>It felt structured like a training arc meant to give Gon and Killua their nen abilities.<br><br>The ending to it was contrived. <br> "Everyone who came here was prepared to die, that's why we're letting their killers live". <br><br>Aside from its resolution, it was a decent but lighthearted arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And, obviously, GI is much better in manga than any anime version (OVA version is awful).</br>  There would be no issues if people would just be his friend. But no, they just have to be the antagonists. They chose their own fate  <br>I thought the OVA was okay. Then again this was a long time ago. I don't really know.</br>  <br> 'oh, it's kite'. <br>I was actually very happy to see him again after like 180 chapters because he's a really cool guy.</br></br>  <br>easily the dragon dive scene, it gives me shivers no matter how many times i rewatch. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=86M<wbr>oueTiBXE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>I'm a big fan of the 99 version. I think it had the best version of York Shin and I complain a lot about the 11 version for its directorial flaws.<br><br>The GI OVAs however were fucking shite.</br></br></br>  <br><br>and now he's a loli.</br></br>  <br><br>pouf going apeshit is great.</br></br>  <br>Dat episode</br>  <br> 1:08 <br>God damn, Zeno's VA REALLY nailed that part</br></br>   watch the first Madhouse movie thinking it's gonna be great with more Troupe interactions <br> they don't do shit in the whole movie and instead it's about the edgy chuuni villain and his imouto complex <br> has more Killua Illumi angst even though he canonically can't get over it yet since he doesn't pull out the needle until later <br>Boy was that a disappointment. Is the other movie any better?</br></br></br>  <br>He's a natural born psychopath. The way he absorb things after he left his house is like a sponge. Whether it's good or bad he takes interest in it without a second consideration. His concept of "good" is only imitation because that's what his aunt taught when he grow up with her. Imagine Gon was growing up in the same place as Chrollo, his perception and personality would fall to the later personality. He might even be crazier than Chrollo.</br>  <br>No. The movies are basically fanfics.</br>  <br>I love how Togashi just added a narrator to the final half of the CA arc. When he's talking about the Ants it looks like a National Geographic documentary.</br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with the art on that page.</br>  <br>Togashi stop posting and make a new chapter</br>  <br> Pitou's expressions </br>  <br> Is the other movie any better? <br> <br>I enjoyed it a lot more since Gon and Killua actually have their abilities instead of just Ten/Ren, but it definitely wasn't a masterpiece by any means.</br></br></br>  What gender is Pitou actually?  <br>Please don't start</br>  <br>Probably female, but we'll never know for sure</br>  <br>That's why I said Gohan 2.0<br><br>But Gon got angry before that point too? For both of them it was their breaking point and power up. <br><br>Like I said, Gon was more extreme and willing to kill an innocent person for his selfish purposes, whereas Gohan as willing to keep everyone on danger by keeping Cell alive for his own selfish purposes, which isn't as extreme, but is similar. Whereas, Gon is the more extreme version in an arc that seems to have taken away from Gohan's arc, which makes him Gohan 2.0</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You tell me</br>  <br>Transnigger</br>  <br>that's a cat</br>  <br>He was put in a similar situation, but with his own circumstances and has pretty different morals and personality. That hardly makes him Gohan 2.0. <br>But i do understand where you're coming from.</br></br>  <br>Wrong, that's a  cute </br>  <br>Yes, and?</br>  <br>she's a fucking ant, are you really this desperate?</br>  <br>a psychopath wouldn't get that angry over kite's death</br>  <br><br>Was he? i always felt he was some kind of psicopath/ sociopath...</br></br>  Isn't Shu the one where they focus their aura on a weapon?  <br>They are more likely than a normal person.</br>  <br>He was angry because he was a factor in Kite's death, not just over it. I don't think he would have reacted the same way if it wasn't the case.<br><br>That's correct, but Ko is when all your aura is concentrated into a single point. Shu is just making your aura flow through an object.</br></br></br>  <br>i guess he means because it's from the perspective of a guy who just got conked on the head by a very heavy super yo yo</br>  <br> gon growing up raised by an assassin family <br> killua raised by mito in the mountains <br> they meet each other <br>they'd still like each other</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gon punching Hisoka.</br>  <br>No altered, very little of chapter 1 is actually in the 2011 adaptation.</br>  <br>That or he has Asperger's Syndrome.</br>  <br>They are more likely to act violent, but Gon had real feelings involved. He was just as sad as he was angry. Togashi wouldn't make Gon a psychopath.</br>  <br> Togashi wouldn't make Gon a psychopath <br><br>Really.</br></br></br>  <br>He isn't anon.</br>  A psychopath doesn't experience emotions the same way a normal person does. Nor do they have a conscience. Chrollo may be one. But gon certainly isn't. He has a conscience and a set of morals. Albeit an odd one.  <br>as i explained on<br><br><br>People can't deal with their characters not always sticking to a set behavior, so they try to address one to them themselves<br><br>Gon gets called a psychopath even though he has very well structured emotions and moral reasoning through the entire story</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or they're just moralfags who can't get it through their heads that HxH doesn't follow their moral compass.</br>  <br><br>The nen system feels so authentic with the way everything has a checks and balances system. <br><br>You need more physical power? Use Ko on your fist/leg/object but subject to yourself to more damage since all your aura concentrated on a specific place leaves you defenseless <br><br>Need more defense? Increase your Ten into a Ken state but you won't be able to maintain it since it drains your aura(stamina) at a rapid pace <br><br>Ryu doesn't even need a name or be identified since it's something every Nen user does in battle by applying more aura to a specific body part in real time combat whether it be for offense or defense <br><br>Need Stealth? Stop your aura flow with Zetsu but again subject yourself to increased damage <br><br>Then throw in how emotions affect Nen, Vows/Contracts, and finally something of a beast on its own, Hatsu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is Chimera Ant so polarizing?  <br>It drags out a lot</br>  <br><br>I think it's the best arc of the series but even I can see it has some pacing issues. <br><br>115, and 130(and the respective manga chapters) are literally blue ball episodes which setup high points for the arc</br></br></br></br>  <br>In the manga the pacing isn't terrible but because of the constant hiatuses it took a while for it to finally end. So people got arc fatigue. For a while readers had a similar reaction to Greed Island arc because it took so long to end.<br><br>The 2011 adaptation didn't help things by dragging on the arc.</br></br></br>  <br> The 2011 adaptation didn't help things by dragging on the arc. <br>Uh oh. So it's probably better to read rather than watch?</br></br>  <br>Just do whatever the fuck you want. Both are essentially the same as far as pacing goes, albeit with slight atmospheric differences.</br>  <br>Yes, Gon definitely comes across as sane. He was just having a bad day was all.</br>  <br>Considering how the 2011 cut out key parts of the MC's backstory which plays a part in his involvement in the same arc that MADHOUSE was rushing to get to, I'd say it was doomed for failure.<br><br>At this point in time only really 2011fags who'll claim that Madhouse handled it well.</br></br></br>  <br>I watched first, and it wasn't horrible. The parts where it drags on have incredibly badass fights inbetween so it's not too bad, I've certainly seen much much worse. It never got even close to bad enough where I considered skipping through episodes or skipping episodes altogether.</br>  <br>Is Arturo Vidal a HxH fan?</br>  <br>It's the most ambitious arc that achieves the most in the story, but things on that scale are more susceptible to flaws. Most people cite pacing as the worst part but I found it just fine in the manga, I think it's just a big risk to bring in a bunch of new characters and dedicate a lot of time to each of their role/development. Instead of everything being resolved linearly, it's split up and if you're really into one storyline it will annoy you to switch to another. <br><br><br>Nen is really cleverly written and so well thought out, particularly the vow and limitation part from the writers perspective. It's a built in resolution and conflict plot device, you can solve nearly anything but it forces the character to deal with conflict at the same time.</br></br></br></br>  115 and 116 were such good episodes though that they made me stop being anime only and i read the rest of the manga<br>was not disappointed</br>    Is anyone else here a retard that spoils the ending of CA because they looked up how long each arc was?  <br>I spoiled Ging appearing and being an active character by watching the last 2011 opening</br>  Pitou - lawful girl  <br>ptiou was so obviously neutral evil</br>  <br>I'm one of those idiots who can't resist reading threads and even reading through archived threads while in the middle of watching a show. I'm still so mad at myself for spoiling Meruem's death.</br>  Just finished the anime and "caught up" with the manga.<br><br>5 &gt; 4 = 1 &gt;&gt; 3 &gt; 6 = 2<br><br>Some people shit on Chimera, but I think it's a flawed masterpiece.<br><br>What do you guys think about the story continuing after 339? I think the story found it's natural conclusion in the tree, and outside of some unfinished plot strands like Hisoka and Illumi's arc, I thought the story ended at a perfect time. IMO, HxH continuing with a new arc is an enormous mistake as it's committing to an enormous story (that doesn't need to be told) for an overall saga that frankly isn't as sustainable long term as One Piece. I feel like the ideal scenario is to finish the story conclusively over 20-30 chapters and just let it rest, if not retcon the last ten chapters.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A V <br><br>you blind fuck</br></br></br>  <br> it's split up and if you're really into one storyline it will annoy you to switch to another.  <br>This so much. I think this arc has great reread/rewatch value because once you know what happens you pay more attention to the details of each scene.</br></br>  <br> lmao pitou btfo</br>  Yupi is best RG.  <br>The story was always fucking meant to continue after CA arc.<br><br>Kurapika and fucking LEorios objectives hadn't been resolved.</br></br></br>  <br>It's actually the opposite situation to One Piece. In One Piece, there is a lot of build up for the mystery of One Piece, but with HxH the entire series was Gon getting sidetracked or even forgetting about Ging, so of course it makes sense for when we finally do meet him for it to be nothing special and for the story to continue on beyond that, because ultimately Ging was nothing special. Gon even points that out when he Talks to Mito.</br>  <br> more than half of the plot points are left unresolved <br> it's done guys <br>Nope</br></br></br>  <br>wow<br><br>ant arc was just about character growth...and the change in relationship between Killua and Gon..it wasnt the ultimate build up of hxh<br><br>Gon meeting Ging at the end was just a sidenote.<br><br>Other plotlines were still as important....also What Ging has been up to and his main objective has been scratched at multiple times in the manga.<br><br>The Dark continent ins the ultimate goal of the ultimate hunters which Ging has been for a while.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even Gon is interested in the Dark Continent he just can't go along with Ging is all.</br>    <br>I don't recall Gon being interested in the DC, are you sure about that?</br>  <br>They could have been left as is.<br><br>Kurapika got the eyes back showing he got some level of closure in some context.<br><br>Gon proudly proclaimed Leorio was going to be a doctor during the election's conclusion and that honestly felt good enough.<br><br>As someone who loved HxH and YYH, Togashi doesn't have it in him to give this series the continuation it deserves. 339 left it in a good enough place I think, and definitely a better place than YYH left off even with light unresolved threads.<br><br>And from what we've seen, I think DCE is looking to be the worst arc yet. It feels the same as if they decided to continue Yu Yu Hakusho for a fifth arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> more than half <br><br>Yeah, okay big guy.</br></br></br>  <br>During the talk with Mito, he admits that he wanted to go along with Ging.</br>  What's the word on the hiatus? Do we think we're looking at another 2+ years before it starting up again?<br><br>Trying to decide if I even want to start the new arc.</br></br>  <br>I just checked, i guess you're right. Though i think he just would have been interested in going with Ging, not in the DC itself.</br>  <br>The Spiders are still alive, and we also still don't know why they killed Kurapika's clan either so no there wouldn't be any closure there.<br><br>The election in and of itself was obvious build up for something else.<br><br>Again the story went out of it's way to show that meeting Ging was nothing important, that's why the story continues on afterward.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HxH isn't worth it anon. Save yourself before it's too late.</br>  <br>Don't. Wait for new chapters. The few chapters we have of that arc are basically info dumps and are hyping the DC up really well, it's very frustrating.</br>  <br>How are DC arc and YYH even remotely similar? If Togashi continues the way he has, DC arc is going to be extremely unpredictable and most likely extremely good. All the different characters and plot lines involved have so much potential, he's set it all up so thoroughly and it looks to be on such a huge scale. <br><br>He seemed to have gotten a big burst of inspiration for it, hopefully he commits to it.</br></br></br>  What are the odds Ging is Yusuke Urameshi?<br><br>Damn, he looks, acts, and sounds exactly like a 40 year old Yusuke would.</br></br>  <br>The only that was really resolvevd was Gon meeting Ging, which the story built up as not important. And Leorio becoming a doctor. There are far more plot points left open:<br><br>- The mystery of the dark continent<br>- The Spiders and all of their plot points<br>- Kurapika's revenge<br>- Alluka<br>- Ging's motives</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> we also still don't know why they killed Kurapika's clan <br>Anon... for money. There's no mystery at all about why the troupe do things, they're thieves who steal valuable things even if they happen to be body parts.<br><br>You're right that their story is nowhere near resolved though.</br></br></br></br>  Alluka is pretty much to this what Bran is to GoT: A mistake that needs to be dropped as fast as possible.  <br>There are people who honestly do think that the story was just about Gon and Killua's relationship. As well as Gon finding Ging.</br>  <br>Then who ordered it? We just found out who the Spiders were working for, and even then you have the subject of how Kurapika is going to get his revenge on them.</br>  <br> who ordered it? <br>I don't think they're mercenaries, they just sold the body parts.</br></br>  <br>Alluka is actually tied to the dark continent.</br>  <br>Anon we already know who ordered them to do it, my question was rhetorical.</br>  <br> we only post when there's no discussion you guise </br>  <br>My bad, i misunderstood your post.</br>  <br>There are a lot of parts in Chimera Ant that stick out in my head as things I'll remember for a real long time.<br><br> Dragon Dive scene <br> The nightmarish Netero/Meruem scene where the chairman activates the rose bomb <br> Meruem's final hours/the conclusion of that love story (honestly maybe my favorite part in the entire series) <br> Gon turns into an Ultimate Gohan-level monster from pure hate alone just to murder Pitou </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and we also still don't know why they killed Kurapika's clan either <br><br>the Kurta took something from Ryūseigai, Ryūseigai sends the spider to kill the Kurta, Kurapika thanks to her first PMS reveals the location of the Kurta, We reject no one, so take nothing from us.</br></br></br>  <br>Which was only shown after 339, disputing anon's belief that the story could have ended there.</br>   tfw no one has ever tried making a game based on HxH in the modern era <br> tfw the only appearances are in the Jump fighting games <br><br>Is there a chance of this series ever getting the One Piece/Naruto or even HnK treatment? It's one of the top 25 selling manga ever, the 2011 show was pretty damn popular, and it's built for the anime game treatment more than most anime that actually get it.<br><br>What kind of game do you want?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it's built for the anime game treatment more than most anime that actually get it <br>Hardly, i really don't see some hatsus and how nen works in fight being incorporated (Ryu, Ko, In and the likes) into a fighting game.<br> I'd love a Greed Island RPG though </br></br></br>  <br> doens't know about HxH <br><br>HxH has a lot of games released for it, granted most of them were released for the manga or for the '99 anime, there are strategy games, adventure games and role playing games. Hell there was even a Harvest Moon-esque simulator.</br></br></br>  <br> in the modern era <br>Read.</br></br>  <br>If you mean a game for the 2011 anime, then it not having a video game actually tells you a lot about it's actual popularity.</br>  <br><br>How Uvogin killed those Shadow Beasts so easily, I mean, Jesus, he basically ate his skull.</br></br>  <br>Uvo was so fucking based, it's unfortunate he was the first to go.</br>  I just finished the 2011 anime after watching the '99 anime up until the end of Yorkshin a couple years ago and I feel pretty satisfied. I understand that what most people fault the 2011 version for is the lack of Kite, but is there anything else as big as that?<br><br>I plan on reading the manga from start to finish sometime in the future when (or if) there's enough new chapters to justify it, but having seen both anime I feel like I have a fairly complete experience. Of course, I will move the manga up my list of priorities if I'm wrong.</br></br>  <br>There are differences in characterization between both anime and manga. It's always better to start over from the very start.<br><br>Cause you'll be waiting a while for Togashi to get off his hiatus.</br></br></br>   HxH still on hiatus <br> Berserk is back <br> even fucking D Gray Man is back <br>There is no end to this suffering</br></br></br>  <br><br>They probably didn't include Kite at the beginning because they weren't sure they were going to animate the whole thing when it was announced in case the series got shit tv ratings on Sunday morning<br><br>If anons forget or didn't watch it as it was airing, let me remind you when the anime was announced it was commonly listed as 48+ episodes which would've placed the "end" right after Kurapika vs Uvogin</br></br></br></br>  <br>D.Gray-man, and Berserk were on a much longer hiatus than HxH.</br>  <br>Still makes no sense to include that but to still include their own bullshit, instead.</br>  <br>I want to be happy about Berserk but I'm just jealous as fuck</br>  <br><br> include their own bullshit  <br><br>What the fuck are you talking about? Besides Kite, the story is pretty much the same as the manga except some streamlining of the excessive non relevant details Togashi loved to randomly add</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're right about D.Gray man, but i'm pretty sure the latest Berserk hiatus started after the HxH one</br>  <br>It's your own fault for liking the works of artists who have all since lost their work ethic. Togashi is the worst of them too because he sometimes just does scribble chapters when he actually isn't on hiatus.<br><br>All that aside, G.Ray-Man is just a mess, so it's best to pretend that it died long ago. Because it did.</br></br></br>  <br>episode 2 they added in their own character and even gave him his own character arc. They changed the scenes around so that Mito could essentially play the role of Kite. In reality they could have cut down on the chapter 2 material but they didn't.<br><br>All of those random things helped us to better understand the world of HxH and the characters. Because of the consistency of which the 2011 anime changes the things they adapt I think that it was more because someone on the staff interpreted the series differently rather the series being streamlined.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Episode 2? With the Kiriko? <br>Seems like you're making a mountain out of a mole hill since that character has nary impact on the big picture of HxH for Gon or the audience</br></br></br>  <br>Look at it this way, which ultimately caused more problems for the 2011 adaptation, including their pointless shit or not adapting chapter 1?<br><br>Considering that we have animefags who are genuinely confused about why Gon cares so much Kite and those who think that this is an accurate representation of Gon in the early part of the series. I wouldn't say that my complaint is something small at all.</br></br></br>  <br>He found the guy that was shot by what's his name's poison arrow a couple days later in the exam arc and carried him over near a pond.</br>  <br> They probably didn't include Kite at the beginning because they weren't sure they were going to animate the whole thing <br>The 99 staff still did it, even if Kite didn't become relevant at the time the anime was made<br>And even then, they changed his relationship with Gon when he was "introduced"</br></br></br>  <br>That's supposed to be him spitting it out in the bottom left panel, right? Am I forgetting wrong, or did they not have that in the anime? I remember being actually disturbed that he had no problem actually eating someone like that.</br>  <br>the porn</br>  <br>Surely you're not talking about shota porn</br>  Why?  <br>Because they both had their childish views shattered by reality</br>  <br>No, Togashi said if he wanted to kill his story he would. Just doesn't give enough of a fuck to work on it regularly.</br>  Okay, I'll say what I think.<br><br>Lawful good : Mizaistom<br>Lawful neutral : Netero<br>Lawful evil : Pariston<br>Neutral good : Gon<br>True Neutral : Zeno<br>Neutral Evil : Illumi<br>Chaotic good : Kurapika<br>Chaotic neutral : Gin<br>Chaotic Evil : Hisoka</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>"You should enjoy the little detours. To the fullest. Because that’s where you’ll find the things more important than what you want."</br></br>  I dropped hxh before the dark continent arc, I just hate togashi's long dialogs, they make me sleepy and the info in them is usually garbage, better wait for the anime  <br><br>I just wanted to see Gon wreck Pitou's shit the whole time, it took forever to get there. I really do like the Chimera Ant arc though. It had some solid character development and a lot of sub plots that I ended up really liking. And the end was awesome. Not what I expected at all</br></br>  <br>Me too but I think the wait made it all the more enjoyable when it happened. Everything is better with build up, if things happen too fast they lose impact.</br>  Also, Gon looked gay as fuck when he went apeshit on Pitou.  <br><br>Yeah I agree. At the time that's all I wanted, after it happened I knew it was worth the wait.</br></br>  <br>I think anyone would look gay as fuck if they're wearing a twelve year old's clothes when they turn into a buff adult.</br>  <br><br>Meant to reply to this </br></br>  <br> Gon looked gay as fuck <br>It was funny and symbolic, i like Gon-san a lot. His design is the most amusing thing in the series.<br> went apeshit <br>I don't know, he seemed pretty stoic while doing it. He knew it wasn't heroic and he also knew it was fucked up while somewhat maintaining his composure.</br></br></br></br>  I wish Gon had died and Killua became the MC.  <br><br>Except there is so little good HxH porn, shota or no. There needs to be much more.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm not saying I didn't like it, I definitely found it a little humorous. I think he went apeshit when he first transformed. It was just pure rage and hate that made him that way.</br></br>  After spending these last couple weeks watching every episode of the 2011 anime, I still don't get why they kept the OP the same for the entire thing. I rarely skip them even when watching many episodes in a row, but I couldn't manage it after the first arc was over, especially considering the shifts in tone that it doesn't match.<br><br>On the other had, I didn't think much of Hyouri Ittai at first, but ended up loving it.</br></br>  Was there a reason why Gon never interacted with the King?  <br>I think it was a bit more complicated than rage and hate. He really didn't know what to feel, and was experiencing conflicting emotions. Ultimately he came up with the decision that both him and Pitou were at fault for what happened to Kite.<br>The words he said to Pitou before his last blow didn't really seem hateful or angry. I really can't tell what he was feeling.</br></br>  <br>God, I love this page. It really feels like his hand is sticking out of the page and pointing right at you.</br>  <br> I didn't think much of Hyouri Ittai at first, but ended up loving it <br><br>Same here. Especially the second version used in the Chairman Election arc. This shot with them in the suits was cool.</br></br></br>  <br> being a dirty Killuafag <br>Ging became the MC anyway.</br></br>  <br>Killua wouldn't have taken the hunter test if he wasnt born in an assassin family</br>  <br>Really? I've only seen the anime so I didn't know. That sounds like the next best thing though.  Not that they'll finish the anime while I'm alive. </br>  <br>The people who like it are delusional, and the people who dislike it rightly see it as so absurd within the HxH universe that they can't immerse themselves. <br><br>As soon as you see the human-sized ant, just quit reading.</br></br></br>  Why is there so little  straight  porn of HxH?  <br> so absurd within the HxH universe <br>How so? Creatures like the ants have been around since the first arc</br></br>  So does this show get any better? I dropped it after the Ant arc because Gon turning into the strongest being on the planet despite being 10 years old was fucking retarded.  <br> strongest being on the planet <br>That always was Meruem<br> 10 years old <br>He's 12<br> fucking retarded <br>How exactly?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That always was Muruem <br>Neferpitou clearly stated that he was potentially stronger than the King and he had to try and stop him from getting close to him at all costs<br> He's 12 <br>Not a big difference<br> How exactly <br>Oh i dunno how about because a little kid who only had powers for about a year suddenly turned into a 30 year old man with enough power to kill people who literally dedicated their whole lives to training and perfection in an instant and without any explanation whatsoever? It is literally the equivalent of 12 year old Sakura from Naruto getting angry and killing a Hokage.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, but Machi is the best girl.</br>  <br> and without any explanation whatsoever <br>You must be a special kind of retard to not understand something in a battle shonen of all things.</br></br>  <br> It is literally the equivalent of 12 year old Sakura from Naruto getting angry and killing a Hokage. <br>Why is it that retards always go straight to the Naruto comparison?</br></br>  <br>The trips have spoken.<br>I second this, Machi best girl.</br></br>  <br><br> He doesn't like the idea of a little kid being the strongest shit thats ever breathed for no reason! <br> Hahaha what a retard <br>Fucking autists...</br></br></br></br>  <br> Neferpitou clearly stated that he was potentially stronger than the King <br>This never happened. Only that he was as strong as the King, which could be Pitou overreacting like Knov explained. Also, post-nuke Meruem definitely was stronger.<br> without any explanation whatsoever? <br>What? It was all explained in that episode. Gon made a contract, he sacrificed his nen, potential, future and life just to reach his full hypothetic potential for a few minutes. He would have died without Killua and has no powers as a result.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The reason was literally explained in the same scene. Fuck off back to whatever underage forum you crawled out of.</br>  <br>Purple or pink hair? <br> Pink is the correct answer. </br></br>  <br>Both are great.</br>    <br>Surely you mean Bisky</br>  I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING HXH SINCE '02<br><br>MAKE THE PAIN STOP PLEASE, I WANT THIS SERIES TO END BEFORE I DIE</br></br>  <br>http://hiatus-hiatus.rhcloud.com/<br>Reminder that we could be at chapter 700</br></br>  <br>I found it pretty funny when I first saw it but once I got past the fact that he was wearing short shorts and a crop top it was just scary and tragic. <br><br>He went apeshit but I think it had building up in him over a long period of time, so it was less of an explosion and more him consciously choosing to punish himself and end Pitou, and by the end he was just sad at what he had done.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, lower quality chapters though</br>  <br>Do you want to send women to the asylum if they act like a huge bitch on their period?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oo0<wbr>d1zTAFKA</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> Current hiatus: 44 issues <br> Longest hiatus: 79 issues <br> Longest publication streak: 30 issues <br><br>He couldn't go 30 fucking chapters without taking a break?<br><br>At least according to that maybe he'll release a chapter in 10 or so months.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait I dont remember this, what chapter is this from?</br>  <br>it's the one where he tests his yoyos and hatsu on Gensuru's ally</br>  <br>Well so far we've had at least 2 chapters a year. We can only hope this isn't the year we reach 100% hiatus.<br><br>178.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think he was a hypocrite, his patience just reached a breaking point and he decided to be selfish. Imagine if you were a money loaner and you came to collect a debt and the guy told you he won't be able to feed his family if he paid. Maybe you'll do the right thing and give them a break but what if this happened again and again and again? When it happens enough times you're just going to say fuck it it's not my duty to sacrifice myself for the greater good.</br>  <br>That's because nen and ki is almost copypasted from real life concepts of chakra, kundalini, qi, and other such equivalent eastern philosophies in the neighborhood of Hinduism and Buddhism. Characters literally practice yoga/meditation on screen as a nen exercise.<br>Keep in mind I'm not criticizing it, I like the occult and mythologies in my anime, you won't see me complaining about demons in SMT.</br></br>  <br>For me , this scene is probably the best in all shounen.</br>  <br>hes a fucking autist that can draw but draws like shit<br>lazy fuck</br></br>  <br>IIRC Berserk had a 7 month long one while we're about a month away from it being a year.</br>  <br>shut up already you whiny autist</br>  <br>His arms look so weird here.</br>  <br> Bisky <br> Girl </br></br>  <br>Best woman.</br>  <br>y-youcan smile ; ;</br>  <br><br><br>Best girl is Senritsu you mongoloids.</br></br></br>  It's time<br><br>Top 10 girls/women:</br></br>  <br>1/machi<br>2/machi<br>3/machi<br>4/machi<br>5/machi<br>6/machi<br>7/machi<br>8/machi<br>9/machi<br>10/Kurapika</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All that's important is<br> 1.

Oh damn, Feitan's 2011 voice is a huge improvement over his 1999 voice.  <br>He's so moe.</br>  <br>But will we ever see the Dark Continent arc?</br>  <br>He's definitely more of a chink in the '99 version.</br>  <br>Who's death he used in the hunter exam?</br>  <br>I hope so. Really looking forward to pic related too</br>  Why do half of the young boys in this show look like girls?<br><br>Is Togashi a pedo?</br></br>  <br>Kalluto is the only boy that looks like a girl.</br>  <br>Pito too</br>  <br>Please don't start this. Pitou isn't a boy or a girl, so it doesn't matter.</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  How can people claim Gon is inherently good? He never is disturbed by all the deaths happening around him (no empathy). He never chastises Killua for killing people and actually accepts him easily. He is simply a child with childish morals and may seem good (friendly with people) but can't comprehend the difficulties with morality and death in general.  <br>All of the Zoldyks look like girls at one point or another. I'm sure even Silva and Zeno at one point were full trap mode.</br>  <br>Moralfag plz.</br>  <br> What is Alluka <br> What is Kurapika </br></br>    <br>I don't care, I like Gon. But he is not good, nothing like Goku or especially Gohan.</br>  <br>Girl<br>A man with a pretty face. He's not a young boy.</br></br>  <br> Alluka <br>A girl.<br> Kurapika <br>Have you never watched any kind of anime before? He's clearly a man.<br><br>Killua doesn't look like a girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Alluka <br> Girl <br><br>Pick exactly 1.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The story makes it clear from day one to not be a moral fag, and yet here you are being a moral fag.</br>  <br> Killua doesn't look like a girl. <br>Does Pitou look like a girl? Does Komugi look like a girl, because Killua looks like them.</br></br>    <br>Stop</br>  <br>Girls like Pitou and komugi have pronounced eyelashes unlike togashi's boys, the only exception being kalluto whose specific gimmick is looking like a girl.</br>  I'd love to hear what speculations people have on what the Dark Continent arc will have in store for the characters. Will we see more suffering? How will Gon regain his nen, and will he be a different nen type post Gon-san?<br><br>What nen abilities beyond Jan Ken Pon would suit him?</br></br>  <br>Not disagreeing, but all of the Zoldyck children (barring Alluka for the most part) have noticeable eyelashes. It seems to be a family trait that just happens to play into Kalluto's 'thing'.  Unless if you're talking about pronounced strands. </br>  <br>Pic related<br><br>We will get: Netero's past, Don Freecss, shit more dangerous than the Chimera Ants, and Pariston vs Ging</br></br></br>  <br>I am talking about strands, a lot of togashi's hxh girls have longer detailed lashes unlike that "eyeliner"-esque design that the zoldycks and some other males have.</br>  I think... I remember one time when there were more HxH chapters out than Naruto ones.<br><br>How long ago was that? I feel old.</br></br>  <br>What happened? I posted one image, anon.</br>  <br>It's because Killufags usually keep posting the same images over and over again, and the one you posted was one of them. Well people called them out on their shit posting they usually come up with some excuse like "We're off topic anyway" or "We only shitpost when there isn't a discussion"but then continue to shit post even when people are in the middle of discussion.<br><br>Anon is just pointing out how hypocritical Killuafags are.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe Togashi should release some new chapters so we can have something to actually discuss.</br>  <br>Or maybe Killuafags should post on /cm/ instead of spamming /a/.<br><br>Besides I'm happy for the hiatus, it's doing its work in culling the more cancerous additions to the HxHfags, and it's forcing the newfags to actually read the manga instead of relying on the anime, and because of them 2011 adaptation ended. It's a win win situation.</br></br></br>  let's talk about how good looking Maria is in her new gear.<br>old thread </br>   Linking old thread <br>This isn't /m/ we don't need this.<br><br>And yes, Maria suddenly became cool and useful looking with the new opening. I'm still kinda sad she didn't have a shield though.</br></br></br>  <br>a shield would make her more perfect than she already is and that would be bad for the other characters.</br>  <br>Why have a sheild when you could just have a bigger sword?</br>  The dolls don't actually seem to be very good at fighting. Both Chris and Tsubasa would have had the advantage if they weren't just able to lean on being nigh-indestructible with their current armament.  Predict what will happen in the end /a/  <br>Why have swords when you can bash people with your shield?</br>  <br> Why have a sheild when you could just have a bigger sword? <br>so Phara's opponent was actually Maria the whole time!<br>and you guys call her usesless.</br></br></br>  <br>Hibiki will die and be resurrected.<br><br>Miku will have her memories of Hibiki drained, but fall for her all over again anyway.<br><br>in the more short term, the FIS girls will probably end up overcoming their LiNKER dependency somehow, given Kirika and Shirabe's concerns this episode.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Clara and dolls will die, Elf9 will be befriended, Maria will be redeemed and revive Zwei Wing with Tsubasa, DMJii will still be dykes, Chris will still be a whore and  Hibiki will be standing in front of Miku's tombstone. </br>  <br> Clara </br>  <br>I fugged up</br>  <br>Of course.</br>  I want to break these girls out of their lesbianism.    <br>Tsubasa isn't used to being wielded by someone else.</br>  Commie or H&amp;D?  <br>A guy pointed it out before and I didn't really see it until after the 3rd rewatch. What's with her moving like a ninja? Did Ogawa teach her or something?</br>  Ep 2 felt so slow.  Garie sounds like a fusion of Aoi Yuuki and Chiwa Saito  <br>No idea, I don't think it's necessarily ninja style, just some kind of agile rogue style. Which is really unexpected, I thought she'd be the tank.</br>  <br>Commie for natural english but bullshit songs' lyrics and stupid localization.<br>H&amp;D for accurate translation but somewhat stiff dialog. <br>Choose your destiny or watch both.</br></br></br>    Who is ready for this?  <br> I thought she'd be the tank. <br>Me too. The armored look she gives off didn't make me think she'd choose a faster style. Here's hoping she gets a bow just for laughs.</br></br>  They need to fix how they are muxing the songs into the episode. They sing them live like in S1 but enemy dialog and other sound effects are at the same levels as the songs. I could barely hear Hibiki's new song and didn't like it until I listed to the sample from the CD.  Those are some killer legs.  <br>Shouldn't it be Hibiki? Miku gets Gungnir confirming that Gungnir's a slut that would activate for a lot of people.</br>  <br>your mother's hips felt so slow.</br>  <br>Maybe King Records forced them to do it to increase CD sales. Oy vey. </br>    <br/>  <br> being a jew </br>    Carol talks like an old lady eternal loli confirmed.  <br>how much for the night? I have me shekels ready.</br>  <br>Old lady voices turn me on then, I guess.</br>  http://commiesubs.com/senki-zesshou<wbr>-symphogear-gx-02/</wbr>  <br>She uses "Ore" so it makes her an old man.</br>    <br>I wish I could hurt you right now.</br>  <br>You post that like I would even check let alone download it.</br>   ever downloading Commie's fanfiction and guess-translation  <br>Why are you people so impatient.</br>  <br>She can get sword training from Tsubasa.</br>  <br> Exterminate <br>You better tell me it's sung by Takagaki Ayahi</br></br>    <br>Where have you been the last few weeks?<br>Exterminate is the new Nana OP.</br></br>  <br>It gives me a legitimate excuse to re-watch the episode  at least  one more time.</br>  <br>Not in Symphogear threads for sure.</br>  <br>NASA fucked up and forgot to deploy the gears with their shuttle.</br>  I have a feeling Hibiki is ugly in real life like most japs. The only ones that would be attractive are Tsubasa and Miku. Chris would be ugly too but with tits, so it kinda breaks even. for her.  The new blade effect on Tsubasa's spin to win move is so cash.  <br>Then why does Miku want Bikki's bikkies so badly?</br>  <br>Go to hell yada yada one of you must have the image.</br>  <br> using 3DPD logic <br>There is no real life Hibiki. Hibiki is as cute as she is.</br></br>  <br>Hibiki is ugly in the anime so it doesn't change much. Chris wouldn't be ugly because she's only half nip.</br>  <br>Lets see how ugly you look after you say that to her face.</br>  <br> Hibiki is ugly in the anime <br><br>You're fucking dead.</br></br></br>    <br>Girls that talk like old men turn me on ~jyaro? </br>  <br> Hibiki is ugly in real life <br>So ugly.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Look at her and tell me she's not ugly. What the fuck is that hair? Literally every girl in this picture looks better than her.</br></br></br>  Senpai is truly the coolest.  <br> Onsen episode will never happen <br>SATELIGHT WHY!</br></br>    <br>Stop Bike abuse. Seeing this happen every OP is just disgusting.</br>  <br>Someone is missing.</br>  <br>You will see Bike-kun get blown up every episode.</br>  I just wonder will the doll VAs show up in 2016 live event and be a dancer when Symphogear VAs singing.  <br>Maria will blow up every car she's driving and Tsubasa will blow up every bike.<br>It's perfect</br></br>  <br>Shirabe's hips make me want to commit a crime.</br>  <br>Those tits are rebelling against that seatbelt.</br>  <br>Miku isn't superficial. What she has is true love.</br>  <br>More like Kaneko WHY?<br>He had hard time to write fanservice scenes and will obviously avoid it as long as no one force him to do it. You can just hope Agematsu or Anime staff used Majority rule to decide the plot again as S2.</br></br>  <br>Shirabe and Kirika are gross and annoying when they speak.</br>  Exterminate is probably my favourite of the OPs, sorry Synchrogazer.<br>I just can't help it with that "TOKIHANATE SUBETE WO"</br>  <br>Doesn't make dem hips any less illegal dess</br>  <br> just hope the staff decided to fuck up the plot again <br><br>No?</br></br></br>  <br>EXTERMINAAAAAAAAAAAAATE<br>The more I listen to it the more I like it, and the more I like it the more I listen to it. I think I have a problem.</br></br>      <br>Sluts.</br>  <br>Exterminate is one of those songs you can listen again and again without getting tired</br>     we need to make chris even cuter in GX season, how do we do it? <br> make her hug a loli <br>And that, they say, was the fastest meeting they ever had during pre-production.</br></br>  In S2 I found the "inshow" versions of the songs by far superior. But somehow they dont sound as well this time.<br>why</br>  <br>Episode 2's reaction should have Miku hats</br>  <br>Considering the actual discussions they had about the type of underwear Hibiki wears, I wonder what they talked about when deciding what to make Elf9 wear.</br>  <br>I don't get this meme.</br>  <br>imagine in the last episode when "exterminate" moves came out and at the same time nana sang the EXTERMINAAAAAAAAAAAAATE!! part...<br>can you handle it?</br></br>  <br>I think you have the same problem as this guy<br/></br>  <br>See the archives.</br>  <br>The end card of the ED has Miku's head popping up over Kirika's when she hadn't been present in the entire sequence. It kinda looked like Kirika was wearing her head as a hat.</br>  <br> No post-fisting K2 in the background </br>  <br>They also seem like they have a limited amount of time to fight, considering they need absorb kiss energy all of the time.</br>  <br> tfw it's sound producer messed up his work this time </br>  Did we have subs already at this time last week?  <br>No this show has no simulcasts and like 3 new songs per episode. You will be lucky to get meme subs within 48 hours.</br>  <br>Garie said Micha is a big eater that the memories she collected is not enough(to activate Micha O guess).</br>  <br>Its not the same without awesome singing.</br>   tfw listening to Ressou Gungnir  <br><br>You were good for one thing Maria</br></br>    Commie should be any minute now, looks like they're done on their progress page.<br><br>https://c.milkteafuzz.com/#/shows/a<wbr>iring</wbr></br></br>  <br>I like it. The noodles looked a bit strange anyway.</br>  <br> 3 translators <br>Did they assign 1 translator per song?</br></br>  <br>But what if the fact her CD comes almost last  is because she will have to use Gungnir, as Hibiki is temporarily out of the game? <br> Maria version of HIBIKE HIBIKE when </br></br>  <br>We need to put bushi-Noise in there somehow</br>  <br>Wouldn't it be better to make a clear-cut discontinuity in the silhouette of their heads so that they resemble the K2? The way it is they just look like they have some malformation.</br>  <br>And a banana... My drawing skills aren't up to creating something out of nothing though.</br>  <br> no one will do Hibiki suplexing the couch </br>  <br>Make the second tallest guy the third tallest.</br>  <br>Oh shit we need drawfag-kun to get on this.</br>  <br/>    <br>Wait, they discussed what underwear Hibiki wears?</br>      <br>S1 director made a speech about why Hibiki wears purple underwear after s1 finale on his Twitter.</br>  <br>Oh hey, another thread about this garbage. <br><br>Did this ever get better? Season 1 and 2 were nearly unwatchable and I don't think I can put myself through another season of this cringe bait.</br></br></br>  <br> Aoi will never cosplay Hibiki like her grandma wants </br>  <br>Do you like suplexing space shuttles and punching K2 in half?</br>  Any news when subs will be out?    <br> bait <br>Something here is bait, that's for sure.</br></br>  <br>It's bait. Don't reply.</br>  <br>Her face in the second frame looks like something from the original Transformers cartoon</br>  <br>At least we get Hibiki cosplaying as Aoi.</br>  <br>get bored more often, anon.</br>    <br>What was that reason?</br>  http://commiesubs.com/commie-subs-t<wbr>-shirt/<br>pls buy more t-shirts</br></wbr>  Who FIS here? I'm glad it seems like they are going to be main characters and not just side characters like I originally feared.  Still no subs?  <br>Now I want to see Maria pinching Tsubasa and otherwise lightly bullying her because embarrassed sword is the cutest. <br>Tsubasa probably hasn't had anyone who'd intrude into her personal space since Kanade died, since Hibiki has too much respect of her, Chris is too reserved and her parents are probably dead. Poor girl is in dire need of forceful skinship.</br></br>  <br> Everyone talks about how alpha Tsubasa is <br> Came just from having her arm grabbed </br></br>  <br> forceful skinship </br>  <br/>  <br>Maria is my favorite  living  character, but I'm more or less indifferent on Kirika and Shirabe. Sure they're c/u/te as fuck but they don't really... contribute that much.</br>  <br>She's a sword, she can't resist when she's being wielded.</br>  <br>We need a symphogear bait image.</br>  <br>He thought Hibiki might buy them because they're very cheap and thought since no one will see what colors of underwear she wears it doesn't matter what color they are.</br>  <br>Please, Maria is far too useless to intentionally do something like that. It needs to be mutual forceful skinship.</br>  <br>what does FIS even mean?</br>  <br>I could of sworn I've seen "Listen to my Bait" before.</br>  <br>F-sharp</br>  <br>Federal Institutes of Sacrist</br>  <br>She was the one taking the picture, moron.</br>  <br>Fine<br>Is<br>Shirabe</br></br></br>  <br>I didnt see Hibiki's purple underwear in the last episode of S1</br>  <br>Determination to FIS T </br>  <br>Sorry I mean he made a speech after S1E13 aired.</br>  I had a dream last night that episode 7 was out and we all referred to it as the Character Nuke, because EVERYONE died. All three main girls, the FIS girls, Genjuuro, and Miku. The episode started like the S1E1 did, with cup-chan and announcer-kun at a big grave especially for the members of S.O.N.G. At the end it turned out that not everybody had died, but most of them had - only Hibiki, Maria, and Chris were still alive at the end.<br><br> There was so much suffering. </br></br>  <br> no one will see what colors of underwear she wears <br>But Miku</br></br>  <br>TLDR</br>  <br>i need this</br>  <br> Killing off Tsubasa <br>Why would your subconscious do that?</br></br>  <br>You need a hug anon?<br>What a horrible dream</br></br>  I want to fist Chris.  <br>They literally drew her without pantsu in a few frames.</br>  <br>Elf9 pls</br>  <br> Character Nuke <br>If we ever get something similar I'll be calling it that.</br></br>  <br>It's an edit.</br>  <br>Her fluff will stop you.</br>  <br><br>I don't get it.</br></br>  <br>Yeah except Miku. Someone asked the director that if Hibiki and Miku exchange each others' underwears, he answered he will leave it to audience's imagination.</br>    <br><br>Fine Is Sex.</br></br>  <br> he will leave it to audience's imagination <br>Stealth "yes" answer since the audience was already asking him about it.</br></br>  <br>Don't friends usually do this normally?</br>  <br>this was an edit from the anon in the last thread.</br>  <br>That's what you get for not being in every thread up to date.</br>  <br> Too many spoilers, and I come home from work and there's a thousand new posts ;_; </br>  OK WHAT THE FUCK<br>Answer me this:<br><br>Those cunts are killing people. They probably just killed 40ish unit squad of solders.<br><br>WHY ARE THEY LETTING THEM GO? IS THIS A FUCKING GAME?<br>THEY'RE KILLING PEOPLE.<br><br>If I was one of them I'D FUCKING SHOOT THEM DOWN before they went singing. No drama, no nothing. What are the lives of 2 enemy cunts compared to the hundreds that you save.<br><br>Seriously, answer me this? Isn't Tsubasa a 'weapon' that has no feelings. She should seriously carry a gun and just shoot the motherfuckers up. That way she'll save the lives of all those solders with families and basically make their job a ton easier because they don't have to deal with 3 gear users but only 1. Hell they can finish this by the evening and still have enough time to hit the clubs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They say that some dreams are premonitions to what can happen in the future.<br>If it happens it will be all your fault for dreaming anon.</br></br>  <br>But americans are not people, silly.</br>  <br>Swords can't carry guns.</br>  <br>Front Islamique du Salut<br><br>A terrorist organization responsible for a bloody war in algeria during the 90's</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's the military's own fault if they send soldiers on certain death missions.</br></br>  <br>But they're so cute.</br>  <br>FIS wasn't killing anyone until Ver starts going ham with the Noise.<br><br>Kirika and Shirabe were never responsible for any deaths that happened.</br></br></br>  damn you guys I spent half an hour trying to remember where S1 had the bath scene where Miku tickles Hibiki, hoping to see the underwear somewhere. Then i checked S2<br>didnt find it, gave up.</br>  <br>Wasn't the only one killing people Ver?</br>  <br>Their children and never actually killed anyone. Ver was always holding the cane and Maria killed like 5 guys. I fucking hate them but they are retarded and not to blame and</br>  I don't understand Marias hair.  Damn I only just realized that "Believe in justice and hold a determination to fist." would be the final episode title.  <br>1, <br>2, Wasn't the Symphogear project still a secret at that point? They couldn't well justify the murder of two young girls without having to either expose the Symphogear program or have the killer arrested<br><br><br>Miracles cannot be understood, anon</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>LEWD</br>  <br>They are HELPING the bad guys. The bad guys are killing people directly. They know it.<br><br>They need to die, on sight, to avoid the shit that could have happened like last season. As easy as that. Can't fight them with an armor on? Fuck it, get a gun and shoot them. Or a sniper rifle.<br><br>They die, suddenly they've lost 2 whole gear users and the enemy no longer has any advantage. They can not inflict any huge damage and you've saved a ton of people's lives. The 3 can finish off Marie or Fine or whatever with a single swan song. gg well played.<br><br>Everyone is a fucking retard. Hell, if you have a sniper rifle you can basically just dismember one of their legs and that'll convince them to stop being cunts and not fight. And modern prostetics are so advanced they can probably not lose much functionality. And you've not killed them. Everyone wins, right?<br><br>Everything could be so much simpler, but no. Let them kill our solders.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Episode 6</br>  <br>And Exterminate will be the name of their final combination attack.</br>  <br>It doesn't follow the laws of the universe.</br>   that feel when Fine will never return and sing together with the maincast   <br>A gun isn't a secret. They can use poison darts if they don't want to make any noise. Heck, they can sedate them, get their gems/relics/whatever.</br>  <br>No one gives a shit about faceless soldiers.<br>If you want a realistic war anime watch something else, this is about singing and punching.</br></br>  <br>How is Sawashiro at singing?</br>  <br>Two shortswords? Who is she now, Archer? The Gungnir spear fit her better. Or a sword and shield.<br><br><br>Go away, Tsubasa.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. I'll do just that. I'll watch Gundam Zeta.</br>  <br>She only has one doesn't she?</br>  <br>I hate to say this, but you're not watching this correctly.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GoX<wbr>uWS6W5IQ</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Ep1, 3, 6.<br><br>Pic is from episode 6.</br></br></br>  <br>My mistake, I haven't watched the episode yet  subs when  and her waist armor looked like another sword. Still a strange style for her.</br>  <br>I haven't started this but I'm so glad Naomi got an actual role for real.</br>  <br>Ver's malicious killings and Maria's self-defense killings were kept secret from the lolis. They were thinking they were the heroes up until Ver started Noising the boats which caused Shirabe to go down and help.</br>  <br>Only one, with some sort of chain blade attached to it.<br><br> also the word "Verify" in captchas makes me think "Ver-ify," as in turning more people into Vers </br></br></br>  <br>It acts in a way that's convenient for the scene. It spreads out in neat little bunches like tentacles to cover specific areas on posters or on her body. It acts like normal when wet or as one bunch in a ponytail but it can also act like 3-4 tails tied together.</br>  <br>Naomi was actually Maria though, who went through several courses on confidence building and woman taming.</br>  <br>It is not like no one tried to do that<br>They are all dust now</br></br>   making Tsubasa into a sub for Maria <br><br>DROPPED</br></br>  <br>They guy already corrected himself but if I think about it, there was still the sword she pulled out from her chest which looks different from the one she pulls out from her arm guard.</br>  <br>Please, Maria's was there first. Naomi stole her hair, just like that other pink haired slut in that VVV spinoff.<br>And they're all not even getting her right, the blue green eyes are just as important as the pink hair.</br></br>  <br>Tsubasa could have just pin their shadow to the ground and called for backup.<br><br><br>That was much easier to notice.</br></br></br></br>   [Commie] Senki Zesshou Symphogear GX - 02 [D9F17490].mkv   <br><br>Maybe they are sisters.</br></br>  <br> 魔法少女事変 <br> Alchemic Cult <br><br>Also, what is ヴァーサス supposed to mean?</br></br></br></br>  <br>X-Drive tends to have it's own stuff though, and Maria's then was an extra special case itself.</br>  <br>Damn, should've seen the md5 part.</br>  <br><br><br>Okay, enough people fell for your bait, fuck off now.</br></br></br>  <br>Her sister is  dead </br>  <br>Versus</br>  <br>True.

Tsumugi a cute. A CUTE.  <br>no kidding</br>  Reminder that all keions are best girls but  ritsu is more best   <br>Step it up m8</br>  Gibson is garbage.  <br>MUTTAN<br>U<br>T<br>T<br>A<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> want to get a Mustang <br> can't be arsed to make a new routing for a toggle switch <br><br>Why are the Mustang pickup controls so shit?</br></br></br></br>  <br>ok, that's impressive, but ritsu is still my best<br> without her there wouldn't be k-on  </br></br>  <br>Without any of them there wouldn't be K-ON, or at least not as we know it.<br>They are all essential to the series in their own way</br></br>  <br>Except Asuza.</br>  <br>Nope, Azusa is integral to the plot and makes up a large portion of the happenings, especially in season 2 and the film</br>  <br>Ok, Asuza.</br>    <br>well meme'd</br>  So this is how every /keion/ is gonna end from now on?, shitposting about who is best girl?, i miss the threads where there was a topic to discuss  <br>Think of a topic to discuss then</br>  <br><br>We can talk about how good the movie was.</br></br>  <br> So this is how every /keion/ is gonna end from now on?, shitposting about who is best girl?, <br>well, that and ERP faggotry.</br></br>  <br> ERP faggotry. <br>Oh fuck no.<br><br>How about this: Does /keion/ plays an instrument?  electric guitah and bassu here </br></br></br></br>  <br>Guitar</br>  I haven't been on /a/ for a while, when did K-On erping start and how awful was it?  <br>I-i play the recorder</br>  <br>Sometime in February, I remember because it was just after the Steam group was started.<br>It's bad, and the mods don't seem to do shit about it.</br></br>  <br>IS THAT RECORDER HAUTE COUTURE</br>  <br>Sing well and play piano poorly.</br>  <br>Yeah Steam for some reason is a haven for terrible erpers. There was actually a group on there called the Gensokyo Whorehouse and they would do hilariously awful erps  for TF2 hats, weapon and metal .</br>  Mio&gt;everyone else  <br>It didn't happen because of the Steam group, it happened separately but caused a lot of people to join the group because it was pretty much impossible to have any kind of discussion in the thread</br>  All girls are best girl.  <br>It started a little while back by a transsexual britbong with cuck and piss fetishes.<br>despite claiming to have mugi as his waifu, he constantly slanders her and and consistently avatarfags with poorly drawn fanart of mugi as if to put her down further.<br>the mods sometimes delete his threads, but sadly they never banned him.</br></br></br>  <br>It was an Australian at first actually, there's more than one of them</br>  <br>It's mainly done by the bong.</br>  Guys can we just settle who the best girl is once and for all? Everyone knows that  all the k-on girls are top tier, and it's futile and petty to argue who's better. They're all fantastic.    <br>Bought an electric gitah a long time ago and finally started playing it thanks to k-on, which I watched for the first time two weeks ago. Also bought an electric drum kit a few days ago thanks to Ritsu.</br>  <br>Guitar and keyboard.</br>  what kind of books do the keions read?<br> assuming yui and ritsu can read </br>  <br>Azusa - Guitar books/non-fiction<br>Mio- Love stories<br>Mugi - Classic novels<br>Ritsu - Manga  and love stories secretly <br>Yui - Manga</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fifty shades of kei...on.</br>  <br>Exactly, the anything sexual about the keions in the steam group is a bannable offense.</br>    <br>I want to remove kebab with the keions</br>  <br>Ritsu belongs to Mio though.</br>  <br>how about removing cops with the keions?</br>  <br> How did you do that </br>  <br>It's a mod I made. do you want it?</br>  <br> Yes </br>    <br>here you go:<br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/1<wbr>tft5xyarbgcso2/aimpoint_template.zi<wbr>p<br>the folder has aimpoints for each keion, but you can only use one at a time. for example if you want to use yui, put the "yui aimpoint" folder into \PAYDAY 2\assets\mod_overrides<br>It only works for the military red dot sight.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>How are people still playing this?<br><br>I played for 60 hours after it was released and never touched it again. It's the same boring bottleneck with cops thing.</br></br></br>  <br>There's no mod_overrides folder, do I just make one or am I missing something</br>  <br>I am glad Yui likes manga, I cant wait to read Evangelion with her.</br>  <br>I'd imagine she reads more cute SoL type things</br>  <br>you have to make the folder.<br><br>I don't know. I've sunk almost 300 hours into this game, and I still can't stop playing.</br></br></br>  <br>That's fine then , I have some of those too. I wonder what her favorite manga is.</br>  <br> that's it </br>  <br>I mean series not type.</br>  <br>Lucky Star.</br>  <br>Nice! it works. That's pretty amazing, makes me want to start playing again</br>  <br>I can see that, I can see her being a Miyuki fan as well.</br>  <br>What's the best build, you wanker?</br>  <br>Yui seems like the sort of girl who'd laugh at things she can relate to, so she'd probably like Lucky Star.<br><br>As for Ritsu I can imagine her reading a lot of shounen.  Maybe even Berserk but just for the fights and not really understanding the themes and stuff. </br></br></br>  <br>I prefer a tech-forcer build, but dodge isn't bad either.<br>just make sure you don't play like this guy</br></br>  <br>I can Mugi reading Akira, and probably gangsta as well.</br>  Is it true that Mugi is mostly liked by mostly Blacks?<br><br>C/D?</br></br>  <br>She canonically has a black boyfriend</br>    <br>keions are sexy</br>  <br>Yes but they are also pure, nice, kind, modest,respectable people.<br>They are perfection  Azusa especially </br></br>  Which keion will get a boyfriend first and which one will get married first?  <br>Mio I reckon</br>  <br>I want to say Mugi</br>  <br>I thought gay marriage was illegal under the japanese constitution.</br>  <br>they'll move to canada then</br>  <br>Mio will be the first to get a boyfriend but Mugi will be the first to marry, an arranged marriage by her parents.</br>  <br>which keion will be the first to  do drugs? </br>   Mio getting a boyfriend <br><br>She won't</br></br>  <br>Ritsu by choice, Yui maybe if she's tricked into it.</br>  <br>Ritsu<br>Then Yui will do them by accident cause she's dumb</br></br>  <br>yui would probably do it if she saw ritsu do it.<br>azusa and mio would need a lot of convincing, though</br></br>  <br>correct</br>  <br>You really think Mio would need convincing? <br><br>You think Ritsu would do drugs in the first place?</br></br></br>  <br>You know Ritsu isn't gay, right?</br>  <br>I sure hope not, then I wouldn't be able to marry her</br>  <br>Everyone is gay for Mio</br>  <br>I was never much of a fan of the Yui/Azusa dynamic so my feelings for the movie are only lukewarm. I know Yamada loves them, however.<br><br>The best parts were when they were in Japan.</br></br></br>  <br> I was never much of a fan of the Yui/Azusa dynamic <br>why not? those were some of my favorite parts. especially when yui thought azusa was missing, that was tight</br></br>  <br>The entire movie is anime original, so it's not like it matters at all.</br>  <br> so it's not like it matters at all. <br>It's OBJECTIVELY the best part of the entire series</br></br>  <br>Quit using words you don't understand. It brings down the credibility of the entire KyoAni fanbase.</br>  I came here to say Azunyan is best.  what would season 3 be about?  <br> why not? those were some of my favorite parts. <br>Well, I didn't hate it, but I wasn't in love with it either. It's just that the movie focused on them so heavily that I realized I like them the most in moderation. <br><br>It's a little difficult to pinpoint on the reason why. It's been so long.  I think there's a possibility I just don't like Azusa that much.  </br></br></br></br>  <br> OBJECTIVELY </br>  <br> that whole arc <br>Also anime original. Maybe there's a pattern here?</br></br>  <br> I think there's a possibility I just don't like Azusa that much. <br>why?</br></br>  <br>Outstanding post my friend</br>  <br><br>tricked</br></br>  <br> Also anime original. <br>I know both are anime original. Everyone should. That's why I referenced Yamada liking them. And probably a few more people on the staff.</br></br>  <br> I think there's a possibility I just don't like Azusa that much. <br>Opinion discarded due to shittaste</br></br>  <br>I was referencing the pattern that you don't like the anime original parts as much as you do the ones adapted directly from the manga.</br>  <br>The inevitable breakup of the band<br>they all go their separate ways in college<br>yui becomes a NEET</br></br></br>  <br>no</br>  <br>You are that same lad that appears in threads to tell them they haven't read the manga even if they have and that the anime is shit aren't you</br>  <br> you don't like the anime original parts as much as you do the ones adapted directly from the manga. <br>I can understand how you would make that guess, but it's not correct. I enjoyed the second season much more than I did the first, and thought KyoAni made the right decision in doing their own thing in several places in the story.<br>Also, I wasn't particularly saying that I didn't really like that arc in the anime.<br><br><br>It's not that I don't like her at all. Maybe I just don't like her as much as the others.<br>Although speaking of the first season, I remember her introductory arc did make her seem pretty shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You couldn't prove it if I was, so what does it matter? It's already established that you dislike KyoAni's additions to the K-ON! franchise. What are you going to do about it? Recant your previous statements?</br>  <br>Not the guy you were quoting m80 pot80</br>  <br> Also, I wasn't particularly saying that I didn't really like that arc in the anime. <br>Be honest, you're backtracking because you found out you agreed with an antagonist.</br></br>  <br>I'd lick that hairband</br>  <br>Swap Ritsu and Yui and you're good to go.</br>  Fuck you, Adhamm.  <br>If you don't like yui, then you're missing something. maybe part of your brain perhaps</br>  <br> yui becomes a NEET <br>would watch</br></br>  <br>Honestly, I'd say the last 6 episodes were the best.<br>The movie came close, but it was too bad that they already used their A material in the series.<br>That scene on the roof didn't really mean much to me as the end of episode 20</br></br></br>  How come the keions never talk about boys?  <br> as the end of episode 20 <br>Are you an idiot?</br></br>  <br>I don't know how can anyone hate any of the K-Ons. They are absolute perfection. Each and every one of them is perfect in her own way. <br>Maybe Yui is the perfectest.</br></br>  <br>why do you think?</br>  <br>don't agree with me, tripfag! people will think i'm wrong</br>  <br> Be honest, you're backtracking <br>No, I really just posted that image because it was relevant and came up in my folder. I really meant to post this one, but my K-ON folder is too poorly organized.<br><br>Honestly, I don't remember if I like that episode or not since I haven't watched it since it aired. Maybe I should watch it again. I did like the song that came out of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>THERE HE GOES AGAIN THE ABSOLUTE MADMAN LOOK AT HIM GO WAHEYYY</br>  <br>I absolutely love moeblobs without personalities 8)</br>  <br>A-are you okay, anon?</br>  <br>I'm fine thanks for asking, just making sure everyone is able to witness the argumentative mastery this man is performing</br>  <br>  8) <br>fuck off back to your containment board</br></br>  <br> Talking about moeblobs <br> K-On thread. <br>Does not compute.</br></br></br>  <br>Have to agree with him that some of the keions have more depth to their characters than others though, I'd say Ritsu and Azusa are the most complex while Yui and Mugi are the least</br>  Mugi  <br>Same sequence without the homosexual romantic implications?<br>Also you like the YuiAzu version of Fudepen Ballpen? To me it felt hollow, like it was clearly lacking Mio and Ritsu's input, like it was being played by half of a band.</br></br>  Why is Mio so sexual?  <br> character depth <br> K-On <br>You may only pick one, now and forever.</br></br></br>  <br> homosexual romantic implications <br>Remove yuri goggles<br><br> YuiAzu version of Fudepen Ballpen <br> hollow, lacking </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some have more than others, I'm comparing them with each other not with other anime</br>  <br>First panel of what he posted. How can that be taken any way other than yuri bait? KyoAni likes doing this kind of thing, this is an established fact.</br>  jesus christ, sameface has gotten bad.  <br>There's no more "yuribait" in that scene in the anime than in the manga</br>  <br>You know you are allowed to admit I'm right.</br>  <br>Do you have autism? Trouble understanding human emotions?<br>Is homosexuality really all you get from this scene</br></br>  <br> Do you have autism? Trouble understanding human emotions? <br>No, he just thinks and reasons with his dick</br></br>  <br>You know you are allowed to admit I'm right. <br><br>You go somewhere else.</br></br></br>  <br>And there we go he's done it again as predicted</br>  <br>So are you or are you not going to admit I'm right? Because I have more interesting things to do and you're kind of being a nuisance.</br>  <br> I have more interesting things to do <br>Doubt it~~~~</br></br>  <br>But you aren't right. the yuri in that scene was nominal at best and as  pointed out, that scene was going in depth about the friendship between yui and azusa, and how they really care for eachother. take your glasses off, man.</br>  <br> going in depth about the friendship between yui and azusa, and how they really care for eachother <br>You really think that? I thought I was conversing with intelligent human beings. Boy, was I wasting my time. Adios, retarded KyoAnifags.</br></br>  <br>NO PLEASE ANON PLEASE I WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT HOW YOU ARE RIGHT ALWAYS ABOUT EVERYTHING</br>  <br>Yeah, I do really think that because I'm not a horny dumbfuck who thinks everything is lesbian.<br>f/u/ck off and kill yourself</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127892950 <br>What if I told you that I was the rusemaster in this game of humorous deception  didn't see that sick plot twist coming did you friend </br>   yurifags   <br> inferring something as yuri means you're horny <br>そーだったのか！？</br></br>  <br>well when you believe everything under the sun is yuri, then yeah, you probably are just horny</br>  <br>Says the person who declared the manga strip to also be yuri.</br>  <br>But yuri porn is terrible. The only boner yuri tickles is the one in my heart.</br>  <br> Says the person who declared the manga strip to also be yuri. <br>I did no such thing.<br><br>well, that's just a matter of opinion.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I did no such thing. <br>Then how else would you interpret ?</br></br>  <br>I didn't write that. I don't believe there was any yuri in the anime worth mentioning.</br>  <br>Then perhaps the assumption that seeing yuri = horny is a matter of opinion as well.<br> A wrong one. </br></br>  <br>How does it feel to so blatantly lie on an anonymous imageboard?</br>  <br>I don't think that is the same guy m8</br>  <br>There were two sentences in the post to which I commented.</br>  are you happy now, faggot?  <br>Whatever point there was, you completely missed.</br>  about now is the point where he will start saying that the image is shopped or something. I'm calling it.  <br>that anon keeps saying that I'm samefagging. Just here to prove him wrong</br>  <br>No allegations of samefagging were ever made.

Is there anyone who actually prefers Yui singing to Mio?  <br>All songs would be better with Mio on lead vocals.</br>  <br>A singer is supposed to also be a frontman, something of which Mio is incapable.

I'm thinking simply comfy duvet mode with some tea.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like how Ritsu totally sits like a dude while everyone else is mindful of their skirts all the time.<br>I'd say rewatch the episode where they sing tenshi ni fureta yo to Azusa then watch the movie if you have the time. The movie is essentially the prequel to that episode.<br>I watched it while drinking and it was pretty fun and  emotional. </br></br></br>  I miss Yotsuba C  <br>Same.</br>  <br>Ritsu is like a bro</br>  <br>She almost saved the band from being bad when they were choosing a name and song themes, but failed.</br>  I am literally going to marry Azusa.  <br>Get in line.</br>  <br>Ritsu is my favorite Keion.<br>She likes Keith Moon too so she's extra best girl.</br></br>  <br>There is no line only me and Azusa in a happy marriage and forming a husband/wife jazz duo, living in a small comfy apartment with one room converted into a studio and eventually having one child who we will teach guitar from a young age creating another little Azusa who will continue the cycle of guitar prodigy in our family.<br> picture related its an artist's rendition of what our child may look like </br></br>  Does this ever actually happen in the show. I don't remember it being in it but I've seen a few images like this.  <br>Why don't you watch it and find out fam<br> Azusa knows DFC is best C </br></br>  <br>I watched it.</br>  <br>I can't think of any context in which that scene might occur</br>  <br>I guess niggas just like putting melon pan on flat girls.</br>  no, somebody was just having fun with meronpan and azunyan pretending to have breasts  <br>Niggas need to get some taste</br>  <br>I guess it's okay to be gay anon.</br>  <br>Everyone is jealous of Mio's Mios.<br>Disgusting Flat Chest get out.<br>Delicious Cow Tits forever.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>I want to live in Mio's boobies.</br>  I will defend cow tits till my dying breath.<br>Mio is not the best example but for keions she will have to do.<br>Breasts are filled with the hopes and dreams of men. Therefore flat girls are not worth pursuing.</br></br>  <br>Amen.</br>  Are k-on bros watching the best new CGDCT, gakkou gurashi?  <br> I judge a girl solely on their ability to give a good titjob <br>Typical cowtitfags</br></br>  I like Azusa the best shes the cutest and i like her guitar and her twin tails i wanna play with them and bounce them around and make cruiser noises with my mouth    <br><br>Brother.<br>I bet when Mio hits college she would have the most bangin' bod on the block.<br>I feel bad for the other girls, knowing that they will never be as popular or as sexy as the shy bassist.</br></br></br></br>  <br> It was a joke </br>  <br>I want to hug her and wrap her twintails around us both</br>  <br><br>i wanna hung her legs and rub my face against her socked feet</br></br>  <br>Good titjobs are excellent, but that's not all.<br>I admire their shape, their touch, their smell.<br>How my hands cannot grasp it all, yet they'll be damned if they don't try.<br>The way they bounce, sway, and jiggle.<br>How they look in clothes and without.<br>Cow tits are what make a girl. A best girl at least.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to snuggle up next to her on the sofa and rest my head on top of hers</br>  I'm only on episode8 of season 2 but I want to know they plan on continuing it past season 2? Anyone willing to share that information with me?  <br>There are some OVAs and the film.<br>Season 3 was going to be made to fit the slot that Tamako Market eventually took so there's still hope  r-right? </br></br>  <br>K-ON is dead mate. It'll never get a third season</br>  <br><br>I'm a Azusa fag, but I'll admit Mio does have some nice oppai</br></br>  <br>This thread, the publicity the keions' birthdays still get, the 5th anniversary merch selling and the recent event at Toyosato show it's not</br>  <br>The whole point of merch is to jew out after they don't want to produce any more anime, of course it's selling. The anime is dead</br>  <br>Whether the anime is or not, K-ON certainly isn't dead and likely won't be for some time<br> I'll be there to celebrate the 10th anniversary </br></br>  <br>I'd take Mugi to see Radiohead. Would she like Radiohead? Oh God what if she doesn't like Radiohead! What kind of music do sophisticated, smart, beautiful girls like???? HELP PLEASE</br>  <br>Get away from my waifu and kill yourself autist</br>  <br>I'd take Azusa to see Rancid, or maybe Off With Their Heads.<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/FPMIykGBIMg  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Mugi will never be yours so long as she's mine. Hand in hand, we're going to get our degrees and travel the world and pursue passions and comfort each other in times of pain and settle down in a cozy villa and make love even when our bodies are frail and die without ever dying in each other's hearts and i'll be damned if some fucking goofy cunt from 4chan disguised as a seraph attempts to steal my Annabelle Lee from her Kingdom by the Sea. She's mine, and she loves me.<br><br>Now, i'll ask one more time: Would Mugi like Radiohead? It's really important.</br></br></br>  <br>The K-On franchise is like, 2/3 anime original anyway.<br><br>Only S1 stayed close to the 4koma.<br>They did whatever they wanted in the S2, and even invented a movie.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Get away from my waifu and kill yourself autist</br>  <br>If only death would bring me closer to her. Unfortunately, a world of darkness is a world without Mugi No, I will never get away from MY waifu, and I will never kill myself so long as she lives. Go ride the shortbus back to speech therapy class so you can learn to talk to girls more in your league- the ones with dicks, perhaps?</br>  <br>As much as I like fapping to futa and traps, get away from my waifu and kill yourself autist</br>  Why are Mugifags so autistic  There are people in this thread right now, that literally dislike Mugi.  <br>You do not deserve more replies from me, pederast. Do not mistake this for me going out quietly. Mugi and I will be long gone by the time you read this, being free and being one, the croons of Thom Yorke and the coos of my love filling the air of the night with music and sweetness. A man in love does not need to ward off the suitors of his mistress, for he knows that she would not leave him as your arm would not leave your torso. As the dust collects in the wake of our leave, you'll still be left alone, a ball and chain around your ankle, an empty heart writhing rhythmically, and a disloyal dick that pricks for faces and bodies not belonging to the one you claim to love. She will love Radiohead because she loves me. You will still be shitposting because she does not love you.</br>  <br>Get away from my waifu and kill yourself autist</br>  <br>And I thought KyoAni were bad at drawing hands</br>  I forget, the movie falls chronologically after episode 22 right? Or was it 23?  <br>It's like in between and at the same time as 22-24, you couldn't actually watch it chronologically without splitting the film into parts and watching some parts of it at the same time as parts of episodes</br>  <br>Ah okay, thanks. The first time I watched K-On I watched the movie after finishing the series, so I wanted to do try going chronologically this time.</br>  <br>Just watch it at the end, there's not really any way to fit it in</br>  <br> not using the style that's as dark as your soul </br>  Mio a best, followed closely by Azusa, followed not so closely by Mugi, followed WAY behind by the other two  <br>Your opinion is incorrect</br>      <br>Mio is best slut, not best girl</br>  <br>i watched it after the first season because i was mislead by the single exclamation mark in the title. i only noticed what i had done when i started the second season.</br>  <br>so you watched the movie in between the first and second season?</br>  <br> sexualizing the Mio <br>that's against the rules</br></br>  <br>What else would I do with mio.

Is this some pro-life film about abortion or something? Why do we think this is the greatest anime ever made again?

It means whatever you think it means, you're just supposed to think about how it made you feel.  It's about innocence's end, you idiot.  <br>This. Works that aim to evoke pure feeling over meaning are pretty great.</br>  nice  Let's time travel!  Just finished season 2 of Knights of Sidonia and absolutely loved it. Hoping for a season 3, but in the meantime I will be reading the manga from beginning to end.  I would like to hear more opinions on the anime/manga  the anime isnt really all that great once you read the manga.<br><br>Niheis art is just so fucking awesome, and the CGI is just meh.<br><br>Even the action-scenes are so much more dynamic in still-frames than in the anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No S3. Flopped in Japan.</br>  <br>Well, at least we got some baller figs out of it<br>That's all I care about</br></br>  <br>Nihei's pacing is quite terrible. Anime fixed that at certain level.<br><br>The anime just lacks of horror stuffs and Imperialism Japan style uniforms.</br></br></br>  <br> 5k for a CG show <br> flopped <br>Pls anon.</br></br></br>  Who wants to buy this?  <br>I liked the manga more, but the anime is good as well. I think the haremshit is kind of overdone (more obvious in the anime) and it doesn't really add anything to the story or to the characters. With the latest developments in the manga I hope there won't be as much time for that sort of shit.</br>    Best blowfish.  <br>Did they fuck?<br>You know, the MC and the tranny.</br></br>  Why the Lightining sisters dont use magic and gunblades?  <br>...<br>fuck.</br></br>  <br> yfw tsumugi is literally a dick <br><br> Fuck why does she look sexy  , fucking warframe did this </br></br></br>  <br>Because itlooks like shes wearing a fancy dress.</br>  <br>Can she self destruct and destroy Sidonia when she reaches critical butthurt mass?</br>  <br>I am up to chapter 54 and MC and Izana didn't fuck as far as I can see</br>  <br>because.....fuck...she is my fetish now</br>    <br>Of course.</br>  <br>spoiler alert that is how the series ends</br>  S1 was superior in every single way, S2 dropped the ball but the last couple of episodes were a joy to watch.<br><br>That beautiful setting wasted on romance shenanigans, My heart bleeds.</br></br>  <br>Soo.... no?<br><br><br> we will never know what they said to each other ;-; </br></br></br></br>  <br> we will never know what they said to each other ;-; <br>I want summer to go and stay go</br></br>  <br>I feel with what the did in S1 and S2 they could easily wrap it up with a final season S3 <br><br><br>I'm so fucking mad about that...I just imagine it is some harem mushy stuff, but still..</br></br></br></br>  <br> he thinks summer is real <br>Confirmed new as fuck</br></br>  <br>10k first season. Why do you think they got an original ending plug in S2?</br>  <br>You are for a ride on who fucks whom.</br>  <br><br>for MANY DAYS</br></br>  <br> we will never know what they said to each other ;-; <br>Confirmed new as fuck.</br></br>  <br>I didn't make that post, retard.<br>I see you haven't yet grasped the concept of anonymity.<br>Don't worry, you'll get there.</br></br></br>  Would just weaponizing the EnaJiro instead of using her to make Smoogy prevent the story from flopping like it did?  <br>Pretty much this. I still liked it though, but it could have been so much better, shit.</br>  <br>I doubt it's capable of that, in the end the incredible sturdiness of Gauna comes from their true bodies, not the placenta. If it all came down to placenta Sidonia could chuck those planet-destroying missiles at every Gauna they run across and give 0 fucks.</br>  <br>Moshi moshi?</br>    <br>I would totally watch that version of the show.<br>All space explosions all the time.<br>Probably be a shit manga though.</br></br></br>    <br>Best daki.</br>   tfw no penis waifu     <br> mfw </br>  <br>Nah, all space explosions wouldn't work for too long, I think showing the way people live when their entire civilization is on a spaceship has quite a bit of potential. My issues with the haremshit is that it doesn't fit the themes/motifs, doesn't advance the story and doesn't even really build up the characters. It's there just to be there. For instance I think the romance when Hoshijiro and Nagate were stranded fit very well with what Sidonia is about, but a lot of the other shit doesn't take advantage of the setting at all and just dilutes it in the end. There needs to be some counterbalance to the explosions and that could be SoL, but it should've been done much better.</br>    <br>Where the booze at nigga?</br>  <br>That's sound reasoning.<br>I think showing the Sidonia settling into colonization after the Gauna threat is eliminated or at least pushed back could be an interesting and setting appropriate counterbalance. But maybe I just want to see how long until the colonies would degenerate into Borderlands death worlds.</br></br>  <br>Choo choo!</br>  <br>Just got to that chapter...I vomited</br>  <br>yup..abandon ship</br>  <br>aaannnddd suddenly I don't want a S3...</br>  <br>The chapter that Smoogy is  kill  ?</br>  <br>nope...pic related</br>  TFW doing it with Tsumugi would sound like this:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9ON<wbr>7KuzCl_s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>How much advanced is the story in the manga compared to the anime? I want to start reading it but I don't know if better wait until there's more content.</br>  <br> but I don't know if better wait until there's more content. <br>you've got 75 chapters worth of content</br></br>  <br>read it, but skip chapter 63</br>  <br>Yeah, but I don't want to leave the story at the same point as the anime while waiting for new chapters<br><br><br>Now I'll have to read it to check that chapter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But then you wouldn't get the most out of chapter 66.</br>  <br> Smoogy is kill <br>That happens? The day is saved!</br></br>  <br>Did I miss something in chapter 66?</br>  <br>Anime is like 2/3 of the way through the current content.<br><br><br>Could be interesting as a spinoff, but a lot of the Sidonia atmosphere hangs on the desperation that inherently comes with the fact that they're always one successful Gauna attack away from being completely wiped out IMO.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're lying and you know it. The chimera scene and the scene of Kagate award ceremony lead up to (the possible) season three where Ochai plan is implement and kagate is raise onto a bigger heroic status to raise moral for the incoming war against the giant Gauna colony. Hihei liked the adaption and the studio enjoyed animating SOK. <br><br>A season three is entirely possible.</br></br></br>  <br> MANY DAYS </br>  <br>Do everyone get laid?</br>  <br>Just the MC.<br><br>not any girls, not any monsters, no... just the MC.</br></br></br>  <br> Kagate <br> Ochai <br> Hihei <br> SOK <br>what the fuck am I reading</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sidonia of Kishi, of course.

Any reason for the joint formation flight? No air friction in space. Love it tho  <br> Any reason for the joint formation flight? <br>Not explained in the manga but 2 theories floating around:<br><br>1. Some kind of Hyggs particles resonance that allows for bigger acceleration.<br>2. Guardians can't use their engines at full power alone because of stability / control issues.<br><br>These are just general ideas. Explanations with more details in archive of both /a/ and /m/.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It looks neat. A lot of the people calling the manga hard sci-fi either don't read/watch much sci-fi or haven't thought about it too hard. It speculates about things not commonly considered but Nihei is not trying to make something as plausible as Planetes.</br>  <br>Someone mentioned the center of gravity being at the center of the circle or some shit. I know jack shit about physics.</br>  <br> no director's cut <br><br>That's wrong, both season last episode are director's cut</br></br></br>  S3 was shit.

It's not bad enough to rule out a third season.</br></br></br>  <br><br> fuck the clone of your crush who rejected you 100 year ago <br><br>I'm not sure I've read up to this (last I read was collecting the robot off the planet), but does he finally know that he's a clone by this stage or did some mutual attraction develop between them?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He seems aware that penis-chan is 'that girl I was into but got eaten, then a alien clone of her was found and finally mutated into a large combat space penis, who is also attracted to me'. Not sure if Tsugimi knows most of how she came to be, at least seems to know what the feelings are.</br></br>  <br> but does he finally know that he's a clone <br>She tells him right before that he's a genetically modified clone of Hiroki and that they (Kobayashi, Hiroki, Lala and Ochiai) go way back. Exactly how much she tells him isn't clear since it's just a few pages in the manga. Nagate says she "told him everything" but that's hardly reliable.</br></br>  <br><br>Arrive at desto as a group I guess?<br><br>They should be traveling huge distances, grouped together they won't land as spread out, or at least if there's an engine fail don't get stranded. Working together won't increase the speed unless there's some combo magic with the magic particles.</br></br></br></br>  <br> then a alien clone of her was found and finally mutated into a large combat space penis <br>Tsumugi isn't a Hoshijiro clone. She is the daughter of a Hoshijiro clone.</br></br>  <br> finally mutated into a large combat space penis <br>But that's completely wrong. Tsumugi isn't mutated EnaJiro, she's actually EnaJiro's daughter, as in somebody intentionally impregnated the Gauna-made clone of Hoshijiro and the child was a chimera, namely Tsumugi.</br></br>  <br><br>Guess I'll have to read up and find out why he'd even fuck her at this point, considering the sizable harem he already has, that's already tried to make moves on him.</br></br>  <br><br><br>So after the events of S2, there's now 2 EnaJiro's in Ochiai's lab? Not sure why but I just assumed he fucked it and then it mutated because space magic.</br></br></br>  <br>There's one in Ochiai's possession (at least until he takes over Kanata's body) and one with Toha.</br>  <br>None of the harem members really made a move as direct and straightforward as Kobayashi though. Nagate is dense as fuck, subtlety won't work.</br>  DIRECTOR's cut when???  <br>EnaJiro (first one) is in Ochiai's possession, BeniJiro (from Benisuzume) is locked up in a crate at Toha according to the manga.</br>  Can anyone point me towards the MT ftp? That whole revival project appears to be dead, but I'd like to DL KoS.  <br><br>Ignore me, found it and it's been revamped well.</br></br>  <br>If BeniJiro dies in that box, will she become the Box Ghost?</br>  <br>Wait, she doesn't have the cowtitumors from the show.</br>  <br>haha agreed he probably thinks that is the way you act around people you "like"</br>  And if you don't like?  <br>constantly apologizing for absolutely no reason probably</br>  <br>Not sure if her art appeal is suppose to be a trap, even tough she is technically a girl now, or just vaguely tomboyish even with the cow tumors that are sometimes there sometimes not</br>  <br>Ain't Izanas that big in the manga?</br>  <br>Netflix</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>only sometimes</br>  <br>Nice.</br>   We will never see Brozana again   <br>Hey, she's bro as fuck in the manga. Always has been.</br>  <br>doesn't count</br>  <br>Why doesn't it count?</br>  <br>You know why.</br>  <br>If I did I wouldn't be asking.</br>  Reminder that Izana is the only person Tanikaze cares about as much as rice balls.  Have you not been paying attention?  <br><br> Smoogi sees Tanikaze as her Onii-chan <br> Hoshijiro likes him because he rescued her and drank her piss. <br> Yuhata just likes him because he's famous. <br> Kobayashi loved his "grandfather" <br> Samari likes his skills and is a drunk <br> Izana cared about him since the beginning like a bro and later as a girl. <br><br>To sum up, everyone is a bitch except Izana, best girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Glad the truth is finally being seen.  <br> Smoogi sees Tanikaze as her Onii-chan <br>You really should change this part of the pasta.</br></br>  <br> &gt;Smoogi sees Tanikaze as her Onii-chan <br>It's likely more than that at this point in the manga.</br></br>  Why do I get the feeling that she's just as batshit insane as blue snow?  Blue Tundra a pure girl who wants the freedom to pretend to be a dirty girl.<br><br>Anna, though, she is going to be 200% pure degeneracy. Puritanical repression has fostered inside her heart a variety of hardcore, filthy fetishes. I bet Anna would enjoy practicing extreme femdom, including golden showers and even faceshitting. <br><br>The question is would you be willing to eat her poop? I bet Gorilla-kun would.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She would be more insane. Panties-on-head gets her daily release, while this bitch keeps everything in and lets it grow.<br><br>Once she first learns of the dark side, it'll start off slow. Then she'll gradually ask for more and more until she starts pinning you down and just taking what she wants without asking.</br></br></br>  <br> good girl  <br> scat fetish  <br>my dick will achieve a new level of diamonds</br></br></br>  <br>Blue Tundra is the only one who is pure.</br>   OOHHHHHOHOHOHOHOOOOOOHHHHHHOHOHOOH<wbr>OHO</wbr>   <br><br>I want her doujins to feature her letting herself slip into depravity and degeneracy through porn and masturbation to sick fetishes instead of being raped like how it usually fucking goes.</br></br>  <br><br>and then Chapter 2 will be with her finally caving and raping someone else just to satisfy her desires right</br></br>  <br><br>Sounds like someone I know of already.</br></br>  <br>Only difference is silver hair would become hard S.</br>  Is this a prequel to SYD?  <br>Who is this boner bender?</br>  <br> batshit insane as blue snow? <br>you tell me, op</br></br>  <br>Were you even paying attention anon?</br>  <br>I hope Snow Blue Snow gets violently raped.

Then when for some reason she comes across the MC naked, she just mounts him because of her primal instinct that she has been repressing all of her life, and just rides his dick disregarding the pain of having her hymen being ripped until he cums in her. <br> mfw most of the girls are like this. </br></br>  <br>If true then Shimoneta might be the anti-Danna ga Nani that we need</br>  <br>Sauce plz</br>  <br>Did she drug him or something?

So MC got cucked? Did he liked it?<br>My inner cuck would like to know more.</br>  <br> actual zetsubou ending in a LN series <br>If this happens I'll buy every volume twice.</br></br>  <br>This. From reading this thread it seems like episode 1 was an anomaly and the rest will be pure shit.</br>  <br>It'll probably go right back to penis jokes after that arc.</br>  <br> without the forced drama that this will devolve into. <br>High jackings and terrorism aren't forced.</br></br>  <br>You can't raise the stake like that and then go back to low brow humour anon. Either the series is going to get depressing and end in MC rejecting all 3DPDfor being corrupt or it becomes shit with awkward jokes.</br>  <br>Because a girl with a smell fetish is an uncurable raging slutwhore, and honest-to-god sluts are the best.</br>  <br>I'm going to have to drop this show, aren't I?</br>  <br>What the fuck is this edgy shit? I thought this was about lighthearted humor. This is also probably the final episode, shit.<br><br>Jesus Christ why</br></br></br>  <br>The naked gun?</br>  <br>This series suddenly seems like shit.<br><br>The first episode is not indicative of the rest of the show?</br></br></br>  <br>Apparently it turns out silver haired slut chan is like a mole of this guy, who is the main big bad of the story.</br>  <br>Dropped like a bad habiy</br>  <br>fucking lame</br>  <br>I REFUSE TO BELIEVE</br>  <br>Nah hes a betafuck for his shonenshit personality. Hell since the series is going to devolve into  you have no fucking right to defend it</br>  <br>You can never drop a bad habit, anon. It'll haunt you for all eternity.</br>  <br>Sure</br>  <br>You're shitting me.</br>  <br>Well, mc is saying "you won't shoot me because these are authentic middle school girl's panties covering me", so it doesn't seem like super srs bsns. Well I can't read the other stuff so I can't say for sure.　</br>  So the creator made the silver haired girl a slut and the foul mouthed girl a virginal prude so that the public will want the MC to get with the black haired girl instead?  <br>You want me to just post the chapter?</br>  This thread is making me depressed.<br><br>I thought this was a 12 episode series of Blue Snow acting like a perverted retard. I hope I won't have to drop this.</br></br>    <br>I hope the maincharacter just decides "fuck it" and breed with silver-chan and forget the other hoes.</br>      <br>Yes.</br>  <br>That one crazy woman scientist from Index</br>  <br>My expectations have definitely been lowered.</br>  <br> didn't even pay the bus fare <br>This evil cannot stand!</br></br>  <br><br><br>Guy covered in patsu was introduced previous chapter.

Elaboration please.</br>      <br>So I guess this guy is some kind of big bad? As soon as this shonen plot even hints at showing up I'm dropping this.</br>        <br>This is Kill la Kill again.</br>  <br>My Dick.<br><br><br>MY DICK.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Page 15 was </br>  Shit. I never saw a more misleading first episode, maybe Evangelion but Shinji was already angsting from the beginning.  <br>Once again, he didn't pay the bus fare. How is this allowed?</br>    <br> only survivor of a plane crash caused by some perverts <br> an insane doctor recreated his body from the panties of the crash victims <br> he's invisible to the lewd-censoring system </br></br></br>    <br>Also the plane was a giant flying dildo.</br>    <br>Why on Earth possessed the author to do this? What made him think this was a good direction to go in?</br>   Ecchi garbage turns out to be shoneshit garbage <br><br>And nothing of value was lost</br></br>         watch show expecting to find some lighthearted comedy ecchi about an mc who slowly accepts his own sexuality <br> When suddenly we poorly done shonen now <br>It's been fun, /a/. Reminder to shitpost in all future threads about this abomination from now on, it is your duty</br></br>  <br>And that's the chapter.</br>  <br>Didn't know Bane was a pervert.</br>  <br> &gt;only survivor of a plane crash caused by some perverts <br><br>So perverts actually fucking kill people? What the fuck?</br></br></br>  Wow, you guys are cranky, this seems too over the top to be serious<br><br>Wait for the real OP/ED and see if they foreshadow this stuff first before flipping your lids.</br></br>  <br>Dropped so hard I'm going to delete the first episode now.</br>  <br>Luvia?</br>  ITT:retards who judge something they can't even read nor it is finished.  Why are people so mad?  <br>The problem is that the first episode misleading. <br><br>It turns out perverts aren't just crazy bastards that want people to accept their sexuality, they're actual terrorists that commit murder, plane hijacking etc, making the whole thing a grey vs grey morality, considering that every side has it's own rotten apples.</br></br></br>  <br>That outfit does things to my heart</br>  <br> how do you know it's shit if it isn't even out yet? </br>  <br>im pretty sure its just like 2 autists spamming</br>  <br>SMT morality there.<br>Both sides are too extreme.</br></br>  <br>And my dick.</br>  <br><br>The problem with this show is that the setting itself doesn't actually help create that many jokes and often just limits them.<br><br>Like the wristbands. The author totally realizes that they limit it, but only one girl has a device to unlimit them. And then she just uses it to shout random obscenities. <br><br>Every joke that was done in the first episode will just be repeated, and the jokes aren't that good, neither are the characters.<br><br>SYD has a better cast, better gags, and uses its setting to the utmost (and sets up extremely long gags like the squid joke).<br><br>Others use better or weirder settings to create unique gags. This one is just held back by setting.<br><br>Even for what kind of show this is, it's not on the same league as others that have cum before it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hoe would you feel if there was a hidden vibrator relentlessly attacking her womb under that pure and innocent white dress?</br>  <br> hs <br>An absolute get the fuck out</br></br>  <br>Reference to psy cop ass.</br>  <br> downloading another release later only to take screenshots  <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>It was a part of his plan.</br>  <br> Both sides are too extreme. <br><br>Yeah but this pisses me off. This show was supposed to be Blue Snow making people accept that sex is a natural concept by performing outrageous acts.<br><br>The problem is that by portraying some perverts as ISIS tier terrorists it somehow justifies the current society is the lesser evil.<br><br> Hey, we may repress you of your sexuality, but at least we don't crush planes in name of something like sex <br><br>It's like the whole anime negates itself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What's wrong with having a serious approach later on? You can't rely with the same jokes over and over again.  <br>nothing wrong, just some autists being mad</br>  <br>Because then it's just an anime that doesn't know what it wants to be.</br>  <br>The ED didn't have any of this, just goofy mascots chasing.<br><br>What if the anime never adapts any of this, whatcha gonna do then</br></br></br>  <br>welp<br>this is going to be<br> ebin hero and his friend save the world <br>dropped this shit<br>thank for the advice</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But if those extremists who actually hurt people only came into being because of the society, it's a chicken and egg thing<br><br>It wouldn't have happened in the first place if society wasn't like that</br></br></br>  Just turn this shit into Porn already.  What does he say?  <br>The pleasure of being cummed inside the socks.</br>  <br>Do you want to have SOX with me?</br>  <br>Does he brainwash people with drugs and chastity inducement?<br><br> with forced orgasms? </br></br></br>  <br>Are you retarded? What is wrong with this?</br>      <br>Would corrupt and defile.</br>  <br><br>Because you can only repress a desire so much before it lashes out in unhealthy and destructive ways. <br><br>Blue Snow seems like a perv but that's only because she lets shit out in a restrained society.</br></br></br></br>  It appears that Ayane forms an alliance with Student Council against perverts that are too extreme  <br><br><br><br>I don't get why you retards have problem with this. Ayame and MC are terrorists.<br><br>Anyway, I really hope that villain is voiced by Koyasu</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> watching hs <br>Fucking pleb.</br></br>  <br>That's retarded. There's no such thing as too much pervert.</br>  <br> the most H shows get the least fap material </br>  <br>Interesting technique. <br>Will try.</br></br>  <br>It's like Robin Hood fighting real bandits, it doesn't make Prince John a good guy<br><br>boo fucking hoo</br></br></br>   no, actually, sex really is bad. it really does make people crazy enough to endanger society. the censors were right all along. <br>Sasuga Nippon. No wonder you stupid fuckers will die a nation of geriatric woman-fearing virgins.</br>  <br>1/10, could do better</br>    <br>She is such a pevert that she wouldn't still find it satisfying even if 2 men fuck her in mouth, 2 man in ass and vag, 2 menfucking her hands, 2 men sucking off her boobs and 1 man licking her back.<br>Even if not only her vag but her whole body were to go sore from fucking 100 black men non-stop for a whole week without any kind of pausing, even for sleeping or eating, she still wouldn't find it enough.<br><br>She literally wants all the dicks in the whole world.<br><br>She is the king of sluts.<br><br>Just keep looking forward to the next eps. You will like it very much.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So this show is nothing like this? I was hoping for a lighthearted comedy.  <br>K-kamui ?</br>  <br>You implied genre shift is bad?</br>  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE KAJO      While i agree that the first episode was really decieving i am kind of glad they atleast move the plot instead of staying the whole show on "muh misunderstandings" which gets old really fast. There isnt much room for many other jokes in this kind of setting other than shouting a few more lewd words and a few sexual inendos  <br><br><br><br><br>Jesus fuck, I thought the first two replies were just headcanon doujin material.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>God, that alter-ego switch between stuck-up bitch and turned-out pervert is the most boner inducing thing.</br>  I want to marry this woman and bless her with at least 4 children  <br>I know right?</br>  <br>Basically a superior Hana. She should be in Prison School, I'd be okay with her winning.</br>  <br>I hope they are still just as torpedo in the anime.<br><br>They look fucking grouse right there.</br></br></br>  <br>How would you do that?</br>  Is this going to end with a mass school orgy?  <br>a special hug after we fall in love and get married, then the baby-crane we graces us with babies.</br>  Fuck this cunt... What the hell is she doing to those poor boys?  <br> you will never swirl around a glass of finely aged piss with panties in it <br>That fucker is living the goddamn dream.</br></br>  <br>Sent to gulag for sperm milking.</br>  <br>Every time i see the thumbnail for this image, it looks like his arm is actually her leg and she is wrapped around his head</br>    <br>I did not know that humans are able to detach legs.<br><br>(I guess she would appear bigger on the picture if that were the case.)</br></br></br>  Is Anna the main girl?<br><br>Because I fucking hope she is.</br></br>  <br>Violent prison rape, no lube.</br>  <br>She's a massive slut pretending to be pure</br>  <br> She's a massive slut pretending to be pure <br>YESSSSS EVEN BETTER</br></br>  <br>Do they get longer sentences if they enjoy the rape?</br>  <br> Do they get longer sentences if they enjoy the rape? <br>Yes. As a side effect militant perverts are bred.</br></br>    <br> I really hope that villain is voiced by Koyasu <br>No. Masanori Ikeda fits him more. Take a look at him.

If porn VNs taught me something, I bet that Anna girl had a vibrator raging inside her pussy during that student council cpeech.  <br><br>nice fanfiction</br></br>  <br>Her first life experience was masturbating with a pillow at the age of 9<br><br>By the age of 30 she sold herself out to night clubs with the sole purpose of being fucked. <br><br>By the age of 40, she came to the point that she would pay people to fuck her. Her parents felt deeply shame and refused to talk to her for the rest of her life.<br><br>She would die of cocaine overdoes by the age of 53 years old and 9 aborts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  She looks hotter in her disguised mode.  <br>THIS<br>H<br>I<br>S</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>she just gets off on bucking the rules by cracking dirty jokes. <br><br>if she was really a lewd turboslut she'd distribute pictures where she's fingerbanging herself, but instead she just uses whatever softcore she can scour from b&amp; magazines<br><br>she talks a big game, but blushes like the pure maiden she is if the game's stakes get raised</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its the glasses</br>  <br> she talks a big game, but blushes like the pure maiden she is if the game's stakes get raised <br><br>I guess thats kind of the whole point of this.

He thought he was about to get raped by a random stalker.</br>    Anna is my favourite breeding girl in this series.  <br>Look at THIS queer</br>  <br>But I haven't seen her steal anything</br>  <br>Still a pure 10/10 breeding farm, my point still stands. You would literally have to be a superfag to say no</br>    <br>who's the slut on the right?</br>  <br>Terroristbitch is such shit, can't even handle a single erection staring her in the face.</br>  <br>probably this one<br/></br>  <br>blue tundra is all talk</br>  <br>That is why she's lame, even if she's a virgin no reason to be so prudish. Fucking Japan and their terrible ideals for main girls.</br>    <br>She still better than fake slut</br>  subs when?    <br>Not if your one of those purity fags who's support is based around pure and innocent image. It'd be disheartening or jarring.<br><br>Its best to like slut idols, if you find out they are pure maidens it'd would be gap moe or if you find out they are legitimate sluts you shouldn't be suprised.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Pure Girl <br> Shock exposure and following addiction </br></br></br>  <br>You might be gay Anon.<br><br>If I had a pure waifu, I would do everything I could to corrupt the fuck out of her and turn her into a massive slut. But I would still make sure she would keep a pure outward appearance.<br>Her slutness being between the two of us, and me being the only one realising how much of a slut she is only makes it that much hotter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She is already massive slut, and works for villain</br>  <br> not turning her over to your side and make her loyal to your penis instead </br>  Is blue snow supposed to mean something lewd?  <br>"For these moments, SOX is there right?"</br>    I DEMAND SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUBS    <br> she will never give you jerk-off instructions/encouragement </br>  <br> The question is would you be willing to eat her poop? <br>YES.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>What are the tags in sadpanda to get girls like her?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The question is would you be willing to eat her poop? <br>I'd eat the poop of all the female cast.<br>Without hesitation.<br>I'd eat it like ice cream.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What does Yuuya think about while fapping?</br>  <br>Such a fucking shitty MC couldn't manage that</br>  SUBS FUCKING WHERE?!  <br>she wouldnt have the guts for that when it came down to actual fucking</br>  <br>In before cream pie joke.</br>  <br>You know you are hot when Satan wants to eat your shit.</br>  <br>better</br>  <br>Good question, Anon. Also, why haven't the manga been translated?</br>  <br>Do you say "accept eating poo poo?"</br>  <br>/int/ pls<br><br>pls</br></br></br>  <br>What's Riko doing in im@s?</br>  <br> /a/tv </br>  <br>I know right?

Maybe it's for the better. </br>  <br>fucking cunts</br>   Decent Plot <br> Not Hentai or even nip peeks <br>Why world? JUST WHY<br><br><br>The best anime to have fap material are those that never have.<br><br>Why make an anime with so many sex related jokes &amp; where the plot is literally about sex &amp; shit and never have any decent ecchi</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you went to /int/ you'd see that its full of weebs, crossbo/a/rders and normalfags</br>  <br><br> If you reject a tomboy enough she'll become a gyaru. <br>Excellent</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder what /int/ would be like in this series. Would the gubmint ban it?</br>  <br>its always like this. The more lewd the show itself is the less actual hentai it gets. Cute girls doing cute things stuff get hentai the moment it spawns but ecchi shows looking pretty dire on that front.<br>It sucks but thats how it goes</br></br>  <br>Had so many hopes for this anime... All of them have been shattered now</br>  <br><br>Goddamn, fuck them.<br>They ruin everything everywhere.<br>If the term "thirdwordler" started being used in /vr/ it's their fault.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Purity is overrated. Sexuality is healthy.</br>  <br> Decent Plot </br>   I hate bananas   <br>still better than most ecchi-related &amp; hentai-related shows</br>  <br><br><br>she needs to be destroyed</br></br></br>  <br> Cute girls doing cute things stuff get hentai the moment it spawns <br>Except that's wrong. Yuribait SoLs barely get any porn, much less decent porn.</br></br>  <br>So is that really white wine like he says or is it a euphemism for piss? If it's the latter then he's villain of the century.</br>  O MA N  <br>Will we get an explanation about the teahouse owner? Is he a relative?</br>  Damn, this show is hillarious.  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>/sci/ has a lot of weebs as well</br>  <br>I'd volunteer to destroy her.

Maybe if it was just about a horny teacher.<br><br><br>That's recent and regular as far as manga scanlations go.</br></br></br>  <br>There was a long break before c 58 I believe. I've just been reading it raw for months now. It's on chapter 91 now.</br>  <br> Reading the description I suspect this isn't as great as that single page makes it look <br><br>It's actually pretty alright, teacher is just the cherry on top.</br></br></br>  Yuki's uniform edition  <br>But is that a highschool or middle school uniform?</br>  <br>What happens if I take off the hat?</br>  Yuki is crazy and has actually been walking around nude this whole time with a crowbar lodged in her asshole but everyone plays along because she's innocnt and it keeps them together      <br>I'm pretty sure they are highschool students.</br>  We don't need constant threads.  <br>Thanks, that's what I thought, just that the uniform looks a bit more something I'd imagine in a middle school but you're probably right.</br>  <br>This thread is unnecessary. There have been threads since it aired and there is no more to discuss.</br>  <br> Edition <br>Stop trying to shit everything up.</br></br>  <br>She loses the hat whenever she's forced out of her delusions, so she'd break down.<br><br>Or if it's the later Yuki, she'd take up a baseball bat and bash some skulls in.</br></br></br>  Is there anyone else who honestly thinks the average human being would have just stopped watching halfway through the episode and not continued through to WAHT A TWEEST. <br><br>You can only stretch out "catch that dog!" so far before you start wondering what the point is. At least a manga chapter doesn't take 20 minutes to read.</br></br>  <br>It would be extremely insane.</br>    I don't get it, why she is closing a broken window?  <br>It's cold outside, you should pay more attention.</br>  <br>Do we really have to explain?</br>  <br>Because it's opened</br>  <br>What do you mean? Looks fine to me.</br>  <br>I don't get it, why couldn't you grasp mental breakdown?</br>  Should I watch the anime or read the manga?  <br>We don't need you.</br>  <br>Both.</br>  <br>If you want to enjoy funpost with us go read manga.<br><br>Else, watch anime first.</br></br></br>  <br>If you haven't read the manga yet, then you might as well wait until the anime is over before picking it up, and not spoil the anime for yourself.</br>  <br>Since the anime has not finished airing yet, no idea. But if you want to watch it you better avoid the threads.</br>  <br> implying you will not spoil it to us </br>  <br>Hard to say since I read it beforehand.<br><br>I thought it had a lot of nice foreshadowing though.<br><br>People who usually watch SOL would sit through it anyway, which is probably what they were going for.</br></br></br></br></br>   DAISUKI    <br>You are on /a/. If you haven't read the manga, then you might as well as to shut this page down and stop coming onto /a/ until it's all said and done.</br>  <br>Why would I spoil it for you?</br>  <br> edition <br>When did these threads go so wrong? Is there any need to turn them into a general?</br></br>  <br> Is there any need to turn them into a general? <br>There isn't, but the threads steadily going downhill as we approached the anime airing was more or less expected.</br></br>  <br><br><br>You are all so mean</br></br></br>  <br>The second the anime aired.</br>   people getting triggered by the word edition   Why is every single window in the school broken anyway? Who broke them, because there's no reason for the zombies to have done it.  <br>Shovel broke them for fun</br>  <br>The seriousness of their situation was so thick the windows shattered.</br>  <br>Maybe they were tired with opening and closing the windows</br>  so i dropped bleach like 5 years ago. did they fuck yet?  Sometimes, I look at this and then I wonder if all this shit is caused by the editor, or by Kubo's actual own hand.<br><br>For how long this is going to continue? I mean, I usually enjoy background chapters but now I can't even say that honestly.</br></br>  I maintain that Soul Society and the end of the Fake Karakura Town are the best sections of any Shonen I've read/watched  <br><br>I have to agree with this. I would even say that Fullbringer was also decent untol the rushed end.<br><br>If only Mexico and this arc (hell, this is supposed to be the last one) mantained the same consistency.</br></br></br></br>  <br>My money are on Kubo, he just seems to believe too much in his talent and lost passion for his manga at the same time.</br>  <br>This makes me sad, because such things are actually reflected in these chapters.<br><br>And because we all know and experienced the actual things Kubo can do when he actually puts a lot of heart to it, he already has the talent.</br></br></br>  what is it about Haruhi that gives her that raw sex appeal?  <br>the seiyuu is a slut</br>  <br>The combination of looks, attitude and power. She's simultaneously a dream dominatrix and a dreamgirl for a sadist to tame.</br>  <br>This Haruhi is objectively more attractive than KyoAni Haruhi. People who are afraid of change are silly.</br>  <br>Tychus.</br>  <br>The only correct answer.</br>  The way things are looking, Madoka will be the anime of the decade.<br><br>Is /a/ alright with this?</br></br>  We still have almost half a decade left and you think you can crown yet another mahou shoujo as AOTD?  <br>That wasn't me. I was the one who made the post . I didn't attack you at all or make any of the suggestions that others posted. Besides, you make it sound as if I am the only one in the thread that made the claim.</br>  <br>I'm not that guy, but anyway, I never claimed that Madoka had any sort of impact. You asked for examples of things inspired by it, and I gave one. I don't see why you're getting so upset over it.</br>  <br>You're the one who says people's examples don't count for some arbitrary reason you refuse to explain</br>  <br>Kevin Spacey.</br>  Do they fuck? How?  <br>I've reached volume 5.<br>It hasn't jumped the sharks yet, very enjoyable to read, interesting characters.<br>Fights are a mean, not a goal.</br></br></br>  <br>I fucking hate power levels because essentially they are telling who will win and implying that a higher level can't make a mistake or a lower level can't do something that will catch a higher level off guard. Lowers attacks simply won't land cleanly.<br><br>The only time low beats high is when low is the MC.</br></br></br>   my face still no new manga chapter <br>I want Nico to kill that little Edgelord shota.</br>  <br>Henrietta is that you?<br> I want GG remake </br></br>  <br>That's exactly what's NOT going on here.</br></blockquote>]
