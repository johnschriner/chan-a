[ How technologically inclined is your waifu? Does she need help using computers? Is she a leading pioneer in her field?   Has your waifu made or repaired anything for you?     She can't really do that, she's not here physically after all, only in soul.  But my Yunocchi isn't a very technical person, that's for sure, but it's not like she's never used a computer! So Yuno would most likely ask for my help with anything technical around the house.      Makoto has a lot of technical stuff in his room like a TV, game consoles and a computer but he doesn't seem particularly knowledgeable about it in general, maybe above average. His strong fields are physical activities after all.   deder than bread up in here   She could use it just fine.    I don't really think she would be especially savvy. She shouldn't have much problems with just using computers or other devices, but she rather wouldn't be able to repair them.   It's not the best time to start thread.        Mai doesn't use computers and the type of weapon she uses was invented in the Bronze Age. So it could be argued that she isn't particularly proficient with technology.    She's got skills, can do the best programming, especially vidya. Well if it gets a virus or something, she can help me too.  Pretty much.  It's 1:45 am here, i think i will sleep and post again later   And at least leaving one question: Do you have something in common with your waifu?          Does your waifu ever have sleepovers with her friends? What does she do in them or what do you imagine she'd do if she doesn't have any?  (Mai does appear to do so based on this image. From what we can see, she and her friends appear to be trying on cosmetics such as nailpolish, styling their hair differently and putting on different clothes.)    I want to kiss my waifu on the nose.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127107959  What is the point of this post?    He's an underage spammer/shitposter.   Does your waifu resemble her parents or other relatives?  (Mai as a teenager does appear to resemble her mother. She's never shown clearly but they both have long hair of the same color and hair antennae. Beyond that she doesn't have any siblings and no other relatives of her other than her parent are shown.)     Well, with all the high-tech gear she uses, I'm guessing either she built them herself or she at least knows how to maintain them.  That is, she's much more technically inclined than I could ever be.    She's ronerier than I am.          We both are introvert and we both enjoy romantic setting/activities, I guess.   I dunno, she would probably just do usual activities in them like talking, having fun by styling each other hair.  She would be really embarrassed if someone asked her about relationship with me~    I want to kiss my waifu on everywhere. Especially on the lips.   No idea. There is no info about her parents.             We share a bunch of minor personality traits, but other than that we're not that alike, it's more that Yunocchi and I make a good match.   Usually when they have a little tea party in one of their apartments, it's easier and more fun to stay over.  Just normal teenage girl stuff, nothing particularly out of the ordinary.   She does, they are her parents after all.             Seeing as her very existence was erased/cursed by the most badass of overlords, nobody really knows if she even HAS parents.    In almost every way possible, we're exact opposites. She's incredibly determined, passionate, unyielding and has pretty damn good hand-eye-coordination. The only thing we have in common is probably the fact that we're both pretty shameless.   There isn't a single part of her body I wouldn't want to put my lips on.  What would you give your waifu for her birthday?  If I could somehow make it happen, I'd give my waifu  Makai Wars 2 .              She's really good with tech.   Not too much, I guess love for robots.   One ending in the game.   Looks somewhat similar to her sister.             She's probably adept at casual browsing but nothing of the programming sorts! She can most definitely handle most things on her end as long as it isn't too complex. She's definitely the leading pioneer in my heart's fields!  As for making or repairing, my dreams and my heart. She's made many of my nights wondrous, and a lot of my days bearable.   We've both had bad moments in our childhood and have trust issues.   She has! She either hogs the pools or stays away from all the ruckus and trouble.   She looks like a less mature and certainly less volatile version of her mother, and she'd probably get annoyed at me if I said that. She does share a lot of traits from both parents, but didn't really show much resemblance to them as a young child.   I wish I could keep giving her the same smiles and happiness that I often see her in. I wish I could keep giving every time, every day just to see her smile, but the times are a bit tough and I haven't had the ability to in the past eight months. It feels bad, but I hope that one day that it'll all even out and everyone goes home happy.                  Something she has lately showed interest in, eg. a dress she said that looks nice or jewelry she find nice. Otherwise, something related to her hobbies, like new microphone, headphones or something. And I would also take her on a really nice date to the place she really like, of course.   How long would you wait to have children with your waifu? Would you do it right now, wait until you get financially stable and had house or maybe wait for both of you reach particular age?        Never. I don't want children now or in the future.    I'd love it if she makes a song for me.  We're both weird and we like music.  I think she sleeps with her friend before her friend died. They were close and always stick together because of work, after all.  She doesn't resemble her uncle which is the only shown relative so far.  I'd give her a sword because she likes those.  I'd wait till we get married. Of course I want us to have a stable life first, we're married and has her family's approval before making kids, I don't want her family to get angry to her.              She's never used one before, so she'd need some help with it.  She makes my day.    Nothing major.   No, and i don't think they're really her kind of thing.   She shares some traits with her sister.   Something she's shown interest in, along with what i bake for her.   I'd wait until she'd be in good health.                    Very technologically inclined, for obvious reasons. Can't really say she's the leading pioneer though, as she's one of the mass-production models. Then again, she's the only remaining one, can't really say in that case. She aced all the engineering classes, so I'm betting she could fix most kinds of machinery. I'd want her to teach me some too.  A few things. We both like machines, have no patience for indirect approaches, say what's on our mind without holding back. She's a lot more positive and hopeful though.  Haven't seen her do sleepovers. But if she did, probably the same things girls do on such occasions. Talk a lot, be made to wear cute outfits, play those silly truth or dare games.  Just hope they don't decide to do a pillow fight, because if so, say goodbye to the bed.   I want to kiss her everywhere. But today, I'm inclined to forehead, in a loving praise sort of way.  Not in a physical sense. Despite mass production, they all differ from each other in small but significant ways. As for her 'mother', she resembles her very little.  I wish I could give her eternal happiness. But if you mean like an object, then I'd commission  Robocop's gun arm  for her. She might like it.  A trip to a science fair or an escapade to travel around and see the world are good options too.  Wait until we've accomplished all our dreams, so that we can finally settle down with no regrets. Then we can  construct  offspring, maybe adopt too.                    Hello!  He seems talented enough. Most pillar men are so intelligent that they tend to refer to the latest human technology as mere toys. Then again, I'm sure if he actually tried to use something like a computer, he might find himself surprised!   Something tells me that we'd repair things together or hand the job to whichever one of us has the time to do it. I do come from a family that likes to tinker with things after all, so it's not like I'm totally helpless when it comes to things like plumbing or mechanics. There's nothing we wouldn't be able to fix, I don't think.    We love niceu fightos!    A manly sleepover? Sounds interesting. Then again, considering his series, I wouldn't be surprised if a sleepover he'd go to played out much the same way.  I want to have a private sleepover with my husbando and do each other's nails!     We never see his parents and he has no siblings. I do have some pictures that someone made of what his parents could possibly look like, however! Naturally, his father resembles him quite a lot.    A birthday party! Something tells me that he's never been thrown one, which makes me very sad.    Whenever we're both ready. There's a lot of things to consider when it comes to having sonfus, of course.                          Is your waifu self-conscious about the size of her breasts?  Do you like your waifu's VA? How popular is she?   Mai is very polite, which is something I think I share with her, at least to an extent.  Perhaps she would like an antique blade.  Some greater stability would be good.  No, she's pretty well endowed and doesn't seem to concern herself with her chest size. If anything, she makes her less endowed friends feel jealous.  I hadn't really paid attention to Saori Hayami before she started voicing Mai, but since then I have been paying attention to her roles. She's very popular and cam third in this VA poll: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/int<wbr>erest/2015-04-06/kana-hanazawa-hiro<wbr>shi-kamiya-lead-in-favorite-voice-a<wbr>ctor-poll/.86759</wbr></wbr></wbr>             Probably average levels of tech understanding for a Japanese high schooler, maybe a little less because she's clumsy   We're clumsy   Don't know but I hope so given she lives alone and is probably lonely.   Who doesn't?   She doesn't seem to resemble her brother and you never see her parents   A comb or hair clips for her beautiful hair   Financial and emotional stability should be a prerequisite for having children. Age and marital status are less important so long as the woman isn't too young or old to have children meaning anywhere outside 15-40 years old.   She's self conscious of her weight which is maybe related to the size of her breasts.                        How would you respond if you discovered that your waifu used to be a man?   Well, she piloted a Mecha once so she knows enough about technology. All in all she is pretty intelligent.   We're both kinda lazy and we both love pizza. I also like teasing my friends like she sometimes does.  I really would love to have a children with her but I don't think I would be a good parent.  She slept really long in Lelouchs room do you could count that as sleepover, but if it's a sleepover with her friends and stuff, they would probably eat fast-food, talk all night long and sleep till noon.          I'm sure we would really like to have children sooner, but we would wait until we got house with enough space for kids and until we would be financially stable. I want to be sure our kids will have good living conditions.   Probably. However I would remind her that her bust size is perfect for me and that it looks really cute and arousing with her petite body multiple times.   I don't care about her at all. She doesn't even sound like Miku.          Not really, but sometimes it is shown that she hides her breasts. I hope she gets more confident about her perfect chest.  She's the most popular seiyuu of this age, and she's named as "The Queen of Anison". Fuck yes, I like her. I admire her a lot.  I won't be that shocked, since she's manly anyway, she gets more bitches than I do.        <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113200  Fuck off, retard. No one cares if your feelings are genuine.  The correct term for loving multiple 2D girls is harem and there are dedicated threads for people like you. Waifu threads are meant only for people who are in love with only one girl so you will never be welcomed here. Leave this place and go to harem threads.     Not really, no. She helped out with water damage, at least.   Brown hair and eyes.   There was that OVA released a few days ago where she's at one with the other fairies, so it's not out of the question. They'd most likely drink and have food, maybe talk about the day.   Never say her parents.   That one BL doujin that'll most likely get burned if TPP passes today.   Until we are both ready for a child and at marriage. The 25 range seems most suitable.   Shocked at the fact that she was a man, then shocked that she might actually be gay.  I'd still keep her, though.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113200  Get out.  Does your waifu ever read any doujins? What kind, if she does, and what kind do you think she'd read if she didn't? Non-H works are acceptable answers.                           Unfortunately, yes. I want to alleviate her of her insecurity by reassuring her that they're gorgeous  or just repeatedly impregnating her until they're a few sizes larger .    She replaced the battery in my F 91-W  Hardly  I doubt it  The world may never know  A Nixie clock. Or maybe a snowglobe, snowglobes are cool  Maybe in the late 20's. Sounds like a much better age to start. Better to wait until one is finished with education and has a career  They're not badly sized, I doubt it.  Oh my, the voice. The VOICE. It might be the most sexy thing about her  My dong only expands further <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113200  In my particular case it's inevitable. For other waifus, absolutely haram                      That wouldn't change anything about her, so I don't see why one should focus on the past. I think that the reaction of Mai's friends when they discovered about her past (illustrated here) is a good one.  I'm pretty sure that Mai has never read any doujinshi, since most of the world's nuclear armaments were dropped on Japan and wiped that country off the face of the Earth close to a century before she was born. She's pretty innocent.and easily embarrassed though, so I imagine that she'd prefer to read light-hearted humorous non-H doujinshi.      She lives in Soul Society which is essentially feudal Japan, the only people using advanced technology belong to the Technological Development Department which she is not a part of. She has spent a lot of time on earth and knows about our technology I.E computers but I doubt she is well versed in utilizing them.  I'd say we're both bold and heavily supportive of our friends.  She sleeps in MC's closet whenever she comes to earth. She doesn't partake in any activities outside of the usual drawing and reading. I don't think she has actually ever had a traditional sleepover.  Don't we all?  She looks almost identical to her late sister and looks eerily similar to her adoptive brother despite no blood relation.  Something chappy related, probably a plush toy. Perhaps a brand new set of high quality drawing utensils, she loves to draw after all.  Not the largest fan of kids, but with her there is a possibility. I'd want to take proper responsibility and thus wait until we're both financially able to support a child as well be being both physically and mentally ready to support the child.  Her breast size is rather small, especially compared to other characters in the same series  not that I'm complaining of course  but she never mentions or even implies she is bothered by it at all. She doesn't care one bit, which is great.  Fumiko Orikasa is great, she's the perfect voice for Rukia. She's voice acted quite a few characters but she's mainly known for her role of Rukia.  Hey, friend.  Orihime a cute.   We talking magical transformation or post operation? I'm surprised to say the least.                                she's pretty good with technology, and can figure anything out if there's a manual to skim through   we're pretty similar, especially in terms of sleepiness and personality.    Most likely. They have a camping trip, in which she spends the entire time asleep - waking up when it's time for food.    Her Grandmother is her only living relative, and they look incredibly similar.    a book, or something cute.   probably never   not really, but she's certainly aware in the difference between her breast size and that of her well endowed friends.   Yep,the voice is perfect. She's not very well known though.   I don't think so.  you're waifu a cute, by the way  If money wasn't an option, where would you take you're waifu on holiday? What would you do?                            Don't derail the thread.  Ded tred. Are waifus finally obscure again?    Basic as fuck, watches idol videos on YouTube. Yes. Nope, she's dumb as fuck but is a natural leader (which I like).  She gave me sweets, different each time.    We are both hyperactive, klutz, disorganized usually, air-headed and one-track minded. Also very stubborn.   Yes. Practices, swims (if pools or at the beach), and eats for days; pillow fights are possible and tends to wander around while asleep.   More on her mother. Slight resemblance to her little sis.   Bread with strawberry jams. Varied imports.   Need a house or two so she can be at ease.   Not really.   Yes! Quite a bit, I suppose.                           Not in the near future.  Maybe once (if) she manages to syujinko it up.    She's not flat, and she never seems to have any trouble with them. With her recent Idol escapades, I'm sure she's pretty satisfied with her own body.    tfw different VAs for every game    Wouldn't really change much. The past is the past afterall.   Unfaithful manwhore.                I'm quite sure she's the type to use Doujinshi as "research material".    Until we're financially stable and emotionally ready.  But definitely not before Yunocchi had a chance to explore and further her artistic path!   Only a tiny bit, it doesn't come up all that often. Though she generally tends to be a little insecure.   She's pretty popular, mainly thanks to the role in which she voiced my wife. A good voice actress all around.            Oh shit   is meant to be<span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113200       My waifus   Her VA is in everything this season. It's great to hear her voice in so many roles.    I'm pretty sure she doesn't. She probably wouldn't watch any pornography at all.   Rented house near sea. We would go to beach a lot, explore nature around, watch sunsets etc.   Why would they? It's normal for a thread to be slow at this time of a day.         <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127115413  It doesn't matter. How would you feel if your waifu had another man? It's the same as NTR-ing your waifu.  Falling in love with multiple people comes off as never truly falling in love with a single one of them.  Harems a shit       Who made it law that someone can only "truly" fall in love with one person? Seems arbitrary to me.     law  Do you have reading comprehension issues?     6 pm isn't a slow time here    My point in saying that is that everybody acts as if it's law, when it's not. Love knows no man-made arbitrary rules. Who is anyone to deny you your love because THEY deem it unfit?    It's not about your feelings, dipshit, but about the girl's.   Enough about polygamy! Question time!  What couple activity would you like to do with your waifu? Yes, watching vietnamese pictographs count as a couple activity if you're doing it together.  We'd probably play vidyas together and she would probably rant about how the RNG hates her.        How retarded do you have to be to not understand what people are saying to you? <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113477  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127115002      People like that are just egotistical scum, they don't even stop for a second to thing about the girls' feelings. It's despicable.   I doubt she would, unless maybe for artistic references. She'd rather read the original work to begin with, though.     I'm not much for travelling, but for my Yunocchi's sake, we'd most likely to any location with a rich art history. If she's having fun, then I will be too!          I understand what they're saying. I just think they're wrong.   Why? Isn't having actual discussion more interesting than playing questionnaire?      Stop taking the bait.   She seems somewhat computer literate. Nothing spectacular, mind you, but nothing minor either.  We both have a thing for good music, plus we're pretty similar in terms of personality.  Quite often. She's pretty closely knit with her friends, though what exactly happens during these sleepovers is beyond me. As long as it doesn't involve leek sticks being stuck in awkward places...  Hard to answer. There's no info on her parents, and she isn't the type to talk about them.  The best platter of tuna sushi that I can prepare.  Definitely the latter. She still has a career to think about, and I don't want to do anything that might bring that to an end.  Wouldn't mind trying, though...   She can be, but only because of the attention they bring her... She might not be the biggest, but they are big enough to draw the eyes of the jealous and lecherous.  She's got a nice sultry voice. Can't say anything too bad about Yuu. Though a high point would be hearing her squee as Sakaki in a certain scene from Azumanga Daioh.  Well, nobody's perfect.  Highly doubtful. Then again, her mind can be particularly lewd when she wants.  A nice stroll through a park sounds nice. Just have to find a nice park in my area.  A nice sea cruise to the tropics. She's always loved being out on the water.                          Having a stroll while holding hands and talking together, cuddling under blanket in front of fireplace at winter evening, kissing while watching stars or sunset and much more.   Not in USA.       Don't tell me what to do.    Obligatory    she would download ALL the dolphin screensavers. those free toolbars also sound useful   most of the related group-trip is off camera, but its one of the few times shes shown interacting with just other girls aside from that her sister also stays with them so it's sort of like every night is a sleep over   her hair colour is similar in the second season but aside from that they don't look much like their younger sister and her parents are never shown.   my stance on it has flip flopped a lot back and forth but I think I'd really just have to ween her character into it I might start her off with a puppy so she gets used to having responsibility, I also like dogs myself so its not that big a deal if I end up taking care of it on my own or something  I'd love to have a daughter with her, just thinking about it makes my heart race a bit, but there is so much to think about before then.    no, she's incredibly non-self-conscious about just about anything   they're both great her jap isn't that popular, and also voiced one of the most hated characters on /a/, but her dub has a massive history of roles with some of the most popular dubs on /a/, notably bebop   given her abilities I suppose it's not exactly impossible, but it also would be by magic instead of snapping a dick off and making a flesh hole so I'm down.   she's read regular manga, so I'd think she'd have no issues reading non-h it'd be interesting walking in on her reading an h-doujin not hearing me come in with her face blushing  I'm not sure whether I'd sneak out so I don't get bludgeoned for spooking her or sneak in further and try to initiate by kissing her neck while shes concentrating    gardening seems nice, though I'd be a little afraid if she got too enthusiastic she might somehow acquire some sort of giant venus fly trap that keeps us at bay from the garden until it dies                                  Does your waifu know how to please a man?   Shinobu's pretty smart. She's one of the more talented biopsychologists in Academy City although not the best, and she's pretty proud of it. She's also confident with machines and computers.  I don't think she can help me with my psychology, my biology, maybe.   I don't believe she has sleepovers, since she previously used to live alone and didn't have any friends. She probably does with Janie and Febrie now though.   I couldn't say, since her relatives and such were never shown.   Spend time with her. She likes reassurance that she's doing good.    Probably would prefer to wait until we had a house. However, a lot of that stuff can be excuses, and she's shown that she's partial to kids so the answer would be 'as soon as possible'.   She never mentions anything like that, so she probably thinks that it's silly. Or maybe she does privately.   Hayama Ikumi? She's okay, not super popular. I haven't gone out of the way to check her roles out, and none of them that I've heard are anything like Shinobu.   I'd be surprised at how advanced science has come.   A relaxing resort or the like.   We could visit cafes often, does that count? OR take Janie and Febrie around to play and shit.   Boy, reading the word 'couple activities' used to make me mad.   Blogshit warning: I've recently been questioning myself a lot because 80 - 90% of my thoughts regarding her have been of wanting to do lewd stuff, which does betray a certain shallowness. I'm not quite sure how to overcome this, I probably need to give more thought to her personality.                                    Not at all.   Amusing ones.   That's a cute outfit.   Sex.             She's really good with Technology, she's always on her laptop and she's great with tinkering electronic devices  She made some headphones once as a gift, they are described as "revolutionary" which shows off her amazing skill     Quick, share one sexual fantasy you have with your waifu  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127117509  The waifufags are the worst.    We both love technology and music, i mostly like calm and relaxing environments and so does she, and we both like sharing random trivia   She has a really close friend but she moved away, i don't think she has any sleepovers   I'd give her a brand new laptop, hers must be pretty old That and a piece of jewelry, maybe a necklace           I want to  make love to her  in the  missionary position  while I  hold  her soft, warm  hands  and then  cuddle  afterwards    Fuck her cute butt.    Making love in formal wear comes to mind.   Alternatively omorashi      The fanbase considers her a queen in that regard.  In the shower or on a billiard table.      I wanna give her a slow pleasurable oral while she wraps her thighs around my head and i massage different parts of her   She's a Super Class A hacker   Ahh, but how is she when she doesn't surf?    But I thought she was incredible math    Rather not, but I would lead her to make us both feel good. Her pleasure would be more important to me though.   Romantic, passionate sex in lotus position while embracing tightly and looking into each other eyes, I guess.        Has your waifu made or repaired anything for you?   How can she? She's not real.      Chihiro prefers to read books on paper, but she's accepted the growing influence of the internet and its effects on people.   We're both huge nerds who love art   Book covers.  And books to put those covers on    Until we're in a stable life situation and after we're married.   No   Yes, but not that popular. It's good, since i don't have to think of her in other roles much.   It's Chihiro I care about, but this scenario is neither here or there since she's cis  love    Probably, she loves Shoujo manga so despite fandom claims I don't think she'd read yaoi.   We'd watch movies. Chihiro doesn't like reading together since she'd want to talk if we're around, so movies sound like they would work.  How would you greet her after you've had a long day of work? I'd give her a hug and kiss and if she weren't too busy I'd invite her to lay down and watch something with me.                              Thanks.   Sex with her on my lap  while interlocking our fingers    L-Lewd!          I'd wait until we both have a stable situation, a home and a good income   She doesn't seem to be too worried about it, she seems happy with herself as she is, which is great   I do, Mamiko Noto does a great job showing Fuuka as the gentle and caring person she is   I'd probably take her sightseeing, there's not much to do in port Island but I'm sure we could just walk around and make a picnic under a three or watch some movies   We'd go sightseeing and taking photographs, we could also watch some live music shows and concerts                That's too private to say!    But it's not like I hadn't mentioned face sitting and spanking her cute butt before.    A long and tight hug, then pick her up for a kiss, and carry her right to bed for some quality cuddling time.        I'm going to impregnate Nero! I love my emperor!   I think that New Zealand would be an interesting country to visit.  I used to do fencing. Maybe we could try that out and see what I remember, though she would trounce me quite effortlessly. (I did foil while her fighting style resembles the sabre but I don't think she'd have any problems adapting.)  She's a virgin and has never had a boyfriend, but I'll wager that she knows what she'd need to do for that.  A hug and kiss sounds like a good way to proceed.          I'd hug her and ask how her day went, serve her some tea, give her a massage to relieve her stress, and make sure she's satisfied and relaxed  Question What would be your waifu's ideal vacation?  (Fuuka seems the type of girl who'd love a nice landscape, i imagine taking her some place with lot's of wilderness)         If she's home when I am, I'd greet her with a warm hug and some tender words. Usually depends on how exhausting my day has been.   She seems fond of any place with nice scenery, though she seems especially lively near the ocean. It's part of the reason I'd like to take her on an ocean cruise one of these days.  I've only been on one, and I wouldn't mind giving that same experience to someone close to me.        The size, not really. She may feel bad that they aren't soft though.  Haven't really seen a lot of other stuff she's done, but I like what I've seen. Unsure how popular she is, but she doesn't seem to get many roles.  Not very surprised. She may look like and identify as a girl, but she has turned out to be rather flexible in that regard.  I would hope she wouldn't read them at all. Otherwise I may get really clumsy flirting or awful jokes thrown at me.  Actually, that sounds kinda nice .  I don't think she's ever been to the mountains. Let's go there.  So many things: Playing games. Cuddling. Going out holding hands. Take her to a fancy party and dance. Sparring. Go shopping.  Fighting evil back to back against impossible odds, and propose there and then. It's the most romantic setting of all.   You lost me.  Well, the most sexual thing we could possibly do would be  hugging .  Hello Chihiroman!  Say "I'm back", receive "Welcome back".  But that's not enough, gotta wrap an arm around her waist and pull her in for a kiss. Or nuzzle her neck with my nose, that's fine too.   She enjoys learning and seeing new things, so the best thing for her would be a trip around the world. 80 days might not be enough though.                                She at least knows how to use a computer but I doubt she's tech savvy. Well she could give herself the necessary skills to be.  Pretty opposite except for a love of things that are artistic.  Seen pics of her and Casko sleeping together so I guess that counts.  She does resemble her mother and if you buy into the theory that she and Arturia are related then of course they resemble each other.  Almost like clones or something.<br/>   I always have trouble thinking of something for this but maybe a party and a trip to the theater.  I don't really want any and she seems like she'd be too busy but if she wanted it then I would wait till things settled down.  Naw. She knows she looks great.  Sakura Tange is great and I would think she would be popular for voicing Sakura Kinomoto.  Not surprised. I guess that's how she really got away with being recorded as a man.  She hasn't been shown to but I can see her reading yuri ones. Also ones about herself.  Perhaps a trip to the most beautiful cities in Europe.  I'd like to work on an art piece with her and take part in one of her plays.  Man and/or woman, her technique is the best.  Steamy sex in the bath.   Looks like she's popular.                                 Almost our entire relationship is based upon things we have in common, it's what attracted me to her so much in the first place. We are lazy, daydreamers, prone to hoarding, dislike bureaucracy, love potatoes, enjoy inebriation, navigate life at our own slow and steady tempo, and a lot more to boot!  Talking, fun, teasing, drinking, playing and sleeping.  Her twin sister Ursula looks precisely the same as her, just with glasses.  I'll think about that next April.  As long as we need. I really want to, but realistically, we're still too lazy as of now.  Not usually. She looked a bit miffed in S2/E10 when Francesca groped Hanna but aside from that one time, she seems fine with her petite bust, even when surrounded by larger girls. In any case, I prefer slim girls. Built for speed!  I think Sakura Nogawa is somewhat underrated, although that could just be my own bias.  If money isn't an option, then we'll have to make do with camping in the forest nearby.  She pleases me regularly but I prefer to please her.  Ignore those who would attack that as blogshit, as they'll only be crying about the questions and lack of interaction later. Anyway, what you describe may not be shallowness as much as becoming carried away with lewdness, which is something that can happen to many of us (including me). At any rate, you seem to be able to answer the questions well.  Being handcuffed as she sits on my face while lovingly applying a pleasure/pain combo of oral and CBT! Well, you did ask...  Standard-issue hug and kiss, quickly wash my face and hands, followed by a makeout session on the couch/bed. This may lead to either cuddling, lewd, or both!  Anywhere with sun and good ice-cream, so she can just eat and relax in the shade.                            Changing waifus is degeneracy, right?    Same here     Not necessarily, it wholly depends on the specific circumstances.  But most excuses are scummy.      She is never seen using computers. I think she may need some assistance in using a computer.  We have a couple of things in common like fighting for our friends.  Yes she definitely does. She is the one who make cake and stuff to eat and she is the lewdest around them.  Oh yea Akeno looks exactly like her mother  I would give her lingerie  She would want me to get settled into a house then have our child  Biggest bust in the series she doesn't care  I love her VA. She is pretty popular http://myanimelist.net/people/93/It<wbr>ou_Shizuka  Why should that matter I dont think she would change if she was a he  She does not read doujins though she does watch   porn   on her free time  I would take her to   Go to the movies then go to my home and relax  If you mean massages and finger licking   SAndM with her which turns to passtionate sex to make children            </wbr>                   Vidya, naps, and the aforementioned pictographs.    kissu and cuddles, and a cup of tea.    somewhere quiet, like a nice forest lodge.          Chihiro's ideal vacation is sort of like Kyoto: Lots of stuff to see and a relaxing area. Distant, yet familiar at the same time.  The Fushimi shrine is also in Kyoto but that has not much to do with it and is likely coincidence    Hello, Aigisfriend! Chihibro is fine, really. I do wish there was a way I could get to know you more, I like getting to know my fellow Personafriends.        She's average at it, she knows how to use her computer/phone, she have no problems with these kind of things.  She made  me happy.    Minor personality traits, we love cute stuff, and both afraid of heights.   She had a few of them. They did a lot of stuff in them, played games, girls talk, she really enjoyed them.   I want to headpat the bassist.   Her parents are never shown, and she's the only kid of the family, so I have no answer to this question.   A new amp.  That's what she was thinking about what she would buy if she had extra money  But also a nice gateau au chocolat, flowers, and a few other things.   Until we have our own place, and a stable situation.   She is. Her best friend is also jealous of them at the beach.   I like her and she's kinda popular.   I would wonder what kind of technology was used, because there's not a single trace of her previous self, she can even be pregnant, that's amazing.   Never.   A tropical island, where we could be alone on the beach, relax, play in the water, sunbathe, and do lewd things. Or maybe a nice cabin in the Alps, mountains are lovely, I've always loved them  and the word Mountain is also in her name, that's a sign    Taking bass lessons with her as the teacher. Biking together. Cuddles.  I love her.                                                 she is better than that    J-Jellycatz? You are still alive?     She does use magitech a lot and doesn't need help with those computers, but she's not exactly an expert with that stuff.   We both care about justice.   I can see a resemblance to her mother, and she looks like Alicia for obvious reasons.   Not any specific age, just when we both fell like we're ready.   She seems fine with their size.   She's extremely popular, and I really like her. Can't wait for that Live Acoustic BD.   Someplace on a lake where we could spend time together.   Build Gunpla together.   A hug and kiss, and ask her how it went.                             If Yomiko reads a book on the subject I think she can master the computer     Something in common  Our love of literature    I imagine Nene sleeping over whenever she would come to do the cleaning    Her parents are never seen so I have no idea    A bunch of books or try to track down a signed edition of one of her favourite her novels    A couple years, that's if we really want too.    I think she's pretty oblivious to how big they are    Yomiko's VA has only voiced her    Probably not doujins but I imagine her reading good old lewd literature    Probably Paris for literary reasons     Reading together, going to bookshops and just buying what we can find, going to book festivals.    Making love to Yomiko against a book case in a library, trying to be as quiet as possible as we undress one another, next would be bending her over a table and doing doggy.     A hug then kiss and I'd tell her I would prepare some tea, maybe a shoulder rub or foot rub to go along with it.  What have you done for your waifu lately? I've bought about 16 or so books lately which I hope Yomiko would enjoy.                                                        I've been exercising and arranging my folders a lot i need to have it all nice and tidy    Apart from the an eager hug, a long relaxing dinner and getting shit about our respective days off our chest, if she wants.    Mentioned it earlier - nothing too stimulating, something chill like a cruise or resort. I'd like that too.   Thanks again.   I made a new reference pic for WWD, eh, and wrote some stuff. I 'went out' with her a few times. Saw a Railgun LN in the bookstore which made for a strange experience.  How do you guys feel 'close' to her - following a routine, doing stuff, looking at merch?               Rather than going to a single location a luxury cruise with just the two of us sounds pretty great.  Couple activity? Now I'm no romantic but things like; Video games, watching movies, cooking and just generally hanging out with her would be a lot of fun.  She knows how to please me. Thats enough.  Bondage sounds like something worth trying out. If only once.   Welcome home! Shall I run you a bath? Or perhaps you'd like something to eat? Or maybe...you want me?   My geography is bad, I can't name a single place. But Rukia really likes high places, so someplace with mountains, maybe cliffs.                <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127120893  It's a thing with squares that you eat for breakfast, but that's not important right now.   she is a gamer   I think Kagura knows the basics. She wouldn't accidentally download a load of viruses on a computer or anything like that.  She repaired  my soul.    We both like videogames and swimming.   Her parents have never been seen, so I can't say for certain.   I bought her a necklace for her birthday last year. Nothing too fancy, just something she can wear all the time. I haven't thought about what to do for this year.   We'd definitely need some financial stability;  there's no way I could afford having a child on a part time wage.  A house/apartment to ourselves with plenty of space would also be a good idea.   Not really,  she's pretty endowed as is.    Kuwashima's one of the best, in my opinion. She has great range and has done a lot of work since the mid-90's, and still going.   It wouldn't change a thing between the two of us.   I don't think she does, but if she did I could see her being into shounen/sports manga.                             absolutely none at all   Working on my outer appearance. Trying to look good for her.  Come next week, I'll be training to become an instructor.    Listening to her songs is usually the way to go when I'm home. Outdoors, I like to think that she's there by my side; it's a feeling that flares up even more when I come across merch of her. Mostly, though, I feel close to her during my training. Thinking of her gives me the drive to intensify my efforts and keep pushing forward.        Outdoors, I like to think that she's there by my side  amen to that     I stare at her photos all the time and i play Persona 3 a lot and speak with her in-game    Road trip across the coast of France and along southern Europe.   There's so much I could think of! Spending the day at the beach or a water park is pretty high up on my list though.   Wanting to do lewd things with your partner is a natural part of the relationship. As long as the two of you are fine with it, there shouldn't be any need to worry.   I want to  2lewd4u  her in the  censored.    Lift her up as we hug eachother, and give her a peck on the cheek.   She'd love to visit America sometime, but she's a little concerned about flying.   Depends on the circumstances.   I did a pretty intense workout with her the other day.  No, not that kind of workout.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127120893   A wonderful little pile of love!    Going out jogging, exercising, looking at pictures of her, and the daki.                               I think it would be her greeting me first. She would hug and kiss me. Then I would probably go rest somewhere with her so we could talk about our day and maybe plan how we will spend the rest of the day.   Any warm, nice place where we could spend lot's of time outside, I guess.   Nothing more than usual things, like listening to her songs, cuddling and talking to her in bed etc.    How do you guys feel 'close' to her  Well, the closest I feel to her is when I cuddle and talk to her daki while pretending its her, daydreaming while being high and fantasizing about having sex with her during masturbation.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127120893  The girl that made me feel thing I've never felt before.                 Hug, kiss, even more kissing.   I think she'd really enjoy just relaxing on the beach.   Trying to stay happy.   Wake up to her, think about her during the day, go to sleep looking at her and other things.             Fate a cute.    I'd like that as well.  Getting more pics. So many pages to go.  Her fig stands to the side of the monitor, always watching. That's as close as it can be, I think. <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127120893  Love in its purest, undistilled form. Not for the faint of heart.           Keep up a steady work rate. No real days off with internship and job but I'm working harder for her!   Kissing her daily.   I'm looking forward to it! Just where could we talk, though?          Thank you, she is.    No, not really. I don't think she's ever shown anything like that.   Yui Horie has a really cute and wonderful voice. I'd imagine she's pretty popular.   Severely creeped out and feel very odd at first, but if she's 100% girl now by whatever reasons, I don't think I'd have really much to say. If she's 100% the same as she is now even after, then it's just a short awkward while of strange.   Some cute doujins I'd imagine, robot fanworks,  Erotic Butler BL doujins perhaps    Anime, videogames, questing and work. A lot more things, too.   Severely doubt it.    1boy 1girl cum cum_on_body cum_on_breasts cum_on_clothes cum_on_hair cum_on_lower_body cum_on_upper_body cumdrip facial cum_in_mouth cum_in_pussy lingerie sex happy_sex missionary_position doggystyle cowgirl reverse_cowgirl thighhighs                       Super lewd all night    I'd give her some hugs and kisses, then I'd just sit down in the couch or chair and laze around for a while.   Not much, apart from trying to lose some weight, at least ease into something.   Daki.                               I love Ai so so much!    I don't know, but if she doesn't, teaching her how to use computers and maybe even program sounds really fun.   A quiet, but fierce determination when it comes to doing things, whether it be academic or recreational. I have to admit though, that she is better at actually getting started than I am.    She is pretty popular, but I don't really pay attention to her. I thought it was funny that she had to have a conversation with herself while working on Cross Ange on more than one occasion.    Money is no object  Space. I'd love to see the stars with her, but up close, which is something I could only manage if I had near unlimited resources. That or Cancun.   Help her improve her swim times, learn something together such as a dance, language or other skill. I'd like to do some unorthodox things that might be fun too like urban exploration. Really, I'd love to do quite a few things with her.    This sums it up quite nicely: http://pastebin.com/Z5v70Z19l    I'd hug her from behind and stay like that for a while, then I'd kiss her and tell her I love her.    I don't do it intentionally like "Oh I need to think about Ai today", but every so often I'll get this really bubbly feeling of being in love and do something as an outlet for that: drawing, writing, listen to romantic songs, some of them sad, and they remind me of her.  Especially the songs it's something I find myself doing a lot lately. Man, if I close my eyes and lip sync while pretending I'm singing to her, I feel like my chest is going to burst from emotion and I feel like crying    OHHH MYY LOVEEEE, MY DARLIIING                                 this pastebin has been deleted  Fuck you too Pastebin. Good thing I saved it. Giving it another shot:  http://pastebin.com/CamHEYG7      Yeah, good thing you saved it.    We don't share many traits but we're a good match and complement each other.   He does. Judging by some official pictures, a lot of plush animals, cute pajamas and sweets are involved. I'm sure they have a lot of fun together.   I want to kiss Makoto on the nape.   He looks like a perfect mix of his parents.   Pets, tickets for amusement parks/zoos/aquariums and my love.   I'd honestly let Makoto decide. I trust him to be reasonable enough and he loves children so I want him to be happy.   Not only the chest but his whole body actually. Makoto popped a shirt button off his shirt because he's so well endowed and got really embarrassed about it, it was so adorable.   His VA does an incredible job with Makoto's sweet, gentle and warm voice, I love it. I think his VA is semi popular but I'm not that knowledgeable about seiyuu.   I wouldn't care. I love Makoto the way he is now.   Makoto wouldn't read lewd stuff so light-hearted non-H works only if anything.   Travel to various places around the world.   We'd pet cats, play vidya, cuddle and eat sweets together.   No, Makoto is purer than fresh snow.  I'll teach him though.    Let him sit on my face and please him orally in various places.   Hug and a kiss on the foreahead, cheek and mouth in this order while caressing his back.   Makoto would love beautiful landscapes and impressive places so I'd do a tour around the world with him.   Look at pictures, imagine various scenarios to please him and hug my Makoto pillow. Post a picture of your waifu when she was young.                                                     Pretty competent with machines. Her phone above all things is pretty advanced considering it's a phablet and bluetooth at the same time.  You can say she fixed my heart, if that counts.  Even if it upsets people on a personal level, we will do what is right.  Doesn't care.  Satomi isn't that popular. That said, she was definitely a contributor in getting me to really notice what I had been missing in my life. She truly brought Kuroko to life in the adaptations, and I respect her greatly.  I would not be surprised.  Lewd thinking is pretty natural when it's for the one you love. Thanks, brain.  The merch search is never over.   how  Exactly what you said, and daki in the morning, or when I go to sleep.                     She's pretty well inclined. She never had one of her own, due to growing up in an orphanage, but she's interested. She hasn't repaired anything for me, no.  Several things, actually. We're both shy, have problems with self esteem and self worth, and both have a stutter. My problems aren't nearly as bad as hers.  She spends a lot of time with her friend Lilly, but no mention of a sleepover.  We don't see her parents, seeing as how they died when she was young.  Something small and heartfelt. She never liked her birthday much, but I'd use the day to tell her how much she really means to me and how much I love her.  A little while. I don't think we would rush into it, but we wouldn't wait too long.  No, she's much more self-conscious about other things.  She doesn't have one.  If she isn't anymore, I don't see the problem. I fell in love with her as she is now, and I wouldn't stop loving her.  Unknown. She loves reading books, though.  Somewhere quiet and peaceful. I think a trip into nature somewhere would be lovely.  Watch movies, play vidya, cuddle.  Give her a big hug and kiss, and tell her how much I missed her.  Someplace where your troubles could just melt away, and you could be on your own.  I think about her every day, and always keep her close to my heart.                                Wasn't there an IRC or a Steam group? I'm unsure.    We can make an IRC channel for just us if you wanna talk one-on-one.    Does your waifu have a blood sister?  Can she defeat gojira?      They never died: they just faded away.     How technologically inclined is your waifu?   Not much.  Does she need help using computers?  Maybe a little but she is the type who can learn fast.   Is she a leading pioneer in her field?   No way.  Yes, we share similar traits in personality, other than that not much.  Yes, in an ideal world she does. They play games like old maid, watch TV, eat snacks, tea and keki, talk about their lives, have pillow fights, etc.  I wish I knew, I soppused it's the same as Yuno. Her warmt comes from her parents.  To be happy.   wait until you get financially stable and had house  Pretty much that.  Yes, she knows she's perfect and I love her.  I don't really care much about her. But she's pretty popular.  Panic!  Something happy and cute, like Life of Maid.  Italy, go everywhere. I want to go there and I'm pretty sure she would also love it.  I would do my hobbies together with her and we'd travel a lot.   Fendom, all the way.    Hello, honey. How was your day?  Kiss, hug and massage. Easy.  Italy. Ari ari---  Bought figures of her.  Merch.                                           Miku would be the closest thing to one, though the fanbase feels that they are closer than blood sisters.   And suddenly I remember a song from the second Project Diva game where your chosen character can grow kaiju size and fight a Gojira expy. She could probably handle the King of the Monsters quite fine, though I doubt her chances against the likes of Destroyah.       There's still an IRC channel.     She'll do better than jet jaguar. How would she handle Orga?      A bit bulky, but nothing to worry about; especially if she has momentum on her side. Should be interesting to see her take on Biollante, though; I mean, all those vines...       i posted it in the spook zone for you two live bards    theres  a few            She lives in a medieval fantasy world, so she doesn't know anything about modern technology  she used to have problems i also used to have and both of us have a bad temperament  nope  yes, her sister also has pink hair, and they mention that maybe she is going to look more like her sister when she grows up  i really don't know what would be a good gift,she can have everything she wants because she is from a noble family,maybe i would invite her to a very special place on a date    she is 16 and im 18 having a child wouldn't be a good idea right now i think we would wait a few years , at least until she is 21   yes  i don't know how popular rie is but i like her  if the money isn't a problem i would take her to a private island where we could have fun together  i would love to travel alnd explore the world with her, also watching movies and cuddling would be nice  giving her a huge hug every day and a kiss  somewhere were we could be toghether without having to deal with anyone else, just a nice place for the 2 of us                           Bulky in all the right places, am I right?     She can use pretty much anything than the average japanese girl can use.  We both are responsible and mature.  She had some sleepovers with her friends.  Not possible to know.  Sweets and musical stuff.  Wait untill she's prepared for children.  She knows what she has.  I do like her a lot and she's popular enough to remember her name.  No.  A different city where I have family. We can live in their house and only spend the necessary money.  The usual I guess, hug and kiss. I'm not very imaginative for these things.  A trip around Europe or a second trip to Britain I guess. Maybe going to a big music festival.  Not much, I like to rewatch especific scenes from her series.  Daydreaming and listening to her songs.                              Thanks mister.   We can go to that one.   But it will have to wait a bit, I must go out. Will be back in 3 hours or so.          Amen to that.     She doesn't really use technology a lot. She's not really mechanical either.   Aside from introversion and  deep love , not too much now that I think about it.   Aside from sharing the occasional hotel room, no.   She resembles her mother a lot, especially with the eyes. They share some personality traits too, but her mother is far more imposing and generally kind of intimidating.   I buy her flowers every year.   Having children is important to her, and while deep down I love the idea, I'm also terrified by it. I'm so scared of being a bad father, not being able to handle the responsibility and not being able to provide to my family. I think it's one of my deepest fears.   She's confident in them and likes them as they are.   Kugimiya Rie does a lot of tsundere roles. I like her voice (especially character songs), but I typically don't like the characters she's associated with.   That's no longer here and now.   No, but she'd probably like  vanilla .   A winter vacation to the Swiss countryside.   Just spending quiet time together in a secluded place, a special place for only us.   I just want to make her happy...  Maybe kiss her shoulders or tummy...    I walk home from work, so I'm usually quite sweaty and gross when I get home. I'd greet my darling, but I'd have to shower before I could give her a hug proper.   I bought the last volume of her manga.   :&lt;    I keep her keychain on my backpack, listen to her character albums,  hold her figure's hand  before I go to bed, and sleep with a homemade plushie of her.                                                  Yeah, a ton. The most obvious thing is that we both play the drums.   Sometimes. Pretty normal stuff.   I think she does resemble her brother, but I'm not sure if she really does or if it's just because of the art style and confirmation bias.   Very long. We'd both want to pursue our musical careers for the time being, and having to compromise between that and spending time with your children isn't the best thing ever.   Somewhat, but it doesn't seem to be a major problem for her.   Yes, no idea how popular she is.   I'd let her choose if she really wanted to go somewhere. I don't really like traveling all that much myself.   Play board games, play vidya, play music, drink tea, watch anime.   She's not very experienced.   Depends on the day, obviously I wouldn't want to do the same thing over and over again.                              I love my  scary  light cruiser!   The one-on-one or the one mentioned in ghost?   Do you have any merch of you're waifu? If there isn't any, what kind of stuff would you like?   I thanked her. Pic related.   I think I just feel very close to her pretty much automatically.   I have a bootleg daki. I'd like to have tons of stuff, but I'm not actually planning on buying anything for the time being.          I doubt my husbando has even one tech-savvy bone in his body. That's okay though, I'm always willing to help.    A lot, (un)surprisingly. We both have trust issues. Social anxiety. A perception of not being worth other people's time. So on and so forth. The biggest difference there is that he's affected by these things much more than I am.   Nope. Probably just watch movies, chit-chat? I don't think he'd care for the typical teenage girly-girl sleepover stuff.    I want to kiss my husbando's wrists.   There's no mistaking him for his mother, but they aren't completely dissimilar either.    A cake and some new clothes. And something sweet and sentimental, of course. Like a custom-framed photo of us together, that'd be nice.    A birthday party! Something tells me that he's never been thrown one, which makes me very sad.  Sadly, I could most likely say the same for Crona. But hey, a first-ever birthday party is a good gift in and of itself.    Only about how skinny he is. An understandable concern, even if I think he's just fine already.   Maaya is pretty good, and she's got a sizable list of roles too.    "Kay, cool. Now where were we?" Let me go ahead and re-state once again that I don't see his ambiguous gender as an issue. If he was something other than what he is now, that's fine too.   Ha, no. But the thought of him getting curious and consulting Google one day, only to get extremely flustered at the results, is rather cute.                                   I have her figure  which I got at 300% its original price.  It's a good figure but I wish it was less popular.       She doesn't have any. I'd just like a figure, honestly.   I just realized this picture would've been perfect for my last post. Technological inclination, and all. Hindsight is always 20/20, right?   Anything! As long as we're enjoying each other's company, it'll do. But if I have to choose, cuddling on the couch and watching tv sounds most appealing at the moment.    The answer depends on whether or not  he's ever touched himself  ;^)    Holding hands  and  locking eyes  and  kissing  while  making sweet, tender, love.   Also, seconding the anon who mentioned omo. God, I have so many fantasies related to that. I'm so gross ;_;    I'd give him a big hug, a peck on the cheek, and ask him how his day's been. /My/ day doesn't matter too much when I can come home to his smiling, lightly blushing face!   I don't think he's the vacationing type, though admittedly that may just be me projecting a little. But if anything, he'd like somewhere quiet and lesser-populated.   I've been trying to get back into drawing him, if it counts. Writing a bit too. Just the usual stuff, I guess.   Looking at pictures and rewatching his scenes, mostly. Sometimes I get random cutesy ideas in my head, and they give me that nice feeling of closeness too.   Just the  cards . I'd really like something more substantial, more tangible. A prize fig, keychain strap, anything.                           Nothing special these days, planning a fourth rewatch of her series.   Listening to her songs, watching pictures of her, constant daydreaming, posting in these threads...   Still alive, Spaniard ?   I don't have any merch of her yet. I know that love isn't measured by the amount of stuff you have, but I still feel bad for owning nothing.             My waifu is the sexiest.   My waifu is the prettiest!    The only thing I have right now is a little nendo petit. I would love a larger figure whether it's a full nendo or something with more realistic proportions, but I'm also hoping for little trinkets like keychains. Other girls in her series have gotten them, so I'm hoping it's only a matter of time.    Not really, at least nothing conscious. Most of these things come naturally.   While there's quite a bit, a large percentage of that is cheap stuff like clear files, stickers and such, which aren't really worth getting in my eyes. As for the rest, it's safe to say that I own most of the quality stuff there is.  Although I'd love to see a proper non-prize scale figurine, or at least one where my Yunocchi isn't in a swimsuit or her school uniform.    Nothing out of the ordinary. Just normal couple stuffs.   My waifu is the cutest!              I want my waifu to pole dance and strip for me.   Something I forgot to mention in my last post, I did a colour edit of some art I have of her. Looks a lot more accurate than the original.   Two scale figures, three plushies, four mini figures and a poster.  Also two keychains and another mini figure on the way as I speak.   Would you're waifu rather do a dangerous job for a lot of money, or a very safe job for little pay?          three plushies  Massively jelly.      Still alive, Spaniard ?  More or less     They are pretty darn adorable.    A couple of figures, two posters. Mousepad and a mousemat. Still a ton of merchandise I'm looking to acquire, though.    I think she's fairly competent when it comes to technology. I guess her field would be Ratings Games if I had to pick one out specifically, and she isn't at the forefront of that unfortunately. Maybe in the future though.  Has your waifu repaired anything for you?   My heart.    An interest in reading and the supernatural is something we both share.   When she was younger I think she used to sleep together with her best friend. Not sure what they did together though.   Incredibly so. She gets the majority of her looks from her mother but with her father's crimson hair. She and her mother look so alike they could be mistaken for sisters.   Financially stable at the very least. It's difficult for Devils to conceive so unless we were incredibly lucky on the first try it'd take a while for it to happen no matter what.   Nope. She's perfectly happy with the body she has and is proud of it.   Yoko Hikasa is very talented and I'd say pretty popular. I like her, she does good work.   If she read any I think they'd be non-H comedy stuff of series she liked. She's not really the type to read doujins though.   If money was of no concern, traveling the entire world and experiencing all the sights and things each place has to offer.   It's a bit private but  planning out our anniversary, which is tomorrow. Mostly involving baked goods, roses, and just being as close to her as I possibly can. I wish I could do more.                                  Can do.  His dress/robe from back then reminds me of a flower of some sort. Can't put my finger on which one though.    He did a dangerous 'job' for what I imagine was a very pitiful allowance. That 'job', of course, was his life under Medusa (not to mention other hazardous situations he's found himself in  for free ), but I digress. All things considered, I'm almost inclined to say either is equally likely.       I wish my waifu had a plushie.    A small collection. Two plushes, a nendoroid, a couple of keychains, two games, and an artbook. Always eager to add more.  Definitely the latter. Not to say that she isn't capable of handling the former.      To think I did most of this damage before even considering going to Japan is still cool to me, and I have stuff on the way, too.  http://myfigurecollection.net/profi<wbr>le/BDKBMW</wbr>   Why this has never come up in my mind is beyond me.  I would imagine dangerous for money, as Judgments field work has proven to be more dangerous than Antiskills.   second spoiler   Happy early anniversary!            She doesn't have much in the way of merchandise; I guess by thinking of her and looking at pictures of her.  I have a phone strap of her. It's the only merchandise of her in existence. I wish that she had a figurine.  Depends on the nature of the job I suppose. She's willing to put her life on the line for a good cause (e.g. protecting others), so she would be willing to do a dangerous job if it helped others.        Yes, pic related. Also I have Project Diva f 2nd and I've preorded http://www.goodsmile.info/en/produc<wbr>t/4878/Hatsune+Miku+V3.html   Safe job. She rather wouldn't like to risk to much.   You can commission one or just make it yourself. I think I've seen some waifufag who had commissioned plushie.      </wbr>    W-What happened ?    All these people with all this cool merch  Damn I'm so jealous    I'd get a lot of stuff if it was available Figures, posters, stickers   She wouldn't care about the pay, she'd do something she likes, although i doubt a Kirijo job is badly paid         Hey, friend. Orihime a cute.  Thanks, Rukia a cute too.     I have her figure, and I have the Mk2 daki, and two of the anime one(peach skin and 2way tricot). I've commissioned a daki, though I want other merch of her. I think there's an extremely rare garage kit, some small figure, a 1:1 scale doll I think(custom), and a JP LE nendoroid that's rare too.    I have two figures, a PVC keychain, both of her character albums, both of her  oppai  mousepads, a wallscroll, and the aforementioned homemade plush, as well as her games, manga localizations and series on DVD.   She'd probably do the safe job if she wasn't terribly motivated.       Sneak up behind her while she's distracted and surprise her before giving her a hug and kiss.   A bit of all three, but hugging her daki close and squeezing it tight feels so nice and right.   She was a cute kid.   A daki, the one well-made (in my opinion) figure she has, and a pre-ordered 3D cushion. I'd love to buy more merch of her but every other figure has left me disappointed. Considering getting a second daki of her in the meantime, after buying her mouse pad.   Would depend on who she's working for. I think she'd prefer a safe job with smaller pay over something too dangerous.   Thanks, Kurokobro! I hope your anniversary, whenever it is this year (or next, if its already passed) is wonderful.                   almost forgot all about the thread today  Jesus.  She spends a lot of time on her computer, whether it's playing eroge, chatting with her friends online, or just browsing the web in general. She doesn't need any help using it, as far as I know.  Has your waifu made or repaired anything for you?   She repaired my hateful heart!   We're both into mahou shoujo anime and cute things in general.  We also both have natural, medium-brown hair that's dyed to a lighter color.  She's never shown having a sleepover with her friends, but they're almost a necessity for a teenage girl with friends. With her main friend group, she'd probably do normal teenage girl things like reading magazines, watching movies, and styling each other's hair. A sleepover with her otaku friends would probably be a lot of video games and anime discussion.  I'd say something Meruru related but she has nearly all the merchandise for it. I'd probably get her something really nice that she'd enjoy like some jewelry, or just new clothing in general.  Mmm, a few years. We would have to adopt a child, which as far as I know, takes a lot of planning and whatnot. It's not exactly something we could just leap right into, and I'd also want both of us to be a bit older before we got a child.  She has a small, but not flat bust. She seems to be pretty content with it.  I love Ayachi and her voicework, I think her voice suits Kirino perfectly. She's fairly popular and has a good amount of roles   She reads Meruru doujinshi and some other imouto themed stuff. The ones I know she reads are H-doujins, but I'm sure she reads some non-h stories as well.  We'd hit the town together! I'd love to go out shopping with her, and try on clothing together while giving each other fashion advice. After that, we could stop at a cafe and enjoy coffee and sweets together.                             Who needs help using computers these days ? Unless your waifu is a granny of course. Not that there's anything wrong with that.    Anywhere in the Demon realm or someplace in Kyoto   Yes I do I have a poster, figure, The psvita game that I still need to download, artbook, oppai mousepad and 2 dakis   She has done dangerous jobs before so I guess she would continue   Hey look its Rias             My waifu is older than your granny's granny's granny.    My waifu is never shown using a computer, and I sort of think she'd have trouble with it. She's more hands on.   Does you're waifu poop, anons?   Somewhere tropical, but it cannot be too loud or noisy either. With enough money maybe we could go to one of those really beautiful island resorts in the middle of the pacific. Somewhere the two of us can enjoy the beauty of water and nature in peace.   Not a lot, because it's mostly sold out, but I'm glad I've been able to get what little I have.   I can't imagine Ai doing really dangerous stuff. She favors stability in her life.           Share a Coke with Anon   Share a Coke with Ai   CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUTE       That's cute as fuck, Aibro.      Hnnngggggg     Thanks guys. Took me an hour in line to get those.      Don't know how I missed this question. Whoops.  I like to think she's stayed over at one of her friends' houses a few times, most likely Chiyo's, but it's never shown canonically. She did have that trip to Chiyo's summer home with her friends if that counts.   There are waifus whose series is set before computers were invented. Would be kinda cute to see waifus struggling to even turn a computer on.        Very safe one for a little pay.   I was just talking about how much stress I have had lately. Let's just stop talking about things not related to the thread.      I love my lovely lady.  She's my everything.      Getting stepped on by my lovely Kiririn! while she teases me for enjoying it so much!   Hug and a kiss and then ask her if she wanted me to make her tea or an iced coffee or something while I work on dinner.  I can't say I'm all that great with place names, but I imagine she'd like going somewhere with loads of shops filled with fashionable clothing.   Just my usual browsing for new fanart of her, and I pre-ordered a figure that'll be coming out in a couple months.  Waking up every morning to an alarm of her voice, daydreaming and staring at my figures of her, listening to her character songs and rewatching my favorite episodes of the anime.  I have a pretty good amount of merch, although there's still things I want to buy. I'd love to get my hands on her azone (the tsuntsun face one, which is a bit harder to find,) and make a custom dollfie of her. My dream figure of her hugging her daki seems to be being made, although I'm not sure if it's been cancelled or not, seeing as how a year or so has gone by without any information on it.  Safe job. She likes having money to spend on her hobbies, but I can't see her taking on a job that could possibly be life-threatening.  Tell me about your waifu's life as a child. Did they have a nice, enjoyable childhood?What were they like as a kid? Has their personality changed a lot over the years?                      Za warldo tokio tomare    Well thank you, it always is, though January is quite far in both directions.  Jelly of these cans. Very cool, still.     She can use technology whenever she has use for it.   I own many figures of her and there are some in the way and preordered.  Good question, I can't answer it.     Even when times aren't great, I'll continue trying to better know myself and become a better version of myself. Thank you for giving me that strength.  I love you more than anything.    I love my sweet miko so much! I want to marry her!  All your waifus are cute, me and Reimu both wish you all much love and happy lives!   She does a dangerous job... for little pay.        Eating out and strolls through the park are obvious ones. Maybe cooking together and eating the meal at the end, that's a lot of fun.   She's a Japanese high schooler so probably every once in a while but I wouldn't know for sure.   Her childhood was tragic. Abusive parents that she was rescued from by her brother only to have him die and become a Hollow.  If you went to the movies this weekend with your waifu what movie would you watch? I'd probably watch Jurassic World            Universal Pictures please go.    Her parents weren't good with her, they were strict and they didn't even report when she was missing for 10 days straight I can't imagine how hard her childhood was     You're waifu a best!  Me too, but I Nagisa were with us, we would watch Inside Out.       Does your waifu resemble her parents or other relatives?  Only when she's angry and heck I'm late. I still want to ruffle her hair.   What would you give your waifu for her birthday?  Lemon flavored cake.   How long would you wait to have children with your waifu? Would you do it right now, wait until you get financially stable and had house or maybe wait for both of you reach particular age?  Marriage and financially stable.   Nope.             not liking Jurassic World      small local theatre which only shows 3 things   jurassic world   some generic kids shit   the new ted movie   she'd probably want to see jurassic world based on the poster but I know the ted 2 is going to be funnier  I'm not sure she'd get most of the jokes though so I guess dinosaurs it is   ...yes there is a scene that involves that  and she's probably the only one in this thread who is confirmed for it which is the only reason I'm answering that.                Nothing's really known about her home life at all, sadly. It seems as though she's happy with her parents and her life in general leading up to when she meets up with the rest of the AzuDai characters.   I could see her picking either Jurassic World or Mad Max, I'd be happy seeing either with her.        Funny thing. I did just that this past weekend. Saw  Jaws       Definitely seems to have had a nice childhood with parents who encouraged her love of literature quite a lot.    We'd probably find an independent cinema and watch something foreign or artistic    That describes Yomiko's job perfectly, it pays incredibly well and she gets to travel a lot, along with access to rare and lost books which she enjoys a lot but the job itself is dangerous. Though if she enjoys it a lot I wouldn't want to discourage her from the thing she loves.  Is your waifu well traveled? One of the perks of Yomiko's job is that she gets to go all over the world which is a very cool thing.              http://exhentai.org/g/826867/2f00fb<wbr>702d/  Thread soundtrack: https://soundcloud.com/4chan-guitar<wbr>-whore/fascination-1</wbr>  </wbr>  http://exhentai.org/g/821432/74fa1c<wbr>f76d/ http://exhentai.org/g/816674/a24cb1<wbr>d9c1/ http://exhentai.org/g/801279/820911<wbr>5718/ http://exhentai.org/g/573592/5d154a<wbr>1bd7/</wbr> </wbr> </wbr> </wbr>   Daily reminder: ビッチ= Bitch and not Slut.

Bitch should be slut unless you want to go for TL notes and it's not worth it unless it's in the title or something.

Bitch should be slut unless you want to go for TL notes and it's not worth it unless it's in the title or something.   Taking translating as something absolute in all cases is stupid.

Have this in exchange: http://exhentai.org/g/465854/5c5d08<wbr>2a8f/</wbr>      http://exhentai.org/g/827116/ae8ace<wbr>b970/   you will never know what it's like to have your nipples and clit played with all day until they become permanently swollen   </wbr>   Just have 2 questions for you.  How many people browse your site weekly? Do you have enough donations to buy stuff, translate it and repeat the process?       He's pretty benevolent anyway. Translates things into Gaijin for us     And what happened with the other 2?  didn't have enough doujins.       not buying    For the sake of transparency, I'll answer your questions.   How many people browse your site weekly?  I get 1000+ on a release week.   Do you have enough donations to buy stuff, translate it and repeat the process?  No. Last time I bought the raw I need to translate, it was from my own pocket. I did that because I like the artist, and it's a KoF doujin no one bothered to buy.  I can't even reach 100 Euros after all these years. Labor of love, I tell you.                Fine anything good?   Fuck the shemale shit find some nice traps/becoming a trap things please      http://exhentai.org/g/826974/793db0<wbr>23a5 Hope you guys liked it. </wbr>   It was amazing. How does it feel knowing you indirectly made me orgasm?      Kriz, any ETA on the last chapter of You've Got Female?    Done translating. When the tank gets released, it's go time.   Come on PSYN, where the hell is this? http://exhentai.org/g/812049/f3a077<wbr>58c0/</wbr>   How do I check how much GP I've accumulated on this site?

Thanks though, I found it whenever I click download from the g.e-hentai site it shows me my current amounts. I had been downloading from exhentai exclusively which doesn't say.

Not seeing the difference between g.e-hentai and exhentai prices?  If the gallery isn't fjorded, you should download it in G.E- instead of Ex. Even if you have a million GP, being frugal goes a long way.     what are the credits used for in e hentai?  i'm level 12 and have 14K credits, i have no idea what any of this means, i just use the site for hentai you can't find on normal sites.      That was changed a few months back. Prices are the same now.    Wow, you're actually right.    A text based game that people use for money that give them privileges or some shit, fuck man even I don't play the game but I know that shit. Like level 6 with 10 hath and 6k credits just from logging in to fap everyday.     it can be used for money? can someone PLEASE explain how?       Wow figure it out yourself, fucking look at the website. Why did I bother explaining it to you.     These threads have been filled with /v/irgins.     Google doesn't give source   can't use exsauce because it's a .jpg  Gimme a hint, man. Cripples are the best.      http://exhentai.org/s/61c4ab3dfb/27<wbr>0787-8  Just cleaned one page, can't read moon so dunno what the story is about, second chapter is futa.  </wbr>   For the fellow breasts bros who appreciate them.  List with several artist who do mostly big/huge breast stuff.  http://pastebin.com/QXyLzJgj       Thanks. It was by Sasahara Yuuki? No wonder the artstyle looked familiar.      tfw poor  I've been expending a lot on bounties recently though    Is the dump over?   Only if you don't look beyond the direct translation. The Japanese understanding of "bitch" has a lascivious connotation while in English it's just the female equivalent of "asshole".     Oh those are nice...    Is there much hentai as good as this one?  only one I've actually enjoyed    http://exhentai.org/g/813558/c1df5c<wbr>ce8c/ http://exhentai.org/g/790386/022b17<wbr>9da0/  Help, I can't stop cumming  </wbr> </wbr>    Gay tbh      tbh  Get the fuck out.      Rude tbh     oops    tbh, gtfo.   I swear Makio has a huge hard-on for small transparent bubbles.   There's barely a few teams translating the はぁ/ハァ anyway.    And I'm one of those  autistic people.    Anyone know a place there's a translated this?  http://nhentai.net/g/24650/    TPP just passed. Say hello to the new netflix style fees of sadpanda   i think      No, Fast-track authority passed congress. Don't comment on shit you obviously don't understand.    Well not fully passed senate, just cloture so far, but pretty much guaranteed that the TPA bill passes before the break.   Is there a translation for chapter 3-5 for Suki ni Nattara Icchokusen? I've been scouring the depths but can't seem to find anything past chapter two, or even any groups currently translating it.   No    No, you will have to wait for Fakku to release it, if they ever do. For improved chances they will do so, buy the Gunma tank they are already selling.   Is there a website (in english or japanese) that lists(/try to list) all existing h-manga and doujinshi with the possibility to search multiple fetish tags besides doujinshi.org?  Didn't think there'll ever be a Yuri Kuma doujinshi and it's futa too. That's just what I need.  http://exhentai.org/g/827065/c729ab<wbr>0f34/</wbr>     There's hope, Fakku teased it a few weeks ago. I recommend buying the first gunma book they did too    If you took commission you'd def make more than that. Comes with the cost of not always translating what you want and when though.     I recommend buying   buying      Some of us want to support this stuff. It's fine if you don't but don't criticize those that do, that's just stupid.    Is this your first time in these threads or are you just trying to stir up shit on purpose?   There is way too much rough sex for me. I want something that has lots of kissing, hand holding and 'I love you's before they start having sex.  Is there a tag for lovey dovey sex?     I wonder how little money the artist receive, 30%?    Just search for vanill- oh wait.    Yes. It's called: vanilla      luh-lee   Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta. She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita.        30% is actually a rather high amount, if you knew anything about publishing.    30% is actually a lot considering everything with print costs, publisher cut, etc. That's well above what an author normally gets om the states      buy   I recommend buying  Please don't do this. By now, people are well aware of what Fakku is selling.  Even if you're simply pointing it out with no other ulterior motives like /a/ loves to assume people have, people should be free to decide whether or not they want to buy it on their own. It also sounds really stupid for people to recommend that you buy a product you may or may not actually want in the hopes that it leads to something you actually want getting released further down the line.  There are other ways to support artists too, of course. Also, it's traditionally been uncommon for /a/ to support localized releases of things, or even buy anime/porn at all, which is one of the reasons the average poster here wouldn't be a huge fan of that.            I wanna show my credit amounts as well.       buy a product you may or may not actually want in the hopes that it leads to something you actually want getting released further down the line.   Reminds me people saying you should buy the DVDs to things in the unlikely outcome it makes them want to release a BD.      http://exhentai.org/g/826649/89e2e8<wbr>ba81/  This the typical female doujinshi artist's work  Why are women so insane /a/    </wbr>    people should be free to decide whether or not they want to buy it on their own.    implying posts force people to buy stuff and deprive them of their freedom of choice    It also sounds really stupid for people to recommend that you buy a product     implying it's stupid to encourage a publisher to publish more of a specific artist's works     Also, it's traditionally been uncommon    appealing to tradition  Conservative reactionary much?   That's entirely different.                 Well you read my post completely wrong, I recommend buying the first book because I think it's a good book. You're looking for an alternative motive when there is none.     Now I know you're definitely just trying to stir up shit.     As long as they don't try grabbing more licenses. Can't stand their lofty goals of wanting to grab everything when they can hardly release a book a month. Just imagine how much wani content that will never see the light of day because of fakku.    You do realize they will be releasing two magazines a month to start with as well, right?  Also, the translators don't care much. They will continue to do as they do. Simply avoiding what Fakku is specifically doing.      Only when compared to how much you want to maintain the status quo, yeah.    All these uploads from Futaket    That was the least stir shitty up post possible. You should stop.    Translators do what commissioners want. And as someone who's commissioned some translations from time to time I've definitely stepped away from wani works whereas I wouldn't have in the past.     There's 31 issues of X-EROS out now. Forgetting all other releases, if they were to try catching up on that alone that by doing 3 releases every 2 months, their workload would probably double from current.  Then there's Shitsurakuten, Kairakuten, Kairakuten BEAST, Kairakuten XTC, Hana-man, and others. That's a fuckload of material they'll never release for the next decade unless they decide to put in 70 hour work weeks and hire like another 50 people.       Not all translators work on commission. That's probably a good idea if it's something you know that Fakku is planning on doing.  Otherwise, it's simply you being afraid.      I know you want to change the groupthink of these threads into accepting fakku, jacob. It's not going to be as easy as it was on /h/ buddy.    Good, focus on other things.     Otherwise, it's simply you being afraid.   Afraid of it being taken down from panda and translator blogs because it definitely will? Then sure I guess.      Do you really have to use such a strawman argument?   Yes, because they are ALL-POWERFUL, right? Keep your paranoia in check.        What kind of faggot are you? Are you only commissioning things for the epeen?     Yes. Because it means they already can't offer everything they licensed without the need to wait for years, but you know they want to license from other other companies because Jacob's intoned as much.    Does anyone know any good doujinshi that have girls with hairy butt holes?   I only know one but it's one of my favourites.  http://exhentai.org/g/291685/82199f<wbr>fcda/</wbr>        Keep your paranoia in check.   What is there to be paranoid about? They have been getting blogs and galleries on panda taken down as much as they want. There is no "paranoia"... this is something that HAS been happening.     What other reason is there?          It's funny how you assume that simply because they have license that people won't do any of the stuff they won't ever do.    The blogs that are down are because the owners voluntarily closed them. Same for the galleries. Same for Fakku.    Your argument is stupid. At no point did anyone ask them to release the entire wani back catalog of 50+ years of books and magazines. And jacob never said they would. The fact that they licensed the entire wani catalog AFTER wani forced everyone to remove their content does not mean they are going to release the entire wani catalog. That would be impossible. You're stupid.    [HorribleSubs] Ore Monogatari!! - 12 [720p].mkv   slut  Suna! Call the police! Takeo was violated!  Is it hamsterbanana time?  You should use spoilers for NSFW content.   No you shouldn't. That's explicitly against the rules.    Yes you should. That's explicitly follows the rules.      Spoilered pornography or other "not safe for work" content is NOT allowed on the work safe boards.       I like how Suna was scared when Takeo came in his room asking for a favour. You could really hear it in his voice.  so did everyone drop this?   Yamato was too much of a slut.    Nope it's just there are more people with shit taste watching shows like hibike   Oh baby its time  I haven't seen the episode but allow me to get   kyaaaaaaa   kyaaaaaaaaaa   SUKIDA   for 20 minutes   no plot or characters in sight   Suna sighs because he hates being here          Takeo's dad would be a handsome man if it weren't for his all black eyes. He looks frightening.   Incoming doujin were he cucks his son    Anon please. Takedad wants his women with some meat on her bones. Also I'm sure his wife could beat the shit out of him if he tried    the people on /a/ are way too mature for shows like this    No but most people are going to let it finish then marathon it. It's a good show but it just kinda drags at some parts   Suna is really giving me more and more gay vibes.   mfw this season    You marathon romcoms or else they aren't as good    I'm watching but I rarely drop by on the threads.    with the others, waiting to marathon it   Yamato's mannerisms were so damn cute this episode   I wish I could marathon it, but I can't help but watch it now. It's too damn good      Man I really like this anime. In most romances it is some normal, nice guy, with above average grades dating a pure girl who would never imagine doing sexual things.  In Ore Monogatari, though, the protagonist is not some decent student but a really tough jock who gets all the women to like him. He doesn't go for nice girls but prefers to fuck sluts who want to hold hands with him and do things to him when he sleeps.     When is the new girl going to appear and NTR that slut Yamada    implying they won't both cuck their son for Yamato     Holy quads batman      No <br/>    So Tekeomom wishes some grandsons?   MFW All doujins featuring Tekeo dad NTRing his son.    No even practicing on Suna?     Suna-kun, I have to practice getting a blowjob!    Why the fuck is the handsome as fuck dad with someone like her?    Love is stupid that or she is really good in the sack ugly girls give the best head    Chapter 14 translation when?   She started off as a young, petite, pretty thing like Yamato.  Then she gave birth to a human mountain. That does things to the body. Things that aren't always pleasant.     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGi<wbr>yDw3dOSs  Boruto  - Rasengan and Rasenshuriken - Chidori and other lightning based jutsu - Multi Shadow Clone - Snake Summoning - Snake based Jutsu like the shed skin - Toad Summoning - Sage Mode  Sarada  - Sharingan - Mangekyou Sharingan techniques like Susanoo and Amaterasu - Super Strength - Great Medical skills - Chakra Chains - Healing Bite  Which of the two will be better?                     </wbr>   I dunno, but Sarada should definitely beat up that whiny faggot.    HAHA THIS FAGGOT. TRY HAVING AN SAUCE AS YOUR DAD AND CUCKURA AS YOUR MOM    So, its all quiet on the spoiler front?    tfw Mitsuki took a bite of gum-gum    Why do you all believe that Boruto can use Chidori? It makes much more sense that the is using Rasengan with Raiton.    Orochimaru does that stretching thing all the time why does no one make luffy jokes about him.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127119800     but [Sarada/Himawari/Naruto/Hinata/Shik<wbr>adai] should definitely beat up that whiny faggot.</wbr>     No wonder no one replied to that. Naruto is not in the title and there isn't a naruto picture.    Because he only stretch his neck and puke himself all the time    0:28  Konohamaru confirmed being Sarada-Mitsuki-Boruto sensei      Because in the trailer when lightning appears around his hand the typical sound of chidori is heard.  There are many raiton jutsus and none sound like chidori, so that's why it seems boruto will have both the rasengan and the chidori.      Don't forget the Uzumaki chains in case she turns out to be Karin's daughter.    And you can tell which one of these two threads the mods will delete.    How does Naruto's kid get snake shit and chidori?    Doesn't really look like either. He doesn't have a chakra ball in his hand and the lightning is all around him rather than lighting up his arm/hand. Maybe he threw a lightning rasengan ball?    Sasuke trained him.     - Chakra Chains   - Healing Bite  Karen is not her mother.       Snake Summoning   Snake based Jutsu like the shed skin  Ain't fucking happening. He may be a cheeky shithead, but he is not snake-user tier edgy. When she grows up Sarada could pull a neat snake lady act with that summoning contract, though.        It most likely his own technic - a combination of Sasuke's and Naruto's favorite moves.    Yes she is did you even read Gaiden?     Snake Summoning   Snake based Jutsu like the shed skin   Toad Summoning    Sage Mode   Super Strength   Great Medical skills   Chakra Chains   Healing Bite  I didn't see any of that shit in there            It looks nothing like a rasengan.    Does he not know that his father is an orphan?    I can't figure out why his eyes seem strange to me    That's dark history He's a sweet summer child     His eyes a lighter blue than Naruto's, probably due to Hyuuga genes.    Doesn't he know that his teammate grew up 12 years without her dad or that Shikadai is in the exact same situation as him?    It should easily be Salad Because she's Tsunade with Sharingan  It will be Burrito Because he dripped out his dad's penis.        Quote's wrong. He actually says:  "This parent shouldn't have been there from the beginning!"   He'd be a real class-A shithead if he threw Hinata under the bus like that. Threw her like he did his sister's cake.       It's the same color as Naruto's. They just look weird because of the actual decent animation.    Shikadai's mom isn't a doormat    asspull retarded explanation for misunderstanding is incoming     she a Tsunade  That didn't help Sakura much what make having a low level sharingan any different?     Because pic related sounds just like a Chidori and we see him add the Rasengan part later on in the movie.   I'm not sure if he throws it though. Could just be an animation thing.      Not like that bit of history pertains to him in any way. Telling someone that their parent was an orphan doesn't help at all. Trying to get a child to pity their parent is one of the worst things you can do.    She should definitely yell at him more. It's arousing.   And it looks like Himawari grew up, so the cake scene was likely a flashback.      I don't think it will be Rasenshuriken, if he learns lightning jutsus. He's more likely to make his own variant of Rasengan using lightning chakra. Something like Rasenbolt, which might be some sort of ball lightning.   fuck off   She is too much of a loser nerd.     She probably spanks the fuck out of him whenever he gives her lip, which is quite frequently if he's anything like his father.    <br/>   Okay, how about we talk about your waifu from SoL #39567?   But who is Mitsuki?  Everyone is giving Sarada MS, but how can she awaken it? She needs someone to die in front of her so she experiences deep trauma.    She needs someone to die in front of her so she experiences deep trauma  I nominate Bolt.     You wish.    It needs to be someone she CARES about.    Why does boruto got nothing of his mother ?  Shikadai=Temari eyes Chouchou=Karui skin Inoscrarecrow=Ino hair Himawari= Hinata hair Sarada=   Karin glasses            Fuck no, Cuckura should be the sacrifice    We're talking about each character at peak potential and the description reads that Salad would at least get Mangekyou Sharingan. That shit is hardly low level.  Also Peak Sakura still never surpassed Peak Tsunade unless she got significantly stronger between the war and plopping out a kid.       yfw Sarada turns out to be the first ever Uchiha to unlock her MS without maximum suffering and edge     One of her mothers... Or Sasuke after he's done training Boruto.   Don't like the setup. Seems like Kishimoto just wanted to mix the best of the best into one character. Especially dat kids attitude. Would be better off if that kid got tourette's syndrome and could use no jutsus at all.     Big bouncy tattas susanoo    BAKA DORITO!   How can this guy be so fucking whiny? Naruto is ALWAYS AROUND   oh no, it's a shadow clone thats playing hide and seek with me, MY LIFE IS SO TERRIBLE   Literally what the fuck Kishimoto probably doesn't even realize how entitled he's making Bort and actually thinks his problems are legitimate          Hinata is a shit tier Hyuuga whos genes are so shit she can't even pass down her goddamn Byakugan.  Master Eugenicist my ass. He should've gave Hanabi to Naruto.       you were slow this time   Holy shit apparently Sasuke went back to his "mission" after the Gaiden. So Sarada is father-less again till he returns to become Boruto's master.    asspull retarded explanation for misunderstanding is incoming  And missing out on the opportunity of giving Salad an easy powerup? Not a chance.      He should've gave Hanabi to Naruto.   Noone can handle that semen demon People have premature ejaculations the moment they'd look on her in bed       It's clear that Naruto "dies" so Boruto can learn what losing his dad actually is.     Peak Sakura still never surpassed Peak Tsunade  was said during the war that her Baykugo seal is stronger than Tsunade's       It's Kishi projecting his own fears onto his characters again. He worries that his kids might resent him for being a busy ass mangaka.   Really it's just teenage angst. And it all gets resolved in the end anyway so there's no need to worry.      Pretty sure it was just as strong.    Boruto and Himawari are the only known descendants of the Hyūga clan who do not possess the Byakugan. However, according to Masashi Kishimoto, he intended to give them the Byakugan, but forgot to before releasing chapter 700.  http://www.cinemacafe.net/article/2<wbr>014/12/06/27884.html</wbr>      More like he did not give a fuck seeing as he was joking that entire interview.    i swear you whiny faggots acts like you never said shit like that to your parents    He didn't intend. That would go against making Boruto Naruto and Sasuke's lovechild   So 13 years have passed and Sasuke still doesn't have a new arm.   Boruto movie coming out before the anime even gets to Madara vs Guy    That makes sense. It's not like his mission finished just because he got screentime again.     THE RIDE NEVER ENDS  How does it feel, knowing that you'll be still watching Naruto when you're 80.         he was joking that entire interview   pretty much this. the movies take about 2 years to make from first concept to release, so he has plenty of time to work shit into the manga to do whatever the fuck he likes, like asspull a byakugan brother for Sot6P which tipped his hand about NH ending being (even more) likely.  burrito/salad designs and their powers were probably pretty solid ca. chapter 650 in mid 2014.          I think most of us have a few times. Usually we got put in our place though. Naruto and Hinata are too lenient as parents and no one dares touch a kid spawned by ninja jesus.  It's the only way he knows how to repent.      She a girl, once she hit her first anything could cause her that much suffering  There are like 3-5 gaiden left  At least it still has anime unlike bleach  So whoe is going to REALLY end first? Naruto or OP           Naruto. Oda doesn't have a stop button.    so the antagonists all are byakugan aliums, some who have rinnegan handeyes as well?     Usually we got put in our place though.  hat makes you think bolt won't?  the whole movie is about him being put in his place        So 13 years have passed and Sasuke still doesn't have a new arm.  He doesn't need one. When you are as powerful as he is it no longer affects his daily life. It's his non-dominant arm anyway.      Oda doesn't have a stop button.   implying oda won't literally work himself to death despite (WJS Mandated) On Break Next Week.       It's his non-dominant arm anyway.  sauce was left handed before 698.     Making Hinata mama sad  This kid is shit.     He's ambidextrous.     We all know Oda's "breaks" are just him pumping out the next chapter and getting ahead for when the cassette runs out so they can continue the adventure for that little bit longer.     It's his non-dominant arm anyway.  They both lost their dominant arms, it's symbolism or something     I bet Himawari immediately forgave him cheerfully  then went to her room, burst into treats and cried silently into her pillow/favorite stuffed animal     adult Naruto still has the same voice    He doesn't die, he's this movie's "kidnapped princess", so Sasuke, the 4 other kage and Boruto set out to rescue him.    Bort having ANY of Naruto's moves doesn't make sense.  Even if he's a born genius with the best of both gene pools he's just a regular kid from a peacetime era.  Naruto's entire skill set came from the secret scroll he stole from the ninja FBI, and he was the only one of his generation able to pull off the techniques because he had absurd jinchuuriki battery life.   Rasengan lite is the only high tier technique Bort should have any chance at whatsoever, and that's only because Kishi gave it to Konobodyhamaru on a baseless whim.         so Sasuke, the 4 other kage and Boruto set out to rescue him   Salad doesn't get to come along on their interdimensional rescue mission    Bort gets to make up with his dad and brag to everyone in school the next day about how he killed an alien god       Is that a grill?    No, just a faggot.    tfw the other four Kage are so useless that they get outclassed by a 12 year old who hasn't even finished the Chuunin Exams       Just like dragonball characters. Blame nips.    fuck this edgelord     her favorite stuffed animal is a fox     It's albino Gaara   When can we expect competent subtitles for Naruto: The Last to come out?   B-but he has no Hitler stache.    why is the anime taking so long?    SP and their filler fetish. Their fight is slated to start on July 2nd.    July 22 the DVD/Blu-Ray comes out     Snake clan doing anything for Sauce after he barbecued Manda  Narnians don't HAVE to help nins out, right? Didn't Sasuke even contract with a bird once?     delicious salad booty  Even SP knows    He probably said he was sorry     implying anyone can ever stay mad at the Sauce   He is going on an interdimensional roadtrip with 4 people that were first hand witnesses to his kage summit chimpout.      inojin continues to be best girl      Ino's abomination doesn't look half bad there.     filename  kek  captcha is cake  kek again       Waait a sec.Right center pic.Do those two fuse?     If it wasn't for Chouchou the new InoShikaChou would be the perfect trap squad.     That cake looked delicious, too. Goddammit Bort.    Looks like a standard cake to me bro. It wasn't even that fancy.    Sauce looking dapper as fuck in the top right.    so who is mini-lee supposed to look like? those eyes look a bit unusual. wasn't he supposed to be a few years younger than bort, salad, and inoshakcho 2.0? he has the same radio earpiece as inojin and both are fighting grass nin, so I assume this is chunin exam second portion stuff.      After killing Manda, he still summoned a snake that obeyed him when him, Naruto and Sakura all summoned their creatures while fighting the ten tails.     top right  isn't this a children's movie     His retarded vest looks significantly less retarded if he looks like he has two arms.    He might be 10/10's kid like people thought. Or he might just be some faggot Lee found on the side of the road and shoved into a tacky green leotard.    You could easily salvage half of that cake.    Lee wasn't Guy's kid either, so maybe he's just some random loner    Gaara looks like a faggot with his new hairstyle.    It landed on the plate. most of that shit is salvageable.     Or he might just be some faggot Lee found on the side of the road and shoved into a tacky green leotard.  Most likely option. There are plenty of orphans and there is no mother of the child complaining about the training being too hard on the kid.     God, why does gaara have to look so gay. I mean, he probably is mad gay, but still     so who is mini-lee supposed to look like   Not Ten Ten.  Amd probably not even Lee.        he has the guy/lee eyebrows, but not the lower eyelash thing.  the solid black irises and overall eye shape don't match 10/10 either.  probably just an abducted child.        At least Temari knew she had to tie up that shit    That sounds terrible. I get that hes supposed to be a prodigy or some shit, but if hes anywhere near sasuke or naruto's level thats just retarded as hell. Or is supposed to somehow be both transmigrants at once or have ten tails chakra or some shit like that?    tenten became a wizard, let it go     probably just an abducted child.  kek The eyebrows most likely come with the outfit      Is Boruto being voiced by a woman?    He might pull it off with two arms, but why doesn't he cut the useless sleeve?   Who is Sarada's VA?   Just in case he needs to whip out a roboarm    Hasn't the anime taught you a lesson after all this time?     happy birthday to the ground     or just wear a long coat like back when he was edge surpreme?    A newbie seiyuu.  She voiced toddler Boruto in The Last.      Wait why didn't he get a new arm like Nurudu?    Why couldnt lee have a female clone? Fucking bodysuits are made for girls!   <br/>    dat Salad      the solid black irises and overall eye shape don't match 10/10 either.   both guy and lee had the solid black iris thing going on, but Lee's were larger with his gaping round eyes.  could be lee's kid, but thematically would make more sense to just be a student, but then again, why would lee have been training him in 700 as a presumably pre-genin?   solution: there are actually multiple mini-lees running around konoha now, all taken as war orphans from the aftermath of NWW4.           An old hag.    Sasuke and Chouji were the only ones that lucked out with those.   It'll all be worth it for the new Kana-boon song.   They had to downgrade the Sauce      Maybe hes "hiding" it like a trump card. Could even be an arm full of sharingans!    Anyone else notice Salad looks significantly less cute in the movie?    Everyone looks worse in SP art.    How long until Salad just hates her dad's guts.    From what you hear in the trailer it sounds bretty gud.     Anyone else notice Salad looks significantly less cute in the movie  No?       I dont know whats more retarded a) The fact that there are more Rinnegans b) The fact that Naruto, Ninja Jesus, who moves at the speed of light and can throw ki blasts that destroy entire mountain ranges while being the buddy of all 9 bijuu, is supposed to get kidnapped  I really cant wrap my head around that.       Are you implying she was a carpet muncher? She has never shown interested in vag, only Shikamaru's then underage cock.     Because we haven't seen shots of her emoting yet, though I'm glad there's finally some promotional art that shows her smiling rather than pulling the Sasuke face.       No scan of the characters we actually haven't seen.   Jesus Christ.      I wonder if she'll pop an extra tomoe or two when she sees Bort wearing her hopes and dreams like freshly skinned animals.     Himawari dresses in a bright yellow hoodie  Adorable. And she looks older, too. About as old as Bort did in chapter 700.     It looks like nips really love Salad    It's a Kamehameha wave    I'm just happy (and actually surprised) to see Himawari getting prominent placement on the promo material.  Also, the fact the Sakura survives the Gaiden intact is news to me. I could almost see Kishi killing her off at this point.       It's the path of redemption    Don't expect much, she didn't even get a shot in the long trailer while Tenten and Shino did.    birthday cake of sadness has 6 candles. assuming burrito is about 12 in the movie, they were probably about 3-4 and 9-10 in 700.      that upper left panel  Is he fucking posing with his clones while trying to wrangle a panda out of someone's garden?      Burrito after the move   I think I want to be Hokage.       just kidding!     Maybe it's just a flashback, there is still hope     I guess that means I'll have to fight you for the title, huh?   How about we start with some light Rasendoris before moving onto the heavier stuff?      dunno, but I guess we're supposed to infer that burrito is in like 99th percentile for chakra reserves even if he doesn't have an kurama juice in him, since most genin couldn't even do a single shadow clone without collapsing    Genetics, anon. Genetics. Also Uzumakis were known for having absurd amounts of chakra compared to normal people. Also he's got a wee bit of Kurama juice inside of him thanks to the whiskers, and even a tiny amount of that stuff probably fucktouples his chakra pool.    Inojin and Rock Lee's Kid would be one hell of a duo    Deception is one of ninja's weapons. Enemies, who don't know it, might think twice before attacking, if they think he has two arms.    Inojin looks alot less ugly animated.     dat filename      needing an arm when you have the supreme eye hax    So I'm more than a little confused by the trailer. In one part it looks like Burrito is winding up for a typical Chidori, and then the next second it looks like he just threw a fucking lightning bolt.  And then later on we see him doing a li'l babby Rasengan with two hands. Obviously Kishi wouldn't spoil what his special attack truly was, but I bet it's a mixture of the two. His not-Chidori and his Rasengan.     why do you care about me?   because youre my son ;)  We all know that this is what Sasuke will say      Sakura kept his left arm for the lonely nights so she can poke herself      Daddy issues intensify     He was supposed to wear more baggy clothes, wore a kind of Hyuuga symbol when he was younger and his face is more soft and round, like Hinata's rather than Naruto's. Small details like that are the first to go though. Compare the original sketches of the characters for The Last era and what actually ended up in the movie. Big difference. Then there is also the Byakugan that Kishi supposedly forgot, and the originally lavender eyes he had that later became blue.      chidori and rasengan lite are both the half-ass variants of a nature-infused shape manipulated chakra attack.  that said, rasengan makes sense with wind since the spiral ball storm goes hand in hand with the cutting nature of wind. another form or shape manipulation might suit the piercing nature of lightning chakra better.       I'd be hard pressed to say never. But that's because I have a single mother and she's honestly been pretty chill my whole life.     I worry about my children rebelling due to being a mangaka and having no time for them   finally I managed to finish that massive series that prevented me from spending time with my kids and made me worry about them rebelling   time to make a spinoff series where I express my worries by having the former MC's kid rebel instead of spending time with my own spawn        yfw they pull out some "Oh he just had to awaken the byakugan or He's just been hiding it with a jutsu or contacts or something.     WHERE ARE THE EVIL SPOILERS ??!!!    To be fair in the war they got outclassed by a 16 year old genin too. Standards clearly have been dropping in the time of peace.     Originally Kakashi made the Chidori because he was too stupid to add lightning chakra to his Rasengan.  Maybe this weird pseudo-Chidori is Bort's way around that?  One of the biggest problems with Nurudu's fighting style is how repetitive it got after a while. Nigga only had like 3 moves. It'll be nice to see something new introduced and not get completely overused. Seeing the development process of those techniques is what made them interesting in the first place.        From his interview with Oda, To me it seems like Mangaka have a habit of becoming addicted to their work to the point where they feel very uncomfortable when they're NOT making a comic. Like they just can't bring themselves to chill for a while.    That explains the God of Manga Tezuka.     all this power creep and copy-paste powers  How can anyone like naruto? It's shit.     Is he seriously going to use fucking Shadow Clones? Way to go, Kishi.     He already did it in the Gaiden  He's a prodigy, unlike his father.       I think it's not fair nor funny of you to joke about the death of evil's uncle like that.     Doesn't look like he does them en masse like his dad though.    looks like they're making him special by just being another generic jonin-in-a-genin's body kind of prodigy.    shadow clone or two    rasengan    competent taijutsu and thrown weapon skills   byakugan's just too hard to make interesting combat scenes around, since it completely negates the "look at me surprise you with this attack" thing and is only good for really contrived setups.         I hope Sasuke gets to use his overpowered Rinnengan powers and shit, I've been starved from that shit since Madara jobbed like.. a jobber...   I bet is just going to Chidori and petty shit like that though..      Everyone uses shadow clones, anon. The difference is whether you make 5 of them or 50.    He's a prodigy   learned a variant of Chidori at the age of 12   also learned how to Rasengan without clones at the same time   smashed that shit together and help killed alien Master Blaster  Keikaku fucking doori.           why does it look like gaara?     He already did it in the Gaiden  Naruto used clones to play tag with Bolt, but not much more happened than that. I was referring to Bolt making the finger cross sign thing Nardo always did when using clones. Best case scenario, it's only to add the lightning element to his Rasengan.      evil not posting spoilers either means the chapter is boring, she's busy or she wants people to think it's boring but it's actually a huge bomb    I thought Boruto's clothes were supposed to be a reference to his dad's greatest hero     Not the same anon, but since I don't lurk those forums I had no idea.  I apologize anyway.       Chidori, Amaterasu and Susanoo. Might use his bait-and-switch eyes to get out of a jam or something. Basically shit we've already seen a hundred times with the MS that doesn't require the stupid fucking Rinnegan.   Nigga won't even make a sick robot arm to replace the one he lost in a gay bar fight.      Jashin?     Naruto used clones to play tag with Bolt, but not much more happened than that.   I was referring to Bolt making the finger cross sign thing Nardo always did when using clones   1/2       Actually Minato also wore similar shit. CG's jacket in that pic definitely looks closer to Bort's though.    I was joking anon, get that dick out of your ass, if that was real we would talk about it here more often     yfw she unlock MS through maximum happiness     2/2  He can already use clones, and did it against Naruto when playing tag.      Well, the comparison was never fair. We have known for ages that Naruto was cockblocked by Kuruma when he was a child.     surrounded by bishies while Bolt watches     I dunno, he looks exactly the same as he did in 700.   Maybe SP took some liberties with Bort's design for the movie to make him look more like a child of two people.       Sarada unlocks MS on her wedding day right as she says "I do."     yeah that was revealed by kakashi tree walking and Jiraiya water walking/ frog summoning.    Clone tag looks like fun.    Exactly. Now you can see what kind of shit those genes can do with proper training and without the tsundere demon fox being a dick.     armpits   ZR   Salad is such a semen demon       Her mom dresses her like a slut.    Holy shit I just noticed the intensity of that ZR. Fuck man, they know exactly what they're doing.    Holy shit Bort does have the byakugan    "Remember Salad. Get them staring at your body and in the distraction use your gorilla strength to punch them in the face."    "I cannot write any better than this" in a trailer    He's not exactly wrong. Let's hope the movie is good and Kishi can finally hang up his hat for good.   Wishful thinking, I know.      That's pretty smart. The enemy will never know the itch is actually Amaterasu burning his crotch.    His name can't be Boruto, I thought it's a new meme.    What the shit, Chouchou's not even in this movie?    Na-Ru-To Bo-Ru-To also Yellow Flash Bolt  Thematically it fits, but it sounds awkward in English.          Then you obviously haven't read any naruto since 699.    Boruto is the loanword for Bolt. It's Engrish, basically.   Just like Sarada sounding like Salad.      Doesn't even have a listed VA. No one wants to play a fat nigger.    She probably will, she is apart of InoShikaChou and was on the movie poster.    Himawari is taking up her spot.    and Madara is Maldla    Bolt   Salad   Mitsuki   Konohamaru  I'm okay with this. I even kinda want to see a little more with them all since I already know Konohamaru ain't going to do shit in this movie.       No, Madara would be Madala.    Mandela?    She is, I'm guessing she isn't in the trailer because she's already had more screentime than even Boruto himself in the gaiden.    Then Sarada is Sadala    Since Konohamaru is their teacher does it mean Sarada has a chance to learn Rasengan?    Who do you think taught it to Burrito?    Are you dyslexic, anon?    Like how sasuke learned chidori from kakashi? POTTERY     Then Sadala is Sarad and Madala is Marad    No.    Bitch better get them I want my loli Scorpion goddammit.     dad grew up as an orphan   teammate didn't meet her dad until she was 12   sensei had a hokage relative    He says this:          That's a mistranslation though.    Then Naruto is Nalt and Sasuke is Sazque    that fistbump  It's nice to see that they makeup.    I know what they were going for but just the way it looked it was like "Look guys, I'm sorry, this is the best I can do. Just bare with me."   Why?   Oh good. Best girl made it into the film.     Weeding is a disaster due to everybody looking at her eyes except Sasuke and Naruto   Meanwhile at after life   Madara:Now, this is an Uchiha wedding.       Hinata probably sees a bit of Neji in his anger.     that ending   Duuuude He gonna do rasenshuriken with lightning kek. Prbably also has wind inbued into it       So that alien with the hands is actually a woman? Everyone thought it was a he and Kaguya's husband.    I'm holding on to your words as gospel, anonfriend    Shit, man. I'd be scared to get a bj from a girl that comes from a clan of Fire spitters.    Sometimes when you're raising a kid, they act up, and you're like "What am I supposed to do with this thing?"    Boruto's life is set. High social status, money, and god tier genes.  What the FUCK is his problem? I don't get his shtick, he's a whiny fucking baby. At least his sister is alright, even if Hinata is a shit tier choice for a wife.   The only alright kids are Shikumaru's son, the Orochimaru spawn, and Ino's kid.        Nigga it shows the ball literally one second before that    He's being voiced by Hisoka.     Life is literally GOAT   still complains  Welcome to the Western world aka First World Problems     Do you think Salad will inherit her   Foster   mother's Inner voice? I'm a bit scared to see what combining Uchiha genes raised by the most aggressive woman in existance could do.   Sasuke will find a way to ruin her wedding, like only showing up to be Boruto's best man    No it doesn't retard.    She probably recognizes dissatisfaction at one's father in Boruto. She's sad because she felt it too and doesn't know how to heal the hurt.    Same reason /a/ complains about everything all the damn time.   nnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyyyyyyeeeesssssssss<wbr></wbr>    even if Hinata is a shit tier choice for a wife  Who would you have preferred, anon-kun?      Hinata shit tier  Now why you gotta be serious for half your post then drop the ball right there?     Look at 4chan and tumblr always complaining about everything.    The way it arcs off his hand makes it seem like he threw a lightning bolt or something. Li'l niggas Zeus.    He's a whiny faggot?    Generational pendulum. The same reason why you see so many SJW now.       FUCK YOU FOR THINKING OF THIS    <br/>    That's just a vanilla Rasengan, anon. He can do both apparently.    I'm hoping it will. Inner Sarada will be the only way to activate MS      he has the best father ever who used to spoil him rotten and misses him   Hinata is a shit tier choice for a wife  ah you just have shit opinions, carry on        Those are two entirely different scenes. Boruto is wearing a black jacket when he does that lightning and in that screen he's in an orange.     four arms   four tits      If that's what you think of yourself then yes.   So how does /a/ think the movie will turn out?   Yeah which makes it probably the fusion of both, or a new technique on its and not just a plain chidori. There is no reason for him to use chidori as the main weapon above rasengan when rasengan has always been the better one. Also he doesnt have sharingan or god ninja body yet to use chidori correctly     fingers herself with the arm every night   heals it when it starts rotting      Closeup on Madara smiling because everyone was caught in the inifinite tsukoyomi all along. Isnt it obvious?     why would lee have been training him in 700 as a presumably pre-genin?  Lee probably found him when he was young. Not to mention Guy met Lee before he was even a genin also.  dem parallels        Theres way more things to make fun about like his new Ara~ Ara~ self   what if sasuke gets gravely injured and ends up giving his eyes to bolt instead of sarada. bolt becomes kakashi with god tier genes with EMS and rinnegan while sarada get stuck with nothing   Just to expand on it. I bet sasuke told him he can''t learn sage chara stuff fast enough to use rasenhuriken in the examns and then taught him how to imbue it with lightning which probably makes it safer than the needle things fuuton does    Salad, stop telling us about your nightmares.    I doubt a non uchiha has enough chakra to use EMS/Rinnegan efficiently.    He could definitely use the rinnegan effeciently with enough training just like nagato. see as uzimakis are pretty much chakra batteries he could get more use out of MS than kakashi    Damn Rock Lee's son looks handsome as fuck     Madara is George R.R. Martin    Sauce would have dropped his mission if Sarada was a cute boy.   doesn't train daughter   trains someone else's son   Sakura looks really cute in this movie, she needs to give Sauce a son ASAP so Salad won't be lonely.  So with the new gen a smaller cast will their be decent development if Kishi goes through more with it?           Maybe he threw a lightning rasengan ball?  Yep, that's exactly what it is, when you play it in super slow mo you can see he's making a throw motion and the rasengan ball. And earlier in the clip he's practicing making this technique when he's throwing the mini rasengan.    I honestly hope Sarada wins the chunin exam. I care way more about her than Boruto. Plus her parents all have really cool techniques I hope she learns   fire jutsus and sharingan, Healing jutsu and Robot strength from Haruno, and Uchiha shit from Karin      And earlier in the clip he's practicing making this technique when he's throwing the mini rasengan  You have it backwards, anon. He uses the lightning thing first, and then later on when he's wearing his dad's jacket he throws his Rasengan.     I have a feeling sauce would treat sarada way better if she was a boy he could train and do edgy stuff together with     Burrito hates his dad   Trains under Sasuke so he can surpass Naruto    Salad hates her dad   Idolized Naruto and was inspired by him to aim to become Hokage         I hope if Kishi makes more of this new gen that they stick to a pretimeskip tone because Shippuden is a fucking mess.    The obvious solution is for them to switch kids. Or live together in Nurudu's mansion.  Pink Shit gets to sleep in the shed because she'll end up nuking the place otherwise.      There's enough room for Sauce and Salad to move into the Uzumaki household.   Hopefully Bort grows up to be a chill guy like Asuma. Maybe even take Jiraya's place as a wandering pervert sage.    Salad is so mad that Sauce is spending all his time training boruto   She trains her sharingan more and more.   She levels it up to mangenkyo super fast because she already feels like she lost her father.     Learns how to chakra control punch like her gigaton punch of a mother and becomes virtually unstoppable.         i like how boruto wears naruto's childhood jacket and sasuke's scratched headband at one point    hinata is pretty fucking patient, but I'm pretty sure this would make her snap so hard the eyeball-yanking thing on the moon would look like mild displeasure in comparison     What if some leaf Shinobi think he's a rouge because of the scratched headband and kill him?     Sauce would be gone most of the time anyway   Bort and Salad would argue over who gets the top bunk    Sunflower gets a big sister   Hinata threatens Salad with a fate worse than death if she makes a move on her man   Pink Shit is nowhere to be seen         but chakra punch is so telegraphed it only works if you're practically invisible like pink shit, and salad is already bordering on MC status right now    It's the epitome of POTTERY  And it kinda makes sense because it shows how he still cares for his dad and the headband is a reminder of how much bullshit Nurudu went through as a kid saving Sauce's ungrateful edgelord ass.  Plus he can rub it in Salad's face whenever she comes over.        The exam will be interrupted by Aliens. Also  A woman winning anything in Nardo.  Best she can hope for is a draw.        &gt;Pink Shit is nowhere to be seen   I'm still waiting for the follow-up on Pink Shit's newly revealed chronic weakness deal.       Best she can hope for is a draw  She'll win in the fight against  Inojin.      kek     newly revealed chronic weakness deal  ?      YFW she doesn't or gets a draw so Kishi can hammer it home that she is a loser Uchiha.      Salad wins her match and gets promoted   Bort is about to tear Shikadai a new asshole but since ayyliens appear and his dad bribed the judges he doesn't get promoted to Chuunin      Actually a draw would be hilarious because muh Ino vs. Pink Shit PARALLELS     Naruto bribing.  He doesn't even give his friends loans.     True but she's an Uchiha. Meaning she's probably fast and definitely good at dodging shit. Meaning all she has to do is charge the punch, get in range, and wait for you to slip up.       Naruto   not Shikamaru who's already the Hokage's adviser and brother in-law to one of the judges      Fucking boruto? Wasn't he called "bolt" But japs says "L" like we do "R" and the other way around? So it was just "bolt" but they have wierd habit of saying "o" at the end of some words so it's like "bolto"     No wonder she looked so much like Itachi in that flashback.     Fedor in anime      He doesn't even give his friends loans.  We both know Naruto would have a house built for Sakura if she ever asked. And in fact, he just might do that after the Gaiden ends. Sakura just wanted to tough it out because of low self-esteem, and because she wasn't expecting Sasuke to be gone this long.     Oh god no.    He could have a name like Fish cake or vegetable.     filename  You cheeky bastard     Yes, boruto is an english loanword in moonspeak for "bolt" (as in screw/bolt), but the name was not translated back into english since the manga title itself was always in english, and they wanted to do that writing over the name logo thing.   Post some adult Himawari.   She's going to drive her brother to incest, isn't she?    Gotta keep those eugenics strong, m8.      NH ends up canon two generations in a row       Looks like they'll resurrect Kaguya one more time, I see.  Post butthurt and cuck, please.  Where are the spoilers?  Seems like Hiashi's keikaku is going strong here  god tier genes   Bolt receives training from Sasuke, probably got his own technique which is the combination of both Naruto and Sasuke.   might unlock Byagukan later   inb4 Salad unlock MS without a tragedy        Shame, should have brought back Madara instead.    Nothing yet. Either tonight's chapter is boring as fuck, too juicy to even give an inkling of spoilers, or they knew the trailer hype would overshadow everything.     Boruto would rather run into the woods to beg an Uchiha to train him than have anything to do with the useless jobbers from his mother's side   Bravo Hiashi       Sarada ends up raising the child of Boruto and Himawari     If it's true that Karin is Salad's real mom then that'd mean no Haruno shit polluting the gene pool.    something like this?     She needs someone to die in front of her so she experiences deep trauma.  No, she needs to kill someone she deeply cares about to awaken it.  It's a very specific trauma trigger.       IT JUST KEEPS HAPPENING     she needs to kill someone she deeply cares about to awaken it  She doesn't need to kill them. She just needs someone she cares deeply about to die in front of her.   Someone like pic related.         From the looks of the official pic it seems as if she's going to be just a normal citizen.        If Salad becomes cuck 2.0 but still ends up 9th or 10th hokage, does Tobirama win or lose?    Yes. This is the Hiashi-approved eugenics plan.    Fucking eugenist. He even knows that Sakura will get cucked so there will be no Haruno gene      Dude I'm 18   I lied, I'm 12      From the cake pic, she's only just turning 6, so she wouldn't even be in the academy yet: <br/>     I don't fucking get it.  It didn't need that much edit. Why the fuck Kishimoto drew Sakura so much like Itachi? Disturbing.      Didn't Itachi graduate when he was 6? If Himawari isn't at least in the academy by that age then she should be ashamed of herself. Top pedigree and she can't even get to Itachi's level.      That's what you get from being a Hyuuga. Worthless and forgotten.    sorry, but she's tainted by having too many X chromosomes in the kishiverse.    That's the only way Sasuke would get married to a woman.    me kcehc       muh itachi  Itachi is a shitty kishi self-insert/mary sue. I dont know why some people thinks he's the hot shit     Are you seriously comparing a character with two panels of screentime to the ridiculously broken Itachi Stu?     That looks more like Asuma's daughter, Mirai.     Sasuke and Naruto graduated when they were 12 and they can beat Itachi's ass like a drum.    You underestimate Itachi's plot armor.    The game was rigged from the start, anon.    Itachi graduated that early because there was a war. They graduate you earlier if you are a genius when it's war time.     but can they match his cooking no jutsu?     Obviously his plot armor wasn't enough seeing that he died twice.    It's the only way she could get Sauce to fuck her.    twintails  Yes.        Still, how many other characters are there that have been said to have a hokage tier brain at age 7?    It's just poor writing, "oh this 6y old is equal to some 20y old guy coz hes a genius"  Itachi and kakashi were made op via shit writing     I keep seeing this comic without a translation. Could someone please fucking translate it?    Someone should edit this pic to have Salad and Chouchou side-eyeing Himawari's melons.    And he still died twice without losing a single fight.    While I don't mind Chouchou getting a bit skinnier, I think it'd be cool if Even teenage Chou-chou was still noticably chubby.    Only if you'll typeset it.   Hinata: Himawari even looks like you too, Naruto-kun.   Naruto: Hm?   Hinata: Perhaps she'll grow up to be a cute girl like your sexy jutsu.   Naruto: Sexy jutsu...   No, no! Absolutely not! Daddy will never allow that!   sfx: gusu gusu (sob)   sfx: daba (rushing close)   Hinata: Naruto-kun?                Hinata: Himawari even looks like you too, Naruto-kun.   Naruto: Hm?   Hinata: Perhaps she’ll grow up to be a cute girl like your sexy jutsu.   Naruto: Sexy jutsu…   No, no! Absolutely not! Daddy will never allow that!   sfx: gusu gusu (sob)   sfx: daba (rushing close)   Hinata: Naruto-kun?               Implying he doesn't poses some bullshit no jutsu and can come back whenever he wants to     I think Chou Chou and Salad's friendship is probably my favorite part of Gaiden.   Well, Orochimaru sure fucking did, so who knows.     Hinata: Perhaps she'll grow up to be a cute girl like your sexy jutsu.   Hinata basically admitting she wants to fuck her daughter  Somebody stop this woman.      I think the point wasn't that he was a hyper-genius in the traditional intellectual sense but that he had a grasp of responsibility and protecting the people and interests of the village that kids (and most adults) would otherwise never have.  kind of the inverse of shikamaru, whose analytic abilities were staggering, but he literally couldn't give two shits about anything until some of his teammates very nearly died under his command.     Is Bolt gonna be a bully to all his classmates? He's supposed to be the class prodigy right?  Where are the evil spoilers   Hinata is Narutosexual. That includes girl Narutos.   yfw you realize Hinata lives in a house with 3 different Narutos who all love her more than anything     Could someone explain to me how such an obviously shitty, deviantart-tier sonic the hedgehog OC gary stu like Itachi has fans?   The one who said that was a senile old man. The rest of the Hokage didn't know him.    Wouldn't Sasuke's OP genes wipe out Sakura's just like Naruto's did with Hinata's?    Someone call Rokuroh Isako    Some people really like the guy who effortlessly wins battles while acting like he's above it all. Mostly teenagers.     when she's extracted the last drop of semen from her husband she makes her way to Bort's room   after a little /ss/ she makes one last stop at her youngest daughter's doorstep  Doujins when?      There is nothing to wipe out in Sakura. She's empty and barren     I just like to laugh at the shit posted here. And at coolest guy. Madara.  Uchiha family is one big joke.       If bolt is the cool prodigy, does this mean that all the aspiring kunoichi in his class are all over his dick constantly? And what does Milfnata make of these developments?    I spammed the SasuSaku tag last night did any of you see?   He seems friendly with Mitsuki, Shikadai and Inojin.      Wouldn't Sasuke's OP genes wipe out Sakura's     Sakura's   anon, please.        It's worth mentioning that despite her chuuni behavior, Chou Chou does try to have Sarada's back when in tense and dangerous situations.   Trying to give potato chips to Sasuke so that he could have a talk with Sarada so he could fix things.       I hope the Gaiden BTFOs them more, because otherwise they're going to brag for months and months    He's a different sort of prodigy from Sauce. Do you remember any bitches on Nedgy's dick?   Plus he's not as cool and aloof either. Even acts a little goofy at times.      I wonder how he gets along with Lee Jr. since we now know he's a Genin too.    He's the son of the Hokage (power) and the Hyuuga heir (money), plus he's good looking and talented. Kid is almost certainly rolling in pussy. Hinata probably doesn't want to stop anyone from having sex after being repressed for years, but makes sure only the most worthy of women will end up with her sweet boy.     that close-up on Burrito's eye so SP doesn't color them lavender anymore      saying this to your dad   who was an orphan   who's taking care of the whole village  for fuck's sake       how the fuck does this niggers hair even work     Is Bolt gonna be a bully to all his classmates?     He seems friendly with Mitsuki, Shikadai and Inojin.  true.  I hope he bullies the fuck out of chouchou, since he seems to have zero patience for retarded bullshit.          It's a mistranslation again. He only refers to his dad.    Banana.     That head-on smile pic  He does kinda look like Kushina there.      inner sarada becomes her susanoo  how horrifying. also spoilers where?     yeah, but he's still a faggot. character development will kick in, it has to, but he's not as endearing as naruto-kun     His mommy would probably be disappointed if he was a bully to anyone. A cocky showoff asshole, sure, but not a bully.     since he seems to have zero patience for retarded bullshit.  I'm confused, how does Naruto raise someone with a personality like Bolt's? Seems to be the opposite of whatever Naruto and Hinata have.      Chouchou completely misreads Burrito's disdain for her, won't leave him alone.  What does Hinata do?  What does Hiashi do?         wtf?    I don't get that either.  Even if it turns out Sarada is Karin's biological daughter after all is said and done, Sakura still wins by being the actual mother figure.  SasuSaku are treating Sarada as some sort of thing to add into their deranged ship.           What if Nurudu never told him that he grew up an orphan hated by the entire village? What if that's their big breakthrough in the movie?       He has the same bitching and loneliness feels, but with targets to launch them at.     implying Mitsuki isn't on the Hyuuga payroll for exactly those scenarios       Bort shits on Chouchou   it goes completely over her head and she starts bragging to Salad about how the big shot prodigy son of the Hokage is in love with her       Telling your children of your hardships is like telling them to pity you.   Im so mad that boruto and Himawari don't have the byakugan   someone pls post pictures of Hinata being a good mother       &gt;Hyuga heir   Hinata probably might have financial allowances from the Hyuga, but she's an Uzumaki now. Hanabi is the actual Heir of the clan.      I don't think Bolt would want to marry a future Hokage.   DOWNLOAD YOUR ANIME NOW. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. DOWNLOAD YOUR ANIME NOW.

I wonder if it's not too late for summary anon.   Reminder that Shiori a lewd. Lewd!    Stop this sexualization of DALs    I should be OK for 3-4 hours more (maybe 3). Let's see if I could finish it.    Okay, thanks for all the work!    I see, then it sould be fine.     ñ  Cita una viva     Good to hear that, I really appreciate this summary.    If you want to write "Date a Live" in spanish, it would be: "Cita en Vivo"    Ratatoskr is filled with assholes  Let's just kill both DEM and Ratatoskr members together.    with Dainslaif    Wrong this anon is correct     If it's Shiori it's fine. She's used goods whose already done it with 8 other girls after all.    Kill the shidou!   Not possible, it was designed to kill Shidou and only Shidou.    Vivo seria lo correcto si fuera Date Alive. En este caso sin embargo, Date A Live, se traduciría "literalmente" como "Cita Una Viva"    I wonder... I'm from Spain after all, so I guess I should have more experience... that is what you get when translating it on google translate but you shouldn't trust that translator too much.    Seriously, whoever didn't see this coming must be stupid. They were too shady to be good guys.

Es una traducción literal, es correcta, literalmente pero no "traducido"     using google translate to translate spanish  That's even worse than using it to translate English.      el quiere una traducción libre  Porque no vas y le chupa la picha a los de commie?  En todo caso, fui yo el que "tradujo" la vara en el primer post.       It's a satellite who fires a laser beam. Even if it's designed to kill Shidou, it's not like the laser beam only reacts to Shidou's body alone. I'd say we try firing Dainslaif, kill those retards and hope they die. If not, we'll let Kurumi eat them    What if it has only a shoot? and Kotori said it was designed to kill only Shidou so maybe it only reacts to him.   How come she's so best?    It's even worse than that.  Trying to use Google Translate to translate MADE UP English to Spanish.      All big organizations are evil   If they could do that I don't think the Fraxinas would need Kotori's power to use its strongest weapon.    - That's why Woodman decided to give the access to &lt;Dainslaif&gt; only to Kotori, even if that means he is pushing her to shoot her own brother. Woodman tell everyone to calm down in a calm voice. Even though the situation might be the worst, it doesn't mean they're out of choices already.  - Douglas and Almsted make a dubious face. Clayton make an angry face and raise up his voice at Woodman asking him what would he do to improve the situation. Woodman then tell him he don't know either, but as long as Itsuka Commander don't give up, he also don't plan to.  - Woodman look at the three with sharp eyes. The three then make a dissatisfied face. It's no doubt that they thought he is being unreasonable. But for Woodman, he think there is still a chance for Shidou to recover.  - The problem is that Woodman don't think the three in front of him are worthy enough to know the reason behind the 'chance'. What Woodman could do right now is to buy Kotori some time.  - Woodman then say to them he understand he is making an unreasonable request, so in exchange he offer to give them 1% of Asgard Electronics' stock he own every single minute spent.         hecho arriba     my Kin!    - None of the three answered right away. Asgard Electronics is the only other company than DEM who can make Realizer. It is also the back behind &lt;Ratatoskr&gt;'s technology and also Woodman's lifeline.  - To them, the deal sounds too good to be true. Woodman laugh inside his head, that the longer they hesitate, the more time he could made for Kotori. However, the alarm indicating the Spirit Power raising interrupted their thought.  - Clayton choked and yell that there is no way to open the Path and there is no way to stop the berserk of Shidou. He then take out a small terminal from his pocket. - Woodman saw that and choked. It is the same terminal that Woodman and Kotori have, the key to &lt;Dainslaif&gt;. Clayton asked where he got that. Clayton answered him with an old proverb "be prepared and have no regrets" saying there is always a way out somewhere. Woodman called him to stop, but Clayton didn't listened. He then pushed the button without a second thought.   ◇         Nah, following JRPGs logic Ratatoskr would be the good guys if DEM was an empire and they the rebels.     1%  Seriously?     Vale, vale, tranquilo. Solo doy mi punto de vista. Comparto tu opinión con lo de: "Date a Live" y Date Alive". Pero no te enojes    this asshole    That's nearly 2 hours he could buy for her.    and here we go.     Woah. Kaguya bros are active tonight. I like. Kaguya is my favorite twin and is in my top 5.     No anon, no.  Ahora vas a tener que tomar responsabilidad por enojarme.     1% each minute.   Tactical death lazer inbound   Waiting for Phantom   Why does the majority of /a/ hate seinen so much?  What are you talking about.    /a/ is forever 12-21 of age     /a/ loves seinen. just not as much as moeshit.   Manchildren naturally have childish preferences.   It just seems like all /a/ ever talks about is kawaii moe stuff or whatever the most popular thing in season. Then after that its all shonen and any seinen or manime just gets called edgy reddit shit    Aw, hurt feelings. Sounds like you're new here.      moeshit   kawaii moe stuff   Post your face when K-ON is a seinen, fucking retarded /v/edditor trash.        Generally it's the shounen that's called edgy, because shounen (apart from the "let's go on a super happy adventure" type) often are edgy in an attempt to make angsty teens think they're mature.    Hold on m8 I don't mean for there to be any hard feelings. I like cute girls and SoL but I just don't get why anything but that gets shot down here   Most moeshit /a/ loves is seinen  Hate?  Continuing the Symphogear hype. Only 9 more days until episode 1.  New PV came out today:  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CL<wbr>cpO8S8tvY</wbr>  [ ]   The new concert scene looks great already.        Song translation  Exterminate will be on Nana's radio show this sunday.    I want to fuck Kirika.  Tsubasa's charm point    The new concert scene looks great already.  RIP budget.    I want to see Tsubasa taking care of Maria's hairstyle for her while she's restrained in a straightjacket.  Finally got to watch this damn PV after a long day and holy shit, why can't I hold all this HYPE?!  Slowly getting there.   I want to fuck, mind break, and marry Shirabe.      Are you gonna change anything else?    I'd say mix up the X returns squares. They are all right next to each other.     Yeah, still working, give me a moment.      Miku useless    DMJii a cute.  <br/>    Maria Useful   Chris Learns manners   These are never getting filled in.       Now why did you add yoyos? We know that one already. Should've kept chris table manners.     They should make flips during concerts in real life.   I want to marry Kirika!    Also I'm aware that my capitalization is all over the place.   Chris table manners are there, I removed something else. And I wanted Shirabe in there. We still don't know for sure if that's a yoyo, do we?       Nana is already flying around in her concerts. Not long until she does more crazy stunts.    It's a sawblade yoyo.     Chris a free space    Guys send help I can't stop rewatching the Radiant Force part of the PV.   I'm still saying that Kirika's witch themed outfit looks weird as fuck when it's white instead of black.   Anyone have the webm of how songs work being explained to miku?   When you join team good guys your uniform is required to match     I see. Since I removed other obvious things, any more ideas? Something with Anime janai?     Then do something like Shirabe "cooking" instant ramen    Anime-janai's friend getting a geah.    Anon I can't, I'm doing it too.    That's really not going to happen.    I think it looks great.    Change the Miku useless. That is rather pointless.    DMJii duet. Phonic gain. Mikugeah returns.  I'd say take out Apple lyrics, then I realized you were going for unlikely shit, so do what you prefer.  Is the Evil Mastermind square only supposed to be filled if Genjuro is the evil mastermind? Because that swings things from practically confirmed to extremely improbable.         How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real?   They could find her more stuff to throw.   How gay is miku?  How deep can she take bikkis fist?    KIZUNA  KOKORO  HITOTSU NI KAWARE      She can take  all of it    How many people believe in Aoi Yuki again?   Gay enough to turn a shit-tier relic into a killing machine through AI YO.  Elbow deep.     Now the fun about this is to have some completely improbable and some obvious things in them, right?   Can't really remember what that was about.       Lewd     HAZU YO KONO KISEKI NI KUSOU WA NAI E      Is it known who's going to be subbing this? If it's only Commie again I might as well just kill myself   Should be 'Mikugear returns'.    I'd fist Miku's ass with my penis if you catch my drift.    I think the fun about it should be that the event in every single box is HYPE AS FUCK.  Like, the thread fucking explodes with the force of a hundred climaxes every time we get to tick something off.       kusou  It's うそ, anon. くそ means shit.    Best song, and best gear. Why is miku so perfect.   Zoid plans to sub it, he found a timer and an encoder to help.   Commie on the other hand has pretty directly said they don't intend to sub GX.      Fine. But I'm done for now.   It's pretty hard to find enough such things to fill the whole board.       That's what I get for trying to speak gook.  Shou ga nai wa can't be helped.      Why do fansub groups refuse to sub Symphogear anyway? It isn't like a small show no one cares about.    Now  please be consistent in writing words in caps     Doing songs is awkward.    Compared to other shows it is, and it's apparently more difficult to sub due to using technical terms and unconventional Japanese or something.    No simulcast. Too many songs.    Because there's no simulcast script to take, edit and call an original translation. You actually need to know Japanese to sub it. There are only a few fansubbers I'm aware of who are actually good enough to do that.  Start learning moon on your own.      That and karaoke, lyrics everywhere.    Why does a succesful show like this not get a simulcast? Almost every show does nowadays.    Simulcasts killed fansubbing as we knew it    Licensing issues probably.    Do you have any idea how much money it would cost to license all the songs?   I'm so hype I'm even watching this trailer frame by frame.  dat border between red sunset and starry sky     Mexican subs will deliver for sure.     Shit. Will Zoid save us? Commie? FFF?       zoom in on head until it's roughly the same size as mine   scroll down to see how big her ass now is  Magnificent.      No, that was Daiz.    I think my eyes are bleeding    And now I realize they're under a roof that looks like a night sky that's gonna open up just like in the Zwei Wing concert. Hype.    Don't worry /a/, I'll make subs for you. I don't understand Japanese but I'll be sure to put "I want to fuck you Miku" when Hibiki is talking to her, maybe that isn't what she is saying at that moment, but that's what she thinks so it's all right.   Commie like every time. That's until the last episode airs and no subs come out for a whole month.  Bless those fuckers.       new gears  When?     Supposedly Zoid is doing it.   I know enough moon to watch it. I need to pause and rewind raw anime a lot, but I can get through it. I'll feel sorry for people if it doesn't get subbed, though.        99%     No animejyanai in the bingo    8 days 20 hours 31 minutes   So what, 20 days for subs?     I just noticed the London Bridge in the background. Unless they're performing on a barge, I'm guessing that's just a scaled-down replica?    They're in London. Satelight probably doesn't care there's no building in London that could possibly look at the bridge from this angle.     Commie of course. Besides the shenanigans with the last episode their releases were pretty solid. Though you know whenever an insert song gets used the episode will be delayed a day or two.     Commie said they weren't gonna do it. Vale, the Symphogear translator has a job at Sunrise now.      It's a flying arena Maria brought over herself. She set it to hover over the river during the concert.       There goes the typesetting I guess.     It's like when porn artists get jobs doing legit manga and stop doing porn, only worse because at least you have their non-H art to look at now.    Not to shit on people who do this stuff in their free time but we went full weeks without subs well before the last episode.    Since the songs take so long, it might be a good idea if Zoid does two releases; one without the songs, and then a second one after the songs are translated and typeset.    You should tell him that, not us.   I don't know why I have this saved.   I'm not good at that sort of thing.    Maria is shown in a prison getup   In episode 1 she's doing a concert  Wait what? Do they let her out just to sing or something and then immediately lock her up afterwards?       That's how it should be.    didn't mean to post that, sorry    Why do you think they're gonna lock her up again. The prison scene was probably a flashback to the moment when they got her out of it.    I don't see a problem in that.    Time skips. The shuttle incident takes place not too long after G, then something like six months are going to pass before magical girls start showing up. Tsubasa will graduate in that time too.    @zoid9000  Supposedly he lurks here, I doubt he'd mind discussing his plans. Dude seems happy to talk about symphogear at any opportunity.         Further, the live scene in GX will be very different from the one in G, both in terms of music and it’s visual presentation.   It already looks different compared to the other two. There's something melancholic in the lyrics and the atmosphere too.      I can't wait anymore   Fine will come back for real this time right?      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nuH<wbr>fVn_cfHU</wbr>  [ ]   Do we have enough people here who are decent enough at the language in order to translate/summarize the important things in an episode? I feel like I can watch symphogear raws and understand most of it, maybe not the language but it's generally quite easy to understand what is going on (most of the time, action).    The shuttle incident takes place not too long after G  Huh, how do you know that?     Summarize sure, accurately translate only with a raw where I can skip around in. I wouldn't worry too much though, we survived commies erratic shedule just fine so we'll get through this too.    There's usually a few people who fill us plebs in on the confusing parts.    Dear Lord I wish she doesn't, I don't want her to kill herself.    777% We believe in Nana, but we believe in Aoi too. Miracles of the universe.      Ok, just checking.   Isn't the series supposed to start with the concert? Unless its a flashback like the other anon said, I don't see how that makes sense.        bingo  Its starting. The ride is starting.      That's what the story section on the website says, just shortly after the Frontier incident. It doesn't give a more specific timeframe. It does say that magical girls are about 100 days after that though, so not quite six months, sorry.    Flashbacks to explain what happened after G.    Chrisfag weeblord who translated some of the fan comics posted in the threads reporting in.  If subs get delayed I'll summarize episodes in the threads. As long as it's not 20 minutes of techno-babble I think I'll be ok.      Aoi is getting better and better at singing  Finally, there is a candidate to surpass Nana when she retires.  Nice to see you again, Weeblord!      My guess is that the episode will actually start with the shuttle falling and the gears trying to save it, then the time skip will happen and we'll see the pajama party and concert, both of which will be interrupted by the new enemies appearing.   Maria in jail probably is a flashback though. In an interview they said that Maria still being an idol and everything will be addressed in the first two episodes.      Aoi is my angel.   Is it just me or Tsubasa looks more manlier as the time passes?   To me it seems more like it starts with Hibiki and co having a pajama party and watching the concert on TV and then suddenly getting called on site without their gears and then getting permission to use them again afterwards to rescue civilians?   The backgrounds are sure getting better every season.   Shit I just noticed how lewd the crotch region of Maria's idol outfit is.    Same as Tsubasa's Symphogeah, pretty much.    Thank the frenchbro background artist at Satelight.     The frenchies that do background art for Satelight tweeted some months that they were working on Symphogear S3.     Maria is prepared to let Tsubasa stick her sword inside her.      Fushichou no Flamme was about phoenixes and fire   a hot, fast and action-y song   this time they're in goldfish outfits on the river Thames with water sprinklers in the concert  I'm betting it will be a calm ballad or something.       I wish I can work at Satelight too.    That scrolling block of text about authorization is in reference to the shuttle incident. It's giving the 2nd Division permission to act outside of Japan for six hours to save the shuttle.   Scans out bitches  Dump images with discussion please, 1/5 of last thread is literally Irohasu~   Unless you want me dumping Yukino in the name of Spyro     I want to kill this fucking cunt.    My pessimism = gone. Thanks brothers. Weekly Iroha thread when (album-kun, please).         Yahallo!  I'd be ok with a Yukinon dump.  Good Irohasu, everyone!   This anon knows it    Irohafag cancer    How about we split the difference at a "both best girls" dump?   Iroha is my goddess  Who's winning   Now that's genuine Cap'n.    Yui    Irohasu~     pls no more Irohacucks  I don't care if Yui wins the 8 I just don't want her to be sad  and I don't like these chances     I want to see more original design Yukino.     cucks  Then stop instigating responses  Irohasu~       I'll take you up on that offer.    Irohasu~   Happy to be here captain. I was laying low for the most part, but decided to pop back up once the fun started to happen.   Feel free to, a fanart/discussion thread would be a welcome change of pace to what we usually have.           I feel as if those spoilers were true, it'd be a much bigger deal and we'd be discussing it. For the most part, what we've been talking has been mostly the 3way date between the club members   In this volume? Probably Yui. hachiman finally made the homemade cookie connection (and she was the only girl I think to give him something on Vday)  As to who's winning overall, beats me. Probably Yukino and Yui tied at this point         If she is giving him a handy then why is she using two hands?     What? But what about Iroha's spoon scene?     I can't seriously find a stronger term, so I'm going to resort to a simple one  Go fucking Irohass yourself      Irohasu~   Foursomes are pretty nice too you know      Fast. We have little time before they come. Let's discuss a few posts about the series and then we can hide. Because they are coming.    YUI WANTS IT ALL   Yui sandwich end is still best end        IROHA, captain.    Irohasu~   Avatarfag already shitting up the thread. This why the fanbase will always be considered cancer.    Service Club should be changed to The Swinger's Club.  This should legit be a LN series.       Irohasu~   It's your own bloody fault, try not making provoking shitposts like this  and maybe we won't passive aggressively spam fanart.   Try putting your hand over a fire to learn something already.          We aren't 100% sure how that scene is meant to be interpreted because of the dammed Japanese wordplay.    Taichou, I can see them coming. They are about 100 men. What are we going to do, Taichou?   It's happening isn't it?   it could still happen.   You can't stop Irohasu NTR 8man  Irohasu~~~    In case otherfags can't understand it   That's the thing, anon, we know her chances of winning are slim, but we don't give a shit, we still love our queen.  I'll put it like this   1.-She loses the 8bowl, but we don't care that much cause we saw it coming.   2.-She wins the 8bowl and you all faggots get gloriously BTFO by our queen.   We have nothing to lose and everything to win   IROHA OR DEATH   And Reminder   “Huh? W-What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, it won’t work out. There’s someone I like.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, you’re aiming too high. It’s creepy too and not possible.”   “Ha! Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, for an instant that made my heart skip a bit, but now that I think about it rationally, it really wouldn’t work out.”   “…Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, I do like them older, but it really wouldn’t work out.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me while I’m heartbroken? I’m sorry, it’s still not possible just yet.”   “Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a boyfriend just because we went out to have fun for a bit, I’m sorry, please do that only after we do this a few more times.”    “In any case, today turned out to be a good learning experience. Thank you very much.”   Isshiki lightly bowed, honestly expressing her appreciation. Taken aback by her earnest and mannerly behavior, I replied back awkwardly in a fluster. Isshiki lifted her face and laughed in amusement.   “…Senpai, make sure to keep today in mind, okay?”    I was interrupted by Isshiki’s sliding movement towards my side.   “That’s why, for now…”   Isshiki stopped her words there and moved her lips to my ears as if to say something secretly with deceiving eyes at the end.   She added some spice smeared with sugar.   “You’re the only one that I’ll act this way with, senpai.”   These were flirtings.                                Iroha almost wins, but is beaten back by reinforcements coming from a wizard(Shizuka-sensei) and is ultimately defeated?    If a few pictures of an anime girl are physically stopping you from writing out your discussion on the series I don't think your mentally stable enough enough to post or formulate a post in response to an argument.    I thought it was pretty straight forward since the ellipses were at the beginning of the term in question. If it were at the end I could see how it could be interpreted in many ways, but for the most part it sound like his standard way of giving backhanded compliments.  "...But I don't hate it." is pretty easy to understand compared to "I don't hate it, but.."   Irohasu~          You could boil eggs with how hot her crotch is I bet.     It's not insignificant, but the hype that Irohafags exploded into about it was way out of proportion.    You better be off asking god, Anon-kun. I don't know what you will do, but I have family. I will run. If fighting is brave, then running is smart. They are coming Anons! Prepare yourself!   That's it faggots, you guys got on my nerves. POSTING LEWDS    Not really, the whole "but-" argument doesn't make sense because of the lack of commas, and the one about telling the words she was waiting for = lying is just bullshit    inb4 Spyro translates the whole scene as "I don't hate it, but...... it's way too sweet"        Why boil them when you can fertilize them?     A few? Are you fucking kidding?  Half the posts in this thread are Iroha shitposts.  I think I'm really going to have to straight up filter every post with Iroha's name.         I could Yukinospam the shit out of this thread, but you know, I don't want to annoy Yuifags either because we're trying to have a discussion here but you just keep shitting Irohas like your shithole was the new opening to Earth's core.   Seriously anon      Irohasu~    8man need Iroha's saliva bottle      3P works much better though. More than that and it starts getting awkward to keep everyone in play.    Yui's chances have gone up in this volume with giving Hachiman cookies on Vday, him saying to her be genuine with your feelings, and the possibility of another date between just the two of them in the future (the 3way date was supposed to be promise date but Hachiman has a code of honor)  Does Yukino get anything to boosts her chances of winning? Beats me. Hachiman tells her that ultimately she needs to solve her own problems and she is about to give Yui/Hachi a request. But she had a bunch of flags in previous volumes. And the story is mostly going to focus on her from here on out I think   Theres also the Iroha spoon scene but lets not dive into that        That's the thing, anon, we know her chances of winning are slim, but we don't give a shit, we still love our queen. I'll put it like this  1.-She loses the 8bowl, but we don't care that much cause we saw it coming. 2.-She wins the 8bowl and you all faggots get gloriously BTFO by our queen. We have nothing to lose and everything to win.  IROHA OR DEATH           So from that image, everyone is standing but Iroha is kill? What?     I actually agree with that, I think a lot of Irohafags had pent up frustrations since people kept saying Iroha was going to get BTFO in volume 11 for no reason.   At the very least it only lasted for a bout a thread or two. Much better than the Yui berserk threads after that one episode.   Iroh-asu~  Not as easy as you'd like it to be, eh fucker?           Ambush! I repeat, ambush! Some of our comrades changed sides and shot down some of our men! The enemy is increasing! Taichou we have to run!     See   Except, probably when they all end up in college, and miraculously it's the same one.      The report function exists.    posting fanart   shitpost  Irohasu?       We have nothing to lose and everything to win.   IROHA OR DEATH  So Irohafag lives are truly worthless then.      You do realize that you're implying Iroha is sleeping around on 8man, right? Learn to use NTR correctly for god's sake.    Here your "Irohafags shitposting"    <br/>       No need no know how to read moonrunes.  No need to know how to real at all.             Dump will be shitty jpgs.     Friendly bump.     Unfriendly Gon.       I've never done a thorough search, but this is the first time I've seen decent scans of the manga.  Not that I'd need them, since I already have physical copies.        this is the first time I've seen decent scans of the manga  Precisely.          Us-sama       Oh.  Are you the scanlator? Why is it jpg?          Are you the scanlator?  Yes.  Why is it jpg?  To dump faster. Mediafire link with pngs at the end.                  Gon was my favourite Tekken 3 character       Looping ending.     Upload them to madokami, son                Oh, it's the Tekken 3 guy       Jesus, Gon is a piece of shit.      Bullying intensifies next chapters.      he could have just killed the bear though       Mediafire link with pngs at the end.  waiting on this     God bless you      And done. Next chapter who knows when.    http://www.mediafire.com/download/2<wbr>d2dr7fahb944we/gon_c01.rar</wbr>    Thanks.   Greetings from /co/ to Gon. We should hang out more.  -Love, Age of Reptiles      Reminder that if you haven't watched this movie yet, you're living your life wrong.   Jaw dropping art! Thanks for sharing.  Oh, thanks, almost didn't see this thread. Just use the Keyman filedrop if you wouldn't mind, I might not always see these.  This shit looks like its meant for eight year olds   This is why we don't have nice things    I just invited an anon from a different country over last weekend and enjoyed it together with him.   Thanks.    Can you blend/redraw the fur some more in the middle panel, along the seams of the join? It's still somewhat obvious.     Spent enough time with this chapter already.     Very well. I'll need to see if anyone wants to clean the color pages, anyway.    Gon is the strongest character ever created.   He even meets somebody stronger in his own manga.    no words  dropped     Can you upload the PSD, then?     Deleted after getting a satisfying result.     Oh well. The whites are overleveled in the strip where the pages are joined.    Somebody tell me how this retarded substitution jutsu works. It must have a weakness to exploit, right? I just played somebody who avoided my attacks 100% of the time. Not just once, but twice in a row. Online! In an incredibly laggy environment.   First of all, how is that possible? I would like to avoid all attacks as well but the substitution jutsu only works sometimes and sometimes not, especially when there is lag. How can I learn the proper timing when there is lag? And even if I knew the proper timing, how can it be used when there is lag.   Secondly, how do you punish that shit?      Fuck wrong board. I wanted to post this on /v/.   this is the average thread on /v/   this anon who is retarded enough to post the thread on the wrong board posts here frequently    You see they have to get repeating digits like these   So close     Naruto fan posts on N/a/ruto board frequently   Wow. What a fucking asshole.     What's her name again?    Not fapping as soon as the ice cream starts   Are you fucking gay or something?      Clearly, you never watched episode 2.   Chico &gt; Pico = Coco   Coco is best girl you faggot     Being this wrong   Coco &gt; Pico &gt; Shit &gt; Chico     Why does everyone look like girls in part 5  what is the fastest stand? besides Made in Heaven of course   I heard he could. He said that in the J♂j♂nium volumes. He prefers the faggot statue of david sameface art.    possibly silver chariot without armor     Mind to post a link?   Weather Report when?      SUTAR PURACHIMA   Reach for the stars UFO-kun    Eating donuts in bed   That's how babies are born.      She's so awkward around him, almost as if she didn't know him at all. I can't picture them calling each other by their first names outside of school without Reina fainting.   Typical straight girls in Japanese media.  The two of them should just fuck already.   shop reina and kumiko     Precure Thread    Pirika Pirilala Popolina Peperuto! Post the prettiest Cure!</blockquote>]
