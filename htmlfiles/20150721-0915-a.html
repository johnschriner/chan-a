[ So now that the dust has settled, what do you think about the Punk Hazard arc? Personally I thought that the part with the kids was a bit too long and yeah it was meant to be a pre-arc/build-up arc for dressrosa, but I still thought that it was pretty good as a standalone. The only thing that was really off is that Ceasar was the main villian. The endboss, the last one fighting before baby 5 arrived, should have been Vergo in my opinion. It would also have been good if law took out the arc boss in taht arc instead of luffy who got doffy in dressrosa.  <br><br>I think remove the running + kids and it would have been alright.</br></br>  <br>Vergo is gross and I'm glad he died.</br>  <br><br>Sugar pls.</br></br>  <br>it was breddy gud read all in one go. Weekly it was a pain during the children part</br>  Daily reminder that Law a slut.  <br>reposting</br>  <br>Why should Vergo have been the main villain? He didn't destroy the island with poison gas or experiment on children. He was just an ambassador of Doffy's.</br>  <br>I completely forgot about this page</br>  <br>I thought that Vergo is probably stronger than Ceasar and ceaser being a little bitch and blowing everything up after losing while vergo gives no fuck and fights law headon would have been sick</br>  Better than negrofish island  <br>Painfully tedious through the children part, but worth it just to have scenes like this in the OP.</br>  <br>++<br> exploring the island at the beginning with best crewmates <br> Caesar a cute <br> Vergo kicking ass <br> Law hates fun <br> Kinemon <br> Brokers <br> Kuzan and Doffy <br>~~<br> Monet <br>- - <br> way too long <br> too much running <br> Caesar was a cakewalk <br><br>I want Oda to do another 20-30 chapter arc like Impel Down/Marineford, or every arc before Alabasta. I know that arcs need to be a full year for merchandising and shit but not everything in FI and PH needed to be as long as it was</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but I'm gonna need to you get off of him. <br> need to you </br></br>  <br>yeah for the speed that the groups that scanlated the colored version invested they lost a lot of accurancy in return.</br>  It wasn't all that bad. The Yeti's were hyped and was a huge let down and the whole saving the children deal felt a bit forced and unnatural. I didn't really have any problem with the rest, even when I read it weekly.  <br>My only real problem was the cop-out with the gas.</br>  <br>Good to marathon, kinda poor otherwise</br>  <br>Why is Smoker such a jobber post-TS?<br><br> Played by Law  <br> Rekt by Vergo <br> Got his ass handed to him by Doffy <br><br>All in a single short arc. Oda must really hate him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>his fruit became nearly useless when Haki was introduced. Since he seemd to rely a lot on it at the beginning, he somehow lost his combat power. I wish oda decided to make him a threat again</br>  <br>The smoke fruit was easily the worst logia<br><br> inb4 the mud fruit was worse <br><br>The swamp fruit allowed for infinite void (like blackbeards) and incredibly entrapment capabilities. <br><br>I'm not saying his fruit is bad, because he IS a logia. But damn his fruit is shit compared to others</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw Vergo was the only good seat </br>  <br><br>Well it's bad on the face of how it's been used - it could do so much more really.</br></br>  <br>The saddest thing is that ceasar's fruit is basically a 100 times better version of smoker's. I mean Gas &gt; Smoke. There are so many things ceasar can do while smoke is stupidly limited to hurr durr Imma smoke all over you.</br>  Smoker is probably just going to full on CoA from now. And use his Smoke to proper his punches or whatever.  <br> One piece is shit cause oda can only make luffy be inflated </br>  <br><br>I never understood why Smoker didn't do an attack where he binds them and 'pours' smoke down their throat to fill their lungs and suffocate them.<br><br> inb4 an awakened smoke fruit gives them lung cancer </br></br></br></br>  <br>The gas fruit is easily among the top logias. <br><br>Up there with Darkness and Lightning.<br><br>Caesar can suffocate fire, immediately giving it the edge of the Mera Mera and Magu Magu. <br><br>Lightning can't really exist in the convential sense in a vacuum (which Ceasar can create as seen when he suffocated the strawhats.) so it's got the edge over the lightning fruit. <br><br>Smoke is pretty much a gas, so you figure that one out.<br><br>Without air, snow and ice are pretty much just water so it's got the edge over that. <br><br>The only ones I can't really see it having a massive effect on would be light and darkness, and I'm sure it would have some adverse effect on sand and mud.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah again, fruits are only as strong as the user, like Kizaru.</br></br>  <br> and Magu Magu. <br>magma doesn't burn, it just sets things on fire<br>even if you prevent it from burning you still have thousand-degree molten rock</br></br></br>  <br>Probably because Oda didn't intend on the MC and his crew dying before they even reached the Grand Line.<br><br><br>Is Magma reliant on Oxygen ?</br></br></br></br>  <br> not breaking the empty dielectric <br>Enel can do that</br></br>  <br><br>Well even later on, there's so many better ways Smoker can use his fruit.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's true that fruits are dependent on the user. Whitebeard with the weakest fruit you could think of is still incredibly powerful. But you have to consider that fruit's still have some basis of power over one another. Lightning was said to be invincible, Darkness was said to be the strongest logia, Quake was said to be strongest paramecia, Operation fruit is said to be "The ultimate devil fruit", so that's just what I think. All I'm saying is it's blatantly one of the most powerful fruits possible.<br><br><br><br>Not necessarily, but high gusts of winds could probably cool it if strong enough.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> kizaru is shit </br>  <br><br>No I agree - I was just saying it was much stronger than people realize due to Caesar being shit.</br></br>  <br> Whitebeard with the weakest fruit you could think of is still incredibly powerful <br>Why ? All he did was cause Earthquakes. The most basic shit his DF could do. I agree that WB was a strong as dude but he wasn't really all that creative if you think about it.</br></br>  <br><br>Well he rarely fights seriously and hardly takes the Light fruit to the levels it could be.<br><br>His attitude is his own handicap, for what is arguably the strongest power in the series.</br></br></br></br>  <br>earthquakes, tsunamis, tilting the entire island, shattering aokijis ice<br><br>what else is there to do</br></br></br>  <br> not bending light rays to be invisible assassinating everyone and become king of the world </br>  It was a nice setup for the Donquixote Family and Dressrosa. It's actually shorter than some people make it out to be. The kids were a plot device to show how vile Caesar and Monet were, and by extension, Doflamingo.<br><br><br>She already appeared.<br> Inb4 kengo <br>You realize a swordsman can be a samurai or just someone who fights with a sword, right?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Enels fruit is just as good if not more so<br>Both are fast enough to basically teleport<br>Both can do ridiculous nukes<br>Both are logias<br>Enel also had island-wide maphack, he could restart his own heart, he could mold gold at will, he built and powered a ship that flew to the moon and could literally vaporize entire islands</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> just someone who fights with a sword, right? <br>Shanks &gt; Mihawk<br>Shanks uses a sword<br>Shanks is the Worlds Strongest Swordsman<br><br>Alright, it's official.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Surely it's the opposite, even if you're being sarcastic ?</br>  Punk hazard arc ruinned Nami as a character just like Dressrosa ruinned both Sanji and Robin  <br>Shanks may have surpassed Mihawk had he not lost his arm. <br><br>Scratch that, he is stronger than Mihawk.</br></br></br>  <br>Smoker really wasn't shit to begin with, his seastone tipped jitte &amp; weapons training are the only things he ever had going for him. He's just the only one smart enough to use a seastone based weapon.</br>  <br>That's a stretch. And based on nothing.</br>  <br>That, and he was merely an example of what a logia is and is capable of doing. Hell, he was merely the border patrol for the Grand Line, in East Blue.<br><br><br>One is a Yonkou and the other is a Warlord. Not hard to put two and two together.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We're talking about the better Swordsman, not the better Pirate.</br>  <br> implying Mihawk couldn't become a Yonko if he wanted </br>  <br><br>Never said it wasn't.</br></br>  <br><br>So what? The point is, Shanks may not have the skills Mihawk has with a sword, let alone have a special snowflake sword but that's not all he's capable of doing. He's definitely stronger all along. But I get your point.</br></br>  <br>Just wait for Smoker to awaken his fruit and turn other people into smoke.</br>  dude what if smoker turned into weed smoke and got erry1 relly high lmao  <br>I don't think that's how it works. He might be able to suffocate people without having to shove part of his hand inside someone's throat. Like Crocodile's right hand or whatever.</br>  <br>What if he turned into cigarette smoke and gave everyone cancer like your post just did?</br>  <br>Light&gt;Electricity, considering that charge can't be transmitted without photons. And Enel can only teleport in conducting material.<br><br>I'd think that haki covers that. Just like it makes you see where the light will hit so you avoid it before the laser is released.</br></br></br>  <br>  And Enel can only teleport in conducting material. <br>You mean like, the air?</br></br>  <br>Yet another reason why that DF is wasted on Smoker.</br>  <br>it was good, because Caesar was there</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elect<wbr>rical_resistivity_and_conductivity</wbr></br>  <br>I bet he's secretly by Kizaru for easy highs after Akainu burned down his weed stash.</br>  <br>Outside of his very first appearance, Smoker was never not a jobber<br>Hell, even then, he didn't even capture any pirates</br></br>  What if Luffy was a fishman?  <br>he'd be stronger</br>  <br>but fishmen are all weaklings</br>  <br>What's keeping enel from using a lightning strike as a means of teleportation?</br>  <br>devil fruit magic<br><br>Think of it this way: devil fruits don't turn your body into rubber, or electricity, or whatever.<br><br>They grant your body magical properties /resembling/ those of rubber or electricity or whatever.<br><br>It'll make your brain hurt less when you try to think about how they work.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wrong, Luffy is made out of rubber, even under the effects of seastone. Logias, on the other hand, can turn into their element at will (even subconsciously after some training). <br><br>Don't know if that works. He was never shown to travel through anything non-conductive.</br></br></br>  <br>Jinbe isn't. And he's pretty much the only fishman that matters.</br>  <br>Wait what? Devil fruits don't make you resemble an element. They transform your body into the element. Not just a resemblance but full on transformation.</br>  <br> Wrong, Luffy is made out of rubber, even under the effects of seastone.  <br><br> Wait what? Devil fruits don't make you resemble an element. They transform your body into the element. Not just a resemblance but full on transformation. <br><br>But that's obviously wrong. Luffy's body behaves like what a 6 year old might think rubber is like, but not actually real rubber. Half the shit he does has no basis in the real world at all, and he doesn't do half the shit rubber would actually cause. <br><br>He's not rubber, he's a weird magic material that looks and acts like rubber kinda sorta that is called rubber for brevity.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>luffy isn't normal rubber<br>if he was he'd die for starters</br></br>  <br> Don't know if that works. He was never shown to travel through anything non-conductive. <br><br>You're right, but I don't really sure why he shouldn't be able to, since he's a lightning man and lightning travels through air</br></br></br>  <br>Jinbe fought to a standstill with Ace.<br><br>Fucking Ace.<br><br>The strongest fishman alive, is on par with a guy who was one-shot by an Admiral.<br><br>Fishmen suck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon it's a mongolian picture book<br>I don't think 100% realisim is the intent here</br></br>  <br> but not actually real rubber <br>Yeah, no shit. But his body is still made out of One Piece universe rubber.</br></br>  <br>That's exactly what I'm saying. I'm glad we agree.</br>  <br> real world <br>are you seriously watching one piece going "that's not how it works in the real world"?</br></br>  <br>Considering that Jinbe is just a dude and Ace was a fucking Logia, that's pretty goddamn impressive. Luffy didn't stand 2 seconds against his first Logia. he almost died 3 times against his second. Only beat the 3rd because he literally was the one person who could counter the fruit.</br>  <br> are you seriously watching one piece going "that's not how it works in the real world"? <br><br>No, I'm responding to the guy watching One Piece and asking "wait, why can't he do X that he could do in the real world?"<br><br>Also<br> watching <br> one piece </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   tfw you realize that brooks obnoxious comic relief persona is the result of damage to his personality from spending 50 years in complete solitude   <br>Sure, the first THREE Logias Luffy ever faced were rough, before he had even heard of Haki. Luffy's been at sea for &lt;3 years now and doesn't give a bigger shit about Logias than any other fruit user. Ace had been at sea for what, 3-4 years by Marineford? You can't compare Ace with 3-4 years at sea to Luffy's first few logia opponents.<br><br>And you can't even argue that Luffy has an advantage due to being trained by Rayleigh, because Ace was under an even stronger guy AND in the New World.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, what ? No, let's focus on Jinbe. Dude fought against Ace for 5 bloody days. What;s the furthest Luffy has gone without eating ? 3 days ? When he's out cold after fighting and almost dying ? Jinbe even tanked Akainu's magma so that's another point for him.</br>  <br>That's also why he doesn't actually talk to anybody, just talks at them.</br>  <br>Yes, Jinbe took ONE HIT from an admiral and was on the verge of death. A hit he was unable to block or avoid.<br><br>He's shit. There's no strong fishman. No admiral-tier, no yonko-tier.</br></br></br>  <br>Nigger, the strongest fucking man in the entire goddamn World got half his fucking face blown off by that magma cunt. Jinbe is the strongest fishman in the World. Better than Shirahoshi, even.</br>  <br> the strongest fucking man in the entire goddamn World got half his fucking face blown off by that magma cunt. <br><br>As an eldery man on the verge of death.<br><br>  Jinbe is the strongest fishman in the World. <br>I don't disagree. In fact, that's my point exactly.<br><br>Fishmen are weak.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do you even take shirahoshi as a comparison? She is fucking weak to say the least.</br>  <br> As an elderly man on the verge of death <br>Still was the Strongest Man in the World.<br><br>Jinbe achieved the same feat as Whitebeard, hence he's as strong as a Yonko.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just because of Poseidon. Some people get a shit fest when people say ''Shirahoshi is weak''.</br>  <br> Jinbe achieved the same feat as Whitebeard <br><br>No, WB lost half his face and didn't slow down. Further, he was old and dying of age, AND suffering a myriad of other injuries.<br><br>Jinbe got hit one time and almost died.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, no, they both got hit. One died, the other didn't. That's all I'm saying bro. Jinbe stronger than Whitebeard, confirmed.</br>  <br> only argument that fishmen aren't weak is shitposting <br><br>I accept your concession</br></br></br>  <br>Massive troll.<br>Don't fall for the bait anon.</br></br>  <br> One is a Yonkou and the other is a Warlord <br> Meanwhile a pirate who isn't either of those things has been facestomping warlords left and right <br>muh powerlevels</br></br></br>  <br>It's their fucking problem if they can't handle the truth.<br><br>Shirahoshi is weak. <br><br>What good is the power to control the sea kings when any decent pirate can one-shot you before you can even say a word.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, saying Jinbe is weak just because he got hit by Akainu is pretty bullshit too. Double standards, people.</br></br>  <br>Jinbe is weak because he's fucking weak.<br><br>He fought to a draw with fucking Ace.<br><br>Again, there's not a single god damn fishman that's Yonkou or Admiral level. Fishmen are shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It´s not like there´s actually a race out there stronger than humans.<br>Even giants are dogshit now.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I know Shirahoshi is weak but I just didn't want to cause a drama which leads to other people causing drama which leads to more shitposting which leads to more fujoposting which leads to everyone and their mothers complaining about how shit OP threads are everyone telling each other to kill themselves which summons Rebeccafag for some fucking reason, which causes the thread to go even lower, which is pretty much a fucking achievement in itself. <br><br>It ain't that simple bro.</br></br></br>  <br>And Ace could beat Luffy. Ergo Jinbe could beat Luffy, who's the future Pirate King. Therefore Jinbe is stronger than the Pirate King.<br><br>I have no qualms over shitposting, friend.</br></br></br>  <br> Even giants are dogshit now. <br> Implying giants haven't been shit since day one <br>Dorry &amp; Broggy seemed to get toppled pretty easily</br></br></br>  <br> So now that the dust has settled, what do you think about the Punk Hazard arc? <br>We got Monet so I can't say it was absolutely worthless.</br></br>  <br>Well shit. I didn't think that far ahead but damn you're right.</br>  <br>You're also the only one between the two of us that's shitposting.<br><br>Jinbe is the strongest fishman.<br><br>Jinbe could not take any admiral or yonkou, all human, in a fight.<br><br>Fishmen suck shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Technically the strongest man in the World couldn't defeat Akainu either. Guy was just fine after that beat down.</br>  <br>Man, everything is a bloody time bomb these days. I just want to enjoy these threads for as much as possible before it all goes down hill.</br>  <br> Jinbe could not take any admiral or yonkou <br>Admirals are backed up by particularly broken devil fruits.</br></br>   next chapter <br> marco cover story <br> chapter starts with a big dent on big mam's ship <br> That bastard black leg sanji almost made a hole in our ship-bon <br> doffy gets assassinated by cp0 <br> luffu and co start to sail for zou </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except for garp.</br>  <br> strongest man in the World <br><br>What a bunch of imbeciles you Whitebeard Pirates are!<br><br>Well I suppose it's no surprise your captain being who he is.<br><br>After all Whitebeard is nothing but a loser from a dead era!<br><br>Gold Roger conquered the entire Grand Line. He gave his life to open the door on a new era the Great Age of Pirates. A Navy man like me probably shouldn't say this but that man truly deserved the title of "Pirate King".!<br><br>What is Whitebeard when compared to that? I mean did he even have the guts to fight against Roger? All he's ever done is hide in some safe corner of the world and keep himself out of trouble right? These days some fools may claim Whitebeard's name alone upholds peace on various islands. But as far as I'm concerned he just intimidates the small-fry and believes himself a hero for it.<br><br>Ridiculous! Roger maintained his honor as long as he lived and even dead his fellow pirates hailed him as a king. In other words Whitebeard is an eternal loser who will never surpass Roger! That is all he is.<br><br>Everything I've said is the truth. Now that I think of it he sure is one pitiful man. Making all his underlings call him their "Old Man" or "Father" or whatever and sailing the seas playing house.<br><br>He reigned the seas for decades yet he never became a king or gained anything. He got himself stabbed because one of those foolish "sons" of his believed every word I said and now he'll die to protect that same fool. Truly an empty existence.<br><br>If man does not live righteously he does not deserve to live at all! You rogue pirates don't deserve a "place to belong"!<br><br>Whitebeard will die a loser! A fitting end for a little fish in a big pond!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> this post <br> everyone got cancer </br></br>  <br>Surely Akainu would shit on Roger too ? It's not like he had some kind of personal vendetta against Whitebeard. It's time people updated this pasta.</br>  <br> I just want to enjoy these threads for as much as possible before it all goes down hill. <br>Then tell people to stop bringing up powerlevels since clearly no one is mature enough to discuss it<br>also get rid of dumbasses who don't know the difference between admirals and vice-admirals</br></br></br>  <br>Ace is dead akainu.<br>The bait isn't going to work on anybody else.<br>So go back at being a government puppy.</br></br></br>  <br>Hah, if only the World worked like that. A person speaking against powerlevels would became the bait for the powerlevelfags who'd argue about titles and positions and shit. It's pretty inevitable.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128350482 <br>Seems like I have to write another mail to moot</br>  <br>It's a fucking battle shonen so of course there will be powerlevel discussions. You can't eliminate that element from discussion.</br>  <br>Yeah, I know. I admitted to making that mistake. But I wonder if the two are still evenly matched.</br>  <br>Shit like this is unfortunately inevitable in 4chan and more so in /a/ where somehow all the children roam.</br>  Why is 50% of the strawhats useless fodder?  <br>Ace could beat Luffy? Are you high? You better mean pre-TS Luffy. Ace is a weak fucboi.</br>  <br><br>Because franky is strong enough to compensate for nearly the whole crew without even using his mecha</br></br>  <br>Not that guy but I have nothing against powerlevel discussions. But what we have on /a/ is everything but a discussion. It's 2 or more idiots shitposting and ruining the thread without discussing a damn thing.</br>  <br>Exactly. And that's precisely why I try my best to cover my bases so I don't accidentally bait and annoy someone.</br>  <br>Because the only thing that matters to marineford babies are fights.</br>  <br>Well, considering that Ace isn't alive Post-TS, yes, I meant Pre-TS.</br>  <br> Jinbe is the strongest fishman. <br><br>That's just sad. An island were the scrubs start off with x10 the strength of humans, even better underwater, and then whatever additional abilities their sea creature blood carries. It's practically an island of Zoan or at least SMILE users. They also have unique fighting styles were they hit the water in people's bodies with Fishman Karate or can manipulate the water itself with Fishman Jujutsu, but hardly anyone knows this and the best they can produce is Jimbe. Hody needed dozens of pills to be a threat, Neptune's can't do anything, Namur looks like a smaller Jimbe but he still has potential, and Hack got the Maynard treatment. Oda really fucked up by making them a weak island that got raped and captured by pirates regularly.</br></br></br>  Is anyone else hoping for a more lax arc in the near future?<br>A shorter, more light-hearted one with not as many fights and more opportunities for Strawhat sillyness.</br>  <br>Don't get smart with me.</br>  <br> A shorter, more light-hearted one with not as many fights and more opportunities for Strawhat sillyness. <br>So ... you want a manga filler arc?</br></br>  <br>Why ? That easy to outsmart you ?</br>  <br> manga  <br> filler <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br> no fights is filler <br><br>I want an arc like that too, its probably just nostalgia for pre timeskip arcs like water 7 and shit</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Ace was apparently equal to Jinbe (fought for 5 days)<br><br>Can current Luffy defeat Jinbe in a fight? Honestly I'm not sure.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the crew desperately needs one so that everyone who isn't named Luffy, Zoro or Usopp can have an actual character again.</br>  <br>Current Luffy would shit on Ace.</br>  <br>what happened</br>  Punk Hazard was great except for that it was literally running, the arc.<br><br>Vergo and Monet were quality villains. Vergo ended up being the strongest executive in retrospect. Caesar had a lot of cool attacks even though we know now that Luffy and Zoro were sandbagging could've one shotted him at any moment.<br><br>I just wish that Vergo and Monet stay dead. I know they won't. It makes their final interactions with Doffy that much more meaningful if they had actually died.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's some tricks we've seen Smoker do that no other Logia did, like projecting his smoke-arms while the hand is still physicla and, say, grasping his jutte, or flanking an enemy by covering an area in smoke and emerging from it<br>I got the feeling it's kind of a mobility oriented fruit, which is kinda shit compared to say the Pika Pika no Mi, but they can't all be absolute winners and everyone can have his niche<br>Also for some reason it seems like it and the Mera Mera no Mi cancel each other out, which is fucking amazing considering its reputation</br></br></br>  <br>The best way to beat Smoker is to set up a large Fan.</br>  <br>I don't like how they made Smoker into an eternal jobber. He was supposed to be like Garp was to Roger. Now I think even Usopp and Nami would oneshot him.</br>  The problem with the recent arcs is that there's too much focus on side charactes and not enough on the crew members.  <br>Calm down m8 and smoke 420 blaze it magmafag!!!</br>  <br>That's going too far anon.</br>  <br>I just realised that the 4 crewmates exploring the island + Franky were the ones who stayed on Dressrosa.</br>  <br>Let's not exaggerate that much.</br>  <br>Brook and Sanji kinda explored the Island too.</br>  Who's the next nakama?<br><br>Everyone knows Jinbei's going to join or tragically die in the process so he doesn't count.</br></br>  <br>I'd put Jimbei on the same level as Sanji atm. Considering Sanji hasn't revealed his special kicks yet, this can be thought to be a pretty accurate estimation.</br>  <br>Bellamy.</br>  <br>Rebecca was good fanservice, but aside from that this character was one of the most annoying of the whole manga, alongside Momonosuke, Brook and Wanze.</br>  <br>How is that a problem?<br>Personally I love how oda is giving the attention to law and in the future other supernova/worst generation. We've already have stories and arcs dedicated to the crew members now we have to explore other characters such as the worst generation pirates.</br></br>  <br>Springy Dick.<br>Followed by  Caesar .</br></br>  <br>No way she's 16 years old.</br>  <br>I think there will be a "B-team alliance" that stays on the Straw Hats' side forever but isn't officially part of the team.<br><br>Jinbei should be the final Strawhat.</br></br></br>  <br>I really got turned on when Luffy pinned her down. But then I got pissed at those youtube comments from Ameridumbs who literally think they are the highest upholders of morality and ethics.</br>  What would be the shittiest logia to ever exist?<br> Other than a literal shit/piss one. </br>  <br>Knowing Oda it would be something like a fart logia.<br><br>I guess glass would be pretty shitty. You could cut people but would get smashed instantly.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You were saying Magma brat?</br></br>  do you guys think there will be a point in the story where shanks and buggy fight together again? I really want to see them tag team someone or multiple people  <br>Slime logia?</br>  <br>paper logia from the gba game</br>  <br>They're probably connected like Doflamingo was with Kaidou</br>  <br>Can this be a figurine?</br>  <br>A paper devil fruit power can be devastating if used correctly.</br>  <br>What was the name of the girl from Read or Die? The Paper. Not the three girls, but the original.</br>  The best Logia is Cloud<br><br> Lightning anytime <br> Smoke-like powers <br>  Weather Control <br> Flight </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> everyone who isn't Luffy, Zoro or Usopp can have an actual character again <br>Luffy- yeah sure, he has a character<br>Usopp- great character, probably one of the best written<br>Zoro- uh. No. His character is ME STRONG YOU DEAD WITTY ONE LINER</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good doujin. One of the only 2 Rebecca ones I could find. The other one was a little weird.</br>  <br>because they have roles on the ship and you can write more funny/interesting scenes if some strawhats are strong and some are weak</br>  <br>I'm thinking it could be like the one in JJBA part 4. Once the guy with it as a stand figures out your fear and fear tic then he can turn you into paper. He could also turn inanimate objects like guns into paper and then make them normal again to use.</br>  <br>That's either Caesar's gas logia or a water logia.</br>  <br>there are like a thousand times more humans than fishmen</br>  <br>I mean the ones who drew the lot, not the ones after.</br>  <br> Usopp- great character, probably one of the best written <br><br>It's weird seeing all this Usopp love , I haven't read past Fishman Island but does he get a much bigger spotlight post-timeskip? It seems that people love him more than sanji now.</br></br></br>  The bad things were just too bad:]<br><br>-Fucking let me waste some chapters and put Nami in a good light kids.<br>-Deadly gas of death that was not so deadly.<br>-The crew lost to sleeping gas 3 times.<br>-The worst character of One Piece yet: Yeti Cool Brothers. Even Curiel is better, yes fucking Curiel.<br>-Running.<br>-High exposition to random mooks.<br><br>It had hype though, like :<br><br>-Pirate alliance "against" a Yonko.<br>-Doffy moves.<br>-Aokiji´s whereabouts.<br>-Hype for future Aokiji vs Akainu flashback.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't Oda confirm that Water DF would be too OP in an SBS?</br>  <br><br>get out of here fuccboi, I heard the WG calling for you again</br></br>  <br>because saji is a jobber and is 10 years since he made something awesome</br>  <br>Tashigi &gt; Monet, as the events themselves show.</br>  Which villain do you think got off the easiest?  <br>tashigi would not have won a 1v1, but still tashigi&gt;monet because tashigi got lucky and got the genetics that makes zoro want to protect her</br>  <br><br>Caesar</br></br>  <br>Don Krieg, becaue when Luffy beat him down he had nothing left to lose anyway</br>  <br>But he did<br>All the fucking time.</br></br>  <br>Akainu is such a master troll. He knew exactly what he was doing and he baited Ace so hard.</br>  Could Akainu defeat Madara Uchiha?  <br><br>I'm sorry for asking but where can I read colored scans or in the very least where the chapter is all on one page instead of<br>having to click every page. Thank you.</br></br></br>  <br>kissanime</br>  <br>http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/one-p<wbr>iece-digital-colored-comics-r10004<br><br>It only goes up to chapter 700 by the way, But that's not really a problem since that's like 7/8 of entire manga.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Yeah well, Ace was an easy target: stubborn, violent, proud and reckless<br>Really he didn't grow up much from when he was a brat hiding in a mountain bandit hideout, he just put a lid of good manners on that</br></br>  <br>I've been rereading it ever since I found about the colored ones and continuing from 700 without color really sucks now.</br>  <br>Roger was just like that, Ace would have never grow out of being reckless and think of others before him.</br>  <br> bro <br> bro <br> bro </br></br></br>  <br>The OP manga looks so amazing with colour, it kinda looked unappealing without colour after watching the anime but once I found those I jizzed my pants. The panels look like a clusterfuck if you're used to reading in colour.</br>  <br>basically the same ussop bs as always, either hes throwing rotten egg, running around with a mask, or winning because of how retarded his personality is, oda literally took the small nuances the crew had in the crew and magnified them times 100. chopper became a monster teddy bear, nami went from flat chested to cow in the span of 2-3 years, robin still fine af tbh, sanji hasnt done a goddamn thing except run after females and get his shit rekt, franky i have to admit is badass, luffy is luffy, and zoro's design gives him a clear advantage over every enemy</br>  <br>Well that's because you have shit taste but it's ok, children need their books colored.</br>  <br><br>Usopp stole everyone hearts on the Going Merry death (Water 7) that arc gave a backbone and another very rich dimension to the character, he also proven hes baddass when standing ground facing Luffy</br></br>  <br><br>And now he's a God.</br></br>  <br>Kissmanga you muppet.</br>  <br>Yes, Luffy has the capacity to fuck Jinbe up if he hasn't gotten any stronger since Marineford.</br>  <br> spoonfeeding a bait <br>Will you ever learn?<br><br><br> being a retard <br>this is too sad</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and that's the joke</br>  Friendly reminder Garp is literally shit<br> could have raised the son of the Pirate king and the son of the revolutionaries and grandson of the legendary marine hero on his own,making them an unstoppable duo <br> could have eliminated the future pirate king without even knowing it <br> could have been their mentor and protector until they were both strong enough to make it to VA <br>Instead he threw them with a bandit and said "lol you better not become pirates you little shits"</br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy was corrupted by that filthy pirate Shanks before he even got to Dadan.</br>  <br><br>You realize he couldn't just fuck off from the Marines as a VA right? That's why he left them with Dadan.</br></br>  <br>not taking your grandson with you in a marine academy and making him the strongest fucker in the sea</br>  I hated that the gas wasn't letal and the background nameless characters survived that shit. Takes away all the big deal that was made around the poison.<br><br>The samurai should have survived the poison using his clothing power by creating a special breathing suit. It would show simply and effectively that his fruit doesn't suck and wouldn't ruin the whole "that poison is super dangerous" plot.</br></br>  <br>That's probably what he tried with dragon and he ended up with his own son being the main enemy of the organization he had served for years.</br>  <br>I'm surprised Garp didn't take Luffy's strawhat and hulk smashed it to the ground, does he even know that strawhat is Shank's?</br>  <br><br>He would certainly know it resembles Roger's (unless he didn't fight him when he wore it - he changed to the 'Captain' design later)</br></br>  even fodder marines realize how much of a whiteknight retard sanji is<br><br>i hope he gets an okama mode power up that allows him to attack women</br></br>  <br>Perhaps his niche can be his salvation if crancked up to eleven. We have seen seastone clouds in Skypea, Smoker could get a new attack involving him smoking a seastone particled cigar and becoming a seacloud man for a while, making df users breathe his smokes to poison their lungs and render their df useless until the body gets rid of the metal.</br>  <br>That's not it, it's the fact that when he discovered a slave trade shop he just laughed it off because Rayleigh was there.</br>  <br>This.He should've known since he was roger's rival.I'm sure he'd notice that he wore a strawhat all the time, and alter on his apprentice wore it.</br>  <br>it seems like only roger pirates really know that the hat was rogers hat.<br><br>whitebeard didnt give any impression of knowing it was rogers, when he saw luffy he thought of shanks</br></br></br>   oda   FUCK THIS SHIT I CAN'T KEEP HAVING THESE LAME DAYS  <br>That's retarded, the cigar would also render his own DF useless.</br>   zzcartoon.com/videos/very-big-cock-<wbr>fucks-teen-girl-in-her-small-mouth.<wbr>html</wbr></wbr>   <br> implying anyone would click on that </br>  <br>Post it the next time Rebeccafag is in the thread.</br>  <br>Im correcting Kissanime to Kissmanga. What's the problem? Besides, retardism is a lot of fun, you get away with tonnes of shit.</br>  <br>It's worth it to see burgess' face near the end</br>  <br> that Texas handwash by doffy <br><br>Fifty keks</br></br></br>  <br><br>I feel like im missing out on something, shame my roomamtes here</br></br>  <br>The anon you quoted first was obviously trolling the bait.</br>  <br>Wapol.</br>  <br>Yes, this would be a doble-edge sword. He would need to pass/drop the seastone particles before he gets too weared off by them. I don't remember however how much seastone you need to be in contact with to render one's fruit useless, but If the particles are scarced trough his body maybe he could be able to pull that off at the cost of self inducing stress.</br>  <br>PH had a great setting, but it wasn't used very well. Instead of having a good use of both ice and fire, Oda opted to do the beginning in the fire, and most of the arc in the snow (not even there, because they were in the lab), it would have been much more interesting with more exchange between the two halves of the island.<br><br>Apart from that, there was too much focus in little characters like the Yeti Cool Brothers, the dragons, Brownbeard and the chimeras, the kids, and it all felt very disjointed. It didn't help that the "antagonists" from the arc weren't even an organization, but part from Doffy's crew with help from experiments (which sounds way more intersting than it was), with no intimidating and powerful antagonist.<br><br>Now, for the good parts, we had Law making a fantastic reappearance, Caesar was fun as a villain, Vergo was good too, SAD is an interesting concept, the dragon fight was fun, and the ending setting up the Doflamingo arc was just perfect.</br></br></br></br></br>  I still can't believe there are actual people out there who think Law is a top. He's a fucking tsundere for god's sake. Tsunderes don't top.  <br>are you gay or something?</br>  <br> implying we need to be told </br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GKf<wbr>AmJK2yO8</wbr>  [ ]  When was the last time Zoro struggled to win against his opponent?<br><br>I think it gets back to Mr1, he either lost or never really was on the verge of death since then.

What point are you trying to make?</br>  <br>Would say this is bait, but there is such a thing as a rebeccafag</br>  <br>why was the fight against Ryuuma a 'technical draw'?

They're pure shit</br></br></br></br>  The game's setting has huge potential to be really good in an anime format more so than God Eater. Plus if they took some liberties with the plot and everything it could turn out really great if handled right. I mean its a Dystopian setting where prisoners buy their years through missions. Fuck you can have a great dynamic between the MC and his accessory as they develop together. Also if they want the anime to have good sales they could have some accessories as idols. Like for instance this trailer that promoted the game.<br><br>http://<span>youtu.be/NTZ9hvOYHBQ  [ ]<br><br>The game sold really well second behind God Eater, so what's to say the anime won't do well if handled competently by a good staff. This series screams for an anime and a good one.<br><br>Now I really want an anime adaption of Freedom Wars by a competent staff.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Haruhi is now adapted by SHAFT and the Monogatari series is now adapted by KyoAni. What would improve or worse in either of these shows?  <br>Haruhi would improve. Monogatari would immediately die on arrival. <br><br>We already saw how well Monogatari-killer fared and if that is any indication then yeah, KyoAni would fuck it up.</br></br></br>  KyoAni would destroy the monogatari series.  <br>What was Monogatari killer?</br>  <br>KnK/ Kyoukai no Kanata.</br>  <br>Oh shit I literally forgot that existed</br>  <br>It was incredibly forgettable. KyoAni fans were so hyped for it and it just fell flat. <br>Monogatari is a giant compared to what KyoAni is shitting out. <br><br>Between Madoka and Monogatari, KyoAni would have to bust out the rest of Haruhi and give it flawless execution to even stand a chance.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Monogatari would immediately die on arrival. <br> KyoAni would destroy the monogatari series. <br>Would it really?<br>I mean KyoAni isn't really focused on story intensive shows and neither is Monogatari.<br>Maybe it would work.</br></br></br></br></br>  All the males in Monogatari would be more fuckable and Haruhi would have been a slideshow with interspersed short bursts of original creativity and random animated bullshit in the background to the stillframe main characters.  <br>Didn't monogatari already have a novel base, if kyo ani adapted it could have still had a chance</br>  <br><br>Monogatari only works as an anime because SHAFT is doing it. <br>KyoAni doesn't do visuals interesting enough to keep up with what NisiO is shitting out in the dialogue.<br>Monogatari is the epitome of once-in-a-generation luck. If any other company had gotten their hands on it, they wouldn't have just gone so straight off the deep end and still make it work.</br></br></br></br>  <br> All the males in Monogatari would be more fuckable <br>MORE you say?<br><br>Dayum</br></br></br></br>   monogatari with KyoAni <br> araragi is a virgin and not dating anyone <br> fanservice cutoff <br>No thanks.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;fanservice cutoff <br> kyoani <br><br>hello?</br></br></br></br>  <br>If kyoani saw the director was going with the words words words approach, with no scene variations surely they would have changed something. There is the problem of when bakemonogatari aired though, Kyoani style is a little different now then back then</br>  I would rather have DEEN or Gonzo to continue those series instead of them switching with each other  <br>Characters would stay on model if Monogatari was adapted by Kyoani.</br>  <br>Even if they changed something. They wouldn't have even gotten close to what SHAFT did with Monogatari visually. <br>SHAFT just straight up isn't following the rules.</br></br>  <br>yeah</br>  WHat if TRIGGER made MEGUCA?  What would do worse?<br><br>Kyoani Monogatari? Or SHAFT K-On?</br></br>  <br>Well, Satelight did the bottom one, and you could make the argument that the difference between the first two was attributable to production quality between a tv series and a feature movie</br>  <br>Haruhi by SHAFT...<br>Jesus christ, just thinking about it is giving me an erection. <br>SHAFT's surreal style would be perfect with haruhi, and Kyon's monologue in SHAFT style would be GOAT</br></br></br>  <br>Probably SHAFT K-on. KyoAni Monogatari could at least rely on the source material being good. <br>SHAFT wouldn't have that luxury.</br></br>  <br>It would be shit</br>  <br>third one is not kyoanus but compared to what shaft generally pulls, kyoanus tend to be more consistent with their art.</br>  <br> the top is from broadcast <br> the middle is from the movie and is an alternate Haruhi <br> the bottom isn't even KyoAni <br><br>0/10 see me after class.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have a feeling SHAFT K-On would be like Koufuku Graffiti. Subpar, to say the least.</br>  <br> shit </br>  <br>You know White Fox did the superior Gatari adaptation right? And you know SZS is the pinnacle of Shinbou's art direction right? Because implying that Monogatari won't work in any other studio is essentially a stupid thing to say.</br>  <br> shaft inserts Ohtsuki Kenji as original character club teacher who sings as lead <br> K-On! suddenly has good music and becomes watchable </br></br>  <br> nosebleed <br><br>Fuck you and you're waifu.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you saying Katanagatari had a lot more dialogue and less imagery compared to Monogatari?</br>  <br> you're waifu <br>what</br></br>  <br> you're <br> your <br>America everybody</br></br></br>  <br>Kyon.<br>Neck-tilt.<br>Facepalm.</br></br></br>  <br>katanagatari looks like a cartoon network show.<br><br>It looks like Johnny Bravo.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br><br>it's a meme you dip</br></br>  <br>Newfags everybody</br>  <br><br>I meant none of them are my waifu</br></br>  <br>I'm not seeing the issue here. What exactly is off-model about that? Is it the chin?</br>  <br> implying Katana and Mono are the same beast. </br>  I'd love to see Haruhi reimagined by Shaft.<br>I guess their take on Kyon would be completely different.<br><br>...not too sure about Monogatari by KyoAni. Would probably turn out boring.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Yeah, now you try to fix it.<br>get out fag.</br></br>  <br>Disappearance Haruhi is fucking cute.</br>  <br>No it wouldn't. katana worked because it had more fights and stuff to show, while having 45 minutes to do it well with quality animation.<br>try comparing it with the first 2 bake episodes: it's just 2 people talking for 48 minutes</br></br>  <br><br>Friendly reminder to lurk moar.<br> "You're waifu" has been a meme on /a/ for years<br>Welcome to the chans m8s, good on you to get off the sinking ship called reddit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I just said that the way Katanagatari was the best anime of the 2. White Fox actually did a great job on it and had sone creativity instead of just having Watanabe design cute characters and throw in the Shinbou direction.</br>  <br>who said anything about leaving I like both places</br>  <br> Implying they are not. <br>Nisio's writing is the same across the both. And it is the selling point of both series. So in my opinion WF did the better Nisio anime.<br>I mean Hanamonogatari exists. And if that isn't enough to dissuade you I don't know what will.</br></br></br>  <br>If you still think reddit is ok, go to /pol/ until you understand where you went wrong in life.</br>  <br>wait katana is written by nisio?</br>  <br>We'll have to just agree to disagree on this. We're too diametrically opposed to come to any sort of agreement on this.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>you are seriously telling me that there's people out there who thinks KnK would be a Monogatari killer?. Like, really?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw </br>  <br>They called it that. It fell flat.</br>  <br>Rules are needed if you want a meaningful exchange of opinions/information.<br>If there is no one in control there is no possible conversation. It'll be like /b/ 1000 times worse.</br></br>  <br>Hanamonogatari was dope, faggot.</br>  <br> if you want a meaningful exchange of opinions/information. <br>I'm just here for the memes tbh<br><br>smh</br></br></br></br>  <br>that's ok too, but that's exactly why I need both sites.</br>  <br><br><br>actually it would have a whole lot more foot fetish than it already has. And damn, how I'd love that.</br></br></br>  <br> Hanamonogatari  <br> Not an embarrassment for the source material by Nisio and the whole Monogatari series. <br>You have a serious case of shittaste anon.</br></br></br>  <br> KyoAni adapts Monogatari <br> zero fanservice of best girls <br>Nope.</br></br></br>  <br>The ability to discuss without being labled a "racist" and consequently having facts you prove rejected on only the grounds that they are "racist" does not make for a meaningful exchange of opinions. <br>Anyone can sort through a mess of posts looking for useful and relevant information, nobody can help someone who refuses to learn because it makes them feel better about themselves to be ignorant.</br></br>  <br> Considering Hanamono bad <br><br>Kill yourself please</br></br></br>  why no one likes her?   Just started Steins;Gate <br> CERN, IBM 5100, John Titor, etc <br> All this shit is based on shit that actually happened <br><br>What the fuck this anime is trippy as hell.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;All this shit is based on shit that actually happened <br>You mean going to happen</br></br>  <br>woah.</br>  <br> John Titor isn't real </br>  <br>This. Titor is a fraud.</br>  <br>Didn't he make some accurate predictions though?<br><br> And did anyone use his tripcode lately? </br></br></br>  <br>One could argue that he came from a timeline in which those events did transpire, but our timeline managed to avoid those through some major branches.</br>  Just finished watching Steins;Gate today, OP. Great series, you'll enjoy it.  Thoughts on this chapter?  So no one reads this shit?  <br>You'll have to be patient. There's something like 5 Kingdom fans on /a/ and they're in different timezones.</br>  Well, I have got nothing to say as usual.  Yotanwa is hot.  <br>Not this chapter but I knew Zheng wasn't gonna kill those kids.</br>  <br>I'm waiting for at least 20 chapters to stack, last I read was when Shin saved his waifu.</br>  <br>Well, it was great. I dunno why, but the way Ryofui lost left me very unsatisfied. I guess I expected his keikkaku to be more impressive than that.</br>  I don't see how Shin could possibly become part of Qin's six great generals, although I know he will because plot. So either some of the current top notch generals will die in battle in the meantime, or there will be an asspull.  <br>tou will decline to be one and someone, probably moubu will die before the generals are named. I doubt that shin and the other 2 will be left out.</br>  <br>He lied. Afterall queen mother will suicide in a few years.</br>  <br>Not in this manga.</br>  <br>Come on I fucking hope he lied.<br> muh motherly love <br>Kids got to go.</br></br></br>  <br>Just wait for her to find out her kids got killed and she suicides in the manga too.</br>  <br>Have even been reading this manga? It's too out of character for him. If they die, someone else ordered it.</br>  <br>While I see where you are cming from, I do not agree fully. I can see very well his gaze shining in a colder, more metallic way than before.<br>It could be good character development.</br></br>  <br> Moubu <br> dead <br>Pretty sure Moubu will stay all the way to endgame.</br></br></br>  Who the fuck cares about the queen mother ? She is one of the most irrelevant characters.  <br>Moubu is ugly. Plus, he's a no brainer. I hope he dies.</br>  <br>Moubu will survive at least all the invasion, read prequel.</br>  <br>Pretty much everyone in Kingdom is ugly. That's why it's so fucking raw.</br>  Why would the queen of another state become a Great General of Qin<br><br>Isn't Qin going to swallow up them too to unify China? Why would she ally with Sei</br></br>  <br>Because she wants her people to be able to expand their borders, and Sei is offering to do it for them if they help.

Sakura is easily the most insufferable cunt that I've ever seen in anime.</br>  Bam, thread over and we can all go home.<br><br>And leave Sakura alone, she already knows she's terrible since she's taking care of her husband's kid by some other bitch.</br></br>  Literally every tsundere main girl in a generic harem. <br><br>Bonus points if they're flat and voiced kugimiya rie.</br></br>  <br> you're waifu <br>Fixed that for you.</br></br>  <br> You have 10 seconds to name a girl from anime that's worse than Pinkshit from Naruto. <br><br>Why would you start the thread with possibly the worst character in the history of anime/manga that even the author hates?</br></br></br>    <br>  </br>  I would argue Flay Allster from Gundam SEED. She was a completely manipulative slut who used Jesus Yamato's feelings for her to get revenge. Arguably her actions did actually help move the plot along. Still, a total whore.  This little cuntmuffin.  <br>Kishimoto actually likes her, he just can't write women so they don't come out as dumb cunts. All good females in Naruto are good because he didn't pay attention to them.</br>  <br>Flay is so fucking terrible i had actually purged her from my memory until just now.</br>  <br/>  <br>Would you not cum on her forehead?</br>  <br>No. I would shoot it with a gun.</br>  <br>Kishi reached a point where even he himself had realized that he had fucked up with Sakura's character and publicly admitted that she's "a horrible person", at which point he began upgrading Hinata to become more of the lead heroine in the series.</br>  <br> saying no to this <br><br>You're probably as much of a faggot as Sasuke.</br></br></br>   anyone shittier than pinkshit <br><br>nobodies more terrible than sakura. she fails more on parenting than sasuke</br></br>  <br>I'd rather say yes to this titfucking Hinata.<br><br>Also, calling Sasuke a faggot is an insult to people who really are gay.<br><br>Sasuke is just asexual and not to mention a complete autist.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Uh yeah we mention worse girl all the time, you're Just new</br>  <br>What I mean is that we don't shame worst girls as often as we should.</br>  Too easy    <br>Karin is not the mother</br>  <br>Sure you would but I didn't give you a choice.<br><br>If you wouldn't fuck Sakura, you're probably a faggot. She's sexy as fuck.</br></br></br>  Haven't kept up with Naruto ever since the main-manga ended. Is The Last finally out in good quality?  <br>Two days 'til Jap BD. Expect a high quality rip + subs shortly after.</br>  <br> the Nurutu movie will get subs before the Psycho-Pass movie </br>  <br>Karin is hotter and even Sauce agree.</br>  <br> &gt;the Nurutu movie will get subs before the Psycho-Pass movie <br>Obviously since the Nurutu movie already have official subs.</br></br>   naruto   <br>I've started watching it.<br>So far she seems like a bothersome cunt but I actually dislike Hinata more.<br>She's just "Oh look so shy uguu".<br>At least at this point.<br>Sasuke hasn't went full edgelord as everyone says yet.<br>Also didn't expect to like Rock Lee.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> watching Naruto </br>  <br>I played the Ultimate Storm game and the animations and shit looked really interesting.<br>Its not as bad as I thought so far.<br>I hear it really goes to fucking shit though; especially when it hits shippuden.</br></br></br>  <br>this manhating cunt right here</br>   tries to kill literally everybody   <br>Junko tried to kill literally everybody. Aoi just let herself become a pawn. Her DR2 counterpart really is worst girl though.</br>  this cum guzzling little slut  <br>Reverse image search isnt giving me anything. who is she?</br>  <br> hating best girl <br><br>You should try to kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>Looks like a man.

Someone call the paramedics.</br>  <br><br>Misato is better than both</br></br>  <br>Kishi probably read a poll and realize how popular was Sasusaku. Japan's national motto is "if ain't broken, don't fix it". Some may say that Kishi gave so much importance to Sasuke for the same reason but I think Kishi is genuinely in love of the sauce while he can't find a reason why Sakura loves Sasuke</br>  <br><br>See</br></br>  <br>she was always shit even with out sasuke she was a shit tsunderer trash</br>  <br>There is literally nothing wrong with Sakura except that they forgot to develop her character early on so she ended up being behind everyone else, which was unfixable without having a bunch of arcs dedicated to only developing her character, which of course they couldn't do since she wasn't popular as a MC type character like Naruto and Sasuke were. Just make her learn to be some kind of badass in some way early on, and suddenly the problem fixes itself for the entire rest of the show without even changing anything else</br>  ruined the fucking show  Pic related.<br>Literally the most autistic, pathetic and beta heroine I've seen in ages.</br>  <br>Sasuke is at least 90% of what is wrong with Sakura. Both her bitchiness towards Naruto and her general uselessness can be attributed to her obsession with him</br>  <br> liking a slut who admits she sleeps around cause she doesn't like to be cold in bed,so she seeks out warmth from other people bodies, and likes to fill the hole of emptiness with sex </br>  <br><br>How about:<br><br>Haru in Nisekoi<br>Manami in Oreimo<br><br>You litterally can't top this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hinata body is ruined by her terribad fashion sense.</br>  <br>Considering how many women can relate to Sakura and root for sasusaku, I think Kishi did something right</br>  <br>Early/mid-shippuuden (with the Hidan and Kakuzu fight, Sasuke and Itachi fight, Pain vs Jiraiya and Naruto vs Pain) is the peak of the Naruto series though. At that point it's legitimately fucking amazing.<br><br>Other than that it's mostly garbage.</br></br></br>  <br>She's delicious brown though. You can't hate delicous brown.</br>  <br>The real problem is that she does not possess an actual character, any ideas behind who she is besides Kishi's idea of an average girl who eventually had Tsunade's moveset grafted onto her.<br><br>I wouldn't even mind her being a cunt all that much if people called her out on her. Part 2 ino would have been a great opportunity, someone who now gets on well with her team, is a good coordinator and unlike Pinkshit seems to have developed, if offscreen, from the shallow fangirl that both she and Sakura were in Part 1. Maybe make Sakura realise that despite having been granted powers solely on the grounds that she was the third wheel of muh Team 7, she is nowhere near as effective team member as her rival is. Bam, development.<br>Instead, even when Naruto calls her bullshit confession, he only tells her that she is lying to herself as well as him, rather than outright telling her to stop presuming the world revolves around her.<br><br>Hell, maybe do something with the whole illusion angle she was stated to be good at instead of the medical stuff that makes her butthurt over not grabbing the limelight every single fight she's in, and throw in some more clever, basic stuff with tools as opposed to the divine gift her (ex) team members were using all the fucking time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They just want to fuck Sasuke themselves</br>  <br>Being cute but having no flair for fashion and hiding her assets behind comfortable clothing was a core element of her character, and it is a nice detail about her.</br>  <br> She'll be badass in my private headcanon. </br>  <br>They actually hate Sakura too, just like they hate themselves.</br>  <br>Got dang</br>  <br> muh cute and shy moeblob <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a charm point I say. Naruto isn't known for his good fashion sense either.</br>  <br>10/10 should have been the lean, well-built action girl.<br>Sakura's thing actually works by magic manipulation, not through muscles. The pic's nice, but all it has in common with Pinkshit is the colour of her hair.</br></br>  <br>At least she snapped Naruto out of quitting. Sakura on the other hand couldn't go through with doing anything to Sasuke. Even Naruto who was also a big doormat concerning Sasuke was at least willing to trade blows with the guy.</br>  <br>Horrible NTRing bitch</br>  <br> one thinks wearing horrible neon orange tracksuits is a sensible idea for a ninja <br> the other does not give a single fuck about fashion or prettying herself up as she's got a case of single target sexuality and does not want to attract anyone else <br> the two have a /fa/ as fuck son <br>That's actually pretty fun.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She only fucked Kaji</br>  <br> Hur dur there's nothing wrong with Sakura except she never developed and stayed the same as she was in chapter 1, that is an unlikable cunt. <br><br>Sakura up until Shippuden was popular with Japnese fans, but she kept disappointing them and so they gave up on her.</br></br></br>  <br>Most women actually hate Sakura, its only the loud ones you hear a lot but even tumblr the females who like her and Sasuke are actually in the minority.</br>  <br>Not saying that Sakura is any better, but Hinata is a boring doormat character also. Hinatafags are also the worse there is.</br>  <br>She was a cunt sure, but she had an interesting character arc. When she died, the tone of the original show died with her and paved way for the less dark and more kid friendly turd known as Gundam Seed Destiny. I am not saying Seed was a masterpiece, but it sure as hell was better than Destiny.</br>  <br>Isn't that literally what I just said? They didn't develop her enough, so she became unpopular. Maybe she was more popular at the start with Japanese fans than she was with American fans (because Americans are obsessed with feminism and Japanese people aren't as much), but the actual lack of development was still the problem regardless</br>  <br>Sakurafags only care about the fanon version of her.</br>  <br>Not that guy, but what the fuck did she even do in part 1 to get popular in the first place?<br> dramatic haircut that achieved nothing <br> mutual knockout in her one proper fight (and would have lost completely if not for magical multiple personality disorder), in all others just standing in the back with a kunai <br> jumps inbetween Nardo and Sausage launching their most powerful attacks at each other, by all rights the point where she should have died </br></br></br></br>  <br>This. People act as if hinata is the best female in the series because of "muh naruto". She's better than sakura but that doesn't say much and hinata is basically a doormat as you said.</br>  <br>She drives? weren't they supposed to be high school freshmen/juniors? I don't know myself, but I doubt Japanese driver's license is for people under 18.</br>  <br>Gundam SEED Destiny never happened.</br>  fact:Yostuba is the worst girl in the series<br>fact:Fuuka is the best girl</br>  <br>I agree with <br><br>I think it's totally fine that she was obsessed with Sasuke at first. Damn, I'm even okay with her staying that way until meeting again with Sasuke in part two. It's pretty psycho that way but it would have worked if she were allowed to move on. Instead she's emotional garbage.<br><br>Her skillset has been worse than Naruto's since the beginning of part 2. As it's a battle shounen, this is the biggest insult.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Get advertised a lot. Have slutty pink hair.</br>  <br> but Hinata is a boring doormat character <br><br> is perfectly aware of her main character flaw and her foremost goal is to correct it and become a better person <br> fights Neji who does everything she can but better and then some, he takes his sweet time as he picks her motivations, beliefs and sense of self apart, psychoanalyzing her to hell and back, yet she stubbornly refuses to yield, standing up time and time again <br> is willing to stand up to a living god who just nuked her hometown to protect the man she loves, declaring her feelings and overcoming her greatest fault <br> when said man is in his lowest point she slaps some sense into him, and rallies him as well as the whole army <br><br>Those are just the most obvious points. It is okay to not like Hinata, but form a criticism of her that is actually true as she's not a doormat. Gentle, kind, reserved, even demure, perhaps, but that is a far cry from being a doormat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shut up fag</br>  <br>don't forget she ripped a mans eyes off</br>  It was only a matter of time.  <br>I was thinking more about her characterization within the main series.<br>You are right, though, she gets some good stuff in the Last. Plucking her sister's eyes right out of her captor's skull while he screams for mercy was pretty neat.</br></br>  <br>All of these are typical waifubait traits for self-insert fags. <br><br>I bet you think Onodera and Kobeni are well written characters too.</br></br></br>  <br>The question at hand isn't about whether the character is written well. This is fucking Naruto we are talking about, nothing really lives up to any proper standards of quality.<br>The question was whether the character in question is a doormat, like you said she was. I have demonstrated that she is not.</br></br>  <br>Just read the manga if you're gonna pick up Naruto. Studio Pierrot fucking sucks.</br>  <br>No one except Kakashi is well written in Naruto.</br>  <br>Just admit you don't like Hinata because of her personality and just leave it like that.</br>  <br>Keep with the games, even Kishi said they are the best way to enjoy the story.</br>  <br><br>shut up.</br></br>  <br>Jiraiya has his moments, when Kishi isn't trying to rip off/reference Master Roshi with him.</br>  <br>Jaraiya?</br>  <br>It's weird because she both made the show better and worse. Yui needed a foil like Mio was to Ritsu and Yui and Mugi had zero chemistry with each other. Seriously, the group is dull as fuck without Azusa, she may be a nagging no fun allowed bitch, but she makes the show less dull even though she is annoying a lot of the time. She makes it better because my dick.</br>  <br>Muh naruto.</br>  <br><br>and shw was a doormat how?</br></br>  <br>To bad she's actually completely fucking useless in combat.</br>  <br><br>Yeah he has his moments too.</br></br>    <br>Except she isn't. Naruto and Sakura are bigger doormats than her.</br>  <br>I agree it was fine in the beginning. If it was any other story I would say you're supposed to not like Sakura then, but Kishimoto seems to think MUH SASUKE is romantic.<br><br>The worst part is that she WAS getting some development but she regressed back to her former self because Kishi couldn't come up with a plausible reason why she would love Sasuke.</br></br></br>  <br>Only if you're a faggot to let someone's personal choice in fashion cock block you.<br><br>Literally no fucks given to yourself I suppose.</br></br></br>  <br>Sakura was hated from the very beginning. Especially by female readers, which is ironic since Kishi wrote Sakura with a female audience in mind. Kishi publicly admitted that making Sakura was a mistake.</br>  <br>That was one of the most endearing moments in the manga. Hinata wanted no more of Naruto's doom and gloom. That was not what she saw in him, and that is not what she fell in love with.</br>  <br>At least with Naruto it is justified in that he had the bad luck of having made his first friendship with Sausage after 12 years of being a hated/feared pariah with low self esteem, no social skills who was incredibly lonely, and they even started to develop an actual friendship/rivalry thing. <br>It's still fucked up and turns incredibly gay without Kishi even meaning to make it so, but from with a character who has massive abandonment issues I could see him imprinting on the idea of being best friends with an edgy murderous crazy bastard and carrying on with that idea to an irrational degree.<br><br>Sakura just wanted to fuck him because all the girls wanted to too, possibly also because he's a handsome bad guy later on.<br>The one good thing is that once she did get around to breeding with him no one else wanted to, having found better people they cared about on a personal level and everyone but her found happiness.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking this. Hinata was truly best girl and she deserved to win the Narubowl.</br>  <br> Kishi publicly admitted that making Sakura was a mistake <br>I fucking despise her character, but you gotta drop some sauce for that to be believed.</br></br>    <br>Sakura would've been a better character if she just given up on sauke like ino did in part two. She doesn't necessary need to be with naruto but find someone else besides sasuke and show some character development. In the end she just became a stupid bitch who fucked a guy who tried to kill her at least twice or more.</br>  <br>She was a doormat character up until she confessed her love to Naruto. Fighting Neji didn't remove that doormat characteristic of her considering she was mostly trying to defend ''muh Nuruto's beliefs''. It took I don't know how many chapters for her to stop being a doormat so at this point, even though you're not for the last 10 chapters, you're still known as the doormat character.<br><br><br>Do you even know what a doormat is, you fucking retard?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> this thread <br> 0 pictures of Kirino <br> cntl-f kirino <br> 0 results <br> yet this image is posted <br><br>You've changed, /a/. I expected Kirino spam in this thread. I am proud of you. Manami a shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ino or Lee could have both been candidates, bot both deserve to have someone better thank Pinkshit.</br>  <br>Temari?Tsunade?Kushinu?<br>How was hinata best girl?<br>Could care less about the narutobowl because she was the only one in it.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you OP. This is literally waifuwars: the thread</br>  <br>Any girl from Sword Art Online.</br>  <br><br>The fuck even are you talking about? Hinata was fighting for herself, to prove that she changed against Neji.<br><br>Neji told her to forfeit several times but she didn't not because to defend Naruto's beliefs, to defend herself. Naruto simply inspired her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>To keep a figure that thick, and healthy you need an appetite to support it.</br>  <br>Sasusaku recently won an internet poll as the best couple. Also, nurutu isn't precisely the kind of TV show that attract a sophisticated audience</br>  <br> Fighting Neji didn't remove that doormat characteristic of her considering she was mostly trying to defend ''muh Nuruto's beliefs''. <br>She stood up for herself and the things she believed in. She was completely outclassed and already beaten, but called Neji out on his bullshit to a degree that it turned a feasible opportunity to belittle her and show off into getting told hard enough to make him lose his cool and attempt to fucking murder her right there.<br>Having been inspired by the MC to aspire to her goals does not change that she is not a doormat.<br><br>Her previous appearances before that were as a productive team member, someone skilled at academics or spying with her Byakugan and as a person willing to take a risk for someone whom she cared for. That was the lowest, most passive state and the earliest bit of her character arc we have seen her in, when she had trouble looking people in the eye.<br><br>As I said, it is okay to not like quiet and reserved, nice characters. But you don't need to pull unfounded bullshit out of your ass to support that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>* she didn't forfeit. and not to defend Naruto's beliefs, to defend herself.<br><br>Naruto's nindou simply inspired her.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>it was a rigged poll. ssfags on tumblr spammed the poll.</br></br>  <br>Even though lee showed much affection to sakura and went through shit in the chunin exam for her she still didn't love him. Don't know what she sees in sasuke. Sakura has been ignored by sauke throughout most of the series yet she still loves him. Her relationship with sasuke is the biggest reason why people hate her guts. There is no real reason for her to love sasuke so much.</br>  <br> Caring about internet polls <br><br>You are this retarded.</br></br></br>  <br> internet poll <br>And which internet poll was that?</br></br>  Takiko from Tokyo Ravens  <br>Most of these faggots don't read the manga anyway. Only known because of memers. I wouldn't be surprised.</br>  <br> Even though lee showed much affection to sakura and went through shit in the chunin exam for her she still didn't love him. <br>Eh, she's a cunt but it's ardly fair to expect her to just will herself to feel shit she does not. She clearly developed a degree of respect/affection for the guy, just not romantically.<br>Now if she actually questioned herself on what does it say about her, liking a guy who tolerates her at best and shunning others who stood up for her, even burning bridges of friendship for him, maybe she would not be as completely shit a character as she ended up as.</br></br></br>  <br>God, the first part of Naruto was so good.</br>  <br>Rock Lee is "ugly" compared to the prodigy Edgelord. Most woman in manga are portrayed to be pretty shallow. Mainly because they are written by dudes to appeal to little boys.</br>  <br> The one good thing is that once she did get around to breeding with him no one else wanted to <br>Karin wanted. Probably Ino too, considering she married Sai aka Sasuke's poor man</br></br>  <br>Yeah that's when the series naruto was at its best.</br>  <br>Female readers support their shallowness though. Read shoujo and watch K-drama</br>  <br>I just had a thread about her on /r/anime.<br>Naruto is the best anime.</br></br>  <br> Most woman in manga are portrayed to be pretty shallow. Mainly because they are written by dudes to appeal to little boys. <br>That's actually a great life lesson to teach little boys. Act like an edgelord and treat girls like shit and you'll have them on your cock. Act like a good guy and they'll friendzone you the rest of your life.<br><br>Kishimoto is actually a genius.</br></br></br></br>    <br>It works on every female-aimed media</br>  <br>Rock lee was a pretty good character back in the day</br>  <br>If you truly played the games then you should know how terrible Sakura is.</br>  <br><br> Naruto <br> best anime <br><br>And I bet that Sakura is your waifu, too<br><br>Fuck off back to Reddit, faggot. And take your troll bait with you, too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rock Lee and Gai were cringy as fuck, bitches don't like that, and certainly the prom queen of bitches Sakura didn't like that.<br><br>Shit Sakura reminds me of those girls who were always on the bad guy's dick and then end up with three children and a guy who beats her shit for not being young</br></br></br>  <br>sakura is shit in any way possible</br>  Narutards really are desperate.<br><br>Everything to have a thread I guess.</br></br>  <br>This. Sakura was a realistic bitch. The problem is how Kishi refused to write Naruto accordingly. No one admires a loser emasculated Nice Guy who lets himself be abused by a cunt. Women aren't attracted to such loser men and men don't want to be the guy who gets beat up by twats (which explains why only masochist losers like harem protagonists).</br>  All the bossy little meganekko bitches who turned out the way that they did because they have to wear glasses. I have yet to see an actually badass meganekko who isn't a total pretentious bitch or a clueless airhead. If someone can suggest me one I'll give you a cookie :D  Don't make challenges you can't win.  <br>Lee was just as bad. Especially since his dream still had him fucking Sakura.</br>  <br>To be fair now it's realistic. Women DON'T like Nice Guys. They don't get moist or turned on by such decent men. Only men respect Nice Guys and see them as stable individuals. But pussy? Pussy ain't getting tingles for Nice Guys so there you go.<br><br>If anything the best type of protagonists treat females poorly or are asexual. Shame that when it comes to asexual male characters in anime the cliche is retards like Luffy.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128351882 <br>I don't remember Sakura abusing Naruto that much though. You sure you are not confusing SP fillershit with her? She only hit him like three times early on and then once after the timeskip out of 700 chapters.</br>  <br>Women don't care about Nice guys or bad guys. They just care about resources. You need resources to get a girl.</br>  This dipshit. Right here.  <br>The best male character in Naruto was Shikamaru because he seriously reflects the current cultural values of young men in Japan. Meaning he finds pussy too much trouble/work to be worthwhile. Didn't his ideal dream involve the same simple life he was already leading under Madara's genjutsu?</br>  <br>You never heard of Alpha Fucks &amp; Beta Bucks? Thugs, cads, assholes, etc type of men generally have an easy time getting laid. Resources on the other hand are for the beta guys who are women's Plan B when they decide to settle down (meaning they get old to the point these alpha guys don't want them anymore and start going for the new crop of young women).<br><br>Having resources is just a sign of a man who women will parasite off of. And no, these women may use the resources to be provided for, but they do not love these men themselves. Just their provisions.</br></br></br>  <br>This.<br>But what gets on my nerves is when they start saying shit like "where are all the nice guys?", bitch, they are right there where you left them, in the friendzone.</br></br>  <br>Keeping her dangerous weapons concealed like a real ninja.</br>  <br>The typical shoujo fantasy is an irredemeable asshole who happen to be rich and the best at sports and grades without even trying</br>  <br>Not only do they leave them in the friendzone, but a saying that's catching on nowadays is:<br><br>"You left them in your early 20s."<br><br>Because let's face it, long term commitment is for the young and ignorant male. The longer a man grows into being single the less likely he'll have an interest in the rotten deal that is cohabitation/marriage. Ideally men want to experience the opposite sex when young because the thought of doing it when he's in his 30s with a woman who is ALSO in her 30s is a huge turn off as the woman is no longer at her prime.<br><br>There's a reason the saying "Men age like wine, but women age like milk" exists. It's damn true. No man wants a woman that is old, especially when you consider that a woman in today's world who is past her 20s has likely slept around and has been pumped and dumped by many other cocks making her sexual value zilch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Most rich men are assholes. If not all. You have to step over people to remain or stay rich after all.</br>  <br>She's not a doormat. That's just how fillers portray her because they go lowest common denominator.</br>  <br>True but not precisely the kind of asshole women dig</br>  <br>I'm going by the manga not the fillertarded anime.</br>  <br>Pussy tingles for dominant males who are strong, some kind of instinct for creating stronger offspring perhaps?<br><br>Most of them just tend to be assholes to girls. If they're not then they tend to fall into to many cliches like this dude</br></br></br>  <br>this pink shit. good god was she awful.</br>  If women dig assholes, why anons can't get laid? 4chan is full of assholes  <br>Does Salad count?</br>  <br>And for what it's worth, it's a bit shocking to see how many rich men even now still get raped in divorce. A fool and his money are soon parted.<br><br>It's especially shocking when said rich men divorce repeatedly like that actor John Cleese (got reamed in divorce 4 times) and now is truly broke. Then there are other sad stories like Robin Williams who everyone knows could not retire because of alimony payments, poor abused old dog ultimately killed himself because of parasite ex-wives.</br></br></br>  <br>because we are too sad. We have no lives. We have to fap to lolis instead. Lolis are the exception. Lolis dig Onii-chans, not assholes.</br>  <br>I don't know about John Cleese but Robin Williams was a junkie. His multiple marriages were just a sympton of his fucked up mind</br>  <br>those fucking whores</br>  <br> im a fucking retarded midget who loves to be abused </br>  <br> Haru in Nisekoi <br><br>Ayane Sakura in charge of voicing annoying tsungires.png</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah Robin Williams was always too fucking high to think about things straight<br><br>He shoulda married cocaine</br></br></br>  <br>Ssfags voted for them and other people voted for them out of spite. Both characters are so terrible that they deserve nothing else but each other so that that level of shit could be contained.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure other people vote for Naruhina or their OTP rather than waste a vote on 2 characters they hate. Is it really that hard to believe? Women love crap like Hana Yori Dango and Itazura na kiss. The latter is still an abusive relationship even after marriage</br>  <br>Not really. Kishi did say a little girl came up and told him she hated Sakura. She was definitely not alone in that opinion.</br>  <br>I think anon means that people who for one reason or another were not happy with NH voted for SS as a protest.<br>I still think giving opinion polls and voting about non-concrete issues is fucking retarded.</br></br>  <br>Eh. Bad boys are definitely more attractive to most women but you have to draw the line when they try to murder you or if they are apathetic or condescending to your entire existence. <br>It's okay to appreciate them from afar but don't try to get into a relationship with someone who fully intended to kill you. That should go without saying.</br></br>  <br>You haven't even given us the source on the poll. Furthermore It's an internet poll.</br>  <br>That little girl is still into prince charmings. Once the hormones kick, it's all about dreamy wife beaters and the prince charming degrade into a "nice guy"</br>  <br>It won because ssfags advertised the shit out of it and it's very popular on tumblr. <br>Did any of the other ships try to rally votes like that?</br></br>    <br>I don't really see why people do this shit at all. Their voting achieves exactly fuck all.</br>  <br>I rarely see any girl (or boy) who actually like Sakura unless they already ship SS. <br>That phase of liking abusive relationships is mostly contained to teenage fangirls. After that they will want a rich or handsome guy who treats them right and is good with kids. <br>Ugly nice guys who are poor are shit out of luck. It's for the best so they don't pass on their loser genes.</br></br></br>  <br>It's like a medal for them. Naruhinas would be obnoxious about it if their OTP won. Any shipperfag would. That's one of the reasons why shipping faggotry is cancer</br>  <br> After that they will want a rich or handsome guy who treats them right and is good with kids. <br> what's 50 Shades of Grey? <br> what's every Fabio-on-the-cover novel? </br></br></br>  <br>That's just how that fandom is. Since their ship is so hated they feel they have got something to prove. Winning a poll is like validation for them.<br>They could probably rally enough votes to say Sakura is the most beloved female character of all time, despite everyone knowing that is bullshit.</br></br>  <br><br>everyone in 11eyes</br></br>  <br>No I'm talking about people who hate Sasuke and Sakura and so would rather they be together rather than with a decent character.</br>  <br><br>I can't even imagine what it must be like to actually gleam a portion of your identity from wanting to Sri Lankan graffiti characters fuck, never mind who the actual characters are.<br>Just enjoy cute fanart on pixxiv and keep it at that, is that so fucking hard? Sakurafags tend to be women, who tend to be the most fanart-production prone, so I imagine there must be a fuckton.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit, yes. Everyone told me to watch Toradora because I enjoyed Clannad. I couldn't make it past episode 5 because I just couldn't handle her. She was too much of a bitch and Toradora wasn't even that good to me. The main character kept on stuttering every time someone talked to him and that was just annoying (at least in my opinion).</br></br>  <br>50 shades of Grey appeals to the teenage girl in women. But women don't want that shit in real life.</br>  Singlehandedly killed the whole show.  Elves are for ____?  Eating  brutal anal rape  We had this thread yesterday.

They're naturally proud and hateful of humans and therefore need to be taken down a notch. This doesn't mean just humans and an orc can be used instead to show her that she isn't so high and mighty as she imagined. <br><br>Half-elf: Meant for tender loving. Half elves receive little acceptance in human society since they're frequently mistaken for full elves and in most elf societies they're instantly killed or expelled for tainting the bloodline. All of these factors lead to the creation of a submissive but extremely cute girl who becomes loyal and loving the instant somebody shows her a shred of kindness after a lifetime of pain and suffering.<br><br>Dark-elf: It's a mixed bag. In some setting Dark elves are seen as domineering and even more xenophobic than white elves which means that instead of being raped, they're the ones to do the raping and frequently raid human travelers in order to secure husbands and rape victims. In other settings dark elves lie at the other end of the spectrum and are discriminated against even more than white elves for being brown-skinned as well as their long ears. In these cases their designated role should be housemaid that falls in love with her master and happily gives herself to him for being so kind where her previous masters abused her.<br><br>Dark-Half-Elf:Spunky tomboys who wear spats and fuck their childhood friends until their dicks start whistling.

High elves are the typical arrogant elf, like the one you describe. There's also wood elves, who are on the whole much friendlier to humans and the ones responsible for 90% of the half-elves.<br><br>Both have some overlapping features, but they are on the whole unique; most anime just combine the two. For example, the pure blooded elves in Zero no Tsukaima act a lot like high elves, with their incredibly arrogant attitude and condescending view of humanity. Wood elves are much friendlier to humans, but they are still arrogant: just about one thing. Probably their shooting skills. <br><br>Wood elves are nearly always archers, though they might have a bit of magic skill as well. Very skilled hunters and adept at roaming about the forest. High elves are far more likely to rely on spells to do the heavy lifting, but they sometimes uses bows as well if they can't spam spells.<br><br>Wood elves congregate in large forests so contact with humans is inevitable, the high elves use them as a buffer for their own cities far, far away from humans and even more isolated.<br><br>There's a shit ton of other elf types, Drows and Snow/Cave/Sea/Etc but those two I discussed often get mixed up and are the most common variety encountered.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>don't do it anon<br><br>it's NTR</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;An elf 165 years old, though is considered to be in her teens by her race's standards. </br>  <br>I am okay with this</br>    <br> Implying Dwarves aren't better <br>Can Elves hammer?

The entire scene is obnoxious, drags on too long, and blends as many cliches as possible into an episode.<br><br>So it's fine that no one really cares about editing subtitles to make sense in English.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then why did you steal his nose?</br>  <br>I couldn't stop laughing at the "That's bad sense" line.<br>What the fuck are the translators doing?

So basically his best stuff does not have baseball in it...<br><br>Angel Beats also had episode 4 as a baseball episode. Maybe they are just repeating the exact same formula and re-using old storyboards/etc?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rewrite isn't Maeda to begin with.<br><br><br>It's not exactly top notch dialogue or anything, but the Aniplex subs don't even speak like humans.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rewrite only had the main songs, with the theme/morale of the story it presented written by Maeda. The main writers were Romeo, Ryuukishi and Tonokawa. It did have soccer though.<br><br><br> hating on based Chibimoth <br>Over the line.</br></br></br></br></br>  Only the dead can know peace from this  pizza sauce   So I just watched episode 1, is there any other reason to watch this anime other than the imouto?  <br><br>Yeah, forgot about that. Still the only one where baseball was actually an important part of the story was Little Busters.</br></br>  <br>It's Jun Maeda 2015.<br>That alone should dictate whether you care or not.<br>If you don't know who that is, then try getting exposed to him for the first time.</br></br></br>  <br>This fluid druid</br>  <br>We're almost full, lads. <br><br>Atleast the animation's pretty, I guess.</br></br></br>  <br>Baseball worked really well in LB!, but mainly because the story was about friendship.<br>It seems they keep reusing it as a supposed winning formula.<br><br><br>Yuu starting to remember more and more, PTSD, distrusting everyone, scientists showing up in suits kidnapping students they saved (maybe imouto), school gets closed down. Yuu having a full on break down realizing something he didn't see before, after some creepy foreshadowing with a final twist. All while BGM similar to https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=75_<wbr>dkomdYlg</wbr>  [ ] plays. That would be the best possible episode, before the afterstory second half.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't Mr. Pillow count for trauma?</br>  <br>Better version if you want to redo it.</br>  <br>It's not clear yet. It could be that the special abilities just fry up people's brains before disappearing.</br>  <br>The free space could also just be "It's Terrible"</br>  <br><br>That's Trauma?<br><br>Chuuni fighting should be crossed off when You got his shit pushed in by the No-Fun-Allowed Police</br></br></br></br>  <br>Amnesia/memory loss works better. Shame we can't have both.</br>  baseball episodes are the equivalent of beach episodes for maeda.  <br>Are we allowed to cross off food of mass destruction? At most he's tired of pizza sauce.</br>  <br>I'm ok with that.</br>  <br>There are baseball references in the Kanon drama CD.</br>  <br>Makes me wonder if there's any baseball in Harvest Festa.. I know there's swimsuits.</br>  <br>There are mini games in it. There could be a baseball mini game for all we know.</br>  4th episode and probably still no explanation of how does the school works, how does it protect power users from "evil scientists", who is in charge whatsoever. I enjoy the character interaction and bit of SoL but where the fuck is my plot.  <br><br>TL soon. Maybe before EX is finished proofreading at this rate.<br><br><br>We should be in full swing by episode 6.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maeda said the plot will kick in at episode 6. I'm assuming shit is gonna go down and there's going to be a massive tone shift.<br><br><br> Imouto is only a plot tool to shift to a darker tone </br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't the translation for EX dead?</br>  <br>Amaterasu is a godsend. They translated Rewrite in less than a year, if I didn't recall wrong.</br>  <br>It's funny how obvious that is when you're a Maedafag. The question is how?<br/></br>  <br> yfw the school was created in order for Nao to round up all ability users in one place <br> yfw the scientists locked up all ability users they can laid their eyes on <br> yfw the main gang retreated to the hospital only to find out that the lone person Nao trusted is actually the mastermind behind all experimentation <br> yfw they ran back to grab the imouto only to find her already captured and locked up <br> yfw they have nowhere to run with government branding them as fugitive <br><br>enough suffering?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That they are. Too bad they only like Romeo.<br><br><br>99.58%<br>http://doki.co/visual-novels/little<wbr>-busters/<br>Click the document spreadsheet, website isn't updated for shit.<br><br><br>She either gets taken by scientists, or she's evil and implanted memories of herself into Yuu, while removing those of his brother. Or something in between like she gets kidnapped but has a dormant power, which she used in the past by accident.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sanic is killed while trying to distract the scientists.</br>  <br>Imouto has already developed a power, and her power is to make predictions by writing them with pizza ketchup on omurice.<br><br>Checkmate, atheists.</br></br></br>  <br> MC-kun depressed because of failing to protect imouto <br> Nao fucked with guilt <br> MC now hates Nao for what she did <br> Epic conclusion episode with a bunch of powerfags rioting against scientists <br><br>I can see it happening</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will Aacha make a reappearance?</br>  <br>I thought they dropped it since the last update was almost two years ago. That's good news.</br>  <br>Why is "Mood Whiplash" not on there? Every show I've seen by him has had it.</br>  <br>Maeda/10<br>Add something like "Charlotte" the comet randomly possesses one student with a power, and something to do with all the abilities users die/leave earth unless their leader does something.<br>Perhaps they are all aliens because of episode 9's title "A World not Here". The scientists are after Charlotte, hence why gathering them in one place.<br>Either way expecting a twist because everything so far feels a bit predictable. Hopefully the episode names live up to the hype.<br>Next episode is called "The Ephemeral Truth", expecting a revelation, possibly starting lead up for episode 6's tone shift.<br><br><br>Not enough stuff about the comet/brother/girl on the lake (Charlotte?).<br>Maeda is bound to put some despair in somewhere. A rebellion of test subjects is probably a red herring.<br><br><br> Every show  <br> show <br>Yes every original/adaptation has had it. It's just a product of not having enough build up. Nothing in the VN's had the issue. He is a VN writer after all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I really enjoyed the first episode about the MC being a dick ass and using his superpowers for fun. But then, moralfag higher-than-thou bitch shows up and ruins fucking everything. <br><br>The rest of this show is almost guaranteed to be self-righteous moralfag shit. Should I even keep watching this anymore?</br></br>  <br>You should kill yourself instead.</br>  Is cow's tongue good?  <br>Why the hostility buddy?</br>  <br>It really is.</br>  Nao's voice does things to my dick  <br>dunno, I never kissed a cow</br>  HIS CREATIVE KNOWS NO BOUNDS  <br>They made it look delicious.

A CUTE.</br>  <br>A single idol character can't pander to idolfags. When it's only one, they are the least popular character.</br>  <br> She sees your dick </br>  <br> maji dess kawwww </br>  Is it just me or does this anime feel a lot more generic than Maeda's usual work? I can't help but thinking his involvement is minimal. I still know he'll deliver in the second half, but so far it's just been relatively fun (AB was much more though) and the drama last episode felt like it lacked impact when compared to AB's early flashbacks.  <br>It's<br> majisskawww <br>Get your shit right, man.</br></br></br>  <br>Temee ni kite ne</br>  <br>Flashbacks are dumb.</br>  <br>I want to give her lots of compliments.</br>  I never watched LB. Is it worth it?  <br>READ THE VN<br>E<br>A<br>D<br><br>THE<br><br>V<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is the VN worth it?</br>  <br>VNs are never worth it</br>  <br>It is</br>  Every anime should have a baseball episode.  Only watching for the MC seiyuu. Everything about the show is pretty bland  <br>It's my favorite story ever, and the individual routes are good, unlike most VNs.</br>  <br>I started watching the anime adaptation. <br>I just finished the shadowless arc. So far it's been decent but I feel like it's missing something.<br>Is the VN worth it? I know most are worth it but I don't want to go through another +40 hour Clannad and get a shitty happy magical ending.<br>I like the VN opening though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Uchiyama Kouki is bland too</br>  <br>triggered</br>  <br>The routes are handled better.</br>  <br>If you didn't enjoy Clannad i doubt you will like Little Busters. Also, the VN is extremely long, unless you skip half of the dialogue it takes about 80+ hours.<br>In my opinion LB true end is much better than Clannad true end, what's more, JC Staff adaptation really fucking butchers the story so watching the anime is not a good idea.</br></br>  <br>I like when Sunrise completely revamped the show's site for this one baseball episode.</br>  Ninja high-tech wristband  <br>Himawari, Bolt and Naruto drank all the milk.</br>  <br> Yaranaika? </br>  <br><br>MILF + puberty = sticky sheets and sticky sheets = more laundry</br></br>  <br> Hopefully he's more laid back like he was at the beginning of the manga <br>He's in charge of the rambunctious Bort so I expect some comedic input from him.</br></br>  <br> what are kunai and shuriken </br>  Let us discuss the greatest SoL anime there is and ever will be.<br><br>What is your favourite episode of K-ON?<br>What is your favourite HTT song?<br>And, most importantly: what is it that makes Azusa so perfect?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Your dubs have won over Ritsu.</br>        <br>Your dubs only give me power.</br>   2wei Herz in three days <br> No Illya thread <br><br>Let's change that.</br></br></br>    New OP sounds better than the other two.<br>And the new Illya design looks great as well.</br>   op by fhana <br>kimochi.jpg</br>  Illya newfag here.
