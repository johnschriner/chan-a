[ Will Mikatan stay safe /a/?   Full OP  https://d.maxfile.ro/slryitafgi.mp3<wbr></wbr>   Full ED  https://d.maxfile.ro/gfjphfnmph.mp3<wbr></wbr>          OST when?  NicoNico is broadcasting eps 1-11 http://live.nicovideo.jp/watch/lv22<wbr>5114203</wbr>   Konnanimo kimi ga  sukide tamaranai   I will protect Mikatan's smile!   What's it mean?    1- great 5- shit It's rating      They liked it.       So, is Uchikoshi coming?   Is he?   No      Anyone got webm of the mecha stuff? I just caught up, shit was cash.      don't die Ito      Meika dies    Does this mean there will be a manga? https://twitter.com/punchline_pj/st<wbr>atus/614070633538850817</wbr>     Nah   Mikatan dies       Reminder  http://nichegamer.com/2015/06/first<wbr>-details-for-punch-line-game-interv<wbr>iew-with-kotaro-uchikoshi/  https://www.cs-reporters.com/vr/pun<wbr>chline/  Enjoy bad ending.  </wbr>  </wbr></wbr>      Virtual Reality   Uchikoshi wat       She's fine      Sounds pretty cool.  I'll get the game.  Even if I have to learn Japanese....I'll get it.        Guriko will die I can feel it   She won't   Up close, Guriko really did retain her pointy eye lashes just like the others.    Oh so she did. Nice catch.     She probably plucks them so she wouldn't look too gay    We need a good incentive to buy the games.  Anime will have a 999-esque safe ending, screencap this shit.       I think Guriko will die just because the Qmay leader is still alive. He'll intervene and probably try and kill Mikatan and Guriko will save her and die in the process.   It'll be a sad ending because the trio weren't able to rescue Guriko, and the game's true ending will be about all three reuniting.       The true end will have two Yuta's. The spirit one gained a physical body somehow, and the two of them will be paired with Chiyoko and Guriko.   See you guys after I watch the finale.  It's been a fun ride. Night.     detailed mech action   Torahachiro such BAMF   Thanks for the songs!    I guess the usual Korean uploaders probably forgot about it.    Is that supposed to be water? Cause it looks like cum.    Fuck off LLqueer    Heh, I'm still on episode 3   Get your hairy asses over here Show's starting    Finish it before you spoil yourself faggot    Don't decide for me, leave me alone   RIP.   inb4 Yuta looks at the camera and shows us U-TURN which prompts the viewer to buy the game if they want to know the true ending.   Is she truly dead?  Do robots die?    Wait, the OST is already available?   No.   super happy ending  LALALALALAcan't hear you...  http://board.futakuro.com/jk2/res/1<wbr>679536.htm</wbr>    How do Zerofags exist? I don't get it. It boggles the mind. Every fight in Zero feels like something from Naruto (He caught his sword and used it to deflect the other one!), and the plot is like a less mature version of Fate but with Heaven's Feel for an ending. This is ignoring that Zero is full of shitty CGI.  Even after Ufotable decided to remake UBW into the same sort of adaptation as Fate/Zero, Zerofags manage to actually bitch about UBW and how it isn't as "smart" or "mature" as their shitty spinoff.     Ubw is inferior to zero, just accept it.     CGI   that thing where everyone explains the fight instead of letting it happen   chuuni as fuck characters that don't get punished for being chuuni   JETS         Every fight in Zero feels like something from Naruto (He caught his sword and used it to deflect the other one!)  Just like F/SN     The main difference that in F/SN the fights had weight to them. There isn't a single fight in Fate/Zero that could even be put in the same category as Shirou v. Gilgamesh, or Shirou v. Berserker, or Gilgamesh v. Berserker.     EMIYA ALLY OF JUSTICE TORTURED BY HIS FATE   not more chuuni than anything in F/Z   Get over it, faggot. UBW pales in comparison. F/Z actually made proper use of the world Nasu built by using masters from all over the world, whereas UBW has FOUR fucking masters from the same high school. I mean, fucking seriously?        How do zerofags exist   muh porn novel is original   it has deep plot and character!  actually :  boring battle   same fighting place   not enough focus on other master beside rin and shirou            expecting the Association, the Church, and just about everything else to get shit done in 10 years    Nasu tends to make all his characters break the rules for the sake of the plot, mostly in UBW. Zero actually felt like a Holy Grail War, with more clever, thought out actions. The servants felt more like their mythological counterparts, and not distorted as fuck as Nasu did to the servants in the 5th HGW. The entirety of UBW was Shirou fanwanking, using plot armor and asspulls to try to show how "deep" of a character Shirou is.       &gt;not more chuuni than anything in F/Z  Yeah, and then he gets his shit kicked in for it. What are you trying to say here?    hurr durr porn can't have a good story  Pic related americunt         Because the protagonist is not an "avarage" highschool boy who beats servants with ease. Mainly because it focuses on every team and not just kiritsugu.     implying any of that matters   It's fucking boring and pandering, m8. Nasu's universe was too interesting of a setting for his writing abilities at the time of Fate/Stay Night.  This whole shit would be a million times better if he had started writing it now as a LN instead of an eroge that needs to justify how four fucking high schoolers are in the world's greatest mage battle.  F/Z actually felt like a real Grail War. UBW did not.    gets his shit kicked in   saves the day like three times   says goodbye to Rin and redeems himself   Did you think a Servant could stay in the world? He left because he ran out of mana, not because he got killed by anyone.                  Shitty CGI  Lancelot CGI was to portray FSG.      hurr durr muh epic fight scenes   Kill yourself, assburger.      Yeah, and it looked terrible.  Ninja Slayer uses CGI for comedic effect, but it still looks terrible.       Gilgamesh v berserker   had weight  you mean berserker took all weight       plays baseball with Tohsaka in the middle of the Holy Grail War   has a picnic   comes home   holy shit, Caster took Fuji-nee hostage!        F/SN is more chuuni and edgy than F/Z, kill yourself you memeing faggot.     4th Holy Grail War   everyone's buddy-buddy   nobody takes that shit seriously EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE ADULTS         Because the Fourth Heaven's Feel is actually the ONLY proper Heaven's Feel.  3rd one had Angra Mainyu 5th one had Destroyed grail 1st and 2nd one had broken class systems. 4th had enough preparation and proper placements          everyone's buddy-buddy  oh shit he went full retard     F/Z had actual mage battles requiring strategic choices on the part of masters.  Let's compare:   Shirou v Gilgamesh  DA BOAN OF MAH SWOAD WE R JUSS FAEKS  Saber v Lancer  Saber was at a disadvantage because of a miscalculation so Kiritsugu dicks his way into sabotaging Lancer by cutting a deal with his master. Realistic mage situation. Not to mention this fight is preceded by three different encounters between the two master/servants that build up into this final moment. Each encounter adding another layer to the confrontation.   One is chuuni power level shit, the other resembles what a real mage battle would entail.   Gilgamesh v. Berserker  Jobbing, the battle.  Gilgamesh v. Iskandar  More jobbing, for the same effect.   Shirou v. Berserker  Didn't even happen in the anime. Irrelevant to compare. But it's more Shirou fanwank.   It's pretty stupid to make a cool idea like Heaven's Feel, and only have it done properly once.                        AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA   forgetting Tohsaka and Priest   forgetting Waver and Kerry        thanks for confirming your retardness     It's pretty stupid to make a cool idea like Heaven's Feel, and only have it done properly once.   That's how they managed. First three were just the three great families finding loopholes in the Grail war's rules (and failing horribly)    fucking noobs          Tohsaka and Priest  What? Remind when Tohsaka and the priest went out for a night on the town.   Waver and Kerry  Did they play baseball at some point? I don't even remember Waver interacting with Kiritsugu.        I started watching the Fate Series around March probably. I initially watched UBW S01 and finished it just in time for the start of UBW S02. I got pretty bored with the first episodes, so I decided to watch Zero while UBW S02 was airing.  Well, there's absolutely no contest. Zero had better masters, better servants and an overall better story. Also, all fights seem believable, while in UBW Emiya goes from Crilin to Goku level in a couple of episodes.     I mean story-wise. There's a lot of room for really great character conflict and world building to be expanded on with Heaven's Feel. But we get SoL and jobbing instead.     Is it that hard to get the point the date scene was trying to get across?      implying  https://<span>youtu.be/ogNZtIAeDmM  [ ]     It's usually because people like  happen.     Tohsaka and priest   buddy buddy   backstabbed    rin and shirou   i-i'll kill you shirou if you dont bring saber with you   now who is more buddy buddy later            watching the anime  Opinion discarded.     He was comparing anime adaptations. I doubt he read the Zero LN. Zero anime &gt; UBW anime.     No, the Zero anime is uglier, and still full of the same retarded shit that was in the UBW anime.     he doesnt like saber get bullying     There shouldn't be a fucking date scene in the middle of a fucking Grail War. Do you remember Hitler going bowling with Churchill during WW2? A grail war is a retarded circumstance for teenagers to find love.    That scene alone is better than anything in UBW.    Saber bullying is a miracle of the universe.     saber trashing   buddy buddy      Is it that hard to understand that having a date in the middle of a war is retarded no matter what point you're trying to give to it?     No, the Zero anime is uglier     Exactly. There weren't any retarded date scenes in Fate/Zero, especially not with expensive wine and Grail talk.     He doesn't like saber being bullied.      conveniently using the one shot in the series that wasn't full of CG     UBW had CG too, m8.    Except it isn't, this thread already blew you the fuck out. Stay mad.  Enjoy your play dates during the most intense mage ritual. Oh, let's not forget servants need cum to regenerate mana, fucking kek.   Sorry, did you just compare a mage and Servant discussing the nature of the Grail and humanity to a picnic where a tsundere goes "G-geez, MC-kun"? In your mind, is a college lecture the same as talking about the latest avenger film?          saber trashing   not buddy-buddy  That shit happened in all three VN routes, including the one where Shirou fucks her.       same retarded shit  the place any battle in UBW took place : - school - temple - church - einzbern mansion boring shit over and over          No, I compared a scene where three Servants sitting around drinking and a tsundere goes "g-geez Gil-kun!" to a picnic where a tsundere goes "g-geez MC-kun!"     the world's greatest mage battle   Read the fucking VN.       less mature version of Fate   Fag detected. Calling your waifu simulator "mature" is laughable. Stop being obsessed butthurted about your "mature" waifu games.     Reminder Kiritsugu is so childish that he honestly thought that his ideals could become reality if he managed to get a magical cup, and was willing to put his wife in danger to do it.   Do you want me to pull up the dialogue so we can compare the content of the two?   Gil and Kotomine talked about what it means to desire something, Gil's philosophy on what life entails, the nature of the Grail, and Kotomine's lack of identity.  Rin, Saber, and Shirou talked about how Rin is really scary when she was batting and how much fun they had.  Good job, faggot. You're grasping at straws for like the fifth time this thread.           grimdark is mature   the removal of adult themes makes a story more mature   &gt;&gt;/MAL/       Everyone thought that. That's why all of the servants even bother fighting.     Gil and Kotomine  Retard detected, at least read my post before you respond. Here, I'll just post it again.   No, I compared a scene where three Servants sitting around drinking and a tsundere goes "g-geez Gil-kun!" to a picnic where a tsundere goes "g-geez MC-kun!"        I don't want to read an eroge where getting cummed inside replenishes mana.    Rin and Shirou talked about what it means to desire something. The nature of Emiya, and Emiya's lack of identity.    Yeah, and that doesn't make it any less childish. That's why the 4th HGW is the worst of them all, they're all fighting for the dumbest fucking purpose in existance. In the 5th, everyone who isn't Shinji or Saber has a different purpose for fighting in the war. Nobody desires the grail because it's a stupid thing to bet everything on.    Oh, so when three kings discussed what being a ruler means, each of their approaches to it, and why Saber failed at saving Britain and Lancelot?  Yes, that's exactly like Rin is so kowai! Wow, we had so much fun.      how the fuck you compare Rider and GIl talk completely destroy Saber Ideal. to "we have free time lets play baseball, oh crap caster ambush us"    Then play Realta Nua you subhuman mongrel.     not even RN/10     Yes, fighting to make Saber your wife, destroy the world, because your family told you to is a lot better than fighting to make a girl your wife, save the world, and because your family told you to.   At the picnic? No, they did not. The only time that's explored is in the bedroom and during fights.       I probably will play all of them at some point, but this thread is about the anime, m8.    The bus scene.     fighting to make Saber your wife  He has everything else, thus he wants Saber. He has no other desires that conflict with it, thus it makes sense for him to relentlessly pursue it when she's actually summoned.   destroy the world  For reasons properly explained in every work he's ever appeared in. He despises the world as it is, and only want the ones who stand out to serve him as they did during his lifetime.   because your family told you   Okay who the fuck are you talking about now, because regardless of who there is no way this isn't a massive oversimplification.              holy fk      more edgy than F/Z  F/Z was nothing but muh edge. Constant sacrifices and needless killing for the sake of making things dark.    Leaving aside the usual "Muh Zero is better" or "Muh VN is better" shit flinging from the rabid monkeys, at least one thing that's objectively true is that the Kerry vs Kirei fight is the emblem of good fighting in anime.  No shitty monologuing. No cringe-worthy dialogue about ideals that would be considered childish on a four year old (Hurr durr seigi no mikata) No explaining what each move does and just fucking using it No delaying using the most powerful moves because of muh pacing  Kerry vs Kirei felt like an actual fight between two people who want to kill eachother. They don't talk. They don't explain. They fight. They use right away every move they have, they don't withold anything, they just go until someone is dead.  Anime fighting is one of the worst thing in the medium, and Zero managed to do it right. Too bad nobody followed on it and we still have shitty saturday morning shonen-tier fighting even in mature series.             Ilya heart rip isn't edge   Ilya eye cut and bleeding out isn't edge   Sakura worm raped from child to teen isn't edge   Sakura getting raped by Shinji everyday isn't edge   BloodFort melting everyone into a perpetual pool of sludge isn't edge   Caster torturing Saber isn't edge   Kotomine orphans being living skeletons isn't edge    Consider killing yourself retard.              to make someone your wife  Because he's seen her suffer and tear apart her own family because of her mage husband. He wants to help her, which is itself a delusion. It turns out that all he did was make her suffer more, so he goes crazy.   to save the world  He despises the world as it is, and loves humanity. He wants to save everyone from despair so they don't have to make the choices he did.   for the family  Tohsaka in F/Z is only fighting because family duty to magic, because Root. Illya is only there because she was made to fight in the Grail War, for Root. She has a personal motivation to meet her onii-chan though, but I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt that you don't think that's actually better than wanting to advance magic research.          Buyfag thread, read this before asking questions http://buyfag.moe    Delicious brown.   Who is that qt   Can't wait for Rin   Sweet baby jesus, I want to stick my tongue in those dimples and lick them clean.    Sega Saturn     buying male figures     http://www.goodsmile.info/en/produc<wbr>t/5086/Nendoroid+Sega+Saturn.html</wbr>    What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch-NYA? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Otonokizaka Academy-NYAAN , and I’ve been involved in numerous secret club meetings on Idol Research clun-NYAA, and I have over 300 confirmed NYAAN. I am trained in backup dancing and I’m the top background singer in µ's-NYAA. You are nothing to me but just another umifag-NYAAN. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth-NYAA, mark my fucking words-NYANN. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker-NYAAN. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of school idols across nippon and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, NYAAN. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, NYAA. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare paws-NYAA. Not only am I extensively trained in background dancing, but I have access to the entire arsenal of sports related items kept at Otonokizaka Academy-NYAAN and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of Japan-NYAA, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you-NYAAA, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue-NYAAN. But you couldn’t-NYAAN, you didn’t-NYAAN, and now you’re paying the price-NYAAN, you goddamn idiot-NYAAAAAN. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, NYAA.    Not trying to be judgmental, but this is worst girl statistically right? I tend to only buy figures if they're popular characters, since I'm fickle and get tired of them and resell. Just wondering if I'll have a hard time reselling her even at a discounted price.  I already preordered kotori.      Who is this    Why isn't this young man wearing any clothes?    me    You have nice ass    A dude   In a girl's boy       Picking this sorry excuse for a nyaandol.   Oh well, HJ is having a blast, Momohime, D'Artagnan (Exclusive, hah!) and Hestia.   When can we pre order?     A dude In a girl's boy  Intirguin     Now    So gender bender? Looks like that one person from that one game    And in that game, she is possessed by a dude.     Rin's nya is at least more than just a shitty gimmick like with Miku, I swear to god I just wanted to punch the fuck out of her every time she talked, most annoying bitch in any anime ever.    Po-chan is too cute &lt;3     I want her but I don't think my mom would be able to appreciate the craftsmanship as much as I would.      That's what's up    There's something else up as well.    She should wear more clothes.     That price   Fucking hell.      1/8 FREEing 20k  No        Underage pls leave.    She actually looks decent with clothes on. She has a good face, but a pig disgusting body.    Oh well, surprisingly cheap. Hestia should be around 12ky at BiJ or so since she is less than10kY at HJ.   Hm, well that looks good rather than seeing her whale body.    I think it looks pretty nice, but you can always hold out for Max Factory.    Exclusive  Why nigga? I can't justify 18k+ yen on a 1/7 scale pvc figure. Not with my currency exchange rate.     If she was from MF or from the WHS line or even a 1/4 FREEing wouldn't mind that price since I would know I'm in for a 11/10 figure. But for a 1/8 from them? No fucking way, 90% of the time they end up with a different/derpy face from the prototype along with paint and QC issues.     Even if you have the money, trying to get a hold of her is a nightmare.     The problem is not the money, my friend, is that just tryong to order her is a fucking nightmare.     Yet somehow she's the Sega mascot girl.  She's my least favourite but well, clearly people like her.      That too. I don't understand the thought process behind starting a new line, funding an anime to advertize it, then making short supply and exclusive. Surely they would make more money at a lower price and wider release.    Oh, it was on HJ's site. Looks like I'll have to learn how to use a proxy.  Anyone have recommendations? I'm looking at 2you4 right now      Wait for the usual sites to have her up.   Got her in the mail earlier today. She's beautiful.  Just got this in the mail, didn't know it was 1/6 size. Pretty big. The lower leg seems to be disconnecting from the torso a tiny bit. Tried to use super glue to get it back where it should be, but so far, it hasn't done anything? How might I fix it?   COD proxy is more expensive than buying it straight from the usual resellers.    You have posted this exact same thing in about 3-4 different threads now. No one cares if you can afford it, no one wants to hear it, no one cares what you buy, and nobody can help you. Shut up already.    Hotglue it together.    Like Ami and BiJ?     1.84 MB, 1520x2688     Amiami doesn't deal with exclusives, Bij does. They are not the only ones though, read the guide.    Which type of hot glue do you mean? I'm not cumming on it.    I'm going to post it again tomorrow just for you anon.     20k  Are they on drugs?     Cool. Have fun never owning it.     She's surprisingly cheaper than I thought.  Nippon Yassan is the only one who doesn't ask you to pay right away with exclusives, right?      I'll get over it when the anime airs and I hate it.    It looks just like the normal one but with an uglier base. Did it at least have a different box design?    1) "Japan only" "COD only" drives up demand for high quality figures. It works because HJ are one of the best. If it's super limited, people buy more in anticipation of reselling high on YJA to foreigners in China.  2) Japan is their primary audience, for example all of amakuni's figures are Japan only. If all global sales stopped, it would only affect their sales to resellers. They don't care about global sales. HJ has the same attitude. 3) The market is maxing out in Japan. Growth is stagnant as inflation increases. What's happening to figures is the same thing that happened to DVDs. So they actually make more money overcharging the hardcore fans and forsaking the casuals.       No fucking way, 90% of the time they end up with a different/derpy face from the prototype along with paint and QC issues.  Which FREEing figure are you referring to?     But anon, if I complain about the price of things and keep mentioning how I can't afford them some wonderful buyfag will buy it for me. r-right?    It's funny seeing everyone bitch about her price when year-round everyone complains about simple bases and lackluster poses.    Yeah no, seems like you are just saying bullshit. Freeing delivers what the proto shows, the issue with them is their high prices and weird sculpt choices not the quality of their final products.  Phat is way worse in the points you mention     There is certain lewdness with TT art and figure.     I don't know who she is, but she looks shit.     I feel like I'm tho only one that likes the variant base. But to my knowledge, it was the same base, but it had foil stickers on it and such because its from wonfes    Certain lewdness...     the foil holos are the same in the regular version. Honestly, there's little point on getting the limited version, is not a recolor nor a better base like the one Kurumi had.    waiting for ami update...   Someone message NY to ask them when HJ figures are going up, so I don't have to play the f5 game all night needlessly in order to beat you faggots to the punch.    2) Japan is their primary audience, for example all of amakuni's figures are Japan only. If all global sales stopped, it would only affect their sales to resellers. They don't care about global sales. HJ has the same attitude.   And yet every time OS has claimed they want to stop international sales they quickly realise how retarded an idea that is.      There's no point on beating anyone on a product that is made to order, retard.    Who is this semen demon    But Amiko already updated. http://www.amiami.com/top/detail/de<wbr>tail?gcode=FIGURE-012203</wbr>    Honestly I hope they just delay her again in July, my order is already too much for my poorfag self to shell out at once.   Fucking christ my witch hat fetish UNF       Looking to sell what little I own. I never open the few I've bought so buying figs just isn't for me.    15,950 JPY  Could be worse       Yeah no, seems like you are just saying bullshit   The Sepang Miku released 2 months ago or their whole Yukata line who always end up 50-60% off 2-4 months after release.       Oh, I didn't realize. I got it off Manda, and it was only 2k more, so I don't really regret it.    Now this is an idol I can get behind.  Also latex Asmo, archer Asmo, band leader Satan and biker Satan when.      Death to tiny hats    YEEEESSSSSS!     that fused calf   preorder anyways   Why do I do this to myself.       Now if we only got the DICKSUCK preorders soon.   More semen demon.   Fuck, I keep seeing this posted around here and thinking a Kohina fig is coming out.      The sepang miku incidents were isolated though, also, binning is not a good way of measuring a figure or a line, Alter's Strike witches have binned for up to 80% before.     This looks very pretty, too bad she's junk tier now and not worth the effort     Yeaah. I think I'll wait for MF Ramlethal. I might get the Freeing one if she bins enough. Mu-12 got pretty cheap.    Top hat fascinators are cool + cute.   Why does mecha always cost so much?!   Two different sets of arms with no seams? So she's going to have 2 different bodies?    Well there's a doll    Wait what? How does this sorcery work?    Look like they're the same from the waist down. So two torsos/heads.    A shit ton of spare parts? SHe is exclusive anyway, so prepare for Amakuni rape.    Another fucking one? Can they give the other girls a chance first?  What's up with the favoritism anyway. Leviathan has terrible sales because they totally shit on her figure with a totally unfun cast off. And now she only has 3 figures. Lucifer, has 6. Asmodeus has 4.      This pose will never be not retarded.    Leviathan is the most popular figure actually, look at the aftermarket prices.    Where are the other Satans?    Read the dialogue at the site, technically Lucifer is the closest character to be the main protag.    It looks better in the original art, but the compromise between the standing pose and the lying pose sort of ruins the lying pose.    Normal, Ice Cream, Bunny, Santa    You say that in complete ignorance.  I'm for 2ch persian rug figure dungeon owner to show you how wrong you are.      Those are Asmodeus, not Satan    I'm waiting for*    Derp. I'm confusing Satan and Asmo of course. Satan Claus is the only other Satan.    She happens to be an expert in poses     Santa is Satan. Bunny and Ice Cream are Asmondeus     if only the figure itself had delicious tanlines.    It's orchid Seed, chances are we will get a tanned version.   Hopefully.       in this figure its a girl in a girls body the male spirit is right beside her     Why no Belphegor?    More like, if only the figure had a visible anus like the art.    To be fair, he leaves her body so she can use the hot springs, so technically unlike her other fig, this one is spiritually a chick.    Because she's shit and literal worst Sin.    I would buy a fig of her in that pose with that skin tone.    Me too, even if they game this figure tanlines I still wouldn't like it that much.  There really should be more mildly lewd tanline figures.     I'd just settle for going back in time and ordering the towel.    they tried but everyone got too lazy    fucking when     art has big round butt   figure has tiny pancake butt      This figure is so complex that I have a hard time believing they won't fuck up some part.  This is like an 18k figure at the least if it's high quality.      It's hardly any more complex than the main sins line.    Once shipping and proxy fees come into play I wouldn't be surprised to see the total price for that fig be north of 25k.    Ya, everyone is waiting on it, but once they see the price I bet most of the people reposting or commenting on it will be turned away.    I don't see it being anywhere that expensive, it's not that far from the complexity Mammon, Beel or even the original asmo had .    I want Elphelt     leviathan not capitalized     It's envious of the other name tags.    i was going to say you're wrong, but i've learned to never underestimate chinese incompetence    Are they standing on fucking Vita cases?    Yes     ENTERTAINMENT FOR PURE BOYS     Wait what? Is that? But, no. I been out of this fucking buying figure shit for more than year. How can this be? How can they have actually made D'artagnan and not make it terrible?  I gave up Alter. I had given up after so long, what in the fuck are you doing to me? I'm having the biggest slowpoke mindfuck of my life.       She just went up for preorders today   Exclusive       Also, she has a tight butt.<br/>   An 18+ daki of toshino kyouko but I've never seen a picture of this one before.  http://order.mandarake.co.jp/order/<wbr>detailPage/item?itemCode=1013563056<wbr>  If no one else wants it, I'll buy it later, just take a picture or something if you grab it before me.  </wbr></wbr>     Fucking SAME. I want a Leo too.    1/4 scale Potemkin, forced EMS shipping.    Buy it fgt    the hell is that in her mouth?     Rucifer   sexsiest      She's eating a small dog.   Hestia just went up on BiJ. I thought she was supposed to come out November/December this year? It says March-April 2016, I really don't want to pay for a fig that I'm not going to see for another year.   CONTACTO     I can only find the hobbyjapan order page. Nothing on the other sites. I'm so on edge. I NEED IT. Everyone called me shit for liking her. For making her my favorite. For wanting this figure. So much is happening for me now, I don't care how much of a fag I sound.       Okay, done.     Hige version.    Me neither. She'll be my first scale    Paypal attached to debit card works   Debit card works in physical stores   Anytime I try to buy something on amiami/cdjapan/whatever, card is denied   I don't get it. Anyone else ever have this problem?       The accumulated bushes from faceless bald men.    wait for tomorrow, BiJ will have her.   Problem?         It's already up in BiJ.       world exclusive oppai   hot for bunny   she's haitenai   Sounds like the lyrics from a Japanese hiphop track.         http://www.goodsmile.info/en/produ<wbr>ct/5086/Nendoroid+Sega+Saturn.html</wbr>    She comes with a little saturn       Why does it say cherry boys and then say ero oyajis. Isn't that contradictory. Or is this for virgin wizards?    Just noticed, also Hestia went better than keikakued.   Front and back, opposite sides anon.       I'll wait for until after Comic Con / Wonfest to order her. Orders close 8/11.  I don't want to pay in full for something that comes out 9 months from now. May as well just pay aftermarket if that's the case.      Officially, but, Bij closes the orders 10 days or a week earlier.    Ya. I'll order it from NY, when it opens, and order my second one from BIJ at the end of July.  I hate paying now for anything that's more than 4 months away.       Prices aren't bad, but I doubt I'll pay that much for something I won't see in a year.    where do you guys buy baseplates for your figurines?   What the fuck are you on about?     baseplates  the what?     Huh?   Go ahead, tear me apart.      so the garage kit i assembled is pretty unstable and can only stand by itself barely as its only supported by a small wedge (see attached pic)  i was wondering if there were like a platform or something i can attach the wedge to for added security?   i was thinking something along the lines of a wax based substance for added "stick"           Nip figs come with bases. If you need some foir some reason this place sells finished wood and acrylic ones are well as other stuff like risers. http://www.collectingwarehouse.com/<wbr></wbr>      forgot pic ;-;     19400  Not this shit again.     Meh, I don't know. Been watching Dragon Ball for the last two and a half decades or so, yet I can't bring myself to get any figure of it, they looks just so out of place with everything I have.    it also doesn't help that I remember seeing some 2$ cheap ass toys of it in the market when I was a kid, so even it were from Alter I would still associate it as something cheap.         wax based substance for added "stick"  If you don't want to glue it use museum/earthquake putty      4000 anime dollars shipping   Fuck me, for one item?      You're fucking up pretty badly     What's the name of the series this figure is from? It looks so familiar, but I can't remember       this is something along the lines i was looking for. thanks anons~   sorry         my friends are getting into that dbz card game, I always make fun of them whenever they have shitty pulls when buying packs    One item, but I blame the bath poster.    I noticed shipping from japan recently has become more expensive in that last 2 weeks. Not just with figures but with clothes too.       This is probably the sexiest figure I've ever seen, but I fucking hate videogames after dealing with /v/.  Back when they became giant faggy nintendo retards, and wanted videogames to get taken over by casuals and flooded with shovelware.         coolio      Still no Dreamcast-chan   Call me when we get best system       Now I may know absolutely nothing about economic processes, but perhaps it's because the exchange rate is otherwise fucked for the japs.  They have to get extra money from importers somehow.      Go back to /v/ and stay with that mentality there. I hate dipshits that subjectively evaluate figures due to reasons like 'original material is bad', 'slut is used goods' or '/v/ shit'.    Heh, glad I moved on to Sony.     5/10 made me respond   Volks forgot to include a base   being good enough to build a GK and not knowing how to make a base         That's 2/3 now hurry the fuck up MF I want my Benisuzume.     She will be released on time  Maki should've been released in May and now she just got pushed back another month into July. Also can't wait to see if they will delay bird.    http://goodsmile-global.ecq.sc/amws<wbr>cawd00001.html/?utm_source=GSCMM001<wbr>&amp;utm_medium=MM2015-06-25&amp;utm_campai<wbr>gn=http://goodsmile-global.ecq.sc/a<wbr>mwscawd00001.html   *Due to licensing constraints, this product will not be available for shipment to Canada, and United States of America. We appreciate your understanding.    Yeah, fuck you too, GSC. A little obnoxious, but I'll just use a middleman service.    </wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>    not building your own  fucking pleb     I can smell your shit taste from here.    Planning to order her through Nippon Yasan. Have they improved their packaging?    the base is the little wedge stand they give. i swaer mang  looked at manual and no base either       But then I have to do things, I just want to throw money at my problems.    You better not be that faggot from /v/ because that would be horribly ironic.    holy fucking shit that is sick    let me guess, colored resin, no painting required?  just build the fucking base from a piece of fucking wood and glue the wedge to it, geez      SAS Gyro Zeppeli.   YOOOO!     Is this Tenshi figure really that rare?     You could just get it from NY     I don't know about rare, but she's definitely beautiful and worth the effort of obtaining. Her first run was exclusive too, so this isn't totally unexpected, though it is a little frustrating since you have a few more hoops to jump through.  That said, I do already own her, but I wouldn't mind owning a second to display without the wings (and the prospect of a newly designed box is kind of enticing).         no dreamcast  This is not hai hai.     Did Japan announce remake of the anime without shitty ending?    Would hot glue.     new anime  All we're getting is that new OVA, though it says "to be continued," but that could just be A-1 and Maeda trolling or a not-so-subtle suggestion to go buy the VNs.   But this is what the VNs will be for. Vicariously live them for what the anime could not, and did not deliver.       now i'm more confused who to get, black heart or this one  pls not both     pretty late, but I plan on getting pic related, thoughts?   She's nice. No real issues besides the slight gap where the skirt can come off, and there's no reason to ever remove it.   I swear I will find a Guts figma that isn't absurdly priced. Wish I was here a couple years ago before they came out   test    failed   If I have an order of about five things, will Ami cancel one of the things in the order?   If you're lucky.    It's been about a month, I wonder if the Patchouli nendo is available for pre-order   Apparently missed the pre-order window by a week   amiami and hobby search aren't listing it   Well shit, I fucked up.       Yes. Every time you order about 5 items from them, they will chose one of the items at random and remove it from your order without your consent. The ultimate russian roulette.    She's an exclusive.    It won't be expensive in the aftermarket, or at least it won't be more expensive than the cost of buying from GSC. They're all bin figures now.    Yeah, I even knew that but completely forgot to check up on her since she was announced.   Hope so. Will have to keep my eyes peeled on mandarake once she's released. Cause damn if it isn't a cute nendo.       Dat ass too flat.    looks good, would love to get the forest one, but probably impossible to find one for sale though.       Good. God.     She's oppai loli, not a midget. The ass is intentionally flat.    I need to see the gravitits.     not a bubble butt.  Pretty lame, I was hoping for better ass shading, even if it was just for the prototype.    Just a reminder. Kahotan station is this morning in a few hours.   you have my attention   How many of you made the mistake of not preordering when you had the chance.    Preordering PHAT ever     Fuck off retard.    Why would you say such a thing?    How many of you made the mistake of not preordering when you had the chance.     oppai loli  Two perfectly good words that when put together become vomit-inducing.     Hoping the special one with the pimp stand bins for some reason.  Will probably settle for the regular in the aftermarket.     WON FES SOON  Vertex just tweeted an abomination   yay more boats    Don't lose hope. Your favorite series with no figures might just get one!       Cute    Is this the character with the most figures that are almost naked?    porkchop doesn't have nearly as many as sonico   Are there any daki cover materials that don't eventually get scratched up by facial hair?   shave    Just fucking shave, caveman.    Peach Skin    uh, I expected the paint job to be a lot better.     Uncultured swines.     How much would you bet that she gets delayed again?    Don't tell me you're some kind of asian terrorist muslim, noodles?     too cute    1 hour 20 minutes 'til Ryougi goes up for preorders.  Amazon JP figures are now at the start of their bin cycle again.     No, I am an asian hipster.    How are Stronger figures? Can I expect it to look as good as the proto?    That's even worse. I bet you wear colorful cord jeans too.   Stronger is former GSC staff, so it's more or less around the same level.       http://myfigurecollection.net/searc<wbr>h.php?manufacturer_strict=1&amp;manufac<wbr>turer_id=62079  A few of them look off, (Homu and Sento).  They did the new K-On sculpts which look great so far.    </wbr></wbr>    We hipster wear sarong. Get your fact right.     wearing shit that looks like a skirt  Why not go all out and make your inner trap happy with a real one?    My Phat Sachiko just got sent out after sitting at Amazon warehouse for two months waiting for another item in the order.  I am looking forward to a box that looks like crumbled tissue paper.    Anyone preorder fire emblem ciphers?  <br/>    Will they charge me right away like bij?    I want to combine shipping on Big in Japan, is there some sort of time limit? Shit I want to combine is coming out today supposedly.   How much for Thraja ?   guys what if i die soon and not be able to pay for my preorders, am i going to get banned?  Can someone post the delays for this month? TIA    They'll go after your estate / family for the money.     belt fastened through loosest notch  Nice one, Vertex.   Yeah I'm not very impressed. The paint looks kind of cheap and shitty, and I can't work out why.         TIA  go pleasure yourself anally with a red-hot iron    Ryougi is up. 13k yen.. Lol   like the yakuza?    Holy shit my dick.    i'll do it together with all of my pochaco figs    She looks good and I really want her, but   Art Spirits   Broccoli   The final product won't look nearly as good as that, am I right?         Think she'll go up on the Aniplexusa site?  ... I need her in my life.      GSC take my money for Re-Class.   Soon.    Kahotan is up.  They're talking about that gay code shit.     Needs DVR and FF.    i don't even know why i bother watching these, they never show anything good    I think they're going to show that Cordelia from Fire Emblem this time.   BiJ or N-Y?   Yes    They are, but that doesn't mean that anon thinks it's anything worthwhile. It's better to watch these streams when you know there's something you want showing.     Who is this mattress actress?     What?     Both charge right away, so I dunno.     All these preorders that opened today  Damn Hobby Japan is good at this. Got Shiki from Aniplex and Hestia from them.     I don't think that's true, ayynon    Quite possibly the stupidest thing I ever wanted to buy. Sold out though.    8,200 JPY   I was expecting her to be more for some reason.      What the fuck do you even do with one of these? Even the obvious answer of "hang it from a glass" doesn't really make any sense at all.    code   obscure game   robots  About to go back to sleep       Maki pushed back   Thank God. My wallet wasn't quite ready      Thank you for your message.   Unfortunately due to short of hands and overwhelming amount of orders, we are unable to monitor this mailbox currently.   If you have questions about your order/item, please email the store you placed the order with.   But I'm having an account problem, not an item problem, Mandarake.       hands that go with the stage outfits included with the practice outfit LL nendoroids   Sasuga jewsmile.     Decoration. I guess someone with a mug collection could use them. I just want them because they're adorable as fuck.    And now they are advertising eye liner. Feels like I'm in the wrong hobby.    Muramasa   Okay I'm done with this broadcast. I can't sit through another 45 minutes of boring shit just to see 1 min of cordelia. Someone take mass screenshots please.  Otaku no Video KS ends today if you were planning on getting it.   Yes this posted 9 hour ago but I really want to know, what is the difference between Miku and Rin's nyaa? But to me they are mre or less the same nyaa. Please nyaa experts explains.    Don't worry they'll be up on MFC a minute after airing. Just check newest pictures every once in a while, or simply track her page.      Check MFC   Nothing of interest  Wow, it's fucking nothing.       Wasnt she delayed a few days, to like July 7th?    Probably late July   Exclusive lewd..again.   Shave    Just another hair color with a poster? I don't get it.   ALL OF MY MONEY  I really hate it when June release means June 30th release.     She's not getting released in June    Probably shouldn't have left the order no. No idea if that matters.    Currently on phone so I dont have the rest of the pics.  Nendo Training Honoka, raiden and iron man shown      I dont know about June 30.    Don't say that. Was something actually stated?    http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>166937</wbr>    Her pictures are up.   There's an item in Mandrake which I wish to purchase. It's like half price of what it would usually cost and the condition says that it is "Unopened, with some box damage." Is this really legit? as it seems somewhat too good to be true. There's also another similar figure that is the full price of what it should be.     Amazon has it as June 30th. It could be that ami is just saying July because that's when it'll actually be going out.    I do hope than ami send it out in july. My wallet would much rather that. Takes my 30k month from june to july but tax returns.    Where does mfc even pull their information from? Is it user updated or do admins publish shit?    Mandarake is usually pretty spot on when it comes to pricing things for the Japanese market. I don't know where you're getting your idea of what it would usually cost, but if your concern is that mandarake is going to give you a fake item or a smashed piece of shit, then don't worry. Their standards are as high as most Japanese places.    User and once they've confirmed it, it's way too much fucking effort for anyone else but the original person to get it changed.    Ok, then I'm sticking with my June 30th theory until proven wrong.   When it comes to undervaluing items, do I have to give the shop the set amount I want them to value it too?     Yes.    Depends on the site, but yeah, usually you give them a number or else they'll just knock it down 80% or some random amount. I've had a lot of places do it without asking (don't need it in the US lel)    Finally   Ohh, Iona!   Classy girl.    You must be new to this.      Mandarake always lies about their box condition.  They say that it's damaged when it's not.     Can anyone give me a picture of what the box looks like from the back please? May have to deal with customs in the future.  Btw Noodles, do you by any chance know what's the max amount an item can cost before it is taxed in Malaysia? Also how do you avoid customs, I noticed you now own bath loli?     Shit, that's cute. Not something I would've expected to get a Nendo though, is it more popular than I think it is?      Isn't noodles in Singaporn?    Below RM500. Above that, likely to get taxed and ask you to open the box to see what is it.    thought he was malay.    Thanks     He has an account on mfc     Damn I love her character design, too bad her route was boring.   Quick question everyone, if I want to ask Mandrake to undervalue an item I ask them in their comment column when I confirm my purchase am I right?  So how do you get out of this hobby? I've been stuck in a limbo for a good 8 years now.  It's one hell of an slippery slope and I wouldn't mind having money for other things.      Sell your collection.    Sell what you have    hair, eye, tile, bowl colors and skin tan are different. plus a poster.    How common is the ability of figmas to sit wariza?   Hey, I asked about buying shimapan a month or so ago. I come bearing results.  I decided to buy them from ebay, link related DL option. http://www.ebay.com/itm/15140967913<wbr>0?_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649&amp;var=<wbr>450598530477&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBI<wbr>DX%3AIT  Even though they're from ebay they came in a Taobao branded zip lock baggie which was a surprise.  They're great, the color is a lighter blue and not that standard darker 'Mio' shade but still nice. The fit is excellent it's tight elastic around the waist and thighs that dig in just a little bit which looks amazing. Comes with a tiny bow on the front of the waist but easy enough to remove. Only complaint is that the material is just a bit too thin so in the light you can see her crack. It said "Not suitable for the transvestite" which made me laugh so much I tried it, they're right, definitely "Not suitable for the transvestite" if you're into that    </wbr></wbr></wbr>      Stop going on buyfag threads and sell your collection. The more you stay with other buyfags, the more you'll buy     I'll never sell my collection but I've been thinking about ditching every payment from now on and getting blacklisted from the stores.   And if I ever wanna get back I can just use another address and name        I thought you emailed them after you made the purchase    You should know that you'll never be able to ditch every payment as there'll forever be that little voice in your head telling you to buy more     tiny bow   easy enough to remove      So you don't really want to leave. If you did you'd sell everything, or almost everything. When you have something on your shelf you keep wanting more. If you can't handle your money get banned and once you do, quit.      If they're "Not suitable for the transvestite" what were you buying them for?      gf   I don't have anything to prove and it means nothing to just say you have one on the internet. I just came to share my results because a few other people were interested in buying them too. Although I don't know how many of them would want them to be suitable for the transvestite or not.       Post pics of her wearing it.  Unless she's fat, then don't.     It says "one size" but what size would you say it is?    Don't really want to be annoying but I'm going to ask this question again. How do you ask Mandrake to undervalue your purchases?     Fuck off <br/>     one size    I wonder if that one size includes Pochaco size       If you notice, there is no knee joints.     implying anyone cares for fatties, especially when they're 3D  They'd probably rip.     Yes.  But they have done it automatically every time for me.      I don't know anything about underwear sizes but I have a thin waist and they stayed on me just fine, they filled out on her a lot more being a girl but still pretty thin if that's what you're asking. I just tested how far they stretch and it was quite far, looks like they'd start to get uncomfortable at 100Kg+ I guess?   So I'm pretty new to buyfagging, I ordered a restock of an item and got the "we secured your item email" a few months back. If I change shipping options and if it ships bundled with anything could my item get unsecured?  Also the thing was initially due for May, got pushed to June and still isn't in stock is that common?     What the hell    What did you purchase?    Perfect Grade EVA-01 Model Kit. http://www.amiami.com/top/detail/de<wbr>tail?scode=GDS-2973-S001</wbr>     You can change shipping options when you pay so there's no problem.   is that common?  Yes       Naked body is a exclusive    Anyone else preorder this Sonico? I checked on NY and the release date is the same as Shinobu. july 2015. Im so excited! These will be my very first scale figures ever.   Cyborg body when?    Oh god, why would you buy that. That thing is arguably the worst of the PGs. You'd have been better off getting an Eva sofubi or vinyl figure if you wanted something that big. Or just the Koto model kit if you needed a decent eva..     Oh god, why would you buy that.  He's a evafag, a casual who doesn't know any better.    Are there any chances that Alter Shinobu will be delayed another month? My July order is too much...   My july is getting heavy too. Save up starting now anon. Save every nickel and dime.   http://www.moeyo.com/article/65318  Is it finally over? Are we finally free from the welded tits disease?     I hope so. I've passed on many figures because welded tits. I'd be getting Mio Naruse fig next month if it wasn't for that weld. This is both good and bad, because now I might spend more money.    Thanks for pointing that out, I probably should have done a little bit more research than none at all.  I'm probably going to cancel the order now and look into the EVAs you mentioned. The main reason I was going for the PG before was it was the only non-rebuild EVA-01 I could find. But I may just suck it up and go with the Kotobukiya.       Putitto  [Laughs in spanish]     She's pretty big (I got the first version) and the cast-off is a nice option too. Have fun with her, anon.    The original version is nice, so that one probably is too. I don't like suntan Sonico (or tanlines in general) so I'd never go for that one.    Speaking of the Koto model kit, I finished building mine a few days back. Took me long enough. Did anyone else get one? It still needs minor paint touch ups but I'm worried about painting it because I can't paint for shit and some of the details are so fine that I'm not even sure what I'd use to do them, like the red lines on it's face.    Her paint job, especially on the hair, looks extremely disappointing but that might just be from the low-quality images. I'm hoping it's not nearly as bad as it looks.   For those of you who have ignored payment requests from amiami, how exactly did the process go?   These two Japanese gentleman showed up at my door and broke my legs.    1/3 scale  http://www.amiami.com/top/detail/de<wbr>tail?gcode=FIGURE-012181  That, my friends. Is a blunt weapon.  </wbr>    Well this is from MGS2, so not yet.  Maybe if MGR2 ever became a thing, that would happen.   But Konami are done so that will never happen, even though there was a pretty heavy teaser for it a few months ago.        Her face could have been done better in my opinion.  That being said, I wonder if there would be any tumblr feminists who would jump at the idea of Pochaco showing that fat girls are also beautiful?     How much will it weigh? That's a lot of fat, I mean plastic.    You could feed a small country with that much pork.     Polyresin   40k       Her face could have been done better in my opinion.  I'd give you an understandment of the year award, but sadly I think that's how Pochaco's face is meant to look.     Not fat enough.    Good representation of an American women    I know she's supposed to look stupid, but that figure seems to make her look more stupid than she's meant to.   Oreimo bunnies up for PO. Resin, look plain as fuck...want 11k for it. Seriously.  So here is a question. I am on a really high debt right now and because of that I wont be able to pay for my amiami orders this month. I heard that if you just ignore the payment deadline they automatically cancel your order. Is this correct or should I just expect to get banned?  Muramasa or Hestia? Yes, I'm asking about the Amakuni ones. What's with the sudden influx of people with payment issues?    Are Pulchra even any good? I know they announced Mio and Yuki from Shinmai and I would like good lewdish figures of them    Muramasa.    Muramasa    I dunno. Only knew they make awesome adorable phone stand.    Not Hestia    Muramasa    Just tell them that you can't buy and ask them to cancel the order. Also don't forget to say sorry. They won't blacklist you just for one cancellation, especially if you've already bought from them before.    Hestia, that Momohime looks like shit.    Both.    They range from awful to average, not necessarily worth the money they want for it.    How much for Senbonzakura Miku?     Shipping costs for this item may be very high due to package size or/and weight  What a fatty boombalatty.      putitto   little fag     Enjoy the twenty-fifth of June.   Thanks.    Thanks.   I don't know much about artbooks. Is this actually going to be one? It's listed as a "mook/anime magazine" on amiami. http://www.1999.co.jp/eng/10322611     Make sure to throw in a line about intending to do business in the future too but keep it short.    How do I appeal a case on ebay?  Oh what, I'm this anon     Can you not cancel amiami orders? Fuck I should have read the faq properly, I have orders that I am on the fence about. Most of them I'm ok with still buying since I fucked up and they are figures I want but I really want to cancel the EVA kit I linked before, if there is any help I could have I would be so grateful.  I am going to spend all morning tomorrow reading the entire buyfag faq.           It's not an art book, it's basically a glorified tv guide where 80% of the contents are screencaps from the anime, some interviews and maybe 10-20% actual art    Do they ban accounts or IPs or addresses or payment methods, any info on the actual repercussions would be helpful too.     there's no reason to ever remove it.  She has such a sexy belly though, but the scarf thing around her midriff should've been removable too since it just looks stupid when you take the skirt off.     No you can't. Maybe if you ask them nicely and have given them money before they might cancel your item.  There is a reason why guide is in every OP. I hope you learned something from this.     Yes. Both. Buy    Thanks  tfw have to put figs in box because they're going to move shit in the house to install ACs      What did you buy, retard?      Alter already confirmed July 7th. Amazon's just slow at updating.      They ban your address, email and payment methods (your credit card and paypal)    Thanks for the warning.       I hope you learned something from this.    Idiots    Learn anything ever   Don't get your hopes up.         Sold a pre-order I didn't want anymore. The guy didn't want to spend extra on tracking so now I'm suck with a "buyer never received item" case, even though it hasn't even been two weeks since it shipped.    There are plenty of figures around with pressed tits and no weld. And that dartagnan is not even close of the best exponents.    You're fucked. Even if you get him to wait a month he could still say he didn't get the item and they'd believe him.    I have bought and paid 2 orders prior so hopefully this works out.   Welp I'm glad I have good friends just in case. I will not be making this mistake twice.   Anon pls,  I really did fuck up pretty bad          Hmm.    I am going to spend all morning tomorrow reading the entire buyfag faq.   needing to read the buyfag fag  Back in my day we didn't need our hand held to buy chinese barbie dolls      Well then. Just email them and be as polite as possible. I don't think Amiami bans you straight away, they just tell you to fuck off and pay for your order if they don't want to cancel it.    What is she holding, and why is there a shoe at the end of it?   K-Ons have the best fashion sense.  That they do.    I can only imagine how the boys in their world can't stop drooling as soon as they show up.     Just watched this episode   I wasn't told about this, why am I crying to moeshit?       rhythm   rock      Those are whore party clothes  Today I will remind them.  I want to obsess over the kind of clothes I wear too. Why is mens fashion so boring?   So true. Men's fashion is a fucking bore, unless you're part of the 1% of exceptional looking men who can pull of actual high fashion looks without looking retarded.    Because you're a kyoanifag and the cancer killing anime.     plebs not recognizing Azusa's effay as fuck Comme des Garcons Ann Demeulemeester head to toe     I think the taxi driver in London was the only man in their entire world.   I haven't read the manga and I'm about to finish season 2. Who else joins after the 3rd years graduate? Jun said she would and I guess Ui will to, but they still need someone to play drums and piano. I don't really want to touch the manga because I'm still hoping they'll make a third season.   See now if you do start the manga you're going to read it from the biased point of view of a KyoAnifag and won't be able to fully enjoy it if you tried. Shame, everything was done so much better in the manga. I think KyoAni missed the fundamental point of the series with their adaption, but having seen that adaption first you wouldn't be able to accept that.    There's Ritsu's otouto and the guy in the music store where they bought Yui's guitar off the top of my head.    The school's headmaster, the one of whom Sawako lives in constant fear.  There's Ritsu's otouto  Anime original. That music store clerk though, God bless his soul.        Anime original  If you're going off the manga, you can throw in Yui's father (that's right, kyoanifags).     Chitanda, is that you?    Azusa could literally wear fucking cargo shorts with socks &amp; sandals and she'd still be the cutest    Yui's parents are shown in the movie, too.    I think she did that once. No, she was not the cutest.    Did the gang meet them?    I demand proofs Azusa is always the cutest     How does she play guitar with those hands?    The Mustang is better for people with smaller hands    She played in the same band as Akiyama Mio. You can not make those kinds of statements.    Mustang is a smaller scale guitar.    I can and will m80, what are you going to do about it   I want to cum on Ritsu's  feet.   I'm in love with Mugi!  And I hope those Mugicucks are fucking dead!    I'm going to post Mio.    I do hope you're a woman making that statement.    Then I'll have no choice but to post the angel of HTT   So if among us guitar fags, how mant HTT songs can you play to completion?  Fuwa Fuwa Time need not apply.     I'm not, but my hair is woman-length and I'm pretty frail, so I'm sure she'd be able to accept it.    They only called her that because they felt guilty for leaving her out as they prepared for college entrance exams which were important because they all wanted to go to the same high-ranking school Mugi got recommended into because they wanted to stay together as friends after high school because the world does not end after high school fucking KyoAnus.    The fundamental point was growing up both in the manga and anime. Since the manga is a 4koma it wasn't nearly as emotional or had the same impact as its adaptation. Too bad your anti KyoAni mindset has blinded you    The called her and angel because she is one    10. Go Go Maniac is the best.      The world does not end after highschool   But anon, it does.       Have you actually read the manga? Its primary gags are paced around the 4 koma but there is a continuous storyline among pages.    I started learning to play the guitar just to be able to play Fuwa Fuwa Time.    Have you actually watched the anime? It's primary gags are paced around scene by scene but there is a continuous storyline among the season.    And the point of that comment was?    Try to bash on KyoAni by responding with a completely irrelevant statement to the fact that KyoAni's adaptation is miles ahead of its source material despite both telling the same story?    If you actually read the manga instead of being a retarded kyoanifag you would know that they do not at all tell the same story and that everything you have said up until now has been out of ignorance.     Fuwa Fuwa Time got me back into playing.   Once you get the opening riff down it feels like sex coming out of your amp.       They pretty much do tell the same story my little anti KyoAni babby. But keep crying I'm really enjoying your tantrums.       he says having never read the manga (or proably never having watched the anime either)      Get a room you fuckign nerds     Have you read the manga? No? Shut the fuck up, Black Jack.    Yes actually    Then you'd be able to answer trivia questions? You understand that failure to answer them correctly would determine your opinion to be invalid?   The anime actually expands upon the source material. The manga is just another crude 4koma. KyoAni fleshed out the characters and gave them more personalities. K-On anime is simply better.   You haven't read the manga, you don't know what you're talking about.    I have. But its pretty clear that you haven't watched the anime    Do you know where you are? Do you know what the K-ON! anime is?     What a silly post by a silly person. What the fuck are you even saying     What is the argument device called where a person knows full well they know nothing of a subject, and in order to mask this ignorance they shall imply that their opponent also doesn't know these things? Because I feel that's what you're doing, and I won't stand for it.   I'm worried about them. They are alre ady in college and haven't met a single guy to go out with. At this point they be alone like Sawa   Only Ritsu. Who gets who? Let the people who supposedly have also read the manga figure it out.    Nice job projecting this hard, anon.     It's funny because think about this for a second.  You spent a minute or two typing up that paragraph, and thought about it in order to reply to me.  And that's your entire life anon.  Also, you're post is retarded because the anon asked if you've seen it, yet you reply with "It's an anime, do you know where you are". Which is irrelevent because that has no bearing on the topic at hand. Technically you haven't answered the question           Had pretty much dropped guitar until I watched K-On, it got me back into it. I can play most of them besides a couple solos. I like to arrange acoustic renditions of songs too.    See I beat K-ON! Houkago Live!! after I finished everything else to do with the franchise. There is nothing you know that I don't.    This is what is known as projection.    Not that guy but he's right wouldn't call the manga "crude" but the anime did everything the manga did but better. Fantastic adaptation.     You really are retarded aren't you  Don't you have a book report coming up or something       You literally read a few chapters of volume 1 then closed your manga reading program, didn't you?    You keep projecting.    I literally paid for hard copies.  What do you think the manga did better, besides fanservice?    Would you want a S3? K-On restart was kind of shit to be honest but KyoAni could work its magic and turn turd into gold like they did with Lucky Star    I don't think you know what that means    I'd watch it         Most of the new characters are just too unlikeable    I did too. Have you actually read yours? Or did you just buy them for completeness?     Nobody cares, you fucking faggots.      Suddenly, this became a cringe thread.     Jesus Christ lad you are literally autism incarnate  All of you read back on your arguments now and ponder on how fucking stupid you sound      I really need to know the word for that thing I was describing earlier.       plato   clannad   Well that explains it  Now post pictures of a scale with you guys on it so we can all go to bed             55144   55244  Holy shit       Are you dissing Clannad, sonny? Also 180lbs. Let's bet the other guy is twice that or half that.    K-On reignited my love in drumming   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jDn<wbr>gvBMT2Zc</wbr>  [ ]        Sorry not really into stuff that was actually intended for girls     So you haven't played it, or probably even watched the anime. Why are you even around here again?   The mosaics have an ever better fashion sense.    For the drummers here, any of you play/played in a band? Or do you just drum out covers     Do they have an anime adapted by a studio whose fanbase aren't retards?     It was a joke kiddo     Good for you. You can still make jokes at whatever the fuck time it is over there. You still haven't touched upon how Clannad is a bad thing.    Too bad they're plain as fuck.    Played for 2 months back in highschool when the official drummer broke his arm          Genuinely would prefer the Mugicuck over this autismal shit       I can't tell if you're insulted KyoAni or Studio Gokumi    Too bad. You picked anime as a hobby.     How far do you think someone would get through self teaching fron the internet?  The video you embedded and from other stuff I've seen in the past is seriously making me consider picking up a drum set tommorow morning, already play guitar if that counts at all        And autism didn't choose you, yadda yadda we've heard it before fagola     That's funny, because all the mosaics are better than both the girls in that picture    Ayaya and Karen maybe but Alice a shit      mentions karen before yoko   Into the trash.        Generic genki redhead  She's alright, but Karen is pretty much the only reason I didn't drop the show outright    I love this thread    show     I hate it     AUTISM INCARNATE, FEAR ME     Is that a confirmation or a denial?     You're unironic autism amuses me anon.  Please enthral all of us and preach your good word, as your misfortune brings joy to me        Trying to compare Kinmosa to K-On!  Not even worth trying.   I don't. Are K-On threads always bad? Every time I've been in one they've been quite shit.         Wait anon do you actually have autism?     Sorry that is a bit of a filthy Americanism, anime then    ditto    Have you ever seen a thread for a KyoAni adaption that was good?    He actually did it the absolute madman!    Don't get me wrong, Alice a shit. But so are Mio and Ritsu    Mio yes but Ritsu is a better genki than Youko     It's funny because hibike threads are shining examples of shit fanbases and they're up as we speak     Protip: a few of those hibikek fans are in this thread right now. Try and point them out.    I took courses for 6 months, the rest was self taught. With the online courses there are today I don't think a live teacher is a necessity, though it helps a lot in telling you what you are doing wrong. With drums you only need to train your brain to use your limbs independently following a rhythm, don't really know how to explain it better. The rest is just muscle memory and training your ears/arms to follow the tempo. Reading drum music sheets is also pretty easy compared to a guitar or piano.  Funny thing I never touched an acoustic drum set before covering for that guy in the band and it took me a couple of weeks to get used to it, with electric drums you don't need to apply much force to get a sound, it also isn't as tiring.  To play something like in that video I'd guess it will take you 8-10 months if you're a complete amateur.           Yeah reading up on it now, seems like picking up a few sticks and a practice pad makes much more sense than buying an actual kit.  Youtube will probably end up being my primary teacher       In S1? Yes. Yoko redeemed herself in S2 though    Do not sexualize the Ritsu, sexualize this seminal sentinel instead.   I wish I could sniff Jun's sweaty butt    sees sexual picture of sexual character   no don't sexualize character   sexualize this character   posts art picture of eccentric lesbian  Can you please explain this?        Electric drum sets can be pretty cheap.      I want to do more than sexualise her. I want to  celebrate her birthday in exactly 1 week   and follow that up by  cooking a delicious meal for  her    Forgot picture    I'll celebrate with you if you come and help celebrate Azusa's on the 11/11    How am I supposed to be romantic if other anons are there?    I thought that was the kind of thing you were into     They ain't real, niggas     I am, but not on her birthday.    Good observation friend, doesn't stop me doing it for her     Mio best girl and best fashion sense.     I love Azunyan, but that shirt is long that, combined with the puffy skirt, makes her torso long and unattractive. Shorter shirt would've been golden    Who's she attracting?     Why are they holding strawberries?     Mio and RItsu have a similar thing, their belts look way too low. I like it though, a lot of Azusa's clothes look slightly too big for her and I find that really cute    There's been a k-on thread for 5 hours, and I didn't even know about it   I always thought that said "don't forget here"   Fuck I just watched the last episode of season 2 and it really hit me. Now I just need to watch the extras. Is the movie set after graduation? They never foreshadow it.   The film is set during and between the last few episodes, the OVAs show them getting passports and stuff    the end of the movie is really sad, man    It's the same as the end of the series   Season 3 when?   We would have got one if not for Tamako Market    This anon knows what he's talking about.   In terms of wife material  Mio &gt; Mugi &gt; Ui &gt; Azusa &gt; Nodoka &gt; Sawako &gt; Ritsu &gt; Jun &gt; Yui     Honestly Tamako Market was better than the rest of the K-On manga.    Well there's an azusa-lite    A lot of things were better than the K-ON manga, the question is would KyoAni be able to pull off the same with the sequel manga as they did with the original series    The perfect waifu/daughteru combination   Ritsu looks slutty.   fuck off. you look slutty      Sluts are delicious    Why are the Keions so short? Are they midgets?   Just dress like a girl.   Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present  /ai/ - Idle Activities .   Oops    How does it feel that your shitty PG idol show can never beat Love Live? Aikatsu can't even lace up WUG's boots. Aikatsu is just a footnote to idol anime.    If it's so shitty, why are you drawing fan art for it?     Now this is my kind of anime.  Wait, so they're saying they seriously never noticed that Yugi changed into a completely different person until he literally pointed it out to them?   8 days   8 volumes   Tonight, a chinese dude dukes it out with a nigger while a jap and  an Indian  watch.

I feel like she'd have an older voice though.                          I always found it odd that they brought up this Houkagen place but never touched upon it.  Also, my net is really bad tonight so apologies.                   You gon' make it, Anon. Ganbatte!       Net disconnects every 4 to 5 seconds  This is worse than that time I dumped Umaru-chan              Player 2 Tora? is it blue instead of orange?       Not sure. I think it's black but I guess it can be blue.                                                                                   What the hell                      My dick is resounding to her     Delicious oppai         Those evil eyes are too lewd                  Uh... how exactly the three blades left scars so small and close? I mean, it doesn't really match       They streched.    Yeah, sure...         Its the little things      Well, yeah. When he steched them they became thinner and stuck closer together.  I don't even know why anyone would want these sorts of blades above his nose. Seems impractical to hit people with.          Guren's design always bugs me. I mean, those blades, really? Won't it hurt? Aren't they inconvenient?      Same here honestly. It's just so weird looking at it.                   That must be the best Asako's outfit so far.     I should make a compilation.       That would be really nice.            I'm glad the time bakemono is back, its power is too useful to just forget about him.     I like how they actually have a legit excuse to use flashbacks.                                 hurt   African people are ok with this kind of things.                            So the original plan was to end here there as it signalled the end of that Arc while this one is the opener of the Final Act.  Unfortunately, if I don't post this now I won't have enough space for next thread.  So yeah, here begins the final ride.       TV Special : https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4UM<wbr>hGZ-_Ha0</wbr>  [ ]         God damn do I love these breather chapters. Too bad they'll cut most of them.               this is from elementary school.   He has got even worse, probably.       I forgot to thank you anon. I picked it up back when you posted first volume and read it in 3 days.. It was really nice ride. There are 2 things I didn't understand or perhaps like. First is  memory wipe  Why it didn't work on Tora? Second why did  Bro  turn out to be  evil ? Was it lust for power or challenge?       And when I think nothing can be worse than Ushio's art, this thing appears.    Jesus.      As with a lot of things, I don't know. Maybe Hakumen's minion either got killed or jsut assimilated with Tora's body knowing that they're both sorta the same.    I'll get into it more when I do that but it's more that. One, he wanted to battle Tora so it was the only way for him to feel a challenge. Second, I quote Tora on Hakumen, "Humans like Ushio shine so brightly... He longed for that brightness...He wanted to so much to be like them...Nagase knew he couldn't be like Ushio..."  The guy wanted eyes like Ushio's. Eyes that held light. He thought that to obtain this he needed a challenge which was Tora.  He knew he was a villian to the core. He was scared and envious of Ushio's hope. He honestly would've changed if he stayed with Ushio but in the end, what he believed himself to be, made him choose HnM       Well, I may be wrong. I'll get more to it when we get there.           14 years old          So pretty.       Oh boy here we go.       Cheers anon.   Now that you mention it, thing about Tora makes complete sense. Minions weren't killed and even if they were, they would keep coming like after white girl and scientist. Tora assimilating them makes sesne when we thinkg about HnM origin. There might also be thing, that Tora-like monster are past users of beast spear, so maybe it protected them? But then the other wouldn't turn into stone, so we go back to origin argument.   It's kinda twisted, but makes sense. I left my guard down and expected easy, straightforward answer about his character in manga. I should try rereading it. Now I recall Nagase saying it was only way to make Tora fight him seriously.                  Time for memory wipe and wind up to the final battle and military fucking everything up.                       Because you are even more tsun than her.       There may not be a next year for me  YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY<wbr>YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY<wbr>YYYYES YES YES YES Go for it!  This is why you don't read drama or harem, it ruins that      </wbr></wbr>                                     Oh shit.       This series seems like a longer and lighter version of Igyoujin Oniwakamaru.      It is sorta aimed for young boys back at the time.    It's already translated.  Why is he so pink?  My name is Anon E. Mouse and I like to go bowling.  Why? Like Washizu is still alive so I know why he has his series, but why would you make a manga about your series' first antagonist when he's been defeated twenty years ago and the anime with him in it aired seven years ago  I mean tonegawa was cool but comon FKMT have some focus.   They can translate some knock-off but can't finish translating the original chapters of kaiji?    That entire fucking first chapter   This is Tonegawa isn't being paid enough to do this shit: The Manga.    Somehow I can see what he is talking about.  Kaiji season 3 fucking when?   The guy who made the music got busted for weed, so that poisoned the property for TV forever. Go watch videos of the pachinko game.      The guy who made the music got busted for weed  Isn't this like the 3rd time this happens to OST composers in the past few years?     So he didn't do the story or the art. What did he do?   I'm not sure this is a good idea but I'll read anything Fuku writes anyway.    that poisoned the property for TV forever.  Got a citation for that m8? Same guy was also the composer for Akagi. And there's an Akagi live action that starts airing this month. That's some potent poison there.         so that poisoned the property for TV forever.   For who? The fans?  You'd think the people reading a manga about gambling, debts, failure and wasting your life away wouldn't make such a big deal out of smoking pot.        It's Japan   Why are all his chapter titles just two characters?   Tonegawa &amp; Ichijo escape from hell?   It's funny but I refuse to see it as canon, it's more like a Kaiji parody. Tonegawa and Hyoudou act completely out of character, so don't expect a spin-off that really explores their mindsets.  Where can I get this chapter? Can't find it.  This wasn't drawn by Fukumoto? They really nailed his art style.  So it's basically a SoL featuring Tonegawa dealing with corporate stuff. I guess it'd be a nice change of pace until  he comes back with Ichijo in the main manga     Bowling arc confirmed   Why do they translate this spinoff while kaiji ain't even translated   he hates it   didn't the original tonegawa look nothing like this    because you can watch the anime  or just learn moon you degen gamblers.       That's not what actually happened though, unless someone can prove the contrary. Fun fact, from what I can find on the net, Hideki Tanuchi's arrest/imprisonment has virtually gone unreported, it's very likely that fans who didn't go around searching for info aren't even aware of it. It wasn't a big scandal or anything, just a minor and not that uncommon arrest. Musicfags probably are more aware of the event than animefags are.     Nigga what? Even part 1 kaiji looked nothing like the current one besides the long nose Fukumkoto got his shit together with his designs at the E-card arc     Reposting from previous thread:  【124校歌斉唱】  ・屋台の借り出し  田所が北条の所に行って借りてくる。北条は別の模擬店を手伝う模様。北条の<wbr>近況は店の従業員と打ち解ける   ・準備期間佳境  イサミ、田所の肩を持って支える  タクミイサミ、友人たちと出店。目抜通り  アリス、潮見教授を懐柔  ソーマ、フージャオピン(台湾料理)の試作、親父との回想あり。石釜に貼り<wbr>付けて焼くスタイル   ・開会式  アリス組、葉山と黒木馬は振り回されて体力消耗(何をやらされたかはふめい<wbr>  司、ももちゃん、竜胆、久我のシーンあり。  校歌斉唱(みんな歌えるのに驚くソーマ  久我は司に約束がある模様  開幕   終わり   Stolen from MH:   -Title is 'singing the school song' -Megumi goes to borrow the cart from Houjou.

You mean fuck? also i want to see Megumi's pussy wrecked by fat italian dick.   Wasn't this supposed to be fake  Rindou and Momo in tis week chapter? This arc seem like a candidate to become best arc of the series.    Isami is supporting Megumi's shoulder   Is this the new ship that's setting sail?      Its legit.    No, I just want to see him intentionally fluster her with a bit of  handholding  or a  kiss on the cheek.      Hayama and Kurokiba are tired after being dragged around to do things by Alice (what they did is not known)     Jun's strategy to reject sonzoned Akira without hurting his feelings = sell him to bored rich girl     for characters that have literally no personality   and the scene is going to focus on Tsukasa and koga      Well, I was joking anon, no need to take what I said seriously.    Also makes him spend time with one of his only two 'friends', Kurokiba. Jun's a great mother.     manga is giving some Isami/Megumi.   drama cd is pushing Takumi/Megumi.   W-what should I do?  Should I just follow my heart?       Isami was also present during the drama CD, Anon.   Follow your heart.      So Soma &amp; Megumi will have two carts?   What if mad dog hooks up with Megumi? And Alice with Curry? Wouldn't that be a better outcome?     Curry and Alice   let's be pretentious TOGETHER       I like Souma/Megumi but I'm no shipper, if they don't end up together I don't give a fuck. I'm just here for the shokugeki.   Curry belongs to Jun.         Mad dog with someone else than Alice   Go sleep anon, you are drunk.      Curry is a slut.     Alice with Curry  how exactly is it a better outcome anon ? Care to cite examples     Because it wouldn't make sense for Curry to fuck Jun, due to their massive age gap. And with Alice surprisingly choosing to team up with Curry, who's to say sparks wouldn't fly between them?     due to their massive age gap  It's hot, and japan approves of raising your own wife/husband.     How about Curry and Megumi instead. She's his type.    They don't have a history together, unlike mad dog has with Megumi. Their polarizing characters could mesh well there.   What if  only Souma gets a partner in face of Erina, all other characters end up alone?    who's to say Alice isn't already being filled to the brim with Mad Dog Genes erry night    Once Curry graduates, Jun would be close to 40. So no, that wouldn't pan out.    She looks like the type to change partners like girls changing wardrobes.    Not likely. I can see us getting an epilogue of all the characters getting together for a reunion, with their respective partners and kids.    since his father mentioned in a monologue that he has to get a woman to advance his cooking I am all but certain that he can only hook up with god-tongue to reach the stars   I am also shipping IsamiXMegumi as hard as I can        SnS gaiden with kids of main characters     You know what makes him so mad? His constant blue balls.     Taiwan   You mean Republic of China?      she's a SLUT no wonder Ryou's always pissed. he's normal mode is probably the " i don't care anymore face ".      Curry and Alice     /pol/ pls go.     Implying its not done on purpose   Implying Mad dog doesn't break her like a lobster when he finally snaps    Implying this doesn't happen   DOUJINS FUCKING WHEN?!        Tosh has to do it. He's the only one capable of drawing out such a scenario. I'm not surprised if he has a stash of SnS porn, waiting to be released, once his contract with Jump's up.   This is so fucking retarded, but why did I watch everything and catch up with the manga?   Their babies would look magnificent, think about it. A win-win for both.    It's okay because she looks like a loli.    Curry wouldn't be happy once she reaches menopause.    How did this pairing even happen?   Do you think Alice is gonna flirt with curry in front of mad dog to make him jealous? I really want to see this happen.   That's what I am wondering about, too. Isami has had little to no contact with her, &amp; yet there's fanart of them, coming out from nowhere.    but curry is into his stepmother.    Ryou doesn't really care about romance. So I don't think it'll matter to him, at all. Whereas for Curry, he wouldn't be so easily swayed by her; guy's as faithful to Jun as a doting husbando.    Since fujos like SoumaxTakumi, they pair Isami and Megumi as well.    Megumi is Souma's support. Isami is Takumi's support. SoumaxTakumi-&gt;IsamixMegumi      Ryou couldn't care less, Alice would just look like a retarded slut. Trying to make someone not interested in romance be jealous.       Ryou   Giving a fuck that is not alice        we don't really know how Ryou feels about Alice, he was all "for milady" in tournament, but it's more like he's proud of both their skills and doesn't see her romantically. It will happen though, I have no doubt about it.      I want to pair Takumi with  Fumio　　　    Nope. Ryou has a fetish for 'weaklings' like MehGoomy.   Yuuki probably has a larger chest than Megumi. I only know she notices Ryouko obviously outclassing her though.  So he attacks mainland China food with Taiwan food? Nice.   Takumi &amp; Isami open a stall with friends in the street district   Takumi &amp; Isami    having friends  fake spoilers confirmed       super chinese restaurant vs cart   China vs Taiwan  It's perfect.      Takumi is an autist, but Isami is pretty sociable guy.   Quit spamming already. This isn't the waifu thread, and posts like it get contained for a reason. It's roll crap too.  What should I make for lunch?  Nothing too hard please, I'm a beginner     They are probably Isami's friends.    Wonder what sort of spin he'll add to it?     Mapo Doufu    did chuuka ever cover modified styles outside of china?   Raku?!    They're high school freshmen, plenty of time still to make memories together.   Thanks, janitor/mod-kun.  Anyway, how long until we have canon confirmation of Ryou/Alice? There's no way they aren't already fucking like rabbits.     No, Yugi    Is Kuga the penultimate Yugi lookalike?     A scene with Tsukasa, Momo, Rindou,Kuga   Singing the school song (Soma is surprised everyone can sing the school song)   Kuga has made some sort of promise with Tsukasa   Tell me more. It's getting interesting for the 2nd graders to interact with the 3rd graders, as we never seen it in the E10 intro.       So from all the dishes they made in the anime which one is the easiest to do in real life?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127157071   xD    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127157071  I meant chicken breast*   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127157071   xD  Where do you come from? Leddit? Tumblr?    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127157071   xD  Fuck off faggot.     Takumi's only an autist around Souma. He's pretty cool otherwise.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127157130  It's obviously a preview and not a scan. Sucks for you, Ryou.   I know Hong Kong sort of has a presence for different dishes, never really saw Taiwan. Don't really know how much each location considers themselves as being away from China. IIRC HK may pretty much be China though.   Hong Kong is officially part of China since 1997. As for Taiwan, it depends on how you view it, people can argue it all day long.     I made the steak with onions, shit is easy to do, though I didn't follow the recipe for the fried onions and sauce because I didn't understood how to make it, and how much wine to put and I didn't have soy sauce. Still it was pretty cool.    Takumi doesn't interact with other characters much, but he was pretty awkward around Hinako too.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127157264  You can't use emoticons on /a/, except ;_;    It's how the people think though. For example even Chinese hate how language should be used. There are "HK" dishes but I don't know if they should be part of the "Chinese whole", even if HK people don't want to be a part of China. Too much potential drama to be understood I guess, so I'll stop giving a fuck.     -Isami is supporting Megumi's shoulder  Tsukuda preparing Megumi's rebound for after eventually not winning Somabowl?    Ha, talking about going on a roll    This:   I found most of them in Souma/Takumi imagedumps.       Did he interact with Hinako without Souma present at one point?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127157351   I miss old /a/.      &gt;manga is giving some Isami/Megumi.   &gt;drama cd is pushing Takumi/Megumi.   W-what should I do? Should I just follow my heart?  I see. Someone figuratively needs to die!       I loved how so casually and without realizing they friendzoned the sluts.    Why do random girls call Aldinis by their first names? Isn't it a big deal in Japan?    I think they make an exception for twins.     It's how the people think though. For example even Chinese hate how language should be used. There are "HK" dishes but I don't know if they should be part of the "Chinese whole", even if HK people don't want to be a part of China. Too much potential drama to be understood I guess, so I'll stop giving a fuck.   Well Hong Kong and Macau (&amp; perhaps others) are basically States whose Rights to Statehood were taken away by sheer pressure. (Nice small State you have there, would be a shame if something were to happen to it. Do you want to defend it, or can we take it.)  Taiwan is basically China's Original Government in Exile.  Republic of China ... Can only act on Taiwan, because they were unable to hold the Mainland. Peoples Republic of China ... Current communist rulers of the mainland           They have the same surname so what would they call them?    These chapters are the best in the manga, I hope we get another soon.    Aldini-kun and Aldini-kun? Souma calls both Erina and Alice just "Nakiri".   Threadly reminder about the best girl   To be fair, these two are essentially perfect for each other.  New OTP achieved.     Why? I don't even see the chemistry between both of them.    Both are after Soma's dick and will get friendzoned forever. You can't get more similar than that.    Well, Souma just doesn't give a fuck and call them Nakiris(Nakiri-tachi, I presume? don't have the raws) when they are together. When you have two or more people with the same surname together it's acceptable to just use their first names.    Nakiri-s is just Souma speak. There isn't a facet of that in the Japanese grammar.     Isami   after Souma's dick  Wrong Aldini, mate.      http://imgur.com/a/a8NNl He essentially says it in English.     actually anon the characters are pretty versatile they could interact with the other characters and they could have a very interesting chemistry between them cept for Erina she seems to only show those amazing reaction faces to Hisako, Alice and Souma     New OTP achieved.  This.     It'll become a VERY big deal once Erina addresses Souma by his first name, &amp; vice versa. Expect the MehGoomyfags to be on suicide watch once that happens.    Is weird since Isami is more irrelevant than fucking meat.    So we have Isami-Megumi, Alice-Ryou and Akira-Jun. Still need some more.    How soon would that be?    I predict Isami to beat Takumi at least once during the story.    Best arc   How do you think about my Otp /a/nons?    Isami will win Mezzaluna back from Souma     I predict Isami to be the better Aldini once they're out of school.    Not so soon. To call him by his first name would be a VERY big deal to her. She has to fully accept him as a cook &amp; a rival, &amp; has to know who his old man is.    I doubt it will happen to obvious.    Isami has had development hinted at since the Autumn Election.    Get your fucking tumblr-tier fanart out of here.    Like Yabuki?    Yeah, he's as based as Yabuki, IMO.    He'll beat Takumi once to show him how much he's grown and inherit the restaurant so Takumi can look towards higher goals.  He's also going to get expelled for Takumi's growth.      His fat -&gt; slim to slim -&gt; fat gimmick has to stop. He should just remain slim, for the rest of the story. MehGoomy doesn't like fat guys, I'd reckon.    Why would he get expelled?    It's OK.     Forcing her adopted son to pretend like he has friends  Jun a cute.     God Damn it, I want both of them to release their porn stash already. There is no way in hell they don't have some porn made with their characters.    Isami has a canon childhood European waifu. Takumi always had qts after him but if Isami is wed locked in an OTP, Takumi will be in need of a replacement.  Ergo, you are now realizing that Megumi is literally Japanese Femsami and therefore would be the perfect cheese to his macaroni.  She's gentle, warm, and closely affiliated with Soma. The perfect grill for the runner up bowl.   TakuMegu end is a good end.        it's good, but not the best    L-Lord Slaine ?    Good taste.     Takumi wants a waifu that resembles his brother  That's pretty fucked up Anon.      Takumi jobs to his brother  Well, I won't be surprised. It's kinda sad that Takumi is literally a fucking joke at this point. He is weakest among top-8 and doesn't have any special talent or ability unlike most of them, even his specialization is shit. He only manages to stay kinda relevant thank to fujos, and now when some new fujobaits like Yugi and Eishi are introduced he may lose even that.      I made the Nanchatte Roast Pork and it was surprisingly easy to do.    Lets get real, those 2 will never fuck. Mostly because Hinako is a loser and Shinomiya an autistic faggot.  Just like Soma and Megumi    Where the fucking spoiler pics?   Tomorrow.    Fuck you. Either Megumi ends up with Souma, or she dies a spinster. Muh girl ain't gonna have some dirty Italian cock shoved into her pure pussy.     Lets get real, those 2 will never fuck    Just like Soma and Megumi   Lets get real  anon, pls stop with the delusions already      don't they light novels written by the manga author ship Alice and Ryou pretty hard? and also Hinako and Shinomiya. I have no doubt they will happen at some point.   Takumi is not terrible enough to be compared to Slaine.   I want to fuck her so bad.    don't they light novels written by the manga author ship Alice and Ryou pretty hard?   The manga itself does, anon. I've said this before, but in what world would 2 hormone-filled, attractive, extremely close and competitive 15 year olds who live under the same roof not be on each other like white on rice?       If I remember correctly volume 3 has a chapter about Ryou and Alice at Christmas in Copenhagen, they even go to a amusement park together. After that she asks him to go to Japan with her.  Translations never.     I want more Hisako and Kurokiba fire! They need to clash more often   She isn't on his level, lest we forget. She got her arse kicked badly by Curry.      Well Kurokiba got his ass kicked by Curry too.    Kyya so cu-cute!    By the power of LOVE    Marginally. If Hisako wants to prove her worth, she should Shokugeki with Curry again.    Megumi is weaker than him. And he'll be fine. He was Souma first rival and the one who made him realise why his dad sent him to Tootsuki after all, the author has plans for him.     !  Fuck off back to tumblr.      not posting the "shut up"panel  One job, anon.      Copenhagen   amusement park  Tivoli?      the judges agreed that the 3 dishes were equally delicious, their abilities are on the same level, I doubt Hisako is on that level.   I've never bother with any Souma thread before and I just come here to ask this; you guys agree that Erina is best girl right?   Ryou very barely lost to Curry. Hisako got crushed.    She isn't; Curry totally annihilated her. It was an absolute blowout.  A person who got a 92 didn't even come close to him. That's the level of difference between her tier &amp; the monster-tier (Curry, Souma, &amp; Ryou).  Alice is still a big question mark, since she jobbed pretty badly to Souma. She needs to do something significant to redeem herself.        yes    Enough of the best girl bait. This thread is for serious discussion only, not for filthy secondaries like yourself.     there actually are people who like Erina  Get out shit taste is probably contagiuous.     Fuck off MehGloomyfag.   :^)        secondaries  Nice try but I read the manga too.     Just for you.    Since you said you didn't bother with any SnS threads, you can fuck off from here.    Probably.    Kuro's only special because he's a better cook than all the other aides. Better than Alice, situationally.   Lobster &gt; Megumi = Hisako &gt; Isami &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Hinako      Where did MehGloomy come from?    I'd rank Hisako over Megumi, by some margin.    No. I initially planned to do just that but I think I'll stay after all.    Fuck off with your shitty ranking.    Hisako is stronger than Megumi, and only barely stronger than Isami. She scored an 88 while he scored an 87.     and Megumi is only barely stronger than Isami  Fucked up that sentence.    how can Hisako be so bad when she has someone like Erina near her? I assume she just doesn't want Erina to teach her anything?   She's probably got more technical knowledge than Megumi.  Unfortunately her only real dish so far was rekt so badly by Curry kebab it made her look scrubbier than Houjou.     No, just fuck off with your iie senpai meme.    Have you seen the two in the kitchen? Hisako practices cooking while Erina just dorks around.     And ability, really. What she did to the turtle&gt;what Megumi did to the fish. She's simply better than Megumi.      She got a fucking 92, you tool. It just that she got matched up with the worst possible opponent.    They probably do stuff together when Hisako isn't busy preparing her stuff.    I'll be here as long as you're mad.     Hisako will never be real   even if she was real you wouldn't be worthy     2 more days to go.  Why does Kurokiba doesn't sound like he's talking about food more than half the time he does.   It's reverse power levels Alice's aid is better than her and Erina's aid is obviously weaker than her.    Hoh sorry I forgot "?"    It's already the 26th in Japan, Anon. 1 more day to go.    Half of the time people don't sound like they are talking about food, in general.     red eyes  Ruined.      the only European is a manlet  as expected of Japan.     He has red eyes. In non-bandana form is just that the eye itself gets bigger so the pupil takes more space, but they are red.      Mad dog with Mehgumi    Alice with currynigger  NOPE       SAAAAASUKE     He always had red eyes, like Alice.    His bro is tall, he probably takes after his Japanese mother height-wise.     Since when? He always appeared to have black eyes.     Red.    Well that's hard to spot. Well black eyes would have been better, Alice already has red.    It makes him look like he has blood-injected eyes when he goes bandana mode.    I don't think he will get together with Alice though.    I imagine it would be hell on his liver and stuff.     I doubt it will happen to obvious  Good Taste     Alice is albino. Whether it's an exaggeration on her Danish genes or whether she's got a dermatological deficiency is still up in the air.    You don't see her using a parasol, sun cream or hiding from the sun. Even in the beach episode Erina doesn't mention if she's ok considering her skin, which would be the normal question in that moment. So it's because she takes after her mother.       white hair red eye   must be albino  It's a fucking manga you stupid. Even Souma get red shade on his black hair.      Google search gives no results, is this really 63 Isami?    Use Saucenao.    The LNs are written by the author of the Shinomiya spinoff, but I suppose everything gets the green light from Tsukuda and maybe Tosh    OTP    Yes. Also the pixiv filename is right there. It's the last image.    I thought he had red hair.   Souma Shokugeki against Kurokiba when?   Kurokiba has to take down Hayama first  I get a Vegeta vibe from him      Best girl (Alice) and best boy (ryou) are the only cannon couple     They should just marry already.    ETA for the scans?     Approximately 19 hours.    Is unhealthy to marry the crazy..and theya re both crazy.   Why are the boys in SnS so fuckable?   Such wide hips.    God damn it I hate Topaz and the people that keep using that shit.    But anon, you need to be a little crazy to marry into the Nakiri family.   Yuuki: Can broken japanese really just 'strip away?' Isn't that just weird?   Alice: To marry into the Nakiri house, even that much isn't that weird at all.        Oooh, I want to see Alice's other grandpa    Here, the original version.    car whyfoos when?    yeah, Souma's a redhead.    It's their sparkling personalities.    I remember them being so impressed at Doujima for just sitting around so many of them without issue.   OPT     I miss Fujimura-kun            best girl   wont win         Didn't this got cut?

Pretty much.    Guys either get ripped or have their growth stunted and become eternal shotas.    This. This combo is also what makes the Lovecraft Deck work.    yay? nay?   Replace Saber Dragon with Apex Avian     I tried, and it works a lot better, thanks! I didn't knew that Deskbots were this powerful.      tfw Serena-Sama is Supreme King's daughter   tfw Sora is Johan's son   tfw 5th Dimension   Kaibaland       Beast-eyes  Where are your beasts anon?     Synthesis is shiiiit. You'll be making OERD with Absolute and Odd-Eyes anyways.   Shinjirarenai!   i cant leave him out anon ;_;     Sneak in Silver Claw then.     Replace Saber with Apex Replace Synthesis with Dragoknight Replace MST with Eccentric Archfiend Throw in a Vanities/RoD  Take out the dupes in the extra and throw in Big-Eye, Red-Eyes, Dracosack, Ebon Magician, Trapeze Magician, Cowboy, Castel           This is my last post for tonight, I like how this works. The spiritual whispers are actually not that bad and the pendulums in there are really good, even Synthesis can be surprising. The Odd-Eyes xyz, it's good, it's a free Extra Odd-Eyes. If something can workbetter, please tell me.      tfw you realize all the Odd-Eyes evolutions and Magicians will be used by Yusho     tfw Yusho uses a completely deck comprised of Dark Magicians    tfw Yuyo EGAO's him back after he's spent years in Fusion Dimension Prison      Big-Eye is one of the best R7. Personally I've found DRXD a disappointing R4 to main deck. Both of the Dragonknights are useful when working with Lv4s. Echo Oscillation and Magical Abductor as also decent pendulum support. Aside from that I don't know the deck well enough to comment on improvements.     Everyone use R4R4R4R4R4R4 shit      Yamerooo      running empowered warriors   no empowered armory  Holy flying fucking shit into the trash it goes.         AND you are even running rota for the empowereds alone. Just trash the deck and start over.     So I was thinkin'.  Why isn't there a DT OVA yet?     Because it would turn into this and just be about them before they became monsters or solely about the waifu cards, actually it'd probably just be Nekroz the Anime.    What about Qli since the bans wouldn't exist?  3 vanity, 3 skill drain, 3 scouts, 3 saqlifices      I wouldn't imagine Qlis to be fun, but maybe that's just me. SatellarKnight or IgKnight could work though.   Anime fucking sucks    Apoqliphort's   Not fun  HEY I'M IMMUNE TO ESSENTIALLY EVERYTHING BUT DEATH BY BATTLE DAMAGE, I'M THE LEGAL EGYPTIAN GOD CARDS YOU WANTED AND NOT THE GIMPED ONES YOU GOT      Stop trying to turn /a/ into /v/ friend.   Also anybody know if the D/D/D cards are on any of the online variants?      mfw Zefras are going to appear in the anime   mfw Masumi, Hokuto (he'll be cured), Yaiba, Meiru, and a soon-to-be-revealed character have to work together with their Zefra decks against Academia Invasion: Electric Boogaloo     I don't know, I just don't find Qlis fun. I don't find any of the Meta to be fun honestly. Qlis, Nek, Shad, Satellar, Burning Abyss, etc.   Hell I've been using my Cyber Dragon and Crystal Beats for years now, with updates of course. I'm glad Arc-V has introduced a lot of cards and archetypes that seem really fun, granted half of them aren't even out yet though, but they seem really fun for once.   IgKnight also looks neat, but that may be just more of me liking their card design than anything.        Fairly sure D/D/Ds are on all of them. Only stuff that's behind are some of the DOCS cards.   Christ why do you guys care so much about your stupid card games and fictional animu characters   tfw this plays as Yugo's duel runner powers down for the final time and Yuya walks over to EGAO him   tfw Yugo hugs Yuzu and tells her to find Rin for him   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-DS<wbr>VDcw6iW8</wbr>  [ ]     it is /a/ after all.     Because this is a mongolian tree planting forum, get with it son.      You probably don't like fast TCG's, do you?  Meta is about speed for the most part, maybe you should play Magic if you want something slower?     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127146797  /out/     zefra   anime  It is Sephiram      No I like fast TCGs, and I actually enjoy both YGO/TCG, I just don't care for the decks themselves honestly, not in art design (besides SatellarKnights) or just how they flow. I mean I can blast down cards on Cyber Dragon decks with extreme ease. I'm just picky about how I like to play TCGs sometimes. Certain decks or archetypes in any TCG just don't interest me, whether they're good, bad, or whatever.   Like I wouldn't use Nekroz or Qlis even if they weren't meta, I just don't like the decks.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127146917  jpg as fuck   Are we being raided?   yea by one person    Probably /dng/, just ignore and report whoever it is.     Japanese version   Jounouchi   Jyounouchi   typo  This is funny.       I wonder if Shinji will play these weird aqua monsters.  http://ygorganization.com/solikeali<wbr>engreys/</wbr>     /dng/ already doing Qli 3-koma    Does Shinji even duel? Was his deck visible when he was arrested?     I check message a while to avoid /arc-v/. Look what I got.      You made me curious enough to check. Yeah he's got one.     Does Shinji even duel  He has funky hair and rides a motorcycle.       Jack pls...what would your Duel Runner say?    Oh I see, it is kinda invisible when I watched the first time.   So why does the gang not have Prison Marks?   Fuck off gary stu. He is the closest to male haremlord as we can get. Leave him with girl.      Unlike Yusei, Jack has a canon love interest. He isn't attracted to machinery like Yusei.         fusion   You don't deserve to wave the flag of rebellion.     <br/>   It's shit. Go take a look at some OCG lists and try again.     fusion   Get that dirty shit out of there.      Instant noodles is an XYZ in the wrong color.     Gorz   Random Blackwings   Readiness   Icarus Attack   Mirror force   Armades   Tiras   Rebellion Dragon    Bujin xyz that literally nobody uses but seraphs    Zerofyne  Get this shit out of my face.              Take it elsewhere scum        Am I REVOLUTION yet?         not having Readiness in a RR deck   What are you doing...      TWO FUCKING TWO ASTRAL FORCE        Winning?     Random blackwings  It's Zephyros and bora. Zephyros is a recycle for any face up card, and bora is free if you've got zeph out  Icarus attack  Have you ever played a single winged beast deck in your life?  Complaining about zerofyne  It's one of the best fucking XYZ monsters you idiot. The only reason it's not run is that it's restricted to winged beasts. It also negates their face up s/t.          twice the fusion   Out.      Clearly he needs 3 noodles and 3 noden. That way he can R4 even harder.    How can you be winning if you aren't ready?    Spongebob is ready, do you see him winning?    tfw you know there's an End of Evangelion ending waiting at Academia   tfw you know a lot of people are going to die   tfw you're hoping they stay dead but you know they won't   tfw Arc-V pulled more heartstrings with Teppei than Zexal did through almost two seasons       Yes, he just made a new movie. Do you have a movie out Anon?     tfw Reiji inevitably dies trying to save Serena   tfw Serena dies anyways to fuel the Dimension Machine in a desperate bid by Leo once the rest of the Ruris escape   tfw Shun inevitably dies trying to save Ruri, only for them both to die like Mitchie and Teppie trying to grab each other's hands        implying Shun won't get reverse-OTK'd by Yuri   implying Shun won't get BTFO so hard he mistakes Serena for Ruri in dazed confusion   implying he won't smile and say, "I finally saved you," before turning into a card in Serena's hands       You should not need any blackwings with all the toolbox monsters RRs have. Zerofyne does jack shit in the current meta. Icarus attack is not needed because of your extra.   hurr durr dese good cards  Go and see if OCG lists run that shit and then come back.   Make a choice. Are you controlling the board or dealing as much damage as possible?          no diamond   no pleiades   no exciton   no emeral  3/10 not even trying        Only the strong survive.    Here its how it would go, Hokuto is decarded, Masumi, Hokuto, Yaiba and Meiru find out what is really happening. The group get pushed back by academia. By the power of the "numeron code" or whatever you want to call it, All four of their decks get evolutions. Masumi gets Shaddolls, Hokuto gets Stellarknights Yaiba gets Yang Zings and Masumi gets Nekroz. With their new power, they can fight back. Everything goes their way. pushing back the academia grunts. They meet the boss of the area, but its not enough. One by one, they fall. In the middle of the duel, Yuya shows up, seeing what the boss did to them.  As he's about to get angry, Masumi stops him and tells him to take her deck. Hokuto, Yaiba and Meiru do the same before they pass out. In doing so, Yuya transforms the decks into one deck. opting out of his performapals, he instead uses the newly created deck. to fight with. And tada! Zefras.       trying to grab each other's hands   My heart won't be able to handle that.      Mine wouldn't either. Just imagine the conversation he's going to have to have with her over Yuto.     Yuya   using Zefras   not Magicians/Odd-Eyes       He'll probably tell her that Yuto died an honorable death while trying to save her.    Until she see's Yuya and Yuto comes out for a second and is like "Yo, I'm dead, i got killed by some bananas on a motorcycle."    I swear there's going to be the biggest shit storm ever if Ruri doesn't have blonde hair+pink eyes.    I'm going to love Ruri no matter what she looks like.    Even if she looked like this?    I sort of wish Rin looked like this honestly. Serena and Yuzu could look similar just changing their ponytail/pigtals, but Rin looks really off in comparison.    Eh, I think it's just the hair.   Remember to take good care of your Ruris and make sure they have fun.   Shun is going to lose the Serena bowl because Ruri will think it's disgusting since they look the same. Reiji is going to lose the Serena bowl too because he's too busy stalking her in his Batcave and she'll find it disgusting.    Sawatari will win the Serenabowl because he'll evolve into Neo New Neuvo Sawatari-san.    You, I like you. Out of all the OTPs I've seen they seem like the most opposite to actually get along and help each other honestly, while still being similar gunjumpers.     Ruri will think it's disgusting since they look the same.   The real reason is that she wants Shun all for herself.         His lasts words were fucking "EGAO" instead of "Ruri"   He has no one to blame but himself.      tfw no xyz backstory   tfw no kaito or shark in arc-v yet   tfw no IV to make more memes out of  XYZ arc when      He's still upset that he's the reason she got kidnapped, he just wanted her to smile, instead he hurt her and got her kidnapped.    Never, Heartland is gone and everybody from Zexal is dead.    Never, actually. Xyz was so fucked up beyond recognition that Shun and Yuto never mentioned anyone else as part of the Resistance except for Ruri. You can only hope that one of the Tron's kids is alive because of the RUM cards, but even that is far-fetched considering Synchro Arc is just the director re-hashing memories of a fucked-up series that he wants to give a better resolution to.   We should consider stopping making these threads until the Synchro filler is over, considering there is not much to discuss when it comes to plot advancements, and it has been that way since the crew left Standard.  We can always make the occasional thread.     OR we could talk about why Yuya is so feminine and prevent another Oreimo thread from hitting the front page.    Or you can just stop coming to the threads and let us continue on our merry way.     I like to discuss the Synchro arc though. I love it. Enjoy duel was one of the best duels in the series so far       Fuck off faggot     I did that a long time ago, though. I only pop up on occasion and for live-watching in hopes of something interesting happening. At least Kakihara as Dennis is always worth my time.     KOI KOI KOI KOI KOI KOI KOI KOI ENJOY CHOJIRO CHOJIRO CHOJIRO          Then it shouldn't bother you that we always have a thread up. These threads lasted through Eita. We're here for the long haul. Get over it.     Need webm of his mooks suddenly going KOI KOI     I wouldn't say ENJOY duel was one of the best, but it was still  ENJOYable  I've ENJOYed Bennis vs THE MAN too. Bennis vs Shun was kinda eh, but wasn't too bad.      1. Shun vs. Sora pt. 1 2. Yuya vs. Reiji pt. 2 3. ENJOY 4. Dennis vs. Gon 5. Yuzu vs. Masumi pt. 2 I thought Yuzu was going to be generic tsundere until she decided to nose-dive-deny Masumi an Action Card.          Agreed   It's due to the ChouKoiKoi card itself :p   The epic soundtrack during his turn though... I can't wait for it to be re-used and released (Sound Duel 4 maybe?)          We're just waiting for best Yu-Gi-Oh to show up so bare with it.      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=QiW<wbr>7xNT3YVQ</wbr>  [ ]       5. Yuzu vs. Masumi pt. 2   Still don't get why people are hard over that one. It's Yuzu's only good duel, sure, but it was still mediocre by Arc-V standards       It was okay. I'd put the Yaiba vs Gon duel over it though.     Because we're all waifufags and it had trumpets.    1. Shun vs Sora pt. 1 2. Yuya vs Reiji pt 2 3. Yuya vs Neo New Sawatari 4. Gon vs Yaiba 5. Yuzu vs Masumi pt 2 Here's my opinion which you did not ask.          KOI KOI KOI     Fucking shit.     Calm yo tits anon.      Also   Yuya vs Gon   Yuya vs Reiji pt 1   Shun vs LDS trio   Yuya vs Kachidoki   Yuya vs Sora pt 2   Yuya vs Mieru   Yuto vs Yugo              Doubtful, their set numbers make it impossible for them to be anime cards    Until we see 72 goatse threads everything is fine, huh?     But anon, trumpets make everything better.     make a .webm of KOI KOI   file too large   head to pomf   pomf is kill  no      Context?   Maxfiles.   So the moral of last episode was that burn/lockdown strategies are bad, except for all those times the main character won the exact same way. Also, not relying on the luck of the draw is bad, except for all those times etc etc     aki keeps bugging yusei for sex   doesn't think he'll ever say yes   yusei finally says yes   aki becomes flustered and refuses to have sex  Also Yusei's got a 10 inch dick so it's not exactly unreasonable for her to refuse.        The moral is BELIEVE IN YOUR DRAWS.     26.3cm x 12.9cm  Oh my God.     What are everyone else's?    fuwa.se   Remember the time Yusei and Aki had a one night stand and she ended up getting pregnant with his kid?   wut    Jack will never be a singke dad with a qt daughter    Good.   LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL    "Life Is Beauty" Howl     Pendulum Climax  Does Yuya play that card against Yuzu at their sleepovers?    He said the same thing in his Meiru duel. "Here comes the climax."    Reminder GX did a Climax first.  http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Climax<wbr>_Hour</wbr>      "Docking strength with courage to protect the earth's peace! Synchro Summon! Envoy of love and justice, Power Tool Dragon!"   Why does Rua always sound like a magical girl?       completely missing the point of a webm   3 frames long  Yeah, no. The OP is right to go with gif, idiot.      Because she is.     tfw Reiji inevitably dies trying to save Serena  You know, I always thought of it the other way around. Serena dies and gets absorbed by Yuzu, after finally thanking Reiji about what he did the first time they ever met and repaid that debt.  This event will either trigger Reiji's character to get better or worse.         edge Reiji   I want to see       And besides what Reiji did the first time they met, she'll probably thank him for the opportunity of becoming a Lancer, since inevitably, the REAL reason why she wants to prove herself and be part of the army back in Academia is because she wants to be able experience true friendship with comrades and fight alongside them because she never had friends in all her life.     Reiji pls    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127153869  ONS ARE CUTE   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127153927  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127153950  NNIS IS BEST BOY    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127153877  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127153913  SEN LOST TORNADO!     Yugioh has always been inconsistent with what strategies are "bad". Burn especially, depending on the episode it's either good or cowardly    I think mill decks are never good.    To be fair, Mill decks are never actually good in the actual game either.    Used a team strategy that clears the opponent's field of cards and sends all of the opponent's cards on the hand to the Graveyard   Gets called weak by Shun   LDS trio loses         Literally Team Unicorn  If Masmi had ended her turn without doing anything, Shun wouldn't have been able to use dimension xyz and the LDS trio would have gotten three turns in a row again      mfw carded people are frozen forever and irreversible. show goes on and they are forgotten about.       SHOW MUST GO ON     YES! I AM ENTERTAINER!    I am not trashing the deck just because you said it anon. So NO.  I'll just try using Empowering Armory because is algo a target for Northwemko plus the ATK increase.       Not saving Olga and BENKYONINARIMASU  Hell no they are freed at the end or this series is DROPPED.      dropping the series because of two background characters  topkek     Team Unicorn were treated like honorable duelists who believed in teamwork and were worthy of Jesus Fudo's respect and they used mill   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127155162  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127155185  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127155197  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127155199   keeps going after getting broken  You are an insult to slowpoke       would you like to play against Sakuya? also Red Daemons Tea is best tea https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_Qk<wbr>NCIUQKGc</wbr>  [ ]    Any suggestions for this lvl1 piperghostrick rank-up deck?  stop     I try.     rip   Seriously now, I don't understand why they are weak by that show's standards. Hokuto alone I can understand, but their combo was fucking strong.     shun you couldn´t protect ruri and you didn´t help yuto when he needed you stop brave claw revolutioning and just calm down you solitary confinement stricken siscon.      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127157192  hy don´t you stop already     Did the latest episode was made by a Korean studio? Why they do so much QUALITY?    They only put effort to animation when its about Ruris or Shun.    Why are these people permitted to breathe my oxygen?     Shun in the shadows   LDS trio in the light   This is the last time they spoke as duelists.       Why not fix it instead of just bitching about it?     "fixing" wikishit  that's like fixing terminal brain cancer with a bandaid    say goodbye to your boners    Fucked up the type of stockings  I'm triggered    Castel is really annoying. Why did they make it real?    YUZONG      Did the latest episode was   Why they do  Were YOU made by a Korean studio, anon? Jesus Christ.      the bracelet is shit as well       Why are all Yuzu cosplayers fat?      Why are all Yuzu cosplayers fat?  Because the only place with girls that gives a shit about Arc V outside of Japan is Tumblr, and for some reason I havent seen any Japs cosplay Yuzu    So what could I improve?   You should ask: Why did they make strong so-easy to make generic Rank 4s that most decks can find a place for?    I ask myself that everyday.    remove tell add castel  remove one galilei add one Kaiser remove one seal add eradicator  one for one can summon kepler for a covenant search without wasting a normal summon  dont take this too seriously. i'm a scrub             Opinions here Take out one Galilei or Leonidas, put another CEO. Take out crush card virus, with decks like clownblade roaming around it's best saved for sidedeck. Put in Slime, it's amazing in DDDs.  You need to search constantly, so even if it is good against certain decks, take mistake out of teh main deck. The new trap covenant is not so hot. I'd replace it with two trade ins(it;s why you add another CEO) Not sure what the last two traps are, but you should consider having at least one instant fusion for noden. Triggers Alexander/tenmujin, makes rank4s and synchro level 7. Take out Red Eyes XYZ and put chaos king Archfiend. Tell is not so bad, but you will rarely use him. I'd put in eitehr castel or moonlight rose dragon             Odd Eyes Pendulum Dragon may be the best partner in the franchise.Through I'm rather curious where Yuya got it from. Odd Eyes Dragon, Stargazer Magician and Timegazer Magician look like somethin Yusho would use going by that monster in his opening.   ENJOY   They don't even do that anymore. Have they run out of budget already?    -2 Galilei -1 Leonidas -1 Lilith -3 Upstart Goblin -1 Virus +2 Hell Armageddon +2 Swirlal Slime +3 Trade-In +1 Emptiness           Surprised TCG banlist has not hit us yet    -3 seal mistake +1 Valkyrie +1 Bottomless +1 Compulsory -3 upstarts +1 Allure of Darkness +1 Swaying Gaze +2 Ogre +1 Kaiser -2 Escape from Dark Dimension +1 Kaiser -1 Leonidas +1 Resourcemanagement                Yuto's fantastic technique failed against his evil twin brother, Shun's rank 7 is Raid Raptor Stegotchi, Yugo is an unofficial red, and Aki is space police/Shun's younger sister.    Shit also throw in a Solemn in there    Did Sound Duel 3 launch already?    Masumi   Twice   You mean Mieru, right?      Which is worst newgioh or smogon    https://mega.co.nz/#!LoVF0TCS!cqEEM<wbr>2uRbEIgMffQl0d0A04TxjktM6m2J8sEKgYF<wbr>OjE  You rented a new rock m8?  </wbr></wbr>    a DM deck. Could use some advice.  We're less than two weeks away from the new anime season, which means it's time again to take a good look at what we're getting next season.  Although the regular anime preview charts work as a decent quick look at the season, they don't tell you all the information you need to know. Obviously a lot of this information is readily available if you look for it, but most people are understandably lazy when it comes to getting all the info on every single one of the 30+ anime coming out, so I've done it for you.     Why is a city on Mars ruled by Japan? How does Japan factor into the running of Tokyo 4 and the lives of its people heavily enough that it can tell them what to do?   Not so long ago, the American colonies couldn't even tolerate being ruled from Britain, and that's much closer than the distance from Japan to Mars.      25 shows including the leftovers from last season  Looks like I won't be making much progress in working on my backlog this season    Idk I'm finding shows that seem more promising than usual. This looks like season to be reckoned with. Dragonball is coming back for godsakes!    Yes. With how good this seasons looking I'm not picking up any mediocre tier anime.    who care? it is going to fuck up and sell like shite   Zero no Tsukaima LN Continuation Confirmed  http://www.zero-tsukaima.com/      Dat ZR using garter and dem details of her small delicious body  I want. That is one good and sexy fig.    New season when?   This. Let best girl win.    Sir, are you aware you have objectively shit taste?     Why does Alex suck so much?  Even a retarded ginger teenager did better them him. Even with out magically flying swords, Shirou did better at deflecting with his sword play.  Alex had less sword projectiles to deal with, and he still got skewered, even before he got chained up.         Gil's different priorities in every route  The only time where his priorities are made clear was during UBW. He was tagging along with Kirei in Fate and got eaten by Sakura in HF. Again, you're supposed to read the three routes in order, but hey, who the fuck cares when you can just read the wiki?     During which one? Because under UBW the chains would at best temporarily restrict him for a few seconds, if not outright deflected completely.    Probably because UBW is where kerry's ideal is realized. They want to appeal to the people who only have watched F/Z.     Socrates  Aristotle, you plebeian.    Shirou has plot armor because he's the MC. Alex doesn't.  eeyore-ee   Adorable.
