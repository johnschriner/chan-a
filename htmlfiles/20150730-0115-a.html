But instead of hanging out in a tea club room shooting the shit all day, these little school girls get into fucking tanks and shoot each other with live rounds (according to the beginning of the second episode they're live rounds - I'll find out for sure in a bit I'm sure). It's pretty weird so far.</br>  <br> weirdest <br><br><br> not Warthunder </br></br></br></br>  Eh, it's a girl sports anime.

For an example, the mighty jingles.  <br>That's because for some reason in USA, Katyusha has copyright on it in, so they would have to pay for the rights who ever owns it.</br>  <br>thanks america</br>  <br>Everyone can appreciate a fun underdog story.</br>  <br>Well it is a 64 player game with lots of vehicles, though I don't really find the HUD as bad as BF3, and you can edit the hud now.</br>  <br>Because in the USA, all former CCCP copyrights were not recognised. And when the cold war ended, some fuckwit allowed someone to copyright those songs in the USA even if they were public domain in their country of origin AND they were not the authors.<br>And if you think that's stupid, have a polite reminder that the lyrics of "Happy Birthday To You" are NOT in the public domain in the USA. Google it.</br></br>    <br> watching the dub <br>it's your own fault, faggot.</br></br>  <br>I couldn't even make it though the first episode of the dub.

If someone wanted to play a commie song, they would have to get permission from the copyright holder, and the copyright holder would never give them permission.</br>  <br>Illiteracy</br>  <br>And that (which can easily be verified with a simple google search), my friend, is the reason the Japanese guys right flat out refused to deal with that people to "license" a public domain song for the US release of GuP. So Sentai had to go with the Tetris song instead (which is actually a public domain Russian folk song about a girl named Katyusha, too,, so give them a little break; for ONCE they're not the bad guys for their horrible release).<br><br> I'm just waiting for an English (as in, UK) dub to be made without that "fake copyright" nonsense </br></br></br>  <br>Now I'm kinda afraid of such laws shoved into my throat if TPP comes into effect.<br>I want to get off this nightmare.</br></br>  <br>Jingels is an old pedo creep, of course he is into anime.</br>  <br> surfaces devoted to trees and buildings <br> not growing crops </br></br>  <br>Or blindness.<br>Seriously, my wfe is blind and can't watch subsbed anime with me, and when she heard teh dub, she refused to keep watching it. <br>This particular dub is as terrible as a few selected ones are legendary. Did you know, the French dub of Porco Rosso is so good, Miyazaki (the very author) retconed it as the new original? Well, if there are isolated examples of dubs THAt good, there has to be isolated examples of dubs simetricaly bad; and GuP"s is that one.</br></br></br>  <br>shutup nerd</br>  <br>that guy has a sick GuP collection.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=s97<wbr>tRKvpdSo</wbr>  [ ]<br>I can just imagine all the guys who are on here thinking "who the fuck is jingles?"</br></br></br>  <br> hasn't watched OVA 3 </br>  best girl  The best part about this show was the uncomfortable glee my imouto displayed while watching it.

Prove me wrong.  <br>30% was Arc(normal) when she's using 70% of her power to suppress her blood-lust, 6% is after Shiki cuts her into little chunks iirc.</br>  The White Princess. She is the Ultimate One.  <br>I thought the 30% was post Shiki-gibbing?</br>  It's ORT until a stronger TYPE shows up.  <br><br> None of the Necos <br><br>What a shit ranking.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seriously?<br>ORT.<br>Conditionally? <br>Tohno fucking Shiki</br></br></br></br>  <br> Type Pluto <br> implying Pluto is a planet </br></br>  <br>THIS<br><br>Lancelot ftw</br></br></br>  <br>After losing 1 arm Giglamesh should have gone all out on him instead he decides to keep acting like a fucking rtarded</br>  <br>She was already using 70% of her power before the events of Tsukihime as the growing strength of her bloodlust just increased as time passed since she was created close to 1000 years ago. Shiki cutting her up decreased that remaining 30 to around 7 percent after having to stitch herself up again. Then as her arc proceeds, she loses even more energy trying to stop Shiki from getting killed by Roa Shiki.</br>  If there is a Type Moon, does that mean there is a Type for every moon of Jupiter and Saturn?    wouldn't Void Shiki be potentially stronger than Types?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Her face just says "Fuck with me. Just fucking try."</br>  <br>Probably.<br><br><br>Not even Void can kill a Type, even with her MEoDP.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No. Her eyes have a distinct limitation that will prevent her from killing Types. Age.</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>Emiya can't trace EA</br>  <br>No, Types do not have a concept of death unless they are in the RM of their home planet.</br>  Fate is a clusterfuck of inconsistency because Nasu is an uncaring hack. Enjoy arguing "objectively" over something that objectively has no objectivity.  <br>Probably.

The characteristics of the characters in "MELTY BLOOD" had either been exaggerated or restrained from what they had been in Tsukihime." <br><br> "Using cards as an example, Shiki of Tsukihime would be a 3 of Hearts. But the Shiki of "MELTY BLOOD" would be able to fight normally as a Jack of Spades." <br><br>They go "Well Shiki can probably kill Shirou, and Shirou is as strong as the strongest servant, so Shiki is stronger than the strongest servant and is as strong as hundreds of humans together"<br><br>Its an entire point that Shirou was never servant tier, even at his peak he says directly he cannot hope to match any servant but Gilgamesh, and he can only match that one due to heavy compatibility match up. Even the anime lays that out for people, that no he cannot match servants. He only had a chance due to the way their abilities matched out. Shirou would lose to probably even Avenger if it came down to it outside of compatibility. <br><br>After hearing that Tohnofags tend to say "&gt;LOL Nasu", "Implying that counts, I don't like it so it doesn't", or something similar to discredit shit when they've lost.<br><br>Then they usually fall into the usual traps of "Implying he's not the strongest character in Type Moon".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If something has no concept of death, how can it die?</br>  <br>Its both, I think.<br><br>And an archer Herc would probably be OP as fuck.<br><br><br>Just because you can't "kill it" doesn't mean you can't destroy it with brute fucking force.<br><br>Ain't it how that dude,Ado or whatever, killed types in Notes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nothing personal kid. <br>The Batwing just solos.</br></br>  <br>Tohno might as well be the strongest glass cannon, until Nasu said lol he cannot kill everything.</br>  <br>You see shit even during his game that he can't kill<br><br>Are you stupid?

While Arcueid has the strength of 4 Servants, I remember there being a scene in hollow implying that Gil was the equivalent of 5 Servants + a.<br><br>A. In the definition of Arcueid's strength, there's this thing where "her output changes according to her opponent". As an absolute order taken from her backup, the planet, she is allowed only an output a little stronger than her opponent. And. Single entity abilities of Arc and Servants are roughly on the same level<br><br>Servants use their respective Noble Phantasms while Arc uses her unlimited backup to fight, and differences occur depending on affinity. A simple-is-best Arc is an all rounder, and so generally her chances of winning are only high, but there are those opponents that she just has helplessly awful compatibility with.<br><br>For example, in cases where even if the guy's stats are about the same as Arc, he has a ridiculously large number of weapons with high versatility. As the amount Arc is allowed to take out is based on "single entity ability", against types like Gil-sama, well, you see?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If we're talking only about EXTRA and CCC, she's (Arcueid ) about the only one who can bring the Golden Fur White Face down "to circumstances where its possible to defeat her, however little the chances may be". <br><br>Caster gets no respect for how powerful she can actually get.</br></br></br>  <br>An object has no concept of death since it's not living in the first place.<br><br>Yet Tohno can still rip them apart.</br></br></br>  <br>Having no concept of death doesn't automatically make you invincible.

UBW is a stronger GoB, no matter how much Nasu tries to make Shirou an underdog. He is stronger than Gil and kills him easily.

UBW kills every other servant with little effort.</br>  <br> UBW is a stronger GoB <br>No it isn't. Shirou doesn't have literally every weapon ever stockpiled in there. He cannot instantly pull out the counter-weapon to every hero and situation until he has seen every counter-weapon to every hero and situation, and at no point in any of Shirou's lifetime does this happen.<br><br>Willing to bet they didn't even go through 1/1,000,000th of Gil's arsenal in the climactic battle before he decided to pull out Ea.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes they do you idiot. If it can break, or degrade at all it has a concept of death. Tohno understands the death of objects and so can kill them.</br>  <br>Except she loses control when she takes severe damage as it happened in Ciel's route. When this happens she goes Warcueid and can access 100% of her powers. Whether she likes to or not.<br><br>This is not even getting to the fact that were she to lose herself Archetype Earth would take over as stated in KT and as it happened in Roa's story.</br></br></br>  <br>Since Alaya is in some ways an aspect of Gaia, is Alaya also "dead" in Notes despite humanity's survival?<br>Could a "Type-Man" emerge?</br></br>  <br>Wrong. Archer only has noble phantasms numbering in the thousands. This is not enough to overcome any situation, and only enough to overcome Herakles six times.</br>  <br><br>The fanbase is alright when contained to their own subjects, it's when they try to talk about literally anything else that it's a problem. Some of them are capable of holding their shit together regardless, but others just really take the cake even among obsessive otaku and guess which ones like to hear themselves talk more and are 100% assured of their absolute righteousness.</br></br>  <br>I don't think he would be able to pierce Herc's God Hand with UBW, and Lancer's Protection From Arrows probably gives him an advantage over Shirou. However, you're right I can't see some servants doing shit to him with UBW up, like Fake and True Assassin.</br>  <br> every counter-weapon to every hero and situation <br><br>You say that as if Gill has a counter weapon for everyone wen he doesn't. He has jack shit wen it comes to Karna's kit and its probably the same with Arjuna's Gandiva.</br></br></br>  <br>CCC Gilgamesh sacrificed 9/10ths of his treasury before the start of the game.</br>  <br>TYPES aren't meant to be interesting characters in the sense that they have flaws and goals.<br><br>Its more that they're Eldritch horrors far beyond humanity, to the point that hearing them described is pretty interesting in this post apocalyptic setting where humanity is on its last verges fighting against things that would look down on them as ants.<br><br>When you hear Cthulu described in certain tales of Eldritch beings its pretty monstrous and beyond belief in itself. The setting itself makes them more interesting seeing humanity brought to their limits at the end of the world brought about by these monsters bigger than life.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Shirou is Type-Man, the embodiment of humanity's hopes, dreams, and desire for justice. </br></br>  <br><br>Honestly everything just kind of stupid when it involves Gilgamesh since his entire power level revolves around the fact that he is supposed to be the first hero and has all these gimmick weapons in his vault to counter others. That's pretty much it, that's his power since otherwise he just sits around and makes smug chatter at the rest of the cast. Nasu REALLY fucked up making him the final boss of most routes since he's just so SNK Boss tier and not really interesting at all.</br></br>  <br>Bitch can time paradox all over to get what she wants. Even Arc doesn't want to deal with that shit if she doesn't have to.</br>  Archer was too busy trying to kill his ideal to shoot NPs like bullets like Gilgamesh does, so Shirou was able to keep standing back up and advancing on him.<br><br>Gilgamesh was too haughty and wouldn't recognize Shirou as an actual threat until it was too late, which let Shirou keep standing back up and advancing on him.<br><br>Shirou didn't appear capable of minigunning NPs like both Archers could do with GoB or UBW. Shirou really would've gotten his shit pushed in by a Servant who was fighting seriously, because his flesh and blood human body wouldn't be able to keep up.</br></br></br></br>  Ameterasu  <br>If Gil actually bothered to learn and make use of all of the treasures in Gate of Babylon he'd be a hundred times more bullshit than he already is. He could Mega Man nearly every other Noble Phantasm on top of having Ea. You could have Assassin Gil do shit like walk around completely invisible with Hades' Cap of Darkness and shank all the other Servants/Masters with proto-Rule Breaker. Then again there's not much reason to when you could also just brute force everything with Ea, but there's a ridiculous amount of untapped potential beyond "magic Gatling Gun"</br>  <br>Crimson Moon and Archetype Earth do.</br>  <br><br>I like to think of it this way.

What level Madara?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course "Type-Moon" is the exception, he's the title character.</br>  <br>I would read the fuck out of that.</br>  <br>That's entirely inaccurate<br><br>Gilgamesh at the end of his route in CCC sacrifices 9/10ths of his treasury to get to the near side of the Moon from the Far side, which is noted to be something of an impossible feat to get past the last firewall. The fact that he did the impossible is just paramount for the character himself, kind of like Karna's feat in the game.<br><br>Gilgamesh broke into the other side of the Moon after he heard that his master from CCC when he made it to the other side of the Moon would be without a servant, he would be deleted the second the Mooncell realizes they're without a servant. His previous servant was a berserker who broke his contract the second it couldn't find him(its thought that his previous servant was Enkidu, since MC during Gil's route has a dream from Enkidu's perspective and even Gil notes that it shouldn't work like that).<br><br>For someone who had gained his interest to that degree he would not allow them to die so readily in such a half assed manner. MC had become basically a treasure worth all of his other treasures, so he wouldn't let them fall so readily<br><br>Although according to Gil hismelf he has an NP that can call back all of his lost NPs into his vault without much effort. So it might not be the biggest loss.<br><br>Gilgamesh even with a fraction of his treasury then finished the contest out on the near side with MC.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He means the solar goddess of power level 387420489.</br></br>  <br> If Gil actually bothered to learn and make use of all of the treasures in Gate of Babylon he'd be a hundred times more bullshit than he already is. <br><br>He can already do that and has done it a few times<br><br>Usually though he's just like "Mongrel, you're not worth the effort" so he just throws weapons like bullets to the unworthy.<br><br>Against serious opponents he's been known to pull things out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ado's Slash Emperor is pretty much the representation of humanity that thing will use up a whole planet if it needs to.</br>  Gill isn't even the strongest servant.  Fuck your projections  <br><br>Nor is Enkidu.</br></br>  <br><br>Gee you don't say. I always thought it was coincidence that the more he starts to appear in a route the less literally every other servant besides maybe Saber seems to matter.</br></br>  <br>Depending on what we qualify as a "servant", the strongest one should be B.B.</br>   Nasu will never use Hercules as anything but a mad dog <br> He will never be able to fully enjoy a masterful sword fight against Archer <br> He will never bro it up with Shirou <br> He will never slaughter the Einzberns for putting Ilyasveil through hell for the sake of their thousand-year-old hopeless greed <br> He will never be able to protect his daughteru </br></br></br></br>  <br> Rhongomyniad getting a buff  <br><br>Still salty about that.</br></br></br>  <br>Destroying a projection is about as impressive as breaking a vase</br>  <br>Only the best for bestest girl!</br>  <br>If we ever count BB, then nothing else that could be called a servant could ever surpass her.

In fact, after UBW was cast, Gil had no chance in winning. The fact is that UBW is a hard counter to Gate of Babylon, because it is for all effects and purposes in this matchup an exact copy, just faster. The only hope Gilgamesh has against Shirou is casting Ea immediately, but because of the speed advantage Shirou has, Gilgamesh never got a chance to actually summon and attack with Ea. This caused him to panic and he still knew Ea was his only chance so he tried to us it without actually having an opening to do so. That's what caused him to lose his arm and dig himself even deeper into the hole. If Gil pulled out Ea the moment Shirou cast UBW, then maybe he could have won. Instead, his cockiness let Shirou cast UBW and it only took a moment for Shirou to get his momentum going, at which point he was effectively unstoppable.</br>  <br> In fact, after UBW was cast, Gil had no chance in winning. <br><br>Its shown during one scene that he could have grabbed for Ea in time during the battle, but he hesitated, his pride got the best of him and it cost him.<br><br>Pride is his mortal folly, if Shirou isn't constantly putting on the pressure and the chance exists for him to grab Ea, then its over for Shirou.<br><br>However even when the chance was there, Gilgamesh hesitated.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's rock&gt;paper&gt;scissors, retard.<br>Gilgamesh&gt;Servants&gt;Shirou&gt;Gilgamesh<wbr>.</wbr></br></br>  <br>The moment of hesitation was only in the anime. It's a nice way to show Gil's ego without him going HURR DURR MONGRELS AND FAKERS, but not hesitating for that moment didn't help him in the VN.</br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  Taiga is the best and cutest Fate girl.  <br>I can agree to best and cutest fate girl if you accept tied for first with Bazett.</br>  When will they fuck?

He only says Shiki in Tsukihime wins via trump cards. He becomes a normal fighter in Melty Blood and doesn't have to fight with trump cards. People don't understand this and its in plain fucking Japanese.<br><br>Shiki never fought Nero as an Assassin. It was a straight up battle in Tsukihime too. Nero was never able to fight Shiki in a straight battle. <br><br>He fought Shiki the same way he fought Arcueid and never even touched Shiki. Neither Roa nor Sacchin really shat on Shiki when he was "on" or in "Melty Blood" mode.<br><br>The only ones that have done so were Arcueid and Ciel and Akiha. And Akiha destroyed Roa easily.<br><br> Even a top class Nanaya isn't shit to a demon in power or speed at all, but they have special training that allows them to turn the tides briefly to aim for a kill. <br>If you read Red Demon God, Nanaya Kiri was so fast, Kouma sounded so slow. Kiri exchanged blows with him initially in a direct attack and didn't hit Kiri, and Kiri kept on hitting Kouma for 40+ times without getting hit.<br><br>Kiri calls Kouma slow.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Magical Amber, the Magical Girl form of Kohaku.<br>Runner ups are Neko-Arc, Neko-Arc Chaos, Taiga and Magical Caren.</br></br>  <br> I'm gonna ignore the author <br>It's as canon to the Nasuverse as Lord of the Flies</br></br>  Soujuurou is confirmed strongest when he stepped down the mountain.  <br>That isn't talking powerlevels.</br>  <br> "The Nasuverse" is one unified canon which Prisma is incompatible with </br>  <br>Kouma the Crimson Red Vermillion who can fight on par with the average servant. God damn son, I need more Nanaya stuff in turkeyhandle remake.</br>  <br>So, it is completely canon?</br>  <br>At this point, "MELTY BLOOD" caused a major contradiction.<br><br>Since this was a fighting game, the position of the protagonist, Tohno Shiki, a character that could participate in combat only by means of trump cards, was reversed, and he became involved in the story as a protagonist that can "fight normally".<br><br>"....Right. The characteristics of the characters in "MELTY BLOOD" had either been exaggerated or restrained from what they had been in Tsukihime." "Using cards as an example, Shiki of Tsukihime would be a 3 of Hearts. But the Shiki of "MELTY BLOOD" would be able to fight normally as a Jack of Spades."</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Taiga is a qt.</br>   tfw no spin-off with Gilgamesh who is still arrogant but more fun about it <br> I don't even need anything to avoid dying from your spear, Lancer <br> How come my riding skill is higher than yours, Rider?

I don't think I'm the only one who want it but is there's also some anon out there who want a sequel of F/SN? by that I mean a sixth grail war. <br>It can't happen anymore with the heaven feel route but the other two route give the possibility open, it just need to let Rin and Waver fail. <br>It sure would be milking the shit out of the Fate franchise but still, that could be interesting, if it's set ten years later I mean. The cast would be more mature.<br><br>  I want it to be in good old VN format though  </br></br></br></br>  <br>Becomes a quiz show host?</br>  <br>It is until 3rei</br>  <br> or Urubochi </br>  <br>I think only the 3rd war has any real prequel potential. Weren't the first two really fucking short? I know the second was brutal though.<br><br>Honestly a sequel would be really hard. Nasu doesn't want to piss of anyone, and that's a problem if he shows route favoritism.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably kept his house clean until he came back.<br> Which he never did. </br></br>  <br>The first one was a short, organized failure<br>The second was a total bloodbath</br></br>  <br> tfw no spin-off with Gilgamesh who is still arrogant but more fun about it <br><br>CCC and Strange Fake.</br></br></br>  <br>Making a sequel would mean he has to choose one of the routes to continue, which makes it the "canon" route.<br>He already avoided it once by making HA into a dream with an entirely different scenario.</br></br>  <br>First one was boring as shit and nothing actually happened, it was just "hey guys this thing kinda doesn't work, see you in 50 years"<br>Second one was short and bloody.</br></br>  <br>He could always write sequels to every route, though that'd be a hell of an endeavor.</br>  <br>6th war would be 50 years after the fifth, assuming it happens at all.</br>  <br><br>I think the first one was the 3 families getting together, summoning the servants, using the command seals to order the servants to kill themselves then discovering they lacked enough mana and calling it a century.</br></br>  3rd War was the one that took place during World War II and had Nazis, right? Avenger was summoned, and the Tohsaka heir got hitched with one of the Edelfelts who joined in.  <br> CCC <br> Strange Fake <br>So you read neither of those?</br></br></br>   this will never be a thing   <br>In terms of in-universe power: Whoever the fuck Nasu hallucinated on his most recent meth binge.<br>In terms of MARKETING POWER, which is all TM really cares about: Saber.</br></br>  <br> yfw Archer didn't stop the nukes </br>  <br>True Demons are above Primordial demons and are type level</br>  <br><br>The first was rather anti-climatic for what I remember, they didn't had yet command seals so then they asked the servant to do their jobs they must had say "lol nope" or something along.<br><br>The second grail war is the most interesting for me. Grail wasn't corrupted yet, it's said it was the most valuable grail war for magi. And then yes, it was apparently by far the most bloodiest of the five.<br><br><br>That's a shame, I would choose the Fate route. It's not my favourite but   Illya would maybe still be alive  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Obviously Fuji-Nee. Tiger Dojo is such a broken Noble Phantasm - it just lets you keep starting over until you win.  <br> Illya would maybe still be alive <br><br>No, she dies a year after the end of the Fate route.</br></br></br>  <br>Replacing the reverse-trap Zero Saber with Mordred might make for an interesting ensemble.</br>  <br>What stops them from getting her a puppet body?</br>  Still waiting on Grand Order.  <br>I think the only one who can do that is Illya herself.</br>  If Goku blew up the planets would the Types die?  <br>I'm not sure, but I'm guessing something would because it would lessen the intent of her only supposed to be living for a year.</br>  Since it's basically a Fate thread, I have a question:<br><br>Is female Gilgamesh canon? I know about Ko-Gil, but I often see images of a female counterpart. (not the chick from Kaleid). If so, where does she come from ?</br></br>  <br>The fact that they only managed to get one for Shirou in HF by sheer, stupid luck.<br><br>Besides, no one except Ilya knew Ilya would die until it would have been too late to do anything about it, and Ilya herself had already accepted her fate.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope, fanon.<br><br>Except if you count April fool's Protoreplica anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>She never showed up in anything, but that doesn't make her any less canon.</br>  <br><br><br>What about the ice sword and the other scythe-like weapon he used against Saber in Fate? Can he also use the characteristics of the other NPs?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Goku would end up destroying the planet, as Alaya would chimp out and send every last thing it had to prevent that which would also probably call Type-Earth out.</br>  <br>Is there anything in Type Moon that can even beat Goku?</br>  <br>There's no Type-Earth.<br>No Arcueid isn't one.</br></br>  <br>Yes, and? That entire statement does not say Shiki is only able to fight as an assassin.<br><br>When Shiki fought Nero, it was a full-on fair fight when he became a Jack of Spades temporarily. There was no surprise attack there. Nero was fighting from a distance, had time to release 100 of his beasts, and still got killed by Shiki knowing his ability and speed and other intangibles.<br><br>What Nasu simply says there is that Tsukihime Shiki can't always fight up to MB form, especially since if you read Tsukihime:<br><br>1. He is still under Makihisa's brainwashing<br>2. He doesn't know diddly squat about his lineage and the entire thing lasts a week or so.<br><br>Melty Blood happens quite a bit of time (about a year) after a potential Sacchin Normal and is completely different from Tsukihime where Shiki is surprising himself with revelation after revelation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks for the clarification.</br></br>  <br>Shiki, either of them, could potentially kill his ki blasts until he tires himself out, and take him out afterwards. But if Goku goes in to melee before he tires out, they'd lose hard.<br><br>Excaliblast is almost literally the Spirit Bomb, so that might be able to take Goku out.<br><br>Since Ea's maximum output is higher than Excaliblast's, Gil might be able to beat him if he ever get serious.<br><br>Night of Wallachia is literally unkillable outside of certain conditions that require either another millennium to pass, or reality-warping powers. He might then be able to zerg rush Goku with infinite avatars, given time.<br><br>Nrvnqsr could probably devour Goku if he got his hands (so to speak) on him.<br><br>Pale Rider from Strange Fake is practically a hard counter, considering Goku would have died to that heart disease without Trunks' medicine from the future.<br><br>Of course, pretty much all of this is ignoring anything from Battle of Gods on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually, Arcueid is de facto Type-Earth. The prefix "Arch" does not mean she's a fake or inferior. It just is there to explain that she's different because of how she's made. Arcueid is so Type Earth, Gaia can take over her in MBAACC.</br>  <br>ORT?</br>  <br> Gaia can take over her in MBAACC. <br>That was not Gaia, nor was it the Crimson Moon. The actual Japanese name for the character, Shinso (True Ancestor) Arcuied, should tell you what she really was.</br></br>  <br>Archetype is a word, you know?<br>Do you know what it means, perhaps?</br></br>  <br>But Rin transfers Shirou's soul from the "container" into the puppet body<br><br> The fact that they only managed to get one for Shirou in HF by sheer, stupid luck. <br>There are tons of puppet bodies.<br>They were lucky that they found one made by Touko</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The one with the highest potential. You see Gil being a confirmed pleb at the end of CCC when he met the alien race. Lancelot can just hijack the aliens weapons.<br><br> Unlike how the golden knight owned numerous Noble Phantasms, Berserker’s Noble Phantasm is endless. </br></br></br>  Why is Shinji nowhere to be seen in Prisma again?<br>Does the Matou household even exist there?</br>  <br> Prisma <br> making sense </br></br>  <br>He has no practical way to beat some shit. While he has the POTENTIAL to beat almost anything with good prep, with a retard Master like Illya, all there is is brute force, and some Servants just have some concepts that brute force alone can't beat.</br>  <br>Ilyaverse Sakura is a Matou, but that's literally all the mention there has ever been of the Matou or Makiri families in Prisma. Miyuverse Sakura wasn't even named.</br>  <br>We don't even have a color image of Sakura in the series, so for all we know she was never wormed.</br>  Shinji is a magical girl, too. The best magical girl.  <br>While that is true, I don't think her hair is shaded like any other brown- or black-haired character in the manga. It's PROBABLY purple, but even if it is that doesn't automatically mean worms. Maybe something else changed her hair color. Maybe she dyes it to get senpai to notice her.</br>  <br> Against serious opponents he's been known to pull things out. <br>Like True Archer, right?</br></br>  <br>The body is True Ancestor Arcueid, the being inside was Gaia. If you read the story mode, it is revealed and you'll know it says that the power being controlled by that TA Arc is higher than what Arcueid is supposed to have.<br><br><br>I know what Archetype means. I also know that Type means differently from type.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah it doesn't imply that. In the main verse if Arcueid loses her identity she'll become Archetype Earth, which is already the Crimson Moon equivalent as Nasu stated.<br><br>Notes is implied to be an alternate world, like Tsuki no Sango.</br></br></br>  <br> That was not Gaia, nor was it the Crimson Moon <br><br>Play the route before you talk out of your ass. She is called the Brain of the Planet and the "equivalent" of the Crimson Moon. She also refers to the Earth itself as her body, the atmosphere as her limbs, etc. Yes, she is effectively Type Earth.<br><br>The Arche before Type is just there to clarify what Type means, not to show she is different from other Types. It refers the Jungian Archetype.</br></br></br></br></br>  Are they really going to wait until the 31st to release Grand Order?  <br>Archetype is a reality warper with control over space and time. Pretty sure Goku can't beat her.</br>  <br>He pulls out Merodach after the GoB spam.</br>  <br> She also refers to the Earth itself as her body, the atmosphere as her limbs, etc. <br>When was this? I know it's said in the route that AT has higher clearance than Arcueid does, but I don't seem to remember this one.</br></br>  <br><br>Well Sakura's hair goes pretty long. They still have her cowlick, purple hair, same measurements, and iconic ribbon. The differences are a bit of length and a smudge of lighter purple.<br><br>But when you have such a good foundation, you don't have to change much, heh. You see a lot of Sakura montages in fanart, pic related.<br><br>But I do wonder why Nasu doesn't bother exploring some of her greater powers? I mean, beyond the blackening of Servants, everything she does in HF are part of her natural power set. Transporting through shadows to long distances and holding stuff in alternate dimension where time has no meaning, and it seemed like whatever she wants can happen in there. She can also make clones of herself and send her consciousness through them. And she learned these things as naturally as breathing. <br><br>Perplexes me he doesn't bother exploring these interesting facets of her patchwork body of Binding Matou/Grail/Imaginary Element Tohsaka.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But I do wonder why Nasu doesn't bother exploring some of her greater powers? <br>Because she doesn't have them<br>All powers she uses in HF are a mixture of using Angry Manjuice and being able to massively regenerate while constantly using circuits on maximum capacity.</br></br></br>  <br>She commands the Earth to stop rotating by calling it her body if you lose to her in the last fight. When Arcueid beats (more like beats her own body) she says it doesn't matter if the limbs of an incarnation get beaten up, because her real limbs are the Earth's atmosphere.</br>  <br>No to all of them, they cant match Gokus speed. but BB rips Goku a new one though.</br>  <br><br>It is kind of odd people call that an asspull, when it expressly says Sakura used up all the money she had and they took a year just to find a used model in an empty storehouse. They went broke for leads in the underground and a thrift model.</br></br>  <br>I remember someone said Zelretch is stronger than Moon and Moon is strongest Type overall.<br>ORT is only strongest on Earth IIRC.</br></br>  <br><br>All that AM gave her is the blackening and a giant surplus of magical energy, the latter she has anyway post route due to being connected to the Astral Plane. Literally everything else is her own powers, that was the point of why the hybrid is so powerful. Imaginary Numbers naturally has the alternate dimension where time flows differently. Strangely, most people think that is AM.</br></br>  <br>So is Shiki literally fucking the earth?</br>  <br>Ah, so it's the final fight quotes. Thanks.</br>  <br>Shiki is having sex with three beings at the same time when he's dicking Arcueid.<br><br>1. Arcueid<br>2. Crimson Moon Shard<br>3. Gaia</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. Zelretch was not fighting a serious Crimson Moon. CM basically jobbed to Zelretch, and even with that, CM still managed to vampirize Zelretch as he died in battle.</br>  <br>Does that count as a 4some?</br>  <br>Arcueid's head must be noisy as fuck with all three of them making mental grunts and noises with each pump Shiki does in her.</br>  <br>It probably works like Namekian Fusion in DBZ Abridged.</br>  <br><br>If Mikiya is fucking the Root, and Shiki's fucking the Earth, what the hell are Shirou and Shizuki fucking?</br></br>  <br>Tohno Shiki is actually connected to the Root as well.<br><br>Saber is a DRAGON</br></br></br>  <br>King Arthur and Alice.</br>  <br>The most impressive fucking Shirou does is the time traveling SheKing.</br>  <br>Yeah, one must be connected to the Origin to have Mystic Eyes of Death Perception.</br>  <br> Time-traveling King Arthur <br> Top 100 alltime of the Magic Association magus <br> All the World's Evil </br></br></br>  <br> &gt;All the World's Evil <br>As if, it was only its shadow.

And she is small.</br>  <br>And also Saki Biyori, yay!<br> 7th Ikeda chapter <br>And I taught that half the OAD would be about the daily life of the four sisters of the Ikeda household...</br></br></br>  <br>You taught that it would be about school this time?<br>Well, think again.<br><br>And Kana made the same mistake as with Bundousan, this time calling her kouhai Miharun.</br></br></br></br>      The quality is so terrible, it's a raw and authentic gonzo S1 experience  <br>taking care of little children is dangerous</br>      Do you guys still play mahjong or has it been outlawed nowadays?  <br>I've had to start playing in 0 to get my mahjong fix, but I saw three consecutive games in 7447 last night (of which I was in one), and there's one going right now.<br> 1:4 </br></br>  <br>Last page, next chapter next month.<br><br><br>I dotn't have enough time (but I never graduated from the flash game, so you won't miss me in tenhou).</br></br></br></br>  <br> last night <br>What's your timezone?</br></br>    <br>I'm in GMT+1.</br>  Dramatic Cycle is pretty much the perfect OP for Biyori. It's more than what I expected.<br>It has all the energy of the other openings yet rightfully omits the more dramatic 2nd halves these openings have. <br>Visually it's probably the weakest, obviously due to budget, but it still has some good moments like Wahaha in the van.<br> WAKARU YO! </br></br></br>  Post underappreciated girl like Nowachin.

The previous im@s threads, before Cinderella Girls, were more generals about the series as a whole (games, mobage, etc.) and rarely was there anime relevant discussion.</br>  How much of the 4koma has been scanlated, if at all?  <br>All of it except the latest chapter which according to the typesetter will be done Thursday.

I'm sure she uses her arrows aswell, but ive no source on that.</br>  Boat tits  <br>wrong</br>    Does anyone else find running expeditions fun(relaxing)? I can watch anime, clean, cook, get work done,etc. then come back to sparkling ships and a warm greeting.

Palau, for example, has 4.3 days of rain every week.</br>  <br>Of course, but it's only fun if you win. My best hand was sanshoku chanta with a baiman.</br>  <br>I love this picture so much.</br>  RAINMEIKAH!  <br>Daijoubu!</br>  I want to make and raise a cute daughter with Houshou.  <br>It's nice to see the shipgirls enjoying themselves in the field.</br>  <br><br><br>Cute boy</br></br></br>  Samidare love  <br>Samidare butt.</br>  <br>Samiderriere?</br>  <br><br><br>I can get behind this.</br></br></br>  Requesting images of decapitated ship girls.    <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/danbooru/</br>  <br>Not what you're asking for but it's kinda related/</br>  <br>If Houshou-san was my mother, things would be different here.</br>  <br>Good enough for a  Mexican. </br>  <br>poor Kaga-chan</br>    <br> mother <br> not wanting her to be your wife </br></br>  Who has the sexiest body, and why is it Sendai?  <br>And you keep using &gt; wrong.</br>  <br>doesn't ruin her skin in the sun</br>  <br>Sendai is perfect.</br>  <br>I beg to differ.</br>  <br>Her sister is cuter.</br>  <br>what the fuck is wrong with her hips</br>  <br> oppai loli <br>a shit.</br></br>  <br>But it's actually Akashi.</br>  <br> Hachi <br> loli <br>Fuck off retard.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I kind of feel sorry for her Tenryuu, 2nd best to Inazuma but shitty female admiral loves her tits.</br></br>  <br>I have oedipus complex.</br>  <br>Kaga for me</br>    <br>Hachi is stacked, but she isn't exactly short when compared to the other girls.</br>  <br>What? Pepekekeko has a level 150 Inazuma.</br>  <br>The whole Sendai class is nice. Sendai herself is my favorite, however. Marriage soon.</br>    <br>What level is she?</br>    <br>80.<br><br>Okay, maybe not as soon as I'd like. It's a struggle from here on out but I won't give up on her.</br></br></br>  <br>You're not even half way to 99.</br>    <br>You'd better have the mahjong kotatsu in game.</br>  <br>This event will be a good time to do that. Last event Suzuya and Kumano got themselves from 74 to 86 while I was dying farming for Isokaze.</br>  Best fairy pilot.  <br>This .<br><br>When you get her to 99, remember to wed her on the winter solstice.</br></br></br>  <br>I know. But unless the game disappears, I'll head towards that goal little by little.<br><br><br>Repair buckets are in high demand. The event is almost here and constant expeditions just aren't enough.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you get her? I ran through all my damecons and two Goyas before she finally showed up.</br>      <br>~500 should be the max you would ever need for clearing, anything else above that is just buffer for farming.<br><br><br>I got her. It took me 553 buckets, 101 successful sorties and countless failures to get her, though, and 8-12 levels for everyone on the E5 team.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 大将 </br>  <br>Akebono is Akebueno</br>  <br>What? They're slaves not people so it's alright.</br>  <br>One blueprint a month is enough for me.</br>  soon  That improves the Poi.  <br>Do some 5-4. You probably have ships to level anyway.</br>  <br>I doubt he does after all this time.</br>      <br>More like boi!</br>  <br>Shigure works quite well with short hair. <br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>But then how will I find time to translate the chinese homosexual kaga doujins you all know and love? <br><br>The only ship I don't have and can't easily get is Sakawa and a few Kai II, I'll take it easy.</br></br></br>  <br> no Sakawa </br>  <br> homosexual kaga doujins  <br> doujins <br> homosexual kaga <br><br>I wish there would be more yuri content of Kaga. It's pretty much all just Kaga x admiral.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because she's canonically straight, look at her marriage line.</br>  <br> He's talking about shit like http://pastebin.com/yDtM8B0A </br>  <br>What's a Sakawa?</br>  <br><br>Dropped</br></br>  <br>The runt.</br>  <br>Because TTKsexual Kaga &gt; Yuri Kaga</br>  <br>Fuck off Raian.</br>  <br>A cute.</br>  <br>Noshiri a cuter.</br>  <br> single stocking <br>This will never not be lewd.</br></br>  <br>Noshiwho?</br>  <br>Is the entire Agano class lewd by default?</br>  <br>It's not from lack of trying, i quite like her.<br><br><br>It's cute to imagine even lazy Agano trying to spoil Sakawa</br></br></br></br>  <br>Try harder. <br> Try as hard as my cock is when looking at Sakawa lewds. </br></br>  <br>Much better now</br>  <br>I'll be looking for her this event.</br>  <br> getting rid of Sakawa  <br><br>For what purpose?</br></br></br>  <br>nice meme</br>    <br>I'd like to fuck Shikinami in this position.</br>    Kagerou or Kazerou uniform?  <br>Dominating a shipgirl during sex and making them entirely dependent on your dick for true pleasure sounds like fun, doesn't it</br>  <br>This uniform is amazing, I love my girls all well covered with pantyhose, changeable uniforms fucking when?</br>  <br> there will never be a KanColle dress-up game  <br><br> Why do I want this so much? </br></br></br>  <br> First thing every does it take off their clothes </br>  <br>Would it come with bear costumes for all my bears?</br>  <br>As long as I can make everyone wear pantyhoses Im happy enough.<br><br>Why would yo do that?</br></br></br>  <br> I hope this bear is hairy "down there." </br>  <br>Imagine the possibilities.</br>  <br> Why would yo do that? <br>So you can properly measure them for their clothes obviously.</br></br>  <br>So that I can gaze upon their supple naked bodies.</br>  <br>Fuck off runt</br>  <br> changeable uniforms fucking when? <br>Never, artists almost never standardize their uniforms. The only real exceptions is the Furutaka-Aoba superclass, since Fujikawa, Aoba's artist and Ugume all worked together to make a relatively similar uniform (down to Aoba and Kinugasa having similar hair color).<br><br>Parsely's kagerou have a uniform resembling Yoshinori's, though, and Drew's destroyers have a uniform similar to Shibafu's special types.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is she a cute boy too?</br>  <br> Post underappreciated girl <br> Kagafags not spamming  <br>Good thread, now we need a translation to make it perfect.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm retiring Kagaspam for Harunaspam.</br>  <br>spam daughterus pls</br>  <br>Will things be daijoubu?</br>  <br>Fuck off Kagafag, your kind are cancer</br>  <br> he still thinks the spammer is a Kagafag and didn't just use her because she's an easy target to piss off people <br>You never learn.</br></br>    <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128665<wbr>545/#q128690388<br>You Kagafags sympathizers are part of problems</br></wbr></br>  <br>Not the other way.

Her Kongou Hiei  backed down when the FeTTK asked if she still wanted to get married.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would she marry Tenryuu? The only married ship is Den.</br>  <br>Shioi is quite sexy. I hope her sisters will appear someday.</br>  <br>Mogami wears shorts you dunce.</br>  <br><br>http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/152<wbr>1045<br><br>FeTTK was asked by Tenryuu what she thought of her. FeTTK said she was cute and that her breasts were huge.<br><br>Being a bigamist for lewd/love reasons isn't necessary. Her Tenryuu is probably the highest leveled ship in her fleet and getting married would raise the cap.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  Remember the spergout when Arpeggio episode 1 came out and people were raging about Shibafu subs? Good times.  Damn, reading about the Pacific War makes me wish I could have fought in it (and survived).  <br>Some people dont change opinions just to agree to the popular one, I still think the same as that day.</br>  <br>You mean that she is one of the most popular submarine out there? Getting as first submarine even a high priced figurine and nendo.</br>  <br><br>Would be interesting, but honestly the idea of surviving an attack but drifting on the ocean for a rescue that may never come scares the hell out of me.</br></br>  <br>I'm talking about the artist having a level 150 Den. There's no way it'll be any different with Koharu, the story has pretty much been leading to that.<br><br><br>The only reason people got mad was because they took Iona away from them.</br></br></br></br>  Translation time<br>Fubuki: I'm Fubuki, the new ship that has been appointed here!<br>Fubuki: I'm still inexperienced but...<br>Fubuki: I'll try my best!<br>Nagato: I see<br>Nagato: So you're that Fubuki-kun...<br>Nagato: I'm Nagato<br>Nagato: I'll be counting on you<br>Nagato: Fubuki-kun! What's the meaning of today's sortie!?<br>Nagato: You didn't move like you was practiced at all!<br>Fubuki: I-I'm sorry!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only thing I remember how bad the threads were because people were butthurt what the anime wasn't a straight 1:1 adaptation.</br>  <br>Why? It sounded like a terrible experience unless you were a badass pilot.</br>  <br>Nagato: Were you hurt?<br>Fubuki: No, I...<br>Nagato: It's good then! Well, maybe you're still not used to it yet...<br>Nagato: In a battle, you just need to stay calm and act accordingly<br>Nagato: Just rest for today<br>Fubuki: Y-Yes!<br>Fubuki: Nagato-san is scary, but...<br>Fubuki: Deep down she's so nice and cool. I really look up to her!!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, it would be just as bad. <br>If your plane gets shoot down you would be dead with the plane or shot as you float on.<br><br>The top if not the worst case would be stuck <br>on a sinking ship with no way to get out.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Nagato: Kanabun!!! (A kind of bettle)<br>Nagato: Kanabun!!Kanabun!!Kanabun!!<br>Nagato: The grass is delicious! The grass is delicious!<br>Nagato: The grass is delicious!<br>Nagato: Delicious grass!!<br>Nagato: Deliciouuuuuuuuuuuss!!!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's why I said badass pilot. Not a mook pilot. It seems like the survivors with the most wild stories to tell were pilots.</br>    <br>You've gone mad, Nagato!</br>  Fufufu, ya scared?  <br>Oh God</br>  <br>What went wrong there?</br>  <br>It's time! I've been waiting for this.</br>  <br>The fact that it was from the god itself and it doesnt even look plump was completely dissapointing.</br>  <br>Kisaragi: Nagato-saaan!!<br>Nagato: What's wrong?<br>Kisaragi: Hurry!!<br>Mutsuki: Well... I baked some cookies for Nagato-san, so...<br>Mutsuki: Will you accept them?<br>Nagato: Cookies huh? Well...<br>Nagato: Actually I'm not good with sweet things<br>Nagato: But since they're something Mutsuki-kun made for me<br>Nagato: I'll accept them<br>Nagato: Thank you, Mutsuki-kun</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think we lost her, Damn woman!<br><br> my sides </br></br></br>  <br>What about the guys on the O'Bannon tossing potatoes though?</br>  <br>What is this supposed to mean? Nagato, why?</br>  <br> Hidden depth Nagato </br>  <br>Nagato: Yahooooooo!! I got some Mutsuki-tan's cookies!!!<br>Nagato: Mutsuki-tan's cookies!! Mutsuki-tan's cookies!!!!<br>Nagato: Ohoooooooooooo!!<br>Nagato: Delicious!! Deliciouuuuussss!!

Isn't it?  Why did Touma punch such a beautiful lady?  <br>Manlet rage. He knows he's laughably short and can only express his pain by punching people.</br>  <br>She wasn't living her life correctly</br>  <br><br>There are so many better things to be done with her.</br></br>  <br>Like what?</br>  <br>because she has a shitty personality</br>  <br>Let her trample my face.</br>  Because he's a tranny exhibitionist with huge implants.  <br>God she's so hot<br>I would drag my dick through a mile of broken glass just to hear her fart through a walkie talkie</br></br>  <br>Simple</br>  <br>alphamax please go</br>  <br> this is a catholic nun </br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>To destroy that illusion of hers, of course.</br>  <br>She wasn't living her life correctly</br>  <br>Why do fish swim?</br>  <br>Because he's actually gay and anyone who says otherwise is a deluded Touma fag.</br>  <br>He can't be gay. Touma is asexual. Like, even an amoeba would have more libido than he does. It's a fact that people in Index do not ever have sex under any circumstances whatsoever, no exceptions.</br>  <br>Because he wants to hit that.</br>  <br><br> Oriana was a nun who became a stripper mercenary <br><br>Oh god that's hot.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Cause being Alpha means you don't let hot women play you like a fiddle anon.<br>You probably fidget and stutter.</br></br>  Why does her hair change every scene were the animators dropping acid or something?  <br>worst girl</br>    <br>is Index</br>  <br><br>Sherry Cromwell*</br></br>  <br>At least she doesn't appear as often as Index.</br>  <br>she wasn't living her life correctly. And he liked big breasted onee-samas. He was hoping to pop her into his harem with a one of his patented pimpslaps of justice.<br><br>it  half worked.  </br></br></br>  <br>Because he believes in Gender Equality<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kyt<wbr>O5uUExXo</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Because he totally hit on her.</br>  <br>That was a strange ending, she wasn't the villain, she wasn't the one who needed that punch, there was no reason for her to freak out so much but it was her who got punched in the end.</br>  <br>Big boob onee-chans are his type though.</br>  <br>good taste</br>  <br><br>She fucked with his homies and was trying to make a mess of his city, pretty good reason I'd say.</br></br>  Just read NT7. <br><br>So that guy pretending to be #6 was a fake. I get that but according to the Agitate Halation plan all the Level 5's should have shown up. <br><br>Does that mean the #6 was there and we just didn't see them? Also can we safely assume that because Rensa can't copy Gunha's powers that #6 mustn't be a gemstone?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Touma's gotta break her illusion so she can hear music again and reunite her with her other half and all that jazz. Plus those that get punched get added to the harem anyway.<br><br>I hope Shutaura eventually reappears in a future volume.</br></br></br>  <br>was wondering that myself her hair changes every other scene. <br>guess the animators were having a waifu war</br></br>  <br><br> he totally didn't have a huge hydra boner under those bed sheets looking at a total bomb shell that is Kanzaki Kaori </br></br>  <br>He wasn't thinking clearly at the time.<br>Oriana is for  Sweet and tender loving cowgirl so she can look you in the eye/smother you with her breasts </br></br>  <br>what's going on there? she rescued a loli from a stripper? if index s3 ever gets made will she appear again?</br>  <br>Maybe in S4  (ha) , she only shows up again once in one of the later volumes.</br>  <br>I think she's taking a lost little girl back to her mom.<br>Reading the novels and learning about her back story actually makes me feel bad for sexualizing her.<br>Her whole goal in life is to basically help people and the reason she messed with AC and Touma is because she thought it was the best way to the unite the world and help everyone as best she can.<br>She's actually a very sweet girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>why does she dress like a stripper though</br>  <br>triggered</br>  <br>Alright I can't find any morally justifiable reason for that other then can you blame her?<br>If you looked like a goddess of fertility would you wear a habit your whole life?<br><br> "Do magicians really not realize how odd they <br>look?‖<br>―…‖<br>Kamijou silently stared at Oriana‘s body, but it seemed she didn‘t notice the irony."<br><br>She might not fully realize it herself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, /fit/</br>  Oriana is just so much wasted potential... but that's pretty much the lead motif in the index series so it fits in well.  <br>Index is making him so frustrated with females that he can't help it.</br>  Because Raildex has shit writing and is meant for people too pretentious for Narutardshit to eat up.  <br>this exactly</br>  <br>Yes its Aogami Pierce</br>  <br>Fuck off. Under what evidence?</br>  <br>Because every character from idiotic trio must be relevant somehow, and so far he wasnt</br>  <br>Ah. So no actual evidence. <br><br>I'm guessing it's within the same tier of theory as Accel's "There was an experiment to stop cellular aging within the Imaginary Numbers District" comment about Komoe?<br><br>IE it's possible but it's not like there's evidence for it?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You just don't understand its greatness.</br>  <br>Number 6's power is different from other level 5. It probably has some connection with magic. He's probably has similarities with Tsuchimikado</br>  Was the movie from the LN or was it an original story?  <br><br>She's in English Civil War, which would probably be covered in S3</br></br>  <br>Original but written by the author of the novels and the events have been mentioned a few times in the novels that came out after it.</br>  <br>In NT12 it's revealed that  the number six regularly gives out his identity to people who are less well off than he is who could use the name/reputation of a level 5 to better their situation.  As for agitate halation, he could've been there? I don't think he'd be drawn into fighting though.</br>  Serves her right, she's a blonde. <br>I'd gladly punch every single one of those bitches.</br>  <br><br>Aogami Pierce is best #6</br></br>  <br>/thread<br><br><br> Fisting </br></br></br></br>  <br>He was feeling threatened by her height</br>  <br>At least she's not a pooskin.</br>  <br>Blondes are worse than niggers.<br>At least niggers are just dumb animals who don't know any better. Blondes are actively malevolent cunts with zero empathy or compassion who just want to make you suffer for their amusement.</br></br>  <br>They both need to be put down on sight.</br>  <br> he's not a blonde Nordic or Germanic <br><br>Quick lets point and laugh at him</br></br></br>  <br>Nigger loving faggots like you are the reason the US is going down the shitter.</br>  <br>Niggers should be put down like animals.<br>Blondes should be slowly tortured, murdered and dismembered.<br><br> being a subhuman snownigger <br>No thanks.<br><br><br> implying I like niggers <br>It's just blondes are so subhuman, they are worse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Niggers should be put down like animals. <br><br>Why waste all that money when you can get sport out of hunting them?</br></br></br>  <br> just read NT7 <br>Oh boy, you're on for a wild ride.</br></br>  <br>Because being animals is the natural state of a nigger, so they'll be more experienced in surviving than urban kiddies with guns.</br>  <br>my theory is Rensa's power is based on #6<br>screen cap this if ya want</br></br>    <br><br>I think that the true number six send the fake there. So even thought he didn't come personally, he did intervene to stop the "heroes".</br></br>  <br> implying I'm wrong </br>  <br>That's all part of the thrill of the hunt.</br>  <br>#6 has connection with magic. That's my theory</br>  <br>This. Touma always loses his shit when a magic side shitter fucks with one of his friends who isn't involved in that nonsense.</br>  <br>Doubtful. In any case, the whole point of the character and his ability is that no one knows who he is. Revealing his identity at this point would ruin it.</br>  <br>Himegami was never relevant again</br>  Reminder kakine is the true No.1 esper of AC.  <br>Please go back in the fridge Kakine.</br>  <br>go away volley ball</br>  <br>/poI/ is leaking again</br>  <br>Since when does /pol/ hate blondes?</br>  <br>He's a lolicon.</br>  <br>Loving delicious flat chest doesn't make you a lolicon. <br>Speaking of btw. Wasn't Misaki pettanko when Touma fell for her?</br></br>  <br>But its not ranked by the power but how useful esper is to researchers so whats the point of those numbers anyway</br>  <br>That's what a weak jealous fag would say. <br><br><br>Only the strongest get ranked at the top.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah man because Gunha is weakest of level 5 espers right? Im pretty sure he could beat everyone other than first and second.</br>  Have you ever curious on who is the level 5 who can be penetrated by Mental Out?  <br>I was expecting this to the the first response.<br><br>You threw it off, so fuck you.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Index manga <br><br>Are we still on the ice boats?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gunha never wins a fight.</br>  If she wears a belt why the fuck doesn't she actually use it?    why is it that the girls touma is attracted to are the complete opposite of what the majority of the fans like?  <br>Same reason he punches everyone else: she wasn't living her life correctly.</br>  <br>That can't be right. That would actually mean that #6 is not only sane but also incredibly reasonable, which is impossible for a level 5.</br>  <br> ―Uu… Although this isn‘t the case, your warmth has infected my entire body. I really feel <br> like handing myself over to you……‖ <br> Seeing Kamijo complaining like this, Fukiyose closes one eye before smashing a fist into <br> the back of Kamijo‘s head, causing his head to sink into the breasts of the painter nee-san. <br> That nee-san didn‘t shriek, as she gently pushes Kamijo‘s head aside, saying, <br> ―Haiz. Let me see, are you alright? You, cannot, fight, on like this forever. It‘s rare to have <br> such an activity, so of course you have to make some wonderful memories.‖ <br> Wah, Kamijo‘s looks like he‘s going to cry. <br> ―So magnanimous! So completely different from those girls who bite others and those who <br> give others a punch! I‘m about to sink in this warmth!‖ <br> Kamijo shouted out, ―Watch closely, this is a mature woman; watch and learn, you iron wall girl!‖ <br> This is an apology for knocking into you. Normally, you Japanese would lower your head <br>to apologise, but we normally do this.‖<br>―Ah……that‘s how it is?‖<br>―Ara ara. Do I need to give a kiss?‖<br>Poof!! Kamijo does a spit-take.<br>After trembling for a while, the pure and innocent Kamijo Touma shouts,<br>―I WANT A KISS!!‖<br><br>Touma really needs to run into her again so she can just give him a big soft hug so he can heal from all that torture.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This blonde bitch wiped the floor with Tsuchimikado  <br><br> Touma was able land a punch on her  <br><br><br>Why is it everything that Touma does such bs?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Touma wants someone he can depend on, not someone who depends on him.</br>  <br>Gunha's actually ability is Jobber King. He had the ability to become as strong as necessary and gain any powers, to show how overpowered his actual opponent is when he loses to them.</br>    <br>Touma was able to punch her after runefag distracted her</br>  <br><br>So he is some sort of kumagawa?<br><br> "It's not my fault, it's GUTS fault!" </br></br></br></br>   Finally get to read NT13  <br> My nigga fiamma is back <br> He jobs already  <br> Even worse there's a fiamma 2.0 now <br><br>Fucking Dropped.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No Idea but she's easily one of the hottest chicks if not the hottest in this series.</br>  <br><br>Because she's evil.<br><br>And when it's good versus evil, it wouldn't be right not to punch her (before she punches you).</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Do people like Fiamma?

It's not a joke filename. It's just room 101 actually being empty.</br>  <br>I like this meme.</br>  <br>Guess they are saving the trip for the next ova  or season 3 .</br>  This past episode was just perfect. The teru teru bozu arc was absolutely hilarious and the Flatty-san arc was simply beautiful, from its mono no aware to its heartwarming climax illustrating the innocent, youthful realization of the miracle of life. The climax in particular, the way it was directed with the music and the interspersed shots of nature and the cycle of life... just fucking stunning. Why is this so AOTY?  <br>This episode demonstrated the transient beauty of life in a way I haven't seen since YKK.</br>  <br>Terrible.</br>  <br>I will always remember this scene as the exact moment she became my waifu.</br>  <br>Didn't you see her sniffle and wipe her eyes?</br>  Is there going to be a season 3?   Next episode will be an anime original featuring school pool <br><br>Besides being surprised that the school actually has one, does this mean we will see Hotaru in a school swimsuit  and more Koma-chan misery? </br></br>  <br>I sure hope so. I'm just about ready to move this show into the 1a/1b slot of GOAT SoLs along with ARIA. One more episode this season the quality of S1E04, S1E10 or S2E04 and that should do it.</br>  why isn't Komari wearing her sukumizu?  <br>They appeared fully clothed, not even in swimsuits, while in the pool in the preview.<br> Thank God. The last thing we need is these threads next week circlejerking over middle and elementary schoolers in swimsuits. </br></br>  <br>Since you seem to favour the Renge episodes, what did you think of the OVA? I thought that was around the same level of quality and high amount of Renge-focused introspection.</br>  <br>This hitted me hard, since my dog is sick and getting surgery tomorrow.</br>  <br><br>Well, we technically had that when S1 aired didn't it?</br></br>  <br> S1E10 <br>That episode was magical.</br></br>  <br>I have no mouth and I must scream.</br>  <br>I love every NNB episode and loved the OVA but I'm not sure the OVA lives up to those three episodes I mentioned. I may be biased because the OVA was &lt;720p. <br>I feel that Renge is the show's most unique, entertaining character by a good margin. I don't think those episodes are the best episodes because they're Renge episodes, though. I think it's more that the writing and directing of this show really seem to excel when they're focusing on heartwarming moments and they seem to focus these heartwarming moments around Renge.</br></br>  <br>only if they cry from below.</br>  <br>Good answer. I guess you can't just say all the episodes are great but I agree with what you're saying. I personally find the Natsumi/Komari sisterhood moments to be some of the best heartwarming stuff too, but it might also be a personal bias owing to it reminds me of how me and my sister were as kids. But just the understated thoughtful moments are the best, like when they run away and Natsumi sees that a cat stole food from them to feed her kittens, and that's what finally makes her think "we should go home."<br><br>I hope for more Natsumi/Komari stuff this season, at least one or two episodes.</br></br></br>  Best girl. She'll become a great mother and wife.  <br> She'll become a great mother <br>Will probably need C-section.</br></br>  <br><br>That's not Koma-chan</br></br>  <br> giving birth to children is only something 7 feet tall giantesses can do <br><br>No, anon. No.</br></br></br>  Holy FUCK this show looks depressing. I've never watched this but is this the show's selling point?  <br>Komari is the one who needs a C-section and a 7th-month delivery, Natsumi will be fine.</br>  <br>People will claim otherwise but all the depressing episodes are also the most popular ones.</br>  <br>What a depressing edit.</br>  <br>She was always best girl. If you rewatch S1 and pay attention you will notice that Natsumi is usually very aware of social situations and the feelings of the people around her and acts accordingly. More often than any other character she does small things and gestures that makes others feel good about themselves and have fun. This episode was just the most obvious example.</br>  <br>This post contain so much truth</br>  <br> entire anime original episode <br><br>Does the school really have a pool in the manga?</br></br></br>  <br> the temptation of the shovel <br>She's so used to digging graves for Vietnamese children that it's become a reflex.</br></br>  <br> crop her shop her <br>CROP HER SHOP HER DROP HER TOP HER BOP HER COP HER MOP HER HOP HER</br></br>  <br>Give me templates.</br>  <br> Tfw the only time we see Renge smiling is when she's wearing a mask she made herself <br>This shit is too heavy for me.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I don't understand but I like it.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br><br>I thought that was Koma.

I wasn't kidding about the lineart that Sentai fucked up on the HS release.<br>http://screenshotcomparison.com/com<wbr>parison/134114<br>I haven't experienced Vivid's subs for this show as I can't wait for their releases as this is literally tied for my favorite show ever now, but Vivid's release is the best in terms of video quality despite losing about vertical pixels of resolution because it lacks source defects that the HS releases have, especially the fucked up lineart.</br></wbr></br></br>  <br><br> lawsuit <br> ip <br> public tracker <br><br>How about not living in a retarded country?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Torrenting was not involved.<br> implying putting your IP on a private tracker is safe </br></br>  <br>how's life in donbass?</br>  <br>How many rotten VC ears did she keep hidden in the closet?</br>  <br>Yes we know whay XDCC is.<br>Thing is nobody fucking cares because you downloaded a few shitty animes.</br></br>  <br>I'm Amerifat and I cannot argue with this post.</br>  <br><br>FTP or DC?</br></br>  <br>My little klansmen can't possibly be this cute</br>  <br> Jordan? </br>  <br>That difference is small enough for me not to care about it, seems like it'd be impossible to notice in motion without A/B testing it.<br><br>Thanks for the comparison though.</br></br></br>  <br> how the fuck do you know my name? </br>  <br>They're coming to get you Jordan.</br>  So guys <br>Which is better ARIA or Non non biyori<br>I personally prefer ARIA, akari is best girl</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I don't notice it in motion, but I mention it anyways because some people are really autistic about this sort of thing and I'm just trying to be helpful about it.</br>  <br>I'm coming around to accepting NNB as ARIA's equal, anon. This past episode helped a lot. It was as well-done as anything in The Origination.<br>Akari is amazing. I think Renge is equally amazing as a character.</br></br>  <br>Aria is better but NNB has it's own appeal aswell</br>  <br>They are both worse than gochusa and kinmosa</br>  <br>NNB isn't finished, will have half the episodes, and won't be able to conclude like Aria did.</br>  Wait, what? Hotarun arrived again? What it's going on?  <br> kinmosa <br><br>I disagree, NNB and ARIA have struck me more heavily and more emotionally than that gay shit ever will.<br>It is not comparable.</br></br></br></br>  <br> and won't be able to conclude like Aria did. <br>In terms of literal method or quality? If quality, there's a hell of an assumption, as it's a hell of an assumption to assume that this season will be the last season of the show.<br>I think if you go back and rewatch the first 17 episodes of ARIA and NNB, you'll find that NNB, in this case, is quite a bit better.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Flashbacks and/or timetravel. Possibly drugs.</br></br>  What's wrong with Vivid? "memes" is not an answer, I'd like tangible replies and examples.  <br>And none of those will be remembered in the next 5 years<br>Aria is start in 2007, it's been 8 years and it's still regarded as one of the best iyashikei<br>I can see people will talk about NNB in the next 5 years<br>I'm not even sure if you're baiting</br></br></br></br>  <br>NNB isn't very emotional though. It's comfy and healing, same as kinmosa and gochusa. (Those those 2 have more comedy and less comfort)</br>  <br>I've been disappointed far too many times to believe that anything will get a complete adaptation.</br>  <br>I have Hidamari Sketch as my all time heavyweight champion of SoLs, but Aria and NNB are also good, as are all SoLs. I don't think we should enter into a heated discussion about which one is best, but simply enjoy them in our own way.</br>  <br>S1 certainly sold like hotcakes. I expect a sales boost from this past episode as well. I know it wasn't just me and this ANN reviewer talked about in another thread right now who thought this past episode was extremely special.</br>  <br>Not him but im curently re-watching all three sesason of ARIA, it's still as enjoyable and as relaxing as the first time i watching it<br>NNB has it own charm but ARIA is still the best in the last decade</br></br>  <br>I think the main advantage ARIA has is the soundtrack. I love them both so much.</br>   "Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until their death. I shall take no cycle ride, hold no flute, father no shrimps. I shall wear no twin tails and win no test. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the tank. I am the shield that guards the realms of tadpole shrimps. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come."   <br>Kinmosa and Gochiusa might actually be talked about 5-10 years from now as SoL trendsetters. They've practically carved out a new subgenre for themselves, a subgenre with yuri as a primary draw and seemingly painstakingly engineered to be as hyper-cute as possible, even moreso than in the past of Japan's famously kawaii-obsessed culture.<br>I'm not saying they're great anime. They're cute so I like them but they're not great. Outside of their cuteness, and Karen, they're fairly average.</br></br>  <br>No, anon. Just no.</br>  Not gonna lie, this episode felt a bit forced, it was cute and all, but the funny part and the sad part both felt like they were trying too hard with the given situation respectively.<br><br>Even so, great episode, but is gonna be very difficult to top keitai or ruler warfare.</br></br>  <br>Terrible taste.</br>  <br> this episode felt a bit forced <br>It was pretty much the least forced-feeling drama I've seen in a long fucking time in anime. Opinions.</br></br>  <br>I liked the funny part, but yeah I agree the sad part felt a little forced.</br>  <br><br>They're the best, so of course trolls be trollan. Just check their releases for yourself and see the difference to the competition.</br></br>  <br>Well, yeah, if you gonna compare it to the rest of anime, it applies NNB as a whole.<br><br>For NNB standards this episode was jut a tad forced, but this is my opinion.</br></br></br>  <br> a little girl is sad because her pets died <br>yeah too forced better kill off Hotaru that is real drama</br></br>  <br>You know nothing Ren-chan.</br>  <br><br>How was it forced? It was a simple, plausible mono no aware story about how life is short but beautiful in its simultaneous transience and permanence.</br></br>  <br><br>That was the given situation, nothing forced about it, but the delivery felt a bit forced.<br><br>Notice how I use the word "feel", something about it that I can't quite put finger on.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw oniichan knows where to hide the body, needs not say a word </br>  <br>What was Hotaru's crime for her to be sent to the shacks?</br>  <br>I just learned that Tadpole Shrimp are shitty pets. Why did nobody warn her before getting too attached?

In fact, Aya's crush on Yoko is basically the only interesting thing in that mediocre slushpile.

The posts up the seemed, to me, to be citing yuri content as one of the elements contributing to the mediocrity of the cited anime; claiming that the Class S elements are being added to anime as a cynical grab for moe otaku viewership, and that they are lowering the quality of the niche as a whole.<br><br>I don't really know where I'm going with this.

As much hate as nano.RIPE gets, it's a lovely song. There's a section near the end with clapping that works perfectly with the tune.<br><br><br>Was this Guu sitting with Renge? It looks more like a cat when it's animated but I don't recall the Miyauchi family having any other pets.

It's more evident during certain sections of the song (especially the first half of the full version) and it's my only gripe with the song. Other than that, it fits the series perfectly and I can let it slide. Other nano.RIPE songs are not my cup of tea, however.</br>  <br>I really like the song when the visuals are the girls marching.</br>  <br>I don't really understand how to be honest. <br><br>Usually when we  non-ironically  label something as forced, we mean it in the sense that complications are shoehorned into the story to induce grief by the characters, usually by truck or anime AIDS. In this case, everything happened just as it would in a normal real life setting (even the shrimps getting kept as pets then abruptly killing everyone's mood by dying). And instead of building up exposition to try and maximise the grief, or resorting to the usual overwrought displays of grief to induce the audience to tears, they simply focus the camera on the four girls and let everything else play out as it would. It's anything but forced.</br></br></br>  <br><br> &gt;Get good at fucking everything because there's nothing else to do <br><br>I read this very differently and paired with the last line it was pretty hot.</br></br></br></br>    STOP LIKING LITTLE GIRLS AND PANTIES YOU NERDS ARE KILLING ANIME  <br>You can fuck off anytime you stupid normalfag.</br>  lol you are right bro ;D  Why did they have to ruin her character by giving her such a shitty VA?  <br>The VA is not shit.<br>It just doesn't fit.<br>Blame the one who casted her.</br></br></br>   I actually love that VA.   <br>This, bugs me too.</br>  <br>wow you have such shit taste</br>  <br>It fits per perfectly</br>  <br><br>OP is a cad</br></br>  Yeah, her voice is just fail  She is a midget turbodyke.

It's like if you were a devout Catholic and wanted to date that shy honors student who didn't have a thing for you at all, and then she randomly tried to give you a handjob under your desk in the middle of class or something while salivating.</br>  <br>This. I've loved her in everything she's been in up until now, but she just doesn't work in this role.</br>  <br> He's literally been told sex is evil his entire life <br>no, his dad taught him otherwise. He's been pushing himself to believe that.</br></br>  <br>The government's been telling him it's evil, and he's believed them. Treat him like a Catholic from an atheistic family, if you prefer.</br>  Better question. What's the point of this thing?<br>She's not funny, her voice is shit, she's not attractive and looks more like a meth whore than supposedly a quiet person.</br>  <br> She's not funny, her voice is shit, she's not attractive <br>Are we talking about the same girl?</br></br>  <br>Character's design is shitty.</br>  <br>https://d.maxfile.ro/dpmlhiyjki.web<wbr>m</wbr></br>  <br>Seen this on /f/ a lot, but I will still love whoever did this forever.</br>  <br>I want to give her a private lesson on reproduction</br>  <br>Would she still act all quiet and monotone in the bedroom or would she let it all out?</br>  <br>She'd be quiet first, trying to just understand it scientifically, then she'd lose to the pleasure from the dick and become a moaning whore addicted to cock.</br>  <br><br>Why are you still hanging around these threads if you hate the show, then? Fuck off from them.</br></br>  <br>I think it's more like her voice is featured too much in the ep and kind of plays out the novelty of it. Arai is fun as a side character since a hilariously weird voice gives such characters some well, character, that prevented them from being forgettable. Also she was most memorable going fucking nuts as Kuroko while she doesn't really hit the same extremes in this show since it's not the same character.</br>  <br>There's no easy way to say this... you have shit taste. With time and treatment, it may improve, but the more likely scenario is that you'll have shit taste for the rest of your life. I am so sorry.</br>  <br>Its obvious they did it on purpose<br>Maybe to prevent her from becoming a sexualized meme<br><br> implying you will still jack off to your obaa-san loli </br></br></br></br>  <br> prevent <br> that implication <br>If that's the case, then they did a horrible job.<br>By the way, please stop calling everything a meme or using a name.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They really want people to stop sexualizing loli, and they are being successful at it.</br>  <br>Man, Japan can't do anything right nowadays.<br>And I don't think that it makes sense to like Saotome for her loli traits, because after all the only thing she has is her size. I'll even go a bit further and say she isn't a loli at all. Tiny as fuck and amazing, but not a loli.</br></br>  <br>Or rather, scratch that, she's on her way to become a legal loli. How old is she anyway? Is there even a term for someone who isn't quite an adult but still looks like a loli? Legal loli or lolihag doesn't quite work in here.</br>  <br> Man, Japan can't do anything right nowadays. <br>That's true, and your pic is related, since it shows nothing, as expected from anything "loli service". It is nothing.</br></br>  <br>This. Anna didn't know what a dick even was let alone have enough time to figure out how to stick it inside her. Though that doesn't change the fact that she is now a stalker, despite freaking the fuck out about being stalked herself just the previous episode</br>  <br>She's supposed to be a disgusting looking little runt midget so her voice is perfect.</br>  <br><br>I like you guys.<br>I know /a/ has lots of alpha males who wouldn't flustered AT ALL when a beautiful and "pure" girl suddenly aggressively wants their dicks.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd probably be horrified and pass out from the mental trauma it caused.</br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128749959 <br>In all honesty I wish this meme would die</br>  <br>Well, you and I are a pussy by /a/ 'standard', then.</br>  <br>never change, /a/</br>  <br>Lol fag</br>  <br><br>Nigga you got to remember, if they even try to do that shit, the bracelets they're wearing are going to trigger and they're both going to be locked in prison for the rest of their lives or some shit.</br></br>  nani sore  <br>Wrong hag dude</br>  <br>Except this is probably the only time this has ever been done where it makes sense.

NOT ME! <br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  THE ONE QUESTION I NEED TO KNOW:<br><br> People that read the LN, does anyone actually fuck or is this the same old haremshit that goes nowhere ? </br></br>  Is the show worth picking up? Is the MC a cliché harem protagonist?  <br> He's literally been told sex is evil his entire life <br>No you idiot, he's the MC because he had the upbringing where he knows that's no the case.</br></br>  <br> I-I''ll just imply they're completely asocial losers who wouldn't react in a situation literally any teenage boy would react in! </br>  <br>How the fuck do those things even work? You can't draw lewd pictures, but you can strip naked, put your panties over someones head then lick them from head to toe?</br>   shitty VA <br><br>I think her voice is great <br><br>I tend too like VA eith uniwue voice like hers.<br><br>Kike Judo for example</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Except this is probably the only time this has ever been done where it makes sense. <br> LN gives a surface level excuse <br> It only applies in specific instances where the plot could accidentally move forward and isn't actually reflective of the characters at all <br>Sorry, I was just caught off guard because I honestly never thought people were stupid enough to accept characterization done that poorly.<br><br><br>It's not haremshit, just love triangleshit that goes nowhere.<br><br><br> Is the MC a cliché harem protagonist? <br> Super valiant white knight who saves girls and is selfless so people can self insert and pat themselves on the back <br> Rejects sexual advances <br>What do you think?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You need to remember that Okuma's dad was arrested and he was socially ostracized because of his Dad's lewdness and dirty jokes, so he does have a reason to be opposed to sex.</br>  <br>He knows on a fundamental level that it isn't inherently evil.</br>  HEIL AINZ <br>HEIL AINZ <br>HEIL AINZ <br>HEIL AINZ</br></br></br>  <br>Is this like the 6th thread tonight already?</br>  Needs more LN translations  <br> AINZ <br> NAZI <br>Fuck off, i bet that bony guy has a nazi minions.</br></br></br>  <br>I fucking wish /a/ was back to 15 threads a minute speed.</br>    I finally figured out what I don't like about Albedos armor. It makes her look like a heartless.  Someone post the gif in which he is laughing.  <br>That looks like a space marine for some reason to me. Must be the beer.</br>  Excuse me,<br><br>Best girl coming through</br></br>  tfw you will never pledge your loyalty to papa bones  I originally hated that the first 2 episodes were just explanations of everything, but now that we're 2 more in I'm actually glad I got a lot of the background info out of the way. Now I can just enjoy the show as they continue with a little new info each episode.<br><br>Also<br> Heil Ainz </br></br></br>  <br>But that's just a chair. Real best girl here.</br>  <br> Retards <br> Best anything </br></br>  <br>The literallywhofags have arrived</br>  <br>Even though I read the LN I only just realized why people keep calling her Chair.</br>  Originally wasn't even going to give this show a try due to the CGI in the trailer. Glad I did though because I am loving this fucking show.  Looking forward to Albedo getting Boned in doujins   <br> that <br> best </br></br>  <br>Not sure if this had already been made but I had a mighty need to make a stitch from the ending for a possible vertical dual monitor setup</br>  It's pretty ironic how most of the complaints about this episode is how Ainz being so OP means there's no tension in the series but I've yet to come across anyone calling him a Gary Stu. Apparently people DO know the difference between being OP and being a Gary Stu. Who knew?  If you think the best character is anyone other than PA or Albedo, you're solely mistaken. All others would probably turn on Ainz the minute their creators show up.<br>Automatic disqualification from the Best Character contest.</br>  <br>like 90% of the complaints about this series are people throwing cheap bait against the wall to see what sticks. the other 10% generally being op haters or lnfags (myself included) that feel a lot of the skipped dialogue is losing out on world and character building.</br>  <br>What if my favourite character is   Brain  </br>  <br>Good choice. He's going to outGazef Gazef himself pretty soon.</br>  <br>Only thing I dislike is the CGI angles looking like robots and the lack of intense sound. I expected the black hole to make noise, though I can accept that.<br>The manga reaction faces got my hopes up in certain regards</br></br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br>The series is surprisingly easy to depend, especially considering the OPness of Ainz. I guess making the title OVERLORD guaranteed you'd know what the hell you were getting yourself into.</br>  <br> I expected the black hole to make noise <br>The intimidation of the quiet black hole was pretty great though.</br></br>  <br> I expected the black hole to make noise <br>clearly you don't understand how black holes work.</br></br>  I'm glad the next two episodes will give us a break from action on the scale of this and episode 3. The next time something on that scale happens will be the end of volume 2 and 3 right? So, say, episodes 7 and 13?  <br>I think things like this are so rare that I'm just savoring getting to see an intelligent evil lich in action. If the whole show was about him just floating around murdering weak assholes it would be a problem but they're obviously not going for that.</br>    <br>Looks nice, especially with him sitting in the abyss just waiting like he's the last boss of Nazarick.</br>  <br>The way I see it is 5 is adventurer meet up, 6 Battle with the forest king, 7 set up for zombie apocalypse, and 8 Devil May Cry: skeleton edition.</br>  <br>HEIL AINZ<br><br> I expected the black hole to make noise </br></br></br>  <br>Be happy that we are getting full chapters instead of individual parts like usal</br>  <br>I lost my shit</br>  <br>That was quick.</br>  <br>Shut it chair</br>  <br>She's gonna be a main character in the next few episode anon</br>  <br>Need a complete webm of him summoning the angel of bait holding a fish hook scepter. Then Ainz deleting it with a sage.</br>  <br> Talkin shit about Ainz's chair. <br>You'd best take that back about Nazarick's top Overlord approved seat.</br></br>  <br>but the best way to defeat bait is by ignoring it, not saging.</br>  <br> tfw my webm is getting popular in this thread <br><br>I wish Papa Bone would be proud of me</br></br></br>  <br>Good job, anon. Just wanted to spread your ingenuity.</br>  <br>Main character who fucks shit up because she can't follow simple instructions <br><br> implying saying Shalltear is best girl is bait </br></br></br>  <br><br>at least its better than defeating bait with "OP is a fag"</br></br>  So let me get this straight, other players landed in the past, and they were the ones that taught high level magic, well, "high", to people like the Theocracy? Does this imply the magic is inherently the same mechanic, just fully customizable here? Will Ainz start making his own spells?  <br> OP <br>that's like saying "omg he killed that rat! so OP!"</br></br>  <br>How much dialogue has been skipped? I've been following these threads on and off and kept reading that it has been adapted pretty well so far.</br>  <br>It has, but you have purists who feel like skipping anything at all is an unforgivable insult. Then they get all huffy and think you're shitting on the source material by saying it's fine to skip stuff, because they take it so personally. <br><br>They're already going really slow by taking 4 eps per volume, any slower and they'd barely get through volume 2 by the end of the cour.</br></br></br>  <br>Tons, the author is really generous with inner dialog.</br>  <br>Maybe magic is like engineering; all the parts have always been there, you just need to know how to put it all together.</br>  <br>Well, it's certainly possible that no magic existed before Yggdrasil players showed up and taught them long ago. What do you mean customizable though? As far as I can tell these guys are apparently casting the exact same spells Ainz is familiar with. And while they might be "inventing" spells it may just be them learning to duplicate untaught Yggdrasil spells that the original teachers didn't know.</br>  <br>There's magic Ainz doesn't know of. The contingency magic that murdered the one dude they were torturing.</br>  <br><br>Thanks, maybe I'll actually read the LN then, I think I have the mega link saved somewhere.</br></br>  People are saying that Demiurge misunderstood Momonga when he was talking about the treasures. What exactly did he misunderstand  <br>Even though that this is a faithful adaptation, I find it hard to not be disappointed when some core dialogue is left out.<br><br>For example, even an extra three minutes would have laid the background for what happens in Volumes 2 and 3. All Madhouse had to do was, say, have only one song play during episode 1, and remove the ED during episode 4.</br></br></br>  <br>Ainz said the world conquest would be enjoyable as a joke but Demiurge took it literally</br>  <br>True, but don't forget that while Ainz has an absurdly high capacity at 700 spells known, Yggdrasil has 6000+ spells in all so he might not be familiar with them all. Hard to say one way or another though the contingency magic and magic chanters inventing spells seems to prove what you say.</br>  <br><br>Should I just start Vol 1 or was it covered pretty well?</br></br>  <br>Start Vol 1.</br>  <br>Is that why he was also shocked when Ainz said it while they were flying?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4Xu<wbr>kocjXhSs</wbr>  [ ]<br> "Don't you gimme your love and passion" <br> not "Won't*" <br>I can't help but be triggered by engrish in songs that have potential.</br></br></br></br>  So, is Stronoph, or whatever his name is, a reincarnated player?  <br>Yes</br>  Why do you guys like this show so much?<br><br>Seems kind of plain to me.</br></br>  <br><br><br>This was some bad translation. How the fuck does 'Banzai' translate to 'Heil'?<br><br>Would have been better translated as 'Long live Lord Ainz'. Jesus these subs are bad and my Japanese skills consists of a few years of school.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ALL HEIL AINZ OOAL GOWN<br>ALL HEIL AINZ OOAL GOWN<br>ALL HEIL AINZ OOAL GOWN</br></br></br>  <br><br>What if she actually does not want you to give her your love and passion?</br></br>  <br>I'll bite. No I think its literally don't, she doesn't want it. (She has ainz you insect)</br>  <br> that pic <br><br>I kek'd.</br></br></br>  <br> fucks shit up <br>Coming from a chairfag I don't think that means too much anon</br></br>  <br><br> inflexible <br><br>shit maid, can't even bend her over your desk<br>0/10 can not bang</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Now that I read that a third time, that actually makes sense. I still prefer "won't" through.</br></br>  <br>Standing up sex is best sex.</br>  <br>Albedo.<br>Shalltear.<br>Cocytus.<br>Papa Bones. <br>That's why.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ainz has a throne not a desk.</br>  <br>Personally, it's the character interactions. The Guardians are so loyal to Ainz that it's just terrific. Equally entertaining are the Guardian's relationship with each other. Episode 2 of the anime as well as Volume 3, the drama CD, and the last half of Volume 4 all display (to me) fantastic interactions. Fight scenes are pretty chill too.</br>  <br>Science is the study of our universes magic<br>Pretty cool when you think about it that way</br></br>  <br>I totally support Ainz taking Naberal as his wife after Albedo forces him to marry put a real ring on that finger. I mean heck, people already think they're doing the buisness behind the scenes.</br>  <br> Interesting Characters <br> Theme (MC is the OP evil overlord but evil neutral) <br> Skellington protagonist <br>   He chooses to use minimum force in order to carefully explore the world until the situation calls for it <br>Other than that, its Log Horizon except less about being a tactician mayor and more about being a conqueror.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> its Log Horizon <br>Wow it's like I'm really on Reddit......</br></br>  <br>I wasn't aware Overlord was about a socially retarded outcast, glitching raidbosses</br>  <br>Are you new?</br>  <br>It's pretty much the same wish fulfillment bullshit as Danmachi. Nice Skeleton aesthetic, though.</br>  <br>Ainz has already daughter-zomed the entirety of Nazarick. Only CD, and Chair Jr. have any hope now.</br>  <br> Danmachi <br>Oh okay, you're just spouting random shows that fall into a similar category.</br></br>   Heil <br>Does he have a nazi minion? If no then nope I ain't calling mr Bones that.</br>    <br>He created a a level 100 Nazi uniform doppelganger, does that count?</br>  <br>You know he does anon</br>  Will this show get an s2?  <br>Hopefully not, because its gonna be almost all lizardmen and then uncle insect rekting them.</br>  <br>If it sells well enough</br>  <br>He has a desk too.<br>Bitches love desks.</br></br>  <br>Considering he cares enough for the game and not being a normalfag like his other guild members are, not really far from the truth.</br>  <br>Well, it is in the OP</br>  <br>But anon chairs aren't supposed to be bent over desks</br>  <br>And he will do the Gendo pose on the desk in volume 9</br>  <br>He has a job, why would he make a rule for his guildies to follow, that he wouldn't? They all just left the game after being burned out from getting everything required to make the guild staff. Just because he kept logging into the game, doesn't mean he's socially inept.</br>  <br>Of course not, silly.<br>Chairs go under desks.</br></br>  <br>I would still like to see that.</br>  <br>It's fine, you can admit the real reason you want vol 4 animated.</br>  <br>It's Funi, right? What can you expect from a bunch of retards wearing traffic cones on their heads?</br>  <br>Why hasn't he bothered thinking about going back to his world if he had friends and family to go back to? He seems to care about the game than his real life which started the whole story to begin with, being fussy that people in his guild left him only realizing that they didn't leave without giving a damn about the times they shared. A normal faggot wouldn't have sperged and slam the table dramatically and would've just logged off. Arguably, he could still be socially inept when he has godlike abilities that earns the respect and fear of everyone around him.</br>  <br> Ains <br> Ainz <br> Nazi </br></br></br>  <br>MIND BLOWN. AINZ IS ACTUALLY GOING TO SET UP THE 4TH REICH.</br>  <br>Because he isn't in the game, he's in a different world.<br>And that world happens to be far better than the 22nd-century hellscape he came from.</br></br>  <br>His job is a soulless office worker job in a future world that seems pretty shit, he gets along fine in life but he cherished his guild and could never let go of that.<br><br>He's interested in going home, but there is absolutely no hint at all how to do that.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Doesn't he specifically say that he has nobody to go back to?</br></br>  <br>Yes, in the intro in fact.</br>  <br>This was explained in, like, the second episode, maybe first. He said that he doesn't have family or friends outside of the game. All he does is wake up, work all day, then go home and plays the game until he sleeps.<br><br>He said that was a really shitty life.</br></br></br>  <br>He's never expressed interest in going home. He says in the first volume that he has no friends or family to go back to in the real world.</br>  <br>Yep, his family's dead and his only freinds were his guildmates</br>  <br>Then get his ass kicked by Zaryushu or Hamsuke.</br>  <br>He's a magic caster, he has to sage.</br>  I want to do illegal things to Narberal!  <br>It could be worse.<br>He could go down to an autoattack from Victim.</br></br>  <br>I need to commission somebody to fufill all the fetishes.</br>  <br>Yeah actually. He made a shapeshifting nazi accountant back when he was chuuni</br>  <br>Did you not read book 2?</br>  <br>Can Victim even auto attack?</br>  <br>His physical attack is two points higher than his magic attack, for what it's worth.</br>  <br>...It is literally its entire method of attack</br>  <br>You sure anon?</br>  <br>Pee on me! Or worse.</br>  <br>Definately.</br>  <br>Sure.</br>  So Novel readers does Ainz ever stop being OP( as in getting his ass whooped ever)?<br><br>kinda hope he is OP all the way through. seems pretty cool with all these different items and abilities</br></br>  <br>Well, he does put on an act of getting his ass kicked and has a rather close fight.</br>  <br><br><br>this artist is great.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's just that damn good, mang. Many of us, not only myself, started the anime, then moved onto the manga, then moved onto the LN to keep consuming the content of Overlord.<br><br>The last time I went so far for a series, was Haurhi's Disappearance movie back in '09 I believe, around there.<br><br>So yeah, fuck you kid, it's great.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>What a beast.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm in the same situation. After the second episode I started reading the LN. Don't know why but this series has seriously captivated me.</br>  <br> jews <br> anyone that doesn't please me for free is a jew <br>lel</br></br></br>  <br>They also translated "majin" as just "Demon".</br>  <br>Sometimes people do stuff that brings little to no profit for fun for themselves or others, shocking, right?<br>I know being jewish is hard, but try to pretend you're a human too.</br></br>  <br>Well they used Akuma as Devil, so what would be Demon?</br>  People that read the LN's, does he ever find another person from Yggdrasil, or even one of his guild mates?  <br>Unfortunately, it happens so rarely that it's hard to think of it as the rule, instead of the exception. The only show I can think of where people continually produced a show despite shitty sales is The World God Only Knows. Thank god for the fanartist who's doing all of these Naberal + Nazerick member though.</br>  <br>Nigga what? Are you talking about Madhouse or Funimation here?</br>  <br> Kind of </br>  Any request for webm, transparent, or stitches?  <br>I'd suffer through Lizardmen stuff to see Cocytus and the undead army, plus volumes 5 and 6.</br>  <br>But are you willing to sit through multiple episodes of almost nothing by Climb?</br>  <br>I almost want to say that the biggest segments of continuous Climb shouldn't take more than the first 12 min of the episode.</br>  Why skeletons are so great?   MAH WONDERFUL BEAUTIFUL DIVINE MASTER OF EVERYTHING ALL HAIL LORD SKULL ALL HAIL HIS REIGN <br> repeat 100 times <br><br>This shit is awful<br>Every single episode has basically been non stop sasuga oniisama.<br>Even Mahouka wasn't this terrible with cock sucking and circlejerking</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a archangel, he has some spells that come with the racial category, as well as job spells. <br><br>His most prominent ability is his  raid wiper nuke , but he should be able to fight by himself. He's probably stronger than most of the New World inhabitants by level alone.</br></br></br>  <br>Because there is  one inside of you </br>  <br>I'm still upset that there's no Cocytus Naberal.</br>  <br>Deliberately being overpowered isn't Gary Stu. Gary Stu is when you're supposed to be "normal" but you're blessed with plot armor.<br><br>For example, Kirito is supposed to be just another player but he somehow gets a unique Dual Wield skill in a video game and he gets to cheat death through willpower. That's Gary Stu.<br><br>Being at level cap and annihilating level 1 mobs is not Gary Stu.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have a pretty good idea.</br>  Why do you keep calling vampire loli a chair?  Remember to thank your saviour  Is the LN translated?  <br>its an epic meme from the ln</br>  <br>Ainz uses her as a chair eventually as punishment</br>  <br>Is it really a punishment ? Wouldn't she love it?</br>  <br>You misunderstand, it's for when he wants to punish himself.</br>  <br>http://lmgtfy.com/?q=overlord+light<wbr>+novel<br>Be thankful! I-It's not like I want to help you or anything!</br></wbr></br>  <br> it's for when he wants to punish himself <br><br>How's riding a vampire loli a punishment ?</br></br></br>  <br>Imagine finding yourself in that situation only to realize that you no longer have a dick. Not that your lich-feelings would let you enjoy it, anyway.</br>  <br>truly horrific.</br>  <br>He could almost certainly conjure up a penis.<br><br>The problem would be motivation to do so.</br></br></br>  <br>Having to sit on worst girl is pretty punishing if you ask me.</br>  I just want to see Albedo get boned.  BANZAI  A peasant girl turned bloody warlord takes over your town, kicks down your door, and tells you she's chosen you to warm her bed for the night.<br><br>What do you do?</br></br>  Succubi shouldn't be this moe.  <br>Of course they should</br>  <br>Warm her bed</br>  <br> you can't spell banzai without nazi </br>  <br>ALL HAIL AINZ</br>  It bet that it will only take another three volumes to Ainz rule the world (or at least conquest the neighboring countries in one way or another).  <br> abestacuteandachair.jpg <br><br>Keks were had.</br></br></br>  <br>Because she lacks proper stirrups or handlebars.</br>  <br>So moe</br>  <br>Isn't she the character that appears more in the series along with Ains?</br>  <br>I'd take one brown elf girl to go please.</br>  <br>OORU HAIRU BRITAINZIA</br>  <br>That's an imp brah-thah</br>  <br>Tomayto tomahto</br>  <br>midgets and vampires aren't the same tho</br>  Wait, is there going to be chibi episodes being released as well?  <br> facehugger maid <br> bimbo maid <br> /k/ommando maid <br> katana maid <br> furry maid <br>What's the last one?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Lupus is Mikako Komatsu  This guy has some impeccable teeth for living in a medieval world. His teeth are on par with Guts.  <br>read the epilogue for volume 1, she's a Succubus, Imp is just her starting race(just like Ainz was Skeleton mage)</br>  <br>Maid specialized in giving head.</br>  <br> Bimbo maid <br>Calling an outer god a bimbo is hardly conducive to long life (she's a shoggoth/Ubbo-Sathla)</br></br>  <br><br>She's both, I think. And possibly something else.</br></br>  <br> furry maid <br>Don't be stupid.</br></br>  <br>she's got 30 racial levels, 10 of which are Imp.<br>the max level a race or class can be is 15, 10, or 5.<br>thus she's got at least 3 races, and at most 5.</br></br></br>    <br><br>So imp, succubus and....what?</br></br>  <br> Lewd Beast </br>  <br>I'd guess fallen angel, and Succubi don't traditionally have feathery wings<br><br>your numbers are only accurate if each race is maxed out, if her creator went full retard she could have 21 different races</br></br></br>  <br> Semen Demon </br>  <br> How the fuck does 'Banzai' translate to 'Heil'? <br><br>It's actually surprisingly reasonably close going by original meaning.<br>The thing is, "Banzai" obviously completely lacks the Nazi-association.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anything about Ainz and Albedo please.<br>Or any stitchable scenes is fine too for collection purpose.</br></br>  I wonder if i show up guy from another vrmmorpg, like a not warhammer?  ainz-albedo dynamics remind me of these two  You wouldn't fug a npc right?  I love this anime, and I'm hyped for the next episodes, but there's something in the back of my head that tells me that this will become bad, like SAO did (first episodes good -&gt; rest bad)<br>Can any manga reader tell me if this will stay good?</br>  <br>This show is so fucking good. This has been a great summer so far.</br>  <br>aren't there other continents?</br>   You will never play Yggdrasil   So how does he fuck?  <br>Yggdrasil was pay2win as fuck, dude. It was most likely a terrible game.</br>  I don't understand why people fall in love with this series so much. Yeah, it's good, but it's not amazing. Just a solid 7.5/10.  <br>With his boner.</br>   Nigun's voice sounds so fucking familiar <br> Check his seiyuu <br> It's motherfucking Koyasu <br><br>You thought he was some second-rate voice actor, but it was HIM, DIO.</br></br></br></br>  <br> total level 62 <br> basic maths totals her levels up to 32 <br>Hold on a second here</br></br></br>  <br> others </br>  <br>Notice the "Others" listed at the bottom of her Job Level list.</br>  mfw this LN translation<br>Really wish I could into moon right now.</br>  <br>It's a 9 for me. Everything I would want out of this genre. It's really satisfying to see so much loyalty and admiration for the protag right from the jump for once. It's just somehow comfy too see a non-boy scout leader who still cares deeply for his followers. And of course, the sluts lusting for his boner.<br><br>Plus, the main character is a Lich. I fucking love skellies, Liches, Necromancers, and always thought they were misunderstood and made the villain too often.</br></br></br>   High Tiered Physical Nullification   <br><br>That's kind of lame.<br>Is it just so the author can throw in whatever he wants later or did the translators get lazy?</br></br></br>  <br>literally every single time these sheets are posted</br>  <br>Gorilla.</br>  <br> missing OTHERS <br>not all of her classes are listed, she's got 1 level of doppelganger and 62 class levels.<br>of those 62 class levels she's got at least 49 caster levels(every 7th caster level lets you cast one tier higher spells)</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.<br><br>Also, I don't know why the hell you'd think the translators got so lazy that they couldn't be bothered to write down the names of the other jobs. I mean, what? That's so irrational. Why bother translating the other names then?</br></br></br>  <br>If this gets to season 2 it has a small downtime but they payoff is totally worth it. Season 1 is mostly amazing though.</br>  <br>I would totally buy a figure of Mr Skeltal</br>  Am I the only who kinda doesn't like the name " Ainz ooal gown" ? Like, it's fine when they say "Lord Ainz" but whenever he says his full name I kinda cringe a bit. I honestly think "Momonga" was better. Hopefully it will grown on me  <br>Thanks m8</br>  <br> flying squirrel was better <br>que?</br></br>  <br><br>Where can I find the other profile cards for the other characters? Does Albedo have one?</br></br>  <br>Surprisingly relevant!</br>  <br>I keep thinking "own goal" when I see it, which is probably not the intention.</br>  <br>he was on GOMAD</br>  <br>Look it up on baka-tsuki.</br>  <br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA<br><br>The illustration archive.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>A spooky skeleton calls Flying Squirrel sounds scary as fuck.</br>  <br>Someone shoop Ainz's head to him.</br>  Muh OTP  ;_;   somebody post the LN art!  <br>I liked Momonga more at first, and was upset that he changes his name 4 episodes in, but apparently this <br> <br>Still, Ainz Ooal Gown is so 'Lich', it's growing on me pretty quickly</br></br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>I think not, it seems to be character driven and MC that doesn't use sword in online game genre seems to be more effective in this type of shows. Thing with SAO is its too focus on the MC being too OP with his sword.</br>  <br> they were misunderstood and made the villain too often. <br> Implying Papa Bones isn't 100% villain material </br></br>  <br>He's a bro though. Don't fuck with him, bow down like the lower life form you are, then you'll be alright.<br><br> You will never serve Ainz ;_; </br></br></br>   that fucking battle hamster in book 2 <br>I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't that.</br>  <br>SAO didn't even capture that glorious MMO feeling.<br>This shit not only makes me nostalgic as a MMO player, it also riles up the D&amp;D faggotry in me.<br><br>Fucking double deal, man.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I felt so bad for her. Thanks based Sebas</br>  <br> SAO didn't even capture that glorious MMO feeling. <br>I have never been so disappointed by the execution of a concept as I was with SAO.</br></br>  <br>What a magnificent beast!</br>  So is this show One Punch Man and Log Horizon or SAO combined?  <br>If you say so</br>  <br>more like Bastard! and sao combined. now we just need heavy metal spell names</br>  <br>ops, I meant to say bastard and berserk</br>  I hope Papa Bones gets to rule the world.  Everyone is fucking level 100<br><br>Aintz is 100<br>Albedo is 100<br>Mare is 100<br>Aura is 100<br><br>You get a level 100 too</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hope you're still here<br>Couldn't upload on 4chan, had to do it on imgur<br>http://i.imgur.com/Ylthjan.jpg<br>I'm not a photoshop wizard</br></br></br></br>  <br>It would be log horizon from the perspective of a dungeon boss</br>  <br>It's somewhat surprising how much emotion they are able to convey in a skeleton's face.<br>Is it the eyes?</br></br>  <br> http://i.imgur.com/Ylthjan.jpg </br>  <br>You get level 100!<br>And you get level 100!<br>Everyone gets level 100!!!</br></br></br>  <br>looks like shit. the color palettes are clashing</br>  I'm trying to watch the Psycho pass movie with te anon subs but....<br><br>THE FUCKING ENGRISH<br><br>SO GODAMN DISTRACTING<br><br>I tried reading the subs outloud to distract myself but it's just too fucking awful. Why did they even bother forcing the obviously monolingual japanese voice actors to speak english? Why not Japanese and pretend its another language? American movies do it all the time. It's obviooiusly inferior to having foreign characters speaking the actual language, but definitely is better than whatever the fuck this shit is. It's unlistenable it's so distractingly bad.<br><br>It's *kind of* close to the subs but is still incomprehensible, but still vaguely sounds like english. So I'll stop reading the subs for a moment because "oh its similar", but then a second later i realize again that its totally retarded shit and then miss details on what's happening.<br><br>WHY DO THEY DO THIS?!!??!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I was visibly upset when she shared his room at the base and he slept on his fucking chairs. She even made that cute pouting face.</br></br>  Just let people infer from context when another language is being spoken. The vast majority of Planetes was 'actually' in English but they didn't feel the need to make the cast Engrish it up.  <br>I was seriously expecting her to jump kogami when she woke up at night in that scene.</br>  <br> WHY DO THEY DO THIS?!!??! <br><br> go abroad <br> people don't speak the same language <br> use lingua franca <br>Sounds logical to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I tried reading the subs outloud <br>what the fuck?</br></br>  Why does no one ever talk about Haiyore Nyaruko-san? We need more Haiyore Nyaruko-san.  <br>My only problem with Mahiro is he didn't kill those fucking aliens with his fork powers. Fucking half breed abomination with a whore mother.</br>  Mahiro sucks and also it ended.  <br> worst Mc, best girls</br>  Good subs and release for F ova when?   SHOUNEN   Several hours to the invasion of earth by Stardust, no YuYuYu thread, let me correct it  <br>Soon.</br>  New chapters were released, I don't understand why anyone would waste their time with the anime.  <br>Someone better make a gomin compilation after the anime ends.</br>  <br>Because the "club" was made so bit people can have all the fun they can before they turn.</br>  <br>Compile them into one video pls.</br>  <br>Oh man, in the anime her grave is on the roof.</br>  <br>Was that when it happened?<br><br>I honestly can't remember when it happened.</br></br></br>  S2 WHEN?  <br>Do I really need to repeat it again? Manga has ended already, retard.</br>  <br>Stop it, anon. It hurts.<br><br><br>One of my favorite OPs.</br></br></br></br>    <br> still not getting it </br>  And now my day is ruined.</blockquote>]
