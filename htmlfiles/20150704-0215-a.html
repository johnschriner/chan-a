[ Can we just admit these two are the real heroes of Zero?  I can admit that Waver is the best girl  I want to fuck Waver.    Why did Waver turn into an asshole by the end of UBW?    I want to ravage Waver-kuns tight little butthole  <br>What makes him particularly an ass?</br>  Better Rider servant.  Only reason I finished the show was to watch Rider be the best bro, Kariya suffer, and Kerry dig himself deeper.  <br>Because you either be an asshole or suck Shirous dick.</br>  <br><br> tumblr <br><br><br><br>He realized that that he was in a shit series.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hell no.</br>  <br>Posting team KUUUUURRRRRRUUUU is cheating</br>   best team will never get back together   <br>He isn't really an asshole, he is a manchild with a stoic facade.</br>  <br>At least they got their happy ending. Aside from Zouken, Kirei and Gil, they were probably the only ones to get that much.</br>  <br>Just because he enjoy video games?</br>  So i've just finished watching Tokyo Ghoul because of all the hype it had when it was released (inb4 slowpoke) and I must say I was going into the series with low expectations because of what people have said (average s1 + bad s2)<br><br>But I must say I was surprised about how I felt after I had finished them, after s1 I was not completely sure about the meaning of the series but s2 seem to allude to the point of selfishness, conceitedness or just human nature in general.<br><br>If this is so, does anyone have a total analysis on Tokyo Ghoul? I can kind of put things together, but some stuff id like to understand, especially the connected between Rize and Kaneki. Was the transformation of Kaneki into a Ghoul meant to be the expression of his hatred because of how cruel people are (i.e his first 'love' Rize was a 'binge eater', to consume a lot would be attributed with gluttony which is associated with selfishness) and how Rize used him or whatever?<br><br>Thanks</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh I forgot to mention, I feel as if this is almost trying to convey the exact same message that the anime "parasyte" was doing, right? wrong? opinions?</br>  Read the manga, the anime has cut like 70% of the content and doesnt answere anything.  <br> Read the manga <br><br>I don't have enough time nowadays to read manga or even 4chan. This is the first thing ive read/watched in months. <br><br>What was the mangas point for the story?<br><br> cut like 70% of the content and doesnt answer anything <br><br>Well I could tell it had cut a shit load of content, but roughly speaking is the OP and the manga basically on the same page?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  bump  The general message of the manga is "you cant save everyone and you have to sacrifice something in order to save someone" and shit like that.<br><br>In the final chapter of part1 Kaneki says a lot of stuff like<br> i have to eat, to eat is to steal <br> i have to eat, to eat to kill <br>See pic related</br></br></br></br></br>  Chapter 57 raw: http://www.mediafire.com/download/x<wbr>qf9yalyd78npdu/<br><br>Commencing dump.</br></br></wbr>              is this a Principal centric chapter ?        What's the point of the principal as a character?<br><br>Is the principal supposed to represent the average reader?<br>Is he well liked in Japan?</br></br></br>        <br>This chapter was bad, even for TLRD' standards.<br><br>There's another chapter this week, though. Hopefully it won't be as bad.</br></br></br>    <br>No. Seems like Yami killed the principal or something and now Rito has to go around dressed like him.</br>  I waited days for a new chapter and i get the Principal ? Jesus this ain't worth it          <br>Who's the eyeglasses wearing guy ? Looks like Rito with a hair down</br>      <br>He's referred to as Nakajima. For some reason he really really likes Momo</br>  <br>OH YEAS<br><br>Btw, you got news on the WSJ Rito gets turned into a sponge and gets double-paizuri'd by Haruna and Lala chapter?</br></br></br>    <br>ahhh thanks anon,<br>  For some reason he really really likes Momo <br>Gee i wonder why</br></br></br>  <br>Oh man, she just asking for catastrophe.<br><br>Thanks, for dump, OP!</br></br></br>  <br>No, but I did get my filthy hands on volume 13 scans, which I'll start uploading after I'm done with the chapter.</br>  <br>Bretty gud</br>    <br>Those hair clips do look nice, yes</br>    <br>Did you get this from Share or something?</br>    <br>The chapter? Yes.</br>  <br>So when does Rito manage to get Mikado into his harem?</br>  <br>Even if this is Rito it still rubs me off the wrong way</br>  <br>Honestly, I really want a bit of him to be expounded upon if not only because of how much Yabuki uses him.<br><br>Maybe have him serious the fuck up at a certain point, like when his students are about to get hurt, I dunnow, because for now, he's pretty damn annoying. I just want something.<br><br><br>Shame that he didn't turn to a super handsome dude when the age reverse skunk hit him in the OVA</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>How about the tankoubon? Personal scan?</br>  <br>I'm amazed she can recognize him just by that</br>  <br>muh dick</br>    <br>More NTR hentai i guess</br>  <br>Something like that</br>      <br>Well, Rito died. I guess this is the end of the manga</br>    The WSJ picture  Extra  <br>Muh DECK</br>    <br>Well, I don't' really mind = although it is still pretty off.<br><br>It's actually sort of cute how he runs away, sorta reminds me of this.</br></br></br>    <br> NO nipples <br>Now I remember what I disliked in WSJ</br></br>  /end  <br>Goddamn Yui is just so cute catching up all those details.</br>  <br><br><br>What's the occasion for these pictures again?</br></br></br>  Volume 13 cover.  <br>She knows her man really well.

Please Yabuki.</br>  <br>Good job, breh.</br>  I like TLR, but honestly this chapter is very bad. Creepy, short and useless.<br><br><br>is not a regular chapter? has the numer 57.</br></br></br>  <br>How do you call someone or something that is used for X thing to happen?<br><br>You know: Here comes the principal let's hide unclothed in this locker!<br><br>Something like that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, 2 chapters this week. The regular in SQ, which was posted here, and a special one in the WSJ (which is still not out)</br>  <br>Not even Yami wants to kill him.</br>  <br>If you have no ass hair your farts will be loud. <br><br>The hair is there so that it's not blowing like a fog horn.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>It's a regular chapter, refer to .<br> 第57話「Principal～好調じゃない一日～」 </br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know. <br>This chapter shows us that Yui really knows Rito even if Rito doesn't look like Rito. <br><br>I can't really say this chapter was creepy as well. Rito was a dog in one chapter and really went full pussyjuice licking in that chapter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just shitty NTR fuel for doujins. This chapter was unreasonably short too (not that I'm complaining the chapter was pretty trash).<br><br>Only good thing about it was the color spreads. At least the anime will be airing soon and hopefully next months chapter will be better. Seems the chapter got backlash from Japan too from reading some blogs.</br></br></br>  The chapter was precisely the same length of the previous ones when you count the three colorspreads and the magazine cover<br>Stop being unreasonable</br>  <br>Yeah, I think a lot of people get the impression it's short because of how empty its content is</br>  <br>yes, many fans are pissed.</br>  <br>It's understandable besides the Principal shenanigans nothing was added to the already lackluster story, to make it worse the fanservice was next to nothing. Just looks like they ran out of ideas and just went with some random filler</br>  <br>I think they just follow a list of fetishes and tick off one each month.<br>May: Kiss<br>June: (not-)Necrophilia<br>July: Breast-expansion<br>August: (not-)NTR</br></br></br></br></br>  anybody knows when WSJ spoilers usually come out ? I mean One Piece spoilers or something  <br>popular stuff like one piece, bleach, naruto on thursday<br><br>Nisekoi usually on friday.</br></br></br>  <br>That's the final english version, spoilers are usually out before the japanese version is out (next monday)</br>  <br>but if you meant spoilers, then we still have no spoilers for the next one piece chap and it's friday</br>  <br>okay, then substract half a day.</br>  <br>What? Spoilers for WSJ usually come out a day or so before the unofficial release by mangapanda, RHS, etc.</br>  <br>Who would've guessed that ghost-chan had such a lewd body</br>  <br>but we do, it's been translated yesterday.<br>The scanlations you get on thursdays are the ones of the issues that get released the following monday.</br></br>  <br><br>You're right, my bad. Thanks.</br></br>  <br>Not bad for a 400 year old hag.<br><br>Why did they suddenly decide to sexualise her? They kept her away from all the trouble for so long.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck I wish we had more Risa</br>  Risa chapter when?  What about the WSJ chapter?  <br> Why did they suddenly decide to sexualise her? <br>This is from chapter 11.<br><br><br>Rito is pretty cute here. <br>The faggot from the Momo fanclub has bought some spoon for Momo and wants her to use it.

I liked the idea. Also it's better than the Traitor field, that's one of the worst of my old version, I don't even understand why you kept it. So I merged Fine Returns with Elfnine and made the free space Vocaloid.</br></br></br>  <br> I merged Fine Returns with Elfnine <br>Making it unnecessarily difficult.<br><br>Vocaloid is dumb.<br>They're dolls not robots.<br>We don't even know if they're singing.<br>We know they already have seiyuu.<br>Making the audience listen to shitty vocaloid speaking voices all the time would be a terrible decision.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also the traitor field is fine.<br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if one of them defects. It won't be the dolls, and it won't be what's-her-face.<br>Elfnine being a traitor is a good, plausible, and simple one.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Tama's voice through a shitty robot filter <br>Just kill my ears.</br></br>  <br>Elfnein isn't a doll.</br>  <br>Oh shit, I thought she was the playing the red one for some reason.</br>  <br>Not difficult, it just says Elfnine is Fine. She's the most likely candidate.<br><br><br>Point taken, guess I just wanted it worded differently now, like "Elfnine Defects" would be more clear.<br><br>She's really the mysterious one, whose role and actions can't really be predicted yet.<br><br>Anyway, I'll leave the bingo alone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She's the most likely candidate. <br>True enough.<br><br>I'm pretty worried about whether her seiyuu can pull off a serious character.<br>Her design really doesn't suit such a squeaky cute voice. Maybe she has more range than I'm aware of.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She voiced Cerebrum in Geneitaiyo, she'll be fine.</br></br>    Nana a lewd.  <br> believe in justice and hold a determination to fist </br>  Official relationship charts of S1 and G.

Doesn't have to be /u/- intensive, just something to play off the relationship they built over season 2. Something like a head pat from Tsubasa or a hug from Chris would be enough.  TODAY IS THE DAY    <br> dat neko </br>    <br>Miku is cute. I hope we get a lot of Miku this season.</br>  <br>I want Miku and Hibiki to kiss already.</br>  <br>I don't even think Genjuuro could take that combo attack.</br>  <br>SOON</br>  <br>My thoughts exactly.<br><br>Though I'm not sure if I want Miku to have a geah.

Maybe my sleep patterns have become too extreme.</br>  <br>Pretty sure it's in JST time too.</br>  <br> Thank you anon </br>  <br><br>Are you  going to cast GX as well? </br></br>  <br> Seems neet will stream it after all  </br>  <br>Not sure, I'll definitely be awake during the live stream if there even is one but I'll be asleep until subs are out most likely.</br>  <br> That is good too. Thanks again. </br>  6 HOURS  <br>post the ver one</br>  <br>Dunno.<br><br>The Symphogear threads on /m/ always goes off-topic and then we would always somehow link it back to Symphogear.</br></br></br>  <br>How long will it take for subs?</br>  <br>Approximately 2 forevers.</br>  <br> Have an urge to get down on my knees after hearing her <br>Dammit.</br></br>  <br>When the /m/ thread stays on-topic.<br> Never </br></br>  <br><br>What's with all that negativity?</br></br>  <br>G Starting right now, Get in here friends!</br>  /arc-v/ here<br>If you want timely weekly subs the best you can do is make trollsubs that would offend tumblr, forcing them to get off their asses and sub the show themselves</br>  <br>Laggy as fuck for me.</br>  <br>I have hope in zoid.</br>  <br>No problems here.</br>  <br>I dunno, it took our subber like 10 episodes to get his shit together. And Symphogear is a harder show to sub with all those songs and shit.</br>  I did not recall that Dark Oblivion played in episode 1.<br><br>It seems fantastic in comparison to Finenglish, though.</br></br>  <br>Does tumblr even care about this?</br>  <br>It did take him like 3 years to finish up the final manga volume, but I hope with a team the animu won't be too hard on him.</br>   Going to miss the stream because of training at work. <br><br>I'll have fun avoiding /a/ for the entire weekend.</br></br>  <br>Tumblr has at least a small fanbase for pretty much everything. Even the shows they hate.</br>  <br>I don't mind having no subs for the songs.</br>  <br>Posting from Australia, on the best internet available in the country and I get a few seconds continuous at best. GX 1 airs at 4am local anyway so have anyway. See you in the threads.</br>  <br>Don't worry anon I'll be hype enough for us both.</br>  <br>Spoilers have already been out. You aren't going to miss much.</br>  <br>*GX 1 airs at 4am local time anyway so have fun regardless.<br>Jesus.</br></br>  <br>It's kind of needed for Symphogear. I suppose they could come back and sub them later for a faster release.</br>  <br> Not that anon but Yucie's site seems to be 404'd. I found another one but it doesn't seem like it's for anime. </br>  <br><br><br> Tumblr isn't a hivemind and is just a network of blogs you can even choose who views shit and who doesn't. "Offending" someone there doesn't even matter when there are actually loads of offensive blogs out there anyway.  </br></br></br>  <br>Weird. I have orientation for a new job around the same time. Never the less, I am hype and have already seen the spoilers so will most certainly not stay away.</br>  <br>I never read the spoilers. I was at work when they were first posted probably.<br><br><br>It's more uptraining for me.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;implying the "offensive" tumblr blogs aren't remnants of 4chan raids </br>  <br> They're honestly not <br><br> It's just a blogsite with clique like communities, deal with it </br></br></br>  <br/>  <br><br> Nevermind I tracked him down but it doesn't seem to be on the broadcast list. Do you happen do know the Douyu # I can't navigate this site for shit </br></br>  So how long will subs take?  <br>Sometime between next week and the heat death of the universe.</br>  Who else is live watching? are we having a live watch thread? I CAN NOT WAIT. SYMPHOGEAHHHHH  <br> Hibiki Radio <br><br>Heh</br></br></br>  <br>Where the fuck do you faggots come from?</br>  <br>/v/ crossboarders here for GATE and God Eater.</br>    <br>I felt that the nyaa-tan one fit better<br><br>Not being a side character and all</br></br></br>  <br> 5275 </br>  <br>Are you fucking joking me? I've been here from the start of Symphogear Season 1. Is there a crime being committed for being excited about GX? You sir are the faggot if you can't feel the excitement. I've never even visited another board except /a/ I only visit when Symphogear is airing.</br>  <br>During summers my hours start earlier. It sucks ass</br>  <br> It seems I was already in the right place but thank you for the confirmation anon.  </br>  <br>Go back to reddit.</br>  <br> I've never even visited another board except /a/ I only visit when Symphogear is airing. <br>What?</br></br>  <br>Try that sentence one more time, slowly now.</br>  <br> I've never even visited another board except /a/ I only visit when Symphogear is airing. <br>Shit, what do you do with the rest of your life?</br></br>  <br>People like you are destroying the community from S1. You are nothing like the people back then. Jesus, what happened? <br>I only visit /a/ when symphogear airs, I literally have a symphogear shrine.</br></br>  Will we see the LAST ACTION HERO again?  <br>Thats a short list for reality.<br><br> Dragonball <br> gangsta <br> gatchaman <br> gate <br> godeater <br> prison school <br> monster musume <br> overlord <br> to love ru <br> working <br> leftover from yuki-chan <br><br>They have a lot of reasons to flood /a/ this season. Thank goodness not many of them will enter our threads.<br><br>Best to just report and ignore all retarded and instigating posts. Just remember, you reply, you lose.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> pics pls </br>  <br>This doujin is ridiculously hot.</br>  <br>Hopefully we get Genjuuro fighting sequence throughout this time. You're more like the people from back then, and for that, you're the best.<br><br>Sorry the image is so big I'm in another country at the moment, so I have to get it from google drive instead</br></br></br>  So is neet going to be streaming GX for sure?   <br> <br> <br> I didn't get the attention I wanted before when I was trying to shitpost and bait so now I'll keep posting more and more inflammatory shit that's degrading to the characters until I get the response I want <br><br>You seriously shit up every single thread you're in and you know exactly what you're doing, and you know that you're baiting, and you know that it doesn't matter how bad your posting is because the mod is a bigot and let's you get away with it.<br><br>You degrade the characters and treat them like shit, and you see them as nothing more than a means of cheap yuri and shitposting tools.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>read the thread</br>  <br> I only visit /a/ when symphogear airs, <br>And you're proud of this?<br>Please just stop your blogging, it's embarrassing and derailing the thread</br></br></br>  <br>Oh boy here we go.jpeg</br>  <br> being this much of a faggot </br>  <br>In hindsight I'm an idiot for not doing that before. My bad.</br>  <br>You're getting a Chris figure in there soon, right?</br>  <br> I only visit /a/ when symphogear airs <br><br>Fuck off back to reddit then, offsiter</br></br></br>  <br> being this much a shithead who degrades the characters and promotes low quality posting <br><br>Don't even pretend like you even read that post. You just saw a couple words and went "lol dum I dun care".<br><br>You are literally the definition of ignorant.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not at all, you, making a big deal out of me being excited is what's derailing the thread. God damn it, why can't we just speak about how excited we are for Season 3 eh?</br>  I am sorry for your threads<br><br>Symphogear deserves better than what /a/ is offering</br></br>  <br>You're posting like a faggot because you didn't lurk nearly enough. Shut the fuck up.</br>  <br>Wow how do you find the time to shitpost EVERY thread with yuri pairings?</br>  <br>Because you're a faggot who hasn't lurked at all and are just expecting people tolerate you for being a faggot</br>  <br>You're right anon, I didn't read that<br><br>I didn't need to, I saw a few words in it and knew exactly who it was</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why the fuck don't you just stop replying.</br></br>  <br>/u/ is pure shit and /m/ is dead.<br>And no deserves threads where shitposters who spam crack to be contradictory get protected by mods who are also crack shit spamming shitposters.<br><br><br>Sorry. Just because you call it shitposting doesn't mean it actually is. You're the one samefagging, spamming crack, and baiting. All against the rules. As well as low quality posting because you treat the characters like shit.<br><br>The only way you can claim I'm shitposting is by proving you're not degrading the characters. As of now you're just bitching about someone accuretly calling you out on being a shit head.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that there is NO way of getting anti-crack faggot to stop besides COMPLETELY ignoring him. Every reply you giving contributes in making the thread much shittier and possibly making the thread unusable.  <br>Anon please today is a good day for all stop this madness.</br>  <br>You're pathetic.</br>  <br>I'm not an offsiter what the fuck, /a/ was my home, commie used to be my home. I dont even visit reddit either. This is the only place i speak with a community.<br><br>I have one, thats picture is 20 months old at least. Well nevermind, found it while RDPing into my home pc.</br></br></br>  <br>What if I want the thread to die. This thread is full of garbage and getting close to bump limit anyway.</br>  <br> I only visit when Symphogear is airing <br>It shows.</br></br>  <br>I've lurked long enough back in S1 and S2 times, you're telling me one year makes such a big difference? And that I can't act the same as i did back then? Nice.</br>  <br>Please go back to the madoka thread. You and I both know he was trying to stir you up. Stop responding.</br>   responding   <br>It would make me sad that somebody who cares for the thread actually wants to see it die so early on the day of the GX premiere, but if that's what you want, replying to him as much as you can would indeed be the best course of action.</br>  <br>No, you actually don't know who it is. And here's the thing you fucking mongoloid.<br>IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO MADE THE POST.<br>Why is this so hard for fucking retards to understand.<br>If the INFORMATION in the post is correct that's all that matters.<br><br><br><br>Reminder that you a shitposter and the only reason you feel that you are correct is because you have My Little Pony mods sucking your dick.<br>What makes threads shit is people treating the characters like shit.<br><br><br><br> lol i downvoted you &gt;.&lt; <br>Can't you think of anything smarter to say? You do get that baseless comments like yours amount to nothing at all, right?<br>And really, stop samefagging.<br><br>If you can't prove you're not treating the characters like shit then you're wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> commie used to be my home <br>I can't take you seriously anymore. You're clearly just baiting. Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>see</br>  <br>Anon there are ways to do light blogshit and show your merch without causing this kind of response. Save the all caps posting for a live watch thread. <br><br><br>Much better this thread dies and someone makes a standard live watch one an hour before or so.</br></br></br></br>  Would you faggots stop replying to this god damn retard already<br><br>Literally 4 hours left till it airs and you faggots are falling for the biggest bait</br></br>  <br>Yea i know. I was trying to plead with his humanity.</br>  <br> If you can't prove you're not treating the characters like shit then you're wrong. <br>Don't worry man I asked Bikki and said she didn't mind since they are just drawings of her, she knows that whenever we're actually together I respect her love.</br></br>  <br><br><br>This is such a pathetic display. You literally think that if you ignore it that you someone how prove you're right. It's so childish it's not even funny. <br><br>You are the one who is the problem because you condone shitposters.<br><br><br>I'm in just about every single thread ever, there is no "going back".<br><br>And I love the "shitposters get a free pass on shitposting because they're shitposters" line.<br><br>Why does the crack spammer get to have free run of the thread and why do the people advocating for quality posts get banned?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Explain how asking you to have fun on the new seasons premier with the rest of us downboating.</br>  Those who read the spoiler, how do you think the first ep will be? More plot or action?  <br>Too many have tried before you and failed. It's a lost cause.</br>  <br>Please anon, inform me about how treating fictional characters in 'degrading' manners is bad?</br>  <br><br>Shut up retards.</br></br>  <br>Now now. Where did i say that shit posters get a free pass? I simply said to just ignore and report like a normal /a/ poster would do. Thats all you gotta do. There is no reason to flip your shit unless you are trying to ruin the thread with your crap. Just knock it off. Its obviously just causing them to post it more when you react the way you do.</br>     <br>No I'm actually serious, I was in training at commie, iuntil some gigantic faggot banned me. they do a good job on symphogear. Apart from the whole 298 yen debacle. Now that was hilarious.</br>  <br><br> if keep spamming not to reply that makes him wrong <br>You know what's funny. You never spam "don't reply!!!!!" to the actual shitposter who spamming and baiting. You're such a fucking hypocrite.<br><br><br>Sarcastic answers don't prove you right either.<br>And them being drawing doesn't mean you're not making negative statements. Common sense tells you think.<br><br><br>You are still approving of the actual shitposter spamming crack. Why are you not telling him to leave if you care so much about thread quality?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Are the threads gonna be like this until we get subs? Where are the memes?  <br>The thread is near bump limit anyway, make a new one for the livewatch<br><br>Watching him put the effort into typing long shit out is fun anyway</br></br></br>  <br>Action, action, Hibiki navel, action.<br><br><br>Umakoshi's poses are worth referencing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it'll be more plot. Little action at the start. Concert. Shit hits the fan but not much action just yet. I doubt they'll conclude the fight scene in the 1st episode.<br><br> I'd be surprised if they did and   Tsubasa loses before Hibiki gets attacked so we feel that Hibiki's in danger too. </br></br></br>  <br> why are you not telling him to leave <br><br>Because i know that he wont. Hes just posting that to piss you off and you take the bait every fucking time. Just quit already buddy. We both know they wont go away. You are the only deciding factor on it. If you dont respond to it for a few threads, they will fuck off. Its that simple.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think anti-crack anon is a bad guy at heart, he's just ridiculously stubborn and has no idea how to empathise with someone else's view.</br>  <br>No memes yet Chris wait till after the episode airs.</br>  <br> Sarcastic answers don't prove you right either <br>I wasn't being sarcastic, Bikki is actually very accepting.</br></br>  <br>Welp hopefully the concert will deliver.</br>  <br>hopefully only as comic relief</br>  <br>Because you didn't ask to have fun or whatever nonsense you're making up.<br>And you are making baseless comments of disapproval. Or in other words, a downvote.<br><br><br>How is it not obvious by the very words you used?<br>If you degrade something you are taking negative action. Being in the negative is incorrect.<br>In this case it means you are shallow ans self serving, as well as you forsaking the quality of posts just so you can further amuse yourself with shipping and degrading the characters. You are not making posts to further the quality of the thread, you are only making posts for your own shallow shipping. Shallow means something lacks information. And the definition of a quality post is something that has a lot of information. (As per global rule 6 and common sense.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's been at it for over a year with hilariously bad "logic". He's obviously shitposting intentionally.</br>  Fuck it, im just gonna post Miku till everyone shuts up  <br>Indeed, I love going through and seeing all the references.</br>  <br>I'll help you out with that.</br>    <br> I simply said to just ignore and report like a normal /a/ poster would do <br>Wow you're new. Do you seriously have no idea what self moderation is, and that it is the only known force that can keep a board good? You must not only have never been to /q/ you didn't even listen to moot's final speech.<br><br>Also, it's funny. If you report crack spammers you get banned for abusing the report system.<br><br><br> Hibiki is a shallow and has no standards <br>Way to insult her even more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Looks like she is still a loli after all. <br><br>I guess Gate is saved.</br></br>  <br><br>Left or right?</br></br>  <br>Rori is saved. Thank God for that, I was honestly worried since we didn't have a reference point until now.</br>  <br><br>How does she look like a loli?</br></br>  <br> pink panties <br>slut</br></br>  <br>I don't mind the new design. I'm glad her appearance is at least as she should be, that is, 13 years old. <br><br>Also, Rori is best Gate.</br></br></br>  <br><br>She's much smaller than the elf.</br></br>  <br>Are you blind? She looks like a little girl.</br>  <br>I she now? I'm not really seeing it, but whatever.<br>This is just a magazine illustration, and what we had so far was her official anime character design.<br>I will stop worrying when she will appear small in the naime.</br></br></br>  <br>No, she does not.<br><br> 13 <br>You mean 18.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> LolisRDead doing "that" again <br>Fuck off. I can see your ass form miles away.</br></br></br></br>   elf wearing jeans and a t-shirt <br><br>There's something about that that does things to my dick.</br></br>  <br>from*</br>  <br>If one thing needed saving in this anime adaptation, it definitely has to be that the anime got her loli-ness correct. I am pleased.</br>  Why is she wearing modern panties?  <br>Goth loli sluts are the best, bro.</br>  <br> slutty pink <br> not pure black with lace <br>Fucking bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>Fat ass, large breasts. pointy ears. Looks like a loli to me.</br>  <br>Better than the ugly manga design.</br>  <br>Fuck. I liked it better when I thought she was tall and lanky.</br>  <br>Pink is too childish for her. Damn that illustrator.</br>  <br><br>They went full retard. Where is her sexy underwear?</br></br>  <br>Clearly that dude didn't read or care about it at all.<br>He looked at the anime design and drew something for his money.</br></br>  <br>At least it isn't the ugly manga art style.</br>  <br>That elf seems in need of something.</br>  https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/ne<wbr>ws/2015-07-02/crunchyroll-to-stream<wbr>-gate-anime/.90003<br><br> The stream will premiere on July 3 at 1:00 p.m. EDT. </br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br>That elf single-handedly nearly destroyed this series for me. She should get dicked to death.</br>  <br>Cheers to that.</br>  <br><br> elf girl in jeans <br><br>Is this Heaven?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Looks like she is still a loli after all. <br>Athough assuming this trailer is her intended voice, they are going for near Ara ara old lady rather than loli squeaks.<br>https://<span>youtu.be/Oju_4ogaXv4  [ ]<br> I like it, she is suppose to be old by demigod standards, 861 years for her is the equivalent of being an 80+ year old woman. She was basically settling down with Itami as her companion for the rest of her natural life as a mortal.</br></br></br></br>  <br>961 years old I mean.</br>  <br><br>Balls deep in dat butt.</br></br>  <br>she voice like a middle age slut<br>not a 961 years old demigod loli</br></br>  <br> she voice like a middle age slut <br>That is what I meant. Ara ara old lady.</br></br>  A better thing to worry about is Why does Lelei look like a sailor scout?<br>Why does she have blue hair too?</br>  <br>Who cares about a loli when you have that elf on the right?</br>  <br> priestess of the god of death <br> pink child panties </br></br>  <br>There had to be at least one girl with an unnatural hair color, Rory was a no-go and the elf already has elf moe going on, so Lelei really was the only candidate.</br>  <br><br>Because she always had. Her family is from a different world and they all have powerful magic.</br></br>  <br>We'll see if she fits in our charts.</br>  <br>MAGIC</br>  <br>don't worry she gets a mid season upgrade to goth loli panties ~</br>  <br> LRDTHK  <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>This triggers me.</br>  <br>It shouldn't really.<br>Anyway a loli has really just three common characteristics.<br><br> Must be born to a race that has similar height averages to humans <br> Must be below 148 cm but higher than 100 cm <br> Must have A to AA cups. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  So which subgroup is doing Gate?  <br>In the end  she didn't even kill the dragon <br><br> What a fuckup. </br></br></br>  She looked better in the key art, I hope it's just a fuck up.  <br>Not entirely true:  She used a spell that zapped the dragon and the electric current blew the explosives, killing the dragon as opriginally intended. </br>  <br> Pfz 3 <br>Aw yeah</br></br>  <br> I thought Itami hit the explosives at the last second? </br>  <br> Lelei stabbed the dragon with all the swords in the area using the screw principle<br>Tuka cast a large electric spell that used the swords as conductors<br>Itami's explosives caught fire because of the lightning</br></br> </br>  <br>She looks like a loli to me. At least, she looks pretty close to 13 to me.</br>  <br>nice sao artstyle</br>  <br>Compare to her first appearance <br>she looks completely different</br></br>   elf  <br> blonde <br> low waist jeans  <br>AOTY</br></br></br>  <br>I really dont care at all but 13 isn't loli. loli=prepubescent body.</br>  <br>is this the reason they changed her skirt.<br>for panty shots?</br></br>  Next week baby  <br> Pubescent lolis don't exist </br>  <br>Source?</br>     24 episodes <br> 30 minutes each <br><br>Aw yeaaaaah</br></br></br>  <br>30 minutes means the regular length, you know.</br>  <br><br> 2 cour <br><br>My dick.</br></br></br></br>  <br>so where the fuck are they planning on ending it then? When they kill the dragon?</br>  <br>Probably to the end of the japan visit.</br>  <br> Next week baby <br>What? The anime is airing in a little under 13 hours...<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;24  episodes<br>YES! This means we get the Dark Elves and the Dragon hunt!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>24 episodes? No way. Past that.</br>  <br> Probably to the end of the japan visit. <br>The Japan visit was painful. The weakest part of the story. I rather they fast forward it a bit and don't spend more than two episodes.</br></br>  <br> What? The anime is airing in a little under 13 hours... <br>I thought it wasn't till the 7th. So it's tomorrow huh.</br></br>  <br>Monmusu is on the 7th</br>  <br>I would guess so.<br>There's 5 books (adapted into 10 Light Novels), and Book 2 is the dragon fight.<br>So covering up to two books should be fine.</br></br></br>  <br> 18  <br>you mean 800</br></br>  <br> leaving your mouse on the screen and not hiding it in the corner somewhere <br>Literally the worst fucking people to breathe air that could be getting breathed by someone else.</br></br>  <br> 800 <br><br>She's like 980 or some shit.</br></br></br>  <br> I thought it wasn't till the 7th. So it's tomorrow huh. <br>Only on one channel. Western streaming won't be until the latest airing in Japan.</br></br>  <br>It's probably 3 episodes per arc and ending with the dragon. We'll probably see Yao.</br>  <br>Who the fuck cares about western streaming? Jesus Christ.</br>  <br>Is neetball streaming Gate? I just checked and it doesn't seem like it.</br>  <br>I'll rephrase:<br>Who the fuck cares about streaming?</br></br>  <br>i do my computer is broken so until its repaired i'm going to need to stream</br>  <br>That's too bad, but here's the idea: just wait until it gets fixed and watch it in proper quality and manner.</br>  <br>but then i won't be able to shitpost in the threads</br>    <br> Not black lingerie <br><br>They have just one fucking job and they blew it.<br><br>Frankly this upsets me a litte.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> _master1200 <br>no</br></br>  <br>You will be.<br> Japanese army propaganda! 2 nukes weren't enough... <br> ELF RAPE RAPE ELF  <br> Rory is no loli, hurr anti lolicon propaganda! <br> generic harem shit <br>Or anything else you can think of. Shitposting never needed much insight, especially true these days.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dont' get it. <br><br><br>This man get's it.</br></br></br></br>  Fuck the elf<br>Fuck Rori<br>Fuck Big tits <br><br>Lelei for life.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want LRD to leave and die.</br>  <br> people that dont feel like waiting for a torrent to finish <br> people that will only end up watching it once and then deleting it later <br> when a series has shit seeding and it is readily available through streaming </br></br></br>  <br> turning a death god into a moe character <br>why</br></br>  <br> I dont' get it. <br>If you have a page on Pixiv with multiple images, they'll max out at 1200p in dimension. Press V to open the actual full-size image in a new tab.<br><br>(I only learned this myself a few weeks ago, still too lazy to convert the ones I have.)</br></br></br></br>  <br>But I want my piña colada</br>  <br>On, neat. Danke.</br>  Hopefully they give the Battle of Alnus some budget this episode<br><br> CG tanks firing at CG knights </br></br>  <br> wants pussy princess that will probably lead her kingdom to servitude </br>  <br>they BETTER give that whole fight most of the budget. Especially the helicopter scene.</br>  <br> CG <br>It's 100% inevitable. But anime CG can be non-horrible with proper care. <br><br>However, there's so many ways the studio can fuck up the anime. I'm only hopeful because of the "holy hell, she's in this too?"-tier seiyuu cast.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But I'm not into lolis and elves are for RAPE only</br>  Aw shit, Crunchyroll is getting Gate  <br>  The show kicks off on July 3 at 10:00am Pacific Time, with new episodes set to broadcast every Friday. <br><br>Finally there's something to fill the JoJo void</br></br></br>  <br>I think Rory doesn't have such a strict loli appeal that a non-lolicon can't enjoy her.<br><br/></br></br>  <br> So bad, yet so good~ <br>Censored, then?<br><br> The Battle of Alnus in a White Blizzard </br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure it will be censored, but that will make getting the blu-rays worth it.</br>  <br>Still, I'm not against DFC, it's just not my thing.</br>  <br>She has small breasts, but that's not flat by any means.</br>  <br>She has the perfect size</br>      Checking reddit anime<br> top post nippon stronk <br>It's bad</br></br>  <br>best girl</br>  <br>I don't see how that's any different from here</br>  <br>I want to fuck the elf.</br>  i wonder if they will tone down all the rape  <br><br>A lot of the background rape will probably be ignored.</br></br>  <br>I'm more wondering how much of the siege they are going to show. Some scenes during that get pretty gruesome.</br>  <br>You can speak freely here</br>  <br>eh I suppose that's true. Fair point.</br>  <br>much better tbh</br>  <br> androgynous kuudere <br>to<br> generic blob with oddly colored hair #21,491 <br>This is not okay.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I think Rory doesn't have such a strict loli appeal that a non-lolicon can't enjoy her. <br>Now that I heard her voice, I am going to appreciate the gap moe of having an adult woman's voice coming out of the body of a young girl. Is there a fetish name for that?</br></br>  <br> Pink panties <br>And dropped.</br></br>   10h30m until it airs   Not enough appreciation of Tuka's ass up this is bitch. <br><br>Y'all faggots r GAY!</br></br>    <br>Her hair is blue, just a different shade in the anime.<br><br>All characters look much better done, or at least more modern, than in the manga. The manga art is shit, and lazily done. <br><br>Shading is bad, mouth and nose looks like snouth, and just not doing it for me. I coulg go on but again.<br><br>The girls in the manga aren't cute or anything at all. The anime at least looks good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree with this.<br><br>In fact, the hair color change makes me wonder if they weren't trying to make her look like Tabitha.</br></br></br>  <br>Old<br><br>Hag</br></br></br>  <br>Oh.<br><br>still, that specific shade of blue should have been avoided. It's too jarring.</br></br></br>  that doesn't look loli at all<br> fuckin blind faggots</br>  <br>How much rape does this have?</br>  <br><br><br><br>Nah they're gonna do the entire season 1. <br><br>Episode 1-13 = From start to slaying of the dragon<br>Episode 14-19 = Prince Zorzal's rebellion<br>Episode 19-26 = Defeats of Zorzal and closing of the Gate</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Enough to fill an Indian bus.</br>  <br>Any proof it's two cours?</br>  <br>Read the thread</br>  <br>Left, I really like rori</br>  <br>I think at one point group of bandits raped a girl, killed her, and threw her naked, decapitated used body towards her husband<br><br>I doubt that's gonna fly in the anime though</br></br></br>  <br> I doubt that's gonna fly in the anime though <br>The body actually flew in the manga?</br></br>  <br><br>CIA in full force. Fuck yeah.</br></br>  <br>That's pretty hardcore</br>  <br> filename </br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if they did that. It is certainly possible, especially since they want to promote the upcoming novel sequel and they NEED to finish the main story in the anime for that. Guess it wouldn't be that impossible with 2 cour.</br>  <br>Search by MD5, retard.</br>  <br>Honestly there's a lot of padding in the novel, and in an animated medium it would feel too dragged out if they stick to it. Only reason manga is tolerable at the pace is because it's still a printed medium. <br><br>I'm sure a lot of people will bitch, but I'm cool with that direction. <br>I'm a novelfag, but not a source fundamentalist.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm sure a lot of people will bitch, but I'm cool with that direction. <br> I'm a novelfag, but not a source fundamentalist. <br>Seriously, 2 cour was far more than I was expecting and as such I can't really complain.</br></br></br>  Yeah, if they can condense 5 volumes of Log Horizon in 2 cours, I can see 5 volumes of GATE in 2 cours.  <br>Unlike others here I'm not really surprised with the 2 cours. <br>GATE is Alphapolis's biggest title, this is their "make or break" moment. It's natural they'll put as much effort as they can on their big break.</br></br>   24 episodes <br><br>It's been a while since I read gate<br><br>What are the chances we'll see itami  punch the prince? </br></br></br></br>  <br>i thought shortstack chick did that?</br>  Gundam Seed Destiny of our generation.  <br>Itami punched him first, then when Prince retaliated he pulled the gun out.</br>  <br>I just hope they don't rush anything.</br>  This is a relatively peaceful thread so far.  <br>Can't believe I am looking forward to this.</br>  Can anyone improve on this image? I can put the text in a pastebin  <br>The only way you can improve on it is by deleting it from the internet. Sadly it has already been posted so you fucked it up permanently.</br>  I don't feel very excited for this. What are some A1 adaptations that are actually really good?  <br>Someone's sensitive</br>  <br>Stop projecting. That image will only fuel shitposting and you should know that.</br>  <br>Someone's affected</br>  <br>Yeah, make the damn text readable against the background.</br>  someone mentioned being unable to find gates original webnovel version in one of the previous threads.<br>i managed to find it on my computer today.<br><br>www.mediafire.com/download/zriujpo8<wbr>mqtfn2n/gate.zip</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot the biggest thing; "Gate is a work of fiction, so any and all arguments regarding the current state of the real nation of Japan (it's armed forces, relationships with other countries etc) have no relevance to the fictional universe in which Gate takes place."<br>And that comparatively to the majority of American films it hardly qualifies as a 'power fantasy'.<br><br>Also yeah, green text is completely unreadable, and links on images is stupid unless you use a link shortener.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> But they are unbeatable! <br><br>Daily reminder that flips has one of the best special forces that could outperform special forces from developed countries even with shit equipment</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, I'm in Japanese locale.</br>  <br>I have the same problem, but notepad seems to work.</br>  <br>Well, that solves it for me as well, thanks.</br>  <br>there are multiple japanese locales.<br>thats what i get when i set webbrowser to western locale.<br><br>$ file Gate.html<br>Gate.html: HTML document, UTF-8 Unicode text, with very long lines, with CRLF line terminators</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except they're like... double the size?</br>  <br>Wouldn't that be too fast?</br>  <br>Step up, senpai.</br>  <br>Haha.<br><br>But no really, that would be like burning through 5 Harry Potter books in 24 episodes  like this guy's saying. This isn't your typical LN adaption.</br></br></br>  <br>But that's nearly two hours of screen time per book which is more than what they actually got and I seriously doubt the GATE novel is that long.</br>  <br>Also, it's a fucking web novel so I'm sure there's some form of dumb bullshit they could cut and nobody would give a fuck.</br>  <br>certainly bigger, but not double</br>  <br>Remember that in this, Japan:<br><br> offered a full cessation of hostilities and a return of valuable PoWs without the usual slave taking and crap, making the Empire think they will be merciful <br> in their very next sentence demanded reparations worth more than all the gold in the Empire, a sum that the Empire could never possibly pay back. <br><br> demanded and gained access to tracts of land that are rich in diamonds, signing an agreement to share the diamonds with the locals, as well as gold and silver. <br> didn't tell the local government about all the other valuable minerals that they could find there besides gold and silver, which could be worth billions back on Earth, so they could scam then out of it all without paying the locals a penny <br><br> after the negotiations and official cessation of hostilities, stumbled on some captured Japanese citizens in captivity, who they somehow they didn't already know were still unaccounted for and they never bothered to ask the Empire before then. <br> responded by bombing the Imperial Senate with JASDF fighters as a show of force with no warning, rather than going through diplomatic channels <br><br> when a prince hostile to the Japanese launched a coup, gave support to a princess who they had more leverage over and would be less of an enemy to Japan <br> even though the JSDF cannot be legally used overseas in the role of collective self defense of an ally, and the public is protesting against Abe's attempts to reinterpret the Japanese Constitution to make it legal to fight alongside the USA overseas <br><br>REMEMBER <br><br>JAPANESE PUBLIC OPINION IRL IS HEAVILY AGAINST LIBERALLY REINTERPRETING THE SDF CHARTER WHICH THEIR PM HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   people thinking A-1 won't fuck up   <br>Is 2 hours per arc enough? I think that 2:30 hours is the ideal length of a movie for me.</br>  <br>Fuck up is relative. <br>I for one don't think A-1 fucked up SAO. That was shit from the source.</br></br>  <br>I know a lot of mangafags complained about Nanatsu no Taizai. It was also a complete QUALITY fest in the second half, as expected of A-1.</br>  <br>Seven sins was fine. <br>sourcefags will complain no matter what.</br></br>  This is going to be a war strategies/political anime? B-boring.  <br>Let them complain. It's nothing compared to the turd anime One Piece had become.</br>  <br>Neither was Log Horizon.</br>  <br>LH was a light novel. I meant the format in that post. <br>but basing on the anime it seems like they will adapt the light novel?</br></br>  <br> But no really, that would be like burning through 5 Harry Potter books in 24 episodes <br><br>Stop and think about what you're saying here. <br><br>They adapted first 5 Harry Potter novels in to 5 movies, 157 minutes each. That's 785 minutes including the long credits. <br><br>24 episodes of anime is 600 minutes, including OP/ED.<br><br>It's not as outrageous a difference as you seem to think.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See <br><br>You see those 9 colorful books on the top shelf? That's Log Horizon. <br>Log Horizon is most definitely NOT small books. <br><br>Now see the shelf below it. <br>The tiny little books on the left side are the GATE light novels, two of those equal one of the GATE books the large books you see to the right of the manga adaptation on the same shelf)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oops, off by one.. I meant see </br>    <br>What you haven't ever made simple mistakes, Sigmund?</br>  <br> Oops, off by one <br>Yeah, I see that.</br></br>  <br>I'm guessing it's because they streamlined and cut content from the novel version. It doesn't really tell me anything. As for LH are they really that big? It seemed like Haruhi and Spice was longer than those.</br>  <br>My point is that you did not make a mistake.</br>  <br>The adaptation itself being really good? Hasn't really happened.<br>Stuff like Silver Spoon was serviceable, but simply because of the source's story,.<br>So while it won't be visually amazing, with at least the blessing of 2 cour, it'll be passable and cover new material. All we could really ask for.</br></br></br>  <br>Which episodes will be QUALITY?</br>  <br>I'll help out by marking them</br>  <br><br>But SIlver Spoon was really nicely animated throughout. A-1 vary massively. <br>My guess is that they put a lot of money into this so it should look pretty good like SAO, Shigatsu etc.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks but I know what's what. <br>I just didn't know those blue books were counted too.<br><br>I'm not confident enough in 5 novels for 24 eps.<br>There was a lot of material skipped for LH as well and it didn't seem long to me when I read it.<br><br>And judging by the art of the anime I think it's the light novels that will get adapted.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm reading the mushoku manga, but it's hella slow. How the fuck does he manages to marry the 3 girls, the fuck? (childhood friend, royalty brat, and sensei)</br>  <br>Through years of hardships and impotence.</br>  <br>Got separated from the childhood friend by his dad to prevent crippling dependence by childhood friend<br><br>Traveled the world with ojousama and gave each other their virginities then ojousama left to go train in a cave for years (he thought she was dumping him because she's really bad at explanations and just disappeared one morning)<br><br>Decided to pursue higher education, reunited with childhood friend at college and got married. <br><br>Went on a quest to rescue his mom (leaving his pregnant wife behind) but some people died and he ended up depressed, sensei who he rescued "comforted" him and they ended up calling a shotgun wedding<br><br>Much later ojousama finally returns after having achieved maximum powerlevel just in time to rescue him from being killed by the Act 2 final boss, she marries him and basically rapes him on their wedding night</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there a timeskip, or is this loli sex?</br>  <br>What the fuck, I haven't read so far but what. How the fuck are the other 2 okay of him having 3 wives.</br>  <br>Obviously a time skip retard.</br>  <br>juve period &gt;youth period&gt; young man period. Like 3 timeskips.</br>  <br>Osananajimi has her own self esteem issues (even though she's like a crack secret service agent and shit)<br><br>Sensei is just happy to share<br><br>Ojousama is confident in the security of their relationship even if he is married three times, (she also tries to get him to fuck the catgirl maid but he just throws the maid out of the room)<br><br>It's not like he just marries everyone he meets, he doesn't fuck his half imouto maid or the catgirl maid for example</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's kinda sad knowing Rudeus should be more mature than Itami since he's lived a longer life, but isn't.  <br>It could be that he settled down to his new world age and stopped thinking like an old man.</br>  <br> mfw eris gives rudeus erectile disfunction </br>  <br><br>Or you know <br><br>Life experiences of a 30-something otaku who's been married, went through boot camps, commands a squad of trained soldiers, and a trained ranger <br><br>As opposed to<br><br>Life experiences of a 30-something otaku who's never held a job in his life, parasytes off his parents, and never dated a girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>elf ass</br>  <br>The point was that pre incarnation Rudeus was a complete manchild who never really grew up, instead running away from reality into eroge and light novels and japanese animes. Hence why in spite of his supposed greater experience a lot of the stuff he says and thinks during Childhood and Juvenile periods exposes his immaturity. And why getting a second life grants him the opportunity to develop in a way that he did not in his previous life. <br><br>By comparison, Itami is a world weary soldier who went through a messy relationship that ended in divorce by mutual consent, animu and mangos is how he finds entertainment not how he evades engaging with society and work.</br></br></br>  <br>Were they divorced? I thought they were just separated.</br>  <br>They're legally divorced. <br>Although the manage to stay friends.</br></br>  <br> brown elf <br><br>are you telling me there's chocolate in this?</br></br></br>  <br>So Rudeus is one of us while Itami is a normalfag</br>  <br>Yes, used and slutty one at that.</br>  <br>even better<br><br>will she be present early?</br></br></br>  <br>Depends on how far they're gonna go. <br>If they're gonna do the entire First Season you'll see her fairly early on, like ep 10 or so.<br>If they're only gonna do up to the Fire Dragon Arc, you won't see her till well after the first cour.</br></br></br>  <br> pic? </br>  <br> One of those bitches are dead </br>      <br>holy shit fuck yes<br><br>thank you</br></br></br>   Pina doesn't wear extreme boobplate armor <br>I like it.</br>  <br>  pic <br>What is this?</br></br>  <br>Announcement that Crunchyroll picked it up for simulcast. <br>And it also revealed that this will be 2 cours.</br></br>  <br>tnx</br>  <br>Rudeus is who we are, Itami is who we wish we were.</br>  <br>Can't find this without the text. Help?</br>  <br> that pic <br>I feel bad for laughing.</br></br>  <br>That looks greatly more medieval or renaissance than roman. I am disappoint.</br>  <br>You also have to consider the format, it's not like a pocket light novel. Also, the light novel version, which is 10 volumes, is practically 400 pages each volume.</br>  <br>No it's not. It's under 270 pages. I just opened them to see. <br><br>Log horizon is about 350 pages, so Gate is significantly bigger, but not double. Like I said. <br><br>I actually own these books, dude.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it's not just shadow </br>  where is chapter 47? what's those lazy fuckers doing?  <br>How do you know about it? Currently manga translation status is the end of slaying of the dragon.</br>  <br>Her wife looks like a landwhale anyway, good riddance.</br>  I kinda want to try to read through this again, but I kinda remember all the scanlations being piss poor. Are they still shit?  <br>the soldier chick?</br>  <br>The LN?</br>  Test test  <br>OK, cool, it give a possible that anime would go further than manga</br>  <br> That blonde drill hair <br><br>She'll be getting that JSDF dick in the end.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do they want the diamonds?

Great episode. I think the anime manages to capture very well the spirit of the manga. The ending is good too. Can't wait for more.    Goddamn both the OP and ED are so catchy.  Let's hope the sub will come soon. Chaos dragon and gansta sub took forever.  <br><br>I liked it as well. Looks like it'll be slower than I thought.

That hair growth scene.<br>No wonder some of the HxH staff is working on this.</br>    Well its pretty much exactly what I expected being optimistc. if anything, I can anticipate we'll see a pretty great quantity of QUALITY fast<br>not a big trouble as long the writing is near the source</br>  Yeah that was a good episode. The OST impressed me with just the few tracks this far.  Pretty good first episode, lots of nostalgia. <br>I do kinda wish I could hear with the OVA voices though</br>  AOTS  <br>Is it possible for them to adapt the whole manga in 39 episodes?</br>  <br><br>I'm just hoping the quality remains consistent,</br></br>  <br> Here's hoping it won't get chopped up too badly. <br>They're adapting 33 volumes with 39 episodes, of course a lot will get chopped.<br><br><br>My thought exactly.</br></br></br></br></br>  I just hope the manga readers won't be too obnoxious whenever they change or cut anything.<br><br>but this /a/ so I expect the worse</br></br>  <br><br> Wakamoto won't reprise his role as Hyou <br>Well, at least that saves em some budget<br><br>.<br>Not really, If you want a 1:1 I'd go with a little less than 70.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Great episode. I think the anime manages to capture very well the spirit of the manga.  <br><br>Yeah, and the VA were pretty great.<br>The song killed the ED for me, though, but I liked the images chosen.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The whole manga? No. Apparently, Fujita-sensei cut out some bits and managed to compress the story to just the most important stuff, making it possible to adapt all of it (even the final battle) in just 39 episodes. We will have to wait to see how that turns out.</br>  <br> thinking anyone on /a/ cares about this anime and manga outside of UnT circlejerk cultists threads </br>  <br> This guy again. <br><br>Let's not start this shit.</br></br></br>  Pretty good episode to start.<br>MAPPA did a well job to adapt this old manga.<br>8.8 / 10 episode<br><br>Any confirmation for this?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think it's best to iamgine it as it's own thing rather than as an adaptation, it's a...retelling?<br><br>Besides, it can't be anything worse than<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Gpm<wbr>Sm9HDdEE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wakamoto has got too hammy over the years.
