[ which meido is best meido  Kohaku. Very evil. Very interesting.  Kohaku  Kohaku  Hisui    Tsukihime Thread?<br><br>Remake soon, it's been 7 years since it was announced.<br><br>Nasu will deliver.</br></br></br></br>  Fused meidos is best meidos  <br>I like both, but Kohaku is best</br>    <br>G-gomenasai Shiki-sama...</br>    <br>i think this is fine<br><br>why do people sperg out over the new arc</br></br></br>      <br> literally just shiro with black hair and glasses <br><br>I want my japanese harry potter back</br></br></br>  <br>didn't bother fixing the neck i see</br>    <br>They're still perfect.<br>Thank you, Takeuchi.</br></br>  <br>his legs are long as fuck</br>    <br>Good for his murder jogs.</br>  <br>new character?!</br>    Honestly, the whole 27 Dead Apostle Ancestors thing is a bit shaky, and needs reworking. It's best to just think of it as a label applied to a group of 27 bloodsucking things rather than some sort of proper organization. I mean, one of the DAAs is a forest. The other is Zelretch, the guy who put a stop to Crimson Moon's plans. The first DAA is Primate Murder - the thing that Altrouge controls.<br><br>The Tsukihime remake will apparently feature a revamped version of the DAAs. Nasu has stated that various DAAs will be "bumped" from the official list. I'm glad that this is the case, because he current one doesn't make a whole lot of sense.</br></br>  <br>Hisui of course. I want to make her happy.</br>  <br>in the tsukihime plus disc yumizuka mentions how she was supposed to have a route and got cut <br><br>there were lewds of her showcased</br></br></br>  Hisui.<br><br>Kohaku is awesome, but she's only awesome in Hisui's route.</br></br>    Hisui is boring.<br><br>Kohaku forever.</br></br>  <br>god damn is Ciel fucking great now</br>  Kohaku! But a Hisui is fine too    I wonder how Nrvnqrzquuwzqz will look now.  <br><br> no tits <br><br>THANKS TAKEUCHI-SAMA. JUST AS PLANNED, RIGHT?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hisui.</br>    <br>Forest-kun was killed though. <br>What Nasu has so far is interesting but he really needs to flesh them out. Personally, I dont think It'd be as much fun if they were all actually dead apostle or humanoid. I hope Ortonrosse remains an idiot for a leader and Altrogue keeps her body guads .</br></br>      Textless.  <br>Nice</br>  <br> gauds <br>I meant guards.</br></br>  <br> there were lewds of her showcased </br>  Not even a choice.  Oh gee, one is devoted to you, and the other is a fucking psycho path who drugs you and is behind every bad thing in the entire fucking game.<br><br>Real tough choice there OP</br></br>  <br>The used to be a quite one</br>  <br>Villains make the best girls, anon.</br>  <br>she was raped in place of her sister</br>  <br>Then why is Sakura so shit?</br>  Shonen asspull thread<br><br>Post shonen asspulls<br><br> pic related </br></br></br></br>    <br>0/10</br>    <br>The worst one by far was Naruto and Sasuke dying, finding out they're reincarnations of Asura and Indra, then coming back to life even stronger than ever. Nothing in One Piece or Bleach comes close to that.</br>  <br><br><br>still better than One Piece &amp; Naruto tbh</br></br></br>  <br> inb4 Gon-san </br>  <br> Ichigo <br> lol I am actually everything in universe. I was evena Zanpakutō once isn't the worse. <br>That said, this was the worst Asspull ever.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, it was foreshadowed that Naruto and Sasuke were the continuation of some lineage between Asura and Indra along with Madara and Hashirama.<br><br>It's the arc when Sasuke went full DARKNESS. Hokage Summit arc I think its name was.</br></br></br>      <br>I should have specified that my main problem was the "dying and coming back to life even stronger" part.</br>  <br>Fucking kek.</br>  <br> Nah, it was foreshadowed that Naruto and Sasuke were the continuation of some lineage between Asura and Indra <br>Nope, it was foreshadowed that Naruto was connected to the Sage of sixth paths.</br></br>  <br>That's what everyone assumed.</br>  <br>the whole hollow thing we knew was coming in one form or another, it wasn't so much an ass pull as it was just anticlimactic. The final form thing was totally unaccounted for, full of holes, thematically inconsistent, and just plain stupid.</br>  <br> That said, this was the worst Asspull ever. <br>Kek no and at least GER was cool.</br></br>  Th cutest.  <br>Looks like it's time again</br>  Of course, there are limitations to how many pictures can be used as only 3 episodes are out.  <br>But that doesn't change the fact that these results confirm that Nao is girl of the year.</br>  I gotta hand it to Key. They managed to make a punch feel real and enjoyable.  <br> run right past her <br>frigid</br></br>  <br> Girl of the year <br> Not Isla <br>What are you talking about?</br></br></br>  <br>Is that a penis?</br>  <br>Those are lungs</br>  <br> Isla <br> Girl <br>Giftias are not people, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>What a hottie.</br>  <br>Isla had her time. Nao actually has a character.</br>  <br>She was more human than /a/ will ever be ;_;</br>  This scene did things to me. Dat voice, dat body movement, dat face, all perfect.  <br> Key animates the punch </br>  Imouto is the cutest.

When she got pregnant she killed the guy and gave birth to Fremy. Fremy wanted to prove herself to the Majin and her mother and went to go kill the powerful saints. Then she got blown the fuck out by a powerful saint and the Majin and his bitch is like "should have aborted you." So now Fremy is trying to regain loyalty blah blah blah you'll figure it out sooner in the anime if the pace ever picks up </br></br></br>  <br>But the spoiler is in the unspoiled start of the thread</br>  <br>Well, that much has already been posted since episode 1 aired.</br>  <br><br>So now the strongest man in the world is going to turn her with the power of his dick.</br></br>  <br> She's not trying to regain her loyalty, her mom and the rest of the fiends she chilled with tried to kill her after failing, and now she's sworn revenge against them </br>  Why is Goldoofus such a chump?  <br> I read something about the first saint still being alive and being in love with a demon, how true is this? Does the first saint gag on demon dog cock like bunny? </br>  <br> This is not true   however, the saint of time after the third purge of the majin went crazy and started to hang out with the fiends to discover the origins of the majin <br> <br>Also adlet's sensei is the unknown warrior from 700 years ago</br> </br></br>  <br>He's 16 and was suckered by  BIG FAT BUNNY TATS .</br>  <br>Why did bunny have to take the demonic knot? Literal whore.</br>  <br>Because he's THE STRONGEST CUCK IN THE WORLD</br>  <br>I see, thanks. <br><br> Also bunny being fucked by demon dogs turns me on immensely, where is this revealed? I downloaded vols 1-3 of the translation just to read up on it. </br></br></br>  <br>Dude, he's 16. She's stupidly hot. Plus, she's a saint. And a princess. She's blatant waifubait until you get to know her. Not like he could be expected to know she was a filthy traitor and a cum-guzzling whore. Maybe her exhibitionism should have tipped him off, but the "less is more" dress code seems to not be all that unusual in their world.</br>  <br><br> it's not true, you got meme'd </br></br>  <br>Except even when it's shown that she lied to him his entire life and was also a traitor, he was still the biggest cuck to her</br>  <br><br>When was this? I want to read about bitch tears.</br></br>  <br>Vol3</br>  Daily reminder Bunny literally sucks dog penis  <br><br>Goddamn it.

It happens.</br>  <br>She loses an arm.</br>  It's a shame we can't have a decent thread without cancerous LNfags spoiling everyone. LNfags literally make everything worse.  <br>No, I want to pull the strap and slapped it to her boobs. Then when her boobs jiggle because of that, I'll rape her.<br><br>Is that so wrong? why is it so impossible?</br></br></br>  <br>Without LNfags there would be no threads, as there's nothing to talk about atm except "THANK YOU STRONGEST MAN IN THE WORLD" or "I WANT TO PULL HER BOOB STRAP"</br>  the 3d in the second episode fucking sucked also i fucking hate the female designs in this. i'm not even an SJW fag, they just look fucking stupid. i was really into the first episode, but i'm feeling like i'm about to drop this shit really soon.  <br>GOLDOLF IS BECOMING HALF A CUCK. HES GETTING BETTER.</br>  <br> She's a bit more rough </br>    What episode will Bunny betrayal be?  <br>THANK YOU STRONGEST MAN</br>  <br>Will Adlet pull the boob strap?</br>  <br> The strongest man in the world will use any mean necessary to win <br><br>Wouldn't that make him technically the "trickiest" man in the world?<br><br>I mean, Batman can beat anyone but no one considers him strong</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's doing it wrong. The correct response is to kneel and then permanently latch on to her leg, kissing the foot and calves while kicking away any approaching dogs.<br><br>By combining his usual hime worship with intentional trolling Goldof will move his himefagging to the next level.</br></br></br>  I love this show too bad it has shitty budget. It deserved better.  <br>He doesn't have super powers, but he packs a mean punch.</br>  <br>He is also the trickiest man in the world, while also having the title of strongest man. Going around saying you're the trickiest man in the world though doesn't sound as cool<br><br><br> Also who the fuck is Adlet's mentor and why does he know so much about fiends </br></br></br></br>  <br>At this rate? 12.</br>  <br><br>More like Chamo&gt;fuck huge power gap&gt;Hans&gt;Goldolf</br></br>  <br>He's the one slipping bunny the knot.</br>  <br> No she wants peace <br>Okay.<br><br> so she can suck monster D <br>Elaborate.</br></br></br></br></br>  So does the strogest man in the world has any kind of special power/talent at all ? Or he just the strogest ?  <br>The fiends kill humans on contact, if they're at peace, she can fuck them instead<br><br><br>He's completely an ordinary human<br><br>That's what makes him strong</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His is the power of not getting arrested for carrying concealed weapons.</br>  <br> Those thighs <br>She can kill my whole fucking family and I would still fuck her silly.</br></br>  <br> She fucks dogs <br>No she doesn't.<br> likes demons <br>Demons are actually pretty cool guys.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fruit guy is a fucking asshole <br>Dog guy is alright but still an enemy to all humans. <br><br>Haven't read anything about lion yet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't she just tell Goldof about her plan if she knew he'd side with her either way?</br>  <br> demons are cool guys <br> trusting Dozzu <br><br>You're a damned fool</br></br></br></br>  <br>Goldof would only protect her. He wouldn't do shit to help her cause whatsoever.</br>  <br>What mental gymnastics did bunny go through to sincerely believe the fastest way to a world where everybody smiles is to kill half a million people in a demonic invasion? That sounds like terrible PR.</br>  I still don't get this Bunny sucks dog spoiler. Who's dog?<br><br>INB4AGKPIC</br></br>  So when they kill Tgurneu won't shit get kinda boring? Cargikk is just a brute force kinda guy, so it's not like he'll be playing any tricks on the party  <br>It wouldn't have hurt his feelings as much.</br>  <br>It's a meme, dont worry</br>  <br>She doesn't give a shit about his feelings.</br>  <br>She doesn't care. She treasures him as a valuable tool for her agenda, and she knows he accepts that even if it hurts him to just be a tool.</br>  <br> Who is Dozzu anyways </br>  <br>Her character alignment is stupid evil. She gives the bare minimum amount of fucks that he cries bitch tears because of her.</br>  <br>Sounds like something Adrian Veidt would do. I find it acceptable.</br>  <br>It's in Dozzu's best interest to make sure they succeed in killing Cargikk, sure after he's dead Dozzu will pull tricks, but until then he's gotta make sure the party succeeds</br>  I want Aoi Yuuki to insult me in a deadpan tone.  <br>https://dl.bucket.pw/jzhgwc.webm</br>  <br>god the character design in this anime is awful</br>  <br>It's stupider than that, because the demons and humans are supposed to become friends after the demons invaded the world and killed 500,000 people. It's like if Adrian Veidt had bet on the giant squid becoming America's genuine BFF as soon as it was done killing millions of people in NYC.</br>  <br> What mental gymnastics did bunny go through to sincerely believe the fastest way to a world where everybody smiles is to kill half a million people in a demonic invasion? <br><br>Can any LNfags spoil me. seeing posts like this one intrigues me, yet makes me feel kinda stupid for not getting it.<br><br>Like, what is everyone's agenda?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure, if he OD'd on cocaine while executing his plan.</br>  <br>At the moment<br> <br>Adlet: Save the world and protect everyone, while proving he is the strongest man in the world<br>Goldolf: Priority: Protect princess, then save the world<br>Mora: Save her daughter, then the world<br>Chamo: Save the world for fun<br>Hans: Make money saving the world<br>Rolonia: Save the world<br>Nashetania: Work with Dozzu to usurp the current majin with one who doesn't despise humanity, and then kill all corrupt humans on the planet<br>Tgurneu: Take over the fiends by playing the heroes against eachother<br>Cargikk: Take over the fiends by killing all opposition<br>Dozzu: Either is genuine and actually wants peace between fiends and humans, or is playing both sides to control the fiends and also prevent the majins destruction</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br>  <br>She sounds like shit.</br>  <br> Bunny and her demon dog comrade want to unite the demons under a benevolent leader and then invade the human world to kill corrupt aristocrats and people they don't like. It's suggested at the very least hundreds of thousands of people would die, but they figure that's acceptable in the name of the greater good. And then humanity and the demons will become friends and everyone will be happy.<br>The end.</br> </br>  <br>She is shit.</br>  <br>She pisses me off.<br><br>I agree.</br></br></br>  <br>She's dog shit. Like, literally all her shit can be traced back to that fucking demon dog's shit.</br>  <br>Forgot Fremy.</br>  <br>Wow what could go wrong with that plan?</br>  <br>Oh right <br><br> Fremy: Kill Tgurneu for betraying her, and then kill the majin   and fuck adlet </br></br></br>  <br> Fremy: Adlet a best anyone else is shit then revenge </br>  <br>Worst Girl. Who sold that plan to her and why did she even bite it?<br><br><br>Best Girl. I love her now.<br><br><br><br>Thanks guys.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Dozzu fed her the plan<br> <br>Also she's somehow 'combined' with fiends to gain some of their powers</br> <br> That or bunny has been dead for ages, and Dozzu is actually using her as a disguise </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The clear best girl.</br></br>  <br>What other shows have canon dog fuckers?</br>  <br><br>Sounds like best girl</br></br>  <br>Why does she cover her right eye if she's a right-handed shooter?</br>  Is the Mesoamerican-themed setting original to the anime?<br><br>I read a bit of the first volume, and so far the story seems like it's set in a generic western-fantasy universe.</br></br>  <br> Is the Mesoamerican-themed setting original to the anime? <br>Nazca.</br></br>  <br>Her family except for the King had been followers of Dozzu for god knows how long.<br><br>Her being the youngest is obvious to adoctrinate by folllowing her mother and brother as example while daddy was away.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Akame Ga Kill</br></br></br>  <br>Bunny is alive but broken. Talking with Dozzu does that to people. Also their plan is flawed from the start since they couldn't foresee Tgurneu's lovelove plan.</br>  <br>THANK YOU STRONGEST MAN IN THE WORLD</br>  <br> Who sold that plan to her and why did she even bite it? <br>Probably her dog and her mom. She seems to be seriously into the idea, but if she wasn't she'd probably be either dead or imprisoned like her dad.</br></br>  <br>Well, her arm gets severed and she is strangled by tentacles after being ingested by a fiend if that turns you on.  It works for me. </br>  <br>Nazca what?</br>  <br> Malcom in the Middle </br>  <br>Except that it was actually the copy that said that, she was inside the fiend with her throat sliced unable to say the word help.</br>  <br>OTP</br>  <br>Ah, gotcha.</br>  <br>God damn.</br>  <br>Aside from the obvious.  Her father caught on to the plan and the fact that his kingdom had been infiltrated by all these idiots who are working to see the plan carried out. It threw the entire country into civil war and he was eventually imprisoned while his wife, who is in on the plan, and their bitch bunny daughter are running the kingdom. </br>  <br> yfw the emperor wasn't actually insane and was right about killing all the pagans </br>  <br>I want to crush her head!</br>  <br>You seem retarded.</br>  <br>She is so shit she pretty much deserves everything for being so bad.</br>  <br> otp <br> not bunny and a dog </br></br>  <br>Just that you know, nobody is a saint in there and she genuinely believes in a world of peace.</br>  <br>Bunny deserves death or she should sacrifice herself to save face.</br>  <br> Mushibugyo <br>Was this actually any good? Is that qt main/best girl?</br></br>  <br>Rolonia is a saint if you mean morally</br>  <br> You seem retarded. <br>You seem like that one guy who just sits around doing nothing except call everyone retarded while not explaining why.</br></br>  <br>Hybrid race of monstergirls populating the world.<br><br>You like monstergirls don't you?</br></br></br>  <br>Handedness and eye-dominance are unrelated. You can shoot with the opposite eye. My brother is left-eye dominant and right handed, though he's an idiot and tries to shoot left handed because of it.</br>  <br>Imagine if SnK decided it wanted to be an earnest and pure hearted story, instead of a try-hard revenge story. It's fun, but the story isn't good.<br><br> White hair is best girl </br></br></br>  <br> namefag talking </br>  <br> strangled by tentacles after being ingested <br>Did the fiend shit her out?</br></br>  Reminder Fremy Speeddraw is best girl.   horses in mesoamerica   <br>Why doesn't she hide the scar on her forehead with her hair? You know that feels more practical.</br>  <br><br><br>To be fair, letting him in on her plot would have put her at great risk for no reason better than her not wanting him to be sad. And since she's already reconciled with the idea of hundreds of thousands of people dying, coming to terms with herself for making Goldof sad was probably not very hard. She knows Goldof better than to trust him not to fuck up on something that requires a bit of brains. He's muscle, that's all he's good for, and it's for the best that he doesn't try to be anything else. And there's no practical point in telling him if he's just gonna act the same way no matter what.</br></br></br>  So...does she rejoin the good guys again?  <br>She can speeddraw my dick, if you catch my drift.</br>  <br>That sounds like exactly what SnK would have had to be for me to actually like it; non-edgy, not-trying-to-be-good, david-vs-goliath fun.</br>  I think Goldof might be the faggiest thing I have ever seen.  <br>She doesnt actually have a fucked eye, its a ruse to cover her broken horn</br>  <br>She 'rejoins' them but only to further her plans and eventually kill them</br>  <br>Proof that edge-moe does exist.</br>  <br>Of course she would be scared, yet she keeps her cool and manges to act at the right moment to call for aid.<br>Also, the only time they mention shit in the novel is when they talk about how shit Fremy is.</br></br>  <br>Oh, Come on!</br>  <br>Boobstrap.</br>  <br>It was too late when he acted, still props to him for being able to almost thwart Dozzu'z plan.</br>  <br>Does the fiends show any sign of being human-like or friendly? I'm really curious why should he want peace between humans and fiends if all the fiends are mindless, grotesque animals.</br>  <br><br>That's not true, in v4 she and pikachu actually ally with the 7 heroes.</br></br>  <br>No that anon but I catched on it when it was airing past episode 7.<br><br>I really love Mushibugyo x MC interactions.<br><br>Is the first time I automatically shipped the 2 main characters and paid off. They were just too cute.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That must be scary, finding out that most of your kingdom including your entire family are all in on a plot to potentially end humanity<br><br>He did literally nothing wrong by starting his pagan genocide</br></br></br>  <br><br>Like I said, they ally with them to further her own goals, and to kill them down the line<br><br><br>There are fiends that look like humans, and even some fiends who can act human, but at their core they are designed to despise humanity to the fullest. Dozzu may or may not be the only exception</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And that her eye is a different color, right? I know that, just felt like letting my /k/ out a bit.</br>  <br>Giving the assumption that what Dozzu said is true (it's yet to be proven), he wants to achieve armony between fiends and humans by replacing the evil Majin. From what I seem to understand the fiends are influenced by Majin volition, if he wanted peace then they wouldn't attack humans and other shit. The plan isn't fully explained yet.</br>  <br>Is white the main girl? Not getting that impression from the little I've looked up. I'll probably check it out one way or the other, shame I missed it airing just 'cause the 'bug' premise sounded silly.</br>  <br>I didn't read past what's translated but she's threatened by Fremy's explosives, they stated the alleance was only until the other demon generals were defeated, after that they would be enemies again.</br>  <br>She's a very central character to the plot, but as for the love interest, I think it's peach tits.</br>   all it takes to create a saint of something is have a temple and some followers <br><br>I'm surprised that the humans haven't abused this more</br></br>   Favaro and Kaiser aren't the last two Braves   <br><br>She is the main girl, the fucking series has its name like her.<br><br><br>They're not smart, it was Tgurneu the one who came up with that idea.<br><br>Perhaps the method wasn't known.<br><br>So it's fine to blame Mora and her predecessors for this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mora a shit</br>  <br>Akame Ga Kirru</br>  <br>She had that coming. Honestly, I was kinda pissed she didn't get worse. I want her body broken, I want Goldof to grow some fucking balls and recognize her for the malignant and disastrously moronic person she is, and I want her to recognize her ideals are shit and that all she's done is shit.</br>  <br>Nah, she is delicious and she could do far worse. I wouldn't say she deserves it, but I am glad it happens, since it does turn me on very much.</br>  Truly a dastardly villain  <br>This upsets me greatly. I think I'm going to drop this now.</br>  How does Madlet and Fremy feel about their love being a sham?  <br><br>She only did that because she had to, not because she has a natural inclination towards violence.</br></br>  <br>Why does that upset you<br><br><br><br>I wish I knew, translations never</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this your first anime where the main girl is a terrible person who wants a piece of the apocalypse happening?</br>  Whelp spoiled, oh well, who cares about plot twists anyway  <br>I bet there's going to be an asspull with wasps somehow.</br>  <br>Ha! Deserved it.</br>  Who is Dozzu  <br>Why did she do this? There's no reason for her to be a dumb slut on top of being a traitorous cunt with a retarded plan.</br>  <br>One of the three fiends who gained the ability of coherent thought</br>  Nashetania did nothing wrong.  <br>Not killing Adlet on the way to the meeting point is something she did wrong</br>  <br>So is it like, they evolved or they ate human brain and became sentient or were they created that way?<br><br>Pic partly related I just want to post a sexy pic from this series' OP just for added relevance and kicks.</br></br></br>  <br> a dumb slut on top of being a traitorous cunt with a retarded plan. <br>Reminds me of another character I know.</br></br>  <br>She wasted the big shot of her life, she might a gifted character but she is pretty incompetent.<br><br>The only reason she went this far because she is backed up by a pokemon.</br></br></br>  <br>They were created that way</br>  <br>Okay, she may be dumb, but she's not a slut just yet.</br>  <br><br>DAMN IT.<br>Why do I bother with these threads? <br>Goddamn spoilers. adofkaj;lfdjaflkjf</br></br></br></br>  why do they always have to ruin decent shows with fucking animal ears?  and who you think the main girl is? if it bunny i would killed muhself  <br>Actually, you should kill yourself regardless due to your horrible grammar.</br>  <br>so sry about my grammar</br>  So does the rabbit die or not?  <br>does anyone have the webm for this part plus the stealing part ?</br>  <br> Let me guess, and due to her lineage she was ostracized and worse by people? <br> That's why she tries to do this kind of stuff? <br><br>Why not? It seems possible to me. If the government and people generally screwed me over, then if I ever got the power to screw society right back, I'd do it in a flash. I'd be clever about it though to reduce the chance of getting suspected or caught. If the downfall of society can be done, revenge is sweet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>nice blog</br>  <br> Guy isn't the king of the braves <br><br>series would improve exponentially</br></br></br>  <br>No she just loses an arm and she was born with retardation.</br>  Why are the beautiful ones always the stupidest?  <br>Because they think they're hot shit and smart.</br>  <br>Because they don't have to work as hard due to getting advantages due to their beauty.
