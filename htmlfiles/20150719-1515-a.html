There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum, it's breathtaking, I suggest you try it.</br>  <br>But part of the anime's setting is that highschool girls have all that sluttiness repressed both in public and private.</br>  <br>I'd be too scared of cutting something important off</br>  <br>Get out of here, Dr. Evil.</br>  <br>Was Vilma hot?</br>  <br>You could put a vagOO on its place afterwards</br>  So, why did she dress him up as a girl again?

Surely Anna is a man, since I have been taught that only men are rapists, and all men are rapists. He is probably raping her. Probably fed her a date-rape drug.

I wasn't sure if it's her. Now that I think about it, she was also there the first time the scientautist attacked his pelvic region.</br>  <br>Because if he begin to fuck girls this would be hentai.</br>  <br><br> literally </br></br>  <br><br> Anon used the word correctly given the context she is indeed actively seeking his dick <br> huurrrrr of all the words you can use in a figurative sense, 'literally' is the one word out of every fucking word in the dictionary you're not allowed to use cause it triggers me </br></br></br>  <br>If pic related isn't literally lusting after dick, I don't know what is.</br>  <br><br>It's hear breaking his chastity belt.<br><br>He put it on himself because he was afraid of what he might do if he was alone with Anna.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shouldn't that hurt?</br>  Anyone know when the ED album comes out? It's pretty addicting to listen to.  <br>Not as much as the violent raping he'd be getting if he didn't have it on. Imagine death by Snusnu, but instead of a shattered pelvis, there's a 300 mile hole beneath where your dick used to be before it was obliterated from raw, hardcore sex.</br>  <br><br>if the chastity belt is made of metal, I don't know why it should hurt</br></br>  <br>Not worth the itch that comes along with the regrowth.</br>  Kajo a pure  <br>What the fuck is wrong with your hair?</br>  <br>Is it that weird to shave your balls daily?</br>  <br>How many times are you going to post this today?</br>  <br>Actually, I'm a different anon.</br>  Are there any other anime like Shimoneta that depict what it would be like if it were illegal to be politically incorrect? I like watching MSNBC, CNN, and reading Salon, Daily Beast, Washington Post, Huffington Post, etc., so this anime really clicks with me.  <br>I don't feel any itch</br>  <br>Shimoneta's basically SYD V.9 with terrorism add-ons installed.</br>  <br> thinking that two anime are similar just because they make dirty jokes <br>Anon, please. The children's board is that way ---&gt; </br></br>  <br>As much as I love Vilma, I wouldn't trust her anywhere near me scrotum with a razor.</br>  So now that Anna has finally begun her downward spiral, how long until she hits rock bottom? <br><br>Sniffing boxers should be next episode, followed by love honey. How far will she go?</br></br>  <br><br>Would you eat Anna's love honey, anon?</br></br>  <br> me scrotum <br>Are you a pirate?</br></br>  <br>It's thick and rough.<br><br><br> I dunno, but I'm too lazy for that. <br><br><br>Lucky you I guess, after kinda a week the itch is unbearable.<br><br> Actually, when I first shaved and felt the itch, worried I asked in a trap thrad on /b/ and they told me the itch is normal </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would eat it from the source, and then help her fix her plumbing to quit leaking so much.</br>  Am I the only one getting an 80's vibe from this show?<br>I know there shouldn't be any reason, but expecially OP with the narrated introduction and ED have something that feels like the 80's, andit's driving me crazy.</br>  <br>Blame the nonsensical plot. If the show had older designs and that 80s-90s grainy look, it'd fit right in.</br>  How can she be so much best girl?  <br>That voice does funny things to my dOck.<br>Actually, that everything makes funny things to my dOck.</br></br>  <br> how long until she hits rock bottom? <br>The better question is, what will her rock bottom be? Utter sexual liberation? Race-mixing? Cuckolding?</br></br>  <br> Anna cucks MC for Ayame </br>  <br><br>Anons, you read my mind. I was about to say the same things. Her and her voice is fucking great.</br></br>  <br><br><br>A-am I the only one who hates her voice?<br><br>It's really raspy and coarse. Her seiyuu needs to lay off the sin sticks.</br></br></br></br></br>   tfw i thought this anime was gonna be shit   <br><br><br><br>I will never understand you people.<br><br><br>No, you're not the only one. That voice also coming out of what looks like a toddler gives my brain whiplash.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I usually hate voices like hers but I don't know why or how, but she does it perfectly and I love it.</br></br>  <br>It's just plain perfection. Her voice gives me instant boners.</br>  <br><br>How the fuck does a voice give you a boner?<br><br>You can't fap to seiyuus, anon.</br></br></br></br>  Listening to Kajo spout lewd things is the highlight of my Saturdays.  <br>She's literally Kuroko, toddler edition. I hate Kuroko even more than this character though, cause at least she a rape-machine in Shimoneta.</br>  <br>You see that squat. <br><br>She obviously a slav.</br></br></br>    <br> How the fuck does a voice give you a boner? <br>I don't know, but Satomi Arai and and Matsuki Miyu does those things to my dick.</br></br>  <br>I can't get enough of that face. I want her to abuse me.</br>  <br>It ain't gonna suck itself.jpg</br>  <br> Listening to Kajo spout lewd things <br><br>Those are censored. How do you enjoy those things?</br></br></br>  <br>How did Anna get a hold of MC's boxers?</br>  <br><br>Would you let Kajo fuck your mouth and force you to swallow her cum?</br></br>  <br>her face reminds me of a character from a doujin but I can't remember the damn doujin</br>  <br> She's literally Kuroko, toddler edition <br>Anon, she's obviously Dark Nonon.</br></br>  <br> hating lolis </br>  <br>Kajou is perfect.</br>  <br> Not getting a boner from Watamoto's voice. </br>  Give me your worst  <br>I would. No homo.</br>  <br>Garden Eel<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tld<wbr>-I5MMbCY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>    <br>What's the sub font?</br>  <br>I think they are gym shorts?</br>  <br> Isn't a rape-machine <br><br>Ugh. fucking typos.<br><br><br>I have no hatred for lolis, just this particular seiyuu's typecasting of them. Seriously, how many times can Satomi Arai play the same abrasive lesbian loli tragically attracted to a non-lesbian that has no interest in her?<br><br>Bring me more loli vampire ojou-samas though please. Those are my loli flavour of choice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Funimation Sans Serif Bold</br>  <br><br>I decided not to drop this show because she showed up at the end of episode 2</br></br>  Haven't been in any of the threads until now. So Anna pretty much becomes an obsessive yandere for MC after this?<br> I like it. </br>  <br>Those are clearly boxers anon.</br>    <br>More like a obsessive turboslut.</br>    <br>Anna becomes obsessed with MC, and is only a smidgen Yandere.<br><br>First she will smell his sweaty shorts, and next thing you know she is baking him cookies with her love honey.<br><br>She goes off the deep end quick, that's for sure. Mom would be proud.</br></br></br></br></br>  I wish sexy terrorists were a thing instead of the allahu akbar ones we get  <br>Is the new episode out?</br>    <br>I need a gif of that desk rumble</br>  This show is categorically immoral and wrong. <br><br>Rape is defined to be obtaining carnal knowledge of a women forcibly and against her will. Tanukichi Okuma literally raped Anna Nishikinomiya, and Anna's response is that she enjoyed the rape, please can she have some more. <br><br>Does no one else see a problem here?<br><br>We should seriously consider writing JC Staff to, at the very least, express that the international community frowns upon the allowance of this depravity, and that that aforementioned depravity plays a causal role in the aetiology of cultural decline.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   He sees your dick   <br>Yes, and then ask directly from the source.</br>  <br>God damn it /pol/, I hate SJWs as much as you but can you fuck off to your own board?</br>  <br> Tumblr <br> Rape is wrong <br><br>Do you even try</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anna liked getting "raped" by MC's lips.</br>  <br><br><br> introducing the joys and wonders of lewdness to a pure-hearted maiden. <br><br>My fucking FETISH!!!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah it is, now enjoy  my personal favorite  girl.</br>  <br>Why would you do this, Anon?</br>  Will you tell here the secrets of reproduction?  <br>What does Anna's love honey taste like.</br>  <br>sure<br><br>for a price</br></br></br>  <br>This is my fetish</br>  <br>Superior webm format</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  my<br><br>fucking<br><br>DICK</br></br></br></br>  <br>Will you settle for a demonstration?</br>  <br>Why wouldn't I ?</br>  <br>are they getting lewder?</br>  <br>The other one in the gif I replied to.</br>  <br><br>dammit guy i wasnt paying attention</br></br>    Watching Anna discover sexual pleasure gives me the greatest boner.  <br> they get lewder as the episodes go on and they discover their sexuality <br><br>Makes sense.</br></br></br>  Am I the only one who wanted to see Anna win?<br><br>I want to see Anna's punishment for Kajo.</br></br>  <br> Anna discovers S&amp;M and begins to discipline Kajo, Gorilla, and MC with her tremendous Slav strength. </br>  <br><br> we can get even lewder than what we already have <br><br>impossible... unless...<br><br>no... they wouldnt air...  hand holding?? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See Anna win what, exactly?<br><br>If you are interested in the actual politics in this anime, you'll have to wait for Anna's mom to show up. She's the real boss character, not Anna. Anna is just a girl MC corrupts, which is later played for DRAMA.</br></br></br>  <br>Type more. Type until you exhaust your entire stock of ellipses.</br>  <br><br>literally the most sexually appealing thing i've ever seen aired on japanese television<br><br>is there ANY greater self-gratification than watching this unfold before me<br><br>i dont think so</br></br></br></br></br></br>   ITALY VIA AIR   <br>Capitalise your sentences</br>  <br> played for drama <br><br>Really?</br></br></br>  <br>Big tit small history or some shit like that?</br>  <br>capitalizing is for losers</br>    <br><br> "Tonight our special is a thick, steamy wiener.

It's pretty great!</br>  <br>does scientist girl ever become relevant?</br>  <br> not mentioning "rape culture" <br>One job.</br></br>  <br>It isn't a full blown genre shift, but I suspect a few episodes will be at least somewhat serious in tone. The show will always remain light-hearted though, even if/when Anna's family skeletons get revealed.<br><br>You can see Anna's mom in the OP. She's like Yukino's mom: bad news.</br></br></br>    <br>God, I hope so.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Dp5<wbr>Qf6cjrqY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>does ayame or mc develop feelings for eachother</br>  <br>Was Anna's mom a pornstar?</br>  <br>That....is actually a good question.

In a market saturated with waifu-bait and moepandering garbage, It's rare to<br> come across a title which doesn't reek of banal archetypes and generic settings. Ever since the finale of Bleach I've been searching for a show to<br> fill the void and re-immerse me in world filled with unique characters and relentless yet well thought out plot containing deep philosophical themes. I have come here to tell you that this anime is not my savior that i have been searching for. You see, I used to spend all my<br> days as a NEET watching anime, it was a truly splendid lifestyle until one day i returned to my village after visiting Comiket to find that my <br>entire family had been murdered by muslims. Ever since that day I cursed myself for being a tasteless weeaboo, if i'd practised sport instead<br> of wasting my life I might have been able to fight off the muslim invaders. Im warning you all before its too late, anime is worthless. Stop <br>watching it. You might think that its impossible, that it wont happen to you but honestly I thought the same, I would have never have anticipated <br>the tragedy which befell my family because of my avid weaboo antics. It could happen to you too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Which episode this will happen? Is this a real scan of the Manga? <br><br>My dick really appreciate.</br></br></br>  <br>Coooooooookie crisp<br><br>Fapfapfap</br></br></br>  <br>Wait she actually did that?<br><br>I thought that was some anon making shit up</br></br></br>  <br>that's the funi translation, it's shit.

Think about that.<br><br>Seriously, how many series get S4s?</br></br>  A lot, if they were as good as Illya.  Shit series, which is why Illya might just get one.  That's gonna suck for animeonlyfags who'll get fucked by that cliffhanger at the end of Zwei Herz  <br>Bro, this is Fate. Of course it's gonna get adapted.</br>  <br>They could pretty easily do an anime original ending.</br>  But Angelica. Dem tits cannot not get animated.  <br>Too big.</br>  <br> finally get to see how overusing projection turned him brown <br>neat.</br></br>  <br> All I want to know is where the fuck is Kerry </br>  <br>Doing something stupid that will blow up in his face.</br>  <br><br>I really like how his burned skinned/hair looks.<br><br><br><br>Is this from the most recent chapter or old?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How would this Shirou do in the 5th Grail War?  <br>As long as Herz doesn't flop I don't see any reason why Silver Link would stop. 3rei should be done by 2017, so they have time for another two 10 episodes seasons.<br><br>In essence we are looking at 5 seasons here.</br></br></br>  <br>Imagine UBW Shirou but from EP1.</br>  Best parents win again.  <br>With cooler hair.</br>  <br><br><br>and a single minded determination to save his sister</br></br></br>  <br>He's like a mix between UBW and HF. It's perfect.</br>  <br>This Shirou is already servant tier, hook him up with Rin via mana transfer and he'd pretty much steamroll any who opposed him.<br><br>Though he'd flop the 4th holy grail war thanks to lancelot Berserker.</br></br></br>  <br> He ends up with Angelica </br>  <br> Seriously, how many series get S4s? <br><br>Not many, but I don't think there are many series that were both successful and needed S4s to fully adapt it in the first place. If the show is successful and there's material to adapt, I don't see why there is any need to worry.</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking 10 episodes format, they could have easily fit all of 2wei! in 13 episodes and do 3rei!! this season. Now instead we're going to get fucking side chapters and more than likely anime original filler.<br>Also, fuck this new captcha.</br></br>  <br>So UBW Shirou but with HF mentality.</br>   spin-off has the best fights <br><br>They should be ashamed of themselves.</br></br>  <br><br>Monogatari series, Hayate the Combat Butler and Familiar of Zero are the only ones that come to mind. <br><br>Most shows S3 drop too much to warrant a 3rd season as sales naturally decline every season.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not difficult to be as good as complete shit.</br>  <br>Ufotable can still fix this with the HF movie(s), a lot of potential there.</br>  <br>I really thought it was some kind of battle scar.</br>  <br>I don't even know how are we getting a third season, season two didn't sell that well for a show of this budget.</br>  <br> 2wei! in 13 episodes <br>They could have done it in 10. There was way too much stuff that could have cut if they just kept it to the point. The problem is that the sales would have suffered if it had no fanservice shit.</br></br>  <br>The power of Type Moon I suppose as they are the ones funding this, still surprised Aniplex doesn't have anything to do with this series.</br>  <br>But I like the fanservice shit, I only wish they could have done it better, besides the kiss in the second episode the rest was lackluster.</br>  <br>Fuck, I only want S4.</br>  <br> I bet this kid can't even moonwalk </br>  <br><br>The sales for S2 seem to be about 5K, that's not that bad.</br></br>  <br>Nasu giving us the Illya route animated? Pleasantly surprised.  We're fucked. </br>  <br>3rei deserves to be animated, I am sure Nasu understands this.</br>  <br>Drei won't get adapted because Type Moon is too scared to let people know that Prisma Illya is indeed the superior Fate series.</br>  <br>Hidamari Sketch, Natsume Yuujincho, Maria-sama ga Miteru, TLR, Minami-ke</br>  <br>so this Shirou is best shirou than any fsn route?</br>  <br>Undoubtedly so.</br>  <br>Fate Shirou is the ultimate Shirou. Can't stop Caliberun after all.</br>  <br>What about manga sales?</br>  <br>Pretty much. His ability to do Divine Constructs already puts his projection ahead of even Emiya (save for the F/E incarnation), and he somehow pushed himself to the point he can use his RM under his own power.</br>  <br> His ability to do Divine Constructs <br>He can't do that shit, he only copy the exterior, they're hollow in the inside.</br></br>  <br>Prisma Shirou here could most likely construct Excaliber without killing himself.</br>  <br>Still more than what regular Shirou can do since he would have never been able to pull of that Ig Alima.</br>  <br>I believe Nine Lives was also a shitty knock off as well but it could still rekt shit. All projections are truly Hollow anyways.</br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #5<br><br>Remember to please take it easy and relax.<br><br>Previous thread: </br></br></br></br>  I would like to request a drawing of Mai Natsume.

Love her pouty look! And her outfit is so l-lewd, too!  No worries, anon, I can't draw hands either.

Mind if I try and get this colored some time soon, though?</br>  Requesting my little miracle relaxing on a porch swing in a sundress and hat, please and thank you!  Requesting the left image, but with Sena. Bonus if it's drawn in the show's style.  <br>There is no point.<br>You can draw and give all you can, but they won't draw her. They don't like her enough to draw and color her.</br></br>   you find another guy that waifus your waifu <br> hes the most autistic sperg on the planet <br>dont know how to be handling this shit</br></br>  <br>Fuck off to the general, retard.</br>  <br>Having an obscure waifu has some merit I guess</br>  \<br>Ignore him. Or, shitpost him to death until he fucks off. Both options have some merit.</br>  <br>I'm not autistic.</br>  Corazon spoke at last, and his voice is deeper than Evangelion.  <br>Is it sexy though?</br>  <br>Yes</br>  There will be no new Nakama for another arc.<br>Source: My dad was hired by Oda to ensure that he has a lit cigarette in his mouth at all times.</br>  <br>Frankly it makes him sound like he's 50, but it is sexy.</br>  <br> first post is a gay post <br><br>thread is starting off the right way</br></br></br>  <br>Sexy sexy beast Corazon was, waste of a character to just let this sexy man die.</br>  <br>that it bothers you so much makes me want to do it more<br><br>you really should learn to chill, it's just a picture and not even a gay one</br></br></br>  <br>Gay you say?</br>   next episode adapts the road trip <br> literally the perfect opportunity for some anime original scenes since so much of it was offscreen <br> instead the preview shows that we are BREAKING AWAY from the flashback for BellamyvsLuffy filler <br><br>This just makes no sense at all.<br>Is Toei actively trying to ruin this now? They fucking went to town with filler in Rebecca's flashback and it actually worked.</br></br></br></br></br>  Was Vergo based on Usher? He reminds me of Usher.  <br>https://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=UK8-w<wbr>h-oLp4</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I don't know but it's like they're trying to push away easy fujoshi money. The fools.</br>  <br> Frankly it makes him sound like he's 50 <br>Fuck I didn't think that.<br><br>It's nowhere near as off putting as the 70 year old grandpa voicing Ace.</br></br></br></br>  Apparently Toei made Homing the reason Doffy's family got found out they're celestiall dragons instead of Doffy's flapping his mouth.  <br>His kid voice was as girly/kawaii as possible too<br><br>I like the gap</br></br></br>  <br>Law's voice is way too deep like goddamn<br>Buffalo is cute sounding though, surprisingly<br><br>but Corazon.. holy shit. I know that voice. Can't say I hate it but I expected it to be somewhat higher</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doffy still flapped his mouth but before he did Homing went to the local market and started babling about his life and how he was a new friendly neighbor who came from Mariejois.<br>Sounds like something he would do to be honest.</br></br>  <br> Doffy apologists <br>I'm not surprised</br></br>  Why is he so based?  <br> Can't say I hate it but I expected it to be somewhat higher <br> Not wanting the most manly voice ever so his dojikko routine is even more bizarre </br></br>  <br> 70 years old grandpa  <br>Seriously ? I wasn't put off by Ace's voice at all.<br>I don't think Corazon's voice is that offputting either but it'll take some getting used to. I did picture him with a higher, more nasal voice.</br></br></br>  <br>well he looks like a fucking clown I expected him to sound like one<br><br>not that I mind it. Jeez his voice is deeper than Doffy's</br></br></br>  <br>Why do people who don't want to be seen always wear the most suspicious looking hood ever ?</br>  <br>Cause he listens to what others say and thinks rationally. I'm all for his Blind Justice system. It seems so fucking fair.<br><br>He reminds me of Madara.</br></br></br>  <br> I wasn't put off by Ace's voice at all. <br>I think the endless cuts to him grunting "MMFJJDHDHDJJDGGRRRHHJ" in MF were the tipping point for me<br><br>Anyone still have that image by the way?</br></br></br></br>  <br> 70 year old grandpa voicing Ace. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kK3<wbr>LgCudlgY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>He's by far my favourite admiral, including Aokiji, especially stuff like arguing with Akainu</br>  <br> and thinks rationally. <br><br>bringing meteors down on yourself isnt the most rational thing.

I was busy streaming older episodes to friends and missed the initial stream.<br><br>I want to hear that deep voice you all seem to be in love with.</br></br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!<br><br><br>Since Shachi is cute you can appreciate him as well.</br></br></br>  <br>See </br>  <br>Shachi a slut though.</br>  <br> no Episode of Law yet <br>Does Toei hate Fujo money? I get conflicting messages because they do the aforementioned shit like ruining Law's flashback and then insert gay Lawlu filler.</br></br>  <br> Since Shachi is cute you can appreciate him as well. <br><br>here here!</br></br></br>  <br>I will miss you, Law. The day you leave to go back to your crew draws nearer and nearer. I will miss you so much.</br>  <br> doffy probably rejoiced and threw a party for every article his cute little brother had in the newspaper <br>What is this, it hurts</br></br>  <br>I'm not sure if I like or am disturbed by how Law says "Trafalgar D Water Law".</br>  <br>Why do you always keep forgetting Bepo you piece of shit. He's the only one worth my time.</br>  Does anyone have the "boo hoo for you" Doffy imahge?  <br> lusting after Bear dick <br><br>takes all kinds I guess</br></br></br>  <br>There there Bepo is cute too.<br>Dentistanon a filthy human supremacist.</br></br>  <br>Jean Bart gets forgotten more than Bepo does. Although Bepo seems to be more prominent so I guess it's understandable. <br><br>I want Jean Bart to suddenly be a fighting doctor, too. Like a chiropractor or something. I want everyone in Law's crew to be able to fuck up people because they know medical shit.</br></br></br>  703 stream where?    <br>Thank you very much</br>  <br>Is this supposed to be funny or depressing ?</br>  <br>Dammit, Yasopp.</br>  <br>Maybe Toei asked him about who would stay longer and they make an episode of Sabo because Sabo is leaving for a while while Law will have many more occasions to shine from here on.<br>Nah, even that doesn't hold up, this was Law's arc, he was its driving force. Whatever the kind of fights he'll get into from now on it'll never be as intense as his revenge against Doffy. Fuck Toei.</br></br>  Reminder that Blackbeard took this same attack from Whitebeard without defending and was fine.<br>In the next page the sky is split.</br>  a cool gif I saved from last thread  <br>Why don't you just pretend you did it like everybody else.</br>  <br>I just think he's cute, same with Chopper.

Just more of Law's crew in general.</br></br></br>  <br>becaayse I dont take credit for other people's stuff</br>  <br>I don't think Jean Bart could be a dentist with hands that big. <br><br>Then again, who am I to question his dreams...</br></br></br>  <br>You're such a commendable man.</br>  <br>How the fuck did I spell Because so wrong</br>  <br>you're having a stroke, anon<br><br>get help quickly</br></br></br>  dumping favourite picture of best boy from last thread  <br>Last time I went to the dentist he mocked me because I couldn't open my mouth wide enough ;_;<br>Should have told him his hands were too big.</br></br>  <br>Thanks for the concern, though the doctor wont be this fucking based</br>  <br>Tell him he has big hands. Then he becomes a pirate.

The most dangerous it could ever get is him falling asleep while he's working on you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a nod to Dragon Ball, not Journey to the West, because Oda loves Toriyama and Goku,</br>  But that reminds me of the dentist/professor in sim-lab who would instantly whip out of pocket knife if you asked him for help, and fuck up whatever project you were working on while saying he's helping. He would make a great pirate...<br><br><br> &gt;Medication for parkinson stops the shaking.  <br>Kinda depends how advanced their illness is, and how effective their medications are.</br></br></br></br>    <br>There's always fanart.

His casting reminds me of older anime.</br></br>  <br>I got this off 4chan, so im still not a tumblr retard</br>  <br>Doffy's animu voice bothers me because his laugh is different from the mango</br>  <br><br>Hehe he's right now that I pay attention to it.<br>Look at the top right of your pic. It's watermarked. Moreover I'm pretty sure tumblr's gif limit used to be 500KB.</br></br></br>  <br>refer to what I said here<br/></br>  <br> I got this off 4chan <br>yes, from a tumblr user<br><br>the lesson here being, you cant exactly call someone out for using tumblr images when you dont know what they look like yourself</br></br></br></br>  <br>1 of 2 rebutting you.</br>  <br>no it's not. Doffy doesn't really have a unique laugh, "fufufu" is just a common laugh onomatopoeia. Robin's is the same for example.</br>  <br> i'm not a tumblr retard, I'm just ignorant <br>Whatever makes you sleep better at night.</br></br>  <br>2 of 2</br>  <br>ok, I was just making shitty excuses, but my point stands tumblr is a shithole</br>  <br> tumblr is a shithole <br>while that's true, so is 4chan. Non-imagedump boards specifically<br><br>it's kind of a pot/kettle thing</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off bitch.<br><br>Anyone care to give me the one piece 703 sub link?</br></br></br>  Anyone else notice that Oda sometimes seems more interested in the world than the characters these days? Since the timeskip it feels like there's been an up kick in flashbacks related to things like the history and politics of the various islands and the pasts of side characters, and fights going to members of the supporting cast that would've gone to a Straw Hat in any other arc.<br><br>There were times in the current arc where I actually felt like the Straw Hats weren't the protagonists but just one of several equally important factions. I'm not sure I like this.</br></br>  <br>No, now fuck off.<br>If you can't find it by yourself, then you have nothing to do here.</br></br>  <br>I like the focus, but I also dislike that there's no focus on the straw hats. It's an exchange of sorts, the good overrides the bad, but I still wish we get more of the crew next arc.</br>  <br> Doffy doesn't really have a unique laugh, "fufufu" is just a common laugh onomatopoeia. Robin's is the same for example. <br>Do it's not you uncultured swine. Doffy's laugh is ffuffuffu, it has the sokuon while the generic onomatopoeia doesn't.</br></br>  <br>*No<br>Can't type tonight</br></br>  <br>https://www.google.co.uk/</br>  <br> .co.uk </br>  <br> since the time skip <br>Did the anime skip flashbacks, side stories, history and politics of the various islands and the pasts of side characters, because the manga has constantly had them pre skip too.</br></br>  <br> There were times in the current arc where I actually felt like the Straw Hats weren't the protagonists but just one of several equally important factions <br>That's exactly what they were though, it wasn't an impression. Law was, technically, the protagonist of this arc. He was the one who underwent the most conflict, he was the one who suffered the most, he was the one who got everything into motion because he was the one with the objective to kill Doffy and the motivation to do so in the first place. <br>Luffy by comparison ? He got his lunch from Rebecca. He was a side character. A side character who saved Law's ass and finished Doffy for good, but a side character none the less.</br></br></br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.  <br>go count the number of decks running 101 in tournaments, both ocg and tcg.</br>  <br>Considering we're talking about D/Ds and not Performapals, chances for a decent extra deck card are good. The only cards they have so far that are trash in pretty much all cases are Pendragon, Chevalier, Pandora and the early Covenant management cards. That's a decent number, really.</br>  <br>Yeah, but do you really expect Konami to make a half decent Synchro monster? There might be like 3 total in the game, Tiras, Volc, and maybe Scar-right.</br>  <br> Synchro <br> Tiras <br> Volc <br> maybe Scar-right <br>I refuse to believe that this may not be bait.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Dropping "dubshit" because of a name. <br>Fucking elitists.

First class austistic wouldn't rate as best girl.</br>  <br>Yup, the other one look like a semen demon.</br>  <br>  /a/ is so naive to the real world its pretty sad. </br>  <br>Well I guess I have a thing for autistic girls then.</br>  <br>Natsuki is best girl! You have good taste my man.</br>  Do you feel healed?  <br>My grandad was 20 years older than my grandmom. They loved each other very much.  ;-; rip in peace </br>  <br>none</br>  <br>He cares about her, its just he's not interested.</br>  <br>Which one of them would make the best single mom and which one of them would make the worst?<br><br>Pretty sure the worst would be Natsuki. The child would probably starve to death, or she'd forget the child in the supermarket or something.<br><br>Best would probably be Midori. Asuka and Reina are also strong contenders, but they would probably be helicopter parents and the child would have an awful time growing up with a control freak mother.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When has he cared about her?</br>  <br>I would blow air into Reina's ass.</br>  <br>When she was a kid, he cheered her up by playing music with her. He also does seem to respect her as a musician and thanks her for the confession, even though he clearly put the distance between them as teacher and student.</br>  <br>Wow that's really deep my man he sure do cares a lot</br>   using girls in the metals section <br><br>Who is directing this travesty?</br></br>  Isn't Kumiko a lot closer to Taki at the end of the novels?  <br><br>What's her secret?<br><br>How can she be so erotic?</br></br></br></br>    All the third years, Natsuki, Kumiko, and Reina. In that order. Then in reverse order. Then in a big pile.  <br>She has a good mentor</br>    Holy shit, this is the biggest trainwreck I've seen in years. Disregarding for a moment the nonsense plot, the whole directing is completely rubbish. No sense of flow, no aesthetics, it's just random pandering scenes pieced together in a desperate attempt to make some money from the degenerate otaku. Don't even get me started on all the bloom and blur, the terrible CGI, all the forced animation, etc.<br><br>ＦＵＣＫＩＮＧ　ＤＲＯＰＰＥＤ</br></br>  <br>I know pasta when I see it, but I don't actually recognize this one.

If the penis belongs to a girl, it's a girl doing sexual acts on a girl - therefore yuri.<br>It's not that hard anon.</br></br>      <br>I'm trying to figure out what "forced animation" is supposed to mean.</br>  <br>I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as girl, is in fact, dickgirl, or as I've recently taken to calling it, dick plus girl. Girl is not an hermaphrodite unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning reproductive system made useful by the combination of genitals comprising a full sex act.<br><br>Many lovers mate with a modified version of the dick every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of dick which is widely used today is often called futa, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the dick, developed by our Creator.<br><br>There really is a girl, and these people are using her, but she is just a part of the system they use. Girl is the female: the organism in the system that generates eggs and incubates them when fertilized. The female is an essential part of a reproductive system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete reproductive system. Girls are normally used in combination with the dick: the whole system is basically dick with girl added, or dickgirl. All the so-called futa distributions are really distributions of dickgirl. <br><br>By contrast, yuri and its variations such as shoujo ai, which are known for rarely being infected by sexually transmitted viruses, are not based on dick at all. As a result they may lack certain features and be compatible with fewer partners, but they provide a unique form of porn that many users benefit from, even if they aren't lesbians themselves.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>She tried so hard. Stupid trombone.</br>  Would make music with all night.<br><br> Any good lewds of her out there? </br></br>  <br>There's one on sadpanda but you don't really want to see it.</br>  Comiket will be all idolshit, 2hus, and boats again won't it?  <br>There's this if it counts.</br>  <br>I think there's one confirmed KumikoxReina being released, but I don't know if it's going to be 18+ or not. <br>And apparently there's another one confirmed involving Yuuko.<br>Pretty disappointing overall.</br></br></br>  <br>Its not 18+.</br>  <br>Why even bother making it, then?</br>  <br> I don't know, though it seems to be about Kumiko's feelings.</br>  <br>Kumirei is for cute, not for fap.</br>  <br>Really good studios draw moving pictures and film them with their phones.</br>  <br>Fucking bullshit</br>  Reina x Taki nsfw doujin when? I-I don't mind if it's in spanish.  <br>Most of their art is just cute.</br>  <br>I want to toot this horn</br>    <br>You're correct, but Kumirei is definitely fappable.</br>  <br>I guess, anyway the person that's drawing the doujin though seems to be a female, and more inclined to BL. This seems to be her first GL.</br>  <br>So much for the faggot who was claiming there'd be lots of gay doujinshis kek</br>  <br>Give it time, I'd imagine there's gonna be some. I mean, I hope so anyway.</br>  <br>There is a lot of gay doujinshis coming out I've seen a lot of tiger and bunny, SNK and Utapri, Hibike is just not that popular and won't get many doujinshis in general.</br>  <br>Yuri doesn't sell, anon. Specially when it's sealed in the source material as nothing but friendship.<br>Free! in the other hand was subtext and you were free to speculate to your heart's content, since nothing was written about their romantic relationships or love interests. And you've got doujinshis being produced to this very day.<br>Bless Japan.</br></br></br>  <br> can't get a clear view of Asuka's ass <br>Picture composition by Hitler</br></br>  <br>Beach episode when</br>  <br>No anon, its more like, this anime is just not that popular. They only have 2 doujinshi's coming out so far while other anime's are getting a shit tone. I've seen a lot of Kekkai already.</br>  <br>It's popular, the problem is that yuri doesn't sell. Hell, even more of Madoka doujinshis are het hardcore porn.</br>  <br>It sold almost almost 10k. The anime is pretty popular, it just doesn't seem to attract the doujinshi crowd for whatever reason. Which is weird as hell considering how much effort Kyoani put into yuribait. I expected this show to have more stuff coming out than anything else this season.<br><br>Oh, and I'm not  obviously.</br></br></br>  <br>Is there really more het than yuri Madoka stuff?<br>I find that hard to believe. MadokaxHomura and KyoukoxSayaka seem incredibly popular.</br></br>  <br>Look yourself, anon. The doujinshis are there for you.</br>  <br>Bullshit. Going by doujinshi.org, Madoka has 4343 books, of which only 1099 are porn of any description.</br>  <br>You mean faceless het porn right? That always has more then couple shit.</br>  <br>People don't like being baited. Most Yuri doujinsh artists are focusing on Love Live!.</br>  <br>I can't believe you know this.</br>  <br>databesu, call me a databesu</br>  We always go through this "why are there no doujins ;_;" thing. They'll show up, it's just harder to find announcements for shows that aren't being picked by the well-known porn artists.  Where were you when you realized that the Prez was actually just a boatslut?  <br>I never had to go trough that with Free!</br>  <br>I could just have known that the majority of doujins in general have always been non-H, then spent five seconds to check the exact figures for Madoka.</br>    Who gives a fuck about non-H doujins?<br>That stuff shouldn't even exist.</br>  TAKI X REINA LEWD VANILLA DOUJINSHI<br>FUCKING WHEN</br>  Gotou = Knuckles-senpai &gt; Semen-senpai &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shit &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shoeitchy  <br><br>Kaori outshines them both.</br></br>  <br>I will marry her <br><br>And I mean It</br></br></br>  <br>I don't have to go through this with Kekkai.</br>  <br>In other words, yuribait doesn't sell for shit.</br>  <br>Bait doesn't sell. subtext does. Which was why Free! was a hit.</br>  <br>and why Hibike! isn't. I'm glad, so glad.</br>  <br><br>And not to mention Fujoishits actually spend money compared to yurifags.</br></br>  <br>Love live though was a huge hit. NozoEli and NicoMaki are all over pixiv.</br>  <br>Fujoshis are great. They spend lots of money and draw vanilla amazingly well.<br> I'd honestly have my own taki collection of shit but I know Kyoani will do little stuff for him </br></br>   /a/ will never have another Hibike! thread hit 500 replies <br>I think we know why</br>  <br><br>I don't watch Idol shit but didn't the main characters have male love interests?</br></br>  <br>One once hit 960 replies or something.<br><br>Good times</br></br></br>  <br>why</br>  <br>Not in Love Live! None of those girls have love interest.</br>  <br>OVA is probably going to have at least a couple of fanservice scenes, so I expect at least 2-3 threads to max out in December.</br>  <br> <br>OVA<br>season 2 announcement</br></br> </br>  <br>I think you are mistaken <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128124<wbr>678/</wbr></br></br>  <br>I will spam /a/ to death when this happens in October.</br>  <br>Just how "yuri" is LL? I have it in my backlog but iM@S is the only idolshit I've seen.<br>Is it just pure subtext, and if so, how subtexty is it? Like, KyoukoxSayaka tier?</br></br>  <br>You sure there will be a season 2. I bet they are just going to announce another Free! movie. That event is gonna be full of fujoshis</br>  <br> Like, KyoukoxSayaka tier? <br>Even less, the only one who has anything really going for is Nico x Maki.</br></br>  <br>It has a lot of subtext, between the characters, and the merch that comes with it really like to pair them with their specific partners. Eli and Nozomi in the anime are pretty much attached to the hip, and Nozomi does seem to have a homosexual vibe honestly.</br>  <br> You clearly never watched both seasons.  <br><br>The ones that have the most canon subtext in the anime is Nozomi x Eli.</br></br></br>  <br> no Kaori <br>What a shitty image.</br></br>  haibane oboe has gotten more fanarts than "main characters"  <br>True a shame. Thankfully she will be on the OVA.</br>  <br>Kumiko has the best swimsuit. Stylish, not too modest and not too slutty. Why am I not surprised? So best.</br>  <br>she looks like a fucking granny with wonky tits</br>  <br>for what purpose</br>    So wait, yurifags lost? Picked up.  <br>They never won because one of the girls is deeply in love with her teacher and she has eyes for nobody but him.</br>  <br>Yeah, the way she linked her fingers together with Shuuichi in the last episode was really cute.</br>  <br>You mention that and not the kiss? I was surprised we got more kisses in the final episode than in the entire history of Kyoani.</br>  <br>You're a faggot if you think it means anything. Was it romantic? no. Where they trying to encourage one another? no. Where they anxiously waiting for the results? yes. <br>They didn't look at each other's eyes as they shyly locked their fingers. They were literally doing whatever friends do when they're competing for something.<br>If you call that winning then you're del/u/sional.</br></br></br>  <br>Literally 99% of the posts made by "yurifags" in these threads were just shitposters baiting gullible newfags. Very few of them ever actually expected to win, considering it's het source material and everything.</br>  Official Hibikes fuckability ranking<br><br>Kaori = Haruka &gt; Asuka &gt; Natsuki &gt; Nozomi = Reina &gt; Midori = Hazuki &gt; Kumiko &gt; Oboe-chan &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You should take maximum precaution for this girl, you must wear steel armor and fuck her with your lance &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ribbon</br></br>  <br>So not only yurifags, but the girls were kissing men? I'm going to marathon this and then come back to bask in yuri tears.<br><br><br> yurifags were only pretending to be retarded </br></br></br></br>  <br>Reina is unreachable for anyone who isn't Taki.</br>  <br>Was it something that in the original happened between her and Shuuichi? Yes.</br>  <br>There was both anon. I won't mention any names, but there was both yuri and het kisses (I don't remember if it was four or five kisses total). Also, I know it was only implied, but there were definitely implications of some yaoi.</br>  <br>He's making shit up. There was no kissing.</br>  <br> Was it something that in the original happened between her and Shuuichi? Yes. <br>In a completely different context you cuck. It isn't the same.</br></br>  <br> yurifags were only pretending to be retarded <br>It's pretty hard to resist baiting when people fall for it so easily. You could just post a random KumikoxReina fan art and you'll get at least 5 angry responses, guaranteed. Even right now, in this very thread, there's an idiot falling for a shitposter pretending to be a yurifag arguing it was a yuri win.</br></br>  <br> yurifags were only pretending to be retarded <br><br>Look at the posts on /u/. 40% believe there won't be any yuri, 40% believe there will be yuri, and 20% change their opinion based on the most recent episode. It's hardly set in stone.</br></br></br>  <br> Sapphire and Hazuki &gt; Kumiko <br><br>What kind of shit are you smoking?</br></br></br>  <br> Look at the posts on /u/ <br>Not even once.</br></br>  <br>There is no need to bring up /u/ when discussing the threads here. Very few /a/ yurifags (still) go to /u/, and /u/ is on a completely different level on its own. Hell, on /u/ you can find people who excitedly talk about how Kill la Kill was a great yuri victory.</br>  <br>Doesn't change the fact that those yurifags lurk and post here and their shit opinions. So yes, they're really relevant.</br>  <br>"I love you too, Shuuichi-kun"</br>  <br>Just thinking about this makes me happy.<br>They're so cute and I wish there was more fanart.</br></br>  <br>why do you think they come here even until today? they are so mad they lost that it's embarrassing</br>  <br>Don't make her sound out of character. These two never used kun or chan.</br>    How does Reina call Taki outisde of school? Noboru-kun? Noboru-san? Noboru , the love of my life?   novelanon you there  <br>Darlin</br>  <br>What in the fuck makes you think novelanon doesn't have this picture saved already? who the fuck do you think you are? the only bitch with access to pixiv?<br>fuck YOU</br></br>   you will never date this gorgeous piece of meat   <br>Reina is daughteru material, not waifu material.<br>Do not sexualize the autist.</br></br>  <br>what are you talking about?! ...</br>  <br>How do you think she'll be in bed with Taki? will she scream? cry? punch and pull hair?</br>    <br>Cry. because Taki will only grunt out his wife's name.</br>  <br>So she'll faint?</br>  <br>No, anon, she is so fucking hot.</br>  <br>th-that would be really sad  ;_; </br>  <br> Mfw this artist is working on more Taki x Reina stuff <br>I'm so happy</br></br>  <br>He will tell her bedtime stories and sing her lullabies until she falls asleep. Then he'll gently pat her on the head and go to sleep as well.<br><br>Then the next day during recess Reina will excitedly talk to Kumiko about how amazing Darlin was in the bed last night, and Kumiko with her filthy mind would get a completely wrong impression.</br></br></br>   and then I said: "huh? why?" when he invited me. Then the damn beta simply ran away   <br>Who the fuck reads bedtime stories to their significant other?</br>   you will never have a Natsuki gf <br><br>How do you cope</br></br>  <br>She would do her best but then she would probably give in.</br>  <br>I do hope they keep it in character, and Taki is oblivious. Or they might make angst involving the wife.</br>  <br>What I've seen so far is pretty in character. My expectations are high though.</br>  <br><br><br>THANK YOU BASED OBOE-CHAN</br></br></br>  <br>d-don't make me sad  ;_; <br><br> you will never fuck this all </br></br></br>  <br>Do you honestly think Taki would have sex with her, he knew her since she was a kid. Its gonna be rather weird and uncomfortable in his view. Since he's always seen her as a kid not a woman.</br>  <br>I don't even remember who is the artist.</br>  <br>Then hopefully it will be a lot of Reina being awkward and Taki oblivious, and then with angst Taki holding his wife's pic while Reina watches him by the door.</br>  <br>Do you have the full picture?</br>  I know it's asking too much but I just wish KyoAni commits and finally works on a material that gets a really good closure.<br><br>You know, how like Bones actually finished FMA when the manga ended. I really can't blame them since it is the nature of the business but god dammit do I want to have a closure.</br></br>  <br>He's known her since she was little, but he didn't see how she grew up. It isn't weird, specially when you consider how stunning she is.<br>She'll go overseas, and when she returns she'll be a beutiful grown up woman. Nothing Taki can do about it.<br>Attraction will be imminent.</br></br></br>    <br>There's only one sketch in her twitter and it seems Reina is awkward there. <br> I want nsfw though ;-; </br></br>  <br>Somehow I didn't realize it was the OP image.</br>  <br> he knew her since she was a kid <br>So?</br></br>  <br>You kidding right? I thought you wanted the full res.</br>  <br>But Taki likes outgoing women. She'll have to be more social to get his full attention. That's how his wife did it. I see Taki being attracted to personality not just looks.</br>  <br>That's only gonna work if Reina is drawn in her mid 20s, late 20s.</br>  <br>Reina's special though, she wants to make him happy like any other woman has. I think that's more than enough for him to notice her, if he realizes how deep her love for him is I'm sure he'll come to accept, appreciate and cherish it.</br>  <br> Attraction will be imminent. <br>Taki only finds loli-senseis attractive.</br></br>   I will never see her again <br><br>I wanna die.</br></br>  <br>Man, I'd love to see a doujin where Reina tries to befriend and mimic normalfags like Hazuki to increase her odds at winning the T.</br>  <br>It's funny because she looks an awful lot like Reina.</br>  have someone watched the BD vol 2 already? how different from TV is it?  <br>Its awkward man, shit my friend introduced me to his cute 8 year old kid 8 years ago, now she's a teenager and she won't stop staring at me weirdly. Honestly Its just creepy OK knowing someone since they were a kid is just awkward.</br>  <br> loli </br>  <br>Is she cute? would she be considered gorgeous by other people?</br>  <br> A lot like Reina <br>Are you kidding me? She looks more like peace chan.</br></br>  <br> you will never have a character development like this </br>  Asuka will become a teacher  <br> Blue yes <br> Dark hair <br> Fringe <br> Bangs <br><br>she's practically Reina</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Aerodog doing 3P with fatty and glasses for C88 <br><br>I am going to buy the shit out of this.

Christ sake man are you that desperate that you'd go for someone in high school?</br>  <br>heh, yes. Pretty accurate actually.</br>  <br>If she has a crush on me, hell yeah.<br>Not anything below 16 though.</br></br>    <br> She shows emotions.  <br> Blue eyes, not lavender <br> only thing in common is the hair.  <br><br>She is nothing like Reina.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Time to learn the drums.</br>  <br>Reina has emotions dude. Didn't you watch episode 8?</br>    reminder season 2 is bound to happen  <br>She needs to show it more often.</br>  Are Taki and Michie dating?    <br>Nozomi is gonna steal the show, her weird quirky personality is gonna make everyone fall for her, just like how she made Natsuki idolize her.</br>  <br> streaming </br>  <br>She will if she's around Taki</br>  <br>wh-what's wrong with this screenshot <br> 1.15MB <br><br>this triggers my autism</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hopefully Hashimoto can rile her up, he seems like a real womanizer.</br>  <br>Is Green Mayoi fixing her skirt?<br>Slut.</br></br>    <br>The whole section is sluts.</br>  you now remember this.  <br> grumming-chan <br><br>There was a guy who liked her right?</br></br></br>  <br>Got the webm of her crying and Midori and mini-Midori hugging her?<br><br>I really should have made that one.</br></br></br>    Clarinet is so cute.

If we do find an environment where we can fight without getting anyone else involved, do you really think we can beat that High Priest?” <br><br> “Of course!

I will admit he isn’t someone I can optimistically say we have a 100% chance of beating.”<br><br>That was an admirable thing for someone so full of self-confidence to admit.<br><br>Kamijou made a suggestion as he pedaled.<br><br>“We can’t randomly attack him until we pull our odds up to 100%. As you’ve seen, his morals give no thought whatsoever to human life. He isn’t going to spare you just because you beg for your life.”<br><br>“I know that, but that brings us back to square one. How exactly are we supposed to have 100% odds of defeating that monster? Throw him in a garbage disposal plant’s incinerator? Run him through a print shop’s rotary press to crush him flat? Tear him to pieces with the giant lawnmowers used on American farms? I can picture him coming back from all of those with a smile on his face.”<br><br>“U-ugh. You sure can come up with some surprisingly gruesome ideas, Misaka.”<br><br>“D-don’t act so disturbed!! I only gave you those examples because you asked!! Mumble, mumble (Huh!? Was it a mistake to watch all those zombie movies yesterday!?)”<br><br> “I can’t know until I try. I will admit he isn’t someone I can optimistically say we have a 100% chance of beating.” <br> That was an admirable thing for someone so full of self-confidence to admit <br>Cute ad ever so full of confidence. That's my Misaka.<br> zombie movies <br>I never figured Misaka was into zombie genre.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fiamma <br>Our new red useless jobber. Touma and Mikoto being hopeless against High Priest is one thing, but Fiamma being useless in the end too? Only Touma can save us.</br></br>  <br> Only ANTI-Touma* <br><br>I meant.</br></br></br>  <br>She's a gamer. Probably played arcade shooters with zombies in them.</br>  <br> I never figured Misaka was into zombie genre. <br>you're are probably too used to nagai mikoto who is always trying to be cute and buy frilly shit. Mikoto is a straight up tomboy in index and the only girl thing about her is the gekota love.</br></br>  <br>Eh, I see plenty of her tomboy side in the manga and Index Nagai's Mikoto does bother me since he downplays her ability and makes her suffer from CSI a bit.</br>  Reminder that the Aikawa girl gets raped after the thugs find out she just led them to a wild goose chase.  <br>Oh yeah, I sometimes forget that Mikoto is fond of playing arcade games too. She always have those coins.</br>  Holy shit Touma's support is useless, this was obviously not the time for her to have the spotlight and be the heroine when facing a magic god. She cant give relief to Touma, cant offer any ideas to help the situation. Misaka is still very ignorant even to magic itself so it must be hard to open up to her and explain everything properly. She is more concerned about riding a bike with a boy while her feeling are welling up inside and hardly notices how much Touma is suffering. Fuck man bring in Index or Othinus as support, hell even accel would be doing a better job at least Touma can explain to him whats happening. She is only giving Touma more problems than actually helping, it must be fukou da at work here to make him suffer as much as possible. Hopefully Misaka can make a comeback by the end of the novel and do something meaningful while having the spotlight this volume.  <br>  index will never be relevant again as support <br>This is probably one thing that she was actually good for,</br></br>  <br> Hopefully Misaka can make a comeback by the end of the novel and do something meaningful while having the spotlight this volume. <br>Top kek</br></br>  <br>I was actually wondering myself why Othinus never crossed his mind when he was wracking his brains trying to figure out how to beat a Magic God, there's literally no one better to ask</br>  <br>Getting to her would be too difficult at the time and chances are if he did HP would start doing things a bit more seriously. Not much else better to crush his spirits than harming the girl he fought the world to protect.</br>  <br>He already asked Othinus how to beat a Magic God during the whole St. Germaine stuff. She basically just said loldunno.</br>  <br>Litteraly Touma can go home, pick her up and stuff Othinus in his pocket while on the acrobike. Or it could have been an Index and Othinus team up to take down a magic god like in NT12. I am truly baffled that Misaka is the heroine of this volume. She better at least learn or even have little understanding of the concept of magic or this volume truly fails and would make me wonder what he wants to do with her character.<br><br><br>All of AC and the world are in danger from Touma's view point. When comparing a magic god to the strength of the world Touma thinks magic god will always win. Othinus is in danger either way at home or next to him.<br><br><br>Index and Othinus were both going to analyze and come up with a way to take down a magic god without negotiation. Dont know why kamachi wouldnt use that here in this situation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is no rest for Touma.</br>  <br>Misaka wasn't useless in other battles in NT. This time the enemy is a Magic God, so it's not going to go well no matter. So why are you riding her hard so much? While outmatched in every way, I'd say she handled herself quite well against a monster like High Priest. She managed to saved those people in the buildings he threw at her, and that's something only she was able to do because of her ability.<br><br>We already know from spoilers that this volume basically lets Misaka see there's a gap between her to help Touma against Magic Gods. She realizes it and that obviously with open up sub-plots for her to develop and become stronger so she can be more useful to Touma. Theories of Nuit of awakened wings from last thread might just come true in future volumes.</br></br></br>  <br> Hopefully Misaka can make a comeback by the end of the novel and do something meaningful while having the spotlight this volume. <br>She doesn't.</br></br>  <br><br>That's half the point of this volume. By the end she gets that Touma's messes are way out of her league. Hopefully that will lead to her either improving herself so she can be useful or backing off next time.<br><br>Hopefully. I wouldn't be surprised if she just goes "Ima help him anyway!" and doesn't develop at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Theories of Nuit of awakened wings from last thread might just come true in future volumes. <br>Nuit is never going to come true, just move on.</br></br>   She's shit blah blah because she isn't able to deal with a Magic God <br><br>I guess you-know-who came early this time.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off there isn't any shitposting here.</br>  <br> She knows she's completely useless to Touma and that means she will get a power up soon! <br><br>Not like Mikotofags are any better.</br></br></br>  <br> replying to it </br>  Biri biri is giving me second hand embarrassment when reading her parts.  <br>We're actually having a civil discussion for once so fuck off.</br>  <br> can't discuss mikoto in anything but a positive light and must seek out a silver lining no matter the scenario <br>looks like you-know-who is here</br></br>  <br> Speculating typical plot and tropes is now a bad thing <br>You can't be serious.</br></br>  <br>How isn't that better than shitposting?</br>  <br>Where's the shitposting?</br>  <br>Because it's just delusions form faggots who seem to forget that Misaka cannot handle that much power.</br>  Every goddamn fucking time without fail.  <br>No one would turn away criticisms if they are valid. Senseless hate that tries to turn every angle into something negative and throw reasonably out the window can hardly be considered criticism, much less valid.</br>  <br> Thinking she can do anything <br><br>Is she still that much of a doofus?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Like fucking clockwork.</br></br>  <br> Senseless hate <br>Where?</br></br>  <br>In her defense, Touma still hasn't actually explained jack shit to her.<br>And against her, every time she's going to ask him about things, she goes tsundere and attacks him.</br></br>  <br> Senseless hate <br>I don't see any hate in this thread, fuck off.</br></br>  <br>Pretty much just people laughing at her current situation it isn't any worse than fiamma getting called a jobber and the new stiyl. you are over reacting.</br>  So ignoring the shitposters, how will things go after the magic gods either get doge'd or fisted? I'm honestly surprised that Touma hasn't tried to make a more organized group for dealing with all of the bullshit that pops up around him. If the Kamijou Faction finally gets officially formed, I'd really like to see how the different characters could work together to bring their strengths forward instead of being so spread out, but then that would also take out a lot of the challenge in many of the situations.<br>Also, since Touma has been getting a lot more brutal in his actions lately, how long until he is actually branded as a "villain"?</br>  <br>The "Hero" is already here so it's only a matter of a few volumes.</br>  <br>IT is funny how he keeps saying that is a magic god and asking her how she plans to stop a magic god without telling her what the hell a magic god is.</br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128195<wbr>732/#q128200494<br><br>Don't play dumb.<br><br><br>It doesn't have to be Nuit, idiot. Even if it was Nuit or some form of it, any plot development that goes down that road will make it work. Speculation of that form is way better than the shitposting "that" guy does.</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>The plot will probably shift to Laura and England. Kamachi already said that.</br>  <br>I don't see any shitposting here besides you trying to start shit.</br>  <br>He's obviously asking where the shitposting is in this thread retard</br>  <br>Why are you bringing shit from another thread? The other post in here is a perfectly valid opinion/criticism/complaint/whateve<wbr>r.</wbr></br>  <br>Thelemic deities are going to be relevant eventually, its just a question of whether it comes up as a powerup or another crisis for Touma to solve.<br><br>Kamachi's science is a mess but hell if he doesn't do his homework on the occult. No way the obvious resemblance to Nuit was an accident.</br></br></br>  Purple is my way of life.  <br><br> Denying it <br>Oh right, of course you would.<br><br><br>And the second link is from this thread.

We did a decent job at ignoring him last night, but so much for that.</br>  <br>That's not shitposting you retarded piece of shit. On any other thread that would be considered legitimate criticism but apparently to you it's just shitposting.</br>  <br><br>You faggots are just trying to derail and destroy another thread again.</br></br>  Bringing this from the the other thread in archive.moe<br><br> about High Priest being who had killed Aleister's daughter.<br> This is most likely true. There is no direct indication on what really happened, but hints are every where. High Priest's past was revealed during the interlude. He was a monk who was trying to attain Buddhahood to bring salvation onto humanity and make the world a better place. But after he completes all process to become a magic god, he was not recognized as a Buddha due to the political matter of the time. Thus, High Priest taken that as the world's answer to him, that the world wants to be saved by a monk who can't throw away his earthly desire and failed to achieve the enlightenment. Ever since, he has behaved as such, as he means to save this world. <br>Now, when Kihara Dog finished High Priest off, he said the following:<br>"This is a message from the ghost (Aleister)."<br>"Do you still remember? ...To make the world a better place, to save every single one of the humanity. The name of my daughter who has been trample over and her life taken away by such a childish gear of destiny."<br><br> And High Priest's last ward that couldn't reach Aleister is "I am sorry." <br><br> So yeah, even High Priest didn't personally killed Aleister's daughter, he is definitely related to her death. <br><br>In regards to Kihara Noukan's magic god killing power suit.<br> "Anti-Art Attachment, Set Up." <br>"7th School District Central, connection to Aleister has been confirmed."<br> Also, the process of Noukan annihilating the High Priest is being described as delivering Aleister's "power of will". <br>It is been hinted that Anti-Art Attachment is so broken because it is borrowing Aleister's power.<br> BTW, Aleister noticed something is wrong after he finds out all the magic gods are gone, when Noukan only killed off Zombie and High Priest. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br>  <br> Purple </br>  <br>Why are you spoiling shit on an LN thread where everyone has already read every volume?</br>  <br> Trying hard to shit on her because she can't beat a Magic God and say she's a bad heroine for this arc that the author intends for a reason just because she isn't as useful as Othinus or Index <br> Not subtle shitposting and implication "THK" has done many times before <br>Just go.</br></br></br>  <br><br>MAGIC GOD should give a hint.</br></br>  Cont.<br><br> About Neph<br> She use the term "exile" to describe World Rejector's power. She met up with Touma after her encounter with Kamisato. She asks Touma to side with her by telling that Othinus might be Kamisato's next target. Unlike High Priest, she is not that concerned about making Touma their arbiter and actually is pretty fond of the Academy city. </br> </br></br>  <br>Refer to<br><br/></br></br>  <br><br>Anon nobody gives a shit about spoiling here.</br></br>  <br>So Neph might be trolling or mistaken? Or completely right</br>  <br> Hints are everywhere <br> Aleister straight up accuses him <br>That's a hell of a hint</br></br></br>  <br> can't discuss mikoto in anything but a negative light and must seek out a flaw no matter the scenario <br> Comparing Fiamma's tongue-in-cheek joke about jobbing to literal shitposting from a autistic hater </br></br>  <br>Magic God isn't as obvious as it sounds in Japanese. That's also what they get for speaking a shitty language, though. You forget, earlier in the Railgun manga Touma mistook the "ari" from "arigato" to mean ants.</br>  <br><br>She wants that T</br></br>  <br>She could also be lying to save her own skin</br>  <br> magic gods accidently aleisters kid <br> he declares war on magic in general <br>i can see it.<br>i also have a feeling this is essentially laura's fault as well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, purple.</br>  <br> literal shitposting <br> autistic hater <br>Where?</br></br></br>  <br>The whole theme magic gods have had going on is that they're too arrogant to lie. They're just extremely whimsical.<br><br>Like High Priest hasn't lied so far, he just changes his mind at the drop of a hat.</br></br></br>    But Aleister's daughter can't be dead because Index is still alive.<br><br>   yfw Index is actually a clone of Aleister and Laura's daughter </br></br>  <br>Why are you spoiling?</br>  <br><br>More interested in why he would try to imply it and then use spoilers.</br></br>  <br>Index could be a second daughter. I feel like that theory has been sunk though</br>  Why does Kamachi hate lolis but love shotas?  <br>It's complete crack so it's hardly been sunk, it just also has no evidence for it</br>  <br>Because purple skin is disgusting.</br>  <br>LRD pls go. You're not fooling anyone.</br>  <br>so in the end once again who just want to see the world smile.</br>  <br>I actually find that interesting. In story, wasn't she described as pale skin? Does purple mean pale and I just wasn't aware? Because I thought purple meant asphyxiated.</br>   raildexfags still reading this garbage  <br>Well of of course the most cancerous fan base enjoys eating shit.</br>  <br>Ugly loli.<br>I'm happy Nephthys is alive instead. Niang Niang is disgusting. Kamachi made the right choice and kept the better one alive.</br></br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br>says the guy who is shitposting</br>   Anti-magic god hand <br> Anti-magic god armor <br>Kamachi really made them so strong that he had to go the rock paper scissors method.</br></br>  <br><br>Not him, but kill yourself. She has a great and fappable design.</br></br>  <br>I figured she's purple since she's an undead chink vampire. Could also just be Haimura's preference.</br>    Ha ha. Magic Gods.  Magic to my dick, that is.   <br> Aleister's "power of will" <br>1 word nietzsche.<br>it makes perfect sense</br></br></br>  <br>Because the lolis in this series are shit.</br>  <br><br>Can't wait the lewd she will do on Touma.</br></br>  So, why is Crowley floating upside down in his tank?<br><br>And in what universe is the Renji of Raildex aka Stiyl a 14 year old? How did that happen?</br></br>  <br> Touma is now living with 3 girls <br><br>Somehow this is still unlucky for him.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it is related with the Will concept from Thelema.<br>Also, from the choosethelema website:<br> In studying Thelemic literature, you will notice that skepticism and the scientific method are strongly advocated. Thelema holds that there is no need for blind faith in its teachings. By earnestly doing the prescribed practices, you can and will have spiritual experiences. Each practice can be tested and confirmed. This method is called "scientific illuminism," or "the method of science, the aim of religion." <br> "the method of science, the aim of religion." <br><br>Funny stuff.<br><br><br> one is a headcrab <br> the other is a fary he cannot fuck <br><br>He has no excuse for Nephthys, though. If he doesn't go for that delicious goddess he is gay.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I still refuse to believe she's going to be living with him just yet. There's too little reason for her to stay in his room after Anti-Touma fucks off, and even before he fucks off she might just live in the room above or below or something.<br><br> Don't get me wrong, I'd love for her to stay, I'm just pessimistic. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Nephthys probably worries the fuck out of him as she isn't weakened to Othinus tier.</br></br>  <br>He has a walking one-man army Albino and a billion-volt electric middle schooler at the height of puberty that constantly fuck with him.<br>She might be harder to actually beat than those two, but he's already surrounded by time bombs.</br></br>  <br><br>Don't think Touma will command Accelerator or bring Mikoto into his fights.</br></br>  <br>You think he'd bring in Nephthys? He won't even bring in Othinus, and she's fucking portable-size.<br><br>Besides, she'd apparently be useless against Anti-Touma aside from identifying him. And honestly, Touma will probably stumble across him by chance first and they'll even hit it off.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't recall Accelerator "constantly fucking with him".</br>  <br>A fight every month or two is actually frequent enough. Though Mikoto does go overboard.</br>  <br><br> "This is a message from the ghost (Aleister)." <br> The name of my daughter who has been trample over and her life taken away by such a childish gear of destiny." <br><br>Aleister is a "ghost", whatever that means. Index is the same, explaining the silver hair and grimoire storage powers. Her name was trampled over when Laura replaced it. Her life got taken away every time her memories reset. She's not even related to Laura, her appearance just warped over time like Aleister's.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nephthys scares the shit out of him because she could pretty much explode him with a thought.<br>also his waifu is the fairy he can't do shit to.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, no. They had only fight that mattered.</br>  <br> Exile <br>So is Niang-Niang kill or not?<br><br><br> everyone who mocks a popular character is the same person <br>THK is like the Raildex answer to /pol/'s Jewish obsession.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> whatever that means <br>It means he's publicly dead</br></br>  <br> Touma will probably stumble across him by chance first and they'll even hit it off. <br><br>I can see this happening. The best partwould be the  betrayal scenewherein Kamijou will watch Othinus die right in front of him as Kamisato touches her with his right hand </br></br></br>  <br> one girl possesses a thousand grimoires in her head that usually attracts magician <br> one girl is a former magic god that possess the knowledge of a magic god <br> onw girl is literal magic god <br><br>No its suck<br><br>ita like his keepig sht that will fuck him in the ass sooner</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying touma wouldn't go full murderhobo at that point and become the single most dangerous guy in academy city. </br>  <br> So is Niang-Niang kill or not? <br>Not technically, but pretty much out of the picture for the rest of the series.</br></br>  <br>honestly he seems to be upgrading.<br>next girl who lives with him will probably have powers above magic god.</br></br>  <br>Anon:<br> The will to power (German: der Wille zur Macht) is a prominent concept in the &gt;philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. The will to power describes what Nietzsche &gt;may have believed to be the main driving force in humans — namely, &gt;achievement, ambition, and the striving to reach the highest possible position in &gt;life <br>Aleister is always called ,,Human,,thats why i thoungh nietzsche.</br></br></br>  <br> next girl who lives with him will probably have powers above magic god. <br> So Laura? </br></br>  <br>But then she'd steal his bath from him, where will Touma sleep then?</br>  <br>Provided he has to share the bathtub, which i doubt Kamijou would agree with</br>  <br>He could just stop being a gay and sleep with Laura. I bet her breasts would make a good pillow.</br>  <br>What if Fiamma becomes a woman, achieves even more power, and then lives with Touma?</br>  <br> next girl <br>You really think his dorm is going to become full of women?<br>Remember when Asia had nowhere to go so she got shipped off to Komoe?<br>Or how Fraulein fucked off between volumes with no explanation?<br>Or that singing bitch from the movie?<br>Even Lessar and Birdway were a one-night stay.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that while jobbing?</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Aisa got shipped off because otherwise that would have made her too relevant.</br>  <br>No i think it´s more like a vacation.<br>Magic Gods are importent for the world!<br> Just as humans wither up all on their own if they forget to breathe or eat, the world &lt;will roll down the hill to destruction if it is simply left to the ravages of time. The &gt;world has only lasted to this day and this moment because a great many people &gt;are desperately holding that giant snowball up and keeping it from rolling down. <br> That is why the end will come suddenly.  <br>And we found out that the Magic Gods are creating Destiny.<br>What is this new world without Destiny?<br>after some time they will came back.<br>Probably after they are bored.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> more like a vacation <br> Kamachi literally put the magic gods on a bus </br></br>  Noukan kills off high priest and anti touman kills off nyang nyang right?  <br> last scene in the series is Niang-Niang bursting out of nowhere and landing her bare crotch on Touma's face </br>  <br>Aleister is a ghost for he is supposed to be dead but still persist, he is a shadow out of time.</br>   High Priest offers Touma to be the mediator of magic gods <br> fucks off because he doesn't it yet but he is controlling magic gods on his own, with Index soon becoming one <br> yfw he turns into a Demon Lord and becomes the lord of Demons aka the Majins aka Magic Gods. </br></br>  <br> Hm, all the illusions that I believed in were &gt;destroyed a long time ago </br>  <br><br>The same place where he found the hoodie</br></br>  <br><br>That be stupid.</br></br>  <br>this would be both hilarious and amazing if kamachi remembered this mess.</br>  Holy shit the meta discussion is simply out of control. Do you guys seriously believe the Raildex world is real and kamachi only decides what characters to put in a novel and the rest writes itself? How can putting Misaka in this volume be a mistake when it was obviously meant to serve the overall narrative in some regard? He's been building her up and foreshadowing stuff with her since the very beginning, but /a/ continues to believe he's a hack writer who doesn't have any idea what he's doing. It's embarrassing to read these threads. I honestly wish it wasn't the only reliable source of Raildex info.  <br>Unfortunately /a/ always assumes the author is shit and doesn't know anything. Just look at One Piece. No matter what Oda does, it'll be regarded as asspull by half of them. Some of it may have been planned 10 years ago, but no one cares apparently.</br>  <br>/a/ is retarded and its discussion is shit<br>there is literally nothing new.</br></br>  <br>If you want a proper discussion, you can do it somewhere else. This is how /a/ rolls anyway.</br>  <br> wow its fucking nothing <br>just like always</br></br>  <br>It doesn't matter if Kamachi had this entire series planned out 8 years ago or if he just makes it up as he goes along.if /a/ doesn't like it or grows to dislike it when they liked it before, they'll shit on it.</br>  <br> Do you guys seriously believe the Raildex world is real <br>What.<br><br> How can putting Misaka in this volume be a mistake <br>Who called it a mistake?<br><br> He's been building her up and foreshadowing stuff with her since the very beginning <br>Foreshadowing for what? That she's going to be a constant presence throughout the series? Or do you mean the angel mode shit, because that has to do more with AIM foreshadowing than it does Mikoto herself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fun fact. Nietzsche is a saint in Thelema.</br>  <br>Index has been RPS since day one.</br>  <br>it explains alot really.<br>thelema is the edgelord hipster religion after all.</br></br>  <br>Nietzsche was Anti-edge.</br>  <br>Obviously you haven't been reading the right posts. Look through the archives and read the discussions regarding the plot and HP's offer to Touma. Also the references or parallels to events in OT.</br>  <br>  edgelord hipster religion <br>I believe that it was pol's law religion in action</br></br>  <br>So basically this volume is all about Misaka realizing that she's being outclassed by OP magic shit.<br><br>I'm going to assume this means 1 of 2 things.<br>1. Misaka goes on a quest for power, training and studying esper theory to try and find a way to compete with these new enemies.<br>2. Misaka becomes 99% irrelevant and only appears in the future because of her popularity.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mistake <br>Why are you taking  THK's posts  seriously? You shouldn't.</br></br>  <br>  new enemies <br>New enemies can be weaker.</br></br>  <br> 1. Misaka goes on a quest for power, training and studying esper theory to try and find a way to compete with these new enemies. <br>“Now then. I need to renew my guts and train myself all over again.”</br></br>  <br>  So, why is Crowley floating upside down in his tank? <br>Because of tarot symbolism.</br></br>  <br>This may be the first time in months/years that Misaka has shown a side to her that i like.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>   Unfortunately, Kamijou did not have a trump card to use here. <br><br> That was when Mikoto spoke to him from the back seat. <br><br> “Hey, wait! Hey!” <br><br> “What is it, Misaka!?” <br><br> “I get that this is some abnormal monster. I get that he’s after us and that ignoring him is bad news! But I have a suggestion!!” <br><br> “Which is!?” <br><br> “We have another abnormal monster right here!!” <br><br>Anyone else got embarrassed of Mikoto here?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is prideful, I'll give you that. But to say she is a monster despite facing REAL monsters before, god.</br>  <br> implying the hanged man has anything to do with floating upside down in a tub of piss, or being able to straight up ignore quantum physics by being in multiple places simultaniously. </br>  <br>  ignore quantum physics by being in multiple places simultaneously <br>Between uncertainty principle and wave functions what part of quantum physics is ignored here?</br></br>  My boy here ready to shank the fuck out of magic gods.<br><br><br>Why can't touma just give a quick explanation of what a magic god is so misaka stops saying retarded shit?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm curious. What is this quick explanation that you think the stubborn and very science-minded Mikoto would believe? Note that she's seen magic and heard the term magic many times already and still hasn't figured it out.</br>  <br>Forget pic related.</br>  <br>She's a sheltered ojou-sama, their minds would not allow them to see that there are things beyond their little part of the world.<br><br>Didn't Saten also recognize that something wasn't definitely not esper powers once?</br></br></br>  <br> Why can't touma just give a quick explanation of what a magic god is so misaka stops saying retarded shit? <br>He doesn't have time for this shit</br></br>  <br>mikoto has seen and told about magic and she still refuses to believe it, I doubt she will believe that hp is an all powerful god. She has a fedora made of electrons.</br>  <br> yfw even if she goes through the infinite hells Touma did she is still incapable of seeing it is magic </br>  <br><br><br><br>Alright fine what if he just said the guy was way stronger than accelerator?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then she'd just want to try to find a way to beat him with Touma. That's basically what happened in the latest parts, what with the zombie movie killing methods.</br>  <br>Because that's not true anon, kamachi been holding back accel because he's too strong for these guys.</br>  <br>Kinda forgot shit but is his auto reflection shit only on when he flips the switch on the choker?</br>  <br>Unless he has the wings out.</br>  <br> Explainations <br> In Index <br>If we had those, Misaka would actually be able to comprehend magic stuff or Touma would know about the Fairy spell, the only effective spells against magic gods in the Kamijou faction and some more stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>i'm actually kind of legit pissed he didn't figure out what in the actual shit the fairy spell did, he had actually seen the results of it with othinus.</br>    <br> only girl thing about her is the gekota love <br> wants big breasts <br> loves romantic movies <br> have a good taste in girlish things and clothing <br> hangs out only with grills <br> example to follow for all grills from Tokiwadai <br> tomboy just because MUH BATTLES <br>What the heck?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> wants big breasts <br> hangs out only with grills <br>pretty sure guys want those things too<br> good taste in clothes <br> wears shorts <br> example to follow for all grills from Tokiwadai <br>But she isn't and does a lot of unladylike things and gets into trouble. She is nothing like the girls we see in NT7<br> tomboy just because MUH BATTLES muh shorts, muh horror movies, muh physically active girl <br>it wasn't just the battle thing</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is also her physique small boobs and lean is a classic tomboy body type.</br>  <br> &gt;wants big breasts <br>And guys don't?<br> &gt;loves romantic movies <br>Yes. Ash Williams is so dreamy.<br> &gt;hangs out only with grills <br>Because the school keeps them on near permanent lockdown against boys<br> &gt;example to follow for all grills from Tokiwadai <br>Parameter list aka that's based on a lie. In reality she's a horrible example for her fellow students.<br> &gt;tomboy just because MUH BATTLES <br>Who do you think you're fooling.<br>Ignoring the rest since it's subjective and as such easy bait for long drawn out posts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Fiamma is back <br><br>Hell yeah, too bad about the jobbing though.<br><br>What was that paperplane trick even about? I thought GRS couldn't use normal spells apart from their broken ass angel magic. I can see Fiamma using the fairy spell because it's still based on the power of christianity over other religions but this is just a paperplane phone.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He is no longer a member of the GRS because his arm it's gone I think. At first I thought that it was Tsuchimikado to be honest.</br>  <br>im pretty sure alot of us did, paper airplane? prolly the guy known for folding magical paper...</br>  <br> pretty sure guys want those things too <br>You want big breasts? You're a trap or so? <br> wears shorts <br>What's wrong with it? She don't want to show her pantsu.<br> and does a lot of unladylike things and gets into trouble.  <br>Like Mugino or Kanzaki? So, Mugino is tomboy now. Sick logic.<br> muh horror movies <br> “Eh? That was the real Beverly Seethrough. I’ve seen her picture in movie magazines before. She’s the genius new director who received high praise last year at Cannes. It was big news that an underage girl managed to outdo the veterans she was up against.” <br> Misaka Mikoto did a spit take. <br> “Wha—Wai—Dahhh!! You mean she’s the one that made “An Iron Bridge is a Sign of Love”!? If so…gmaaaaahhhh!! I need her autograph!!” <br> Mikoto yelled, but the huge-breasted girl had already disappeared into the crowd. Mikoto’s miserable cries resounded throughout the area. <br> “People were treating her like she was the next big thing in European romance films, but I guess she ended up coming here. They must be trying to make a really showy film.” <br>Also<br> muh physically active girl <br>All girls in Raildex is physically active. Except Misaki.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Except Misaki <br>Nah, she's active ly destroying my dick. </br></br>  <br><br>Would Accel and the entire Mikoto Network be able to destroy the MG?</br></br>  <br>SAVED.</br>  Does the headcrab even appear in this volume?  Mikoto a cutest girl. <br>Mikoto a strong girl.<br>Mikoto a  best  girl.</br></br>  <br>Your posts are also embarrassing to read, you whiny crybaby.<br><br><br> THK <br>Point it out in this thread. You can't, faggot.</br></br></br></br></br>  Mikoto isn't a real tomboy. It's pretty simple, no boku, no tomboy.  <br> Alright Misaka listen up. In esper terms, that mummy is basically an esper with infinite power, his personal reality being universe warping so he's able to recreate the universe as he sees fit and is basically immortal, you can nuke him but that won't phase him any more than what we've been doing to him. Also I never managed to beat the only magic god I ever went against and instead had to resort to mind fucking her which won't work on him and I really really don't want to go through that again. </br>   Railgun easily deflecfed <br> still think she have chance </br>  <br> Misaka : Eh? Nandate? </br>  <br> Uh, nevermind </br>  <br>Yeah I can sadly actually see her respond like that.</br>   2015 and I still don't know what happen to this chick   <br>the doctor? She just fucks off forever.<br>saiai starts dressing like a cheap hooker.</br></br>  <br>Whatever you do, don't watch past episode 16.</br>  Nyang-nyang is cute!<br>CUTE!</br>   tfw accel is watching all this from the shadows   <br><br><br>As bad as Silent Party was, at least it gave some closure to Shinobu.<br><br><br>Also, Vol 3 finally arrived.<br>They STILL REFER TO MIKI AS "MS".<br>Where the fuck can I complain to Yen Press?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No! She put my bitchy Mikoto in her place! She did something unforgivable! She deserved to die!</br>  <br>Have those fucks never seen Miki? He's obviously a man.</br>  <br>She identifies as a woman, you transphobic shitlord.</br>  <br>i facepalmed at that scene</br>  <br>When will he go back to wearing this T-shirt? Everything he's been wearing after that looked shit.</br>  <br> uses ore when talking in public events <br> identifies as a woman </br></br>  <br>Yeah, that was quite funny. She clearly doesn't know how weak she truly is in the Raildex universe.<br>Then again, it was also cute. Mikoto is one brave little girl and I respect her for that.</br></br>  <br> fightmonger mikoto &gt; terrorist mikoto &gt; gekota mikoto &gt; tsunbiri &gt; nagai mikoto</br>  Reminder that Accelerator is showing affection to WORST and Last Order behind closed doors RIGHT NOW  <br>she is that retard huh</br>  <br>In general terms, Railgun Mikoto &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Index Mikoto = Nagai Mikoto</br>  <br>It's not surprising she would think that way. She has no idea that magic exists and AC keeps telling her that she's the third most powerful human being.</br>  <br>forgot that especially when she teamed up with kongou</br>  <br>My god, why WORST has two left foots?</br>  <br>Fuck no. Railgun/Index Mikoto&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<wbr>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<wbr>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Shit&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<wbr>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nagai<wbr> Mikoto.</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Reminder that WORST and LO's feelings for Accel are fake.</br>  <br> Index Mikoto on the same level as Railgun Mikoto <br><br>Yeah no. She's unarguably a better and more likeable character in Railgun.</br></br></br>  <br>I disagree. Both of them are great.

Finding actual examples and critiquing them in any meaningful manner will take a lot of time, but in general I will say that the writer needs to clarify the prose. There is a principal in writing called "Wash your words with acid." Basically, this means that you should try to get rid of any unnecessary words, phrases or other things.

That's what doujin's are for.</br>  <br><br><br>Ok, one less thing to read then</br></br></br>  <br><br>No, Touma keeps getting into deeper shit and eventually it gets international, while Mikoto remains completely ignorant for the longest time, then she finally decides to follow him to the other side of the world and he brusher her off because he's dealing with important shit.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, Kamachi doesn't give a shit about romance. <br><br>The Railgun Manga will keep teasing Kamikoto until the end of time though since Fuyukawa is such a huge shipper.</br></br></br>  <br>Nigga, this isn't a romance series, at most there'll be a bit of harem comedy, then we go straight back to the action</br>  <br>Nope, Mikoto and Touma are too beta <br><br>Fixed.</br></br></br>  <br> Touma <br> beta <br><br>He straight out isn't interested in Mikoto that way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Touma wants a girlfriend but knows he can't maintain a relationship due to shit.</br>  <br>Seriously, Touma gave the biggest hint this novel and that is the first one to confess wins the Touma.</br>  Where can I download the VN's?

Aogami literally means blue hair. Blue Hair is a retarded name, but it's better to remind you that it's not his real name, unlike Aogami, which for someone with limited japanese knowledge could sound a normal name.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but Kami sounds like shit to be honest.</br>  <br>Why did you ask that again?</br>  <br>Cos I didn't get an answer the first time. I was genuinely curious about it.</br>  All versions of Mikoto are great. Except for Nagai Mikoto though.    <br>Go ask Kamachi.</br>  <br>If nobody can answer you after asking many times there's probably a certain reason for that.</br>  <br>as I have herd from these threads, stiyl is a result of miscommunication between kamachi and haimura. haimura already design and drew him before finding out his real age.</br>  <br>aogami isn't his name?</br>  <br>No. We've known that forever. There's a lot of characters in Kamachi works who never get real names and only go by nicknames.<br><br>On the other hand, we know the princess' real name in Heavy Object but her nickname is the only one used regardless.</br></br></br>  Re-reading Index now with YP release, I noticed that Aogami lives in a bread shop, because he thinks the uniforms are cute.<br><br>Then in Vol 3.

I'm sure magic god qualifies as its own fetish for Aogami.</br></br></br>  <br>Please study some Japanese before you make a bad joke.</br>  <br> That's Izanagi. Izanami is the yandere wife of Izanagi. <br>That was the joke, but I fucked up the filename</br></br>  <br>She's also known as Izanami-no-kami.<br><br>Holy shit.<br>Aogami is Izanagi.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not the same kami.</br>  <br>P-please</br>  <br>Damn, son.

Shirou projects gold bars for her.  <br>Luvia is really pretty</br>  We've been over this a million times. She gets money from magical patents.  Filename.  <br>Still waiting for the ShirouxLuvia spinoff.</br>  <br> old men </br>  She's a prodigy belonging to a lineage of great magicians. <br><br>If there is a prodigy going to a university how do you suppose they attend without having to pay for anything or getting a job. <br><br>It's painfully obvious. She's skilled and she was accepted as part of a scholarship program where she signed up to be part of magical trials and a partnership with greater magical programs. As part of this program she pleases old men for money and that's how.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Guess who got a card-design in Grand Order and who didn't<br> Even Atomic Gatorade is more important than Luvia </br></br>  <br/>  <br><br>  pleases old professors for scholarships  </br></br>  She forces Shirou to work for her.  <br>Wait... is she pimping?</br>  <br>Fucking bourgeoisie<br> If only she wasn't as cute </br></br>  <br> pleases old men for money <br> forces her boyfriend to please old men for money <br>Why is Rin such a bitch?</br></br></br>  <br>Of course only Rin would do that</br>  Why is Luvia so slutty, bros?  <br>She has to release it somehow so it doesn't get pent up. Not everyone has the option of pleasing old men for money.</br>    REMOVE ALL LUVIAS   WAAAH STOP USING THE WORMSLUT MEME <br> THE OLD MEN MEME IS FINE THOUGH TEEHEE <br><br>Fucking Sakurafags</br></br></br>  <br>Don't mind them.<br>They have nothing else and the movie won' come out for more than a year</br></br>  Isn't the place they are renting out is owned by Luvia?<br><br>So Shero pleases Luvia for money and lodging?</br></br>  <br>Luvia bought it all off.</br>  <br>but I thought shirou does it for free, or was that only archer and that's what rin is trying to change about him?</br>  <br>THREAD THEME<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wBJ<wbr>cBH6js6w</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> get buttfucked by Alaya to do it for free <br> need to beatdown self so he won't do things for free </br></br>  <br> implying we aren't Ilya/Luviafags </br>    <br> Luviafags <br>They exist?</br></br>  Why do people hate the DEEN adaptation? The characters are much better drawn and don't look like rhinos.  <br>You're right, they look like demons.</br>  <br> richer than Rin <br> kinder than Rin <br> better magus than Rin <br> better bust than Rin <br> does not PLEASE OLD MEN FOR MONEY like Rin <br>Obviously they exist.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I prefer the rhinos quite honestly. To each their own.</br>    <br> She's a prodigy belonging to a lineage of great magicians. <br><br>Rin is mediocre and her lineage is ever worse.<br><br>That holy Grail War is a piece of piss event for the other mages from higher league.</br></br></br></br></br>  Here's something Luvia doesn't have but Rin does; plot relevance.<br><br>Check and mate, Luviafags.</br></br>  <br> kinder than Rin <br> better magus than Rin <br>That's a lie they are equals, and if we go by Case files characterization of Luvia she isn't kinder.</br></br></br>  <br>Rin also wins the Shiroub owl<br>And is more popular than Luvia<br>And is more competent than Luvia</br></br></br>    <br>The TV UFO version will always be the best for me. I like it because it shows more of her face.</br>    <br> Prisma <br>Bro they are suppose to be equals in all except bust size which goes by preference. Actually Rin has some sensei traits in her which I doubt Luvia has, so in character Rin is richer than Luvia.</br></br>  How does it feel to have a waifu who  PLEASES OLD MEN FOR MONEY?   <br>Impressive luvias</br>  <br>Don't you ever get tired of saying that, Luvia?</br>  <br>Good because I am an old man.</br>  <br>Technicaly there's no single mention of Luvia having similiar magical potential to Rin outside of Prisma.</br>  <br>but can you pay for Rin?</br>  <br>She's an expensive slut tho</br>  <br>But Prisma is basically canon now so it's all good</br>  <br>Yeah, I keep $5 on me at all times.</br>  <br>The author disagrees with you</br>    <br>/thread</br>  <br>He makes even the doujins canon. <br>Fuck off</br></br>  <br>There are probably more Luviafags then Ayakofags, Leys/Sellafags, and Taigafags put together.</br>  <br>You are right, my bad but lining them as equals was Nasu's idea I believe.</br>  <br> Someone bought adspace for this <br>Hilarious, assuming it isn't an edit.</br></br>  <br>Prisma is canon. Doujins are not canon.<br><br>If it has the TM logo on it, it's canon somewhere.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes prismaverse is canon in the prismaverse, not the in other universes though.</br>  <br>lining them as rivals was Nasu's idea.</br>  It was at this moment that Rin became totally obsolete to the Fate franchise.  <br>The rules of the Nasuverse literaly don't apply to Prisma.</br>    <br>Yeah and how can rivals not be equals is my point.</br>  fate stay night is garbage  <br><br>I am a Rinfag and I love how she runs towards Shero reminds me of other ojous.</br></br>  <br> Rin is mediocre <br><br>Rin is on track to be one of the top 100 mages in Clocktower history, that's not what one would call mediocre</br></br></br>  <br>Why are you thinking that rivals have to be equal?<br>Also not having the same potential doesn't mean that they are far apart this early in life.<br> In HA Avenger!Shirou describes that Rin's power seems to grow massively with each day and that it kind of scares him<br>It was the scene where Bazett shows up</br> </br></br></br>   Luvia will never please you for free <br>;_;</br>  FATE 2 ROUTES<br> Luvia <br> Bazett <br>   Flat </br></br></br>   plebs can't like Rin and Luvia at the same time <br>I pity you fools.</br>  <br>Who cares.<br><br>She can't beat Shirou and he's a retard that thinks he's a sword</br></br></br>  <br><br> mediocre </br></br>  <br> Why are you thinking that rivals have to be equal? <br>No idea I am just drunk please excuse me.<br>   In HA Avenger!Shirou describes that Rin's power seems to grow massively with each day and that it kind of scares him<br> It was the scene where Bazett shows up </br> <br><br>Damn don't remember this but very nice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She can't beat Shirou <br>Which you base on?</br></br>  <br>But he is actually made of swords, both his mind and body.</br>  <br>Remove Flat, slap in the Seiba clone, Gray</br>  Reminder that Luvia is pure and saving herself for Shirou.

I said she can't beat Shirou and wanker-kun is saying she can which we all know is not true. <br><br><br>Sure waifufag, same way she can touch Archer with her jewels amirite?</br></br></br></br>  <br> THAT SAKURA IS A VIRGIN AND RIN ISNT <br>Please present your evidence that Rin isn't a virgin in RN</br></br>  <br> fandiscs <br> canon  <br>pick 1</br></br></br>  <br>Rin is a virgin is every version of the VN no matter what.</br>  <br><br>So Koyama draws her with big breasts?</br></br>  <br>Not after Shirou fucks her</br>  <br> same way she can touch Archer with her jewels amirite? <br>Are you actualy saying Shirou is as fast as Archer?<br>Because you realy should reread the VN.<br>And yes if her Jewels hit she could kill pretty much anyone besides Caster and Saibah.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well he can draw exactly 1 bodytype so it isn't suprising</br>  Is  OHOHOHO  a miracle of the universe?<br> I think so. </br>  <br>But the jewels won't hit anyone. <br><br>And it doesn't matter him not being equal to Archer, Rin's still a slowpoke compared to him and you know it. <br>Stop wanking your waifu faggot</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying that wasn't just spatial distortion magecraft </br>  <br>I'd find this to be incredibly cute.</br>  <br>Come again?</br>  <br>She was using zabaniya</br>  <br> Rin's still a slowpoke compared to him and you know it. <br>Eh no.<br>Please quote something that would support that</br></br></br>  <br>You sure about that?</br>  <br> Using hyperbole as proof <br><br>Are you fucking serious? see ya fag</br></br></br>  ITT:rinfags BTFO  <br>Why are all the clock tower magi so much better than Rin?</br>  <br> rinfag through and through <br> slowly becoming a luviafag <br>What have I done?</br></br></br>  <br> I don't have any arguments so I post bait-pictures <br>Please quote the part where Shirou is much faster than Rin.</br></br>  <br> Unironically getting mad because of a Meme <br> Unironically getting mad because of a Meme about a fictional character <br> Blaming people that are not and never were known for shitposting  <br> Blaming people that are known for being quiet and despising shitposting in their threads <br> Not knowing Rinfags are the worst fanbase out the three and can't keep quiet in their own threads </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She acted so slutty in the original VN that nobody would expect her to be a virgin if it wasn't outright stated in order to pander to virginityfags. Those statements were removed in RN. Ergo, she isn't a virgin anymore in it.</br>  <br>So your headcanon trumps what the VN says?</br>  <br>As expected of a gorilla.</br>  Saber  <br>Ilya's arms are far freakier</br>  Why Shirou is not rich again?<br> project a sword from gold <br> smelt it back into a gold bar <br> project a sword with diamonds in handle <br> pick them out </br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just perspective</br>  <br> implying it wouldn't go poof </br>  <br>RN trumps what the shitty porno says.</br>  <br>Projection doesn't disappear.<br><br>That's how Rin discovers his magic is not strenghtening but projecting</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah and what in RN implies that Rin isn't a virgin?</br>  <br>because he's unaware of loss ,nor aware of gain</br>  When Shirou traces a NP, does he use strenghtening on it? <br><br>Can he actually do it?</br></br>  <br>No she realised it was a Reality Marble</br>  <br>What is Caladbolg.</br>  <br>But that's just a lie.</br>  <br>A "fake helix sword"<br>According to Furigana</br></br>  Shirou should just project money.<br><br>Or Rin should use her magic to defraud major companies.</br></br>  Since the grailwar is such a low-tier event, is there any Fate work around that goes on a bigger scale?  <br>Caladbolg II you mean?<br><br>That's a broken phantasm, Archer overcharges it with prana and shoots it like an arrow.<br>He doesn't use strenghtening</br></br></br></br>  <br> thinks </br>  <br>My bad. Overcharging with Prana is actually strenghtening.<br><br>I went full retard. <br><br>But still it's not really useful, I meant as in strenghtening to fight with them. What he does with Caladbolg makes it blow up like a fucking nuke</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Strange fake has the possibility of becoming something "big enough", so much so that Zelretch had to send his own "imposter" and Fate/Grand Order is literally an attempt to save humanity from doomsday (I hope they fail so I can see the cutest Type-Moon character, ORT, have a first good day.)</br>  <br>Her not being stated to be one.</br>  <br>I suppose you can also count Fate/Extra since it's also within an attempt to preserve whatever is left of humanity.</br>  <br> &gt;Strange fake has the possibility of becoming something "big enough" <br>As does F/SN, as does Tsukihime as does literaly everything by TM besides Mahoyo</br></br>  <br>Neither is anyone else.<br>Absence of proof isn't proof of absence</br></br>  If the grail ended up shitting out mud over the human race, and Gil/Kirei get their way, would counter force kick in?  <br> besides Mahoyo <br>I'll fucking fight you.</br></br>  <br>A cute</br>  <br>Okay but did Zelretch find F/SN to be such a dangerous situation that he personally had to interfere? No. <br><br>He did show up to bust Rin out of court though; what a nice man.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah.</br>  Posting strongest master  <br>Yeah</br>  <br>Nobody in the Clock Tower speaks French though.</br>  <br>Keep telling yourself that, Rinfag. Reminder that she confesses to Lancer in UBW and sleeps around with half of London in HF. Face it, she's a slut.</br>  <br> Falseflagging as Sakurafag to start waifuwar <br><br>Why?</br></br></br>  <br>No, don't spread lies. She only sleeps with the rich people in london.</br>  <br>Gil is so stupid. If he DID manage to eradicate most of humanity, there would still be DAA, True ancestors, and all other sorts of shit roaming the Earth while the human population is now left at a 1%.</br>  <br> Sakurafags </br>  I watched the first season of Illya last night out of boredom,  It was ok.   <br>Patents. The Tohsaka family gets plenty of money from their patented rituals &amp; especially now that Kotomine isn't managing Rin's money.</br>  <br>Luvia is allowing them to stay in that building tho. Rin broke after the war using all those jewels</br>  <br>1st season didn't have enough material, it has a lot of loli filler (not that bad tbh). 2nd season is also like that, but also better.<br><br>Watch it.</br></br></br>  <br> ShirouxLuvia <br>Absolutely disgusting anon. The only person who belongs in Luvia's bed aside from Luvia herself is Rin.</br></br>  Tohsakas patented Kama Sutra books designed for old men.  <br>If Rin and Luvia are similar polar opposites, does that mean Luvia bangs young, poor, attractive men for  fun? </br>  <br> Kirei used Rin's money to maintain Gil's lifestyle for 10 years <br>What an ass</br></br>  <br>Of course Luvia would. She becomes one step closer to Rin's vagina.</br>  <br>original qt.</br>  <br>I plan to, I hope Rin get's some more screen time. She was best girl.</br>  <br>No, she bangs young poor attractive  woman  for free.</br>  <br> Luvia <br> average tits <br>Who the fuck did this.</br></br></br>  <br>Rin is whoring herself out to Luvia so that they can stay there.<br><br>Sherou is doing some work too.</br></br></br>  Why didn't Rin ever try honest ways of making money?  <br>She has magic that can screw with people's heads, right?<br><br>Why doesn't she try to use her magic to get some extremely valuable stock for dirt cheap?</br></br></br>  <br>If Luvia offered you plenty of money as well as room &amp; board for sex, how would you respond?</br>  <br>She explains why she doesn't do it in the beginning of every route.</br>  Rin x Luvia hatesex when  <br> Rin <br> Honour.  <br><br>Anon, please.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No. Rin finds the stuff inside the shed in Fate and freaks out thinking Shirou may be using the First or some other weird shit. Then it turns out they're just projections that are so stupidly well made even Gaia can't figure out they're fake. They only ever banish in the case where they don't meet up with Shirou's expectations of them (usually by breaking when they shouldn't) but for the most part are so close they might as well be the real thing.</br>  <br>I would decline.</br>  WHY IS PRISMA ILLYA IN ITS 3RD SEASON AND THERE IS NO TSUKIHIME REMAKE<br><br>WHEN WILL THE BEST TYPE MOON GIRL GET WHAT SHE DESERVES</br></br>  <br>Heavily implied to have already happened in prisma illya</br>  <br>You know - is Recette supposed to be wearing overalls or a dress or... what is that thing?</br>  <br>Why is Ange dressed like redesigned Arc?</br>  <br>If a remake was made now it would probably have the new shit designs.<br>Do you honestly want that?</br></br>  <br>Not everyone is gay in prisma, anon.</br>  <br><br>Super cute.</br></br>  Best girls are the non-magical ones.  <br>Marry left, marry middle, marry right.</br>  <br>Always wanted to fuck brown tomboy.<br><br>I hate Nasu introducing characters and not using them for anything. <br><br>He does it all the time</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They sure are.</br>  <br> mfw Shirou doesn't have a tomboy in his harem <br>Taiga doesn't count as one since Taiga's a tiger.</br></br>  <br> decline <br>I understand. Sex with Luvia is inferior to Rin.</br></br>  <br>Reminder that Taiga can beat servants.</br>  <br>lots of who-chans!</br>  <br>Himuro might be down for that, but how would get the other two to go along?</br>  For someone wanting to get into the whole Type/moon Nasuverse scene, does it actually matter if I start from Tsukihime or Fate or whatever else?  <br>Start with anything, so long as the thing you're starting with is a VN.</br>  <br>They come as a whole, You either fuck all of them together or none at all.</br>  <br>Start with Kara no Kyoukai.</br>  <br> there will never be a tsukihime anime <br><br>why live</br></br></br>  <br>You can start with Tsukihime or Fate/stay night or Kara no Kyoukai, it doesn't really matter.<br>You can even start with Fate/Zero. Purists will get get mad but obviously it worked well as an entry level series for lots of people</br></br>  <br><br>It's not just Sakurafags, though. Everyone knows Rin is a slut.</br></br>  <br>Start with anything you want.<br><br>I would recommend starting with Tsukihime since the routes are shorter but there's more of them so you won't get too bored(you can skip already seen shit too) with the same story. <br>Also remember far-side routes are best.</br></br></br></br>  New episode is up. Nao is pretty cute.  tfw we will never see Misa again  <br>Yusa is superior anyway.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Why so buttblasted?</br>  I want to ______ Nao Tomori.  <br><br>Fucking MAL cancer get out.</br></br>  <br>Humilliate, degrade, then remove so MC-sama can go back to how he was in first-half from episode 1.</br>  <br>Won't she stick around until Yusa loses her powers?</br>  <br>Her power is to summon her so yes.</br>  Key eyes are scary  <br><br>you can't handle charlotte's smug?</br></br>  <br>Charlotte is pretty cute</br>  <br>imouto will be a villain, so it makes sense.</br>  <a href="http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1437258540690.webm" target="_blank">http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1437258540690<wbr>.webm</wbr></a>  <br>Muh dick.</br>  <br>So cool, anon.  faggot </br>  Waiting for gjm  <br> NowKiss.webm </br>  <br><br>This I want more of this. <br><br>Ever since Saki and Miura did this on Ore Gairu, I've become oddly sensitive looking for my next hit. <br><br>Delinquent girls looking sizing each other up, seeing if bitches trying to start fights, telling each other to back the fuck up or get smacked the fuck up, anime or manga when.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How can somebody who is the head of a student council act like such a delinquent?  this guy reminds me of TK for some reason  <br>they only do delinquent stuff to bring more people to the school, the real student council is probably the discipline comittee</br>  <br>Because of the covered eyes?</br>  <br>She's an annoying bitch that takes pleasure in ruining the fun of others.</br>  This is pretty good so far and Ayane is doing a great job.  Nao have reached the maximum level of irony, even higher than [s4s].  To be honest, I have mixed reactions from this episode, but leaning a little more towards negative. Everything that happened from the phone incident up to the confession scene was a deliberate excuse to force Yusa to transfer at Hoshinomi Academy, but Taka's antics were hilarious enough to save it for me. Here's hoping next week will get better, though.  <br> grown-ass man <br> being threatened by tiny nippon teens </br></br>  <br> grown-ass man <br> being threatened by tiny nippon teens <br> nippon teens with fucking super powers </br></br></br>  <br>Did you miss the part where he got trucked into a wall by the megane kid?<br><br>Dude probably lost all feeling in his legs.</br></br></br>  The new smug Queen.      I WANT TO FUCK NAO  <br>You wouldn't be able to satisfy her.</br>  I am from the future. Imouto's power is the ability to make the most delicious food anyone has ever eaten. The "incomplete" part of the ability is that the one person in the world she wants to enjoy it can't stand the taste.  <br>Was the bottom moving too fast to stitch properly?</br>  <br>Yup, and there's nothing I can do about it. <br>Also, Pringles.</br></br>  <br>You can fuck later.</br>  <br>Gradient hair, how does it work?</br>  <br>I wish the eyes and hair of almost every character were a little less absurd, they often look pretty dumb.</br>    <br>That would only enhance the experience. <br>I'd cum in her (far too quickly) while she looks on with a bored expression. She'd look down, stifle a laugh, say 'that's it?' then walk out on me while I was left crying. Bliss.</br></br>   you will never have your dick bullied by Nao and Misa <br><br> Misa will never possess Yusa in the middle of her eating something, suck your dick, then switch back to Yusa </br></br>  Does anyone have the production/setting art of the back view of the female characters? I am trying to figure out the school uniform for replicating my own.  <br>how has Nabisco not sued them</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>Oh yes, thanks for the stitches man.</br>  <br> can control fire with no drawbacks <br><br>Why is her power so broken?</br></br></br>  This is a K-9, right?  <br> with no drawbacks <br> can't even roast marshmallows </br></br>  <br>It's a bitch.</br>  <br><br>Just 2 bitches sittin'</br></br>  <br>Was that supposed to be Misa from before she died? Or was it still Yusa?</br>  <br>I believe the ending sequences was actually a PV to promote Yusa's song or something.</br>  Gonna need a webm of based speedbro worshipping his idoru.  <br>Let's go, pal.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Why are keybros so always best?</br>  The second half of the episode was rushed as fuck  <br> no drawbacks <br>Being dead is a pretty big drawback.</br></br>  <br>What's with this Nao irony meme?</br>    <br>Apocalypse end confirmed.<br> Ready to fuck some shit up? </br></br>  But will Yusa ever get an actual personality of her own?  <br>The less personality she has, the hotter it is to fuck her when she's possessed by Misa.<br><br>It's like being jerked off by a ghost using a human fleshlight.</br></br></br>  The real question is, will Charlotte get a VN?  <br>Its not a meme, its a fact.</br>  <br>She's an idol, of course her personality is all fake.</br>  <br>Traveling with Misa sounds comfy.
