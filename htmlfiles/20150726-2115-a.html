Liking a shitty anti-hero who can't even save everyone   <br>Had the boy really inherited the dream of his foolish father, he would probably begin an endless lament and experience a bottomless despair.<br><br>But he would definitely be able to recall the self that existed at this moment as long as he remembered this night. He would remember this heart his young self had; this heart which was fearless, unknown to sorrow, and full of aspirations.<br><br>That would also be – the salvation that Kiritsugu, who had lost himself without knowing and had been ground down by time little by little, had hoped for.<br><br>“Yes. Ahh – then I’ll be at peace now.”<br><br>Even if Shirō walks the same path as him, he would never become the same man.<br><br>All the scars in his heart seemed to have healed when he understood this. Emiya Kiritsugu closed his eyes.<br><br><br>Then –<br><br>This man who accomplished nothing in his life and did not win a single victory stopped breathing. His last moments were full of relief, and he passed away as if he had merely fallen asleep.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've always wondered what exactly Shirou did after realizing his dad just died right there on the porch.</br>  <br>Better image, OP. No DEEN.</br>  <br>the red man always wins</br>  <br>How would Kerry react to finding out that Extra Archer basically did the same things he did?</br>  <br>Well, I don't like him so you're wrong.<br> <br>I love him though.</br> </br></br>  COUNTRYMEN!<br><br>Who amoung you would fight and die for your king?</br></br>   33 years old <br> has a job <br> pays for his hobby <br> knows what's important in life <br> doesn't cower in fear <br>Is he the hero we've all been waiting for?</br></br></br></br></br>  He's literally me.  <br> implying you know what it's like to be GOAT </br>  He's a Gary Stu.  <br> 20 years old <br> Has a job <br> Mecha otaku who now actually pilots mecha <br> Generally has her priorities straight <br> Doesn't back down no matter how hopeless the situation is or how deep the fear runs <br> Is a qt3.14 tomboy <br>We've had better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   getting BTFO this hard   <br>Maybe he doesn't know, because he has a sense of humility and doesn't flaunt about how great he is.</br>  <br> Her <br>Already inferior</br></br>  <br>I think you mean 'already superior'.</br>  <br>no, that's not a typo</br>  As much as I hate his otaku hijinks, having an actual adult MC sure is a breath of fresh air.  <br>I don't see what there is to dislike about a tomboy police mech pilot.</br>  Before this manga I thought the JSDF was like the reserves. I'm still not sure what they do exactly. But I don't think they're like the reserves anymore.<br>Also if nippon's rank structure is like ours being 33 and only a lieutenant is fucking awful. He'd litterally be the lowest ranked officer after however long he's be in the JSDF</br>  <br>The JSDF is the defacto military of Japan. Right now, they make stern faces at China.</br>  <br> Also if nippon's rank structure is like ours being 33 and only a lieutenant is fucking awful. He'd litterally be the lowest ranked officer after however long he's be in the JSDF <br>It is outright stated that Itami avoids getting promoted. But the Ginza incident is the spark that forced him into ever weirder situations that he didn't ask for or want.</br></br>  <br> being 33 and only a lieutenant is fucking awful <br>Do note, he's a consummate underachiever. He's probably actively avioded promotions before the start of the series</br></br>  <br>You forgot<br> Exwife </br></br>  <br><br>Most of the time you get promoted out of lieutenant for having a pulse. That's why it's so surprising to me.  In the American rank structure anyways. </br></br>  <br>He only cares about his hobby</br>  <br> nippon's rank structure is like ours being 33 and only a lieutenant is fucking awful <br>Depends on the age he joined and like say the US Marines, a slot to a next-tier of promotion may never actually open up because you don't have enough promotion points or whatever.<br><br>Also the JSDF is not in the business of pushing away any person they can get, they can barely recruit as it is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a Ranger and ex special forces if that counts for anything.</br>  <br>Japan's SDF recruitment adds are hilariously awful as it is. Just look at their infamous 'Seamen Ship' Japan Maritime SDF ad<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nNd<wbr>PPEwguDQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>he was place there so the rest of the SF candidates don't slack off</br>  <br> Do note, he's a consummate underachiever. <br>As if he couldn't be more gary stu</br></br>  <br>He's old enough to be my dad. Are you looking for a father figure OP?</br>  <br>So he still completed the training, or are you saying that they just hand out Ranger badges to anyone even if they don't have the skills.</br>  <br> Citation needed </br>  <br> Most of the time you get promoted out of lieutenant for having a pulse. <br>But could they force you into a promotion? Surely if for some bizarre reason, they offer you a promotion but you don't accept it, they have no reason to push it right? Itami was happy with his duties and his salary, he has not interested in moving up any further in the ranks. If he actively avoids a promotion I am sure he could avoid it. But of course, he got promoted by force due to politics after Ginza.</br></br>  How will moe Yanagida be able to pull this face off?  <br>he would have failed, the only reason he passed is the one in front of Itami got injured</br>  <br> So he still completed the training <br>No. He slacked off and was never found when it was time to train.<br>Infact the only reason he got where he is now is because he's BFFs with the minister of Defense after talking and recommended some manga to him.</br></br></br>  <br>I think that Itami's promotion was made public in media that it's impossible for Itami to reject promotion</br>  <br>It'll be  censored. The PoV will be from behind him, and only show the back of his head and King Amputee's reaction. </br>  <br><br>No he actually did fail multiple times but kept at it until he was able to pass, he wasn't handed jack shit because of his friend in fact the minister didn't even know that Itami was a ranger until he read his file.</br></br>  <br>Shit forgot my picture.</br>  <br>What a catchy song, seamen ship~ seamen ship~.<br><br>Also that would go great over a kancolle clip</br></br></br>  <br>There's a big difference between 'almost failed' in and 'did fail' </br>  If I wanted to watch propaganda I'd watch some pre-WWII German films.  <br>Oh shit you're right, I'm fucking retarded for having misread that.</br>  <br> 33 <br> old enough to be your dad <br>How old are you, 12?</br></br></br>  <br>Got a link.</br>  <br> Implying an officer can "keep their head down" during training </br>  <br><br>I wonder if Yanagida knows (or embraces) what kind of villain role lies ahead for him when the histories are written, particularly for his role in bilking the natives out of their mineral rights.</br></br>  <br>You think they'll censor Pina being a fujoshit as well.</br>  <br>Koshi&gt;Demo&gt;Yoshi</br>  <br>He's a hero to our side though, and it's not like the Empire would be able to use any oil they dig up anyways so they might as well let us have it.</br>  <br>Japan has sold me.<br><br>How to join the JDSF?</br></br></br>  So I don't get it, why doesn't the dad jump in the well too?  <br>Step 1: Learn Japanese. <br>Step 2: Renounce your nationality and apply to become a full citizen of grorious Nippon.<br>Step 3: Join the JDSF.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, but eventually the residents of the Special Region will find out about Molybdenum and feel justifiably slighted by the people they thought were their friends.<br><br>And the rest of the world will just see Co-Prosperity Sphere 2. The first guy to get thrown under the bus is Yanagida.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So for you to be not underage, He would have been 15 when you were born.</br>  <br> Step 2: Renounce your nationality and apply to become a full citizen of grorious Nippon. <br>Yeah... About that...<br>Even people who have some Japanese blood find that difficult.</br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't marrying a nip and living there for a few years qualify you?<br>That's how it is in most places.</br></br>  <br> knows what's important in life <br>He literally said he'd choose his hobby above all else.</br></br>  <br> Wouldn't marrying a nip and living there for a few years qualify you? <br> That's how it is in most places. <br>Japan is not "most places".<br>Seriously, they consider citizenship a privilege. An old friend of mine has a Japanese mother but he was told when turning 18 that he had to decide if he was going to renounce his Australian citizenship or get rid of his Japanese citizenship rights. Not sure which way he went.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why?<br>Anyways, how her doujisnhi circle would be called?</br></br>  <br>Iron Cock obviously.</br>  <br>Seems like he's got his priorities straight.</br>  <br>Because they already cut her threatening Duran, and her groping Hamilton.</br>  <br>neither of these are really censorships though</br>  <br>And he has the perfect loli wife for eternity<br><br>How fitting</br></br></br>  <br><br> Meta self-insert MC <br> Hero /a/ needs <br><br>This guy is the hero /a/ needs, but I'm not sure he's the one /a/ deserves.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Get that anime design out of here. Manga design or die.</br>  <br>I'll say it again: he know what's important in life.</br>  Would /k/ fuck a bunny?  <br>no,only for 40 years</br>  <br>IIE Senpai we'll be together for eternity.</br>  <br> blood pact made Itami immortal <br> she wants to take his soul after he dies <br><br>She wasn't going to let him get away that easily anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>http://www.sakura-iloe.com/kika/nat<wbr>uralization1Condition.html<br>http://www.immigrationattorney.jp/i<wbr>ndex.php?Japanese%20Citizenship<br>https://www.justlanded.com/english/<wbr>Japan/Japan-Guide/Visas-Permits/Jap<wbr>anese-citizenship</wbr></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>Don't they lose their ability to feel emotions after becoming gods?</br>  <br>Itami isn't immortal after the pact.<br>If you hit him hard enough or multiple times Rory won't be able to absorb all the damage.<br>He is tougher like a dragon but not immortal</br></br></br>  <br>I doubt seeing as how Hardy wants Rory as her wife.</br>  <br><br>Probably the author saying she'll keep her emotions even after becoming a god and spend the rest of eternity with Itami having the best romance you've ever seen</br></br>  <br>too bad the show is shit</br>  <br> not enjoying watching medieval fucks get btfod by modern weaponry </br>  <br><br>But her anime design is good. It's just as good as the manga design.</br></br>  <br>I too like her anime design, but I prefer the manga/novel dress design over the anime's.</br>  Will this be better than GBF Try and G-Reco?  <br><br><br>Also until Itami dies and Rory can have his soul all to herself, she's forced to have to 'share' Itami with a Rei clone, 2 slutty elves and fujoshit princess for now.</br></br></br>  <br> Also until Itami dies and Rory can have his soul all to herself, she's forced to have to 'share' Itami with a Rei clone, 2 slutty elves and fujoshit princess for now. <br>None of the other girls would ever even try to compete with Rory. She is a demi-god and the others revere her. Hell, the Dark Elf officially became Rory's worshipper.</br></br>  <br>Teens have sex a lot these days you know. It's very possible</br>  <br>aint nobody got time for that<br>give me a synopsis</br></br>  <br>How can a fujoshit have such a great body.</br>  <br>From what I can tell the only way it differs from most other nations is that they don't allow dual nationality so you have to renounce yours before applying for theirs.</br>  <br>She is a not roman fujoshi not a nip fujoshi</br>  Has Crunchy fixed Itami's rank? He should be a 1LT, not a 2LT.  <br>one like her? sure</br>  <br> so you have to renounce yours before applying for theirs. <br>How does that even work?<br>I'm German, and the German Grundgesetz (Basic Law) forbids any German to lose their citizenship if it meant becoming "stateless", that is, to lose all your citizenships.<br><br>I can't lose my German citizenship before getting another, so I will never be able to become eleven?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you would have to become a citizen of somewhere more lenient, drop german, then drop the new one and apply to be japanese</br>  <br>The dam Empire seems to be full of Best Girls.</br>  <br>It's nice to have a character that makes not-dumb decisions while still acting like a dork.</br>  <br>I don't think that's how it's supposed to work, my best guess is, that I will simultaneously renounce my old and gain new citizenship, everything else seems just stupid.</br>  <br>Didn't Yuuya remain an ensign for the entirety of Total Eclipse?</br>   Weebs in the military <br>How unrealistic, how would they get past the physical training?</br>  <br> Sherry grows up and becomes an old hag when she reunites with Suguwara when the gate reopens. <br><br>Still mad as fuck</br></br></br>  <br>Feel free to thank Ishihara and his supporters.</br>  <br> Implying the entry requirements are hard. <br>Come on, fatty.</br></br>  <br>You're a bit of an idiot aren't you? Having this hobby doesn't make you a physical garbage can automatically.<br><br>Not to mention, there is quite a bit of pictures with American soldiers and their anime shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably was about to. I think in the manga he gets his head wacked off before he gets the chance to drop her in.</br>  <br>Truly a land full of wonders</br>  <br>He probably dropped her in then proceeded to lure the Dragon as far away from the well as he could so that she wouldn't be burned to death.</br>  <br>Not enough guns.<br><br>If this was the American military there would not even be bodies left, just a fine paste.<br><br>Basically, Japs need to get good.<br><br>Even the goddess a shit, I'd like to see her survive a tactical nuke.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> old hag <br>Sherry is already too sexy for be a middle school girl, after 4 years she will be sexier with truly the body of a Goddess of Lust</br></br>  <br>Desert Storm was a good anime.</br>  <br> this fucking face <br>welp now I got the beetus<br>Rory really is best girl.</br></br></br>  <br>physical requirements are high only for the air force.</br>  <br> physical requirements are high only for the air force. <br>In what country.</br></br>  <br><br><br>He posted Travis, he's obviously baiting, you retards.</br></br></br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br> Is he the hero we've all been waiting for? <br><br>Yes bland MC no.15294950 is the hero we need.</br></br></br>  Since when was Lelei so crazy.  <br>she got the taste of the D</br>  <br>Her name's not Anna though.</br>  <br>This font is pretty bad.</br>  <br>Travis is the guy in the picture he took. An Otaku who becomes the #1 ranked assassin in Japan as a result of a series of killing sprees he took part in to pay off his beam saber that he spent all his money on. <br><br>Shortly put, a man who visually, and especially physically, doesn't fit the bill, but he's an otaku to the core.</br></br></br>  Would you stick your dick in crazy?  Whatever I stick my dick in becomes crazy anyway.

I won't let them have their way.</br></br>  <br>If there's two threads, and you want to combine them into one (general), why are you telling your suggestion to fuck off?</br>  <br>I think we can assume by context that this particular crazy wants to be with you for some time, likely forever.</br>  <br>Be stil my beating heart!</br>  <br>shh no dreams now<br>only rape</br></br>  <br><br>I'm too rebellious for it.

Especially the french kissing is so fucking rare outside of hentai.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It really was lewd.<br><br>But fuck. I already busted my nut to the Prisma OVA as well as the Herz episode and then this episode comes in to wreck my shit.</br></br></br>  <br>You obviously missed latest Iliya hype.</br>  <br>its really well done imo, gives the show a new direction and a lack of predicatability. i thought she was pretty boring before she became a yandere.</br>  Would you a Sophia?  <br>Obviously not.</br>  <br> i thought she was pretty boring before she became a yandere <br>It's like you didn't even watch the ED.</br></br>  <br>you know she is a slut deep down.<br>like mother like daughter<br>no exceptions</br></br></br>  <br><br>Prisma Illya wasn't lewd. It was just kissing. Nothing much.</br></br>  <br>she probably was a porn star before</br>    <br>Anyone else think this is pee or vag juice?</br>  <br><br>Yeah i know the infamous Illya kiss. But it´s still damn rare. And that´s mana transfer so i dunno if it counts.<br><br>Yanderes usually up the fun a lot. I have really high hopes for the show now.</br></br></br></br>  Would you join the resistance to go against Sophia?<br><br>I don't think there would be a more evil force imaginable that would cause males to sign up and fight against.</br></br>  <br>It´s pussy juice.

It's literally impossible for a girl to leak that much out of her vagina.</br></br></br>  <br>How would you even go to the bathroom in that? And wouldn´t that completely wipe out sex? Not very clever for a country to stop all procreation.</br>  <br><br> sweaty dick riding  <br> vacuum suction action asshole <br> post-coital flop on the bed, heavy panting and we're both sweaty as hell <br> followed by a nice relaxing soak in the bathtub listening to soft music </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yandere just means sick with love.

Even if you're a pleb who thinks yandere have to be violent, she's got lust fueled super strength.</br>  <br>You missed a "Pshht, nothing personal kid" and it was perfect</br>  <br>I dunno, she leaks a lot. Not exactly expecting a lot of realism here. Also explains why she loses more "juice" after she gets rid of the panties.</br>  <br>You guys noticing how this story sort of hits a lot of the same beats as KLK?<br>SOX=Nudisto Beach<br>Okuma=Senketsu<br>Kajou "Blue Snow"=Ryuko<br>Saotome=Nonon <br>Gouriki "Gorilla"=Gamagoori <br>Anna Nishikinomiya=Satsuki Kiryuin<br>Sophia Nishikinomiya=Ragyo Kiryuin<br>Plus it takes the themes of KLK and somehow makes them even less subtle.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hah.</br>    <br>I´m ok with her being all over him.

How many days have you been here?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Like some anon said. <br>She can talk the talk but not walk the walk.</br></br>  Yoshino-sensei is really this lewd...  <br>Your god and hell are not exist, you religious cocktail sucker. Fap to whatever you can.</br>  <br>She's all talk, can only spout lewd memes</br>  <br>Well done anon.</br>  <br>Some people like saying racist jokes and wearing black face, but they get quiet when there's a black guy in the room.</br>  <br>do it go in?</br>    <br>because she's a /b/ tier memster, should have noticed</br>  LNfags, does she get violent and murderous later on or does she stay harmlessly lewd?  <br>3DPD</br>  I am just glad there was someone there to watch the MC and actually tell them not to puss out on this opportunity.  <br>I was actually pretty surprised to see her react like this. I thought she´d go "Oh so that´s what it actually looks like." but she went full on disgusted. I like Anna more that her now. Can´t halfass the lewd.</br>    <br>They're all definitely virgins but maybe she only reacts that way to MC's dick.</br>  <br>Sadly no. Just some straddling. She didn´t know how to use it. Which isn´t surprising, really.<br><br>I´m surprised she knew about french kissing though. Maybe kissing isn´t considered lewd?</br></br></br>  <br>http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/<wbr>210638-remote-control-device-releas<wbr>es-drugs-right-into-the-brain</wbr></wbr></br>  <br> That Vagina Juice <br><br>Damn, the animators must've been diamon hard the entire time they were drawing.</br></br></br>  <br>He's a big guy.</br>  <br> I´m surprised she knew about french kissing though. Maybe kissing isn´t considered lewd? <br>Didn't she get kissed before?</br></br>  <br>Toradora got lewd.</br>  <br>I think it comes from the fact that these kids are still a product of there generation. She has never seen real sex before and part of MC really wants to be pure for his lewd waifu. SOX is just as naive as ever one else when it come to the real thing, it is just that the main members know how to explain things.</br>  <br>for you</br>  <br>Japanese trip fall kisses don't count.</br>  <br>She dons the knife already in the preview. I don´t think it´ll get really dark though. This is a comedy after all.</br>  <br><br>Yeah I think she liked when their lips met earlier and now she is just a lust beast so she is all over him with her mouth.</br></br>  <br>Frenching is instinct but kisses per se wouldn't be considered lewd, else parents couldn't kiss their children and vice versa</br>  Pixiv isn't as active as I thought it would be for this series.  I don't wanna stick it in anything else.  We finally saw the eel thing but when will the dog mascot show up?  <br>YOU MOTHERFUCKER</br>  <br><br>Yea it was probably her instincts just wanting more. She IS in puberty in addition to all of this after all.<br><br> I actually like lewd making out more than actual sex. Fuck yea frenching. Too bad i see it so rarely outside of hentai. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Kind of like a nun giving sex education.</br>    <br> beginning of the episode makes it seem like they're glossing over the kiss to make way for 8 more episodes of status quo <br> episode ends with a rape <br>Holy shit.</br></br></br>  I would stick it in like crazy, but just like MC I don't love her anymore.  <br>ahaha<br>ahaHAHAHAHAHAHA<br>ok</br></br></br>  <br>You can't rape the willing.<br>A woman can't rape a man in Japan.</br></br>  What was with her logic at the end, repressing everyone even more was meant to make MC hornier?  Which one is the uncensored ones? Hiryuu or Clawhammer?  <br>I can see it happening here in Britain. They've pretty much done everything else, ISPs now record every website you go to for example.</br>  <br>Both<br><br>There was no penetration so i think it falls under sexual harassment.</br></br></br>  <br>She's so sexually repressed that she doesn't realize what she did was extremely lewd, she thought it was just love being expressed. <br><br>So her solution is to ban all other lewdness (swears porno mags and whatnot) so her "Love" is the only thing that persists.</br></br></br>  <br>Both, since they use the AT-X raw.</br>  <br>i hear you guys need a tv license<br>if you buy a tv you need to buy the license too.<br><br>you guys are insane.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't really think so.<br>Imagine a little girl who doesn't know what a penis is. She wouldn't have any reaction to something she knows.<br><br>Kajo knows what a dick is compared to Anna who knows nothing. If Anna knew what dicks were in the first place she would be disgusted.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I still like her. It´s not her fault she got brainwashed. She needs to be set straight though or it will only get worse.</br>  <br> If Anna knew what dicks were in the first place she would be disgusted. </br>  <br>But Anna only wants to "celebrate her love"(sex even though she doesn´t know it) with Tanakuchi. And a penis is basically made for "love" (sex) so i don´t really think she would see it as disgusting even if she knew its actual function.</br>  <br>The license fee funds the BBC.<br><br>You don't need to pay it if you don't watch TV, just home video</br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks.</br></br>  <br><br>fuck off</br></br>  <br>Hiryuu has the best script and typesetting though. But you'll need to wait a few more days for their release.</br>  My dick is literally diamonds.<br><br>Jesus fuck.</br></br>  <br>post the rest</br>  <br> Episode 5 will be out by the time they sub episode 4. </br>  <br>Why is it it's always the "purest" girls that always turn out to be the sluttiest?</br>  <br>Because they literally have no concept of sex and love.</br>  <br> borderline <br>fuck off she's a slut</br></br>  <br>Repressed Sexuality.</br>  <br>They said they have already started working on episode 4. And the reason why their episode 3 was really late was their editor had his finals.</br>  <br>Enhances the effect, what's so unpredictable about a slut getting sluttier?</br>  <br> vlc </br>  <br>He has a pretty shitty school if he finals are in July.</br>  <br>This is easily the anime i hype the most this season. Let´s hope it stays good and doesn´t fall off.<br><br>The entire scene is in </br></br></br>  <br>The Japanese are already going extinct. Might as well speed it up.</br>  <br>It's always the fucking final regardless of time of the year.</br>  <br>Would that mean that anything that was already crazy would go sane again from your dick?</br>  <br>Because your standards are stupidly wrong in the first place.</br>  So we all agree that yanderes are the best?  <br>This is something that would literally cause a person to blow themselves up for and I wouldn't blame them.</br>  <br>No, it would get worse.</br>  <br><br>Doesn't really matter to me if they're late since they have the best release among other groups.</br></br>  <br>Man, I'm so conflicted on who is hotter.<br><br>I would say Kajo with glasses and braids &gt; Anna &gt; Saotome &gt; Sophia &gt; Kajo with hair down.<br><br><br>Kind of does because I'm America and I want to watch things yesterday.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>underrated post</br>  <br>God the faggot MC's whimpering was so annoying.</br>  <br>What would you be saying if a mystery girl broke into your house in the middle of the night to rape you?</br>  <br>Take it like a man.</br>  <br>I'd be crying because my dream came true. Not only that, but she wasn't a fatty. Though Anna has some sweet Annas.</br>  <br>about time</br>  <br>To be fair it was pretty retarded to leave the door open at night with a letter of invitation pinned to it. Could have been some actually dangerous stalker (male or female) with a weapon.</br>  <br>What are they doing showing someone's crotch in front of hundreds of innocent high schoolers.<br>Do they even think of the children?</br></br>  <br> vacuum suction action asshole <br>What?<br>That sounds like something NASA would develop if they were interested in fucktoys.</br></br></br>  <br>With the force of a thousand suns.</br>  <br> Kind of does because I'm America <br>I don't give two fucks what Murrica wants.</br></br>  <br> personal <br>Nigga u fucked it up.</br></br>  <br>To be fair after that bill passes they won´t have schools for long anymore since no one gets pregnant ever.</br>  <br> typical stupid reaction <br>after this she can't be the best girl, NEVER</br></br>  <br>Literally a body made for sex</br>  <br> yet those hips will never get pounded </br>  <br>If it becomes reality we just make SOX.</br>  i hope mizuryu kei is watching this  <br>And so I squirt<br>Unlimited Juice Works!</br></br>  <br>Yeah they won´t show straight-up sex in the show. But last episode was extremely close. Like  Boku Girl chapter 55  close.</br>  <br>Them's fightin' words anon.<br>I want you out of my country by tomorrow.<br> inb4 I live in some socialist shithole. <br>Every country in the world belongs to America.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course it isn't, anon. This is a Christian imageboard, of Presbyterian denomination. No Catholic devil pedophiles here.</br>  <br>She's already fallen off the deep end, I don't think it's possible.<br><br><br>Her parent's vaguely told her about love in general so when she finds out that penises are lewd she might kill herself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Anna is already leaving enough "juice" on the ground.</br>  <br>Racist jokes are in full productivity nowadays, too. Maybe that's the intention.</br>  Yes, yes I would.  <br>Ironically, Britain is in chaos now.</br>  <br>Why do you namefag? What's the purpose of it?</br>  <br>It´s kinda sad she got brainwashed so much. She was always such a sweet girl who cared for others regardless of who they were.</br>  I just "came" across this on pixiv.  <br>Is it recent? Damn, that was fast.</br>  <br>There's a lot going on in that picture.<br><br><br>She's not going to kill herself. She's crazy. She's going to rationalize it by proving since they fit in each other, that's how true love is formed. <br><br> Which is correct. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  What's this from? I don't see it in any of the novel scans I have on my computer.  <br> Every country in the world belongs to America <br> Couldn't win Korean and Vietnam wars <br> Couldn't win against ISIS <br>You couldn't own anything even it was hanging under your nutsack you autistic cunt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Meant for </br>  Yeah but THIS is the crazy I want to "combine" with.  To fuck a crazy one you have to become more crazy than she is. Yes even if that means to fuck her peehole.  <br>She's not really crazy though.</br>  <br> She´s crazy <br>I wouldn´t even say that. She is suffering from a critical lack of information. Combine that with a rush of hormones due to her being repressed sexually and it´s no wonder she goes commando.</br></br>  <br>She is just ignorant like anna but more calm.</br>  <br>No, the sickest thing is that she is so wet that it actually seeps right through.</br>  <br>I got them off /a/, don´t really know the exact source.<br><br><br>I also don´t think she´s crazy. Just very curious and EXTREMELY nosy. Just because she´s ruthless in her methods doesn´t mean she´s crazy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's absolutely nothing wrong being sexually aroused to the one she loves/lusts for.</br>  <br> insulting the greatest country on earth. <br> calling another anon autistic. <br>Hold your horses there anon. You didn't thank DARPA for allowing you to shitpost like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Well she didn´t shlick ever and got extremely aroused. It´s not a realistic amount of pussy juice anyway.</br>  <br>I want to stick my dick between her tits.<br><br>Eh, it kind of makes her a little crazy. She's overreacting and has a complete warped view of the world.<br><br><br>No, but there's something wrong with your vagina if it salivates at the same rate a hungry bear does in front of a steak.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> greatest country on earth <br> can't even give own citizens proper health care <br> uses a a completely autistic two party system to govern <br>I can call you whatever and whenever I want you dumb faggot. Now BTFO and and cry back home to /pol/</br></br></br></br>  Crazy is nothing a good hard dicking can't fix.  <br> can't even give own citizens proper health care <br> implying the country was founded on handouts unlike the eurocucks. <br> uses a a completely autistic two party system to govern <br>I actually have nothing for this because I have no idea what country you're from, but you probably elect like retards.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a reason why they say don't stick it in them</br>   barely kissed a guy by chance <br> now her vigina is leaking Niagara Falls 24/7 <br><br>This is the worst society in fiction history.</br></br></br>  Neat, I just noticed that Fuwa has been talking about matsutake (mushrooms) all this time instead of cucumbers.<br>Nice dub script, Funimation.</br>  <br>She's been repressed her entire life.</br>  <br>I don't know about him, but I look like this, so it makes sense.</br>  <br> being too embarassed to mention your own country. <br> insulting Americans on a board created by an American. <br>Got any more anon. You haven't mentioned our crime rate yet, or how our military spending is more than most countries GDPs combined.</br></br></br>  <br>So have I, but I don't leave cum everywhere I go. Just some of the time.</br>  <br>They´re just jealous they don´t get the crazy V.</br>  <br>The music that plays whenever she appears, I need to know it's genre. It sounds so atmospheric and cool.</br>  So is she actually legit insane or does it just seem like it because she has no idea of how to actually express love?  <br> you probably elect like retards <br>Says the autistic cunt who has only 2 retarded choices whom to vote for as their country's leader. Please faggot don't go full retard.</br></br>  <br>Actually, I have many choice, but then again you still fail to mention your country so for all I know you are literally a shitposter from PutinLand.</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>The latter. It´s sad really. She got brainwashed and repressed by her parents and the society they created.</br>  <br> our military spending is more than most countries GDPs combined. <br><br>Is that supposed to be a good thing? just asking</br></br></br>  <br><br>bro, the land of the free and home of the brave has many choices. I can even vote for myself on the ballot. Freedom</br></br>  <br>You can masturbate, she can't.</br>  <br>You're just not trying hard enough.</br>  <br>The last 5 minutes of that episode have me really liking her parents for repressing her sexually and turning her into a semen demon</br>  <br>YES. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD YES. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</br>  <br>It's still not normal, no matter how many years you go without sex/physical contact or whatever. Unless you got some uncommon issues.</br>  <br>That is why people send pictures of American dicks to young mangakas so they know what it looks like outside of the mosaic.</br>  <br>This and<br><br> <br>You know what masturbation is, she doesn't.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She has such little understanding of sex and love that she interprets her lust as true love and doesn't even know that they're impure.</br>  <br> europoors in charge of knowing how the electoral college works. <br>Besides, the reason why everyone gives a shit about the presidency is because that person is essentially the ruler of the free world.<br><br>I guess it's both but the context i was hoping to use it for was to give that anon some more bait to throw out.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you gay, son? Do you not like vagina juice?</br></br>  <br>Honestly, upon rewatching the scene, as hot as it is, the music combined with Tanukichu's voice acting actually makes it kind of unsettling.</br>  Crazy people are the best at sex.<br>This is a fact.</br>  <br>It is a good thing, but Eurocucks get upset about it all the time. I wonder who will save them from China.</br>  <br>No it isn't a good thing. But we like "liberating" people and flying bombs through their windows so what can you do.</br>  No One for President<br><br>Libertarian/Volutaryist here</br></br>  <br>Well yea I do.<br><br>But I don't like that shit if that bitch stepped into my house and I have to wash everything that slut sits or walks over.</br></br></br>  <br>Underage b&amp;.</br>  <br>I would thank the god that it wasn't a male rapist.</br>  <br>I like yanderes and i like the way this anime is going. I just think it´s sad since i like her as a character. She´s not a bad person.<br><br>Well she did take advantage of him there. Hard. And at first he thought it was a stranger tying him up.</br></br></br>  <br> serf here </br>  <br>How is middle school going?</br>  <br><br> iku </br></br>  <br> Bitching about having to clean vagina juice from a girl who wants to give you pure sex filled love. <br><br>Seriously, m8, you gay.</br></br></br>  So let me get this shit straight. Anna actually came into mail envelopes and sent that shit to the MC? This isn't a slut. This is a demon from another world.  <br><br>Get out</br></br>  <br>how is does it feel being ruled by someone? How does it feel that having government steal on your behalf at gunpoint? You must feel very moral</br>  <br>Wow nice.<br><br><br>Yeah hardly any pixiv activity for this series unlike hestia or sento. Whats the name of that other girl by the way? The one with blonde and red glasses and huge tits?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It´s called a yandere. And she´s kinda tame in that regard. She doesn´t even know what that liquid was. She thought it was an expression of love.</br>  <br>The fact that it didn't dry by the next day and Koja couldn't figure out what it was immediately shows that she has super vaginal juices and Koja a prude.</br>  <br><br>How's somalia going?</br></br>  <br> Kajo is prude <br>Well yeah. Her reaction to Tanukichi´s "seal" was obvious enough.</br></br>  <br>This image needs to stop get posted, the art is fucking shit.<br><br>SHIT.</br></br></br>  <br>What is the government exactly stealing from me? My money? The money that goes into my retirement, my healthcare, my roads, my infrastructure, or whatever?<br><br>I'm confused. Like really confused. It's like you're implying that I don't want the police, firemen, or EMTs to show up at my house when I'm in need.</br></br></br>  <br>your mom is shit</br>  <br>not this misconception again. Somalia is not a voluntary society its ruled by authoritarian warlords who don't care about you freedom and property.<br><br>Stop fucking using strawman somalia</br></br></br>  <br>Poor Kajo. Can make fun of dicks all day long, but can't handle them when they're waving around her face.</br>  <br>Technically we elect people who vote on our behalf that have limited terms.<br>We're not being strictly ruled by anyone, and can change our constitution if enough votes are gathered.</br></br>  <br>He's probably one of those Ayn Rand-larpers. Give it a time, we've all been through that phase when we were young.</br>  <br>It's almost like any society that doesn't have a structure eventually turns into a land ruled by authoritarian warlords.<br><br>kek.</br></br></br>  <br>How's it like getting raped and roped every time you steps out of the house?</br>  <br>Yeah, not really thinking thats drool either.</br>  <br><br>I finally understand what someone said earlier by so pure they're lewd and the other being so lewd they're pure. Kajo best girl</br></br>  <br>Well judging by the shadow Tanukichi has a pretty large member. Maybe she got scared. But i really expected more of her of all people.</br>  <br>Go back to /d/ or deviantart with your garbage faggot art.<br><br>Ultimately, just kill yourself.</br></br></br>   memepolitics <br><br>stop fags no one cares about your meme country on the animu board.</br></br>  <br>The OP already showed us that he has a giant dick.<br><br><br> meme </br></br></br></br>  <br>Well he's implied to have a huge dick in the OP too</br>  <br>I dunno , Kajo should really be more resistant to seeing a single dick. I mean she wants to take down the PMC.</br>  <br>shit belong on /int/ and /pol/ and you know it.</br>  <br>just wait for the doujin, anon</br>  <br>Do you look to the future of easy NTR?<br>I do.</br></br>  <br>That's the process of adaptation<br><br>Probably because mushrooms are too short to associate with dicks except the head.</br></br></br>  <br> ¡ay dios mio! </br>  <br>Now that I think about it, MC is FUCKED right? And no i'm not making a joke about rape.<br><br>He literally wrote "I LOVE YOU TOO" in his door.<br>Anna might as well think they're married considering she's insane</br></br></br></br>  <br>Imagine if it was Goriki instead.</br>  <br>America was insulted so of course there was going to be shitflinging.<br>If you don't defend your country no matter where you are, then what does that say about your country?</br></br>  <br> goes out to find male equivalent of the "love" leaking out of her <br> found by mob of faceless men <br> typical gangbang + mind break scenario ending with her covered in semen and drooling <br> last page shows faceless men shriveled and exhausted, she gets up and continues her quest for more pure love essence so she doesn't run out before she gets tani </br></br></br></br>  <br>"Wait, where are those stains?"<br>And then realization hit.<br>Is this what being locked away for an entire life while being kept in the dark from lewd does to a woman? Holy shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Drink bleach</br>    <br>Yeah that was a horrible idea. And not only because of Anna. Why would he leave the door open? The stalker could have been a guy with a knife. Or a burglar could just walk in and stab him after robbing him.<br><br>But yeah, MC gave a yandere pretty much free reign.</br></br></br>   Character voiced by both KanaHana and Sugita <br><br>How can one show be so based?</br></br>    Never forget, Hajime is always right.<br>Praise the name of our Gatcha and savior ssu~</br>  <br>O.D. looks like all his dreams have been shattered in this frame.</br>   3 Gel threads at the same time <br><br>I guess I'll post in all of them.</br></br>  <br>I love Sugita but am I the only one that thought he was really off this episode?</br>  I feel so bad for Rui. He spent all of s1 harassed by a weird alien and terrified of using Crowds. He finally gains enough confidence by the finale to save everyone, only for his teammates to shit on his work on national television as soon as he is out of commission.   Sugita will GERURURURU <br>I'm not ready.</br>  <br> his teammates <br>No, just one cunt.</br></br>  Why does he show his bellybutton? Is it supposed to mean that he want to get pregnant?  <br>Only the new ones did that, the others discussed it in private. It's funny how Tsubasa keeps saying the others don't want to be heroes and all they do is talk high and mighty when it's obvious she and Gel are the ones  alien ating themselves from the group by spending more time with Millione than with them and hiding their agenda. I bet Sugane and Hajime would go and help out clean the streets if she told them about it but she kept it to herself because the truth is she thinks she cares more about people than they do. She's just a hypocrite with a hero complex attitude.</br>   handsome red alien can turn into the cutest red alien loli <br> voiced by HanaKana and Sugita <br>Living the fucking dream.<br>I just hope this won't stop the loli doujins.</br></br></br>  <br> loli <br><br>Anon...</br></br></br>  <br>It's always male.</br>  The doujins<br><br>Jesus Christ IMAGINE THE DOUJINS WE WILL GET  never translated </br></br>  <br><br>Well shit, the small form is a shota?<br>Slightly disappointed, but it will have to do. Bring on the shota age-changing doujins.</br></br></br>  <br>If OD isn't even male despite being half human then there's nothing wrong with doubting Gel-kun's pants situation for now</br>  <br> Male Gerururu about to rape Hajime. <br> Katze takes over Hajime and rapes male Gerururu until he goes loli. <br>I don't even know if this is gay or not.</br></br></br>  <br> this denial. </br>  feelsbad.jpg  <br>I like it, anon. <br>I like it a lot.</br></br>  <br>Denial of what? This show has already set a precedent of aliens defying gender norms. A degree of DOUBT is fair game.</br>   Is conflict bad? <br> Of course! &lt; doesn't explain why, it's bad just because &gt; <br> But sometimes it's necessary. <br> Are you saying it's okay for people to get hurt? <br> missing the point completely, doesn't even try to understand <br><br> I couldn't let Rui die! There's nothing more important than life! <br> Is there really? <br> No! &lt; doesn't even think about what Hajime is saying &gt; <br> But you don't know if Rui thinks that. <br> So I should have let him die? &lt; missing the point again &gt; <br> That's not what I mean &lt; actually has to explain it over &gt; <br><br>How dense is this chick? Jesus. Shonen protags are geniuses next to her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's only gay if balls GATCHA~ssu</br>  <br> Rhythm starts fucking loli Gel <br> half way through and filled with lust and curiosity for human sex loli Gel gets two meters tall, grows a giant red cock and rapes him back </br></br>  What about smoky Gel? Is it male? Can it grow a smoke cock?  <br> getting raped by an aircock <br>II KUUKI DA NE</br></br>  So basically, Katze is a massive troll and Rizumin is a low tier shitposter jelly of how many upvotes Rui got?  <br><br>to be fair, Tsubasa is a teenage girl with fireworks on the brain. She was never all that bright and I think when Joe started on about 2:6:2 she understood immediately she's not part of the 20% of smart people he's imagining.<br><br>My main concern with Tsubasa is that she doesn't really try and listen, but then I suppose Hajime doesn't exactly explain herself very well either. It's just how the show likes to work and to some extent I can't hate her because you've got to think a little to follow her.</br></br></br></br>   wants to boost alien's popularity <br> wants to get rid of the only voice of reason in the show so that alien and newcomer can say all the barbaric things they feel like <br><br>Host faggot is suspicious as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He's thinking about dems ratings. Nothing more to it then greed. OD is getting old.</br></br>  <br>Katze is the ancientfag troll master. Rizumin is the dumb newfag shitposter. Hajime is the cold-blooded genki admin. Tsubasa is the fresh-off-tumblr janiturd who tries desperately to fit in and uphold their juvenile sense of justice.</br>  <br>He's just the run of the mill sleazy businessman with no morals. He'll come back in the end when everything's going haywire and he'll understand how wrong he was.</br>  <br><br>The teenage excuse doesn't really work because she's just one year younger than Hajime when she started. But yeah, she's obviously not very smart. It's getting old really fast though. I can watch a goofy not very smart lead that gets shit done but a not very smart nosy lead thinking she's hot shit? Not so much.</br></br>  <br> OD is getting old. <br>Well, yeah. Nigga's 300 years old</br></br>  oh shit nigger its habbening,<br>evil loli gender bender overlord.<br><br>also, <br>1 season and 4 episodes, and i still can't figure out what hajimessszu is thinking.</br></br></br></br>    Why doesn't Rui just ban the red crowds users from using crowds?  <br>Now I'm remembering the thread we were talking about which board every character was. Tsubasa being tumblr fits perfectly.</br>  <br>Rizumu controls the red crowds, not Rui.<br>Duh.</br></br>  <br>ohi, we found another lower 20%.</br>  <br>I don't care what you say, guys. I'm going to fuck this no matter what surprises await me between those legs.</br>  <br>please don't make this a new meme.</br>  <br>He has no control over them as he wasn't the one that gave the red CROWDS users the ability to materialize. Both Rui and Rizumu have the ability to make CROWDS.</br>  <br>He doesn't control them, Rui only controls the blue crowds. Rizumin has a note with the same power as Rui's. The red crowds were created with Rizumin's power.</br>  <br>Go away joe.</br>  why is Katze scared of gerururu so much?  <br><br><br><br>So why doesn't Rui just eat Rizumu's heart? That's what the gays do, isn't it?</br></br></br></br>  <br> not jou <br><br><br> rui <br> gay <br><br>weve been over this countless times, hes not gay</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you and fuck Joe, I didn't say they couldn't use CROWDS.</br>  <br> I was just pretending to be the lower 20%! </br>  <br>Except OD is male<br><br>and Katze has insulted him with the Japanese version of "fag" before, so he is just gay</br></br></br>  <br><br>Hijime is meant to be different though. They haven't really gotten around to explaining Hajime yet and I really hope they give us more then hints this time.<br><br>Tsubasa is more typical of her age but obviously Gatchaman is playing it up to 11 in order to push the plot. It's going to be delicious drinking her tears when shit hits the ban and Gel goes too far.<br><br>That aside I really want to hear more about Hajime's past, or at least understand her more. If they just pass over it again vaguely hinting at something more I'm going to get annoyed. Maybe the disaster everyone alludes to in season 1 is at the core of it and she's sort of a rebuilt person. That is, she broke then found a way to move on. Who knows, but I want to know more.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gelsadra is SRS</br>  <br>Doesn't quite beat a character voiced by both Chiwa Saito and Jouji Nakata.</br>  <br> I'm the upper 20%! </br>  did gerururu genderbend from a loli or was he a shota this whole time?  <br>because he'll go full no-fun-allowed fascist after he becomes the prime minister</br>  <br>Katze likes people to suffer and conflict. Geruru wants sadness to go away and no conflict.</br>  <br>Gerururu is the literal opposite of Katze?</br>  <br>Shota all day every day.</br>  <br>He was always a shota.</br>  <br>Tsubasa is more normal(pretty retarded), Hajime is pretty abnormal because she is more wise than most adults in the show.</br>  <br>An okama is not the same thing as a gay man.</br>  <br>Geruru was a cloud of smoke the whole time, it can genderbend in whatever it wants.</br>  <br>He was trying to get there but then tumblr showed up.</br>   Geruru is the opposite of Katze <br> Geruru goes fascist, goes too far, must be stopped <br> Can only be stopped by Katze <br> Katze comes back </br></br></br>  <br>man this is show is so SJW.</br>  <br> hes not gay <br> Rui <br> Not gay. </br></br></br>  So Gel is definitely final boss. Her ideals don't work with the individualistic values of human society<br><br>Also this show is gay as fuck</br></br>  <br>  implying this isn't the only path the anime is headed. <br><br>well done anon</br></br></br>  <br>going by original gatcha logic, she was a loli</br>    <br>so he's gay just because he cross dresses?<br>he's gay because hes beautiful? even then most girls?<br><br>Rui hasn't done anything that qualifies him as gay yet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It'll happen  in the next Rui rape doujin <br><br><br> Katze coming back <br> mfw <br><br><br>Ironically, the big bad is the SJW who hates any conflict and wants no fun allowed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I like Hajime more as a side character.<br>I personally like my protagonists with some flaws that lead to character growth instead of an always right autist.</br>  <br> Katze comes back <br>I want this so much.</br></br>  <br> tumblr <br>speaking of the devil</br></br>  <br>Shut the fuck up you FSN babies.</br>  <br>I always thought the disaster they mentioned in the first season was the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. I really want to know more about Hajime too, and the Ichinose family as well. People in the offline meeting said she didn't look like one. The fact that the mayor knew about them means they must be an important family.</br>  <br>is male sugita geruru's final form?</br>  <br>Well yeah, remember how Hajime brought the team together in S1?</br>  <br>Why the fuck would you post a crappy tumblr image when I've been spanning this for weeks?</br>  <br>Well I was joking but you're right though. Jou comes off more gay then anyone else.</br>  <br>Because Gel is the anti-Katze. Absolute calmness versus absolute chaos. That and he probably cares about Hajime more than he likes to admit.</br>  <br>why did they cut Katze's hair?<br>did Nisio have a hand in this?</br></br>  <br>I don't even watch FSN, less projecting please.</br>  <br>Getting stuffed into a pair of boobs doesn't leave a lot of room for hair.</br>  <br>By reuniting with them at the cage and suggesting they should go out in the open and give an interview, then explained why. What about it?</br>  <br>what am i suppose to see in the ????</br>  <br> why did they cut Katze's hair? <br>I don't know, maybe because Hajime's main weapon is SCISSORS.<br>He's Hajime's bitch now.</br></br></br>  <br>I must be the only one that likes Katze more with short hair.</br>  <br>the fact that HIS (I just wrote her again) shoes and head don't match with the shadow</br>  <br>The closest is translation is drag queen<br><br>And the official site describes Gel's forms as "boy form" and "young man form" so is setting male as its official gender</br></br></br>  <br>but their Hajimesssus tits, theres plenty of room and their still growing<br><br>mfw: gatchaman S3.</br></br></br>  <br><br>She's asserting dominance</br></br>  <br>Watch the director's cut from season 1<br><br><br>If you're gonna crossdress for some nonhomosexual reason (hiding identity I guess?), why dress as rapebait? I only know one reason. <br><br><br>I hope his hair grows back out.<br><br><br>We can only hope.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  why dress as rapebait? I only know one reason.  <br>if I had thighs like Rui I would also show them off.<br>it's about sharing your beauty with others anon.</br></br></br>  This season is on its way in surpassing the first one.<br>Better animation, a tighter plot, and more interesting themes make it a lot more fun to watch</br>  <br>Gatchaman is literally saving anime while being lgbt/sjw friendly.<br>everyone wins.</br></br>  <br>I keep thinking she cut his hair because it was hiding his eyes. It's easier to read someone when you look into their eyes, know what I mean? And they're so interesting too, they shouldn't be hidden. Plus, long hair like that really gives you a heavy vibe. Short hair would look cuter.</br>  <br>I agree. I have to say that watching it with /a/ and getting to argue with everyone makes for about 50% of my enjoyment! (The other half is Rui suffering)</br>  <br>I want his long hair back so, so much, but will take at least five years for it to grow back, unless he uses some kind of alien magic. (providing Hajime lets him) Maybe he should start roaming 2ch to speed up the process.</br>  <br><br>Fucking dropped, hopes and dreams were shattered</br></br>  <br> that hajime <br><br>The healthiest.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget all the new music.</br>  <br><br>I like the short hair</br></br>  <br>She has to eat for two now...</br>  <br>I have a creeping suspicion that the majority of anti-Hajime posts are from landwhales and fujoshit.</br>  <br>  those hajimes brushing up against the floor. </br>  <br> &gt;Is conflict bad? <br> &gt;Of course! &lt; doesn't explain why, it's bad just because &gt; <br> &gt;But sometimes it's necessary. <br> Doesn't give examples. <br> &gt;Are you saying it's okay for people to get hurt? <br> &gt;missing the point completely, doesn't even try to understand <br><br> &gt;I couldn't let Rui die! There's nothing more important than life! <br> &gt;Is there really? <br> Doesn't give examples. <br> &gt;No! &lt; doesn't even think about what Hajime is saying &gt; <br> &gt;But you don't know if Rui thinks that. <br> Why should she give a shit ? <br> &gt;So I should have let him die? &lt; missing the point again &gt; <br> &gt;That's not what I mean &lt; actually has to explain it over &gt; <br> For the first time tell what she think and not nonsense bullshit <br><br>It's like she doesn't want to be understood.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is Tsubasa even asking if she's 2 or 6? She's not even using CROWDS...  <br>They're the Tsubasa defense force which is basically tumblr.</br>  <br>she's calling jou out on his elitism.</br>  <br>There was regular bitching about Hajime throughout S1 as well, though.</br>  <br> fujoshit <br>Fujos like Rui right? Then they should be on Hajime's side since she, Sugane and OD were the only ones defending him. Everyone else shat on his hopes and dreams.</br></br>  <br> you can't give a power like CROWDS to everyone <br> but giving a power like being a Gatchaman to a dumbass like Tsubasa is fine </br></br>  <br>He even walks like a bitch though. Don't tell me you don't think he's asking for it.<br><br><br>If Katze being absorbed can make Hajime's hajimes a cup size bigger, I'm sure he can grow his hair in no time.<br><br>But more importantly, if Katze were to be freed would that make Hajime's hajimes go back down a size?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you shouldn't group people like that joe-san.<br>I like Rui and Hajimessu, I only hate Tsubasa.<br><br>but she is supposed to be hated.<br>so they did good.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He even walks like a bitch though. <br>it's part of his disguise, hes really convincing though.<br>you don't see him doing any of that on his on time with X.</br></br></br>  <br>  Nah, I was there looking for scans and I just found the most DELIRIOUS post on how it was transphobic or something of Hajime to suggest that maybe Tsubasa should have given Rui a bit more time.  </br>  <br>Is it really a disguise when he's completely open with his identity and goes on TV?</br>  <br>So it was a guy all along?</br>  <br>Tumblr already existed back then.</br>  <br>no she gender bent.</br>  <br>In his defense it's difficult to not walk like a bitch with those heels. Try it out sometime but make sure no one is around or you'll get a boner for feeling like a slut.</br>  <br><br>I coulda sworn the subs always referred Gel-Chan as a she until this episode.</br></br>  <br>Either ways, the show is way too gay for me to follow anymore, this is /lgbt/ the animation.</br>  <br>its ok anon, come back when you're ready.</br>  <br>What the fuck. Is there a joke about Rui being an independent strong woman I'm missing?</br>  <br><br>How new are you to anime?</br></br>  <br>If you genuinely wanted to disguise yourself, why would you dress in flashy attention grabbing clothing? <br><br><br>In the first season, it was a "disguise" as it was only revealed online in the show that Rui was Load Galax, which resulted in him being called a pervert. Now, it's kind of just obvious why he really does it. <br><br><br>I swear the threshold for tumblr getting offended gets lower every day.<br><br><br> I already do </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They did because the translators fell for the oldest trap of assuming a gender with pronouns instead of keeping it ambiguous.</br>  <br>so he does it out of habit, doesn't make him gay though.</br>  <br>I'm sure X has hours of security camera footage of Rui wanking in drag.</br>  <br> I already do <br>Walk in high heels or get a boner in public?</br></br>  <br>Hardly.<br>If one show has traps and okama, chances are that's not a girl to begin with.</br></br>  <br><br>This is very very farfetched, but couldn't it be part of his "everyone should do something to improve the world" ideal? <br>If you had the potential to look that cute when dressing up wouldn't it be your responsibility to make the world a little bit more beautiful?</br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of cute things!</br>  <br>DAY 1 PREORDER<br>A<br>Y<br>1</br></br></br></br>   no nationality restrictions for the most important person leading a country <br><br>Never mind Tama (RIP), who the hell thought this was a good idea?</br></br>  <br>Nice! I hope the others get them too but I'm taking these for now.</br>  <br>He just likes dressing like a girl. Nothing strange about that, just unusual to be open about it.</br>  <br><br>New as your mom is to my dick.</br></br>  <br>Does blushing from getting kissed by a dude qualify as not gay? I don't think so.<br><br><br> Walk in heels you dingus <br><br><br> If you had the potential to look that cute when dressing up wouldn't it be your responsibility to make the world a little bit more beautiful? <br>I don't owe anybody anything. Also, I don't see how that requires dressing like a slut. He does it because he likes the attention and being fap fodder. <br><br><br>They live in the world with aliens and homoerotic superheroes and characters that can confuse the straightest of dicks. Do you think something like that is supposed to make sense?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>any virgin would blush from being kissed by anyone</br>  <br>Any virgin would-- yeah, what he said.</br>  <br> Sugane <br> defending him <br><br>He really wasn't. He was just defending his own ideals of a hero</br></br></br></br>  I know the first season had a remake or something...was there anything added to the TV version? Like who's red and blue alien? Not that it's necessary, just curious in case I missed something.  <br> Does blushing from getting kissed by a dude qualify as not gay? <br><br>Do you really think he enjoyed getting kissed by Katze out of all people. That was a surprise reaction</br></br></br>  <br>That was about Tsubasa disobeying orders to save Rui. Later in the cave when Joe was saying CROWDS were dangerous Sugane said public voting would be better than banning CROWDS just like that. He didn't fully agree with Joe on that one, I'd say that counts as defending CROWDS and therefore Rui.</br>  <br><br>what</br></br>  <br>Miyano will make any and every one blush.</br>  <br>But landwhales love Hajime because they are convinced that she's fat like them. Google Hajimessu cosplay, they are all fat chicks.</br>  <br>Yeah sorry, my english is terrible. Just, did I miss something if I only watched the TV version of the first season? Was there anything added in the BD version or some special?</br>   I don't like the new battle themes. The old ones were a lot better.   <br>Watch the director's cut version of the last episode.</br>  <br>There's a directors cut version of the last episode that needs to be watched. <br><br>Other than that, just episode 0 of season 2, then season 2.</br></br></br>   A politician who knows EXACTLY what people wants at any giving moment <br><br>The most dangerous fucking thing that ever happened to democracy.</br></br>  <br>Yes. You should download episode 13 (also known as Episode 12 Director's Cut) and watch it right now.<br>There's also Insight episode 00 if you missed it.</br></br>  <br>Aw fuck I missed ep 0. Thanks for spoonfeeding.</br>  <br>I think the institution of democracy can be saved if all seats were single term, and all politicians were eaten at the conclusion of the term.</br>  would Joe be pro gun control?  <br>Need more of Rui's  rui .</br>  <br><br><br>Ok fine. Then tell me what straight guy ever tells another guy that his katana is cute? <br><br><br>I can't argue that. <br><br><br> mfw <br><br><br>Are you kidding me? The song playing in the beginning of today's episode was awesome. <br><br><br> /pol/ incarnate aka green hitler being pro gun control <br>no</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only correct decision.</br>  <br>Democracy only needs one thing from the politicians to work flawlessly: selflessness. Incidentally that's the least likely trait to find in a politician. It's a flawed system from the get-go because it is in human nature to become greedier with more power. The only exceptions are the very few examples you can find in history books, selfless leaders that only cared about their country and people above all else, even above themselves. Those examples improved their country in a few decades more than the following leaders could ever improve in centuries.</br>  <br> appreciating the beauty of a katana is something only gay men can do <br>Katanas are love. Katanas are life. No homo.</br></br>  <br> Are you kidding me? <br> No, I'm not. I don't like the action themes this season, specially the one that played at the beginning of today's episode. </br></br>  <br>To remove his anonymity. He can no longer be the invisible internet troll he used to be.</br>  http://strawpoll.me/5026844/  <br>I don't think that you become greedier with more power, it's just that greedy people are the ones who seek and ultimately attain power. <br><br>The way democracy works in the present, only sociopathic and greedy liars get to compete for the top spots, since anyone with an ounce of decency wouldn't be able to get enough support from the easily manipulable masses</br></br></br>  <br>Does that mean it's straight to sheath your katana in Rui's scabbard? <br><br><br>What was your favorite from the first season then?</br></br></br></br>  Bullied Katze is kind of adorable.  I haven't watched the first season of this.<br><br>In all honesty, is it any good?<br><br>My taste is pretty plebby.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He was just being polite<br><br>The fact that he called it cute proves that he had no idea how to react to Sugane's katana otaku ways</br></br></br>    <br>Watch 3 episodes, decide if you want to see more.</br>  <br>To have competent patriots as leaders is an ideal scenario which is hardly achivable the moment democracy becomes a popularity contest. An argentinian intelectual once said that a nation could not be democratic if it was not educated,"to educate the Ruler", something that seems nigh impossible though.</br>  <br>There's no way that's straight, some of them bend near the end. Each katana has its own scabbard and Rui doesn't even own a katana. Just use yours, anon.</br>  <br><br>Inter-species doujins when?<br><br>I am fine with whichever form of Gel is used</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh my god</br>  <br>Not his best series but worth watching.</br>  ost when  So Gel-chan is the villain right? I feel like specifically allowing aliens to run in an election is going to come back to bite Japan.<br><br>This season is great it's building up so many interesting ideas.</br></br>  <br>Watch the first episode. If you like Hajime, then continue on. If you don't, then stop. Rest of the series is basically Hajime being Hajime and Katze being Katze.</br>  <br><br>Alright, I'll give it a try.<br><br>Thanks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He is the Katze of this season, only instead of being right out evil, he doesn't know what he is doing is wrong, which is much worse</br>  <br>You will either love it or hate it, at this point. <br><br>If you have seen any of the original Gatchaman/G-Force/Eagle Riders/Battle of the Planets, don't dive in expecting anything like what was just mentioned.</br></br></br>  <br> I am fine with whichever form of Gel is used <br><br>First one and then the other would be best.</br></br></br>  Well shit. I guess that if Gel went man mode to run for prime minister, it means she's going to stay that way for a while.<br>I'll miss my cute red alien lolishota of mysterious gender.</br>  <br>Gotchaman, Music goes on, Fat guitar and Hydra for the action-ish themes but I really like the first season soundtrack as a whole, OP and ED included. The second season's so far as been underwhelming in comparison but going by the threads I'm the only one that thinks this way.</br>  <br>Gel-chan is less a villain and more the antagonist. Crowds isn't particular about good versus evil but more of different ideals clashing with one another. Although I do hope they're not going to end up with another alien shoved into someone's boobs.</br>  <br> doujin starts out with some classic /ss/ of Tsubasa dominating Gel <br> Half-way through he goes into his grown up version and the tables get turned </br></br>  <br>  Although I do hope they're not going to end up with another alien shoved into someone's boobs. <br>You are alone in this regard.</br></br>  <br>They can put Gel-chan into Rui's chest. Katze made Hajime's boobs bigger, and Rui needs boobs.</br>  <br> Katze travels from planet to planet, causing chaos <br> Hajime is the only one that can understand him <br> she traps him on her boobs so he won't get away and cause more chaos <br><br> Gel travels from planet to planet, brainwashing everyone until fake peace is obtained <br> Tsubasa is the only one that can understand him <br> she traps him on her boobs so he won't get away and brainwash more people <br><br>Not very interesting but I can see it. If only they had a better character instead of Tumblrasa.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you implying he needs boobs? Why do you think most models are DFC? More outfits fit you that way</br>  <br><br>Holy shit the possibilities.</br></br>  <br> Tsubasa is the only one that can understand him <br>Tsubasa is a dope. She questions nothing and supports tangification.</br></br>  <br>That's just more proof to the contrary. Rui is a slut.<br><br><br> l-lewd <br><br><br>I loved the ED of the first season. I especially loved how it faded in as the episode was wrapping up, especially when an episode ended on a cliffhanger. The second season ED is somewhat lacking though. I do love the OSTs of both though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She can understand the mindset of a 4 year old somewhat decently. She says she understands Gel perfectly but not the others.</br>  <br> Although I do hope they're not going to end up with another alien shoved into someone's boobs. <br>I hope we get alien dicks shoved in pussies.</br></br>  <br>You're being too harsh on Tsubasa. It's clear she's being set up to take a fall later on, so I plan on holding off on any criticism about her until her character development is finished with the inevitable redemption arc.</br>  Goddammit, I forgot this season already started.<br><br>Please tell me there's no more Rui suffering.</br></br>  <br>That's a retarded fucking pairing. They haven't even interacted this season</br>  <br>This anon.</br>  <br> I especially loved how it faded in as the episode was wrapping up <br>Me too. I could almost hear it this episode when Tsubasa was setting up the phone but something else came instead.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128598725 <br> Tsubasa accidentally exposes herself in public <br> Gel absorbs all their lewd desires and fucks Tsubasa </br></br>  <br>Much more rui suffering in the first 4 episodes than all the rui suffering in the last season.</br>  I-I don't know guys, Gel remained too cute and cuddly even after growing up (and holy shit that soft Sugita voice, please stop trying to make me more gay). I'll continue believing she's a girl who can turn into a man at will until the character designs posts a picture of her gigantic red cock in loli mode on the internet while saying we're all gay for lusting after little boys.  <br> They can put Gel-chan into Rui's chest. Katze made Hajime's boobs bigger, and Rui needs boobs. <br> implying it will make Rui's boobs larger <br> implying it won't make Rui's rui larger </br></br></br>  <br>They indeed write themselves.</br>  <br>Sorry man, I hate hypocrites and I can't control it. I honestly doubt she'll change much, her character is all about acting on impulse without thinking of the consequences and being the irresponsible teenager of the team. She's great to make Hajime's character become clearer though since many kept saying Hajime made random impulsive choices without thinking it through. Now we have an actual example of what would happen if that was true.</br>  Tsubasa is fucking annoying.<br><br>We need less of her and more of the original Gatcha group.</br></br>  <br><br>Looks at these shotafags, so desperate for her to be a boy.</br></br>  <br>Stage 1 - Denial</br>  <br> no more Rui suffering </br>  It bothers me that the villains are well intentioned, and that OD is too powerful to do anything but sit around and watch.  <br>It's from Sugane Note, an LN set up to be like Sugane's diary or something. I hate the pairing too, don't worry.  Rui's ruirui belongs to Katze as so amply demonstrated in numerous doujinshi <br><br><br>I wonder if we'll ever hear it again  perhaps in the finale? <br><br><br>First season Rui suffering was hotter though.  that scene triggered so many fetishes in me </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wanna be fucked by older Gel.  <br>This. I wanted to see more of where we left of, Hajime learning more about Katze and he learning more about her, OD opening up about what happened at his planet, Sugane becoming a drunk, Joe... doing things, I guess, Rui being accepted in the team, Utsutsu making cute bows for everyone, Paiman actually growing into a fine leaner, JJ being more relevant. All of it was swept under the rug for Tsubasa and so far it has been a waste of time. Geruru has potential and would be fine as a friend that turned into a villain but Tsubasa was unnecessary when we had a cast that was about to develop. Everyone downgraded back to the first episode of the first season too, it's fucking annoying.</br>  I miss Katze's long fluffy hair  <br>I may need source for the full pic, anon.</br>  <br> being in this much denial </br>  <br> this was a boy <br>I can't.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't activating his power kill them though? Or had he gotten over that now?</br>  <br>Anon, it's only episode 4. You've seen enough anime to know all the 'pride before the fall' tropes being thrown around in this episode. Considering the point of the last season was about understanding, I can't possibly see how all of this isn't to set her up to learn a lesson. The fact that she has a grandfather with the same emotional condition as Hajime is the biggest sign of future character development. <br><br>Yes, she is impulsive now, but that's to be expected. She just become a nationally celebrated hero overnight and had moved from the countryside to the city. It was evident from her near-worship of her grandfather's status that she places heroes on an incredibly high pedestal. She expects heroes to be able to save everyone, which is consistent with what we are shown about her. Once, she receives the inevitable pep talk from her grandfather and tone down her hero-worship, she's going to come out as a much better person.</br></br></br>  Gatchaman S2 is going to end up like Dog Days S3.  <br>Yeah, activating his power above ground would probably cause way too many casualties</br>  <br>I think OD is fucked from the time he fought Katze</br>  <br>Nose Bleeding, Honest Ruirui is so Cute<br> Google can do the rest .</br></br>  This VAPE guy has got to be planning some Zero Requiem type shit where he drives everyone further into Rui's ideology, otherwise his actions are just stupid and irrational.  <br>Pretty sure Utsusu healed him up but it's not worth the risk to have him transform.<br><br>Which is really a fucking waste of his character, imo. It worked as a good climax against Katze but now it just makes OD even more useless.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I meant that the fight Katze fucked up his ability to control his powers</br>  Is OD the only reasonable Gatchaman? They talk like Crowds invented terrorism.    <br>S2 Joe went full retard for some unexplained reason</br>  <br>I hate shota, but it was obvious it's a boy. There was never any mention of genderbending, and we already know this show features many gay elements, so no rason to think it was a girl.</br>  <br> implying it just started this season </br>  <br>There are certain things that are too dangerous though. Hence why guns are banned in any decent country.</br>  <br>Also, that line from OD reminded me of the scene in S1 where two people get ran over by a car and then Joe goes to the site of the accident to leave some flowers. <br><br>Maybe it was banter.</br></br></br>  <br>Joe has always been the cynical one, and considering he works in politics, his 2:6:2 line was very much in character for him.</br>  <br>I'm glad I dropped this shit.</br>  <br>Precisely because I watched the last season is why I know she just won't change that much. Consider Rui for example. He stopped being afraid of using his power and got more allies but it didn't change who he is. He's still naive and believes in everyone just like he did back then, his ideals didn't change one bit. The same thing will happen to Tsubasa. The only difference here is that she won't lecture everyone anymore out of shame of her own blunders but she'll still do whatever she feels like doing in the end because that's the kind of character she is.</br>   that cool BGM at the beginning of the episode <br>Shit, they did it again.</br>  <br> Let's try to stop people who don't give a shit about the law by making laws against them <br><br>I remember some statistics that related more people having guns to less people using them for crimes. Even if you ban guns, if people are going to use them for crime, they'll still be able to get them. Only the regular people won't be able to defend themselves.</br></br></br>  <br>He tries to but kids these day won't listen.</br>  <br>Same here.</br>  <br>He's always been cynical.</br>  I should know better than to let /a/ influence my opinion of something. Couldn't watch the episode until late tonight so I was "watching" vicariously through you guys. Made it sound way worse than it was.  <br>Yeah but Americans suffer from high casualties due to guns because all the people with guns are too trigger happy.<br><br>So in that case banning guns would be a blessing.</br></br></br>  <br>Or rather, to phrase that differently, everyone having a gun is a deterrent for people to use guns as a means to have power over other people, which is what an armed robber does.</br>  <br>First week, I take it?</br>  <br>How does banning law-abiding citizens from owning guns stop CRIMINALS from committing CRIMES with ILLEGAL guns?</br>  <br>Americans shouldn't be used as an example to anything.</br>  <br> Trusting humans to always act logically with guns <br>Yeah that's working swell got burgerland, country with one of the highest if not the highest gun related crimes. Mute point anon.</br></br>  <br>Been here since 2013 lurking and only posting in Crowds threads. Obviously I learned nothing. Shame on me.</br>  <br>It makes it 100x harder for your average criminal to get a gun, hence why gun crime is so low in countries where guns are banned.</br>  <br>Thank you anon  tags are always played straight and i always forget to check, how much nose bleeding ruirui could be out there? </br>  <br>You are right. They're an extreme example and not the average.  But still as someone who lives in America and nearly getting shot twice it annoys me.  <br><br><br>Less guns means its harder to get guns. Crimes with guns will still happen, but there will be less of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In some countries anyone can own a gun. That means you can have your neighbor walking up to your door with a shotgun and shoot you and your girlfriend in bed because you were making a racket without giving you enough time to find your own gun. I get what you're saying but some countries are the perfect example of why CROWDS would be a real problem in our society. Just because there's a gun permit law it doesn't mean law abiding citizens have enough time to get it or even carry one with them. However it makes it easier for criminals to get their hands on them and span even more criminals because of it. Either make gun carry, firing skill and mental aptitude checks compulsory or ban it's use, I think those are the only options.</br>  <br>Everyone having guns only changes the dynamics of crime. Crime won't stop, but criminals will be more trigger happy and so will be the cops, because comitting any crime will be a life threatening situation.</br>  <br>Except that's bullshit. Rui wasn't afraid of his powers, he was afraid of the abuse of it. He had been planning since his introduction on using his Crowds power. His flaw from S1 had been trust. He didn't trust anyone, hence why he was constantly switching out members of the core Crowds team. He learned to trust in others from Hajime and the others and fully released Crowds to the public. And not just Rui, but other members of the Gatcha force had changed as well. This was evident in the original episode 12. THEY ALL FUCKING STATED HOW THEY CHANGED! Seriously, it seems like the hate is less about Tsubasa herself but more about how she isn't BFF with/isn't like Hajime.</br>   gun control faggots posting on /a/ <br>Alright, I'm done for the night. Fuck all of you, don't forget to bin those knives, etc.</br>  <br>You should change country or state. It's not too late.</br>  I thought I wanted more Joe this season, but I realize I wanted him to be where Rui is.  <br>You know you can print guns now, right?</br>  <br> nearly getting shot twice it <br><br>In what kind of nigger neighborhood do you live? I been here for 12 years and never even had a gun pointed at me</br></br></br>  <br>You're only upset because you lost your argument.</br>  CROWDS S1 was Ramayana<br><br>CROWDS S2 is Mahabharata<br><br>The Mahabharata was the first Hindu text to introduce the concept of ahimsa (no harm). It does so in the develop the idea of a "just war", essentially defining when it is acceptable to kill others.<br><br>The core story of the Mahabharata centers around a throne feud between two princes from different trees of the same royal family. Initially, a split was negotiated between the two kingdoms. However, the Kaurava family challenged the Pandava family to a series of dice games (with loaded dice). Through the games, the Pandava lost everything and were exiled.<br><br>13 years later, Pandava returns to retake his kingdom and each prince organizes an alliance of kingdoms to fight on his side. Prior relationships (familial, trade, etc.) between members of each alliance complicate the conflict and result in former allies pitted against each other.<br><br>The sides start the Kurukshetra by rigidly adhering to their idealistic and chivalrous notions of warfare. However, the notion of ahimsa is broken down as the each sides inflicts greater atrocities on each other fueling a negative feedback loop. Ultimately, the Pandava prevail. <br><br>The election is the dice game. Gel will "load the dice" by brainwashing the electorate, Tsubasa will ally with Gel. The other Gatchaman will be exiled from Gel's new society (Gatchaman aren't need without conflict). The final war will be fought between CROWDs and those red/white/blue things.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And instead of gun crimes, they just have huge spikes in non-gun crimes. If someone wants a gun, they'll get it. It is absurd to think the lack of availability will deter the black market somehow.</br>  I fucking knew Gel-chan was a cute shota. Thank you Tatsunoko.  <br>http://www.forbes.com/sites/larrybe<wbr>ll/2013/05/14/disarming-realities-a<wbr>s-gun-sales-soar-gun-crimes-plummet<wbr>/<br><br><br>I think most criminals, not all, but most, only do it because they can get away with it. Sure, some are desperate enough that they'd do it regardless of the odds, but it'd deter a big amount. The ones who wouldn't get deterred are probably already killing people, so it's not like they're going to be affected.</br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>But you also need effective law enforcement, otherwise you leave law abiding citizens to the good mercy of criminals who will eventually get guns in the boomings black markets.</br>  <br>Many, if not most, illegal guns are stolen from people who purchased them lawfully. Owning guns actually makes you more likely to be the target of robbery, since guns have such a high street value.</br>  <br>The first was my grandpa. He thought someone was in the house robbing him despite having seen me in there earlier.<br><br>The other was a friends house. That one he should have known better than to mess with the gun. Thankfully it only hit his TV.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think a 3D printer can actually print out a mechanical gun just like that. Plus 3D printers cost an arm and a leg, your average person wouldn't be able to buy such a thing.</br>  <br>That fan art is so fucking dumb considering what actually happened this episode</br>  Gun control would never work in America because of the culture here surrounding them.<br><br>Anyways, I think the show is commenting on technologies more ambiguous in destructive power unlike guns.</br></br>  <br>That sounds more like you surround yourself with fucking retards than anything. Take your liberal horseshit back to tumblr or Reddit.</br>  <br>I hate her because she's a hypocrite, I said it from the beginning. I don't need to explain in detail because I already did more than once today. She's compared with Hajime because Tsubasa is exactly how everyone describe Hajime most of the time so now that a character like that showed up comparisons are inevitable. And all the character changes were irrelevant after episode 12 except Rui because none of those characters matter anymore to showcase a character like Tsubasa. Do you really need me to draw you a picture of why she gets so much hate? Deal with it. You're starting to sound like her because you refuse to understand why people don't like her.</br>  <br>Or my Grandpa forgot. Because he forgot I was there.<br><br>Thankfully he doesn't mess with his guns as mcuh these days.  Also I was ten when it happened and that was eleven or so years ago. </br></br></br>  <br>I don't think I meant no guns = no crimes, people will still be able to get guns but it'll be significantly lower. And it's not necessarily a case of if they "want" more so that if they're able to. You can want a gun as much as you want but if you don't have the suitable means you won't be getting anywhere with that.</br>  <br>They can, and they are not that expensive.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_pr<wbr>inted_firearms<br>http://www.3ders.org/pricecompare/3<wbr>dprinters/</wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> This is a boy <br><br>Of course, I should have learned my lesson that high heel in gatchaman crowd means jack shit to gender.</br></br></br>  <br>Fujos gotta fujo.</br>  <br>Europe is doing good.</br>  Gel-kun fucking Tsubasa doujins when.  <br>The only female character in this show that wears high heels is Usutsu</br>  <br>What the fuck am I reading?</br>  <br>High heels are like the walking shoes of space. If Pai Pai was bigger, he'd probably wear them too.</br>  <br>Sounds pretty cool</br>  <br>Pai isn't a real man with a backbone, he'd never wear heels.</br>  <br>I just got to watch the episode and I was honestly expecting him to be as pathetic as /a/ was making him, but while he's pathetic I can see where he's coming from with the ordeal. It's just hilarious because he's 30 and acting like a 13 y/o edgemaster.</br>  <br> Utsutsu <br> female <br> implying <br>You know I'm convinced at this point it's a he.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They are still quite expensive though, being able to print one doesn't change the fact that it's still illegal.</br>  <br>That's slippery slope and you know it.</br>  <br>Not to mention that the benefit of crowds isn't just defending yourself, it actually gets shit done in society. Less reason to ban it, more reason to suspect the retards who want it banned.<br><br>It's pretty curious that the show actually displays the politician as having hope in the people and taking a rational side to it. Pretty opposite to the average depiction of a politician in these kind of shows.</br></br></br>  <br>That's right, the only actual girl is hajime and even then her sentient boobs blur the lines</br>  <br> I hate her because she's a hypocrite <br>i guess you hate all humans as well you edgy motherfucker. Don't forget to add yourself to that hate fest because you're just as hypocritical as she is.</br></br>  <br>I'll choose to place my faith in her vagina bones. I WANT TO BELIEVE</br>  So you are telling me that Katze, OD and even JJ were probably all loli-looking shotas at some point  Prior to this episode, was lewd Gel art drawing her as a shota or a loli?  The entire show is built on Crowds concept first. Gatchaman was shoehorned later to promote the movie, but the show was originally called Crowds and it's bigger on the title.<br><br>Is everyone even doubting the end result won't be CROWDS ARE GOOD?</br></br>  <br>Control yourself. You have to be at least 12 years old to use this site.</br>  <br>Guns are weapons.<br><br>Crowds aren't. <br><br>Besides X moderates it perfectly. Vape shit isn't moderated because it's by Rizumu.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just checked Pixiv, and there's no nude ones, and one picture with budding breasts.</br>  I want X to become a Gatchaman.  <br>There was a fanart of human X and Rui.</br>  <br>Katze, OD, and JJ are not part of Gel-kun's race.</br>  <br>So, in the end, you believe no one can change because you refuse to accept the character changes and thus you can hate her because you believe she won't change. At this point, I don't think the problem lies with her now.</br>  <br>In S1, Hajime played the role of Rama, the protagonist within the Ramayana and the seventh avatar of Vishnu.<br><br>In S2, I think Hajime plays the role of Krishna, the eighth avatar of Vishnu. In the Mahabharata, Krishna acts as a third-party observer who recognizes the atrocities committed and makes no attempt to prevent them. Hence, the comments encouraging conflict.</br></br></br>  <br>Explain the chain tattoo-thing then!</br>  <br>Gelsadra has squares, Katze has diamonds.</br>  <br>Hajime is reasonable too, although everyone around her is too stupid to understand her shit.</br>  <br> implying I'm a minority and that the problem isn't with her <br>Whatever makes you feel more comfortable at night.</br></br>  <br> this is a boy <br>Fucking Gatchaman has some serious issues.</br></br>  <br> next week when we get OP with boy mode Gel Sadra </br>  <br>If they're willing to get a gun through illegal means, I highly doubt they care about having the suitable means anymore. If they are resolute in getting a gun illegally, they are most likely going to commit a crime with or without a gun. I don't think people realize that if someone is adamant about killing someone else, they will most likely succeed. The main problem has always been the getting away part. Honestly, as history has shown, we have managed to kill each other/commit crimes just fine before guns were invented.</br>  <br>I don't care anymore. I'm going to fap to those red legs and there's nothing you can do about it.</br>  <br>Rui's whose wife this time?</br>  <br>I'm not arguing about your dislike of her, I'm arguing on your fallacious point that she won't change because you refuse to accept the idea of character development.</br>  <br>Kinako would be proud. I think.</br>  <br>I think there's a reason we don't even see those this season.</br>  <br>Isn't it obvious she'll change? I'm more worried about Joe who keeps being the same old.</br>    <br>I wonder if she can use katze's gatcha.</br>  <br>That's what I've been arguing about with the other anon the whole time.<br><br>As for Joe, well, he's older and has always been shown as the cynical one. Just because he learned to trust his team doesn't mean he has learned to trust society as a whole. He works for a politician, I'll be surprised if he wasn't overly critical of them.</br></br></br>  <br>Special gatcha gattai finale.</br>  Why don't they tell the public that the YACK aren't CROWDS? And that they come from an entirely separate unmoderated source? And no amount of CROWDS control will stop them?  Hajime is the cult leader of Gatchaman threads in the same way that Shirou is the cultleader of FSN and Touma is the cultleader of Index.<br><br>You only like her because she always wins and is always right.</br></br>  <br>How is it fallacious to dislike her for what she is at her core? I swear you have Tsubasa's reading comprehension and are shoving things I didn't write in my posts just like she puts words in Hajime's mouth. I doubt the redemption that's in store for her will change my opinion because what I dislike in her is the very base of her character and changing that would make her into a completely different character. You're trying to change goalposts in here because I refuse to agree with you that she might change into something I might like and yet you refuse to accept I might still dislike the outcome because I have a strong dislike for the very root of her character. Do you see the irony of the situation here? You need to learn how to deal with people not sharing your opinion instead of forcing what you think is right down their throats.</br>  <br>Because she's cute and always wins. Get it right.</br>  <br>Katze's creeping corruption of a suit crawling up Hajime's body, dissolving and consuming her G-suit, giving her a taste how sweet another's misfortune is, how hot can it make her body, and how can it tingle on her tongue. That would be too good to be true.</br>  <br>Joe doesn't really have a problem with his teammates. He has a problem with himself and that was resolved on the first season. <br><br><br>I like Jou, I think his bitching keeps the show interesting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or because she and Shirou are actual good characters that aren't one dimensional.<br><br>I don't have idea about Touma though.</br></br></br>  <br>And there is literally nothing wrong about that.</br>  Do you guys think Katze used to be like Hajime?  <br>But I like Hajime because she's a good character that's interesting to follow.</br>  <br>You'd need a metal sintering printer to make metal parts. They cost around $200k-$1mil depending what you want.<br><br>Barrels I wouldn't think could be printed well. A 7mm hammer forging machine would set you back another 2.5mil. Then there's several other machines to finish the barrel if you want them to last.<br><br>So for 4-5million and 30000sq ft of space, you can print guns and make proper barrels professionally.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some people find perfection annoying. It kind of reminds me of Fam from last exile and the part where she dumps her friend and the friend was like "oh I am wrong because Fam is right and I am being selfish"</br>  Never realised there's a new group shot in the OP.  <br>He was pretty on-model this episode.</br>  <br>Somehow I find Hajime to be lovable and admirable while I had a great distaste for Fam. I see where you're coming from though as both are quite static.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br> 2015 <br> having shit taste <br>Some things never change.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's hard to say since we don't know Hajime all that well. I'd say he has self-esteem issues and is an introvert. If he has any backstory maybe was bullied as a kid and no one ever understood him or his problems. JJ extracted his note, right? That means he must have seen some potential in him but then something went wrong in their team and that triggered Katze to turn him into what he is now. Maybe someone did something bad to him in there or maybe having power and a way to get payback for everyone that ever did him wrong got to his head. It looks like he has issues with his face for example. He was crying at Hajime not to look at him when she cut his hair, it's almost as if he let it grow to cover it.</br>  <br>Fucking shotacons think they have good taste, and the right to call out anyone who is not homo like them, since it's somehow "cool" or something.<br>I bet you actually got baited into watching Boku no Pico too.</br></br>  <br>MY WALLET</br>  <br> getting baited into watching Boku no Pico </br>  <br>I do have good taste and was never "baited" into watching Boku no Pico. Dropping a series over this is stupid and proves you don't have taste. Also everyone should watch Boku no Pico willingly.</br>  <br>I got to watch BNP on a stream with a bunch of dudes years ago, It was great.</br>  <br>I hated them both. But I got used to Hajime so she became more tolerable. Fam was annoying all the way to the fucking end.</br>  <br><br>As expected, gay confirmed.</br></br>  <br>The hell are you even talking about anymore. I was unaware countering your bullshit claims with facts was forcing my opinion down your throat. You had repeatedly claim the characters didn't change throughout the episodes and yet I had shown you otherwise. And now that you agree that people's change, you are saying it's either not going to be enough or too much, despite the fact that we have already had an entire season 1 to prove otherwise. The fact that you're resorting to ad-hominems in your arguments makes me wonder who's the one trying to force their opinions down other people's throat.</br>  <br> implying watching and masturbating to Boku no Pico makes you gay <br><br>Get a load of this faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe if you meme spout harder it will make falling for watching BnP somehow less gay.</br>  <br>It is a unwritten rule of /a/ to watch and fap to boku no pico at least once you newfag</br>  <br><br> he was baited into watching Boku no Pico <br>I'm laughing. Its not gay if I'm a little girl and they are wearing skirts. I just hope this is bait.</br></br></br>  <br>Not me, that's for sure. I never forced anything on you like you're "repeatedly" trying to do with me. I was only answering your replies with my own opinion on the show and even apologized for hating this kind of character so much but then you proceeded to take it as a personal offense for some reason and got really defensive about it.</br>  <br><br> newfags actually think it wasn't bait <br> homos use it as if it were ever something more and find /a/ their personal homo hugbox <br>You guys are hilarious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was bait for newfags like yourself. I'm having a good chuckle.</br>  <br> It was bait for newfags like yourself <br>But anon, I'm not the one who got baited into watching one of the biggest gay fujoshit.</br></br>  <br>I liked Hajime from the start (before the start I hated her, as I've always loved the original Gatchaman). I found and still find her open-mindedness refreshing. She's no moralfag and she's fun to watch too. Fam... damn, I can't remember what rubbed me the wrong way about her. I only remember I hated her. Giselle, Milia and even Luscinia were much more interesting.</br>  <br>I wasn't baited into watching it because it is a masterpiece. <br> gay fujoshit <br>Come on, at leat put some effort into it.</br></br></br>  <br>The target audience is fujoshi, and it is homosexual porn.<br>Now anything to counter?</br></br>  <br>But guns would allow that person to kill easier. A knife is easier to defend against.</br>  <br>Bullshit. The only thing I've been forcing down your throat is counter your refusal to admit the idea of character development. Seriously, you're the one that kept on trying to equate me and my arguments as Tsubasa's while I've been refuting your point that there were no character development for the series despite the overwhelming evidence saying otherwise. Even my original statement was asking to don't judge her too harshly since it's still early and have room for development. After that, you were somehow convinced I was trying to force you to like Tsubasa despite how my arguments were anything but.</br>  <br>I'm laughing. Nice one. <br> anything to counter? <br>The actual truth but believe what you will.</br></br></br>  <br> actual truth <br>What, that you enjoyed it alongside a few retards?<br>It is still homosexual porn for women. At least stop living in denial.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Rui is married to 2 dudes, 1 girl, 1 alien gay dude, and 1 alien bear at once.

I'm sorry you are just being informed of this now.</br>  <br> Traps and shota have male audiences and Boku no Pico's target audience was and is males <br>And tomboys and lolis have female audiences right?<br>I'm crying here, please don't make me laugh anymore, and open your eyes.

Continue to believe what you will. Google is a fun thing.</br>  <br>I'm disappointed that you think the Bocu no Pico shitposting is higher caliber bullshit.<br><br>Perhaps we should discuss Bocu no Pico in the context of the Japanese folktale Momotaro.<br><br>Pico "grandfather" is clearly too old. Where are Pico's parent? Pico didn't have parents. Instead, Pico was created by the gods and deliver to the "grandfather" in a peach that was drifting down a river. The peach is representative of Pico's virginity and the gods intended Pico to be used to unite the male spirit.<br><br>Momotaro was assisted in his mission by three animals: a dog, a monkey, and a pheasant. Together, Mokkun, Chico, and Coco represent these three animals.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>What the fuck dude.</br></br></br>  <br>You're clinging to that again even when I already explained you what I think and then you wonder why I compare you with Tsubasa. Look, this is no longer a discussion about Tsubasa, the only interest you have is clearly to show everyone how someone, that being me, didn't think too much before posting something in an anonymous imageboard. Yes, there's character development in the show but I still think it's not relevant enough to change a character completely so that it make me go from hating her to loving her. Yes, we have different opinions about what character development is. I didn't go into that because you changed goalposts halfway. And yes, your problem is that I don't accept Tsubasa's possible character development as a factor redeeming enough for me to like her presently the same way you do. That's all there is to this, I have no idea why you're still bringing this up when we both already shared our thoughts. Feel free to continue doing whatever you're doing but you're going to be doing it alone because I have zero interest in the game you're playing.</br>  <br>Gatchaman has finally driven all of us insane.</br>  <br>So Insight ends with Hajime dying?</br>  I understand the thing about having ideals like Rui but I am with Tsubasa about who gives a fuck a life is in danger regardless if you are trying to prove a point that gets you fucking killed over it.  <br>It could be that Hajime has sex appeal: big tits. Fam just seems seems like a bratty little kid with no sex appeal to make up for her shit character. <br>Not exactly, it's a combination of various traits. I don't find Yukinoshita annoying despite her excelling at everything. Then<br>again she isn't always right.</br></br></br>  Lets get some random ass alien who still doesn't even understand the many concepts and have them run for prime minster. I don't think this shit would even fly in Japan considering how xenophobic they are. But with this whole crowds voting system who the fuck cares.  <br>In the Mahabharata, Krishna doesn't die for 36 years after the conflict ends.<br><br>What you might see at the end of Insight is Hajime accepting responsibility for the conflict in parallel to Krishna accepting the curse from Gandhari.</br></br></br>  I can't fucking take Rui seriously when he is dressed up like that. If he had to cross dress at least look more dignified then some skank. Besides he looks way better in boys clothes and still passes off as a girl regardless instead of being a try hard.   Childlike idealism everywhere <br> Politics is run by retards in and out <br> Main villain is also a retard <br> Hajime's autistic ramblings are the only intelligent things that came out of anyone's mouth this season  <br>Why is Insight so fucking awful.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah. Sex appeal does nothing to me. It' her open-mindedness. Like when she suggested that those guys that wouldn't give up their seats were simply too tired. Even though she's static, Hajime is really special. I don't find it that strange she doesn't change. One's worldview doesn't change so easily.</br>  <br>How do you know he didn't have a plan? He said that she interfered, not that she helped. And also, who are you to decide what someone does with their life when you're nothing to them? If Rui wants to be a martyr to unite everyone that's his call and only concerns those close to him. Don't be that stranger holding out the hand to someone that's about to jump a building saying everything will be daijobu just because you don't want them to jump when you don't even know their story. You're only being selfish because you don't want someone else to die but you're not really thinking about what they want.</br>  <br>Because they introduced an alien and made Hana Kana voice a trap again.</br>  <br>The only way to get to Rizumu is with massive dicks</br>  <br><br>But Sugita saves it. His voice is pleseant in this role and shows off his range.</br></br>  <br>I hope that one day you'll figure out what autism is.</br>  <br> Sugita <br>Ver all over again?</br></br>  Will Hajime/Katze go Kamen Rider W at the end? Or Yugi/Atem control switching? Or Al/Hallelujah double processing?  <br>Rui is the main heroine.</br>  <br>The guy was stabbing him to death calling him an idiot and its selfish regardless. Its selfish in his regard of doing it his way. And its selfish for doing it their way. Since we are being selfish who gives a fuck if it makes Rui cry for Tsubasa helping. He can take the selfish way out later on if he is so adamant about it there is no wrong answer but what feels right to you even if it goes against what others like.</br>  <br> gel-chan is a boy  <br>got a feeling so complicated</br></br>  <br>I have a good feeling.</br>  <br>Point is, you have to understand people before you can help them for real. Otherwise you'll probably end up causing more troubles than anything.</br>  <br>No, think a really moe Raidou Kuzunoha.</br>  deep  <br>Its trouble regardless help or not it causes trouble since Rui would have probably died for his beliefs but this would cause trouble for others. But if you do save him he will upset for saving him but sometimes you have to hurt people pride in order to save them. It was a lose lose situation. Also Rui could have gone about his whole ideals in a better way instead of handing the guy his life just to prove a point that failed.</br>  <br>Can you fuck a NOTE? What would happen to its owner?</br>  <br>Rui isn't gay.</br>  <br>Either way, the message here is that you can't help anyone if you don't really understand them. Tsubasa had good intentions, but she ended up causing a lot of trouble. She still is. Her heart is in the right place, but she's too self-absorbed.</br>  <br>Hajime or OD don't think they should let him die, they just wanted to let him try to carry out his plan to avoid this massive shitstorm that's now going to happen. Tsuabasa and Gel don't understand any of this. They're just interfering without considering what their actions might cause.</br>  <br>Are aliens korean? Are they american? Are they third-world? then who cares?</br>  <br>meant for </br>  <br>they get fucked of course.</br>  <br><br><br>I don't think you understand. Rui's convinced that Rizumu would have stopped, because he believed in him. He wasn't just saving face. He meant it.</br></br></br>  <br> Not wanting shota Gel x Prime Minister of Japan Gel doujins </br>  <br>Guns have only one function. Crowds don't. That's like saying you should ban the Internet because some groups of people use it to hack bank accounts</br>  <br> skipped the god-tier OP <br>What a fucking pleb.</br></br>  <br>And he probably would, because if he killed him and no one interfered, that would have made a martyr out of Rui. That would have ruined Rizumu's plans.</br>  <br>I don't think Rui was thinking so cynically, Rui was thinking Rizumu would stop, because he isn't as bad as a person as to kill someone.</br>  Hajime is KOWAI TANOSHII.  <br> Guns have only one function. <br>Really? Better tell all those guns that have never killed anyone that they are malfunctional.</br></br>  <br>Sure. I'm just explaining way Rizumu wouldn't have killed him. That's all.</br>  Did you know more Japanese children drown in swimming pools than get killed by CROWDs?  <br>Rui has to realize not everyone is a fucking goodie goodie like him people will always abuse it even if most of them have good intentions. Rizumu is indeed smart and knows when he has proved his point and its for good but not everyone thinks like that.</br>  <br>I don't think Rui is the kind of idealist who thinks that everyone is good and we don't need to do anything to stop them. He genuinely believes in everyone and thinks that we can one day become peaceful, but he also understood the situation and knew what he was getting into.</br>  <br>I really didn't like what either of them said during this scene also Haiime really need to do a better job at explaining herself then making weird noises thinking people will get it.</br>  <br>Whyssu??</br>  <br>Guns' function isn't to kill people. It's to shoot things.<br><br>Whether it's animals or people or cans or targets is irrelevant. They only have one function. You can't use them to garden, help with debris removal, carry the sick and injured to safety, explore the world from your bedroom like CROWDS can be used for. CROWDS' function is determined by their users, they're basically an extension of their Self. You can't compare CROWDS to guns at all.</br></br></br>  <br>What part of<br><br>from my COLD DEAD SMARTPHONE HANDS<br><br>don't you understand?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Usually I'd agree but Tsubasa just doesn't want to listen to anyone. It's all wasted on her when she's trying to play the hero.</br>  THIS GUY IS SO SKETCH  <br>Girl needs a flaw bro</br>  <br>Not surprised that a talk show host with such a fake personality who lives off drama is an asshole.</br>  If you don't want a CROWDs DON'T GET A CROWDS YOU FUCKING LIBERAL COMMIES!  Katze is the hero we need to fight Gel's thought-communism.  <br><br>Anon, what the fuck are you talking about. It's obviously the conservatives who'd be afraid of the CROWDs and the new society they're bringing into being. Rui is the very definition of a liberal progressive in his ideals.</br></br>  <br>  ゲルサドラが自らの身体を大人へと変化させた姿 ("the adult form Gelsadra has changed their body into") <br>  no mention of gender change <br>IT'S OFFICIAL, HE WAS MALE ALL ALONG<br>13/10, MY GATCHAMEN</br></br></br></br>  <br>  liberal progressive <br>Is that the Yankee code for "socialism"? He obviously is lefter than the leftest possible in American mainstream. Hell, he's too much of a revolutionary even for the leftest of Democrat socialist sympathisers.</br></br>  <br> communism <br> not fascism </br></br>  <br>Crowds isn't Free-ssu. The tree of liberty and freedom gotta be litterd with the blood of Violent Apes. Rizumu HIROHITO Suzuki aka "VAPE" is not my leader-ssu. he is terrorist communist and probably irish as well :&gt; RUI and X not ruin and SEX ok. gatcha.</br>  <br>i'll probably be more   turned on   than i'd be comfortable admitting</br>  <br>OD has been around for at least 300 years, he's bound to be wiser than most people.</br>    <br>I hope you're making the appropriate image for that. Don't waste it.</br>  <br>I'm going to be disappointed if we don't get to see both eyes light up at some point.</br>  <br>Sorry, I'm not skilled enough to draw even something like that.</br>  <br>Not bad.</br>  <br><br>  quoting fucking Forbes <br>You completed your Dixie bingo, m8.</br></br></br>  <br><br> mfw in s1 I used to think Rui and Joe would look good together <br> mfw I realized Joe is a faggot </br></br></br>  <br>I think Joe is into older men. I don't know but bartender-kun knew his secret. Plus he probably gives him free drinks</br>  <br>He was male. His younger form is called "little boy form" in the character list. I fucking told you that was a man.<br><br>The cloud form was male.</br></br></br>  <br>I could have sworn he was into turning young men into alcoholics. Bring back the Katze/Rui, at least it was entertaining.</br>  <br>Joe is tsundere, he might shit talk but he was the one offering his lifeforce to heal Rui before he opened his mouth.</br>  <br>I think he just likes to mess with Sugane because he knows that Sugane has a crush on him but he probably still sees him as a kid.</br>  <br> tfw I can't unsee the ex-loli version as a shota now looking retrospectively. </br>  <br>He was probably doing it to help Utsutsu.<br><br>Sugane is so easy to rile up that I'd mess with him too. Joe is still worst Gatcha.<br><br>Oh my god, good for you, I still have to restrain from using girl pronouns.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is closest to J.J. I feel in terms of understanding, but because of that she speaks in the same way.</br>  The first episode was fucking horrible.<br><br>But it actually got better when they added better characters to the group like Chicken Legs and Big Daddy.<br><br>Anyone else not dropped this yet?</br></br></br></br>  <br>So many graves here it spells Urobochi.</br>  <br>Also I'm pretty sure Butchy added the gratuitous lesbian general.<br><br>But to be honest Lou is actually a pretty fun character too for all her edginess.<br>Nasu made a pretty generic carefree knight guy, but I think he exists to hold the group together, since everyone else is so over the top.<br><br>Also you forgot whoever it is that's playing the discriminated wolfgirl thing, who's job it seems to be to be TEH REI and add a romance subplot.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nasu made a pretty generic carefree knight guy, <br>I'm actually a bit disappointed. From the description we got before it seemed like he was unable to touch anything without triggering his curse. So his maid had to dress him and do basically everything for him.</br></br>  The setting is absolute ass.<br>Japan made an entire tabletop-rpg to further their baseless victim complex.<br><br> One day China's gonna invade us!

Croc raped the shit out of him twice but the power of plot kept reviving him so he didn't lose faith.<br><br>Zoro faced someone who should have made him completely lose his will but he was ready to die instead of give up the dream. The strongest gap luffy ever faced was Aokiji but Aokiji wasn't trying to kill him.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He's happy but not showing it. He always wanted to be a 'supa'hero, but got the supa supa and became an assassin instead. <br><br>Just like Mr. 4 wanted to be a pizza delivery boy, with the irony of his being so slow and impractical for that job.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I admit, the lines, colors and shading are very well imitated.</br>  <br>He seemed to have his ambition back after impel down. He could have wallowed away in there or escaped and went back to east blue but he immediately wanted to go to Marineford and fuck some shit up. He seems to be fine now.</br>  <br><br>He almost broke after Kuma at Shabondy, and with Ace, but was saved by 'muh nakama'</br></br>  <br>Oh shit I get it now, it's selifu<br> that's my line rayleigh ! idiot ! <br>Thank you, I would have never got it on my own.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe. After Luffy defeated him and he spent some time in Impel down, his old dreams might've been rekindled. If I remember correctly, I think he's in the New World right now with Daz Bone. He might be up to something.</br>  <br> selifu <br>wow I wasnt even close<br><br>Glad you made sense of that though. G Translate didnt know WHAT the fuck it was trying to say</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think he has faced anyone that was completely out of his league and wanted to kill him though where the only thing left was to run.<br><br>Garp wasn't going to kill him <br>Aokiji wasn't going to kill him<br>Kizaru was going to kill them but Rayleigh and Kuma saved them<br>Akainu was going to kill him but ace and whitebeard's crew saved him<br><br>He has never had his dreams utterly crushed the same way croc and moria had or been in a position where he had to face facts and say "RUNNN!"<br><br>I guess Kuma is the closest we get to that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That Law <br>Fucking disgusting</br></br>  <br><br>the dubbing was okay until luffy starting talking. jesus christ wtf were they thinking</br></br>  Why the fuck are OP dudes so much hotter than dudes in other series?

I miss having strong logia users as the main island villain<br><br>Skypiea and alabasta were my favorite arcs.</br></br>  <br>IIRC Funimation gets input from Toei on the English VAs. At the very least, all the main characters and important characters were approved by Toei. Similarly, Toei gets input from Oda on seiyuus as well, so in the end it's like Funi is getting input from Oda.<br><br>Then again, seiyuus are inherently much more used to dubbing than the majority of English VAs, considering English dubbing is a very niche job. So certain English VAs will just sound more "amateurish" than japanese seiyuus.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder what anime will be like in the united states with Naruto ending. <br><br>Seems like they would take a huge hit with no immediate successor in sight.</br></br></br>  <br>The wielder of the Jobbu Jobbu no Mi.</br>  <br>I miss the days when you weren't born.</br>  <br> IIRC Funimation gets input from Toei on the English VAs <br>Yeah, so did they for the french voices, and now we're stuck with that bad actor with a strident voice for Luffy.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9QX<wbr>yVt4h2NU</wbr>  [ ]<br>Thanks for nothing, Toei.

Sure doesn't feel like it though.</br>  <br> uffy would call it even or still be mad about what he did to vivi <br>he already forgave croc when he let him out. Luffy won't cry about it now.<br><br> but the rest of the stawhats dont know about crocodile saving ace, and saving luffy twice <br>If luffy says to let him be, they will.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends of the circumstances. It will probably play out just like when Robin joined though, so I'm looking forward to it.<br>Also<br> robin and crocodile having a nice, somewhat corrosive but leisurely chat over a drink </br></br></br>  <br>Nami, Usopp and Chopper will cry <br>Franky and Brook don't know him <br>Sanji will wonder for a sec and then be ok with him<br>Zoro won't give a fuck<br><br>not sure about Robin though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Indeed. I'm tougher than I thought.</br>  Who cut Z's arm /a/? Was it Doffy or that unnamed 7th shichibukai?  <br>7th shichibukai</br>  <br>it was said that the person who cut his arm used a devil fruit, and that they joined during the timeskip<br><br>so it has to be the new one or law. but law was like 10 years old when his arm got cut off so it cant be him</br></br></br>  <br> such was the fate of your pants. <br>Ok that was pretty good.</br></br>   replies: 228, posters: 38 <br>Are we always with that few people?

Will Zoro FINALLY have a decent fight? He can't keep steamrolling everyone until Shiriew / Mihawk  <br>That's what I thought too. Wanted to make sure I didn't just miss something.</br>  <br>What about Sanji and the others?</br>  <br>I ASSUME he will get a decent fight against the Yonkou's first mate<br><br>whichever one we fight first<br><br>it would be ridiculous for Zoro to roll a Yonkou's first mate</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sanji at least clashed with Vergo and Doflamingo for a while<br>franky had an epic fight with Señor Pink<br>The others? They sure need one fight to bring them back to the spotlight, they haven't done too much since the timeskip<br><br>Even the fucking dragon at Punk Hazard was a bigger challenge for Zoro than Hyozou / Monet</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and Pica<br><br>pica had nothing for zoro<br><br>He should have kept running</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> epic fight against Mantis Zoan who uses arms as swords <br><br>Oda make it happen.</br></br></br></br>  <br> the fucking dragon at Punk Hazard was a bigger challenge for Zoro than Hyozou / Monet <br><br>Oda is a hack confirmed.</br></br></br>  Been rereading Fishman arc and i literally have no idea how Queen Otohime had managed to pull a peace treaty. What the fuck did she do on Mariejois?  <br>Haki has various usages<br><br>Whether it's winning allies to your side or getting to sign peace treaties</br></br></br>  <br>Did she has that, well i don't remember such a thing. Besides i don't think you can manipulate people with haki, it doesn't simply work that way. A fishman/woman going into Mariejois is just like going harlem wiith kkk robe.</br>  <br>She rode a few rounds on the dick caroussel.</br>   makes the same mistake   <br><br> Besides i don't think you can manipulate people with haki, it doesn't simply work that way <br><br><br>They already mentioned luffy has an "aura" that allows him to win allies. What did you think they were talking about<br><br><br>We saw him use his CoCK to domesticate the animals on the island with rayleigh</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is Black Leg Sanji the strongest melee fighter in the New World?  <br>He wasnt even the strongest melee fighter on punk hazard<br><br>He isnt even the strongest melee fighter on his crew. Luffy is still a melee fighter. Doesn't matter if he has a devil fruit or not.</br></br></br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>Zoro is admiral level now, didn't you see how he fought equally with Fuji?</br>    <br>Did you see how he lost?</br>  <br> I'll the straw hats...BY GIVING THEM THE MERA MERA! </br>  <br>Luffy didn't make allies with people who already hate him, nah.</br>  <br>Except he didn't? The simple fact that he was able to match his speed and counter his attacks with ease shows just how much he grew since the TS. <br><br>Current Zoro is way way more powerful than pre-TS Zoro. Zoro is yet receive a scratch since the TS let alone fight challenging opponent. He cut Monet in half like nothing and defeated Pica with barely any effort. He is yet to show any technique he learned during the TS and likely mastered asura by now. <br><br>Personally I wouldn't be very surprised if current Zoro is &gt; Luffy now. Just look how he cut a huge ship in half by simple sword swing, Mihawk is the only character beside him to be shown capable of doing something similar.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But he didn't. His whole plan would have worked perfectly without Usopps tatabasco bullshit and Sabo appearing out of nowhere.</br>  <br>Lucci and Kaku could both knock buildings down with a single kick. It's not exclusive to swordsmen.</br>  <br><br>I love how zoro's being a dick, and Sanji acts all tsundere</br></br>  <br>They need special attack/forms to do so. Zoro cut a whole huge ship like it is nothing. <br><br>Beside lets not forget that Zoro cut Pica who is belt like fucking mountain with barely any effort. If he knew where Pica real body was he'd KO him in single hit.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see any indication of him being stronger than Luffy.</br>  <br>You know what you're right. It was his crew. Doflamingo was probably the only competent fuck in the arc.</br>  <br>The fact that he fought equally with admiral? That he didn't find any trouble at all beating Doffy #2 man? I genuinely believe Zoro could've defeated Doffy way faster than Luffy. He is very fast and has top stamina, plus his attacks are so fucking deadly.</br>  <br>Zoro can't do anything to gear 4th luffy<br><br>He has nothing no mobility skills. Nothing like Skywalk or geppo to deal with luffy bouncing everywhere<br><br>Not to mention he might not even be able to damage luffy at all. <br><br>Doflamingo went from piercing and hurting luffy at will to being unable to damage gear 4th luffy at all<br><br>Even when he had free hits on him. The rubber seems to be impervious to physical attacks in that form.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>g4 only negated blunt haki attacks, we haven't seen what a blade, haki coated or not, does to Luffy's rubber/haki defense.</br></br>  <br> Zoro can't do anything to gear 4th luffy <br><br>We don't know. Zoro was cutting through Pica who's fucking mountain with no trouble, he probably can cut through Luffy.<br><br> He has nothing no mobility skills. Nothing like Skywalk or geppo to deal with luffy bouncing everywhere <br><br>Really now? Didn't you see how he was jumping all over the city trying to find Pica real body? <br><br>Doffy was not able to hurt Luffy because his strings were not that sharp. Zoro swings are so fucking deadly going but we've seen so far. Even without haki he is able to cut huge stuff.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Holyshit I forgot how awful Zorofags can be  <br><br> Doffy was not able to hurt Luffy because his strings were not that sharp. <br><br>Did you guys miss them slicing off Law's arms or cutting up a meteor or destroying an entire city?<br><br>Boundman and Seastone are the only thing they haven't cut.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't Fujitoras attack make him bleed slightly?</br>  <br>Haki is a willpower thing.<br><br>The man with the stronger will wins.</br></br></br>  <br>Luffy only rebounded a kick from Doffy as Boundman, not exactly his strings.</br>  <br>guy with the law face has terrible lazy eye syndrome</br>  <br>Chill the fuck, we havent seen what demonic spirts Zoro is capable of, I'd bet alot of money it is damn close to on par with Gear 4.</br>  <br>Doffy is the one who cut him not Fuji and he only was able to do so because Zoro was busy fighting Fuji and paying attention to him.</br>  <br>no it was a string attack, athlete thread or something like that. he put strings on the bottom of his feet like iceskates and tried to kick</br>  <br>thats kinemon that doffy cut. see the 2 swords, the kimono instead of tux</br>  <br>Post a page where Doffy landing a sharp string attack on G4 luffy, let me save you the trouble tere are none.<br><br>The god thread didnt land beause it was hit by King Kong Gun, not because he was impervious to it.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh you're right it was athletes thread, so yeah Luffy did block it afterall.<br><br><br>That's Kinemon</br></br></br></br>  <br>see<br><br><br>it was the same move that cut off law's arm</br></br></br></br>  <br>Couldn't Luffy just punch a hole through the bricks away from the seastone bars to get outside?</br>  <br>Athlete thread is hard to tell whats going on, it seems like the initial contact is blunt, followed bny the strings.<br><br>I say this because his foot is what is covered in haki and not the strings. Why would he need to coat the foot when its the strings that make contact?</br></br></br>  I want Zorofags to leave<br><br>I want powerlevelfags to leave</br></br>  <br>It's probably the same move he used to cut off the towers in the palace, so in my head canon it's safe to say the strings are there.</br>  <br>I want Haki to never have existed</br>  <br> we're never getting more baby 5 <br> she's off to have gorilla babies </br></br>  <br>Im pretty sure the move that cut off Law's arm some sort of saw thread. It looked different, it was a single thread at the back of the leg that connected to the heel. Dont remember the chapter to go check.</br>  <br>Urouge sounds awful</br>  <br> implying luffyfags arent biggest powerlevelfags </br>   No episode today <br> No Corazin and his clumsiness <br><br>Why live?</br></br></br>  <br>Noone cares what you want you speedreader.</br>  <br> no manly Silva voice </br>  <br> No new anime <br> No new manga <br> Feels like time has stoodstill <br><br>I don't want to feel this feel.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> anime <br>Please fuck off loser.</br></br>  <br>One day One Piece will be over.

I know it was before your faggot ass started watching but episodes used to have 1.5 to 2 chapters in each. Nowadays some episodes barely have .5 of a chapter, hence its shit, along with the shit art.<br><br>God damn is it possible to have worse taste?</br></br></br>  <br>The real answer is ratings aren't suffering from this slow ass pacing. So they'll keep on with this pacing rather than crappy filler.</br>  <br>yeah, because TOEI care more about money then actually doing the source justice, they're horrible, I can only hope Episode of Sabo is good</br>  <br>why no episode today?</br>  <br> nope, prior to Dressrosa, it was about 6 chapters an episode <br>Do you have fucking Alzheimer's?<br><br>Toei switched to one chapter per episode in goddamn EL<br><br>I also have 702 on my computer and the new content began 4:45 in, maybe you're counting the commercial time from the livestream in your 11 minutes</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I was physically sick when I checked how the Usopp haki scene was handled.

It was an entertaining request.</br>    DRAW MY WAIFUUU  <br>rip i tried something</br>  Requesting a childbearing Esdese, or her in a tank top and shorts or underwear complaining that is too hot.  <br>That's so cute. I love her smile, and that hoodie is super adorable  and also makes me feel a little funny because I can see her collarbone .<br>Thank you for drawing her, anon.

If you want something more specific, how about receiving flowers or a cake to celebrate 10 years of iM@S?  Requesting Shinobu laughing after hearing something particularly ridiculous. Thank you for considering, and anything not overly egregious will be appreciated.  <br>That patissiere outfit is really cute anon, would you mind if I steal that pic for a request of mine in the future? wait, your waifu is cute too of course</br>  Requesting Chihaya, something summer related would be nice, but anything is fine. Thanks in advance if anyone picks this up.  <br>go on, thanks!</br>  <br>Best Im@s, shit reference.<br>Seriously, can't you make a better reference?</br></br>  <br>I've been meaning to actually, just never got around to it. I'll make a new one tomorrow. Any suggestions on what to add/change?</br>  Requesting Hagoromo Gitsune wearing the outfit on the right side of the reference. Anything else is fine, too.  <br> Nio a cute. </br>  <br>Start again from scratch, find official design works of Chihaya then put them there. Don't put fanarts, for Pete's sake.</br>  <br>No fanart, make sure the aspect ratio is correct on all the pictures, more shots from side/back, some facial expressions wouldn't hurt.</br>  <br>His only problem is finding an expression of Chihaya besides a sad face.</br>  <br> Thank you. You're waifu is also a cute. </br>  <br><br>I prefer fanart in references.</br></br>  <br>Well, I don't.</br>  <br>Honestly I think yours looks cuter. <br>The original has really round eyes, huge pupils and a big nose.</br></br>  <br>Yeah no. Like cloning a clone, it's just going to get further from what he fell in love with.</br>  Cyan in a hot spring on a cold day  <br><br>It shouldn't be up to you whether or not the OR prefers seeing her in certain styles. It also makes it more accessible to more drawfags if they like the way she is drawn in some fanart, but not the official art.</br></br>  Hello requesting Kougyoku wearing Demon Slayer's outfit from DFO (http://imgur.com/a/XxRzU), or Shigure's summer swimsuit from Kancolle (http://i.imgur.com/JRsxSWF.jpg), please and thanks!  <br><br>I've drawn some characters solely because I liked the fanart in the ref, but do what you want.</br></br>  <br>I was going for this look though ;-;. Anyways, you helped me figure out what was wrong. I'll see if I can change it just for fun</br>  Requesting Hex Maniac holding up some lingerie looking extremely embarrassed. Other 36J stuff welcome.  <br> It also makes it more accessible to more drawfags if they like the way she is drawn in some fanart, but not the official art. <br><br><br> I've drawn some characters solely because I liked the fanart in the ref, <br>Noted for the next ref.</br></br></br></br></br>  Nothing at all from Wonfes<br><br>I keep forgetting to not get my hopes up, because they always get dashed.</br></br>  <br>FUUUUCK I can't deny this request and I thought I as done for today<br>I'll do it ;-;</br></br>  Requesting Laharl saying something motivating or being overly happy from being called maou-sama please!  <br> Finally got painted <br>I am so happy right now</br></br>  <br>Who is (s)he, anon?<br><br> So I know who to be salty at. No worries, not a drawfag so it's not like I would have drawn her/him anyway </br></br></br>  <br>I'll reveal it by the weekend's end</br>  <br>Hex Maniac is the best. Fantastic taste, anon. Can't wait for your delivery.</br>  <br>What's wrong with fanart in references exactly? I think it makes more sense to put an exciting fanart picture to inspire drawfags.</br>  <br>It doesn't really help. The fanart may look completely different from the original style so if they draw her based on that they'll completely look off. Some fan arts have mistakes in them too. Do you want your waifu to have her breast size get fucked up?</br>  <br>Fanart is generally a little bit off from the way the creator intended.<br><br>I don't have an issue with it, but I can see why some might.<br><br><br> My waifu is perflat so that's hard to do </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him but my waifu's breast sizes are usually kept the same</br>  <br>Also, really good fanart can intimidate the beginner/intermediate drawfags.<br>"He wants me to draw like -this-?</br></br>  Requesting Asuka drawn in her late 30s or 40s or so, doing something around the house or maybe interacting with our children. You can include faceless self-insert if you want. I like to think about what we'll be like when we're older and have children, I find it really romantic, that point in your life where you have settled down and though your love life might not be the exciting, rollercoaster tumult that brought you together, you've reached the point that you've become an ingrained part of each other's existence, as ever-present as eating or sleeping or breathing, but this presence still brings you a sense of comfort and warmth that you now can't imagine being without. I just want a picture that conveys that feeling of an aging and happy couple, with many years behind them and many years ahead, until they finally join each other in the rest of death, departing this world but never each other.   Only thing of waifu was a shitty GK <br><br>Well.<br><br>At least I got a beautiful delivery, WonFes was a bust</br></br></br></br>  <br>usually you wouldnt post fanart with mistakes and wrong design for a reference, so that shouldnt be a problem.</br>  <br>Well, brainless maggots do that sometimes.</br>  <br> &gt;Not him but my waifu's breast sizes are usually kept the same <br>Lucky you, mine has gone through all sizes.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Also, sorry I didn't post a more detailed reference. I assume she's a well-known enough character that most artists would be familiar with what she looks like.</br>  Another day of shitposting and accomplishing nothing has now come and gone. Maybe tomorrow...  <br> accomplishing nothing <br> she was drawn <br>for you</br></br></br>  Requesting Hibiki trying to cool off in front of a fan.  <br>My waifu's boobs vary occasionally, even in official art. Generally small, but they've been up to moderate sometimes.</br>    Requesting Hakodate Omiko trying to deal with the Summer heat, or dressed as a pirate.  <br>holy shit shark is cute without her teeth</br>  Someone draw Chronoire being cute pls, goodnight for now thread-chan  <br>Cute.</br>  <br>Not her waifufag but she is cute even with her teeth showing.  Although the idea of her sucking you off with that tongue and teasing your dick by gently scraping your dick with her teeth is pretty hot.  </br>  Requesting Ran doing the Rancho Relaxo taunt from Team Fortress 2, and instead of a chair, Ran uses her tails as the chair.<br><br>Rancho ref: http://i.imgur.com/q6FRfum.png<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8HJ<wbr>nW0GLDVE</wbr>  [ ] [Embed]</br></br></br>  <br>i'm sorry for the wacky colors, i tried to do a background but i forgot i don't know how to compose scenes and scrapped it at the last moment</br>  <br>Alright, made a new reference sheet real fast as per the suggestions of others. Kept some fan art in there, but it's mostly official art now.</br>  <br>Very nice</br>  Requesting Mazaki Anzu having a foodgasm. Dish is up to artist.<br><br>Any other works are very much appreciated.</br></br>  <br>Nice! Could've used some more work on hands, but I like your style.<br><br>Thanks a lot.</br></br></br>  <br>Here anon<br>Hope you like it</br></br>  Requesting a cute Tomoko  <br>Goddamn this is so cute, nice work my man, A+++</br>  <br>Nice, thank you anon, that's really cute.</br>  <br>I'm glad ~</br>  <br>Requesting something cute with my lovely Q, from [C] - Control.<br><br>Anything would be greatly appreciated, whether that just be sleeping, embarrassed, eating, whatever!<br>She's a quiet, somewhat emotionless character, sometimes those emotions do shine through though - I like embarrassed blushes a lot.<br><br>Thanks for reading.<br>Good luck to anyone else still waiting too~!<br><br>P.S:<br>I did receive something last weekend, so I'd recommend looking at other requests first, even if you're interested in mine, I'd prefer more people to have a shot if they've not had something before!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Really cute anon.</br>  <br>Really cute, but the chest is kinda small.</br>  <br>It's on model brother.</br>  <br>MDF is dead, anon. No more 36J.</br>  <br>Her chest is small dude</br>  <br>oh come the fuck on this is clearly vidya</br>  <br> waifu in op.  <br>Feels good.</br></br>  <br>Thank you for the kind words! Im sure your waifu is a qt as well.</br>  <br>I like your style. It's nice and looks like cutouts</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128609305 <br>My love for my waifu.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128609305 <br>At the end of the weekend, I look forward to her smile to have been made again. It's all worth it for her.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128609305 <br>I adore my waifu and I get filled with joy and a small sense of disbelief whenever she's delivered. My waifu's not that popular so I rarely ever expect new art of her so this is a reliable source of art of her, and if I get the chance, I can talk about how wonderful she is.<br><br>I mostly ignore the threadly drama so it isn't that big of a deal for me.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128609305 <br>Familiarity breeds contempt. That seems to be what happened to you.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128609305 <br>My love is undying.</br>  <br>Posting in this thread is not the only way to show your waifu love. In fact, most other ways are a lot better than asking for free drawings of her.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128609305 <br>I came here, on a mission, to one day be able to draw my waifu. Got some feedback, some insight on what I need to work on, etc. while trying to please people. I'm not sure what's happened, but I feel like I've lost insight, or just trying to make anons happy. Things fell off and it just doesn't feel the same.<br><br>I request for anyone to try and attempt, and for drawfags to draw and enjoy, but now I feel like taking a break from here</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128609305 <br>I found my waifu close to the time these threads started, so those early threads hold a special place in my heart.<br>And while they may never go back the slow and comfortable pace they had before, the core of the WWD meaning is still around, you just have to take it easy to see it.</br></br>  <br>She has only 2 pieces of official art (both group shots) and 0 merch. I just want to be able to see more of her. That's why I come here.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128609305 <br><br>Well, the fact that this is probably the only thing that supplies her with new art nowadays. I'll do admit that all the shitposting and circlejerking really wear me out sometimes, but seeing her smile always draws me back. It's really special to me to have that kind of thing, especially if it's from a request I've made.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128609305 <br>Tl;dr</br>  Requesting Toyone doing something that shows off her height  <br>I don't wanna sound like a drawfag shilling, but commissioning is of course more reliable.<br>It's too easy to have her become the target of drama or shit posting, which could mean she won't be drawn and you'll have to deal with faggots.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128609305 <br>I think about quitting drawing and requesting every week. Then one week I unlocked her final card in yomecolle and the other week somebody was mean to her, I keep finding reasons. And for drawing somebody posts a hilarious request and it feels fun again.</br>  <br>I've commissioned her a few times and have managed to fly under the radar in these threads for a few years now.<br><br>If she ever does become a target for shitposting, then I might rethink coming here, but right now I see no problem with it.</br></br></br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128609305 <br>My waifu was an unpopular character in a comfy series that no one really cares about anymore in 2015. There's maybe 2 artists on pixiv that draw her regularly (maybe a drawing or two per month) but other than that she's either ignored or outright forgotten by the community. I request her most weeks so that, at the very least, her memory will remain in the minds of a few anons on 4chan rather than being completely forgotten. I mean, sure she has a treasured spot in my heart but I want her to be important to others too - I like to imagine her making friends with all the other waifus in the thread so she won't have to be lonely.</br>  At this rate, she'll ever get drawn.<br>Go on with me, boys. Seek glory where I cannot.</br>  <br>Without me*<br> Or feel free to take me with you, please.<br> I do still want my waifu drawn. </br> </br></br>  <br>Nice one choco!</br>  <br>nice one coupon!</br>  <br><br>Which one?</br></br>  <br>you</br>  <br>It's Rori.</br>  <br>chopon</br>  Is it harder to draw on paper or digital?  Requesting Akane, please.  <br>I think its harder to draw on a rock.</br>  <br>Good job, sharkbro</br>  <br>Nice one, chopon.</br>  <br>That's really cute, Panties.</br>  <br>You sound like a nice guy, anon. I bet she's a qt.</br>  <br>Thanks anon, you're waifu is cute too I'm sure.</br>  <br>Well done quick sketch kun!</br>  <br>I think digital is harder but at the same time is really convenient when you get used to it. I do a lot of sketches so in my case, paper is faster and cleaner. Also more comfortable. <br><br>I do practice sketches on paper and bigger colored pieces on digital</br></br></br>    <br>Needs more fluff! <br><br>Cute stuff salmon</br></br></br>      <br>Drawing is all about hand-eye-mind coordination. Most of us were likely raised on paper and pencil until we could get access to the digital programs and tablets. That may be why many find it harder to draw with intent using digital media. Coloring imo is superior digitally (cheaper, no drying times, infinity undos).</br>  Requesting Ashisu-chan, please. Anything is fine, but maybe saying I love you back, or smiling lovingly would be great. Thanks  Requesting Celestia Ludenberg in a wedding dress smiling happily with tears of joy and holding flowers.  <br>imagine you are trying to save an image with the ctrl+s shortcut but you actually press ctrl+x, then you try a couple more times until you finally press the correct key, that's digital drawing.</br>  <br>on paper, you can't flip the artwork to check, no undo, and generally requires some planning before drawing.<br>digital, eh, when you start it's a bit tough, but you'll get used to it. for beginners, it's like using your feet to hold a pencil and the drawing appear magically on the paper. digital colouring is much more superior than paper of course and will save more money and time in the long run</br></br>  <br> waifu3 <br> 3 <br><br>Nigga wat?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably the third pic of his one waifu.<br>Probably a naming system.</br></br>  <br>Waitwait, maybe it's just his third picture of his waifu!</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>It's certainly just the thired picture of his waifu, don't start a witchhunt.</br>  <br>thanks!</br>  Requesting Tooru with happy look.  <br>Ah okay, my bad for accusing.  Sorry. </br>  <br>It's alright, m8</br>  <br>OR here, thanks a lot, it's cute as hell! He looks so excited to sign that autograph, it's adorable!</br>  Was twlrarre here this week?  Requesting the three of them welcoming the head of the household home, or anything nice of Youko please.  <br>Someone is requesting your waifu dead/killed, thought I should let you know.</br>  <br>but its him</br>  <br>What</br>    <br>Very cute Hot Chocolate.</br>    <br>Cute! Well done, Salmon. Shark teeth are the cutest.</br>  <br>get rid of that sameface</br>  <br>feel free to rerequest since its a shitty sketch</br>  <br>Nice sora!</br>  <br>thanks!<br><br><br>i tried.jpg</br></br></br></br>  Requesting Birdy in a Sarong bikini please.

Requesting Yukari Yakumo (left) dressed up as Nyarlathotep (right).<br>Be sure that she also has Nya's hairstyle, glasses and everything.</br>  <br>I mean, like, you could always like, draw glasses on one of these fine ladies in the thread.

But she's asking if he's the mother or the father. <br><br>Would you fuck  her , /a/?</br></br>  fuck off  <br>So, who's the father?</br>   At the end, it seems that they saw a photograph of Sasuke and Sakura <br>Must be the photo from the end of Gaiden.</br>  for information, one prescreening is finished and now we (read other people) are hunting for spoilers on twitter<br>there is also another prescreening today in Japan</br>  <br>I think Orochimaru is mentioned as the only parent.</br>   Boruto's dream  <br> to become a ninja like sasuke that protects the village from the dark <br> yfw Burrito wants to be Batman </br></br>  <br>Kabuto</br>  I'm most interested in which key animators participated in the movie to be honest.  <br>Boruto wants to be like Sasuke. Sarada wants to be like Naruto.</br>  <br>It's legit. Here's a picture of one of the tickets issued. The event of the pre-screening is on it. There's also one on the 28th with a stage introduction by the cast and crew.</br>  Apparently Momo and Kin were working for Kaguya, possibly trying to resurrect her via a second God Tree.  <br>I effed up, the other prescreening is in 2 days<br>I should sleep after nightwork, but  Arc-V </br></br>  Apparently the fights were good.  <br>So they were not the threats then. But then who is?</br>  <br>Not surprising given that Hiroyuki Yamashita is the director.

That's kinda the point. He had all the power while that senile fuck just sat in his chair, smoking his pipe and neglecting orphans.</br>  <br>Team Konohamaru (probably Sarada and Mitsuki) don't know Hinata and Himawari and are surprised about birthday invation or something (google guess)</br>   Sakura and Sarada, <br> touching conversation about Sasuke <br>Probably about why daddy is never home.</br></br>   Kage bunshin Naruto was holding the cake.  <br> The real Naruto is in the office. He got tired. <br> Kage bunshin disappeared. Cake splat. <br>Smooth move there, Dadruto.</br></br></br>  <br>How can Sarada be Bolt's childhood friend and not know his mother or sister?</br>  <br>Not a very good childhood friend at all.</br>  <br> and not know his mother or sister? <br>Same way nardo can know Salad but not that she's never met her dad?<br><br>Maybe he just never invited her over because girls are icky and have cooties.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd say that's too retarded to be true, but this is Kishi we are talking about here.</br>  <br>Jesus fuck Naruto.<br><br>Leave the clone working, not yourself. Jesus fuck.</br></br></br>   Oh my <br> Sai scolded Inojin <br> for not being brave <br>I guess fuccboi didn't make it.</br></br></br>  <br>So you're saying Naruto is a figurehead while Sasuke is the real deal. Gotcha. No wonder Boruto doesn't want to be like his loser dad.</br>   Oh my <br> Sasuke saves Sarada <br> princess style <br><br> Lots of Sasuke-Sarada interaction <br><br> Sarada is the one who suggested Sasuke to take in Boruto as his apprentice <br>Salad, you greedy little slut.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I called it you fucks.

Trailers already spoiled a fairly large chunk of the plot.</br>  <br> Implying these are not fake. <br>This happened for the LAST too.</br></br>  with the ending being parent-children shots, does it confirm Dadruto surviving?

(Sarada is the only Uchiha he can lust after all unless Pinkshit drops another Uchiha fucking shit on to the world that is a boy.)</br></br></br></br>  <br>You'd think Naruto would be more appreciate of his family considering he never had one.<br><br>Why must they always ruin grown-up characters by always making them abandon their kids for cheap drama? Not /a/ related but this same crap was one of the reasons Korra was utter shit by making Aang a shitty dad.<br><br>My fucking dad died when I was months old, never met him, and I don't have daddy issues and even if I had them I wouldn't ruin my work by projecting them on my work. It's fucking stupid.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's even more out of practice than Nardo.</br>  <br>Exactly.</br>  <br>Unless it's a joke I don't get, I think you meant Jashin.</br>  <br>Well, yeah. She's a housewife now, not a ninja.</br>  <br>kishi is projecting too much</br>  <br> Bort wants to assume a support role to Salad as Hokage <br>Where is that said? We know he'll end up doing the wandering spymaster bit like Jiraiya and Sauce because of POTTERY, but as far as Bolt's own, stated goals are concerned he just does not want his face to end up on that mountain.</br></br>  <br>Because the whole village is his family. That is what his predecessors believed too. And that's what Salad believes in too.</br>  <br><br>Best thing is that Hiashi doesn't even gives fucks.<br><br>Also, there's nothing wrong with Bort being a Shikamaru/NotEvil Danzo.<br><br>It's refreshingly different.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its going to be interesting competetion i see...</br>  <br> Where is that said? <br>see<br><br><br><br>I can kinda see why. nardo wanted to be the Hokage, but he also has a family. Now that he's Hokage, he has to choose which one to be loyal towards. He tries to balance both with clones but shit happens and it doesn't always work out as planned.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Naruto cares more about Sasuke than about everyone Sasuke does too. You were just blinded because you thought a shitty fanservice movie like the Last undoes 700 chapters of the manga and Kishi's boner about their bond.</br>  <br>I know that's shitposting, but Tobirama died alone and a virgin.</br>   There is a scene where Hinata is getting treated for wounds. <br> (The details of it are all over the place. But Boruto and Himawari are safe with her at the time) <br><br> they hurt Burrito's mama <br>So much for TnJ. These niggas are dead.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Also, there's nothing wrong with Bort being a Shikamaru/NotEvil Danzo. <br><br>He doesn't give a fuck about them, he wants to be like Sasuke now. Stop projecting those irrelevant characters when the movie is "Boruto follows Sasuke's steps."</br></br></br>   threat not mentioned <br><br> they r on kaguya's side <br><br> they r her relatives <br>Fuck. Then they're really gonna milk this thing until it's dead.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To this day I have no fucking idea how Tobirama, and specially Hashirama died when they survived Madara and even the fucking tailed beasts.</br>  <br>Hinata has a manface there. What happened?</br>  <br>Because retcons. Remember when Minato was the most powerful Hokage?<br><br>Also,<br> ・サスサラは「相変わらず厳しいねパパ」みたいな会話あり <br> ・メタル母親不明速攻でやられる <br> ・サスケが頼まれるのは外伝の逆バージョンみたいな感じ <br> ・結構予告やトレーラーの台詞出てきた </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kishi happened.</br>  <br>Ninja Menopause.</br>  <br>Tobirama was never as strong as Hashirama and apparently the Cloud had like 20 uber ninjas that killed him off, so his death is that much of retarded ass bullshit.<br><br>Hashirama though is another story. I could only see him dying due to how Hiruzen died, not young which is bullshit on Kishi's part.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably, but you still have to Deal with the fact that Sarada is the one getting up there.<br><br><br>I guess if you don't want to compare Bolt to Danzo, then compare him to Shikamaru, unless Shikadai also wants the right man job or...<br><br> Shikadai is the Shizune. </br></br></br></br></br></br>   Lightning release? <br><br> Boruto unconsciously got it the first time he tried </br></br>  <br> メタル <br> 母 <br>What is it? Is it something about Metal mother?</br></br></br>  <br>Apparently Metal's mother is unknown.</br>  <br>GOT AWAY WITH EVERYTHING<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=h_D<wbr>3VFfhvs4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Shikadai is the Shizune. <br>Probably. But Danzo was never Hiruzen's aide. Really, nobody was supposed to know what he did. <br><br>Bort will probably be similar. Always watching from the shadows, but still staying very close to the village.<br><br>Not like mundane things like distance matter if he masters Hiraishin like his granddad.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> dying due to <br><br>*dying due to old age like</br></br></br>  <br>Metal's mother is still unknown</br>   Naruto has tons of jobs lol its funny <br> tv interviews, ceremonies, opening ceremonies for electric trains, helping granny to walk, helping others to give gifts, etc <br> a lot <br>Poor bastard.</br></br></br>   病院で意識を取り戻しヒマワリの安否を心配するボルト…そこには負傷した<wbr>ヒナタの姿とヒナタを救うサクラの 姿が。 サスケの叱咤激励で自分を見つめ直すボルト ナルトを助けに向かう所に駆け付ける母ヒナタと師匠の前で抜け忍の額当てを<wbr>巻いてからの新五影＋サスケ&amp;ボ ルト師弟！</wbr></wbr>   <br>It's not either of them. BUROTO SAID HE WANTED TO BE LIKE SASUKE IS NOW.<br><br>Not Dazou or Shikamaru. SASUKE. God you fucking idiots have reading comprehension. He's going to leave and protect the village for years and years carrying out secret missions. That's his ninja way.</br></br></br>  <br> He's going to leave and protect the village for years and years carrying out secret missions <br>But he doesn't have to since Sauce only left so long because he was poking his head around in other dimensions.<br><br>Also, Hiraishin. This argument is pointless.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's the joke, they are not very childhood friends. They prefer to mind their own bussiness.</br></br>   Sakura lots of screentime   <br>They are also pushing the Boruto and Sarada ship.<br><br>So it would literally be narusasu Het version</br></br></br>  <br>It's Orochimaru</br>   Apparently <br> Sakura lots of screentime <br>Bear in mind that a majority of the people posting spoilers are likely SShits who only care about their own ship.<br><br>Also,<br> ・だら先は台詞なしでガイ・ヤマト？と一緒だった <br> ・綱手は出たか分からなかったけどEDにはいた <br> ・EDの各一家ではいのとサクラのポーズが同じ <br> ・サスケの戦闘はとにかくいい <br> ・体術多用 <br> ・ナルト出番多い <br> ・スサノオさん出番おめでとう </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Boruto wakes up at the hospital and worry about Himawari’ state.

Is there truly anyone who doesn't want them to fuck and make Kaguya babies?</br>  <br>Orochimaru is everyone parents now?</br>   Kakashi <br> no lines <br> only appearance <br><br>Holy shit</br></br></br></br>  <br>Boruto's dream is to become a ninja like Sasuke that protects the village from the shadows. <br><br>It's not to be next to the Hokage as secretary or aid. Stop projecting bullshit about Shikamaru or Danzou. He wants to be like Sasuke and he'll find a way to be exactly like that, poking heads to dimensions if he must. He's his student now.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much. Their spoilers are not completely reliable if at all.</br>  <br> Boruto wakes up at the hospital and worry about Himawari’ state <br> the first thing he worries about is his imouto <br>Adorable. Also, this nigga out for blood now.</br></br></br>   Sorry LEETEN shippers   <br>Yes, I know. Naruto and Sasuke still meet even when Sasuke's away in his missions. I don't see what's the problem. As another anon said, useless fodder chick like Himawari or Hinata could look after any kids they make. They don't really have a life beyond the house.</br>  <br>I don't. That is boring.</br>  <br>Anon pls. You haven't even seen the movie.</br>  <br> Sauce will teach Boruto <br> Naruto (clone) will train Sarada <br> Mitsuki will tragically have to rely on Sakura  <br><br>New Sanin Three Way Deadlock when?</br></br></br></br></br>   Kakashi <br> no lines <br> only appearance  <br><br> 病院で意識を取り戻しヒマワリの安否を心配するボ&gt;ルト…そこには負傷し<wbr>たヒナタの姿とヒナタを救うサ&gt;クラの 姿が。</wbr> <br> サスケの叱咤激励で自分を見つめ直すボルト <br> ナルトを助けに向かう所に駆け付ける母ヒナタと師&gt;匠の前で抜け忍の額当<wbr>てを巻いてからの</wbr> <br><br> モモシキの強襲で試験会場が崩壊 一般人を守る&gt;為に落ちてくる天上を砕くサクラちゃんに <br> キレッキレのアクションをするナルト、サ スケコン&gt;ビ！ 破れてしまうナルトを追って無謀に突っ込み負傷するヒナタ… <br> サスケ「お前を慕ってくれる妹と心配してくれる母&gt;が居なければ同じだな<wbr>…からのボルト覚醒…！</wbr> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sarada is the one with the Sakura skillset though.</br>  <br><br>This is fucking Kishimoto projecting while creating a new snowflake by the name of Boruto.<br><br>You seriously thought this movie would get nice writing?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sorry LEETEN shippers <br>w-what?<br> ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>Old.<br>No Sharingan.<br>No Wife.<br><br>He's ninja Steve Jobs and Bill Gates combined at least. That's gotta count for something, right?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think you're taking the Sasuke thing a little too literally. He's not going to chop an arm off and spend the next dozen years in a forest looking for aliens.</br>  <br><br>Sakura wasn't so bad. At least she had a job besides being a housewife and got to punch Kaguya. Becoming the head of the Hospital or the Health Care is quite important. Without healers, people will fucking die in war. <br><br>It's just not as self important as Hokage or edgycool as Batman Sasuke.</br></br></br></br>  Either Karin is Mitsukis mom or Suigetsu is his dad  <br>Well gee anon. It's not like other Hokages that Naruto admired didn't choose the village over their own family. Oh wait they totally chose the village over their personal family.<br>Salad will go down that road too.</br></br>  <br>He's not going to be Dazou or Shikamaru either, you're completely misunderstanding his dream. He'll be the guy who carries out the dangerous and secret missions, not the guy who is the Hokage's secretary.</br>   HOLYSHIT Naruto use Truth Seeker Balls!!!!!!!! <br><br> Thanks YOU Kishimoto <br><br> The GOD IS BACK <br>Can he even use the Goudama anymore? I thought those were taken after he and Sauce sealed Kaguya.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> new snowflake by the name of Boruto. <br><br>I can't wait for him to have the Tenseigan.<br><br> that will be the moment that Naruto will have reached the final pits of being utter complete shit when Naruto's son has magical hax eyes completely destroying everything the series was originally about </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Burrito and Salad Not-Kaguya kid will have both mommy and daddy abandonment issues <br>What can go wrong?</br></br>  <br>Anon, we don't know what his dream is other than he wants to protect the village from the dark like Sauce. He didn't say he wants to become Sasuke.</br>  <br>The solution is simple. Abortions.</br>  <br>The kid will kill his grandpas  with some help/advice by 1010  and kick off the 5th Ninja War.</br>  SShits are the least reliable people on the planet I swear.<br><br>  <br> aborting a deity <br>That'll go well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They always have been and have been known to make up shit. Then there are trolls who just tweet shit.</br>  <br><br>As if wasn't clear enough with the novel stating she prefers to staly single and the interrogation marks in Metal's profile.</br></br>   Chouchou got no lines   <br>Some of it sounds pretty cool. I wish people would talk about more than Pink and whether or not she's fucking the emo.</br>   Hey guys, wouldn't it be awesome if our kids played together?   <br>She had no Va announced. Not surprising. Not many girls want to voice a fat nigger.</br>  <br>Good. She's annoying as fuck.<br><br>inb4 buttmad chubbychasers.</br></br></br>  <br> Sakura or anyone of the original rookies: How could you do this Ten Ten? <br> Ten Ten: Because you let Neji die. </br></br>  <br>The funny part is Orochimaru being Mitsuki's parent(s) is the only reliable spoiler corroborated from multiple sources.<br>Nurudu Jr. Sauce Jr, and Orochimaru Jr. are best friends. Who'd have thunk it?</br></br>  <br>They are not talking about the fights either. I get the feeling that many of these are trolls or fantasies. I'm sure some of the SS moments are true but not all.</br>  <br>If that's the case, then I would agree with  And </br>  <br>Mitsuki will get so many bitches with that tongue.<br>Or Boruto can be smart and make that little white haired faggot suck his royal cock.</br></br>  <br> metal lee <br>whats next platinum lee then diamond lee?</br></br>  <br>Someone on twitter saw the preview and mentioned her, can anyone translate this beyond google tier?<br><br>BORUTO試写会おわりました<br>ダルイさんがサクラちゃんがボルトがサスケェがチョウチョウちゃんがサラダ<wbr>ちゃんがダルイさんがダルイさんがダルイさんがやばくてもう本当によかった<wbr><br>ダルイさんが一番よかったイケメンすぎたありがとうございました</br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>   I've seen a lot of mentions of the lack of Kakashi in the film. It seems that he doesn't talk much, if it all. Like a background chara. <br>Konohamaru is a better teacher anyway.</br>  <br>It was Hinata's fault. Kishi admitted he killed him off for NH to happen or some shit like that. Maybe Hinata is killed as revenge.</br>  <br> Konohamaru is a better teacher anyway. <br><br>Hahaha no. Sarutobis are a cancerous plight on the ninja world.</br></br></br>  <br> Sarutobis are a cancerous plight on the ninja world <br> Asuma </br></br>  <br>No, Hinata will be her Kakashi.</br>   Tsunade does not seem to appear either in the film.   <br><br>Well, both Boruto and Sarada seem the type to not bring children as adults only to make them suffer.<br><br>After all, Sarada seems to want to adopt all of Konoha and bring them bento when she grows up.</br></br></br></br>   Tsunade does not seem to appear either in the film. <br>Poor Shizune.</br>  <br>And?<br>What the fuck did he do besides die like a bitch?<br><br>All Sarutobis die like the worthless cockroaches they are.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Better than cancerous Uchiha.</br>  <br> implying its not gonna be other way around </br>  <br>Tobirama pls. Kagami would have been a better Hokage than that worthless midget you appointed.</br>   I think I need to clarify <br><br> Lots of Sakura screen time <br> 1) this is in comparison with characters other than the Konohamaru team, Naruto and Sasuke <br><br> Sarada suggested Sasuke to take Boruto as his apprentice <br> 2) more like she helped to persuade Sasuke <br>and Sasuke made a funny face there<br><br> Both SSS family and Uzumaki family got lots of moments <br><br>So Salad desperately wants Uzumaki and Uchiha reunited and Sakura's screentime sounds about on par with The Last, if not a little less.<br><br>Okay.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hell no.<br><br>He made the same mistake as Kakashi and showed favoritism to a particular student.<br><br>Good think he'll never make Hokage.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel bad for Konohamaru. He's gonna be another transition Hokage like Kakashi was while everyone else waits for the real Hokage aka Sarada. That's it if he even makes it to Hokage in first place.</br>  <br>But that tongue was made for blowjobs anon. His dad can deepthroat, and I'm pretty sure that's genetic.</br>   There is no conversation between Sasuke and Sakura   Here's a fuckton of spoilers.<br><br>The most screentime went to BoruNaruSasuSaraMitsu (order unknown).<br>Mitsuki's parent is Orochimaru (Sarada wonders whether it's his papa or mama, though). Metal Lee's mother remains unknown.<br>Sarada uses wire.<br>The drawings are more or less nice, though Naruto sometimes has a fish face.<br>There is no conversation between Sasuke and Sakura.<br>When Sakura is seeing her off, Sarada tells her something like 'You're happy that papa is coming back after such a long time, eh?'. Sakura blushes and answers her with 'Aren't you the happiest one?".<br>At a certain point, Sarada tells Sasuke 'You're stern like always, eh, papa'.<br>Sasuke saves Sarada.<br>Sakura is watching the exams while drinking tea with Ino and Temari.<br>In the ending there is a (still?) shot of every family with their kids. I think?<br>In Sakura's healing scene she's apparently healing Hinata.<br>It's unknown whether Sasuke's travels are over. They may be - because at the end there is a scene with Sasuke and Sakura watching over the three kids at dusk (and it seems to be implied that a few days have passed?). They're watching them from the top of a building (?) with the wind blowing. But it's Studio Pierrot, so prepare for it to be the calm before they send him right back into the storm.<br>Sasuke is so cool, Sasuke is so cool, Sasuke is so cool. This seems to be twitter's motto at the moment.<br>Apparently, Boruto wants to become a ninja like Sasuke and not Hokage - so he says that he'll support Sarada. When she hears this, she blushes. *urgh*<br>In the final credits, the 'New Team 7' was written right next to the 'Old Team 7'.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> if i cant be with my husbando than no will one can! </br></br>  <br> Showed favoritism <br>He's been Bolt's tutor/caretaker since before he became a genin.</br></br>  <br> Orochimaru Jr. <br>Why doesn't he look like a creepy ugly anti-social faggot like his father then?<br><br>Actually everyone except for Bold and the fat nigglit are 100% cooler then their parents.</br></br></br></br>   Many fans seem to be unsure whether or not Sasuke actually ended his journey based on what they saw. <br><br>Haha wow<br>What the fuck is there left to do?</br></br></br>  <br>He'll die in the first week like Minato did.<br><br><br>Every teacher of the Sanin has become Hokage. Hiruzen and Kakashi. He won't be the exception because Kishi loves his rhyming.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Apparently, Boruto wants to become a ninja like Sasuke and not Hokage - so he says that he'll support Sarada. When she hears this, she blushes. *urgh* <br> she blushes </br></br>  Background charas<br>Kakashi <br>Temari<br>Kankurou<br>Ino<br>Chouji<br>Lee<br>Shino<br><br>Credits to Baidu</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the prescreening was only in japan. Don't trust Baidu unless they have another big spoiler leak.</br>  <br> Oro ever having a child <br>Seriously, fucking why? Why would Kishi let this faggot live to have children. I could see Tsunade having a fucking kid before Orochimaru.</br></br>   Boruto lost to Shikadai <br>Gentle Fist BTFO</br>   Boruto lost to Shikadai   <br>what about 1010</br>  <br> Apparently, Boruto wants to become a ninja like Sasuke and not Hokage - so he says that he'll support Sarada. When she hears this, she blushes. *urgh* <br><br>Studio Pierrot shitting up shit as always, huh.<br><br>Strange. I love it when they do with with NaruHina, but this? It's feels revolting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>1010 is an exam proctor<br><br><br> Ok I should clarify, background charas as in they have no lines. <br>Man that's sad</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Where did this one come from? Is the source reliable?</br></br>  <br>So that was his plan all along!<br><br>To mix Uzumaki, Hyuuga and Uchiha bloodlines into a single Master Race!<br><br>Truly the most based of Grandfathers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there any redeeming quality to Boruto? He's just a shitty knockoff with a shitty haircut.</br>   Sasuke saves Sarada---&gt;he's holding her in his arms. This is while Momoshiki attacks during the Chuunin exams. (He asks her if she's injured too) <br>I guess he finally decided to stop being a faggot.</br>  <br>Too bad Boruto is a fucking total disgrace <br/></br>  <br> Bolts eyes changed from lavender to blue <br> Shikadai's eyes changed from green to fucking black. <br>What the fuck! Why does this shit keep happening.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Boruto lost to Shikadai <br> Sarada even more confirmed for Hokage <br> Mitsuki it's ok <br> No SasuSaku interactioms <br><br>Ahhh, this is fantastic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So are Lee and Shino.<br>If the spoiler is genuine I'm guessing the distinction is based on 10/10 explaining Stage 1 in detail, maybe even having a bit of tension, whereas Shino will just introduce Stage 2 and Lee won't do shit, just announce the victor in 3.</br></br>  <br><br> Okay he won but he lost <br> Naruto told Hinata to use byakugan to watch Boruto <br> after Lee announces that the winner is Boruto, naruto steps down <br> takes away Boruto's headband in front of EVERYBODY <br> and even announces that he cannot be a ninja anymore <br><br>Can we get some spoiler providers who type coherent sentences?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Okay he won but he lost <br><br> Naruto told Hinata to use byakugan to watch Boruto <br> after Lee announces that the winner is Boruto, naruto steps down <br> takes away Boruto's headband in front of EVERYBODY <br> and even announces that he cannot be a ninja anymore <br>What in the actual fuck?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Go get molested by Mitsuki, Bort. Hokage-sama needs a real man.</br></br>  <br>He actually won. apparently.</br>  <br> Only thing the sauce cares about is his child. <br> Doesn't even care about his own wife or best friend. <br>Well, at least he cares about something for once.</br></br></br>  Bolt technically beat Shikadai but Nardo removed his headband and told him to suck it, forcing him to lose?<br><br>I know something like this would happen the moment I saw "Shikadai beats Bolt", no way Bolt will legitimately lose</br></br>  <br><br>What in the flying fuck?<br><br>Jesus Naruto, what happened to you? No wonder Boruto hates you.</br></br></br></br>  <br> He beat Shikadai <br> but he lost the battle <br>That sounds about right. But seriously, what the fuck is with nardo taking his headband? That's got to be fake.</br></br></br>  <br> takes away Boruto's headband in front of EVERYBODY <br> and even announces that he cannot be a ninja anymore <br>What?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Fucking Naras bribing the Hokage with free ramen.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>No way.<br><br>I mean, I like Shikadai winning, but this sounds to terribly stupid to be true.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can't be that stupid, or can you?</br>   Sasuke is actually a better father than Naruto <br>I'd call you crazy if you told me this would be happening yesterday and yet here we are.</br>  <br>I guess it must be still a team battle and Bort fucked up</br>   Ayy I wanna be one of the last comments. Inojin solos <br>But no, seriously. I wanna know what the fuck is up with nardo emasculating his son like that in front of the entire village.</br>  <br>Not really. Sauce is still worse.</br>  <br>Wait, maybe that's the reason He is wearing Sauce headband in the final fight? But yeah why did nardo taking his headband and told him he cannot be a ninja anymore?</br>  <br>It is clearly not real.</br>  <br>Same. It just feels so unnecessary. It reminds me of NaruSaku and that is a disgusting thought.</br>  How does a child that has a mom capable of seeing miles away and a dad that can be a thousand places at once manage to suffer from neglect?   Naruto made the ground caved in and the heavens open up!   <br><br>Only thing I can think of that would deserve that response would be if Bolt went too HAM and was about to kill Shikadai.</br></br>  <br> Implying any of these spoilers are real. </br>  <br> comes at him with a technique designed to fuck up internal organs <br> aims it for his head </br></br>  <br>He is spoiled.</br>  <br>The part about Burrito winning but not getting the promotion probably is true.</br>  <br><br>It's ALL stupid.<br><br>He deliberatly makes Naruto a shit parent while unpurposely making Sasuke the "good" one while doing even worse than him.</br></br></br></br>   サラダちゃんの声が気に食わない(-＿-) <br> Nips disgusted by Salad's voice </br>  <br>Didn't Sasuke tried to kill his daughter?</br>  <br>I can see the Orochimaru thing being real, because it is so fucking obvious.<br>Also maybe the cake-drop, purely on the grounds that it is fucking retarded and makes no sense, and thus fits perfectly into Kishi's style of writing.</br></br>  <br> Nips disgusted by Salad's voice <br>Fuck you she's adorable.</br></br>  <br>Boruto winning but losing is very believable and pretty much what everyone was expecting.<br><br>Naruto pulling that shit and humiliating and shitting on Boruto in front of the entire villages? That shit makes absolutely no sense.</br></br></br>  <br>I bet that banshee scream of SHANAROOOOO doesn't help.<br>Sarada is no longer best girl.</br></br>   Mr unlimited chakra can't keep a shadow clone active long enough to stay at his daughter's birthday party   Nips are also saying that the real of Mitsuki's parentage is the last punchline in the movie.  <br>Nips should be disgusted by the whole story.<br><br>Sarada's seiyuu it's not even that bad.</br></br></br>  <br>paperwork is hard</br>  <br><br>What, like he's about to say who they are but gets cut off by the credits?</br></br>  <br> so Boruto was fighting Shikadai like we saw in the trailer <br> He beat shikadai and Lee announced him as the winner <br> I guess Naruto figured out something and told Hinata to use byakugan to read Boruto from the audience seat <br> After that he immediately jumped to the battle ground <br> took away Boruto's headband infront of EVERYBODY <br> and announces that he cannot even be a genin anymore <br><br> He also told Lee to announce Shikadai as the winner <br><br> so Boruto beat Shikadai but lost the competition <br><br>But seriously. What in the actual fuck is up with this? Even if he cheated somehow, which should be fine because ninjas, to do that in front of the entire stadium. It must be made up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sasuke tried to kill his own daughter and didn't recognize her despite her having his facial features. So no, he is still the shittier dad SSfag.</br>  <br>The poor girl had potential, but pottery was against her.</br>  <br>bullshit<br>does obito managed to posses as kage again?</br></br>  <br>Apparently when you fall asleep the clones disappear too.</br>  <br><br> didn't recognize her despite her having his facial features <br><br>How the hell is one supposed to recognize their own "facial features"?</br></br></br></br>  <br>He asked Hinata to active her byakugan to watch Boruto<br>He surely did something off limits.</br></br>  Nobody's telling what set Dadruto off like that, so it's probably a ruse.  <br>Yeah I felt it was pretty shit when I heard it in the trailer too. Bolt had the better girl voice.</br>  <br><br>What in the flying fuck can be so bad during a damn ninja battle that can be considered cheating? It's absolutely ridiculous.</br></br>  <br>Burrito fought to kill. The way our lord and savior Tobirama intended</br>   needs to cheat to beat a half sandnigger after receiving personal training from both ninja Gods    But what did Boruto do? <br> he left a cliffhanger there <br> that attention seeker <br> now he's driving <br><br>Why are the spoiler providers for Nardo always either<br> attention whores who put spoilers in extravagant codes and refuse to say anything straight <br> people who can't speak English </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it because he used one of these? No seriously nothing about this makes a lick of sense. It has to be fake.</br>  <br>He knows he has a daughter, right? She has black hair and sharingan and she's wearing something similar to what Sakura used to wear. Put two and two together.</br>  <br> Ninjas <br> not cheating or going for the kill. <br>Sasuke stabbed Gaara. And Neji would have killed Naruto.</br></br></br>  <br>So why?</br>   That's what I saw in one of the spoilers, Boruto is using new ninja tech tool that is forbidden to use in chuunin exams. Not sure legit or not tho <br><br>Could be your pic related</br></br>  Does Mitsuki live at Aunt Anko's?  <br>That would be like Tenten getting demoted because she uses weapons.</br>   For Leeten shippers <br>at the end there r scenes of every family<br><br> Rock and Metal appeared in one pic <br><br> next moment Tenten appeared, alone <br><br> suspicious </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ninjas caring about rules. </br>   Sai scolded Inojin for being a coward <br>One cold motherfucker</br>  <br><br>It's messed up, but if he asked Hinata to use Byakugan it must have been something off limits.<br><br>What if those battles were strictly Taijutsu/Ninjutsu? Who knows.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The very first thing Kakashi tells nardo, Sausage and Pinkshit is that they need to approach him with intent to kill.<br>The guy was bullshitting for attention.</br></br>  <br>What is that supposed to mean? Lee and Tenten were together but got divorced?</br>  <br><br>This is stupid, if Tenten was the mom why wouldn't they just confirm it?</br></br>  <br>This. What the fuck Dadruto? Who pissed in your ramen this morning?</br>  <br> One night stand. </br>  <br><br>Even if this is true, aren't these fights supposed to emulate real fight situations? Making the kids fight without expecting these and then throw them to the real world where they will be fighting people using the machine thingies seems kinda silly.</br></br>  <br>She is probably the mother.</br>  Hiruzen should have done the same to Naruto after he beat Nedgy solely because of the fox bailing him out.  <br> What if those battles were strictly Taijutsu/Ninjutsu? <br>Shikadai was using Shadow Possession and Burrito used Gentle Fist.<br><br>What the fuck is going on here?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Naruto is the new kage, , maybe he or Kakashi applied an "no intend to kill' rule.</br>  <br> tool forbidden in chunnin exams <br> where people have used the most stupid, Op and cheat-like abilities ever <br> an exam whose whole purpose is to test the masters of stealth and underhandedness known as ninjas <br> Yeah, no.</br></br></br></br>  <br>see </br>  This is going to be Burrito and Tenten vs the world because they are the only people smart enough to use technology  <br>Naruto's exam had like two rules and we don't know Boruto's exam rules.</br>  <br>Well it is a relatively new tool and perhaps not in wide usage yet? The one guy who has it is from the R&amp;D department.</br>  <br><br>Nobody's explained the reason, so just forget the spoiler in the meantime. It's so out there and ludicrous.</br></br>  <br>It's the new ninja world, Naruto don't like killing, it's peace everywhere.</br>  Maybe Naruto realized the only way he knows to raise a child is by having him experiencie loneliness and public humilliation.  Daddy Orochimaru and Mitsuki adventures spin-off when?  <br><br>TenTen it's not the mother.<br><br>There's nothing suspicious about it.</br></br></br></br>   Hinata was injured as she was rushing to help Naruto (she was not badly wounded--&gt;saved by Sakura)   <br> What could it possibly do to get banned in a test where there are niggers using magic eye bullshit?</br>  <br>If we make assault jutsus illegal the world be safe. There's no way criminals could ever get their hands on them because they are illegal so we dont need to worry about it.<br><br>Next we need to make it so you must be at least 18 years old to buy Kunai and have proper ID</br></br></br>  What the fuck happened to Kakashi? It's like he became a Kiba-tier character as soon as Coolest Guy permanetly died.  <br>Boruto is a child to be ashamed of with retarded banana hair like that.</br>  <br>We already got a reason. He used a tool forbidden for use in the exam. Whatever the reason may have been, Burrito is a bitch nigga for cheating anyway.</br>  <br>This. Not even Gaara bringing out his inner demon was grounds for disqualification. This fucking exam is bullshit.</br>  so is it true naruto dies or some shit?  <br> test is knife fight <br> faggot brings a shotgun </br></br>  <br><br>This whole fucking movie and almost all the entire manga series is stupid.</br></br>  <br>All ninjas are bitch niggas then.</br>  <br> He used a tool forbidden for use in the exam <br>Like what? Kids are allowed to bring swords and crazy magic powers. Why would a bracelet suddenly be illegal? <br><br>Also the fact that OD hasn't posted anything remotely close to this only increases my doubt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes he's dead. Now Sakura and Sasuke are the main characters.</br>  <br><br>Without Sharingan he has nothing. And now he's retired so he doesn't have to do anything anymore. Though considering what his life has been like, who can blame him.</br></br>  Maybe he was supposed to fight using only his justsus or some shit like that and he cheated by using that tool.  <br> you can use your super overpowered genetic abilities and world ending monsters but using a weapon is against the rules <br><br>Naruto wants to make Tenten illegal</br></br></br>  <br>Coolest Son and Edo Tensei 10/10 when? This is fucking bullshit. I demand a recount.</br>  <br> Naruto wants to make Tenten illegal <br><br>Fanfic intensifies.<br>Ten Ten reviving the Akatsuki 3.0</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not bringing a shotgun to assure victory. <br>Also<br> 2ch trolling about the identity of Mitsuki's &gt;parents. Do not listen to them~! There are no &gt;tweets about people leaving the venues just &gt;yet. </br></br></br>  <br>If the exam was that specific that means Metal Lee can never become a ninja.</br>  <br>inb4 1010 starts revolution because muh 2nd ninja amendment</br>  Tsunade does not seem to appear either in the film.  Disqualification would be okay but what the fuck he takes his headband and tells him he can't be a ninja anymore?<br><br>If this shit's true then I'm on Burrito's side. Fuck Naruto.</br></br>   Sasuke and Sakura watching over the three kids at dusk <br><br>What three kids?</br></br>  <br><br>The whole TenTen going Solid Snake headcanon intensifies.</br></br>  A shocking ending. The inside of the venue is bursting with laughter.  <br><br>Bolt/Sarada/Mitsuki?</br></br>  <br>Boruto, Sarada, and Mitsuki.</br>  <br>The new Akatsuki<br><br>Burrito, Metal Lee, and Sixten</br></br></br>  <br>Mizuki, Sarada and Boruto.</br>  Well shit. Burrito's not wearing his headband when Momo and Kin attack.  <br> it was just Bolt having a nightmare <br>Kishi is cheap enough to pull it off.</br></br>  <br>You do know all of the spoilers might be fake right?</br>  <br><br>This also explains why he decided to wear Sasuke's old scratched headband.</br></br>   Exam has a specific rule <br> Burrito breaks that specific rule <br> OMG BUT PEOPLE DO EVEN MORE BROKEN BULLSHIT ALL THE TIME THIS RULE IS STUPID <br>As stupid as the rule may be, a rule is a rule. <br><br>Disqualify him? Understandable. Humiliate him in front of literally EVERYONE, including people from other villages? Just what the fuck Naruto.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Those eyelashes <br>He looks like a girl there.</br></br>  <br>Remind you of somebody?</br>  <br>Are we sure Momo's not the hero here?<br><br><br>He has his mother's features.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Le Goku is a shit dad epic maymay <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>Not really. Sauce is still bad to his own child.</br>  <br/>  <br>He is a pretty boy. Takes after his mother.</br>  <br> Niggah, these are ninjas we are talking about. Cheating is like one of their specialities.<br> Also, what's the point of making such a retarded rule? It's not like most of them would use that crappy tool anyway.</br></br>  dammit, this is shaping up to be one of the worst movies of this series.<br><br>So much stupid contained.</br></br>  <br> sasuke will never be able to do the fusion dance </br>  <br>And it'd be a great place for him to revive the Akatsuki and depose the mad kage nardo.</br>  <br> Sakura: Sasuke I'm pregnant  <br> Sasuke: Yeah, sorry <br> Sasuke leaves on another 'mission' </br></br></br>  Orochimaru was the best father.  <br><br>You haven't seen anything of it but trailers.</br></br>  <br>It's clearly not that shitty if Boruto decided it was worth the risk of breaking the rule and seemingly also was what gave him the edge over Shikadai.<br><br>It's a All-in-one push a button and spam any element bracelet. It's far from crappy.</br></br></br>  I'm pretty sure the guy who translates the spoilers from Chinese to English doesn't make them or know whether or not they're legit.<br><br>This whole thing about the Chuunin Exams has to be fake.</br></br>  <br>Chinks love to troll and only the trailers have come out.</br>  So I take it there was no teaser for anything else at the end like there was for the Last. Will JUMP editorial really let this be the end of the series?  <br> Mitsuki is the only Team 7 member who doesn't suffer from neglect </br>  <br>Chink spoilers have been wrong before. In the end it's better to get it from a Japanese or better yet a camrip when it actually comes out.</br>  <br>Most Naruto movies are stupid. It's best to have low expectations for them.</br>  <br><br>It's only ok when you are born with broken bullshit. Hardwork and technology isn't allowed.<br><br>Neji was right again</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah. They do this shit all of the time. Not just with anime, but with video games as well<br><br>take these spoilers with a grain of salt</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck it. I'm only trusting the shit OD puts down from now on.</br>  <br> Sounds crappy compared with the kind of bullshit that was pulled during Naruto's chunni exams.<br> Like, why is using a magic tool illegal but using the demon that is sealed inside of you or the super-special snowflake magic eyes isn´t?<br> It's like the faggot is trying to shit on those who weren't born with OP shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Because is obviously not the same exam with the same rules.</br>  <br>It's fake. Just leave it at that.</br>  <br>Considering she uses some of these chink things she says to take the spoilers she posts with a grain of salt. In the end we need to wait for some camrips of a few scenes.</br>  <br> Then the exam is retarded and Naruto is even more retarded for changing it.</br>  <br>Maybe it's not because of the danger factor but to test their individual powers. <br>Since when have ninja tools ever been effective against anything ever?</br></br>  <br>Did you also believe the spoilers that said Hinata was preggers at home while Naruto went off on the action mission that was 90% of The Last?</br>  <br>You don't even know the point of the exam.</br>  <br>aren't all the five villages making the rules?</br>  <br>That would mean anyone like Tenten is just completely banned from competing</br>  In your opinion who is the best anime/manga villain of all time?  Griffith used to be an excellent villain. We'll see if Berserk manages to connect the story threads again before Miura dies.  Yes? Hello.  <br>Surely pic not related? The first friend was kinda interested with the way he was able deceive everyone and made them believe his lies, but second one was bland as fuck, literally a non-character. <br><br>The manga should've ended with the first friend, 2nd part was totally unnecessary.</br></br></br>  Kotomine Kirei without a doubt. The guy is just so fucking empty and twisted.  Hi      <br>Only appears for like 2% of the manga is one dimensional as fuck and shouts memes. 10/10 JoJo literally perfect</br>  <br>So, villains that were right?</br>  <br>I believe this as well. The fact that we didn't even see second Friend's face just cement his role as generic force of evil. Also Kenji should have fucking died.</br>  <br><br>What manga is OPs pic?</br></br>  <br>You can reverse image search it</br>  <br>Got it.
