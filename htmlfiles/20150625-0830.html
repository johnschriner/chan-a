[   All.  Imu    what is your HONEST opinion?    Stopped watching after L died.   Why's that?   Great until L died; shit after. I'm pretty sure that is everyone's opinion.  The entire L arc is practically:  Oh, I'm gonna do X   I'm sure Light is gonna do X   But if I do X perhaps L will think I do it because I am Kira, I'd better do Y   If Light does Y he probably thinks that I think he's Kira so       Light was right.  Didnt really like the part with the N and that other faggot who eats chocolate    Light did nothing wrong   Also the show was great fun, but much less fun after L died.      I liked it when I was in my edgelord phase. Now it's just seems silly.   The ending was retarded. So Near at one point honestly thought Light was just gonna have that Kira worshipper guy just open the door, look at everyone, and write their names down. Seems like they couldn't think of a good way to end it.  I don't know how such a mediocre anime could be discussed so much.  I probably remember it more fondly than it actually deserves, so I refuse to re-watch/read it. Like with Code geass. Also I hated the way they changed the ending slightly.     Well done, but for being called a genius and a prodigy, Light is a fucking idiot.   I thought it was a masterpiece when I was 14  It's average, it really falls apart when L dies. Who gives a fuck about that Near faggot?    8/10 Best shonen ever animated.  You can easily spot a pleb when you see a "everything went to shit after L died" post. Everything got better in the second half; directing, music, character development, etc.    it was entertaining. I lost some intrest after L died, but it was still a good show. 7-8/10  Do you guys often have your watching experience ruined by memes? I was watching Legend of the galactic heroes and it came to this scene. Overall it was pretty dramatic and serious, but then this scene popped up and I started laughing. Anyone else had an experience like this?  No, but I do find it a little strange to finally see scenes like that in context.   tfw the only reason /a/ knows about pic related was because of memes   that and Jojo     Yeah, but JoJo is silly in itself, so it's not that contrasting. Here the scene was rather dramatic.    Every once in a while I'd watch a show from my backlog, and while watching it, see a familiar scene and realize it's the scene from that one reaction imagine I've had for years.  Feels pretty weird.  Just a while ago I found out this scene is from c3bu. I had no idea when I started watching it.       Yes. Watching Haruhi in 2014 was hard.  I always bust out laughing whenever a character says someone is a big guy, even in a roundabout way. I hate that fucking meme.    No because I avoid memesubs. I've had  happen a few times though. It's even weirder when you read a doujin that is the source of a reaction pic you've had for a while     This. Every time I think about the TDKR opening I have to start laughing, though it's gotten a bit better now.    Might as well post it.   No because when I watched LoGH for the first time, even seeing the screenshots, I still was too engrossed in the plot to care     What is the meme with this anyway. It looks like a "She said she was 18" image macro to me.      You might hate baneposting, but it's by far the best thing to ever have come out of /tv/     I should have precised that I don't hate the meme. Bane is king.   This scene in context sort of ruined it, but I still laughed.     SHITPOST H I T P O S T          fuck off  8===========D  Really? You have a picture of Hitler-chan, but no Jew-kun or Stalin-sama? Are you even trying?  We wait for summary anon  Link for those who missed last thread <br/>     I was about to make the thread. I'm looking forward to it too. Chapter 5 hopefully will be good.    It does sound good but it's sad this could be the last summary thread   Good news, the translator is going to translate volume because the summary isn't that detailed this time. I guess that's the end for this drama.   You know, that pisses me off. It's a childlish behavior. But well, I don't wanna cause any more trouble than there is now.    I know but at least we are getting a translation and considering he is the only translator working in DAL we are lucky.    Well I can understand why. Too detailed kind of kills your motivation due to it being pretty much already done. It's why we asked the guy summarizing this to keep it concise. The only part I want in real detail anyways is the Mana section.    but a summary it's no the same as a fully translated novel. Summary anon summaries are good but they still lack some details    and we still need a translator for the short stories.   Waiting.   Gotta day, Kotori's date was great. Yoshino and Natsumi's date are a close second best. Other dates were alright. My least favorite is Miku so far though.     I thought it was better than twin, she actually behaved somewhat normal and didn't go gull retard over Shiori as usual.    Free translations are a bit like the game cracking scene. It's not entirely about providing a service or making a statement, it's about being the first person to do something. Threatening not to translate over too-complete summaries (among other things) is a way of staking a claim.   time for action   Why not translate something else then? Like side stories.    We still have to wait for summary anon  retard     Could be lack of access, but more likely it's lack of interest. If there's other stuff a free translator would rather share, they'll work on that. It's not like they're getting paid.    There is another translator in that forum but he only translates side stories about Kurumi.    I'm ready for the Tohko bullying   OVA any day now.   After season 3.   Yoshino and Kotori dates are the best so far, Miku and the twins dates were weak, Natsumi date was alright.   I don't mind yuri rapist, I rather like that sort of thing. Main issue I always have with Miku is the lack of connection to Shidou. Their interactions rarely click together.    Well that's the problem, the twins who are supposed to be closer to Shidou especially Yuzuru didn't interact with Shidou at all whereas Miku did a decent job.    2 threads  fug, which one    This one has more replies and no waifu wars so far.     no Origami     Fuck, forgot about her. Origami date was also good and her interaction with her other self was interesting.    Still dreaming, anon. It's better than expecting nothing.    Wasn't that the joke? They assumed that their way of attracting Shido had to involve one another when it did not. It wound up being Shido's kink, though.   I can't believe how ass season 2 looked. Especially now that I'm looking at the LN art. Jesus christ   No, they just misunderstood what Reine said.    LEARN TO USE THE CATALOG YOU FUCKING NEWFAG      <br/>          and you realized that just now? You don't even have to read novels for that, just compare S2 art to S1.    Origami is the best date by far anon.  No, Kotori is the worst next to Miku  We need more tohko raep         linking to your dead thread  We are actually discussing stuff in this one.      waifu wars   you fucked that m8       discussing stuff    Posting without even reading the LN   KEK, fuck off secondary also get reported.       Holy shit anon, you are slow.     Waifu war bait topic  Even if I would agree with it, that is a bad topic.     Sorry, we thought it was a bait thread for our sake    or it still is?       Just ignore the shitposter guys      Samefagging OP trying to save his secondary thread.       "no"    That's what I mean. They assumed "ice cream kiss" meant to appeal via twincest power. They were wrong, but they were right at the same time.    You better be trolling. Top 3 dates are Kotori, Yoshino, and Origami. The order doesn't matter so long as they are in the top 3.     samefagging  Look at the posting times and stop shitposting     You're trying too hard and your butthurt is showing because people like this thread over yours.    but that wasn't the point. They were supposed to interact with Shidou like the other girls did.   DAILY REMINDER ELLEN IS A CHEAP WHORE WHO GET BUCKETS OF WESCOTT SEMEN ON HER WOMB EVERY DAY.  So out of curiosity, what do people think the last two Spirits are going to be like? Personality/powers.    Kotori is the worst next to Miku  What? Why? It was short yeah but she showed good chemistry with Shidou     Here we go again, shitpost thread.    Strictly speaking, they're supposed to get him excited. The other girls are using date tactics (except Origami, lol drugs) while Yamai went straight for the dick.   Reminder to ignore the bait posters.    Same 12 IP's   Samefagging with the same IP number trying to save this shit too hard      Hoping the new Spirit from the upcoming movie will be canon and make it to the main story in the LN. She's too much of a seemingly kuudere loli qt to pass up.    This    Just ignore him    Now the thread is shit, thanks to OP who doesn't even read the LN.    by interacting with him. I don't know why you think it was a just when it's clear they just misunderstood everything and Yoshino is the one who was straight for dick.    I thought it was maybe the best, it was the only one who "won" by following her strategy from the start to the end and wasn't help by hazard and luck.   Natsumi was the funniest and cutest after that.      She isn't canon m8.    Now you can't prove that    Phantom = Rinne, Mio = who knows    Check the main cast in the official site, Natsumi is nowhere to be found and this Mayuri girl didn't appear in her arc.    Nah, Shido even agrees that he's already in a state where kisses would seal him. The challenge he made is for the girls to excite him, he never specified how, so long as it's exciting. That's why Origami succeeded by drugging herself and being honest, and why Natsumi could succeed via wardrobe malfunction.  Yoshino wasn't even aiming for a win via eros, she just prepared to have her swimsuit stripped off.    the only one who "won" by following her strategy from the start to the end  This is a good point. Miku had it together, smart girl.          Her name doesn't fit in the main plot.         Samefagging talking to himself   12 same IP    66 post of the same person           but both Origami and Natsumi still interated with Shidou, see the difference? The twins dates was bad because Shidou got excited by just looking at them and that was all, at least Miku was prepared. It's like winning a contest by luck.    OP from the other thread being asspained enough to try to the ruin this thread by shitposting and calling everything samefag   Friendly advice. Ignore this guy.     Yoshino did the same and unlike the other girl she had a trump card.    Nice b8 m8, keep trying OP.    They ALL have won by luck, except Miku. Origami drugging Shido wouldn't have excited him in the same way her drugged honesty did. Natsumi losing her clothes made Shido excited more than her act did. And seeing the twins make out over ice cream... actually wait, they won when they offered to let him lick the melted cream off of their bodies, didn't they?    We're trying to ignore him outright.        That's what we are doing.      Now I am saddened. What a waste of god tier design.       god tier   just a mishmash of animal body parts   What good is that?       Not really, Yoshino had a plan and Reine did say Shidou's exitement was close to 90 then DEM attacked. Kotori managed to win Shidou with that one line.    Her spirit form is a clusterfuck of wings though.    She looks good in uniform, but I do think she looks retarded with all those wings.    She just looks generic without her AstralDress. More specifically, a bleached Kotori.    by that logic then almost every Tsunako must look generic.    Glad you pointed it out.    and Natsumi looks like a green haired Yoshino, this is not new with Tsunako designs.    Well, they all share the sameface after all.    Chapter 5: Spirits' Dance  - The flash of swords fight are seen in the sky. Ellen is using her high-powered laser blade &lt;Caledvwlch&gt; to block an attack from Mana's &lt;Wolf's Tail&gt;. Ellen used the opening after blocking Mana's attack. Mana quickly evaded and countered Ellen's attack before she could release her next one. - They have been continuing this exchange for a while. While Mana's &lt;Wolf's Tail&gt; that covered a real blade with Magic Power is not as powerful as Ellen's &lt;Caledvwlch&gt; which manifested the blade using Magic Power alone, but its lower Magic Power consumption allow Mana to better engage in a long battle.  - Since nobody in this world could match Ellen's Magic Power output, Mana decided to fight with Ellen with her techniques instead. Mana keep attacking Ellen without break. However, even now there is not a single wound on Ellen's body. - However Mana's objective since the beginning is not to defeat Ellen, but to buy some time until Kotori and others succeed in saving Shidou. - When Mana is thinking that she could buy enough time for them if she keep this pace, that moment, the &lt;Ratatoskr&gt;'s facility below her started illuminating and a ray of light is released to the sky. Mana feel a shock wave from her back.  "…What!?"  - Mana widen her eyes. Even though the shock wave did not blown her away thanks to Territory, her attention diverted to her back for a second. And spit moment is enough for Ellen to give her a fatal attack.   "You're full of openings." "Ku —"  - Mana blocked the attack but she couldn't completely cancel the power of it and got thrown to the ground. She quickly use her Territory as a buffer to absorb the impact. The ground is then wrapped like there is an invisible ball pushed onto it.  "Ku… you've done me. …But what was the earlier?"  - Mana said that and looked around her surroundings. She then choked at Shidou who is floating on the air, covered by the light of Spirit Power.                       It's time    Is he going to Kamehameha again?    Oh shit.    Alright here we go    Where the fuck is the Fraxinas? fighting those robot things? Also it's happening!     wrapped  warped?    Miku is worst girl   Please, plase!!!! Shidou, show some strenght now!    Welcum back    Fuck off.    Read the LN.    Being repaired, isn't it?    I hope, or even better a spirit bomb.    I guess Ellen is too strong even for Mana and where are the jobbers anyway?    but Reine said she and the crew are going to stop DEM attack I was expecting a comeback or something.    I don't want it to end    How about the SPECIAL BEAM CANNON?   okay I'm done now. How bad is Shido about to get wrecked?       He's going berserk so I doubt he will do the speam light beam, not even Ellen can stop him now.    I think you mean  how bad is Ellen's pussy about to get wrecked?      She said they had a plan for if DEM interfered, and it's Mana. Who was buying time for girls to suck their Spirit power out of Shido's mouth one by one.  Who instead came out to flirt with Ellen. Aggressively.      Oh well, maybe I expected too much from these guys but Mana is in danger now    Hopefully, Ellen is getting rekt this chapter.    Yeah, fuck ellen     It's pathetic how such a big organization as Ratatsokr only has one battleship.     It's an all-volunteer staff of perverts, there's no way they're going to have a magitek battleship fixed in a month.    Mana can't die, she is too important and must be saved.    I would imagine that it's also a chore to build such a large Realizer, let alone an airship to accommodate it.    Why not just get another ship? It seems like DEM has more than one but what about Ratatoskr.   I hope Ellen dies.   or maybe the lack resources and funds. DEM has an army of wizard and those robots while Ratatoskr only has Mana and the Fraxinas.     final boss   dying this early      Please tell me she isn't the final boss. that's pretty pathetic if so    DEM also has the AST but no one remembers them.    She isn't, I'm just saying she is the right hand of the final boss so I doubt she will die.    DEM is a large multinational corporation run by an eccentric evil genius. Ratatoskr is a secret organization with quarreling private backers. Huge difference in the relative available resources.     Westcott is the final boss or Phantom if it turns out she is actually evil.     Except Wescott isn't the only high ranked member in DEM and it doesn't look like he shares the same ideologies.    Good, doujins when?    I do.    No, but he is the highest ranking, and when his people get out of line he has the means to force them to follow him again.  Elliot has nowhere near as much control over his own people, and is more dependent on them, which is why they can make plans to attack Shido and he can't shut it down.       Probably never t.t     I thought Elliot was only one of the funders of Ratatoskr but not the main boss.    Could be, I assumed he was the founder/Chairman.    Rape doujins    I think it was also stated Ratatoskr has corrupt member as well in the first 4 volumes.   Kotori is a traitor   I hope next arc has more Mana    Is that Reason they thought a plan to kill Shidou knowing he is the only one who can seal spirit?    You're still forcing that?    She accepted the mission to kill Shidou, that's an act of treason to me.    "Nii-sama!?"  - Shidou then turned his eyes toward Mana. Shidou looked absent-minded, his conscious is vague, as if he has been drugged with something. Shidou then open his mouth while looking at Mana,  "Ah — Mana. *I'm glad. So you were fine.*"  - Shidou said that to her with a gentle voice. Mana knitted her eyebrows feeling something is off at what he just said. On the surface it sounds like Shidou is worrying about her body. - That is understandable, since at this very moment, Mana is still fighting with Ellen and got a serious blow from her just earlier. - However — for some reason, Mana thought that what Shidou said just now is not only that. Shidou then unconsciously continue his words,  "I was… worried about you. Ever since you've been kidnapped by those DEM guys… but I'm glad… I'm really glad…" "Kidnapped? Nii-sama, what do you mean?" "— Where… is *Mio*? Didn't she helped you out?" "What are you talking about, Nii-sa —"  - Mana stopped her words. Mana suddenly feel a pain in her head. She push her forehead with her hand and frown. She knew this is not just a headache. — The moment Shidou said "Mio" a scene she never seen before started flashing up in her head.  "T…This is…"  - Mana saw a scene in her head changing like a camera shutter. The park where she play with her friend. The teacher teaching in the class. Her birthday where Shidou celebrate for her.   And — the back of a girl with long hair.  "Ah…"  - The moment Mana saw that in her head, she feel her view is flashing on and off. For some reason, Mana couldn't remembered the girl's face. She knew she know her, but —                             - And that was when something interrupted her thought. Mana heard Ellen's voice from above her,  "— Lost in your thought in front of me? You underestimated me a bit too much."  - But that was already too late. Ellen already swing up her &lt;Caledvwlch&gt; next to Mana. Mana quickly tried to concentrate, but she can't make it in time. She prepared for the pain from Ellen's laser blade. - Before the laser blade could reach Mana, the Spirit Power that covered Shidou swelled up and stopped the Magic Power blade. Ellen make a dubious looks at stare at Shidou irritatedly.   "— Itsuka Shidou. Don't you looks wonderful now. Even though I don't know what happened, I can see why Ike is wanting you that much."  - Ellen lift up the tip of her lips. However, in contrast to her, Shidou only make a grim looks,  "D—E…M…!"  - Shidou started breathing heavily and howled like a beast.   "U — Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"  - The next moment, the Spirit Power that curled around Shidou increased its intensity and blown away both Ellen and Mana who were nearby.   "…!" "What!?"  - Mana used her Territory to absorb the impact and stopped mid-air. She raise up her voice,  "Nii-sama! What is this! And what was earlier — who is Mio-san!?"  - However, Shidou didn't replied back to her. He only continued growling like a beast. Even though Mana wanted to ask him more about it, the person confronting her right now is the world's strongest Wizard. She can't let down her guard even for a second. Mana grind her teeth and averted her eyes away from Shidou.                              Oh shit, he remembers?     Ellen getting rekt soon      Shiiiit      At least this confirms Mana does have a past.     BASAKA!     long hair  So Phantom's name is Mio, huh?     SHOCKING TRUTH    Prolly? it might be about something like the case when Origami during the world that what changed like, her memories on hating spirits appearing if she senses a spirit power. I guess in Shidou's case it triggers with DEM?.... There might be a case where we get a changing of the past that lead Shidou's memory and Mana's memory to be wiped out. Luckily Mana had that photo of her to remember Shidou.   I guess this Mio is phantom? or might not be.       Holy shit!      Fuck, now we have even more questions than before.      Different girls m8s. Phantom is free but this girl is captured.     That also works with the "this time I'll get shit right" stuff phantom was saying.     &gt;And — the back of a girl with long hair.    &gt;Nii-sama! What is this! And what was earlier — who is Mio-san!?"    Plot Detected. I repeat, Plot Detected!          Either Phantom or the second Spirit. If Mio was supposed to help Mana, it makes sense that they'd both have been captured.     Where did it say Mio was the captured spirit?     First Phantom and now this, are they the same or just a coincidence we can't see the faces?     That's "Rio" no "Mio"     The spoilers     The fact that they took the effort to point out the long hair thing both here and with Toobitchy makes me lean more towards Phantom.    Their names are not even similar and Rio is Shidou daugther in that game.    Yeah, it might be that she used zafkiel that time, thus the reason having a connection with Kurumi, and why Kurumi knows phantom. LEL I just thought of this. Mana wants Kurumi Kurumi wants Shidou Shidou wants Phantom some crazy love rectangle we have here.         WAIT REALLY?!   Could Mio be Shidou's  another little sister?      I know. I just wanted to post a Spirit with Long Hair.      So it seems that before Shidou was adopted by the Itsukas, Shidou and Mana had an encounter with DEM which ended up with Mana being captured and kidnapped and both knew a Mio who probably is a spirit means that Shidou and Mana probably both could use spirit power. At least the both of them are NOT normals.    He didn't remember anything in volume 7, it must be the the high fever and the spirits power going berserk breaking the memory wipe.     Maybe      implying phantom was free   implying phantom wasn't manipulating kurumi with projection powers to break her out of DEM's rape dungeon.      At least Shidou can but there is no implication that Mana can use spirit powers so far considering her condition.   it's that time of day again and remember kids  Kaguya a cutie     Oh. I'm the one who suggested it in the last thread, so I was thinking this was confirmation.   Wouldn't have had the sephira crystals then.       Phantom was also in the past and she has been turning girls into spirits.    Yeah. I was just pointing it out after he sealed Origami, after all he sealed Origami while inversed. It's the first time Shidou sealed a spirit inversed first. (What I meant was, the time he sealed inverse Tohka, that was the second time.) in Origami's case, it's the first time, and it was inversed, might be the reason why the spirit's power is wrecking havoc inside Shidou. Not to mention he sealed Tohka for the third time during the fight with Origami in her Angel form. I guess it has something to do with why the spirit's power is malfunctioning inside him.    No, she is  Shidou's real childhood friend     No, but if you think about it, Mana survived an operation that only shortened her life span to 10 years while Jessica had that same operation and would only live to see the next day. Mana is strange for a human since I see Jessica is more of a norm with this type of operation.     Mission given to her by the higher ups   to me  Glad the retardation starts and stops with you.       (What I meant was, the time he sealed inverse Tohka, that was the second time.)  What?     Jessica's operation was worse, Mana noticed this during their fight she was also using inferior equipment compared to Mana's but the magic energy inside Jessica allowed her to fight Mana in equal terms for a time.    Uhh. I think I explained it less? Sorry about that. First. Shidou met Tohka,(normal mode). She sealed Tohka (normal mode). Second. Tohka getting kidnapped, Tohka went inverse. Shidou sealed inverse Tohka.  Origami's case. Shidou met Origami as &lt;Angel&gt;. Failed to seal, even went inverse. -World Change Shidou met Origami. &lt;Devil&gt; manifested, sealed Origami while inversed.  ..Did I explained it less again? Sorry if I am not good at explaining what I had in mind.               That would be Kotori's nightmare.    Said mission was only if he got to the same point as inverse Origami. IE completely beserk with no way to regain his sanity. He wouldn't be Shidou any more at that point.    I understand but what does that have to do with Shidou losing control over his powers? This was going to happen sooner or later and Ratatoskr knew it.    Sighs*************** Shidou can't seal inverse types... what he has to do is return them back to being normal. The kiss with Tohka is te one which made her come back. In Oriagmi's case, she came back by herself and then Shidou kissed her to seal her powers.   If Mio is Phantom then who the fuck is Material A?   Wait an d see     Sighs***************  Fuck off     That's just a speculation. I think Mio is most likely &lt;Material A&gt; leaving phantom's identity unknown. I think that fits better.     Sighs***************  Faggot.  What Shidou did in both Origami and Tohka cases was trying to get their old personalities back because the kiss doesn't work if the girls is not compatible with Shidou.       It was already established that Kotori's nightmare is Shidou as a full female. Why do you think that she literally went all white eyed when she groped Shiori's breasts and found them to be real?    It's just a dumb speculation, It's clearly stated Mio was captured yet Phantom is free and turning girls into spirits.    And people claim that summer isn't real *facepalm*    What the fuck is wrong with you?    You can have more than one fear anon.    That's what I was implying lol! "Return them back to being normal", how did you translate that?   Miku is worst girl   It's gonna happen sooner or later, I just thought that it might be the reason for it happening. I didn't say it wouldn't happen. I just thought it's the reason why it happened.    Given her locket it was after he was adopted for at least a year.    that Shidou can't seal inverse spirit when he can, the only thing he has to do is to free the girls from the dark energy control or despair in Origami's case. The dark energy doesn't disappear just like that.    True, but that one I described there would be her biggest one. The only other nightmare would be to actually have to kill Shidou.   Anyone remembered that bit about Shidou was in despair the first year he is taken into Itsuka family in volume 1? What if it connects with all these Mio stuff somehow?  They got their personalities back, but they were still as inverse powers, and it's just my speculations, and do remind me cuz I don't know which part they said that Shidou can't seal inverse types.  Cuz if I remember correctly when Tohka was on inverse and she saw Shidou falling to her, she became conscious and she's still wearing that inverse astral dress. There wasn't a point where I remember that it was stated her inverse astral dress grew back to her normal one.     I doubt that's reason, Kotori and the fraxinas were surprised back then in volume 7 when Tohka turned inverse. I suppose they didn't expect to deal with dark spirits.    Alright, understood. But there's no need to insult me. (I say it to the others)    He also was abandoned and separated from Mana.    You're really not from here aren't you?     Rio better be canon or else I'll be upset.     literally who cares though     Yeah, I guess his despair would be about Mana's kidnapping and whatever happened to Mio and that he was powerless to do anything about it.     yeah I guess, they weren't expecting to deal with inverse types.   I can pinpoint the moment a thread will turn to shit, am I a wizard /a/?   Rinne    No, why?    Well, his mind was wiped right after he saw his sister kidnapped and lost his childhood friend, and then he was left behind with the Itsukas.  He probably doesn't remember most of the reason he was sad.  That said I will die laughing if he knew Tohka before.       Yeah, I'm a newbie just been here for 7-8 days. I was the one who made the thread of yesterday and everybody was arguing that I made it too early. I learned my lesson.    and what if Shidou ends up getting all his memories back and decides to spend time with Mana?    Wasn't Tohka confirmed yonger than 1 year?     lol  Literally kill yourself.     Actually I fucked up, thing aren't going well, disregard my post. I hold on the next time.    Nope, you are right. The sword and inverse dress only disappeared after Shidou kissed Tohka in volume 7.    Go fuck yourself. And stay in that shithole where you're from.    Tohka knows nothing of herself except that she suddenly existed. and when she existed the AST attacked her. iirc.    Databook stuff? Because her mind is completely empty of prior knowledge.    What do you mean? I don't see any shitposting in this conversation.    Oh that thread worked out fine though  There's no arbitrary rules about threads. Sometimes they just will be dead and no one posts depending on hours.      I do.    Are you a girl?    Kotori doesn't mind that too much, so long as he spends time with her as well. Mana already treats Kotori as the youngest sibling of the 3(though the reason for that is kinda funny).     woah, you guys sure are edgy and hardcore XD      Toha didn't know about the workd iirc, even Yoshino was familiar with it.     Do you think I'm from Animetsuki, saw the discussion yesterday thruthfully speaking, didn't even know there was a website like that. Alright, not gonna argue with you. I'm leaving already.    Because her chest is bigger, right? but I what I meant is what if Shidou changes after getting her memories and spends more time with Mana than the girls.    Retard    Oh, I see. Well all of what I'm saying is just what a speculation. Unless we really know it from the author, I don't have any right to say it's accuracy.    Because the only thing she remembers about herself is she just came into existence randomly. Every time she appeared there was a spacequake and the AST attacked her. That was her life    world**   Flatori a shit   Mana's locket says otherwise. The Shidou in the picture is 10 he was adopted when he was younger then 9.     Are you a girl?     I wanted to write "thread is going well" but since I have the sun reflexion on my screen I didn't saw shit and didn't correct my sentence.  I'm pretty much the one shitposting now so I will keep quiet for the rest of the thread.    Please guys, avoid getting mad over trivial things and keep discussing the summary.   Yup, you hit the nail on that one. Shidou would most likely split his time evenly with all of the girls though he might insist on Mana staying at the Itsuka house though.  At least in this volume Kotori got to experience not being flat for once, though it was in the form of Shiori to do so.      Was he that age for sure? I thought the locket pic was taken the same year, and then the tragedy happened, and there really isn't much difference between looking nine and looking ten.    What about Mana's picture?     It's very relevant stuff dude.     Kotori said by that time Shidou was already in the Itsuka house.    That's nice wallpaper.    Time travel and the Kaleidostick.  I'd forgotten that.    Needs more Miku pure love    This confirms Shidou and the boy in the picture are the same but doesn't explain why he was with Mana and Kotori.     Wasn't it the same for Yoshino?   Kaguya a cutie  Does Da'at have an inverse form?      namefag  You are getting more autistic. I guess I shouldn't be surprised considering Kaguya is also autistic.     YUZURU is better   Miku is worst girl    Holy shit! I want to know how this is gonna turn out.      Can someone post DAL angel tree?     This anon knows.

Where is Mana living in this timeline?   she still a cutie  When is Shidou going inverse?   Not a spirit    I don't think he can    Play the second game.    Which one? I have so many versions just in case.     Nope.       Retarded slut    Are you sure? Even if he is only half spirit, something should happen if he feels despair while having all that power.    - In the party hall where it is now destroyed by the light of Spirit Power, Kotori raise up her voice asking if everyone is okay while couching at the cloud of dust. The attack earlier opened a large hole in the ceiling and the wall. - Kotori looked around. The Spirits and &lt;Ratatoskr&gt; staff are all safe. The Spirits raise up their voices, "Are you okay~!?" "…W-what was that". Kotori then heard an unexpected voice,  "— Kotori-san!" "This voice… Mana!? What are you doing…!"  - In front of Mana there is Ellen in CR-Unit confronting her, holding a sword. Mana fixed her stares at her and wave her hand to Kotori a little to reply to her. Mana expand her &lt;Wolf's Talk&gt; on her right hand and raise up a voice,  "I'll tell you the story later! For now… I'm leaving Nii-sama to you!"  - Mana then kicked the air and continue her fight with Ellen. Kotori then realized that she was the 'countermeasure' Reine talked about.   "That girl… and she disappeared without even telling me her address…!"  - However Kotori is thankful that Mana deal with Ellen for her. Kotori decided to fulfill Mana's request and looked at Shidou,  "Ah…"  - Kotori unconsciously let out that voice. Over there is not the usual gentle Shidou nor the playboy Shidou from earlier. Kotori wasn't so she can call 'the thing' that is floating while releasing a five-colored lights a human anymore.  - The dense Spirit Power that whirled around Shidou is blinking on and off like a pulse. The ground, the air, everything is vibrating in the same rhythm as that pulse. Kotori feel as if everything is resonating to Shidou's power. - Not only that, some part of the Spirit Power around him has been transformed into a screen of light or a piece of metal. It almost looked like a Spirit with her Astral Dress.                        The normal and inverse one     no white pupils     Nice try     It almost looked like a Spirit with her Astral Dress.  HAPPENING.     No date for Tohko     "That girl… and she disappeared without even telling me her address…!"  What? Is Mana hiding from Kotori or something?     Slutty retards don't get dates    It's time     Kotori wasn't so she can call 'the thing' that is floating while releasing a five-colored lights a human anymore.  Fuck, I want a colored illustration for this.     Nah, looks like even Kotori doesn't know where Mana's living.    He is getting his equivalent to an astral dress but there is no illustration? This is a crime.    but Reine does? That's weird.    Only shiori can be seen in a astral dress    Retard.    Phantom confirmed    The twins got one.    moron.    Reine knows everything there is to know. Can't wait for her arc    Kaguya did nothing wrong    Ellen getting rekt when?    Thats not Natsumi or Ellen     Shidou has unleashed ZA BEASTO mode and called upon his Astral Dress/Armor upon sighting DEM. He wants to rekt Ellen presumably for what DEM did to him in his past.     He's getting an armour or something?    Given Da'at would have the same dress as Kurumi be glad (or not) there is no picture.    We don't how he looks right now but at least we can assume her suit/dress is more than just clothes.    Best twin imo.    Kurumi's dress doesn't have pieces of metal.    The latest version of normal and inverse please     Implying loli Natsumi isn't at least high tier  I'll cut you.     Actually his would be similar to in name as Kurumi's(Elohim vs YHVH Elohim) but the designs would be more like Origami's, Miku's, or Tohka's since Da'at lies on the same branch of the tree that Keter, Yesod, and Malkuth resides on(presumably No. 6 Tipharet would have a similar design as the other 3 spirits in that it would have light emitting from the dress).    She is a bitch, still better than Miku.    This one?    Natsumi is mediocre as hell. Someone the series could honestly just remove and nothing would change     wrecked Shidou's reputation   high tier   Wat       Waiting for Phantom    Close I was thinking the one with the spirits picture on them   Miku is worst girl   Well, you could use that, I guess. Just needs a bit of cleaning.  Actually, screw that. No one besides Tohko and Paper are inversed. There's no reason for everyone else to.      I don't think we have a version with the inverse spirits.   I wonder if Shidou will destroy Ellen now   Natsumi pls    Okay could you still post the angel tree    It seems like Mana is still fighting Ellen but I wonder if Shidou is able to think rationally with all that power.    This is the latest version, right?     no Origmami  No it fucking isnt     Fuck, wrong one.    I saw one with Origami in the crown position.    Someone posted the checklist you can search the pic here     Though we might need to place Shidou into the tree soon into the spot that connects Origami, No.2, and Kurumi.    Makes me wonder whose number six    the 2 should be the same Kurumi's should be YHYH Elohim as well they have shortened a few of the astral dresses names    We need to know his position first and I mean a real confirmation.    Not going to lie, I always thought that was Shido himself.    Phantom    There's indirect confirmation that he is Number 11 with his first name containing the number 11 in it.    Why? The yellow eyes, Shidou being Da'at is still just speculation but he has 11 in his name and the fact he can seal spirits fits with Da'at.    Reine    Rinne    I thought this theory was discarded a long time ago.    Shidou is 2 Mio is Shiori aka Shidou's other half.    If Mio is blonde then it should be her. So far all spirits hair color has match up to their sephirot. The 2 unknown colors are 2 gray and 6 yellow      Bash older Natsumi all you want, but real loli Natsumi is too cute and amusing to even seriously hate. Her design is great anyhow.      We still don't know his angel name(if he has one) or astral dress/armour(if you can call that armour)    Because Tiphareth is also yellow and describes the state of Grace, which means purification and also forgiveness of sin or clenasing.    Sorry but I don't choose what girl is good or bad based on cuteness.    but it doesn't fit with Shidou's name and the hidden name, or the fact he can seal spirits.   Mana is best imouto   Well, at the very least the part about grace would, since he's freeing them to live in peace. Though, alternatively, it could also refer to Phantom creating the Spirits in the first place so they be closer to god.    Natsumi is a like a spoiled brat, her logic is also dumb.    Isn't Phantom turning girls into spirits for Shidou's sake?     &gt;Not only that, some part of the Spirit Power around him has been transformed into a screen of light or a piece of metal. It almost looked like a Spirit with her Astral Dress.   Almost there...      - And the next moment after Kotori saw Shidou's looks, Kotori heard a ominous alarm from her Incom. It is not the same one they used for Space Quake, nor the one they used for when Spirits get emotionally unstable.  - It is the alarm Kotori have heard only once. And that was when they told her to remember it during testing, saying it would be the best if she never hear it. - Kotori feel her fingers trembling slightly. She feel like the is a crack in her very existence. Her heart started beating fast. Breathing become difficult. Her view started distorting. Kotori feel like it's difficult for her to just standing still. - Kotori's conscious were disrupted by the sound of the alarm of the demise for few moments. That was when Shidou raise up a howling. The Spirit Power around him are sparkling like an electric discharge, lighting up the surroundings. - Shidou kicked the floor up to the ground. The height between the ground and underground facility is nothing to him. Shidou mowed down the tree and started moving to somewhere.  "Kotori-san! Are you okay! We should follow Darling!" "……"  - Kotori raise up her face at Miku's words. Kotori tried opening her mouth, but no words are coming out. Kotori can't say it because saying it would means she decided to do perform something absolutely worst.  - However, Kotori have to say it. For this world. For humanity. And for Shidou himself. It is the mission of &lt;Ratatoskr&gt;'s commander — the responsibility of the one who have been saved by Shidou five years ago. Kotori open her mouth, tried to keep the shake in her voice to minimum,  "…Everyone please standby here. — I'll do something." "Standby? Let us do something." "Agreement. This is unlike Kotori."  - When Kotori said that, the Spirits looked at her with a surprised expression. Kotori don't surprise at their reaction. Kotori would be the same if someone said this to her, with her don't know the circumstances. However Kotori can't have their accompany.                    So she claims. Is it for his sake, or what she thinks he needs?    Will he be able to recognize who is enemy and who is ally? Because Mana could be in danger.    Kotori is a traitor     &gt;it would be the best if she never hear it.   This chapter is seriously going places.      Yeah, kill Shidou in front of the spirits. What's the worst that could happen?    Angel typically associated with Da'at is Uriel and Astral Dress/Armor would be YHVH(though probably here they would use Adonai like Natsumi and Tohka) Elohim. My guess with the shape that Uriel will take for Shidou would be a sword that in its base form can channel fire, light, and lightning and judging from the description of how his Astral Dress/Armor would look like a male variation of Tohka's dress. I guess he would be the Paladin of repentance and salvation based off of what Uriel does.    I doesn't look like she has bad intentions and there is that line she said in volume 11.    That's why she told them to stay behind. Like, don't get me wrong, that's not much better, but she's not stupid.    Two things: 1. Holy shit! 2. I've seen the word "electric" paired up with Shidou since the Instant Lightning Blast attack. Shidou's power has something to do with electricity.      Well, Uriel's OTHER job is purgation and the spreading of plagues or just killing everything.  So, Inverse?      Threat level should be SS or SSS if that's the maximum. Angel, Astral dress and Spacequake scale are unknown.   Reminder that 2's spirit waves and someone else were almost the same. That means that either Shidou or Phantosm are a part of 2. Considering that Shidou got berserk when 2 got close you can make your own conclusions.   "— As I said, it is for me to do something with Shidou. Just leave it to me. &lt;Ratatoskr&gt; already prepared something for a case like this."  - The Spirits nodded to her while still feeling a little unease. Kotori answered to them and walk up stair up to the ground. Shidou is still moving while mowing down the tree. If he continues, no doubt he would reach the town.  - Kotori looked at Shidou and take out the terminal from her dress's pocket. It is the key of destruction she sworn to herself to never use. Kotori manipulate the terminal with her shaking fingers. - She scanned her fingerprint, then scanned her retina, input the password and placed her finger on the button. The button that activates &lt;Dainslaif&gt;, the satellite weapon that always aiming at Shidou.  "…I'm sorry, Onii-chan"  - Kotori let her words out.   "Please forgive me… who can't find another ending."  - However, that moment, Kotori feel a murderous intent coming from her left side. The next moment, a gun is pressed onto her forehead. - Kotori moved her eyes to that direction. Over there, Origami who should still be in the underground facility is looking to her with a dangerous eyes with her 9mm gun. Origami open her mouth with a cold and calm voice,  "What is that thing in your hand. What are you going to do to Shidou? Itsuka Kotori, you —"  - Origami stopped her words mid-sentence. Origami moved her brows a little. Kotori understand that it might be because Origami saw her face. The face that is full of tear and snivel and a painful expression. Origami continued while knitting her brows.   "…Explain. What does this means." "…I'm going to kill Shidou." "Is that also &lt;Ratatoskr&gt;'s order?" "…You're only half correct."  - Kotori knew that Origami is smart. She wouldn't allow Kotori to smooth it over, and even if Kotori forcibly do it, she would try her best to stop her from doing. Kotori then continue her explanation in desperation.                            Don't be a bad imouto Kotori.     &gt;Threat level should be SS or SSS   Agreed. If he triggered 'that' alarm then it means things are going down when Shidou goes to town.      Origami a best.    I don't think they are so stupid to not realize what's happening outside, this can't end well either way.    Origami a smart    Fuck off Kotori    but the power inside Shidou belongs to the girls, not him. If the waves were similars doesn't that mean she is the one who is part of something else?   Kotori can only control her power for a very short amount of time and then goes berserk herself and against Berserk-Shidou, I don't think she has a chance of winning/killing him.   Kotori worst girl    Reversed roles.    As expected of Kotori. Mana is the only true imouto    Origami best girl protecting Shidou, Kotori is a bad imouto.    I never said it was a good plan, just that SHE wasn't stupid.   That's why she has a satellite laser.       I would feel Chronozon would be Shidou's Maou for his inverse. Also gives Kurumi more relevance if Shidou ever goes inverse as it is said that the Goddess Babylon keeps Chronozon sealed and Babylon is under Kurumi's influence.    This Origami turned out to be better than I expected.   reminder why Kotori is shit    &gt;"Please forgive me… who can't find another ending."   Date-a-Live has an strange way to remind you that this is based on a dating game system even in the most intense moments.  It's Awesome.        He was always considered the biggest threat, just look how Ratatoskr is racting.    Nice bit of thinking.  Wait a second, doesn't Kurumi have a bullet that can do stuff with memories?      If Shidou is Da'at then Chronozon must be his inverse.      Kotori is going dark knight   Takes the burden and sin    Kotori a BEST.        You mean the bullet that allows her to watch past memories?    Kotori is a traitor    Kotori proving she is best imouto. Stopping her onii-chan from becoming a monster who kills and rampage the world, and she will probably end her life after she kills the one she loves most.    Remove Kotori.    Yeah, it's kinda sad if you think about it: he's giving it his all to seal all the spirits and Ratatoskr is prepared to throw him away as if they have a few more Shidou's ready to take his place, but if he's the only one with the ability to seal spirit's and the Spirit Power goes back to the spirit's after his "death", then I don't understand why Ratatoskr even considered saving the spirit's - everything would have been for nothing.   So what if they actually kill Shidou and the spirits go inverse? Are they going to kill them too?   this isn't going to happen.  But they might have to?      How many characters invoke serious life and death drama and conflict? My count is Tohka, Origami, and Kotori.     Trying to fight against 7-8 Inverse Spirits at once  I wonder what could possibly go wrong.      implying Ratatoskr are good guys         Fuck off. I'm onto you.        Just drop bombs all over elevens.    If this would happen, then I'd say yes, 'cause they would never be able to control so many Inverse-type Spirits   Ai getting the dick when?     Well, they have that weapon Kotori is about to use but it makes me wonder, if the knew this was inevitable. Why seal the spirits?   I like Kotori, but honestly, the author should include more Mana, because I like her as much.   Especially in regards to both Tohka and Origami if Kotori had succeeded and killed Shidou with the Satellite Cannon, then most likely would have committed suicide afterwards to stave off both going inverse and penance for killing her beloved brother is that without Shidou both of them would go inverse fast. The other Spirits can hold it off a little longer but would eventually have nothing left to live for and would go inverse too.    Is she a spirit?    Yep. It's probably the key to figuring out what happened those years ago.   Because they figure they have a better option so they should use it.  But what if it makes the person doing the sealing explode? I remember reading that if Rinne detonated she'd vaporize Japan. Spirits don't do much damage, all things considered, if the population can evacuate soon enough. The realizers can replace the property, and no one dies. It's way better to have Spirits wandering around attacking things than to let an entire country explode.          choosing duty over family  Disgusting    Time for lewd Origami   What about Mana? I don't think she will be able to endure and forgive the fact Ratatoskr killed Shidou.    Gross   Miku is worst girl    Following orders per training   traitor      I didn't play the VN and I never considered the possibility that Shidou could explode. It must not happen, but if the possibility exists, then I can understand why Ratatoskr is so afraid of Shidou going berserk. All the Spirit Power inside of him could lead to an explosion almost on the same scale as the Spacequake 30 years ago, if you ask me.    "…Shidou right now is a time bomb. The Spirit Power within him rapidly expanded. If we leave him like this, it would be an explosion even larger than the South Kanto incident." "…. And that's why you're killing him?" "…Yes. That's the final job of me who have 'failed'. If Shidou is killed before he is at his limits, then we can keep the explosion to minimal. It's a choice between seeing ten millions of people and Shidou die, or seeing only Shidou dies. If someone tell me to choose, I'll choose the latter. — Because even Shidou, he probably don't want to see such many people die because of him." "……"  - Origami's finger is shaking. Kotori turned her eyes back to Shidou,  "If I press this button, &lt;Dainslaif&gt; on the satellite orbit will released its Magic Power cannon." "&lt;Dainslaif&gt;…?" "…The cursed sword that used every detail of Shidou's body data, made to kill Shidou and only Shidou alone."  - That is the &lt;Dainslaif&gt;. Kotori don't know a worse way to use Realizer. Even if Shidou has Kotori's regeneration power, he can't regenerate himself if every single bit of his body are destroyed.  "…Don't mess around. Is this the &lt;Ratatoskr&gt;'s way of doing things? Kill him once he can no longer keep the Spirit Power that were sealed within him? Before that, the one who made Shidou seal Spirits' Spirit Power was &lt;Ratatoskr&gt;. They used him for their own purpose, and once he become inconvenient to them, they're going to get rid of him? Even though you thought of Shidou that much, why did you agreed to —" "— No!"  - Kotori raise up her voice stopping Origami's words.  "Even though Shidou's power miraculously matched with &lt;Ratatoskr&gt; objective — but at least Woodman chairman do worry about him. He said nothing good will come out of sealing Spirit's power in human body. He suggested us to find another way to do it. But… it was already too late. The moment Shidou was found out by &lt;Ratatoskr&gt;, he already sealed one Spirit within him."                      Yeah, her too. Though the inverse spirits alone would destroy the world before she gets a chance to shank Ratatoskr.    Considering Shidou has 7 spirits sealed the amount of power would be enough to create a big spacequake.     "…Shidou right now is a time bomb. The Spirit Power within him rapidly expanded. If we leave him like this, it would be an explosion even larger than the South Kanto incident."  I guess that confirms the thing about Shidou exploding.     Kotori is right.    Confirmed!   The Spirit Power within him rapidly expanded. If we leave him like this, it would be an explosion even larger than the South Kanto incident."         inb4 Ratatoskr is evil       The moment Shidou was found out by &lt;Ratatoskr&gt;, he already sealed one Spirit within him.  Shidou sealed a Spirit before Tohka !?      Kotori     Yeah, I was like "Srsly? 27s after my post it's confirmed? Holy shit!" and flipped my tablet     "Even though Shidou's power miraculously matched with &lt;Ratatoskr&gt; objective — but at least Woodman chairman do worry about him. He said nothing good will come out of sealing Spirit's power in human body. He suggested us to find another way to do it. But… it was already too late. The moment Shidou was found out by &lt;Ratatoskr&gt;, he already sealed one Spirit within him."  So they didn't know about the sealing, then what is Shidou?     Retard     Because even Shidou, he probably don't want to see such many people die because of him."  Close enough to what I've been calling for years over the theory as to why Kotori said she will kill Shidou in volume 5.     Kotori dummy.    Tohka, stop posting on 4chan.    Who knows but maybe Shidou kissed Mio, Mana or even Kotori.   so what would they have done if they never found Shido?   Kinda figured it had to be something like this. Like, Ratatoskr isn't actually crazy so what reason would they have to go through with this? Made sense when you think of it from that angle.   Ask Phantom. Ratatoskr's board members mention in the earlier volumes that they thought it was suspicious how convenient he was.       Kotori..... did you forget?    Tohka pls.    it was Kotori you faggots    Now imagine if Tohka's so dumb because she saves her brainpower for funposting on 2ch.  More Yuzuru's thing I know.     They would have go the AST and fight spirits or maybe not considering they lack equipment and members to form an army.    Try to kill them?    Surgery.  Or done their best to normalize them in other ways. Might have worked for Yoshino, but never any of the others.      Retards can't use the internet    Yet you are here    Kotori is wrong    Reminder it's all part of Phantom's master plan.    Kotori is shit Mana would never let this happen    Post doggami.    Nah, I'm pretty sure it was that Mio girl.   Oh boy  Goddammit  since i didnt watch negima,the part where touta says who she will fall for kinda hurts    So good. UQH should have been a spin-off solely for Eva.   Post the rest of the chapter.       Captcha sucks, so no      theres an option to use older captcha in settings. no more 'select all pizzas'     Should read X's changelogs more     Keep going.     Who is he talking about?    Negi/Nagi, but she met Nagi first so she thought he's the one and fell in love with him    So he likes or not?    Eva is so moe and love.    <br/>    So basically Eva thought she was in love with nagi cuz of touta's words?    I really wish for her to experience Motherhood.    Slut   I can already see it... Eva get's her memories from the rift She sees touta they kiss (probably not) the end super not obv        he has double personality or what is he talking about?    How did he mistake her ID when he clearly knows the bitch? See the mangaka fucking around with pairing and harems again and doesn't learn from past mistakes. Like the bitch was already shot down by nagi and if anything was ever going to happen between her and negi it would of been happened, so what's the point of keeping loli Eva forever alone?   Fucking touta cucking his own self! Why is he such a bitch, like one moment he's crying for three days straight about how she treated him and how he noticed she looked at nagi/negi, but the moment he confessed he back tracks for no reason and then starts to hype the fuck out of two guys who doesn't even want her.  Fucking drop   Because Touta has serious self esteem problems due to being a clone and feels he can't comparet to Negi in anyway. So why try to win her when he know she will be happier with Negi. Him growing over that shit is part of his character development and won't be easy to do.    He is clearly talking about her future self.    Fucking Touta man. He really is an idiot. I know he has good intentions but this is both heartwarming and infuriating at the same time.    How can she be happy with negi when negi doesn't want her? And for him to grow he actually has to stop feeling inferior and stop running away from his feeling.   The way I see it the mangaka just wanted to throw in another unnecessary twist into the story (which wasn't needed at all and didn't help progress the story in any way) just to play with touta/negi/nagixevafags and now he's decided to sink the toutaxeva ship just niw he can build up on the other three ships he built for touta. The gender bender ship, the loli tsundere ship, and the yaoi ghost ship.  Honestly that's why I don't like dealing with action harems (or harems in general) they usually make no sense at all and leaves you exactly where you started at in the first chapter when it comes to romance.         Honestly that's why I don't like dealing with action harems (or harems in general) they usually make no sense at all and leaves you exactly where you started at in the first chapter when it comes to romance.  You've been reading the wrong harems.    So will anyone post the rest? Or at least direct me where to find it?   Its in the folder as usual   Where is Negi?, did some girl win?   Touta doesn't really know much about Negi. As far as he knows he is his super cool grandfather that Eva and Fate love and Touta assumes that Negi can make Eva happy. Compared to someone like him, Touta just assumes Negi will always be the better choice.   Ending it like this is a bit disappointing, but it's realistic. The issues Touta has are not things you deal very easily, and the fact he admited he loves Eva is a good step for the boy. Now he has to grow into believing that he is worthy of her love too.     Yeah, the Lifemaker did.            What you mean with that? What is the folder?       So does Touta just plain turn magic attacks back on their user in some weird twist of antimagic and magia erebia?      Since Touta has both Magia Erebia and magic cancel does that mean Negi married Asuna?       Destruction left   Negation right  Reminds me somewhat of a certain Onii-sama        That actually might be how it works, it looks like Touta used ME to absorb the magic attack Dana did and transformed it into anti-magic power to banish Dana from the Rift. So I guess he learned Counter?   Now, it means he might be the clone of some Negi and Asuna clones.    It reminds me of GaoGaiGair, so I hope that Touta learns how to HEAVEN AND HELL!          He's a clone, probably made from Negi and royal blood magic. Not literally an offspring          is page 7.   page 8   page 9   page 10   page 11   page 12                           Pretty badass technique.          No, Touta is some clone of Negi, they probably spliced in some of Asuna's genes because why not. Looks like Negi can't have/never tried to have kids.  inb4 there are Negi clones with the genes of all of class 3-A      And that's it.  Thanks to the mega guy like usual.  https://mega.co.nz/#F!CAlXEY7L!cooK<wbr>ERhviytsGX16p2iVMg</wbr>        Where is my negi/nodoka or yue clone?     Graduation Certificate  I miss Jack.     What would his finishing move be called? Yin-Yang?    Too easy Eva, too easy.    So I wonder what will Dana do with Kitty here, I feel she will have Kitty train Touta some more.   Anon, she is pure, and she just learned about Love.       Eternal Touta Fever!   Kitty is a cute name    Anon, she is pure, and she just learned about Love.  Even so, she's still too easy.     Negi/Chisame, Negi/Ku-Fei, Negi/Setsuna, Negi/Konoka clones when?    Not like she was any better in Negima, Eva has always been bad with her personal feelings.    You putting it like that I can accept but that's only if he actually does man up and realizes that. If he just let his so call love for her just fade then I doubt he actually did love her and maybe it was just more of fear of losing her.    Well I guess that's true, the way she fell for Nagi was just about the same.    Ok then name two good harems where it was actually done right?    What the fuck happened to Jack anyways?    Not giving a fuck on Mars I guess.    Well, the core of this arc for Touta is his relationship with Eva, and how to mend it, so I feel that we will get some progress on that font by the time the Tournament ends.    I know, I guess Touta will have to teach her of other kinds of love or something.    Probably still in Inverse Mars or something.          He's probably somewhere in Mundus Magicus doing fuck all.   Rakan should have been the one to take care of Touta.   I doubt it tho, the relationship problem seemed kinda forced so by the end of this arc we will be right back to where we started with their relationship.    I don't know about that. Dana is pretty funny and captures a fair bit of what made Jack great.    Jack will come back and teach Touta the way of locating women by sniffing their panties when the time comes. Dana is good for now.    No, Touta still hasn't solved his issues with Eva, mainly that he feels she cares for him because of Negi, so the core of the problem is there. So for their relationship to be restored, Touta must learn that Eva really cares for him, just as he cares for her (and that's why it was important here that he learned to accept he loves her [whatever that love might be]).    I dunno, he might have made Touta more of an idiot, maybe it's for the best Dana took the kid. At least she will make him to learn beauty and style, as fitting for a vamp.        He wants to protect that smile, but knows he can never be the person the REAL Eva smiles at       I meant raising him as a child, not what's going on right now.      Mmm, it might be a cool idea, I know that Jack wouldn't mess as much as Eva has done recently with Touta. That guy was way smarter emotiaonally than Eva.    If Fate raised Touta, would Touta inherit Fate's homolust for Negi?    Oh of course that will be solved (or at least I hope) but what I mean is she will not like him like that and he will bow out for negi and just accept the role as a brother and things will go on as if it never happen, and thus allowing other ships not to be sunk (even when he will end up with nobody)    And you bet your ass touta'd use it with that name.   Honestly though Eva is perfect without the romance seeing her act all cutesy kinda ruins the Evatroll. She should be left alone for all eternity not getting with anybody, her character shines best when she's just being Eva not a lovestruck Harem Girl #02378   Knowing Ken, he will bring back the Eva ship somehow, the man is good at this, so sadly I don't think this is the end of things. But yeah, I honestly don't expect things to work out romantically for Touta at the end of this.    Nah, because Fate would have raised Touta as an anti-lifemaker weapon and nothing more.... or he would have raised Touta as the son he and Negi never had, so Touta.   Kitty is a more innocent Eva, before she got the time to developed the thick armor that allowed Eva to be Evatroll in Negima. Plus even in Negima Eva could be pretty bad about her feelings like here.          And that's why i just wish Akamatsu won't end Eva with somebody else. Her character's perfect as a mentor not a love interest. That's what made her great in Negima she acted normally with Negi treating him as a child if she somehow develops feelings for anyone those interactions might be reduced to blushing and the usual Tsundere BS.  Romance ruins Battle Manga whether you like it or not. People tend to get more invested in the romance subplot instead of the actual plot. And it invites waifufags and the likes.  Her character should just be left alone till the end without getting with anybody. Stay as an immortal loli with a haughty attitude.       We all do anon.  ;_;     What the fuck will it take to kill the Lifemaker?    Wanting Eva alone for all eternity.   Just awful.      Magic Cancel, meaning that Touta or Asuna will be the ones to do it.    But then when there is no romance it makes all the male characters seem gay, like any guy who chooses fights over female seem pretty gay. Now the real problem to me isn't the romance it self but how it's handled and battle manga with harems does it the worst of all. All they really have to do is set a fix girl and not throw in unnecessary drama and love rivals to make it cool.    Eva would be great as trolldere.   Imagine he gets out of the rift and Eva really did remember him all along. It'll alternate between her teasing him even harder than before, and her still blushing furiously at certain things because she's still got no personal experience with romance.      Considering the Yin-Yang motive, it probably is.   Is UQ holder follow the same story line as negima? I'll probably read negima if that's the case since the anime sucks dick.    Nnnooooooo why must he be such a douche! And I will never understand the point of harems with no end game, they basically have no point at all. And yeah touta will end up exactly like negi, years later he still doesn't have a girl, is still working under Eva , and is OP.   (And even if I didn't original start reading for the romance if touta doesn't end with anyone I probably won't read another series from this mangaka because I refuse to read another battle manga with a harem.)      Don't the manga isn't much better then the anime you will be disappointed expecting better.    what would you have a Tsundere Eva with shitloads of blushing and acting all cutesy ?  Kuromaru will be the end girl for Touta, Negi and Fate has the Homolust covered  Eva is fine as an immortal loli vamp who knows nothing about love her blushing is fine if it's for a short while and it happens rarely that's what makes it special/bearable if it happens often the novelty of it wears off and you'll have your so called Harem Girl #02378.   And I will never understand the point of harems with no end game  You probably never read Negima   Harem    end game  you can only choose one anon. Stop being stupid and you don't read a battle manga for romance if you want romance go read sum Shoujo shit. That's where your kind belongs              Negi Yotsuba would be the most powerful.  I wouldn't be surprised if they were not clones but test tube babies. In order to get the most out of Negi and his army of invincible school girls you could make one child from him and one of the girls and then blender that one, and produce a child using it's DNA and a 2nd member of 3-A.     For a 'clone' they fucked it up a lot.  He doesn't even look like negi.    I never said I read it for romance, I just said the MC be more or less gay when all they care about is fighting and friendship. And that makes a series worse to me but you don't need full romance he'll look how fucking akira did it, he just threw chichi on that nigga goku and didn't really worry about the relationship aspect that much. And why does anon say I've never read negima(which I have)    They seemed to want to 'clone' his power rather than the man himself.    Don't project your own feelings on her. In this very chapter we see that in her youth, Eva even contemplated getting herself killed over the prospect of a future alone.  In Negima, we see one timeline's Eva abandon her life there to travel through time seeking love.  She doesn't want to be alone.        Well he didn't show up to the final battle with Negi and the others. Maybe he dead.  ;_;      He is a clone of a clone, plus he probably was mixed with someone other than Negi.     Lets combine these, shall we?      Punctuation on a separate line   Literally worse than Hitler.      He should learn to shut bitches in a middle of a emo swing with a kiss.    nice     I wouldn't be surprised if they were not clones but test tube babies   Yeah, I thought it was pretty clear that they're different blends, since they don't look like Negi and are called his grandkids. I figure Touta's parents really are his parents - as in, they really did provide the base genetics. Leaning on the way they call him Negi's grandson, I'd guess he's at most 1/4 Negi-derived, and at most 1/4 Asuna-derived.   If they Konoe clan is trying to make an anti-Lifemaker weapon, trying to get Asuna's magic cancel, Negi's magic talent, and Konoka's magic capacity all in one might have sounded like a good idea at the time. The problem is that there are a bunch of possible results that won't work (Touta, apparently), or might become dangerous in general (Touta becoming a mindless magia erebea monster), or would be an excellent new host body for Lifemaker to hijack (Negi's magic and Konoka's mana capacity).  I would also assume that this is plan B. A team based around Negi and Asuna themselves, plus support, should be able to beat Lifemaker - and DID, in one of the Negima ending timelines - but they're not available in this timeline.          thanks anon.    Nagi. Obviously    That's Nagi he's talking about, not Negi. Eva never loved Negi.     Does Touta even know about Nagi?      So this is his finishing Move.      clon war when?   Never      No, this is    somtimes touta looks quite old.   nobles are more civilized than anyone else in this manga and its prequel   Yes, Ikkuu talk about him. the yukihime´s love interest    Eva´s hell is the loneliness. I don´t want to end up alone. But it hasn´t to be a romantic relationship. A family is fine.     I don´t want to end up alone  you are not alone. you have us       Beat her off.  Hue.      You are (not) alone     Thanks guys.    Well either way it's still bad.    Eternal EVA FEVER ??      Am I the only one who thinks that he earned a lot of points with this move? Seeing as Eva would have been disappointed if he had answered that he was the one.       I wonder if current Eva remembers him.    Evangeline hope centuries by a redheaded that not love her. Good job Touta.  So, Eva is certainly pure     Hopefully they will have 700 years of sex.      I know why you are doing this, and I respect it and all but holy shit man, stop hurting yourself.      They can't hurt me anymore, they have played plenty enough with my feelings     Eva´s faces are the best.    I literally forgot this series existed.   I'm not satisfied, Akamatsu. There were some bright moments early on but I'm rather upset right now. How many chapters does this make, anyway?    I guess we know why Eva fell for Nagi. Also calling Dana a "last boss" was hilarious. Dat cliffhanger, can't wait for next chapter.     She is in love with nagi because Kuromaru wins the toutabowl and she couln't have touta.    Kuromaru will win the asuna zone.   "I mean sure, there's gonna be some cloudy days and some storms, but when the the rain stops, your tomorrow will be filled by blue sky" Yes, the wind is nice today, the ship is sailing smoothly...   Guys go read hentai harems like Cheers! if you want some relief.    I literally forgot this series existed.  I dont believe you m8.    If I where an inmortal I would fuck loli eva all day every day so she doesn't feel alone.   of course she does, that's why she want to keep him away from danger and has been taking care of him.    what where the nobles doing on the two previous crisis of reality, with the MotB trying to fuck eveyone up forever and all that?   yfw the MotB is just ana verage noble.       Dana said that the other nobles don't give a single fuck about anything, Dana was probably doing Dana things.    No, it's true. I literally forgot that UQH was a series and hadn't thought about it in about a month or two, and when I saw this thread and skimmed a few images I found myself wondering whether this was a monthly or a weekly manga.   I barely even remember the Big 3 nowadays. The only ongoing weeklies I'm reading religiously are  Hayate the Combat Butler  and  Boku no Hero Academia       nice blog dude.    I think i Know what happens next. like santa and co touta has to fight someone. I gues the Uq holder noble     Poor Touta, doesn't realize that the reason why Eva went after his ancestors is because he told her to. He had already stolen her heart many hundreds of years ago.    I bet Dana will seal her memories.     That does not make sanse     sorry got it wrong i meant     i bet that not. She just doesn´t want to tell Touta.   is Jack a last Boss?   Mini-boss at best.     Why not? I don't think Dana's cruel enough to make Eva remember about him and maybe hoping to meet Touta again for more than hundred years.    who think that this finished in ToutaxEva in the end??   I would prefer it before the end of Negima.     Guy Dana said Touta is evas man of destiny. Second its the opposite of cruel.  Here she realizited that touta and her ar from different places.    I think you can put together the dots just fine.           It'll end with Touta finally ending Eva's life.    Touta will die first.    meh, reminds me too much on judo with the whole "use the force of the enemy against him"     i doubt that they dead easy     Touta kill Eva when Negi fucks with one women.    I'm sure he has tried. I mean it's not like they would know that he couldn't have children if he had tried.     she acted normally with Negi treating him as a child if she somehow develops feelings for anyone those interactions might be reduced to blushing and the usual Tsundere BS.  this man knows     Shut up judo is awesome.    Sure. Fate can´t have children.     implying there is no other way to know that.     It is but Toutas ability is just straight like judo, nothing original really. I hope he can use the Gravity blade later on to pull enemies to him or to suck in light and load it.  Negi already had a judo-like style by being able to use his own offensive force to empower himself at the cost of his health.      yea but it looked more like a basic technik. he will use the basic and expend on it. negis first magic arts were kind of lame. But he made them awesome.         nice job      When I see this page the FF 9 battle theme instantly pops up in my head    Are you me?   Eva, Negi and Touta are family.   That's Touta, an idiot that will never win. He ruined his best chance for love.    But Nagi rejected her. And we don´t know if Negi love Eva. So she only has Touta.    isnt that Aikido?    I stoped reading when some before some necromancer was going to destroy the world with a hikkikomori, dunno what chapter was that.    But he could have won right there, before the competition appeared, was it so hard?    Akamatsu.     No he now winning would change nothing but people complaing how cheap that win was.     So he has to work more to win? I gues that makes sense.    Anyway, it has been shown by much Touta loves Eva. Unless Eva reject him and see him only as a child. This ends ToutaxEva.  for many turns of the author.      This is Ken, I bet he already has plan to have Touta end with his Yandere Imouto or something, so don't think this will end so soon.    Touta thinks she really loves Negi, and only raised him as an obligation, so he said "C'mon, you'll love that red head far more than me". She really does like Touta, possibly her first love outside of time she still remembers, but when she met a red head in the future called Nagi she felt like seeing where it would go.  Imagine if you fell in love with someone, but it turned out to sort of by your son as you ended up raising them.       , but it turned out to sort of by your son as you ended up raising them  kind of your own fault. it wasnt eva who played family it was Touta.She was his teacher and master he made more out of it        After jobbing to a 10 year old boy with little training after he had lived through a full life of strife and training he committed sudoku.   RIP Jack Rakan, greatest jobber of the entire Akamatsuverse.      Goes both ways with this pseudo incest, they both met each other when they were young and sort of fell for each other in different ways.  Few hundred years later it makes for an odd love story out of time.      jack can´t dead. !!   Will you remember the Etotamas when they're gone?    rat  I'd rather kill myself      Kii-tan   I dunno, I wouldn't mind playing around with her but she'd probably miss Inu-tan quickly. Can I take them both?       Kii-tan.  It would end in sex because she's easily tricked, and she really turns me on.       Cock.     I probably won't.  It seems like one of those shows that are fun but forgettable and you barely remember their name a few years later, like Kyouran Kazoku Nikki.     He was talking to Illumi, right?   Yes.    Yes.  Who was that random person in the background of the Heavens Arena arc who called out Killua's name?     I wonder how Illumi and Hisoka met.   Likes attract    Heavens Arena maybe? Since Killua was sent there as a child it might be a Zoldyck tradition and Hisoka seemed comfortable at the Heavens Arena.      yfw this cruel beast is a Floor Master when Heavens Arena is revisited      I still feel dirty for ever liking Wing. Never would have guessed that he's a pedophile.     manipulator   training to be a pure martial artist         It says "You're retarded"     Honestly he seems like an enhancer with how determined and single minded he is at training.    Hisoka said himself that the personality thing wasn't 100% reliable.    So then Killua isn't fickle and he still loves Gon they just need some time apart!   Has there been any info on Togashi since September or whenever he announced his hiatus?   No, Killua is legitimately, objectively and empirically a shit.    Killua sucks.     But if he doesn't still love him why'd he go through that trouble to save him, and why did he STILL feel the need to have Leorio and pals not tell Gon that it was Killua who saved him?     To hold it over Gon and make him feel guilty. He even said "you owe me" to him.    were that his goal he wouldn't have told them not to tell him      he just has autism anon, this is how he expresses his love    reminder that gon saved killua without expecting anything in return   How can anyone like this self-centered dumb drama queen faggot who doesn't realize his own mistakes and instead choses to blame others is beyond me.   Well before the CA arc is when he gets you, then you try to forgive everything in the late CA arc and election arc.    I don't blame people for their mental disabilities, he can't help being autistic.    Kawaii    they mistook his thoughts as actual narration, and never caught onto the fact that it was disconnected from what was actually happening    Characters without flaws are not interesting anon    under 5'2"   thug     It's because he's a flawed but well written character?    What?     same height as the 10 year old child on your team   gangsta       tfw taller than Feitan     Is that suppose to be impressive?    yes, because I'm 5'2 he's a fucking midge     best onisan    I want to  put  Feitan  in my pocket .    He's not quite. Maximum 4'10" for midgets.     tfw shorter than Feitan     I hope you're a girl. Otherwise holy shit, you're a fucking mega manlet.     Hisoka really is a bro even if he only chooses to be a bro to people he wants to murder in the future.    Not him, but /a/ does seem to have a lot of manlets, I'm 5'4", nothing wrong with being short though,  if you're gay  for all the /a/ manlets that aren't, sorry.     tfw gay and kind of want to be a manlet  not that I'm unhappy with my height     Yeah but Killuafags tend to ignore Killua's flaws.   Why do Kalluto and Alluka wear girl clothes? Did their mum desperately want a daughter? Is it a Zoldyck family tradition for everyone besides the heir? (I'm assuming not since we've seen Alluka and Kalluto in male clothing in the flashbacks but if so, did Illumi and Milluki wear girl clothes as small children?) Did Alluka start it because they wanted to be the little girl and Kalluto copied because he wanted Killua to love him?   Killua hate  I was going to say "Killua did nothing wrong" but I know he made a lot of mistakes. Like letting Gon delude himself, never telling him his true feelings and then getting upset because Gon isn't a mind-reader and so but eveybody is being too harsh on him. Seeing his best friend sacrifice himself, carring what's basically his corpse on his back and then see him wither away must have been a traumatic experience to Killua and just like Gon, he's only a 12 years old boy that went through a lot of shit.     I think the kalluto copying alluka one is most accurate    I think that its a backlash against the previous Gonhate. How many people thought that Gon was just being selfish, realizing that a character that they once thought of as an innocent victim wasn't so innocent after all. Part of this comes from reading the actual manga, which makes the difference in Killua's perspective and what's actually going on more obvious. The fact that Gon learns and actually and grows up, while Killua doesn't and even guilt trips Gon, just makes it even worse.  The fact that many Killuafags can't admit to his mistakes without trying to make excuses for him doesn't help.      But Anon, Alluka is a girl so of course she's going to dress like one    I'd just like to point out that Killua did change a lot and grow as a person from the first arc where we see him, but still has to grow.    I miss edgy Killua. He was fun.    Would old Killua be reluctant about killing Pitou right there? Probably not.    While Killua has changed a lot since his first appearance, he hasn't learned anything from the CA arc.     because I'm 5'2  Damn     Killua has too many flaws and not enough likeable traits.    Most if not all characters in HxH are flawed. It doesn't justify Killua's popularity.    leorio will never carry his own arc     implying he won't have his own character arc in the DC     I kinda think that that's Leorio's appeal, that in a world full of increasingly stronger superthreats he's just a guy with a good head on his shoulders who wants to do the right thing.   I'm also guessing the Japs don't like him because he's not the typical dumb shonen protagonist (Gon) or at least somewhat edgy (Killua, Kurapika)       in a world full of increasingly stronger superthreats   typical dumb shonen protagonist (Gon)   somewhat edgy (Killua, Kurapika)        typical dumb shonen protagonist (Gon)   or at least somewhat edgy (Killua, Kurapika)      Oh you're going to get it now.     this entire post        M-m-muh kiddie protag isn't dumb just because he's observant and has a knack for combat!    M-m-muh other protags aren't edgy even though one literally rips people's hearts out and comes from a family of assassins and the other will do anything to get his clan's eyes back, including torture and murder!   Oh yeah, another reason Leorio doesn't get attention. Lack of bloodline. Nips love their family legacy and heritability.   Gon is the son of an incredible hunter     Killua comes from a family of insanely talented assassins    Kurapika comes from a special clan with magic eyes   If Leorio's dad was the world's best doctor or something I'd fucking guarantee they'd like him more.                  In the manga translation I read, somebody in the background says Killua's name.  I guess it was just randomly put there.      I love Leorio but damn your post is embarassing. First of all, he is pretty popular in Japan. Not as popular as the others because he didn't get as much paneltime, but still decently popular.  He even is miss Japan 2013's husbando.  Also, just like the other protagonists, he has a lot of potential, which is the reason why Hisoka didn't kill him.  Also, Gon is pretty far from being typical or dumb, you'd think the CA arc made that clear enough. Just like Killua hasn't been edgy since the first arc, or when Kurapika felt sick after killing Uvo, realized how unfulfilling his revenge was and was angry at himself for putting Gon and Killua in danger.        You must like danmachi    Nothing wrong with being a manlet, it is not like being a lardass     danmachi      Although Kurapika did fully backtrack on that until he met Leorio again  and fucked Mizaistom      It's never said he killed or tortured, and it'd be out of character considering the events of Yorkshin. I don't know where that theory came from.     True, just meant he went edge again.  The cow solves everything.        the pika lost his humanity  ;_;      implying  Leorio might not be a doctor yet but he already knows how to heal     What would happen if Killua went with Kurapika instead of Leorio?     Less suffering, but weaker.      killua in charge of emotional support    Did Pitou die thinking her death mattered and without knowing how Pouf tricked her? That's pretty fucking sad when you think about it.     How did Pouf trick her?     By pretending they got Komugi back.     I swear I love this person soooo much but I'm not going make them feel better  is this the face of autism?       her        The very last beast.   Fuck, why do I've the feeling that kurapika and prince bateman will both die in the fight. Even though he still has some business with the spiders.   Knowing how unpredictable and anti-climatic is togashi.          This meme is still alive?     BECAUSE GON IS MY MOST PRECIOUS FRIEND   treats a mermaid and a squid that he just met better than Gon      I bet Kurapika will die without getting the last of the eyes.  But anyway, the Troupe is coming to the DC too.      i bet that kurapika will be defeat by feitan .     the more he loves someone, the worse he treats them  how long until Alluka has to go through some shit and Killua just watches and blames her afterwards?     If Kurapika manages to get his chains on Feitan quickly without hurting him enough that he can use Burnt by the Sun he might be able to defeat him.     the more he loves someone, the worse he treats them  He must really love his aniki.     nah, he's just scared of and respects him    Post more Pika    No.    The best kind of love.    Just one Pika, use it sparingly.     use sluts sparingly     Pika is not a slut.     Kurapika   slut   not pure incarnate  What an awful post, anon.         flashed a twelve year old boy on a train   not a slut  Whatever you say, there is nothing pure about her, worse yet she's a shotacon.         she   Wait wut.        thinking this 99 filler scene is canon   implying it wasn't accidental anyway and that he didn't hide it immediately afterwards   her   she         Kurapika is a girl.      Whatever you say m8.     I'm almost sure that was '99 anime only.    Might as well be canon, Togashi loved it and only regretted he didn't think of putting it in his manga.    you better give a source    I will need quotations and sources on that.     This is starting to get out of hand, I don't have the source on that interview, but I was exaggerating, when asked about that scene he just said that it made him laugh, he never actually said he loved it or wish he'd used it.       Might as well be canon, Togashi loved it and only regretted he didn't think of putting it in his manga.   No I was only exaggerating   Fuck off cunt.        Oh all right then, carry on.     Makes a lightheated joke in a half dead thread with no actual discussion going on   fuck off cunt  Man, that really escalated quickly. I mean that really got out of hand fast.  Are you going to stab me in the heart?          Die, faggot.        You first.       try to say Kurapika is a girl   say it as if Togashi said it   No no I was only pretending, just joking guys, trust me   Seriously, fuck off.          responding seriously to a post that anyone who isn't retarded would know isn't serious   Seriously, fuck off.

Is that too much to ask, Togashi? Will we get another chapter this year?   Manga returns this month  of next year.     Just reread best arc.    W-will that be a record-setting hiatus?      of next year    It's tru ;_;        But there's only so many times I can reread it    Yes, Togashi is trying to set the record by putting HxH on hiatus longer than bagserk.     What an optimistic prediction     Why are Togashi's long haired boys such dreamboats?       No, his longest was over 2 years.          Pitouboat        muherr and bum.jpg   I want Muherr's bum.     Pitou has good taste.    Please don't sexualize the elf.   Why is Muherr an elf? Why is Beans a bean?        DC.     I've wondered a long time about the anime version for Beans, I'm colorblind, so the manga is basically completely black and white for me, even the colored pages, but I couldn't ignore it in the anime, is Beans legit not a human  bean ? Seriously, what is he?    I hope DC has more qts     He has to be some form of magical beast, or maybe he got turned into it by Nen.      After reading the manga I never expected Beans to actually be green, just funnily shaped.     He needs to stop being so sexual then.    In the '99 anime he wasn't green. It looks weirder somehow.    Is that his official coloring though?    I also wonder if Gon's hair is supposed to be greener than how it's depicted in the anime adaptations. Every time Togashi colors it it's pretty green..but maybe if HxH were full color he wouldn't really do it like that. Also didn't he color Pitou's hair blonde once?    He gave Pitou purple skin once too.    He also colored Gon's hair blue sometimes on volume covers, and Pitou's shorts/socks green. It's not really consistent.    Pitou still had the "best" death of the guards. She died with a sense of accomplishment, having thought she saved Komugi (which was true anyway), and making the biggest perceived threat of the invasion waste his power. So even if she was tricked she still accomplished her goals, there's nothing sad about that.  Then we have Youpi who at least died ignorant of upcoming failures. He still had the high of saving Meruem and probably thought that things were going to turn out fine and Pouf's plan would work. His death wasn't too regrettable.  But Pouf, fucking Pouf died two deaths. His spirit was killed and then he died crying on the ground. That fucker was utterly defeated and humiliated, he died knowing he was a total failure. If anything, this is sad (and hilarious).        Yeah, she's blonde on the covers of volume 22 and 26 and has white hair on the cover of volume 28.      Brown hair here.       Togashi should really release official colors for his characters        back from hiatus!     Just assume there's no canon colouring, like JoJo.    Was just about to say  Though sometimes it gets annoying, the chapter when he drew Gon as a shitskin, I couldn't stand that chapter.   <br/>    the chapter when he drew Gon as a shitskin      Gon as a shitskin      I swear I'm not racist, I just couldn't tell if he was supposed to be black or brown, so I went with a term that could cover either one.     I'm just wondering what chapter you're talking about.     What? I totally agree with that anon.  We don't need no jews or negroes in our manga.  Thats why Pakunoda is worst girl         What chapter was this? If you don't remember the actual number, what was vaguely happening?  I'm curious as I don't remember it.         Deviantartists can't make recolor HxH OCs because Togashi did it first to his own characters  fucking owned       ''99 anime shows his chest.    <br/>    Pretty sure that happens with every SJ cover and tankoban cover.      I think it was in GI, during their training with Bisky before he developed his hatsu.      You sure it wasn't meant to be dirt/grime/suntan then?    i was actually just thinking that when I was typing that post, that it might have been dirt       Blegh, say what you want about the 2011 series but i appreciate that they made Gon's hair darker instead of this light green shit.        And elaborating on that thought, I think the reason I assumed it was just Togashi messing with the coloring was because Killua was still pale as fuck, and they both should have been tanned or covered in dirt.     Well his hair is practically black in the manga too, I mean if it weren't for these occasional colored covers the idea that his hair is green would never occur to you. Also the 2011 anime actually colored the tips of his hair green, at least in the earlier arcs, whereas the 1999 anime just went all black IIRC.  I just want to know if Togashi actually considers Gon's hair green.      I'm pretty sure it's just an artistic style for chapter/volume covers.     This triggers the /pol/       cute     (and hilarious)  I felt bad for him     I've said it before, and I feel like no one shares this opinion, but he was my favorite ant.   Youpi had a sense of self, he thought on his own, he respected his enemy, and he made decisions that weren't in the best interest of the king because of that  Pitou was blindly devoted to the king, and followed his every wish without thinking at all, she was totally selfless, to a fault  Pouf thought on his own about what was truly best for the king, and realized that Komugi was not good for the king, even if the king loved her, he was the most self sacrificing of them all, and ended up having the most miserable death because of it.  Pouf--Best royal guard.            You shouldn't have. He was completely irredeemable.     Pitou was blindly devoted to the king, and followed his every wish without thinking at all  That's not entirely true, Pitou wasn't just following the King’s orders, she knew she was protecting the person who has made him whole.     It's hard to pick favorites anon, now all of the ants are equally liked by me. Pouf was my favorite for a long while, but then Youpi got more development.  As for Pitou, I wish we saw more of them. In the final confrontation Pitou is reduced to a healer and then loses to Gon. They were the most loyal, but could have still been a greater character.       I think Pitou could have at least spent some time around Komugi, it felt like a waste that they didn't really do much other than guard the palace and be stuck in a room for an hour.     that fucking image  Gon would be mind raped if he saw this shit      What was the purpose of that scene?  It was just made so we can masturbate about it?        Pitou is reduced to a healer  Hardly     Ok, that was a bad choice of words, but what I meant is that they spent the majority of the confrontation with Komugi and Gon sitting and watching. And we got hyped up by everything Pitou did up to that point.     we will never see pitou interact with komugi     Jesus I had forgotten what Melody looked like in her first appearance. And now I need to forget again.     I've said it before, and I feel like no one shares this opinion  No one shares this opinion because what you went on to say was a complete misconstruction of the character you dumb faggot.  First of all, Pitou wasn't "blindly devoted" to the king at all, I'd even question if you actually understand what you'd be implying with that.  But Pufu wasn't thinking what was best for the king. His problem was that Meruem wasn't living up to his expectations, his motivations were completely selfish in that he wanted Mereum to stop living as himself and start living in a way that would satisfy Pufu's fairyland delusions. Pufu wanted what was best for PUFU. He was willing to become the villain and sabotage the life of the person he (supposedly) loves most in order to mold things into his ideal. He was a weaselly little shit and fundamentally the worst royal guard.  Posts like yours just help me reinforce the fact that pufu shitters are retarded and should seek asylum.           I think you missed the point of that scene. It was part of the reason why Gon lost his shit.     First Pitou looks better.     You have to keep in mind that Pouf was thinking like an ant and like a human at the same time. For "the King", he only wanted what was best. For "Meruem", he wanted the worst. He was aware of that fact, which is why he was ready to die if he were to kill Komugi.     Not with that hair, she doesn't.     first geru looks better     Oh no, I just wanted Pitou to have at least one more fight, I have nothing against that scene.    I prefer it.    It'd be more interesting if a Pitou who looked like a creepy doll showed compassion for Meruem instead of the moe qt on the bottom.    "Moe qt" Pitou looks a lot more like a doll though    Not at all. Original Pitou was creepy and doll-like, the new design is more expressive and human-like.    Doesn't this fit the narrative of the CA arc?  I doubt it was done on purpose but if so that's pretty good.     I've never seen a creepy doll that looked like this.  Where can I buy one?       no pitou figures ever   not even a nendoroid  actually hxh as a whole is really lacking in merch       Gon and Killua figures are all ugly      implying     All I want are cute nendos. Is it really too much?   The hair always gets me in any form, but this figure is especially amazing.       In character for Gon, but still ironic and tragic because Pitou would have died anyway and he wouldn't have had his powers BTFO if she'd lingered around, and got poisoned by being near Mereum.    This is the only good one I've seen      it's only tragic because their existence was largely pointless    there are more than four characters in this series.    That's why the arc should have been shorter. Not like their characters reached their full potential anyway.    There should be Killua figures based on Togashi Killua.     Crying Gon and Killua  Delicious     fuck off     tfw your HxH will never as much merch as Killua     what a perfect big brother    deleted again   I want to  shave  Ging   I want Illumi to protect me!

I know Ikalgo's hatsu is using dead bodies, but is his tentacle rifle nen? Or just some weird ant ability    Same. Illumi only wanted the best for his beloved younger brother.    Shouldn't it be transmutation?    Transmutation just alters the properties of aura, it doesn't change physical objects.    Guess it's conjuration then.  it doesn't change physical objects  What about Biscuit then?      Bisky is transmutation.    De-aging one's body seems more like enhancement to me. Also Connjuration is manifesting one's aura into a physical object. I think Ikalgo's rifle is manipulation or enhancement if anything. But it could just be some weird non-nen ability he has, like Killua's claws.       stop thinking with your dicks, pals. putting her into the top 5 transmuters based on personality was pretty obviously just because that guy has shit taste and thinks flawed = shit.       that guy has shit taste and thinks flawed = shit.  Gon is flawed and isn't shit. Killua is flawed and also is shit.      killua   better personality than machi   Stop thinking with you're dick, pal.       it's been so long since anything happened in hxh that i forgot everything about nen    they're just jealous that machi got to hug kii     Killua will never stab you in the tits     Gon's flaws are barely flaws. They are not negative aspects of his personality, they are traits that have both negatives and positives.  I'm not exactly sure why you think no personality &gt; flawed personality. The only examples shitposters like you give are that he expected an apology from Gon, and not any of his actual flaws.        Gon's flaws are barely flaws. They are not negative aspects of his personality, they are traits that have both negatives and positives.  Do Killuafags realize the shit they type sometimes?     How does Machi not have a personality again?  Anyway, anything is better than the whiny faggot with the victim complex.     new chapter when?   How about you give examples of flaws of Gon that don't have both positive and negatives aspects, then, instead of going for insults? Debates are supposed to be two-sided, you know.  Virtually everything she says/does is to fit to the story. She's bland. Also, has it ever occurred to you that maybe some of Killua's faults can be attributed to how and the environment in which he was raised? He didn't grow up anything like how Gon did (which is who a lot of people like you compare him to) outside of having no friends.        RIP    Killua will never wiggle on your lap uncomfortably while your dick sinks in to his virgin boypussy     tfw Killua will never gamble away your life savings      Virtually everything she says/does is to fit to the story.  This could be applied to several characters that people love(seriously, pretty much all Chimera Ant characters were tossed around by the plot), and you still haven't explained how she lacks a personality.  Also, has it ever occurred to you that maybe Killua has a terrible personality because...  I don't care.       people like machi  so you guys are the spider version of ponzufags right?    Yes, and I barely like any of the CA characters as well. Characters that exist for the plot are uninteresting. She lacks a personality because pretty much everything she does can be attributed to devotion to Chrollo. An example of a character who does things out of devotion yet still have a personality outside of that is Pouf - he had an ideal of the king that was selfish and let that image of him control his actions. Maybe one of her traits is also being snarky/rude. If anything, she's worse than Killua. If you won't even read an extra two sentences, it isn't worth continuing this exchange at any rate. :^)       thinking character flaws only have negative aspects  Good lord. No wonder no one likes you.  Machi is pretty similar to Paku. Paku is likeable. Do the math.        she lacks a personality   but here's one aspect of her personality  Okay, anon. :^)       She lacks a personality because pretty much everything she does can be attributed to devotion to Chrollo.  Killua lacks a personality because  Gon lacks a personality because pretty much everything he does can be attributed to devotion to getting Kite back and finding Ging.  Motivations aren't part of a character's personality.        Fuck me  Killua lacks a personality because pretty much everything he does can be attributed to devotion to Gon.      My Youth Romantic Comedy Is Wrong As I Expected     what does 8man's dick taste like?   Coma cheese   Denialfags not allowed below this line ________________________________    ask saika     It seems like the most positive exchange they've had in the entire series is when Yukino asks Haruno for help during the culture festival when they need to buy time for Hachiman to find Meguri, Haruno refuses because she's confident Yukino won't be able to stand up for herself, but Yukino does just that and takes her by surprise. Haruno even complements her on how it looks like she's changed.   And we went from that to where we are in vol 11.  I don't think Yukino really needs years of self-reflection away from Hachiman and Yui to overcome her problems like some say. She has that found that answer already. She just needs to rediscover it.        Reminder that the code got cracked.    I meant Sagami not Meguri.    Friendly reminder that Yukino has had absolutely no romantic development with the 8man.   Right on man, Iroha's feelings aren't genuine   Where is my Legion?   Genuine    8man is her god. She would give herself to him if he simply asks for it.    Gay isnt wrong at all    Yui's feelings are not romantic    saying "you don't even have your will" is the most cruel thing you can do to your sister.  Can't blame her though, must be frustrated seeing her sister acting that way for more than ten years and just couldn't do shit about it must feel horrible for Haruno, too.      Max coffee    8cum tastes sweet because he drinks MAX coffee    bags of sandy milk and salty coins     continuing from last thread:     because friends never take pictures       lol deluded     But seriously though. If you think that she would go to romantic end and put all of the things she was trying to build up from the start to the trash, then YOU guys are the deluded ones.                   She just needs to rediscover it.  My thoughts exactly. Funny that the right answer had been at the middle point of the series all along. Though I am pretty excited we might go back to that in the last volume or two.      because friends never take pictures  They took a lot of pictures in Destinyland but she went out of her way to buy that one expensive picture of just her and Hachiman alone.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127121196  I missed this pic.    Do you have a lot of girls who want to be your friend all the time? If so you might be the main character for an anime    Taking a break.    2spoopy    the only one that would know     all the things she was building up to the trash  There are people who actually believe this     Too much denialfags right now, better wait until they get bored    Yukino   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KVk<wbr>ziuwXif0</wbr>  [ ]      Rewinding from my earlier post:    Also, her attempts of romance is clouded by her dependency.   If you want her romantic feeling to stay, her problem stays.    You forgot we are talking about a MAIN CHARACTER OF AN ANIME.     there are people who doesn't read                   You must have missed the notice<br/>    How far are you trying to go to troll, you already got us dude congrats we fell for it    Alright everyone it has come to my attention that this club is tied up in some unspeakable drama that we're all just conveniently ignoring.   That ends now.   We are going to discuss everything on our mind under the following condition:   We will speak honestly, and after all is said and done we will all remain friends.   You may deny this proposal, but if you do then I'll have no choice but to leave this club.   I will no longer allow things to go on this way, so no matter what happens things are going to change.   Make your decisions.           Why do people continue to ship 8man and Yukino if Yukino still loves Hayama?    this guy is still posting      Is it just me or does Oregairu now feel more like its Yukino's story more than anyone else's. I know this seems very narrow minded (since its largely a coming age novel) but even though Hachiman is the MC, the overall plot and interactions of the series all boil down to Yukino   Its her problems, her interactions (or lack of) with the characters that fuel the story so that the characters can grow  Hachiman has pretty much rounded out development wise I feel like (what is left for him? getting 100% over nice girls and ending up with a chick?). Yui has a little development left to go but her characterization has never been as pivotal compared to our two loner autists. Meanwhile, Yukino has to undergo the most changes since the series began and we have yet to reach her final growth. And the final volumes are (and the ending of the series) pretty much revolve her development and what she wants to do in her life       Filthy pleb, that's what yui said in the end of Vol 11. 8man consider that's a LIE! not GENUINE, and he CRIED. Learn some moonrunes      Remember she's playing the "tyrant", so even if she said that to Yukino, she might be suffering a hell inside of her for saying it to her own sister. It's like anon said too, she's watching her sister wasting the chance Haruno never had.  To the other anon asking how I "fixed" her, I didn't. She fixed herself. I only gave her a huge push after forcing her to remove her mask and telling everything I thought and then walked away. Next day she opened up with me. It's a process, like a damn rehab.      Why do people continue to ship Yui with 8man when Yui still loves cookie man?   I can't wait for Irohafags to get BTFO so they finally shut up like Yuifags.  It'll be like OreImo all over again.  Ayase best girl ;_;     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127121196  Nobody has feelings for 8man, he's creepy. Happy?      I will post too      I agree, her past and her relationship with hayama, her mother and haruno are still a mystery.     Are you kidding me. Yui gave 8man a bag of cookie in Vol11.  But 8man call that some kind of "payback gift" and she's nearly going to cry.      Just because people get BTFO doesn't mean they shut up.   Great taste.   I preferred Manami though.        Because she is the main heroine obviously. She needs to be taken care of by EVERYONE.    I was actually okay with the Oreimo end.  Kyousuke admitted he was fucking up his entire life and that he was making a horrible decision. Love isn't rational so admitting that is really all it takes.       yukino   growth or character development  All she does is copying other people. She herself didn't change at all. Her "drama" is bullshit too, since she's just a spoiled kid, who got bullied once. Shit character overall.       Is it just me or does Oregairu now feel more like its Yukino's story more than anyone else's  That's the main point.  It's about a high school Batman saving someone. Everything that happened to him in the past is to prepare him mentally so that he could save her.   That someone is our Ice Queen.        Good Irohasu, everyone!   I thought Manami was alright in the anime but LNfags told me she was literally Satan himself and the reason for all evil in the universe.     liking yuckyno   liking oreimo      The problem was that he rejected all other girls just to fuck his sister once.     Spent most of his time saving the independency autism.   While non-stop flirting with his kouhai.   NTR queen        Ice Queen  More like cold fish.     You got meme'd m9    In love with the dead fish.     Neptuniafag   Shitting on OreImo       once   he really believes this       Even as someone who likes Yukino the most, I am telling you right now that vol 11 slammed the door on Hachiman swooping in wearing the bat suit and saving Yukino. He has explicitly rejected it.  That isn't to say he won't provide peripheral help to her, through emotional support or advice or whatever, but Yukino is going to be the one to stand up for herself. It absolutely has to happen. Or else we're really going to get a 'sour grapes' ending.        saving a picture means watching shit show  Kill yourself oreimoshitter.     It's Vol11 m8, learn some moonrunes, and your meme is trash now.    Not sure if falseflagging or just a retarded yukinofag    And he recognized that he was alienating himself from the others. He still valued it higher than everything else.  Of course it's implied he went on to have a secret relationship with her but he never could have known that would have worked when he started. He took the philosophy of "The flame that burns half as long burns twice as bright"        lol u a troll   That level of delusion.      Do you think Yukino is good at sex?    booty blasted worstgirl fag     Bad on day 1. You'll be cumming faster than her on day 3.     Probably a dead fish first, but then warms up and ends up going at it like a rabbit.  Perfect for 8man       No. For one thing she has no stamina. She'll be worn out in ten minutes.  Although for some reason I feel her 'stamina' issue is psychological somehow.       Yeah this is true. But he is going to "save" her not doing the hard work for her. He'll probably become to Yukino what Hiratsuka is for him, someone that cares deeply for the other person and gives advice/wisdom  Ultimately, after Yukino tells the other two what her problems are and listening to what the other two (mostly Hachiman think), she'll do what she wants to do and not copy/shadow anyone      Oh great, as if being autistic wasn't enough    She's a virgin, of course not.  Sensei on the other hand,       I was referring to the "8man != cookie man" meme in case you missed it     Damn, that was cute.    You got it backwards. Yukino is not a virgin, while Hiratsuka is still a maiden.    Like a dead fish.    I can't believe you're arguing about the virginity of a 30-something bombshell desperate for marriage. It's not a bad thing that she's experienced you know. It means more fun, few nights cut short.     She was a great character but...     perfect for a man with dead fish eyes.    You are retarded if you think Hiratsuka would spread her legs in desperation.    fewer*    Why does everyone say this as an expression for bad sex. I bet you haven't even had sex with a dead fish.    8man fucks a panda infront of yukino   Yukino gets fucked by the panda   Happy end       you will never marry a hot obsessive sensei      8man fucks a 8man fucking Yukino     people change a lot after go through university. And saying sensei sill a virgin is just ridiculous. She must have serious problems if it's true.  It's a different case with Haruno when she isn't allowed to be in a relationship though.     Reminder that Yukino and Hiratsuka are as pure as snow.   The Aristocrats.    Isn't 8man the panda? So he's fucking himself then the himself he fucked fucks Yukino?     not posting the superior webm version     She's amazing at it.    It can happen.    Does that mean he's getting cucked by the himself that he fucked?    Yahari has the  DEEPEST LORE     Hachiman would suck in bed so they go perfectly together     No best version     Who would have the most sexual chemistry? 8man and Yukino, Iroha or Yui?     Iroha has blown Tobe more times than I can count.    Iroha is for sex Yui is for cuddling Yukino is for cuddling Pan-san      Girls don't need stamina to have good sex    Yukino or Iroha Dead fish and dead fish eyes synergy vs. experienced in sex Yui is too dumb to have sex correctly      Karen replaces Yui in the Service Club, how does the series change?   Guys I kinda liked first season besides the episode where the shitty bitch cried on stage in front of the entire school. Is the second season even worth picking up or does it become Oreimo S2 tier waifu wars?     For one thing she has no stamina. She'll be worn out in ten minutes.  I don't get this logic. Do people suddenly drop dead after feeling worn out from running? That's basically what you're saying here.     8man fuck hayama infront of yumiko   yumiko fuck yuis dog infront of yukinos car      No. For one thing she has no stamina. She'll be worn out in ten minutes.  Why does everyone assume you just stop going after she's tired?     They didn't read the doujin where even when she ran out of stamina she could still do something  Kinda shows how much these kids know about sex       What?    This is worse. This has /pol/ level hate.         Best ending    You don't need to read a doujin to know that you don't stop functioning as soon as your stamina bar depletes to 0 which is what every faggot with their dead fish meme is apparently advocating here.     too dumb to sex  right, because fucking like an animal requires a literary bent.      Yahallo no more.   Ain't gonna watch it.     Who else didn't see the love triangle coming?    118 / 29 / 39   You guys need to calm down.         Eh? They both like Hikitani-kun!?      NTRing Yumiko  What kind of a sick fuck would do that to such a kind girl?     hnnnnggggggg IROHA OR DEATH     She gets to NTR Yukino's car so it's ok     This has /pol/ level hate  What does that mean?      She must have serious problems if it's true.  No shit? she's still unmarried.    So what do you guys think is Yukimom and Yukino's disagreement/conflict?  1. Yukino studying abroad 2. arranged marriage with Hayato 3. stop education and be a "perfect bride" 4. they don't want Yukino to have a cat 5. Yukimom wants to throw away all the pan-san merchandise  Also, who will reveal it? Hayato? Haruno? Yukino?            Nice, Hikitani-kun! Two hot chicks are after you, lucky dog.     He must be a bit new around these parts    Don't ask, you don't want to start another nuclear bomb shitposting    Still better than waifu wars.    Probably going to same college and following same career path as Haruno.    That's pretty normal for a general. Several threads ago we hit bump limit with only 98 posters.    Yui isn't capable of boiling water, what makes you think she's capable of having sex correctly?    Yukino will be studying abroad, she's in the International Curriculum.     1. Yukino studying abroad  cop out  2. arranged marriage with Hayato  will come out of nowhere and cause unnecessary drama and this LN will continue for 5 more novels  3. stop education and be a "perfect bride"  unrealistic and stupid  4. they don't want Yukino to have a cat  realistic  5. Yukimom wants to throw away all the pan-san merchandise  she wouldn't dare                5. Yukimom wants to throw away all the pan-san merchandise  They say she has schizophrenic delusions because of Pan-san, but she knows what she saw that night.     Why is Yukimom so daft? Does she not realize that everyone has strengths and weaknesses? Likes and dislikes? She should find out what Yukino is actually capable of, what she is suited to do, before trying to control her life.  Once you figure out what her talents are and where they can be best be applied, then you can begin engineering her future and convincing her that it's "what she always wanted to do."        But if its about her career? What do they want for her? Be a politician? And also, why would she disagree to this to the point of moving out?      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;2 . arranged marriage with Hayato  will come out of nowhere and cause unnecessary drama and this LN will continue for 5 more novels  Hallo, I'm WW Thank you for your idea, now I can pay Eguchi a trip to Thailand       I think it was mentioned at some point that Yukimom wanted Yukinon to study science like Haruno? This would separate her from her friends so I can see where the disagreement comes from.    Given all the flags we've gotten, I definitely think Yukino is going abroad by the time the series ends  Currently, she is on the same path as Hachi/Yui and before she was just following Haruno's science track. But by going abroad (since shes in international curriculum) she is going down her own path and not copying/chasing anyone. It makes the most sense given what we know  She leaves either in Year 3 (end of the series most likely) or some timeskip ending where she studies in an overseas college        From what I've gathered skimming the LNs, Yukimom wants both her daughters to pursue science majors in college, probably so they can become doctors.  It's just typical Tiger Mom shit. I think Yukimom is actually smart and playing the long con on Yukino, convincing her that the rebellious thing for Yukino to do would be to become a prestigious lawyer.  It's all part of the keikaku.       Now that's alpha.   Certainly fits in with the larger theme of Yukino wanting to escape the shadow of Haruno.   There was some faggotry about Hachiman rejecting Iroha last thread. Is there some truth to it?    My fetish is when a low stamina girl is all tired out but the guy just keeps fucking her because she's too exhausted to make him stop and he just keeps doing it until she's cum like a dozen times and is just a quivering mess lying in a puddle of her own fluids.      B-but that's not possible! You are a guy!      yfw 8man could have done this in the infirmary but didn't because he wasn't assertive enough     What do you think? Just your usual damage control    It's just over-enthusiastic people reading way too much into the writing. If he was gonna reject her it would definitely be way more pronounced and you would know when it happened.     Why would he? Iroha has no feelings for 8man!    He responded to her in a way that was not genuine. Make your own judgement    Is it wrong want to kill a cunt?     That's it? And why doctors? They are a family of politicians right?     Yukino   friends             Yukimom wants both her daughters to pursue science majors in college  Chapter?    YAHALLO  Why is she wearing ropes under her clothes? Is she a pervert?  Now that 8man told Yui to be genuine with her feelings and for Yukino to do things for herself what is to stop a love triangle from forming?    Actually, I want to add another entry:  6. Yukimom wants Yukino to go to a better school but she chose Sobu because  Hayato was there.   Also, about the arranged marriage thing. There are some points that I could support it:   Haruno doesn't want Yukino to get married to Hayato, so she ships her to 8man   8man's monologue of rich people marrying their children for family ties   Yukino gets depressed when she mentioned her mom wants a lasting relationship with the Hayama family              Not that anon but you can reason it out  Vol 6 during fireworks Haruno learned from Yui that Yukinon was going science track and she seemed upset by that (following footsteps). Vol 11 when Yukimom learns that Yuki is going on the lib arts path she starts going on about she is worried about whether Yukino is going on the right path for her future  We also know from Vol 10 that her career path ties in directly with Hayama's. Hayama as we know is going lib arts when he told Hachiman during the marathon. And Yuki even said to Yui/Hachiman that their mother wants a lasting relationship between the two families and one such way was to have both Hayama and Yukino go on different career tracks  That's my best guess and its also why I think Yukino is ultimately going to go abroad when the series is over          She's a slut.    Oh my.     over-enthusiastic people  you spelt denialfags wrong though.     Yukino's feelings for Hayama.     That's why it's trash now, Outdated meme, you live under a rock?     It's probably a fancy camisole.     Yukino   friends  Epic.       I've never known the touch of a woman since leaving my mother's breast  ftfy      Isn't she out of the house before the three even met?     Haruno could have just been disappointed about Yukino copying her choice. And I think Yukinomom would have reacted like that regardless of what she said.     implying that a girl who put on a dog collar without hesitation when given one isn't into kink   implying that if she win she's not gonna have genuine BDSM sessions with 8man      Yui probably. 8man doesn't seem the proactive type at all, so a lover who will just climb all the hell up on him and not quit until they're both sore is going to be the best bet.  Iroha comes in second because she'd be able to tease him into action eventually. With Yukino I just can't see the two of them having a super-active sex life, but by the same token I doubt it'll bother them much either.     I'm just here to say how much I love yumiko    チーン　チーン   Subtle.      based ponkan    How correct should it be when she's about to unleash her 2+ years of sexual frustration on the 8inch?    In the first LN it was said it was some kind of pendant or locket she was given 10 years ago. But it's just some fancy bra with extra support for her Yuis.     Why does she look like Honk?     Thank you for your idea, now I can pay Eguchi a trip to Thailand   implying WataWata would want to ruin his beloved's perfect body   You're dumber than a denialfag.        normal shirts behaving like latex bodysuits  Gets me everytime     8man fucks komachi infront of taishi   taishi fucks kamakura infront of yukino     8man's reaction to the spoon exchange can be read as a tacit rejection on his part, yes. At the very least it's more plausible than the assertion that 8man was intentionally making a pass at her.       anon fucks logic infront of other posters      yfw, originally WW used childhood promise with key + locket to bind the main trio together.   Then he switched to suicidal dog because Komi knocked his front door.     Iroha is not even a virgin. Why do people like her_   Don't know about sex, but damn the teasing would be NNNGGGHHHH   IROHA OR DEATH btw         In the first LN it was said it was some kind of pendant or locket she was given 10 years ago.   o u        a cat is fine too     Exactly. Just take one look at the outfit she was wearing for their shopping date; she may as well hang a sign around her neck that says "collar me, train me, make me your breeding bitch"   And that's reason #88 why she's Best Girl      SORE ARU!    I already ate Sensei's hymen, along with virtually 80% of Japan's virgins.     You can buy genuine woman's hymen in Japan?    Stop smelling paint anon    Sorry but dumb sluts like Yui need to be bred by middleaged men, not schoolboys.     Frankly, I have no idea. But despite that, she looked exactly like your typical high school girl. I’ve seen her type around a lot – a flamboyant girl revelling in her youth. Short skirt, three buttons of her blouse popped, hair dyed light brown, and a quick glance at her chest revealed a large heart charm on a gleaming necklace. It was an outfit that completely defied the school code.      I can't unsee Yui now, wanting to be tied up in a tortoise knots.      In the first LN it was said it was some kind of pendant or locket she was given 10 years ago.   Oh boy, I think I got spoilered already   7-year-old Yui playing alone in the park because she had no friends   There was a child there who played baseball alone   She decided to talk to that child and became interested in him   His name was difficult to remember so she gave him a nickname   One day the child gave her a pendant as birthday present   She was embarassed, couldn't find the words and instead brushed it off by calling him kimoi   She realized his eyes and expression suddenly changed   Since that day, that child never came back to the park   10 years later, his suicide dog ran in front of a limo   Someone jumped to save her dog   She saw that student's ID   "Hikitani? Hikigaya?"    The same rotten eyes she saw the day she called him kimoi   She started sobbing   "Hi...kki..."                       Haruno. You don't even have to like her to admit this.    This. For fucks sake, she's fucking hot damn it.    pls no pendants and childhood memories pls no nisekoi pls no pls       Sorry anon, I just don't think she'd be that into you.   I'd murder Watari if he pulled something like this.   That said if it were a much less serious series I'd eat that shit up          8man fuck yui infront of yukino   yuis dog fuck kamakura infront of yukino     Well played    Nisekoifags can grab the pendant and shove it up your asses and use the key to lock your Irohanus.     his suicide dog   his   youtried/10       Literal and figurative sex goddess.     had no friends   *was being shunned by her friends      Damn right! May you live long anon     I'm suddenly getting flashbacks of the dog NTR doujin.    Imagine the amount of sonnets without Yui   How does it feel to be cucked by dogs?     It's like a knot in your guts.     Try it and write us a 100 word long essay on it    Wrong pic.     100 words  nigga, what? That's way too much.     She still hasn't apologized about it yet. Still hasn't thanked hikki for saving her dog.     a reminder for those that didn't read the LN about how much you're missing in this chapter, the service club play a strip card game    What is 8man showing us, /a/?   It's a blank paper. Are you retarded?    What's with the body proportions?    Sure anon. And Iroha rapes Hayama with the tea set while Miura makes good use of the vibration feature of cellphones.      the three idiots colluded to make the two girls strip   All you had to do was to lose the motherfucking game 8man.       8man did lose the game, as a scapegoat for chuuni to win    Yukinoshit haven't even mentioned that it was her car that hit her. Although it was 8man and stupid dog's fault.    I haven't re-read that volume since the first time I read it. It still feels like it belongs in some other series.    Because it's a dick move. It might mean you get to look but it's gonna blow your shot at getting to touch.    hit him*    Did she give birth to a truck or something?     What? They where partners in the game.    Few in number, yet we stand tall brothers.   see   and the image i replied to. that's not fan art, it's from the official LN. for what reason did u think yukinoshita stripped in front of the almost nude 8man?       This explains why is she still virgin and her love for 8man isn't just because of guilt but something more  genuine , childhood friend  yandere  love     Basically he's taking the damage (stripping) for the team knowing his bad luck, the ploy was rather proudly announced after chuuni and 8man won. Pic related, smug witty bastards.      "p-please.. let me rest a littl- AAAAAAAAhn&lt;3"         is from volume 11 ?       Nope    She didn't stripped. She was just trying to cover her mouth and nose because Yui farted and apparently the room was going Chernobyl    I'd say 1-3 and 5 all feel like they fit well together. 4 is a little different but it still fits with the rest of the first half as a "test run" for a longer plot. It's definitely a whole different animal from volume 6 onward though.       This is the real reason why Yukino isn't genuine. It's not because of Hayama or anything, it's because she really likes a panda. Ultimate plot twist.     and 8man's nude torso? was yui's fart so corrosive it melted his clothes?    Why is S2 8man so fucking hot? Is it true that men become more attractive when is surrounded by bitches?   Reminder that yahari threads are pro isreal and gg supporters   Yeah. She had tried to make her own bento that morning. Suffice to say, if Yui ever offers to make you fried chcken start running and don't stop.    That's right. And based on how 8man looks, I'd say his anus is starting to melt    Wish I had photoshop on this computer   I think that during the final episode tomorrow we'll get some kind of announcement.    Gahama-san, I'll give you this in exchange for your virginity     Announcement pertaining to...    only fried chicken? pretty sure everything she makes can be categorized as chemical and biological weapon   pretty interesting expression for a melting anus. it's almost... orgasmic. did 8man has some fetish we didn't know about?        Finally, a live-action movie adaptation of the first few volumes.      ...     Potential OVAs in the future that will cover the ending of the show, something like that?    New Yahari Li ve Action     My sources says its another vita VN directed by watari and kojima    There is nothing wrong with ellipses used in that way.   Does Yukinon want the 8? If so why didn't she let him kiss her.    Have you seen this man?      Implying 8man would have to give her anything for her virginity     Well it's the fried chicken that dissolved 8man's uniform. The tamagoyaki is still slowly dissolving its way through the ground beneath Sobu, heading for the center of the earth.    Post old ponkan art to bait discussion about art progression   Denial shitposting on the rise instead  Can we discuss the ongoing art progression? I beg of you. The cutesy art progress slightly finer on volume 5, then take a massive turn on volume 6. My hypothesis is the change of tone in the LN forces ponkan to adapt a finer artstyle, the art in this volume also differ from 6 meaning the tone actually becomes more serious       I know fuckers like you popped in at around 2 years ago complaining about something everyone has done on this board from the very beginning.     I think the art progression is great. Yukino looks more beautiful than ever.   But my shit is still better looking than Yui and Iroha      and on that day, humanity received a grim reminder...    What nigga? Those fuckers are back? GTFO plebs we don't need more shitty complaining    I think you might be onto something. Volume 6 was clearly an intentional change in tone for Watari, so I can believe he'd have sat down with Ponkan8 to talk about a shift in the art too.  Speaking of the old art though, sometimes I miss the old kinda-tsun Yui. Her smile might be like the sun on a warm spring day, but it's a crime how cute she is when she's angry.   The Service Club's true final request         You are biased shithead.    8man tell Yui to be more genuine with her feelings and not gloss over everything for the sake of superficialness  That of course it going to be the fact she loves him dearly. Unbeknownst to him he just gave her the green light to pursue   8man tells Yukino to solve her own shit and not go with the flow  I can interpret that as her being her own person and going for what she wants. That also may mean that she might actively pursue 8man if that is what she wants. Before I got the impression that even though she had feelings for him she would never pursue but probably would let him take her.       Fuck off. Shit ain't supposed to talk     yukinoshitter calling anyone shit    Just finished S1. Why is Hajime so perfect?   She looks like a  happy  loli Satsuki    :&gt;      I knew there was something familiar about her but I wasn't able to put my finger on it!      Because the writers have everyone agree with every stupid thing she does or rewrite the universe so that she can't do anything wrong. Everyone in the show loves her because she's just that great and she's also the best at everything.                 she's also the best at everything.  I don't think that's true. She's good at everything but there are people better than her which she observes and motivates said people into doing their best. Both Sugane and Joe seem to be stronger combatants (O. D. is a given), Rui is far better at computers than any of them and Utsuutsu's ability makes invaluable in saving lives but everyone had doubts or was misguided on what to do until they crossed paths with this girl.   She's very open and friendly but that also makes her kind of unreachable in a way. I really can't imagine someone trying to flirt with her.       yfw her tits grew in S2   She jiggles now too.          I don't get it, why do retards think she's autistic when she's pretty much the opposite?         She could be perfecter  if my dick was in her mouth      is :&gt; the biggest Sue in recent anime?     ITT secondaries that didn't watch S1 as it aired       secondaries  Rude.     No, she's the biggest  ~ssu     Mary Sue.    Mary -ssu.    How does that even work?     assumptions     Basically, Hajime represents a complete rejection of proprietary, respect, and tradition. I'm not sure how much of this comes across to a western viewer, but she's a really subversive character just because of that, but because of how the narrative treats her defiance. There are characters like this in Japanese fiction, obviously, but they inevitably are punished by the story for their actions. I guess it's sort of like having a character in a western story display absurd levels of hubris, but never suffer any tragic consequence. It really undermines expectations in a deep way. Or, in other words, it's because she's a deconstruction of protagonist archetypes in a wide range of Japanese media.    I think she is forcing it, as in she is friends with everyone but actually with no one. Maybe she isn't true to herself or to others.  Who am I kidding    TECHNOLOGY       Fuck off fateshitter.   I like her healthy look with some clothes. It's weird to have girls like her in today's anime where the only options seem to be slim pettanko or thick supermodel.   Hajime defined the Genki Stu archetype    At least its a nice change of pace. If I had to choose between serious stu (ex. Onii-sama), ordinary guy stu (ex. Kirito) and Genki sue. I'll pick the last one on a whim.   Man I love Crowds, it exceeded all my expectations. Really excited for season 2.   First time pic related showed up, I thought I would hate the character, but he ended up being my favorite. Really loved how everyone on the team had some depth of character, and wasn't just a cardboard stereotype. Well, more than other shows at least.     This is such a shallow understanding of her character that it's probably not even worth responding to. But, honestly, genki is like the least notable part of her character. She speaks to everyone in the most casual forms. She demands anyone to address her only be her first name, and corrects them any time they mess up, in an immediate, friendly tone. The refers to everyone around, even the Mayor, the Fire Chief, etc, by their first name, casually. She completely rejects being put into a sempai/kohai dynamic. All of that is what her character actually is. Genki is a baby's reading of her.    You will never be a cute girl who spends his days in an outrageously small bikini   Is it wrong to sexualize the Hajime?   I hated it at first because if my fond memories of the original ninja science team but once I given myself a chance to watch it I got involved in the plot quickly. It vaguely reminded me of Gatekeepers only more mature (or a more lighthearted Gate Keepers 21). Hope more stuff like this keeps coming.     but they inevitably are punished by the story for their actions  You make a good point. I think that's why Hajime is so refreshing as a character, to me at least.     Nah, like  said, she doesn't give a shit about traditions or social taboos. Her purity probably means nothing to her.    Yes.    Except that she can't not be genki for at least two miserable minutes.    Before Hajime I found implausible to make a character that could be both innocent and smart. As fiction usually puts those traits as opposites. Hajime is very observative and knowledgable in unexpected stuff but refuses to surrender her sense of wonder and faith in others to hard facts. She's pretty unique in that way, at least for an anime character.   GATCHAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAN  :&gt;  </wbr>  When the hell is episode 0 getting subbed?   Never.  A menos que sepas Español     Is it worth watching director's cut of episode 12? Is it any longer than the episode we got while it was airing?   It's a meme    It starts from the normal episode's second half and it's as long as a normal anime episode.  It should help you undertand some things.     Absolutely watch it.     Autism is moe Scissors theme usually reserved for Yanderes Stonking big tits       If you completely understood the original ending, then the cut isn't neccessary.     eh, I need to refresh my memory anyway      hajime   autist      I want to  get exited with  her.   You stupid weeb, even I, an assburgerlord, think Hajime is quite autistic.        She's an autistic savant at making men cum     Isn't one of the big symptoms of autism inability to read social cues or integrate with social groups though? She's friends with people as obscure as the fire chief.     outgoing   engaged   can read people   very autistic, anon       Just remind there is a homo alien living inside her boobs.    Think cause it makes people like you upset.    Groundbreaking BD fixes   Watch ep 12's Director's Cut if you haven't   GGGGGGGGGGATCHAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAN Why is Iwasaki so good    Is that even confirmed yet?   Remember when Gatchaman group was manly men and 1 sexy girl in mini skirt and always showing her pantsu?  Now the group is a panda leader, a homo, 2 retarded girls, a trap and the new member is a loli.     Yes it is quite pathetic and speaks of the times we live in.    He's still in there in Insight episode 0, so yeah. He can apparently manifest himself-ish through Hajime, but only for a short bit.    If you understood OD is still alive and that Hajime's hjimes absorbed Berg insteadof him turning into the red ribbon she was wearing at the end or something like that you must have magical powers or something     panda leader, a homo, 2 retarded girls, a trap and the new member is a loli.  You are forgetting 2 homos in there     She was the reason why I dropped the show. I like genki but there's too much of a good thing. She's too one dimensional and a Mary-ssssu to top it off.  fite me faggots       Plenty of space he might get a roommate in the second season.     So healthy, so lovely.

I literally explained every linguistic concept in the first sentence. If you're too lazy to read it's your own fault.   jeez you guys seriously suck. for those who are new here, you can't learn anything from this egostical shithole. just check the japanese threads in /int/ if you seriously want to learn japanese.  まだ待つの? さっさと早くして!       motivational pose      I literally explained every linguistic concept in the first sentence.  Unfortunately, it's literally a simple list of things to forget.  And he said: - That time - That thing - Stacy - A mother of four and the manager of the school - A home - A store would be forgotten.             Is this the best show Kyoani has made Haruhi aside ?  1: Lucky Star, Kanon, Haruhi, Hyouka, K-On 2: Nichijou, Air, Chuu2, Tamako, FMP 3: Free, Amagi, Hibike, KnK, Clannad     Hibikie is nowhere as good as K-On, mostly because it only took 1 episode and half of the cast is unlikable.    wrong  1. Keion 2. Nichijou 3. Haruhi 4. Hyouka 5. Lucky Star 6. Kanon = Hibike 7. FMP 8. Clannad 9. Tamako 10. Chu2 = Free 11. Amagi                Is this the best show Kyoani has made Haruhi aside ?  More like the greatest show of all time.    Yeah, looking at all those comments complaining about how Japan neglects the Western audience make me feel more affinity with SJWs than I ever thought I would. Where do they get off watching shows made by one country for people in one country and then complaining that those shows weren't made for them? Why do they even care - if they don't like it, why would they want it to be made for them?   LN anticipation and cute Yuushas thread. Will we get more Sequel bait or an actual announcement? Also how many girls got sacrificed during the 300 Years of Vertex Invasions? Will the VN2 ever get script translated?             How can one girl be so bulliable?        Don't bully a Yuusha!     Really Togo? You are the one delivering the womb punch in the last panel...   The balls are stronk in this.  last ep is prob going to have intro to prelims   Souma boys are better than your sport shit boys.    End of camp + karaage + visit  12 episodes is too much for that, but it's not good to leave stuff hanging, so we might see more fillers that take stuff from later in the manga.      Maybe they will adapt the first novel.    If they have token PE classes would they have token drama and music clubs too? Would be useless for a culinary school.   So, what was overall reaction to it? Positive?  Well it was mostly voted AOTS so..  Mostly positive. Threads were mostly shit though.   It crippled me so hard that it gave me an aneurysm. </blockquote>]
