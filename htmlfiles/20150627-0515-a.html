[ New episode Soon  new chapter raws also out   captain a cute    Nee-chan  ;_;    I hate to inform you of this kid but your nee-chan was a stuck up cunt who didn't want to be partners with the hero of this manga.    Nurse Kobayashi is a beauty    Yamano family is a lower class and Eiko worked her way to become a pilot only to see a dude from underground getting fasttracked.    so Capt's cosplaying as a medic this time again?    So the plot is still going nowhere    She isn't this time, working as an emergency nurse under captain uniform, no mask.      yep   truly the best girl    Am I the only one who thinks she looks terrible with her hair down?     Tomboy captain best captain   Nihei wants to sell it so badly.   Looks like it'd hold an onahole.     you will never be able to buy your own Sasaki from MHz     Spotted this during the first glance as well. It does look nice but this is kinda shameless plug.    The spirit of capitalism has found him.    You can buy a bear instead.     /m/ translation done, typesetting etc in progress but there's a readable script on googledocs. <br/>      Then they should've made better looking THI hoodies in white, green, pink and purple.    Nice to see Captain doing field works when her people need the most.  But no more immortal secrets?      Where do I buy this?    here  http://m-hz.net/?pid=90156386     so its confirmed for a timeskip then?    no? it's right after the battle       New episode Soon  10 hours to go...     And then 3 days for subs    i don't get it, i see the episode every friday with subs  with spanish subtitles    Hey I just started season 2 what the hell is this miniature thing?  Pic related 1/2      that tentacle up her ass  I never noticed     2/2    That's Ochiai's waifu    Ah I see...  Is there any real explanation or no? I'm looking at the wiki and theres no info      Read the manga, faggot.    I will after the current season ends.   Which one should I download, and is the 1080 just an upscale?     That's just Bestgirl, anon. Don't worry about it.    Read the manga you colossal faggot         Well tanikaze finally gets his true waifu.     $32 for a fucking thermos  The fuck is this?     Both TV and BD. BD has different angles.    Hopefully its truly made for space to justify its price     2D books      nolan pls     Anon, I don't understand what you mean.    Even if she was a bit cunt, she didn't deserve to die. She could be a good tsundere-type member of Tanikaze harem.    surprised she even got noted again    there are people here who would reject the clone of their dead waifu just because she's made of placenta  You people are horrible.    she's a gauna not your waifu    Well meme'd, my friend.    Pity Beni didn't get superior Tanikaze genes.  But then probably the Gauna would've been made invincible.     fuckin' delusional hoshijirofags man   every thread without fail   is a season 3 already announced?   BeniJiro returns   has Hoshijiro's personality and memories   has a split personality   switches to seductive, near-yandere Benisuzume once in a while   mfw        Do want.   New chapter in an hour, right before the stream at latest.   Sadly no.    what are they doing there? saying good bye?    Sales are shit. No S3    Why don't they just sell fucking GBEs    Looked like sales were pretty good last I saw. It was something like 19th this season for all anime at that point.     half of what S1 made   good      You are not alone, anon.   Is yucie dead? Where did the stream go?     To cc   Sidonia threads are so fucking dead it's not even funny.   I'm gonna miss these threads after the season's over. God damn it guys, don't leave me.     Yeah, it's too bad but I guess there really isn't all that much to talk about. It's not one of those stories where you've got no idea what's going on.    Well, now that season 2 ends, they'll probably only get rarer. Doesn't help that the manga is monthly. There's rarely much to discuss.    We will have less frequent threads, but that hopefully means the ones we will have will be better.   I just gotta say the previous episode made my dick diamonds. It's been awhile since I was so excited watching anime.   I sure am expecting the next episode to make my dick diamonds.    This coming episode would break a diamond.    Almost everything has been talked, and Sidonia is not as shippers-friendly as other shows so there are not many shipperfags to drive threads up.  Kinda sad but that's the cycle of it.     GBE is firing today  How closely does the series follow the manga? Are there any crucial details that have been skipped over?  This has definitely sky rocketed to the top of my favorites. Makes me booty blasted there isn't more shit like this.     Didn't cc stop working?    Everything good was skipped. Read the fucking manga, you lazy asshole.   As usual, if you'll see anything fucked up or can think of better phrasing, tell me right away.   No. Was fired back to the basement     First three volumes of manga are free on Amazon right now (2048px).    I know I shouldn't ask for this, but can anyone tell me how to find the Douyu stream? I have no idea what to look for on the site. Otherwise, I'd be fine with any other working stream. Aside from Yucie, the one's I know don't seem to be in use.   Check the archive.            I've participated in just about every thread in the last 2 months and I don't remember anyone mentioning any other streams aside from the ones I already know. Besides, there's only a few minutes left. I know it's a lot to ask, but couldn't you help out an anon for once?  ;_;       You should be able to find it in those few minutes.    Well, I've been looking and I can't. I'm desperate here, man.         tfw I can just copy a link while Angela is playing here  Nah, no spoonfeeding man, gotta respect that board culture          That fucking tea commercial    KITAAAAAA   is that from one of the newer chapters? I stopped following a month or two ago   AH AH AH SIDONIA  And it's lagging as usual.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127209381  Gives me nothing. Fucking hell.      Man. This new Horihone Saizou manga isn't as good as his others.       Oh shit, vag flowers!    HOLY FUCK, THEY ARE ENDING THE ANIME     They are taking over Lem IX anyway, so this still makes sense.       Those 80's-hair-kun and pony-tails-chan again.  Fucking hell. My dick was so ready. Now I have to wait for the raw.    Original anime shit once again doesn't make much sense. What was all that tension in the previous ep if they can just sent all the forces in no time?        End it with Blame!  where the fuck is the live stream?  Would you an elf /a/?  I would    All day, every day.   No, elves are lewd beasts and exist only for extermination  Reminder that Danmachi is pandering garbage for tasteless idiots.   Weird-looking proportions.   I'm gonna miss this show.  Elves are shit  Why is she so sexy, is there any more pics of her clad in her armor like this?   if only your mom swallowed      No. I'd rather make demi-gods with the best goddess.    You're welcome   http://exhentai.org/mpv/826960/9c69<wbr>cfca67/#page7  Oh look, a doujin artist did a better job at interpreting Ais's design than the animators did!   Fuck J.C. Staff.     </wbr>   Thank you so much, I have been looking for more but came up with none.     Best goddess   Not Hephaestus  You have shit taste       http://exhentai.org/mpv/826960/9c6<wbr>9cfca67/#page7</wbr>    eeenope   how do i fix this        My bad, pasted the wrong link.  http://exhentai.org/g/826960/9c69cf<wbr>ca67/</wbr>       http://exhentai.org/g/826960/9c69c<wbr>fca67/</wbr>    worst girl   cant believe i fell for this         Anon says it's about Ais   Says Ais right on the box   "Damn, why are there corn flakes in my box of cheerios?"        now i feel bad     I didn't bring it up to discuss waifuwars. I brought it up to discuss just how shitty J.C. Staff's animation team is.    so we agree ais is shit?    If you're an animeonlyfag then maybe, and only because J.C. Staff a shit. Otherwise Ais a best.    Ais is best girl faggot.    I would accept her surrender.    Are you a faggot son?    you do know that  she is his half sister     Stop with these fake spoilers.    vol 9 LN bitch   would you let her instruct you?    You do realize that even if that wasn't fake, that would only make her even more best girl right     Last volume is volume 8.    not here in japan it isnt    Post some darkies     She looks hot.       Volume 9 will be out in September.    its October where im from    I would an elf, but I would a brown dfc even more    Good taste.    idk which jp you live in but 8 is the latest I know.    So it's like all anime, then?    wow    Posting a shitty character doesn't help you know.    definitely!   Needs more Lili   here you go, this is waht you want right faggot?     Linking worst girl.      Almost July of 2015.   Still no exhentai access.       Still no exhentai access  What?    is eps 13 going to be an extra long eps? will we get a few ova?   I do not have access to exhentai.  The mods said "be patient for your turn".   Several months ago        Elven liberation thread?    being this new   everyone that hat a g-e account before the split has access     Would you a chocolate aiz cream?   What the flying fuck? Since when do you need approval to use exhentai? Are you pulling my leg? Well you aren't missing anything anyway. Hestia holds the monopoly on doujins. Literally pages of nothing but Hestia.         the letter between M and O   Hentai  You're welcome.        needs a cute bulge      guild leader   not the MC   actually does his job decently   asks for help when needed   isn't a dickbag  Danmachi's writing can be considered above-average- for anime- because of Ganesha's role alone.         <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127143210   there is this guild half elf and an aiz one also      most guild leaders rnt dickbags...they even help hestia alot with freebies    Buried under a sea of Hestia. The ration is insane, including fan art, there's like 1 to every 15 Hestias    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127143210  but...that's best elf.    What's the point anyway? They can't even enter a dungeon, and even when they do they can't use their powers. It would be hard to make having a God MC enjoyable in this series. However, I'd love for a spin off of an up and coming God building a familia/Harem and just hanging out with other gods and getting into SoL shenanigans while his cute familia risks their lives to support his dumb ass.       http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/event<wbr>s/boob-ribbon  Within the first 3 weeks, Hestia fanart on the Japanese image sharing website Pixiv increased to more than 1,000.[1] According to Pixiv’s daily view tracker (shown below), the views peaked on April 9th, 2015, with 722,886 views. In that same period, on the online image boards Danbooru[2] and Gelbooru,[3] Hestia’s tag had surpassed 1,300 images, making up the largest quantity of the fanart for the show which contained 1,400 images  what do you expect?    </wbr>     linking that website  This will not turn out well for you.     I'd expect better from Japan. So many great girls and they chose only the generic DereDere cockblocker.     ヘスティア ダン   6171 results  She finally broke 6k.     Nips like generic shit. I mean, they could choise Good Girl Ais, Best Elf, or any of the two maids.  But nope, they go tor worst girl: partypooper.         she is his mom, and japanese love incest     what is the bd sale numbers for danmachi? i heard the LN is going crazy....will we get a season 2?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127143210   wrong elf  But Best elf     I am ready for some   hand-holding  intimacy!    She isn't even full elf   Are there any brown goddess in this series?  I require a full list of all elves in anime.    An elf   Wearing blomers  Is that the ultimate rape magnet?      I would an elf. Totally.  Ryu is totally on another level though. Would want to grow old with.   Even though I'll be the only one looking older          You don't even know their names, fighting style, or race, do you?     I would rather some Asufi.   The hair doesn't really fit    It's an invaluable resource for finding the origins of memes. I don't know what else you would use it for though.     dw bout the bloomers, that ZR!    Why are you so mad? Did the LN writer and JC Staff gangrape your puppy?     What's worse is that "five seconds with the Paint Bucket tool" look      But the fanservice is nice.     Did the LN writer and JC Staff gangrape your puppy?   JC Staff has consistently produce shitty anime for the last 20 years, and this season is no exception.      Not garbage, but worse than this    Just like all other studios. Your point?    brown is best taste    Don't get me wrong. Hephaestus is fine too, but Hesita just has more to offer. She is the goddess of fertility you know.    Anyone got a clean stitch of that?     Hephaestus is fine too   No she isn't.  I believe I speak for everyone here when I say Hephaestus is too old be attractive.          Wonderful. Thanks.       This isn't brown. Just adding a bit of tint doesn't make you brown retards.      Every fucking thread   Isn't today the new episode?   Now draw a slit for her pussy    No. That's tomorrow.     FUCK I GOT EXCITED FOR NOTHING MY DAY IS RUINED     That would only make things hotter.    Could somebody please make a decent edit from this pic?    best ass    That that's just shit taste     being brown doesn't make you brown   lol       Not him but brown people are considered white in the U.S by the government or at least that's what I heard.     Now I feel like eating vanilla ice cream for some reason.   I really like Hestia's body of work     I'd like to hammer her anvil everyday.    Thanks.    True. Her body of work has the best presentation.       So in the latest episode we knew that lily is chienthrope?    This show has a Gaia-tier following.  Back in the day these threads would be imagespammed, sagebombed, and most people would just tell you all to fuck off.   However, the board is so dumbed down now that your circlejerk faggotry just has to be endured..        I really don't like using the word edgy, but seriously.      gaia tier following  Wat ??     The butthurt here is palpable.    If a show is airing then people will talk about it, regardless of how good it is. Since it's popular people will post about it so containment threads are necessary.    You should go complain in the JoJo threads too. They're worst bunch on /a/.     containment threads  that word, etc     I'd watch/read pretty much anything as long as our lord and saviour Yasuda is working on it.   Danmachi isn't even that bad, compared to the average anime out there.        I'm aware.     This. Danmachi isn't GREAT but it's by far one of the best shows i've watched from this season.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dcf<wbr>7dQg0JVA</wbr>  [ ]   How do I open this? All I'm seeing is a sad panda.   What do you call a girl like this?   Don't bother. I got a warning that it's a redirect loop.    Angel.    Idiot savant    Goddess.

Femdom anime is objectively shit, and Japan makes too much of it as it is.       a goddess   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127143210  15 hours. Th-Thanks, mods.     toradora   you dont like the greatest love story every told?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nCr<wbr>1lW67uEQ</wbr>  [ ]       danmachi ost soon?  Shit's ending tomorrow so when are we going to see him pick up girls in a dungeon?   Best girl.    You still haven't realized the tittle was a joke and that the roles got reversed instead? Bell is Aiz's princess.     Bell isn't a women. Men can't be princesses.     But King of Ooo is now princess of the candy kingdom.    I want more fan art of her.    Put Bell in a dress and he could easily pass for a princess.    Go google it you lazy fuck    Japan has shit taste, what can you do   <br/>  <br/>    Femdomfags please go and stay go.       And Aiz is not a man. The point is that the role and the gender archetype for these kind of stories were reversed.     objectively    Is there any other character from any other anime that has become that popular among artists in so short time as Hestia did or does it just seem to me that Hestia is especially popular and there are character like that every season? Also pic somewhat related. Goro fucking a ugly Hestia cosplayer when?    Chaika    Perfect answer.     I was too busy to actively browsing pixiv and other pages when Chaika aired so i didn't know that well. But was it also as fast, so that it had the number of fan art before it ended airing that most popular characters don't reach for a good couple of months after it finished?      Yes, but not really original stuff    how was Witchcraft Works femdom? She was nurturing and maternal which aren't exactly femdom traits.    second best girl    go into Orc dungeon on a quest given by Ganesh   kill all orcs   picking up fat loots, notice secret cave    go into cave expecting more loot   oshit, it's a bunch of chained up elves   their faces in despair. Presumably they've been part of a rape harem for who knows how long   "no need to fear! I'm here to save you ladies"    the look of joy and hope returns to their faces. I am their salvation   psych bitch! kill them all except one   whip out my cock and proceed to rape the last elf until completely mind broken. Leave her chained and return once a week to rape her some more   leave just enough food and water to survive until next week's rape  That's how you treat elves              it's what happens during nurturing    why kill any ..you are suppose to put t hem all in a box and transfer them to your personal rape dungeon   Best deity.

Don't think too hard because they'll run up to your face and tell you, along with their shitty chili farts and fat asses trailing behind.      Texasbro     Holy fuck anon. Next time I need to shave my balls I'll call you.    i ant your bro    What?     Next time I need to shave my balls I'll call you.  what the fuck does that mean? if you want to touch dicks just say so.     I meant that you're such an edgy kid that you could shave balls like a pro.  An inherited skill from your mother perhaps.      you are edgy    But there are so many things that you can shave. And so many other things that requires edge to get the job done. Why balls, anon? Why balls? That's fucking gay.    Because that's the part you work best on.    Why shave and not use clippers? A razor could nick your balls and bleed everywhere.    But being edgy is actually really bad for shaving balls. You don't want someone edgy to shave balls, you want someone who is precise, neat and values hygiene. Being edgy increases the risk of damaging your balls instead. Do you really want that?     tfw you will never go dungeon diving with this qt.   tfw she won't calmly berate you for falling behind.   tfw she won't ever show her dere side to you after you almost die.   &gt;tfw you will never have "we might die tomorrow" sex every night.    &gt;tfw she will never berate you for falling behind while she tries to remain composed with your sword inside her scabbard to the hilt, while she moans quietly.  Just kill me now, there's no point in living.        <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127182600   he doesn't know about the old joke that's been passed on from /a/ years and years ago     too bad she's a dyke and would never touch your cock, not even with a 10 meter FI-YAH-BOLT-OH!   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127182600  It's too late to delete your blunder.     she will never calmly clean you off after a quick hand job     so you would prefer a full blown nigger?    Thanks, now what i am supposed to do with this boner?    run towards one end of your home at full-speed and see if you can pierce the dry-wall with it.    God I want Hestia's tits around my dick and to blow a big load all over them and her face so badly.    I-I'm stuck!!    If you can hold out for 5 more years anon it will happen. China has a jerk-off machine and Sony has an Occulous clone in development. Put on onna hole on the jerk off machine and waifus will be a reality.    so lewd    your waifu won't judge you anon      saved.  Going to need as many images to shitpost with for tomorrow and probably the next 10 days after.     Just shut the fuck up and post more Hestia tits.    don't tell me what to do nigger   I want to pound Bell-kun's qt boipussy while Hestia and Aiz watch.   Only Hestia would care. Aiz would sit in the corner like a soulless retard sniffing and enjoying the stink of her own armpits.    Why didn't they cast Norio Wakamoto as  Zeus ?     I want to taste her foot.     You seem to have something with the fact that Aiz is better than that slut goddess of cocks. Well, if it makes you feel better, you can think that way all what you want, but please don't share your shit taste with us.    Cold as  Aiz .     thinking Aiz the autist is best   Nigger, you have Aizberger's     I prefer autism over midget who screams at you for even looking at another girl or spend half your earnings on perfume while having 40 billion credit card debt.    That debt is for Hestia alone. The fact that she's willing to endure 1000 years of indentured servitude just for Bell is proof that she is best girl. Not only that, but she is canon virgin while Aiz get's molested by her tranny goddess every week.   I know were both just shitposting at this point but I'm enjoying it      Bell spends most of his earnings in the bar    many qt girls in this show   MC is the most fuckable of them all  why.jpeg     it's not gay if it's in a 3-way     Bell gets captured by mad adventures   held down and raped   mind breaks    Hestia goes looking for him   finds him shaking his ass to men in an ally   Brought to you by cannabis          It's not gay in a 3 way    Lili would still find a way to backstab Bell even after Welf had mounted him.     endure 1000 years of indentured servitude  That's like less than 1000000000000000th of a second relative to mortal lives.   I will miss the shitposting when the anime is over and nobody will talk about this series anymore. Just like Tokyo Ravens.

Why is it so pricey?    Made from tiniest threads from Far East silkworm folded 1000x times.  Okay maybe not, it's probably just really pretty.      Snazzy as fuck, I guess.  The japanese are really into their kimonos.      472 for vag...but how much for anal?    If you can clear level 60 her anus is all yours.    why is the left one serving rocks?    That's what they ordered     that CD player  This picture is from 2000-2002 right?      Anus   I want her womb. I want to make demi-gods.      It's called a sound system, have one similar that I bought new around 2005. Off by couple years, bruh    sperm wyrm    Anal sex is better    I know Ais doesn't poop, but I'm sure Hestia does.     a goddess   needing to poop  Aiz, however, does poop in the canon      Goddess on mortal realm with all her power sealed. Ais doesn't need to poop because there's no bathroom in the dungeon. You can't go on two weeks without pooping in the dungeon (the length of her expedition for Floor 59), so it's proven she doesn't need to poop.    They probably have slimes they keep in captivity from the first floor that they shit in.     he doesn't know Aiz drops turds in the dungeon so they can find their way back out  level 1 pleb      there's no bathroom in the dungeon  the whole dungeon is one giant bathroom.     Basically everyone has smelled Ais' shit already then, what a slut.    Just like her ancestor.    Freedom descending to Earth and kicks everyone ass. Best gundam moment ever.    What?  Based.      You can't go on two weeks without pooping in the dungeon (the length of her expedition for Floor 59), so it's proven she doesn't need to poop.  Where the hell did you get this from? Anything that goes in must come out, Aiz eats therefore she must also poop. She can probably poop on demand though, like she can sleep. Like you're inside the dungeon for too long and suddenly aiz turns to you, looks you dead in the eye and says "I have to take a really mean shit, right now. Those potato croquettes are doing a number on my stomach." You can't say no, man, when you gotta go you gotta go. And you have to stick close to her while she either shits on the ground or in the bag where she kept the rations, dungeons aren't fun and games, mate, one wrong move and your bitch ass is dead, you need to piss and shit on the go, in front of everyone in your party if need be.         This is not a Hestia thread you dumbass.   Or at least it wasn't until the hestiafags invaded us       Always     e x p a n d      That makes no sense, people go in dungeon everyday. The early levels barely have any plants, how the fuck do they recycle?  Does the dungeon actually eat up all their shit and give birth to the monsters? That's so fucked up.       If you go into the dungeon for a day you won't need to shit, dumbass. Now if you spend days at a time in there, which means your probably exploring pretty deep then you'll need to shit.     It all depends on personal preferences. I want vaggo and womb. Others prefer anal.     invaded  We're in EVERY Danmachi thread. So it's always a Hestia thread.         We're in EVERY Danmachi thread. So it's always a Hestia thread.     Why the hell would one prefer anal anyway? Tightness? How it might feel depraved?  It takes too much work to actually do it decently. The girl needs a fully relaxed anus and you need a lot of lube since the anus can't self lubricate, not to mention an enema or two to be absolutely sure theres nothing in there beforehand is a must unless you want shit on your dick, and even then your dick might still have the smell of shit afterwards.      2D girls don't shit unless your fetish is shit.    The US government does everything in their power to label as many people as possible as "white".   Jesus where did she came from?!   Goddamnit Hestia     ye.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=uQv<wbr>3K0g7aAc</wbr>  [ ]  It's okay, this will happen when Bell x Ais fight against the Black Dragon.

Or is that it      She being likable is a meme, something not to be taken seriously.    she's really affectionate and she  pleasures Hephaestus for weapons .

Syr isn't even an elf fuck     Those are some fine lasses.    This bitch is way behind the many other girls from the series like that loli helper girl.    Not even on my radar.   Does anyone seriously like aiz? She's disgusting  when new episode? how many hours left?   Only if your an anime only fag       I am an anime only fag thought she's bland looking and her personality is even worse. From what I read, she's only nice to him to see how his growth rate is so quick. She's pathetic.     Then you didn't read very far or you are retarded if you caught up, or maybe you didn't read it at all. It's clearly written that it's more than this.    that scene was the first time I strait paused it, jacked until I came, and played again in about 4 years     loled hard     muh duck!         <br/>         Nice triples? What's the point of this screen cap    look at the board title    Yes, and?   it's not as witty as you think        Either that, or you're a humourless fuck.  I cracked a grin at it.        Shouldn't Aiz's eyes be yellow, no blue?     https://archive.moe/a/thread/127017<wbr>683/#127018507</wbr>    Vanilla  Aiz     It's best     Aiz isn't even that great.     Many people would disagree with you. Just like with the guy in your pic.      With your dick, right?    Get used to it. This is your life now.        What do?   That's a nice room.    Holy shit that room      You guys would like any furnishings.  Personally I prefer my tables a little higher.  Looks like it'd have a good view from the balcony, though.          Anti kyon people will bitch it's a filtered picture or some shit     Gelatinous cubes roam the dungeons, absorbing and dissolving any discarded material.    7 hours until last episode. I seriously hope this ends at least enjoyably, maybe with an announcement for a second season like Chaika. I'll fucking rage if it ends in a "Buy the LN" vibe like many adaptations, especially since Yen press killed off fan translations.     Damn that was a hot doujin    Yes it was, Anon Yes it was     That room looks like it has a nice view. I'd probably put a drawer next to the bed for a alarm clock or some nice figures. Maybe a bean bag for comfiness too.     killed off fan translations  The fuck? How is such a thing even possible?    DHL just rang my doorbell. Good day.    a bean bag for comfiness  Maximum comf.     So drops get cleans in x amount of time. That's how I like my servers, no item lag    I hate you buy fags, supporting the anime we love and all    By DMCAing translator's sites. In a way fan translations are a form of "Piracy". Which people don't really care since it isn't serialized outside the countries they are meant for.  Others drop it because "why bother". Pro translators are getting payed to do it while they would have to do it on their spare time and host it for free. I wouldn't mind it that much if I lived in America, but fuck ordering overseas, never had a good experience with that. Yen Press is also slow to fucking catch up, only the first volume has been released as of the beginning of the year. It will take at least a few years for them to catch up to fan translations by the way things are progressing.         Most translators drop their projects when its contents gets licensed in the US, happens all time for manga too.  That means you're either importing the localized content, which may be costly (especially if you're not murrican, with currency conversions, import taxes and shipping), terribly translated and take years to catch up to japan (assuming it ever do) or get fucked.  Unless for a stroke of luck it's also localized in your country (but as far as LNs goes i think US is the biggest market) or you know moon, but the you wouldn't be here asking for translations i guess.        Bookdepository is a thing if you want to avoid 'murica's insane shipping charges.     DMCA   It's fucking nothing.jpg  Only retards think that has any ability to do anything. Nyaa and torrents exist for a reason.   Dropping when licensed is fucking annoying. I don't understand why scanlators have this rule. Fortunately much less of an issue for me now that I can read raw manga.        I want to gangrape Bell with twin browns    sex with Bell-kun   Faggot.       Only retards think that has any ability to do anything. Nyaa and torrents exist for a reason.  It's a combination of both points, to be able to call a DMCA then that means it has been serialized, ergo point 2.  Dropping when licensed is fucking annoying. I don't understand why scanlators have this rule.  I believe its the fact they'd rather be translating something that people won't be able to get translated in the foreseeable future. Remember, these cunts do it for free, and I have yet to know of someone able to subside solely on donations. Would you rather translate something that you can find only raws of or to waste your time translating things that already have people being payed to translate it? The issue to have should really be translator drama that sometimes pops up.         Caring about laws is what's killing fansubbing, fuking pussies  I dropped this because JCstaff seems to want to throw Hestia into everything.  Hell, she's non-important after vol 2 yet Anime keeps cutting scenes from other characters and putting only hers.  I don't dislike Hestia, I dislike the fact that other characters get shitted on just so the Anime director can fulfill his headcanon of Hestia being important in DanMachi       It's also because of Hestia that the other 10/10 girls barely get any fan art or doujins of, goddamn it Japan.     I believe its the fact they'd rather be translating something that people won't be able to get translated in the foreseeable future.  And if we go back this point :  take years to catch up to japan (assuming it ever do)  When they drop something, it's usually too late for the official release to anything of value. Only the most hard-core fans will wait for the official translations to catch up, with most forgetting about the series by that point. Then there's also the localization issue, which I'd rather not get into, but it's there.  Not entirely sure why I'm arguing this though. Like I said, it doesn't really affect me anymore so I have no reason to argue on this subject.         I remember watching Sakurasou and dropping it on one of the last episodes, only to find out later that they completely butchered it by turning a side character into a main love interest. Why are they allowed to get away with this shit?    No, it's because Japanese have shit taste    I wouldn't really call this an argument since were both arguing for the same thing anyway. Whatever reason. Most translations die the moment they are serialized that's a fact.      It's just JC being shit.  I don't really get it. You know what's worse? Harem LN writers are so fucking beta that he'll probably start giving Hestia attention now that's she's more popular due to the anime. He'll probably stop giving a fuck about the other girls or will just make Bell like Hestia instead of Aiz.       Japan loves Hestia, loves her so much that she already broke 6000 on pixiv. There's 1 pic of a different girl for 20 Hestia's. There's like one aiz doujin and recently one for Aina, the rest is all Hestia. It's their shit taste, anon, that lead to this in the first place.  I think that's already happening, anon. If what some LN anon's say is true then. Bell is actually entertaining the possibility of Hestia as opposed to not even seeing her that way at all.          I think 2 nukes were too much, no taste left    But what if the two nukes are the reason there is any Danmachi?    The irony in all this is that while Japan has the shittiest taste to ever curse someone's palate, they are, at the same time the ones that give us all the best girls and best shows and all that jazz.    If that actually happens, then anime will be the worst thing that has ever happened to manga and LNs. It's bad enough with all of the studios either being Production can't animate for shit, 1courhouse, JC rewrite, and yurishit. The worst part is that they give over half of their budget for a show to worthless VA leeches that would be nothing without the hard work of authors and artists of these series.   Entertaining is whatever. If he ends up with her instead of Ais then JC Staff needs to burn down. Harem end is acceptable too I guess.       So we need a 3rd nuke to get s2?    I was thinking a 3rd and a 4th.    Anon, we are trying to fix the Mongolian puppet shows not eradicate the whole place.    Where is a good place we can nuke japan so their taste will improve? Not the country side, I ♡ non non biyori    Just little nukes. They can't do that much damage.    /a/ suddenly hates Hestia   is this some new meme?     It's summer.    I like this meme better on /sp/    Angry   Has this been one of the best seasons for qt animu grills in living memory?     animeonlyfags      To people with seasonal waifus. .....     There is literally nothing wrong with seasonal waifus.    This show is doing things to my dick   Into a vagina?    post more pics    I'm about to scan it, I'll post later.    Seriously, Drow are shifty cunts.    Dark elf...shiet...      Rape 1st, then she accepted her new master     He'll probably stop giving a fuck about the other girls or will just make Bell like Hestia instead of Aiz.  2ch was pretty much complaining how bells exp boost is basically useless because what happen in vol 8 and how some who bought the LN to read for hestia was disappointed with her lack of relevance and her repetive scenes that they begun to like the other girls instead.     TOTALLY. 100%. MOTHERFUCKING, YES.     raping    elves   Elves aren't for rape, anon.       /tg/ would like a word with you.    ppl can't be hardcore anymore?

Meanwhile, their normalfag Chink brothers and sisters have zero problem subbing in chink runes, HOLLYWOOD MOVIES AND TV SHOWS, and not giving a single fuck about DMCAS despite the fact the DMCAs are from the Hollywood Mafia.  Meanwhile, weeaboo chink translators piss in their pants from getting an email from Yen Press.  Why are weeaboo chinks so fucking beta?         are you gay?   For tonight, who will stream? Yucie's site seems ded.   all day err day.    Oh, a short story is included. I take it nobody wants to translate it?     china isn't a part of the TPP right? looks like we might all have to learn chink runes in the future if we want to read mangos/watch animus    Aren't chinkrunes the most difficult runes to learn?   how good is the anime received in jp? With all that rushing and stuff they leave out.   How did she get the burn on her eye?   I'm thinking it has something to do with Welf. Maybe related to the Magic Sword and why he's so reluctant to make one.      average.    As far as i know the BD isnt doing that great majorly because of the cut and replaced scenes and some of the LN fans wont buy it because of what anime did,especially the after minotaur battle with the zeus scene which is an important part of Bell's motivation.    At least the LN sales are skyrocketing.     Was a shame they didn't put this in the anime.      Guys, you don't even know. I have a thing for taller girls and being forced.  I'm fucking huge and it'll never happen to me too.       I don't get it.   Filthy elves need to be purged.    tall girls / femdom are a really shitty combination, anon, and i think most of /a/ agrees with me here.      X is a meme  looks like summer is here     Fuck you, mate.    You have the shittiest of tastes.    Get out.       liking tall girls + gentle femdom   Sigmund Freud was completely right.        What's the matter anon, afraid of big and strong women?     he lets a narrow range of fetishes dictate his life  Look at this faggot and laugh.     You will get hyped at the end if they adapt a certain scene. Will certainly make you want to know more, and there are rumors that they will adapt Oratoria after this.    The source material us not enough.     6, 7, 8.   It's enough now. And considering the content, 13 episodes would not be enough.     They already adapt 5 volumes. Dropped into three is weird moves. Why do you think 3 volume is enough and the 8th volume ending is fit for the 2nd season ending?     Akihabara.    Does anybody have a version with all the fucky lines connected?    Hiroshima improved their taste last time.     I didn't want to point this out because everyone seemed to be having a good time.     The imperfect animation is an allegory for how all humans are imperfect, yet it is precisely those imperfections that we love, and it is those differences that create the irony that dictates life.     It looks to me like the animators got really lazy and just zoomed in on what was intended to be a background-sized illustration.    I fucking love you anon. Maximum homo too. Are you gonna get the rest of the BDs?     Disgusting.   since yucie and neet is kill, where now?   yucie and neet under their new names, silly princess.   it's on.  http://board.futakuro.com/jk2/res/1<wbr>682417.htm</wbr>     Yes, I ordered all of them.   What is Eren doing in this Episode?  RYUSAAAN     Link to live stream guys. yucie and neetball are both dead is appears.   nigga titan   there is a hint ^. Do some search it's easy    playstation2    Put two and two together, they made it more obvious in the anime by giving her the same hair color as a goddess.     FAIABORUTO   which was the hint?     assholes.         I blame JoJofags and Fatefags for linking the stream everywhere        that image   Cancer.        It's just JC being shit.  No, it was retarded director from Madhouse        RIP S2   Of course, it has a Facebook filename.     As a novelfag, I've been defending this series the entire time, but this episode was absolute garbage.  Fuck JC for pandering to Hestia and making shit up that they think is cool. The storyboard and directing were pure manure this episode.  Please for the love of god don't make season 2. Fuck this shit.      Where the fuck were you guys watching this?     How the fuck did they manage to make Welf look like a fag?    read the thread   I couldn't defend this at all, since they started rushing things.         see<br/>    Oh god why     Anyone that enjoys what I don't like is dumb :C     I READ THE DAMN THREAD. Nothing is mentioned except that Yucie and neet are dead.    no you didn't   Animeonly fag here, was the last ep rushed or did it go anime original?   Fucking retard see<br/>    no one was kind enough to post the names dumbass.    at least try    It's hard to tell when someone isn't being serious or being a wise ass. They just posted Playstation2, like telling the person to twatch it on their Playstation 2. They didn't says "Neetball's new name is "Pleaystation2."  Sorry for my outburst. I've had a very bad day today from the moment i woke up.      They took Hephaestus body and slapped his head on it?    do you even archive? dumbass     You will never go into a Dungeon with an elf    why is ryu so perfect?    Meaty.      Being this new      I must warn that you're going against the cultural grain by holding that opinion.   When are these two going to fuck?   When they both give up on Bell-kun as their harem leader.    What's yucie's new name then?   There are people out there who don't find this attractive.   I want to hot glue it.    Welf has a waifu   Or this    The rear view is better because the front is so ridiculously out of proportion.     Elfs are for raping they said. They will enjoy it they said.  Oh well, call me oneesan from now on.      Characters you'd breed with.    Kobeni is ultimate wife material  Eerytime she's on screen my hips start moving on their own.   Shit taste, anon.    You sick fuck she's some kind of alien dog you know?     truest of the true         You know it   The need to breed   breeding with anything else then your waifu     Casual sex is ok though     Your waifu is a cuck, are you aware of that?     anon   Look again. Its a redditor.        Child bearing hips    THIS a million times     Fuck off already.     Pic related.           Mikakunin is probably the anime with the most wasted potential.  Great OP and ED Great character designs Great waifu Great loli Okay onee-chan Interesting premise  But it somehow didn't deliver. I know nothing about the series aside from the anime but I suppose this was just advertising for its source material?             Top quality breeding material.    Breeding with someone as flat as a washboard   Do you want her to die while giving birth?       Kobeni is ultimate wife material   clingy, obsessive, and shallow   abandonment issues    will never ever trust you   I'm convinced people who this never actually watched the show.         Careful! You could cut yourself on that chin.    Will S2 happen     Perfect body   gorgeous face   can cook   can clean   will never cheat because shes loyal   What can you ask for more                and?    The actual main story was pretty shit, the side-stories and daily distractions were much better, if it was an SoL it would have been 20x better. Kinda felt like they tried to force a pretty crappy story near the end into an SoL.      I want her to carry my son.  Why don't you like old hags, /a/?  They're called christmas cakes  But i love em, theyre the peerfect breeding material   Got any source? Tried various times, and all it leads to is /r9k/, with no leads. Sorry for being a faggot    The artist is Redrop faggot.   I personally prefer Christmas cakes to MILFs. But they're both great.   i thought it was the same    Cakes are 25+ with no kids.    I Smell NTR     like MILFs   don't like NTR   What a terrible mixture.       Not him, but I just like older women. If it has to be a MILF, why can't she be divorced or a widow? Why go through the trouble of introducing a husband purely so he can be cheated on? Divorce is (way too fucking) common nowadays, you can easily use it as an excuse to have a single MILF.  What the fuck is it with the Nips and NTR?       they're aroused by shame?     I don't give a shit about cheating when there isn't this perverse and obvious sexual thrill from watching some guy's life shatter.  It's attention better spent on the actual sex      only if they're over 24 and unmarried   and i do   because of this          Yeah. I guess I wouldn't care about a throwaway line like 'Oh I hope my husband doesn't find out~'. But NTR just makes me feel bad for everyone involved.   My favorite.  Best MILF ?   it is the most popular fetish among betas and nips are genetically beta    Is Step-MILF a thing?     I guess I wouldn't care about a throwaway line like 'Oh I hope my husband doesn't find out~'  Why? That line has to actively be thought up and written. You could just as easily NOT mention a husband. In fact, that's even fucking easier.     I don't know. Give it that 'forbidden lust' appeal or something. I don't care for that stuff but I can deal with it when it's that minor, but it rarely is. I just don't get the fetish or why it's so widespread.   Old hags are not cute.   Do you get to fuck them all in the VNs?    Yes.    Cool.    I guess I will play the VNs, but not because of this.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127198389  Makeup, photos hop and plastic surgery   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127198389   Demi moore was a shit even as young woman, there are better example.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127198389  is that picture supposed to look good      well a christmas-cake marrying a man with a child might be it, there's actually a manga that revolves around a story of one living with a NEET    when's the release date anon ?     Now.     holy shit bless you   Because I want to fuck young pussy.   You are my superhero anon.       I want to shag a hag.      Not liking MILFs and disliking NTR  Shit taste     I want to bag a baabaa   hags are gross   MILF &gt; lolis Hotness &gt; cuteness     Is this anime worth watching if you're into older grills tenderly loving younger men?   IMHO (2D) MILFs generally aren't hot as much as they're mature and respectable.      Cakes are for vanilla Milfs are for NTR    Sad but true.    Perfect.    Not even the best 2hag     sauce on this cake? Google didn't help     But she's not a mom.   Unmarried old hags are mirracle of  dunya and akhirat.      http://exhentai.org/g/318606/5ab936<wbr>a200/</wbr>      Hush now, making widows happy is a perfectly acceptable form of lovemaking and doesn't have anything to do with NTR.   http://exhentai.org/s/8c420ae687/75<wbr>0511-126  Widow discovers SM mags, gets frisky with trap maido. Happy story for those who like em.  </wbr>  I have a soft spot for cake teachers.   Widows are honorary Christmas Cakes. New Year's Eves?  I knew a widow called Eve. This is weird.       I'm really happy about figuring out the artist by the eyes and the blushing type alone.    all females are for NTR that is why you don't go near them     Widow milfs are top-tier; all the benefits of a milf without the infidelity aspect.  Also, for hilarity: M(ale)ILF http://exhentai.org/g/779073/1d6617<wbr>bf09/</wbr>       What about milfs teachimg lolis how to love? /ll/ is such a rare occurrence, but when i find some, my dick is diamonds     http://exhentai.org/g/628370/351c2f<wbr>a51d/  The funny part is, the only rape in it is the reverse rape at the beginning, and he gets into it soon enough  </wbr>    Why do you say sorry you faggot?    New Year's Eve is already used to describe single women 31 and older.   Year End Soba.   Captcha   Select all images with cakes         Let's be honest you claim you like milfs but you post babyfaced OW    Then why do you post a lolifaced "milf"       Google loves to rub it in, don't they?  Also, betafags chime in if you dream of a cool beautiful office lady dominating you after work.     Why can't cakes win more often? I'm not asking for a lot, maybe one or two more anime, three or four manga. I know we have VNs, but even then incest seems more common than cake routes.    http://exhentai.org/g/779073/1d661<wbr>7bf09/</wbr>  i beg to fucking differ a large onee-chan is fine too http://exhentai.org/g/373352/fd04f9<wbr>ce60/</wbr>      All of my love for Kaede.   Only when people can't accept that the stupid bitch lost http://exhentai.org/g/780240/73fc99<wbr>aaef/  That Sarada, though  </wbr>    Know better than this? Don't think so.    Chiba Toushirou&gt;Takasugi Kou    She's gorgeous. Been thinking about picking up Idolm@ster just for her but as far as I can tell she's not really that prominent in it.    MILFs calling themselves "old lady", not in the "Do you really like an old lady like me?" kind of way, but in the desperate older woman who hasn't had sex in years and is degrading herself for any cock that offers itself to her way   alternatively, young fit men with older, MILF women, constantly calling her "old lady" to degrade her    Ara ara, come wash my tail anon-kun.  Can't we just agree that all ara-ara's are amazing? http://exhentai.org/g/662860/b14355<wbr>1c0c/</wbr>    a furry ara-ara is okay too http://exhentai.org/g/672569/b089b4<wbr>b846/</wbr>     Mamizou isn't a furry.    Pssst.   She's not actually the mom.     Because they always have giant disgusting fatty cowtits. Even worse, they're sagging half the time.   Furry, as in, "covered in fur" Not the bad kind of furry, just an deliciously plump ara-ara who happens to be a fox goddess     Oh but i do.    Pedo pls go.    Iri is MILES better than Illya    What?    You and your loli cancer, take this the loli thread.     I don't know what your definition of loli is, but  isn't even DFC.     How the fuck is Mamizou a loli?     I think you guys need both your eyes an brain checked if you consider this a "grown" woman.      she has a tail, cat ears and claw   no furry   looks like a teen   no loli   no denial         Full retard.    Tanuki tails are my fetish.    Please just go.      I've never understood this milf-schoolgirl fetish.    Fuck off.   What about milf butt?   Here I'll help you reach the exit     Literal autism.    I think her ass and my face make a great match.    This one? https://vndb.org/v5154/chars     Sequel never  There are actually people who like old hags.    wrinkles  thats my fetish        milf    Best milf     Not posting the one true Robo-MILF   Gee, I wonder who could have made this thread.    babyface   looks just like her underage daughter   milf       Some anons mother?    Who's this faggot trying to ruin the thread?    Don't pick on a invalid anon.    You do realize that milf has nothing to do with age, right? It's whether or not she's a mother, which she is.  Also   Akiko   Not best milf   Your shit taste has reached glorious heights.          Milf isn't a body type. Pic related is a milf.      Not with idiot western media. To them she's loli     You do realize that milf has nothing to do with age, right    Of course it does  Even on porn sites and everywhere else people don't care is she is a mother or not they always associate milf with middle-age woman.  Don't be stupid anon.          I hope your trolling. Are all lolicons this retarded?     That's a cougar, dumbass.    She is a loli, loli is a body type. She's a loli milf.     The best.     Hahahahahahaha   NO       She's old enough to have high school daughter.    Fuck off, retard.      tfw like MILFs and NTR  Literally the best combination      It doesn't matter idiot people just associate milf with older woman of course its based on age as much as apearance.  And I'm sorry but a mom with the same face as her underage daughter, that doesn't hold any credibility.      Stay angry and stupid, it suits you.   I can't help but feel that this thread is filled with crossboarders.      /a/ people only browse /a/   Get original anon crossboarder is barely a meme it doesn't mean anything     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127207446  Oh sweet! I just got promoted!     tfw /a/ won't stop shitting up threads on other boards and then hide behind "4chan is for anime" excuse when called out       I Smell NTR   implying wives don't give their husbands erotic pictures of them when they go on long business trips   It's like you don't even have a wife waifu.       Damnit /a/, I just fapped last week.   The overlap between interests is huge on 4chan. The population liking anime has always been large, and half the boards here existed specifically to keep off-topic shit out of /a/ and other Japanese related boards.  It's not /a/ shitting up anything, the same way it's not /pol/ ruining threads with politics. This is 4chan. Anime gets posted. On the other hand, people will argue about politics anywhere, anytime. It's not /pol/. Of course, posting /a/ or /pol/ or /v/ or /etc/ specific memes in a board is off topic shitposting, but that's a different issue.      I can't even understand what you're trying to say. Please use some punctuation.    I love that one. "This board is for us so leave" when all they do is post moe garbage.    Okay lets settle it   Takasugi Kou Kai Hiroyuki Hidemaru Fue Shunjou Shuusuke Toguchi Masaya Tatsunami Youtoku Chiba Toushirou  Who draws them better? Throw in anyone else you feel qualifies.              It's not easy on phone keyboard. I'm sure you can work your brain enough to read it good.    Would you a tanned milf on the beach?   Because they're shit. Now fuck off.    Takasugi Kou is obviously the best but lately he has become boring, huge sameface syndrome and doesn't draw anything thats really interesting.    Get load of this faggot.  Akiko is GOAT milf. Deal with it      reddit char  Fuck off, crossie      Only if she fell asleep afterwards naked with my cum on her back and butt and it prevented those areas from getting tanned.     No This  is a milf     Fue is the king of the blowjob and he just posted this on his pixiv for next months Comic MILF.    Would I what? Lick her armpits? Yes.    List is missing some Asagi Ryu.  His older women are pretty great.      Someone please explain to me something. Any poll of this kind on internet gets topped by the pedos.  How?        sleeves slightly too long   clutching dress   That is 2cute!       You must be kidding if you think this kind of art is better than any of the quoted artists.    Proxy      Nice job outing yourself. That's from the 2014 /a/ census.    Never said he was the best.  Just saw his name and remembered he posted that.     Please lolis do not post babyfaced milfs they are a fraud made for lolicons as you. Don't delude yourself thinking its about context or being a mom.  Thank you        stop posting my waifu pls    I would carry her books if you know what I mean.    But milfs are both qt and hot.    aha...orihime is the most saggy MILF tits i had saw...still get me boner though     Trying to carry 16 books at once without them being in a box or some binding    Why?      You mean, you would help her carrying those books?     tomboys and onee-sans in the top three  almost good taste almost      Babyfaced. Not a milf/christmas cake.     I already hate this meme.    Exactly.    Nice...ellipsis..................fa<wbr>ggot.</wbr>    It's not a meme. How are you going to call this a milf?     Will you shut up and just let people enjoy these pics already, or you want to be a dick that bad?     tfw no cute fox grandma   who fucking shits everywhere and eats it with you and has a fucking giant cock     Just fuck off already, faggot    Someone get this hothead a bowl of eggs and gently walk him home tbh    Very easily. Animu isn't like your 3DPD. Our girls stay smooth forever.    But I do.    I'm not that anon but I get his point    That's funny Nigga, you meant to use this pic instead.  Loyal   Pure Heart   Honest   Kind   True Love from day one  I only wish we can all be so lucky           Not liking Milfs and Cheating and disliking NTR      Ok.     Men are naturally wired to be attracted to younger girls due to their increased fertility. Old hag lovers are an anomaly and most likely one of the products of feminist brainwashing.    My nigga, my nigga.       The literal definition means nothing   If it doesn't match what I perceive it to be, it's wrong       scat      Radiohead  pls no     All this bitching   Just post milfs/ara ara guys      No Mitarashi Kousei  Come on, man.     youtube comments are that way     fucking shits everywhere   wat       ara ara guys  Gross.      Are you saying you wouldn't entertain this lovely woman? All she wants is to be with her grandson  and fuck the ever loving god damn shit out of him with her GIANT COCK      You forgot the shit golem that orgasms shit into her womb.    Just ignore these faggots, they clearly don't appreciate milfs.    Her design turned me on but Radioheads craziness ruins it for me every single time.    If you want an image dump then fuck off to /e/ or /h/   So what anime have older women winning?  Onee-chans = Christmas Cakes &gt; Milfs  Opinions are facts     How about normal discussion instead of bitching? Not him but he is absolutly right, good threads are ruined by idiots like you.     I used to like milfs more than lolis since i could self insert better, now that i'm no longer the young dude hungry milfs want i just lust for lolis.      married mother starts cheating on husband with young neighbor   husband is later revealed to be cheating on her with loli like college girl      What if your Onne-chan is your mother?    High five my father.    Looks like his mom?    How does that work.    This is normal discussion you retard.    Are we thinking about the same doujin?    What age is too old?    What you post can be considered milf. This cannot   <br/>       When they start looking like Cologne from Ranma 1/2     take a perfectly good character design   ruin it by attaching ridiculous balloon tits      Nice body, disgusting face    When they have wrinkles and saggy tits.    Love them.   http://exhentai.org/g/653175/cf1cce<wbr>770d/  One of my favorites and one of the few that actually has her look her age.  </wbr>      Fuck off    You know that there something in-between the segments? You don't have to go from an extreme to another. Lolicons is for pedophiles.     That's a gilf baby.    They just look bigger because of the shota tit stand.    twin milf i pressume     Shota Tit Stand  What's it's abilty?     It can make tits appear bigger than they are.    CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<wbr>UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<wbr>UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<wbr>UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<wbr>UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>    I want to lick the sweat of her ass.    Is she giving birth?      Right age for what?    That's not possible.    For dying of natural causes .    Ah that's the word i was looking for. Now if only there was more of it around.      Are those balls?    Hard anal sex.   The new LN releases today. Let's all wait warmly for it while discussing cute yuushas     They also fixed Sonoko's legs on episode 8.     I was waiting for Asenshi (?) to sub this, but apparently Mawaru got there first with FFF scripts. That good enough?    That's a bit less brutal.     I have no idea. I'm watching the raws.       Yougloriousmotherfucker    A demoralised Kumiko is fine too.  How are people supposed to see anime as art when KyoAni keeps making stuff like this?  I love Gotou.   That crushing feeling when you can't get good, no matter how hard you try.    Have you been working on those lip slurs anon?   SO UGLY.   EVEN Hazuki and Natsuki was amazed at how shit Kumiko was playing, and they didn't even make the cut.   Why don't they just fuck already?   Maybe they don't know how.   I just can't take this character seriously. I want to laugh whenever I see her dumb face on the screen. She's just so adorably autistic.     2special4u?   shh, Kumiko is sleeping   I want to put her in a room filled with LEGO bricks and watch her play with them all day long.    Because in Japan girls are gay in High School up until they find the D that they want then they endlessly pursue that D. If they fail they're doomed to Christmas Cake status.  Girls aren't allowed to switch D pursuit unless the new D is above and beyond all expectations in the ultimate shape of masculinity.  You now understand why Harems are such fierce competitions.        Why must you respond to shitposters?     girls only allowed to change Ds if new D is greater   thus harems are competitive  Surely it can't be that hard to find something superior to the faggots who typically find themselves leading harems?       Robert fripp did it, you can do it too.    I want to drink her blood.   You would think that, however density also starts with D and dense D also sounds like density which means the harem lead is the ultimate D.  Plus all the superior Ds are too busy trying to fight for koshien.      What are you talking about, anon? Just look at her.    I want to fuck her sister.   Like pie in the sky    I want to fuck all the Hibikes at the same time.  How would socially awkward attempt to court Taki?   peace-chan has a name    I sort of miss those days. Things were so much simpler then.     That's basically the main reason why I want season 2. I want to see her try to act flirty around him.     Invite him on a quick trumpet walk up Mt. Fuji  iykwim .    She should go after him with a bottle of water offering it to him because it's hot. Taki thanks her and Reina dies.    I-I don't anon.   I don't know. I think she would just try to talk to him a little while and then tell him that she loves him if he's enjoying the conversation or smiles.  That or  she would mount him and demand that she start touching him, even though she would probably grab one of his hands and put it on her breast.           The same way how Kumiko approached Taki-sensei this episode. Leave her cellphone intentionally, they go to the room where she left it and then she rapes him there.      H-here, drink this sensei   Oh? You're giving me water?   It's because you look h-hot.  She then leaves blushing furiously and amazed at herself for being so bold.       So that's why Reina wanted Kumiko to tell her what happened.  Sasuga Reina.     Do you think Reina runs a blog or since she's so super special and different from all the other girls her age she has a traditional, physical diary where she writes about her interactions with Taki-Sensei?     I did it Kumiko, I told Taki I thought he looked hot      She would drug his drink, wait for it to kick in and rape him. A few months layer Reina sends him a positive pregnancy test result and attached to it is picture of her grinding his dick.     Reina shitposts about her crush on /r9k/    get on my level bitch.      Reina?  More like REEEEEEEEEEEEina, amirite fellas?      Reina is a pussy that pretends to be hardcore around other people. She would probably faint if Taki-Sensei even touched her.      She's also an M, I don't see her raping anyone.    She's M and S.  She reminds me of me.      Holly fuck a 'proper' nosebleed sacre bleu!     Kousaka-san, you'll be playing the solo. Not Nakaseko-san. You'll play. Got it?   Y-YOU TOO!      She's probably only an M because she found Taki's laptop open one day, and learned, among other things, that Taki hasn't mastered private browsing.      Now its time to disscuss medecine.what was the cause of Kumiko's nosebleed? Stress? Dry air? Obscure disease?       What does Taki does on his computer? Jacking off to professional orchestra music?     He watches that one amateur porn video he made with his wife over and over again. Then cries at the end.     It was not dry air. Kyoto is like the fucking Amazon in summer.    We went over this. The only causes for nosebleeds in anime are punches to the face or indecent thoughts. And I'm pretty sure Kumiko wasn't punched off-screen.      Implying they had time to do that  Taki married and his wife died like the week after what a fucking loser      Dehydration      10 orchestra hacks that will change your life   What this 10 year old trumpet prodigy does next will blow your mind   Depression help       Yuuko plz   Well whadda you know.  Screens are up, fuckers.     It's Key AIDS. Kumiko will be hospitalized right before the competition and Reina will completely fuck up her solo because she's worried about Kumiko. Reina will become a pariah, reviled by the band while looked on by Taki with only a gaze of deep disappointment while Kumiko becomes sicker and sicker. Kumiko will eventually die and Reina will try to throw herself off the school roof before being stopped by  Shuichi  who will  confess his love to her.    why the fuck did I write this       This shits going around.    Like seriously.    Holy shit the ponytail is back.    Ponytails everywhere.    Ponytail is back. Nice.    3 ADs  It's over KyoAni is finished.    JUSTICE    Kumiko must be sweating in that uniform she hates summer after all.      ponytails are back      last episode not called "Hibike! Euphonium"  I'm ready for you, second season.    Didn't Tamako's last episode have even more ADs?   Leave it to Kyoani to have us waiting until the end. The promo image didn't lie, Kumiko has the hairband around her wrist.   Nope, only one.    BUCHOU!    Look at her fucking uniform!  these illustrations will most likely become drama cds, as it happened with free!      Are the winter uniforms their performance uniforms? Only the slackers seem to be wearing their summer get up.       Ponytails vs. Ribbons: which is better?        !       Is it not possible that this scene is before or after their performance?    I think its for the more formal look.  コンクールの舞台で演奏できる時間は“たった”12分間。 それは一瞬のようで、でも永遠のようで……。 吹奏楽部員たちはその12分のために青春のすべてをかけて練習してきた。 北宇治高校吹奏楽部の演奏が始まる。         I'm pretty sure there have been some relatively recent KyoAni episodes with a couple of ADs, I just can't remember which shows did it. Still, I don't expect any more than 16 key animators for the finale.  It's pretty funny just how little staff is required per episode in KyoAni shows compared to other productions.     Are they really going to focus on music?  Hold old is Taki anyway?   Dehydration, which is why she was given water.    Ponytail is back, fick ja!          Taki in formal attire  How wet will Reina be?     Taki is 34. You should know this by now, Anonymous.     return of the ponytail   return of the winter uniform  It's the obligatory fan service episode.      There have been rare eps with two ADs but three is quite unusual for Kyoani.    I'll ask my friend. I'm pretty sure he can see the future.    Wiki says 34, although it varied from 32-34 before. I'd like novelanons to confirm ;-;    Brilliant.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kEl<wbr>5RvbGdik</wbr>  [ ]       Asuka ponytail  I still have mixed feelings about her but now I'm definitely aroused.      the description of the scene is that they fell asleep during practice. And the entire page is dedicated to the duet episode. It's probably one of those "it happened but we didn't show it" artworks. Kumiko has the hairband because she always puts up her hair for concerts, and they were practicing in the concert hall.       Well, it is the closing of three consecutive productions for KyoAni. With this many ADs on board here's hoping for a really well-animated performance. It would be great to have back-to-back episodes with cool animation highlights.     1434178590484.jpg  I really love the uniform designs in this show. The color palettes are very cute. I also like the little number in the back. Nice touch.     Who is she again?    Episode 13 "Goodbye, Competition" The amount of time to play in the concert is just twelve minutes. It seems like it will be over in an instant, but it seems like it will last an eternity... For the sake of those twelve minutes, the concert band members have stakes the springtime of their youth. Kitauji High School Concert Band's performance begins now.       I-I fucking love taki.    We know Riko, we know.    None of that says it can't be an actual scene. Do you not want it to be an actual scene?   Who are the staff for the last episode?   Reina please contain yourself    Go back to your trumpet solo.     Still, I don't expect any more than 16 key animators for the finale.  3 animators teams. 1 from Do, 2 from KyoAni. They might reach 20 KAs this time.  Too bad, their best animators already worked on episode 10-12 so they probably won't be in the finale.          start the show with ponytails   end the show with ponytails   There must be some deep symbolism in this, I can't figure it out though.       Who are KyoAni's best animators these days? Is Kigami still relevant as a key animator?    they had like 9 KA on the last episode, do they even need 20?   There's lots of instruments and tiny details this episode.   They sure do if they're going all-out on depicting the performance.    of course he's still relevant, he did episodes 5 and 11    But no tiny hats.     Plus all the superior Ds are too busy trying to fight for koshien.   I chuckled a bit, but it's true best boys can be found in the sausagefest that are baseball mangas.      5 and 12*    Direction: Kawanami  SB: Yamada AD: Sezaki, Akitake, Hikiyama      Huh, no Ishidate. He's normally the finale guy.    Their best or most experienced that aren't AD or ED - Tatsuya Satou - Shinpei Sawa - Hiroshi Karata - Kunihiro Hane - Yoshinori Urata - Mariko Takahashi - Kouhei Nakahara Kigami actually worked solely on key animation for like a year before Hibike.            Do we know which staff members haven't been very active lately? IIRC Ogawa and Utsumi have been pretty quiet so maybe they are doing some new project.     normally  Outside of his own show and Chuu2? Not really.     he's 34, although I forgot where they mention his age     although I forgot where they mention his age  Pretty much when he first appears.     there's no way Utsumi isn't doing animation for the Free movie. She's just directing anything for it.    just not*   Even Natsuki was embarrassed.   Holy shit, Kumiko sucked.    BD/DVD vol.2&amp;vol.3 also added event ticket.  http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/650<wbr>45</wbr>     Its over. KyoAni on bankruptcy watch.      3 event tickets  We jew now     She's not in a position to judge.  She didn't even make the audition.       I think the both of you may be misinterpreting that scene.     I hope she's working under Takemoto's supervision. Her talent shines through the most when she's led by someone else. Same with Ishidate.    more like time to announce a s2    Do they have enough event tickets?    better add more tickets just in case    tfw Aoi won't be at the concert   Yes. That position, yes.    ■感謝イベント　京都でお祭りフェスティバル ～南座へようこそ～ 概要    日程：2015年10月31日(土)   時間：17:00開場／17:30開演   会場：京都四條 南座 (京都市東山区四条大橋東詰)   The same day as KyoAniDo event. It's in Kyoto too.            tfw I don't give two fucks about a random non-character with a subpar design      same day as KyoAniDo event  Isn't that counterproductive?    live action  Is the next episode the last?   There's an OVA in December.     Beach episode confirmed     Too many guys    So we don't end with them playing in the competition?    What? Sauce?    7 volumes, 2 episodes each. That means episode 13 + OVA is in the last volume.    http://anime-eupho.com/product/  続巻発売日情報   第4巻：2015年9月16日（水）  第5巻：2015年10月21日（水）  第6巻：2015年11月18日（水）  第7巻：2015年12月16日（水）  Volume 7 of BDs goes on sale on December 16th. Every BD volume contains two episodes and a short special. Anime TV series only has 13 episodes.  It's the same thing that happened with Amagi Brilliant Park. TV series had 13 episodes, OVA came out with the seventh BD volume.                They announce S2 on Tuesday, right?  I want to fuck Kumiko, hard.   Taki tapped that right?    KyoAni has been consistently doing this format for their TV shows since Chuu2Ren.       Asuka stoic as fuck whilst everyone else is has varying degrees of damn when Kumiko got told.   Now that I think about it, they didn't focus on Shuu's reaction, did they.    Right, because she can't feel empathy.      That reminds me of Haruhi.    god, are japanese ugly without photoshop and centimeters of make up  Centuries of imbreeding do that to you. Almost as bad as English.       That little river play was cute, a push for each other to get good.   Get good, Kumiko.    Must be a communist.        <br/>    Asuka reads it for the first time and plays it flawlessly. Kumiko, who has been playing euphonium for seven years, struggles even after practicing for an entire week.       If you look at the music for the piece she played for her middle school competition, it's not that hard in comparison. The degree of difficulty is just this much higher than what she's used to.  Asuka's just special.    Will Shoe1 win the Kumikobowl?     Maybe on the new AniDO project? They have something to announce next month.     Why do most japanese in highschool look ugly? Is it because of inbreeding?     If they make two more seasons, or a two cour second season, then yes. If they end it with this season, nope. It's an adaptation of a novel, and in the novel he only wins the k-bowl at the end of the third volume.      He's already out of the running.    He's the only one in the running. It might take him a year but he'll get to the finish line eventually.      He's the only one in the running.  That's what you think.     Piss off Kumiko     tfw you will never go to a Hibike event     WAKE UP BITCH    Please don't suck so much donkey dick and PUT THE FUCKING BLANKETS.    Would be weird if AniDo announced the new show and not Kyoani. Even Free's announcement was all under Kyoani's name.     Not Kigami Not Ishidate  3 ADs....  I can't say they're cutting corners but I'm kinda disappointed.             Violin-chan is a cutie.      Is Aoi daijobu?  I hope she gets into a uni and STEM subject of her choice.     I never understood the obsession to study for college during your final high school year.    That's the feeling that indicates that you're not trying hard enough.    Entrance exams. You can't go to college if you don't pass them.    Are entrance exams in japan really that hard? To dedicate an entire year just for that seems a bit odd.   Why isn't Reina in any special classes? Is that normal in Japan? Here in America, autistic children have their owns classes. And when they take standard classes with normal students, they have a chaperon with them at all times.  You will never date Reina and then go out with other girls to make her jealous. ;_;   It's the only way to get into university, and the choices of universities you can get into is determined by your score.   It can also mean the difference between a life long white collar job or whatnot.        It depends on the college you want to get into but yes, students are very stressed out during this time because their future depends on it. In Japan it's hard to get in to college but easy to graduate, but in America it's relatively easy to get into college but more difficult to graduate.    It's better to make them socialize with normal people instead of treating them like special snowflakes or giving them Ritalin like in ameriland.    They are the most important exams you will take in your educational career as the university you go to will depend on your results, and that has more influence on your future job prospects than how you actually get on at university.    They are announcing something next month and many people are not working on anything for a long time. It makes sense for them to start acting independently.     To dedicate an entire year just for that seems a bit odd  It's not odd at all in an Asian country. An entire year is nothing when everyone else starts preparing for the exam since their first year of highschool.      I have faith in the Yamada. Hopefully they don't dissapoint with the finale like they did on Ep 11.       inb4 it's just another seasonal staff illustration thing        It just seems kind of odd to base what university you go to on one exam, rather than your overall academic performance.    I think they'll give a solid hint that Kumiko likes Shuichi otherwise they would never should have bothered with the whole Kumiko doesnt know about her feelings sub-plot.  What's Kumiko feeling here?  Abject despair that she'll never reach Reina's skill level?       I can only assume she is aiming for a very hard or unusual career or something, otherwise sperging out just because you want to get into liberal arts, marketing or nursery would be kind of stupid, any diploma from any college could pretty much do the job. I used to think that without a degree from a top tier university you'd be pretty much unemployed for life but it isn't really that important for most 'normal' jobs.      The kind of university you graduate from matters more in Japan. People and employers might look down on you if you're from a third-rate school. Even in the dating world they look at where you graduated from as a way of picking a mate. Probably because better school = better job = payed better = security.   In Aoi's case she'd already failed to get into the high school she wanted so she's already stressed out about veering off the path she wanted. I don't know if it will ever be mentioned what career she's going for but it must be something she really wants.      Do lacks a digital department, they can't be independent.      That doesn't matter, Do can't be independent because they're not a separate entity, they're a subsidiary owned entirely by KyoAni. Pretty much a KyoAni studio in Osaka with a fancy name.     Where is that pic of red rinnon blowing the paper? She has the guts to be in a position of authority.   red ribbon*    What the fuck is wrong with the Japanese male hair styles.    They have shit hair genetics that don't really allow them to have more than 3 styles.    I don't think it's going to be anything too overt. Maybe hints of them reconciling, but no strong romantic hints. Romance hasn't really been an important part of this show, so to make a big revelation of Kumiko realizing her love for Shuichi would feel out of place.  But I also don't think we're going to get any pathetic, cheap yuribait like episode 11 scene either. Yamada is doing the storyboard for this episode, and based on her previous work I doubt she'd stoop that low.     I finally understand the context of this picture.  Reina is murdering Kumiko.     Someone needs to shop Ufo-kun and a shadow of Reina with a knife.     No, I expect a solid one. They've been lacking really because they had to go crazy with the yuri bait.     Where is that image even from? Is it just fan art or an official one?     I finally understand  No anon, you don't.     That teacher hhhnnng    It was one of the very first pieces of official art, and its purpuse obviously was to bait otaku into that nifty new Kyoani show since that artwork looks like POV shot of somebody about to rape Kumiko. If there's one thing all otaku love, it's fat faceless men raping virginal highschool girls.    You're right. They should stop making art so people can see anime as art.    Her ankles though    The Euphonium player is kinda cute.     most highschoolers are ugly  Holy shit anon you are onto something.      anime with so little confidence in its story it has to resort to school girls almost humping each other for the viewers' titillation   art      Can't blame them after hearing best girl Asuka play that part. Asuka raised the bar too high for Kumiko.    The concert scene is one thing they could animate in advance, you know?    I'm still mad about this.  Hibike! Euphonium could have been Kyoani's magnum opus, the first work since Hyouka to surpass it.  But they had to completely shit on it and ruin it just because that faggot Hanada can't go five minutes without an obnoxious yuribait fanservice scene.        Anime is a mistake.     virginal  I don't wanna know how often her cactus was slimy.      mfw he's working with Kyoani again for their next show     When will Kyoani fire that faggot already? All of the Kyoani shows he wrote the script for flopped.     mfw     You're overreacting     He's right. People focus more on the shipfaggotry rather than the story.      Maybe on this shitty board.     I don't go to under anime related websites, but I was under the impression that shipfaggotry is even more insufferable on most of them, and that the conversations almost exclusively revolve around it. Is that not the case?    This shit is everywhere, the only thing that differs is the tone of the debate.   You can travel back in time to the day before the first episode aired.  What would you tell yourself about the show?      Stop kidding yourself. It's every discussion forum.     Cheer for Natsuki and Haruka, it would be a good investment. Avoid Asuka.     It'll never get S2.     Even though I know it won't happen, I'd probably have more respect for the show if it actually went all the way and made Kumiko/Reina canon in the end. At least then there'd be a point to all the yuribaiting.    Avoid all threads on /a/ (or anywhere else for that matter) after episode 8 like the plague.    What does that have to do with the quality of the actual show?  I'm not sure what you would like the Kumiko x Reina scenes to be replaced with either. I know we would all like more music, but without the Kumiko x Reina scenes where would Kumiko's character development come from? Shuuichi?      Not him but the blatant yuribait scenes did feel really out of place in the show and since it'll lead nowhere it was simply pointless to add it in the first place.    Horiguchi is nowhere to be seen    Horiguchi left Kyoani.    If Reina is supposed to be awkward around people then have her be awkward not price charming. Less yuribait more freindship that actually help Kumiko and Reina develop.    Yeah, same. I don't have a problem with the yuri part, I have a problem with the bait part. If they decided to make a yuri romance, fair enough, that also could have made it a great show. But this bait is just pathetic.   Having Kumiko and Reina scenes isn't the problem, having them be so obnoxiously pandering and out of place compared to the rest of the show is the problem. It's like watching two completely different shows when you compare those scenes to all the other scenes. They could have portrayed their relationship as an intense, emotional relationship without resorting to trying to make them look as gay as possible.        since it'll lead nowhere  Why are you caring more about what those scenes may mean in the future instead of caring about what they meant in the actual moment?  Who cares about where they'll "lead. It's a matter of what those scenes were doing.       She took a break from animating and illustrates full-time now.     It's a matter of what those scenes were doing.  And what those scenes were doing is making them look like gay lovers, which is cheap and irritating when everyone knows they're both supposed to be straight.      It's a matter of what those scenes were doing.   But that's the fucking point. What they're doing is provide pointless fanservice to give yurifags something to wank over. That certainly does not enhance the show's quality and just invites the endless shipperfaggotry we got.       Sauce? I've heard this before but with no real source.      Having Kumiko and Reina scenes isn't the problem, having them be so obnoxiously pandering and out of place compared to the rest of the show is the problem.  These two statements are rather contradictory. It's not that you didn't like them. It's just that you found them unlikeable.     The problem in those scenes are the fact that they stick out like a sore thumb from the rest of the show in a bad way. KyoAni are perfectly capable of portraying intense platonic friendship and yet they went with making Kumiko and Reina look as gay as possible.     Why are you caring more about what those scenes may mean in the future instead of caring about what they meant in the actual moment?  But that's just the thing. Even without knowing what happens in episode 13, we can already consider them meaningless based on all the other episodes.  Episode 8 made them look like lovers. Then episode 9 happened, where they were portrayed as just friends. Then episode 10 happened, where they were portrayed as just friends and we learned Reina loves Taki-Sensei. Then episode 11 happened, and it made them look like lovers again. Then episode 12 happened, where they were portrayed as just friends, and they made it obvious once again that Reina loves Taki-Sensei.  It's schizophrenic.        Would you have the audacity to practice trombone or any musical instrument at your local river/creek?   What he's saying is that he doesn't like the way their scenes were handled. KyoAni's writing them as lovers when they're supposed to be friends.     And what those scenes were doing is making them look like gay lovers  Who the fuck cares. Why does this bother you.  What important is why the scene is there in the first place.   You know what, fuck it, I'm tired of speaking in the abstract. If you're referring to the scene from episode 11, then just say it. I can understand how someone can say that that scene at least made them seem like "gay lovers", but I don't know what other scenes you're accusing of seeming out of place.       AniDo announces a BL eroge adaptation under their own name You heard it here first    http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/644<wbr>86</wbr>    Not at night    What's her name?    Peace-chan     Why does this bother you.  Because it's cheap. It's like the staff held a meeting and said "yeah, we know they're both straight girls and they end up with dudes in the end, but fuck it, let's bait the yurifags as hard as we can so we can make more shekels."     Yoshigawa Akiko?  You really can't read hiragana?      Seems like you just have a narrower view of what is acceptable behaviour for two straight girls than I do.   I mean Yoshizawa.        KyoAni is the pure responsible older sister that doesn't prostitute its characters   AniDo is their rebellious contrarian little sister and goes owl out with the fanservice       Why does this bother you.  See  Their portrayal is all over the place. That's not good storytelling.       Episode 8 made them look like lovers.   No it didn't. It really didn't. What the fuck does it mean to you to "look like lovers".  Then episode 9 happened, where they were portrayed as just friends.  Reina hardly showed up in 9, but she was just as close with Kumiko as she was in the previous ep.  Then episode 10 happened, and we learned Reina loves Taki-Sensei.   Something that's been obvious since episodes 4 and 5.   You keep talking about things going back and forth, but nothing about their relationship seems different after they became close in episode 8. The only thing that changes is the amount of scenes they have together, and whether or not one of those scenes happens to be an emotional one. An emotional scene, mind you, that makes perfect sense within the story.  If two characters for some reason hug in one episode and don't in the next, are you going to assume then as well that the story is being schizophrenic?            I think there's some misunderstanding going on here.  It's not that I hated those scenes, it's that I hated how out of place with the rest of the show they were. See:  If they made them a couple, and made them be madly in love with each other, fair enough. But that's not what they did. If you're going to just imply yuri with subtext, then do it far more lightly. When you make it this grandiose, you really should deliver on it.         I appreciate that the anime gave focus to Reina, Kumiko wasnt supposed to interact with her much until ep 8, but the blatant yuri bait was obnoxious.     Episode 12 had the best portrayal. They were close good friends but it stayed within the boundary of friendship.     &gt;KyoAni is the pure responsible older sister that doesn't prostitute its characters  I-I was actually making a joke about KyoAni KEY adaptations.     They go to a hill at night and play a duet together titled The Place Where We Found Love and you seriously claim Kyoani didn't make it look romantic? Not to forget that unnecessary yuribait with the lip touching.     You really can't read hiragana?  Yeah I cant, thanks.     If you didn't read the novel spoilers it wouldn't of been obvious.     KEY   eroge  W-what.       It's like the staff held a meeting and said "yeah, we know they're both straight girls and they end up with dudes in the end, but fuck it, let's bait the yurifags as hard as we can so we can make more shekels."  You see, this is the problem. Imagine you didn't know anything about the original novel. Would the scenes bother you this much then? Just enjoy the story for what it is.       No it didn't. It really didn't.  Really?      wouldn't of  Just where is this shit coming from.     AIR and Kanon have 18+ versions with H.    You somehow fail to understand that those cheap yuribait scenes look out of place in the show.    How can you say that with a straight face one day after the ABP Ova? They literally whored everyone in that show.     Even if he didn't read the spoilers the next episode literally negates episode 8. At that point you'd be wondering if it was all bait all along.      Imagine you didn't know anything about the original novel. Would the scenes bother you this much then?  If I didn't know anything about the original novel I'd be expecting the two bitches to end up together in the last episode.      No it didn't. It really didn't. What the fuck does it mean to you to "look like lovers".  Obviously, with all the meta knowledge from the novel spoilers, the "confession of love" line from the novels, etc. we know that those scenes are meant to show them just as close friends who share an emotional bond, that Kumiko is captivated by Reina's presence and that Reina has no understanding of the concept of personal space.  But if we were taking the show at just face value, looking at the episode 8 scene, it's clear that they intentionally made it look as romantic as possible to make people question whether they romantically love each other.  It's easy to interpret all these scenes correctly when taken into context and with all the additional knowledge we have due to novel spoilers and the like. But someone who is just watching the show, not participating in any discussion, not knowing about the spoilers, they would have a completely different interpretation, and this is something Kyoani has done intentionally just to mess with their viewers.          If you didn't read the novel spoilers it wouldn't of been obvious.  No, Anon. It really was obvious. Why the fuck would she go out of her way in ep 4 when someone spoke ill of Taki? Why did she notice him before everyone else in ep 2? Why did her eyes sparkle when she said his name in ep 5?  Sure you can make the argument that she highly respected him, but even if you knew nothing of the novels, when you heard her confess that she loved him in ep 10, it's obvious that should make sense to you.  Also,  wouldn't of          I dropped Amagi after 3 episodes so I wouldn't know. But somehow I'm not surprised since it seemed like a souless quick cashgrab with all the fanservice.    subs when   There was no indication of romance prior to episode 8. Kumiko just wanted to reconcile with Reina.    mfw that will never happen     IRC literally took over the place   Is this what a normal friendship between two girls looks like?   That doesn't make them look like lovers you tap dancing autist. Looking like lovers involves /two people/. If anything, that just makes Reina look like a sexual predator. Reina alone, mind you.     No, but Reina stating he wants Taki-sensei's D in the previous episode you'd think it's just blatant yuri pandering.     It's a OVA, you fucking retard, stop saying bullshit.    Dropping the best show on its season last year.  There you go shit taste.         It makes Reina look highly sexual aggressive, but since Kumiko is not negatively reacting to it, it makes her look like she doesn't mind it.    What are you on about? This is pretty much the most calm and civilized discussion about yuri in these threads that we have had for over a month.     But if we were taking the show at just face value, looking at the episode 8 scene, it's clear that they intentionally made it look as romantic as possible to make people question whether they romantically love each other.  Or maybe it was meant to be a romantic scene despite their lack of actual gayness. I agree that Kyoani enhanced their scenes together to enhance their gayness, but I don't think they went too far.   They aren't meant to ｈａｖｅ　ａ　ｎｏｒｍａｌ　ｆｒｉｅｎｄｓｈｉｐ． That's pretty much half the show, that they aren't just regular friends.   Sexual? Really?            goalpost moving  The point was that their mountain scenes were intentionally made to look romantic.   If you're denying that there's any yuribaiting, then saying that Reina "looks like a sexual predator" contradicts that as well.        it was meant to be a romantic scene despite their lack of actual gayness.  That's exactly what people are so annoyed about, dude.     It's called Class S you uneducated pleb.      I agree that Kyoani enhanced their scenes together to enhance their gayness, but I don't think they went too far.   But they did. They also downplayed Kumiko's attraction to Shuichi to make the yuri credible. They went too far obviously.        it seemed like a souless quick cashgrab  They actually just did it as favour for an old friend. Shoji Gatoh is pals with some KyoAni higher-ups. I highly doubt they would've taken a Kadokawa project on otherwise.      &gt;goalpost moving  I don't think you understand what that means.  The point was that their mountain scenes were intentionally made to look romantic.   And?  If you're denying that there's any yuribaiting, then saying that Reina "looks like a sexual predator" contradicts that as well.  I have been, from the beginning, denying that any of these scenes are out of place and detrimental to the quality of the show.         Intentionally forcing romantic scenes between two characters who are not romantically in love with each other is detrimental to the quality of the show because it is misleading, cheap, bad writing for the sole purpose of baiting yurifags.    But why? It's like you've decided that they can't have this kind of relationship because they aren't actually gay, but isn't the whole point of their scenes to show that they don't have a normal friendship? That this kind of thing is just the way they are? Yes, Kyoani played it up a bit, or a lot, but it's not like they took a friendship that was similar to Kumiko and Hazuki's and propelled it to what they have now, it was already pretty far along this path in the novels. I think you would still be calling this yuribait or whatever else even if they had kept 100% to the novels.    Do you feel betrayed?    That scene in the novel, feels less gay. Sure Kumiko thinks about the physical aspect of it a lot, but it seemed more friendly compare to KyoAni. It wasn't meant to look romantic in the novels. Cause Kumiko was more concern about Shuuichi and Reina acted straight.     It makes Reina look highly sexual aggressive, but since Kumiko is not negatively reacting to it, it makes her look like she doesn't mind it.  She's not reacting positively, either. She's in fact not reacting at all. It's almost entirely Reina's game. But regardless, if I were to play devil's advocate to uphold your point, then yes, maybe it could look like they have crushes on each other, but really, the entire show up to that point had kind of been doing the same thing.      I'm not a yurifag, so no.     I think you would still be calling this yuribait or whatever else even if they had kept 100% to the novels.  Not that guy, and I haven't read the novels. But from what I heard from the people who supposedly read the novels, Shuichi plays a much more prominent role in Kumiko's train of thoughts in the novels, and her interest in him is far more obvious.  So even with all the "yuribait" scenes in the novels, you are constantly aware that she likes Shuichi, so the scenes themselves come off as far less romantic.  Kyoani intentionally downplayed Shuichi in the anime and made Kumiko's attraction to him a lot less obvious. This, coupled with even more "yuribait" than there was in the novels, made those scenes gives a pretty different impression than they did in the novels.        Why does Reina have no friends prior to Kumiko? Why does she strive to be special?   She's an autistic chuuni with a superiority complex.     Why does she strive to be special?  for Taki     Amagi was fucking shit and if you seriously thought it was best anything your taste is beyond help.    No one else is special enough to be friends with her. Except Asuka, but she's a bit too special.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127203869   Kyoani did a good job damaging the anime. This will series will mostly be remembered as that obnoxious yuri pandering BS that went nowhere.     Pretty much this.     We never did see Asuka interact with Reina. I wonder what it would be like.     Asuka knows Reina is fucking crazy and probably avoids her as much as she can.  Sociopaths are great judges of human character.       between two characters who are not romantically in love  Heh. But that aside, you can interpret the end of episode 8 as being romantic, sure. But really, you don't have to. There wasn't much terribly romantic about it.      If they also followed the novel, then Kumiko would also be walking with Shuuichi home. In novel she never walked with Hazuki and Midori. Hazuki walked with her other friends and Midori had cram school. Kumiko either walked alone or with Shuuichi.     not made to look romantic   The Place Where We Found Love   confession of love   not made to look romantic       <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127204171   Fuck that, I don't want to sacrifice the quality of the show just to make yurifags mad.      There wasn't much terribly romantic about it.  Compared to their scene in episode 11, I guess episode 8 does look less romantic.     The confession of love line was in the book as well. And as the previous Anon said, not really romantic. It's simply an easily misinterpreted phrase. As for the name of the song, maybe the staff just likes that particular Hanako Oku song.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127204251  and the keks too      maybe the staff just likes that particular Hanako Oku song.   Or maybe they just like to bait faggots.        It's simply an easily misinterpreted phrase.  That's the crux of the argument. Kyoani intentionally made it so all these scenes can be easily misinterpreted.       There wasn't much terribly romantic about it.  Then how come a million yurifags flooded the threads, declared "hetfags" to be "BTFO" and started speculating about an anime original lesbian endgame?    Who invited the shitposters?  Judging by the conversations that have been dominating these threads for the past couple of days, is it safe to assume that virtually no one here still believes in a yuri end?  I'd post a strawpoll but I doubt it would take the proxy dude long to get to it.     Me. I'm sorry.     Everything about their relationship can be easily misinterpreted, so KyoAni kicked the pandering into overdrive to make sure yurifags got baited while simultaneously keeping hetfags on board.  Too bad it backfired and the show is selling pretty poorly for KyoAni.       You'll always still find those rare delusional faggots who still believe in yuri end.     Because like I said, you CAN interpret it as romantic. You don't have to, but you can.   It's possible it was intentional. We can never know.   But by the way, yuri subtext only becomes bait when things end het. For all we know, KyoAni could end the story at the next episode with no indication that things will go in the way of the novels at all. Kind of like how the anime hasn't been completely faithful to the novels from the very beginning.         <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127204171  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127204352  These scenarios of yours honestly sound just as delusional as the idea that the yuribait in Hibike! will ever go anywhere.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127204410  I don't care if you're falseflagging or the real deal, just    Wait, the show is already ending?   When you blow for so long, you get light headed and the blood rushes up.  I used to blow  euphos  so I know.       Seems like a counter measure for when people rub it in your face huh, yurifag?      Too bad it backfired and the show is selling pretty poorly for KyoAni.  How this show is selling aside, are sales all that matter to you?  Do you only consider an anime good if it's a financial hit?      It's already bait because Reina loves Taki. Not even Kumiko/Shoe1 is needed.   I never believed once in the yuriending because I got to see the light when Reina defended Taki. Support Taki and Reina. They deserve happiness.      For all we know, KyoAni could end the story at the next episode with no indication that things will go in the way of the novels at all. Kind of like how the anime hasn't been completely faithful to the novels from the very beginning.   As I said if they did that then they wouldn't have introduced the Kumiko is dense about her feelings subplot.       The cheap yuribait hurt the show's quality, sales happen to reflect this.    Nobody believes in a yuri end. This is KyoAni. There probably won't even be a straight straight end.  It's all delusions and I like them.       are sales all that matter to you?  No, but when a studio adds a number of yuripandering scenes that weren't there in the novels while downplaying the canon het romance, it's safe to assume what their motivation was.      But by the way, yuri subtext only becomes bait when things end het.   For all we know, KyoAni could end the story at the next episode with no indication that things will go in the way of the novels at all.  I somewhat disagree. Even if Shuichi doesn't say a single word to Kumiko in the next episode, and Kumiko and Reina share a yuribait scene, I'd still call it yuribait. At this point it's pretty obvious, based on episodes 9 to 12, that it was all yuribait all along.  is my interpretation of the episodes.         Which is why preorders starkly fell after each one of the heavy "yuribait" episodes. Oh wait, that never happened.    Too bad, compare to the novels that subplot feels forced, because that came out of nowhere from Kumiko's end. inb4 idiotic argument.    scenes that weren't there in the novels  But they were.  canon het romance  What canon het romance? Certainly not Kumiko x Shoe1, they're just good friends up to the end of the most recent volume published. Sure Shoe1 would like to take it further, buy Kumiko is euphosexual.       Of course the preorders didn't fall, yurifags got baited and preordered it. Too bad not enough of them got baited for the show to have good sales.    Then lets pray for a music friendship end.     What canon het romance? Certainly not Kumiko x Shoe1, they're just good friends up to the end of the most recent volume published. Sure Shoe1 would like to take it further, buy Kumiko is euphosexual.  Kumiko's reaction to Hazuki and Shuuichi's date in novel 1:   "Hazuki-chan's been like that for a while now."    Sapphire lowered her voice as she responded.   "She's going to the festival with the person she likes today. And she's planning to confess to him."    "Oh man, youth on full display! Gives me heartburn just hearing about it!"   Natsuki's face clearly twisted. Her voice was pretty loud, but Hazuki gave no reaction. Somehow, she couldn't hear a thing.    That "person she likes" was no doubt Shuuichi. In an attempt to turn her attention away from the conversation, Kumiko let out a small sigh. She felt a little sick. As if something in her stomach was bubbling up, a muddy sort of feeling began to well up inside her. And as if it was able to course though every one of her veins, the feeling began to spread throughout her body. As if in an attempt to cool the fever that had accumulated in her fingertips, Kumiko gripper her euphonium tightly. I don't like this. I really don't. She couldn't quite explain why, but the thought simply drifted through her mind.                Hazuki vying to act as a go between for Kumiko and Shuuichi also worked to allow her to bounce back.      that subplot feels forced      I haven't read the novels, but from what I've heard in these threads the "yuri" scenes in the novels were nowhere near as intense as in the anime, while Kumiko's crush on Shoe1 was way more obvious. KyoAni intentionally downplayed the het and intensified the yuri.     But they were.  Don't you know it's against the law to tell lies on the internet?       Shoe1   Stop pretending to be dense you one retard who puts 1 after Shoe.       I talked with my japanese friend and he told me "冥利に尽きる" wasn't actually tied to formality! there's hope, HOPE.    Are you saying I'm replying to myself?    Why Kyoani can't into hands?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127204564   It's canon those shows are het  How can they be "het" when they're not romance shows at all? They're magical girl shows, and yuri undertones are basically a staple of the genre at this point. I don't doubt that it could happen "in-universe" if you would, but I don't think it would ever be animated.  Besides, Madoka living a normal life is dependent on Homura being in control. With her dead, wouldn't Madoka be too busy being God to get a boyfriend?      Fuck you, my cute cartoon girls don't need knuckles.    Oh god.   There's hardly any middle ground here, it's no man's land between mad gay and strictly friends.  Reina and Kumiko aren't in love with each other romantically, but they're extremely close as friends. Especially given each other's eccentricities, Reina has little regard for social norms and strives to be unique and Kumiko is kindred spirit in this regard.   Kumiko being the honest and blunt person she is finds Reina's attitude to life attractive and bonds tighly with Reina, you could say she loves her in a platonic sense.   Add Kyoani's directions and you have a lot of people interpreting this in wildly different directions.         Shitposting aside, I do wonder how Homura would react if Madoka fell in love with a boy in that fake universe and they started dated.  Would she cry herself to sleep while thinking that she's happy as long as Madoka is happy? Or would she erase him out of existence and wipe Madoka's memory of him? Homura is both extremely masochistic and possessive, so she could go either way.      They're usually moving or not the focus of the scene so they don't bother with making them detailed, but they can into hands when they need to.   Who is this semenus demonus?   You're not fooling anyone with those implants, Homura-chan.    best section best waifus    Clearly, Kumiko has been stick stuff up her nose.    Indeed. Sans that rumour mongering Lala of course.   Threadly reminder Reina is old enough to marry.       Why is she always so angry?           Oh fuck my bad that's not her, I got confused with the red ribbons.      28 third years   14 second years   22 first years   Why are second years so useless?       <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127204988  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127205167   Getting this autistic over cartoon lesbians, implied or otherwise  Please tell me you're just shitposting.       冥利に尽きる  What     It's that one guy who's obsessed with Reina getting the T and wants to believe he wouldn't reject her.    Fallout from yesteryear's bandgate.     Novelfag himself said it was a strange 'rejection'. I'm not that guy by the way.     No I mean what is this  冥利に尽きる       and wants to believe he wouldn't reject her.  He doesn't though.     Updated. Now featuring the names of Peace-chan, Right Fagott, and other top hit background waifus!   What's the deal with these two?   They are clarinets  and also murderers     Any information on the cast´s school grades?    Asuka's parents will eventually make her quit the band because of her shit grades.    megane sees for maigami, they share senses through physical contact    Will Reina ever love Kumiko back? please say yes   http://www.bilibili.com/video/av248<wbr>3704/</wbr>   What are you on about? She already loves her back.  Kumiko is her only real friend in the whole world.      It's already subbed and up on nyaa, dude.

Foreshadowing, Asuka's parents force her to quit band to study. Owned.          Not by the end of episode 13, at least.    I feel like KyoAnus is trying to force Shitichi down our throats for the ending.   They actually gave him extra scenes these past few episodes with the trombone trouble. Kumiko and Shitichi don't even interact at all until the second novel after his failure of asking her out.  Tamako Love Story 2.0, fuck KyoAnus       Where you seriously expecting a yuri ending?     Right fagott has a name   Doesn't matter because I'll keep calling her right fagott.      Kumiko and Shitichi don't even interact at all until the second novel after his failure of asking her out.  Isn't there supposed to be a foot stepping on scene in the final episode according to novel spoilers?  Maybe this last episode's Shuichi scenes were a replacement for that since they want to focus on music only in last episode?        Can anybody decipher those Mongolian cave writings? I want to learn my background-fu's name.      Stay salty, faggot.     It's a lead into the foot stomp.    Why would Taki reject her though?    Right Fagott is Oka Mikino, Mikino being her first name.    Because he's not a desperate loser who wants to get laid at all cost and realizes she's just a dumb teen girl with a crush on an older authority figure.  And that's not even mentioning how it would affect his professional reputation or how it would make things awkward with Reina's family as two families are close personal friends.      Thanks, kind Anon.    Eh, he just has to wait until Reina finishes school and there shouldn't be any problems with his reputation. I wouldn't see much of a problem with it from the family perspective if Reina's love is so unconditional she'd be unable to give up on it  besides they know the guy. If he fucks up they'll have him by the balls. Also, age-gaps are kind of a thing in Asia.     I want to buy a fagott but they cost so much.  I just want my old love back.      This reed sucks.   I need to make new ones again.      Why is she inside an instrument case?     reeds internally     Smug fagott is a best.     Amagi   Best of anything  It's one of the worst KyoAni shows, just barely above Chuu2 Ren.      Cry harder, landwhale.    Fagott is hard to learn, expensive and there isn't that many opportunites to play it. I respect anyone who can play it.    Thing is before this episode KyoAni actually cut out a lot of Shuichi interaction that was in the novels, and also completely changed how Kumiko initially reacted to him regarding the Agata Festival.  If anything they're devaluing him.      Midori was creepy and a huge bitch, TomatoxMidori wasnt even a cute pairing. KumikoxReina, on the other hand, its so cute, good and perfect that god would never let it happen    This image has to be bait.  I don't think anyone actually wanted Midori to win.     its a fucking bassoon, who calls it a fagott anyway    People who are bad at Italian?    I only heard Americans calling it a bassoon. It's called a fagott here.    Everyone outside the Anglosphere and France.   Fuck /a/, I have a new waifu     I salute your autism.    WHAT HAVE YOU DONE     Yurifags were clearly upset, and the mod was clearly a huge yurifag.     What happened to the last one?    I used to play it years ago. The only trouble I remember having with it was because I was a child my hands were just a bit too small. Then I became a lazy idiot and quit.     Yurifags   upset   mod   huge yurifag        Didn't get any screen time last episode.    you should as well kill yourself and end your pathetic existence.     It's true though.     You disloyal animal.    Do not demoralize the Kumiko.    You can find that thread on the archives. You can also find /u/ threads about Tamako Market (TV series) on the archives as well.  I just skimmed through those /u/ threads out of curiosity and there's a surprisingly a lot of hate towards Mochizou. I keep hearing they liked him and Tamako and were happy with Midori just being portrayed as a realistic lesbian character. But those threads seem to indicate otherwise.          projecting anon this autistic      bariton saxophone   bariton  Jesus Christ is there any quality control over at kyoani       Then I became a lazy idiot and quit  I bet everyone on 4chan get give an example of that.      Not knowing the difference between bari sax and bariton  Anon pls.     I play the piano so no    Prime damage control.  Yurifaggots are so pathetic.     I just assume it's another arbitrary German rendering, just like Fagott.    bariton is literally German for baritone, there is no such thing as a bariton sax unless you are German and then it is still a baritone sax. they also use the english version for everything else so your point doesn't really stand    I have learned from you just know that there is a an another way to write Bariton.    Those threads were mostly dominated by the delusional /u/ fans. Others just ignored it.    Percussion best section.    I bet you call a fagott "bassoon".    I like it.   US Supreme Court legalize sex marriage in 50 states so why don't we might as well embrace the KumikoReina yuri route?  would you an old taki?   Because Japan thankfully hasn't reached that level of retardation yet.     US Supreme Court legalize sex marriage in 50 states  USA, YES     Same sex marriage is legal in shibuya, educate yourself    Japanese constitution defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Shibuya is just one small part of Tokyo where they have recognized civil unions. Obviously it's a pretty major victory for a country as conservative as Japan, but it's nowhere near real equality.

I want to  hug  Yugi.   Reposting from previous thread  -Title is 'singing the school song' -Megumi goes to borrow the cart from Houjou. Houjou is helping with another stall.  -Isami is supporting Megumi's shoulder -Takumi &amp; Isami open a stall with friends in the street district -Alice speaking with Shiomi -Soma is testing out hujiaobing (Taiwan street food). There's a flashback with his father  -opening ceremony -Hayama and Kurokiba are tired after being dragged around to do things by Alice (what they did is not known) -A scene with Tsukasa, Momo, Rindou,Kuga -Singing the school song (Soma is surprised everyone can sing the school song) -Kuga has made some sort of promise with Tsukasa -Start of school festival<br/>                 Last chapter said that this time the festival would begin, but the spoilers make it seem like it's still mostly a setup chapter. I guess it's still accurate, since I imagine they are singing the school song to kick off the festival, but still.   Who's Tsukasa again?    Bishie first seat-kun.      Cute.    I love me some Megumi spaghetti    Post the other spoiler pics. Also Houjou is so handsome.     Also Houjou is so handsome.  Looks at her casually seducing Megumi.     Well she certainly has a better chance than Souma.  ;_;     First Isami, now Houjou?    Houjou's been giving off yuri vibes towards Megumi ever since she appeared   I have my eye on you girl, fufufu       Megumi has her own harem.   chink scans out.   Two of them are from Alice now, and Souma is obviously for Erina.    Megumi is les bait for some reason. Even if they aren't really lesbians.    I honestly hope that Megumi looks like this in the end of the series    Nah, Houjou x  Souma .    Have a link, anon?     Houjou: I hope I can become...   Houjou: a cook that's well-liked by everyone, like you   Megumi: Oh, please... I'm not...

I kinda disappointed  inb4 she's secretly Souma's sister        &gt;Alice: with Akira-kun, who is my precious friend  oh Alice.     Yes, it's the official color chapter.    Pacha would be a better fit since he is third seat     Why can't an autist do something normal?  Remember we're talking about Tsukasa here     The kanji around her head says "parental love" by the way.    hopefully cousin  not just because it's hot but because we need some Jouichirou backstory      Jun confirmed for best mom.     I wanted it to be black      parental love   Poor Hayama.      He's sonzoned    Because dat everything    I would be funny if Hayama has no romantic feelings for Jun and gets creeped the fuck out when Yoshino or someone tries to bring it up.    Soma's dad implied one needs romantic love    She's fucking 38 or whatever dude. Imagine how sad that'd be. No matter how much asian magic Jun has, by 50 she's already busted and Hayama would be at his peak of maleness. It'd be a timebomb relationship.  That's not even discussing the clusterfuck problem that dating a mother figure would be.      Parental love is strong. It's what drives Shinomiya and he's 1st seat.     because fanfic     Houjou is super handsome.    34, but poor Jun will be forever single.     Ryou dead tired   textbox covers his crotch  What do you mean by this, Tooosh?      Hayama sits like a slav.     calling Curry Akira-kun and pretend they're good friends to manipulate Jun  Alice is future shrewd CEO.     Ryouko, Houjou and Meat have boy admirers, Megumi doesn't    Ryouko has fans?    Yeah, she had some during the Autumn Election     Boys and girls.      meat and Houjou has admirers.   no one notices Hisako.   I don't understand.        She doesn't stick out much.     Boobs  Also, hard to get noticed when you are a satellite to one of the biggest beauties of year one       no one notices Hisako  She's usually a few steps behind Erina-sama in all her glory, and as far as most people were concerned she was just "Erina's secretary" before the autumn election.     Well she has Nao for now.    Now she has Nao.    Is she ever gets a husbando. He will be luckiest guy of the manga.  Best wife material.     She's always near Erina and she always takes the spotlight.     throwing her plushie in the air  2cute     All the girls are "hot" except for Megumi, Yuuki and Hisako who are "cute"    According to the author's comments Hisako is meant to be a bishoujo    Hisako is not cute, she's beautiful and graceful. Unfortunately, she goes everywhere with Erina who is super beautiful and elegant.     It's a mirace Nao survived for this long, her culinary style is extremely niche.    Alice has a fanclub?   While Nao is the scrubbiest of the named characters outside of the buttbros, if you go back to the election and look at the gap between her score and the closest after her, you'll see that she's not in too much danger.    can someone translate this?    I hope it's not like last week when all the words were "Penis" in chinese.     Erina who is super beautiful and elegant.  She's too over the top. Nobody but fools like a jewel encrusted girl.  Hisako has that down to earth grace and sensibility that appeals to long term prospects.

Scans will be out in at least 6 hours.     Too scary.    I wonder if chink boards talk about us like 2ch sometimes does.    Chinese internet is such a mystery. Japanese is obscure enough for me. I'd like to see a documentary or something.     Nope I'm not from Jifeng or whatever. I just have the raws and happen to know basic cleaning.    How so?    Like Erina and Houjou, too intimidating, and Kurokiba is always around her too  Even Ryouko's fans are secretive, only Ikumi and MC girl have loud fans  the sluts        I just have the raws  Then share, mate.      I'll post them in 5 minutes, dude.        Tadokoro will never win, dude.  She doesn't stand a chance.  She's in the same boat as Nikumi.  NO CHANCE.           Thanks Frieza.    Does emcee girl even cook      That Gigganigga and Chan RS leader      Don't listen to that fucker. He's part of Jifengi. Its the same shit as last week, when a troll page was deliberately leaked. Basically, that page is just contains lewd &amp; vulgar Chinese words.  You'd probably see the ShitManga scans released on Batoto later on with those gif watermarks.       giga in the singing shot  haha oh man     The witch girl is there but Nikumi's face is hilarious for some reason.     Giganigga   Don guy   Meat   Hishoko   Erina   Nao          IsamixMegumi OTP     Every word is either let me blow you, no rape tonight or sperm     I hope the translators make this feel like an actual song, instead of translating it too literally.     singing Jesuzaemon  Is there anything that he can't do?     readmanga will steal it so no.   I know those guys monitor this thread      grow younger with a foodgasm    Well, If you're posting fake chinese scans to fuck with readmanga you're okay in my book.    see<br/>    It doesn't fucking matter, because once Jifeng releases their Chinese scans, it'll still be the same, so I don't know why they're wasting their time trying the fuck around with ReadManga.    it is exactly that, you still want it translated?    see<br/>    Not that anon but never mind the words if we have something better than cellphone pics to look at for a few hours.   I don't understand all this stupid international scanlator drama. What the hell is going on?   Just check back on Batoto later on.    You are fucking slow &amp; dense. You're better off now knowing.    Is this your first day here?  Tokyo Ghoul has it worse anyway. These guys are a bunch of turbopussys.      TG doesn't have any issues currently, no? I don't think any group has beef with Imperial Scans.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12719287  I know that Readmanga translates off early chinese scans, but why does anyone give a shit? They blow anyway.    It's fun. People are fighting for being the first pertaking in an illegal activity    Jifeng does give a shit, since RM shamefully uses their scans w/o their permission. RM doesn't even have a raw provider, fyi.    Its not even that; don't try to act smart, since you're making yourself look stupid.     TG doesn't have any issues currently, no?   That fucking landwhale needs to go.      at last! someone gets it. Have a real translation of this page     I hope you guys doing a better job this time around, since you guys fucked up on some of the parts in your pointless troll scans.  Looking forward to the Batoto release later on. :^)      This spread is magnificent.    Souma looking flustered at not knowing the lyrics makes it even better.   I haven't watched the anime yet, or even started to torrent it.   Who's the best sub group?       Nao is actually a recurring side character  Be still my heart.      nah, won't do a release this time. The point of why I released last week was to troll readmanga. Hence the very bad translation. Plus this weeks chapter has a lot of redraws. just wait for casanova or something. looks like they caught up anyways.     Just torrent HS 1080p.    At least you're admitting to it - that's cool. The anons here aren't waiting for Casavova; they're waiting for your scans so that RM can proceed with their 'own' scans,  LOL .     really? what does it say? It looks pretty real to me.     Fuck off non-Chinkfag.    But doesn't HS just rip the Funi? Why wouldn't I just download a Funi rip?    CHING CHANG CHONG CHANG    it was really some whore, dick, rape and sperm. check  for the real text.     They don't (they rip from CR). Alternatively, you can wait a bit longer for the FFF release. Most anons here would DL the 1080p HS, anyway.     But it's our booth that's gonna get all the customers in the main street   Isshiki is in the same area   Isshiki has the PSD   Alice has Ryou and Akira  W-who wins?        How do you know Isshiki's in the main area?   Hate the opening, how strained the singer's voice sounds singing at that register really irritates me  But the ending is EDOTY, please never ever change it      FFF.  Fansubing is dead though.        1080p  Speak for yourself      Most anons here would DL the 1080p  You're an idiot. The source is 720p, MPC-HC upscales better than HS     We're having a new OP/ED tonight, you mongoloid.  I find the OP pretty catchy, so I don't know what you're talking about.      Is FFF shit for this series though?    I think the opening is fine. But yes, the ending is the best.     SnS broadcasts &gt;720p, you faggots.     I know  and you like it because you're shitty      Just use FFF. since you're so concerned about it, when you probably don't even know a lick of nip.    Please stop embarrasing yourself on things you know nothing abot.     stop liking what I don't like!  This is why I detest summer.     Looks like I just assumed this to be the case. N-never mind then.     Nice way to conclude an argument, faggot. :^)    fite me irl fgt 1vs1    He's most likely in the central area, since he needs the space to do his Imoni thing. He even has a river connected to his booth.    because you get grumpy cooped on in your basement until the sun goes down?     How about a cooking battle instead?     Fine, pick a theme    Just fuck off.<br/>    dibs best nakiri sous chef     Portuguese cuisine.  I want to see you weasel yourself out of this one, shitter.       Oh we are doing doubles battle now? Then I pick Doujima as my Sous chef     How about both of you get into a bed to conduct your fight &amp; fuck off from here with your pointless spam?     Here, man.   Souma as a 1st year has the balls to go up against something like this. Who will he challenge in the next years autumn election? Erina? Isshiki? Rematch with Kuga?   New OP/ED soon. Get hype.  People don't recognize basic color themes.  2nd seat has the same colors as Soma because she's the Soma of their group. Just like Shinomiya was the Soma of his generation.  Shit has been consistent for a long time now.       He has a feud with Eizan, so that Jew has to come first. His inevitable clash with Erina would come much further down the line.     I mean festival. Fuck.    Then who's going to be the 1st seat?    Sadly, we don't know the titles of them. Perhaps they'll surface later in the magazine scans.   What do you think changes when Erina finds out who Souma's father is?   Soma, obviously. Because now he's rocking not only his dad's iron grit and steel balls but Shinomiya's magic.  Plus there's no one like Dojima to stop his ascent.      You're reading too much into it. There's nothing much ado about nothing. Shinomiya graduated as the 1st seat, btw.    You be the judge /a/   oc donut steel 2fast4u Caldeirada (marine stew)    Nah, Erina will get there first. Souma will perhaps usurp that seat later on, or share it with her, like an anon in the previous thread predicted.    Nope. Erina will never get the first seat.    Its either Viz or Casanova, so I don't know why you're putting in the last 2.    second/third years have to have some events of their own.  we'll definitely see the festival in years 2 and 3, as it seems to be the first event where 1st years enter the fray against 2nd and 3rd years.      Whoa, I totally wasn't expecting that.    How sure are you?    Casanova over Viz, who cares about the others  Viz is solid, but I don't like the Americanizing, slang, and of course   Food Wars!          You're pretty sly, shitter.  But here's something for you, specially with a twist!  Take a look at this OC shrimp tempura!  You may think that this is a Japanese dish, but in reality the tempura cooking concept was introduced in Japan by the Portuguese merchants.  The basis of this dish not only combine the rich flavor of the contemporary Japanese cuisine, but also the uniqueness of the Portuguese cooking art blending and mixing it all into an orgy of tastes at each bite.  The dish you just served while good, only manages to capture the essence of a part of the country.  While the dish I presented combines the freshness of Japan's sea food with the spices, filling and form of Portugal's tropical climate. You can taste what's best about Portugal and go beyond.  And that is why my dish is superior and this battle is mine.  Shitter.                     Erina probably. Wondering if megumi will be entering the elite ten in the future and what position    2nd seat has the same colors as Soma because they are relatives  iwanttobelieve.jpg      I share your sentiment anon. The only thing Viz has over Casanova is they have better images. Viz makes them sound like a bunch of Americans which loses much of the Japanese atmosphere.     there's no one like Dojima  That's Erina. Hell, Doujima's speech about her, coming from the top student of all time, was basically, "this is the girl who will surpass me".  Of course Souma will also surpass Doujima and his old man too since, he's the MC.       I can only imagine the shitstorm if megumi became 1st    Tadakoro has no chance at anything.    Nonsense. Viz's TL always have a better flow to them. Casanova's are awkward, since they try to be too literal &amp; their proofreader isn't exactly the best.     hey guys wouldn't it be HILARIOUS if Yamcha beat Goku and Vegeta XDDD  This is you     I agree. Now that Viz have discarded their image of Alice as a valley girl ditz, Viz translations are now the clear superior.     XD     I know you're a MehGoomyfag, but you don't have to go so far as to predict her being the 1st seat, which would only occur in a bizarro world.    They both have their good &amp; bad points, so no need to act like a smart-alec in your sarcasm.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127195563  saved  :^)      Not him but it's because the whole point of the series is literally  finding a girl worth cooking for  And because this is a shounen with REALLY cliche character types. The tsundere is going to act all haughty until she loses, has to be rescued by the MC and then realises he's not so bad and that she was wrong all along about him being street diner trash.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127195563  DBZ with food is not much of an upgrade to Fairy Tail with food   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127195563  replace dragonball see    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127195563  Dem aspect ratios. You could do better than that, couldn't you?    Erina will reach the 1st seat first, then lose it later on to Souma, or share it with him. It doesn't make sense for her not to get there, given her prowess. Souma's always playing the catch up game, but he'll reach to her level, eventually.    needs a breadbowl    But the vibe given is that SHE's not the one he's supposed to surpass. She was never meant to be his rival. His rivals have always been his father, the blonde Italian dude and the current first seater.  They are going to show Souma surpassing Erina but it won't be as a rival, it'll be as a stepping stone to Souma's true rival.       She was never meant to be his rival  What are you smoking?    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127195712   "maybe if i pretend to be retarded people will just assume all of SnS fanbase is retarded."     Don't reply to bait     Hell no. It only feels like it has a better flow because uses American English that you're comfortable with. And Alice still sounds like valley girl just with brains.   Viz is also far too liberal with their translation they alter the context of the original. In addition they omit honorifics except oddly "senpai" or nicknames such as "chin" and never bother to explain it to their readers.       this is just plain retardation       Nice dubs.  But for real, I agree with the anon to some extent. She seems more like the mid-boss that joins the hero's side halfway through.        She seems more like the mid-boss  You're even more retarded than said retard.     momo senpai so kawaii     Not that anon. But if he's so wrong then provide your argument to disprove him. Unless shitposting is the only thing you got.      Anon the author won't be hyping her just so she can jobb at the midway of the story. Doujima considers her a Great Cook in the making just read the bath scene with Souma. She'll be the last boss for him to fight or the boss before he fights he's dad. He still has to make her acknowledge his cooking at least in a verbal way. And if it's still too hard to understand just see pic related.     forgot pic.    They don't fully grasp the frightening power &amp; potential of God's Tongue (with her godlike cooking abilities at her age), &amp; its only a matter of time both of them would overtake Jouichirou.  Doujima just doesn't consider her a great cook; he even went on to say she'd become Tootsuki's greatest masterpiece if she continues on this path.      Not any of those anons but we know Erina is the strongest of their year by far. Moreover, we've essentially been told she's the strongest first year the school has had, in an unusually strong year, no less.  The setup for the story from the get go was Jouichirou closing Yukihira's for 3 years, and telling Souma that during that time he should go attend and graduate from toutsuki. Barring the manga getting axed, the climax is Souma's third year.  The five strongest at the school are on their way out in about 4 months. Until then, they'll very likely be extremely busy preparing for their final exam and their actual lives post schooling and won't have much time to dick around with even the 2nd years, much less the 1st years.  There's no one else at the school qualified to be the final boss of the school at the end of the story for Souma to face since the upperclassmen will leave. If Tsukuda were to introduce a genius underclassman coming up from the middle school to challenge the top, that would just be Erina 2.0 anyway.  Of course, after graduating, Souma needs to finally face his dad in the real final boss battle. But that has nothing to do with the school.             introduce character meant to be abnormally strong   don't let the MC beat them  Anon, is this your first shounen?      Pretty much what I wanted to say there.  But, how to see see things playing out between both of them, in their final year? I'm pretty darn certain Erina will first obtain the 1st seat, &amp; Souma would want to slug it out with her for that. It could be a back &amp; forth thingy, with them interchanging the 1st &amp; 2nd seats.      He didn't even mention Souma wouldn't beat Erina. Learn2read.     Mary Sue  why are you such a faggot?    Tonight.   /u/?    autism  sigh.jpg      Those eyes are probably the most erotic eyes i've ever seen, Probably why i like her character aside from the trolling       <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126898629        How is that even /u/ related? Its that panel whereby she intently gazes/stares at Souma.  They got her eyes right, I think.      I want to see how they do her pouty face.     Mr. Skewers in the back     You don't have to spoonfeed those retards. They always thing 720p's the way to go. They don't even have a clue some of the anime airing this season are higher than said format.   Isshiki's dream.    Nakiris incest  Yes please.     スカ ブッリア     Nao looks kinda cute here    She's always cute. Hair over one eye is second only to himecut and drills.    Jesus christ, those two are perfect. Their appearance in this scene is anime original isn't it?    As if that wasn't apparent already.    Nope. She looks way cuter in her 'white' form.     that slavsquat   perfect      You mean four. I'm pretty sure buttbros, Ryoko or Yuuki were not on in the dream    Butt-bros, Ryouko &amp; Yuuki aren't supposed to be there. Souma &amp; Smoke are missing.    Buttbros? They got extra drawing with Ryouko and Yuki in tankoubon as delinquent. Pretty much like that scene.     Amen to that. Tosh better give her that makeover later on. She needs a stronger dosage of Hisako's medicinal food.   <br/>    No, you guys are right, but what I mean here is that her smiley and playful face while singing looks cute      it says tempura right on the jacket  Well, as if his specialty couldn't be any clearer. I wonder if Shouji's says the same.     I want to see her reaction to Souma's food.     Top dog of Polar star  I've seen this like 20 times and I still chuckle at that.     I want to sure 'white' forms for more people.  Actually that should be Hisako's thing. Her medicinal cooking makes them more pure instead of foodgasming.  Imagine Meat or Mad Dog going pure.  I don't know if my heart could handle "white" Megumi.          It's a way to sit down without a chair and without touching the filthy ground. You see it in China a lot as well.      She's "white" enough.     Isami being a gentleman and supporting Megumi   Takumi being an autist at Souma as usual  Fuck's sake.     chink scans where   they're being the usual duo, so it's actually both of them helping her    how does the god's tongue taste like?      wanting her to be a generic bishie   heresy       Her eyes just look like a vampire's, I wish the inner corneas were lighter because they look white in the manga.    Tongue takes a long time to prepare but when it's ready it will be incredibly soft, almost buttery. It'll taste a bit like roast pork, since humans taste like pork and the tongue mimics the taste of the other meat on the animal.    He's yelling at Souma for letting a girl carry such heavy things, it's not gentlemanly.   we will get a flashback arc starring Soma's dad telling why he left Tootsuki and how her Soma's mom, ri-right?    He could have actually helped her instead of just yelling at Souma.     He doesn't need to help if Isami is.    We all know he talks more than actually does shit.   124 chink scans is out  http://www.jifengi.com/5379  Scans here chaps.      http://www.jifengi.com/5379      Absolutely no maid outfits in sight  Yeah, fuck this.    where is the other half, I only count 8 pages  Can any of you kind anons roughly translates what sort of promise these two makes ?   nevermind, loading is fucked up    Where is Big Nigger?    He can be seen singing the school song.    It's just the page shows us top-9 of first years but with Isami instead of Giganigga.  Foreshadowing? Who cares about Nigga anyway, would be glad if author replaces him with Isami.      Akira's face.     I want Isami to impregnate that plain grill's womb    Kuga: Tsukasa Senpai, are you still keeping that promise?     What a bunch of pussies.  So the so called Elite Ten can't crush those first year kids without joining hands? Weak.       I think they'll have kuga's back for a bit, then when it's obvious souma is doing well and kuga can't crush him they'll "you failed us" him and abandon him    I doubt Tsukasa will aid Kuga.  It's probably the same way Souma wanted to fight Kuga, Kuga wanted to fight Tsukasa.  Remember Kuga says 2nd year Elite Ten are busy challenging the 3rd year Elite Ten and the 3rd year are graduating soon.         How is Souma finding Erina every chapter?      Red string of fate, nigga. Do you even nip?   They're touching, that means they're OTP O T P     First seat&amp;Yugi against Souma&amp;Megumi  What in the fuck.    Hújiāo bǐng   Someone feed me.    Nothing happens: the chapter.    I was used to her only appearing a few chapters and the disappearing. Now it just seems like she is following them because she is lonely.    I thought Kuga is just a weak ass pussy... He means bussiness    Seriously think he is actually the weakest of the bunch not worthy of 8th seat before        Now it just seems like she is following them because she is lonely.  t-that's cute anon     I don't think so. Just look at Yugi's expression when he posed that question to Eishi, &amp; Eishi gave him the 'unassuring' look in return.    It would be pretty neat if Kuga is trying to beat Tsukasa in the same way Souma is trying to beat him.    This is exactly what I am thinking, not sure why anyone get the idea Tuskasa is helping Kuga.    He'd job badly. A 9th seat actually trying to pit his skills against Tootsuki's best.     Erina + Hisako   Takumi + Isami   Souma + Megumi   Alice + Currynigger and Kurokiba  Alice sure got the strongest fucking assistants. Not only each of them stronger than the rest of first years bar Erina, she's got TWO of them. What a sneaky bitch.         Must be height complex.     She'd EASILY own her area, provided Isshiki's not in it, which I think so.    Kurokiba won't use his bandana and currynigger doesn't really give a shit.    I actually think that nor Isshiki nor Nene will be first seat next year, but Eizan. I think he has some keikaku.     Probably, if she starts getting good I hope Isshiki steps it up.    You overestimate that Jew too much. Its a toss-up between Isshiki &amp; Nene, IMO. I've said before I wouldn't be surprised if Erina, in terms of cooking skills &amp; whatnot, has already surpassed Eizan &amp; Yugi.    I hope Isshiki becomes #1 then Erina challenges him betting every single club she owns. Isshiki's part of the deal is forcing her to join the PSD.     I doubt Isshiki will focus on quantity with what he planned, he will focus on quality only.    people would still say that Souma doesn't see Takumi as a rival    Well if Eizan ends up first seat that would be one way for Souma to get first seat in second year because you know he's going to beat him soon.     Isshiki's part of the deal is forcing her to join the PSD  Megumifags would be on suicide watch.     She has the two strongest assistants that aren't giving it their all. She would have done better with Souma than with Spice.    fucking make it happen TSUKUDA !    It'd have Erina jobbing, obviously they'd be happy. The happiest bunch would be Hisakofags, because she'd get both screentime and interactions with Souma.     A lot of things happens though, so fuck off faggot.    Yeah, but if he's in another area, it'll be quite pointless to do comparisons, so if Alice &amp; gang don't gobble up the businesses in their area, they'd be seen as massive jobbers (provided there is no E10 trying to be different &amp; set his/her booth up in said area).   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127202944   ;(  Are you fucking serious? Do you want to be reported?     Doesn't matter if he does in-universe Takumi still sucks and is a jobber. It's completely unbelievable that he's actually a rival to Souma.     Aldini's "friends".     I don't see it that way. Alice could just give out the order &amp; Ryou would be in his berserker mode. Curry doesn't want to see his waifu's stall do badly, so he'd step his game up, as well.    In an imoni kai, people cook stew in a huge pot and then give portion sizes to people, so I'm pretty sure he'd give quantity aside from quality.    True. People just can't take that Italian pretty boy jobber seriously anymore. He's coming the comic relief/running gag of this manga.     Curry doesn't want to see his waifu's stall do badly  are you referring to Alice ? or Jun If it's Jun sorry mate he's been sonzoned      It doesn't really matter, since Isshiki doesn't have any agenda to compete with anyone. He just wants to soak in the hustle &amp; bustle of the festival itself, &amp; enjoy the entire process with the PSD members.     mfw /a/ was right and Isami and Takumi don't have any friends     Jun, who else? The booth still belongs to the Shiomi seminar, after all.    Souma and Takumi are friends.    Fat people usually get bullied in school and don't have any friends, so it's only realistic in Isami's case.   New to this, but I am cleaning the scans right now, if someone provides a quick translation I can post it here in ~1h   but seriously, I'll do it if someone translates it on the spot      I'm a chinkfag, but I won't assist a Megumishitter. Look for someone else.    Your typesetting a shit    shit taste   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127202944   Gettin real tired of your shit    Tired of what exactly? He had Mimisaka legally enter the competition to try to fairly beat Souma in a tournament and did what else? He's barely a villain, the expulsion shit was unplanned, and he helped Souma enter the tournament in the first place by overriding Erina during deliberations.   Just shows what a cocky attitude and a couple of stink faces can do to your perception if you're not a cute girl or fujobait.        Just wait for the ever-reliable ReadManga team. Why bother wasting your time over something you're doing for free?    8th.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=NJr<wbr>mNqgbv0A</wbr>  [ ]  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127203500  0/10 try harder    why bother, readmanga's on the move, casanova is practically done.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127203500   How dare you create thread for a popular anime/manga on the anime/manga board.      casanova practically done  They're the slowest of the bunch, faggot.     oh really? they're just giving courtesy to Viz to release first. I can post the whole chapter but meh it's not worth it.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127203500  Nice dubs. You could've posted the FT-meme instead of that, you faggot.    I can post the whole chapter  Post what?       tfw your adoptive mother sells you to a rich girl.    She's just happy he has managed to make 'friends' in the academy. There's no 'selling' involved, whatsoever.    casanova's finished chapter with just some QCing to do. I bet the readmanga guys just moved their asses because they saw my reply haha     tohoku accent is so moe    Who are you? What are you in charge of?    Post it faggot.   So how does this work? Is there a huge fucking fire in the middle or something?    Google's your best friend.    all this autism  I'm surprised this thread is still here.   Newfag here: Is there going to be stream of some sort for todays episode?    Probably the same way Rocket stove work. Just a small fire or charcoal and because of the design it generates very little smoke.     but meh its not worth it  Confirmed for talking out of his asshole. Keep eating out of it /a/, keep eating out of it.      He's not going to post it because they are doing it as a courtesy for Viz. And that's smart.     Probably steam?    Okaerinasai. Looks like you have nothing to TL today.  Or he's just bullshitting. Casanova have never been known to be this fast, even before Viz appeared.      You're probably right.     looks like you have nothing to TL today  Nothing Shokugeki-related, that is.     So forgettable. Erina's single's nothing special as well.     Yes, in the usual place.  Change the last word in the stream link to "princess", then select Douyu.  New episode starts in 3 hours.      They're charcoal baked in a metal drum, which mirrors a traditional tandoor clay-ish oven, so its not oily, at all.    Someone tell me what's so great about macaroons. In my opinion they taste average and the consistency is meh.    tfw chapter would be finished if someone would finally translate it    Fuck off.

Bottom Left      What happens if you take away Momo's plush toy?    Probably her or Sword would kill you.    She'll lose all her skills. The plush is the real cook, the girl is just a vessel.    She got a panel with Ryoko's man.   Yuuki NTRing Ryoko when.       Why is there a leprechaun?     NTR   implying they won't share      Is that a pantyshot? Based TOSH.     implying Smoke is a slut      It'd have Erina jobbing, obviously they'd be happy.  Her jobbing would be nothing compared to the fact that she'd be part of main cast and grab Souma's attention.  Now that I think about it, that would be great. Imagine all the spaghetti Erina's gonna spill. Plus, she would gently btfo Megumi, becoming her friend and bickering with Souma at the same time.       Erina spaghetti   while being butthurt   Megumi crying   Niku jelly   everyone in the dorm trolling   hisako being the wingman  It's such a perfect thing.         is Tosh at his prime? damn imagine his Doujins if he is on his prime    Implying anime won't get 2 more seasons      implying Smoke isn't a slut     yeah my first thought would be how hilarious almost the entire cast bursting into song would be.    Is link provided here when the time comes   Why is commie taking ages to release the subs?    watching Commie     Spoonfeeding isn't encouraged over here, so fuck off.    No because there is a fucking faggot who keep reporting the channel and it was taken down last time, that's why no one will give you a link. Search in the archive by yourself, you have 2 hours.     They're better than HS, when it comes to Yahari.  Why are they taking so long, again?       My cousin works as a key animator at JC Staff (yes, I know this sounds like that meme) and she said another season is more or less confirmed regardless of poor sales. It's what they did with Bakuman and Medaka Box.  Feel free not to believe me because I'm taking the news with a grain of salt myself, my cousin loves trolling me.  Index S3 will be announced THIS month, honest         Is douyu a slideshow for anyone else?    I believe in you. The anime boosted the manga sales so it's probably true.    No, it's working for me.    Not him but it was reported? I don't usually watch streams, but the last time I watched one, the usual place was ccXXXXXX45. Anyways, thanks for mentioning it.     damn. for me it's just like still image, stutter, still image, stutter and so on.    This one doesn't exist since last year because the streamer got a job. We use other stream now, search in the archive.     Oh shit this is genius.    It's working for me, it's even showing a preview for Charlotte.   I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA!   Enjoy being castrated by Hisako.    She needs a cum bath though.    them fucking nasty feet tho    I WANT TO CUM INSIDE HISAKO    No shit, you literally ripped chink scans and removed the text. You are by no means a saint for doing that    Meat's face is so cute    Testicles are a delicacy.    So what, faggot?    They look fine, they're just bent odd angles.   Enjoy being boiled alive by Nao.      Well I quess this newfag just waits for the subs then.  Are the food here as bizarre as Cooking Master Boy?   Can't wait for the colored version.  Can be a nice desktop wallpaper if cleaned.      megumi a shit  dropped      Everything up to Vol 13 is updated at http://imgur.com/a/rY6Rd  Anyone know which volume this is from?     Volume 4.    I support this.    Did Royal translated the Isobe Isobee Monogatari extra yet?    kyoot    Confirmed by my russian friend.     I really do like how they're putting in every extra little bit from the covers, volumes, etc  And not rushing the story in any way, the pacing is great.  And keeping up the animation quality rather well  Is this really J.C. Staff? This adaptation is phenomenal  Here's to praying they don't start rushing things for the election, and just wait for a second season. I don't know though, leaving things at the end of the curry preliminaries is kind of a crappy spot to end a season.              the pacing is great.   And keeping up the animation quality rather well   Jesus fuck this delusion       not him, but it's pretty good for JC Staff. it actually feels like they're trying to make this anime good, unlike with danmachi    Are you saying Danmachi wasnt aots?     it actually feels like they're trying to make this anime good, unlike with danmachi  Souma is less animated than Danmachi     J.C. Staff tends to make good adaptions. Hating them is a meme.    It's rushing as fuck though.     J.C. Staff tends to make good adaptions  Yeah like Raildex      And not rushing the story in any way, the pacing is great.  The pacing is fucking terrible, why did have to make this two episodes is beyond me.   And keeping up the animation quality rather well   What animation?         average, rehashed premise ruined by cliche, only propelled to popularity by hestits and her fucking ribbon.    Souma isn't rushed at all. It's running about 2.25 ch per ep.     It's rushing as fuck though.  What the fuck am I reading?  It's adapting 2-3 chapters per episode, which is perfectly standard and just the right pacing. No panel is overlooked, and they even add extra stuff from time to time.  Any faster and you stop appreciating each detail, any slower and you venture into One Piece domain. You don't know shit.        First Gakkou Gurashi CM: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Yxf<wbr>ztD5ksls&amp;feature=youtu.be</wbr>  [ ]  It looks pretty good.     First time I'm hyped for a Lerche show since Carnival Phantam.   Well that was  misleading   Looks fine, but how they handle the post apocalyptic parts and the zombies is going to make or break the adaptation, so it's pretty much nothing.    The CM already trolled us  based Lerche     Didn't watch the CM but they usually put the best looking scenes from the first few episodes in those.    Alittel disappointing that there are no zombie or dog zombie in that CM    They can't even go that far with this or they'd spoil people.  Man, the inevitable reactions of people who will watch this blind are going to be golden.      Not bad.    Seems like they decided to increase the dog's screntime, huh. That's good   it's gonna hit like a brick when he got turned.      Unless GG is getting priority treatment from Lerche I don't see it ending up good.   Which scenes are we looking forward to the most?  Wow, it sure is comfy SoL with loads of heartwarming moments. Pick up.    Man, the inevitable reactions of people who will watch this blind are going to be golden.   The key visuals and synopsis already state they are survivors of a zombie apocalypse, anybody who overreacts to the "tweest" would be a faggot pretending to be retarded like this guy       I think everyone knows the twist. However, I think a lot of people believe it'll be a cute sort of zombie apocalypse with no real suffering. There's plenty of LNs and such like that.    Obviosuly.  Also, the zombie dog.       There are still people who just download shit blindly without even reading the synopsis or just based on screenshots.    They've also updated the official site.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Gw-<wbr>WkbDHBT0</wbr>  [ ] https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GsA<wbr>moRoe0Zk</wbr>  [ ]  The other two      That mysterious new girl is also colored now. Oh and apparently MOSAIC.WAV is composing the music for the series.    The helicopter!  Or, if they go for a second cour,  the eventual breakdown of everyone in the cast. :)       The eyes look weird.    Who the fuck are these people   How will they handle what happens afterwards?   Fuck off     Is this the first genuine grimdark zombie apocalypse anime we've had? HotD obviously doesn't count since that's some campy B-movie cheese and some of the other series with zombie elements I've recalled are in the same boat as well.  Huh. That's pretty queer if not rather interesting.    Another SoL? Kiniro was enough to be honest.   Oh god, yes. Little girls suffering is delicious.  Man, closed eyes one is gonna get everyones killed isnt she.       when there's off model QUALITY shots in the fucking preview, you know a show is not worth watching. DROPPED.  only thing left on my summer watch list is Working S3. i guess the nips really want me to drop this hobby and go out and get a life...    Translation when?    You'd think that there'd be more when that zombie boom a few years back happened.     It's Lerche and they are doing like two more shows next season, your fault for getting your hopes up.  Also, I don't know what to think of the supposed 8 or so writers working on it, it can be a complete mess.       Fuck. First we lost radio-chan and now this !?       I want edits of this image    sorry    A teacher, school president, Kurumi's dead crush, I don't remember the girl.    She'll probably just be an anime original victim.    When indeed...    Which ones?  The one who is infected or the one who mindbroke?       Kurumi's dead crush   wtf?      7. And considering that the original author is in charge of the composition I don't think that it should be bad.    Don't worry, the little girl is very tough  and soft like a teddy bear      I hope so.    It's fine,  it's not like she was ever really there    I hope that they'll release the actual PV earlier than on July 2.   He was faceless in the manga.   How early on does it get revealed that  Yuki is imagining Megu-nee?  It has been a while since I've read the first part of the manga.  I feel this will turn out like that tarot Madoka ripoff. Generic suffering.   Isn't that the retard from who was infected in supermarket?    All of them.   Why did they add that weird pink surrounding her pupil?  It's like she is staring straight into my soul. If you replaced that part with more brown it would look way better.      I was thinking the same, but I'm not sure.   No, this guy's the very first zombie Kurumi ever killed.    Oh shit, this means they'll expand the pre-outbreak flashbacks and drag the delusion switch all the way to the end of ep1.   Who's looking forward to them meeting some new girls (from Idolmaster)?   What happened to the crossbow    Who are these sluts?    This was brilliant. Cant remeber a zombie movie or manga that has done something similar. Maeby andys tape from the dawn of the dead remake.    Middle looks like the one who'd die first. Left does things to my dick    Forgot pic  My new waifus.         It'd be nice if the adaptation got this far, but I doubt it. Nice sucker punch for the last episode maybe     This happened.    So cute girls really are the best at surviving in this world, huh.    Actually a lot of shit happened in this chapter.     Can someone upload them elsewhere? They're blocked in Germoney.     ...why?    Sasuga shovel -chan.  Incredible how the blackhaired one manage to survive zombie apocalypse with a skirt that short.  Imagination loli cant show expression like those.        Rape scenes incoming.    Can you link the full chapter here? Thanks.    GEMA    If anyone wants to take a look  http://www.mangaumaru.com/archives/<wbr>452324</wbr>     http://www.mangaumaru.com/archives/<wbr>452324 Here you go. </wbr>   Spoilers... spoilers everywhere.  But no translations.    How far behind are the translations? I caught up last week but there seem to be plenty of new pages here.   One chapter behind, the one that was released a few days ago.    2 chapters     All the characters in the mangas is more than 18 years of age. They are professionally hired legally mature actors and the age appearance is due to the settings in the manga, the support of computer graphic, and SFX make-ups.  kek     If we find some korean-english translator we'll be getting chapters really soon since the korean raws come out almost the same day as the new magazine issue.    Use freeproxytube, I did too.   How do you turn your face into an ass?    http://www.mangaumaru.com/archives<wbr>/452324</wbr>  cannibals?     By being Yuki motherfuckin' Takeya, that's how.    The left one has quite sexy  dre ss.    Because the boys died first fighting the worst part.  Other than waiting for the animation of some of the manga scenes, I can't wait to see what kind of printed porn will be published for this show      I'm sure all we'll get is cute yuri doujins!  Who I'm I kidding? ;_;       this series   the hordes of assmad SoLfags who are gonna think this is simply K-on: now with zombies walking into this   all the rage that will happen   dem river of tears that will happen over the course of the series.  i've got my buckets ready.          I'm 110% gook. I can translate this shit right now if you want me to. But I'm a lazy piece of shit, so you'll have to give me the scans.      What will the new Note 5 look like? Will they retain the SD card slot?    I don't know, man. I'm pretty content with my S4, I don't look into the latest smartphones.     all the rage that will happen  Why the hell would there be rage?    Yeah, its failure. Another good manga bites the dust.   I'm that SoLfag, and I fucking love the manga.   You are all trolled and it actually will be cute sol about girls eating cake and drinking tea.   Meanwhile new season of NNB will reveal that it happens in Higurashi area and the region will be sealed of because of zombie infestation      Adaptations don't deviate from the source like that you fucking clown.    megane looks smug as fuck.     Higurashi area  It's Hinamizawa. And you're so fucking hilarious. Thanks for the non-laugh.    I still don't know what this show is about but I'm excited.   Cute zombies doing cute things   Don't worry, I'm going to pretend to be surprised when the twist happens, it's going to be fun.   TV animation that is started broadcasting from July 9, 2015 is the "school Gurashi!" But, MOSAIC.WAV the music I was allowed to work.    MOSAIC.WAV   This is the best thing that could have possibly happened.      She never say she like him BUT you probably think any implication for boys is 100% romantic and her flirting with Yuuki is just bait Holly Jeez, you standar is getting to lame to even considere a faceless character as legit crush,     comig    Looks fucking dog shit, manga art is waaaaaaay better  Good job Lerche      I seriously hope you'll be dead by the time it airs, I don't want you to ruin the threads with your useless opinions    No, I will live and fight     Is your retard Engrish some sort of character trait to go along with your namefaggotry?    I am genuinely worried about why the dog keeps showing up if it was only in the manga for half a chapter. It had better not signify that they are meddling with the manga's story significantly.   Don't respond to Mugino, he's a well-known man-hating retard.    Remember when we thought J.C. Staff was a bad idea? I kind of regret it now    I hope that was just a little typo    They're just bait/switching.     Life  More like Undead     I'm feeling healed already.    Maybe they decided to increase its screntime so that it'll hit harder when the dog "dies".     yuri lover winner  fixed  No? Ha       At least they toned down the hypnotoad pupil glow from the first key visual    I can't find chapter 36   The manga is so good that I imported it. The anime better deliver.   Just this time, open wide  http://marumaru.in/b/manga/336   I'm planning to do so when it airs.       Reread it in preparation for the anime    http://www.mangaumaru.com/archives/<wbr>428954 There you go.  http://www.dm5.com/m204142/ This one for the chink version.    </wbr>   Did official really think they can mislead people by release these kind of PVs?   No. http://www.nowhereelse.fr/samsung-g<wbr>alaxy-note5-coque-107947/  You're better off getting a LG G4 now.  </wbr>    If it was an original, they would. Like Madokes.   I worry about twintails.   Not long til she turns. Suicide chapter incoming.    Don't worry, she is just the current host of the shovel, and if she dies it will choose another girl to become best girl.    Will the shovel's new host also have twintails? If not, then no dice.    So far the CM is misleading, thank god   I kinda worry about them, something is making me remembering about  meeting a dog and clown rape       You know, most shovels aren't all that heavy. The actual spade portion is the lightest part of the shovel and it's flat, so it encounters air resistance. Doesn't this make for an extremely shitty weapon? Kurumi actually shouldn't be able to sweep zombies off their feet with a shovel. It'll be like trying to sweep a glass cup with a single wooden chopstick. Very hard.   She will have  ponytail       Where's the zombies?    Since there's no Cricket-bu at their school, she doesn't have the ultimate zombie killing weapon.     I really hope this isn't a trend.    I'm planning to do so when it airs.  That's actually a pretty good idea. Make it look like the anime worked as successful advertisement. Someone should tell the buyfag threads this.         That was a genuinely fun movie    Why is it that Brits prefer Shaun of the Dead whereas Americans tend to prefer Hot Fuzz?     girl on the left  das it mane     You want them to spoil it? Nah.    Those new girls are gonna die, aren't they. Whatever happens I want the one on the left to survive ;_;   I'm feeling healed already   Hot Fuzz has guns. Plural.    Shit can't unsee now. It's just a hairpin though.    I'm_feeling_healed_already.jpg     I'm not the only one who doesn't trust them, right? The guys chasing the RV in the car were probably good guys, and these girls are cannibals or some such.      and it's flat, so it encounters air resistance  Rotate 90 degrees, now it has no air resistance.     Heh, that would be a good twist.    This isn't Terminus.   Why are the manga designs so better than the anime designs?   Can't be sure about that, since there is no translation for now    That's the case for nearly every manga to anime adaptation ever.    Gee, I wonder.    The manga designs are exceptional.    They really are, looks even better on paper.     It isn't just the character designs, or even the art style. The artist for this is just plain good at drawing. Things like their despair faces, drawing the tonal shifts, the mental distortion, all of those could be in any character design or with any art style, but it takes a good artist for them to really work.     It'll still meet air resistance in combat. It's impossible to always have the shovel in that angle at all times in practice.    This shit look cute as fuck, is worth to pick it up?    Depends really. You can also sharpen the corners of the spade and use it as a spear. Also, some shovels are made to appear light but they can be very heavy. If it's light, they are made so they can withstand heavy hits.    It's not out yet   I honestly hope they tone up the yuri undertones, the manga lacks of it (though there's some here and there). I believe in Lerche.   They ain't KyoAni. Enjoy your HEALING.     use it as a spear  Kurumi's shovel clearly is not   they can be very heavy  If they're heavy, a high school girl would get exhausted really fast, even if she is athletic. She seems to wield it pretty liberally, so it's safe to assume this is a light spade.   If it's light, they are made so they can withstand heavy hits.  Yes, the spade itself would take no damage. My point is, it's not an efficient tool to swing in a horizontal/vertical fashion. It's meant to strike downwards. If you tried to swing low horizontally at an average 60kg adult with a light spade, it'll stop dead at their heels. It'll hurt a lot, though.           Her shovel reminds me more of those army shovels. Could be made thicker.    kek   Yeah they did kind of fuck up the designs       I'm not sure if Kurumi's spade being worth a milliion dollars and being the best spade in the world would make that much of a difference.  The shape of a spade just makes it a shitty weapon. It's large but not heavy and mostly blunt, and the tip is flat so it meets air resistance. It's like swinging a baseball bat with a frying pan attached to the tip. You could do a lot better without the frying pan.  Another shitty aspect is the handle. The handle is fucking perpendicular to the spade. If you want to swing horizontally or vertically, you can't grab it by the handle, but the handle portion is large enough to get in your way. And moreover, the spade is too light but LARGE so it tires you out when you swing it one-handed, due to the center of gravity being far from you.  If Kurumi wants to kill a zombie, she has to one hand on the handle and her other hand on the middle of the bar and either stab/strike downwards, HARD. This means she'll be pretty up close with the zombie whenever she does this. I'm a 23 year old guy, and digging about 2 five-feet holes wears me out, and I have to take a breather. If killing a zombie takes the same amount of effort as digging a five-foot hole, then Kurumi's some sort of superhuman in this manga.          Guess what happens when you get infected but somehow manage to recover via vaccine.    If you're implying she's gotten zombie-strength, she's been zombie-hunting with a spade before she got infected.    You forget that zombies are basically made of paper mache.    I don't know, man. At the end of the day, the spade thing isn't that big a deal, and I will enjoy this manga regardless. But it seems the author takes care to have the story spin out in a fairly realstic way, and it slightly triggers my autism that he forgot how a spade is a really shitty weapon IRL.   ITT: You try to guess the best girl of a series you never watch  I'll start       There's only one answer for that series more wrong op.        Close enough    glasses   ever being the best     God no     of a series you never watch   Touhou   Apart from that though, you're correct entirely. I would have also accepted Aya.      I heard that everybody loves Perrine. So she must be best girl.    You couldnt be more wrong    Patrician taste         newfags        d-do I fit in yet?    Very patrician   Thats the newfags favourite response. Seems like I was right.      Close, I do love Perrine, but she is still a stupid cunt which prevents her from being best girl. I say she is 3rd best under Yoshika and Lynette, Yoshika at the top.      Snake?   you failed miserably OP      My niggahs of fellow correlation and melatoninic skin.  Also I guess original-design Hanekawa is never again?      Why are most anime broadcast in 720p and upscaled for HD channels/blurays? Do most studios just no have the resources to draw animation in 1080 or is it something like creative another incentive for people to buy the bluray release?  Pic unrelated    Post an anime that you think gets too much hate on /a/.   I don't even know what that is, so.     Space Dandy.    none  if they are getting a lot of hatred in the divisive board of /a/ then they probably deserve it.      if they are getting a lot of hatred in the divisive board of /a/ then they probably deserve it  Or maybe they're just super popular.     muh filler  It's supposed to be mostly filler, fuck These threads usually get filled with people defending bebop though so probably not       I never understood why. It was great and surprising. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=guG<wbr>AfggANuU</wbr>  [ ]      Bullshit. This movie deserved all of the hate it got.    Ugly artwork   Cannot identify with, sympathize with, or even care about MC no matter what happens to her.    MC behaves like an idiot over things that should actually be either understood or she should have been informed about before the start of the mission (eating, sleeping, getting sick, the repercussions of using the body of a young teenage girl in a post-apocalyptic setting   cringe inducing music   Plot with the robot trying to leave earth was the most interesting part but was utterly destroyed by concentration on everything else   Fight scenes were boring            All of that is wrong.    More than likely this.    People expected something similar to Cowboy Bebop or Samurai Champloo and got this instead.   I personally do not think it is horrible but it is definitely not a masterpiece. I really didn't enjoy it until halfway into the second cour.     Everyone just likes to throw around the P word to chuff themselves up.  It has great comedy, action, memorable characters, atmosphere and a fresh story (even for today).     You must have been watching a different movie.   The ending was perfect   Don't forget fuck-ugly 3DCG. People keep on saying its proof that CG can replace traditional animation, but I'm convinced those people are goddamn blind.    um, what movie did YOU watch?  also he left out  abysmal pacing        No.   This is only semi-valid complain.      Yes it has flaws and all but it's still a good adaption. Just because it isn't perfect doesn't mean its fucking terrible. Hating Ufotable in general has almost become a meme at this point.   I don't think I've ever seen anyone hate this actually. Just a lot of "meh"s.    The only people I see actively hating on it are dudes who are sperging some fights didn't go exactly as they saw them in their heads.    Agreed. I found Ergo to be only so-so myself but it's still a good show.    It would be awesome if someone cut it up and overlayed it with VN.    No one hates anything. It's just that memes are fun and if you don't like memes then I don't know what to say.     This wasn't GOAT by any means, but I still don't see the argument other than the terrible half-assed ending.  The manga was great.       This may not have been the best anime of the year, but I am 100% convinced that people only hate it to look cool. If not that they just hate it because they were annoyed at how many threads it got, which is no reason to hate a show.   Terrible route but Ufotable did a good job animating it.    EDGGGGGGGGGGGGE GORRRRRRRRRRRRE And the characters are pretty shit. That's it really. I would be so hype for a remake  by literally anyone other than ARMS         muh edge   muh gore   It wasn't that edgy, nor was it trying to be.       People hate space dandy?    space blandy is shit though    Comedy was unexceptional. I can't remember a damn thing about any of the characters besides their names and character designs.   Why do people hate this anyways?   Why even include the dog scene then    Popularity and Reddit. I don't think it's as good as the latter says but it isn't shit by any means.    Explains part of the reason Lucy hates humans.    Literally all it had was blood spatters and fanservice. The plot was contrived as fuck and the characters had no personality. It's fine when you're fourteen and have no standards but anyone who actually thinks it's decent is deluded.    this. The anime was not that bad pretty enjoyable the problem on /a/ everyone is as worst as /v/   People just can't seem to simply ENJOY anime. There's a thing called "slice of life," y'know.   No one on /a/ seriously hates kill la kill there just being faggot hipsters.  Same goes for stein gate, all you faggots hate things that normies like which makes you ultra faggots, because there not shit at all.     Pic related.  It's shit, to be sure, but it's really par for the course for Japanese light novels. Certainly no worse than certain others of the same genre /a/ drools over.     die    sure dude go back to reddit    I wanted action and adventure from an action/adventure anime, not romance and more incest shit    Not as amazing as people make it out to be but by no means is it bad.    As a TMfag I absolutely love this adaptation. I've been watching through it this week in preparation for the epilogue, and I think many of the complaints kind of wash away once you get the full picture.  Like the music. People complained a lot about them not having a lot of VN tracks there, but once you realize they were saving it up for the finale, it becomes a lot more understandable, and I've grown to appreciate the use of music in the prior episodes. I really like the ambient synthy kind of stuff in the early episodes. It sets a cool atmosphere.      The premise is interesting, the budget is high, and the writing goes from okay to dogshit so everyone resents it for wasting their time.    I never been on reddit. Lets be honest the hate only comes from the amount of threads kill la kill gets which I agree is annoying,    Sorry, but I already watched the post Battle City ark for Yu-Gi-Oh on FoxBox    SAO is a good example. Any other show as shit as this would simply be forgotten. The reason SAO gets so much hate is because of the popularity and influx of normies it brings with it.    Studio Trigger has way too much talent and prestige for what Kill la Kill ended up being. It ain't unwatchable bullshit, but it ain't exactly super watchable either    I really like KLK but the sheer amount of threads it had got tiring real fast.    No, SAO gets hate not only for the normalfags it supposedly brings, it gets hate because the anime was complete shit and the LN its based off of isnt even an original concept, an add the fact that its maximum wish fulfillment bullshit and you get a perfect recipe for garnering the worst kind of fanbase known to anime.    What is it about mentioning EL that causes these sudden outbursts of autism? I can understand why SAO, SNK, and Naruto get so much hate. EL is just average, no one is saying its GOAT.    Like I said, if it wasn't for the popularity and normies then it would most likely have been forgotten as a shit show, because it is really fucking bad.   Shit shows receive hate when they airing and then are usually forgotten. SAO was an exception because it kept being brought up by newfags, hence the increased amount of hate towards it.      The first season of this show had a really cool atmosphere.  It's sad that it got so bad.      Shit shows receive hate when they airing and then are usually forgotten.  This is wrong on every level because if somethings bads there is no way you will have a decent thread about it because it will be flooded by haters.     ball sack    The studio formed by the director of Panty and Stocking, famous for the non-animation in Inferno Cop and, more recently, Ninja Slayer had too much talent and prestige for Kill la Kill? Really?    Be that as it may, everything up to that point was shit.    Hyouka is one of my favourites. It's so soothing      Thinking Kill la kill is on the same level as Panty and stocking   Comparing a 5 minute short made by interns in their spare time with no budget to a 24 episode full length show  ?      check the most hated anime on /a/   watch it all   it's good   rinse &amp; repeat    check the most recommended anime on /a/   90% chance it's a trainwreck   don't even watch it anymore, more emotionally stable now            disliking a bad show is autism     A lot of things that are popular in the west are utter shit, so again, probably deserve it. Probably.    Why don't you just look for things you'd like on your own instead of relying on /a/?     All wrong.     It isn't just not perfect though, it's fucking awful, same as all fateshit that isn't prisma illya.  They don't hate it, they just don't overrate it to hell like normalfags.  Free. It seems like most people outside of the threads (which are awful by the way) just think it's gay shit, when it is actually really charming and tells a decent story        Not exactly. Gil getting stomped makes sense in the VN because Shirou doesn't give him room to breathe. But the anime wanted to have them grandstanding and zip around with flashy shit like every other anime.  At least it was well animated and pretty. That's the only fight that bothers me about the adaptation, but FUCK Nasu for being such a hack.      A gay porno might have a great plot, great art, and charming characters but I'm not going to watch it because I don't want to watch dudes getting fucked in the ass.    First arc. Shark teeth dude had a really cool story. The teacher talking about how there were kids running around the world who were stronger than him was cool. The trap's powers were interesting.  Too bad the main cast is fucking copypasted cliche retards with stupid back stories and the whole thing went to shit faster than SAO.       I HATE SPACE DANDY  said no one ever    How could anybody dislike this show?   The majority here do not. I'm not even sure why you brought it up.    But Free isn't a gay porno.    No, /a/ hates it.    No, we don't. We do hate Emi.    Yet it advertises itself with mostly-naked boys fawning over each other.    The problem with the dandy man in space was that the episodes jumped around everywhere.     fawning over each other  Being friends counts as that now? If you are uncomfortable seeing topless guys you have some issues mate     If you are trying to a defend a show that clearly panders to the female demographic and say that its not gay if you are a male. You might be retarded.    But, it was rather like them. It just had a bit more of the goofiness in season 1, and then really delved into mindfucking seriousness in S2.    It has gay moments, but most of it is fine    No we don't. We hate you.     Is that why there were regular threads without issue when it was airing?     watching something made for girls makes you gay  Wow. Care to rephrase that?     CCS is not a good example. It has canon pedophilia and homolust.    So you're saying a show made for girls isn't necessarily gay?    most of us like it. we had a decent steins;gate thread a few weeks ago when steins;gate 0 was announced.  we just pretend to hate popular shit to keep the normies out      I'm saying that its a different beast, and also the age demographics are different. Also by my original logic. CCS panders to lolicons, not fujioshi.    It's only shit on so much because it got popular with normies. Shame really. It's not great, but there are so many shittier things that have been animated.   For me, its this shit here   I´ve seen many stupid things in anime/Manga up today.  But girl with the souls of old WARSHIPS?  Since when does a huge scrap of metal, used for killing people, have a soul?  Any why the fuck are they fighting water monsters ala pacific rim? Who shat such bullshit?  Seriously. Im fine with everything.  But this shit is so super uber bullshit it hurts just to think about it.             I think you confused the purpose of this thread.    no, just pointing out that it needs more hate    That's what I'm saying. This is a thread about shows we think don't deserve the hate they get.    You might enjoy arpeggio more, it's a superior shipgirl show.   One more case of hating it because it's popular.    Slaine  God you're annoying    Hating Urobuchi stopped being cute years ago.   butthurt faggots hating on this only because the MC's a mess   While I understand that the MC is a fat tub of shit that constantly complains and whines , both the entire premise is interesting and the fights are well adapted. Completely different from SAO - They shouldn't even be grouped together in the first place.   KYH a best        Arpeggio's shipgirls? How the fuck did I miss that this whole time? I thought it was just a battle harem.    It's pretty edgy. It literally opens up with Lucy escaping the facility while murdering noncombatants by ripping off their hands. Every other scene is naked girls killing people. I also don't have much faith in the manga being any better, because the guy's other plot-based stuff (as in, not Kimi wa Midara) that I've read is equally edgy shit.        The ships have mental modules which allow them to project a physical humanoid form, however they are truly ships. One of my favorite scenes is when Iona lifts up her shirt to reveal her stomach and the submarines bow opens up.    Cou'ke a wuyrinv ixioh, pahe. Pacze hte mkozqep ij htah cou hkiex parinv a htkeax 2 ceakj awhek ih aikex.    that just nasugs butthurt MUH ORIGINAL EROGE    People don't hate on Zero, people hate on secondaries. There is a difference.     Made a quick webm of the scene.       /a/ has the shittiest taste in anime, don't ever let them convince you otherwise.     Space Dandy is an underrated masterpiece Its production values blows anything recently out of the water    Only on certain episodes, some of it is complete trash.   Coppelion, It was bad but it's not bad as /a/ makes it out to be.   Compared to other anime with 2 cours, the animation is movie tier in Space Dandy     SAO   SnK   KLK  Pretty much any show that's widely praised by normalfags. They're mediocre at best of course but they're not really as shit as some anons make it out to be       It's just VN autists that hate it, and Urobuchi cocksuckers.     normalfags  OP said /a/. Those threads go to shit almost immediately thanks to all the hate. And they should.     Not him, but I disagree. I'm one of those faggots who watched 2 before the original. Both are good, but in different ways. And both are  fun .      They have reason to in that last fight. Shirou suddenly becomes a fucking god-like swordsman just completely fucking reducing the NP that killed Berserker easily to nothing and takes down Gil, it really doesn't make sense. In the VN he actually spammed UBW to counter GoB.     It easily could.  If the nips would fucking stop using the left over shit from their vidya industry's bargain bin.       SnK and KLK are competenly made shows, even if still massively overrated, SAO is pure garbage and does deserve most if not all the hate it gets.      People just think that they were super popular as they'd only encounter the circlejerk in their threads.    Why are you here then /v/tard?    Surprising I like the MC more than the female bitch. Fucker just killed the Red King who tried to make peace with her.     when it is actually really charming and tells a decent story  This. It does the friendship part really well.     not even close  I have the unpopular opinion that you should switch SnK and SAO in your post     Literally anything gets to much hate on /a/. Instead of just discussing the things they like a lot of people here are annoyingly vocal about their dislikes. I wouldn't even say that a show getting a lot of shit here does even indicate that the general opinion about it is negative.     kek    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=TTm<wbr>zILP4wZM</wbr>  [ ]     filler  not an adaptation      kek  Fuck off.      This. I don't remember anyone really hating Space Dandy and I practically live here.      SAO is bad (writing-wise) in a passively offensive sort of way that apparently not everyone can pick up on. This is why some people have zero issues with it while some absolutely can't stand it.     Its pretty obvious Bebop is overrated, and there's no stopping people from hating overrated things.  It's still my number one favorite though   The major flaw of Space Dandy was some episodes were serious and tried to make you think. I'm not saying it's bad but it really breaks the "momentum" of Space Dandy's goofy episodes.  Also I watched Space Dandy in a fucked up chronological order. The best part was there was no continuity to make me even realize that I was watching the wrong episode. The very last episode I watched was your pic related. And ohhh boy it was really satisfying and I think that it should be the last episode. That fucking music at the end man.         Why does everyone feel the need to nitpick every single plothole in this show, and why do fatefags vehemently try to defend the bad writing?    You know, people want to be right and leave others in the wrong.    In the VN, he didn't just spam UBW, he had a face to face encounter with Gil. Like, seriously, he was fighting him up close in a sword duel constantly. There's no reason to complain about his skills if you've read the original fight.  And the explanation for Shirou's skills are perfectly clear. Shirou inherited Archer's armory from UBW, and when Shirou projects weapons, he utilizes the skill the original wielders.      It's not average, it's objectively terrible. The only thing good about it was the opening song(which they shoehorned in a million times throughout the show).     Chinese is such a terrible sounding language.     Not him but a lot of people do actually hate Zero     They have reason to in that last fight. Shirou suddenly becomes a fucking god-like swordsman just completely fucking reducing the NP that killed Berserker easily to nothing and takes down Gil, it really doesn't make sense.  Except that's literally how his projections work, he projects the skills along with the swords How the scene plays out in the anime is perfectly plausible given the established rules (in both the VN and the anime) and the only reason you have to dislike it is personal bias for whatever reason      -QUALITY -Vince beign unbearably annoying and useless fag -Pino had too less screen time -raison d'être -excuse for everything  But yeah, atmosphere was decent.        I haven't finished this yet. I have to ask though, is there another shitty sakura bondage scene?      How come people rag on Now and Then, Here and There?  Only thing I've seen criticized was the rape, but other than that, I thought it was excellent.     Last time I saw people discussing this they were just saying that it made them sad. Like how 5cm/s does it. I don't remember people hating on this.    Oops, seems my name field got weird.   People hate Dandy?      I don't think it's bad but it's incredibly overrated Also it was unnecessarily dragged out, the first half of the series is just him changing the future for stupid stuff until he realizes he fucked up the entire future, which could have been easily done in only couple of episodes and the entire anime could be around 15 eps, which would made it a lot more fast paced and interesting.      SD is just crap, why would anyone hate it? just ignore that trash anime.     incest   shit      K-ON, Nichijou, Tamako. Hyouka is different, to much love for no reason.     It's comfy. Whereas the other three are mindless fun/cute.    But the other three don't have Oreki's retarded life philosophy and Satoshi's unmainly bullshit.     people saying it's boring   Gets me everytime. It's a friggin SoL of course little will happen.       I like them all but the others are upbeat where Hyouka is calmer. Also, Oreki is no 8man.    dandy sucks... donkey dicks and all       actually defending it      left looks like something out of deviant art by comparison  plus you cannot top the fight with the tank at the end       Dumb &amp; Dumber   They don't, though it was overrated. Got a bump from the OP and ED being excellent.   a) lots of people like it b) I loved Aria but Hyouka was dull            It's a pretty great adaptation. UFO fucked up at times but at others they went above the excitement of the VN. It really does get too much hate from all sides.   There are people who like David Production's anime. There's are people who think time stop isn't stronger than King Crimson or Gold Experience Reqiem. There are still people who don't think Heaven's Door isn't the most broken stand. There are people who still skip parts or don't read in order.  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87   New JoJolion translated today/tomorrow.           That's not even what the moonrunes say.    How's this?    Whoa, David even copied the position of nearly every knife heading for Jotaro in the manga.    Fuck it!  Thanks so much, anon.      Not really, look again.

It's a shame. I'm quite interested in learning the language and the format of these threads is very appealing, but the constant air of arrogance and narcissism in these threads, which are really some of the most disgusting character features, make it really offputting. Guess I'll just have to stick to Tae Kim's guide and hope there are a few decent people here for when I have a question to ask. Sadly my skills aren't good enough to help out any other beginners yet.    Hm. Googling it some more there are definitely legitimate uses of 質問に答えが見つかる/みつからない. The main difference then would be the phrasing of the whole sentence. In the first sentence, the subject is [質問に対する答え], which is not found. In the second, the subject is just 答え, which is not found in regards to the question.     wahh why aren't people spoonfeeding me when I have a basic grammar question  Fuck off and kill yourself. The thread strikes a good balance between telling shitters to fuck off, and providing help on simple issues of nuance that are hard to find when starting out.  "Arrogance" is never a bad thing, go to Reddit if you want people to suck your dick for learning 5 whole kana in a day.       Right. I suppose the atmosphere of shitting on other people in blind hopes of someone coming up to you cupping your ballsack, licking it and muttering "wow your nipponese is so sugoi" is much better. Keep playing internet badass though. I'm sure someone out there might admire you.   Let's dance.

He really doesn't need the bandage anymore  ?    So this arc is ending very soon, what next? chunin exam?  Is team 7 the new Sannin?    why are they making sarada shit?         The thing I'm mad about is that that punch is Kishi's dumb, hamfisted way of saying that Sakura is going to be the Salad mom at the end of all this. I kinda figured it would go down that way, but I still had a sliver of hope that Pinkshit really did get ultra cucked.    next is movie, this is a lead up to it.     but I still had a sliver of hope that Pinkshit really did get ultra cucked.  That require Sasuke deliberately wanting to fuck Karin, and we both know that is impossible.  </blockquote>]
