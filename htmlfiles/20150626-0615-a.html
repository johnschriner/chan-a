Psychological pseudo-yuri thriller/horror movie/melodramatic telenovela hybrid.      give her your anus   her  Picked up.      Who the fuck drew this  I'm going kill him      Mashiro's smile is the funniest fucking face.    The same fella that drew Homunculus and Ichi the killer.   tfw you'll never destroy the virginity of an innocent schoolgirl trying enjo kosai for the first time.              mangapanda  anon pls         I've heard that this guy mainly does touhou now. Has strayed from that yet?    https://www.mangaupdates.com/author<wbr>s.html?id=8261  You must be thinking of a different guy.  </wbr>   It's finally happening. Vol. 11 is going to be released August 25, 2015.  RIKA A BEST  SEASON 3 ANNOUNCEMENT SOON?    Finally we'll be freed from this "yukimura wins" bullshit. I can't believe people actually think it'll be a permanent thing.  So Buriki is back?  Yozora is best girl.  Can Yozora still win?   Greatest Lovestory Ever Told 3 The Resurrection of the Revengence of the Electric Bogalo  I'm ready.     It's been more than two years.    I'll be happy as long as it's confirmed that Yozora won the Meatbowl.   Sena still have a chance, FAITO.. GANBAREE SENACHAN     I thought Yukimura won.     I can't wait for the massive shitposting that's going to happen when spoikers come in.  RIKKA A BEST!   I WANT TO FUCK MEAT    X GOT BTFO   UUUNNNNIIIIIIIIIVVVVEEEERRRSSSSSEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</wbr>         You do realize it's either her or Rika?  Sena's out.      In the latest chapter, yes, but it came off pretty abruptly. It was building up the Rika ship before this happened.  Sena and Yozora absolutely no chance whatsoever.      Why is Sena out? Also Rika would make most sense since they spent time getting to know each other?   RIKA will BTFO all other ships.  True love!    Still mad  Why? MC got a good end whilst bitch got a bitch end as deserved.   mangafox   He ended up with the bitch though It's all good    Yankee-chan wasn't the bitch.  Angry glasses cunt was the bitch.      Why? He got what he deserved and it works for him. He was a horrible person and wasn't worthy of the girl he liked. She chose someone that brings good vibes to all. You know, the guy that despite all the shit MC did was the FIRST to forgive him and invite others to be his friend!     got what he deserved  If I remember correctly, wasn't he entrapped by that glasses bitch into doing the actions outside of his daily activity?     mangafox    yeah but it was more personal with the girl he liked.    He ended up with the superior girl anyway.   Those that hate it are reminded of themselves.   And I fucking hate that shit, I remember when /a/ first found this shit, horrible.     mangafox    mangafox    mangafox    mangofux    Not him but I started reading it on mangafox (first result on google) then switched to batoto mid way and it's exactly the same thing.    says you    mangafox     mangafox   Still a retard.       pretending to be retarded   Please fuck off.      What ?    mangafox   It was a good ending, you knobheads.     Reading manga on a site I don't understand why is so bad, so I'll just post &gt;mangafox to fit in    mangafox       it's exactly the same thing.      being this retarded     mangafox    magnavox  Odyssey was a good console.    I know, that bitch isn't worth of afrobro    OP pls.  mangafox     OP, Mangafox is pretty bad, so  mangafox       no water mark   higher resolution   the same thing   &gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/         Telling people to go away isn't really going to make them go away.    Better than pretending they don't exist.    mangafox   You stupid idiot.     autism   Am I doing this right guys?  also  inb4 OP         Stop it, OP.    mangafox    people fully empathized with the misanthropic loser bitch boy MC and were mad when his crush got with someone who suits her and actually asked her out  Even losers should have pride and common sense. Don't be pathetic.   Sugawa ending was the best, though  I don't even remember what this was about.  MC likes whacking it Glasses finds out Blackmail ?????         mangafox   Confirmed moron.     Why didn't he end up with glasses..   She's a shit.    They're both shitty fan scanlations. I don't care where you are reading them from but if honestly think you aren't a shit eating cretin for not reading the raws with what the author actually wrote, you're a fucking disgrace and should get the fuck off my board.     both   scanlations   plural   my board <br/>                     LET'S JUST REPLY TO THE THREAD WITH ONE WORD IN GREENTEXT HELPFUL AND INFORMATIVE GOOD JOB GUYS                    Would you date her?    check out this mad fag    Serves you right for being a pleb, faggot.   mangafox       I would have sex with her  Did he ever use her as fap material in the manga?      Lurk more before posting, idiot. You deserve to have your thread shitposted.    OH BOY SUMMER SURE IS HERE xD  kill yourself     WHY DID HE CONFESSED?  WHY????????????????       mangafox any day ever     xD  How about you go first      forced drama      I think its because they seemed to have pretty good chemistry despite him being anti-social, all things considered he really wasn't that bad of guy, he just kept to himself.     is this irony?    mangafox    are you retarded?   Happy Service Club, the best thing in the world  Waiting for volume 12 and hopefully season 3    Good Irohasu, everyone!    season 3  An OVA at best.

Your favorite Cure season is now a Kamen Rider season.  What changes?    What's with the sudden quality drop in /pc/? Are we being invaded?   Nah, how about you fuck off back to tumblr, cunt.

Not human form?    Cure Davi never     I made a shitty edit.  How does this look?       shit    Well you kind of said all that needs to be said.    Kind of shitty, but still way better than the official design.    They are all boys, and the Pink is now Red. Aside from that, nothing.     riririririiriiriririri miarae got a flat chest   flat chests are all welcome here in /pc/.  It's justice, after all.       1-hour drawing incoming.  Today's theme is about one of those two girls in Futari Wa, the cute, cute, cute Kubota Shiho. Too bad not many arts was submitted though.  http://sakuramochi.mydns.jp/precure<wbr>/1draw-collections/date/2015-06-24?<wbr>lang=en http://togetter.com/li/838929?lang=<wbr>en   I actually managed to draw and color a Shiho pic in almost an hour this time. I feel so proud of myself.   </wbr> </wbr></wbr>        Go! Pri 21 when? ;_;   3 days from now?      Never, it'll be replaced by various sports.      I don't get it.          Human form fairies should get their own official Cure forms.    Posting /b/ and /v/ tier 3D shit is not magic.  Post precure in /pc/ or fuck off.     Davi is perfection!  It's been more than 10 years and Honoka is still the only Jewish precure.   Will there ever be another?      Davi will never be your mom     Rikka.     Davi will never be your dirty baby sitter.     Iona.       They do look blueish.       Now we need racist designations for all the other colors.     Davi will never be your owner      You will never make MakoP into a mother     Never mellow around a Yellow.    Wait, Haruka isn't Jewish?    Friends.     You will never meet MakoP's mother     She eats too much. She has poor grades. Has no ambition, but somehow everyone follows her.  Nozomi is American.   She enjoys tea and horseback riding. She's never satisfied with anything. She wants to lead everyone until she meets Nozomi.  Karen is English.   Always angry. Too much heat. Scared of ghosts, but not spiders. Has no job skills.  Rin is Australian.   Dunno about the Yellow or Green.                    I always imagined Akane to be Australian, despite her obvious Kansai accent. I'm not sure why.    Pent up sexual frustration and a nice ass.    I think you picked the wrong series for this exercise. They're mostly bland and poorly fleshed-out characters.    Well, she does love gorillas, so there's that. I don't know how that factors into her being remotely Australian but there you go.      obvious Kansai accent  In my head, Kansai is nip Texas. This is probably due to Abenobashi. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=M_t<wbr>MD5bTbLM</wbr>  [ ]    Pent up sexual frustration and a nice ass.  Agreed. Now match that to a racist stereotype, please.    bland and poorly fleshed-out  That's not incompatible with racism.               Osaka is nip texas   Reminder that Alice is a /k/ommando.   Haruharu is clearly Irish.      Huh. Maybe I got Osaka and Kansai confused.   F5 indeed.           Stop making me want to watch Doki    Osaka is the largest city in the Kansai region.    Are you still on that? Seriously let it go. Hide the post, hell report it, just don't go picking fights that derail the thread.     Ah! So they're the same. Thanks.     The Bad End Kingdom are now Phantoms   The Cures are all Gates who subdued their Phantoms   Candy is now the daughter of Emperor Pierott    The Bad End Precures never existed   We Kamen Wizard Precure now         And Mayo    The Yes5's being shallow is totally compatible with racism, but the bland part is a dealbreaker. It's hard to say anything truly interesting about Urara, for instance, because she's not really very descript past her ambition.  Aside from having no friends.      Yeah, stop. No one should want to watch Doki, that's just inhumane.    Not exactly the same, but when you talk about someone speaking Kansai dialect it's more likely that you're referring to the Osaka version than, say, the Kyoto version.      Sorta. Kansai is generally reserved for designating the geographic region or an accent, but you wouldn't really say someone "is Kansai" or "comes from Kansai", they'd be more likely to say what city they're from (at the limit, maybe which prefecture).      Urara also eats like crazy. She's very hard-working and focused which is why she had no friends.  I think she had another character trait, too, but it's been years and I can't remember.   Like you have a Southern accent, but you're from Virginia, not Southernia.         Though I suppose people say they're "from the South".         Minami's joined hands take the shape of an armpit.    I might have a problem .         Has volume 2 stuff been posted?   What is Minamean hiding behind her back?      Minami is so beautiful, I could just stare at her all day.          Where would i find vol 1?       those child bearing hips     The entire thing? Not a clue.     those heir-bearing hips     Them Hime hips    WHAT A FAT BUTT.      Damn clowns.    Clowns are scary.          Iona has a pretty big butt.   What will the next Precure's theme be?  I'm tired of GoPri already.      Unlovely's dress looks like another lily design.   Cannibalism.       Why is she so lovely?    But she's Unlovely.    Emergency services. Firefighters, police officers and EMTs.   A few more that's mostly color guides http://halkalabo.blog.jp/archives/4<wbr>5258014.html Same site's volume 1 stuff was http://halkalabo.blog.jp/archives/4<wbr>1776666.html</wbr> </wbr>     GoGoFive Precure   all Cures are tomboys      Chuuni Precure!    seperate cel    they draw her naked first     Anyamals.    I miss Yuuyuu    Necessary for proper tambourine use.    And all the anons who actually have died are respawned.  We're all here forever.      You wouldn't masturbate to that.    Not always.    I already am.    The lack of new episode this week has put everyone over the edge.    Yes I would.               What are these from?                  I'll never get to ravage Yuuko      In a word without spoiling the series, how would you describe HappinessCharge overall?   Great    Heartcatch-lite.    Unprincess.    Shit    Blueashit    Pedophilia    Mediocre    best    Fun    Pancakes!    Potential    Average    Cuck'd    meme'd    Where is Iona?     Inane.     Good.    People are scrambling to torrent sites to get everything they want before the eternal winter known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement sets in.    insignificant    Source?    One of the Doki magazines.    Bothersome.   I want to pose a  dumb  question.  Say through some unexplainable circumstance, you were asked to become a Cure member. Some perks would include getting a cool tuxedo for an outfit, and getting to use an element of your choice. Any one you want.  But if you do decide to join, be aware that your transformation sequence is girly as hell. The costume is not, but expect a transformation not too different from Star Driver. Also, you can only fall in love with the Pink Cure. All the others are off limits.  Even the Yellow one.   Would you do it?          Can the costume be girly as well?    Can the Pink Cure be Mana and am I allowed to mercilessly break her heart? Then hyeah.     Wanting to BE the magical girl  Oh, why not?      transformation   Star Driver  You had me at Apprivoise.     I know we're dead and you're just trying to foster conversation, but I'm getting tired of these fanfiction-tier posts.   I would do it of course, but I'm not sure how any of the pinks would react.   I think you completely misread the question.       Am I replacing a current member? Because if so let me join Heartcatch and replace Itsuki. If not let me join Yes! 5 and steal Nozomi from Coco or Suite and steal Hibiki from Kanade.   I'm looking to watch a precure series with a friend. I've already seen Yes 5, Dokidoki, Heartcatch, and Futari. Which of the others would work best to watch with along with someone else?     I always thought Smile was a fun one. It was the first one I watched, anyway.  But, if all else fails, show him Heartcatch first.        Pretty  much any. Maybe Fresh? Eas is a nice discussion point since  she'll be your first reformed villain Cure.    I want a Precure seasn where the OP and ED  is sung by JAM Project.    Smile for flashy animation and braindead SoL, Fresh for shower scenes and QUALITY.    Maybe in 10 years when the little girl market has dried up and Toei's forced to pander to otaku or let Precure die.    She badly needs to get those chest tumors removed.    Anyone know where I can buy this shit? I see a barcode and Toei's official merchandise seal on it but none of the regular sites have it.    You mean Yayoi's wet dream?    What's wrong with a girly transformation?  And some pinks are better than others, but they're rarely the worst pick of the bunch.  So yes!        What did you like so far, and what did you like about them?    What's wrong with chest tumors?    Don't worry the 15°anniversary series will be a remake of Futari Wa with all the episode being animated with movie budget and two openings from Jam Project. And most important of all  Honoka will be shown being an adorable pair with Kariya.     Disgusting and bad for their health.     Alice   wearing blue       Heartcatch would be the easiest way to get someone into the franchise, but I personally think Fresh is the best one to watch with a friend, since it's hilarious.      Ginga bishounen  Sold. Instantly.  But I'm a girl, can I still have the tuxedo and woo the pink into a /u/ end?      Fresh is the best option, I watched 2/3 of it with my brother (he normally sees Precure as something girly), and it was the best thing we have seen together. It was a hilarious ride, the QUALITY only makes ot better when seeing it with someone else.   These lovely cats know that a good jog is one of the best ways to stay healthy. And doing it with a friend won't make it seem like much of a chore as well!  I should really listen to their advice sometime.      filename   What doesn't worry Rikka? Being around Mana and friends is sure to have taken off some years from her life.      If it's Mana, it's bound to happen anyway.            /pc/ in a nutshell       fast bukki         Early Bukki is best Bukki!          Dad?    Is Mana going to do inappropriate things with that Nozomi?    The problem with episode 22 is that what they are thinking about has no place in Precure. You don't abandon your friends.    i suspect she's gonna give it back to the photogarpher     this late already  Fuck               looks like her chest is pregnant    I'd make her chest pregnant if you know what I mean.    Facehugger pls     Kaoru thinking Erika is a loli     There is literally nothing wrong with being a xeno.     Weyland-Yotsuba     The Ainomorph ought to have a smaller Ai-chan head inside her mouth.    Is there queenform?    Well, yes. It's Ace.    Is that the same artist? They sure love tambourines hitting butts.     Nope, they are 2 different artist. That one is this guy: https://twitter.com/w7kogane?lang=e<wbr>n  This one  is this guy: https://twitter.com/poni_taoyaka?la<wbr>ng=en</wbr>   </wbr>    I love Love even though sometimes she's a big dumb.     I love love love this theme! Too bad indeed. Artists need to go watch FW/MH again and remember just how great great great she is.    I'm checkin those out all right. Very nice.    Yay! Do it. The same ones even, so cat, rabbit, dog, and bat makes 4 cures. Fuwa Fuwa Precure. Make the pink a wannabe zoologist so she can be a cute nerd like Tsubomi.    Jesus, check those fucking things out. Hot damn. Gohan musume, sugoi!    Cute    She's cumming in Hime.   FOOOOORE   W..what ?   do you guys think HaruHaru has a roastie?     MUDA DA     I've always wondered how could people take such perfect shots. Did they record the whole show and then choose shots like these from the recored film later?     No, the shots are too high resolution for that. They use that option that snaps a bunch of pictures in quick succession and pick the best one.     Certain cameras can take multiple shots quickly so they just use that and pick one to upload.     Oh. Never into camera so I didn't know that.     i love her big dumbs      I want to be that cake.    Is Rabu cherry girl?   I want to marry Bukki and have many children with her.   Rabu is piichi gaaru.      That's scary    Oh god, that does NOT look good.    Is there any image of Bukki in a nun's outfit? It would be nice to see, what with her going to a  Christian academy, never mind.        Only one I could find.    We need more.       Precure one-hour draw:  http://sakuramochi.mydns.jp/precure<wbr>/1draw-collections/date/2015-06-25  The daily theme is Minamin. A kind and beautiful girl, yet lacking a strong presence compared to her teammates.  </wbr>       There can be only one Grand Princess. Who it will be?    Let's step it up a bit.    Princess Battle will show.     Yui__     Having two characters with "TWI" in their names is kicking my ass. Everytime I see a mention of Twilight in my head I see Twinkle.    the only fair option    Producer-san's current trend of Pink worship points to Haruka being Grand Princess and beating the final boss solo in the finale.    But this is ought to be unprecure season. The trends should be powerless in this case.    Scarlet's design is ugly. That being said it's probably going to be either Haruka or Towa/Twilight unless they pull a Heartcatch for us and combine all four of them into one to make the Grand Princess a la Infinity Silhouette.     lacking strong presence   but that's Kirara      Aww, look at that. Kirara and Minamin are already shoved in the background.    So Yui will come out of nowhere and take the Precure's power for herself then she'll be the one to solo the final boss becoming the Grand Princess.    Minamin is a cute girl.    Toei would die and Precure would die with it if that happened. Is that what you want?     nowhere  You missed the part where Yui gets more screen time, where she slowly develops into proper support character. She will be the first one who will Kanata see after releasing him from cage (Kanata will be captured right after Scarlett adds herself to the group) and mutualy fall in love. And after some development she will become Grand Princess.     This guy sure loves his Suites, not that I'm complaining     Her nickname is fun to say out loud. Much more so than it has any right to be.   Minamin~        Sute's school uniform was sexiest.   I was expecting they'd make the 1-hour draw about her during her birthday, but this is nice too  Why is she such a best?     Yui would've done what villains have been trying to do for the past 11 years, that would be quite the legacy.   SUTEKI U T E K I        I don't know why I just noticed, but Haruharu is actually in the woman's pose, for some reason I thought she had been in the men's pose.    Well she wants to be a princess right? You can't have a princess lead in a dance.      Why is mnmn so much more knpk than mktn?     Implying you wouldn't let Aguri, Ako or any of the Princess Precure's lead you in a dance.  You sure?      I love Minamin so much     Yes, because I would be dancing with a real princess.    You mean 'own' princess    We can't all be flaming faggots like you, anon.     So what you're saying is you want a weak and frilly princess instead of a badass one.      weak   Yuri could rip me in half if she wanted to.     How can I make this stop.   That's lewd    Why would Aguri have makeup on? Little girls don't need makeup.   Summary anon delivers  Previous thread  just 5-8% remaining of chapter 5 and epilogue.  Neorigami best girl, Phantom best mom (?).      Phantom is MILF  Shiori a shit   Reine is probably older than her.   Shiori is a shit indeed    SAMEFAG!.  Where is summary anon?      Yoshino a slut.   It's NeOrigami, you fag    But phantom is young and tight    How does Tsunako keep on drawing even more lewd things?  Just when you think she can't draw anything lewder than the last one.     Are there too many dates in DAL? I think so.   I want to marry Kotori.      marry a table    Nigga what?     There is a less dead thread guys   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127162596      Fuck you this one was first    Enjoy your report, this thread was first filthy secondary.   the summary will be posted here.   Summary anon?   Is this the real thread?   Check the out when this was posted.    This is the  genuine  thread,  yes     The other thread have more than 80 replies from the samefaggots talking to themselves, terrible way to start a DAL thread. They're just calling shitposters in.   Daily reminder this is the end girl.   True End    Reine = phantom Phantom = Shidou's mom  Reine true end = incest end.  WHAT?       The one true thread Reine will be are guiding light!   come in this thread   see cancerous posts already <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127165753   And this thread is better why?     Who said Reine is Shidou's mom? for now all what we know there is Phantom and Spirit N°2 who was imprisioned on DEM industries, besides remember Kurumi knows who is phantom and who is the spirit numer 2.    Incest=Wincest    Why she's always the only one sane and competent person on the entire LN? I mean Koroti is a piece of shit as commander, the team of Ratatorsk is shit too.  She deserves a better team like the DEM ones.       Kurumi knows who is phantom and who is the spirit numer 2.  Kurumi is the oracle     Because the faggot is asspained the other thread was better, he did the same last thread and his thread got deleted but the janitor deleted the thread with discussion for no reason.    I bet she's older than everyone, for some reason Kurumi is like a non-virgin 30 years old slut who keeps her looks using her own power.    Mods love loud retards.    Good thing the janitor works fast.  Oh and is the Material A = Mio thing was confirmed from the guy who did short summary spoilers or is it just speculation?      Kurumi is pure      Samefag OP from the other thread getting assblasted because he doesn't know how to use the catalog.   Fuck off retard, remember guys report and ignore these secondaries shitposters.       Mods encourage shitposting apparently.    It is confirmed but seems like Mana and Shidou used to play with her when they were kids.    Are you retarded? It doesn't matter which thred is the real one as long as there is discussion and this thread is filled with autism    Enjoy your ban shitposter.   Miku is worst girl    non-virgin 30 years old  Im okay with this as well as Reine and Tamae      secondaries shitposters.  This secondary and cuck shit from Oregairu is really getting annoying. This only encourage more shitposting.       Reine  She's too lazy to ride dicks so she's virgin.   Tamae  She still virgin too, actually she doesn't even know what a dick is.       Reminder that Mana is a placeholder and a plotdevice  Reminder that Mio is Shidou's and Mana's childhood friend who was captured by DEM along with Mana  Picture related, Mio and Tohka being sluts       Just ignore that and keep discussing the series, that guy did the same last thread.     Mio    Posting RIO   What?       Slut and retard     Tohka   Slut  Fuck off      No DEM has the Second spirit it is unconfirmed if second = No 2. but a bit of food for thought Shidou and Mana's true last name does have 2 hidden in it 崇 in Takamiya (崇宮) contains ニ (2). And more fun with names. The Ma used in Mana can also be read as Shin (true).     well Mana is the true Imouto    At that point, nearly everyone has 一 in their names. But for Reine and Shidou, combining the kanji in their names straight up give you　十一 and　零.    What about Mana being spirit number 2? and that's the reason why she lost her memory?    I really want to know if Tachibana is running out of ideas, seriously, everyone knows what is going to happen with phantom and shidou. I think this LN have just 3 or 4 more volumes because at this point is turning into a trainwreck.    We might get a few more then that if he dose more volumes like this instead of new spirts     running out of ideas  Hardly, he's got one big event planned, but we don't know what it is. Or at least I don't know what going to happen. With every volume, he just keeps throwing out little bits of information that we can't do anything with. I just want to know what's really going on between Shidou, Phantom, Westcott and Woodman, but we usually only get a chapter dedicated to plot.     Meh I doubt it    do you think there will be more spirits then the ones on the tree of life like Rinne and Mayuri?

Almost everything Tachibana does that pertains to the plot is planned and isn't actually just pulled out from his ass. He just puts it out very, very slowly. I blame harem antics.     Nope.      More spirits   Why? we already have all what we want in terms of spirits and Rinne/ Mayuri are just cannon shit.  PIC RELATED       Hi all  Kaguya a Cutie     I get your point but wishful thinking    If he introduced more spirits without somehow working with the theme, then DAL would be kind of a wreck. But I doubt that'll happen.   How do Zerofags exist? I don't get it. It boggles the mind. Every fight in Zero feels like something from Naruto (He caught his sword and used it to deflect the other one!), and the plot is like a less mature version of Fate but with Heaven's Feel for an ending. This is ignoring that Zero is full of shitty CGI.  Even after Ufotable decided to remake UBW into the same sort of adaptation as Fate/Zero, Zerofags manage to actually bitch about UBW and how it isn't as "smart" or "mature" as their shitty spinoff.     Ubw is inferior to zero, just accept it.     CGI   that thing where everyone explains the fight instead of letting it happen   chuuni as fuck characters that don't get punished for being chuuni   JETS         Every fight in Zero feels like something from Naruto (He caught his sword and used it to deflect the other one!)  Just like F/SN     The main difference that in F/SN the fights had weight to them. There isn't a single fight in Fate/Zero that could even be put in the same category as Shirou v. Gilgamesh, or Shirou v. Berserker, or Gilgamesh v. Berserker.     EMIYA ALLY OF JUSTICE TORTURED BY HIS FATE   not more chuuni than anything in F/Z   Get over it, faggot. UBW pales in comparison. F/Z actually made proper use of the world Nasu built by using masters from all over the world, whereas UBW has FOUR fucking masters from the same high school. I mean, fucking seriously?        How do zerofags exist   muh porn novel is original   it has deep plot and character!  actually :  boring battle   same fighting place   not enough focus on other master beside rin and shirou            expecting the Association, the Church, and just about everything else to get shit done in 10 years    Nasu tends to make all his characters break the rules for the sake of the plot, mostly in UBW. Zero actually felt like a Holy Grail War, with more clever, thought out actions. The servants felt more like their mythological counterparts, and not distorted as fuck as Nasu did to the servants in the 5th HGW. The entirety of UBW was Shirou fanwanking, using plot armor and asspulls to try to show how "deep" of a character Shirou is.       &gt;not more chuuni than anything in F/Z  Yeah, and then he gets his shit kicked in for it. What are you trying to say here?    hurr durr porn can't have a good story  Pic related americunt         Because the protagonist is not an "avarage" highschool boy who beats servants with ease. Mainly because it focuses on every team and not just kiritsugu.     implying any of that matters   It's fucking boring and pandering, m8. Nasu's universe was too interesting of a setting for his writing abilities at the time of Fate/Stay Night.  This whole shit would be a million times better if he had started writing it now as a LN instead of an eroge that needs to justify how four fucking high schoolers are in the world's greatest mage battle.  F/Z actually felt like a real Grail War. UBW did not.    gets his shit kicked in   saves the day like three times   says goodbye to Rin and redeems himself   Did you think a Servant could stay in the world? He left because he ran out of mana, not because he got killed by anyone.                  Shitty CGI  Lancelot CGI was to portray FSG.      hurr durr muh epic fight scenes   Kill yourself, assburger.      Yeah, and it looked terrible.  Ninja Slayer uses CGI for comedic effect, but it still looks terrible.       Gilgamesh v berserker   had weight  you mean berserker took all weight       plays baseball with Tohsaka in the middle of the Holy Grail War   has a picnic   comes home   holy shit, Caster took Fuji-nee hostage!        F/SN is more chuuni and edgy than F/Z, kill yourself you memeing faggot.     4th Holy Grail War   everyone's buddy-buddy   nobody takes that shit seriously EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE ADULTS         Because the Fourth Heaven's Feel is actually the ONLY proper Heaven's Feel.  3rd one had Angra Mainyu 5th one had Destroyed grail 1st and 2nd one had broken class systems. 4th had enough preparation and proper placements          everyone's buddy-buddy  oh shit he went full retard     F/Z had actual mage battles requiring strategic choices on the part of masters.  Let's compare:   Shirou v Gilgamesh  DA BOAN OF MAH SWOAD WE R JUSS FAEKS  Saber v Lancer  Saber was at a disadvantage because of a miscalculation so Kiritsugu dicks his way into sabotaging Lancer by cutting a deal with his master. Realistic mage situation. Not to mention this fight is preceded by three different encounters between the two master/servants that build up into this final moment. Each encounter adding another layer to the confrontation.   One is chuuni power level shit, the other resembles what a real mage battle would entail.   Gilgamesh v. Berserker  Jobbing, the battle.  Gilgamesh v. Iskandar  More jobbing, for the same effect.   Shirou v. Berserker  Didn't even happen in the anime. Irrelevant to compare. But it's more Shirou fanwank.   It's pretty stupid to make a cool idea like Heaven's Feel, and only have it done properly once.                        AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA   forgetting Tohsaka and Priest   forgetting Waver and Kerry        thanks for confirming your retardness     It's pretty stupid to make a cool idea like Heaven's Feel, and only have it done properly once.   That's how they managed. First three were just the three great families finding loopholes in the Grail war's rules (and failing horribly)    fucking noobs          Tohsaka and Priest  What? Remind when Tohsaka and the priest went out for a night on the town.   Waver and Kerry  Did they play baseball at some point? I don't even remember Waver interacting with Kiritsugu.        I started watching the Fate Series around March probably. I initially watched UBW S01 and finished it just in time for the start of UBW S02. I got pretty bored with the first episodes, so I decided to watch Zero while UBW S02 was airing.  Well, there's absolutely no contest. Zero had better masters, better servants and an overall better story. Also, all fights seem believable, while in UBW Emiya goes from Crilin to Goku level in a couple of episodes.     I mean story-wise. There's a lot of room for really great character conflict and world building to be expanded on with Heaven's Feel. But we get SoL and jobbing instead.     Is it that hard to get the point the date scene was trying to get across?      implying  https://<span>youtu.be/ogNZtIAeDmM  [ ]     It's usually because people like  happen.     Tohsaka and priest   buddy buddy   backstabbed    rin and shirou   i-i'll kill you shirou if you dont bring saber with you   now who is more buddy buddy later            watching the anime  Opinion discarded.     He was comparing anime adaptations. I doubt he read the Zero LN. Zero anime &gt; UBW anime.     No, the Zero anime is uglier, and still full of the same retarded shit that was in the UBW anime.     he doesnt like saber get bullying     There shouldn't be a fucking date scene in the middle of a fucking Grail War. Do you remember Hitler going bowling with Churchill during WW2? A grail war is a retarded circumstance for teenagers to find love.    That scene alone is better than anything in UBW.    Saber bullying is a miracle of the universe.     saber trashing   buddy buddy      Is it that hard to understand that having a date in the middle of a war is retarded no matter what point you're trying to give to it?     No, the Zero anime is uglier     Exactly. There weren't any retarded date scenes in Fate/Zero, especially not with expensive wine and Grail talk.     He doesn't like saber being bullied.      conveniently using the one shot in the series that wasn't full of CG     UBW had CG too, m8.    Except it isn't, this thread already blew you the fuck out. Stay mad.  Enjoy your play dates during the most intense mage ritual. Oh, let's not forget servants need cum to regenerate mana, fucking kek.   Sorry, did you just compare a mage and Servant discussing the nature of the Grail and humanity to a picnic where a tsundere goes "G-geez, MC-kun"? In your mind, is a college lecture the same as talking about the latest avenger film?          saber trashing   not buddy-buddy  That shit happened in all three VN routes, including the one where Shirou fucks her.       same retarded shit  the place any battle in UBW took place : - school - temple - church - einzbern mansion boring shit over and over          No, I compared a scene where three Servants sitting around drinking and a tsundere goes "g-geez Gil-kun!" to a picnic where a tsundere goes "g-geez MC-kun!"     the world's greatest mage battle   Read the fucking VN.       less mature version of Fate   Fag detected. Calling your waifu simulator "mature" is laughable. Stop being obsessed butthurted about your "mature" waifu games.     Reminder Kiritsugu is so childish that he honestly thought that his ideals could become reality if he managed to get a magical cup, and was willing to put his wife in danger to do it.   Do you want me to pull up the dialogue so we can compare the content of the two?   Gil and Kotomine talked about what it means to desire something, Gil's philosophy on what life entails, the nature of the Grail, and Kotomine's lack of identity.  Rin, Saber, and Shirou talked about how Rin is really scary when she was batting and how much fun they had.  Good job, faggot. You're grasping at straws for like the fifth time this thread.           grimdark is mature   the removal of adult themes makes a story more mature   &gt;&gt;/MAL/       Everyone thought that. That's why all of the servants even bother fighting.     Gil and Kotomine  Retard detected, at least read my post before you respond. Here, I'll just post it again.   No, I compared a scene where three Servants sitting around drinking and a tsundere goes "g-geez Gil-kun!" to a picnic where a tsundere goes "g-geez MC-kun!"        I don't want to read an eroge where getting cummed inside replenishes mana.    Rin and Shirou talked about what it means to desire something. The nature of Emiya, and Emiya's lack of identity.    Yeah, and that doesn't make it any less childish. That's why the 4th HGW is the worst of them all, they're all fighting for the dumbest fucking purpose in existance. In the 5th, everyone who isn't Shinji or Saber has a different purpose for fighting in the war. Nobody desires the grail because it's a stupid thing to bet everything on.    Oh, so when three kings discussed what being a ruler means, each of their approaches to it, and why Saber failed at saving Britain and Lancelot?  Yes, that's exactly like Rin is so kowai! Wow, we had so much fun.      how the fuck you compare Rider and GIl talk completely destroy Saber Ideal. to "we have free time lets play baseball, oh crap caster ambush us"    Then play Realta Nua you subhuman mongrel.     not even RN/10     Yes, fighting to make Saber your wife, destroy the world, because your family told you to is a lot better than fighting to make a girl your wife, save the world, and because your family told you to.   At the picnic? No, they did not. The only time that's explored is in the bedroom and during fights.       I probably will play all of them at some point, but this thread is about the anime, m8.    The bus scene.     fighting to make Saber your wife  He has everything else, thus he wants Saber. He has no other desires that conflict with it, thus it makes sense for him to relentlessly pursue it when she's actually summoned.   destroy the world  For reasons properly explained in every work he's ever appeared in. He despises the world as it is, and only want the ones who stand out to serve him as they did during his lifetime.   because your family told you   Okay who the fuck are you talking about now, because regardless of who there is no way this isn't a massive oversimplification.              holy fk      more edgy than F/Z  F/Z was nothing but muh edge. Constant sacrifices and needless killing for the sake of making things dark.    Leaving aside the usual "Muh Zero is better" or "Muh VN is better" shit flinging from the rabid monkeys, at least one thing that's objectively true is that the Kerry vs Kirei fight is the emblem of good fighting in anime.  No shitty monologuing. No cringe-worthy dialogue about ideals that would be considered childish on a four year old (Hurr durr seigi no mikata) No explaining what each move does and just fucking using it No delaying using the most powerful moves because of muh pacing  Kerry vs Kirei felt like an actual fight between two people who want to kill eachother. They don't talk. They don't explain. They fight. They use right away every move they have, they don't withold anything, they just go until someone is dead.  Anime fighting is one of the worst thing in the medium, and Zero managed to do it right. Too bad nobody followed on it and we still have shitty saturday morning shonen-tier fighting even in mature series.             Ilya heart rip isn't edge   Ilya eye cut and bleeding out isn't edge   Sakura worm raped from child to teen isn't edge   Sakura getting raped by Shinji everyday isn't edge   BloodFort melting everyone into a perpetual pool of sludge isn't edge   Caster torturing Saber isn't edge   Kotomine orphans being living skeletons isn't edge    Consider killing yourself retard.              to make someone your wife  Because he's seen her suffer and tear apart her own family because of her mage husband. He wants to help her, which is itself a delusion. It turns out that all he did was make her suffer more, so he goes crazy.   to save the world  He despises the world as it is, and loves humanity. He wants to save everyone from despair so they don't have to make the choices he did.   for the family  Tohsaka in F/Z is only fighting because family duty to magic, because Root. Illya is only there because she was made to fight in the Grail War, for Root. She has a personal motivation to meet her onii-chan though, but I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt that you don't think that's actually better than wanting to advance magic research.           What episode so I can rewatch    Shinji wanting to rape Rin as well as Ilya telling Berserker to rape Saber and Rin as well as wanting to torture Shirou by keeping him alive is way more edgy than anything found in Zero    THIS. no fight in fsn better than this. they always talk talk talk. and resolved dumbly   At least it doesn't have asspulls and John Cena'ing like Shit/Night.  All of Shit/Night is just Shitber and Shitrou John Cena'ing through every obstacle.      He hasn't read HF      Ilya telling Berserker to rape Saber and Rin    Is there a doujin for this?       You can't see me, my time is now     Season 1 finale    12? 13?   Last ep of S1. Immediately after date scene.      But there was explanation that Kirei's using command seals, and that contender is a terrible fucking gun with only one ammo capacity.     Origin Bullet on Kayneth   fucking everything about Team Caster    Kayneth's death   Deermuds death   Kiritsugu's backstory   Kotomine's entire development   Kiritsugu killing his wife and children inside Angra    Kariya's motive   Kariya's death    Lancelot's dumbass shoehorned last fight  Everything but Team Rider was fucking filled with edge during Fate/Zero, the shit in Fate/stay night doesn't even come close.              I'd pay to see that shit nigguh.    This    Caliburn killing Herakles was the only thing that went unexplained, and a constant stream of energy killing off multiple lives sure as hell makes more sense than Iskandar summoning his army several kms away from Gilgamesh so he can get destroyed even harder.    Not that guy, but you can't call every fucking fight or death edgy.   Kariya's motive  sure he's a faggot, but let's not call the motive edgy.     what's with /a/'s autism over edge?  does any attempt on being serious/dark automatically qualify as edge?     I have. A VN has inner monologue and narration, so it can't be compared. Plus, you can just flip past the endless monologuing since you can just go ahead every time you're done reading, instead of enduring endless budget-saving camera pans every time someone is doing that in anime. What I'm saying is that as far as anime goes, no one ever fights right.   Are you saying that's even comparable to the amount of monologuing and explaining in a typical anime fight? Even the explaination about Kirei was brief, and felt more like the actual character trying to find the next course of action. It was dynamic.  On the other hand, the typical anime fight will have a fucking 5 minute dissertation on what's being observed, even when it's incredibly obvious.          The only deaths that didn't have some sort of edgy and dark scene for it was Iskandar and surprisingly Team Caster.    Just wait and see when they watch  Gakkou gurashi      chuuni as fuck characters that don't get punished for being chuuni      Deermud's death   Seriously? Did you even play the VN? Lancer's death in UBW is way more edgier with the way he ended up.   Kayneth's death   How's Taiga begging for Shinji's help while melting just to get a kick in the head less edge?    Kiritsugu's backstory   Sakura's backstory.   Kotomine   that's from F/SN you retarded secondary.   Origin bullet   Caster's torture.   Lancelot's fight   literally your retarded opinion.  reminder that retarded secondary will think pic related is less edge than Zero.                             It doesn't even matter if it's "unexplained" because Nasu's "explanations" are always retarded shit that you're supposed to swallow just because he tells you to   HURR SHE DODGED GAE BOLG BECAUSE LUCK XD   But of course Shit/Babbies eat that shit up because they're fucking retarded and actually believe it makes the fights "intricate" or some shit like that when it's really just the usual bullshit  Especially UBW is chock full of shonenshit like Shirou getting powerlevels forced down his throat "lol he actively gits gud by fighting archer"          Not at all; see  Berserk   mabu rabu   Evangelion   Legend of the Galactic Homos         Anything that isn't serious is moeshit/retarded/otaku-pandering  Anything that is serious is pretentious/edgy/overrated       Seriously? Did you even play the VN? Lancer's death in UBW is way more edgier with the way he ended up.   lancer's death   edgy  nah he went out a hero again Lancer is best servant         using the Gae Bolg example  God you're fucking retarded. Gae Bolg is a surekill, therefor divine favors in the form of luck is the only thing that makes it possible to avoid. The fact that you can't understand something so simple means you're probably incapable of reading.      Lancer's death in UBW   edgy  Nigga the way he died was like an 80s action movie hero  Don't worry, it's just a flesh wound  Man was a goddamn hero.         For some reason, it's not on my computer. Downloading right now.     I dunno, I would think "I'm bleeding out, and this is the prettiest and the kuuuuuruest thing ever" is pretty edgy   The only deaths that didn't have some sort of edgy and dark scene for it was Iskandar and surprisingly Team Caster.  Death is a dark event anon. No one really enjoys death,       Thanks for proving exactly what I was saying, Shit/Babby.     Gae Bolg is a surekill  Well, it obviously isn't and shouldn't have been intrduced as such if it is actually avoidable.      edge  So something being dark automatically means it's edgy? Give me a fucking break and try harder you stupid /v/ermin piece of shit. M.D. Geist is edgy. A Serbian Film is edgy. Elfen Lied is edgy. That webm of that anime where this girl steps and brutally kills a puppy is edgy.  Tragedy does not equal edgy, and I know you have very limited vocab, being a mouth-breathing crossboarder and all that, but try to make your points without meaningless buzzwords from other boards.       Lancer's death in UBW is way more edgier with the way he ended up.  Are you fucking serious? Lancer's death was fucking glorious and 100% heroic, there was nothing edgy about that. Deermud was literally all-out edge, nothing but suffering and killing for the remainder of the entire scene.    Taiga getting kicked  Really? She didn't even fucking die to that, it was just Shinji being an asshole and it didn't even result in anything dark. He got promptly fucked by it without problem.   Sakura's backstory.  True.   that's from F/SN  I was talking about his development you retard, not him as a character. The process of him growing to have his Fate/stay night motive was more dark and gritty than him actually having it in Fate/stay night.    Caster's torture.  Caster's torture was nowhere near as grating as the Origin Bullet crippling Kayneth.   literally your retarded opinion.  Oh yeah sure. Lets pretend that shoehorning Lancelot in a position like that for the sake of forcing last-minute despair into Saber is somehow not forced edge. It's there for that purpose alone.                    Do you think old people who talk about seeing Jesus when they're dying in the hospital is edgy? What the fuck?  /a/ has really twisted that word to the point where it's lost all meaning. It's just "serious thing I don't like" now.    This skill guarantees that you hit the target every time.   So it effects probability?   What? No! You can still luck out.            It isn't avoidable through human feats, the gods have to intervene in order for it not to kill. Treating it as anything but a surekill move when you need divine favors to make it out of there alive is just ridiculous.    Not him, but:   it didn't result in death, therefore it isn't edgy   a character feeling despair is edgy   It's pointless. You don't know what edgy means.          gods have to intervene  As we all know, Gods interacting with mythological characters is unlikely...      Help I don't know how Zero came to be!   Read HF and then realize that Kotomine's character has always been like that was decided before Zero was even out, fucktard.   Taiga wasn't dark  Yes, getting melted into a pool of flesh and then getting kicked around isn't edge, but Kayneth getting his magic circuits destroyed and then getting shot is edge. Right.   Caster's torture  Saber is just strong enough to not show how bad it was. But apparently torture isn't edge and the bullet is.    Still didn't refute the image I posted.  Read the VN before spouting your retarded UBW anime only opinion, cancerous secondary.                it didn't result in death, therefore it isn't edgy  How is it edgy if a hero comes in to save the day before anything bad can continue? You're comparing absolute despair and betrayal to a guy kicking a girl before getting his shit kicked in for doing so. Claiming stay night is anywhere near as pointlessly dark as Zero is just wrong.      divine favors   It's called plot armor.  Nasu decides the target shouldn't die so it doesn't. If it was fired at Gilgamesh, of fucking course it would hit because Nasu wants it to. Even though he has the same luck rank as Saber.   BUT BUT BUT HURRRRRR   Eat shit.             It's like a tiny deus ex machina    Ufobabbies and VNbabbies taking the piss out of each other over whose shit smells better  I came here to laugh at you    This is for you, feel free to save that.    So if we had 20 hours dedicated to Illya getting tortured by Gilgamesh before Shirou magically bursts in to save the day, it wouldn't be edgy? If Ufotable animated 20 minutes of Sakura getting raped on-screen, but then Shinji gets killed, it isn't edgy?  Fucking retard.       Zero is more edgier than this  People will actually think this     Why is she so adorable?     Winter Forest is edgy  No, over the line, fuck you      Kotomine's character has always been like that  The acts and the way his development progressed was more edgy than anything. Not only that, but in hollow ataraxia we actually get to see him somewhat mellow out so in stay night his mindset isn't even as set on being dark and he just wants to finish up his goal.    getting melted into a pool of flesh and then getting kicked around  She didn't melt entirely and ended up being saved pretty fucking quickly afterwards. It was only there to demonstrate Shinji being a dick and getting punished for it.   Saber is just strong enough to not show how bad it was  So you're making assumptions based on nothing. The torture was definitely painful, but it wasn't a gory process meant to appeal to edgefags.   hurr durr better call him a secondary despite defending the number 1 source of secondaries  Yeah, the image you posted is edge but virtually everything in Zero was so what you're trying to imply is wrong. Stay night did have dark and edgy moments, but they weren't nearly as frequent nor as much the focus as it was in Zero.               If you guys are referring to the 20 second exchange on the bus before running into caster with Taiga, then what on fucking earth are you smoking?   You didn't enjoy the date?!   Well..   Loosen up, dude. Whatever happened isn't that bad. You'd be happier if you got over it.   to    I don't know why I've never desired something.   Maybe you don't understand what desire is.   What is it to you?   detailed explanation involving man's nature   Watching 13 now to make sure this isn't what you're referring to.                   It's called plot armor.  So you have no argument. They explain it outright and it makes complete sense, but of course it's plotarmor despite that because you're incapable of reading.   If it was fired at Gilgamesh, of fucking course it would hit  Except again you're wrong. He fought Gilgamesh for 12 hours during Fate, and he didn't win. If Gilgamesh Luck level had been lower, then he would most likely have, but due to it being that high it wasn't enough.       Why would you even use edgy as criticism? Is there anything that suggests that edgy things are inherently bad or are some people just afraid of being associated with a stereotypical view of a certain kind of teenager on an anonymous image board?     Citing F/HA  Might as well kill yourself right now   She is in pain but she isn't throwing up and shit so it isn't edgy!  Really?    Someone recovered from it so it isn't edgy!  I guess since Kayneth ended up in a wheelchair the origin bullet scene wasn't bad amirite?  F/SN is just as edgy if not more so than Zero.  to think otherwise proves you are a secondary.               Is there anything that suggests that edgy things are inherently bad   It literally means "serious done wrong" to most people.      In the darkness as thick as blood, only one solitary candle flicked. The dim candlelight reflected Uryū Ryūnosuke's handsome face. In front of the man, three rows of raw meat that reflected bright red were placed.   They were intestines. On the long table were human intestines.   Ryūnosuke stared intently at the intestines in front of him, then picked up a tuning fork with his left hand and hit it on the edge of the table   Before the clear sound of the tuning completely disappeared, he quickly poked everywhere on the intestines with his right hand.   Ahhh...   Haaa...   A seemingly agonizing sound suddenly came out of the darkness.   Ryūnosuke listened carefully to the sound emitted, and nodded satisfactorily after he compared it with the residue echo of the tuning fork.   "Very good, so here it's ‘mi'."   As he spoke, he marked a point on the intestines with a pin. The intestines seemed to be still alive. To be correct, it seems the owner of the intestines was still alive.   On the crucifix on top of the long table, a girl who was sobbing incessantly with pain was tied up. A horizontal cut was made on her abdomen, and the innards that were dragged out were being fondled with in Ryūnosuke's hand.   To make the girl picked as the material not die from massive blood loss or infections, Bluebeard placed a few healing and rejuvenation spells on her body, and specially made some adjustments to prevent the pain from numbing her brain.   "Very good, so one more time. 'Do re mi~'"                  This attack will always hit, no matter what.   Unless a god gives you extra luck   Something that bends probability losing to probability doesn't make logical sense, but Nasu a hack anyway.   Not him, by the way. I just hate Nasu's writing, while I love his world building.           ignoring canon sources   while calling anyone else a secondary  It was in a flashback so it was before the events of Fate/stay night.   she isn't throwing up and shit so it isn't edgy!  You know if you're grasping as far as to pretend that Kayneth getting shot with the Origin bullet was somehow less edgy than Taiga getting kicked and then saved then I don't know what to tell you.  Kayneth ended up in a wheelchair during different circumstances. His dreams had practically been pulled from him due to that encounter and his chances of winning reduced to almost nothing.           Gae Bolg doesn't bend probability, it reverses cause and effect.    See     Fits right at home with Blue Beard's story. He tortured children.    That's even worse. If it reverses cause and effect, why wouldn't it be able to reverse the effect of a divine favor?        Nasu himself said to not take F/HA seriously  But nope gotta grasp straws!   Kayneth's dream getting crushed  IF we're going there, you can use that argument for literally everyone.        Because the favor of god is practically the same as the favor of reality itself. It was never a weapon designed to kill divine beings, simply the weapon of a knight.    We're not talking about killing divine beings, we're talking about reversing cause and effect.  If it reverses cause and effect, bending reality IS it's business as that is literally a fundamental aspect of reality.      Team COOOOL are just a pair of lunatics torturing a helpless little girl Ilyasveil is targeting a potential Master and while she's seriously disturbed we're at least given a justification as to why   In the sense of "when Gae Bolg is activated, the result will always be that the target is struck" Whatever happens in between is left up to fate          citing a dead end as edgy  eric     It's very clear he said that because of the lighter elements to it rather than seeing it as a direct sequel to any of the routes. Difference is, these events happened to Bazett before she died, so there's no way they're not canon because it doesn't conflict with anything. There is no statement claiming that everything in hollow ataraxia. All that statement means is that stay night is prioritized over it in terms of which word is considered the most important when actual conflicts in dialogue appear. If anything you're the one grasping at straws denying a work which is explicitly meant to expand upon the Nasuverse.   you can use that argument for literally everyone  Yeah, but it would be that argument alone without the process of it being needlessly dark and gritty.       FSNfags trying to shit on Zero    Seriously why? I don't get it. Trying to pretend its completely different from Stay Night is laughable, and trying to pretend the anime versions are vastly different is even more laughable.  Are you THAT asspained that maybe some people got intro'd through Zero anime? There's just as many people starting fate from UBWs anime now who didn't even watch Zero. Its the same shit.       Being justified doesn't make it less edgy, she wanted to use torture tools while keeping Shirou alive, it's no different than Ryuunosuke acting like a pyschopath    My point was that gods are outside the realm of something which mortals can affect without a divine or demonic force made to combat it. When Gae Bolg would strike a divine being or a being with divine favors, then it's directly trying to bypass something which has the ability to outright remove it from existance if the favor is high enough.  The Gods in the Nasuverse will always be prioritized higher in anything.      The only argument you have for Kayneth is that it was an attack that destroyed his dreams and left him in a wheelchair.  There are dozens of other characters in this setting with worse fates. It's retarded to bring this up alongside someone like Caster's Master who watches the only thing in his life that had meaning die to then die pathetically against a Servant.      Since when?    Since /a/ decided they were the ones in charge of language    For me, it has always meant senselessly grimdark for shock value.   HF &gt; Zero &gt; shit &gt; Fate &gt; UBW    World's greatest mage battle.   a dubious, broken system using a leylines from a washed-up town in the far East.    Not a single big name in Nasuverse cared about it.   greatest.  Whatever you say, m8.        You realize Nasu oversaw Zero and agreed that Kotomine will act like that. He enjoys watching humanity suffers, this is echoed in all three routes, Zero only showed it in action   dark and gritty  And Shinji turning to a meatmound isn't dark and gritty? Or Ilya? Or Soichiro and Caster? Plenty of master and servants lost and suffered.       It left him in a wheelchair and set up the future events. It's a dark outcome with a dark process that proceeded to even darker events. There was nothing positive, no ray of hope like Shirou saving Taiga, nothing.  Also Kuzuki didn't even comprehend his own feelings, that's why he was completely empty by the time she dies. It was his only purpose left, but it was nothing which he necessarily considered to have meaning.       she wanted to use torture tools while keeping Shirou alive  Ilya's goal was to capture Shirou and transfer his soul into a doll or some other container. She wants to do this because she's using Shirou as a proxy for Kiritsugu, in terms of both revenge for abandoning her and having someone with her who will never leave her alone again. Ryunosuke and Giles tore out a little girl's intestines for the purpose of listening to her scream. That's it.      I'm not arguing that it's not how he would act during the events of Zero, but by the time stay night hits he's become different and matured beyond minor pleasures due to having experienced loss and everything else.   Shinji still ended up being saved. That's the thing, shit in Zero never goes right. When someone does something dark, there is never any form of salvation, that's the complete opposite of how almost all events in stay night are.      Is there a ray of hope in Kuzuki's story? No. It was a dark outcome with a dark process that gave you a definite dark ending. No ray of hope like Assassin saving him, nothing.  He watched his only purpose die, became an empty shell, and died pathetically at the hands of his supposed ally.       That's the thing, shit in Zero never goes right.   What is Waver?      Yeah, but what's so bad about something being a little dark or having shock value if it's entertaining?     Do you think old people who talk about seeing Jesus when they're dying in the hospital is edgy? What the fuck?  What are you babbling on about? When did I say anything like that?     Kuzuki never had any real emotions to begin with. He spent his entire life being emotionless with only once instance in his life where he actually expected to feel something, and that was way past. It's not a dark ending, it's an empty ending if anything. He never had any desire to live anyway, he just lived on for teh sake of it. Caster wasn't a purpose for him in stay night, and it would take him longer than that to actually grow to doubt himself or even feel anything concerning it.    I already said in a previous post that Team Rider was the only ones who actually had a brighter story.        trapping someone's soul in a container so you can keep them hostage forever against their will because your parents abandoned you is not edgy   Okay, m8.   I can enjoy some bits of shock value if they're properly timed, but certain things abuse it and make it the only appeal. Dark themes/events are not inherently edgy.     "I'm bleeding out, and this is the prettiest and the kuuuuuruest thing ever" is pretty edgy     A character with no emotions whose whole life is empty and has no desire to live, dying without purpose is not edgy   Holy fuck.                 When it tries to hard. Devilman is edgy as fuck but on a whole it's pretty great.     I already said in a previous post that Team Rider was the only ones who actually had a brighter story.   Which is a feat in an of itself. Not only for any grail war, but for one that had to set up the FSN one, which required people to die in order for the protags to not have the full story of the grail.  The two wars don't have the same purpose. The 4th had to be the bad end to set up the 5th having a better one, and they STILL managed to give someone a positive ending in Zero.        So in summary  Edgy: things I don't like   Not Edgy: things I like       Not in that particular end.     became an empty shell   became  He started out as one, and he died as one.       the route where all the characters give up is the best  Fuck off edgefag     How is it edgy? He has no purpose, and he overcame his purpose to die in his past. After that, his death was just another event rather than his purpose. There was nothing dark about his story.     it's a bad end so it's alright if it's edgy  The same VN showed it's possible to make a dead end without edginess, like the one where Shirou forgets about the Holy Grail.   Perfect taste.        I'm not pretending Zero is a bad story or anything, I'm saying that claiming Zero was anything but darker than stay night is just an outright lie. The guy I'm arguing with is implying the complete opposite when in stay night, there are few who don't find some form of salvation.     Fuck off edgefag  No, I'm just a fan of older Nasu. Tsukihime, KnK  movies , and Heaven's Feel were all better than Fate and UBW.      That's exactly what anon has been doing throughout this thread.  I don't know how you can think someone being crippled by Origin Bullet is edgy, but Shirou's soul being trapped inside a doll for Illya to play out her deluded fantasy is not.    nothing dark about someone without purpose who doesn't care about death or life and marches to death willingly           nothing but edgeshit first     That's my point. Edgy doesn't inherently mean something is bad yet it's used like that here. I wouldn't be ashamed to admit that I enjoyed Fate/Zero for its edginess.      HF&gt;UBW  Aside from that you're right. I liked Tsukihime more than fate.      I'm saying that claiming Zero was anything but darker than stay night is just an outright lie    Thats its purpose you moron. And even then its not that much darker. Its a prequel that came out after to explain how things got to where they were in FSN. Kirei and Gil have to walk away, thats already built in. So in that sense of course its darker.  But its not like FSN is really any better. Its only because Shirou gets to walk away instead of the antagonist. Illya and the like still get fucked no matter what.          UBW &gt; HF  disdain_for_plebs.jpg     UBW was more enjoyable than any of those. Seeing Shirou following his ideals in the face of everything going on was the best. It's the only route where I actually felt like I was making the right choices for someone trying to become a hero.     liking MC fanwanking over actual stories  Of course.     You realize Shinji only found salvation in UBW right? And that only happened because it was to cement Shirou's ideology of saving everyone. Ilya dies in every route even the one where she had the most development, she didn't find salvation at all. Kauzki found nothing either and neither did Caster whose death can be considered edgy by your standards.  Whereas Zero &gt; Kiritsugu found salvation in Shirou and Waver became successful, compare that to the constant of success found in Stay night, Rin and Shirou, the numbers are the same.       He properly said Tsukihime &gt; Fate, so its okay.      Thats its purpose you moron  I never claimed otherwise, I still like Zero somewhat. The main difference I find between stay night and Zero is that even if characters die in one route, then they generally find some form of happiness in another. Illya didn't get fucked in every route. She got nice development and even the way she went out in HF wasn't dark in any way from her perspective, since she was happy for what she accomplished with it.     They have 3 fucking routes to get a good ending, no shit.  Zero is one story and you already know how it ends. Kariya can't save Sakura, Tokiyomi will die and Kerry will fuck up but save Shirou. But even then you got Waver coming out of it better.      I can't like HF The idea that shirou throws away his beliefs entirely for some stupid bitch is retarded. Especially after UBW where he refused to back down. Not to mention Sakura is jealous unlikable cunt. H/A actually made me dislike her more somehow when it had the opposite effect for every other character even shinji.       (You)   &gt;"I'm bleeding out, and this is the prettiest and the kuuuuuruest thing ever" is pretty edgy   Are you honestly comparing seeing Jesus on deathbed to "I like the color of my own blood?" Are you fucking insane?       He found simple happiness in Sakura and Ilya. He doesn't need to strive to be a hero anymore if he is happy already.    It wasn't MC fanwanking, it was just him actually following his ideals. In Fate, they practically skimmed over that part entirely for the sake of showing more of Saber. In HF, he gives them up without caring for the idea of the act of following the ideal itself being beautiful. The story of UBW is the story of Shirou. It wasn't dark because the MC was steadfast in not wanting to regret any decision he made when walking that path regardless of what he'd have to do during it. Him having to preform the same actions as Archer will still pain him greatly, but as long as it's for the greater good he'll follow it.   Claiming that UBW was anything but an actual story when there were obstacles to overcome and the entire route following his gradual development is dumb as shit.   Though I wouldn't expect anything else from someone who prefers Tsukihime over it, since in Tsukihime the MC wasn't nearly as interesting and took other works to even get him to be an actual character.         Zero is one story and you already know how it ends  Of all sad words of tongue or pen The saddest are these, 'It might have been.'       H/A actually made me dislike her more somehow when it had the opposite effect for every other character even shinji  Fucking this. Throughout HF she was a manipulative bitch, but all HA did for her was expand her into jealous bitch territory as well. The only argument anyone ever seems to bring up for liking her is that they like the idea of giving everything up for your waifu.      the MC wasn't nearly as interesting  Actual insanity is way more interesting than your fanwanking route.     Both are: "I'm dying and I'm at peace with that." There really isn't anything edgy about what Caster said, he was just finding rest in death.    Illya is dead.      Reading HF for Sakura  Well there's your problem      Ilya route a BEST.    So is Prisma a route where Kiritsugu decides to run away at that castle scene?     actual insanity  All you're referring to is mindless insanity. Shirou was an insane person, but only in that the had aspects of himself he couldn't control, like his wish to follow the ideals that he had grasped for since his childhood.   Calling it fanwanking is silly as shit, when Tsukihime is just a huge fucking fanwank where he gets everything ever. Shirou is miles better of a protagonist than the blank slate Shiki is.       You know, if it actually was Illya's route then I wouldn't have any problem with it. Problem was he threw everything away for Sakura, with a few scenes of Illya. The scenes with Illya were good sure, but when 90% of the route is him chasing after Sakura and doing shit with Sakura, then that's going to cause at least 90% of the route to be SHIT.    No. In Prisma, Irisviel and Kiritsugu just kill all of the Einzbern and prevent the war from starting entirely.     Shirou was an insane person  You mean a complete retard? Nanaya Shiki was way more entertaining.      Eight months after Ilya is born, Kiritsugu and Irisveil wipe out the Einzberns to abort the Grail War so their daughter can live a normal, happy life  It doesn't go quite as planned      In prisma he and Iri decide that Ilya is more important than the grail war and kiritsugu slaughters the einzbern family    Holy shit, but how does that stop the war from starting? Do they explain this in depth in the manga?    Hitler-kun went on a picnic to the olympic games.    That war was the first, none of the other families even knew about it and the Einzbern name is forgotten    If by entertaining then you mean repetitive and a massive Gary Stu then yes. Shirou can't even fucking compare to the levels of fanwank that Shiki gets to.  Shirou knows exactly what he's going into, and he's not overly powerful at all. He has a strong innate ability that was developed through his mindset, but it's not an overwhelming one. He follows his ideals because it's beautiful to him, because he's a broken individual, but it's because of that insanity he's able to bring happiness to many.   Shiki is just for edgelords who don't want anything else.        That's not during WW2, fuckboy. Hitler-kun is a very serious boy who doesn't have time for antics.    In Prisma, that was going to be the first Holy Grail War, and the Einzberns had prepared everything on their own.     I am the bone of my bait.jpg    Guys i wanna start watching Fate/stay ubw, which one do i watch? theres like 4 different ones   I'm not talking about Caster, but his master went full retard     So I can't even pretend it's a real Illya route that can be shoehorned into fitting with F/Z.     Read the VN Watch Zero Read hollow ataraxia  Do it in that order and you can basically start with everything else in any order you want. The Fate route can get incredibly boring but just force yourself through it. You're going to end up liking either HF or UBW generally.   Also don't listen to Tsukihimefags, they're just lonely and want people to look at pages in the manga with Shiki cutting things with them.          Shirou is closer to a Gary Stu than Shiki is. Neither of them are, of course, but UBW itself is incredibly broken and the only servant that actually beat EMIYA is Berserker's convenient counter to UBW.     Watch Zero and then Ufotable's UBW. Ignore the movie and the DEEN adaptation.      Every fight in Zero feels like something from Naruto (He caught his sword and used it to deflect the other one!)  That's nothing like Naruto. That's Errol Flynn shit. Naruto is magic nukes and shit.      Zero first  All it'll do is spoil HF for him. He's better off watching UBW and waiting for the HF movie before watching Zero.     Read Tsukihime, read Plus Disc, read KT, read and play Melty Blood, read and watch all of KnK, read the F/SN VN, read Hollow Ataraxia and read F/Z.     watch Zero first      my shitty eroge adaptation is better than your chuuni LN adaptation!  They're both shit, Prisma best route, deal with it.    Heaven's Feel &gt; Zero &gt; Prisma Illya &gt; UBW  It's always great to see you fatefags argue which show is shittier when both series is garbage.  I just can't imagine what kind of fanbase you both have anymore. Combination of newfags, nostagiafags VN readers, cancer from /jp/, narutofags, etc.  Enjoy your thread.       Edgelord detected      Carnival Phantasm   Why are magical girl spinoffs always better than the source material?       Everyone knows Tsukihime, CP, and Prisma are superior.     dunecooning      Please explain what's going on in that gif      This scene right here is already better than the entirety of anything else there is in the other series adaptions. Zero has so much more weight to it than something like ubw. The universe in zero is much fuller and actually has some substance rather than everyone coming from the same highschool and only having one location etc. A comparison would be something shitty like bleach that has 3-4 locations max vs one piece which is a whole world + potentially moons and shit.  Another example...alexander vs gil is barely even a fight and yet it has so much more meaning and maturity to it than any ubw fight. Its like comparing obi vs vader to any of the garbage prequel fights.   Also this   The entire franchise is absolute garbage, but at least zero tries to make something WHOLE out of it that has some actual scale.           Phantasmoon sucks. Worst part about CP. Prisma illya has its moments. Bazett was the best part about it.      Phantasmoon was the worst part of CP  Say that to my face and not online and see what happens faggot      Phantasmoon sucks. Worst part about CP.  Kill yourself.     Archer vs Shirou in the VN blows Banquet of Kings out of the water.     It was boring shit, not really funny either. Shiki+Shirou teamup was the best part by far.      I'm right!   No you're wrong!   I'm right!   Okay maybe you're right    better than KINGLY TALKS and saber bullying         Can't we all jusy agree that Fate is just shit in general? Or nah?    /a/ ever agreeing on something      simplifying it to DEEN levels  As expected from a Zerofag.     HF is a modest 7/10 but the rest is shit. Zero was a 6/10 only for Iskandar and Waver.     Fate became shit in general after F/Z got adapted.   God tier:  Holy Grail Grand Prix   Marble Phantasmoon   Seihai-kun   Berserker's First Task (Berserker's Day Out?)   Saber At Work   High tier:  Sakura telenovel   MCs date everyone   Final Dead Lancer   Magicians Hate Technology   Mid tier:  Holy Grail game show   Ilya's Castle Let's Play   Tsukihime at the beach   Shonen H   MC's date the main heroine   Low tier:  Neko scenes   Sharing Tables   Please stop tier:  Back Alley Alliance                             Because the originals are made by throwing random ideas on paper to make money, but the magical girl spin-offs are made out of pure love.    Fate is not only shit, but it was so close to at least having the HF appeal of a few cool fights.  Lancer vs Gilgamesh could've been great, and Archer vs Berserker was so good that even DEEN managed to make it great.      Oh fuck, I forgot. Caster and Souichiro go somewhere on high-tier.     Nope, this is pretty correct in terms of what you get with each      and the plot is like a less mature version of Fate but with Heaven's Feel for an ending.    Fate    mature        Final Dead Lancer   Date Everyone   Shiki's master   not Elder God Teir         worst thing in her own route   worst thing in her own scenes in HA   worst thing in her own CP episodes  Is there anything Sakura can do right?        &gt; Fate   &gt; mature  That's not what I said      Well, her Servant is oppai megane, so I guess she did something right.    this thread     oppai megane  So she fucked that up too.     I think you forgot messed up there friend. Phantasmoon is on the wrong end of the tier list.          Yun    Why do people even like this self-insert character?   Zero to 'I want your dick' in three episodes.   Tsundere.    She's a kuudere, newfriend. The tsundere act is ironic.   But nobody thinks she's a tsundere, she's just insane.      I'm more referring to the characters in the show calling her tsundere.      we have established years ago that she is post-tsundere  of course a newfag like you wouldn't know about this      She's not a tsundere. Everyone just plays it that way because she wants to look strong without knowing what that really is. I mean, look at the shit she went through.  Her mom joins a cult   To move up the ladder in the cult, her mother offers to let another member rape Senjoughara   She conks the dude out, her mother loses her shit on her   Her parents get divorced   Basically, her family loses all it's money   Before the divorce, Kaiki exploits their problem to scam all their money   She possibly(?) attempts suicide on the same day Araragi discovers her   Araragi is the only one who bothers to give her a legitimate solution   She has to face all her issues and in the end crumbles under the weight and has to be saved   She's thankful to Araragi and later it's revealed if Kaiki had saved her, she would have been head over heels  She more/less attaches herself to whoever can play the role of "Hero/good guy" she has in her mind. The basis of hers and Araragi's relationship is a dependency on him to not fuck up and shatter her delusion. Hell, she hasn't actually fully come to terms with the shit she's gone through.   Now have some Mousou Express  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=q24<wbr>i-kdawwY</wbr>  [ ]                 Araragi would be a creepy friendless outcast who molests his sisters if supernatural phenomena didn't exist.   implying there is anything wrong with that  Normie pls.   Crab a cute    You can't fall in love with someone in the span of 1 week  Anon please     Why are kuuderes always best girl?    Araragi choose to not have friends because he became disillusioned with people after he was too retarded to help out his childhood friend being abused by her parents.    And if he didn't look like a visual kei star with a natural 8-pack    But her whole relationship with Araragi is based on the belief she holds that a real "good guy" would help her and ask for nothing in return. Araragi basically did that and continues to fit that ideal, so she continues to believe she loves him for that reason. Look at what she knew about him from the beginning. Nothing. Now that she is more involved with him, all the things that would normally be unattractive to most other girls like her are just personality quirks she accepts as part of the package.    She didn't fall in love with Araragi immediatly though. It's better explained in the novels but her confession was just an excuse to spend more time with Araragi.    But that was a joke as well. Murararagi even said that she should be tsundara rather than tsundere.    I don't remember Rei being best girl.    The disillusionment was actually caused by everyone in his class turning on the class rep when it was actually the teacher's fault.   Is she a virgin?   Sometimes you just don't realize shit until later.I never realized my friend was asking for help with his molester "adopted grandpa" until he shot himself.    kuudere =/= dandere  Get out Evangelitard      She did lusted hard after Araragi for a week before they started dating though.      That OP    Studios could make 70s/80s style anime any day they want and they don't.    Time grinds pain into my soul like olives under a millstone.         Not anymore after she got walked home gently.     Anons thought he was going to be gently walking her home   We all were a bit a slow with picking up on it  This show really doesn't hold anything back, does it?      tfw Araragi gets to have amazing S&amp;M sex every day    what do you mean every day? they only did it twice   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=NpU<wbr>qv2Lwxyg</wbr>  [ ]  Tsundere sarvice~     This.  “You know, Hanekawa-san,”   Said Senjougahara-san.  “I thought it was the opposite. Ever since I saw the two of you in April, I thought for sure that you were dating. And even if that hadn’t been the case, I was sure that you were in love with each other. That’s why I was so shocked when I asked Araragi-kun only for him to deny it.”  Although.   Although it’s only now that I can say it out loud, she said, and continued.   “When I confessed to Araragi-kun, I thought I would be rejected. Of course, at that time, I was ready to do anything it took to have him accept, but I won’t deny that, in a way, I had nothing to lose by trying. After all, it seemed so obvious to me that Araragi-kun liked you — I was sure, then, that I fell in love with the Araragi-kun who was in love with you.”           No they do it at least once a week    He still is that anon, just with a harem.     Now have some Mousou Express  It's a quality OP. Why does the worst girl get the best OPs?     To balance out the universe anon.    To be fair, outside of his immediate harem we have no idea how others view him. For one thing, his sisters regularly call him gross, disgusting, etc, so there's definitely some awareness.    Because one of the best girls got one of the best ops https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=p1H<wbr>uxc3jqZQ</wbr>  [ ] In fact, almost every girl got a good op https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=S9j<wbr>WqAwE0E0</wbr>  [ ]  Also, because Snake had one of the best arcs in terms of development and shit happening. I would call it wasted potential if not for Snake in a nighty.         To balance things out. Make it more proper.    Only Tsukihi, and she changed her tune pretty quickly following Phoenix. Weirdly enough, she also mentions breaking up with her boyfriend I think because "he wasn't mature enough" for her.     If I had sex with Ougi, would it be proper?     It depends, how gay are you?     ...right.     Bake and Nise were top tier in terms OPs and EDs. By comparison, SS and the OVAs were relatively weak in the musical department (except for Tsuki. You can really tell that had a different composer due to how different the music sounds, in a good way).     I... season..3.....NOW..    I fucked up the picture title... Next episode in 28 hours   Soon  I'm more curious about c75 than the S2 finale honestly.  nightmare foreshadowing   I'm curious about the cliffhanger at the end.   Ochiai was only looking at the battle.  Its cool to Tsugumori Launch.   [Spoiler] He is going to use his new chimera in the next episode? [/Spoiler]     Fail  Shit.     I know a lot of people hate the CGI, but god damn do Guardians look fucking badass.  not bad for something put together from a bunch of random model kits      Lanching sequence are the best   A fan made Tsumugi figure   Where can I download this?     Maybe in the middle of S3     c75 seems to be just a conclusion for Sidonia defense team. The next chapter maybe about Nagate and Tsumugi I believe.   I thought benisuzume was at sidonia since she was tsumugi's mom. Why is she on that planet? And I really hope she's just a yandere that wants to love tanikaze    Smoogy without her skirt  That's lewd Anon.     If you remember in the first season, when they appeared, there was three of them.  One was killed and one was captured. Benny escaped and showed up again at the end of season 1. She was thought to be killed, but she managed to reform.       So that's where Hyggus particles come out when she flies.   http://news.mynavi.jp/news/2015/06/<wbr>25/746/  Kotobukiya Tsugumori Kai 2  </wbr>  Captain doesn't even mind wearing the mask in public anymore.   Netflix Original series Season 2 coming soon in early July.   http://www.amiami.com/top/detail/de<wbr>tail?gcode=FIGURE-012202&amp;page=top</wbr>  Don't mess with the Ruris   Arc-V as a whole has the kind of soundtrack the older age-aimed anime wishes it had. I'd say it rivals Iwasaki    How about you fuck off, then? People keep trying and trying to stop the threads just because they think the arc is boring, but it isn't happening. It lasted through much worse, we're here for the long haul.    Synchro a shit because muh ebin solitaire bullshit   XYZ is too easy outside of R4 spam, which is even easier   Ritual is all-round shit outside of Nekrocucks  Fusion is decidedly the coolest method, yet it too is tarnished by its shifty portrayal in the anime and widely shitty looking monsters. Why do they do this?     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=BzI<wbr>0hB6JIjo</wbr>  [ ] Your Trump card anon.    What?  I like the arc though. I wish we would talk about the show more honestly     It's already translated.   I will pay you if that what it costs     not posting better version of pic      You will never experiment the raw insanity of E-Card for the first time again     fukumoto sure knows his metaphors    Screw scans, I think even finding raws of part 1 post chapter 23 is difficult    This... this power! It's overwhelming!     this...this kid! is a monster!  </blockquote>]
