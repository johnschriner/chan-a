Green Day, Grateful Dead, probably Hanged man, Heavy Weather, Highway to Hell, Jail House Rock, Doobie Wah. <br>It's a purely defensive stand, but it's defense has a lot of holes. C-Moon at least has some offensive capabilities.</br></br>  stroheim is best brojo  <br> green day <br>Mold still has to reach him. the altitude is just where it spreads, but it'd never reach him.<br><br> Grateful dead <br>Is the baby a vampire, a tree, or human? how would that even work on him? It looks like the stand only works on humans.<br><br> hanged man <br>light still would have to travel to get to the baby. It'd hit zero. <br><br> Heavy Weather <br>This might work with the Oxygen. but rain, lightening, and poison frogs would all hit the zero point.<br><br> Highway to hell <br>does he have to make contact or does he just have to look at someone to infect them with it? If its just sight, then yeah that would work.<br><br> jail house rock <br>That has to make contact. Zero point. And even still, what is memory loss gonna do to him?<br><br> doobie wah <br>tornado and stand would shrink and hit the zero point.<br><br> purely defensive <br>If the baby had the will, he could just run at people until they shrink to be killed by large things or until they reach the zero point. <br><br><br>Well its a constant effect, and like magnet fields, those work during time stop. So SP and World would still shrink and hit zero if they moved towards the baby in time stop.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>D4C: Love Train?</br>  <br>That's also a definsive stand. The only offense it has is redirecting "bad" things, which would not be able to hit the baby, so no.</br>  <br>Then my only option left is Cream since it goes in a different dimension when it erases matter. GGGOH is quite the defesnsive Stand.</br>  <br> Green Day <br>The mold would just spring out of the baby as soon as he crawled downhill, it never has to approach the baby. <br><br> Hanged man <br>In order to teleport into the baby's eye, yes the light would need to hit it. But I'm pretty sure that in order to attack from a mirror no light needs to touch the baby.<br><br> Bites the Dust <br>I just thought of this, which would work to.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I honestly don't know why they didn't give pucci and the baby a GHA in ASB before he finished saying the heaven chant it totally could have worked if each of his stands had an individual HHA and GHA<br><br> whitesnake <br>HHA: disk steal<br>GHA: throws you at the baby, you shrink, and then green grass of home would fuck your tiny shit<br><br> C-moon <br> HHA: have pucci step on a wall or girder sticking out of the ground or something and shift the gravity and then a fuckton of projectiles fly at the enemy <br> GHA: Time for Heaven <br><br> Made in Heaven <br>HHA: speeds up time even more, making the enemy slower than even before<br><br>GHA: instawin. Slices enemies face and ends the universe. Requires 3 bars.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Supers for Made In Heaven <br>Absolutely not. The slowdown effect is just enough to wail down on your opponent.</br></br>  <br> GHA: instawin. Slices enemies face and ends the universe. Requires 3 bars. <br>never design a fighting game</br></br>  <br><br>If your opponent was stupid or bad enough to allow you to reach Heaven then that should be enough. The slowdown and easy timeout win is like adding salt to the wound. Story as Jolyne was pretty fun when you try to cheese Pucci as much as possible at that point. Playing as Pucci was ridiculous</br></br>  <br>Fuugo Stand.</br>  Risotto can beat it since he can turn the iron in its body without touching it from a distance of 10m.<br>Weather report can too since the slug power is nothing but an illusion.</br>  <br>Imagine if GGGOH was the stand of a grown person. Its be the most danger offensive stand as simply running at you enemy would kill them by bringing the zero point to them.</br>  <br> risotto <br>10 meters, which means he'd have to get in range, and he'd shrink getting in range and never actually get in range by the halved distance. Also the baby is a plant, so no iron in it like a human. So he'd have to attack it with outside iron. And bringing anything into GGGOH range will hit zero point before it can harm it.<br><br> Weather  <br>Slug power only affects animals, baby is a tree. And even if it did, that wouldn't kill the baby, it would just make it a slug. And the slug eaters that try and get it would all hit Zero in its range. But it's oxygen in a closed room could possibly kill it. <br><br><br>Purple haze's range is too short to be able to punch it. And even at night with no sunlight to stop it and the wind carrying it towards the baby, the virus would shrink and hit zero before making contact with the baby.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its not necessary touch the baby, just puch a rock or the earth for active the virus. Abouth the virus, little or big objective is not great difference.</br>  It just hit me that Green Baby's design is actually really cool. I wish we had seen it grown up.  <br>Pretty sure you can get 10m distant from him without being shrank at all. Also plants do have iron in them.</br>  <br>Nero definitely could get in range, he'd just be tiny. I don't think ten meters was anywhere near the "zero point" you keep talking about, Jolyne and Anasui got closer than that.<br><br>And plants do have iron you dumbass, ever heard of spinach?</br></br></br>  <br>But the virus hit zero before it touches the baby.</br>  I can't tell what's happening in this comic.  <br>madoka and madoka2 gets killed by made in heaven</br>  <br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51300492<br><br>Just read the whole thing. I think I'm missing something because I never watched the show.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>I watched the show too and I still have no idea what's going on<br><br>also I can't speak moon</br></br></br>  <br>Because you don't need them? Whitesnake and C-Moon are strong enough without them and if you manage to get to heaven and lose somehow, it's your fault.</br>  Why was white snake able to fuck up Annasui and FF so fast?  <br>Because Araki wanted Pucci to achieve Heaven.</br>  <br>He got the drop on them.</br>  <br>Fate.</br>  <br>Bohemian rhapsody and underworld</br>  <br><br>Tusk IV probably could hurt the babby since the spin will always exists ( like it exists beyond dimensional walls or stopped time ). <br>Maybe it could reach the baby, considering it is a rather OP stand.<br><br>The Sun probably could defeat the baby.<br><br>Rolling Stones. If the Stone starts to roll at the Green Baby, it would be never be able to reach it, thus breaking and damning the Baby to die a horrible death?<br><br>Death 13 might be able to, depends if Green Baby sleeps. Probably not.<br><br>Bites the Dust might work, but it might not trigger.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Forgot about Tusk act 4. Thing's unstoppable because it transcends gravity.</br>  <br>king crimson might work since things stop happing to it during skipped time, see how he got out of this despite being in the process of getting punched and the bullets with rissoto</br>  <br>Which of the gravity based stands is the strongest? There's surpringly a lot of them however c-moon is usually the one I think of the most.</br>   rereading part 6 <br> this appears <br>Really araki? Pretty sure 90% of part 6 stands would whoop Star Platinum's ass</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure that's hyperbole.</br>  <br>Things don't stop happening during KC ability,they do happen but a considerably slower speed than KC. Remember the blood drop thing?</br>  Could Green Baby kill Demonbane  <br>even some of the part 3 and 5 stands could have beaten top form jotaro</br>  <br> the fucking meat rat. </br>  <br>What I meant was things can't harm kc but kc can harm other things. When he was getting hit he should have had something like when jotaro punches dio during stopped time since everything is still moving. However kc the hit continues and kc moves past it despite him being hit prior to skipping.</br>  <br>It wasn't really strong,it's just jotaro being retarded.<br> oh look its stand is shooting something <br> better catch the bullet mid air oh wow I'm so cool right </br></br></br>  <br>Bruno's punch just made contact, Diavolo used KC ability and in that moment Bruno's punch became considerably slower letting KC avoid it.</br>  <br>I want to argue but you're right. Fuckin' Jotaro</br>  <br>btw, is there some translation for jojo-a-go-go!?</br>  <br>blood drop works because KC keeps inertia and movement working, but nothing else<br><br>blood flow still happens, but you can't get harmed because bullshit stand rules</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=eUX<wbr>nBG9nYvA</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>The concept of Joseph not being able to get a date is vastly amusing</br></br>  <br>I always just remember it by "time skips for everyone else BUT Diavolo". <br>Things happen, people will perform actions like eating pastry, but they will not remember it, just notice the time skip occasionally.</br></br>  <br>that implies Diavolo could kill them, but he can't, the only thing he can do is move stuff around, like moving them inside bars and over cliffs so when time gets erased they're still harmed by something that happens after time resumes</br>  <br>But he did kill narancia during time erase</br>  <br>I literally addressed that, he just moved her inside bars, so the killing happened outside the period of erased time. Erasing time only keeps movement done during the timeskip.</br>    Let's assume that Diavolo lost that fight against Risotto<br>How would Giorno's gang beat him?

And they did. Diavolo just pushed Giorno's body down and pierced it.</br></br>  <br>then why would the bars fix themselves like said</br>  <br><br>oh good, I just misremembered, my bad<br><br>then I guess damage to inanimate objects remains, like the effects of made in heaven</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't Jotaro contact Polnareff before the events of Part 5 to tell him that Josuke could restore his body?</br>  <br>They didn't get fixed,see</br>  <br>This is time stop levels of bullshit.</br>  <br>Because Jotaro is retarded and he was also busy studying dolphins</br>  <br>Because Jotaro is a dick.</br>  <br>Wouldn't this not work since technically the Baby is a stand and sleeping with a stand would bring it inside the dream.<br><br>I don't know the limits of the dream world but im sure you can make it somewhat work.</br></br></br>  <br>it would obviously have a windup and be melee range.</br>  <br>Jotaro didn't know Polnareff got in a wheel chair</br>  <br>Why does everyone fixate on the dolphin thing? <br><br>Jotaro was said to have specialized in sharks AND whales, right? Which would include dolphins but that's not all he studied.<br><br>EXPLAIN THIS MEME</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's still a bad idea</br>  <br>NOTHING<br>MAKES<br>ANY<br>SENSE</br></br></br></br>  <br> Baby is a stand <br>no it isn't</br></br>  <br>I read the manga without /a/ influence and I still thought he was obsessed with dolphins because<br> going from having the most powerful stand in the world to putting dolphins all over your uniform or whatever the fuck that was <br><br>was just jarring</br></br></br></br>  Cheap Trick?  <br>Instant kills usually have a drawback to them. In Guilty Gear, you have to be in a certain mode to use them and you can't use any specials or supers and you will eventually lose health. Here, you're implying that Pucci still keeps his slowdown powers when he does his Galactica Phantom like super as you described it.</br>    <br>Dolphins are cool and rape people<br>Also I don't recall him saying being specialized in sharks,only being a marine biologist which could be anything from shrimps to otters</br></br>  <br>Assuming that it teleports to the baby and doesn't move to it's back then yes, theoretically cheap trick would work.</br>  <br>Josuke and Polnareff would've been buds, right?</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PNw<wbr>qZsCBQkQ</wbr>  [ ]<br> start this at 1:24 <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=V-B<wbr>Bt29m0I8</wbr>  [ ]<br> in sync with this <br> lower the sono chi no sadame so you can hear the lines <br>I am surprised about how it syncs very well with the lines.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He specializes in starfish if we go by his dissertation.</br>  <br>because he had dolphins all over his clothes in lets go hunting</br>  Psst<br><br>Is "Kakyoin dies" still cool to say?</br></br>  <br>He became a marine biologist, and was so obsessed with his work that Joseph tricked him into impregnating and marrying a guidette.</br>  <br>The whale and shark thing was at the end of part 4 when it mentioned he stayed in Morioh to get his doctorate or whatever.

Did Lisa Lisa tell her about George's death or anything about the zombies? I forget, but I don't think she did.</br>  <br>You've never met anyone with a delusionally-coddling grandma? Erina is objectively worst wifeJo for a reason.</br>  <br>Mikitaka's people starting coming to Earth in larger numbers and blending in after Part 4. We can see their ears because we're the audience.</br>  <br> people though Jesus could do miracles because they couldn't see his Stand </br>  <br>because she was a fucking wanted criminal, meeting up with joseph would've just put him at risk and/or traumatized him more if she got caught.<br><br><br>the part in part 6 is really bad because araki stopped caring</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, that psychic girl from berserk</br>  <br>Why did Joseph even have natural ripple skills? Does Araki subscribe to lysenkoist genetics or something?</br>  <br>The better question is why did Lisa Lisa have them.</br>  <br>Are you the one from the Berserk thread talking about fucking Jolyne in intricate detail?</br>  <br><br><br><br>problem with this plan is that <br><br>A: 3freeze requires koichi to touch something, meaning range/runaway style stands can continue to do so freely<br><br>B: whitesnake has his deadly acid jizz powers anyway, which work at the same distance or even longer and incapacitate people more than 3freeze does, meaning whitesnake doesn't need the help<br><br>now a real fun combo would be josuke/giorno/jolyne, who could bullshit their way through any situation</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> push bad shit from one person to another with your stand <br> hailed as greatest miracle worker of history <br><br>Joshua was Joseph tier Jojo.

Jonathan and George didn't have natural hamon skills.</br>  <br>Speaking of PHF girls I was kind of disappointed by Sheila E. The design and the stand made me expect a much more interesting character. The playing card guy turned out to be pretty cool though.</br>  <br> Why did Joseph even have natural ripple skills?  <br>having the potential to be good at hamon is genetic, it's basically a mutation<br><br><br>because she was raised by straights for several decades before he decided to be a badguy</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no_ </br>  <br>The whole point of the buddy cop is the personality of the stands and those punch ghost have zero personality. Whitesnake and echoes have compatible personalities.</br>  /tg/ here with a question: Are there any consequences to overuse of one's Stand outside of combat? Has anyone ever actually run out of spiritual energy and such, outside of being forcibly drained by certain stands?    <br>Nope.<br>Are you guys roleplaying JoJo?</br></br>  <br>Nope, shouldn't be any issue with using your stand 24/7.</br>  <br>nope<br><br>then again the number of times someone actually uses their stand outside of a fight are pretty small, and there's never been a shown example of someone using their stand outside of a fight for long periods at a time besides those stands that are always on <br><br>so if you wanna houserule that in nothings stopping you</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His stand probably.<br><br>[I'M SINGING IN A STORE]</br></br></br>    <br>Nope, and is there a jojo RPG going on?</br>    Does anyone know how the non-translated Jojo novels are?

I hope Nasu fleshes out his setting in the Tsukihime remake.</br>  <br> or you can go batshit with superpowers and open your own reality with blackjack and hookers <br><br>Wait, so does this explain why Ciel is a basket case and is obsessed with curry?</br></br></br>  <br>Talking on all subjects accordingly, didn't Wallachia actually fully achieve RM at some point? I distinctly remember him being able to instantly summon whenever he wishes, as long as the idea of him remains long enough in one area.</br>  <br>No, apparently that's just how Ciel is.<br><br>She had an encounter with an equally curry obsessed DAA after her conditioning by the Burial Agency and that was the point of infection (albeit this is questionably canon)</br></br></br>  <br>Arcueid was the only one capable of constructing a RM without it damaging her personality, she lost her ability to summon her strength without the consumption of the lifeforce of others, but the DAA's actually didn't just materialize RM's just because they sat around for ages and had plenty of time to figure it out, Arc was just that naturally gifted I suppose.</br>  <br>Wallacia is another can of worms, it's a phenomenon that sort of acquires characteristics from what I understand. <br><br>I'd say that it was more of a RM looking for something to become its master than otherwise.</br></br></br>  <br> she lost her ability to summon her strength without the consumption of the lifeforce of others <br><br>What? She does fine in Melty.</br></br></br>  <br>The Gaia fed her blood if Im not mistaken, and before that happened, she had never consumed blood. That's why afterwards, she wasn't as powerful as she could have been had she not drank any, because from that point on, her lifeforce depended on her draining others lifeforces the moment she drank the blood.<br><br>Had she remained all natural, she'd of never needed to consume lifeforce, and would of just naturally manifested power, instead of needing to manifest it and wasting magi.<br><br>At least, that's what it shows. Am I wrong?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are expecting too much from a garbage ero game for kids, anon-kun.</br>  <br>Gaia? You mean Roa. Her lifeforce doesn't depend on draining anything, her bloodlust is only psychological. Though she does need to use her power to supress the impulse, she doesn't need to drink blood to use her powers.</br>  <br>Actually yeah, now that I remember more clearly, it was Roa with that cup, not the manifestation of Gaia like I initially thought.<br><br>Also, I went back and looked, and Arc actually did manifest a RM without needing drain the lifeforce of others, but that's all she could manage to do without needing to lifeforce drain. She'd of been much more able to not only materialize the RM, but to also use techniques within it, had she fed beforehand, but refuses to based on some bullshit promise with that faggot shiki.<br><br>As a side note, I never said she needed to drink blood to be powerful. I only said she was tricked into doing it initially and then from that point on, to reach her full potential, she'd need to lifeforce drain, meaning in order to activate her RM at max, she will indeed need to lifeforce drain in order to do so.<br><br>But yeah, it was Roa. I wonder, why did I think his name was Gaia? It's not Hermes or Osiris I'm thinking of, is it? It's not like Roa was a guardian.<br><br>Now that I think about it, to add to the previous question about self-realization, why wasn't Roa able to just reanimate as a full power Roa without needing to connect to the reality marble that Crimson moon created? It's like all the DA's are limited by basic concepts unless they exist within the same reality as the marble they create. It's fucking retarded. Couldn't they just create a RM each and every time they sense trouble? It's not like they're always fucking carrying around enough magi necessary to realize one if they're caught off guard. It needs preparation, right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So how do you explain Iskander?  <br>Maybe it's just that his materialization is so powerful even though it's disconnected space-time, that it warps the realities of others?<br>I'd say it's nothing like UBW though.<br><br>The more he manifests it, and the stronger he believes he rules over everyone, the wider, and more stable his RM becomes?<br><br>It's not like the magi can't materialize reality marbles of enormous size, just not ones big enough to warrant the attention of the CF.<br><br>Maybe, just maybe, iskander had a RM within an RM which allowed him, even at the lowest levels, to summon magi from outside of his RM as if its always active, and those trapped inside the RM are fully actualized the moment he becomes a part of his own RM?<br><br>I'm just guessing, but it seems idealistic to consider that someone who's a conqueror has a very twisted, but also a very stable mindset, and that could give way to a decent sized RM, as long as his ideals don't stray too far from essential reality and base physics within the RM.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Shirou's a vampire.</br>  ALEXANDER IS A VAMPIRE  <br>The spooky thing is he's summoning his genuine comrades, not just copies from the throne.</br>  <br>Baby tier reality marble: The base of the mind becomes a object<br>Shit tier reality marble: Forcing the reflection on to the world with sheer power<br>Good tier: The structure of the mind is a object<br>High tier: A injection is forcing the soul into a structure<br>God tier: The soul is conceptually altered<br><br><br>The mind, the origin, and the structure has to align. Or similar circumstances. <br>Shirou basically became a Tabula Rasa because he died and ressurected.<br>He became a sword because he is carried by a sheat.<br>He gained the properties of a blacksmith by following the ideal of a superhero.<br>And he made additional magic circuits out of his nerves, repeatedly , which is the last trigger that made him into a sword.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, you are retarded and have no clue how RMs work</br>  <br> it's explicitly that magic works by developing an alien mindset that's so absurd that it causes the reality to do a double take <br>That's wrong.<br>A reality Marble is a magecraft that swaps your internal world with the "real world" it doesn't matter what sort of inner world you have it just usualy requires tons of research to develop such a technique</br></br></br>  Wait,things like reality marbles, noble phantasmas and magi were in Tsukihime? I thought that shit was servant and heroic spirit only and only Bazett is a special case because she can't actually manifest the whole weapon she has.  <br>NPs aren't in Tsukihime.<br>The only magi we see are Ciel and Aoko  And Nero Chaos + Roa but those are DAA <br>Tsukihime has Nrvnqsr as a Reality Marble user and Arc as a Marble Phantasm user.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't get where you're getting the lifeforce bullshit. Arc doesn't need blood to live or be strong, it's just that she has to waste 70% of her power to suppress her lust for blood. The reason she doesn't feed has nothing to do with Shiki, because giving into her base desires would drive her insane and turn her into the same monsters she was created to hunt.</br>  <br>I'm assuming you've played the VN's the fighting games, and read the manga.<br><br>She wasn't "created" to do a fucking thing, retard.<br><br>Arcueid, ignorant of her nature as a vampire and the consequences of drinking blood, was easily tricked by Roa into drinking his and turned berserk, wiping out most of the True Ancestors, turning Roa into one of the strongest Dead Apostles and having a considerable portion of her power stolen by him. It mentions fuck all, ever, about her being created.<br><br>Also, like vampires, she would inherently gain more power, causing her to be capable of much more than she currently is, I;E making MP;s like crescent moon etc etc. Her "bloodlust" is a secondary side effect brought about by the fact Von roa tricked her, but her raw power IS effected by her bleeding.<br><br>It literally explicitly said that in the past, she did in fact feed whilst hunting the dead apostles, which gave her temporary boosts in ability, whether by raw power or magi. She's always had the fucking desire to drink blood. And only recently stopped after finding tohno shiki and getting her ass handed to her in the process, because she's constantly on the verge of death as a result, needing to focus most of her abilities on remaining part of reality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> played the VN's the fighting games and read the manga <br>Meant to put a comma between VN's and the. Anyway, emulators aside, when's the remake of tsukihime scheduled to be released? Anyone have any dates yet?</br></br>  <br> release date <br>pic relate<br> Just start learning japanese next year and you can read the VN when it comes out </br></br></br>  <br> you've played the VN's the fighting games, and read the manga <br><br>If that's all you read you aren't even close to the point where you can discussTsukihime with the experts. Read the interviews with Nasu and the dictionary entries, or just lurk more.<br><br>Arc was extracted from nothingness by the other True Ancestors. Her birth was assisted and she was born in a different way than a regular TA.<br><br> like vampires, she would inherently gain more power <br><br>Arc is a True Ancestor. A completely different kind of vampire than Dead Apostles. Her psychological bloodlust weakens her over time since she needs more powerful to supress her bloodlust.<br><br> It literally explicitly said that in the past, she did in fact feed whilst hunting the dead apostles <br><br>She said she ate regular food, not that she drank blood. That time with Roa was the first and only time she ever drank blood. <br><br> And only recently stopped after finding tohno shiki <br><br>If anything her desire grew stronger. It's explained in Talk that bloodlust grows stronger when True Ancestors have feelings for humans.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually asked you that because it seemed like you weren't the one who's caught up enough. Given that you can get started by playing the VN, and reading the manga. And playing a few fighters to get yourself started.<br><br>Also "experts". kek. I've read all the interviews, a long time ago, no need to sperg out, retard.</br></br></br>  <br> If that's all you read you aren't even close to the point where you can discussTsukihime with the experts. <br><br> discuss Tsukihime <br><br> implying you can be an expert in discussing anime. <br><br>I literally have no words to express how pathetic that read.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, when did I ever say she doesn't have desire to feed?</br>  <br>I'm still waiting for type-moon Ace. It's been fucking forever it seems like.</br>  <br> Just because you lose something doesn't mean you do not have it anymore <br> Shirou <br> Lost Avalon when he gave it back to Saber <br> Still has it because he projects it <br>It actually makes sense.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whore (of Babylon) autism</br>  <br>But TMAce was released last week</br>  Reality Marble is the last skill in the magecraft tree. Anybody can use it, the problem is some people need decades to understand and develope, others need hundreds. Mental thing is due confusion with Demons, who have similar ability.  <br>No shit?......my god....</br>  <br>That's not a RM.</br>  <br>Not that anon, but you can substitute the codeword and it will still be something entirely different. I notice not a lot of people catch their own mistake when confusing MP's for RM's.<br><br>I tend to actually know what it is they mean even if they confuse the two, but I'm not sure if they know what the difference is.<br><br>You do know what the difference is, right?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's a shit.</br>  A reality marble is literally the concept of personal reality taken to its utmost extreme. Being delusional to the point of losing your humanity seems like a good way to stumble into that kind of power.  <br>Everything before this:<br> Also, like vampires, she would inherently gain more power <br>Is correct. Everything after is not and you're a goddamn retard with memory problems if you believe that.</br></br></br>  Is there anyone who can beat Nero Chaos after absorbing Arcueid?  <br> I actually asked you that because <br>This guy  isn't </br></br>  <br>Gilgamesh<br><br>He already has a buff against Arc, and his power will automatically destroy false worlds, which is entirely what Nero's body is composed of there.<br><br>Quite a few others as well</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He already has a buff against Arc <br>You completly missunderstand why he wins against Arc.<br> Quite a few others as well <br>List some.<br>Ea is the obvious thing and Gae Bolg is a toss-up but with Arc absorbed Nero's physical capabilities will be too high for the meodp-users we know to hit him</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shiki. Even if he transform into lovecraftian horror Shiki can still one-shoot him</br>  <br>Her ability is literally planting a flag, and claiming the area for Roman Soil.</br>    <br>I laughed way more than I should.</br>  <br>Superficially it looks like a RM, but is directly said in the bio and data book that it isn't one. Rather than replacing the world, its something built upon the world. Thus its not so easy to make it poof away, its more sturdy.<br><br> The Flamboyant Golden Theatre (Noble Phantasm) <br><br> Aestus Domus Aurea. Red Sabre's Noble Phantasm, which represented the explosion of her bothersome artistic talent.  <br> Its precise name was Aestus Estus Domus Aurea.  <br> In Latin, Aestus Ustus meant "passion" and "heat", while Domus Aurea was the name of the theatre that was constructed.  <br> It was the manifestation of the tale of Red Sabre declaring "Heed my song!" and locking everyone in the theatre to listen to his singing.  <br> It created a golden theatre in which everything was advantageous to Sabre, and made it into the battle field. There were rose petals dancing in the air.  <br> It was different from a Reality Marble, which covered the current World with a different World. The Golden Theatre could persist for long periods because it was built on top of the current World.  <br> As an aside, when the Golden Theatre was risen, Sabre's sworld would be shrouded in flames like that of the Mount Vesuvius, causing an infernal. Such was the initial design.  <br> However, it was cut because of the difficulty to animate. The sad limit of handhelds.  <br> In terms of derivatives, it seemed that there was the Silver Workshop for Sabre's artistic endeavours, and "Blazing Kitchen" for cooking competitions.  <br> Such was the will of Her Majesty. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anything short of ORT is probably not gonna cut it.<br><br><br>You are retarded. Gil is only confirmed to win against 30% Arc, and if Nrvnqsr absorbed Arc he'll gain all 100% of her powers + what he already has.<br><br>Nrvnqsr can already spawn low class dragons and Mythical class magical creatures stronger than that (like those crab monsters). A Nrvnqsr who absorbed Arc would be able to spawn Divine class creatures like it's nothing and Arc would probably take the form of his ultimate form. Hell, Nrvnqsr was sure he would single handedly destroy the Burial Agency had he succeeded.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This also means Gaia doesn't hate it.</br>  <br> You are retarded. Gil is only confirmed to win against 30% Arc, and if Nrvnqsr absorbed Arc he'll gain all 100% of her powers + what he already has. <br>EA would still hard-counter him.<br>Gil is just too OP</br></br></br>  <br> Anything short of ORT is probably not gonna cut it. <br>Already on it.</br></br>  <br> Gil is just too OP <br>Gil a overrated.</br></br>  <br>God damnit that looks fucking stupid</br>  <br><br><br>who is the red man?</br></br></br>  Narita's gonna make this guy call Gil a faker at some point, right?  <br>Man, how unorganized are you if you come to a grail war just after jumping out of the shower. <br>Can't even aim properly for a "True Archer" with that fucking towel in the way.</br></br>  <br>Ea can be nulified with a counterattack of equal or higher output. <br><br>Also, with Arc's physical stats he could rip Gil a new one way before he thinks of pulling Ea.</br></br></br>  <br> Can't even aim properly <br>Pinpoint accuracy from more than twenty kilometers away, with his eyes covered.</br></br>  <br>Pretty dapper look you got there, m8.</br>  <br>Gil is still alive hence he failed. My point still stands. My point falls when Gil does.</br>  <br>Isn't talking a free action while activating an NP?</br>  <br>There are things worse than Gilgamesh out there<br><br>BB<br>Primate Murder<br>Kingprotea<br>Enkidu, maybe origin mode<br>Most divine spirits<br>Buddha <br>Passion or Lilith have the chance of being very broken(Passion will autokill you unless you have Dust of Osiris gear, and Lilith with any amount of prep is invincible)<br>Kiara<br>Number of the servants in F/S can be broken<br>Arthur with some of her shit<br>Zwei Ilya<br>Zelretch<br>Demon Aliens<br>Arc's Sister<br><br>People think if Nero ate her he'd gain all the powers of Archetype Earth or something.

Then we can fight".<br><br>He hasn't actually struck against Gilgamesh himself yet, as much as just pissed him off the entire fight.

I would hope Gil would get his shit kicked in by True Archer instead of just taunted and toyed with. <br>We all know that's going to end up with Gilgamesh pulling a Shirou and beating him against the odds because of TA's arrogance.</br></br>  <br>He was talking about those characters being stronger than Gil. Not the hypothetical Nrvnqsr.</br>  <br> &gt;BB <br> Only in the mooncell therefore irrelevant <br> &gt;Kingprotea <br> see BB <br><br>BB and Protea have power outside of the Mooncell entirely if they showed up there, just not as much.<br><br>Protea is still the strongest divine creature, and BB still ate a lot of gods and has modded her body with those powers. Even if you take away her ability to control virtual spiritons, she still has the power of a lot of gods.<br><br>Protea did exist on Earth and still does as a forgotten spirit, Mooncell had a record of it recorded, but sealed it away because it feared that power.

That wasn't included in the newest editions of Strange Fake; only in the draft. It's not like Gilgamesh was even at his strongest, either, since his vault was incomplete.</br>  <br>It was full Arc<br><br>She was the one who cut her hair in a way that Arc couldn't entirely go full power anymore. If Arc is fighting something stronger than her 30 percent form, she's not 30 percent Arc anymore.<br><br>Planetary backup will push her up to her limits to be beyond her foe as an authority so she can use her utmost, or at least be a bit above them. Yet Altrogue still won, even when Arc by authority would be above her by the same amount no matter how strong either of them was.<br><br>If Arc is fighting something as strong as thirty one percent of herself, then she will become thirty two percent Arc due to backup.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Saber with Avalon would have lost then and there if Gil hadn't explicitly spared her. And she had to survive Ea's love tap first to gauge how she'd need to counterattack.<br><br>Ko-Gil said it's all that should be expected from his partial incarnation. She never beat it in full.</br></br></br>  <br>Its stated in F/S<br><br> Gilgamesh speculates that Enkidu could potentially be summoned as a Berserker-class Servant or in some other way that would make their coming duel less favorable, but he casts aside the thought. Faldeus comments that he would potentially reach the level of a god, regaining the power lost from gaining humanity. </br></br></br>  <br>It's not touched upon in the more recent novels.</br>  <br>He would have never underestimated Lancelot as much as he did Shirou. I'm also not entirely sure he could deflect a full 360 attack from gate of Babylon, Heracles couldn't.</br>  <br>She had long hair when Roa stole her power</br>  <br>It's like pottery!</br>  <br> It was full Arc <br>That is never actually stated and neither was it even stated that she won, just that she manage to steal her hair.<br><br> She was the one who cut her hair in a way that Arc couldn't entirely go full power anymore <br>This wasn't stated either, just that Arc's hair won't grow until she gets back what Altrouge stole. Whether the hair has any relevance to Arc's power is never stated either.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He would have never underestimated Lancelot as much as he did Shirou. <br>I'm pretty sure he did in his aerial fight which Lancelot pretty much got the drop on gill with those flares. A literal BITFO even Gill was salty as fuck afterwards.</br></br>  <br>Cool, new shit.</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br> Whether the hair has any relevance to Arc's power is never stated either. <br>Hair, or at the very least women's hair, stores power in the Nasuverse. Mahoyo touches on it a little bit, but it's never really been something at the front and center of the Nasuverse.</br></br>  <br><br>Forgot one.</br></br>  <br>Someone needs to speed up translating this, Strange Fake looks fucking dope</br>  <br>That's for a magus. Are is 30% because she's using rest of her power to suppress her blood lust.</br>  Note that Satsuki's Reality Marble, Depletion Garden, literally symbolizes her "loss without gain".  <br> Are <br>Arc I mean</br></br>  Incidentally, Ionioi Hetairoi and Aestus Domus Aurea are not Reality Marbles. In fact, Aestus Domus Aurea is in some ways more efficient simply BECAUSE it's not a Reality Marble.  <br>Is there anyone stronger than the guy who can kill Types?</br>  Could a atomic bomb defeat Gilgamesh?  <br>Why would it only work for a magus? Literally everything supernatural, from magecraft to Mystic Eyes to vampires, runs off of mana, doesn't it?<br><br><br>IH isn't a Reality Marble because it isn't an inner world, it's a shared world. But it still runs off of the World Egg theory, so it's much more of a Reality Marble than Aestus.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He can't actually kill them, not even Black Barrel could do that. He just destroys the physical body.</br>  <br>Servants don't take damage unless there's mana behind it.<br><br>GoB also has it's own nukes and shit.</br></br></br>  <br>What if you infused an atomic bomb with mana? As in, filled it with jewels and shit?</br>  <br>He's only noteworthy because he can scale to the opponent's size. Before the Types he wasn't anything special.</br>  Is there a Servant that could even possibly EVEN TOUCH Nerō? Let alone defeat her. And I'm not talking about Saber.I'm not talking about Saber Nerō Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus with Aestus Domus Aurea activated and wielding Aestus Estus.<br><br>Hell,I'm not even talking about Rider Nero with Aestus Domus Aurea activated and wielding Aestus Estus,as she sits astride the Divine Beast of Revelations itself while utilizing her A rank Imperial Privilege to gain A ranks in Divinity, Eternal Arms Mastership, and Riding.<br><br>I'm talking about Rider Nerō with Aestus Domus Aurea activated and wielding Aestus Estus, as she sits astride the Divine Beast of Revelations itself while utilizing her A rank Imperial Privilege to gain A ranks in Divinity, Eternal Arms Mastership, and Riding while buffed with Très Fontaine Tempestes: Fountain of the Saint Who Weaves Through Time, Invictus Spiritus: Thrice, Though I Welcome the Setting Sun, and Très Fontaine Claudeo: Fountain of the Saint Who Tends Wounds, and Très Fontaine Ardent: Fountain of the Blazing Saint while also having partial access to the skillset of BB by reclaiming the various powers she wields derived from the Beast of Revelation, such as Potnia Theron: Conception of All Animals to gain the authority of the Earth Mother so her will is absolute against all Earth born creatures, Bishop's Staff of Rulership in order to allow her to rewrite the fundamental rules of reality as she pleases, and Ten Crowns to grant her the ability to reverse causality to make all damage inflicted to her null while simultaneously utilizing Domina Cronam Capitoline, Domina Cronam Caelius, and Domina Cronam Viminalis before she attacks you with the Cursed Cutting Crater and Fax Caelestis in order to conceptually erase your existence and imprint her own desired reality upon the space you resided within via a world purging curse while simultaneously and paradoxically inflicting the burn status upon you</br></br></br></br>  In fact, Archer doesn't even need to use UBW to defeat Gil. He can just snipe him while Gil is fighting someone else using GoB.  <br> Before the Types he wasn't anything special. <br><br>Wasn't he such a big threat in the Liners vs A-Rays war that his own people locked his ass up to rot?</br></br></br>  Repostin':<br><br>Cu V EMIYA = Cu wins due to Protection from Arrows and EMIYA having no way to stop Gay Bulge HOWEVER EMIYA can potentially Caladbolg Cu from a long way away.<br>Cu V Gilgamesh = Gilgamesh wins due to Enkidu and probably sword spamming Cu to not let him Gae Bolg.<br>Cu V Medusa = Could go either way. Cybele should be able to immobilise Cu who needs to look at his target to Gae Bolg them.<br>Gilgamesh V Herakles = Enkidu holds down Herakles pretty damn well, and plus Herakles was protecting Ilya at the time.<br>Medusa V Herakles = I can't see Herakles losing.<br>Iskander V Herakles = Tough one. On the one hand, it's Herakles. On the other, Iskander might be able to kite him around the battlefield with his chariot while his army slowly whittles away Herakles' lives. Maybe.<br>Cu V Iskander = Could go either way. If Cu dodges and weaves in between Iskander's army to finally reach Iskander, he could then use his runes to 1v1 Iskander into a duel which Iskander would certainly lose. However, Iskander could simply use his chariot to kite Cu around the battlefield while his army takes Cu down. Cu might be able to theoretically defeat Iskander's army but eh. The problem is Iskander won't let Cu cast Gae Bolg even once, but Cu still has a fair chance.<br>Medusa V Iskander = Cybele. Nuff said.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>B-But then what did he do with Slash Emperor?</br>  <br> vampires <br>They don't need mana. They need human blood to restore their genetic code.<br> The Dead Apostles suck blood because they need it to stay alive. Immortality is a strain on their originally-human bodies. The genes that compose their bodies are different... when they become vampires, they begin to degenerate at an incredible rate. To make up for that, they must drain the blood of others in order to absorb genetic information and stabilize their own bodies. To a vampire, drinking blood is not like eating, but it's the minimum requirement for them to continue to exist. </br></br></br>  <br> Cu wins due to Protection from Arrows and EMIYA having no way to stop Gay Bulge <br><br> and probably sword spamming Cu to not let him Gae Bolg. <br><br>You don't see the contradiction there?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>30% is her own power. The 100% power doesn't depend on her hair, it depends on how strong her bloodlust is.<br><br>So having 30% base stats or 100%, makes for a huge difference.</br></br></br>  <br>He slayed pussy.</br>  <br> You don't see the contradiction there? <br>You don't see the bit about Enkidu right before that?</br></br>  <br>But if Gilgamesh can prevent Gae Bolg with sword spam, as you said he could, then so could EMIYA, since he spams faster.</br>  <br>Wednesday a cute. A cute!</br>  <br>By that logic Arc would be dead in Extra when the world was drained off mana.</br>  <br>Worst day and worst girl all in one.<br>WEDNESDAY A SHIT.<br>A SHIT!</br></br></br>  <br>Gilgamesh has TWO ways to stop Gae Bolg. It's the combination of them that would make Cu almost helpless.</br>  <br>Honestly, she probably should be.

I don't remember the name but that one had a different picture every time. In this case I'm assuming it's a slightly related old reference.

Or is it QUALITY-infested again?</br>    And next week   never read into the manga this far <br> dat plot twist  <br>HYPE</br></br>    I laughed the most for the realistic close-up shot of sukonbu.  <br> the most fanservice Gintama has is of male characters. </br>  <br>There's fanservice of the female characters too though.</br>  <br>Is Gintoki the worst executioner of all time? One of the people he tried to execute even came back in the current manga arc.</br>  Now that I think about it, wasn't there a law against carrying swords in Gintama?  <br>For most people yes. But people affliated with the Bakufu or with a certain status (like the Yagyus) are permitted to keep their swords. Everybody else are screwed.</br>  <br>Of course government people would be allowed to. But the Reaper was walking casually around the town with a sword, without trying to hide it, even before the murders started. That should have made her stand out even more.</br>  <br>There are also supposed to be Amanto walking around everywhere. It's best not to pay too much attention to what's supposed to make sense in Gintama.</br>  <br>The arc where they make them all go back was too racist to print, so they skipped it.</br>  <br>back home*</br>  I need more Kondo butt  Sudoku    <br>Wow, that the fuck.</br>  Hopefully this arc will have a good ending unlike the others this season.  <br>It will.</br>  <br>Based Yabuki.</br>  <br>A lot of people walk around without the permission to carry swords. I'm not sure why, but I guess they only really care if you get caught using it by the police.</br>  Right now I'm starting the anime and plan on just reading the manga when I get to the last episode (so far) and then watching each episode. Is the anime pretty close to the manga?  <br>Latest chapter in the manga is 548, while the anime is jumping around animating the chapters from 400-500, shifting around the order of arcs.</br>  <br>Then so episode 1 is around chapters 400-500? Or do you mean that lately they're jumping around chapters?</br>  <br>With the newest season. Current season starts with episode 266, but is actually animating chapter 484, and then jumps around animating chapters in the early-mid 400s.</br>  Does anyone have the media player classic opening screen versions with Gintoki?  <br>So basically the best way would be to watch until the newest season, then start reading manga from there?</br>  <br>Or watch until you're caught up and then read from chapter 411, which is the earliest unanimated chapter.</br>  <br>Sounds good. My biggest concern is that I don't want to get confused with the plot or anything like that.</br>  Is that a new ost track at the end?<br><br>It's kind of great.</br></br>  <br>Lucky for you, most arcs and chapters self-contained stories, but there are serious arcs and chapters that do advance the plot and provide important backstories.</br>  <br>They played it during the episode too didn't they? It must be this arcs theme.</br>  <br>futa theme &gt; shinigami theme</br>   mfw i heard asaemon's voice   <br> seconding this</br>  <br>It starts at 21:02. I so want a full version.</br>          <br>Will she appear again? Too bad her episode is meh</br>  I know this line is sort of a meme, but Goku never actually said this right?  <br>It's probably because of all the times that Krillin has died in the series.</br>  <br>He said the line when he fought Nappa but instead of Krillin he said Yamcha, Tien, and Chiaotzu</br>  When does Gintama become 16:9?<br>I'm on around episode 100.</br>  <br>I thought he said it to Frieza? My memory of Dragonball is pretty bad though</br>  <br>after 201 i think</br>  <br>Yeah, this</br>  <br>You should be all good if you are watching the newly-made BDs. We all watched it on an even lower res</br>  Asaemon a cute, A CUTE.  <br>gintama is super interesting</br>  <br>Marina Inoue is perfect for her.</br>    Jesus Christ pls tell me Asaemon will show up again. Only one episode and she's already best girl.  <br/>  <br>This is her arc, so you're gonna have plenty of Asaemon<br><br> Doujins of Asaemon never </br></br></br>  <br>Might as well start reading To love ru, just for the fanservice  and Momo </br>  <br>Wait, so there are arc that actually explain this ?<br>I thought the meme "katsura did his job" is a joke.</br></br>  <br>It's a joke</br>  <br>Gintama with this art style<br>Would it be better or not?</br></br>  This episode felt oddly cinematic.<br><br>Also, did the seppuku scene in the beginning remind anyone else a bit of the seppuku scene at the end of Hyouge Mono?</br></br>  <br>Don't know, but someday i want Hasemi Saki to draw a Gintama chapter and Gorilla one of To Love-ru</br>  <br>The only thing i can point of this episode being kinda odd are the dialogues, if you pay attention you can see that they have some pauses, like they were reading the script and then talk and so</br>  <br>they've been saving their budget lately, hopefully they'll improve the action scenes since this arcs big fight was pretty underwhelming in the manga</br>  <br>I didn't mean odd in a negatively, there was just a striking difference in the overall composition of the entire episode compared to a normal episode. It reminded me of that scene in the Four Devas are where Gin finds Otose bleeding and other similar "serious" moments.</br>  <br>Maybe they just wanted to emphasize the seriousness of this arc</br>  <br>I suppose so.</br>  <br>In between all of the cut-off nipple jokes, right?</br>  <br>I felt those were out of place as well</br>  <br>Gintama frequently has physical comedy jokes near the start of its serious arcs. See Tsukuyo's first appearance and all the kunai hitting Gintoki.</br>  <br>I remember that joke actually being funny though</br>  <br><br>Best ED</br></br>  How come this series manages to keep this high quality so many episodes in? It really blows my mind.  <br>Yeah, I was just thinking to myself how this episode looked surprisingly good<br>You never really hear that Gintama sells great, but it must do pretty well for itself.<br>I suppose I should check out more sales threads</br></br></br>  When will Gintoki stop acquiring new members for his harem?  <br>I don't know about the anime, but the manga sells decently, while the real profits come from the merch sales.</br>  How come anime never mentions capital punishment?  <br><br>The manga is pretty popular sales-wise, but it varies as to where it places in the WSJ rankings. <br><br>However it's one of those weird cases where it could be said that the anime is more popular than the very source material it's based on</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gintama makes enough money  thanks fujos <br><br>Is a respected title too</br></br></br>  <br>About that</br>  <br>He really fucking does look like a gorilla.</br>  <br>Wait before you see under his hakama.</br>  <br>She hasn't shown up after this arc in the manga.

We're getting the Shogun Amnesia arc (not assassination).</br>  Betting on him coming back with a new arm after this, don't think he's dead. He'll just keep on getting mutilated.  This still pisses me off.  <br><br> Lala's VA is female Gintoki </br></br>  How many gonna be pissed when this arc is eventually animated?  <br><br>All comes together</br></br>  <br><br>He probably moved his organs around like last time.</br></br>  <br>Probably.

We're getting the Shogun Amnesia arc (not assassination). <br><br>That's like one episode for Katsura's part of it.</br></br></br>  <br>But he's lost to Gintoki, and now to Hijikata and Kondo. He's suffering villain deflation. Is he going to end up fighting Shinpachi?</br>  <br>Hopefully not, but he's not as threatening as he should be. Kinda a shame.</br>  <br>Or two, depending on how they space it out. Still, it's actually an important arc despite not being serious at all.</br>  Who voiced Asaemon?  <br>It would be hilarious for Shinpachi to fight and defeat him, but hopefully he manages to make some kind of recovery to become threatening again, but that's unlikely.</br>  <br>Marina Inoue.</br>  <br>who's that next to toshi</br>  <br>Nagakura Shinpachi.</br>  Think we can keep this going until the spoilers arrive?  <br>There's always more jokes in the earlier parts of the serious Gintama arcs.</br>  <br>Hijikata looks like a bro<br>would eat mayonnaise with all day</br></br>  i got boner  <br>Isn't she Kyubey?</br>  <br>That's Orikasa Fumiko (Rukia of Bleach's VA).</br>    <br>I know i will, first time that Gintoki says something that every girl (even i, no homo) wants to hear</br>  <br>Can't handle him getting ship tease with the best choice?</br>  <br>Pretty much, yes. But Gorilla like to troll us the fuck out</br>  <br>Guess you'll have to live with that.

I hope you guys are going to follow Kuusen Madoushi. I expect fun and comfy threads. Maybe Mahouka bros too since Kanata is going to be Onii-sama of the season.  <br>I speak another language too, english isn't even my native tongue. I just don't speak Japanese. Could you stop spamming this into every thread you go?</br>  <br>Please note that your other languages are irrelevant in the context of English imageboard about Japanese anime. <br><br>Also, I'm not spamming it.

Everyone knows what EOP means. <br><br>But yes, you're right, strictly speaking it's not chosen too well because of people like you.</br></br></br>  <br>I actually dropped it because MC was no fun allowed moralfaggot to the max, couldn't care less for wehter he's doing it alone or with a group because in the end he was the one who saved the day anyway</br>  <br>I REMEMBER if you know what I mean.<br><br>Per my fantasy battle harem interest, I'm of course all over this.</br></br></br>  <br>It definitely wouldn't be hard to do, depends if anyone feels it's worth the effort.</br>  <br>Black of course</br>    <br>Buttslut of the series?</br>  <br>The best.</br>    <br>Infinite Stratos?</br>  <br>With better characters</br>  Is the MC good?<br>I mean if terms of interacting with female cast</br>  <br> Simulcast: FUNimation (Schedule TBA) <br>Fucking dropped<br>Sure is a good way for me to know what I'm watching or not</br></br></br>  How censored will it be?  Looks like typical fantasy harem academy shit show.<br><br>I had enough of them when finishing absolute duo and I REMEMBER.</br></br>  <br>I'm guessing the nude scenes will be censored, everything else gonna be fine though.</br>  <br>What else you would watch this show otherwise though?</br>  <br>He's great.</br>  <br>What else you watch? Pretty much half the season are all FUNimation sub.</br>  <br>Not him but<br> entertaining MC <br> entertaining girls <br> possible interesting fights </br></br></br></br>  <br> not liking based harem battle genre </br>  <br>What the fuck? This is the exact same set up as Chrome Shelled Regios.<br><br>Am I being trolled?</br></br></br>  <br><br>See <br/></br></br>  <br>Don't respond to ircshits</br>  <br>We also got Seirei Tsukai and World Break so I have my hopes up. ZR, sidetail, redhair; muh body is ready.</br>  <br>Attack on Titan is exact like Chrome Shelled Regios<br><br>this one is exact as "insert generic Dengeki Bunco LN"</br></br></br>  <br>A lot of blue haired chicks. Middle-left and bottom-right as you can notice are sisters</br>  <br>What the fuck FUNimation has to do with your choice of show though</br>  <br>I can kill a number of filthy Jews than wasting my ~6 hours of watching garbage.</br>  We ded now?  Tell me this show is shit do I don't have to watch it. I'm not really in the mood for a generic harem right now but if it's decent I'll give it a try.  <br>Then why aren't you hunting now? Why are you here?<br><br>Episode didn't even air yet.</br></br></br>  <br>How we are suppose to know it? All LNs are shits but anime are sometime entertaining. Wait for subs</br>    10 minutes  <br>Isnt there a manga scanlation though. Let me check em a bit.</br>  5 mins get in here fags  <br><br> FUNimation <br>haha, I'd expect no less from the kings of generic haremshit title licensing</br></br></br>  topkek        <br>Everything is FUNimation now. So you should learn Japanese by next year.</br>  <br> Everything is FUNimation now. <br>that's because everything in generic haremshit now</br></br>        <br>This the new IRC shit post? sure looks like it. <br><br>If not IRC some faggot mexican is just literally asking for a mexicowide ban,</br></br></br>  Who writes this shit, seriously it's like they have the brain of a 13 year old  <br>There are a lot of currently airing shows that aren't generic haremshits<br>You're just a retard</br></br>  So this is where the world break budget went.    The toast in mouth and run into each other cliche, seriously?  <br>Easiest way to check which anime irc shitposts is checking gookslut's current trip and name</br>    <br><br>Already AOTS.</br></br>  So cliché  <br> watching generic harem LN <br> not expecting cliches <br>Are you stupid?</br></br></br>    <br>They could at least try to spice it up a bit.<br><br> Although it wouldn't be generic then </br></br></br>      Can't wait for my LN harem garbage this season. Felt dry last season because Danmachi was way too good.  MC gives no fuck  <br>What's up with all the white brightness? first to love ru deletes all the shadding and now this ?</br>  <br> The Ultra Popular Work <br><br>Haha, he got me there.</br></br></br>    <br> All LNs are shits <br>Heh, don't generalize like that, m8, you must think every LNs are just generic battle harem or generic romcom, huh</br></br>  <br>And how is an EOP supposed to know what LNs are like?</br>  So generic it hurts  That was generic as hell but enjoyable too.  <br>and it will probably sells more than your favourite series</br>  Confirmed Muv-Luv TE 2.0?  Just like in KC, CGI models  <br>Or Black Bullet.</br>  <br>In his mind<br> Why even trying to get girls <br> This is generic harem battle LN <br> Suffering </br></br></br></br>  Tits next week  http://folderman.mobi/s/fm26115.gif<wbr><br><br>Can't webm from phone</br></br></wbr>    <br>I wait for this. I prepare for another world break hypes.</br>  <br> Not posting panties for dual ribbons </br>    So which you like better? Original designs  or mouretsu-movie alike redesigns?  <br>Wow the budget increase seems substantial.</br>  <br>Forgot a pic</br>  OP: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>x8lk6</wbr>  <br>Like most LN adaptations, the original art is better. Although, I don't dislike the anime's style.</br>  Anyone who watched the anime, tell me is it funny as the manga? Are the MC not totally Beta?  <br>According to Funi schedule, this is should be out in about 40 minutes although I guess HS doesn't know about it.</br>  what sub group is picking this up? I need to dl it for science  <br>No group has said anything yet. So we're stuck with HShit for now.</br>  <br>He was in his underwear and the girl was the one blushing.</br>  <br>He seems laidback</br>  <br>dont say that man ;_;</br>  <br>HS is fine, Funi is the problem.</br>  <br> tfw Funi licensed more than half of summer <br> that's gonna make them delay shows even more <br>It really fucking sucks.</br></br></br>  <br>This one bit more bland. It's more colorless and also the current anime put more effort in shadowing, imo. So in short i liked the current anime better.</br>  <br>Manga. Both LN and anime look like shit.</br>  It's out.<br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>09402</wbr></br>  <br> tfw its raw and you cant into moonrune ;_; </br>  Now can wait for actual show of the day, Umaru-chan. 40 min dammit, this shit barely moved time.  <br>Where do you think HS got it. It's from funi too.</br>  <br>Why is this slut spreading her legs?</br>  <br>Pleby please.</br>  so if MC is supposedly so based does he even do anything? All I see is generic shit about the girls  <br>So she can cover her chest.</br>  <br>Because otaku care about girls not MC</br>  <br>He doesn't really give a fuck. He's too god damned lazy to act alpha or beta.</br>  <br>He kills insects and doesn't afraid of anything.</br>  ED: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>x8pb4</wbr>   Generic tsundereshit main heroine <br><br>Into the trash it goes.</br></br>    <br>Why do they always have to include Kirito clones into these. I want to like this because of the girls, but the chuuni self-insert protagonist is probably going to ruin it.</br>  It seems episode 1 is up on Funi site.<br><br>http://www.funimation.com/shows/sky<wbr>-wizards-academy/videos/official/fi<wbr>reteam-e601</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Any estimate till HS rips it? I was just going to watch it raw.</br>  <br>Funi releases from HS on the last few days out around 1-2 hours after it's out on Funi.</br>  <br><br>Go back to Symphogear, Nanoha and Valkyrie Drive. We have our territory, you have yours.</br></br>  <br>He fucked up something important in past and now is ostracized</br>  Its shit?  Is this the absolute shit of the season?  <br>If you watched just for girls you can just watch yuri anime and be satisfied. Why does you feel disturbed by male beta mc in your favourite yuri animu?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12778360 <br>  its shit <br>It is shit!!!</br></br>  s02 of chrome shelled regios is here?    I don't understand why this anime even exists.    <br>BECAUSE <br>IT'S COMMERCIAL FOR LIGHT NOVEL</br></br>    <br>I thought light novels were just scripts for cartoons.</br>    <br>They usually have simple writing, unless it's Nisio kanji wankery/other chuunishit. But adaptation is only is for popular or if publisher thinks it has potential</br>  <br> The story is set in a world where humanity, driven off the land by the threat of magical armored insects, now live in aerial floating cities. <br>Why are humans in the future always pussies in anime?<br> a bunch of women and ladybois went into hiding instead of taking swift action to kill the insect threat immediately once they presented the faintest shadow of a threat to humanity </br></br></br>  <br>Don't nips have better stuff to promote?</br>  <br>Not when the LN industry is a cashcow. Not many authors even care about their adaptation, it's just a promotion.</br>  <br>This is anime.<br>Its either giant robots or girls.<br> or guys for fujoshits </br></br></br>  <br>What else LN publishing company should promote? It's their money</br>  <br>Nope, this was a top trend on twitter when the episode aired.</br>   新しい物語を作ろう。 <br> 新しい </br>    <br>Cultural marxists in the west convinced governments bugs and people can coexist. Isolated Nippon had to resort to plan b which is the sky town things.</br>    <br>So, the "bugs" are actually shitskins?</br>  Seems like the MC is a cool guy, will continue to watch  <br>based la la larks</br>  <br>  What else LN publishing company should promote? <br><br>Obviously, by stuff I meant "LN". You know, better LNs, not so fucking generic. There should be more imaginative writers than that.</br></br></br>  So fucking bad that I'll pick up the show.  <br> Implying they want that. <br>Why take a gamble at animating a not generic LN with a not generic cast and not generic setting and plot when you can go full generic and cash in on the merch and BDs?<br>For something to become generic it at to have done something right in the past to reach this point, so why stop using the formula now, when there's still money to be made?</br></br></br>  Is this two cour?  More LN battle harem garbage. Can't wait.  <br> comes into a generic haremshit thread <br> says this <br>no kid, you're retarded</br></br></br>   [AHSH] Kuusen Madoushi - 01 [720p].mkv   <br>24 episodes + movie</br>  <br>What a leap of logic. <br>That person said there's a lot of shows which aren't haremshit and you said absolutely nothing but 'says this' when he's right.<br><br> that's because everything in generic haremshit now <br>Is retarded and completely incorrect even as an exaggeration.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that's some weird fucked up perspective. her legs look like a second pair of arms</br>  <br>  Why take a gamble at animating a not generic LN with a not generic cast and not generic setting and plot when you can go full generic and cash in on the merch and BDs? <br><br>Never considered that perspective. Thank you for enlightening. However, Japanese somehow come up with the weirdest stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>POV shots are weird.</br>  holy shit this looks like such low quality garbage. i mean you'd expect shit QUALITY like this at episode 7 or 8 of a 24 episode run, but goddamn at episode 1? not even picked up. pre-emptively DROPPED. fuck this trash  <br>that's not it. this is straight up HOW DUR I ANATOMY A POTATO level shit</br>  <br><br>Holy shit<br><br>How does horse shit like this get the funding?</br></br></br></br>  Oh look another Matsuoka MC. Jesus fucking christ is he the poster boy for shit LN MCs now? I used to like the guy for his quirky personality on radio but hearing his voice now makes me want to kill someone. His pigeon-holing makes pre-2010 Kugimiya look like fucking nothing.  <br>It's confirmed 12 eps anon.</br>  ded  カナタ先輩最強？  <br>What nude scenes? The manga only has 2chapters. What is the source material if this? Does it have a LN?</br>  <br>Nigga, are you joking?<br>The thread is filled with LN talk and artwork posting and you're wondering if it has a LN?<br>What harem isn't based on a LN nowadays?</br></br></br>  Why do we always have something like this every single fucking season?<br>Come on, at least try.</br>  <br>If you see an anime not made by KyoAni, chances are it's a LN adaption.</br>  I FUCKING HATE KIRITOS VOICE<br>I FUCKING<br>HAAAAAATEEEEE IT<br>HIS VOICE IS LITERALLY NORMALFAG<br>GOD.</br></br></br></br>  <br>how is this?</br>  <br>You make it like the majority of anime each season are like this, which is not.<br>Yes, studios always try every season.<br>Shits will always be produced. If you don't like it, there's always better anime to watch.</br></br></br>  <br> red head magic user <br>Is my nigga Kazuma in this too?</br></br>  <br>I used to ask this question too but think about it<br><br>New kids are being born, growing older and getting into anime every year. Those shitty harem garbage you hate could be the Love Hina or Negima to someone else.</br></br></br>  I want Yellow to be best girl because of those swords she's dual wielding, but she's just not doing much for me except the voice. Black seems like a good runner up, I'm hoping for some smug shots from her. MC doesn't seem to be all that bad, he's even got based Kirito's voice.  All the girls are shit so far but the MC is hilarious  Well that was boring, it needs to be more like World Break and less like Absolute Duo  <br>Now that I think about it, Nisekoi will be considered "classic romance manga" by kids.<br>Oh god the horror.</br></br>   124 loss streak <br> we recommend you leave the school voluntarily <br>My sides.</br></br>  <br>I don't think it's possible Anon, World Break was just too good. It can't just be topped by any random generic battle harem. Maybe someday we'll get something similar enough to be just as fun, but until then all we can do is wait.</br>  So, what is deal with everyone and their mother saying MC is a traitor ? From what we have seen in the beginning, he was making a heroic sacrifice more than a betrayal. Even that Leader who looks like a hard professional, adresses him highly unprofessionaly as a traitor.  <br> Black Master Swordsman <br>Guts?</br></br>  <br>Mai dick.</br>  <br>The point is to make our MC into a tragic hero to draw in the self-insert otaku crowd.</br>  QUALITY THE ANIME  Misora a shit. A SHIT.  <br> THK already starting that </br>  <br>Come on now. For once in your life, can't you find some other show to bother?</br>  So where do new anime actually air? Is there some anime version of nexflix or something? Or is it paytv-like?<br>Yes, im serious</br>  <br>Fuck off kid.<br><br><br><br>Kill yourself summer.</br></br></br></br></br>   sacrifices himself <br> MC U TRAITOR LOL <br> TRAITOR ECCHI TRAITOR <br><br>What the fuck am I watching?</br></br></br></br>  <br>good taste THK</br>  <br>What's the problem?</br>  that was shit, also this <br><br> why is this season so shit? </br></br>  <br>It happened last time too.</br>  Unsurprisingly this thread is full of shit taste  <br>I read the manga hopeful to get some answers, I suggest you don't try that.</br>  I hope the anime will promote the start of LN translation.  Redhead turned into shittiest girl in less than 3 seconds.  So whats the story behind the traitor shit? Obviously shit happened after his self sacrifice bullshit.  <br><br><br> muh boogeyman </br></br></br>  <br> 6 mins in and Red isn't even anywhere in sight <br>THK pls just go.</br></br>  He is a traitor because everyone think he just ran away. Only the people who were there know he saved them.<br><br>Jesus you people are retarded.</br></br>  <br> muh meme </br>  <br>And they don't tell everyone the truth because...?</br>  <br><br>You got proven in the last Kuusen Madoushi thread, THK. I know your autism won't allow you to leave, so we just have to deal with your 24/7 shitposting.</br></br>  <br>You mean the THK believers got BTFO.</br>   fighting big insects as it were a life or death matter <br> guy gets called a traitor for no reason instead of his friends who pussied out <br> bunch of quality <br>Man, and I thought Classroom Crisis was bad.</br></br></br>  <br> He is a traitor because everyone think he just ran away. <br> Only the people who were there know he saved them. <br><br>this doesn't really make sense, if everyone that was there during the battle knew what really happened then why would everyone else think something like that?<br>they just decided it was funny to report an infamous lie to put their friend in a bad situation?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> believers <br> Implying we are your followers <br>You give yourself too much credit.<br> BTFO <br>Only you did.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> muh delusions </br>  Misora is fine. Y'all need to ignore shitposters and trolls least you guys want bad threads.   wows u such a pervert senpai <br> i bumped into you and my jam bread is on your crotch <br> senpai u ecchi!!!!!!!! x___o <br><br>Jesus fuck, red head couldn't be anymore retarded, hope those bugs deflower her and use her a procreation tool.</br></br></br></br>  Why so many blue haired chicks?  <br>Misora is poop. Worst tsundere of 2015 already.</br>  <br> muh meme <br> muh boogeymen <br> muh delusions  <br>Looks like you're done going through all of your favorite stockphrases.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just like you.</br>  <br> Jesus you people are retarded. <br>bad news! you are one of these people</br></br>  <br> stop hating my generic tsundere </br>  and i thought the manga would explain some lore, all i got was girls who look like clowns and mad quality<br><br>no hope for this anime</br></br>  <br> want bad threads <br>I have not once seen threads that THK posts in that didn't go bad. And that's regardless if people ignore or feed him.</br></br>  Red head makes this bitch look good.  LNshit just gets worse and worse<br><br>Stupid nip teenagers just keep eating this shit up so they can self insert as harem man #9782 and go on a power fantasy cum quest<br><br>That synopsis sounds so fucking generic and dumb I would be seriously impressed if the "writer" is over the age of 14</br></br></br></br>  <br> aerial combat mages <br>HA-HA-HA</br></br>  <br>This thread is already pretty bad, mate. I can't see hope for World Break-like atmosphere and fun threads at all.</br>  <br>NO.</br>  <br>Imouto was perfect, you fag. Pure deredere</br>  <br> Hates Red <br> Hates even hohoho imouto <br>Commendable shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br>Pink was good. Red is utter shit though.</br>  <br>I can tell you right now World Break's first episode &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kuusen Madoushi's first episode. Even for battle harem standard, Kuusen Madoushi is sub-par. I don't mind cliches at all, but even the cliches in this show grates me a fair bit.</br>  <br><br>Someone will pick this up right?<br><br>I want to watch this for the cute red girl but im not going to suffer though funishit, I cant believe people actually watch and pay for that garbage</br></br></br></br>  <br>Both Misora and Satsuki are cute and love. Fight me, pleb.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127791492 <br>But I said she was good?</br>  <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>09433</wbr></br>  I actually enjoyed worldbreak first ep, it had a cool fight at least. This shit was a dragged fucking character intro.  <br>Is that even a real group?</br>  <br>They probably died. People really need to have things spelled out for them, huh. I guess editors are right when they think Viewers are Morons.</br>  <br><br>Who the hell cares?</br></br>  <br><br><br>Well if they're dead I guess he didn't really save them did he?</br></br></br>  <br>bait</br>   Checking around for spoilers and whatnot <br> LNfags say the LN is actually pretty decent <br>So this will be another series that will end up viewed poorly because of awful adaptation.</br></br>  <br> Campione, Unlimited Fafnir, World Break etc <br>Every battle harem adaptation ever.</br></br>  <br>Reminder that World Break was good only because they were unable to do a proper adaptation so they just had fun with it.<br><br>This looks like the average adaptation of a generic LN.</br></br></br>  So, black &gt; blonde &gt; red, agreed?<br><br>Not even shitposting, it just seems like Misora is a carbon copy of Claire.</br></br>  <br>Which doesn't mean he is a traitor. There will probably have a backstory episode where he explains why he is called traitor, or a novelfag will come and spoil the whole shit. People in this thread are really impatient.</br>  <br>Red &gt; Black &gt; Blonde</br>  <br>It's a funi rip.</br>  The MC is pretty great in my opinion, I'm glad he isn't a screaming and blushing generic retarded harem protag  <br>Blonde &gt; Black &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shit &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Red<br><br>Official ranking.</br></br></br>  <br>Black &gt; Red &gt; Blond<br><br>I really can't stand these airheads and shy girls anymore. I'd rather have violent tsundere, as bad as those are.</br></br></br>  <br> copy of Claire <br>That's a good thing fag.</br></br>  wow how long has it been since I've last seen the toast crash  <br>I recognize that bulge!</br>  I enjoyed it a lot, my continued enjoyment will probably depend on how retarded the whole traitor deal is, how fast the plot moves, and how quick this pervert misunderstanding gets cleared up.<br><br>Not sure why everyone seems to be giving the MC shit, all this proves to me is that literally every single harem MC will get shit on unless they're trying to grope and fuck the girls constantly.</br></br>  <br> copy of shit <br> good thing <br><br>Fuck you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're all shit for now, but Black is a lesser shit</br>  How would Evangelion be different if Asuka had been the MC instead of Shinji?  The point of the entire show would be moot.  Third Impact happen on episode 5  <br>It'd still be shit. Fuck off waifufag.</br>  Masturbation, menstruations and insanity  That masturbation scene on the beginning of EoE would be super interesting.  Kaworu would have fixed her.<br><br>Asuka's problem is that she desperately wants to feel loved and has a massive inferiority complex. Kaworu is a being that loves unconditionally, selflessly and completely, and so he would've had a positive influence on her.</br></br>  <br>No it wouldn't.<br>Asuka still has problems making interpersonal relationships without Shinji.</br></br>  <br>Although Asuka has a man's jaw, I don't think that would be enough for Kaworu.</br>  <br> No it wouldn't. <br> Asuka still has problems making interpersonal relationships without Shinji. <br>You missed the joke, I think.</br></br></br>  <br>Kaworu was attracted to the flaws and fragility in people, things like gender are irrelevant to him. Had Asuka been in Shinji's place Kaworu would have probably fallen in love with her all the same.</br>  <br>I thought about it, but I don't think a joke of this magnitude is in order.</br>      <br>they are love rival</br>  <br>More like lovers.</br>  <br>they can love rival eachother while they fuck in the bedroom</br>  <br><br>Dont forget their interactions wouldve been hilarious.</br></br>    <br><br><br>Thanks /a/, now i want this to happen.</br></br></br>  <br>kek, those kids sure are wacky</br>  <br> Not this </br>  <br>who's moot</br>  <br>That's incest, you faggot.</br>   Kaworufags ruin an eva thread before it can even begin <br><br>At least it was a shit premise to begin with.</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>The thread was started by a Kaworufag, you retard.</br>  <br>why she is in the plugsuit?</br>  it would be the same steaming pile of shit  <br>all the children are flawed and have weaknesses. the series wouldn't have been any different, other than rei being a boy instead</br>  <br>Any paring involving Rei is incest since she's the mother of all life</br>  <br>Why not?</br>  I wouldn't give a fuck because Eva would still be the pretentious piece of shit that fanboys eat out of Anno's ass.  <br> Be me <br> Go in thread <br> 'Maybe this will be less cancerous than the last eva thread <br> horriblemistake.jpeg <br><br>Anyway, It would have been more obvious from the beginning that Asuka wasn't really an asshole she was just so fucked up that she had to put up a front and be overly agressive with everyone she met. She probably would have an more obvious arc towards resolving this and Shinji and Rei's passivity would have looked 10x's worse through her lens. <br><br>In a way Shinji is a nice balance between Rei 'no fucks given' Ayanami and Asuka 'SIMPLY THE BEST' Soryu<br><br> Pray that storyboard-chan does not ruin this thread </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She would be a dyke to keep some of the same thematic focus involving sexuality as she lusts after Misato, Rei, and Hikari.</br></br>  <br>How's that butt burn from the last thread treating you?</br>  <br> Hikari <br> flawed <br><br><br>Is it your first day here? Eva threads are usually this cancerous</br></br></br></br></br>  Episode 24 would have been praised as the greatest love story ever told  <br>The Only thing burning my butt would be the liquid shit I took after consuming so many of his tears last night.<br><br>I'm naive and overly hopeful. I do this too myself all the time.</br></br></br>  <br>I recall you leaving the thread with your tail between your legs after you got BTFO consistently. It was pretty funny, but of course no one expects you to admit it.</br>  <br> Not episode 18 </br>  <br>The entire basis for every anime ever would be different.<br><br>Instead of a beta male becoming the main charicture in every anime ever it would be an alpha female.</br></br></br>  <br>It's called sleeping on an Eastern US time schedule. <br><br>Maybe you'll find an interview where Anno calls me lazy or something, butt hurt storyboard-chan.<br><br>Anyway here's your last reply until you actually talk about the topic of the thread because I'm only slightly cancerous unlike your full-fledged, terminal, tumors the size of Giant Rei, pure, unrepentant fucking cancer that you are.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't Touji a Reifag?<br><br><br> implying I'm even the guy from last night <br>Everyone fucking saw it, man. You can't hide it.<br>You're doing exactly what I called you out on, running away and trying to bullshit your way out of the conversation. Again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes but hatesex with Asuka would be better.</br>  <br>Didn't he fuck her in some EoE deleted scene?</br>  <br>It was like shinji thought up a world where he wasn't alive and Touji and Asuka were together.</br>  <br>Yeah. Rei will get dick from no one but Gendo and other ugly old men.</br>  <br>Shinji and Asuka aren't that different, are they? He even acts a little like her the moment he gets a bit of self esteem and a backbone, though that only lasts half an episode before Leliel eats him.</br>  <br>They're two sides of the same coin, suffering with the same problem but choosing to deal with it in two different ways.</br>  <br>Touji is a hikarifag. He's egging Shinji on in this scene.</br>  <br> The point of the entire show would be moot. </br>  <br> Touji is a hikarifag <br>He's literally indifferent to Hikari the entire series. She's such a beta cuck even Fuyutsuki is in awe.</br></br>  <br> Toji <br> Hikarifag <br><br>Pick one.</br></br></br></br>  what if the rebuilds were done by someone other then Anno?  <br>why is the first reply always the best</br>  <br><br>Hikari is awkward as fuck</br></br>  <br><br>Well aside from Hikari, which is implied as like an actual possible pairing. He's an obvious misatofag.</br></br>  <br>Nice hatred towards Rei there Asukafag. <br><br>Jesus, Asuka is the one into old man dick, not Rei.</br></br></br>  <br>This is technically true, the best kind of true.</br>  <br> Asuka is the one into old man dick, not Rei. <br>?</br></br>  <br>She wins the Shinji in some shit video game<br><br><br>She is cute as fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're into something else now</br>  <br> She wins the Shinji in some shit video game <br>No she doesn't. The game ends with Shinji regaining his memories and apologizing to Hikari for kissing her, and the world goes back to normal.</br></br>  <br>Rei is the only heterosexual in the entire franchise.</br>  <br>Well, he got farther with her than Toji ever did.<br><br>Still, holy shit that sounds terrible, why the fuck did an amnesiac Shinji sudden get the hots for the blandest female in the franchise</br></br></br>  <br>Funny joke</br>  <br>Not Rei.</br>  <br>Well no shit, since Touji couldn't give less than two shits about her. He was all about Rei and Misato, but since Anno hates him he forced him with Asuka in the EoE dream world.<br> Shinji sudden get the hots for the blandest female in the franchise <br>The game came out around when episode 13 aired to be fair. A lot of shit about it is inconsistent with the show.</br></br></br>  <br>It would be a shitty shoujo</br>  Why does Misato get so little love?  <br>In the series, Asuka begs Kaji to fuck her, even starts undressing.</br>  <br>Don't worry, Toji gets  a loli  Rei in  Anima <br><br>The game sounds fucking weird. It's first impression, right? The only Eva games I've played have been those GoS VN and I'm trying to emulate NGE2 but it emulates like ass and it's all in moonrunes so I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. All I know is that I made best girl Maya blush</br></br></br>  <br> mfw no doujins where Asuka and Mari teach Rei about degeneracy </br>  <br>Because people like to be cucked by a cunt or autistic dolls</br>  <br>Where?</br>  <br>Kaji isn't an old man though.</br>  <br>Gunbuster wasn't a shoujo</br>  <br>In Anima the loli Rei loves Kaworu like she does in Puchi Eva. For some reason this is a thing because of that one scene in Death and Rebuild.</br>  <br> The purest form of love <br> degeneracy <br><br>But yes, I'd pay good money to see that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well it's Kaworu, of course his cock is getting sucked by everyone.</br>  <br>Yes, degeneracy</br>  <br>Why are they perfect for each other?</br>  <br><br> degeneracy </br></br>  <br>is that candy corn?</br>    <br>wut<br>no it isn't retard</br></br>  <br>Yes it is you pleb. Rei and Kaworu are technically siblings, they even have the same parents: the FAR.</br>  <br>No, it's rat poop</br>  <br> implying Asuka is alpha </br>  <br>In ep 22 on the aicraft carrier.</br>  <br>You're a moron. By your logic all Lilith-based life is incest anyway.</br>  <br> You're a moron <br>Nigga, it's fact. Why else do you think Rei and Kaworu look so fucking similar?<br> all Lilith-based life is incest anyway <br>It is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rei's body is mostly based on Yui's.</br>  why did they use children to pilot the eva's again?  <br>it's supposed to be because children wouldn't have had enough horrible experiences that they'd have trouble syncing with the Evas. but obviously that doesn't end up being true.</br>  <br>Because the Evangelions have a human soul inside them, and typically the only compatible pilots are the child of that soul.<br><br>Rei and Unit-00 are a special case.</br></br></br>  <br>She was created by the same thing(s) Kaworu was, that makes them brother and sister.</br>  <br>That goes for all of the others as well, since the souls are from them to begin with.<br><br>Fuck off with your retardation.</br></br></br>  <br><br>thank you anons</br></br>  <br> making up shit </br>  <br> Nigga, it's fact. Why else do you think Rei and Kaworu look so fucking similar? <br>They don't look similar besides red eyes.</br></br>  How to fix Evangelion:<br><br>Remove Mari.<br>Remove Kaworu.<br>Remove Rei Q and any other clone.<br><br>Cut out the retarded pandering shit for Asuka.<br>Stop shitting on characters like Rei just because the writers doesn't like it getting popular.<br><br>Write the rest of the characters seriously, with the intent to make each and one of them good on an individual level.<br><br>Cut out the looping crap. No piggybacking on previous successes or shitty attempts to change it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You what? Lilin and Angels are their children respectively, sure it'd be varying degrees of incest as well; but how the fuck does that invalidate the fact that Kaworu and Rei are siblings?</br>  <br><br> How to fix the Rebuilds <br><br>Eva itself is nearly perfect, don't lump it in with those abominations.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're the only ones with red eyes and the albino-ish white skin for a reason. No other character in the series has such unnatural hair colors and eyes.</br>  <br> hurr de durr <br>Rebuild is Evangelion, as much as you or I might hate it. <br><br>But yeah I'm not referring to the original when I wrote that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The idea that they are siblings is 100% fanwank.<br><br>Nowhere ever is it stated they are siblings, or even implied.</br></br></br>  <br>Rebuild was always intended to be a sequel, they need the looping to explain how that's possible.</br>  <br>rebuild isnt canon</br>  <br><br> Michael Bay's shitshow is Transformers, as much as you or I might hate it. <br><br>Taking something and completely warping it into something new and terrible while still slapping the original name on it doesn't mean it has to be considered to be the same entity as the original.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The idea that they are siblings is 100% fanwank. <br>You're fucking retarded. Adam and Lilith are both made by the FAR, they're the same type of existence; they're siblings. Get the fuck over it. Rei even says he's the same as her twice in the show.</br></br>  <br>It isn't, you're just the type of faggot who laughs at le epigg caps and lots of replies.</br>  <br>They don't need looping, and Rebuild shouldn't be a sequel.<br><br><br>Now you're being autistic, I don't even disagree. Not going to bother replying any more.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They fit easier, and the main reason is the souls bonded to the Eva. Shinji got Eva 1 because his mom was the soul of it, for example.</br>  <br> Rebuild shouldn't be a sequel. <br>But it is. Therefore looping is needed and wanted.</br></br>  <br> waah wahh fanwank <br><br>Kill yourself. I wish I could meet you in real life so I could punch the shit out of your face.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm delusional and choose to ignore things I don't like! <br>Thanks for confirming. <br> I wish I could meet you in real life so I could punch the shit out of your face. <br>You can't even get your fatass off your couch, nigger.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Barking up the wrong tree, I get out, go to work, normie as fuck, and it's no coincidence the ONLY place I meet dipshits like you are here.<br><br>Fucking nobody, and I'm telling you NOBODY spreads shit like you in real life because they know they'll get it, and in real life they don't have an anonymous entity to protect them either.<br><br>Take your fawank, shove it up your ass, and get the fuck out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>except adam and lilith are based on different "seeds" you faggot. it's like having different DNA therefore not blood related.<br><br>take your incestfag shit elsewhere and get lost.</br></br></br>  <br>You are a fucking retarded piece of shit who barely even deserves to live. You are so obviously, clearly wrong in this instance and you still have the nerve to actually pretend you aren't full of shit.<br><br>Let me explain: there is nothing in the series whatsoever that validates your claim what-so-fucking-ever.<br><br>If Kaworu says "you're the same as me", it does not mean they are fucking siblings. Do you even know what a sibling is?<br><br>Have you ever seen some part about them being born of the same parent, growing up or whatever at all in the series or EoE? Anything?<br><br>When Shinji tells Asuka "you're the same as me", does that mean Shinji is Asuka's long lost brother?<br><br>I want you to take at least five minutes to reflect on how fucking retarded you are, and how much better the world would be without you living it. <br><br><br><br>Rebuild is a broken turd. That post explains how to fix it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> lying on the internet <br>How more pathetic can you get?<br><br><br>No shit, both seeds being created by the FAR; which were originally beings who possessed both seeds. <br> it's like having different DNA therefore not blood related <br>They're fucking aliens, you can't use that argument here.<br>Kaworu says they're the same in episode 24, Shinji says they're the same in episode 24, Rei says they're the same in episode 25. Classified information confirms they are akin to siblings.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</br>  <br> all this fanwank <br>top kek</br></br>  <br> samefagging <br>Wow.<br> Have you ever seen some part about them being born of the same parent <br>Classified Information confirms it.<br> If Kaworu says "you're the same as me", it does not mean they are fucking siblings <br>He's literally referring to them being the same type of existence, unlike <br> Shinji tells Asuka "you're the same as me" <br>Where he's talking about their personalities and insecurities.<br>I think you may be autistic. Just because you don't like it doesn't suddenly make it invalid. It's the truth and the fanbase has collectively agreed on it. You're just a delusional, irrelevant minority that absolutely no one gives a shit about.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   thread already long since devolved into lame puns, shippershit and internet tough guying <br>Same as it ever was.</br>  <br>Classified information says no such thing. The rest you said was retarded dumb fanwank that even contradicts the show.</br>  <br>You shouldn't call my ebin sci-fi incest plot fanwank, anon-kun. That's not very nice.</br>    <br>That's not five minutes, you can't even get that right.<br><br>Again, no part of the series confirms or evidences any of the bullshit you just said.<br><br>Noone except you thinks this shit, the fandom collectively agreed you're a huge faggot that these eva threads would be better without. It's absolutely true.<br><br>The only one with autism here is you, since you can't separate a pet theory (one that's debunked) from actual facts and reality. You think that because you like it, it's invalid.<br><br>It's invalid because the series doesn't support it. There is no mention of either being the other's sibling, or anything that would otherwise imply it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Classified information says no such thing. <br>Yes it does. The FAR created Adam and Lilith. This makes them siblings. <br> that even contradicts the show <br>No nigger, it actually supports the events from the show and Rei's own words. Provides a lot more context to Rei and Kaworu's forbidden union in EoE.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yes it does. The FAR created Adam and Lilith. This makes them siblings.  <br><br>The FAR is a race. They are not one entity. Moreover, it doesn't make them siblings just because one entity (which they aren't) created them.<br><br>Nice try though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They would have fucked </br>  <br> filename <br>Fanfiction writer please leave.</br></br>  <br> Noone except you thinks this shit <br>Actually the Japanese and Western fanbases majorly regard Rei and Kaworu as being akin to siblings. Just check Evageeks, they take it as common knowledge.<br> It's invalid because the series doesn't support it.  <br>The series confirms it, and it's directly implied based on their conversation and union in EoE.<br><br><br>If they come from the same entity, they're as much as siblings as an alien race is gonna get. Explains why they look so similar.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The FAR is a whole collective of beings, they are also used in plural, the "First Ancestral Race".<br><br>Now if we, the humans created two new beings, which we do every fucking day, they're not siblings. I'm not your sibling. Any other anon here isn't your sibling.<br><br>You need a common parent and you need to be raised together. <br><br>In NGE, there is no mention of them being siblings.<br>In EoE, there is no mention of them being siblings.<br>In NGE2, there is no mention of them being siblings.<br><br>The classified information you refer to is not supporting you in any way either.<br><br>Take your fanwank somewhere else please.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I look forward to the next movie.  <br> If they come from the same entity, they're as much as siblings as an alien race is gonna get. Explains why they look so similar. <br><br>Yeah, I like how they have the same hair color or facial features. Woops.<br><br>They don't come from the same enity because the FAR is not an entity. It's a whole fucking race. <br><br>They are a humanoid species that live as a race:<br> The humanoid species, referred to as the First Ancestral Race, <br>as explained by the shit you think backs you up.<br><br>There is nothing here that would make them siblings. Since the FAR also created the souls each "seed" carries, that would make everyone siblings forever.<br><br>Your logic is retarded, your idea is retarded, and you're pathetic for thinking anyone except your own little deluded mind buys it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Uh oh. Don't mention Evageeks when storyboard-chan is around. He'll use copypasta from their website to tell you why you're a faggot for using them.</br></br>  <br>Actually the Japanese and Western fanbases don't regard Rei and Kaworu as being akin to siblings. Just check Evageeks, they take it as common knowledge.<br><br> The series confirms it, and it's directly implied based on their conversation and union in EoE. <br>The series doesn't confirm it because there doesn't exist a single reference tot hem as siblings, and their conversation in EoE does not touch the subject whatsoever.<br><br>Seriously, you've shown no proof.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Thread is a what if scenario <br> Fanfiction </br></br>  <br> using the opinions of Evageeks as proof <br><br>You know, are you trolling us right now? How fucked up do you need to be to sink as low as you have?<br><br>Face it, your theory is unsupported, it's shit, doesn't make sense, doesn't add anything to the series, and would even make it a lot worse since it'd make everything even more contrived.<br><br>Do you have some sort of fetish for siblings or something? Why can't you just accept the fact that you're wrong?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is this the same retarded idiot that ruined the evangelion thread yesterday once he got obsessed to prove that Shinji hates Rei or something?  <br> Any other anon here isn't your sibling. <br>Actually that's wrong. We're all related in some manner if we trace back our ancestors.<br> You need a common parent and you need to be raised together.  <br>That's a pretty retarded definition of sibling you have there, the way they are raised has nothing to do with it. It's about genetics solely. Furthermore, to alien beings who don't have shit like genetics and blood-relation, this is the closet we are gonna get: akin to siblings.<br> The classified information you refer to is not supporting you in any way either. <br>Yes, it does. EoE refers them joining as a forbidden union, they are similar in appearance, and regard each other as the same type of lifeform.<br><br><br> It's a whole fucking race.  <br>And yet they're only capable of making two different types of seeds that all act in the same manner since the Dead Sea Scrolls are so reliable. <br> that would make everyone siblings forever. <br>And?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> what if scenario <br> not fanfiction </br></br>   This thread   <br>Why's that? Would Asuka be more forward about her feelings if she was the MC?</br>  <br> Seriously, you've shown no proof. <br>Yes I have, you just keep ignoring it. Why would the union between Adam and Lilith be considered 'forbidden'? Why did Sadamoto bother to make them look so similar?<br><br><br> I don't like it, so it must be wrong! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> We're all related in some manner if we trace back our ancestors. <br>Might as well bust out some Determinism.</br></br>  <br>what is he doing with his left hand?</br>  <br>No because it worked out in his fanfiction.</br>  <br> And yet they're only capable of making two different types of seeds that all act in the same manner since the Dead Sea Scrolls are so reliable.  <br><br>It says there's multiple seeds out there, and even if it didn't, you would be fucking retarded to assume they're the only ones given the scenario.<br><br> And? <br>Because we obviously aren't, neither are they.<br><br>real talk: are you diagnosed with some sort of autism, aspergers or any sort of disorder?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know exactly what he's doing</br>  <br> Actually that's wrong. We're all related in some manner if we trace back our ancestors. <br>That settles it. You don't even know what a sibling is.<br><br>We're done.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey ARK, can you put on your trip and derail this thread, I need it to hit 404 faster.</br>  <br>Kind of how like Shinji became less suicidal and learn to like and love others. Asuka would learn she doesn't to put up a front with everyone and they're relationship would have developed more.</br>  <br>What's there to derail? It started shit and it's still shit.</br>  <br>If you've understood this thread is a what if scenario, then why would he have to leave it? <br>Please go away.</br></br>  <br>No kidding, I'm just hoping some retard starts barking at your trip again because this doesn't look like it's going to 404 anytime soon. It'd be better than shipshit anyhow.</br>  <br>Being a sibling means having a common parent, the familial definition includes being raised together. You're siblings then. <br><br>But you know what, it's obvious you're some sort of shit-tier kaworufag or something who doesn't even know left from right. <br><br>I'm not your fucking sibling, nor are you mine, just because we're both human.<br><br>Again there's just nothing here backing you up whatsoever, so keep your shitty fantasy theory to yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>does he have a hospital fetish or something?</br>  <br> It says there's multiple seeds out there <br>All either possessing fruit of knowledge or fruit of life. There's no variety. They all act the same according to their fruit as the Dead Sea Scrolls state. All the seeds are siblings in this manner.<br><br> Because we obviously aren't, neither are they. <br>In Eva, the lilin are all siblings in some manner; they're made by the same mother. Just like the angels are all siblings in that manner.

Incidentally, he is also the director for the new Berserk movie <br><br> Interviewer asks Toshiyuki what he thinks about it <br><br> Toshiyuki responds by saying that other people told him this too, but (he thinks) it's not just because of iDOLM@STER that Miura suggested him to be the director <br><br> Interviewer says "Well, you say that, but sensei might have thought differently." <br><br> Dumb hag in the middle spews stupid shit <br><br> Interviewer asks Miura who he likes in the franchise <br><br> Miura: "Chi-chan." <br><br> Interview: "I'm sorry, who?" <br><br> Miura: "Chihaya." <br><br> Toshiyuki's face when <br><br> Miura: "I'm sure you can tell from looking at Casca , but I like the fact that Chihaya is stoic." <br><br> Interviewer: "I see. iDOLM@STER and Berserk are connected, in the sense of stoic." </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What does this page even mean? She doesn't want to remember being raped by Griffith so she will want to stay retarded? Or that she might not want to go on Guts' little revenge quest when she comes back?</br>  <br> Or that she might not want to go on Guts' little revenge quest when she comes back? <br><br>I'm leaning more towards that one, but honestly, it's probably some amount of both.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't get excited guys.<br><br>Last thread said that it will include several chapters which are just recaps. This is for new readers. We are only getting ONE actual new chapter so standard 20 pages.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking scum, she's the lamest idol</br>  <br>I was thinking the first. She's been through some fucked up shit, sometimes ignorance is bliss. Imagine being pulled from a state of "happiness" into a living hell.</br>  <br> Miura: "Chi-chan." <br><br> Interview: "I'm sorry, who?" <br><br> Miura: "Chihaya." <br>And here I thought he was talking about best puchi for a second</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://imasnews765.com/?p=2894<br>In a recent Berserk-themed episode of NHK’s MAGNet TV show, Kentaro Miura re-confirmed his love for Idolm@ster. He also mentioned, again, that his favorite girl is Chihaya and that the character Isma was inspired by Hibiki.<br><br>(Fun fact: Isma is an anagram of IMAS.)</br></br></br></br>  <br>i like this page. Roderick at this time was aware of Farnese' fondness of Guts, so he inquires about Guts' relationship with Casca to make sure his bride to be isnt in any danger of being taken by Guts.</br>  <br>forgot image</br>   127783930 <br><br>God Hand: "What kind of life do you want?"<br>Guts: "JUST FUCK MY SHIT UP"<br>God Hand: "Say no more"</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not so sure. I mean yeah, maybe she doesn't want to remember being tortured by apostles, seeing most of the people you ever loved getting eaten, and then being raped by the man you idolized while your bf is forced to watch.<br><br>But I have a hard time believing that she would do that to Guts. He gets to still be (somewhat) sane and relive the pain of the eclipse every day while she gets to fuck around and be ignorant to everything? Maybe if that were the case, she will quickly change her mind once she sees the state Guts is in.<br><br><br>Did we ever get to see what he responded with? Last I remember it cut to Schierke eavesdropping, but we never saw what he said.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  does anybody have the EVERYBODYS GETTIN RAPED!<br>reaction pic with Miura?</br>  <br>I tell ya, The series will take a turn for the worse as Griffith and Guts raise Isma and Schierke to be idols.</br>  <br>DIG UP THOSE SCHIERKE DOUJINS GUYS</br>   Guts activates the Behelit he currently has <br> RIP JRPG party <br> Goes apostle with the berserk armor and fucks Femto's shit up <br> Both end up ded </br></br></br>  <br>being a retard isn't happiness anon</br>    <br>What a way to end the series.</br>   Bersek is back <br> HxH is still on haitus <br>There is no justice</br></br>  <br>thanks bruh</br>  <br> Guts activates the Behelit he currently has </br>  <br>I'm sure she'd understand and accept being "brought back", but it'd take a serious toll on her mental health. I think the idea of that panel is just illustrating that it might be in her best interests if she stayed ignorant. I agree with you though, I think if Casca could consciously choose she'd want to return to her normal self. <br><br><br>Relative to the alternative it sure is. Retards don't know they're retarded.</br></br></br></br>  <br>honestly I hope HxH stays dead. Hearing jilted fans whining incessantly has gotten annoying, hopefully in five more years you guys'll have given up on it and moved on</br>  <br> As a monthly manga <br>I fucking wish, stay in school kidz</br></br>  <br>its officially over bruh,</br>  <br><br>theres just too much going against it right now. if you really pay attention to the story you will see that its not looking good for Guts+Casca<br><br>which makes me a very sad Casca fan.<br><br>no. Farnese shoots back into her body saying that she doesnt want to actually know what their relationship is. and the reader gets left out of the answer as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah but retarded people often get picked on and mistreated. even if they're too retarded to be bothered by the fact that they're retarded, that'll still hurt.</br>  <br> people picking on or mistreating her with Guts around  <br>lmao</br></br>  <br>Bane?</br>  <br> that thing was too big to be called loli butt <br> too big, too thick, too heavy, and too rough </br></br>  <br> King of Midland, I'm Band of the Hawk </br>  <br>Isidro will be a lucky man</br>  So how will Guts (a human) defeat Griffith (a God)?  <br> three times larger and three times heavier than a regular loli butt </br>  <br>Does he get to bring friends?</br>  <br> griffith, you don't get to bring friends <br> these are not my fiends <br> they work for the Evil ones. <br> Godhand? </br></br></br></br>  <br>probably with his sword</br>  <br>By going Berserk™ of course.</br>  <br>Your a big guy.</br>  <br> Bring them up, I'll call it in </br>  <br> but it'd take a serious toll on her mental health <br>She was so traumatized by all the things that happened in the eclipse that she literally went retarded. Her mental health is already down the shitter, I fail to see how it could get worse than that. Yeah, coming back from being retarded for a few years is going to take some time to get adjusted to, considering most of the people she knew are now dead, Griffith is now a grade A asshole, and you are surrounded by people you have never even met before besides Guts. She will have rauma to deal with, but I don't think that she is so mentally weak that she can't recover. Sure, she will never be exactly the same, neither will guts. but that doesn't mean she has to stay severe PTSD-mode forever.<br><br><br>A lot of that seems like it's just Guts being pessimistic. Can't blame him, not a whole lot of good things have happened to him in his life. If they do get back together, it won't be like it was before, because they will both be a little different from their experiences. Just because they won't go right back to fucking as soon as she comes back doesn't mean that there will never be anything between them ever again.<br><br>But who knows, we'll have to wait and see.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not "they work for the Apostle, the immortal swordsman" <br> "Zodd?" </br></br>  <br> there are people who STILL dont get it </br>  <br>For you</br>  <br>WHAT'S A GOD TO A NON BELIEVER<br><br> Sorry, the song is really cool. </br></br></br>  <br>If I take your armor you will die?</br>  <br>GET FUCKED</br>  <br>It's better than reading Nisekoi faggot.</br>  <br>Only if it promises to not be shit when it starts again.</br>  <br>Guts is going to rape Griffith in front of his entire army.<br><br>But the twist will be that this is what Griffith wanted all along. The eclipse, Falconia, all just a ploy to get Guts to seek out Griffith.<br><br>Griffith doesn't want world domination, he just wants Guts' D.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that's fair. The thought of (maybe) actually seeing Casca's return written is making me giddy. That'll be pretty fucking heavy.</br>    <br><br>THE ECLIPSE THAT I JUST PLANNED WITH THE CAUSALITY LISTS ME, CONRAD, UBIK AND DOCTOR SLAN HERE BUT ONLY ONE OF YOU. FIRST ONE WHO SACRIFICES GETS TO BECOME A GOD HAND.</br></br>  <br> you are surrounded by people you have never even met before besides Guts. <br><br>even Guts will unrecognizable to her. her world is going to massively be turned upside down and inside out. monsters roaming everywhere. magic is now a thing, Guts has dead eyes. shes not going to be a strong woman like she once was. maybe over time. a lot of time, she will adjust. but shes not getting back with Guts.</br></br></br>  <br>It will be extremely painful</br>  And how fucking long till on hiatus again? 2-3 chapters? Fuck that.  <br>God damnit, why does this sound true.</br>  <br> Lotta loyalty for a crippled hawk </br>  <br> ubik sitting at the table inside the tree man <br>holy shit that is some serious fucking foreshadowing. Never noticed that before. Falconia is a goddamn trap</br></br>  Casca isn't going to be healed guys, stop with your silly stories.  <br><br>That's Chie Satonaka you weirdos</br></br>    <br><br>What's a God to a non-believer?</br></br>   guts goes to elf king  <br> elf king for whatever reason cannot help him with casca <br> guts genocides elf island in a fit of seething rage </br></br>  <br>An all-powerful entity who can fuck your shit up pretty bad?</br>  <br>Hair decs and the hair is too long. I know my second favorite Persona 4 girl when I see her and brother, that ain't her.</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>That'd make the years we've endured worth it</br>    <br><br>She fucking deserved it.</br></br>  <br>You're such a dumb boy.</br>  <br>Why does he wear that Mask?</br>  <br>gods dont sleep with old men for money</br>    <br>U U U U<br>U U U U <br>U U U U<br>U U U U</br></br></br></br>  <br>How is he going to the bathroom?</br>  <br>She just wanted to be happy with her waifu anon.<br><br>Guts was an edgelord there who used a child as a bait. I cheered against him in that arc.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm glad Guts won</br></br>  <br>Would bang irl Griffith</br>  <br><br>If I pull that egg off, would you die?</br></br>      <br>The fuck is wrong with you, she suffered a lot, her parents were literal shit, she wanted to be happy and have fun.</br>  <br>Did that involve killing a bunch of children and committing necromancy?</br>  <br>Griffith didn't need the money, he just wanted his boypussy fucked</br>  <br><br>I like it when other people are unhappy<br><br>It's normal human behavior, you monster</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She's responsible for countless children dying and half of Griffith's army being eaten.</br></br>  <br>I guess everyone who has a hard life is justified in mass murder, then.</br>  <br> being a homosexual <br> any year </br></br>    <br>Guts killed children too.</br>  <br>Post yfw Berserk MAY actually finish in your lifetime</br>  <br>Exactly, that's why Griffith did literally nothing wrong.<br><br><br>It did.<br><br> But seriously, Rosine had a shitty life, of course I'm not justifying what she did, but still, I wanted her to be happy.<br><br>Besides, her parents reminds me of mine.</br></br> </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Rosine did nothing wrong.</br>       thread went from Berserk to Baneposting     <br><br>Dude her mom wasn't even that bad and still cared about her, she just felt messed up because her daughter was conceived through rape.<br><br><br><br>Guts didn't purposely and actively murder children and allow them to eat and maim others/themselves.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>is that a problem.... hothead?</br>    <br>It shouldn't come as a surprise. Guts is the biggest guy since the silent era</br>  <br>farnese's relationship with guts is like casca's relationship to griffith while they were in the band.<br><br>there's a scene on the boat where farnese is berating retard casca for endangering guts that's a callback to casca berating guts for endangering griffith. <br><br>so basically guts is gonna rape farnese is what im saying</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It would be extremely painful... for you.<br><br>Guts never cared who I was until I put on the falcon mask.</br></br></br>  <br>This guy.</br>   robot fights are real <br> occulus waifus are real <br> America uses robots attack foreigners <br> Berserk is finally starting again <br>WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVEĎ</br></br></br></br>  <br>sure Anon  right after sigma gets animated </br>  <br>..for you</br>  wow i only started reading berserk in january and because i'm such a lazy and i knew that it was never going to finish i'm still only on volume like 26-27.<br><br>i picked a good time to start reading this, feel bad for everyone that's been following this for years.</br></br>  <br>Robot fights have been real for a long time, remember all those shows where they build junky robots and have them beat each other with saws?</br>  <br>Now all that's left is for you to post the source of that image.</br>  imagine being Aidan Gillen in that scene and having to be all like "damn, Bane, you fuckin' big, all sexy with your big guy body and horrific androgynous monster mask. I would totally crash my plane with you, both my character and the real me." when all he really wants to do is bring another friend into his plane.<br>Like seriously imagine having to be Aidan and not only stand in that plane while Tom Hardy flaunts his big body in front of you, the favorable lighting barely concealing his stretchmarks and ripped skin, and just sit there, take after take, hour after hour, while he perfected that line. Not only having to tolerate his monstrous fucking mask but his haughty attitude as everyone on set tells him he's A BIG GUY FOR YOU and DAMN, TOM HARDY LOOKS *THAT* BIG?? Because they're not the ones who have to sit there and watch his mannish fucking gigantic mask covered face contort into types of grimaces you didn't even know existed before that day. You've been fucking nothing but a healthy diet of hotheads and mercenaries and later alleged plane crash victims for your ENTIRE CAREER coming straight out of the boonies in Langley. You've never even seen anything this fucking big before, and now you swear you can taste the sweat that's breaking out on his dimpled bald head as he sucks air through his mask suggestively at you, smugly assured that you are enjoying the opportunity to get paid to sit there and revel in his "statuesque (for that is what he calls himself)" brutishness, the muscle he worked so hard for with personal trainers in the previous months. And then Nolan calls for another take, and you know you could kill every single person in this plane before the agency's security could put you down, but you sit there and endure, because you're fucking CIA. You're not going to lose your future agency career over this. Just bear it. Hide your face and bear it.</br>  <br>I picked berserk and watched the movies 3 weeks ago.<br>What a time to be alive.</br></br>  <br>not really now can reread it for the tenth time and be back up to date when it starts re-releasing</br>  <br>This</br>  <br> He hasn't read the works of Homunculus </br>    <br>Oh my god, I could read this shit without the porn</br>  <br><br> mfw i have no face </br></br>  <br> Griffith <br> Man <br><br>Pick one</br></br></br></br>    <br>You're dumb.</br>  <br><br>What a shit ass time to be alive indeed, I hate all of that</br></br>  <br>He's not wrong though. Griffith isn't human.</br>  I'll believe it when I see it.  <br> hating berserk in a berserk thread <br>GTFO Faggot</br></br>   you will never have a harem of fresh boypussies   <br>He tried his best to find one that could replicate Griffith, it never happened though. He had a hard life.</br>  <br>You're dumb too.</br>    <br> ywn fuck Griffith </br>  <br>DOES THIS LOOK LIKE A MAN</br>  <br>Are you implying something about Jolyne?</br>  <br>WHAT IS A MAN?</br>  <br>I'd let femto rape me any day tbh</br>  <br>Too old.</br>  <br> moron thinks he's funny </br>  <br> Autistic being able to tell what's funny or not <br>Sasuga /a/</br></br>  <br> moron is being random now <br>What a surprise.</br></br>  Is Skull Knight really Emperor Gaiseric or is it a red herring and actually Void? Does every Godhand have a survivor from their sacrifice like Guts?   tfw Miura was actually working this whole time as we made Idolm@ster jokes   <br>You're talking to like 4 different people retard.</br>  <br>I can confirm</br>  <br><br>It's probably not a red herring, it has been hinted at too many times.</br></br>  <br>And all these boypussies are dead. Fuck, why kill everybody? Has kids in this castle too, right?</br>  <br>If this is true, then I'll be so fucking ashamed</br>    <br>Probably the emperor, way too many hints. Will the new chapter be guys getting off the boat or more of Griffith getting bitch slapped?</br>  <br>wait, there's more?</br>  <br>I'm talking to 1 moron. I can't wait until you misuse the word autistic again and fail to be funny again because you're retarded.</br>  Think we'll see the eye again, you know what I'm talking about.<br>What was the last chapter we saw it?</br>    <br>Yeah, okay Hawk!</br>  <br>Stop being dumb.</br>  <br> "I'm sure you can tell from looking at Casca , but I like the fact that Chihaya is stoic." <br><br>Is Casca his best Berserk girl? Does he want the recovery arc to have the feels of the average Chihaya episode?</br></br></br>  <br>Just use your trip it's obviously you.</br>  <br>If she sees Guts the way he is now, do you think she'll let him continue on such a self-destructive path? Even Hellhound knows that she's the one thing keeping Guts from completely surrendering.</br>  <br>Anything to do with getting off the boat would be like a miracle  but miracles make me sick  but seeing anything to do with how Griffith responds to the slap afterwards could give us more insight into his character than ever. <br><br>I just want any development</br></br></br>  <br>she did make an awful lotta retarded decisions in Stone Ocean...namely going to jail in the first place. Actually no, lets examine how she wound up in a position where she could be sent to jail...she was distracting the driver, who then happened to run over a body someone had placed in the road as part of a convoluted plan to send Jolyene to jail. The fact that she actually let Pucci's retarded ass plan work is proof shes a hard tard. still hot though</br>  It's a glorious day indeed. If I had my Guts figure I might've hotglued it out of excitement.  <br>no pls anon i'd feel worse that gutter filth if that was the case   luckily i know thats not the case, since Miura loves his idolmaster  </br>  <br>You're a moron.</br>  <br>What do you think are the chances that Casca will die soon?</br>  <br><br>She certainly was an enjoyable character.</br></br>  <br>So you got yourself caught! Whats the next step of your master plan?</br>     As the manga continued Guts kept looking more and more fucked up <br><br>Man, I just want him to be happy once more.</br></br>  <br>There are no happy endings in Midland.</br>  <br>Guts will never become an apostle.</br>  Slan x Guts Make it Happen Miura.<br><br> Farnese x Guts is fine too </br></br>  <br>I almost made the mistake of ordering this because i overlooked a digit in the yen price and it turns out it's actually over $1000 instead of like $300 like I thought.</br>  <br>He actually calmed down a bit.</br>  <br>I honestly do think it's Void<br> Gaiseric gets emperor's behelit <br> sacrifices his entire kingdom <br> Skull Knight, his most humble servant survives the eclipse <br> gets a hold of a behelit somewhere down the line and uses it to become skull knight </br></br></br></br></br>  how long have they been on the boat?  <br>Crashing this plane… with no survivors!</br>  <br> implying it's his Behelit </br>  <br>Skully isn't an apostle.</br>  <br> tfw when I only read up to when the pirates showed up <br> I can pick it up from here and didn't miss anything </br></br>  <br>Until he ends up being crippled like Griffith. He's already blind, and probably deaf</br>  <br> implying regular behelits work the same as emperor behelits </br>  <br>Joseph's been incarcerated seven times, and nobody gives him any lip for that.<br><br> still hot though <br><br>She used to be pure. Please do not impose your dirty thoughts on her.<br><br><br>I keep thinking of TELL ME WHY when I listen to that song on the GTAV soundtrack.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> what about sinking a boat? </br>  <br>The fuck else would he be?</br>  <br>The price was a surprise but I ordered it anyway. Just waiting for Femto then my wallet is kill.</br>  <br>Crashing this boat, WITH NO SURVIVORS</br>  <br>A spirit in a magical suit of armor. <br><br><br>I can't afford this shit. When will the figma Godhand release?</br></br></br></br>  <br>As cucky as Femto is, I would not mind being dangalang time'd by him.<br><br> I don't blame Casca if some part of her found it pleasurable. </br></br></br>  <br>oh I'll impose my dirty thoughts all over her...on her top and bottom lips...till it runs down her chin and drips onto her breasts slick with hot sweat. I'd grab her by her Mickey Mouse ears and ride her all night long<br> or I would if she were real and in Michigan ; ; </br></br>   cancerous tripfags finally fucked off <br> thread instantly fills up with baneposting instead </br>  Will we finally get off Mr. Miura's wild boat ride?  <br>Why was Gambino such a giant dick?</br>  <br>isn't the wolle skull thing just an armor?</br>  <br>I still can't believe the original to this exists</br>  <br>Put your trip back on, hawk-chan</br>  <br>no brother....the boat rises</br>  <br>So you wouldn't feel bad about Guts shanking the shit out of him later.</br>  <br>The pirate was fun as fuck, shit tasted normie doodle.</br>  <br><br>Because he lost his purpose in life.</br></br>  <br>His wife died.</br>  <br> Mickey Mouse <br> not Minnie Mouse <br><br>This type of post where you directly state your lewd intentions is rare. You must be a newfag.<br><br>Anyway, if Young Animal releases on Fridays, when will this next chapter of Berserk come out? Will Rickard, Erica and Luca fly away on Dhaiva's magic pterodactyl to safety?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because being nice won't win battles</br>  <br>Doesn't mean that you should sell the people that admire you as slaves to pedophile niggers.</br>  <br>Still too happy an ending for Berserk.<br><br>Has to be more like:<br><br> Guts claimed by the demon pits to have to eternally struggle to fight his way out against a constant onslaught of monsters always seeing the gates just on the horizon but never getting any closer <br> Griffith walks the earth again in false man form becoming beloved King of the known world while routinely stopping into Hell to taunt Guts <br> Casca regains her memory and willingly chooses to live with Griffith as his loving Queen in front of Guts before he's condemned to Hell </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll show you who's a newfag...and by that I mean I'm coming to rape you anon. You'd better lock your doors and call the cops, because I'm tracking down your IP and racing over with a pair of handcuffs and a raging stiffie. Theres no escaping this, my boner is as stern and implacable as fate itself.</br>  <br>Wise magical negro did nothing wrong.</br>  <br> implying you would pass up on some sweet silver coins just for some little premature shit you found on the road </br>  <br> passing up the chance for Guts to meet men older than him and develop a healthy social life <br>It just so happened that WMN was also a trained doctor and decided to give the boy a prostate exam with his special thermometer.</br></br>  2 months go by with 2 chapters<br><br> uhh yeah guys im tired again, brb </br></br>  <br> a shitskin <br> Queen <br>Griffith's only got eyes for the true Queen of Midland.</br></br></br>  <br>jesus christs</br>  <br><br><br>Fuck off Gambino.</br></br></br>  <br>No, you.</br>  <br>His wife died and he became a cripple.

Guts and Casca will never live happily with their child <br><br> People will never admit that Griffith is a rat bastard because they want his boipussy <br><br> The ending will be sad and finally strip me of my will to live <br><br> mfw </br></br></br></br></br></br>   this thread <br>can't tell if berserk thread or baneposting or jojoposting</br>  <br>if you were Griffith you would have done the same thing</br>  <br>It fits so perfectly.
