I can't imagine that she gets attention like that again, but it was very nice.

Given the combination of stock issues and digital options – it was dominating Amazon’s manga/LN rankings in its Kindle format – it missed the cutoffs.<br><br>But it seems reasonable to think it could have moved 10k a volume that weekend, if it moved 22-25k the following week. That would account for 50k of its 80k before 07/13-17/19. And that would mean its anime bump is even more ridiculous, percentage-wise, that it looks right now!<br><br>Basically of its 200k total sales at the moment, I’d bet maybe 170k of those came since episode 1 aired.

I found ep 1 of this show to be incredibly boring. I mean, they spent half the time talking about nothing and looking for a dog. I'm going to assume it's selling like this solely because of the cute girls.</br></br>  <br>You probably aren't wrong.</br>    <br><br>It'll be fine, they did a great job with ass class.</br></br>    <br>CANTWAKEUP.jpg</br>  <br>Did you not finish the episode?</br>  <br>Did you not watch till the end?</br>  <br>I'm going to have nightmares tonight.</br>  <br>He's wrong!</br>  <br><br>I did. It's just the build up to that point wasn't interesting.

Please, go on and explain to me how a show about an autistic little shit disrupting the school lives of her classmates is supposed to be endearing</br></br>  <br>I've never been more certain of anything in my entire life.

No foreshadowing or anything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>in case you're not b8ing: finish the episode you fucking retard</br>  <br>It's bait, just ignore.</br>  <br>you never know on /a/ but you're probably right</br>  <br>Not really foreshadowing then, since we already know there are zombies</br>  OTP and you know it.    <br><br>Personally I mix it, but almost everyone puts it on top.

Still don't like how they added the dog and Miki though.</br>  <br>The anime dropping all those little hints that something was wrong was nice, but I couldn't get over Miki and Taroumaru somehow being involved. Plus they got rid of the water fight.</br>      <br>Maybe I'm missing something, but why was this even taken to mean she liked the guy?</br>  <br>She won't die though.

Miki was with them and escaped with her girlfriend until her girlfriend went back for burnt zombie dick.</br>  <br>I'm hoping her zombieness will go up to the point where the other zombies will ignore her even when she's shouting and she'll end up having an existential crisis/healing phase and no further than that. Then she can go back to being an action bastard.  Please. </br>  <br><br> Thanks for the kek anon heh </br></br>  <br> Crossbow is hopefully a tomboy </br>  <br>I doubt she'll get any deeper than this, they pay attention to noise regardless of what makes it.</br>  <br>Is Miki a tomboy?</br>  so what's the most plausible explanation for no guys in this series?  <br>Yeah, this series is going to flop hard anime-sales wise at this rate. Not even Hanayamata was doing that bad.</br>  <br>Well we don't know how long the serum actually lasts, just that it conveniently ran out when Chopper-kun was going to rescue the girls. She could last for a long time, or maybe burn through their supply quickly.  She's dead Jim. <br><br><br>Not moe enough to live.</br></br></br></br>    <br>It's a CGDCT.

Same with the guys in helmets. The author is framing it as boys vs girls.<br><br>Randall probably has a bunch of guys</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I'll laugh hard when it sells less than 4k</br>  <br><br>Those numbers doesn't add properly.<br><br>So did it sell like 80k or 36k?<br><br>and did it sell like 44k or 119k?<br><br>make sense faggots.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>girls are more immune to the infection</br>  Kurumi a best  <br>especially the cute ones</br>  <br>The potency of the drugs the girls have might be different so it lasts longer.

Please no. </br>  I want to hug Miki and hold her hands and tell her everything will be diejoubu  <br><br>You did that anon?<br> If so, really noice </br></br></br>  <br>No, the school was just built with the shelter in mind. Remember that Randall is right there, they seem to have set up shelters in the city just in case.</br>    <br>Shit yeah.

All tension is loss now since everything needed comes in the nick of time or has been there already as part of the setting.<br>As far as I can tell the only real bad thing that happened in the manga was megu-nee.</br>  <br>You're right, the cannibals are really convenient, and so was Rii's brain snapping like a twig at a time where the crew could really need her to be level headed</br>  <br> Kurumi is gonna die. <br>They didn't come in the nick of time for radio-chan.</br></br>  <br>I'm really wondering how you can think that. The only real convenient thing I can think of is Yuki heaing Miki and the two of them managing to not get infected. Everything else works against them.</br>  Why does everyone think uni girls are cannibals? Is it just a random theory or were there hints I missed. I mean it's obvious something is off with them, by why cannibalism?  <br>Rii's losing it, Kurumi is walking a slow path to death, and they're out in relative danger. There is no hope for them.</br>  <br>I don't necessarily agree, but when I was reading two different series I got a similar feeling. I think that once you stick with these types of stories for a while things just start to seem silly and predictable.</br>  <br> rescue helicopter crashes and destroys the school with fire <br> convenient <br>I'd hate to see what your idea of inconvenient would look like.</br></br></br>  <br>So you want more cute girl suffering? You bastard</br>  <br><br><br>Sure they are put bad situations because of the setting but they are saved by it even more. They are at a school in the beginning that conveniently has electricity, running water, and a farm plot and 4 girls with absolutely no preparation and one being useless in combat were somehow able to survive this world. On top of that there seems to be a pattern of "terror of the week" chapters and story arcs where they get stuck in a poor situation and then come unscathed in the last second. Characters that experience a mental lockdown in the worst time get saved/recover right before they get killed. Characters get stuck with zombies and someone or something distracts them and they escape. I just can't really see 4 girls getting through this relatively fine physically even though only one of them trained athletically. It just seems like poor story telling to me.<br>Or alternatively I'm just retarded for thinking a show that is also a moe SoL would also be realistic to the zombie drama and like  says I just want them to suffer more.</br></br></br></br>  so was this outbreak airborne? <br><br>how did being on a rooftop protect them?</br></br>  <br>It's storytelling in itself to have the "terror of the week" be the focus of the chapter. If we looked into completely random points into their lives, it would be boring.</br>  <br> yfw this is like The Truman Show </br>   oh look a nice cute SoL show <br> let's watch it <br> wow this is pretty boring and weird, this bitch is mega autistic <br> reach last 2 minutes or so of first episode <br>what the fuck?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It protected them from zombie attacks, the outbreak had already spread by then. If they hadn't gotten the alpha strain by then they weren't going to.<br><br>Yes it's "convenient" but so what? If these things weren't "convenient" either the story would have ended very quickly or it wouldn't be SoL, and being an SoL zombie story is the entire point of Gakkou Gurashi. Other than their initial setup at the school I wouldn't call anything else that's happened convenient.</br></br></br>  <br>I can agree that they had come out of some situations rather conveniently even if the reasons are in the setting itself. Then again, look at what we have now. Yuki pretending to be delusional, Rii losing it, Kurumi being half-dead. Now they are with suspicious uni girls. I don't think this would end well.</br>  <br>Welcome. Here is your one warning.<br>If you don't want to get spoiled, get out.</br></br>  <br> conveniently <br>This is one of the few areas set up by Randall with equipment to survive when this breakout would happen. You're literally complaining that the people given the tools to survive manage to use those tools.<br><br> terror of the week <br>No such thing.<br><br> come unscathed in the last second <br>Honestly don't know a situation this would refer to. There isn't a huge luck game like you're pretending.<br><br> mental lockdown recover right before they get killed <br>No. Yuki was broken up until after everything was better, she was only allowed to suffer once things were looking better. She has had a few moments of supposed clarity but nothing has ever come from them; if anything, they've harmed the people involved like chasing after Miki.<br><br> something distracts them <br>The characters run around with coins and glowsticks and whatever for that purpose exactly. That's how they survive.<br><br>You don't have to find it believable but at least acknowledge that the story has a premise that supports everything that has happened so far.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>better question is how the fuck did zombies manage to overpower humans? They skip over this fact in a lot of zombie media, but if you have zombies that are so weak that a kid with a shovel can take them out with relative ease and they are so slow moving and fragile, how do enough people actually manage to get bitten? These zombies seem so weak that I can probably beat at least half a dozen in unarmed combat, especially if its only bites that transfer the virus</br>  <br>They're in Yokohama, which is right next to Tokyo, the city basically agreed to be the worst place ever for a zombie outbreak to occur.</br>  <br>Panic, mass confusion, hysteria, denial, idiots, take your pick.</br>  <br>Numbers</br>  <br>There were lots of them, people were panicked, and the infection spreads incredibly easily,</br>  <br>See the Mall chapter and how everything happened there. That can pretty much be applied to every place in Japan except the countryside and military bases. And it's not like it started with just 1 infected person.</br>  <br>no, animation is for charity and no one is payed to make anime</br>  <br> realistic zombie drama <br>Anon plis.</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>The ant mind controlling fungus the alpha strain is probably based on releases spores after it kills an ant, which would be concentrated at ground level or near the host ("airborne" for an ilness is really just a transmission distance power level, not true flying). We don't know how this would work with zombies, but one possibility is the longer human lifespan greatly slows the omega strain's life cycle, so it'll be years before the next wave of spores.<br><br><br>My theory is some lab worker took it on a plane trip through Tokyo's biggest airport during the airborne infection phase, and people infected by that spread it throughout all the world's airports. It proceeded to spread like the flu, which doesn't get everyone at once, but does get everywhere. The infected all turned into zombies on the same day. The airborne phase ended then, but there were already enough infected to take all major cities down.</br></br></br></br>  So I just read until the latest scanlated chapter, am I allowed to post in these threads now?  <br>Did you read ch 36 and 37?</br>  <br>Re-read it so you didn't miss anything<br>Seriously</br></br>  <br>Only if you agree left is the best of the three sluts.</br>  <br>No I did not, I'll be right back.</br>  <br>Made a couple minor alterations</br>    http://www.examu.co.jp/nitroplus_bl<wbr>asterz/character/partner18.html</wbr>  I hope beargirl makes that buttface in the anime too  <br>She won't be in the anime</br>  <br>We have the dog. Who's to say they won't find her on the field trip?</br>  <br>The dog predates the start of the manga, and Miki is the only reason the viewers needed the mall for. That volume is getting cut out entirely.<br>Not to mention she only shows up once Rii is broken and that doesn't happen until once they've left school.</br></br>  <br>so how will the anime end then? With them leaving the school? They are going to fit in some excessive filler then, because that's too little content for 13 episodes.</br>  <br>No, they're pretty clearly getting a mall flashback. That's why it was referenced so clearly.</br>  <br>Be honest<br><br>You're a sloth, aren't you?</br></br></br>  <br>Why is it too little?<br> Miki flashback <br> Obligatory dog dies episode <br> Kurumi bite <br> Megu-nee flashbacks <br> Helicopter crash and aftermath <br> Graduation <br><br>Should fit into 10 episodes pretty well, at the pace they're going.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's plenty of content.<br><br>Flashback, yes. Field trip is overkill when we already have Miki, I guess I forgot that flashback bit is still in volume 2.</br></br></br>    Guys help, I can't stop listening to the OP  <br>You have fine taste.</br>  <br>did we have 1st floor and basement map?</br>  <br>I swore she had huge breasts from the thumbnail.</br>  <br>What, he didn't do one for episode 2?<br><br>Also the artist should just hurry up and give us a completely unobstructed and detailed view of shovel's armpit already.</br></br></br>  <br>I wish to emulate this artist's style.

Which Gurashi do you think has the biggest bush?</br>  <br>Probably the latter.</br>  <br>They're all 2D ideals so none.</br>  <br>They want Rii for stress relief and breeding purposes.</br>  <br>But bushes are the ideal.</br>   Kurumifags   <br>I don't know what website that is but I think you should probably stay there.</br>  <br>This</br>  I'm probably making a big deal out of nothing, but I'll say it anyway. I know I make various posts involving other girls from anime, particularly the twintailed ones. Let me make something clear. Very few of those posts are ever serious. My latest one about Kurumi showing up in a dream was my attempt at being funny, though it would have been better if I'd used a XD at the end. I will admit that I do adore the rest of my angel troupe, and I will without a doubt be adding Kurumi to my favorites folder, maybe even replacing one of the current members of my angel troupe, depending on her performance in Gakkou Gurashi!. I do believe that some responses I get from posts like that, particularly when I use certain words, are jokes. But for those that are serious, I'm saying this once. Do not EVER question my dedication to Azusa. She is my number one, and always will be. No matter how many times I appear to show affection to other characters, at most it's only a bit. My heart and soul is with Azusa. Again, I'm no doubt making a big deal out of this, but I just wanted to make this clear. That one comment I got hit me quite hard.<br><br><br>No matter how many times I read it, I still cant seem to fully understand exactly what the fuck I'm actually reading.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The fuck did I just read?</br></br>  <br>I had to type  out to try and help process what I was reading.<br><br>Here's hoping that's the last time we ever have to read that</br></br></br>  <br><br>Wait, it's him isn't it?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128463065 <br>Don't do this.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128463065 <br> *Gulp* </br>  <br>Do what? *Gulp*</br>  Is there anything to like about Rii-san other than her body?  <br>I like her mental breakdown.</br>  <br>I was hoping he'd killed himself.</br>  <br>Not sure if he did or not, I'm curious myself.

GG is both of their only ongoing work according to mangaupdates.</br></br>  <br>It's up to you to heat it back up.</br>  <br>Can't speak for the artist, but the author is a Nitroplus writer who works on VNs, co-writes a fair bit of Urobuchi anime and such.</br>  <br>I've got just the thing.</br>  <br> i really want her to survive <br>Zombie stories either end with all-survival or team wipe.<br>The author obviously can't tell us which, it would kill the tension.<br><br>But it is clear that he is deliberately balancing despair with hope, because everytime something bad happens there is usually something good that keeps the team from falling apart.

This is exactly five times as dumb as you sound. If, say, your dumb circuits had a capacity of something like 5, mine would have to be at least 25. This is the difference between an amateur and a trained professional dumb ass. And that's not even considering the possibility of tapping into the ambient dumb to fuel my idiocy. I could be dumb for hours after you've exhausted the extent of your dumb powers. Given sufficient dumbness I could even probably generate idiocy of sufficient strength to generate a field of pure, infinite moronic retardation, against which you surely would have no defense.<br><br> There's plenty of stupid stuff in Fate, going for Takeuchi's boner for blonde, muscular, svelt Briton chicks with large invisible swords is going for low hanging fruit. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What kind of plot is that? <br>The kind that is written to make it more appealing to otaku circa 2004 after the success of Tsukihime. If Fate were written today, Nasu probably would have kept Saber as a male and kept Ayaka as the protagonist like they were in the draft he wrote in collage in order to capitalize on fujobucks.</br></br>  <br>And then Fate/ would be about as popular as Mahoutsukai is today :^)</br>  <br><br>Sure smells like mongrel in here.</br></br>  <br>How do the prototypes compare to the finished products in terms of stats?</br>  <br>When Arthur is Manaka's servant he is basically god, except for his luck stat which turns to shit. Based on his luck and Saber Alter's luck when she's partners with Sakura I think having an evil master slaughters your luck stat. His Excaliblasts is more powerful than Arturia's, but can only be used if the enemy is stronger then him, like Gil or Ozzy. <br>Proto-Gil may look cooler, but F/SN Gil has better stats and Ea is significantly better then Enki.<br>Proto-Lancer has better stats than F/SN Lancer, but that might just be from having Proto-Rin as his master.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually this is better than the current one.</br>  <br>Gil looks like such a dork.

What are they saying about that?</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>They are saying it figures a show like that would be popular in the west, but all I see are compliments for Gangsta. Then they're mostly curious as to why Gakkou Gurashi and Monster Musume aren't rated higher.<br><br><br>They're calling that one shit though.</br></br></br></br>  The only thing worth laughing about here is Japan's declining birth-rate.    <br>Why is Yuno so mean in that image?</br>  <br>Not their inherent shit taste?</br>  <br>Yeah, this is what I thought was going on. All I saw was them saying that Gangsta has a western atmosphere, so it's expected.</br>  <br> Akagami no Shirayuki-hime <br> They're calling that one shit though. <br>For what reason?</br></br></br>  <br>I may be an old man but I like Akagami.<br><br>Akagami? Never heard of it. It even airing?<br><br>Curious I checked their homepage but when I saw "series composition: Akao Deko" I immediately closed the page.</br></br></br></br></br>  They're also wondering how we're dealing with the puns in shimoneta  Gangsta is the best show this season. them nips be trippin   I thought Westerners liked zombies, why isn't Gurashi higher? <br> I guess they just like gangstas more </br>    <br>II don't know what anyone translating it to, as I never checked it out but, someone should tell them "poorly".</br>  ＞ｂａｋａ　ｇａｉｊｉｎ　ｎｏｔ　ｒａｉｋｕ　ＲＡＢＵ　ＲＡＩＢＵ   they can stomach the garbage that is Seraph because of Shinoa huh <br><br>LOL</br></br>  <br>Yaraonfags hate shoujo, shoujo is always under their radar, they like muh dark, ecchi, twist, waifuwars etc</br>  <br>A lot of people hate shoujo.

Their Dark Angel Olivia is one such gem so I have high hopes for everything they are making for cygames.<br><br>Alter is consistently top-notch. What you see in their promo pics is generally what you can expect to get. Their quality control is also better than Koto.<br><br><br>Looks like that was from skytube's twitter post.

I should have gone to AX to meet Hanamori Yumiri. She also played Chiaya from Rolling Girls which is another show I loved.</br>  I'm a regular buyfag but I want to preorder this fig for a friend of mine as a gift. I never played awakening and I'm wondering why there is the random breast plate just there? If it had anything to do with the game or if it was just a design choice thing.  <br>She's a part of the itty bitty titty bitch squad and she wears a breastplate that makes her tits look bigger than they actually are.</br>  <br>How did you find a friend?</br>  <br>She usually wears it. There's no particular reason she isn't in the figure, but whatever.</br>  <br>Like  said it's her breastplate, not really sure why it's hanging on that rock that looks like a pegasus wing from the game.</br>  <br>Alter doing Anila huh? Might get it. Hopefully Djeeta and Caclistro will turn out alright.</br>  <br>From what I heard it's part of a DLC. She doesn't like that her breasts are small so she makes them look bigger with the chest piece.</br>  <br><br><br>Weird. I hate how aligned it is. I wish it was more tilted and natural looking if it was just supposed to be placed.</br></br></br>    <br>You think your friend is gonna put out?</br>  <br>Your explanation is the best.</br>  <br>http://granbluefantasy.jp/pages/?p=<wbr>3853<br><br>Apart from Yuel, the other girls are all more popular than Danua.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>literally all the fanart i see is Danua, maybe she's more popular with illustrators</br>  <br>Harsh and rude.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure you can put it on her.</br>  <br>Part of the reason why weeaboos are so despised</br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br>yes, we read your post</br>  <br>she normally wears it in game, it's more just to show off her boobs. in game some supports have her talk about being embarrassed for being flat, she's just small. except for some dlc you won't even see her without armor which makes her look bigger</br>  who's going to cop?  <br>casuals most likely</br>  <br>I would if I had a use for mugs.</br>  <br>That wasn't me</br>  <br>I haven't watched the show but just looking at her pisses me off.</br>  <br>Oh, it was me after all. Apologies and carry on, chap.</br>  <br>You're a fucking fag buddy.</br>  <br>You're going to get a lot of casuals/newfags yelling at you now for not liking meme character of the season</br>  <br>I like her normal form better. Chibi a shit.</br>  <br> Dark Dragoon Forte <br>Holy shit yes.</br></br>  <br>She looks like a little shit.</br>  Any day now AmiAmi.  <br>Yes, and as a result she's fun.</br>  <br>Please no. I can't afford her til right near the end of the month.</br>  <br>I see it being released around there anyway.<br><br> You better pray to the AmiAmi gods anon </br></br></br>  <br>I'm a super serious connoisseur of anime, I only invest my time watching highly intellectual anime, anime for the thinking man you could say. My favourite anime is Neon Genesis Evangelion.</br>    <br><br>Normal form is so perfect it's boring<br><br>Hurr i beat everyone in everything without even trying</br></br></br></br>    <br>Pedestrian taste, same as most people in these threads. I'd half expect you to ask for anime recommendations. Looks like you've only just scratched the surface.</br>  <br>These, only these. Oh, and maybe some Dragon Ball (not Z) and Lupin figures. I really want a King Piccolo figure.</br>  <br>I hope you're not determining people's tastes by their figures. Posters tell more since they are easy to obtain from every possible series, but only popular stuff gets figures.</br>  <br> but only popular stuff gets figures <br>Not entirely true, but yeah, his posters are pretty pleb.</br></br>  <br>Well, you know what I mean. Some weird stuff get figs too but it's mostly the shit that sells.</br>  <br>The posters are on the same level as the figures. The only redeeming feature, aside from stuff I can't identify, is the framed Sora no Woto picture.</br>  Native's Aoba when?  <br>Don't get me wrong, I'm definitely not defending that guy's tastes, but this is what triggered me <br><br> Pedestrian taste, same as most people in these threads <br><br>Most of my favorite shows don't get figures so I'm buying nice figs from more popular series.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When the popular series are shit like Fate, that's when you have a problem.</br>  <br>Nigga you're going to get shat on with whatever popular shit you buy regardless. It doesn't matter if it's Fate, Madoka or something else, there will be someone will call out on your shit taste.</br>  <br>When I was thinking "popular," I was thinking more along the lines of popular series that are ingrained in Japan. Stuff like Doraemon, Lupin, Ghibli, etc. Those make for a decent collection.</br>  Colored. Too bad the series is shit.<br><br><br>You are aware Fate and whatever other popular series is also popular in Japan, right?<br><br> implying Ghibli characters gets any decent figs </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You are aware Fate and whatever other popular series is also popular in Japan, right? <br>Among otaku, not the general public. Fate is also trash.</br></br>  <br>How many times are you going to post that image, you degenerate?</br>  <br>And girls only. Six damn Phats though? That'll be interesting.</br>  <br>More Saber, less non-Saber.</br>  <br>Every time asks about Wonfes.</br>    <br>Man, not Senjou looks like a qt</br>  <br>I'm suddenly feeling an urge to glue that whore.</br>    $700  <br> Bases are different <br>Some people just want to watch the world burn</br></br>  <br>I don't understand your view then. Do you think the only "good" popular merchandise to own are things from Ghibli films and the like? Because as already mentioned, they don't have anything good going for them. Look at this crap. Limited and exclusive if I'm not mistaken, costs like 15k-30k+. But it's shit.</br>  <br>They're obviously designed to sit behind and in front.</br>  <br>It's about quality over quantity. Ghoulish has some decent merch, you just have to search a bit more. The are some great models for instance.</br>  <br>God damn auto correct. Ghibli, not ghoulish.</br>  Just release the fluffy already.  <br> quality over quantity <br>Ghibli has neither, unless you're into plushies.</br></br>  Have any buyfags here bough bootlegs in their newfag days? If so, what did you do with them?  <br>any nigger dumb enough to buy a bootleg should kill themselves</br>  <br>She's holding a tortilla wrapped hotdog and still can't seem to grasp it properly.

Seems to be pretty easy since it's only a vice admiral  <br>they werent there yet?</br>  <br><br>I really hope Kaido turns out to be the former second division captain of the Whitebeard pirates. I wanna know more about Whitebeard's past.</br></br>  <br>then they should have set sail earlier. <br>Probably marco alone would have been able to fly on that ship and steal it. <br>Enspecially since noone in the world of one piece is able to hit a target with canon balls</br></br></br>  <br>he's not going to, because its not true.</br>  <br>I would presume they didn't have the intel to know which fleet was transporting ace so they just waited to strike where they knew he'd be.<br><br>Also I feel like whitebeard was trying to send a message to the world government by attacking marine ford. "This is what happens when you fuck with my family." "I will strike anywhere, no one is safe." That sort of thing. Too bad it kinda back fired a bit.</br></br></br>  <br>I think its just a straw hat, jim.</br>  <br>What people fail to understand is that the whole Marineford War was nothing but a display of power from both sides.<br>The Marines could've easily killed Ace on spot yet they decided to give him a public execution to show the world that they're not afraid of a Yonko.<br>Whitebeard could have rescued Ace from Impel Down too yet he decided to challenge the Marines head on to show the world what messing with a Yonko's close subordinate will cause to happen.</br></br></br>  <br>b..but anon, why would someone tell lies on the internetz?</br>  <br>You are not even a fish, you are a fucking fat whale dropping right on my boat.

However, It seemed so important to him that ace gets away alive that he could have just free'd him in impel down/ on the way to marine ford and then go to marine ford anyway just to fuck them up.</br>  <br>No, next week yes.</br>  <br>No. Oda died in a car crash.

Being able to fly does not give you GPS.</br>  <br>Birds actually have an internal gps.</br>  <br>so Whitebeard and his fleet were able to get right into marine ford but a couple 100 meters before marine ford was not doable for them? <br><br>They could simply wait on the other side of the gate of justice till it opens</br></br></br>  <br> Show proof</br>  How or why is Robin losing this much? Didn't expect Boa's votes to be this high. I thought people would favor Nami or something. Or did they like her outfit better?<br><br>Holy fuck, Law. I didn't think the results would be this far from Ace. How is Zoro losing to Barto?<br><br>Maybe it's because I assumed people would be voting for the character instead of the jeans they're wearing?</br></br></br></br>  <br>They could've sailed with their ships just a few miles away from Impel Down through navigable waters and then fly there</br>  <br> two members of Whitebeard's crew becoming yonkou <br>Can't say I agree.</br></br>    <br>Also, daily reminder that Law a slut.</br>  <br>Well I agree on this one, thou, they were probably too late for any kind of hijacking, even with a flying type user.</br>  <br><br><br>Brava</br></br></br>  Reminder.  <br>horny jap boys vote for boa, because one piece characters say shes beauty incarnate, so they just agree without actually looking and seeing that theres hotter women in the op world.</br>  <br>because no tan</br>    <br>No tan?</br>  <br>stop posting this image</br>  <br><br> Robin lowest of them all, even lower than Rebacca  <br> Zoro and Ace are lower than ''Just cuck my shit up Sanji'' and ''I love the guy who mollested me as a child'' Law </br></br></br>  <br><br><br>My stash needs more of these pictures.

Please do.</br></br>  http://onepiecepodcast.com/2015/07/<wbr>22/the-one-piece-connection/<br><br>Really interesting thoughts in this article, it's possible that Uranus is related to Elbaf.<br><br>It's long but worth the read.</br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>So many garbage characters running around, like Bart or Bellamy, but Oda had to kill off Monet. Such a shame.</br>  <br> Why the fuck is he so constantly obsessed with sex <br> and not only that, Law also seems to be traumatised <br> What are those guys speaking <br> Say, those people doesn't look like parent and child <br> i think he's a kidnapper </br></br></br></br></br>  Why is Robin so ugly?  <br> If you see that way, ooh he's forcing children to suck </br>  I'm still curious, do Luffy and Zoro mean mean Teach and his crew or just Teach alone by 'it's they'?<br><br>Isn't there the theory that Teach is somehow 2 people or something and can therefore use 2 devil fruits?</br></br>  <br>Mainly that he's a chimera or so.</br>  <br>They were aware of his crew</br>  <br>It's pretty obvious Luffy and Zoro mean Teach, Nami even asks where his companions are to clarify that they're referring to Teach as 'they' not his crew. (I'm not even sure if BB even had a crew at this point in time.)</br>  <br> I'm not even sure if BB even had a crew at this point in time <br>He already got Jesus, Auger, Doc Q, and Laffitte in Jaya. But yeah, Luffy and Zoro didn's seem to know they're his companion.</br></br>  <br>Luffy and Law will take Kaido down, not Moria.<br><br> Moria will take Kaido's shadow after his defeat. </br></br></br>  <br>maybe they were just respecting his choice of pronouns, you shitlord</br>  <br><br>Let me guess you guys believe in the retarded cerberus theory too?</br></br>  Wheres the chapter?  <br>And maybe Roger and Newgate just trolled everyone with One Piece bullshit.</br>  <br>No chapter this week.</br>  <br>This  post has nothing to do with any cerberus. It is in Thriller Bark.</br>  <br> like Bart or Bellamy <br>kill yourself</br></br>  <br>he probably has conjoined twin or something</br>  <br>I believe the 'multiple people' bit of the cerberus theory, I used to believe in the whole thing until I remembered that blackbeard used claws to fight in his WB crew days which is likely how he caused shanks that claw-shaped scar.</br>  <br>But this theory has been proven wrong because Blackbeard held a wolverine like claw weapon in the past.</br>  "Lick it, anon."  Daily reminder that Zoro and Robin is a thing.  <br>"But babe theres soap on it, i'll have diarreah wipe that shit off first."</br>  <br> dat Perona <br>HNNNNNNNNNNNNNGH</br></br>  <br>I used to ship this, honestly.</br>  <br>I feel like they'd be more of a bootycall for each other.<br><br>Like if Franky is too busy building big ass ships and Tashigi is polishing other swords then ZoBin would be doing the nasty.</br></br></br>  This is the best canon outfit for Robin, followed by her Thriller Bark outfit. You can't prove me wrong.  <br>They're the only couple that would even make sense in the crew.</br>  <br><br>you mean Franky and Robin</br></br>  <br> Teach's crew are revealed as a whole right after this <br>Oh I dunno, context clues maybe?</br></br>  How lucrative must be it be to a bounty hunter in OP? Just capture a bunch of no-name bum pirates and you're swimming in millions of Beri. Unless inflation in OP is weimar germany-tier where a few million only gets you a loaf of bread or some shit.  <br>There's still the 'Teach has a special body' thing that Marco said.<br>Before that I also thought the crew was meant, but I wasn't so sure afterwards.</br></br>  <br> They'd be more of a bootycall for each other <br><br>I have no problem with this. Except for the Franky and Tashigi part.</br></br></br>  <br> Franky and Tashigi part <br><br>Why? They're literally made for each other.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm totally with you. Oda often finds things to hide under a guise of the obvious but on the other hand it sounds like classic looking too much into it.<br><br>At the end of the day, there isn't really enough to go on and it's pointless really debating it until we know a hell of a lot more. In all honesty, I doubt it. Fun theory though.</br></br></br>  Interesting article on the possibilities of the true underlying story of One Piece. Goes pretty deep.<br><br>http://onepiecepodcast.com/2015/07/<wbr>22/the-one-piece-connection/<br><br>Not really a big fan of the One Piece Podcast but they come out with some interesting shit some times.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Mostly personal preference. I don't like Tashigi, honestly. And I like Zoro. And I'm not shipping a character I like with a character I don't like.<br><br>As for Franky and Robin, I just don't feel their chemistry. Maybe it's there, but it just won't hit me. Same with the Luffy and Nami ship that's so popular. I tried but couldn't really ship it.</br></br></br>  <br>"It came from the moon" prediction is nowhere near deep, I liked oro jackson's one piece theory more until that moment which he said Smoker would be the last member, i dropped after that and led to the conclusion that every one piece fan theory is utterly shit </br>  <br>Already posted here m8  but I agree it's really well written</br>  <br>i think nami paid 100 belly for a news paper once, so it's not as much as a million $ but still decent.</br>  <br>Please respond.</br>  <br>He makes a pretty compelling argument from the clues we've got. It's one of the better fan theories out there. Mainly because he isn't over assuming too much and only taking things as written<br><br><br>Zach definitely writes better than he fucking talks</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You need to be more specific in your questions anon....are you thinking of pic related?<br><br><br>I don't listen to the podcast because all they talk about is retarded shit like merchandise that no one cares about. But I do love the hints he found on Punk Hazard with Uranus and Elbaf.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but I'm wondering what the possible correlation would be, other than random ancestor souls inside the Fruits.</br>  <br> hints he found on Punk Hazard with Uranus and Elbaf <br><br>Not the person you're talking to but could you share what hints?</br></br></br>  <br>Why the fuck do they need a ship.<br><br>Ships doesn't matter.<br><br>They are pirates so they most likely slay the poose on the couch, the floor, the kitchen, outside.<br>They fuck wherever they want.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://onepiecepodcast.com/2015/07/<wbr>22/the-one-piece-connection/#Uranus<wbr><br><br>I'd bet money on this one.<br><br><br>It's good when they get Stephen on, someone who actually understands One Piece translation better than anyone and Greg. Even if Greg is an insufferable twat.</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>As I've said, it's more of a personal preference. I just answered a question. If you think they don't need a ship then that's well and good. Go on and live life that way.</br>  <br>Anon I'm not spoonfeeding you, literally just copy pasta the link and click the Uranus section and it's right there.<br><br><br>The connection is that devil fruits most likely originally grew on trees, since in the original romance dawn Luffy's fruit came from the rubber tree, and the fact that artificial fruits in the factory needed trees to grow. And if we use bible logic it's likely the Adam and Eve trees grew devil fruits originally, especially when you consider that special sunlight flowers were needed in pic related and the Eve tree just happens to be called the Sunlight Tree Eve.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You stupid anon?</br>  <br>Anon forget about him. <br><br>Can you spoonfeed me instead?</br></br></br>  <br>See  he was nice enough to spoonfeed you plebs</br>  <br>Well sure but "DFs originally grew on trees" doesn't sound like much to make a major theory over.</br>  <br><br>While your at it, continue down and read the stuff about the Volume 27 cover. I really think that theory might have legs as well. Old as hell but is just as strong today.</br></br>  <br>That's not spoonfeeding you useless fuck.<br><br>I'm not clicking that sketchy ass link.<br>You stupid or something?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see it, Luffy what does Luffy winking and having winks have to with anything?</br>  <br><br><br> Many explorers during the Age of Discovery first set out to the seas thinking that the world existed on a flat plane. <br><br>DROPPED.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> what is reading? </br>  <br>I've read it but it's not even a theory, he's basically stating what we already know.</br>  <br>I'm a fan of her Punk Hazard outfit</br>  <br>About him being half Moon?<br><br>How did we already know that?</br></br></br>  <br><br>You were saying magma brat?</br></br>  <br>Because not everyone is a speedreader</br>  <br> speedreader <br>I've been reading the manga for about 10 years buddy. Read through the entire thing about 4 or 5 times.<br><br>At no point is it ever explicitly mentioned about the D being a pictogram rather than a letter. The theory only got around in English when Greg posted it about 5 years ago. It's a popular theory but don't pretend that it's more explicit than that. I just really think that there's something to it. Greg even said a little while ago that when he wanted to mention this theory on his one-piece.com column, it was rejected for possibly getting a little too close to the truth. The only time anything he'd ever had anything censored.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Chill mate I was just baiting, that's interesting that it got censored though.</br>  Did anyone else notice the in pic related that for 10 million beri you can get a female,bifurcated mermaid? Who the fuck would buy a mermaid split in half?  <br>So the only thing Ace accomplished by ignoring whitebeards warning is to get whitebeard killed while getting killed himself.<br><br>What a great guy</br></br></br>  <br>Greg's about as close to this shit as it gets. He's even met and spoken to Oda about a few things himself. Interestingly, when he met him last he gave him a boxset of Game of Thrones. He got really into it and it's thought that it influenced the lion symbol on the shields that Capone's men were holding a few chapters back.<br><br>It's funny if the Volume 27 cover does turn out to be a major hint though. The book came out 12 and a half years ago, millions of people have seen it, he outright told you the what the D is and almost no one noticed.<br><br>Motherfucker does it all the time. Most recently was probably hiding a picture of Rosinante in the Marines, a year and a half before he turned up in the story.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him but w-what is the D then?</br>  <br>What like Kokoro? Not all of them are that fucking ugly.<br><br>That's fairly cheap considering</br></br></br>  <br>What the hell?<br><br>What am I supposed to be looking at?<br>Where's the D?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I still think that Davy Jones will be related to the D somehow, wouldn't be surprised if he's the main character of Void Century flashback</br>  Was this ever explained somewhere?  <br><br>Remember, Greg now writes for V-Jump and the columns on the official Japanese One Piece website (which are in English as well). The only time he had something rejected was when he was mentioning something about this.</br></br>  <br>I was thinking that they got a mermaid,split the human and fish bits and then sold it. I thought it was pretty dark for OP because it's a fairly comedic shonen.</br>  <br>Yeah they used the barrels as replacement diving suits.<br><br>The long rope looking thing is for them to breathe air so they don't drown.<br>Also Luffy needed 2 barrels because he's a norokshuki user.</br></br></br></br>  <br>oh goddamn that's scary<br><br>What was it rejected from?</br></br></br>  <br>What's there to explain? It's just exploring a ship.</br>  <br><br><br>Isn't this a picture of Vivi's mother? <br>Am I imagining things?</br></br></br></br>  <br>WWAIT SO LUFFY IS A SKYPEIAN SO THAT MEANS DORAGON MADE LOVE TO SOME CHICK WITH WINGS?<br><br>WHERE HE BEEN HIDING HIS WINGS THE WHOLE TIME?<br><br>HOLY SHIT.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Entirely possible, but since the tail splitting is actually a thing in the One Piece world, I think it's safe to assume that it's referring to that.<br><br><br>His column<br>https://one-piece.com/special/greg/<wbr><br><br>He's a pretty big deal over there these days. TV appearances and all sorts of shit. Get's noticed out in public all the time. Word is that the rejection came from fairly high up.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes because the ship is way older than that</br>  <br>This theory makes too much sense for it to not be true, when this comes true I can finally be one of those faggots saying 'called it 10 years ago mane'</br>  <br>Quack?</br>  <br>Oh wow that's pretty interesting then. Are there any other major theories that have pretty solid evidence behind them?</br>  <br>Oh also how is Shanadora part of the giant kingdom?</br>  <br>That doesn't make any sense as it would suggest that every D. has a "earth"- parent and a "moon"-parent which is obviously not the case. One can argue that the D. was given to the children and so on because it's lost it's true meaning, but that would make luffy himself not that much releated to the moon people as his blood came from the all the mixing beforehand, making him not a real half-earth/half-moon human. The closest thing to a half-moon boy would be garp in luffy's family making luffy having the D. basically meaningless.</br>  <br> Word is that the rejection came from fairly high up. <br>Elaborate pls</br></br>  <br>See  </br>  <br> As for Franky and Robin, I just don't feel their chemistry <br>Maybe because you're a ZoRobin faggot.</br></br>  <br>And Oda fucking told us in 2003.<br><br>That guy is laughing at everyone. So fucking good at giving us so many details that we just gloss over. Let's be honest, before last week, no one had noticed the crow motif with the Revolutionaries but it's been there for years<br><br><br>Pretty much everything in that OPP article. There isn't anything else that is actually THAT solid but some really strong theories kicking about to do with the Void Century, the weapons and the shape of the world.<br><br>The article ends with a really fucking strong idea of what One Piece might be which never really occurred to me before.<br><br><br>Descendants. Not half, exactly but the idea is he's got the blood of the ancients in him. Works so far. Everyone in the Monkey family so far has it.<br><br>What's quite funny is that Teach's D might actually be a letter D.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for the link anon. I'll check it out soon.<br><br>Can you link me to the other theories, primarily about the Century and the world's shape? I'd be real interested in those.</br></br></br>  <br> What's quite funny is that Teach's D might actually be a letter D. <br><br>I'm willing to give Oda the benefit of the doubt about a lot of things but the interaction between WB and BB during Marineford really made BB seem a lot less interesting. His role as being basically Luffy but a villain was a nice spin on what you usually see in Shounen. To have him start grovelling for his life and to be afraid of losing it kind of soured me on him in general. It's especially bad when you consider how big into Fate the BB pirates are.</br></br></br>  <br>I dunno really what more there is to say. The article rejection came from fairly high up the line. That's all that he's said really.<br><br>I imagine it means something like, not my boss but my bosses boss declined it. If it was anyone else, I'd say that it could be nothing but since it's come from Greg - I'd be inclined to think that his feelings about it skirting too close to the truth has some weight to it. That guy is fucking connected. He knows the short term game plan for the upcoming story.<br><br><br>I don't really know any solid articles on the subjects but for the world's shape - I'm not the best person to explain this but I'll give it a go as best as I can.<br><br>There's a popular theory that the Void Century is basically the WG reshaping the world, using the weapons and possibly Oars (the continent puller) to reshape the world in their image. For what reasons? I dunno. To hide something, to cover something up. Something about the war that Clover mentioned.<br><br>It basically explains the bizarre state of the world and the fact that the magnetic structure of the Grand Line is completely fucked up. Mainly because it shouldn't be. I mean needing a triple compass to navigate the fucking New World? Hiding whatever is to be found at Raftel by making it near impossible to navigate is definitely one way to do it. To our knowledge, it mostly worked for 800 years. Only the Roger pirates found it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Jigojo.  AotS for sure  I want to become a godzilla.  Should be out soon.  <br>Just readed the manga until the 41 chp.<br>This is The Godfather + Stronk enemies and i loved it.</br></br>  <br> until the 41 chp <br>literally where?

Almost all sub-1080p anime is upscaled to 1920x1080 by studio, and has some stuff overlayed at 1080p or 1080i (credits, episode title and such). funi and CR usually get 1080p or 1080i video and their 720p is a downscale from that. All HD stations in Japan are 1080i so broadcast resolution is 1080 lines, but whether or not it deserves 1080p is another question.</br></br>  <br>The dumb faggot is you. CR and Funi receive their shows in CAM format, just like TV stations in Japan. Or did you think they rip the TV broadcasts? Fucking idiot. Half of the shows this season are more than 720p. Besides, it's been shown time and time again that even if it's upscale that doesn't necessarily make it bad, let alone worse than 720p.</br>  <br>What is the website that has the resolution for each show? I forget to bookmark it every time</br>  Nico a cute.

But for now, it seems like she exists to ask the questions the reader/viewer wants to ask. She essentially starts the series off knowing nothing, and so as she learns things about the world she lives in, we, the readers do as well.</br></br>  Are they still translating the manga?  Is the dude with dreads supposed to be black?  <br>No.</br>  <br>Are you sure it isn't TV vs DVD?</br>  <br>Nah.  Doug's big brother figure, Galahad, is brown-ish (probably black) and has dreads so he might have gotten them from him. </br>  <br> Supporting Daiz </br>  <br> literally Plot Device: The Character <br>Good heavens, I hope the author shows more of dem delicious Allys.</br></br>  <br>Just took a look at them. Since you can understand them and all, could you tell me whether  Worick's really a traitor or not since he had that guy's head? </br>  Seems like things are starting to pick up a bit. Pretty hype for the next episode now.  That Monroe boss is badass.   No episode 3 and 4. Come on Diaz <br>So, did it get any good? The first two episodes were underwhelming</br>   waah-waah, we are supersoldiers, nobody likes us, even government. We are minority. <br> every second one is supersoldier <br>Why do i even bother myself to read this shitty manga..</br></br>  Should I pick this up? I despised Kekkai Sensen and the redditors who paraded it as a "good" anime. It feels like Gangsta is in the same realm. <br><br>Tell me I'm wrong, this season is shit.</br></br>  Do you think he had to learn to use his boy pussy?  <br>I'm sure he already knew instinctively how to use his boypussy since he must have lots of daddy issues.</br>  <br>They live in the quarantine area for Twilights, they were never going to be uncommon. Plus, the MC is a Twilight. Like attracts like.</br>  <br>I thought he worked at the brothel for a while when he was younger</br>  <br>Of course he did, he went on to become a prostitute.</br>  <br>He only seems to take female clients. Although he did mention trannies once to Nic when he was telling him to become a gigolo, but he might have been trying to wind him up.</br>  <br>Thanks anon</br>  <br>Do you think he took only female clients when he was just starting out? Do many women even want to fuck an underaged boy?</br>  <br>I think he tried both men and women, and I suppose some women feel more attracted to younger boys instead of adults so yes, they want to.</br>  <br>In the only flashback we get of him being a teenage hooker he's with a lady, yeah. I think after he got picked up by Pussy he'd have even more liberty to only cater to women too.</br>  <br>This caters to my /ss/ fetish a little bit</br>  <br>How is it that everytime there's a male whore in anime his customers are really attractive? Why would the women need to buy themselves a whore if they're obviously really attractive and can get any guy they want. And why are the customers of female whores always really ugly?</br>  <br>They're probably married women who have husbands who can't get it up anymore or are seeing hookers on the side as well. The woman from episode 3 was married.</br>  <br>Yeah that's probably true, but why doesn't the same thing apply to the male customers of female whores? Why are they never hot?</br>  <br>Dudes have less discretion so hot guys get sex for free while hot girls need that professional element? Women are easier to con into getting attached to a prostitute like Worick and are more into the emotional, fake relationship stuff while guys just want a hot fuck?</br>  Explain the dogtags rankings. The numbers because I think I can assume that A is stronger than D like in Delic's case.  <br>Dunno the actual reason besides that in fiction things are portrayed in a romantic or ideal way, but speaking from experience irl:<br>Men I see getting whores in the street tend to be ugly, old, or drunk. Friend who have done it were not ugly but drunk as fuck.<br>Men who take callgirls/escorts tend to be better off, but have no time for relationships (callgirls are cheaper than going on a date and fucking).<br>Women who pay for males, tend to pay for escorts rather than just the sex, so they usually are good looking men to accompany them for a bit, these women are on the older side and attractive or passable. Why call boypussy? because being attractive means little when you're over 40, all men around that age will rather take younger girls.<br>Ugly girls have low self esteem, they don't even think about paying men, or if they do I guess it's probably degrading for them. I guess there's a lot of culture involved in these decisions.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>is more about abilities than anything.<br>Also twilight are shit now because of "Hunters".</br></br>  I didn't know there was a manga.<br>So the girl who they mention this episode, is the girl that was shown bedridden in the previous one?<br>Does Alex develop a thing for Whoreick or Nico, or both? (with a stupid annoying love triangle?).<br>I'm gonna read it, but I'd rather know this beforehand.</br></br></br>  <br>From weakest to strongest, letters:<br>D -&gt; C -&gt; B -&gt; A -&gt; S<br>From weakest to strongest, numbers, in their own letter category:<br>5 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 0<br>So Delico-chan has the strongest D rank.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.<br>Her and Worick have a very casual thing going on, it's mostly Worick hitting on her while she calls him an idiot and there's a friendly vibe. She's into Nic some way but Nic doesn't give a shit besides the occasional kind gesture.</br></br>  So, when does this anime become good if ever?  <br>It doesn't. Drop it now.</br>  <br>Now that they showed there are kids with super powers and there's power levels, it's never going to get good, we're stuck with manga/anime cliches.<br><br><br>That's sad, I expected more passion given their kind of personalities and job.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Eh. I actually enjoy Worick and Alex's interactions.</br>  <br>Maybe it's because right now I find Nico more interesting than Worick. Worick's too much of a walking trope, pretty boy with troubled past, charming, etc. Feels too standard. If he were more passionate and assholeish then maybe.<br>But I'm just judging it quickly, I gotta read it all first.</br></br>  <br>Well, it's been hinted at that he isn't as nice and charming as he seems if that helps any?</br>  <br>That would be better, it wouldn't make sense for a nice person to stick there for long.<br>I'm more interested in Nico anyway.<br>So the manga is behind scans due to the group being lazy or did they drop it?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know the exact details but there's been some issues with raws and not being able to get permissions to use them.
