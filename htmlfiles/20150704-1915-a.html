[   I want to marry Lotte.   no America on mars <br>I'm assuming they are on better planets in the solar system or got eliminated.<br>Who bankrolls students with billions?<br>I better stop thinking about this shit or my head will implode.</br></br></br>  <br> Jupiter <br> 1st world planet <br>You know what, yeah! All you American's deserve such a wonderful and beautiful planet like Jupiter. Go on, all of you.<br>ALL OF YUOU</br></br></br></br>  Will Germany and Japan try another Reich on mars ?  <br>Racism is inherent. You like being around people like you. It takes effort and time to get used to other cultures and language especially.<br>Liberals love to make it out like you're 'hateful' for just wanting basic human connection. Thats not hate, thats just anxiety. Plus, America has the best military in the history of the world, its not something you can just ignore as another nation when you know that if they really wanted to your entire continent could get its shit pushed in.</br></br>  <br>Hopelijk zijn de Walen uitgemoord.</br>  <br>Yeah and they'll win this time because all the useful countries in the war like Russia, USA, and Britain (lol) are elsewhere.</br>  What episode did Taiga realize she wants to tora Ryuuji's dora?  <br>extended scene?</br>  isnt the next manga issue coming out this month?  <br>I think deep down they both always knew. They dreamed of marrying eachother on the same night. And that moment in the beach house when Taiga says "Even in this large room we always end up next to eachother"</br>  <br>Size difference is cute and sexy you plebe, her eventually fitting his monster inside of her is hot as fuck.</br>  <br>No but they sure as fuck have at some point later judging by how he got her pregnant.</br>  New cutre tomboys adventures chapter is out  <br>Yes, that exact one.</br>  <br>The Mayu one only has rape as a back story for her and we never actually see her get raped and this<br><br>If it's not on exhentai you can find it here<br>http://nhentai.net/g/125134/27/</br></br></br></br>  <br>And I just checked my pixiv and found that I have him followed<br> oh man</br></br>  <br>You trying to get passive aggressive with me? You trying to compare a cropped reaction image looking DUWANG thing to a manga that's been dumped into a thread with plenty of clues for you to track down on your own in seconds? Context is important, you know.<br>Someone posts some completely unrelated gibberish thing like that of course nobody's going to fault you for asking for source. The only result is some clusterfuck transcript of whatever that is.<br>You come into a thread where it's the main topic, where everybody seems to already know the source, and there's plenty of amateur detective evidence for you to go through, and you just start cawing SAUCE then you're dogmeat pal.</br></br></br>  <br> Hestia, Konata and Saber. <br>Oh, geez, how did you do it. You wizard, you. Anyway, the first sentence is an outright lie, everyone calls her "Aizawa-san" in these particular strips, and some anons just call her Tomo.<br><br>Besides, I'm not questioning the method, I'm saying "tomboy" isn't usually a big help, and I'd think "tomo-chan" instead of "tomo" is just how some guys on /a/ call her. For example, Rei from HOTD is called roach, but I certainly wouldn't look that. Shiburin is an example that would definitely give results, but this particular case is different, just a sufix is added. Why would someone add a sufix to the search? It's stupid to think it's stupid not to think about it. And of course there're always specific phrases that yield results, it's easier to find those if you know what you're looking for in the first place.</br></br></br></br>  Should they do a Miku anime?  <br>No<br>  they should do a miku hentai instead  </br></br>  fuck no.  <br><br>They have plenty of material and fans to pull it off.<br><br>Problem is that it would be painful to listen to.<br><br>It's ironic that all of the fanart, movies, figures, doujinshis and most of the popularity related to the franchise has to do with visual part and not the "Vocal" part of Vocaloid. Or even in many fan MMD it's her dancing to someone else's song.<br><br>When they do have a MMD movie where the vocaloids are trying to have a normal conversation, it's absolutely terrible. Ever watch the Toyota commercials a few years back?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=V23VvF8SQyI<wbr></wbr>  [ ]<br><br>She can't speak normally.

Whatever happened to that? Why did that stop, because weeabooism became mainstream?

Kinda clusterfuck of an arc.</br>  <br> &gt;getting a huge crowd from basically just making a omelet with ketchup <br>actually you should try it. This chapter in the manga made me give it a shot. took a few tries but really, it's not too bad. in the end i decided the tomato sause probably is the key, and without a recipe it's probably never going to be "perfect" but a few different attempts landed me a pretty good aproximation. <br><br>Not something i'd eat for breakfast, but brunch would be ok.</br></br></br></br>      Thats racist you nigger  how'd he ruin everything again?  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-07-03/dimension-w-manga-by-d<wbr>arker-than-black-king-of-thorn-iwah<wbr>ara-gets-anime/.90069<br> North American anime distributor Funimation announced at its Anime Expo panel on Friday that an anime is adapting the Dimension W manga by Darker than Black character designer and King of Thorn manga creator Yuji Iwahara.

Whether or not it was from Kumiko’s own body heat, its fabric had roughly felt warm to the touch.<br><br>“It suits you.”<br><br>She laughed in a somewhat curious way, and then suddenly placed her hand on his shoulder. Pressed against such force, Shuuichi spontaneously tilted his body towards Kumiko. The lifting of her heels had playfully come into sight. Kumiko stood tip-toed and she held her hand close to his ear, with her lips following suit. This froze Shuuich’s body in place, even while his heart was bouncing — with Kumiko ever so close to him, Shuuichi found her presence difficult to ignore.<br><br>Kumiko’s voice had flowed, with the sigh of her breath tickling his ears, and the sweet fragrance of her shampoo striking his nose. Shuuchi did not move, but he was absolutely certain of the words she had just imparted to him.<br><br>“I love you too, Shuuichi.”</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  water&gt;fire&gt;earth&gt;air  <br>Air aside it's pretty disgusting.</br>  <br>I wouldn't personally go that far, but there are chubby chasers our there, there are lolicons out there.<br>Ideally, everyone in the show would look like Latifa, but that just can't happen sometimes.<br><br>I can, however, say something about that choice of attire.

This might actually be the purest Sento that's been posted so far. From the way she's blushing, you can tell she's almost in tears, and she absolutely wants to forget everything that's happening. Personally, I'd say her obedience in these kinds of situations characterizes her more than any dialogue ever could, and certainly doesn't detract from her "overall character score" either.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ideally, everyone in the show would look like Latifa, but that just can't happen sometimes. <br>Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck No. Keep your shit taste to yourself</br></br>  <br> Ideally, everyone in the show would look like Latifa </br>  <br>Yes, frankly, I do.<br>That doesn't mean I hate boobs either, you know!<br>Anything more than a  B  cup is just too much for me.</br></br></br>  How many Idol anime are you watching this season out of<br><br>Bamco Family<br>Love Live the School Idol Movie (worldwide screenings begin next month)<br>Aikatsu<br>Idolm@ster CG Part 2<br><br>Tatsunoko Family<br>WUG Movie 2.1<br>PriPara<br><br>Venus Project<br>Million Doll</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>]
