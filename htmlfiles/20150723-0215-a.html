Old Touma and Egypt arc when</br>  <br> And came back riding a meteor </br>  <br>High Priest &gt; Kars</br>   “It isn’t like you. It isn’t like you at all. Kamijou Touma, did all of this logical fighting come from that girl’s knowledge? Are you being dragged along by her way of thinking? If so, I can understand why this has been so uninteresting.”  <br> “You ran away as soon as you saw me? Boring. You fled all throughout Academy City? Oh, how boring. Just when it seems I’ve caught up, you use compressed gas cylinders to create magma? Oh! How! Boring!! All of this has been a complete waste of time!! Think how I have to feel going along with it all! I’ve been waiting this whole time for you to use Imagine Breaker against me just once!! To be honest, the one thing that was most like you was the courageous dive from the rooftop at the very beginning! Everything has been so boring ever since that girl showed up!! You’ve shrunk down and curled up! You’ve only been using petty tricks to reduce the amount of damage!!!!!”  <br> “You are letting that boring girl drag you around and it is just sad. You are not so small a ‘human’ that you should be contained here.”  <br> “If that girl is keeping you from using your right hand, that is a distinct negative.”  <br> “If that girl is keeping you from saying you will destroy my illusions, then she is already tripping you up.”  <br> “I simply cannot understand it myself, but is it that hard to push someone aside? I would think it is plain as day that girl is nothing but a burden to you. I can’t think of any reason to have kept her with you all this time.” <br> “I can understand fleeing the school with her and I can understand keeping her with you until I lost sight of you. But why after that? If you had thrown her out and had her slip into the crowds, you would have been freed from that annoyance, so why did you keep her with you?” </br></br></br></br></br></br>  part 3  <br><br> “Take that grimoire library for example. The knowledge of those 103,000 grimoires might have been helpful. And Othinus might have been able to give you some accurate advice from the viewpoint of a Magic God. Then you would have been able to clench your right fist and challenge me to a battle focused on Imagine Breaker. That would be the proper way of doing this, but it all fell apart thanks to that girl. What do you think about this situation?”  <br> &gt;“Heh heh. Argue from a position of emotion or willpower all you want. It does not change the fact that she was, in fact, a burden. What does that girl understand of magic? Not to mention of the territory known as a Magic God. What use is someone who has fallen so hopelessly behind? Enough pretending, Kamijou Touma. You were honestly growing sick of having to lower the conversation to her level, weren’t you?”  <br><br>Hot damn. Mikoto was literally destroyed. Annihilated. BTFO is short to describe it.<br><br>Based High Priest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Oho hoi~</br></br></br>  <br>Uho hoi</br>  <br>More like she'll now be aware of what she's facing and improve to help the Touman.</br>  Uho hoi~  All the shit mikoto has done this volume and only reasons for why it is good that she is there is because her ignorance allows him to pretend the situation isn't as hopeless as it really is plus protecting girls gives him strength. I guess that clarifies that he really is still scared shitless of magic gods and used mikoto tough it out.<br><br> all high priest wanted was for touma to give him a moralfag speech and punch him in the face OT style </br></br>   “You are letting that boring girl drag you around and it is just sad. You are not so small a ‘human’ that you should be contained here.”  <br><br>AHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAAHA</br></br>  <br> so why did you keep her with you?” <br><br>I found this strange as well.<br>Why would Touma keep Mikoto with him? Wouldn't it be better to leave her somewhere else and continue away from High Priest? Touma didn't really answer that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's not getting stronger than she currently is no matter what, so too bad for her.</br>  <br>Honestly, this volume is just proving that the "Kamijou Touma Magic God Fan Club" jokes were actually completely correct.</br>  <br>Is she going to learn magic because if not she isn't going to be aware of shit and even if there were gods left she wouldn't be able to get to their or even god's right seat level without help.</br>   If she had fallen behind, then she had to gather her strength and move forward more than anyone else. The greater her debt, the more she had to build up speed and catch up as soon as possible. Wasn’t that all this was?  <br>Well, that confirms it.</br>  <br> Is she going to learn magic <br><br>She can't.<br>That would kill her. She might still learn how it works, but using it would be lethal.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, isn't he just evading the question?</br>  <br>Confirms what</br>  Does the imaginary number district work on magic gods?  <br>Yeah it didn't hit me until I already posted, but magic knowledge could help her counter some things.</br>  Is any other Level 5 a match for them?  <br>That she's getting a power-up in the next few novels.</br>   It was no different from seeing a plastic bag on the side of the road and wanting to remove it. <br>Oh, hey, a callback to the Volume 1 Prologue.</br>  <br>That honestly would be so cheap and stupid.</br>  <br>Even a full powered, white wings Accelerator would only do a tiny bit better than Mikoto. And even he would probably get called a burden, too. But maybe not as hard as Mikoto did</br>  <br>N U I T<br>U<br>I<br>T</br></br></br></br>  <br>Accelerator, Kakine, and Gunha would all sure as hell be more useful than her.</br>  <br>I doubt even Accelerator with his White Wings would be any threat.<br>Also, Gunha was BTFO by Ollerus when he had impure Magic God powers. <br>Level 5s can't really compare to Magic Gods.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes it would, if he really was protecting her that should be the first thing he does. No other escort mission has stopped touma from fighting NT10 is a prime example of that and he never really tested his fist on a MG.</br>  <br>She'll be useless at this point, even with a cheap power up.</br>  <br>It was already hinted in Railgun.<br><br>Connecting her to the Network would grant her a truly ludicrous powerup.</br></br></br>  <br>oh hell no, Not even all of them at once with their most powerful incarnations could stop Fiamma let alone a magic god.</br>  <br>Exterior doesn't exist anymore, and Aleister has plenty of better cards to play than her.</br>   "NT13 HAS MISAKA BEING BTFO BTFO BTFOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOO"</wbr> <br><br> Mummy-man says some shit but Touma says how it actually is <br><br>Why are shitposters so damn lazy nowadays?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Exterior was only needed to hack the Network and force Mikoto to connect to it.<br><br>The only thing Misaka would really need to be able to connect to the Network would be a Testament machine.<br><br>A  "New Testament"  designed specifically for her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure he rectified it by saying he wouldn't mind having his hand melted just to shut him up. Doesn't mean it didn't happen, retard.</br>  So, guys, where is Mikoto getting BTFO?<br>I'm not seeing it.<br> gets called a burden <br> Touma defends her <br> HP gets literally BTFO </br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the "she's going to get a power up soon" crowd is stupid, but it honestly has been foreshadowed, which means it might happen. I agree with your "better cards to play" statement, however, I think his better card is not a single person but a group of people, of which she is part</br>  <br>And High-Priest was saying that just to make him mad?<br>Are you stupid?<br>Brain-damaged?<br>A baka?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aleister is just a silly human who couldn't see Kamisato Kakeru.<br>His keikaku will fall apart soon enough.</br></br>   “It was because Misaka was with me that I made it this far. She kept my trembling legs moving, supported my heart as the pressure bore down on it, and kept me in a position to make jokes. With Index, things may have been too focused on magic. With Othinus, it would have been exclusively about Magic Gods and having a clear understanding of their strength might have crushed me with despair. It was because it was Misaka. I survived this long because she was the one by my side. She saved my life and you want me to tell her to back off because she’s in the way? Who the hell do you think you are!? You don’t understand the first thing about the human emotion of this human world, but you’re trying to act like some all-knowing god!!!!!!”  <br><br> “So take it back, you piece of shit Magic God!! If you badmouth the person who saved my life any more, I’ll go punch you just like you want!!”  <br><br> “I don’t care if you’re covered in magma or if you’re over one thousand degrees! Imagine Breaker? I don’t need that for you and I don’t care if it doesn’t work on you! I don’t care if my fist melts away or if my entire body bursts into flames. Yeah, if you don’t shut that filthy mouth of yours right this instant, I’ll keep punching you until you finally do!!!!!!”  <br><br>Based Touma.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> gets called a burden <br> toumas defense is her being useless gives him strength <br> even misaka doesn't like that answer </br></br></br>  <br>HP was right about almost everything though. You're just a whiteknight faggot like Touma.</br>  <br>If he was just saying to to make him mad he wouldn't have carried on with it after Touma started running again and had left the room, he truly believes Misaka is holding him back</br>  <br>Except all the shitposters were claiming that Touma was the one telling Mikoto to go away, when it's literally the opposite, he wants her to stay.</br>  <br> being useless <br> she literally saved his life <br> if he went full IB on HP he'd probably die, as that was what HP was expecting <br><br>Come the fuck on.<br>Hell, Touma even explained that punching him would be stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Noukan alone and the Kiharas are more important cards than all the level 5s together.<br>Besides, at this point I doubt Aleister can't just produce more Level 5s if he needs.</br></br>  <br>That's why she's holdings him back, trueTouma would've punched him regardless the consequences.</br>  <br>What are the kanji for his name?</br>  <br>Yeah, he wanted her to stay so a magic god could rip her to pieces.</br>   (I’m only a burden to him!!)  <br>okay, no more misaka</br>  <br>And then this happened.<br><br> (I’ll do it.) <br><br> In that case, this was no time to be sitting around worrying. <br><br> (I swear I’ll do it.) <br><br> If she had any complaints and if she had things she wanted to correct… <br><br> (I’ll catch up to him!!) <br><br> She had to start by telling him!! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And died horribly.</br>  <br> Just checked the Japanese wiki and it seems that the name of the new character that appears at the end with World Rejector is not Kamisato Takeru but Kamisato Kakeru.  <br>Kanj: 上里翔流(かみさとかける)</br></br>  <br> believing that bullshit when it was misaka who kept trying to confront PH directly  <br>He already hoped on the bike and was running when mikoto appeared.</br></br>  You guys do realize that even if Touma completely agreed with the High Priest he'd never come out and say that, right?  <br><br>This really should've happened way back in the first series.</br></br>  <br>To quote Touma<br> You’re a complete stranger, so quit acting like you know who I am!! </br></br>  If Imagine Breaker is so important to the gods, why did Othinus try to destroy it?  <br>I think it actually did. I know for a fact it happened back in NT 3, she just never had the chance to act on it.</br>  <br>Heh? Even thought they know EVERYTHING about him.</br>  <br>She didn't?<br>Are you retarded?</br></br>  <br>Saved him by being a burden. The desire to protect her is what saved him but that isn't what she wants thus she was btfo. She thought she was being helpful but she wasn't and she can't except that she was being helpful by being unhelpful.</br>  <br><br>So Laura is a step before Crowley in the main keikaku. <br><br>This can't end well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Reread NT9 because clearly you missed major points like Othinus straight up saying she wanted to use it for herself</br>  So what now? A Mikoto training arc?   “Grit your teeth, High Priest. This might ruin my right hand and I might really have to get it amputated at the hospital, but I’ll trade that arm for your face!! Prepare yourself because I’m going to keep beating you until you realize the error of your ways!!”  <br><br>ITS HEREEEEE</br></br>  <br>I want to build on this question. I don't quite understand Othinus. Why did she need to put Touma through those million hells to make him commit suicide? I vaguely recall something like "If I kill you, IB will find a new host and it'll be a pain in the ass to hunt it down again" or something, but that doesn't make sense because if Touma killed himself via building jumping, wouldn't that happen anyway?<br><br>Basically why did Othinus keep fucking reviving Touma, what good would it do to keep him alive? Did she want him to be a soulless husk of a person, completely broken and out of the way?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Two boring filler volumes.</br></br>   Touma trying to rationalize why it is better for misaka to be there instead of index and othi <br> even though he tried to call them as soon as he could </br>  <br>He would've denied himself if he said it out loud, even if it's true.</br>  <br>Man, you guys are really reaching. For the past few weeks it's all been "Touma's going to tell her off, she's going to run off and avoid him forever!"<br><br>When the actual scene is Touma saying he wants her around and Biri deciding to try and be more useful to him and find out more about him. You want to move those goalposts any further or...?</br></br></br>  <br> Kamisato <br><br>"Understands God"? "Admonishes God"?</br></br></br>  <br>AAAAAnd he didn't do it.</br>  <br> Did she want him to be a soulless husk of a person, completely broken and out of the way? <br>Yes, consciously at least that was the idea that he'd be easiest to use in that manner. Unconsciously she was also putting him through that to have him experience the hell that her life had been and achieve her other goal of having someone who understood her, which is why in the end having got it she brought back Touma's world to how it was</br></br>  <br> everyone on the internet is the same guy </br>  <br> Raildex <br> training <br><br>She'll get tossed aside while the England arc is up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's explained that she put him through what she herself went through as she wandered through endless worlds. She wanted someone to understand what she went through, since it's simply impossible for any living human to comprehend her history.<br><br>I think the last scene before she turned everything back had her admitting she was lying to herself about her motive.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, he's only an flawed, imperfect highschool boy isn't he?</br>  So ultimate 'being like him' turns him into the One who Purifies Gods and Slay Demons ?<br>and misaka's role is the stopper of that ?</br>  <br> England <br>Please more Kanzaki.</br></br>  <br> Did she want him to be a soulless husk of a person, completely broken and out of the way? <br><br>Maybe Othinus is into femdom. Wouldn't put it past her.<br>I found it pretty hot how she would torture him with the infinite worlds and make him smell her scent from time to time.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The One Who Purifies Gods and Slays Demons <br> The One Who Admonishes Gods and Something Something? </br></br>  <br>Please stop injecting your shit fetishes into Index</br>  <br>damn</br>  Man, I have to agree with High Priest, Touma the utterly insane punchaholic is more exciting than Touma the Keikaku Science Man  <br>Well yeah.<br><br>It'd be really dumb.</br></br></br>   “Boring, boring, boring, boring!!!!!! At last, at long last, it looked like the winds were changing, but that girl!! Are you going to run away after all this? How many times have I told you it is only a matter of sooner or later? How long are you going to delay the inevitable!? What happened to Imagine Breaker!? What happened to your right hand!? What happened to the One who Purifies Gods and Slays Demooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnn<wbr>nnnsssssssssssssssssssssssssss!?</wbr>   do you feel Touma in this volume is boring ?  <br>It's also because they already planned to ship HP into space. Into that comet to be more precise.</br>  <br>I'm not into scat, though.</br>  <br><br>Kamachi already did it.</br></br>  <br>I disagree honestly. The scene in the WW3 arc where Touma does freaking math to figure out the flight path of a bomber to fake a bombing run on some magicians was really awesome.<br><br>Or the scene where Touma uses heat expansion to disable a terrorist's gun.</br></br></br>  <br> implying punching the magma mummy wouldn't burn off his hand and release the dragons </br>    <br>I find Touma in general boring. But this volume wasn't as bad as usual.</br>  <br><br>I feel Touma is boring for the last 20 volumes. With few good moments here and there.</br></br>  <br>Honestly, yes, PTSD Touma is boring as fuck but you can see more of his flaws in his current self.</br>  <br>Touma always keikaku science man. but in his previous battle he never keep running away like this.</br>   Touma with Kakine <br>The entire city slowly gets destroyed and replaced with dark matter as they fight High Priest.<br> Touma with Accelerator <br>Increasingly ridiculous amounts of fire power until they eventually just chuck High Priest into space, like they did here.<br> Touma with Gunha <br>Just try every way of punching him. Invent entirely new ways of punching.</br></br></br></br></br>  What if the entire series is really Touma's keikaku?  <br>That would be awesome. Damn Misaka</br>  <br>What was the most heated danger he faced off against? Innocentius was only 3k degrees C, compared to the possible 6k degrees C of the magma HP ate.</br>  <br>While they were cool Touma's best kind of moments for me will always be stuff like him just running straight at Gabe to run punch her back to Heaven even if it means drowning in the Arctic(or was it Antarctic?) ocean, along with riding a fucking sword thrown by a Saint to punch out a princess of England that has been empowered by the UK, and Archangel Michael</br>  <br>Innocentius is also magic so his hand would negate it.</br>  <br>Probably Fiamma's flame sword.</br>  <br><br>Did he write it in a certain magical index?</br></br>  <br>He's so-so, High Priest was the real selling point of this novel, fucker was even more glorious than Bullshit Master St. Germain</br>  Railgun 78<br>https://mega.co.nz/#!rwxVhajY!TG9wQ<wbr>-HI4QzOy6DtHzZZ8ZhjQrX-Qu842_HD_EuC<wbr>VB8</wbr></wbr></br>   people saying touma running away is good because fist fighting a god is stupid <br>as if any of this was fucking smart.</br>  <br><br>Finally. The only part of the franchise where Mikoto is a good and likeable character.</br></br>  <br>Word.<br>I love High Priest's antics.</br></br>  <br>When will the new chapter come out?</br>  <br>THANKS.<br>Finally Saiai using LN outfit</br></br>  <br>This is before amnesia in Volume 14 and muh feelings in Volume 16, mind you.</br>  <br>Both in the new volume and now the new Railgun, Hanzou's really getting around</br>  <br><br> Did THK forced his existence into the Raildexverse?</br></br>  <br>Wow I hadn't thought of that. God fucking damn it Misaka</br>  <br> Saiai actually have flat chest complex </br>  <br>The High Priest's rant does match up perfectly with /a/ rants about her</br>  So this is your concept of "BTFO"?<br> High Priest shittalked her, Touma told him to shut the fuck up and she realized High Priest was kind of right and decided to improve (which of course won't happen like all the other times Mikoto decided shit).<br> I don't see how this is her getting BTFO.</br></br>  <br>HP had a more viable and logical reason to say Misaka was very unnecessary in this volume.</br>  <br>I disagree, he just told him the obvious, I didn't saw any shittalk in his words.</br>  <br> could've gotten more info on the Dragons <br>Fucking Misaka, High Priest was completely right about you</br></br>  <br>I don't see any blatant over exaggerated shit talk but he was being antagonizing</br>   Naruto reference in my Railgun manga <br>I don't know what think about it.</br>  <br>She's still somewhat rekt since Touma said she was useful because of how useless she was and he had someone to protect, he didn't mention anything about her helping him or the like, it realistically could have been him saving any girl, and Mikoto realized that and was upset by it</br>  <br>Pointing out the obvious about the massive difference in level, knowledge, powers and importance in such a blunt manner is precisely blowing the fuck out of her.<br><br>The truth hurts, doesn't it? It's the same shit.</br></br></br>  <br> fremea massages frenda's boobs <br> those shadow clones <br>7/10 good chapter</br></br></br>  <br>What is BTFO?</br>  <br>it the truth though</br>  What are the chances of High Priest actually being right about imagine breaker? Hasn't everyone else who tried to say what it is ended up being terribly wrong?  <br> Biribiri and Touma Forced Operation</br>  <br>Blow the fuck out</br>  top fucking kek  <br>You realising that you're not a hero, just a trash.</br>  <br>Index is the Naruto of the LNs after all.</br>  Saiai best ITEM  <br><br>You mean the only part of the franchise that is still good.</br></br>  <br> Not liking the LNs </br>  i want in this room  <br>Haters blown the fuck out by Touma.</br>  <br>Is that a hotel rented by Mikoto or a safehouse of Saiai's?</br>  <br>The haters telling everyone to wait for the translation were just retarded, don't worry about it. Mikoto got the farthest thing from BTFO this volume.</br>  <br>some internet cafe</br>  <br> beds in an internet cafe <br>For what purpose</br></br>  <br>For the NEET on the go?</br>  <br>Too bad Mikoto indeed got rekted by HP.</br>  <br>For the nearly homeless and poor tourists<br><br>Source: A cheap tour of Tokyo lodging in net/manga cafes</br></br></br>  <br>That's fine, because HP got rekt right afterwards in more than one way.</br>  Based High Priest telling characters what we all really think about them all along.  <br> we </br>  <br>This. Just because Touma bullshitted a defense that was basically "she helped by being useless" doesn't mean High Priest wasn't right. Nothing's changed. It's still over.</br>  <br>Only by Noukan. Touma getting angry and replying back was exactly what HP wanted to begin with.</br>  <br>And tries to come back by crashing a comet, but gets BTFO by Noukan afterwards. Wow...This volume has a lot of BTFOs.</br>  <br>a lot of Japanese live in internet cafe since their wage not even enough for cheap apartment</br>   calls Othinus a failure of a Magic God even though she became one by becoming a real god, unlike him who became one by failing to rise to the position of Buddah <br> The only failure here is you, High Faggot.</br>  <br>People didn't want him to become Buddha though because politics.</br>  <br> Doesn't change the fact that he failed.</br>  <br>He is a real god though, just because politics tried to bullshit his righteousness and godliness away, doesn't mean he didn't do it</br>  <br>This<br><br>Humans are morons, HP only wanted to save people.</br></br></br>  <br>Everything is failure for HP thought</br>  <br> It's still over. <br><br>What's over? I'm not even sure why HP's opinion matters. They're discussing the difference in power in Touma and Misaka's relationship. If Touma is fine with it and Misaka wants to become better and also still wants Touma in her life...why is HP relevant? He has no say in what they do (especially since he's about to get fisted by the new guy).</br></br></br>  <br> He wanted to become a Buddah. Did he become a Buddah? No. He failed.</br>  <br>Still became a wandering "Buddha" nonetheless</br>  <br>He perfectly ok with results so it isn't fail.</br>  <br>But did he become a God? Yes he succeed.</br>  <br>The procedure was correct. The judges were corrupt.</br>   dat Muginos     You would probably be in for quite a shock if you looked into the origins of Othinus who you keep by your side. <br>What does it means?</br>  <br>I prefer Fre myself.</br>  <br> That's not how it works.<br> He accepted that he couldn't become a Buddah and instead choose to become what humans desired him to be. Accepting failure and moving on isn't the same as not failing.<br><br><br> He didn't want to be a "God", he was trying to become a Buddah.<br><br><br> The judges deciding if he was a legit Buddah was part of the procedure.<br><br><br> Yeah, something close to a Buddah but not a true Buddah, which is pretty much the same thing Othinus was before the end of NT8, and he mocked her because of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's referring to the how Othinus killed herself to become a Magic God by hanging herself</br>  <br>I think he means the stuff like gouging out her eye hanging herself from the tree and shit like that, I'm not familiar with Norse mythology though so there might be more to it but that's the basic idea</br>  <br>She's a viking she probably did some hardcore shit back in her day</br>  <br>Did Othinus ever tell Touma about how she became a Magic God to begin with?</br>  <br>Can you please spell Buddha correctly?</br>  <br>Well since they went for her eye he knows some of it at least, don't think she mentioned hanging herself though</br>  <br> The judges deciding if he was a legit Buddah was part of the procedure. <br>You're mixing the physical procedure to become a Buddha/Magic God with the subjective scoring to acquire the title of Buddha.</br></br>  <br>Thor did back in NT 5.</br>  <br><br>She's a man originally, baby!</br></br>  <br> Yeah, sorry. Should have checked how it was spelled.<br><br><br> But being given the title of Buddha is required to become Buddha. It was even mentioned in that chapter that the reason he became a Magic God instead of just becoming a Buddha was because of those shitty judges.<br> Otherwise, every single faggot who reached buddhahood would be walking around and causing trouble.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HP is a Buddha thought, the corrupt priests didn't give him a title/name so he's a wandering Buddha referred as "High Priest".</br>  <br>Can you point out where to me? Scanning for her name in it didn't give me much</br>  <br>Guys do make the best girls after all</br>  <br> But he isn't a true/complete Buddha, just like Othinus wasn't a true/complete Magic God.<br> I found it weird that he shitted on her for that.</br></br>  <br>someone need to massage Kinuhata chest</br>  <br>Wasn't he calling her a shit for caring too much about her own world or finding someone who understood her rather than giving no fucks like they did?</br>  <br>She and Mikoto can rub each other's chests</br>  <br> Otherwise, every single faggot who reached buddhahood would be walking around and causing trouble. <br>Those other "Buddhas" either did the procedure incorrectly or gained their status thanks to politics.</br></br>   “If that girl is keeping you from saying you will destroy my illusions, then she is already tripping you up.” <br>So that's why he didn't say it at all this whole volume.</br>  <br>I think the only time he's said it in all of NT is in NT10.</br>  <br>And what a glorious moment that felt like.</br>  Did Kihara doge appear yet?   However, he did not clench his right fist and try to smash the mummy’s face in. The High Priest had already asked if he honestly thought he could save them all with only Imagine Breaker. <br>HP put Touma on those cautious rails to begin with. It's just more of him trying to break Touma through shifting logic.</br>  <br>She's a failure because she didn't realize what it really meant to be a Magic God and instead "wasted" her power on petty things like destroying world. The exact reasoning went:<br> &gt;Othinus was remarkable yet went a bit too far </br></br>  <br>lewd</br>  <br>Raildex has had ninjas since forever.</br>  <br>Sorry I remembered it wrong. In NT 9 There was an exposition by Kamachi, specifically Ch. 8 Pt.4 to which it was said that Kamijou doesn't know anything about Odin's History. Also in NT10, Othinus only mentioned about her eye in the prologue as a part of her ritual to become a Magic God.</br>    Akasaki Chinatsu's angry voice <br>Yes please.</br>  <br>nope</br>  <br>You haven't read Naruto I take it</br>  <br>Tomorrow</br>  so which Seiyu would be perfekt for High Priest  <br>He mainly meant the summons of frogs and shadow clones thing but...<br><br><br>You do know that it did not originate from Naruto right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah right, yeah I was sure he knew about the eye since they went to go fetch it but wasn't sure where it was said she hung herself from a tree and if he knew, thanks</br>  <br>Ninjas? Yeah, but the summoning of a gigantic frog being a ninja power I'm relatively sure isn't a normal association to make with ninjas</br>  <br>High Priest doesn't strike me as someone capable of being deliberately antagonizing. He has never lied and he always speaks what he truly feels, never wearing any masks, or having any hidden motives.<br><br><br>Thor did say this to a dizzy Touma in NT5 after their one-on-one:<br> &gt;“To befit the original meaning of the name, I headed down a certain path. If that girl hadn’t taken such ridiculous measures to gain knowledge even if she had to pull out one of her eyes and hang herself, I could have stood at the top of Gremlin.” </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Seeing as how he was, appearance-wise, based on Fate's Matou Zouken, I'd say the guy who voiced him.</br>  <br>Houchu Ohtsuka. He'd do the OHO HOIs perfectly.</br>  <br>lol so I was remembering it right? Dang what's wrong with my brain?</br>  <br>He's already Terra's voice.</br>  <br>Jiraiya is an actual historical ninja. Hell, all three of the old guard come from the same Japanese folktale. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jirai<wbr>ya</wbr></br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jirai<wbr>ya</wbr></br>   Prepare yourself because I’m going to keep beating you until you realize the error of your ways!!”   So weren't Kamikotofags supposed to be on suicide watch or something? I don't see it.  <br>Sorry, I was mistaken. NT6, not NT5.</br>  <br>Ninjas actually are associated with summoning things thanks to the legend of Jiraiya. Look it up in Kabuki theater and Japanese mythology.</br>  <br>Shit, I forgot about that. Wakamoto's already taken too, so I guess it's Zouken after all.</br>  <br>Kamikotofags aren't even a thing anymore. If there are some who still seriously ship them, I feel sorry for them.</br>  <br>Why? Touma literally just told everyone he likes having her around</br>  <br>What happen if my way is correct and right and yours is not Kamijou-chan?</br>  <br> everybody talking about magic gods <br> lets bring up that shipping wars shit posting </br></br>  <br>Kamijou's path is always right.</br>  <br>Kamikoto is still very much a thing.</br>  <br>It's alright. But Kamijou still didn't know about Odin's history though, so at the time that was said to him, he had no idea what that meant.</br>  <br><br><br>Well shit you showed me I guess, shows what I know</br></br></br>  <br>Would be awesome to see a Human othinius.She was probable quite awesome.<br>The Magic Gods have one Great problem they don´t take anything seriosly enough.<br>Othinius was different thats way i am expecting that next Volume the Magic Gods are freed and Magic god Othinius as their Leader will finally beginn the MG keikaku.</br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't Touma check a book out from the library if he knew he was facing One Eyed Othinus eventually</br>  <br> I'd rather talk about Naruto than shipping </br>  <br> Magic Gods <br>You do know that only one is left right</br></br>  <br> MG keikaku <br><br>But True Gremlin is just a glorified and ridiculously powerful Touma Fanclub. They only want TouMAN-senpai to notice them.</br></br></br>  <br>It's still the most popular pairing despite what a very vocal minority thinks.</br>  <br>Magic Gods are great because of how little shits they give though</br>  <br>You do know there were a bunch of Magic Gods in that phase Aleister destroyed right?</br>  <br>Yeah no, after seeing how flawed he is, I will reconsider 2 times if he's right or not.</br>  <br>Why check a book out from the library when your roommate IS a library?<br><br><br>Kamisato killed them all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't count if they're not showing up on earth</br>  <br>That I don't know so I can't help you answer that really good question. In fact, why is Touma not doing any research in the occult at all? He could just ask Index, who started to become irrelevant to thanks to this plot hole(is it?)</br>  <br>It's important to remember that Naruto had extremely few original ideas, a good chunk of the abilities and naming came from Japanese Mythology.</br>  <br/>  I know it's just a quibble, but the height scale seems a bit off.<br>Shouldn't Mugino tower over the others?</br>  <br>Either or really, the point is you'd think the guy who's analyzing his enemies on his feet trying to find a weakness, how their power works or the like, if he has prep time would do at least minimal research into them</br>  <br> The ones mentioned were High Priest, Nephythys. Niang Niang, Zombie and Chimera.<br> So far Zombie is kill and we don't know what happened to Chimera. By the end of this volume only Nep will be left.</br></br>  So AccelxMikoto is Endgame OTP?  <br>Poor HP, that Touma died with NT9.</br>  <br>They're all highschool girls, except for Saiai who should be shorter since she was retconned into being 12, so not really</br>  <br><br> that sisterhood by fellow flat chests <br><br>Brings a tear to my eye.</br></br></br></br>  <br>10032xAccel<br>KakinexMikoto</br></br>  <br>why?</br>  <br>So basically Touma is shitting himself inside but because misaka is there he have a reason not to go despair.<br><br>Basically if. misaka wasnt there he would have given up already.</br></br></br>  <br>The only height we got from her was in OT15, and she was wearing heels + leaning forward. I would estimate her to be a few cm shorter than Accelerator (which is 168).</br>  <br>they are not dead just very far away.<br>I kinof see Kamisato as someone importent but also a reason for Othnius to act.</br></br>  <br> HP sees the events of NT9  <br> sees touma fight a god and refuses to give up despite many deaths <br> and he even comes close to punching her <br> HP hopped that could be him one day <br> finally gets his shot and touma lames it out </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> given up alread <br>He is Touma.<br>silly anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Yep apparently index and othinus giving magic side advice would only make it seem more hopeless. Misaka seems to think that means anybody ignorant to magic and easy to talk to could take her place. I don't really like his explanation but at least it filled the plot hole of why he is so cool with magic gods now when he was practically pissing himself with fear last volume.</br>  <br>Basically. Mikoto being there allowed him to be more lighthearted and keep him from despair. She doesn't know shit about magic(and obviously doesn't really care too much), so it put him in a good mood.</br>  <br>I mean, NT12 didn't seem like Othinus was making the situation worse but whatever works for Touma I guess</br>  why Touma did not just accept their offer but refuse their reward?  <br>Because they're being little shits and living their lives incorrectly.</br>  <br>Isn't that sort of torture?</br>  Mikoto BTFO.  <br> He was going full-despair till he found out St Germain was fake, though.</br>  <br> why Touma did not just accept their offer <br>HP would've killed him on the spot.<br><br> If that boy were to give in to him, the High Priest was sure to immediately behead him without a second thought. </br></br></br></br>  <br>In NT it wasn't a god so her telling touma that fixed him right up. right now he is certain HP is a god and othinus would probably tell HP is unbeatable or at least that is why he thinks. Even HP said the only threat to full powered magic god was other magic gods.</br>  <br> Because he wanted nothing to do with a bunch of shits who would give absolute power over the world to a normal highschool boy.</br>  <br>He's ptsd Touma after all, I don't think he knows where the moral line is anymore.</br>  <br>He almost got an even better show with dragons, too.</br>  <br><br>I'm talking about the scene just before that, where he lost to Hamazura and he was assuming he was about to go challenge a magic god, Othinus only said "wait did you say Germain" after that. I'm saying during that he didn't act like she was making the situation worse and told her to help him out again in the future if he lost his way</br></br>  <br>I have the biggest boner now. Make it happen Fuyukawa.</br>  <br>If Thor has taught me anything it's that HP just needs to shoot himself to make Touma serious</br>  <br> She wasn't making it worse but she wasn't improving it either.<br> He was going full "GOTTA STOP THIS FAGS FROM CAUSING THE END OF THE WORLD AGAIN" before she told him to calm down and explained him shit.</br></br>  <br>I was counting calming him down from going full despair as helping but maybe that's just me</br>  <br>And Mikoto doesn't seem much taller than Saiai either even though she should be.</br>  <br> Yeah, but the point is that she wouldn't be of help in this situation because this is a legit Magic God.<br> She could only tell him " Yeah, he is genuine, you are fucked" and that's it.</br></br>  <br>It wasn't exactly the kind of calming down that was needed. It was just relief that St. Germain wasn't a real Magic God and he was all "Oh, ok, this isn't as bad as I thought" where if St. Germain actually was, he'd be all "SON OF A BITCH IT'S EXACTLY AS BAD AS I THOUGHT"</br>  <br>Yes, yes we hear hear you</br>  <br>flat</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128421960 <br>That was in response to him losing to Hamazura</br>  <br><br> “Your true value is different from that of a Magic God who has to determine superiority <br> by the presence or absence of power. Isn’t that right? <br> So feeling ashamed that you lack strength is pure foolishness. Your value shows <br> itself once you accept what you lack and <br>think about what to do without that strength.”<br>I'll remind you this was before he or Othinus knew Germain wasn't a magic god</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> “Your true value is different from that of a Magic God who has to determine &gt;superiority <br> by the presence or absence of power. Isn’t that right? So feeling ashamed &gt;that you lack <br> strength is pure foolishness. Your value shows itself once you accept what &gt;you lack and <br> think about what to do without that strength.” <br> When he heard that, Kamijou’s eyes finally narrowed softly. <br> He reached a hand toward Othinus and rubbed her small head with his &gt;fingertips. <br> “You are being too friendly, human.” <br> “Sorry. But make sure to remind me.” <br> Kamijou spoke without shame. <br>Sure?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Deliciously so. Fre a best. Though Nda is good too.</br>  didn't know misaka met the ninjas in railgun.<br><br>around what date of the timeline is the current arc?</br></br>  <br>She's talking about Magic Gods though, he wasn't so worried about losing to Hamazura as he was the fallout he was going to create fighting a magic god</br>  <br>Meeting them in a dream doesn't really count, you can't even see his face</br>  <br>No, he said he was weak and she said that he can't be as strong as a Magic God and to accept that he can't do everything.</br>  <br>Frenda a shit. A SHIT.</br>  <br>She didn't meet them, it just happened to be one of the cards she got.<br><br>Its after Vento's invasion but before Battle Royale.</br></br></br>  <br>~October 4. 5 days before Battle Royale.</br>  <br><br><br>I see.</br></br></br>  <br>yep because index and othinus wouldngive him the cold harsh truth<br><br>Not knowing how fucked up the situation is a bliss afterall.</br></br></br>  <br>You have to be trying to miss the point this hard</br>   saiai will never call Accel sempai   <br>Nice job ignoring the first part<br><br>------------<br>“…”<br><br>Kamijou Touma let out a weak breath while lying sprawled out on the floor.<br><br>He had been punched all over and a groaning pain reached him whenever he moved a joint.<br><br>Hamazura and the Power Lifter were gone. Only the jacket he had used for defense remained. After the system recovered from the errors, Hamazura had likely climbed back on and gone off to save his friends.<br><br>(Ahh…)<br><br>Unable to even cover his swollen face with his hands, Kamijou spoke blankly into the air.<br><br>“I really am weak.”<br><br>---<br><br>“Make no mistake. If all you were was strong, I would never have been saved in Denmark.”<br><br><br>for the rest<br><br>She was talking about his inability to stop Hamazura. She was comparing him to herself. They weren't talking about Magic Gods at all except in relation to how he saved her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ok guys so did anti touma happen or not?  July 21. After Stiyl tastes Imagine Breaker for the very first time, Touma brings Index to Komoe's place, after which Index is healed and Komoe gives them refuge for the next three days.<br><br>Meanwhile, Kuroko arrests Trick after destroying a building, and Saten gets herself and her friends juiced on the Level Upper.</br></br>  <br>What did this have to do with anything?</br>  <br>Is that<br>Accelerator</br></br>  <br>She was still giving him reasons to not worry about what the magic god might do and why his worth was found differently, he also right after that scene had resolved to figure out a way to try and fight germain despite him being a magic god (supposedly) so it still stands, even if you want to argue that's not what Othinus was going for, that she managed to make him not despair over it and find the courage to face a magic god again</br>  <br>Not yet. He only shows up at the end.</br>  <br>I'm just pointing out tidbits of the assumed timeline as it correlates with real-world dates.</br>  i'm glad kamachi came to write more feels and emotions than before othinus arc.<br>too bad new charactor syndrome is incurable though.</br>  <br>Thanks anon. The suspense is killing me.</br>  <br>It was a genearl statement it calmed him down.<br>that´s enough.</br></br>  <br>No it's Yuriko</br>  <br>The new characters were the best part of this volume though, I'd understand if you had made this complaint last volume.</br>  <br> yfw Kamachi makes her real. </br>  <br>Whats so bad an New charakter?<br><br>when you do differnt things you will meet different people.</br></br></br>  <br>It was enough to calm him down in the face of what he thought was a magic god, and no different than what mikoto is doing unintentionally. Really I don't know why touma is acting like silly shenanigans wouldn't happen with index and othinus, both have had those situations in dire situations.</br>  <br>She just gave him the resolve to not want Hamazura to be the reason the world blew up. Not specifically about the Magic God at all. This was just him wanting to protect Hamazura, not the actual courage to face a Magic God.</br>  <br>Which brings me back to </br>  <br>High Priest was realy good.<br>I kind dont like Kamachi for killing him.<br>Niang-niang was interesting powerwise <br>so i hope she will be ,,freed,,next volume.<br>about nephty we havent seen much she sounds like a nee-san to me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm really bothered about Touma not using his right hand on the priest too, it probably wouldnt work, but he is tecnically a dead body alive by magic. Would be worth the try.</br>  Imoto a Archetype?<br>was A Certain Academy Index basically Aleister Archtype controller going wrong?</br>  <br> he'd probably die <br>HP said he doesnt plan on killing Touma though. It would not even make sense.</br></br>  <br>My god, you didn't even understand the entire point of this did you? This was not Othinus alone calming him down to face a Magic God, this was Othinus using Hamazura to calm Touma down. The entire point of all this was that Index or Othinus would not work to help Touma not fear Magic Gods without help from others. This is why Touma said that if he had just them alone, all he'd get in information telling him how fucked her would be and to know the full extent of power of a Magic God while people like Hamazura or Mikoto who don't know jack about it would just let him think about their protection and what he can do to prevent it. It's similar to knowing you have a 100% chance of failure of an unknown chance of failure. Obviously, you wouldn't want to know you have 100%.</br>  <br> If that boy were to give in to him, the High Priest was sure to immediately behead him without a second thought. <br> He doesn't even realize he would probably kill Touma if he gave in.</br></br>  <br>Why are all Magig Gods so fickle?<br>only expection is Ollerus.</br></br>  <br>But only if is Accel's twin imouto. <br><br>Otherwise i won't agree, i need the edgy albino to bang some lolis and clones.</br></br></br>   Mikoto's novel <br> Touma still pretty much has all the best scenes and spotlight <br><br>This is the Sisters arc all over again, isn't it?</br></br></br>    <br> Ollerus <br> Magic God </br></br>  <br> Mikoto's novel </br>  <br> Ollerus <br> Magic God <br> Turn off the computer, Silvia.</br></br></br>  <br>That part explicitly mentioned how fickle High Priest is. I don't think Nephthys or Niang-Niang would have killed him on the spot, but Touma still didn't want the easy way out of fighting one Magic God with another.</br>  <br> &gt;Touma with Gunha <br> Just try every way of punching him. Invent entirely new ways of punching. <br>I need this in my life</br></br></br>  <br><br>He's a failure due to saving a cat.</br></br>  <br> Misaka seems to think that means anybody ignorant to magic and easy to talk to could take her place <br>I don't quite get why that seems to hurt her so much. I mean, whomever you are, anyone else who also had x, y, and z qualities could take your place, right? It seems sort of meaningless to stress over something like that.</br></br>  <br>Well, it was supposed to be her novel like how Misaki had her own novel.</br>  <br>NT12 Afterword<br><br> It’s about time for Mikoto to have her turn in the spotlight, isn’t it? </br></br></br>  <br>She wants to be important to the guy she likes so knowing she can just easily be replaced by someone else is a pretty harsh blow</br>  <br> She learns to visit the Beta world to learn how someone taking your place doesn't shit on what you have done.<br> FUCK, didn't she tell Touma that it didn't matter if someone else could have taken his place and saved the Sisters because in the end the one who did it was him?<br> I think it's about her being useless as anything but a damsel in distress than about the posibility of someone else taking her place.</br></br></br>  <br>When x quality is as broad as being ignorant of magic it pretty much means your crush thinks of you as the same as literally any other girl, that's going to hit home</br>  <br>yea but Othinius is the same.<br> great power. No firm direction could be felt in it. Or perhaps, it was not needed to be felt. <br> It was the ultimate form of power wielded as an individual. <br> No thought was given to what effect it would have on the future. </br></br></br></br>  <br>If you think about it, it's all her fault. This brings me back to things she has said in the past, like in NT2 where she tells him that he isn't alone. Like, seriously? Anyone who even has the most basic idea about Touma's character knows that he's always backed up by a lot of people.<br><br>Instead of getting closer to him she kept her self-entitled stance and went on incorrect assumptions about his character. This is the only correct way to shattter her illusions and the only way she can actually learn from her mistakes and the situation she's in.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Got you fooled hey.</br></br>  <br>I forgot to add that Nephthys/Niang-Niang warned Touma that they'd destroy the entire archipelago if they helped, and Touma didn't want to agree to the deal even if he could reverse that damage.</br>  Where the fuck do I start with this?<br><br>Manga? Light Novel? Which Manga?</br></br>  <br>The not alone part refers to how Touma before NT9 would never ask for those people's help and would attempt to resolve issues without involving others at all if he could help it. This was a real part of Touma's character and made sense at the time. Why do you think it's such a big deal to everyone when he actually starts asking for assistance and everything?</br>  <br>why do you want to start?</br>  <br>I think rejecting Neph had more to do with her outright telling him that they would end up wrecking the city than it being the easy way out.<br><br>If it didn't have any drawbacks he might've been willing to accept their help. He never had a problem with Othinus zapping them to Denmark.</br></br></br>  <br>I have nothing better to do with my life.</br>  <br>Index LN, Railgun manga.</br>  <br>Light Novel, then Railgun Manga. Accel Manga if you really want.</br>  High Priest makes a good point. Touma has been unlike himself. More than the usual PTSD break down.  <br>LNs are the source material, "Index" LNs are the main series. Everything else is an adaptation and/or spin-off. Do with that what you will.</br>  <br> Light Novel.<br> You have like 35 volumes plus all the side stories so it will keep you entertained for a while.</br></br>  <br>I would just like to remember that Touma admitted in NT10 that he doesnt actually believe what he says, he just bullshits everything to make his opponent get his guard lowered.</br>  <br>"Easy way out" also included relying on the MGs to reverse their damage later on, and he never wanted to wield that kind of power. What happens the first time is what truly happens: that was part of Will's argument, and that was what stopped Touma from saying yes to High Priest in the first place.</br>   “I could have chosen a different path if I was with Index? I could have taken the best possible path if I was with Othinus? That’s not what this is about.” <br><br>I am very interested in how it would go if Othinus was with him. Never thought about it before, wonder what crazy shit he would do.</br></br>  <br>Makes sense.<br> When the opinions of all the many gods were gathered, it &gt;created a single flexible system. <br> As long as that system ultimately led them down the right path, &gt;everything was fine. <br> Those existences were known as gods, but they still had &gt;doubts and failures like anyone else </br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't mean Mikoto was using the correct approach. And it's not like he hadn't asked for help before. This is true after getting ditched afterwards and realizing in NT5/6 that no matter what she did, she could not force herself onto Touma and think that would be enough to stop him from doing what he always does.</br>  <br>It seems like that's taking it unnecessarily hard, though. I mean, if this were a romance in a mundane setting, and the MC told a girl that she was easy to talk to and he appreciated having someone not from his workplace/university/social-circle to talk to to take a breather, no character would say "Oh, no, that means I'm inconsequential and could be replaced by anyone!" but for some reason, this is a recurring issue with Raildex girls.</br>  <br> Did you missed the point? She would tell him " You are fucked up" and he would go full despair mode.</br>  It's scenes like this where you can tell the difference between nimrods who can't read between the lines and have a very superficial understanding of what's going on versus people who make sense of the latest development with what they knew beforehand and come to a balanced conclusion. Too many of the former on /a/ tbh  <br><br>Yeah I would like to see more of that and beyond.</br></br>  <br> tbh <br>FUCK OFF</br></br>  <br> tbh <br> vague generalized insults <br/></br></br>  <br>That doesn't sound like the "best possible path" to me</br>  <br>She wouldn`t do you know why?<br>because it´s obvious.</br></br>  I still say Kamikoto isn't happening and that she will re-evaluate her feelings, especially if she actually has realized she's not a huge asset to him. Hell, she doesn't even have a completely accurate picture of the Sisters project which is why she "loves" him. Why would she have an accurate picture of anything else? I don't hate her and am even glad Touma defended her but it doesn't change my opinion of the chances of their ship happening  <br> You read it wrong he said in a "What the fuck are you talking about, nigger?" kind of way.</br>  <br>Everyone knows Kamikoto isn't happening though.<br><br>I swear, people who get defensive and are in denial over that fact have to be trolling or just are retarded and underage kids from MAL or AS.</br></br></br>  <br>He literally said "that's not what this is about" keep reaching though</br>  <br> No, you don't get it.<br> He didn't mean that choosing Index or Othinus was the "best possible path", he was getting mad at HP for thinking so.</br></br>  <br>She wants to be his equal, but Magic Gods create that significant disparity between them.</br>  So much for #3 level 5. <br>Why academy city espers are so elitist again?</br>  <br><br><br>I always interpreted that "you're not alone" part as "no matter what happens, in whatever circumstance, I will be there for you". Because yes, Touma is backed up by a lot of people, but sometimes they're off doing their own thing or can't help him under certain conditions. Biri was playing the "faithful waifu" card where she unconditionally has his back. Not that it ever came through, and Touma didn't care, but at the time I thought it was a sweet thing to hear from a capricious middle school girl like her.<br><br><br> I still say Kamikoto isn't happening <br>No shit, Sherlock. In terms of waifufaggotry there's going to be nothing on the plates unless Kamachi pulls a fast one on us. I just want my dream team, Imagine Breaker and Railgun. Probably won't come to fruition until the climax though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So is Mikoto finally going to learn about magic? will she also get a lesson from Birdway or Othinus?  <br>The best person to learn magic from is probably Tsuchimikado</br>  <br>Why? Even Accelerator and Hamazura didn't get much more than a crash course. Why on Earth would Birdway bother giving Mikoto more than maybe an hour's worth of lesson? If it's the quick abridged version, Touma just as good.</br>  <br>Maybe. I mean, are they even aware that she doesn't even have all the facts on the Sisters Project which is the whole reason she loves him? She doesn't know the first thing about it other than it happened. She also doesn't have the first clue about who Index is and her relation to Touma, which would only scratch the surface of Touma's life. She truly is clueless. I want her to to learn more about the Sisters and just what the hell was going on there more than I want her to learn about magic</br>  <br>It's not happening, but I don't see her re-evaluating her feelings before we really get to the home stretch.<br><br>I also don't think her realizing she's not that useful is a big deal-breaker - unless Nephthys joins the harem, there aren't any options that are particularly useful at this point.</br></br></br>  <br> Touma didn't care <br>More like he's still keeping his promise to Etzali to "protect her world".<br><br>And that world of hers shouldn't include magic.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Etzali <br>I feel for the guy, I hope he marries one of the clones at the end</br></br>  <br>He's got double dose of delicious brown.</br>  <br>Kamachi forced to write Mikoto novel. isn't it?</br>  <br>Why so hyperventilated, bro?</br>  <br>At least she got a taste of her own medicine.</br>  <br><br>C'mon mane we had enough of that shit this thread, don't bump wit that</br></br>  so do you think its basically over with the Magic Gods?<br>I don´t</br>  <br>See, that's the main issue with her. She should at least try to spend some casual time with Touma, getting to know him on a personal level, his history, his interpersonal relationships, the world he's living in and the problems he gets involved in all the time, without blowing a fuse and accepting that he's a chick magnet that is always into ridiculous hit, which is the cause that their casual meetings are short lived most of the times. It makes her feel just superficial; her words have barely any weight. It also makes hard to take her reasoning and motivation seriouly. Why would she repeatedly go that far for someone with no special connection or tie with her? Her position in the story sadly doesn't allow her to be heavily involved with the central plot, which hurts her potential a lot. She was putting a lot of thought about all this at the start of NT13, but it was again shafted in favor of comedy and flanderization.<br><br><br>Yeah. A good start would be simply going to his dorm and know what Othinus and Index mean to him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't even have a clue about her own backyard (the Sisters) why should she worry about Touma's?</br>  <br>She's not even relevant to the Sisters plots anymore.<br><br>I'm only saying that because her entire character in Index revolves around Touma and it would help to make her motivations and feelings for him actually solid.</br></br></br>  <br>She's had a crush on the guy for thirty volumes and doesn't know anything about him.</br>  <br><br>I'm saying she doesn't even have a complete understanding of the situation that brought about her crush. If she did, would her feelings change? If the Sisters are so important to her she crushes on the guy for saving them shouldn't she start by having an understanding of that</br></br>  <br> She should at least try to spend some casual time with Touma, getting to know him on a personal level, his history, his interpersonal relationships <br> casual time with Touma <br>lol<br><br>She's tried a couple times but Touma has a busy schedule, world-saving and girl-punching and the like. On the off chance she catches up to him, he's having a fruit cola moment and doing something so stupid that she tries to fry him. I'm beginning to think this is all planned.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The issue with her is that when she did try to at least get some info about his problems and shit Touma never lets her dig deeper and she never tries to dig deeper, that's why she's been trying to force him to accept help, so she can actually try to help him.</br>  <br>Maybe not her feelings, but it could very much serve as catalyst for development. It could lead to her keeping her emotions in check when she sees him surrounded by girls or in ridiculous situations. She really needs to stop being fucking ignorant about everything though.</br>  http://bato.to/read/_/334189/toaru-<wbr>kagaku-no-railgun_ch78_by_anonymous<wbr></wbr></wbr>  I don't know about HP, but Touma running around and doing stuff to try and slow him down wasn't boring in my opinion.   Fremea massaged Frenda's breasts <br> Based on her comments, Frenda has little interest in having a larger rack <br><br>So. Why did Fremea massage Frenda's chest?</br></br></br>  <br>HP is just upset he didn't get into a fisticuffs match.</br>  <br>Mikoto shouldn't go anywhere near Touma's dorm until she can control herself. As is, she'd just get pissed about him living with girls and burn all his shit.</br>  <br><br>In short, they're just not on the same wavelength, they lack any chemistry whatsoever. It just shows how unrequited and hopeless her crush is.</br></br>  <br> She was showing favoritism to Fre.</br>  <br>Not really, seeing how well they're getting along in this volume+ the fact that Touma doesn't think she's truly a burden then that means something is improving, there's definitely some chemistry either way though.</br>  <br>Based Hamazura appeared</br>  Hmm looks like retarded Mikotohaters BTFO. Thank you based Kamachi.  <br> Mikotofag starting shit again </br>  <br>I respectfully disagree the chemistry is romantic. They would be awesome as bros, though. This volume shows they make a decent enough fighting team. And he does have some respect for her. I'd rather them become close that way</br>  <br>I never said it was romantic anon.</br>  <br> they're just not on the same wavelength <br>My point is that they're not even on the same radio network most of the time. On the rare occasions they are (and sticking together, as opposed to Touma running off somewhere and leaving her behind) they do all right.<br><br><br><br>I fucking hate you cunts. So tired of seeing "BTFO" in muh Raildex threads</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm more interested how something that is a major thing said on /sp/ somehow transited to here.</br></br>   57 poster <br>I see the quality hasn't changed</br>  The romance shit is what brings Mikoto and Touma's interactions down.<br><br>They were at their best as rivals in the beginning.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, they are better as pals.</br>  <br><br>What romance stuff? You mean one sided crush?</br></br>  <br>I started seeing it a lot more on /a/ right after Kill la Kill aired.<br> IRC BTFO <br>and so forth<br><br><br> What bad luck <br>Is that supposed to be fukou da? How did YP translate Fukou da anyway?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Mikoto growing in a different direction (or never having had the romantic subplot at all but that's too late) would be awesome. Imagine if this volume had happened without the romantic subplot and she was just a spunky science sidekick wondering why her bro was acting weird. She'd be goddamn amazing.</br>  <br>/sp/ memes always find their way here somehow. I think tbh is theirs, right? And da burrs basically got refashioned in /a/'s image.</br>  <br>I don't really need to imagine anything since this volume is amazing enough for me.</br>  <br>See </br>  <br>A lot of /a/nons browse /sp/. <br><br>You should see important game threads. There is always a "who /a/ here" post with a lot of replies.</br></br></br>  <br>"tbh" is frowned upon though.</br>  Why are there two threads in the catalog<br>One is at 333+ posts<br>And it's burning</br></br>  <br>Either one is valid.<br><br><br>The first Railgun scanlation wasn't of the best quality.</br></br></br></br>  High Priest was truly the spotlight of this volume.  <br>I don't see why you make a big deal out of it, tbh.</br>  <br> University City <br>Hahaha</br></br>  <br><br>tbh I thought was a /brit/ thing that is major on /int/ along with lad<br><br><br><br>Most aren't /a/nons as do you really think and actual /a/non would go to /sp/ and randomly scream out WHO IS ALSO FROM /a/? Hell most probably just do that to annoy people.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because the other thread isn't about the discussion of NT13 and the new Railgun chapter?</br>  <br> do you really think and actual /a/non would go to /sp/ and randomly scream out WHO IS ALSO FROM /a/? <br> I do that.   Only in world cup threads though <br><br><br> isn't about the discussion of NT13 <br>They're arguing about Mikoto's exploits in this novel again</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How did YP translate Fukou da anyway? <br>Rotten luck.</br></br>  <br><br> do you really think and actual /a/non would go to /sp/ and randomly scream out WHO IS ALSO FROM /a/? <br><br>Most of the times they even have reaction images from currently airing shows, so some of them are /a/nons.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That isn't too bad, actually. Better than "such misfortune".</br>  <br>Even Index wasn't safe.<br><br> yfw da Indekkusu wins da Toumab owl </br></br></br>  <br>Did the bears actually win in the end?</br>  <br> tfw German and first time in my life cross boarded to just laugh at Argentinians <br><br>It was a strange feeling.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br> Fuck you.</br>  <br>Are you a negro?</br>  <br><br>Don't worry, you will get something eventually.

Your misakaboner is obstructing your ability to read and comprehend, faggot.</br>  If other girl (such as kanzaki or itsuwa) helped him and HP called her a burden, would Touma defend her as well?  HP so fucking based and even knows Touma should be decking guys again.  <br> Implying Crowley doesn't actually know </br>  <br>Why ask a pointless question?</br>  <br>Of course.</br>  <br>Why wouldn't he?</br>   HP bitching about misaka  <br> Didn't just kill her off </br>  <br> HP bitching about no fisticuffs  <br> Didn't just get into an actual fist fight instead of using giant hands. </br></br>  <br>Don't you see? He wanted Touma to dash through his earth arms, breaking them one at a time, then punch him in the face.<br>Then he'd go on a spiel about his beliefs and he'd get Touma to say he's gonna break the illusion.<br><br>He just wanted to get infected with the T Virus because he's lonely for female company.</br></br></br></br>  <br>OT Touma is dead.</br>  <br>Look on the bright side. He'll stop reforming villains and giving them harems.</br>  <br>Which is why NT is shit.</br>  <br>Jokes on you, I like both. I miss seeing him punching people though.</br>  <br>You missed the point so hard it is not even funny. Did any of you assholes ever stop to wonder why she hasn't been educated on the matter? Touma hates the magic side and does not want the people he cares about poisoned by it if he can help it. As long as she is ignorant of that bullshit, she appears like a beacon of hope to Touma who wants to get away from that shit. Why do you assholes hate Touma so much?</br>  <br>I actually like current Touma, and  his eventual fall. </br>  <br>Hate the magic; love the girls.</br>  <br> Touma hates the magic side <br>Eh, that's kinda stretching it, he just knows that nothing good will come out from mixing esper and magic, that's why he was surprised when Birdway gave the talk to both Accel and Hamazura</br></br>  <br>The hand wringing begins.</br>  <br>The point is he basically admitted that the only thing keeping him going is having someone to lean on who isn't a part of that world.</br>   Touma will never punch a chick again <br><br> Accel will never have a role for years because he's too strong  <br><br> Tsuchimikado doesn't even do shit no more <br><br> Fiamma is almost as bad as kakine now </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tsuchimikado doesn't even do shit no more <br>Well he is "technically" dead, so he's free. Free to live the carefree normal highschool life that Touma can only ever dream of now.</br></br>  <br> Free to live the carefree normal highschool <br>His entire school was on a manhunt for him while he was wearing a trench coach designed to look like he's naked underneath.</br></br>  <br>That's perfectly normal by AC standards.</br>  <br> Fiamma is almost as bad as Stiyl now <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br>there are people still living much shittier lives in AC, actually thats not really all that terribad comparatively for some of the shit going on there.</br>  <br>this.<br>at least fiamma didn't lose his identity and become a beetle as well as a volleyball.</br></br>  I've really enjoyed this volume. That Touma speech was awesome.   tfw most of this volume was spent on a shitty bike chase   <br> shitty </br>  <br> he is tecnically a dead body alive by magic <br><br>Just like Niang-Niang and Neph. He knows IB won't kill them.</br></br></br>  When will Touma get stronger and use his true power? This volume is starting to get boring since most of it has been a whole bike chase.<br><br>Also why does the hot bitch look like she's going to job in this illustration?

Idk</br>  <br> power-up <br>Kamachi hates power-ups, and I have come to suspect that the entire theme of the novel, or at least in Aleister's plans, is that the magic goes away forever.</br></br>  Koreans are evolving at a frightening pace.  <br>Well, it surely is frightening</br>  <br>Manwhas have upped their game.<br><br>Looking for Father<br>Gamer<br>And a few others have good stories.</br></br></br></br></br>  Soon they'll be able to steal as good as the Chinese  <br>Scared already?</br>  <br>Are you implying that The Gamer is anything but shit?</br>  I just want DalDal to win  <br>Yes?</br>  Call me when they make something as popular as Akira  This manhwa is my guilty pleasure  Is that supposed to be a good example?  <br>Thank god, since lolis are dying in Japan, we might have a substitute soon?<br>I sure hope so.</br></br>  <br>It used to be much, much worse.</br>  <br>Lolis will never take off in SK<br>Their laws are too strict for that shit<br>The most you can hope for is that their art improves</br></br></br>  <br> Their laws are too strict for that shit <br>So is Japan's, that's why lolis are dead  please confirm it LRD I know you'r ehere in anime.</br></br>  <br>Thats not anime/manga related.</br>  <br>What, do you think I should show this to /co/?</br>  <br>Korean and Chinese comics have been pretty good for a while. Plus they're often in color.</br>  <br>Lolis are eternal. They will never die.</br>  Reminder that in the next 50 years Japanese anime will die and Korean anime will take its place<br><br>Reminder that Korea does most of the animation work for both Japanese and western animation</br></br>  They had always been OK.<br>Good authors have been publishing in Japan under Japanese names for ages; Korean never paying to feed their manga artists.<br>Personally I find their works too violent and my racist side irritates too much to read them though.</br></br>  <br><br> popular  <br><br>So qw should call you when they make something popular like narutu?</br></br></br></br>  <br>All they do is the mind-numbing inbetween work. They basically have no creative talent.</br>  <br> evolving <br>Okay then.</br></br>  Koreans are incapable of coming up with an original idea. Everything is a ripoff of something from japan.  Switching reading direction feels strange.  <br>Thats not anime/manga related.<br><br>Please fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>That I disagree, they can do violent shit quite well and people don't care about creativity as much as you seem to believe.<br>As a racist I believe Korean artists who can do sweet vanilla and creative shit are dying to get out of the country though.</br></br>  I heard there's a novel version. Anyone care to inform what's been omitted?  <br>Fuck off back to reddit you dumb nigger.</br>  <br><br>Mods actually confirmed Manhua/Manhwa to be /a/ related.</br></br>  <br>The yuri fandom in  tumblr  goes absolutely nuts over that yuri webcomic</br>  <br>And mods allowed Naruto on /a/. <br><br>Its dumb and you should go to /co/ or some other website.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a pretty good comic, genre aside. It's one of the things I look forward the most in general.</br>  i cant stand to read MC name kim jon un , hwang bee , be ol  <br>At least we have North Korea for lolis.</br>  <br><br> I am starting to feel bad for the guy. Honestly, does it get better for him, or is he the butt monkey 24/7?</br></br>  <br> tumblr <br><br>This is why we shouldn't allow this korean shit on /a/. You people are retarded.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw most anime is made in korea </br>  <br>Was she a dog the whole time or something?</br>  <br>Me too anon.</br>  <br><br> That was made by a korean, yes, but in Japan. It is technically a manga.<br><br><br><br> A demon of some sort. On that manga some creatures with strange powers were able to show themselves and others in shapes not their own.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  koreans and chink stuff is getting quite solid, who is next to join the weeb alliance.  <br><br> Yes, we, should do what you want and not what we, the users, want nor what the current owners of the site, the creator of the site, or the people that run it rule is proper.<br> Forbid the thought that we ever offend your superior taste, based on groundless suppositions and fallacious generalizations. <br> God speed anon, keep on watching great anime like Evangelion and DeathNote while mocking those kids that watch Naruto.</br></br></br></br>  "The Gamer" is a reasonable high power mary sue story. It doesn't go overboard with revenge or selfish acquisitions.<br><br><br> Koreans are evolving at a frightening pace. <br><br>No, more like the audience's tastes are evolving as it becomes desensitized to power level inflation in the stories that come out year after year. While there have always been stories with absurdly high power levels, they hadn't been mainstream popular. However, the audiences in china, japan, and korea seem to be gradually more accepting year after year of higher and higher power levels and situations where the main character is even more obviously a "mary sue" than before. <br><br>So it is not that korean authors are evolving. It is more like the mainstream audience tastes are evolving to become more accepting of obvious mary sue characters and absurdly high power levels and stats.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shhhh, don't break their delusions that all animes are made in japan nowadays</br>  <br>You are pretty fucking dumb, aren't you? Is this a copy pasta I forgot about?</br>  <br> animes </br>  <br>At least is not as bad as the chinks and their Xin Xan, Yin Yan, Xun Xen, it's like they selected a dozen of syllables and just make combinations for every name.</br>  <br>Hardly an endorsement.</br>  <br>ITT: koreaboos</br>  <br><br> Great answer, as expected of you. Did you go to college to learn how to make fallacious arguments and dodge subjects? You majored on politics?</br></br>  I don't mind korean shit, but reading left to right is almost as weird as the names for me.<br> How fucking hard are those names to remember </br>  <br> Looking for Father </br>  <br>I'd say authors have learned how to handle high-power characters without completely destroying the storytelling.</br>  <br><br> The problem  and/or advantage, depending on how you look at it  of Korean stuff is that it is mostly from Webcomics. Some great stuff can brew there, but the crappy editorship and easy to overcome selection processes mean that more material with copy-pasted plots and crappy concept on the long run get done. On the other hand great authors that might otherwise be ignored get a chance to shine, much like how ONE became famous thanks to him working online, although that's from Japan, of course, the example still works.</br></br>  <br>That fucking hand is wider than the girl.</br>  <br>They are onto something.</br>  <br>As hard/easy as remembering japanese names</br>  <br> mary sue use that many times, never well. <br><br>That term lost all its meaning so long ago, I don't know why people bother using it anymore.<br><br> Also, if you feel like arguing that you are using it right, please go ahead and define it. <br> I am not asking you to provide example of why the MC is or not a MS, just define Mary Sue.</br> </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hardly. Something like Kukuri is way easier than something liek Han-Jee-Han-Bo-Ching-a-Ding-Long</br>  <br><br> Honestly? For me it is easier than Jap names, more often than not. They are just like, two words of three letters each or something. You can just remember the first three anyway and that's enough.</br></br>  Fuck, I welcome it. More competition will make the nips produce better work. <br><br>We need 'merica to get on it.</br></br>  <br>Just Kukuri is equivalent to just Han-Jee, not really that hard.</br>  <br>The Legendary Moonlight Sculptor is pretty good too.<br>I hate the korean names though, irritating as fuck.</br></br>  <br>So it really is copy pasta?</br>  <br><br>The Gamer isn't even the best naver webcomic in terms of art anon</br></br>  <br><br> le epic surprise box <br><br>It really made your posts funnier. Upvoted !</br></br></br></br>  <br>but they're rarely coloured decent/well</br>  <br>Wait, where is the up vote button?</br>  <br>Oh, have we reached this point at last? I'm glad people are finally rebelling against this faggotry from /co/.</br>  <br>They will NEVER EVER get good at Dota.</br>  <br>I don't think so, but he seems to be having a fun time.</br>  <br>shes probably going to evolve next chapter and will no longer be a loli.<br><br>koreans have some good things, pic related.<br>too bad she was mostly ignored during the 2nd part.</br></br></br></br>  <br>All loli grow up at some point.</br>  <br>Don't remind me anon, the Breaker broke me. It was one of the best manhwas out there and then it just stopped on a hiatus for god knows how long.<br><br>Why must all good series go on a hiatus.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel like their names are the same three words, but put in different orders. Soo Jon Moon. Moon Jon Soo. Jon Soo Moon. Hate their shitty names.Can't remember them for shit.</br>  <br><br> I use it as () for some reason, it became all the more normal since just pressing a command writes the code instantly. If it bother you all that much I can try not doing it anon, It kinds of seems like a total overreaction over an extremely unimportant detail.</br></br>  <br>The pacing is horrible. Its like he just explaining RPG mechanics every chapter not to mention terrible fighting scene.</br>  <br><br> Yeah, I am not interested. Thanks anon.</br></br>  <br>Looks interesting to me. Guess I'll read it. It it ongoing, or already finished?</br>  <br>Unless suffering is the direct and immediate object of life, our existence must entirely fail of its aim. It is absurd to look upon the enormous amount of pain that abounds everywhere in the world, and originates in needs and necessities inseparable from life itself, as serving no purpose at all and the result of mere chance. Each separate misfortune, as it comes, seems, no doubt, to be something exceptional; but misfortune in general is the rule.</br>  <br><br> I kind of have a hard time getting my head around the fact that you think you are getting somewhere with those answers. Like, do you really think saying "that's copypasta" is a justification for crappy logic and retarded exigences, or are you just going to go on pretending you were baiting now that you feel silly about what you wrote? <br> If you were to answer, the question I mean, that would be wonder, really.</br></br></br>  <br> tomboy <br> yuri <br>ehh...., tomboys are wasted on yuri. Its like having a trap in a het relationship.</br></br></br>  <br>It's ongoing.</br>  <br>No, I really can't tell whether that was copy pasta or not.</br>  <br><br> You must be really stupid then.</br></br>  Talking about Korean's works, how about pic related?<br> The art is webcomic tier, like most, but the gags can be pretty clever at times. EGS is filled with bitches that seem to think that the manhwa is popular due to their translation, so they have no intention of dropping of letting other people work on it, even though they are slow as all fucks.</br>  <br>No, you just post like a fucking newfag. Please lurk more.</br>  <br>And you're saying like Tezuka was original. Fuck off kindly.</br>  <br>She ends up cutting her hair too if some of the random art is anything to go by. The couple just looks like a guy and a girl.</br>  <br>Cheese in the Trap has a pretty good story with characters with some actual depth to them. The art is simple but good.</br>  <br>he did 800+ series. its hard to be perfectly original with that much.</br>  <br><br> I honestly laughed out loud. <br>Way to meme anon, you sure showed me what a true oldfag is like. Don't bother with me it's too late, go on and be a true oldfag showing people what being a true adult that knows his stuff is like and the other shit you do, I wouldn't know, of course, I am a newfag.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, are you going to pay for the medical expenses replacing my sides?</br>  <br>Nah, it's really not that kind of dumb yuri-lite. Tomgirl gets plenty of boob exposure and such, they're both obviously women.</br>  <br>Yeah, this thing is quite funny.</br>  <br><br> you will never impregnate the girl who demanded you become her adoptive father </br></br>  There are plenty of good Manwha out there you just need to find them. The friendly winter is great if you're tired of the same old character types.  <br>Most of his stories were borrowed, re-written, or inspired by/from. Even Black Jack wasn't exactly original, as he had many of his assistance help him pool the ideas together during his Tezuka Pro days. But I hold him with far more higher respect versus Miyazaki because Miyazaki has very blurred theme and I sometimes can't understand what he's trying to tell behind a story. Not to mention lot of Miyakazi plots aren't originals, either.<br><br>And of course, most of the Japanese plots aren't original, either, nowadays.<br><br><br>Thank you for reminding me about this series. Time to get back on it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I honestly laughed out loud. <br><br>Am I being trolled?</br></br></br>  <br><br>That wasn't gut-punching funny, but I was highly amused.</br></br>  <br>This breaks my heart.</br>  <br>I felt like the series almost had too happy of an ending.</br>  <br>I remember when I was helping out with Ares the Vagrant Mercenary. One of the few series' that actually had decent plot and made me go "damn, eventually, maybe Gooks really can do it"<br><br>Nowadays they're importing back in the plot from Korea into Japan, such as With God, and we have artists that are known to be Korean that's breaking entry into manga audiences  and some are shitting it up, unfortunately </br></br></br>  <br>So when do we get Aniwha?</br>  <br><br> No, but I am having a blast with you. You remind me of a 15 years old that point at 13 years old kids and call them juvenile. No need for logic, no need for a real argument or common sense, thought put behind, or anything really, but always permeate this hilarious sense of superiority from your post as if you knew better for your time, what? 2-3 years tops?, at /a/. It's a fairly common thing, though, but most have the decency to notice when they are making a fool out of themselves. <br> Go on, amuse me, faggot.</br></br></br>  Noblesse has a stupid story but some parts are just hilarious. <br><br>Kubera is just depressing and complicated. <br><br>Orange Marmalade is cute and full of good drama and some crappy characters </br></br></br></br>  <br>isn't this made by the same person who made that guy who's gay for his childhood friend?</br>  Some Korean Manhwa and Chinese Manhua have really good art. My problem with them though is I cannot, for the love of myself, bring to like the characters because of the names. I mean, maybe I just got used to Japanese names but I just can't wrap my head around names such as Luk Lee or Hwang Jae shiz or what have you.  <br>This is some nice copy pasta.</br>  <br><br> And here I thought you would finally give up. Now I get it, copypasta is a term you picked but have no idea what it means.<br> This is as good as when you fell back on fake sense of security by relying on fake prestige from the entity of /a/. Just so you know I will keep on reading your pathetic shit, but I might take some time to answer, if the thread is still up even, due to the fact that I am actually starting to get tired of you.</br></br></br>  <br>Its okay man. I already realized I'm being trolled. You are really good at this.</br>  Who the fuck let this faggoty deviantart shit in /a/. Fuck off to /mu/ you filthy koreaboo  <br>If you mean Korean animes, just go watch your favorite anime, there's about 70% chance that it's animated by Koreans, give or take a few scenes.<br><br>I like to say I'm trolling, but it's a sad fact of the industry. Look it up.</br></br></br>  <br>Apparently it started as a novel, so who knows what got cut.</br>  <br> animated <br>They're literally slaves, what the fuck this koreaboo talking about? What an idiot</br></br>   <br>Ahh, you again. You used that same tactic to defend Kirito as not being a mary sue / gary stu character back when.</br>  <br>Please fuck off to leddit</br>  <br> animes </br>  <br> shit art <br> shit panelling <br> shot design <br> shit story <br> shit character <br> white space <br> no back ground <br>Yeah truly frightening</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You guyz really think it would be a good idea to move Gensokyo closer to Glorious Leaders in Panmanjoun and Beijing just to see what happens when the youkai hits da fan?</br>  <br>The fuck is this crap?

Fuck off to /mu/ with your deviantart manga wannabe trash, gookboo</br>  <br>The Gamer, it's a manhwa</br>  <br>Japanese syllables are just easier for speakers of European languages to sound out and remember, because of their very basic pattern of consonant-vowel pairs.<br>Chinese and Korean syllables are much more difficult and weird for us.</br></br>  <br> /a/ anime &amp; manga <br>I don't see any mention about your shitty gook trash here, fuck off cunt</br></br>  <br> that shitty art <br> dat shitty colored <br>What's rgis?

Retard inbred gook</br>  <br>newfag pls go and stay go</br>  <br><br>at least try to be a bit more creative in your shitposting.</br></br>  <br><br> Koreans are evolving at a frightening pace. <br><br>The stories are becoming more "commercialized" rather than remaining as rough "fanfiction" type stories. That's because more and more korean webcomic authors put more effort into their webcomic stories in hopes of landing a profitable animated TV contract. It helps that some korean-sourced stories were adapted into anime in Japan.<br><br>Some webcomics are also sheparded by IP management firms that supply additional editing services. That's because the IP management firm is handling the promotion of the webcomic. If the author gets contract offers, that IP management firm will manage those contracts and thus get bigger profits. So everyone from the author to the IP management firm wins when the webcomic is improved before its publication on one of the korean websites such as Naver.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Just like american comics and manga are the same right?</br>  <br>if you break it down enough then yes</br>  <br>Not anime nor manga.<br>Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>Why are we not discuss comic and cartoon here?

He gets a broken ability, truth, but he isn't the only one nor the best one either.<br> People are always saying that MC's are deepshits that are made as losers with no talent on purpose to self insert better, but how come a character with a decent mind above his shoulders, or basically somebody who doesn't do retarded stuff, is automatically a MS? <br>Also, the male term is GS.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  all popular korean manga now are webtoon that make my eye turn white because all white background and 3 or 4 little panel.  <br>So... is he retarded or not?</br>  <br>same man same</br>  <br>God fucking damn I managed to brain dump this shit, fuck easygoing scans.<br>Also<br> Ctrl-F Red Storm <br> 0 results <br>Are you faggots even trying?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We are moving down the list, it's really long but rest assure Red Storm is in it.</br>  The fuck is this disgusting shit, fuck off gookboo.

They're tired of The Breaker and the authors themselves claimed they were disappointed with their writing. A few of us were too. I thought the pacing in Season 2 was terrible.

Still off the JP market or got something else? <br>No money no future Korean friends.</br></br></br>  <br> steal <br>Hardly. They do the bulk of animation for the Japanese anyway.</br></br>  Are you people really upset about Koreans drawing comics? Or is it the name manwha that makes you flip your shit? It’s just their pronunciation of the Chinese characters holy fuck  Why does /a/ only talk about Japanese entertainment?  <br>because gooks can't into story</br>  <br> suffering  <br>Every single one of those points in that image referring to scans and scanlations aren't real reasons. They are issues for EOP and in being so aren't real issues.

Honestly I see transparencies and panels of it posted on /v/ more than here.</br>    <br><br>Sorry the cover and the first page weren't in the torrent</br></br>    <br>Resuming with the third page of the actual story now...</br>     Those eyes <br> That blush <br><br>kuudere are truly a patrician's finest product.</br></br></br>            <br>But wait, there's more!</br>    So wait, did he actually stop drawing this because filthy gaijins were reading it?        <br>he got scared of it's popularity, also white piggus reading it made him want to go home.</br>            <br> mfw </br>        <br>That is one of the most stupid reasons that I ever heard. Might as well just draw the comic and then throw it away so no one can see then post it then later be shocked it got popular. I guess xenophobia is still a real issue.</br>        <br>This is the end of it unfortuneately</br>   tfw fuck all vanilla elf stuff   <br>the art changes around here, more shading and stuff. Was there a hiatus?<br><br>and thanks. I'd never seen this second part.</br></br></br>  <br> I came to visit you <br><br>I like this.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it was just something he'd put up on pixiv whenever, it was never a doujin or anything.</br>  <br>Nah, it's just too scary when your pet project suddenly grows way beyond your expectations.</br>  <br><br>the hell are you talking about?</br></br>  I'll keep the question simple, Overlord or GATE?  Overlord  Both are shit  <br>GATE. Overlord is another SAO tryhard with bad animation and characters.</br>  <br>How much screen time does this semen demon get? Really makes or breaks if I pick this up</br>  <br> source material <br>GATE<br><br> anime adaptation <br>Overlord</br></br></br></br></br>  man, Overlord sure is slow as fuck  easily gate  <br>Both are pretty mediocre. Overlord though has superior waifus.<br><br>A-1 also fucked up character designs for Gate. Can these fuckers do anything right?</br></br></br>  GATE was ruined for me by the retarded jingoism, but the start was better than anything in Overlord (I've read the first 3 volumes).   Gate: 24 eps <br> Overlord: 13 eps <br><br>Nuff said</br></br></br>  <br>More.</br>  <br>Overlord. <br><br>GATE gets retarded with a 40 chapter drama bullshit with the Elf going crazy.</br></br></br>  <br> 3eps already fucked up for nothing </br>  <br> was ruined for me by the retarded jingoism  <br>You have no right to have this opinion if you're an Amerifat.</br></br>  <br>I'm not and I find American jingoism more tolerable because they actually have the power to back it up. Japan does not.</br>  <br>but a broken elf is best elf.</br>  <br> American jingoism more tolerable <br> says the 'murrican while pretending to be not american </br></br>  <br>The difference is that America is actually a military superpower, while Japan doesn't even have an existing army</br>  <br>Why would I lie? My point still stands. America has the most powerful military in the world whereas Japan is America's bitch.</br>  What if the only reason GATE exists is to encourage jingoism and radical nationalism in Japan among otaku?  <br>Doesn't matter. It's still fiction and you're retarded if you can tolerate the American one but not the Japanese one.</br>  <br>Only thirteen eps, so not much and the most of it will be her wearing a full suit of armor.</br>  <br>Right now, Overlord. Maybe because i read Gate and did not Overlord LNs.<br><br>Gate i am looking forward to few moments being animated, but not very hype though enjoying it. Overlord for now is fresh, and unlike Gate does not gear gore.</br></br></br>  <br>And? Just because its fiction its based on reality, which doesn't give it an excuse to be full retard and a nip circle jerk<br><br>It's be like watching the Lord of the Rings and the halflings conquered the world from the shire, with no reasoning as to how they accomplished it</br></br></br>  <br>What if you are a butthurt ameri/k/unt?</br>  <br> with no reasoning as to how they accomplished it <br>Melkor. Always bet on Melkor.</br></br>  <br>tojo plz leave</br>  <br>But thats not just gate. It goes decades ago, and passes through many stages.<br><br>From "anti-war" (in reality preparing children to fact that war is hell, but they`ll have to fight to survive even if their goverment is shit) Gundams, mecha in general, Night Raid, SnK, recently AirSoft to wake interest in guns and now Gate and reairing Grave of Fireflies in prime time.<br><br>Its all part of the plan. Anime industry responds to demand of politicians. War and nationalism propaganda was its core for long time, but there are other trends too - like recently attempts to fix the birth rates by propagating marriage and milfs or shows about work to make NEETs think work is actually fun and full of waifus.</br></br></br></br></br>  I'll keep the answer simple, Overlord.  <br>The one with Albedo.  Both shows suck anyway. </br>  GATE manga &gt; Overlord anime &gt; Overlord manga &gt; GATE anime<br><br> reading light novels <br>Hahaha oh wow.</br></br></br>  <br>The only one that sucks here is  your mom .</br>  <br> &gt;Overlord manga <br>Never knew it existed, huh.</br></br>  <br> overlord manga <br><br>Not really fair, since its only 5 chapters in, you should be comparing to the light novel</br></br></br>  <br> Reading period <br>You should be ashamed.</br></br>  The one that is not a rushed one cour with original ending. Also loving these new meme about faggots pretending overshit is good  <br>GATE all the way.</br>   Overlord <br> Protagonist is supposedly Lawful Evil <br> First thing he does is Chaotic Good </br></br>  <br>Just because it isn't called an army, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.</br>  <br>He didn't care about the village, but felt indebted to help them because based Touch Me rubbing off on Sebas</br>  <br> Overlord or Gate? <br><br>Which one has the better art?<br> Overlord <br>Which one has the better female cast?<br> Overlord <br>Which one has the better mc?<br> Overlord <br>Which one has a better opening or closing?<br> Overlord <br><br>That wasn't difficult.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br>Overlord, duh.<br>The only reason why people like the GATE anime is goth loli.</br></br>  <br>Foolish anon. He is extreme evil.<br>Every act of kindness towards humans is a carefully crafted deception.</br></br>  <br><br> /a/ says it's shit <br>Picked up.</br></br></br>  <br>Will ever the assburgers stop shiting threads?<br><br>Gate<br><br>I dont like edge lord MCs, and this is too much power fantasy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not adhering to /a/core <br>Enjoy your SAO clone.</br></br>  <br> edge lord <br>Now there's that word again.</br></br>  <br><br>i will, thanks ;)</br></br>  Overlord<br>Got to give it some points for evil lich MC</br>  <br>Gate. I haven't saw the third episode of Overlord yet but nothing happen in the first two episode. Gate doesn't have pacing issue and it's really satisfying to see modern military not jobbing for once. Also it's 24 episodes instead of 12.</br>  <br>I'm with this guy. Too bad Overlord isn't two cours.</br>  Both are shit. Just watch Rokka no Yuusha  <br> not trusting the collective of /a/nons judgement <br> hownewru.jpg.tiff <br>GATE is about politics and presents a "what-if" scenario where a world full of resources is presented to a modern nation. Overlord is just a generic battle shonen with an edgy dumbass MC who gets the dick for doing nothing, not to mention it being an mmo shit.</br></br></br>  <br>What if the only reason you're acting like that is because you're actually nationalistic at heart and refuse to want to see other countries do it?</br>  <br>It's like you didn't watch anyone of it.</br>  I've watched and read both.<br><br>Gate is about a middle aged guy trying to survive in the fantasy world.<br><br>Overlord is about a middle aged guy whose age stops mattering as the story goes on since it's the NPCs who run the story not him.</br></br></br></br>  Both dropped  <br>Worry not. He will become chaotic evil in no time.</br>  <br>look as a human Ainz was a good guy, but as time goes on the Extreme Evil that was his Lich will change his out look. he already doesn't care about human life</br>  <br> Gate <br> Source material <br> Not shit <br>It's a decent premise ruined by virtue of being little more than a vehicle for the author's fringe political views.</br></br></br></br>  <br>GATE because I'm not American</br>  <br>Nah you're just as right wing as he is, Amerifat.</br>  <br> I'm actually a pretty hard left by American standards. Not quite tumblr-SJW, but far enough. </br>  <br> implying you're not american <br> implying anyone is 'Murica's bitch. <br>Invading 3rd world shit places is all America can do, aside from humanitarians no one really gives a fuck about poor people being massacred. USA wouldn't dare step foot into another 1st world country.</br></br></br>  <br> USA wouldn't dare step foot into another 1st world country. <br>Because first world countries are, by definition, America and her allies. What country in their right mind would invade an ally?</br></br>  <br> China <br> Russia </br></br>  <br>overlord<br><br>are you 13?<br><br>overlord is edgy because the mc is an overdesigned skeleton?<br><br> first world countries </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those are by definition Second World countries</br>  <br>Are second world countries, which are by definition the (former now) USSR and her allies.<br><br>Dumbass.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm having a lot of fun with both.<br>Maybe GATE though because Overlord seems to be moving along at a glacial pace.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Gonna be first world before long. America's just lying to herself</br></br></br>  <br>You need to get out of that cold war mentality, brah.</br>  <br>The terms first, second and third world were created by the US during the cold war to describe the alliances.<br>They are not objective measurements of the development of a nation.</br></br>  <br>You're the one throwing around outdated terms like "first world."</br>  <br><br><br> letting someone dictate what is good and what is bad <br><br>What a bunch of retarded sheep.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Anime industry responds to demand of politicians. </br>  Gate for action and watching military ass-rape roman armies, Overlord for being pretty interesting and wanting to see my childhood edgy online rpg fantasies come to realization.  <br>Overlord just got past the... know what? I'll make a list I guess<br><br>Overlord<br>Pros:<br>* I love the LN and like the manga<br>* Is not being censored as retardedly as GATE<br>* Is not about NIPPON STRONK<br>* Nice character designs, even if Albedo's armor bothers me<br>* Narberal Gamma (best girl)<br>Cons:<br>* The anime is being too slow by like 3 minutes each chapter. Or perhaps 3 minutes too short per chapter. It was late by 3 minutes, then 6, and now by 9. Makes me worried about ep4 being super rushed and skipping important stuff. This may or may not be valid depending on how it turns out. Maybe they will skip the intro and ED to compensate?<br><br>Not a lot of bad things, but it is stacking up on every episode. Let's see how bad it is by the end of ep4<br><br>GATE<br>Pros<br>* They improved Rori<br>* Just getting to the parts I love the most.<br>* Decent music so far. I hope for some sweet Ride of the Valkyries<br>* I liked Rerei's outfit more than the manga's<br><br>Cons<br>* Retarded censorship means they skipped the dragon attack on the elven village. We never got to see it eat elves and villagers, will probably not get to see most of the action scenes because of that<br>* Cute-ified characters. Even the fucking empeor got a facial lift-off and looks 10 years younger. Everyone looks 10 years younger- Not as bad as moeblobs, but dangerously close<br><br>Is really too soon to tell. Must wait for ep5 of each series, apparently</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What are his views? I just saw it will probably have some anti-american propaganda, but that's rather common in anime.</br>  <br>Really? I like the OVERLOR LNs more than the GATE one. Unless you are thinking of the manga</br>  <br> with no reasoning as to how they accomplished it <br>Food, alcohol, pipe-weed. Within a century of the end of Return of the King, the world will secretly be ruled from the Shire.</br></br>  <br>I liked ep3 tho, but it was still too slow.<br><br>They should have started like the manga did, with the battle at Carne, and then do a flashback explaining how they got there</br></br></br>  Gate.<br><br>Overlord really surprised me during the first two episodes and the idea is really cool. Problem is, it gets wasted as soon as the actions start.<br><br>I wanted Nazrick to be sieged by heroes and see how far they could get. I wanted Momonga to get terribly infamous so everyone saw him as a catastrophe when in reality he's a pretty ok guy and the other countries are the real evil.<br>I wanted Momonga to start a fucking kingdom not<br><br> hurr durr let's be adventurers </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Animation is also a big point. Gate &gt; Overlord on that</br>  <br> which doesn't give it an excuse to be full retard and a nip circle jerk <br>It's not. It's just pissed off right wing Amerifats like you who can't take it, and there's a lot.</br></br>  <br>Anime, Overlord<br>Manga wise, Gate<br>shield hero anime when?</br></br></br>  <br>Everybody is evil, I mean everyfriggin body</br>  <br>That reminds me of when someone asked "if you could be reborn in this very world right now, would you rather be reborn as a guy or a girl?" and i answered "it depends on location. Western first world country? girl. Give me easy mode on life for once. Anywhere else? guy, I dont wanna get shat on" and someone said that was retarded because women were suffering on India so why did I say life in wester 1st world countries was easy for women?<br><br> India <br> Western First World Country <br><br>Since fucking when?<br><br>China and Russia are 2nd world countries, by definition. Even if China is now the world's greatest economy, it is still a 2nd world country. Look up what 2nd world country actually means, please.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sebas-chan isnt</br>  <br>Im gonna assume you think "1st world" means "developed"<br><br>During the cold war, the americans and their allies thought the world was divided thus:<br><br>One side was america and its allies,<br>The other was russia and its allies<br><br>Thus, you had "two separate worlds" of politics and ideologies. 1st world, just means "america and its allies" and 2nd world just means "russia and its allies" but they were all considered modern and advanced countries to live in.<br><br>You are confusing politics with economics/sociology, and seem to think 1st world means "premium quality" or something like that. Its just a geographical and political division, that's all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is too much "how it worked in the game" sequence in Overlord for my taste.<br><br>On the other hand GATE anime failed as an adaptation. Or as anything.</br></br></br>  <br> war is hell </br>  <br> On the other hand GATE anime failed as an adaptation. <br>Gate is not manga adaptation.</br></br>  <br>Both are absolute shit.<br>But Gate &gt; Overlord.<br>MMO anime is always worst in any comparison.</br></br></br>  <br> glacial pace <br>Its about four episodes per volume, if I'm lead to believe. The first volume was heavily laden with setting shit up, getting you interested in the cast and the situation, and ended on a huge note of  lich overlord killing the fuck out of angels </br></br>  <br> GATE is about politics and presents a "what-if" scenario where a world full of resources is presented to a modern nation <br>It's not. It's just an excuse to pit /k/ against fantasy for shits and giggles and that's great. Being an idiot is alright, being pretentious as well is just obnoxious.</br></br>  <br> what if the sky is blue </br>  <br>Diplomacy &gt; all, no man left behind etc, just obnoxious nazi bullshit like that<br><br>they should just nuke those filthy savage slavers. For humanitarian reasons, you know</br></br></br>  <br> I wanted Nazrick to be sieged by heroes and see how far they could get. <br>In the new world they are in, no one would get past the first damn floor. Even back in YGGDRASIL, 1500 players and NPCs raided Nazarick and were stopped dead at the 8th floor<br>  I wanted Momonga to get terribly infamous so everyone saw him as a catastrophe when in reality he's a pretty ok guy and the other countries are the real evil. <br>Ainz plans to do that in the second volume, he starts working as an adventurer in an attempt to create a heroic reputation, then drop the charade and give all credit to his true identity, thus spreading the name Ainz Ooal Gown far and wide. He's not looking to be an evil tyrant, he just wants to try and find other players in the new world. Also the other countries aren't evil, they have yet to be shown that way, they have some evil people inside, usually nobles and such, but the countries themselves aren't evil</br></br></br></br>   The story begins with Yggdrasil, a popular online game <br><br> however, the protagonist Momonga decides to not log out.

Or did you think I called gate an idiot? Come on, there's gotta be a limit to how dumb you can get.</br>  Which episode does Gate start showing the waifu's?  <br>Overlord, obviously.</br>  <br>I didnt think she was ruined. I know, shocking, right? someone has a different opnion than you!<br><br>Well, Im used to having different opinions on tastes, because tastes are like assholes. Everyone has one and thinks everyone ELSE's stinks but his.<br><br>That's why I never really go to war over "my tastes &gt; your tastes" comments.

Even if people think the character designs were raped in the anime, I still think Gate has the better drawn and animated characters. Meanwhile the B team working on Overlord can't decide on Albedo's proper proportions it threw me off. Also, it highlighted the bad thing about directly copying LN art.</br></br>  <br>All I know is that the MC is a fucking otaku which pretty much removes any credibility it could have had from the show.<br>You can't take it seriously if the MC is constantly surrounded by girls, is an otaku and still supposed to be some kind of soldier.

If you read tvtropes, I would say it was spikified to death.<br><br>Gore is 97% gone<br>Mature characters? 100% gone<br>Violence? 90% gone<br><br>The problem with that is not "hurr durr not enough blood" but that by hiding some scenes completely, they had to cut out large chunks that were actually relevant to the story.<br><br>Have you seen people on youtube and their "live reaction" videos? I honestly enjoy watching those, I think they're hilarious. All my friends are into GATE manga, so I cant expect them to surprised or anything. The youtubers... they all hate reading, so they have fresh reactions, and they are all confused as fuck over a lot of things, because they were never shown or explained in the anime<br><br>Arrow on the dragon's eye? their comment was "did that elf chick shoot out its eye?"<br><br>Rori? "Oh my god she's an apostle of a dark god! she's gonna be the villain of the series! she's just luring them into a false sense of security"<br><br>Its really fun to watch, but also a little sad. The anime is doing a very poor job of telling the story because its skipping too many bits or it in order to hide its most violent parts</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mate, we get to see stuff like Cocytus vs. the lizardman chiefs, I doubt we'll get to there.</br>  <br>No, they'll skip and rush everything up to it because they wasted 3 episodes doing nothing. They're falling behind at a constant pace, so they've obviously taken a big chunk out at some point.</br>  <br>We're basically in the last part of volume 1 now, the only thing left is papa Bones chokeslamming angels and we're done with vol 1, we're getting 3 volumes at this pace.</br>  <br> No, they'll skip and rush everything up to it because they wasted 3 episodes doing nothing <br>That was what volume one was made of, majorly though. The battle at the village was near the end of the volume, and didn't involve much beyond Ainz shit stomping the soldiers and angels.</br></br>  <br>Again, I said it wasn't just a glimpse. It was a whole animated part, the reason they included Cocytus vs the lizardmen was because they needed a cool scene for him to be in, and till then he didn't have any scenes in the LNs. The anime will cover till the end of volume 3, thus it will cover Shalltear vs Ainz.</br>  <br>Hey your call man.<br><br><br>I don't know why you're telling me things I already know. If you really wanted uncensored Gate then you also better want the US getting bitchslapped every which way. You can't have one without the other. Japan did this for your own good and your ungrateful ass is complaining.<br> Mature characters? 100% gone <br>I agree with the other things but this is wrong. Unless you're talking about character design, which I could give fuck all about. 18 year olds looked like 30s in Space Battleship Yamato, didn't stop me from enjoying it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How did he even manage to pump strength as spooky wizard? Can players grind stats after hitting the cap in Yggdrasil?</br>  <br> Mature characters? 100% gone <br>lmao.<br>Sounds like they went in the right direction and saved the anime adaptation.</br></br></br>  <br>He's level 100 while they're like level 20, he can just punch them to death due to level difference.</br>  <br>Hes at the level cap, and even spell casters in YGGDRASIL, at level cap, had substantial strength, which translates even harder when put into the new world.</br>  <br> I disagree. Even if people think the character designs were raped in the anime, I still think Gate has the better drawn and animated characters. <br>That is true, which is why I gave Gate a ++ on animation.<br><br>Its characters ARE better animated, but that is not the same as "better designs".<br><br>The character designs in GATE are just moeblob humans, while the character designs in Overlord are interesting and unique creatures, with a few jokes thrown in that most people didnt notice.<br><br>Aura and Mare being a trap and a reverse trap makes me smirk<br>Demiurge wearing a swagger-full powersuit in a medioeval world<br>Shalltear name is basically "I shall tear you apart" but people don't seem to notice.<br><br>Plus, they are all "evil guys" which you usually don't get to see as the protagonists of anything. It reminds me of playing Dungeon Keeper and thats a big plus on my book<br><br>So I really have to give Overlord the edge on character designs.<br><br>You want to say "oh but they are better ANIMATED in Gate"? I agree, but that's animation, not character designs</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sounds like they went in the right direction and saved the anime adaptation. <br>Would have saved it even more if they animated soldier dialog with more kyaaaaa and naniiiiii comedic reactions. Instead we get happy soldier banter which none of our non-/k/ friends get and call it boring.</br></br>  <br>Because it breaks my suspension of disbelief too hard. And this comes from a fantasy novels author</br>  <br>Man if only character designs were animated well too.<br><br>I brought up Log Horizon by DEEN in another post which proves my point. It doesn't matter to me if the design in the adaptation has been taken artistic liberty with, all it matters to me is that it moves seamlessly.<br><br>One Piece has the best character designs I've seen in anime yet the animation might as well be stickmen in a flipbook. That's just how I roll.<br><br>I also didn't agree with dialog going to Overlord fwiw.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you can't believe that japanese soldiers can't be competent and americans can be villains?<br>widen your worldview fatty</br></br>  <br>That sounds like a bullshit excuse to me anon.</br>  I feel like the two of them are completely different in themes but share a common design with the "Fantasy world" thing.<br><br>But both of them are looking like solid contenders for AOTS so far. I'll enjoy both.</br></br>  <br>3<br><br>I am saying "I like Rori" and also "but my taste is mine and yours is yours, and im not going to argue about my preferences being better than yours or yours being better than mine, because there is no such thing as better when it comes to taste"<br><br>Hell, I enjoy classic music, and still havent gotten over a punk kid going into my hobby shop, buying a manga and asking me with a straight face "aren't you ashamed of listening to fag american music?" while I was playing some Mozart on the audio system.<br><br>He enjoyed rap<br><br>I like Rori. You dont like Rori? ask me if I care<br>But I can say "I like X" and also say "I dont care enough to argue over it" in the same post<br><br>Im not arguing about if X character is better or not, btw, im arguing that, indeed, i dont argue about "my tastes are better".<br><br>You like red soda? i like green soda. Am I gonna argue about which one is superior? no<br><br> Implying green soda isnt so much better <br><br>That was a joke, btw. Im explaining that because you dont seem very fast or very good at reading comprehension.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One Piece has the best character designs I've seen in anime<br>Are you even trying?</br></br>  <br> calling Overlord an SAO clone because there was kinda sort of a MMO setting in the first act and never again <br><br>god I hate this meme</br></br></br>  <br>Are you saying it's not? Top tier aesthetics and character designs, all larger than life<br><br>The villains shtick you praise Overlord for, One Piece already did for 19 years.</br></br></br>  <br> another wall of text <br>hope you proofread it, because no one else will bother slugging through it</br></br>  <br> wall of text <br>Best be trolling.</br></br>  <br>One Piece... really? well, they're at least original, I'll give you that.<br><br>And about moving seamlessly... are you watching the RAWs? because I am, and they move fine. If you are watching it on Funimation, you should know that Funi fucked up the drame rate and Overlord looks like shit through them, and through the groups that ripped their eps from them.<br><br>Check out the episodes you saw. Do they say "Funimation" at the beginning? if so, go and watch the RAWs. They look so much better on that sense.<br><br>But the reason im giving the animation point to gate is because while watching both RAWs, I just think the 3D in overlord doesnot blend seamlessly enough with the traditional style.<br><br>The staff of Ainz Oal Gown bothers me a lot. It clearly stands out of place. The Death Knight blended in nicely, though, so maybe it was on purpose to make its power stand out? if that's the case, it was a decision I would have voted no against.<br><br>But seriously, see if the eps you watched have "funimation" at the beginning. Funi is fucking overlord, big time</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>hey<br><br>you<br><br>stop<br><br><br>it<br><br>every<br><br>word<br><br>doesn't need<br><br>its<br><br>own <br>line</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>All I see is "I have no arguments so now I will fling shit and hope you give up and go away"</br></br></br>  <br>You still watch Pokemon, do you?</br>  <br>Idiot confusing evil alignments with Chaotic Stupid. Evil characters are not suddenly barred from committing acts that aren't genocide.</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>You did say Overlord had interesting and unique creatures which is the point of One Piece character designs. And they're also original as fuck even if you don't like it.<br><br>I do watch both RAW and Funimation. I'd still give animation to Gate.<br><br>Now, what's the reason you give dialog to Overlord as well? I didn't think it was any different to most light novels out there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, apparently we are getting up to volume 4 and those things happen from volume 5 of the light novel and onward.Maybe a 2nd season?<br><br>In b4<br> madhouse <br> 2nd season <br>jokes</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Glad to see you fixed your enter key.</br>  <br>they already did</br>  One is about Papa Bones<br><br>The other isn't</br></br>  <br>Why not both? <br>It's not like your time is valuable anyway.</br></br>  <br> I don't know why you're telling me things I already know. <br><br> On the other hand GATE anime failed as an adaptation. <br> Gate is not manga adaptation. <br><br>Because gate IS an adaptation, and your post made it look like you did not know the LN or the manga already exist.<br><br>Someone else said "Gate failed as an adaptation"<br>You said "Gate is not an adaptation"<br><br>It comes from either the LN or the manga (I would say the LN) but either way, its an adaptation</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> for your own good <br>Im Chilean, I dont give a fuck if USA gets bitchslapped.

Gate is not a manga adaptation. It's a light novel adaptation.<br><br>It was me telling people to stop expecting things out of the manga to be in the anime, it ain't happening.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;They improved Rori <br> Rori has cat ears <br> improved </br></br></br>  <br>Its explained in the LN that he's at level cap and he couldnt keep pumping int or spellcasting any higher, so he raised str with all his unused bonus points. <br><br>So yes, hes incredibly strong</br></br></br>  <br>They'll show a brown elf taking an adventurer clubbing.</br>  <br> you can't believe that japanese soldiers can't be competent and americans can be villains? <br>Oh I believe all of that<br><br>PS: Your shitty grammar fucked your argument. Read it over and over until you spot the problem</br></br></br></br>  <br>All skills get a couple of levels on levelup, so even a pure STR warrior will have somewhat good stack of INT and such. Rest of the power comes from the armor and the weapons that are summons and even take slice of their power from INT.</br>  <br>You clearly don't know what "wall of text" means.</br>  <br>Its all trash, but at least Overlord is mildly enjoyable</br>  <br>You are exaggerating and using hyperbole. Does that mean you ran out of real arguments?</br>   Overlord <br> GATE <br> Monster Musu me <br><br>You can't fool me, Japan<br>Stop trying to give me a monster girl fetish</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> widen your worldview fatty <br>this must have struck a chord</br></br>  <br> Stop trying to give me a monster girl fetish <br>Just accept it anon, the grass is a lot greener on this side</br></br>  <br>Your loss nigga. <br><br>Goddamn I want to fuck an elf.</br></br></br>  <br>Look at that and tell me she isn't asking for it</br>  <br>I also gave the animation to GATE. Did you pay attention? are you arguing because somehow you thought I gave animation to Overlord?<br><br>I gave designs to overlord, and animation to Gate<br><br>I gave dialogue to Overlord because I read both LNs.<br><br>I wonder if they will have "oh look these unidentified commando troops must be american because they're black. Everyone knows only americans have black people" in the Gate anime as it did on the LN and the manga. It would make me piss my pants laughing<br><br>You just cant defend the dialogue of something with a line like that. May as well try ti defend the dialogue in 50 Shades of Grey, Holy Cow!<br><br>Seriously, there's puns and subtle jokes in overlord, which you may have missed, while there's lines so retarded in gate, that thinking about them may lower your IQ by 10 points or so<br><br>I smiled at tje otaku references, but a reference is not wit, its just pandering to the masses and having them go "oh he said waifu lololololol"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rori has cat ears <br><br>Those are ribbons</br></br></br>  <br>I bet you like grass you cowfucker.</br>  <br>Ribbons that simulate catears.</br>    <br>Your loss man, cows are good.</br>  <br>I own both novel series, and like them both.<br>But I have to say Gate is a lot more entertaining in the long run, Overlord kinda lost its steam after the "lol kill all these adventurers aren't I edgy :DDDD" volume 7.<br>Gate kinda lost its steam with the Gaidens, but the last volume (not counting Gaiden +) gives us hope that season 2 will be a good read.<br><br>Anime? I can't say, I think Gate has a better start, but Overlord hasn't even gotten to the good shit yet. I'll decide once the season is over.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, alright. Your grammar just made it impossible to understand that out of your post, though.<br><br>By the way<br>  I said what I meant I said <br>makes no fucking sense either.<br><br>I'm not a grammar nazi, but at some point, you have to draw a line. When your post is impossible to understand, you clearly crossed that line. May as well have written "I climb up down to the same floor" because that doesn't has a lick of sense either</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*shrug*</br>  <br>I don't get why people get so worked up about that line.

There's a time to keep your head in the cloud and a time to wake up.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you mad that you fucked yourself, and yet too ameriretard to spot where it happened?<br><br>Realy, until you point out where it happened, I can't take you seriously anymore because if your words make no sense, how could I possibly take you seriously?</br></br></br>  <br> I gave dialogue to Overlord because I read both LNs. <br>You fucking liar.<br><br> I wonder if they will have "oh look these unidentified commando troops must be american because they're black. Everyone knows only americans have black people" in the Gate anime as it did on the LN and the manga. It would make me piss my pants laughing <br>No, I think it just pissed you off.<br><br>That line makes sense in context since Japan only considered 3 countries to attack them which is Russia, China, and USA. Unless black people are somehow popular now in Russian and Chinese SF (not saying they're not everywhere, just that these countries aren't US level of heterogeneity) it's an acceptable if not racist conclusion.<br> You just cant defend the dialogue of something with a line like that. <br>I can?

Just stop, certain nuances will never get picked up with Bing and GT. Just wait until someone picks it up.<br> Im Chilean <br>So why are you mad over just that one line?<br> retarded analogy <br>If you fucking really read the novels, you'd know Japan expected only Russia and China.<br>They didn't expect the US and immediately stopped fighting when they realized they killed an ally.<br>The line was spur of the moment.<br>It was stupid, but it's not entirely unrealistic since people are racist.<br>How you equated that to 50 shades of unrealistic S&amp;M is beyond me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, unfortunately my collection is all physical. <br>I'm skimming through your file, and yeah, it seems completely out of order. <br><br>But I'm more amazed at how different it is... almost nothing stayed the same, the novel edition is pretty much a complete re-write. Other than the Flame Dragon encounter, everything else is completely different, might as well consider them separate books. <br><br>It's kinda fascinating to see the original, it's almost like reading a draft or storyboard of a manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> reading the web novel version <br> completely different from the published novel version, manga, and light novel <br>No the text copy of the LN is not available anywhere on the internet.</br></br></br>  <br>It worked for the air force with TOP GUN</br>  <br> No the text copy of the LN is not available anywhere on the internet. <br><br>It took me 5 seconds of search to find it. <br>Anon did you even try looking<br><br>http://www.nyaa.se/?%20%20page=sear<wbr>ch&amp;cats=2_13&amp;filter=0&amp;term=%E3%82%B<wbr>2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%20%E8%87%AA%E8%<wbr>A1%9B%E9%9A%8A%E5%BD%BC%E3%81%AE%E5<wbr>%9C%B0%E3%81%AB%E3%81%A6%E3%80%81%E<wbr>6%96%AF%E3%81%8F%E6%88%A6%E3%81%88%<wbr>E3%82%8A</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> machine translations <br>whats wrong with checking for words here and there? its how yiou learn shit.<br><br><br> So why are you mad over just that one line? <br> Mad <br>Ive said multiple times that I am not. I think its hilarious<br><br><br> If you fucking really read the novels, you'd know Japan expected only Russia and China. <br>You just said they expected 3 countries, russia, china and america. This is a text board, I can scroll up and check your post, you cant just take back shit you said and pretend you did not say it. Sorry<br><br>And yes, the racism oozing out of it made me laugh</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oh sorry, "text" you say. Didn't realize you can't read moon at all.  <br>Shit or shit?</br>  <br>nothing like anything seen in the past for the first 3 episodes, nothing similar in it's concepts in the future.. why do faggots that know nothing about anime series exist in /a/</br>  <br>We are, some Japanese politicians are also considering changing the constitution to alter or remove Article 9 and allow Japan to start maintaining a standing army, or at the very least being able to help their allies (Korea, USA, etc.) in case of attack. Honestly I think they need to just throw it out all together, renouncing war may sound all fine and dandy, but once you don't have some big superpower backing you up it just makes you a target, and they're already violating both the letter and spirit of the article by maintaining the JSDF. So really what's the point of keeping it around anymore?</br>  <br>Granted Overlord has many conceptual similarities to SAO, but Gate?<br>Gate is completely nothing like SAO other than sharing the same animation studio doing the adaptation.</br></br>  <br>I want to squeeze those boobs really hard.</br>  <br>heh, yeah, i get that feeling a lot whenever I read a book in spanish and then find the original, too. It must be a lot heavier when you read the gate LN and then the WN. <br><br>My japanese is not good enough yet to read a whole book on it without checking shit with GT, but I get that feeling when reading stuff in french or english after reading it in spanish<br><br>Also, as a former owner of a bookstore/hobby shop, its nice seeing someone has physical copies.<br><br>I used to also have a photocopy machine, and I was just awed when someone came by and asked me for copies of a 300 pages book.<br><br>"Sir, each photocopy its 50 pesos a page. This book is 300 pages"<br>"So?"<br>"So, copying the book would be 15000 pesos. I sell this very book for 8700 pesos, wouldnt you prefer to own the original?"<br>"You are just trying to sell me something, just copy it, alright?"<br>"But its cheaper"<br>"Just copy it, im not gonna fall for it"<br><br>Its as if people was afraid of owning books or something<br><br>Man, I miss reading actual paper books</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>aren't those scans of the novel? we are talking about text files</br>  <br> whats wrong with checking for words here and there? its how yiou learn shit. <br>It's because it's not quality. I ain't reading gibberish. Better to wait for quality translations than pure machine.<br><br> You just said they expected 3 countries, russia, china and america. This is a text board, I can scroll up and check your post, you cant just take back shit you said and pretend you did not say it. Sorry <br>Expected and considered are two different things. They considered the US since Dirrell called them but didn't expect him to actually go through with it. Check it again, I didn't say anything contradictory.<br><br>Also if you really knew that why didn't you raise it up earlier?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its funnier to watch you self destruct<br><br>Is what I wish I would say but honestly I dont remember. I fucking love reading, I cant remember every line of every book ive read 15+ books ago<br><br>Yes, some people enjoy reading.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> lel jokes on you i was trolling <br>Remind me again why you consider SAO-level dialogue is better than Gate's because of one line</br></br>  <br>You clearly lack reading comprehension. Bye</br>  <br>Is it bad that I watch GATE just so that I'd have a proper knowledge about it to be able to shitpost in the threads more effectively?</br>  <br><br>See, this is what happens when you're being an idiot. He'd already said he's mexican, there was no sense in pursuing it further.</br></br>  <br>There are stubborn people everywhere. <br><br>.... *reads 57* ... wait WHAT<br> <br>Tyuule doesn't die, and ends happily ever after with Furuta!?<br>WHY THE FUCK did he change her fate to be so tragic, what the hell!?<br/></br></br> </br></br></br></br>  <br>That depends.<br>One of them is an SAO clone with the shittiest cast I've ever seen and the other one is pretty much a good adaptation that tackles modern political issues and also high fantasy stuff.<br>One is mature while the other one is something only 13-year-olds would enjoy.<br>You know which one is better.</br></br></br></br>  GATE is fun as a completely retarded trainwreck.<br>Overlord is actually pretty good and interesting. Papa bones is a good MC.</br>  watched the first 3 episodes, but I still don´t understand.<br>is he trapped inside a game? or is a human in a different world or what? shit was so boring my mind was just drifting trough the episodes.</br>  <br> tackles modern political issues <br> mature <br>Yeah, like whether to fuck the goth loli, catgirl or elf first thing after blowing up a dragon. Oh, or the dark elf. Shit that's deep.<br><br>It's fun but for fuck sake man get over yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think good is subjective here</br>  <br>He's "trapped" nowhere anon. He's in a skeleton body now in a new world.</br>  <br>The GMs and devs decided to mess with the only guy left over while the game was shutting down.<br>They changed his UI and took direct command of the NPCs he's interacting with to make interaction more convincing.</br></br>  <br>So far he's been pretty good. I like his transition from a normal human being to an actual spooky skeleton in body and mind.</br>  <br>Diplomacy is half the fun, why the hell would you complain about it?</br>  <br> it's harem <br> mc must be thinking of fucking them <br>MC doesn't think like that in the first season at all</br></br></br>  <br> Itami  <br> Ever thinking about fucking them <br><br>You clearly have not read the book have you.<br>The guy will run away from pussy at every chance.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> another beta MC <br>DROPPED at least Papa Bones doesn't run from pussy<br> does he? </br></br></br>  <br>Itami is far from a beta. He just has his priorities straight....kinda.</br>  <br><br>His libido is very low, bearing non-existent, because he's a lich, so he ignores the two girls that want his dick.</br></br>  <br>are you completely fucking braindead? did it not cross your mind even one goddamn time that the post, and the question posed in the post it's a direct fucking reply to might somehow be related?</br>  <br> Granted Overlord has many conceptual similarities to SAO <br>Not really; it pretty much begins and ends with the "protag somehow gets trapped in a fantasy MMO" justification for the events of the show.</br></br>  <br><br>At least Itami has a valid reason, being a recent divorcee, it'd make sense if he wanted to not be engaged in any relationships, doesn't help that a lot of the bitches that want his dick are kinda crazy.</br></br>  <br>He's undead; his sex drive is virtually nonexistent.<br><br>Of course he could probably fix that with spells if he wanted to, but still.</br></br></br>  <br>Crazy? I don't know where you got that from.</br>  Actually haven't watched a single episode of GATE, yet. The manga is great.<br><br>Overlord is an excellent show, though.</br></br>  <br> posting the elf with literal delusions <br>Anon...</br></br>  <br>Finally, an actual primary in the thread.</br>  <br> what is sarcasm  <br><br>although I realize sarcasm is hard to convey through text.</br></br></br>  <br> Manga <br> Pirmary </br></br>  <br>it's primary as far as I'm concerned.</br>  <br>Somebody said that the webnovel doesn't exist anymore, so manga could be considered to be promoted as primary.</br>  <br>Didn't check GATE, Overlord is good so far.<br>Reminds me of both Log Horizon and HeXen.</br></br>  <br>The manga is an adaptation of the novel, not the webnovel.</br>  <br>His character is Lawful Evil, but the player who took over himself is Good-aligned<br>So yeah, he's playing out of his role, but there's no distinction between player and character in his case anymore</br></br>  <br> Lawful Evil <br> Ainz <br><br>kek</br></br></br></br>  <br>man that whole elf arc was so fucking shitty</br>  <br>Albedo has 2 world class items. Shalltear got fucked by one. Do the math.</br>  <br>eh, ending wasn't too bad. But everything else was a drag.</br>  <br>Shalltear, although maybe Albedo would catch on faster if she gets more fighting experience.</br>  <br>yes it was<br> yous gots to shoot the dragons to go un-nuts <br>well, after that it was mostly fine but that crap just dragged on and on and on</br></br></br>  <br>I think un-nuts is my new favorite word today.</br>  <br>Chaotic evil is not "more evil" than lawful evil if that's what you're trying to imply.<br>"Extreme" is too relative a term anyways.<br>To be honest we don't know how far he sways towards lawful or chaotic. I'd say it's still more lawful. <br>What kind of fucking classes are those anyways? Wouldn't "Necromancer" and "Ruler of Death" be the same fucking thing?<br>Fucking japs and their DnD bastardizations.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He is, he establishes guidelines by which nazerick functions.<br><br>a Chaotic Evil character would just randomly be killing people</br></br></br></br>  <br>Your waifu is shit m8</br>  <br>outputbuffer.maxsize = 2;</br>  http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/666<wbr>20<br><br>Anime when?</br></br></wbr>    <br>Ah so that's why they bombed Turkey.<br>Someone they got into a waifuwar.</br></br>  The question is, can anime bring about world peace?  <br> they go around beheading feminists that talk shit and kidnap important people and demand that they lower import taxes on japanese products <br><br>The best.</br></br></br>  <br>Male chauvinism, resident of heaven, warriors of god described to be pussy little girl, i think japan doing good job plus that bastard daesh prophet love little girl</br>  who /honk/ here?

Isn't honaka one of the underrated characters?

Are you addicted to cocaine?</br>  <br>lets just hope @fags dont show up after that LL vs @ thread</br>  <br>Top fucking lel.<br><br>Honoka was fucking shit.</br></br></br>  Nico is the cutest.  <br>I fucking hope so</br>  Anyone here going to the NYC screening on 9/14?  <br>I...I thought honk was pretty good</br>  <br>Better live near Toronto or you're out of luck. Other than Madoka, most anime movies only get shown there.</br>  <br>No, you are the only normalfag here. Please leave.</br>  <br>She was shit. Ruined everyone's fun by being an hyperactive, stubborn brat.</br>  <br> normalfags <br> watching LL <br><br>i don't think so man</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it's on the 12th, but yes.</br>    <br><br><br>Hosers still have to email cineplex aboot it. If you poke around there's an entry for the Nanoha 2nd movie which never came over.</br></br></br>  I do.  honk   <br>There aren't enough Canadian fans to warrant either, probably.</br>  <br><br>There are two. One is Saturday afternoon and the other is on Monday night.</br></br>  <br> TFW I had the balls to go watch both Madoka movies but I won't be able to do this </br>  <br>I can still believe</br>  <br>Madoka I can understand but Canada did get Ano Hana movie.</br>  Didn't like her at first but she slowly grew on me.  <br>Can't say I didn't like her, but she did grow on me. She's so erotic and sexy I can't help it.</br>  Honako A SHIT<br>MAKI BEST GIRL</br>  <br>Do you live under a rock? Normalfags love LL.</br>  <br>This. I'm glad she got those two rape doujin.</br>  <br>Maki is shit. Literally the most boring girl.</br>  <br>Are you fucking kidding?</br>  There are like four semi-dead LL threads up use the catalog goddamn.  I LOVE YOU UMI! LET'S GET MARRIED! WE CAN KEEP HONKERS FROM HONKING TOGETHER! I WANT TO LICK YOUR COLLAR BONES!  <br>I wish he was. LL zerg rushed the international market and now a good 50% of female cosplay at most events are LL.</br>  <br>What is sex with Kotori like?</br>  <br>Hanayo&gt;Umi</br>  <br>best girl</br>  <br><br>Hot dog down an alleyway</br></br>  ITT: Worst Raibus  <br>flat es justicia</br>  <br><br>Jesus Christ. LL is like the prime example and reasoning behind why normals shit on anime. Typical "Oh, its so fucking weird and girly lol why you like watching a bunch of higschool girls dance you pedophile." also misogynistic/sexist/objectifying bullshit etc. I am actually too scared to even ask my half normalfag friend about what he thinks of the show if I were to show him a clip because I know what the response would be. Girls may like it, but any normalfag guy would shit all over it.</br></br>  <br>Kotori is bigger than that. I might just be thinking that because all doujins portray her as cowtitted though.</br>   almost no love for Nico <br><br>best and cutest girl with best personality</br></br>  <br> &gt;almost no love for Nico <br>You know that's not true. She's easily top 5 most popular.</br></br>  <br>Because she's shit and all Nicoshits should kill themselves.</br>  <br><br>I'm probably going to come straight from work to the theater, suit and tie and all, just to fuck with everyone.</br></br>  <br>Make sure you're clean shaven too.</br>  Happy birthday to the koakuma of μ's  HONK  <br>You're just jealous you dipshit</br>  <br>Jealous of what? A giant shit?</br>  <br>I wish man.<br><br><br>You dont know what you are talking about.<br><br><br>Why would anyone care?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You dont know what you are talking about. <br>Let me explain to you why you're retarded: the entire being of Love Live is niche and not normal to normalfags. It's fucking weird. They don't like it. Walk up during airing day and ask for a LL ticket and tell me you couldn't feel the stares.</br></br>  <br>Are you going to a screening? Then you will realize I was right. Its going to be full of normalfags/girls. <br><br>Why would I even lie about this?</br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Of my love to best live</br>  <br> Its going to be full of girls and landwhales <br>FTFY.<br><br>You're not lying, you're just ignorant. Of all anime, you believe LL is the one that's going to be more accepted. Can you imagine a jockfag/club rat or whatever else walking into a screening? Probably not. I can see him walking into a DBZ/Naruto/SnK screening though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How is this any worse?</br>  So /a/ meets up and goes to love live desu?  <br>Well, believe whatever you want. I hope you have the balls to apologize in a thread after you went to a screening.</br>  <br>Why are they posing in a parking garage of all places?</br>  <br>ikr? Its the worst place for a cosplay picture. Especially for an idol cosplay.</br>  <br>Well, admittedly, I was more aloof about the fact that anime had a pretty big stigma, but highschool girls dancing is indeed worse than highschool girls fighting, even if it is in frilly dresses and with magic.<br><br><br>I would but I'm not going to the screening. Too big a pussy. We wouldn't be in the same thread anyway . Different country = different air time and different thread.</br></br></br></br>  <br>None of the Madoka movies went well, why would this?</br>  <br> None of the Madoka movies went well, <br>What do you mean?</br></br>  <br> Kotori's line <br>Unforgivable.</br></br>  <br>Have you seen the pictures?<br><br>Think it was the NY one but they went for dinner sometime before/after the movie. They looked fucking disgusting, especially what looked like some balding guy in his 30s wearing a wifebeater.</br></br></br>  <br>Love Live is very big in Asia because school girl dancing is more acceptable. It is a mainstream anime there.<br>Lower your headphone volume for this one.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OCb<wbr>NGeGnuM4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>How is that not going well? They got along, right? Trashy scum, yes, but what is going well if not getting along?</br>  <br>Some of the people who are going will report back anyway. So whatever. It doesn't even air in my country.</br>  <br>I don't I would ever want to meet anyone from 4chan in real life lmao.</br>  <br>It's okay, no one wants to meet you either.</br>  <br>I realize this. Who is talking about Asia though? We're talking about the west. <br><br><br> Landwhale for Nozomi  <br>Very appropriate.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just fuck off back to /soc/ you cancerous piece of shit.</br>  <br>I DON'T THINK YOU WANT TO BE AROUND A CRAZY UMIFAG!</br>  <br> lmao <br><br>I know its summer and all but this is going too far. Fuck off, newfag.</br></br></br>  <br>The west will follow through soon enough.</br>  <br>Thanks for proving my point. If 4chan users treat others like this. I wouldn't be able to imagine what they're like in real life.</br>  <br>Scared and wimpering? High degree of autism?</br>  <br>They look high and tired as fuck. Especially Rin and Umi.</br>  <br>I would if I could  ;_; </br>  <br>Passive aggressive.</br>  Honoka is ass.  <br>Just stick to your reddit meet-ups.<br><br>Also, lurk more and enjoy your first week on /a/.</br></br></br>  <br> Passive aggressive. <br>passive aggressive in that immensely socially awkward kind of way?

What's it say?</br>  Nico's birthday!  <br>That'll be about tree fiddy</br>    <br>Honoka is a disgrace to idol MCs and it's disgusting to think some people deem her the titular "Red Leader" alongside the other great idol MCs.</br>  Best voices:<br>Eli &gt; Umi &gt; Maki &gt; Honoka &gt; Rin &gt; Hanayo &gt; Nico &gt; Kotori &gt; Nozomi</br>  <br> Haruka <br> great idol MC <br>Good joke.

I don't know if you've sold me yet anon</br>  <br>Rin has the worst voice!</br>  <br>you convinced me anon, certainly a way with words indeed</br>  <br>Works every time. Rin has a nice body at least.</br>  <br>Her cat voice is annoying but whenever she breaks out of it it's sexy as hell. See most Lily White songs.</br>  Little souvenir I got from the Love Live Movie. The front and back look like an international letter. Most of it is just the love lives expressing their gratitude for supporting them.  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-4U<wbr>MNX81fBE</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>im jelous anon-san</br>  <br>Was the movie good?</br>  <br>I thought it was pretty good. Each girl gets a decent amount of screen time. They end up traveling to New York for a bit, my hometown, so I was incredibly excited (still sour about not getting the Keions). I don't want to spoil anything for anyone though.</br>  <br>Which Raibu besides Honoka got a lot of screentime?</br>  <br> I don't want to spoil anything for anyone though. <br>How long have you been here on 4chan? We literally had a thread full of spoilers(two in fact) on release day.</br></br>  <br>It was mostly even if you ask me. Hanayo obviously gets a lot of time to whine or shout out that there's a problem. Nico got a lot of time. Rin, too. Honoka is the only one who had a disproportionate amount of screen time. They know how much people love their favorite characters so they try to give every love live a chance.</br>  <br>I'm just not an asshole. Doesn't mean I'm exactly new. It's also possible that some people have managed to avoid them.</br>  <br> You failed to answer my question. <br>Dude, in the two threads I mentioned practically everyone was *asking* for spoilers. I'll even link to them if you want. And besides, from the way you posted, it appeared you were unaware of the release day threads.</br></br>  <br>I hope Umi got alot of screentime too.</br>  Just got this today. Way bigger than I expected.  <br>No, I haven't been on /a/ since I've been in Japan. I actually saw the movie on release, it's just that I haven't been home until today.<br><br> 4 years </br></br></br>  <br><br>Also, you're on 4chan. People generally don't care about being spoiled here unless they're new or frequent sites like ANN or Reddit.</br></br>  <br>Not him but you can search for spoiler on the internet.</br>  <br> Way bigger than I expected. </br>  <br> Honoka is the only one who had a disproportionate amount of screen time <br>Good thing I'm not going to bother seeing the movie then. Worst girl has already ruined it.</br></br>  <br> Rin Hanayo Honoka and Rin <br>Jeez, all my least favorites too.</br></br>  <br>Honoka is the catalyst of LL's story so no wonder she gets the most screen time.</br>  I wanted to fucking punch Honoka like 90% of the show.    <br>So about that  Akiba Dome,  I hope things turn out like the movie for the 6th Live.</br>  This place needs better bird  Postin' more bird     "Hey anon you should check out Love Live.

This thread is cancer.</br>  <br>Man I wished I have as much dollar as your projection.</br>  <br>This. Rin and Maki have the best singing voices imho. See Beat In Angel.</br>  <br>Those chicks are kinda hot (for 3D that is). Reminds me of something horrible. There was this small convention in a town in my country and there was some cosplay competition and on it's intermission there was a show where a Love Live-themed cosplay group did a few acts. I barfed due to the shittiness of the show. The choreography was totally off, the cosplay didn't match at all and 6/8 of the involved girls were MORBIDLY obese (which didn't really help to make the dancing look more graceful). Didn't they show their performance to someone before the con and the person could have told them that it was SHIT. I understand they were enjoying myself while I'm an angry dude raging on a nerd image board but the show made me angry even though I'm not even an idolfag.<br><br>I hate fat cosplay whores.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm really in love with Honk's solo voice</br>  For a hyper and cat-like girl like Rin to have the most calm voice is really surprising.  <br>You need to see good cosplay then. <br>https://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5HArz<wbr>eDaWQY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Which Rabu Raibu has the best navel?<br>Which Rabu Raibu navel would you lick?<br>Which Rabu Raibu would lick her fellow Rabu Raibus' navels for money?</br></br>  <br> Which Rabu Raibu would lick her fellow Rabu Raibus' navels for money? <br>Kotori would lick Honkers' for free.</br></br>  <br>Honk<br>Honk<br>Honk on Maki's navel and it's all for free.</br></br></br>  <br>Honk is for sexually assaulting.</br>  <br>Really fucking late but I wish @ and LL could be friends.</br>  <br>Maki has the worst voice.</br>  <br>You have the worst ears. Nico and Rice give me aneurysms with their voices sometimes.</br>  <br>Your ears must be broken then. Make literally slurs words horribly and the accent she uses is literally gutterspeak at times. Fucking coreans thinking they can voice act in japan.</br>  <br>She's alright when talking, not always but usually.

The I and N keys aren't next to each other and you just have to tap I twice, no need to move your finger. Maybe if you wrote Rio or something...that's how my typos work.</br>  <br>Pretty sure that's just for effect in that one scene</br>  <br>She was real and she did help them out a lot.</br>  <br>He misspelled it for the same reason I always almost type Miku-nee instead of Megu-nee. Rin is just a more common anime name than Rii so sometimes you just reflexively type what you're used to.</br>  <br>Some people are bad at remembering names, especially for shit tier characters like Rii.<br><br>Keyword is "was"</br></br></br>  Why is Yuuri so shit? she ruined the whole episode.  <br> Miku-nee <br> Rin <br>Vocaloidfags gtfo</br></br></br>  <br><br>Right, fair enough.</br></br>  <br>It's ok, she gets better</br>  <br> I always almost type Miku-nee instead of Megu-nee <br>I can understand typing Miku instead of Miki, but Miku instead of Megu? That's just rude to Megu-nee.</br></br>  <br> These three are cannibals <br> Left is on the menu before the GGs realize what's going on </br></br>   -nee <br><br>Fucking honorific faggots.</br></br>  <br>There hardly a single instance of her being called Sakura sensei in the manga, especially after  she dies  everyone refers to her as Megu-nee. For all intents and purposes, the nee is just part of her name at this point.</br>  <br>What should we call her then? Megu? Megumi? It just doesn't sound right without the -nee.</br>  What would you do if the gakkous sought refuge in your hideout?<br> But one of them is bitten and you don't know who </br>  <br> It's shovel </br>  <br><br> Seeing first episode <br><br>  most generic moeblob shit in years  <br><br> Last 2 minutes of the episode <br><br>Wait what fuck!!!??

I don't see why they would have any reason to hide it. It's not like I'll kill her right away.</br>  <br><br> &gt;But one of them is bitten and you don't know who <br><br>That's why everytime someones enters the hideout we conduct a full body inspection.</br></br></br></br>  I love this series, but the constant generals now that the anime has started are really getting bad.  <br>It was inevitable. And we can't even blame the animefags for this one, we've gone full Kancolle.</br>  <br>You should expect it, since we've already discussed all there is to discuss. There's nothing left to do but waifupost until next episode / chapter.</br>  <br>The next chapter comes a day after the next episode, so there'll be a lot of good discussion then.</br>  <br>MII-KUN BEST GIRL</br>  <br>in what magazine Gakkou Gurashi is sterilized?</br>  <br>I started reading the manga after the first episode, realizing the art and direction isn't very good in the adaption.<br>Looking forward to the next chapter, but what I don't get is how rushed the story is, its my 1 criticism of this series, they just jump between events instead of looking into them more deeply.<br>I just think it would be good if they took the development a bit slower.</br></br></br>  <br> sterilized </br>  <br>They're doing that in the anime already.</br>  <br>Manga Time Kirara Forward.</br>  <br/>  <br>YOU HAVE IMPECCABLE TASTE BROTHER</br>  <br>oh.</br>  <br> sterilized <br>I legit loled.

This shit is pretty damn dark.<br><br>I also agree with OP, Megu-nee is best girl.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Best girl wouldn't bite one of her students.</br>  <br>Well, she  was </br>  <br><br>Best girl wouldn't have kept the bunker secret.</br></br>  Who will survive to the end?  <br>She was waiting for it to be safe to go down there.

Can't stand shit happening to fingernails.</br></br>  <br>Ah! That's true!<br><br><br>THANK YOU!<br><br>I was trying to figure out if the kid was real, but I was positive the kid wasn't, but I couldn't understand why they were treating it as physically being there despite not treating Megu-nee the same.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They acknowledged Megu-nee plenty of times.</br>  <br>in case you want proof</br>  <br>I don't see any short haired Megu-nee?<br>could you provide a pic?</br></br>  Are any males still alive in Gakkou Gurashi?  <br>Because she is the most realistically portrayed.  Like any 2D character, she isn't real. </br>  <br>They're all crazed rapists now.</br>  <br>Yes, crossbow-kun and the biker bros. Pilot-kun was alive for a bit</br>  <br>I don't remember when, but it was at the start where it appears Kurumi is angry when asked to wait for Megu-nee. That basically spelled it out for me.<br><br><br>I thought the screaming scene was the one that gave it away. I didn't realize those things were ears, I thought it was a weird shadow or she was clutching a corpse or something.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Replying to a tripfag. </br>  <br>What actually killed Pilot-kun? He just kind of randomly got infected.</br>  <br>Please go away. You are fucking retarded.</br>  <br>Did someone request the return of Los Gurachos?</br>  <br>I wanna save Yuuri and adopt a loli and live the rest of my life away in a cabin far away with my new family.</br>  <br>He was already infected and relapsed. It's implied that the serum isn't a permanent fix and needs to be re-applied. Kurumi's next.<br>Also </br></br>    <br>Also what happened to Radio-chan. That's why she turned despite there not being any footprints on the roof, meaning she hasn't gone outside in a while.</br>  Soon  <br>Well, Pilot-kun's friends are still alive so there's them as well.</br>  <br>Well I got that it's implied that the serum isn't a permanent fix as per the recent, but did not get that he had been infected already.<br><br><br>There's no question about him being infected. I was just wondering how he got infected. This scene was the foreshadowing of what we later start to discover with Kurumi.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So anyone?<br>What is your excuse?</br></br>  <br> There's no question about him being infected. I was just wondering how he got infected. This scene was the foreshadowing of what we later start to discover with Kurumi. <br>Fucker got bit.

I'm under the assumption that she stopped and is just pretending, which is why everybody thinks she's more mature.    <br>Do you really need that spelled out for you?</br>  <br> nah the delusion completely broke when Yuki killed a zombie </br>  <br>He thinks a helicopter is a plane, so he's probably retarded</br>  <br>It also disappeared when she finally said good-bye to Megu-nee.</br>  <br>How stupid can people be? This entire scene was the closing to Yuki's delusional arc. Notice how she's repeating the same monologue from Chapter 1, but this time she's seeing the rooms how they really are.<br><br>She's no longer delusional and is faking Megu-nee. He delusions started cracking around chapter 16 or so and she may have been faking Megu-nee as early as chapter 20.</br></br></br>  <br>A HEART OF BROKEN GLASS, DEFILED</br>    <br>Poor Yuki.<br><br>Though I honestly want to know how shit got so ruined so quickly.

On multiple occasions when referring to the barricades it's clear that only the third floor is blocked off. I guess in chapter 5 the zombros just got through the barricade somehow.

GG has given me a major zombie itch lately. 28 Days and [Rec] are my favourite modern ones.  <br>Boku no Pico has some amazing zombies.</br>  <br> I heard it got better later with the Governor or something, but I never really bothered. <br><br>I dropped TWD after they butchered the prison arc from the comics, it was like watching a DEEN adaptation.</br></br></br>  <br>Dead Set</br>    <br>That's stupid and goes against the essence of this manga.</br>  <br>You have to know zombie flicks are a niche genre that often doesn't prioritize the writing or setting for good old fashion thrills.

And Megu-nee is already dead, so who is going to kill him?</br>  <br>She's another body for manual labor. She's also not that much of a liability, her subconcious in the form of Megu-nee keeps her in line.

Or maybe she feels she ignored the signs. In any case, before Megu-nee could do anything Yuki had closed her eyes to reality.</br>  <br>This manga doesn't really pull any punches does it? <br>Thanks for explaining</br></br>    <br>It's because Megu-nee fed the delusion and was the one responsible for Yuki becoming delusional in the first place, by proposing to make the school live club.</br>  <br>lewd edit when?</br>  <br>Here, slap this on.</br>  <br> What's it say? </br>  <br> &gt;they had a lot of sex after this </br>  <br><br> Ok then </br></br>  If Shovel is infected/half-dead, why isn't her arm all veiny and scary anymore?<br><br>CHECKMATE ZOMBIES</br></br>  <br>Stop reminding me that Muse used to be good</br>  <br>They'll all die anyway</br>  <br>Because the veins are all dried up Jim, there's no blood running through em.</br>  Do you want to be bullied by Shiodome-senpai?  <br>I was all sweaty from the second-hand embarrassment.</br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/jbjfrvioyc.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  At least with Shirobako Aoi and the others were competent workers.

Livewatch<br><br> Meizhi </br></br>  heh they switched the music of the ed with the op  Little Asaemon  dat glass effect    nobunobu niggas  guitar riff  they doing the arc ED thing again.  Marina Inoue did a great job as Asaemon.<br><br>Namikawa Daisuke as Nobunobu is perfect too</br></br>  <br>Probably not. The only reason they were early last week was because the chapter would be out in Japan on saturday that week. We'll probably first get raws tomorrow.</br>  The animation looks very different from normally this arc, even from the other serious arcs.  <br>Better or worse? I haven't watched it</br>  <br>Can't put my finger on it. It just feels different.</br>  It's out.   [HorribleSubs] Gintama - 281 [720p].mkv <br><br>It's out</br></br>  OP changed to fit the song          So cute      Cool effect                    The end  And next week  Madao!  <br><br>That's because BNP and Sunrise finally split, so they don't have actual Sunrise staff working on this anymore.</br></br>  <br>Man I fucking love the new BGM for nobunobu</br>  <br><br>YES!!!!!! <br><br>It's finally here! <br>The Phoenix WILL ALWAYS rise again!!!<br><br>I really hope they do the chapter proud.

Because I think the different animation is only for this one arc.</br>  Hey anons I'm really early in, just started watching this show recently. It got a couple laughs from me but it feels kinda slow. At what point does it pick up, or am I watching it wrong?<br><br>pic related</br></br>  <br>It depends. Do you like Saint Seiya?</br>  <br>Not that anon but is it weird if I laughed like a madman when I read that chapter not knowing what Saint Seiya is?</br>  <br>Next week is funny.</br>  <br>Not weird. You can still laugh at a lot of the jokes even if you don't get the references, but it does help a lot.</br>  <br>It starts picking up around episode 24 or so. The earlier episodes are mostly character introductions and such and setting up gags which you get punchlines for later on.</br>  <br><br>Why is Kagura so cute.<br> I want to commit a crime. </br></br></br>  <br>keep watching it gets better and better<br><br><br>Scary summer story</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kagura is not for committing criminal acts.</br>  <br>Agreed.<br><br>Tsukuyo is though.</br></br></br>  <br>But she constantly commits criminal acts herself.<br>I want to puke on the police station with her.</br></br>  <br>No. This part is still brilliant even without knowing the reference.</br>  <br><br>Ah, gotcha! Thanks, I'll keep rolling with it.<br><br><br>I get the feeling I'm going to understand you a lot more the deeper I go.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> going on a spree with Kagura vandalizing various buildings <br><br>Count me in, that sounds like fun.</br></br></br>  Weekly reminder  <br>That episode was fucking hilarious. What's wrong with you, anon?</br>  <br>Only the first half. The second half is pretty much just chin jokes and references.</br>  <br>Took me like 30 eps for it to get good.<br><br>But then it got good, and then it got really fucking good. <br>230 or so episodes in right now and loving it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>My nigga. Simply the best part of chapter.</br>  <br> OMAE NO USHIRO NI DA </br>   Someone apparently dies <br> They're not actually dead <br><br>Why does this nearly always happen?</br></br></br>  <br>Just for the record, the anime cut out lots of good parts from both chapters, due to whatever reasons. Manga version of both chapters are glorious, especially the first part.<br><br>Be sure to read the manga later, lovely anime-only pleb~</br></br></br>  <br>Beats me, at least gorilla killed off two recurring characters in the latest two serious arcs in the manga.</br>  <br>I've read the manga. It's still rely too much on references and there isn't any notable good joke that got cut unlike this part in the TLR episode</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12843081615 .<br><br> Interviewer: Why does Gintama sometimes try to make people cry? What do you consider when you draw serious and emotional scenes? <br> Sorachi: That’s probably because I’m drawing and crying at the same time (laugh). Tears are tears, but I don’t want to draw tears that aren’t proactive. The feeling “Ahh, it’s so sad” when people die and it’s all over, it doesn’t feel quite right. Even though a lot of people died in Gintama (laugh). Even if people die, it’s not the end. I don’t want to draw tears that fall and stay at the same place, but droplets that sprinkle along the road to one’s future. <br> Quick Japan 2009 Interview </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's pretty but it's still bullshit.<br>Sometimes characters have to die for the plot to move on.</br></br>  <br>The whole shogun thing dying and then not actually dying and then finally fucking dying pissed me off.</br>  <br>Now that is cool.</br>  Does or Spyair?  <br>Pic related is some funny joke that got cut out.<br><br>In the first part, Beautiful Makidai joke is pretty good too, even without being familiar with the reference. As you may know, originally there are more than one japanese ad tropes being used as satire (instead of just Earthbound), and later all the ad jokes would be beautifully tied up with Beautiful Makidai joke as a core, like they're all strategically placed as build-up for Makidai joke. One would really need appreciate more of that sublime depth of comedic writing by Gorilla. Not to mention, Makidai joke covers about 40% of the chapter. Removing Makidai joke would only make the entire chapter seems bland, incomplete and disjointed, which what Banrise actually did.</br></br></br>  <br>Does for Gintama.<br>Spyair for almost everything else.</br></br>  <br>YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOO</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Donten and Bakuchi Dancer vs. Samurai Heart and Genjo Destruction</br>  I wonder what Seki-kun is doing today...

I don't even know if I want this feminist shitposting to stay, so that they can ridicule themselves or hope that the mod finally deletes this shit.</br></br></br>  Now to wait for megaanon-kun to upload proper scans. In the mean time, here's a shitty rip.  <br>We just need to wait then. Then we either rage and bitch, or not.<br><br>But hoping that Touta will have enough common sense to critically analyze these things.<br><br>Also vampire noble rival? Would love to see that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well the guy is part of UQ Holder, so he probably will appear and be Touta's Fate (with included homolust). <br><br>But like I said, the next meeting with Eva probably won't end up in a good way, but I doubt Touta will end up hating Eva even if it goes wrong. It probably will make him want to know more about Eva and set him on his goal of making Eva truly happy.</br></br></br>  <br>That would be sweet.</br>  <br>Still needs more training..</br>  <br>That version of Touta is scrapped, and we pan to the Touta that she saves from that situation if she follows an identical path.</br>  Prison School  <br><br> implying those snake hairs are not a sign of jungle on her pussy </br></br>  <br> Snake <br> Reptile <br> Hair </br></br></br>  <br>It's a symbolism for a long pubic hair.</br>  <br>Then you see in the futon chapters that she has no hair there. You are completely missing the point of the medusa metaphor.</br>  <br>Her hair is censored, moron. Hana has ultra bush in there. Stop being in denial. If you can't be a hanafag if you don't love her jungle.</br>    <br>The author is a fucking genius.<br>Even his doujins have better plot that what goes around as comercial manga.</br></br>  <br> western webcomics <br><br>They dont understand the concept or attractiveness of the pure girls characters.</br></br></br>  <br>Please remember that I said it first: SHARK JUMP (well actually when Carol was introduced but you get my point)!</br>  Do we really need a thread everyday day?<br>There isn't much to talk about when up to 4 panels gets released and it eventually just devolves into circlejerking<br>It essentially becomes a reddit thread</br></br>  <br>There's a release every day, so someone's obviously going to want to make a thread about it. It's not like there's a consensus agreement for it to be made.</br></blockquote>]
