[ This little fucking shit stain faggot holy shit.  I'm just a quarter of the show in and everything this goddamn prick does is to fuck everything up and either act smug or pretend like its not a big deal by doing jack shit about it.  I watch Chinese Cartoons to ease up and relax after a stressful week of dealing with irrevocable shitheads like him only to find out that the show stars the same kind of irrevocable shitheads.  Please tell me he gets fired or at least becomes less of a piece of shit   Ema is best girl.           He dies  how can you hate the best character  He's actually competent at what he does and he made the biggest cunt of the show into his bro.  I don't really get why people hate him. He doesn't even fuck up that bad, and he's a funny guy. I think he's what I would be like if I was confident enough to talk to people.   Stop talking shit about best boy.    hating based Tarou  The first sign you don't really like this show    Tarou is consistently the source of fantastic humor. One of the best characters in the show.  Even if you hate him though, don't worry, the show will introduce characters with attitudes so much more insufferable that by comparison you'll see Tarou as being almost as likeable and competent as Miyamori is right now. Which is a good thing.     He's an idiot but didn't do anything that warrants hate    I think he's what I would be like if I was confident enough to talk to people.  So you'd be an asshole.     He's not even the worst boy.  Wait until the edgelord shows up in the second half.       I think he's what I would be like if I was confident enough to talk to people.   Anon, if I were your boss, I'd fire on the spot.  If I were your co-worker, I would hate your guts with every fiber of my being.   In a work setting that heavily relies on collaborative work and organization, a person who holds back on reporting a problem (whether it be his/her fault or not) due to an inflated ego or wanting to keep up appearances, is the worst fucking thing ever.          wait for the second half.  he is like beacon on heavy scenes.      He gets more entertaining in S2    He's annoying, but it gets a little better later on. As someone else said, another character that has no redeeming qualities other than having a cat shows up later on.  Your hatred will focus onto that guy eventually.       Choose one   He does become less of a piece of shit.    Funny story. He does n't       Tarou is amazing. You'll realize this later. The first fourth is supposed to make you hate him so that you can later appreciate what a great friend and coworker he is.    collar bones    Right.  I don't even remember her name.    The cool kids strike back.  YAMEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO   And why is the great Neo New Shingo Sawatari not considered a cool kid?    Nice Ruri.    It's an exclusive club, no losers allowed.    NEVER THE PUREST LOVE WILL NEVER STOP    6th for irrelevant decks people want put on the banlist   I'm with that Anon, Sawatari belongs. Serena can't be part of it without her dumb comedy husbando.    He isn't missing or put into solitary confinement.     tfw Crystal Beasts gets pendulum cards and becomes absolutely broken     I just want Releaser to not be banned. I don't know what I'll do if that happens.  Yeah search for other ways but it will be harder now.      Try petitioning next year, maybe you'll get in.    Yuto's Passionate Soul  This is better than it has any right to be.     Purest   Vampire Vamp   And with that pic  secretkek       But Crystal Beasts already have Pendulums      I recruited him though even after he lost like a bitch.    See  And they're still shit  Djinn lock is some bullshit, but I don't really see why it would be banned unless the lock forced a 1-deck format  Also, we've been promised Jack and... No Jack. What the Hell Konami        <br/>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-9N<wbr>BvsmQ2Ik</wbr>  [ ] http://ygorganization.com/ocg-06222<wbr>015-ocg-japan-and-china-decklists/ tfw being on top </wbr>    Would Sawataris papa approve of Serena?   This should of been called Academies theme  http://<span>youtu.be/2ieZ6qQ9818  [ ]     He'd have to.     Nobody is using Berserker soul in raccoons.dek  Brb making Berkser Raccoons     Playing in TCG is like playing OU in Pokemon (unless you are in showderp).   Reiji's chibi doesn't even look chibi.   There's also other Serena expressions that isn't shown in the manzai, but appears in the website's "Duel School" flash app.     dat flustered Serena      flustered Serena  My heart and dick are in unison.     I like the second's second panel how is he like "Oh crap what I have to say now?"  If she get this cute I may start to like her. I am really into these moe cute faces with tsundere traits, that's something Yuzu sadly didn't achieve for me.       Actual Berserker Soul is nothing compared to its anime counterpart. If it was I would've already made Superheavy Berserker Samurais   When will they just fucking go on a date?   When they reunite.    Don't worry, she still likes you.  It's not like Nekroz really need it, more if you consider that Book of Eclipse is basically a big fuck you to Rituals with Releaser in general, unless they control something like Forbidden Lance. And to be honest, after the big bullshit it was the Agent deck (in my opinion, the most annoying lock deck), I feel Djinn-lock are not that hard to deal with it. I can see Book of Eclipse getting hitted at some point though. And Jack will return in Dimension of Chaos, unless you refer to anime. If that's the case.  KONAMIIIIIIIIII          When will they just fuck?  Now that's more like it. And hopefully we can get an exclusive OVA with that. Itadaki! Seieki animation.     Tfw no masochistic tomato     Only 500 dmg per draw   Implying you couldn't STEADFASTU DRAW with Susano'o  That's 7000 damage, isn't it? I mean, what could make the combo stronger?     did Zexal have this much QUALITY moments?    Yuzu sadly didn't achieve for me.   That's nothing to be said about, Yuzu's a horrible character and has been sense day one, she's just another Kotori. No matter what the Yuzufags will tell you.     So if the one who drew pic-related is one of the artists who occasionally draws for ARC-V, especially the DVD covers, this is Serena's full attire in the ED, isn't it?   This last episode was filled with QUALITY.    And Yuya looked more like a girl than usual, I guess the koreans got confused on his gender.    How about FUCK YOU    I'm not sure but I feel like it would still be more fun with the anime effect and just be able to attack indefinitely with a superheavy samurai.    It's a very nice outfit.    Come at me, Yuzufag, I'll wake that head of yours posthaste.    Oh yes, the girl deeply connected to the plot and is a major character and comptent duelist is a useless cunt that cries out the protagonist name while getting in the way and contributing nothing whatsoever to the plot.    Double teaming me now? You yuzufags are into some kinky shit.    Or, wait. The card only allows it's usage when you do 1500 or less damage. Which means it's basically useless in Superheavy sams and shit in Raccoon's.    He's just shitposting, anon, I can't believe you took the bait.    Yo, I don't think she is horrible, just it doesn't suit for me, the only ones who maded this far were Masumi and (to some extent) Mieru. She is cool, funny and likeable but not my favourite, that's all.  Calm down, anon.       the koreans  was this episode actually made by koreans or are you just rusing me     Korean animation studio.    I mean let's make a venn diagram in our heads.  Overlap: Female. No cowtits. Love Interest for the lead.   Kotori: Yuma.wav. Fanservice. Barely ever duels. Yuma don't give a fuck, totally devoted to Yuma anyway.   Yuzu: Appears without Yuya in frame ever, Duels fairly often and has an improvement arc. Crude and strong. Could probably be convinced Yuya is a bad, given enough evidence.   Nah. Points for b8 tho        Post any waifu or cardfu you want to be yours. Pic related, except that I don't have photoshop and used something I found in my folder.  Just imagine that Ladydevimon is Vampire Vamp and it will be enough    It's not like I'm into a crude, strong girl!     Could probably be convinced Yuya is a bad, given enough evidence.  Now lets not go that far.      strong.   I'll give you that, No normal girl could break a piece of high tech in a punch. But that's it. She hasn't had a duel for 17 episodes and she did nothing but lose after her "I got gud" duel against the fodder who lost easily to captain falcon.      It's been foreshadowed.  First she doubted that Yuto was a different person, even though he was worlds more violent than Yuya (in her eyes at the time), then Gon outright saying "You didn't believe in Yuya?!"   misunderstandings       your waifu/cardfu is shit, Selena best girl, selena a cute    She's the series Jounouchi. She gets Yuya's sloppy jobbers to prove she's gotten better at the game. And really the only characters consistently dueling onscreen at the moment are Yuya, Shun, and maybe Dennis.    Oh it's going to happen especially when he EGAO and noms Yugo.     a Digimon with a pregnancy test  It may look like a hot chick but it isn't a real woman. Digimon have no define sex Anon...    Why is Serena such a miracle of the universe and dimensions?    Yuzu slap.gif  wait what the fuck? that wasn't in the latest episode or its trailer for the next one.    Guess the father.   Yuya?    I just realized that they're dressed like Johan  Am I retarted      Jonouchi was not a bad duelist at all, he should have beaten Marik and won plenty of important duels. Technically he became the King of Games after Battle City, he had to beat Yugi to get back his Red Eyes. It might not have been shown, but he did get his Red Eyes back.    Yuri.    Oh don't start that bullshit here, anon. "Digimon has no sex" it's an annoying delusion from moralfags and nostalgiafags who don't want any other Digimon that are human or something like that.    Sorry Rin.   A little bit Anon. A lot of the cards are based on the characters. The Legendary Gambler is a young Solomon Moto.        I never said he was a bad duelist. I did pretty much say he takes Yugi's seconds, and that's not incorrect. It's basically what his entire battle city career is.    Digimon not having genders is straight up said in the shows. Fap to them all you want, I do, but they still don't have genders, they're just data.   With that said, this fucking Greymon is like a blackhole of always hungry in Re:Digitize.      it's an edit, I don't see how Yugo could make her mad enough to bring out the fan.    Shit card Shit fu     Serena.       it's an edit  No its not, watch the preview for the next episode at the end of the current one     I wouldn't call Yuzu the Jonouchi though, I'd call Gon that if anybody, while Sawatari is the Manjourne. Yuzu is more like the Asuka.    What about her younger form?   At the next banlist, an errata is announced.   Cyber Dragon Nova   This card must first be Xyz Summoned with the above materials.    y/n         he should have beaten Marik  Dude that's nothing to be proud of at all, he would have even lost to Mai if it wasn't for the random chuuni chant needed for Ra Did Marik even get a single legit win?      REVOLUUUUTIOOOOON    You can't tell me what to do.    That's a boy.       This is poor bait     Yugo: So have you guys kissed yet?   Yuzu: Wha-?!       That's a boy.   Implying Yuya would give a fuck if Yuzu had a fat delicious cock       Falling for bait.     Yuzu   Asuka  That's literally saying she's irrelevant to the series anon.  Yuzu seems like the Jounouchi due to how ARC-V emphasizes her importance second to Yuya. Gon barely isn't even important to the overarching plot.  If she isn't, then she's pretty much a whole new class of character herself.             I believe Yami Marik beat Yami Bakura/Marik legit, otherwise no, he didn't win a single duel without Shadow Realm and Chuuni Chant shenanigans.    Since Yuya, Yuzu, and Gon are seemingly meant to be the power trio, I'm pretty sure they're going for something completely new.    It wasn't the coreans this time, by taking 3 seconds to check the credits. It was Studio Blanc, and their episodes being full of QUALITY is nothing new. They're awful, I hope they eventually get dropped for a studio that can at least do a passable job.    nigga i don't read nip.    I doubt it was that, after all, she's not got that red blush.     Since Yuya, Yuzu, and Gon are seemingly meant to be the power trio  The concept of a power trio is as irrelevant here as it was in GX and early 5Ds    Shun do not click this image.   Still, Yuya/Yuzu/Gon is as close as you can get since they get portrayed as such in things like the second OP and the cover for Hanate.    Too late.    Is that the touMAN I see?    Poor Gon sure doesn't get to act like a member of the power trio though.     Still, Yuya/Yuzu/Gon is as close as you can get since they get portrayed as such in things like the second OP and the cover for Hanate.  Reiji would fit better than Gon if you want to force it     Everyone has a power trio this time around.    Main Characters  Yuya, Yuzu, Gon  Cool Kids  Reiji, Serena, Shun  Crazy Fusions  Shun, Yuri, Leo  etc. you get the point, only one that isn't part of a trio is Sawatari and he's too Neo New for that shit.             Not yet at least, but he and Yuzu still get most of the non-protagonist duels (even if Yuzu hasn't dueled for awhile), along with Shun.    Bakura, apparently. I'm looking at the Duel Script now and there's no shenanigans but.   Bakura plays Exchange   Takes Ra   Marik takes Monster Reborn   Bakura had a useless normal monster and a Spirit Message in his hand  I dunno if we can call this legit, because Bakura apparently suffered a brain aneurysm when he activated Exchange.            Hurp, meant to reply to     I'm catching up on Zexal in between episodes of Arc-V, and the production values are surprisingly strong. The soundtrack too. Really, if there was less 'Yuma being an idiot' stuff eating entire episodes whole, and great (female) secondary characters getting constantly shafted, Zexal would have been a very solid series.     Studio Blanc  I don't see any of that though. All I see are a bunch of names, Studio Wanpack, and Ace Company Studio Mark.      Sawatari, New Sawatari, and Neo New Sawatari are their own power trio      Not yet at least, but he and Yuzu still get most of the non-protagonist duels  Gon has dueled more than Yuzu       Bakura was a shit duelist. he only ever got one legit win that wasn't a straight up lose or no result and that was against that Bonz character.    And Bonz lost against Joey's normal monster with like 800 attack    Shun has dueled more than her too. Serena is right there with her too.     Shun under Crazy Fusions   Shun is not a member of Academia.  Yet.       Of course.  Meant Sora, guess I have the burning passion of revolution on my mind thanks to Sound Duel 3.      Never said they dueled the same amount.    I don't blame you, those Yuto and Shun themes were great.    To be honest, Yuzu doesn't look like she's meant for dueling anyway. It looks like she's meant to be someone who goes looking for plot action.  Although this time around, her role is to see things on the other side of the story, at least on Yugo's side.      I really miss Yuto, he was too young and too pure.     Yuzu doesn't look like she's meant for dueling anyway.  She spouts about how she's an entertainment duelist all the time when she duels. She's going to duel plenty more, just give it time.     Where does one find sound duels? I've been trying to track down the 5ds ones for a while now, and can't seem to find a decent site with them.  Also, I can't believe I somehow missed that Arc-v's 2nd AND 3rd osts were released.     He'll be back one day, be patient.    Someone had a mega of it yesterday or the day before. I don't have it anymore, but I'm sure someone here does.    What or who could possibly crack the crude exterior for Serena to act like that?    I-i will    Yours truly.         tfw I actually spend 20 minutes to do this   tfw I really have free time right now  I admit I had a lot of fun doing this, and also admit I never expected to be more or less good in photoshop.         His straw is broken    I need Yuzus. Post more Yuzus.   Lewd is preferred.     No lewd.    Sometimes you just get mad you aren't invited to the table to spend time with a Ruri.   No.       I need Yuzus  What for?     Ruris are only for cute.    Sorry, I only have a bunch of cute Serenas to share with.     Shun dressed up like J Jonah Jameson   I need pictures, PICTURES OF RURIS        Jesus, he really looks like Sonic there.    I didn't even notice he did honestly, but I'm glad you pointed it out, got a laugh out of me.    Obviously    You haven't seen things yet.    Shun looks uncomfortable.     Rins hair reminds me of amy     Found it in the archives, thanks for the tip.     Yuya is Knuckles   Yugo is Sonic   Yuto is Shadow  You're bending my head like a pretzel, Arc-V        Sonic   Sora   Manjourne   Whoever the fuck Yuri looks like   No prob.        Ayye, did I miss something or did Sawatari get his duel disk back while Yuya didn't? I also saw the blocks of the action spell Crossover.   And Yuri is Amy.   Also I love Serena, but I can't be the only one that dislikes how they draw her blue strands do I? They look more like a head band than her hair.     I feel triggered but I don't know why    Yuto is Manjoume      Sometimes you just get mad you aren't invited to the table to spend time with a Ruri.   It's the flashbacks.        How is a landlord related to circus animals?     that filename     Getting kinda cthuluy, Yuya.    Why is Yuto such a brute?    My skin stated crawling when I noticed those baby crabs.     Yuto's shitty little money pile.  What's wrong, Yuto, couldn't pick the  SILENTO BOOTS?     <br/>   Its symbolism about how the harder Yuya tries to incorporate egao into his life the more he corrupts and misunderstands it       see your art posted like a year later  Feels good.        This game is hard   I don't understand it   Where are the dragons       You should make more.    I really like the touches on the monopoly one.  Shun clearly taking them to school and Yuzu is getting butthurt   Yuto has already been cleaned out, has no money or properties left.    Name has Kaiba in it and 'Go to Shadow Realm' space.         tfw only buildings level up   tfw character creation screen is shit   tfw 2d6       We need more pictures Anon.   who infernoid here? vanitys sadlife     &gt;Serena dies the same way, passing her Moonlight Cat Dancer to Yuzu.     I PUT TWO HOTELS ON MY RAILROAD    Holy shit, I think I dimly remember you posting them the first time  What the fuck have I done with my last year       Give it to them...to everyone's future...with your power...   Tits.   And then Yuzu punches her.       Dunno what you are talking about, vanity btfo by galaxy cyclone or Dekatron.    I draw for you guys all the time. Pic related was me.

I'll probably try out IgKnights too, they look cool.        More monopoly then or other children's games then, like the game of Life.     Rua is /toy/   Ruka is /an/   Crow is /ck/       I want to draw the Yus playing Sorry now fuck      GX Yugi is /fit/      Sawatari is /fa/.     Not maining dank-o-tron     Good, do it.    Yugi gets swoll and stops being a manlet   /fit/ would be proud.        I'll post it tomorrow night, I need to sleep stat.   Now I just want tons of kids playing board games   Sora playing Candyland and everybody having to stop him from licking the board.   Gongenzaka trying to play jenga with his giant hands.   Yuya playing twister and his coat gets in everybody else's face.        Good I'll be waiting since I'm sure Re:Digitize will piss me off with how much meat these fuckers consume.    God help Yuzu if Ruri's a cow.     Shun and Yuto playing Chess   Shun flips the board screaming REVOLUTION   Yugo playing Checkers with Yuzu   Yugo does a Synchro Checkers Chuuni Chant when he combines two pieces into a King        Ruri is pretty much guaranteed to be flat.     SPREAD THOSE WONDROUS, GLOWING CIRCLES AND TRANSPORT ME TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BOARD AT LIGHT SPEED!   Jump, jump, jump.        Shun is definitely /m/.     OH RED CIRCLE SHINING BRIGHT ON THIS CHECKERED FIELD, BRING FORTH A KING OF ABSOLUTE POWER   CHEKKA SHOKAN   Yugo is still on his bike the entire time        Serena is playing chess with Roger   Yuya and Yuzu come by and ask "Hey guys, whatcha doing?"   Roger grabs two more pieces and drops them on his side of the board.      I wonder if Yugi and Kaiba will get chants for Dark Magician and Blue Eyes White Dragon. wait, do they do chants for advance summon?    wait, do they do chants for advance summon?  Im pretty sure Strong did one for Barbarian King      Shun is playing Connect Four with Yuto   They're both trying to overlay the pieces   They don't, but they're gonna get Synchro and Xyz cards, especially considering Dark Magician has an Xyz and Blue Eyes a Synchro. Hell they might even give them Pendulum, it'd make getting Kaiba's Blue Eyes a lot easier.       Yuzu did one for Mozart too.     They don't, but they're gonna get Synchro and Xyz cards, especially considering Dark Magician has an Xyz and Blue Eyes a Synchro. Hell they might even give them Pendulum, it'd make getting Kaiba's Blue Eyes a lot easier.   Silent Swordsman and Silent Magician synchro retrains when? I love those two monsters and I don't want them forgotten about there's just something special about the partnership of a physical and magical attacker working together to overwhelm their foes.      Well they gave Horus one so maybe we could get some LV retrains in later packs for sake of nostalgia.    Probably never honestly, I'd imagine some of the other cards getting Synchros instead.    playing Love Live   see a cute card girl   Name: Shun Kurosaki   mfw        Metaphys Horus is a Synchro   Metaphys Armed Dragon is a crappy normal monster  gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay      Shun a cute.    Wasn't there some spoiler fag wayyy back months ago saying something about retrained LV monsters? I mean they called the master of pendulum structure deck as well as the 3 Odd eyes extra deck monsters. But I absolutely refuse to believe we are getting a Miracle fusion card that works for every fusion monster. Can you imagine how bullshit that would be?     anime Breaker is 1500   card Breaker is 1600  Konami are laughing their ass off.      What the hell are you talking about? It's 1600.    In the anime, Breaker had its ATK lowered by 100 by some spell card of Haga's. It was 1600.      I really gotta clean up my Arc-V folders...and you aren't helping dammit.

Proceed to her faint from embarrassment and then get kidnapped when Academia attacks.   Got a new computer, looking to download Ygopro again. But I can't remember where I got it last time. Whereabouts can I find that Percy one? That worked much better than Devpro.    Not sure why would you want Percy instead of Devpro when there are much better players in the latter.    Are you talking about the percival one for android? If so, it should be on google play or percival18's blog somewhere.   Otherwise ygopro's site should have everything.       using Devpro to play other people   ever       playing Yugioh at all  Come to the other side folks.     Why are magicfags so insecure?    Cause nobody wants to play vintage with me  ;_;    I'm leaving this here as a reminder. http://exhentai.org/g/813747/4f79ac<wbr>1776/</wbr>    Aww, that panda looks sad. I'd give him a hug.

Then he got killed by St. George.    Where the fuck did Yuya pull all of those new Pendulum magic cards out of. His ass? Well, this is a prison arc after all.   Maybe he'll start channeling the power of Yuto instead of the power of EGAO.  Well considering he pulled them out of thing air in the first place, probably, or Reiji made them.     YAMEROOOOO  Now that's alpha.   HANASE      UAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH        YAMERO JA NAI  YUGO DA      Shun finally gets to talk next episode. I wonder what he's gonna say after that.    RR  Ruri Revolution~      Ruri Falcon when? Yuya can't just hog all the waifucards.    When we find out that Ruri is actually his pet falcon that he got because his real little sister died long long ago.   http://<span>youtu.be/Xbfekqs-7Kk  [ ]   DUSTY ROBE      For every waifu card someone else gets, Yuya will get two more waifu cards. Eventually he'll be able to go an entire duel only summoning Yuzus.   Odd-Eyes counts as a Yuzu.      Why does it feel so good to beat Odd Eyes Magician with pure Performapal   Because you are bad at games    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=v1x<wbr>FDbtqBmE</wbr>  [ ]     Hey Selena, how many did you get to beat?      Yuzu eats Serena    gets a green eye   eventually eats Ruri to get a pink eye   She is now Odd-Eyes    Serena ends up with a better record   it dejects Shun as a man            Serena ends up with a better record   There is only one way to settle it then.      You wouldn't hit a Ruri would you Shun?    He's not trying to hit her, Selena is just being difficult.    Difficult girls are best girls.    I wish they could surprise everyone and have him deck her or reject her outright, for whatever justifiable reason. The woes would fly with "Oh, he doesn't love Ruri anymore," when in fact it would just prove he's well aware that she certainly isn't Ruri at all.  The sooner that complacent stereotype is kill, the better.      To be fair he doesn't really seem to pay her any attention or give two shits about her. I don't even remember if he's even commented on her looking like Ruri, maybe once briefly?   Most of the stuff is just headcanon pairings and stuff with them, they seem rather indifferent to each other, they're just similar brutes, and only opposites attract.      Why on earth would he hit the person who saved his life?    At this point he probably figured out the AU counterparts thing. If anything I'm worried he'll run into the actual Ruri and go goddamnit another clone     The only fuel to the flames so far is that he looks at her/Yuzu obscurely, which everybody translates as "He's thinking of the Ruri." when in fact he's just wondering if he could ask one of them to sew the torn bits on the bottom of his coat back together.     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tdk<wbr>hQi_iEO4</wbr>  [ ]     I'm surprised nobody comments on their clothes or hair or anything. They only ever comment on their faces looking the same. I get that maybe they're supposed to look the exact same completely and they just look different for the sake of the viewer, but even then the clothes should give it away most of the time or their general height, size of the tits, eye color, or something.     To be fair he doesn't really seem to pay her any attention or give two shits about her.   He gave enough shits about her to fight for her despite his serious injuries. And tell her the truth about his dimension when prompted to by her despite refusing to do so earlier to Reiji. Not to mention he stayed with the Lancers because she asked him to.     Yusei fight for future, earth got xyz Yuma defend earth from d1k and whatever that thing in alternate retcon universe, we earth got pendulum. I don't buy Yugioh reprint after R now look what our publisher throw at us.      I'm guessing crazy hair colors and hair style in Yugioh are just as common as blonde or brown hair here.  So they might assume that they just dyed their hair (which also seems to be more common in YGO. I think it was confirmed that Yugi actually dyes his hair?).  I mean if you ran into your best friend you knew since childhood and he simply had blonde hair would you not recognize him? We just have to raise our suspension of disbelief to anime logic.  And they actually do recognize the clothes. Yuzu thought Yuto was Yuya changing into a costume and Serena and Yuzu swapped clothes to make Obelisk go after Yuzu          Insult me, fair enough. Insult my Mother, shame on you. Insult my cards, you're a dead man. Insult my comrades, hell hath no fury. Insult my Sister, WHITE WHALE, HOLY GRAIL        Well the hair dye makes since to a degree, but not for You Show to believe Serena was Yuzu, she wouldn't have had time to just go dye her hair during a Battle Royale.   Also as far as Yugi I don't think so. His grandpa's when he was younger was dark gray/blackish and gold.      Sawatari's papa was carded by Shun and nobody noticed    Why is she still in her Academia uniform in these?    Sawatari probably really doesn't care to be honest, he's too busy trying to impress the strong willed girl and save the universe.   How would you guys fill if Neo New Sawatari started using NEOS.      Translation?     New Sawatari started using NEOS.  It's a trash card that fits him perfectly     he gets a reprint thats worth using. Neo Neos Sawatari    Whoa, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. We do not talk about the new WAITO like this.     Neapolitan Summons   Strawberry: Fusion   Chocolate: Xyz   Vanilla: Synchro   Sawatari is gonna be great as this goes on, he'll stop sucking eventually. I mean he's not completely useless, he has helped quite a bit surprisingly.        Was Reiji trying to give Shun a Yosenju card? or Funky Comedian? or his own personal RaidRaptor Pendulum?   It was a ruri imouto card and he got upset about it.    It was Risebell. He didn't take it well.    It was this card.   Meanwhile in Academia, Yuri and Sora are being irrelevant doing irrelevant things for another 10-30 episodes because MUH SYNCHRO DIMENSION.    Reiji tried to give him Ruri Pendulum.   Shun gets annoyed and leaves, saying he doesn't need Pendulums.   Reiji tries to recruit Yugo by making a Rin Pendulum   Yugo goes full MISUNDERSTANDINGS and thinks that Reiji carded Rin because fuck logic.   We get Yuya vs Yugo   I'm just talking out of my ass right now just because.   But seriously, how much of a dick move would it be if Yuri learns how to Pendulum Summon after being told by Leo/Sora/Dennis... and the first Pendulums that Yuri gets is a Ruri Pendulum and a Rin Pendulum, setting both in the scales. It would NEVER happen for obvious reasons but it would troll the shit out of Shun or Yugo if Yuri dueled one of them.             Or Fusion Dimension is taking this time to prepare to invade Standard.    I can definitely see it happening but it's going to have a drawback.     Why the fuck is it only one card? You need 2 pendulum cards to pendulum summon, even I know that. Fuck you Akaba Reiji      I think Yuri has other ways to get under someone's skin      Yeah, but    http://strawpoll.me/4724660/  so my physical CD of Sound Duel 3 just came in  open it for the sake of 320ks or return it?  what to do, what to do        Play the sound of rebellion as you drive around town laying the smack down on unsuspecting duelists.

Burger King have posted this on their twitter   Did Anno sell out again?

Burger King makes an EVA reference    it's the fucking Ecuador division that does it    This is a crazy word we live in.     No thread? Fixed! the cover of the second BD is out. I thought it gonna sell around 10k but now i think it's going to be 12k thanks to Dick Suck   http://kekkaisensen.com/products/bd<wbr>02.html</wbr>       Thank you Dick Suck.    paying money for childish, poor quality anime    I'm sure some people do.  But how does this relate to Kekkai Sensen?      Kekkai Sensen = tired, cliched, monster/event-of-the-week bullshit Code Geass wannabe tripe     Hibikifag    Go watch your show that's filled with blurry filtershit.       this guy is this mad that KyoAni, the most technically skilled anime studio, is beautifully (as always) animating a different genre of anime than he prefers      monster/event-of-the-week   Yeah you can fuck off with that statement because the series has been far from that. It's more of a sol than what you mentioned. As for cliche what show this day and age doesn't have cliches, so stop being ignorant.    Code Geass   Yeah now you're going full retard.          typesiting....     KyoAni keeps on animating the same moeshit filled with blurry filter crap.   Come back to me when KyoAni actually does something new for once.       because the series has been far from that.  It really hasn't. Instead of monster of the week you have random event of the week that forces other characters to save the pussy-ass MC.  Yeah now you're going full retard.  What? Both MC's have eyepowers, but only in Code Geass does it actually contribute positively to the story instead of being arbitrarily shoehorned in.        using "moeshit" unironically <br/>    Yeah, I can't believe people actually watch Hibike.     pussy-ass MC.   Yeah your full of shit anon, the MC is far from that unless you expect him to be some Gary Stu OP character. Also you fail to see that Leo actually helps the crew out in various ways but your to stupid to realize that.  Also Kekkai Sensen and Code Geass are 2 completely different things. The later has a MC that's edgy and on a journey for revenge while the former is a MC that is following the daily lives of Libra. So yeah your stupid.         moeshit  i want crossboader to leave    its generic shonen shit         your to stupid to realize that.  I'm actually smart enough to realize that you just said "your to stupid" on purpose.    Kekkai Shitsen truly has the worst fanbase of the season.   Dick Suck?       almost every kekkai thread I've been never argued among themselves over petty shit  How so?    It's pretty sad to see some moeshit eaters shitposting Kekkai Sensen.  Why can't we have a peaceful thread without you fuckers ruining everything.      everyone who doesn't like what I like must be a moefag/shonenfag/deepfag/etc.  This is the most cancerous meme on /a/.        Hey mom, check it out I'm making a trololol war   Who are you even b8ing?         Yahari, UBW, and Hibiki not considered the worse fanbases.   I mean Kekkai Sensen are the most peaceful and comfy threads while those 3 are filled with shitposting.       meme   Fuck off cancer.      Yet you omitted the Jojo fanbase while having the cheek to post an image from said series.    Gotta b8 them all. It's the same degenerate trying to shitpost a semi-empty thread    Let's review some posts, shall we?  - an opinion  - a joke  - an opinion  - an assumption (when you assume you make an ass out of u and me) that someone is a fan of a show they use a reaction from, thus, a shitpost  - an opinion  - "fuck off" - a personal attack, thus, a shitpost  - using "moeshit" unironically, thus, a shitpost  - An opinion  - "your full of shit" "your to stupid" intentionally misspelled personal attacks, thus, a shitpost  - a shitpost, but likely intentionally ironic, as noted by   - a shitpost  - "moeshit eaters" a shitpost  Who's doing the majority of the shitposting, anon?                   Worst fanbase/threads on /a/ at the moment 1. Jojo 2. Yahari 3. Hibike 4. Stalker/Sales 5. Naruto 6. Fate            putting Fate last  Okay anon. You're full of some serious shit.     what is this? odd sentence in op    probably will get Starphase or Brody &amp; Hummer covers before either a sexy Chain or K.K one   Leo cover will be the last one    Salesfaggotry is the worst, but I won't pretend I'm not happy about this.    Code Geass wannabe   No show wants to be Code Geass.        The fact that it's even on the list is already shit. As bad as Fate threads are, they're just autistic whereas Hibike is autistic and retarded and Jojo is pretty much /v/ at this point.    That's the way the manga was, so it's likely.  Also Chain and KK inner cover &gt; Starphase and Chain &gt; Starphase and KK. It'll be some combination of those but I'm hoping for the first.     Moeshitters sure are mad because Kekkai is selling three times more than their generic highschool drama show  tfw buying the manga is going to cost at least $70 burgers  I just want to know what fucking happens in between since the story is fucking everywhere     image.jpeg ruining the thread with show wars and forced moe vs shonen bullshit  Okay.  Anyway, I missed episode 1 yesterday because I was busy editing those pages. Is there still no one who can set up anything? I don't think there will be much participation without a strong direction. I wonder if there would even be enough people since I always got the impression these threads were a small handful of vocal posters and the rest just popped in on occasion.      W-wait what's going on here  I thought she was living comfy in the countryside      Who says she isn't?  Mr. Coffin-Spider just dropped in to tell her the good news about Azathoth.     These guys needed to get some more screen time.   Volume 10 spoilers. You can read chapter 4 here  and chapter 5 here  First 3 chapters are gone because DH found out about them unfortunately, but I might repost them at some point if there's interest.       Oh sweet thanks, Yeah been trying to get a hold of the manga. $80 is pretty steep for 7 volumes   This show isn't 1/10th as good as Trigun and Trigun wasn't even good.     So  White  is dead?    Resurrected Andy Warhol would probably have a rich career in Hellsalem.   I might repost them at some point if there's interest.   A repost once you've finished them would be greatly appreciated, thanks.       These cogs look neat but what do they do?  She's not in the manga. We saw events from episode 12 at the beginning of episode 1 though, and she was there. There's been speculation that it's her ghost considering the thing Black said about halloween, but at least she'll get to make amends.       Ah well that's surprising I was hoping that her character would be a bit more fleshed out in the manga but I guess not also yes definitely with this anon   Please do repost when you finish, Thanks!     Why did .. White paint... Suddenly appear on that photo at the start   I read some comments for the episode and many seem to have thought it was "that" too     This whole scene was perfect. Wish the kings besides Despair could have had more focus but then again, maybe it's better to wait for the material to get to it.   I doubt I'll consider it finished until full raws come out and I can be more confident in the text (chapter 5 especially had a lot of departures from the chinese translation that worried me), but for now if I just go back and change some lines, add some sfx, and clean up some of the dust like I did with the last few chapters I can probably repost them. Maybe tomorrow although I'm wary of setting a date for myself considering how that turned out with the last chapters. Within the next few days if not tomorrow then. Keep an eye on the threads, assuming someone makes them.      Is this the guy from Chain Possible?    No BrodyHummer with Aligula joyfully clinging to them, either. It's sad; they had a good thing going once.   She sees herself as a blot on her family's good name because she's powerless, so she blots herself out of their family photo with paint. Or WHITE-out.       Oh my god, that's a hell of a nice catch.   I think those eyes might be a little too big for his skull.  Regarding the white stuff, I thought it was poorly rendered spit when I watched it, but maybe it's paint.    Last ep left me so confused like what was the point of  shooting White? why did Despair need her dead? and what causes her to HNGGGG?     Whites heart was linked to the barrier so Despair shot her to take it down   Sonic a cute.   Everyone keeps saying it was to kill himself, but we've seen a clip of episode 12 where he's strolling around like nothing happened so I don't know. Her heart crapped out on her because her parents replaced it with one of the barriers though, and Despair seemed to be fucking around with them in some manner at the time.      OIC makes sense    Wow that was fucking depressing.  They should have skipped the ED.      They should have skipped the ED.  That made me laugh though. Something about the fact that all this shit comes on the heels of silly lunch adventures from Leo's perspective is really funny to me.     poor leo  his fanbase is forever stuck with him being paired with DUDES and he isnt allowed to have a girlfriend ever while his sister is getting married      He does make friends with a cute doctor later on.    I'm fine with him being single. He's never shown an interest in romance in the manga, so there's no real reason he needs a partner. Nej is good enough. I don't hate fujo pairings or anything but I definitely interpret Libra as a family dynamic so putting any of them in a relationship with each other feels weird to me. Shipping in general is kinda boring in my opinion.     Is anyone else doing episode 2? I feel a bit obnoxious live-posting like this.   Not sure what you mean by 'doing' but I thoroughly enjoy(ed) the series and I don't think anyone minds someone posting their reaction as they watch through it.  I guess you could sage if you're super worried.      Chain's actually on all the covers.     Leo does not require a romantic partner anyway and it's not like he's even interested in being in one, at the moment at least. Hell, even with White for the tiny crush he has, he's not really trying to heavily pursue it and is keeping it natural      sounds like genuine fujo logic  because ANYONE at this point of the manga will seem incredibly tacked on   Keeping no relationship at all with a male majority cast is pretty much fujo pandering         lupin leap     Some anons were trying to organize a rewatch week but I think it fell through when no one could make a stream. I was kind of nervous because it's a little reddit-tier but at the end of the day I care more about enjoying myself than I care about my anonymous e-cred.       If the "pandering" involves the absence of something then I'd take that over a shoe-horned romance. Forcing a relationship for no reason sounds like desperate to project onto fictional characters logic.     checking out Dis Pear  Hahaha.   He's going to dive naked into Kla--         Keeping no relationship at all with a male majority cast is pretty much fujo pandering   Look man, I know it must be hard having fujo/yuri shit piled on to you by the fanbase for any show you watch, but really i'm tired of forced romance in every anime/manga I watch. It's actually refreshing to someone who's not very much interested in romance at the moment. Although if he does hook up with someone then no damage there.     This guy couldn't even eat a burger right, he was doomed from the beginning.    That part made me believe Leo is a generally messy eater who likes drowns his burgers in sauce before eating them.    Something I'm a little disappointed with is that signs of Steven being a really shady character were pretty much dropped from the manga after volume 3, at least that I remember.   You've got a point there, even if he did make some excellent terrifying faces volume 8 when he was trying to scare Zapp and company into being on their best behavior.    I'm so glad someone posted this. Posts like  make it sound more like the anon posting it has trouble keeping the actual content of the anime or manga itself and the fan response and fanart etc. separate.     I am too, I just ended up not being able to watch 2 tonight because of a sudden commitment. I'm going to double-bill 2 and 3 tomorrow and probably get drunk off my ass doing it, though. Keep on with the posts, because there's at least one person enjoying reading them.  My final count for episode 1 drinking game was 2 cans of Blue Moon consumed.       what were the mannequins for    I'm just imagining him dumping the whole bottle with a stupid fucking grin on his face while Zapp and Zed judge silently.  Phantom Ghost Wagon was actually one of his better chapters in my opinion, he was fun and had a good sense of humor. That, Day In Day Out, and King's Restaurant (I could be forgetting one, it's been a while). Otherwise, he's usually the guy that looks serious on his phone unless he's talking to KK. Part of why I want that plot point to come back, so he can be interesting again.         Leo and Michella goes to Hawaii   Bonus chapter when?      Hey, hold on. He was a success, Don Arlelelle bought some of those paintings to hang in his spooky foyer.   Formerly unsatisfactory past sex partners, now decorations.   I want that plot point to come back, so he can be interesting again.   He has his little moments, like in episode 5 with the phone scene, or when he's disgusted by ZZ Top's failure to bring him lunch at the end of Escape From Pain.          Sad the episode skips this face.   Escape From Pain  I can't remember which chapter that was, is it the one in volume 7?      Yes, that's the one. Another excellent chapter for Zapp faces.   Those are some full-blown yaoi hands.   Man, don't go there.   How are they capable of eating humans without mouths?     I thought it was kind of neat that they showed Yggdrashiad Central Station while Chain was chasing the car.  What could go wrong?   Maybe they slurp it through their eyes with a straw.     its nice to see when the kyoani fags go to sleep the shitposting stops. why dont they go shitpost in one of the multiple threads they make everyday instead    random chick pops up and asks to be friends   knows his name without Leo introducing himself   Hindsight really is something        I don't even see why the fuck hibike fans and us needs to 'fight' in the first place. anons just enjoy what the enjoy and leave each party alone    I liked the use of fish eye lens in this episode to reinforce the god eyes theme. I think Matsumoto likes to use reflections a lot too.  Please, no more show wars. Don't even acknowledge the shitposters or they'll keep coming back because they know they can get a reaction out of you.  A lot of people were saying she was suspicious and had ulterior motives from the beginning. I don't think Leo is the type to doubt someone he perceives as a good person though.       Oops, last one was meant for      I don't think Leo is the type to doubt someone he perceives as a good person though.   True, I think that was also White's only slip up against Leo, nothing his "fuck this person is dangerous" meter go off on.      ;_;   Man Episode 11 felt like Kyousougiga, it was so good.  is it true that the anime is not following the manga?   look closely? si there something to notice?   Has anyone posted a synopsis of Only a Paper Moon yet? My moon is weak and I want to know if she truly is Spawn of Dicksuck.   White and Black are anime-original characters.    There's a difference between a turtle and a tortoise knight.  Episode 11 and 12 are original, all the others were adapting material from the manga. White and Black are original characters.      There are some spoilers around, but no full synopsis.  Don't quote me on this but I think I remember reading  that she turns out not to be his biological daughter.       I feel bad that Michella can't see how fine  her fiancé  is.    No, but that or some pictures of the illustrations would be great. I'm guessing from this comic that the premise is Leo telling Zed the story while they're at the bar from that one preview pic, so it's probably told in first person from his perspective.    When was top pic? I must've missed it    This one? In the ED. I think Leo mentions it when he eats at the diner with Black in episode 7 though.     tortoise knight  episode 1     So is her husband a fine guy? I remember peope saying he look fishy as fuck.   Why are they only crying out of their left eye? What symbolism am I missing?   white was leo this entire time   I want chain to stand on me    He's fine, he just has a ghost/mad scientist parasite.     Well, it says he isn't in pain so I guess he is a fine guy   Time for a WEG thread.  Post WEGs.      Freshly made OC  Is there one for LOGH?   Make it yourself  Here, I'm even giving you the template           The last one barely died a few hours ago.         I love it     ;_;     Pretty much all I can recall of that movie is:   Don't do the thing I told you to do which would fix everything, Shinji   I'm going to do it anyway   ...I must go now, my people need me          this is what punchline fags actually think       still the greatest ride I ever rode      I don't get it.    I don't see the relationship between those. And I've watched/played both multiple times.    Shit, what's the name of this again?    They're both pretty cuh-razy and they both utilize character songs as an important theme (I'm convinced that Armstrong's fight wouldn't have been half as great without STANDING HERE)    welcome to WEG, the YLYL of /a/      Wolf Children   anyone have a Trigun WEG?   Oh lordy... food shows are torture sometimes.     4 and something around here   see this    Fuck you.         Kill la Kill tried too hard to be the new Gurren Lagann and Prometheus tried too hard to be the new Alien, I know is shitty but I was bored.    That's not really how WEGs work, pal          Prometheus actually had good lore. Klk just shoved everything to the garbage as the show went on.       The fights weren't good in symphogear, and neither was the music, so how did you get Revengeance?   Reposting from last thread     Too true.    Get rekt kiddo          Any more for stuff from this season?          If you had read the source you would have expected what it is. Animeonlyfags are cancer. Kill yourself.    Is this even good? I watch eps 1 when it came out but i thought it looked like crap so i quit.          One of the few shows that continues to make me mad to this day.   something saved from previous threads   The manga was better        I agree. Regardless of the ending though, i have to congratulate them on animating it well while remaining faithful to the manga's strange artstyle.   I don't know why, but it always bugs me when the anime people expect is newer than the show. I know everyone doesn't watch stuff as it airs (hell, I've got a giant backlog) but it still irks me for some dumb reason.   Can you rephrase that? I have no idea what you are trying to say.    So from what I gathered Plastic Memories isn't my long awaited Japanese Blade Runner, but is it worth watching or should I just go rewatch GitS?    Do you like series like AnoHana, SaiKano and Kanon? If not, go rewatch GitS. Plastic Memories is a melodrama with a thin veneer of SF with bullshit like the robots having souls.      Heh, sorry, I've been up way too long. I dislike it when the "what I expected show" is newer than the "what I watched". Like if you watched Haruhi and expected Lucky Star.      Oooh, i concur. On the other hand, i haven't watched nearly enough anime to be able to call anons out on that.          So it's FFIX: The Anime?  Sign me the fuck up.        No fuck you. Seriously fuck you. You fucks kept reposting this to the point that when I started watching it, I assumed I was in for some harrowing experience. When I saw the cute little moe girl doing cute little moe things, I thought she was going to get blown apart by a tank shell by the third episode.   And of fucking course all it is is fucking moeshit.       he didn't watch episode 7   he didn't make it to the end of the series  laughingwotos.gif      That's pretty good     Babylon 5   I'm tempted now.      Don't. The first episode was great, but the rest of it is downhill from there.     The atmosphere created in the first episode gets  shattered  by the end.       Only bad thing is that Meliodas have not even ounce of Zidane's charm    Anime gave me aidschan   my favourite weg   It's completely wrong though.      It's still of haram    Sonydicked    Gainax is dead, Love live TRIGGER    I want more of Nagate and Izana interactions on the ship - as long as progress is made. Those episodes were great.     Degeneracy      I don't even /pol/       I don't get it.    Is this a new troll method? I don't even understand what you're trying to imply.   ITT: shitty tumblr gif's.    Is second raid any better?    What are we going to do after next week? Is there any hope for more UFO Girl and Friends?   Her parents gave her a stupid bullshit American hippy name so in an attempt to fit in she just wants people to call her Midori, like, you know, a normal japanese high school girl. It's not a hard concept to grasp.      these  it seems anon was the real autist here        has somebody edited a POMF =3 into fang-chan's pillow webm yet?    awesome    This season was pretty bad for /u/.   Houkago no Pleiades   Antagonist turns into male love interest for the MC, yuri subtext dropped after like four episodes. When was the last time a mahou shoujo had a straight romance, Sailor Moon?  Re-kan  Friendship end. Strong yuri subtext only in one episode, female "love interest" barely gets complementary friendship chocolate on Valentines day, same as fucking Yamada.  Mikagura  Friendship end, last episode has straight subtext, despite MC supposedly being a lesbian.  Punch Line  MC that turned out to be a female is actually just a boy trapped in a girls body.  I'm starting to understand why so many yuri fans are so angry all the time.              Who is best shingeki and why is it Annie?   Because she was characterized damn well.    I know this is you, anniebot. Don't lie.   Thats not Sasha  is anniebot a  girl    I only liked her when she laughed at Armin.  I want to say Mikasa is the best but she is actually really boring.     How would either wall breach had gone if the full SL had been there? Slightly less casualties maybe?       It isn't Annie, it is Jean, who was by the way confirmed the winner of the Mikasab owl in the Live action movie (just saw the thread in the archive; funny how deluded autists thought it was supposed to represent Levi somehow).  I am celebrating victory over here, whilst EM/YH autistcucks are getting cucked the fuck out.  Allah akbar. *shoots his AK47 in the air*        kill yourself    *teleports behind you* *unzips katana* *slashes your AK47 in half* *teleports away with a cheeky grin*  Nothin personnel kid          Ymirfag owns a katana  Literally nobody is surprised.     I only read the AK47 part of your post Not gonna bother with shipping shit m8     Based Jean.   Is EH the hero we need?   EH is freedom from the tyranny of YH and EM.    are you high?   It's now official that Hanji is a tranny, Isayama just said it on his blog   dubs    nice one     the neckbeard has to post the same 5 pictures he has over and over again because Japan will never make any new ones for his delusions     We knew that already. What retard still thinks he's female at this point?    Because we haven't seen anything of her in so fucking long you forget about her and then remember her and you think she's the best, but really she was okay.    Annie a shit.    you sound underage    And has not been changed for years thanks to crystalization.  The rest of her corps' characterizations are now very messy.     so whats going on now, i stopped reading when that bitch got crystalized and they were trying to get to the basement, did they ever make it?  why are the walls titans? whos the gorilla man? why isnt everyone dead when they were all dying left and right  lets make a lot of characters so we can use them as cannon fodder        you'll never marry Annie    Hange is best, everybody else is a shit.   http://blog.livedoor.jp/isayamahazi<wbr>me/archives/8867221.html  So Hanji is both male and female?  </wbr>  http://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Mt3WMO<wbr>fh2Wo</wbr>  [ ]  Dat kiss.     The fuck you say...    Annie worst girl    Sauce:  @hituzi2gou     Why do people care about the kiss?  best shingeki isnt a character but a concept. it's the concept of dropping shingeki and finding some self respect   It's inexpected I guess. And also it's probably because it's Mikasa.    Because Mikasa is only good for shipping fodder for self-inserting twats     Who is best kyojin and why is it Annie?     Blorphole Poover Poobar    It's okay, I got him covered.    Annie is love Annie is life Annie is the sun that warms my heart Annie a miracle of the universe Annie might've done some things wrong, but she's still a beautiful person inside and out           think they will finale be going there next chapter or atleast to Shiganshina District      First king had them build the walls with hardening abilities.      monkey trouble he is a shifter and the one leading the others. He is waiting at Shiganshina District for them.     reanimation jutsu             I haven't been that legitimately sad in a long time.    Annie a shit.  Can't even run away properly and just gives up on life.      Butthole a love.    Blorp oozes from the Butthole.    Serves him right for the semen demon he is.   Eren x Annie OTP    lets make a lot of characters so we can use them as cannon fodder  SnK in a nutshell, I wonder how Flegel and the reporters are still alive.     I think the series actually does a decent job making you care about the cannon fodder characters.      Who, Marco? Petra? The rest of Levi's squad? Nifa? Mike? Not really.    Same guy, I wanted to add that I only know their names because I lurk here, otherwise I might only remember Marco and that's because Jean couldn't shut up about it in the anime. In the manga he was just a random dead guy.    It makes me sad that titans are primarily supposed to be war machines and this'll never happen.    The character grew on me when I read them in manga compared to the anime.    Maybe if you watched the anime first. For someone that reads/watches it for the first time most of these characters are just random redshirts.   I wonder what will the ending be. Most likely the entire wall will be destroyed but then what?  Was pretty cool.   Hey man.  You intentionally left your trip on.     Lelouch is intentionally a faggot, news at 11.   Does anyone have the most recent chart? I was withouth internets for 2 weeks, I missed the release hype  Who is Monkey Trouble, am I supposed to be able to tell who he is? It's just a long haired glasses dude     That guy who led the squade when taking back Trost and had Mikasa and Eren's back.  Those two guys who died last at Utgard.  That black haired chick who died because Eren's an idiot.       That guy   Those two guys   That black haired chick  So you agree with me.       Hey, I never said anything about knowing their names.    I thought Levi squad will live because they are like elite of elites.    Annie is eliter.    There no memorable I just remember all their names   Damage control        Damage control  Do you even know what that means? I only added more to my rant, I didn't take anything back.     To jump off your "Marco is just a random dead guy" comment, he's really not. His portrait is featured at the start of every volum of the manga, whereas other dead characters have their's removed.   I have a feeling he's still important to the story somehow. Hopefully we'll find out when Annie gets uncrystalised.      Mmkay you don't remember every last one of them or anything I didn't even remember some of those names damn anon they really had an impact on you.     More like I lurk these threads a lot.        Historia a bestest.        You love them don't you I bet you cried when each one was killed off     N-No I didn't ;_;    Why I can't but agree with this.   Not that guy but I loved Petra, thinking she is qt and may be spared but not a single tears was shed when she died       It's one of the reasons why his characterfags think he'll come back.      I might be the only one who didn't give a shit about any of the fodder. Especially Levi Squad, they were too obvious.    Me neither. Although I wish Nanaba didn't die so soon.    Do not sexualize the queen.    No way he's coming back, but there has to be more to it than him just being a normal guy who died somehow.     I hope Levi died.   I remember Ian leaving an impression on me, he was an upstanding man and I'm sad he died.    Marco is Ymir's time travelling son from the future.  Marco will come back as a titan, Isayama said it.  Marco was just pretending to be dead, didn't you see that his left leg was moving?         NEW SYMPHOGEAR GX PV! GET HYPE, FAGGETS! IT'S REAL! https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CLc<wbr>pO8S8tvY</wbr>  [ ]       WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS TUMBLR FILTER BULLSHIT.   Looking forward to it. Hopefully it's better than G.      YES YES   finally   Pls don't bully   Seriously, how does this shit gets more season.  Season 1 was easily among the worst anime shows of all time.     She's too useless so even got kicked out from jail.      Because you have shit taste. Your favorite show will never get new season unless you paid money as us.    S2CA in the first episode  Cumming buckets    I don't understand, anon. How could you watch that PV and not instantly understand what people love this series for.  I for one am trying to hide my huge fucking happy grin after watching this during uni.    Remember, kids. Don't use LiNKER.  Can't. Stop. Watching.  That new song is lovely.  GUNGNIR  WUB WUB WUB DATTO? WUB WUB WUB      It's not ramen   Elfnine a cute  So i guess Maria won't have relic in s3 for first few episodes?  Who are you calling Raildex rejected character design?   villains are more girls with probably sad pasts and good intentions   I kinda miss season 1 when you had this feel of impending doom with noise fucking up the world at any time, was a decent setting for girls in armor fucking shit up.  dramatic villains will just make for more shitty added drama and pointless filler like season 2 felt mid-season.  will still enjoy the fuck out of this tho.         Yeah, it's broken according to the character description. But that didn't stop it from activating last season. She probably doesn't even have the pendant, Kirika and Shirabe didn't have theirs either.<br/>     determination to fist    [Megadeth Party intensifies]  I was just too excited, I'm sorry.     I hated both antagonists in S1 and S2 but yea S1 was amazing.     Too bad we're never going to be able to see it.   But the dolls are free to beat up without repercussions.   NOW I'VE LOST IT   Smug, isn't she?    Who voices who again? I only know Misaki Kuno.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shizu<wbr>ka_Ishigami  You will also see her in fall  </wbr>     That no-name resume  Disgusting.    Ned buntline93R is the villain.

Give the newbies a chance. I wonder how these people feel like, sitting in the same recording room as Nana Mizuki.     Shitty quality webm  puu dot sh/iAMos dot webm     Westphalia is relevant.     in the pastebin here<br/>     I would feel honored and pressured at the same time if ever I would have the opportunity to work with all those professional VAs in the industry. Regardless, I couldn't care less about a no-name VA like her.    no singing    She's not really no game anyway, just not getting crazy push like Amamiya Sora.    Marked as ひみつ, so secret characters.     Peace of Westphalia   relevant in the 21st century  Satelight, wot?     How gay will it be?  I want to protect that smile.   Not nearly enough.    Yeah, there's something to the tone that early S1 had that might not be able to be replicated here. On the other hand, there was plenty of room to improve on S2's take on villains, so the opportunity is there.    Are the new sluts gonna join Hibiki's harem too? We kinda have too many girls now.     Chrismind.      Oh look, a time paradox.    <br/>     08:24   08:23  Damn.       Dolls probably gonna die. No idea about the two twins. Maybe they will fuse and become one and then die or return to their home planet.    <br/>    Until what ends Bwen?   Subs never Fuck commeme       You should be able to recognize enough moonspeak to watch it raw now, anon.    So what song was this? OP or ED? The concert looks like it will be another highlight, but it will be tough to beat the previous ones.      You'd be surprised. If you are not actively trying to link the moonspeak you hear to the subtitles you are not gonna learn anything even if you watch anime for 50 years.    Neither. OP is called Exterminate and ED called Rebirth-Day. Probably gonna be a battle song. Sounds a lot like a finale song though.     MARIA DINDU NUFFIN JUST TRYIN GET HER LIFE ON TRACK NEED MO' MONEY FOR DEM CONCERTS     I am One with the Hype  IT'S HYPENING  How many songs are they going to fit into the first episode? Probably like 3 not including OP and ED, from the looks of the concert and likely two battles that they previewed. Excited   They'd feel awkward at first, but once they see Nana is kind and acts like a grade schooler sometimes they'll warm up eventually. Then they'll be reminded of their position again once Nana starts to do her job and once they see her sing live.     I hope at least red and blue do. They are cute as fuck.     Don't you know in Symphogear universe the leader of NSA is also the leader of Illuminati?    mfw see this  FUCK YES     Symphogear game by Platinum when?   Tsubasa looks like a man, holy shit.   Song of prologue, Hibiki's battle song, live concert song, special ED song.    meant to quote<br/>    Who da man? Tsubaman.    GET EXCITE!     I WANT TO PROTECT YUKINE'S SMILE!     And?   Do people actually think this is a good show or is it just a meme show?   We're all just here because we want to fuck Chris Or get fucked by Tsubasa Or watch Miku and Hibiki make out      Good action, amazing music, fun characters, interesting mythology of the show, ending of S1 is GOAT.  It's just great.     [SENKOU INTENSIFIES] when?    Tsubasa will never gently dominate you   Tsubasa gently fucking Chris doujins never  Why      We like it because its full of dumb fun, we love Nana Mizuki, and we like cute manly girls fighting while singing.   So if I get this right they authorized international geah action.   I think I'm gay for Tsubaman.      Watch it for the girls   Wow, /a/ really does love moeshit    Good action, amazing music, fun characters, interesting mythology of the show, ending of S1 is GOAT   Stop lying anytime.            Watching anime for girls is better than watching anime for the gay men.     hating fun  it's like I'm really on /v/      makes me think of magi and the jew faction     Given that you're commenting on it with such conviction, I have to assume you've watched the whole thing. I mean, you'd look pretty dumb if you called something shit without ever watching it.      Just an observation on how the other boards are correct in the statement of moe anime and /a/, not saying it's bad.   Saw Season 1 and 4 episodes of Season 2. First few episodes were pretty interesting but it all came back to moe shit. The final fight was alright though.         There's plenty of worse stuff than Symphogear mind you. I thought it was ok to watch, story may not be spectacular but was enjoyable to watch.     people describe what they like about Symphogear   dismiss it out of hand   posts western shit <br/>      http://anoxy.se/uploads/2015/06/2qu<wbr>32w8qg6ytzdr.webm</wbr>   So guys, what are the lyrics for Dark Oblivion anyway?   Stand up! Hello ground!      thread slowly getting derailed again  Jesus Christ, just ignore the faggot.  So what is your wild speculahs for GX, /a/?       4 episodes of Season 2   missed out on episode 5, the point where everything goes completely batshit   missed episode 6, where best girl appears      Does anyone have Bikkiebutt statistics on them?    moeshit  Please go back to /v/ or /co/ and never fucking come back.     Did they change Anime ja nai's hairstyle?      So what is your wild speculahs for GX, /a/?    Maria will be useful again        http://www.animelyrics.com/anime/sy<wbr>mphogearg/darkoblivion.htm Really good english. Hikasa just butchered the pronounciation. </wbr>     those vagina bones  It looks quite weird but its lewd as hell. I liked Tsubasa's G gear more, why do they have to remove parts of their already revealing gears? Are they prostitutes or something?       Are they prostitutes or something?  Idols. Same thing really.     Hibizerker will appear as a separate entity, have a crazy punch-on with Hibiki, then be tamed by the power of SUNSHINE.    They should've let Ayahi sing that, for god's sake. Nana x Ayahi duet when?     Are you implying Nana is a prostitute? Don't compare actual pure idols to the sluts that fuck everyone for money and don't give a shit about their fans.        Nana   Idol   Bitch she's an artist.      Did they put Maria in a goddamn straitjacket What are they afraid she'll do, cry at them?    They're afraid her uselessness might spread to other Gears.    She is called an idol too by some people, fucker.     That was the joke.   Now post what you hear her singing.      But Tsubasa isn't a prostitute. If anything she'll be the one to buy the prostitutes.      Tsubasa became Chris' new pimp     Please no bully. Chris is pure.     That doesn't stop her from having a youth full of hard work.       Tsubasa-senpai please stop with your heart hymen thing.       not hibiki  what    That concert looks even more amazing than in G. I can't wait for the song.    So did they ever explain how supposedly human characters could chuck boulders and sprint across water?  Also the fact that they're bringing back the shitty G Gears is making me reeeeeeeeee     What are some other anime that were widely discussed on /a/ as they aired, and then quickly forgotten?   A board that mostly talks about seasonal anime runs out of things to talk about when the season ends and doesn't force threads on shows everyone but you has already talked about  What a shock. Lurk more.   Coppellion. Probably for the best.   cause it /a/ doesn't have a long enough attention span    KLK    Some shows that had a lot of airing hype completely disappeared after they ended, C3 being a good example. Greatest blunder is probably Kill la Kill. Some other shows only had a small audience among /a/, which disintegrated after the show was over.    Lucky Star Maybe not "quickly forgotten", but considering what a massive phenomenon it used to be it sure is dead by now. All the other "hits" from that era(Haruhi, CLANNAD, TTGL) are still being remembered to this day but no one gives a shit about Lucky Star.    Forgot Code Geass, which is still a thing as well    c3-bu was my AOTS    http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5_6L<wbr>vKWy5vo</wbr>  [ ]   Basically everything, because of  - look at recent seasons. Death Parade, YKA, Rolling Girls, Maria the Virgin Witch, Shingeki no Bahamut (though it's getting S2), Kokkuri-san, etc. There are only two or three shows a season that get talked about consistently after it's over, and that's the way it should be.  Angel Beats    Fucking Gainax took us on a trip with c3. At least the threads were entertaining. The ending was fucking terrible, I just don't know what the goal was with this show.     You die and are reborn into an anime (not as the MC but as a normal side character)  Which one would it be?    Tough choice there, OP.     Witch Craft Works. Purely becomes kemonomimi people are considered a normal, ordinary thing by people who don't know magic exists.    Any character in a nonshonen series.   Question. If I die again can I go to a different series?   There's nothing I want more than to be a Dog Days side character   No, we don't know if there's life after death after death.     MFW  I wanted to break the system.     Yuyushiki or Yuru Yuri. Something with almost no boys so I have a high chance of becoming the little girl.   index    Free!     We can't have a bunch of side characters killing themselves because they want to go to another series    Yuri yuri because I've never seen anything bad happen in the show    Who said I was going to kill myself?   Define "normal". Until then I'd pick Embryo. An immortal God.   Baccano  location doesn't change   chance at immortality   fedoras are still cool to wear in public       Pokemon   Probably Durarara. I'll join Dollars and become buddies with the van gang.   Asobi-ni-ikuyo   Magic and super science exist   qt alien catgirls have come to earth in peace   They're sharing their technology   Including a fucking space elevator   Seriously, even if I never even see a Catian in person, the stuff they're willing to share clearly means the whole world benefits.         Symphogear so I can buy Nana Mizuki albums.  Polnareff. Definitely.  on a quest to avenge his imouto   has an armored stand with a sword   /ss/   doesn't afraid of anything   is an idiot that never shuts up        Pokemon obviously.   That one anime with the drink cans that turn into animu girls  or that one where you had to fight for meals in a convenience store       berserk as a peaceful farming villager with wife and 3 kids   kids were ate in front of you and your wife turned into a breeding sow   by trolls   die of starvation in a deserted village        Pretty sure they meant no specific supporting characters either.   But still, Jojoworld has stands. And Tonio's food.     For Anime, either Hunter x Hunter or Soul Eater, since in both the probability of being able to be a bad ass even outside the story is pretty damn high.  I wanna say that for a manga I'd choose Hero Academia for the same reason.    Shinsekai Yori because having telekinesis and living in a utopia would be pretty awesome. Either that or GitS because cybernetics would also be pretty awesome even if it's just a basic cyberbrain modification that most civilians recieve.    once a cuck, always a cuck   ZnT world. That seems like fun.    But then those would be background characters.   GALAX seems like an app that would actually be useful.  I feel its worth noting that the OP only said pick an anime to be a background character in. He didn't say could could pick your background character.  Because then people would pick Akarin.       Polnareff   not the main character of part 3   implying Jotaro isn't just a side character there to mop up messes       A random rabbit in GochiUsa.    Hokuto no Ken   YKK    not choosing to be Miku so you can fuck Hibiki every night   Alternatively you could just be a random guy who NTRs Miku but that would require more effort.      Jojo, you don't need to be anywhere near the cast to get a stand.    Cromartie High School world  JoJo if i can eat Tonio's food, also, having a Stand would be useful as fuck.     D-Frag    wanting to be a cuck instead of a DRAGON    Kagami from Lucky Star.  Bobobo-Bo Bo-Bobo because I want to wig out with Bobobo, Don Patch, and Jelly Jiggler.   I'd like to end up in Yamada-kun, either I get to be a witch, or get kissed.   I would be fine with any of: Darker than black. Erryday monster grills. Sora no Woto YKK  and maybe Yuru Yuri since everybody is a gay little girl and even though the world itself is the same I'd still be living the dream since I'd be one too.         I'd try to score at least once though.  Poor Speedy never scored.     Spice and Wolf, I want to study magic and go on adventures.    Implying   I doubt anyone on 4chan has the mental stability to keep their powers from leaking and destroying the world around them.  At best you might be a queerat and live a primitive life underground.         yfw you end up in Saito's world.    Code Geass so i can be with mai waifu  Shirobako so I can marry Aoi.  Durarara!! It just seems so fun.    Obviously. Especially if it's an early season and I retain all my knowledge of the games. I'd look like a fucking wizard if I bagged a legendary bird before Ash shows up.   Danmachi, so I can grind    Demonbane  Try becoming a sorcerer and hopefully someday be powerful enough to make a contract with my own immortal book-loli.   GitS  I basically get to live in a possible future of our world. Also, I will be able to get an android-loli.       Hard choice between Index (30 years advanced tech + espers + magic) and Baccano! (just to follow Isaac and Miria).   Good choice, but i'll go with Railgun    patrician taste anon    Actually they even state they have come to breed with human males, so essentially every male will get a horny cat girl.     I just be a mook that goes with D-Frag cast shenanigans but will win the Funabori.     Prision school.  I ask where Hana's room is located.   Slip inside through the window to steal Kate's hard drive containing the porn.   Sneak into the student council office. I sit at the desk with a glass of scotch and a cigarette waiting for Mari and her gang to appear.  Tell her my plans as the ruler of the new council, with her sister being the president.  Place Mari and Kate together in a cell. Upgrade security to include bug recorders and signal jammers inside the prison.  Begin my pranking the boys.  Use the prisoners for entertainment such as bikini car wash.                 Haruhi Suzumiya no Yuutsu because the side characters are the main characters in that series.     both are in the same place/background so it wouldn't make a difference. Also good taste pretty much guaranteed cool ass powers just not much guaranteed power levels plus cute esp girls    posting on /a/   having the willpower or fighting spirit to be able to actually control the stands  You'll end up like Holly     DBZ   one of the world's strongest beings   should be fine unless I'm Krillin       Monster Musume, easily.  It'd be comparable to my daily life, only better, due to the fact that Monster Girls exist.     Man, I don't know anon. If Alessi or Boingo can get one...      This. I want to run a bakery with a Slurpuff and a Hydreigon for deliveries. Or a landscaping company with a Tyranitar for knocking down mountains and redirecting rivers.     HxH universe without hesitation   I don't think I could take that fist    I hope you like mafia, bitching wheelchairs and to be lonely. 'cos it will be only worse from now on.     Die and become a turtle    Anime: Pokemon. I can literally just run around and do nothing. Maybe even get paid to just watch pokemon.  Hentai: Ransem. I want to toilet brush that chick, except with my dick.     Ye   Outlaw star Should be pretty neat as long as I am not on the backwater planet at the start Might even get to see some Ctarl Ctarl fat cat tats    Initial D so I could live out one my dreams and become a Japanese toegay drifter, only to have them shattered by some kid in a Corolla.   Yeah, but how many times have random passerbys been used to demonstrate the enemy's strength/powers/cruelty. Or hell, just imagine what'd happen to you during Made in Heaven's reset    Yeah, but all of the powers rely on advanced mathematics. Do you want to do calculus or Trig every time you make a small ember with your Level 1 power?    Lucky Star   Its just fucking high school agian except I get to dick Konata     Depends purely on whether or not I can influence the plot. Rendering mikono in aquarion evol deceased would be quite a satisfaction.   K-ON.  If my plan succeeds there will be 5 members in the light music club, not 4.     Yugioh or Pokemon as long as I retain knowledge about the franchise If not, then any moeshit anime will do      This is... a pretty damn good answer, actually. You basically get to go to Hogwarts, learn magic and have fun. Bad stuff basically never really happens, and while there's danger and politics and drama, all of that stuff is taken care of by people way more important than you.   You just get to have fun at magic high school.        Knowledge probably won't be as good as you think it'll be. I mean, if your idea is that your knowledge of yugioh deck building will let you totally kick butt in a world where card games are serious business, I should remind you that all the important people in that world have special powers that mind control or instantly draw the card they need, or sometimes just outright ignore the rules.      Pokemon would be fucking to live in. It looks easy when you're playing it on a screen, but can you imagine being 10 years old and forced to wander around the wildnerness where wild animals that can spit fire or lightning will just randomly jump out at you every 5 steps you take?     But it's a kids show where nothing bad ever happens to anybody, though. It's got free healthcare, and nobody even complains about it.    The bro    Ya know   I choose Food Porn: The Anime   One Piece easy. Find a devil fruit and eat it. Enslave some east blue or 1st half grand line island. I don't need to find the One Piece it's easy to be a boss in that world.    Why would anyone choose a realistic real world-like setting?  Choose one that has a confirmed afterlife or at least reincarnation so after you die you're not gone forever like in real life.      Raildex-verse. Science side FTW     what if you already died and are currently living as a background character for a slice of life anime?    I choose the Saki-verse. It's a haven for gambling addicts. Also no boys allowed   not choosing the world where you can literally steal other people's powers by gouging out their eyes     not choosing autismland  I don't see the problem here, anon.    Atelier  show me what you got!        i miss her ;_;      obligatory            Speaking of gintama, why is todays episode airing early?       Wait, what? Is airing early?

Gin is way too op       Yeah I can just never remember the episode number     under rated episode    113      That shit killed me   Come on new ep   H-hes going to be alright, r-right?

He's going to wake up and beat the shit out of the Tendou with a bad-ass new scar in his face   Right? ;_;        We can't let this Thread die    C-Course he will anon... of course he will, the he'll marry Otae and raise a family, just like he wanted... He just needs to sleep for a bit so let's let him be for a while.     <br/>   I swear to God if he doesn't stand up...       my body is ready  When is new chapter coming out?   At the usual time.   Oh fuck you animegg for getting my hopes up   What happened?   It didn't drop but it was a nice dream   R-right, Hijikata shouldn't push his mayo-addict to his fellow comrade. Pict unrelated.    Please don't die    It airs at the usual time today     What happen to the shogun?                        I love this arc    Oh god my fucking heart    When the night has come and the land is dark and the moon is the only light we'll see.          DONDAKE     Probably going to get shit on for asking this but I'm sure there are some tumblr using anons. Does anybody know if those cows are butthurt about Hijikata being a fat pig of a creature?       tbh im really unhappy that the anime thought it was OK to air something like that in 2015, but this is the same series that makes light of transgenders and genderfluid people so i dunno what i was even expecting tbh.   hopefully the series/ Hideachi will grow up out of these dated, backwards as hell views on queer folk        Please tell me you grabbed this from tumblr and didn't write it yourself. Please.           Being butthurt about comedy    Hot off the .webm presses.    The arc will end today  Fun times, the only time Gintama got numerous threads that hit bump limit continuously       Reaction image thread <br/>   no   7 minutes   meizhi      I still dont get this joke   it's time  yamazaki's voice makes me feel things    DAT GORILLA  next week is the bento chapter.

[HorribleSubs] Gintama - 277 [720p].mkv   It's out!            /a/ show me your sad face  This is my sad face          Why are the explanations for how magic works in this easier to understand when I'm drunk?   Miyuki worst character of Mahouka   Lina a best   ERIKA FOREVER.     I'm gonna miss this package deal  So did she really loved him?  Yes.   Fair enough, but it was at least something.     Not only were they slow to reaload, also the first rifles had no rifling, wich means they were really inacurate and thus only used in big formations. I mean if you shoot 50 rifles at least one will hit.  In a dueling scenarios, it would be folly to rely on that 1 shot incapacitating your oponent, before he gets close enough to chop you up into bits.       yes.  but she wanted revenge more.     what was her eye changing for them?</blockquote>]
