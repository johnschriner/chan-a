[   I'm going to marry Akari.  What a fucking snore fest. Why would anybody torture themselves watching this trash?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=335<wbr>TBZ7DhgQ</wbr>  [ ]  <br><br><br>But I already married her.</br></br></br>  <br>why would your fucking shut up nerd ohhhhhh, #shotsfired</br>                                <br>;_;</br>    <br>you're doing the lord's work anon.</br>  <br>And done.</br>  World trigger thread.<br><br>Osamu stares down everyone.<br>Press conference scenes were pretty good, seeing Netsuki getting BTFO was satisfying.<br><br>Also Sakurako is cute.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>found a new waifu</br>  <br>When is the new chapter coming out? I'm incredibly forgetful when it comes to release dates.</br>  <br>In two or three days.<br>This week there wasn't one.</br></br>  <br>Toei picked a pretty good VA. She sounds so energetic and excited even SatoKen had to calm her down.</br>  <br>Thanks, it will be interesting to see what Arashiyama teaches Osamu.</br>  Why is mikumo better than most WSJ MCs?  <br>Viz on monday. Shit scans are usually out around now.</br>  <br>I've actually thought about this a bit. <br><br>I think it's cause he feels like a real ordinary guy. He has no special powers, no real talent at all, no special training or special weapons. Those are all things Yuma has, but not Osamu. <br><br>Osamu is this hopelessly outclassed normal person who repeatedly fails, and who is very self-aware of his own weakness, but whose conviction and determination make him an admirable person. <br><br>So as a result he feels like a genuine underdog protagonist. Rooting for him feels good because he has basically nothing going for him except being an upstanding person.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's weak but he doesn't get much plot armor.<br>Instead of that he gets punched and kicked by deliquents and pierced by aliens almost bleeding to death. Yet he still tries hard to stand up for what he believes is right.</br></br>  <br>You make a good point. I feel like now I have to seek out shows where I can root for more underdogs.</br>  <br>Just wondering but is it worth doing a marathon of all the episodes at the moment?<br><br>Is the show worth watching?</br></br></br>  <br>Just to add to this anon's post.<br>In my opinion his design is ACTUALLY ordinary. We have other series that boasts their MCs are ordinary or normal but the character design looks nothing like a normal guy.</br></br>  <br>It's not bad for Toei, but still pretty padded compared to the manga. I'd recommend the manga though. Pretty good world building and engaging action, likable characters (mostly). MC is a cool dude.</br>  <br>Also same guy, but I'm rpetty interested thanks to this post<br><br>I do like Underdog protags (who doesn't?) and all but I hope he's at least not THAT badly overshadowed.<br><br> Are there any good waifus? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't really mind padded anime as I mostly want something to marathon.<br><br>I actually did read the manga for a bit and remembered how the glasses guy actually didn't amount to anything compared to the white haired guy which is why I sort of stopped. Does he git gud?</br></br></br>  <br> at the moment? <br>If you waited so long, wait till it finishes airing.<br>There are longish recaps at the beginning of each episode, some Toei QUALITY and the lack of budget is often visible.<br> Is the show worth watching? <br>Try manga, you'll see if it's your thing or not.<br><br> Are there any good waifus? <br>Yes. From lolis to MILFs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's extremely slow paced and the animation is Toei tier so it's probably really boring to marathon. The manga is better.<br><br> watching anime for "waifus" <br>Goddammit, I hate these people. Though pretty much every girl in the series is likeable.</br></br></br></br>  <br> any good waifus? </br>  <br>He's overshadowed a lot. He's very weak and doesn't get the usual protagonist plot armor/freebie wins you'd expect. Instead he just happens to be friends with a character who won the shounen protagonist lottery in terms of abilities and character traits. <br><br>You'll find his weakness bothersome at first, but after the Big Invasion arc you'll be at peace with it, since he shows his true mettle then.</br></br></br>  <br>I finished Inazuma Eleven, two episodes a day. I think I could handle it.<br><br>Might as well check it out.</br></br></br>  <br> Does he git gud? <br>Not compared to Yuma. He's better than he was, thanks to getting some good teachers and lots of practice. He's actually somewhat respectable, but still very outclassed even by peers in his own rank. <br><br>Comparing him to Yuma is unfair though, since it becomes apparent that he's freakishly strong even by A-Rank standards.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I'll be curious for his role in Rank Wars. It'll be interesting what he does or will he just like, Osamu-anchor.</br>  <br>Yeah I keep wanting Osamu to improve. I mean, it's fun watching Yuma and Chika wreck shit, but Osamu has the potential to be a wild card since nobody expects anything from him.</br>  <br>Konami has the best gap moe in the series for sure.</br>  <br> which is why I sort of stopped. <br>Why people are so desperate to see wish fulfillment overpowered MCs all the time is a mystery to me, and the phenomenon really bothers me. Is there something wrong with society such that I've seen so many people complain about the fact that Osamu is a mostly normal guy who gets by through hard work and struggles to reach his goals? Why do so many people keep wishing him to have some super secret hidden power that will eventually allow him to blow others away? Does everyone need to be kirito? As a group are we missing something that we desire to see in anime characters?<br><br><br>As an animeonlyfag I was pretty excited when Shiori became tamakoma 2's operator. She's generic but her VA makes her sound so relaxing. Not nearly as interesting as the other girls, but that's not a problem.</br></br></br></br></br>  I love the author's notes on the characters.  <br>The inner workings of this mind are fantastic.<br> designed after my rice cooker <br>I always wondered why he looked familiar.</br></br></br>  <br> Kitora <br>Damn do they know their target audience.</br></br>  <br><br>He's so up front about everything.</br></br>        <br> delinquent Osamu <br>Now this I gotta see</br></br>  <br>It was pretty fun to marathon actually.</br>  Seriously, do you want to marry a baka-ojousama? Considering your children will have a 50% autism chance?  <br> 50% autism chance <br>are you implying wakaba isn't autistic?</br></br>  <br>Wait... are you saying Anon is autistic?</br>  OTAKU?<br>OTAKU DESU KA?</br>  bakaba  <br>Was something lost in CR's shit translation or was wakaba just being dumb?</br>  Wakaba is just pretending inorder to become a highschool girl  <br>otaku is actually a colloquialism from archaic japanese so it probably has a novelty to an ojou-sama, but the translation was word for word</br>  <br>Otaku means you so she thought it was funny she was saying "you're an otaku" by saying "otaku otaku"</br>  Baka-ojousamas are the new best thing.  But who is actually the mother and sister  I'd do it just for the money.  <br> Not wanting to love Wakaba and make her your gyaru <br>Come on anon.</br></br>  <br>She's too precious to not marry. Not like I'll have her preggos  oh shit whoops. </br>  <br>Mao please</br>  <br>I will if she pays me.</br>  <br><br>Mao stawp.</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure Mao wouldn't drink Wakaba's piss for $25.</br>  <br>Mao is marrying Wakaba to go eat at French restaurants and get ice cream every day.</br>  The real question is will these two marry?!!  <br>Moe can be her maid</br>  <br>Oh, a maid-master romance.</br>  What's a chinese jump rope?  <br>Like a normal jump rope, except it trips you if you say Hong Kong or Taiwan</br>   PIN   PON    manga TL never <br>Why do CGDCT manga never get translated, or get dropped really early?</br>  <br>From what I can tell the anime will cover literally everything in the manga anyway, so at least we're not missing anything</br>  <br> still fuming about Gochiusa's Dolicon disappearing <br> also still fuming about how Kinmoza got nothing past Vol 1 and how Vol 1 is missing two pages </br></br>  <br>Inevitably the manga will have some gems that should have been used...</br>  <br> ... <br>Fuck off to reddit</br></br>  <br> autism means every kind of even slightly abnormal behaviour <br><br>It's time to stop using that buzzword, it has lost all meaning by now.</br></br></br>  <br>You fuck off, because I'm not wrong.</br>  <br>You type like a massive newfag who has just come here from reddit. Lurk more</br>  Pinpon narashite<br>Pinponpon taiken shiyou!</br>  <br>I don't hang around Reddit, but believe what you want.</br>  <br>So stop wasting time complaining and go to the Daily Japanese Threads.</br>  Did this last episode emotionally drain anyone else? It honestly pains me to see Wakaba lose her purity. It was funny seeing her confuse "galgame" with "gyarugame" and then seeing her buy it in her misguided attempt to become gyaru, but it's sad. She gets to high school and becomes corrupted? Honestly, fuck Nao, that fujoshi piece of shit, I hope she gets hit by a truck. Why the fuck does she feel the need to spread her disgusting sickness to a beautiful flower like Wakaba?  <br>I'd do it for free.</br>  <br><br>I love the OP and this anime in general.<br><br>It's really fun.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Ok, sure.</br>  Who are these faceless men playing jump rope with Moe-tan?  <br>The anime should have ended there, with Wakaba's mom transferring her out of the school due to fear of her mixing with bad friends.</br>  <br>Instead of ending, why not just a show about Wakaba + her mom and sister?</br>  <br>I think the only kind of person who would spend hours of their time stealing and editing chinese cartoons are the ones who like to feel recognized and special. Hence they prefer manga with protagonists who have special powers or something so that they can self-insert, rather than cute sol. It's also why we keep getting escalator drama and credit pages and stuff.</br>  I want this.  <br> wishing terrible thing on schoolgirls <br>Wakaba would be appalled. Also she is just getting a bit of real life exposure, it's to be expected.</br></br>  <br>no, fuck you. She's not being exposed to "real life" she being exposed to the seedy, disgusting underbelly of real life and it's equally appaling subcultures.<br><br>She should be leaning about history, tea ceremonies, and equestrian matters, not BL porn games and disgusting gyaru whores.</br></br></br>  Mao &gt; Wakaba &gt; Moe &gt; Fujoshi  <br><br> Mao &gt; Wakaba <br><br>Wakaba is the greatest.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I should be dull to it by now, but i still get a tingle whenever I see a poster so low-functioning autistic.</br>  <br>Mao is cutest and lewdest.</br>  <br><br>Nopan?</br></br>  <br>What if  they were joking? </br>    <br>What if  you're the autist? </br>  So how long until the compensated dating episode? It's a very important part in the life of the gyaru after all, Wakaba won't enjoy her highschool life to the fullest without it. Mao can introduce her to her clients, I bet Moe has one or two for sharing too.  <br> If a person possesses any tolerable amount of common sense and experience, his own mode of laying out his existence is the best, not because it is the best in itself, but because it is his own mode. </br>  New chapter up soon.  I don't think there's any 'anticipation' for this shit anymore.<br> also be prepared to be flooded with /co/tards starting August. Thanks Toonami </br>  <br>GOOK SCANS WHEN</br>  <br>Niggastream &amp; the gooks are at fault for that.</br>  <br>Tashiro said on his twitter the new chapter will be exciting and interesting.</br>  <br>Who gives a shit anymore?<br><br>Sure. He wants to spark up some interest but this is already over. He'd better rush the thing and start something else.</br></br></br>  <br> implying we give a fuck about this. </br>    How would you rank My Hero Academia in terms of quality compared to other popular shounen manga? Is it Fairy Tail/Black Clover level of terrible?  <br>Something like FMA would be considered God Tier, this is just alright.</br>  <br>Best artwork in shonen jump so far</br>  As far as WSJ goes, this is the best thing they've published in years.  <br><br> that rushed ending <br><br> god tier <br><br>yeah no. while fma was good it was far from being perfect</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We need a battle shonen hero for shonen jump.<br><br>World Trigger is not good and Toriko is boring. Bleach is dead. One piece is one piece. And Black Clover is garbage.</br></br></br>  Read the guide before asking anything buyfag related.<br><br>http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  Reminder that this is acceptable condition according to buyfags.  <br>Just be a bother on the figure page about wanting to buy a new box off of someone.<br>Even though I agree that your box arrived in abhorrent condition, GSC won't replace it because it's not their problem and it did the job they claim it's supposed to do.</br></br>  <br>Are you seriously mad at us for not being upset enough? It's the third time someone has posted pics of their fucked up Miku box and GSC already said they won't do anything about it.</br>  <br> miku <br><br>It's trash</br></br></br>    <br><br>Awesome. She'll look great when she comes out in 2019</br></br>  <br>Easily best one.

I think they also have a few mikus  <br>Or I guess today.</br>  <br>where are you looking up this concept art?</br>  Reminder it's happening next week  <br>Looks great, though his pose looks a little strange and uncomfortable. Can't wait to see him painted.</br>  <br>4UUUUU!!!</br>  <br/>  <br><br>Well yeah, since I live in Japan</br></br>  <br>Piapro</br>  This year,right?  <br>b-but I don't want to  lose you, anon </br>  <br>He seems to be looking up too much.

I'd take slapstick over this any day.</br>  "This is a shitty anime made for sexual gratification of male audiences."<br><br>It also reeks of your typical "liberal" idiocy of "either you have to be an ultra-conservative prude who keeps children laughably sexually oblivious because you think sexuality is dirty, or you have your culture revel in all kinds of perversions and pornography which also do jack shit to challenge the status quo of seeing sexuality as something dirty."<br><br><br>The anime's title claims that it plays in a world where dirty jokes don't exist. Clearly they do exist, because people register them, except for ignorant children (just like in our current real-life culture, except the age of ignorance is raised).<br><br>A world where dirty jokes actually don't exist would be a world where people don't associate sexuality with perversion in first place. The whole concept of a dirty joke is based on the premise that sexuality is dirty, and hence a joke referencing sexuality is a dirty joke. This is the very same backwards, conservative mindset against sexuality, with the sole difference that now it's not banned but paradoxically celebrated despite still being exercised in perverted (dirty) ways.<br><br>Ask yourself why real-life women and especially young women and girls tend to be less inclined to partake in sexual discussions and dirty jokes. It's because in our current conception of dirty sexuality, the dirtiness serves as a way of demeaning the female side in sexuality. Either a formerly "pure" woman is dirtied, or an already dirty slut's dirtiness is enjoyed. In either case the female side's dignity is sold off for the male side's pleasure.<br><br>Which is why it's also bullshit that the girls in this show would naturally/instinctively find the pictures they're shown to be attractive.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I cringed.
