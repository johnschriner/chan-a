Sorry to ask but is it possible to see a WIP of the twintail fusion?  <br>I think he means signing it onto the drawing, or pixels in this case, itself, as that kind of ruins the piece. It's fine when you do it at the side though.</br>  Requesting fusion of Arata Demon Lord Form, Issei Balence Breaker and Tatsumi Incursio.  <br>Who?</br>  Requesting Sandalphon (left) playing with plushies of the Gunbuster bugs (middle) while Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann tells the view that Gainax is over meaning this will never happen.<br><br>At this point I'm considering of just removing TTGL and just have Sandy play with bug plushies.</br></br>  <br>ah I see what you mean</br>  <br>not him, but signing your shit makes you look like a pretentious shit, especially when you're not that good.<br>most good artists don't sign their shit but they'll do things that makes sure you know its them.</br></br>  Color request for two pictures with 99% the same, please.<br><br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=48328<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=48329</wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  Did we past the 5 year anniversary date already?  <br>This will never happen :^(</br>  <br> two pictures that are 99% the same <br>That was terrible grammar and I apologize for that level of faggotry.</br></br>  <br>Hopefully she doesn't drop any of her cards on the dirty floor.<br>That would be a dilemma.<br> Either try to clean it off with a damp towel and risk water damaging the cards <br> Or just leave it be and have a germy card that you picked up off the dirty bathroom floor </br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm gonna fuck you in the ass. Nay, I'm gonna fuck you in the worst way possible. This fuck is going to be the fuck of all fucks, after you're fucked no one can get fucked in the way you were fucked in. This will set the world standards for fuckings, nay the galactic, or rather universal standard for fucking. That's right, I'm gonna fuck you in the most creative way possible so that aliens have to come to earth and confirm that this fucking happened, they will come to realize that the evolution of mankind seeded by those who dominate the cosmos has already come to fruition. Indeed, through this fucking, we will seat ourselves atop the throne of existence, we will reach the pinaccle and it'll all be thanks to your asshole being penetrated in the most unimaginable way possible by my penis. Most likely, we will end the universe, but that's all fine, as long as I fuck you and you know it's ME that's fucking you. You fucking Tamamofag.</br>  What makes a good request? because Ive seen some of these requests here for months and they haven't been touched.  Requesting Pitz doing something adorable like balancing on a beach ball, please  <br>True. It's risky but it's something we've all done.</br>  <br><br>Something that allows a little bit of creative freedom. And something that doesn't sound like begging.</br></br>  <br><br>Nah, she's from CCC, completely different character</br></br>  <a href="http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1435571649441.webm" target="_blank">http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1435571649441<wbr>.webm</wbr></a><br>Lan dressed up as a sexy doggirl doing her wan</br>  <br>You say that and I think fusion requests give that but theirs multiple fusion requests that haven't been touched in months so I don't get that.</br>  <br>I want to know this too and I've had several requests done in the past few months over the guy requesting lewds for those cat girls from Tank Police</br>  Going to try again. I was hoping that maybe somebody could please make some hair for Haruno. I've provided a reference of her, and some hair of another character from the same series in the same format. Thanks for considering. <br>http://imgur.com/NwtfVql</br>  <br>Fusion requests are way too specific. There's some creative freedom to them, yes, but I think they'll feel limited, in fact they're much too demanding of the artist.</br>  Requesting Garada K7 and Doublas M2 from Robot Girls Z (left) commiserating with Garada K7 and Doublas M2 from Mazinger Otome (right) over losing to the Mazinger heroes for the quadrillionth time.<br><br> Hard mode: Include their original mecha-beast forms looming in the background. </br></br>  <br>Lewd.</br>  Back to my computer after one week.  <br>That looks really...weird.</br>  <br>Those thighs are far too large for that girl</br>  <br>Nice blog faggot.</br>  <br>Tatsumaki looks like 2 completely different drawings. It's like she's part centaur but without the back legs.</br>  <br> Still won't draw my waifu with big tits, sweaty and a big butt. </br>  <br>Quick! Find the pose he copied this from</br>  <br>Smurf don't copy a sitting pose into a standing character<br><br>C'mon man this is basic stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>No one cares.</br>  <br> how to fail basic anatomy 101 </br>  <br><br>  Not liking big thighs </br></br>  <br> i-it was intentional guys I-I swear! </br>  <br>Her right arm seems misplaced</br>  <br>It's not that I don't like big thighs, it's just that Tatsumaki doesn't have those and it doesn't look right with that tiny body of hers.</br>  <br>you'd be hardpressed to find a single anatomically correct thing on that picture.</br>  <br>Thank you Mei, I really appreciate it.<br><br><br><br><br>Thank you for the kind words, I wish you good luck as well.<br><br><br><br><br><br>yeah, I was aware of this last time, I made the changes then and I did make the changes this time as well, if you click on the links they don't have water marks on the pixels themselves. you may remove them if you wish.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I only made this post because Meifag requested it, and I intend to honor that request regardless of any criticism. I already expected it.<br><br>I don't know nor I care to know what particular thing motivated you to post such things. <br><br>say what you will, I did honest hard work in these threads. I DARE you to be a namefag, voice your own opinions and own your mistakes, let's see how everyone treats you for being yourself. <br><br>think of any excuses that may comfort you behind your nameless post, I'm moving on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Requesting Sawyer shooting a Walther PPK with an attached silencer.<br><br>http://www.imfdb.org/images/c/c5/Wa<wbr>ltherppk32acp.jpg<br>http://www.imfdb.org/images/e/ec/Wa<wbr>ltherPPKSuppressed.jpg<br>http://www.imfdb.org/images/f/f7/Li<wbr>vday-ppk4.jpg</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Is this a maymay.</br>  <br>stop trying to defend yourself smurf.</br>  <br>Oh it's certainly not THAT bad.<br>The right leg just looks kind of odd is all.</br></br>  <br>stop shitposting.</br>  <br>The anatomy is just wrong though.<br>Both of her thighs and lower legs have the same bone length, which is not correct. The thigh is about 20% longer than the lower leg.<br>Her right foot is incredibly small and is at a weird angle.<br>Her thighs don't feel connected to her torso either, if her thighs are in that position, the upper body should be compensating to maintain balance. Right now, it feels like it was gingerly placed on top of the hip instead of being connected with it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> just te leg <br>the breasts connect wrong and randomly<br>her right breast should be smaller yet its somehow larger.<br>arms are way too long<br>legs make no sense on that body and don't connect there, likewise fucks up the torso<br>head is actually shifted left halfway up<br>those fucking legs<br><br>its fucked beyond belief.<br><br>stop defending yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The thigh is about 20% longer than the lower leg. <br>Idealized size.<br>  is at a weird angle. <br>Not really. As for the feet size, it's mainly just because of the big thighs.<br><br><br>Anyway, verified the anatomy and pose before beginning it, don't really intend to talk about it or change anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And here's Smurf just proving he's just being a child. Outright denying any criticism.</br>  <br> I'm just going to ignore all the useful criticism people have given me <br>Geez no wonder people don't like you</br></br>  <br>Gonna be honest, I think they're kinda right.<br>I mean, some of them are being dicks about it, but her anatomy doesn't really look right at all.<br><br>Nobody is telling you to redo it, but you should keep it in mind.<br>It's not to say that you didn't put a lot of detail into the image.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>good to see you back Smurf.</br>  <br>This is why you suck.</br>  Requesting genderbent Vandread characters please.  <br> verified the anatomy <br>How did you go about doing this?</br></br>  <br>Did you verify it in some magical way that is truly 100% correct? Because it's not correct.</br>  <br>There are times when you're looking for criticism and others where you aren't, just deal with it.</br>  <br>You are really not helping your case, dude. At all.</br>  <br> not lewd <br> cute girl(s) <br> not too much shit <br> not just 'draw my waifu do whatever' <br> not a gigantic faggot </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>You may not have been looking for criticism, but a good artist would keep the feedback in mind anyway.</br>  <br><br>this<br>ideally you should have said something along the lines of "thanks for the advice guys, ill keep it in mind"<br>anyone who would pursue you after that would be made out to be an asshole</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're not doing yourself any favors by continuing bad habits and mistakes that have been pointed out.</br>  <br>You're acting like I said something terrible. It was honest advice, although I admit I probably would have said "just go" instead of "fucking leave already" if I hadn't been behind muh anon shield.<br><br>You're already known for being a little too promotional and this isn't helping. You are a cool guy, but you're deaf to criticism ("It'll look good when I'm done!") and you're definitely barking up the wrong tree if you're trying to get patreon support and a following out of /a/. <br><br>I did try to tell you this in your stream 3 weeks ago but all you had was excuses "No I totally did construction it's right!" and panicked when someone (me maybe? I forget) talked about their own stream in your chat.<br><br>I do wish you the best. Try facebook or Devart. You do cute-not-lewd things so you'll fit right in, and no big bad meanies will be able to anonymously shitpost you.<br><br><br>Ayo Smurf while I'm namefagging<br><br>You may wish to do some studies instead of referencing anime stuff, it helps in the long run<br><br>But I'm not exactly professional myself and like you said you didn't ask for criticism so feel free to ignore me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus christ. This is autistic.</br>  <br>I love when people think they're important enough and are worth something enough to make posts like these.</br>  <br>Audere confirmed for being a cunt</br>  We are so doomed. THANKS DAIZ  <br>Will fansubbing alive again because Funimation killed Summer 2015?</br>  <br> No Symphogear <br>Fuck this shit I don't want Commeme</br></br>  Will they also censor NSFW contents besides subbing them too?  <br>I can't believe I'm actually saying I wish CR picked them up instead.</br>  <br>Will people stop posting the same damn thread over and over? We get it, you hate Funi. Now stop.</br>  Gross.  <br>Funi shill fuck off.</br>  <br> Fuck this shit I don't want Commeme <br><br>dude I want it but it would be a licensing nightmare and they're not gonna start on season 3</br></br></br>  <br> Gangsta <br>Expected, but..fuck.<br> Akagami <br>FUCK.<br> Prison School <br>FUUUUCK.<br> Ranpo Kitan <br>Fuuuuuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   No cute girls on sight <br>BASED FUNIMATION</br>   Bikini Warrior <br>They have some balls.</br>  <br><br>Can't you just wait for fansubs?</br></br>  <br>fuck off funifag</br>  The question is which shows aren't CR or Funi and we will have to wait a month for each episode.   two shows left <br>Shit. I thought Gakkou Gurashi and Monster Musume were off the hook. CR please.</br>  <br> fuck off <br><br>Go back to Reddit and get a better meme</br></br></br>  <br>That's not the entire season.</br>  <br>I think HS just directly rips the Funi and CR subs anyway.<br><br>I wonder which will scoop up One Punch Man.</br></br></br>  <br>Sore ga Seiyuu is the only thing they've licensed that I was thinking of picking up.</br>  <br>The trouble is that being licensed by funi basically destroys good discussion here, considering that nobody except the people watching the first release of the show discuss it, and nobody with any sense will watch funi.</br>  It's fine fansubs will save us like Vivid with Kekkai Sensen, they are not behind a week at all, it's fine.   and nobody with any sense will watch funi. <br><br>So 90% of modern /a/ will watch it.</br></br>  Might help me manage my schedule better if the fansubs are a few days late  I already have terminal eyecancer from Re Kan and SBR so whatever.  <br><br>Why are fansubs so lazy nowadays? FFF, Commie, Vivid, they all release late.</br></br>  <br>Hopefully CR can do it instead? They started Jojo at part 3 after all</br>  <br> a week <br><br>More like 10days by now.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't really care, I'll be watching HS's releases anyway.</br>  <br>Meanwhile on CR<br> Rokka no Yuusha <br> Jitsu wa Watashi wa <br> Charlotte <br> Durarara <br> Classroom Crisis </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure they are going to simulcast the censored version of Shimoneta.<br><br><br>The remaining leftovers are mostly sequels or shorts though.<br><br><br>Vivid's usual editor for Kekkai Sensen is apparently sick or something.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Vivid's OnS release was pretty punctual.</br>  <br> 4 shows of the 8 im watching will be on shitty funi stream <br>What the fuck?</br></br>  <br>Because why sub yourself when you can just rip from paid sources?</br>   Nothing looks interesting besides Himouto anyway <br><br>For once I'm thankful for my shit taste.</br></br>  <br> FFF is on episode 5 of Oregairu S2 </br>  <br>That's exactly the problem. There are too many low-effort shitposting casuals here nowadays.</br>  <br>Kind of makes all the outrage at commie being one day late look silly</br>  Who will do symphogear, gakkou, nonnon and illya?  <br>How can you like this garbage?</br>  FUCK  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127366046 <br>wrong board anon, let me help you<br/></br>  <br>I will watch it cause there won't be a fucking alternative.</br>  <br>CR gets all the moe stuff, Funi gets all the action stuff</br>  <br>I think you mean<br><br/></br></br>   Sore ga Seiyuu <br> Bikini Warriors <br> Prison School <br>That's okay, I was planning on waiting months on fansubs anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>At least DameDesuYo has already committed to Gakkou Gurashi. They may be not the best subgroup as far as quality goes, but at least they care about their output.<br><br><br>I'm pretty sure it's a /tv/ meme.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Non Non Biyori <br> Working!!! <br>CR is saving anime.</br></br></br>  <br>he's a disgusting hetfag that's why</br>  <br><br>Why haven't they dropped it yet? Anyone with sense would just watch commie.</br></br>  <br>If you're too much of an impatient autist to wait a couple days for a much better release, you can get the fuck off my /a/.</br>  <br>Is this confirmed? I checked their site a minute ago and didn't see any of those except Jitsu wa</br>  <br> DameDesuYo <br><br>Neat, I hope they memesub it like they did with Punch Line.<br><br><br>FFF is UTW-lite, they have some hardcore fanboys out there (and in here) that will wait and download anything by them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Only watching 8 shows <br> Knowing what you're going to watch before a season hits </br></br>  <br>But the entire point of anime is the shitposting threads, and those die down a few days after airing at most</br>  <br> watching a Commie certified meme release <br>Sometimes they can do a good job, but when they meme it up, they really go all out with how shit they make it.</br></br>  <br> is for yurifags</br>  <br><br>Yahari is full of memes, I don't see the problem.</br></br>  <br>You are fucking kidding me.</br>  <br>Of course I don't know every show I'll watch. I'll pick up 1 or 2 and drop some.</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  Soooo, what's the problem with Funi? i never really liked their dubs, but besides for that, what's the big deal?  <br>I'm not seeing<br> Charlotte <br> God Eater <br> Rokka <br> Gate <br> Tora <br>On OP's pic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can you leave the board now, thanks.</br>  <br>Prison school and maybe the show with 200 camera on the Funimation line-up. The 2 unknown shows might be ones I picked up though.</br>  View -&gt; Renderer Settings -&gt; Output Range -&gt; set to 16 - 235 for Funi rips. Pretty sure it's even easier to do with MadVR, without dimming the picture. Not saying I like Funi, but there are ways to fix the video quality.  <br>It's not out. How should I know if I like it?</br>  <br>What about the shitty looking subs?</br>  <br>Still have two slots left.</br>  <br>Good thing they're only picking up the shitty ones.</br>  <br>The picture quality is awful.</br>   prison school <br> funi picking up an ecchi show <br>Why do they fucking bother?</br></br>  <br>The colors are not the only problem, you can't fix particles and shit.<br>Also the bigger problem is their retarded typesetting and translation.</br></br>  <br> bloated filesizes <br> hardcoded subs <br> fucked up colors <br> the only way to fix said fucked up colors requires you edit your media player, and even then, it only works on one such player <br>And that's off the top of my head.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fix them yourself or stop having autism?</br>  hmmm let's see<br>Starting from the top left <br> shonenshit <br> shonenshit <br> memeshit <br> just shit <br> good but QUALITY all over the place <br> good if BONES won't fuck it up <br> might be good <br> ecchi shit <br> fujo shit <br> harem shit <br> ecchi "comedy" shit <br> potential aots <br> gary stu garbage <br> fujo shit <br> might be fun <br> ecchi shit, probably massively overrated by the fanbase  <br> might be good <br> might be good <br>Not that much of a loss</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And the fucking UNIVERSAL jewshit normalfag garbage logo</br>  <br> or stop having autism <br><br>Do you not realize where we are? That was never an option</br></br></br>  <br> Vivid's usual editor for Kekkai Sensen is apparently sick or something. <br>Can he get less sick?</br></br>  <br> fix hardcoded subs <br><br>Are you really this retarded?</br></br></br>  <br>Symphogear</br>  <br>Their rips look like shit.</br>  <br>Fix hardsubs?</br>  <br> he didn't see there are at least 5 new shows with cute girls </br>  <br>who do i have to fist for subs?</br>   bwah bwah funimation suxxx OH! horriblesubs is out guise! <br><br>Stop crying and find excuses to shitpost already, not even you guys care enough about this.</br></br>  <br>Vivid normally isn't this late. They have a reasonable release schedule for the quality they put out. <br><br>FFF I've lost respect for over the years. They delay projects for idiotic reasons, rage at people asking for updates, and the quality of their releases has also degraded considerably (I find far more errors now than I did even last year).<br><br>Commie has always been terrible.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not a big deal. It is a 5 minute show.</br>  <br>I care. I can't stand Funi hardsubs.</br>  <br>The tumblrite who translates Symphogear shit, was his name Zoid?</br>  <br> implying there is a single show without cute girls </br>  <br>why is it garbage?</br>  <br> typesetting <br>It's shit, yeah.<br><br> translation <br>I remember most Funirips I've watched having passable scripts. Nourin was an abomination, and there were the issues with Rolling Girls 5 &amp; 6, but besides that, they're not much different than CR.</br></br></br></br></br>   Run <br> Lala <br> Momo <br> Mea <br> Nana <br> Haruno <br> Saki <br> Rin <br> Kyouko <br> Mikan <br> Celine <br> Tearju <br> Mikado <br> Every other sexy babe I didn't mention <br><br>Who is best girl and why is it King Deviluke?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lala is best Girl, any one else is second-tier.</br>  King Deviluke is too yandere for me, he spends a whole episode trying to ntr Lala, best girl is indisputably Kotegawa, although most of them are great.  is the new season out yet?<br>is it uncensored on atx or are they being jews like last time?<br>if so, when are the BDs gonna be out?</br></br>  <br>New season is coming out in July anon, you're welcome.

Otherwise excellent teir-rates anon.</br>  I can't rate the girls in tiers. Some of them I really wanna devour because of how perfect their bodies are like Kotegawa and Kyouko and some of them I want to dominate like Mikan and Nana.

I feel like a gynecologist looking at a vagina whenever I see her nekkid.  What exactly makes Nemesis so great?<br><br>Is it because she's a loli who can grow bigger when she wants? Is it because she's delicious brown? Is it because she's so dominant in a series so full of beta women? Is it because she's a total sadist? Is it because she can make Momo so flustered?

I'm going to marry Ruri~  Raikiri the Sudden Shower looks like a Digimon  RARE CARDO  <br>I was about to say something by sheer reflex but... yeah, he really does. Maybe a tad too asymmetrical, though.</br>  <br> 53, we see Yuzu in her childhood <br> 62, we see Yuzu with her hair down <br>Just a few more episodes until a Yuya and Yuzu childhood flashback!</br></br></br>   Yuzu has/is getting a new outfit <br>Welp the OP is out of date now.</br>  <br><br><br>http://digimon.wikia.com/wiki/Ravem<wbr>on</wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>AAH IMA</br></br>  monosubs fucking when. tired of seeing spoilers every week.  <br><br>Just use tumblrsubs</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WoR<wbr>Dl_PRIqU</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Yep...they're definitely the Rangers.</br></br>  <br>Monosubs are usually 2-3 days after the raws, or 1-2 days after the speed subs by ruSUBan. <br><br>You can't avoid the spoilers, because Japanese doesn't believe in not spoiling their children's cartoons.</br></br></br>  <br>His PC case is broke, so unless he got a new one it's gonna be awhile.</br>  <br>do they have colored QUALITY summons like monosubs?</br>  <br><br>This episode doesn't even have a real duel</br></br>  <br>Yes it does, the duel of hearts between Yuzu.wav and Banana.wav.</br>  <br>The case shouldn't be a big problem, he said that everything still works.</br>  <br><br>I actually find the release of rusuban quite decent in terms of quality.

Taking a shower offscreen is evil and immoral these days?</br>  <br>Last week they screwed up too and used the 406p raw instead of the 720p. It's nice that they also put up a seperate sub file though</br>  <br>This is rather tame for fanservice.</br>  <br><br>I always get the raw to go with the soft sub from rusuban.

And now he's having hallucinations about her.  <br>I've never expected such straight-up straightfaggotry from a Yu-Gi-Oh MC.

No one-sided round. 8/10  <br>Yuzu, stop cheating on the polls.</br>  Card game on rollercoaster in volcanic simulation theme park proto-type!  <br>i literally love yuya but it's a tossup between yusei and yami for me<br> and i'm the only person who voted yami <br>i still believe in your last pathetic cards pharaohman</br> </br></br>  <br>Like Yuma and Alit, do the antagonist ended up falling in love with Rebecca?<br><br>If the blonde is Rebecca, that is.</br></br></br>  <br> Surprised by that Yuya has the most votes </br>  <br>wait WHAT<br>kek bravo bot anon</br></br>  <br>Holyshit it is real volcano. Faker is a pussy. Kaiba makes goat area.</br>  <br>Reminder people in this thread want Yuzu/Yugo to stay longer with each other, although I am very curious to see how Yuya interaction with Rin could be</br>  <br>If Yuya met Rin after the end of Synchro Arc and the arc ends with Yuya absorbing Yugo, there will be an uncomfortable sort of atmosphere between Yuya and Rin.<br><br>Or maybe the moment Yuya sees Rin the 'Inner Yugo' is activated and Yuya enters Playboy Mode like he did against Mieru.</br></br></br>  So, in yugioh world, strong people are those who can either : Pull of combo no-one thought about, posses strong cards, have strong drawing skill. In Zexal Kaito establish this against Jinlong and saying something like strong duelist guide their cards. In GX manga, Judai's luck affect even his opponent's draw (that Angel almost defeat him if she draw a monster card). <br><br>Then we have Jounouchi who, well, gamble. That's why Kaiba dissed him so hard. But I do love it when he and Valor beat the shit out of each other. We were like "is this a card game anymore?"

I wonder if hopping dimensions has had anything to do with it or it's simply the thirst for Yuzu overwhelming all other feelings.</br>  <br>personally I'm hoping for edge mode reveal and then Yuzu curing it by hugs and  hand holding. </br>  <br>She's one of the few, now try prominent characters that show up consistently. <br><br>She saw it when he dueled Ryouzanpaku.<br><br>Hmmm</br></br></br></br></br>  Academia invasion when?  <br>Arc-V is the anti-Zexal<br> No lewds <br> Likeable protagonist <br> Important female lead <br> Several relevant females <br> Parents that actually matter <br> Rival with little screentime <br> Uses several summon methods instead of BUY XYZ <br> Uses tons of references to previous series instead of pretending it doesn't exist <br> Side-characters actually do stuff and are interesting <br> Social commentary </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She saw it when he dueled Ryouzanpaku. <br><br>That was just a hint of it. That wasn't full DARK AURA YUYA</br></br></br>    <br>She wont see it either because he'll go EGAO 2, Bright Eyes Yugo/Yuto addition.</br>  <br>I just noticed the figure in the poster is suposed to be an Obelisk Force</br>  <br>I think it was this one:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Sfu<wbr>JChScFcU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Well, it sorta was, I mean, he had the crazy eyes and hair and everything, unless you only count the extra edge mode he got when he first summoned OERD as the true Yami Yuya.</br>  <br> dat Asuka and Aki <br><br>Hnnnnng<br><br>Is there a universal law where YGO girls have to be fucking amazing?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>YES thank you!</br>  <br>So they've invaded Synchro before? Leo did mention something about not wanting to deploy more forces to Synchro until were 100% done with XYZ, maybe they sent some smaller forces that were repelled? The invasion might even have been a justification for the pseudo fascist classist thing they've got going on.</br>  <br>The posters were made by Yuzu and Yugo (probably Yuzu since Yugo is quasi-illiterate)</br>  <br>Yuzu and Yugo were the ones who made the posters, and they know what Obelisk look like from encountering them during the Battle Royale. The average Synchro citizen has no idea about different dimensions and thinks the idea of dimensional invaders is silly.</br>  <br><br><br>Ah, I se, thanks. So Yugo and Yuzu are like the crazy guy in the corner with the "Jesus is coming" sign, and Jean Mitchell is just an asshole that doesn't even need propaganda to justify his police state.</br></br></br>  <br>I've always wondered how Domino City got as terrible as it was. I'm sure Kaiba doesn't care, but where is everyone else at that lets that shit happen.</br>  <br>Man, Asuka is top fucking tier when she's in clothes that arent ugly like the Obelisk Blue girls uniform</br>  Do you take responsibility?  <br>We don't know how many, if any, characters from DM and GX might have died in the unspecified timeskip between series and/or on Zero Reverse. In any case given that Jack was Kingu and that he didn't have to duel Yugi for the title as far as we know is pretty telling of the fact that the DM characters weren't really influential anymore (Not that a Yugi, being merely a champion game player, even if that game is as popular as both kinds of football puth together in our world, could have stopped the onset of the dystopia, as you said, Kaiba wouldn't have cared and he's the only one who realistically could have done something about it)</br>  <br>Of course it's real! He created a themepark of death just to try and kill Yugi.<br><br> Though I think it just maybe solid vision with mass though </br></br></br>  <br>BATHTIME!</br>  <br><br>ultra kek</br></br>  <br>Yes. Then I go and take responsibility for the other Ruris too.</br>  <br> No lewds <br>Top kek.</br></br>  <br>You really want those Dragon dicks up your ass don't you?</br>  <br>Well KaibaCorp is the one that made Duel Runners and Ushio was in DM as a high school bully. So I'd imagine everyone in DM is still alive.</br>    <br> No lewds <br>Top kek.</br></br>  <br>Yugi may have well retired in those 20+ years and have assented to legendary duelist status. As for Kaiba, Yliaster coukd have forced him or Mokuba out of KC or killed them to take full control of the company and wrap it to what it became.</br>  <br> didn't change the bracelet <br>1/10</br></br>  <br>Are you kidding? You can learn everything you need to know in life by playing card games! At least, that's what Crow taught me.</br>  <br>Holy fuck I shit you not I was so focused on the yuzus It took me fucking 5 minutes to notice what was behind her.</br>    <br>Ushio is an exception and a temporal anomaly. Some suspect him to be immortal as a result of his penalty game.</br>  <br>Also, Zexal was hated in the west and loved in Japan, while Arc-V is loved in the west and- what do the Japanese think of Arc-V?<br>Is it more popular than Zexal?</br></br>  <br>japanese have bad taste</br>  <br>Well his name was on a list in GX too with the whole Nightshroud/Domino City stuff.</br>  <br>Japan seems to like Arc-V quite a lot. I think they just like YGO man.</br>  <br> Shun <br>Every revolutionary time</br></br>  <br> that determined for cock Yuzu </br>   sexualizing the yuzu   <br>Taking the sleeves off of the obelisk blue uniform was a stupid idea.</br>  <br>I approved of the attempt at bare upper arm service, but it didnt work out</br>  <br>I prefer that before we get DMG sexualization again. Unless they use another monster of course, but stop with the fagging of DM things.</br>  <br>Dark Magician Girl legs in good animation in the waifufag times. Oh yes.</br>  <br> &gt;sexualizing the yuzu <br>kek</br></br>  <br>anon yuya is going to be jealous</br>  <br>And I would appreciate it if it wasn't the fact that she literally has some kind of apparition in every Yu-Gi-Oh! Seasons, DM being her first appearance, GX and that Duel Spirit Monster Day, 5Ds with that figure Carly got and the movie, and ZEXAL with the stones, and probably she will have some type of appearance in Arc-V. Not counting the many figures she has plus the new one.<br>I don't say that is bad, she is likeable, but it's obvious the really nostalgia bait for DM, and DMG is with Atem one of the most noteable things in there, so instead of that I will really prefer have things from other seasons, hell I'll take even ZEXAL even if it was a big punch of balloliness.</br></br>  <br>Woah nigga das lewd.</br>  <br>All it took was sealing Yoshida away into the Zexal Manga.<br>He needs a new containment unit</br></br>   Serena will never be loved by her Yuu.    miera disappointed that yuya was "her fated person" <br>sis get better opinions</br>  <br>Man, she's going to be so fucking happy when she sees Yuya duel JAKKU</br>  <br>Good she has her boy harem of Reiji, Shun, and Sawatari now.</br>  <br>She's gonna be so disappointed when he gets his asshole ripped apart so hard by the Kingu that he turns gay and wants to start sucking his dick for how amazing he is.</br>  <br>Nah, Yuya's going to be I WANT TO RESTORE THAT SMILE.</br>  <br>And the Kingu is gonna be all "I still don't care."</br>   http://ygorganization.com/awildbel<wbr>ialappears/</wbr> <br><br>Hot Red Dragon Archfind Belial confirmed for HSR, and we get a mysterious monster that's probably the third theme.<br>We ain't getting Goyos</br></br></br>  I'm at the part where Yubel possesses Napoleon's autistic kid, and I'm not gonna lie, I miss Edo, I miss his quest to find the D.  <br>Edo is clearly Reiji's grandfather. <br><br> Edo: D <br> Leo: D/D <br> Reiji: D/D/D <br><br>Just look at the two, they're related.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whether you like it not Yuya will make him EGAO soon enough</br>  <br>Bless your sweet innocent heart. Keep watching.</br>  <br> no Speedroids <br> no Goyo <br> Psychic shit <br><br>The fuck are you doing Konami really...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I vote Arc-V manga. Something something equivalent exchange.</br>  <br>Leo having a banished focus deck when?</br>  <br><br>I appreciate the effort on these Yuzu edits but the anatomy is really fucking with me.</br></br>  <br> no Speedroids  <br>But they are right fucking there</br></br>  I want to rewatch Protag vs Rival duels (not just the main rivals) DM-Zexal. Which single duels vs each rival are the best (e.g. which Yugi vs Kaiba duel was the best)?  <br>You know this whole set is about 40 synchro slots long right?</br>  <br> no Speedroids <br>How can someone be this retarded?</br></br>  <br><br> Yugi vs Kaiba <br>I'd say their duel in duelist kingdom, but since it goes by DK rules I'm gonna say their Battle City Semi Final battle<br> Judai vs Kaiser <br>Their final duel when Kaiser graduates<br> Yusei vs Jack <br>Their final duel<br> Yuma vs Kaito <br>Their first duel<br> Yuya vs Reiji <br>Their duel at the end of Battle Royale</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No surprises there. Goyo Guardian is still banned in OCG. There's no way Japan would release superior versions of Goyos before unbanning the vanilla Goyo.<br><br>Makes me wonder why the anime shills Goyos in the first place though</br></br></br></br>  <br> but since it goes by DK rules I'm gonna say their Battle City Semi Final battle <br>I re-watched that the other day, shit was so cash. DM era duels could be obscenely long, but that one made it work, all the back and forth and Kaiba development.</br></br>  <br><br>You need to stop posting this filth.</br></br>  <br>You're right, we need some chubby Ruri</br>  <br><br>The color needs to be toned down a little more</br></br>  <br>Yeah. Of course there are groups who like one or two series more than the others, but in general there's a lot of love for all the series in nippon.</br>  Performapals are so fucking fun.<br>Joker, Secondonkey and Wizard give the deck ridiculous search power.<br>And Secondonkey is a lot easier to recycle than Joker with Bowhopper</br></br>  <br>This is starting to get out of hand. Being willing to ditch your comrades in a place like a prison for the sake of a waifu is a thing antagonists do, Yuya.</br>  <br>I'd imagine Ruri's hair will be a tad different than the inverted colors, it's just odd seeing piss yellow and diarrhea brown. Also isn't Rin's hair a different shade of green slightly too?</br>  <br> Only one of those three actually got their guy </br>  This is not Meshi  <br>All of them have slightly lighter colors than what you see in the inversed image. The designers will probably exercise their artistic freedom to make Ruri's hair a bit more yellow than inverse Serena, but not by that much.</br>  <br>Does Aki have a motherfucking whip behind her back? Im  not opposed to it <br>Wish the artist would do Yuzu in this style, its qt</br></br>  Did we already get speculation from the episode out of our system already?  <br>Well there was a couple shades/filters edited in to show it was a flashback, so Rin's hair might be darker than it actually looks like.</br>  <br><br>Well you need to inverse the brightness but otherwise the hair color is pretty much exactly the inverted color</br></br>  <br>This is not Egao</br>  <br>i paused at the miera duel for now because i couldn't handle yuya<br>whatever evil force animated that episode must have wanted to torture teenage girls everywhere</br></br>  <br><br><br>This is my guess based on what we've got, but they'll probably just do something that looks good.</br></br></br>  <br>Ruriographer?</br>  <br> Invuris </br>  <br>Yuya is one cute kid.</br>  <br> professional ruri graphing <br>How is this marvelous branch of science called?<br>Where can I study it?</br></br></br>  <br> In Heartland. </br>  <br>understatement of the century</br>  <br> yfw Asuka is teaching people at Academia out of her annoyance </br>  <br>Serena's hair seems to vary.

I like to think he just dueled while hopping around and interacting with his monsters while everybody just wondered what the fuck was he doing</br>  <br> not overlaying all the Ruris at once </br>  <br>No, it requires that you overlay Yuzu, Serena, and Rin to construct the Imouto Network to XYZ summon Ruri like true RuriRaptors.</br>  What are ideas for a new summoning method as Arc-V obviously isn't the last anime?  The XYZ arc is going to deal with the Barians again, because XYZ got genocided and now the ghosts are FUCKING PISSED  <br>Blue Eyes Summoning Dragon</br>  <br>Multiplying levels summoning</br>  <br>A summoning method called Duplicate.<br><br> tribute a monster with a level <br> summon from your extra deck two duplication monsters that add up to the monster that was tributed </br></br></br></br>  <br> overlayed Ruri is a brunette </br>  <br>We had this discussion awhile back with someone mentioning Red cards with using graveyard/banished or some shit as material.</br>  <br> and now the ghosts are FUCKING PISSED <br><br>One angry ghost is enough.</br></br></br>  <br>Sequence summon<br>Shuffle a level 2, 3 and 4 monster to sequence summon a level 5 sequence monster.<br>There are also reverse sequence monsterss, and incredibly overpowered synchro-sequence monsters and Rank Sequence Monsters.</br></br></br>    <br/>  <br>Alchemy Monsters<br>Uses monsters/cards of specific TYPE (like, two earth and one light, or one dark one spell, etc) to create monsters of a new element.</br></br>  <br><br>I like these.</br></br>  <br>ow my heart</br>  <br>Holy shit she's cute as hell.</br>  <br>OCG: Busou Summon/TCG: Armament Summoning<br><br>It involves using a Monster or Magic that somehow links or is summoned by your LP count. This is represented in the anime by the duelist getting armor representing the monster so they can start fist-fighting the opponents monster or the opponent themselves directly</br></br></br>  <br>This actually sounds like a really good idea except it sounds a lot like Contact Fusion mixed with Rituals</br>  <br>Already have fusion for that.</br>  <br>Funny thing if Konami actually has a "Design the Ruri" Contest and the winner who has the design closest to that of the actual Ruri gets a fully blinged out RaidRaptor.dek complete with extra and a RaidRaptor playmat.</br>  <br><br>I figured there probably were fusions like that, but I'm sure there are probably fusions with similar requirements to some synchros. just give the final monster a brand new element/attribute assignment and then you have the built-in requirement for new support and immunity to old shit<br>besides there are only so many things you can use that don't just wind up being Math Summons.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I tried. Better?</br></br>  <br>Sign me up.</br>  What if it turns out Ruri isn't blonde  <br>What is it turns out that Ruri is obese?</br>  <br>Please. This is anime</br>  <br>deepest lore</br>  <br>Yes.</br>   Reiji will never BTFO Yuya with triple D dragon <br> Yuya doesn't have regular Odd Eyes anymore to use Saber Dragon and attempt a comeback only to end in him being BTFO'd by Reiji once more </br>  <br>Explain the fat ugly blob that is Mieru then.</br>  <br>pencil thin and malnourished from eating pocky all the time?</br>  currently at the part where shun's about to whip 3 students down at once. i have the most terrible feeling that later on he's going to job to reiji which i hope isn't true<br>also i see right through you shun "kurosaki"</br>  Is it just me or is Yuya somewhat like TouMAN?<br><br>I mean in the Kachidoki episodes, you could have him say 'You're not living your life correctly!' Also, he has a magic loli and a tsundere (to some degree, as Yuzu is deredere rather than tsuntsun) as people with crushes on him, and has an evil black dragon in his soul?</br></br>  <br>Take that shit back nigga</br>  Yuya committed a grave sin in episode 62, not only did he squander an opportunity to make many people egao, not only did he admit to using duels for purposes besides egao, he even tried to justify his sin with "muh Yuzu" rather than realize his mistake and apologize to Enjoy. Yuya, what happened? You were supposed to bring egaos to everyone's faces  <br> i have the most terrible feeling that later on he's going to job to reiji <br><br>Nah, they're going to become NEETcave buddies.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah he's pretty much TouMAN actually.</br>  <br>I see right through you too, "Ichigo".<br><br> Just joking, this is actually a picture of Ruri. </br></br></br>  <br> with asuka <br>You trying to get even worse?</br></br>  <br>Who isn't going to job to Reiji besides maybe Leo? <br><br>Shun is already his NEET cave buddy, they hung out forever in that fucking NEET cave. Kind of funny the only three characters that have been in there, including Reiji, have all been paired with Serena. She is the NEET Queen.</br></br></br>  <br>To tell the truth I kinda of thought of him a little like Shirou or Saber.</br>  <br>He didn't create it, he revolutionized it by actually jumping around and doing acrobatic stunts and shit.<br><br>Pay attention.</br></br></br>  <br> you are now aware that she has the most wins from a female duelist in all the series not even including her beating 31 random jobbers </br>  <br> She is the NEET Queen. <br><br>Pretty much.</br></br></br>  <br>He didn't make it, originally action duels was all about feats of strength, he made it more about style</br>  <br> Triple D <br>Who are you? 4K Media?</br></br>  <br>If it weren't for Rio she'd have the worst win/loss ratio too.</br>  <br><br>Touman is in the pictures in the end credits.</br></br>  HANASE MONSTAH  <br>Reira gets paired with Serena?</br>  <br>he's not touman because unlike touman yuya is flawless</br>  <br><br>I want her to be my NEET Queen. <br><br>I think he meant Reiji, Shun, and Sawatari.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If he really was flawless, he'd be static</br>  <br>Hanase</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>Actually she's on pair with most of them around 50%, and most Zexal girls are shit at dueling one of them was 0-7.</br>  <br>It's Hanate.</br>  <br> yuya is flawless <br><br>Are we watching the same show?</br></br></br>  <br> Yuya <br> flawless <br> Almost was willing to abandon his friends in prison just for muh Yuzu. <br><br>That's a big no for a flawless protagonist. A flawless protagonist is someone who will never entertain such thought and will manage to save everyone by himself and himself only!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess he's that anon who still haven't caught up. He thinks Yuya's flawless.</br>  <br> being this uneducated on dank memes </br>  <br>that just makes him even more lovable<br> give me a few days until i get over this yuya loving phase and think clearly </br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mkA<wbr>tpkhKJzA</wbr>  [ ]<br>He just got the lyrics wrong.</br></br>  <br>There is nothing wrong with sacrificing all your friends for the sake of your most important person.</br>  <br>Most satisfying moment in the entire franchise <br>DURAH<br>MONSTAH CAHDO</br></br></br>  <br>HANASE DURA MONSTA KADO</br>  <br>Shun didn't sacrifice any friends though. He didn't sacrifice Yuto either. In fact, he was willing to help him but Reiji was keeping a tight leash on him.<br><br>But he did sacrifice what he thinks were 'bad' people.</br></br></br>  <br>No matter how much you love Yuya, it is impossible to not see the kid has some major issues.</br>  Anyone else like how when Yuya came out of his edge mode the first thing he asked is if he beat the Obelisk Force rather than if anyone got the Knight of Duels cards away from them or if he hurt them? If Yuya could of I think he would of killed them with no remorse.  <br>Yes<br><br>There's no room for change or development in a character that's perfect from start to end.</br></br></br>  <br>I think Yuto's personality is coming out sometimes too. He starts freaking his shit a lot when Heartland is brought up, and during his duel with Reiji when Reiji knocks his ass down the stairs and starts taunting him.</br>  <br>Shun's made it clear that he's willing to do whatever it takes to get Ruri back. Including taking his friends down.</br>  Any D/D/D brothers in arms here? How goes with testing the Slime?  <br>WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU WATCHING THE HONG KONG SUBS?</br>  <br>It's good and can rogue against other decks but I get wrecked by people playing EGAO.dek.<br>I can't help but feel as if it's foreshadowing/</br></br>  <br>I think he wouldn't have attempted something as reckless as instigating a 3 vs 1 if he was in control.<br><br>How the chin dragons are associated with edge moments could have been milked for a lot of cheap angst, but I noticed that Yuya doesn't have a problem using something like OERD if he really needs to.</br></br></br>  <br>Why would you not?</br>  <br>Full form of Yuzu is Anzu.<br><br>CONFIRMED</br></br></br>  <br><br>please no</br></br>  I was out of town so I didn't get to watch the new ep with you guys when it came out.<br><br>So, is Shun confirmed Xyz Yusei now?</br></br>  <br>Well he kicks as much ass as him</br>  <br>Dude, Yusei took out like 2 guards while Shun took out like 6<br>If anything Shun kicks more ass than Yusei</br></br>  <br>No new summoning method for next series for sure <br>We have 5 already</br></br>  <br>Konami please go.</br>  <br>That pose is badass</br>  <br> Was about to duel security seriously <br> Mothers words came to his head </br></br>  <br>I have a feeling a legal Deck Master monster will be the next step. Like maybe monsters that have a benefits on the deck and hand like drawing more cards or a cheap Mill. I dunno, honestly.</br>  <br>you know they'll do it anyway though.</br>  <br>He was going to abandon his other friends for Yuzu and has hallucinations about her. Dude has something beyond major issues.</br>  <br>Whats the difference between 5 and 6?<br><br><br> to duel security seriously <br>That would have been an even worse idea though</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They could model it on MtG's commander format.<br><br>Commander always seemed like a knockoff of the deck master idea anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>Dude has obsession problems. <br>Then again, he's 14. I was obsessed with some bitch when I was 14.</br></br>  <br>Better than EGAO duel, although he did try to tell them their not here to cause a fight</br>  <br><br><br>Of course, she's his key person afterall</br></br></br>  <br> Better than EGAO duel <br>He didnt know why they wanted to arrest them, and they came to syncro dimension to make allies. Trying to defuse the situation isnt that bad an idea from his perspective, at least compared to making like Sawatari and Serena and attempt to duel them all while reinforcements flooded in.

Enemy or ally? How long will she live?</br></br></br>  <br>JOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br><br>JO!</br></br></br>  Can Rohan write "I have a stand" in someone and give them stand powers?  Kujo Josefumi has stupid hair.  <br> those hentai protagonists in the background </br>  Who is the undisputed best character in Jojo and why is it Buccellati?  Man, Johnny must've slept around a lot because nearly every male character looks like him.  so the new Kakyoin Dies will be Rohan Dies right?    <br>I don't think you believe that yourself. Even early Josuke already looked different from him despite Jojos always starting out looking like the previous one.</br>  <br>Why does she walk like a south park character?</br>  <br>Who knows, the SFX points it out too.</br>  <br>Ally</br>  <br>I don't see why not.</br>  <br>Gotta get close first</br>  <br>her stand's shit, she admits it herself<br><br>she won't be a threat to josuke</br></br></br>  <br>I bet the reason she says the user has to be the one touching the head is only because otherwise it would be Karera's hair and not the costumer's. <br><br>I'll be surprised if she doesn't turn out to have much more freedom with it outside of those situations. She might even be able to control the hair like Yukako.</br></br></br>  <br>either way, josuke can remove hair with bubbles as well</br>  <br>If you're going for  real  spoilers, I guess.<br><br>I prefer this one.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, a hair stand can't really be much of a match for S&amp;W either way. All I'm saying is that it could be a far better ability than it initially seems, and it's also always handy to have a humanoid form for your stand.</br>  <br> shit stands can't be a threat </br>    <br>Best husbando/waifu.</br>  <br>No. That's like Gappy stealing someone's Stand with Soft &amp; Wet. It's too abstract.</br>  <br>That gave me sticky fingers.</br>  <br>Why didn't Kira just wrote down the names in the Note?</br>  <br>Goddamit why are genderswapped Jojo characters so fuckable?</br>  <br>Because they're already adorable AND look like traps.</br>  Guys, what chapter did the "Get a feeling so complicated" quote come from?  <br>They just are.</br>  <br> Giorno is the worst JoJo by far <br> Female Giorno is the best by far </br></br>  <br> Giorno is the worst JoJo by far <br>Weird way to spell best.</br></br>  <br>  all of the porn and sexy pics are for the genderswapped dudes <br><br>Why is this allowed.

It was also funny</br>  <br>this video was made by /a/</br>  <br>Whats so bad about him tweeting something he likes? Literally who is joel?</br>  <br>from vinesauce</br>  <br> July 28th <br>Nope, delayed to September 22nd. You're right about the other stuff though.</br></br>  <br>The fuck is vinesauce? Just looks like some 4th tier casual vidya site like dorkly</br>  <br>are we supposed to care? there are 100 left and they really should have just translated the color scans</br>  <br>If your stand is your soul you already have it, you just aren't able to manifest it</br>  <br><br>What the actual fuck<br> I never knew that Joel tweeted my fucking video and later deleted it, what the fuck is going on?<br>Pic related , if you dont believe i made the video(all the images are fucked up because i organized my folder after the video sorry).</br> </br></br></br>  What the fuck happened to Bucciarati after he got "Killed" by King Crimson? He was dead but he wasn't?  Guise<br><br>Why didn't DIO just punch through Jotaro's spine while he was frozen after his 2 seconds passed like he did with Kakyoin?</br></br>  <br>Bruno was supposed to die there but Giorno's healing brought back his soul into his dead body slowly deteriorating.</br>  <br>He did,Jotaro had manga armor.</br>  <br>Because good guys don't die, faggot</br>  <br>He was too slow and full of himself.</br>    <br> jojo died for me after the worst part <br>I understand,but don't worry the next ones are better</br></br>  <br> JoJo died for me after i'm too pleb to read the manga </br>  <br>True but if Jotaro died then there would be no one else from stopping Dio and he would take over the world.</br>   part which could benefit the most from clear action during fights gets the least color <br> part 6 which has the clearest artstyle and straightforward fights gets fully colored </br>  <br>I'd let her roll my stones.</br>  <br>It's all fully colored, retard. All of the parts are being translated by different people, i'm just guessing the guy who did part 6 isn't a lazy cunt</br>    4 &gt; 3 &gt; 6 &gt; 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 7 &gt; 5 &gt; 8<br><br>I haven't read non-shit Vento Aureo scanlations so that's the main reason 5 is rated so low for me. <br>I also don't get the hate on part 3 besides Autism: The JoJo, enlighten me, /jojo/.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah sorry, that's what I meant. I think the people translating the color scans of part 5 translated 6, though.</br>  <br> 1&gt;7 <br> 6&gt;7 <br> 3&gt;7 </br></br></br>  <br>King Crimson had the opposite effect of Golden Experience on Bruno and instead of injecting him with life and accelerating his consciousness when it punched him, it slowed it down.</br>  <br> 3 above anything </br>  <br>  Part 8 last </br>  <br>Likely she'll be an ally but one that doesn't show up much beyond this arc.</br>  <br> 7 so low <br> 8 at the end <br> 3 so high <br> 1 above the rim of the trashcan </br></br></br></br>  <br>7 would be better if Johnny wasn't so shitty compared to Gyro.<br><br>Yeah. Punch ghost people out to fight DIO and his minions. Plus Star Platinum is one of my favorite stands. I don't get the hate.<br><br>Gappy is putting me to sleep. I can only deal with Alzheimer's Sailor running around doing fuck-all for so long.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> monster of the week handled horribly with terrible pacing  <br> Jotaro's fights being the worst of the bunch,literally just resolves things by ORAORAing harder <br> DIO turning completely retarded and the final fight being absolute horseshit <br>It's by far the worst jojo part. In every other part fights are handled way better and the MC isn't a talking brick.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him and he has shit taste in almost everything but Araki really, REALLY can't do mystery, the pacing is terrible and there's a new mystery every chapter, with no resolutions and he'll probably change his mind about the original solution so it'll make no sense.<br>Also MC is kinda boring. It's not as bad as part 5, but that at least had cool fights instead of constant joestar family techniques.</br></br>  <br> I also don't get the hate on part 3 <br>It's mostly about the uninteresting monster of the week enemies and stands. The main cast is also inferior compared to those of the subsequent parts.<br><br>Besides, older readers are probably already sick and tired of all the MUDAMUDA and ORAORA, since it's pretty much the first thing that gets you into JJBA.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 1 <br> anywhere near Trashcan <br>Puh leaze</br></br></br>  If Karera had Harvest she could rob the entire Morioh in 2 days  <br> johnny  <br> shitty </br></br>  <br> thinking part 1 is anywhere near as good as any of the other parts.  <br>Its redeeming factor is Dio throws a dog to its fiery death.</br></br>  <br>Oh. Well, dicks.</br>  <br>rip in pieces harvest, you were so interesting araki had to kill you</br>  <br>Part 1 is only above 3 honestly. It had nothing especially bad but nothing especially interesting either.</br>  <br> not liking Johnny "I will fucking murder anyone who disagrees with my path of righteousness" Joestar <br><br> thinking Gappy isn't one of the best Jojos <br><br>what the fuck is up with you</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This has to be the most retarded post I've read recently about part 8.</br>  <br> awesome introduction <br> Jojo and Dio's boyhood <br> Mansion Fight <br> Zeppeli's death <br> Bait and switch ending <br> Jonathan is general </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please explain why, unless you're too retarded of course.</br>  <br>Gay Priest used Whitesnake as another body more than he ever actually used the stand power.</br>  <br> Oh man dio sure is a cunt <br> Look at Dio continuing to be an absolute cunt <br> Why don't we make him a cunt vampire <br> Hey that dude punched a frog <br> oh no hes dead <br> yay dios dead <br> oh wait hes a head <br> end <br><br>also Jonathan is the worst fucking most bland ass jojo of them all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>3 is rated low because all Jotaro fights equal up to "i'm just gonna punch harder until it gets punched." So most of the good fights are carried by the rest of the cast. Even Dio's World's amazing fights gets soured by this in that jotaro just punches his way through rather than figuring out a way to win like every other jojo. <br><br>It breaks from the theme of other Joestars who always use their mind while jotaro uses just brute force. Even his Stands Stats are better that every other stand including the world from the start.<br><br> Jotaro vs Kakyoin <br>Just punches through emerald splash then punches more<br><br> Jotaro vs Dark Blue Moon <br>Just suddenly develops star finger and instakills enemy when trapped<br><br> Jotaro vs forever <br>Literally just does the same thing as last time<br><br> Jotaro vs Rubber Soul <br>Literally the only fight jotaro doesn't just power through. He actually used strats tactics to win like a joestar. <br><br> Jotaro vs Wheel of Fortune <br>so-so, still sorta powerhoused, but did use a little joestar trickery.<br><br> Jotaro vs enya <br>sucks up a stand that literally covers the entire town in fog somehow with only the lung capacity of a human.<br><br> Jotaro vs the sun <br>OHKO<br><br> Jotaro vs both anubis <br>Punch to win<br><br> Jotaro vs Alessi <br>7 year old physically beats up man with a stand, an axe, and beefy arms, even though Jotaro was a kind and gentle boy when he was 7.<br><br> Jotaro vs DIO <br>Punches Dio in the leg and makes him explode without being able to recover somehow.<br><br><br>Giorno is guilty of this level of asspull too, which is why he is normally rated low. But all other joestars use the enviroment, circumstance, and their minds to outsmart the enemy with the tools they have. Thats what makes their fights great.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> oh no, too many mysteries in a mystery setting <br> I can't handle monthly issues so that means the pacing is terrible <br> it also means we'll never see the resolution of the mysteries either, even though we're still years from the actual end of it <br> why can't we go back to shonen battles instead? </br></br></br></br>  <br> also Jonathan is the worst fucking most bland ass jojo of them all. <br><br>Puh leaze</br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't he just use Whitensake to tell him where the spikes were during Heavy Weather</br>  <br>You should've put 1 real one and kept the animefags guessing</br>  <br>Sometimes I feel like you guys just pull random numbers out of a hat or something when making those dumb ranking lists.</br>  <br> Giorno is guilty of this level of asspull too, which is why he is normally rated low <br>Giorno is Joseph with Cars as his stand, it's hardly his fault.</br></br>  <br> I can't handle monthly issues so that means the pacing is terrible <br>Why doesn't Araki just use The World and finish jojo while time is stopped?</br></br>  <br> monster of the week <br>Wasn't that because the volumes were released...weekly?<br> terrible pacing <br>Explain<br> Jotaro's fights being the worst <br>Besides the fight with DIO, I kinda agree there. Autists can't do much except rage harder. Remind you guys of  /a/nyone ?<br> DIO being retarded <br>Seemingly immortal vampire was too full of himself. His pride was his downfall.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Damn...those asspulls...yknow maybe I'm lovin on Part 3 more because I just recently finished the animu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because The World  Isn't real </br>  <br> Wasn't that because the volumes were released...weekly? <br>1 and 2 weren't like that, they had training arcs, exposition etc. and the characters had personal growth, but Jotaro didn't. He was born cool, which is bad for stories.</br></br>  <br>It was a request from an anon to re-add the same panels but in color.<br><br>I kinda fucked up Johnny's panel cause he got shot 3 different times during D4C.</br></br></br>  <br>Ally, swinging the death flag hard and probably moments before she drops a big info bomb.</br>  <br>I can't take this part seriously. His hair looks like the sole of a shoe.</br>  <br>1 and 2 weren't like that because there weren't enough enemies to do the MotW deal. Jotaro is pretty bland in 3 though.</br>   Alessi <br>As Polnareff spent almost the entire arc showing, the mind doesn't regress instantly. Jotaro still had his aggressive attitude from being a 17 year old. <br><br> DIO <br>DIO can't recover because re-read Shooting DIO and the fight as a whole.</br></br></br></br>  <br>for<br><br><br><br>somehow forgot to quote.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But there could have, that's the point. I was kinda expecting to see endless lists of killers turned vampires.</br>  I can't get over how good High Dio looks in the anime. Seriously they nailed his design.  <br>If only their regular DIO was a little better</br>  <br>My dick still twitches a little when I think of that ROAD ROLLER DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</wbr></br>  <br>I think she will be an ally.<br><br>I can't wait for the banter between her and Yasuho</br></br></br>  damn, part 7 colored looks like ass, the coloring ruins some scenes, like Mountain Tim's death scene.  <br><br> Alessi <br>Even if he was still a gruff delinquent, the first chapter shows PHYSICALLY jotaro was a sweet and gentle boy. Not some macho man-child nor did he was any ripple to bad this up. So it is just bullshited that Jotaro somehow at the age 7, even those then he was just a sweet and gentle boy, beat up a grown man who was ripped, had a weapon, and a stand, just by punching him. No matter what way you turn, its a complete cope out. That arc should have been Joseph showing up, being in his prime, and winning through ripple hijynx, not baby punches.<br><br> DIO <br>Star platinum punches the worlds hand and forearm to pieces, but they recover in a few moments because high DIO has the same regeneration rate as part 1 Dio. <br><br>And even if the explosion did get his head, as shown by Straights getting blown up and even part 1 Dio getting his head sliced in two, Vampires can nearly indefinitely recover as long as they have some fresh blood. <br><br>So why destorying the world would lead Dio to not be able to regenerate doesn't make sense. If nothing else they could have bullshited Dio regenerating but being comatose because "his spirit was killed" or something, but no, the punch just kills him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Everyone knows the correct order is 7 &gt; 4 &gt; 8 &gt; 2 &gt; 5 &gt; 6 &gt; 1 &gt; 3  <br>Who cares, get over the fact that part 3 was shit and move on.</br>  <br>You should post something else like bites za dusto for Jotaro, people will understand it's Boingo and not Jotaro since they already saw the scene, this face doesn't fit him at all nor makes it like it's an actual death but something clearly comedic.</br>  <br> 5 above 3 <br> 1 above 3 <br> 8 above anything before it's finished </br></br></br>  <br>Where did "I am the fucking strong" come from anyway? I know it's not the Duwang line for that panel.</br>  <br>  Not 7 &gt; 6 &gt;= 4 &gt; 5 &gt; 3 &gt; 1 <br>8 isn't finished yet.</br></br>  7&gt;4&gt;2&gt;6&gt;3&gt;1&gt;5  <br> 5 above 3 <br> literally a better part 3 <br> not above it </br></br></br>  <br>You have clearly misunderstood the entirety of SC, honestly.</br>  <br>Part 3 had DIO and Jotaro wasn't Giorno.</br>  <br>You mean Josefumi</br>  <br>Josefumi is dead.</br>  Is the Araki Collection mediafire ever going to get updated with the new scans? I don't think there's a way to really download all of Part 4's good scans at once.  <br> Part 3 had DIO <br>And?<br><br> Jotaro wasn't Giorno <br>Of course not, Giorno wasn't autistic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> anything other than 8&gt;7&gt;6&gt;5&gt;4&gt;3&gt;2&gt;1 </br>  <br>You've been here too long, anon</br>  If Jojo had to have a probably very stupid and forced crossover with something else, what would you choose?  My Killer Queen died.<br>RIP</br>  <br>Hokuto no Ken</br>  <br>How's this? I feel like the BtD one wasn't as good as this one.</br>  <br>Yes and it would be called  Phantom Blood. </br>  <br>Dresden Files<br><br>it just works</br></br></br>  <br>What about the bites the dust moment where everyone "dies" ? Just crop it to just show Jotaro.</br>  So... what exactly is this niggers stand power? Bubbles?  <br>That scene was orgasmic</br>  <br>a stand that starts off more OP than gold experience and is only limited by imagination</br>  <br>It's a good panel but his death isn't as brutal.</br>  is pucci gay  <br>ARE YOU GAY</br>  <br>What does GER even do?</br>  <br>Keeps the cause but erases the effect.</br>  <br>See the stands that just works ? They don't work at all now.</br>  <br>resets anything to 0, even the user's life, will, whatever you can think of<br><br>if you're thinking "well that's just an "I win" stand", you're right</br></br></br>  <br>What makes it broken?</br>  <br> can turn anything into animals, can punch people into retardation, can reflect any damage to the user </br>  <br>What exactly is the 'fura' sound effect supposed to indicate</br>  <br>Swaying or wobbling.</br>  <br>The fact it can just take the property of an object such as sound. It also has range through bubbles and has good close range power.</br>  <br><br>I thought it was the different fabrics rubbing against her</br></br>  <br>Things like completely raping the laws of physics and removing the friction from an entire room.</br>  <br> <br>yeah after that part happened I'm not entirely sure of the limit of what it can "take" away, or how the taking mechanism even works (other than just saying I can take whatever I want) - why can't he just "take" someone's life??</br></br>  seeing all those stand doujin covers got me thinking, so Toshikazu Hazamada(user of Surface) from part 4 could turn his stand into the girl he wanted to bang but he couldn't deal with the attitude of his pwn stand<br><br> what if some no name dude in the JoJo universe has a stand with a similar ability and actually fucks it? </br></br>  <br>Doraemon.<br>Hey, you said stupid and very forced.</br></br>  <br>I think cloth rustling more typically has a sa or za sound.</br>  does anybody have a download link to the mad videos?  <br>Stands are a representation of one's psyche.<br>It would have to be someone very narcissistic and willing to literally fuck a part of himself.</br></br>  <br>www.checkthepastebin.com</br>  <br>Too abstract. What is someone's life? Their pulse? Their consciousness?</br>  <br>Well since he can take air why not blood? or the heart?</br>  <br>how different is it compared to fucking your own hand?</br>  <br>it's not gay if it's god</br>  Shouldn't the new spoilers be Shigechi dies?    <br>Comes too to soon. Need end game spoilers and technically everyone does die so bites za dusto is perfect</br>  <br>Yea but who cares he literally dies within a dozen chapters of being introduced and he's an autistic fatass middleschooler</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the bubble needs to make contact with whatever he's taking</br>  <br>shigechi dies immediately after he appears</br>  <br>You have a good point.</br>  <br>Could take friction from skin. Or something else vital just from skin. I don't really recall his bubbles going down the stone guys throat.</br>  <br>They did. He stuffed them straight in his mouth.</br>  <br>Guess I'm retarded then, still doesn't stop skin contact from being dangerous in many ways.</br>  Which of the part 3 Hired Stand users do you think got paid the most? <br><br>Rubber Soul said he was promised a 100 milllion$ reward for killing Jotaro, and Steely Dan says that he got paid by Dio up front.</br></br>  <br>Would be funny if he stole the sharpness of a knife or something.<br>"lololol u can't stab me"</br></br>  <br> That shitty Jotaro fake <br>At least use the one from MiH</br></br>  <br>Maybe if you've read the rest of the thread, you'd be able to see why I used that specific photo.</br>  <br>Rubber Soul was an idiot and Dio was probably planning to kill him and make him into a zombie once he came back.<br><br>Steely Dan was smarter and more dangerous. If he got Lovers into Dio things could get sour so Dio probably didn't want to fuck around with him.</br></br></br>  <br>David made High DIO attractive.</br>    <br>Why does Rohan look like a pedophile?</br>  hey doc, lets get a folder going for the most out of context jojo panels. I got a some friends who just watched part 1 and are asking "what is jojo all about." Pic related.  So I just started watching this and  Why is the second JoJo so much better than the first one?   <br>Sure, I don't mind making another folder.</br>  <br>Better get your ass ready because the third Jojo is a shit.</br>  <br>How? This one is so based.</br>  <br>contributing</br>  <br>Stoic tryhard.<br><br>You'll wish you were back with Jonathan once this one comes in.<br><br>4th Jojo is good again though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gotta admit, for the longest time I thought Jolyne died because she couldn't control her stand.</br>  <br> 4th Jojo is good </br>  <br>I usually just direct people to this<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XD9<wbr>RMXTt8hc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Shut up Rohan.<br>Go fantasize about midgets.</br></br>  <br> antfish <br><br>kill your autist self</br></br></br>  <br>"Where the fuck is Mickey?" is required</br>  who would want to hang out with someone who licks spiders?  <br>People who enjoy realism.</br>  <br>does Araki taste things too when he writes JoJo?</br>  <br>I have the panels if anyone needs them</br>  <br>Ink and eraser residue.</br>    <br>I hope he does or else he just likes to torture himself.</br>    <br>Sometimes I wonder where does Araki get all this shit or if her really is autistic enough to already know such random stuff.</br>  <br>You just figured out the ending of part 8.<br><br>Trust me, I am a rock key</br></br></br>  <br>this doesn't even make sense in context</br>  <br>god damn white album was such a good fight and stand</br>  <br> Diamond is not crash </br>  <br>k added these two.</br>  <br>that's actually an example of the old part 5 scans being shitty: he should actually be ranting about italian</br>  If you got the option to go back and give a part 1-6 villain of the week a deeper part 7/8 backstory e.g. Ringo/Aishou<br>Who would you pick?</br>  <br>Stands suffer the same wounds/effects as the user does and vice versa. If gay priest is blind, Whitesnake is blind.</br>  <br>add blur to the text and then rasterize it</br>  <br>I'll pick  ----dubs---- <br><br> Hol Horse </br></br></br>  <br><br>Well and truly checked</br></br>  <br>N'Doul or Terunosuke.</br>  <br>Hunter x Hunter, oh wait, it's already happening</br>    <br>Because it's hard to make a character like Jonathan.<br>But I fucking love him.</br></br>  <br>run it through blurring a second time, then raise contrast, then rasterize it just a bit<br><br> just make it look good, I'm not a visual designer </br></br></br>  These Pillar Men aren't the brightest, are they?  <br> Terunosuke <br>Most underrated fight and stand.<br>He even beat a jojo</br></br></br>  Is it possible to make a better theme for Josuke than the one he has in ASB?  <br>I just realized my text had no anti alias, this should be fine.<br>I'll make the folder now and accept more out of context shit in the future threads.</br></br>    <br> real life </br>  <br>Is it possible to make a better theme for Terence than the one he has in Stardust Crusaders?</br>  <br><br>The answer to both is highly doubtful</br></br>  <br>how did we go this long without this</br>  <br> weahter </br>  <br>Is the newest OST out yet?</br>  <br>The "Anasui doesn't really understand what is going on" and Jolyne talking about nails is required as well.</br>  <br>shit, will get on that.<br><br><br>I'll also get this one colored.<br><br><br>will do, I'm going to need help on the Jolyne one, I can't remember that one</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Part 4 seriously needs to be made, just for how fucking ridiculous and amazing the highway star fight is.  Holy fuck I don't think I've ever hated one in fiction more than Joshu.  <br>don't see this one too often.</br>  <br>I know the Jolyne nail part is in the chapter "Weather - 6".</br>  <br>Screw that I want Ringo to have his own Dead mans questions</br>  <br>What if Rohan had do draw dicks?</br>  <br>He has Koichi.</br>  <br> that spit trail <br><br>I thought Part 4 was pure.</br></br></br>    <br>last one I have.</br>  Daily reminder that Joubin is a total dick.  <br><br> So why destorying the world  <br><br>BECAUSE IF YOU DESYTROY A STAND YOU DESTROY THE USER!!!!!! EVEN IF IT IS A VAMPIRE! JOTARO LITERALLY BLEW HIS FUCKING SOUL UP!<br><br>WHY IS THIS FUCKING POINT BROUGHT UP EVERY TIME WHEN ITS EXPLAINED VERY FUCKING CLEARLY IN THE FIRST CHAPTER. THERE'S LITERALLY A PAGE THAT HAS THE RULES WRITTEN DOWN!!<br><br>Sorry for caps but this gets brought up every single thread and its infuriating. Yes Dio was vampire with crazy healing powers, and if Jotaro had punched Dio in the same way, he probably wouldn't have suffered so much damage. But because Dio destroyed the World, he destroyed Dio's soul. Which still doesn't explain why his body is still alive even after Dio blows up, but that's just Araki forgetting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>also his stand is creepy as fuck</br>  <br>You don't even need to bring up the argument that Jotaro destroyed Dio through his soul. The damage on the World was so extensive that Dio's body was ripped to shreds. Then he exposed those tiny pieces to the sun and burned them to ashes. It's that simple.</br>  Since Jotaro killed Kira, does that make him the protagonist of part 4?  Out of Context folder<br>http://imgur.com/a/pcTvD</br>  <br>God, part 8 stands have all been fucking incredible looking.</br>  <br>wtf is this</br>  <br>An Ambulance killed Kira.</br>  <br><br>The problem with that is if The World was destroyed, why wasn't Dio? Why was his body still functioning with no soul? Of course, it comes back to every Jojo arguement ever: Araki has a short memory. Either that or sometimes he just decides to sacrifice continuity for whatever works at the time.</br></br>  <br>It's Angelo putting his water stand into some dude by spitting dog blood into his mouth.</br>  <br>So the Ambulance is the protagonist of part 4?</br>  Currently reading through Vento Aureo, and I just finished Volume 52: chapter 483, but can't seem to find the next chapter. <br><br>Everywhere I check just seems to skip around after that. Is there anywhere to download/read it, or are certain parts just missing?</br></br>   SPW helicopter man calls Joseph "Mr. Joestar" to show that they are not japanese <br> Speedwagon called Jonathan "Joestar-san" all the time <br><br>ayylmao</br></br></br>  <br>Speedwagon traveled the world.</br>  <br>You're on the newer scans, they only just got there with the rescan. Try this on batoto.<br> Ch. 482~490: The Express Train Heading Towards Florence [Old scans]  <br>then<br> Ch.491~499: The Grateful Dead [Old scans] </br></br></br></br>  Best fucking panel  <br>Ah, I got it now. <br><br>Thank you very much, Doc.</br></br></br>  <br>back when Polnareff was supposedly defeated by avdol/MR (which was before he got off and explained SC's armor ability), they assumed they had destroyed his stand, and I remember either avdol or kakyoin saying that polnareff would be in a coma for at least a month (maybe 3?). So Dio still was living even with his stand destroyed, although comatose, so it would have been wise to dispose of the body using sunlight to be safe.</br>  <br> implying </br>  <br> giorno <br> not using his mind and environment to outsmart the enemy <br>anon pls, not only did he do this in his own fights, he did it for other people's fights as well.</br></br></br>  <br>I apologize for my terrible grammar/sentence structure</br>  <br>Disregard his opinion, anon. He's clearly a fag who just got hot off the heels of the anime and is now reading part 4 thinking it's the best part and nothing compares</br>  Do HS batches of Stardust Crusaders usually take this long to come out? I can't even find an HS batch of the first season on nyaa.  <br>Why didn't this kill dio then anon?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127360147 <br>How do you do those parentheses? <br> Do i need a different stand? </br></br>  <br>Giorno is guilty of asspull, not not using his enviroment. If you don't think Giorno asspulled all his powers, you're crazy<br><br>Accidentally learned that punching people with his stand makes them overload their sense.<br><br> made a man commit suicide via bananagun <br><br> Made a vaccine to a flesh eating virus by turning a piece of a stand into a snake and getting an antivenom from it <br><br> Learned how to heal by cubing shit <br><br> GER. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What do you mean by HS? HorribleSubs? They have the entire anime up what are you talking about</br>   Sex Pistols, Emperor <br> Man in the Mirror, Hanged Man <br> The World, Star Platinum, King Crimson <br>Literally the same stands. Araki is such a fucking hack.</br></br></br>  <br>I just copy them from somewhere else.</br>  <br><br>Added both in color.<br><br><br>https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Japan<wbr>ese/Vocabulary/Punctuation</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yea Horrible Subs. I know they have the anime up, but each episode is separated. I'm looking for one giant batch of all the episodes.</br>  <br>HS doesn't do that i'm pretty sure</br>  Listen up, you little shit! I'll have you know I graduated high school and college at the top of my class! I was captain of my college wrestling team! Even after I graduated, I was respected and revered! That's how I became a politician! I have a villa on a thousand acres in Hawaii! I married a beautiful model who's 25 years younger than me! I pay 50 times more in taxes than ordinary people! I've defeated every enemy that I've faced! I'll eventually become President! I AM SENATOR WILSON PHILLIPS! YOU'LL GET LIFE IN PRISON FOR THIS! YOU HEAR ME? LIFE IN PRISON!  Just started Jojo season three, i dont really understand stands that much and i really love joseph, so i dont know if Jotaro can stand up to him especially since he doesnt seem that interesting and i doubt he can top "and the next thing you'll say..."<br><br>I only really see Dio making this a great season assuming they havent ruined his character or something. Is three considered a good season? And whats next after im done this?</br></br>  <br>Nice</br>  Nobody cared who Dio was until he put on the mask.  <br>Ah well that sucks</br>  <br>It's a asspull using your stand ability now</br>  <br>I like it, but the first season is basically filler/introduction to stands. DIO is pretty good.</br>  Unpopular opinions now<br><br>I think Joseph is overrated</br></br>  <br><br> Giorno and jotaro fights in a nutshell when it comes to stand powers <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=LXD<wbr>pcrt8D3w</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think you are overrated</br>  <br>Part 1 is my favorite Part and Jonathan is my favorite Jojo and the Mansion fight is my favorite fight.</br>  <br>That's not an unpopular opinion you dolt</br>  <br>GONNA GET CLOSER<br><br>TO MESS YOU UP</br></br></br>  <br>Most people here don't know what asspull means.</br>  <br>Part 2 is best part<br><br>Hamon&gt;Stands</br></br></br>  <br>Have you read all of Jojo</br>  <br>Would DIO fuck with this senator?</br>    <br>Yes, why?</br>  <br>No reason, nice dub dubs</br>  <br> David bowie as DIO </br>  H O T P A N T S<br>O<br>T<br>P<br>A<br>N<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now that I think about it, what can DIO even do to him?<br><br>He can harden his skin till it's hard enough to deflect the equivalent of lightsabers.<br><br>Punches would deal jack shit and he can heal it back up anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dio played college ball.</br>  <br> ZA WARUDO <br> Time stop <br> Chop his head <br> rip </br></br></br></br>    Sometimes me and my friend think up stand powers that aren't really dangerous, but would be fucking annoying.<br>Like, a stand that makes your balls itch forever. Or one that makes so that everyone you see is wearing socks and sandals. Or even one that makes your balls touch the toilet water every time you take a shit.</br>  <br> implying NANOMACHINES wouldn't bullshit they way though stopped time <br><br>they have done far worse</br></br></br>  <br>*their<br><br>fuck</br></br></br>  <br>it is no worst than crazy d's restoration ability or soft and wet.<br>only jonathan, joseph, and jolyne consistently used their heads with out asspulls. johnny is debatable but it seemed to me a lot of fights were getting a new ability and gyro making a plan.</br></br>  <br>I don't think nanomachines would work during stopped time</br>  <br>Because you're thinking with your penis</br>  <br>another</br>  <br><br>And one for the animefags worried about polneraff</br></br>  <br> Or one that makes so that everyone you see is wearing socks and sandals. <br>I don't need stand for this.</br></br>  I just finished part 4 is it worth reading part 5? i heard that nothing much happens and the scans are all duwang  <br>worse than duwang. Duwang was funny and kept the personality and tones of characters. 5 scans are all literal translations, so a lot is lost.</br>  <br>Rohan is just really lewd</br>  <br> implying DIO has enough strength to chop his head off <br>Even without the nanomachines active a HF blade couldn't cut through him</br></br>    if the Part 4 anime is made the rock paper scissors arc will be 2 episodes long   <br> There will be SSJ auras everywhere and flying out of nowhere <br> It will be glorious </br></br>  <br> They will give the Mikitaka arc a special ED like the Oingo/Hol Horse and Boingo episodes </br>  <br>Why?</br>  <br>Why not?</br>  <br>Scans aren't Duwang, just read it you tool</br>  <br>honestly i think reading out of order is really unorthodox, even if the parts don't connect at all. It's just something that I would never do, it just feels wrong.</br>  <br>I hope the Italian Restaurant arc lasts 3 episodes just to piss off animeonly fags.</br>  Just finished Steel Ball Run, I managed to avoid most spoilers but fuck I was sure  Gyro would come back in some capacity. I mean he JUST got Ball Breaker. Oh well, I went in thinking Johnny was annoying and the final scene kind of turned it around. <br><br>Now I have to decide if I want to start Part 8 or wait a decade for it to end.</br></br>  <br>Just start it lol if you do then you can stay here forever and avoid spoilers</br>  <br>Unpopular opinion coming through<br>I'd like to see the Gails before DIO, how they got to be his minions, and pretty much J Geil and Hol Horse hanging around. Bonus if through Enya we got to see other Tarot and Egpt Gods Stand Users, but also life in the Mansion along with DIO, Telence, Vanilla Ice, possibly Nukesaku and Petshop, and definitely how she felt towards Pucci. Plus I want to see her getting the Arrow from Diavolo.</br></br>  Man, I hope that if a part 4 anime happens they do something to the last episodes' OP like they did with DIO.<br><br> OP goes as normal <br> Getting near the end <br> DAI SAN NO BAKUDAN <br> BITES ZA DUSTO <br> Everyone explodes <br> Zooms in on Kira's smiling face <br> Cuts to logo <br> Killer Queen appears on screen <br> Screen explodes too <br> Episode begins </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> EXACTLY! <br> Captcha: bread </br></br>  <br>part 5 OP2 skips straight to the episode when they reach Diavolo</br>  <br>Good idea</br>  <br>oh they arent? thats good ill read it now then</br>    <br>I imagine it to be like that video where the person had Bloody storm playing while using all of the time abilities but obviously with just Diavolo</br>  <br>even worse is that it's not actually literal<br>while duwang was "translators don't understand english", this was "translators don't understand chinese" (chinese scans were used"</br></br>  <br>I blame her huge manhands.</br>  <br>The translation is still passable and doesn't look retarded like duwang. I seriously didn't know that the translation was bad until after I read it and heard everyone whining about it</br>  <br>Is that some sfm porn?</br>  <br>Is anyone here actually playing with the ASB models?</br>  <br>Same, I didn't notice it either until I saw examples of how bad it is. If you go in blind, part 5 just seems like it has a lot of dull characters due to the translation taking a ton of it out.</br>  Which JoJo could survive the Boss Rush?  <br>Her pants are on. It could be another JoJo pose for all I know.</br>  <br>it's one of the reasons (not the only one but a big one) why part 5 is often one of the least like parts in english speaking communities even though it's the most popular arc in japan and pretty popular in france and italy (which got licensed official translations)</br>  <br>GER Giorno and Jotaro.</br>  <br>Someone posted a guide from the jojo forum and I know some people messed with it. Doc probably has the link<br><br><br>I still liked it quite a bit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's going to be a shared Stand like the Eleven Men and the Boom Boom family. They are also probably Stone Men, because they creepy as fuck, they got that uncanny.</br>  <br>Only GER Giorno and Joseph with bullshit set to maximum<br><br>Jotaro doesn't have the stamina to beat them in a row<br><br>the rest doesn't even come lose</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They are also probably Stone Men <br>Was the wrong hand not a confirmation of that?</br></br>  <br>Giorno and Johnny. Possibly Gappy.</br>  <br>What about Pol with SCR?<br><br><br>Rock hand*</br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, it could be part of the Stand effect.</br>  <br>Here you go, I took off her clothes.</br>  <br>There's a Stand that does this. I don't remember what it is but I'm sure it's in the manga.</br>  <br>2spoopy4me</br>  <br> yfw Gappy does it <br> yfw he steals immortality from Kars <br> yfw he steals time from Dios timestops <br> yfw he steals explosions from KQ and makes them explode on kira <br> yfw he steals skipped time from Diavolo <br> yfw he steals Gravity from Green Baby or steals speed from MiH <br> yfw he steals dimensions from D4C <br><br><br>Fucking kek</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw jolyne is free from the skeleton inside her <br> stone free </br></br>  <br>So...Dio?</br>  <br>Him killing her was so he COULD keep the appearance. If she'd been alive, he'd have reverted after the time limit was over.</br>  <br><br> Numbah One as Joseph <br><br>THIS SHOULDN'T EXPAND DONG BUT IT DOES</br></br></br></br>  <br> The translation is still passable <br>It's not. It's really really not. It destroys all the minute details of everyone's characterization and says the exact opposite of what characters are saying at times. It's like they ran it through google translate.<br><br>At least Duwang was done by someone fluent in Chinese. This was done by someone who wasn't(but they could understand English) and when it comes to translation, not understanding the language you're translating from makes it very, very worse.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Bobobo is Old Joseph <br>I was worried for a minute there, that actor can do silly right.</br></br>  <br>I read it and thought it was fine and still rank part 5 high in my list, fuck off, it's not that fucking bad. You're especially retarded if you actually think Duwang is a better translation.</br>  <br>Achtung Baby?<br><br> Or King Crimson if ASB counts for anything </br></br></br>  <br>And you don't understand Japanese.</br>  <br>And? That didn't ruin my enjoyment of the part, retard.</br>  <br>My point wasn't that you couldn't enjoy the part, my point was that it's an awful translation. Stop being so reactionary.</br>  <br>Do Part 3 Dio on Jonathan's body.</br>      <br>But you said it wasn't passable, when it totally is, then talked about how duwang is better.</br>  <br>Not him but Duwang really is a better translation, even if it doesn't look so.</br>   Star Platinum <br> super strength <br> super speed <br> super reflexes <br> super precision <br> has Star Finger <br> clearly a long-range thrown projectile Stand <br> can even be used for mid-range spearing if you use Star Finger with all ten fingers <br> Jotaro only uses it as a point-blank brawler <br><br>Why is Jotaro so retarded?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm ok with it</br>  What would you guys rate it? No, I didn't do this<br><br> Personally I think it has good "production" but some ares are really darker and the colors just seem off for some reason </br></br>  <br>Because Duwang more accurately portrays the original text more than the part 5 translation does. You really have no idea what you're talking about.</br>  <br>He does throw knives during the fight with DIO.</br>  <br>No, no it isn't. It's only good in the sense that it's funny</br>  <br>8.5/10</br>  <br>He throws a single knife at an innocent bystander's car tire and causes them to crash.</br>  <br>Really think there are plenty of good examples such as <br> I wanna be a gangster star <br>In the redone one is<br> I wanna be a gang-star <br>Its so much smoother and feels much better for JoJo.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're really new here, aren't you? This comparison has been made over and over again, and everybody knows Duwang is closer to the original meaning that the translation we got for part 5.</br>  <br>Throwing regular objects won't hurt enemy stands. When he can kill the user (like throwing a rock to kill The Sun's user) he does.</br>  <br>No one said Duwang was a good translation, we're only saying it's better than the part 5 translation because it more accurately portrays the original text because at least it was done by someone fluent in Chinese. At least Duwang doesn't say literally the opposite of what the characters are saying some of the time.<br><br>Do you know any of the other languages part 5 has been translated to? No? Then stop talking out your ass.</br></br></br>  <br>If you fucked your stand would you be able to feel what you were doing to it?</br>  <br>Why would Jotaro risk to do something so forward like throwing shit around? That's out of character.</br>  <br>So am I</br>  <br>It still isn't a good translation. The faggots got an F on their assignment</br>  <br> It has that TV snow effect for a moment to confuse watchers </br>  <br>Araki isn't a very good writer.<br>You've noticed this, haven't you?</br></br>  <br><br>Reminder that that's Jonathan's body<br><br>Jonathan is best Jojo and also hottest Jojo and that's DIO canon</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only in the early in the beginning, he got better. It was also the 90s</br>  <br>Pretty sure star finger requires him to focus all his energy on that one finger. It's not like Johnny's Tusk.</br>  <br>The digital version of the English Jojoniums changes that to "give you a whuppin"</br>  <br>That's a very good point. Nearly all of the fights in Jojo are some kind of puzzle, so the protags have to think up some clever way to win. Brute force often won't work.</br>  <br>Toki wo clothare</br>  <br>You don't need to remind me. Thats what makes it so hot.</br>  <br>Johnny might stand a chance<br> Fucks up Kars, though doesn't kill him <br> Uses DIO's arrogance to fuck him over <br> Hits SHA, which in turn fuck over his hand and spreads to him <br>No idea how the encounter with Diavolo would play out, but other than that MiH is the only real threat, meaning if he manages to hit him before he gets it, he's all set.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Beautiful</br>  How does it feel to know that if you like part 4 the best from now on all you're going to get is:<br> hurr look at this newfag just started to read the manga <br><br>and when the anime comes out:<br><br> hurr anime only fag get out read the manga </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Golden spin exists outside of time, so it keeps working even during timestop. Safe to assume it'll keep working during timeskip. And diavolo will make that mistake and get fucked.</br>  <br>It's already translated. I don't see why we have to wait until October to get a physical copy of Battle Tendency.</br>  <br> Karera's nostrils are oddly placed <br> Josefumi's eyes an odd colour, feel free to disregard this <br> Birthmark solid black <br> Lips have an odd tint <br><br>Overall it's pretty good, but those things really annoy me</br></br></br></br></br></br>   stands are becoming closer and closer to pokemon   <br>Because they have a set schedule.<br>Official Battle Tendency has been out digitally since March.<br><br>But the Phantom Bloods have two months to be completed.<br><br>Fuck, it's insane.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Uses Dio's arrogance <br>Too bad he lost to a human Dio in part 7. As long as Dio figured out how the spin worked he would win.</br></br>  <br>I predict a lot of part 4 fags suddenly becoming SBR fags.</br>  KISAMAAAAAAAAA  <br> Pokemon <br> Each one has a predetermined movelist <br> The funkiest ones are ones of legend that nobody can use <br><br> Stands <br> Each one is unique, apart from punchghosts of part 3 <br> Some of them can be completely useless <br> With S&amp;W we're being introduced to fusions of stands <br><br>I don't really see the resemblance. If anything stands are moving more and more away from pokemon because they're getting crazier and more bizarre.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just really don't understand why there needs to be a whole three fucking months between each volume, though.<br><br>At this pace, assuming the rest of the series gets localized, it may literally take decades to get caught up to where Araki is now.</br></br></br>    <br> part 6 rated that high <br><br>King Crimson yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>I have to hope it's to gauge interest. <br>That if they do well enough that by the time they get to Part 3 they ramp up the release schedule.</br></br>  <br> Karera's nostrils are oddly placed <br>I don't think the upper left mark is supposed to be a nostril, probably just a mistake. <br><br> Birthmark solid black <br>Fuck, I didn't even notice that. That really bothers me now.<br><br>But yeah I feel overall his color choice just looks really weird. He felt like doing neutral colors but then having a bright deep blue hat for Karera and a green and orange outfit on Josef. Like you said the lips are grey for no fucking reason and the eyes are weird too. Personally I would've given them a grey color. and gave a more pinkish color to the lips</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thing is Diego knew how it worked from the get go, because Valentine told him.

Our aim is to transcend the metaphor, and reach true philosophy. <br>This is a declaration of war, a deliberate move in order to reinstate a truly peripherical point of view. We reconstruct the veracity as we speak, pertaining to its original value. A neologism, that will imprint its mark of true significance, is born. In these words you will not find solace : exhale, and believe. This revolution will carry no message, and yet bear fruits of vindication. Such is the path of he who is truly blessed. Each iteration has known its conflict, each division its veneration. Through our effort, we pray to obtain senseless volition. <br>Only thus can sense be made, and dereliction exposed as deception. <br>As we have our kek, so do we eat it, fully conscious of our struggle. <br><br>I, anon, will deliver.<br>For I will be here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like lolis who are older than me.</br>  Please stop replying to pasta.<br>https://archive.moe/_/search/text/E<wbr>very%20time%20I%20see%20a%20%20thre<wbr>ad%2C%20I%20just%20shake%20my%20hea<wbr>d%20and%20laugh./</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Too many people fall for the bait.</br>  I wish mods-kun would stop leaving for 1 hours everytime.<br><br>This is /a/ and we need NEET mods already.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358129 <br> those hips <br> pedophilia <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br>But i'm a little girl, h-how did this happen?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358749 <br>nice pasta</br>  <br>Well too bad you get mods that don't watch anime and are bronies.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127359062 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358749 <br>You must be living a very sad life.</br></br>  Any yuri heavy shows besides Prisma this Summer?  <br> bronies <br>Gonna need proof of that, anon.</br></br>  Are Narutards this mad that they have to ruin other threads?  <br>Yuri undertones in NNB and expect yuri undertones in the kirara manga adaptations.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127359062 <br>That picture is incorrect, Canada is a lot stricter with lolis than America, but what would you know shitposter-kun.</br>  <br>Based mods.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127358749 <br>Fun fact: Lolicons are the biggest normalfags on /a/.

Now it's 8 AM and I'm feeling like shit. I don't think it was meant to be watched in one go. All those happy scenes in 11 - 12 and then a fucking punch in the face with the last one.</br>  <br>Still S2, he makes new machine with skills saves Isla. I'd watch it.</br>    <br>That ending was so abrupt I sat there and was in shock, I thought it was the middle of the show fade to black, not the end, here's the OP that's it. Like it was.</br>  <br><br>US release when?</br></br>  <br>Didn't really like the fact that they played the ending so normally. But overall I thought the episode had great pacing. Before it aired I actually thought Isla would already die in the A part. I'm happy she didn't.</br>  <br>For the season? Definitely. <br>Overall? Not even close to being close.</br></br>  <br>Once the music started</br>  <br><br>She looks so small in his arms... she's just sleeping right?</br></br>  <br> not showing Isla sleeping face on-screen <br> showing the face of all the previous giftias after being retrieved <br><br>Probably the biggest flag in the entire episode</br></br></br></br>  <br>On and off during the episode but once they went to the park it was a nonstop flood.</br>  <br>Nigger I already lost it at Episode 11 and 12.</br>    <br>When she said he smiles to hold back the tears.</br>   it will have asspulls <br> the diary is magic <br> happy end for sure <br>I feel bad for those who believed those lies.</br></br></br>  <br>Just finished right now.<br>I cried like a little bitch.</br></br>  <br>As soon as the last OP change happened. I was doing good too   right up till the end. <br>Now I have "The Spirit Carries On" stuck in my head, both making me sad and a little relieved at the same time.</br></br>  I wish I hadn't fallen behind on this so I could've cried with everyone.  <br>It's a shame anon. I fell back on it too but caught up just in time to cry with /a/.</br>  <br>The actual ending is the post credits scene where everyone is happy and smiling. You can pretend there was soul crushing sadness but Isla is still there in one way or another.</br>  Based on her appearance I can't imagine Isla having a different personality. Except everybody probably knows how to deal with her better this time around.  Would you want a second season if it was just about Tsukasa and everyone working and being more about the setting and a 'giftia of the week' format?  Isla would only possibly show up at the end for a few seconds with a new personality.   <br> 'giftia of the week' format </br>  <br> This time <br>There will never be another Isla</br></br>  <br>I would watch a new love story between Tsukasa and Isla with a different personality, kek.</br>  <br>I would only watch it if Tsukasa and Michiru end up together.<br><br>Also a scene where Michiru retires Zack could be pretty good.</br></br></br>  <br>  Isla would only possibly show up at the end for a few seconds with a new personality. <br> Isla would only possibly show up <br> Would only possibly <br> only <br>There are only happy plastic memories with Isla</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What what if she's a raging lesbian now?</br>  <br>New Isla without old memories. No fuck that, she only comes back if she comes back as herself.</br>  <br>I wish they showed him and Michiru getting together at the end, would have closed it off perfectly, them both having lost a giftia they loved,</br>  <br>i only watched like 8 or 9 shows this season but this is easily aots, nothing else comes close</br>  Daily reminder than the Ferris wheel never ended for Isla.  <br><br> Tsukasa prefering a shitty tsundere over an eternal lolibot <br>Never, ever.</br></br></br>  I haven't cried like this since After Story. While not complete bitch tears it's been a while since anything's made me sob. <br><br>8.5/10 - Should have been shorter because they clearly couldn't get a competent writer for the middle of series to pad it out.</br></br>  Posting this every thread until Isla dies  in our memories.   I was going to drop this show after the Marcia episodes, but I'm glad I stuck around. T'was fun while it lasted.  <br><br><br><br> Not wanting the actual ending or an alternative where Tsukasa and the original Isla are still together <br>This is why I can't stand /a/matures.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he doesn't want endings that twist the knife further and cause more tears and prolonged suffering <br><br>You don't belong here</br></br></br>  I know I'm throwing myself off a cliff here...<br>English dub when?</br>   Get the exact same OS <br> Introduce her to the diary <br><br>I don't understand what the fuss is about.</br></br></br>  <br>If they were comfortable enough to have baths together and hand fuck each other like never before seen in an anime, it's safe to assume they fucked at some point.</br>  I really don't see the real benefit of recycling her body. It would just seem to cruel to just use her again as a sort of restart, and show her the diary in hopes of getting her to remember or play along. I think Tsukasa moving on is better and more fulfilling. Isla will still have a place in his heart   and mine ;_;    <br> Denser than Osmium </br>  <br> Hasn't seen one week friends. </br>  <br>Do Giftia even have genitals ? Do they have an anus and if yes do they poop ? WHY HAS THOSE QUESTIONS NOT BEEN ANSWERED ?</br>  <br>Eru and Andie could restart their friendship, there is nothing that stops Tsukasa from doing the same with Isla (well, their case was not a friendship but you get the point)</br>  <br>They eat and drink so I would assume so.</br>      <br> Tsukasa notices that his co-worker Isla is always alone and seemingly has no friends. After approaching her and becoming better acquainted, Isla reveals that every nine years she loses all memory. Despite learning this, Tsukasa endeavors to befriend her anew every nine years. </br>  First and last episodes were sad. Episode where Tsukasa moves in with Isla was funny, good comic timing. Otherwise it was bland, thought about dropping it several times. 6/10  Isla is gone forever. Feels bad, man.    <br>While they did restart their friendship, I feel like Tsukasa having to deal with a new Isla would just be painful, and wrong. He loved the Isla that he knew, and if he tried to form a recycled Isla into the one he loved, it just wouldn't sit right, he would try to force someone completely different into a mold he expects to be filled and fulfill his desires. It just wouldn't be fair.</br>  <br><br>Yes, they have some ways to evacuate what they eat/drink, but is this like human's or is just like some kind of hole used to purge themselves ? I'd assume they have normal holes and stuff since they ressemble humans so much, but I can't imagine the dudes that are making them had to do their vagina/dong and pooper</br></br>  Alright /a/ let's put the feels aside.<br>What was bad about Plastic Memories?<br><br>I think it had a lot more potential.</br></br></br>  <br>Advanced AI is supposed to grow and evolve with daily experiences, molding her is exactly what Tsukasa needs to do. Or you think Isla was pre-programmed to be a cute girlfriend?</br>  <br><br>Mostly it was a short story spread out over a single cour. Could have been done in three to four episodes rather than twelve. Indulges in a lot of pointless filler. Sets up numerous "what is man; what is machine" and "what makes a living soul" questions without bothering to explore them. The post ED credits scene.</br></br>  <br>Yes, you're hurting me. Stop with these Isla pictures ;_;</br>  <br>Molding her pussy is what Tsukasa is destined to do</br>  I liked Michiru better when she looked clearly disgusted when people implied she might have feelings for Tsukasa, and the dere was nothing more than her identifying she had a chip on her shoulder and was afraid she was taking it out on the newbie.<br><br>That being said I hope they end up together. They spent the entire series trying to pull an Ano Hana and set the redhead up with MC after white haired girl left.</br></br>  <br> Would you want a second season if it was just about Tsukasa and everyone working and being more about the setting and a 'giftia of the week' format? <br>Sure.</br></br>  <br>She was given her own personality and her memories made her who she was. Giving someone a diary and making them learn and try to replicate the personality or sympathize with them just isn't right.</br>  <br>I liked Michiru, she was annoying with her Tsundere front, but both of them have lost someone very close to them, and the pity fucks would be rowdy and glorious.</br>  I admit I'm a pussy, but who else cried?  <br>I didn't. Michiru warned him.</br>  <br>Isla was the backbone of the show. There is no point without her.</br>  <br>No tears here anon, I was sad up until this finale. I just had an air of acceptance when Isla finally "died" but I just couldn't well up any tears.</br>  <br>I would rather be it from the pov of the giftia owners, 3 episodes for each arc should do the trick.</br>  <br><br>Kind of a stupid argument when we have no idea how a brand-spankin' new Gifta gets a personality in the first place. All we're told is the old OS is removed, memories wiped, new OS installed, and blammo. Whatever magical nonsense the OSes have going for them appear to create the personality for the new model.<br><br>We never learn if they can be predetermined by the client to have specific parameters for personality or if it is all completely fucking random. Odd that a consumer based business would force a "Russian roulette" with an expensive new android. If they can be preprogrammed, then why wouldn't anybody just get their old model back with the old personality and redo the memories?<br><br>For that matter, what goddamned retarded writer thinks you can create complicated AIs with emotions and learning capacities but you can't copy fucking memory from a hard drive to a new one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't get bitch tear levels but I had my first good cry in years.</br>  <br>The diary is not even needed at this point, all Tsukasa needs to do is be nice to her and win her trust. He already has experience so this time will be easier.</br>  <br> but you can't copy fucking memory from a hard drive to a new one. <br>What are you, fucking stupid?<br>The problem is that they fill up the hard drive with memories in 9 years. What sort of retarded purpose would forcibly inputting 9 years of memories into a new hard drive achieve besides rendering the android useless as soon as its built.</br></br></br>  <br><br>So Tsukasa just needs to pull off a 50 First Dates? I mean, I would just want Isla to experience the world herself in a way free from romantic intentions, then if she finds Tsukasa as a romantic interest, go from there.</br></br>   Post Tsukasa's face when the New Isla is like this.   <br><br>There's never any indication that the problem is they fill up their memory capacity. We are NEVER explained why they have to be recalled in exactly 9 years and 4 months, except that the alternative leads to the Wanderer phenomenon and they go berserk. Hell, we don't even know why an underworld organization would exist that would WANT to kidnap Giftias at the end of their lifespans, especially if the things are known to go berserk and kill the people around them.<br><br>Either way, it wasn't memory problems. The implication is that the OS is what breaks down.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They didn't explain why giftias needs to lose their memories after 9 years. Sci-fi stuff.</br>  <br> Hell, we don't even know why an underworld organization would exist that would WANT to kidnap Giftias at the end of their lifespans <br><br>They do it at the end of the lifespan to pass as fake Terminal Service members and easily fool the customers. And specific reasons: either loot the body and sell the parts or refresh them and sell the entire giftia in the black market.</br></br></br>  I image the refurbishing process. Years of wear entails a new layers of skin and other warn parts. You wont see this happen ever, but if you did it would dehumanize Giftia slower than the inverse of watching the Darpa robot leg walkers getting kicked around in the demonstration videos.<br><br><br>Just think that with the refurbishing, all the physical marks of their existence by wear and tear is also striped like their memories.</br></br></br>  <br>I agree, it feels like the sad shit about retrieving and losing memories could've been done in one episode or two. Then we'd see Isla lose her memory and Tsukasa losing his shit.for two more episodes. I liked this series pacing though, it was funny and entertaining most of the time.</br>  <br><br><br>Okay, correcting myself. I guess the problem is they can't "overwrite" data or it causes problems or something. It isn't explained well. Implies that they do have a maximum memory capacity, which is a problem.<br><br>Doesn't explain how they can predict when a Giftia will "fill up" with memory.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sets up numerous "what is man; what is machine" and "what makes a living soul" questions <br>That's exactly what I thought it would be about, and had it carried on along those lines after the first episode then it would have been right up there with the best of series that explored the human condition by looking at the lives of androids/robots. OK, so the episodes after that were kind of closing off the possibility of a good end by showing what the only possible outcomes were for Giftias, but it only started to get back into its stride with the final arc.<br><br>The last episode was just masterful. Packed full of emotion but without a trace of mawkishness. When Tsukasa put the retrieval ring on Isla's finger, it was as if he was marrying her and killing her in the same moment. And then he carried her, not across the threshold of their home, but across the threshold of life and death.<br><br>I'll reserve judgement on the post-credits scene. It probably made a lot of sense for Tsukasa to move to another section for a while, but really 9 months is nothing when it comes to grieving for a lost loved one. It seems very unlikely there will ever be second season so we'll probably never know about his new partner.<br><br>Anyway, I need to move on too, but despite that I've ordered the Isla Memorial magazine. I owe her that, at least.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Doesn't explain how they can predict when a Giftia will "fill up" with memory. <br>It's a robot. It writes data at a constant rate, of course they can predict it if they know the capacity of what they're using to store memories.</br></br>  <br><br>And the one time we see it, the Giftia goes berserk and kills everybody. The idea that Giftia chopping or retooling for resale requires us to know more about the world. Are Giftias expensive? They seem to be everywhere. Are Giftia parts valuable? Who would buy them? Do the black market hoods have the technology to redo the OS?<br><br>Would have been nice to see what kind of things can happen to Giftas outside of an office setting with a cozy romance.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The last episode is fine. Brilliant, in fact. I didn't get emotional, though, because I felt like the rest of the show was a chore to get through. I just wanted it to end, but I recognize that the last episode was executed probably almost exactly as the writer had in his brain. I would bet even money he wrote that scene first and worked backwards from there.<br><br>I just couldn't put up with the rest of the show.<br><br><br><br>This implies that memories, in data form, are all equal. Different senses, different responses, different stimuli, different situations, different rate of experiences. I'm not sure I buy that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's easy enough to imagine that a Giftia's neural networks are built like ours, meaning that they learn by developing pathways in their brain through the experiences they have. The more they have certain experiences, the more the pathway is strengthened.<br><br>It's also made clear that Giftias never forget, probably because losing certain memories could irreparably break the neural network. This also explains why training doesn't help near the end of the life cycle because adding a few new memories won't be enough to overhaul the existing/failing system and network.<br><br>Eventually you're going to run out of neurons to write on and unlike a conventional computer, if a Giftia's circuitry is anything like a human brain's, the processing and storage are interconnected meaning you can't just plug in a new HDD and be fine. <br><br>After running out of space, the computer will start overwriting 'neurons' leading to a breakdown of everything that isn't so ingrained in the neural network (instincts, who they want to mamoru, etc) that they can no longer operate properly.<br><br>You could copy the brain right before the failure, but the moment it develops new memories it's going to break so you'd have to stop it from developing new ones which really isn't any different from being a vegetable at that point, or you could copy one week before and just constantly system restore, dumping the previous week. If that's a life worth living is another wall of text for another day.<br><br>Either way I'm responding to a tripfag so I'm not expecting any sort of meaningful discussion but I hope it clears up some of your misunderstandings.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I will use another problem discovered with current generation AI called "over training"<br>Over training is when a learning algorithm receives to much date and start to loss its ability to classify data from a training set. Basically the AI mind losses the ability to solve and think.<br><br>I want to think this is what happen once the Giftia over learns with to much information in its life time. The 9 years limit is probability tested from averages information uptake over time filling to some capacity, eventually unable to use what it learns meaningfully.<br><br>Normal Organic minds have the ability to forget because an intrinsic ability to lost neuron connects from too little stimuli over time. I bet Giftia are no where near as efficient, or even able, to forget useless data over time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Different senses, different responses, different stimuli, different situations, different rate of experiences. <br>It's all 1's and 0's as far as data's concerned.<br>We don't know how they store the memories, but if they have an exact expiry date for giftia, then the memory read must be constant.</br></br></br>  Vanilla doujins when?  <br><br><br>In both cases, however, Giftia memories can be wiped by outside means. Why such a limited process? If they can eliminate memories externally, why not internally? Is it a limitation in decision making? The Giftia is incapable of deciding which memories to lose, ergo it can't?<br><br>Moreover, another implication is that Giftias and Giftia technology has been around for a while now, but they haven't advanced any methods to solve the issues of memory storage? We don't know anything about the Giftia manufacturing process. What we're told is that a new OS goes into the unit, but what makes the new personality of the Giftia? Are they trained for a year or two before going out to their owners or is there a personality already installed with the OS? That was the question I asked above.</br></br></br></br></br>  ITT: weeboes trying to figure out how a loli android brain works to recreate their own personal Isla cuddle bot  <br>Remember, every dollar spent on war is a dollar not spent on genetic engineering for domestic catgirls.</br>  <br> It's all 1's and 0's as far as data's concerned. <br>Not if the memory was quantum-based. The limitation there would be the stability of the quantum entanglement, so maybe there's some sort of absolute limit to the complexity.</br></br>  <br>Im more interested in how to recreate the skin, hair and nails or the outer shell of the main frame. Also the body parts that allow clank clank.</br>  <br>How much clank clank did Tsukasa and Isla have before their final day?</br>  <br>They probably spent an entire day in bed the first time. But I doubt they did it that much overall.</br>  <br> If they can eliminate memories externally, why not internally? <br>Please reread paragraph 2. Elimination of memories always results in a complete OS reboot.<br><br> hey haven't advanced any methods to solve the issues of memory storage? <br>We're about to hit the smallest transistor size for CPUs because quantum tunneling is making impossible to make them any smaller and still work properly. It's simple enough to assume in the future they have reached a similar limit.<br><br>Alternatively, imagine if you had a regular car and you bolted an extra wheel on somewhere. It might have more wheels, but unless you rehaul the entire framework, that extra wheel won't do you any good. It's more than possible that the mechanical framework of a Giftia's brain works in a similar fashion and you can't just download more ram.<br><br>Also please note , at the end of the day this is still just a chinese cartoon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If their brain is artificial neurons based. I can imagine they have a way to flush all trained synapses as a memory wipe. As for start-up brain, it is probability a initial training-set in some primitive part of the brain it reboots from and begins learning as a new mind. <br><br>As for this startup phase of the brain, it might be the only simple part they can manufacture because what what knowledge needed to function as a individual is something global to all of them and possibly hardwired to never change, instinctive. The OS probability is no more an connection in this startup module and checking the health of synapse growth of the whole brain over time.<br><br><br>Why cannot memories be saved? Neuron connections in a physical space is not something that can be converted and restored from. It is not just electricity, but the physical joints and chemicals that control everything. What tool could possible guide every cell to connect as before when even the iteration order of the connections over time also matters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Doesn't this become kind of a chicken or egg argument, though? Which came first, the ability to create a complicated human brain-like structure or the ability to interact with it? The Giftias need both. If the Giftia itself can interact with it, and external objects exist that can destroy the neural pathways of the memory, it isn't a far enough stretch that somehow we have a way to write them, which implies also an ability to read them. If there is true cellular biology involved here, which would explain why we see Giftias eating (and taking a piss) then there are far more important and broader problems that exist beyond just the brain structure. At that point, what separates a Giftia from a human? Why androids, then, with limited capacities? Why not just genetically modified grown human slaves? I mean, morally, if you can own something that is as close to human as possible, what's the difference?<br><br>Somehow, the Giftia Rights Movement never happened, I guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We're already beginning to see people's dreams and map human neural networks, it is possible to save memories. The issue is the memory might be so intertwined with other pathways and networks that separating it would mean breaking a dozen others, or it might not even run properly without the entire neural structure backing it.<br><br>If it exists in reality we can map and model it. It's just not as easy and dragging and dropping files.</br></br></br>  <br>If you can simulate a brain-like structure that means it's already conscious. Figuring out how to interact with it is simply a matter of finding out where the senses connect to the brain and feeding it input.</br>  <br><br>My answers can only go so far. I imagine what tech they got on a artificial brain is still more "black box" then tinker'ible. The manufactures are working with what they understand and tested and know what is safe. And that safely required a shutdown date.<br><br>If the series wanted to explore this "black box" more, it could go anywhere season two. You will need to ask the director what he plans to explore and decides in his head-cannon.<br><br>My answers are based on what i studied on AI technology and methods. Even the newer artificial neuron chips leave little control beyond its simple function and training.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The issue is the memory might be so intertwined with other pathways and networks .... <br><br>Yes this is the very problem. I also doubt in this series world they have a means to control exact duplication of neuron placement and configuration. But memory wiping? Probability as simple as a flush of some chemical as a reset agent to the neurons and other chemical artifacts to the training connections that made a Giftia become who they were as unique.</br></br></br>  <br> crying in front of a woman </br>   Be Tsukasa <br> Just finish retiring my robot waifu <br> Feel sad as shit but try to act strong <br> Offered ride home by hot senpai but decline so I could cry a lot more on the walk back <br> Get back to room <br> "Tadaima" <br> It takes a whole minute before I realize no one's going to answer back <br> Walk listlessly to the table <br> There's a letter <br><br> Do you guys think Isla left some saucy pics for fap material for Tsukasa? I'm pretty sure the guy will at least try fapping to her laundry when he gets really lonely. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They did little things like the psychopass episode and the board drama. Then they pinged the characters in her workplace, I think most shows would have done more with them or tried to make Michiru more of a rival character.<br>I know why anon doesn't like it though. It a mature ending to a mature show dealing with reality, which contrasts with the super happy SoL parts and the nature of their job which got less focus as the episodes moved on.<br>So I imagine that whatever they did, it would have upset people. Which is why the most upsetting part is that Isla accepts her end far more than Tsukasa does and thats supposed to mirror what the viewer is doing emotionally. <br>You really want it not to be a thing that she's gotta lose the memories, but in the end you come to understand that that was the reality Tsukasa was facing all along.<br>Which was why Isla didn't even want to get involved with him at all. She wanted to silently fade away and in the end that still ended up happening.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> We're about to hit the smallest transistor size for CPUs <br>No, the limit is in the fabrication process.</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure that letter was the audio drama letter</br>   see death coming by episode 2/3 <br> drop it <br> she died <br><br>nothing of value was lost.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Should have seen it coming episode 1 you pleb</br>  <br>It took you that long to realize?</br>  <br><br>could've been an ok show regardless of that, but it was mainly the forced shoujoshit that turned me off. thanks for the replies!</br></br>  <br> could have been an ok show <br><br>You only saw 3 episodes, you can't say what it is either way.</br></br></br>  <br> This is why I can't stand /a/matures </br>  <br> dub </br>  <br> episode1 some dude is partnered with a girl robot. learns a bit about her. forced tear jerky shoujo scene. end <br><br> episode2 girl robot is a dweeb. continue shoujoshit with bigbro/sis advice moments. boy blows off human girl. <br><br> episode3 move in with girl robot. full shoujoshit activate. fucking dropped <br><br>thanks for your subjective opinion, but this is the objective facts of the first 3 episodes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There are plenty of shows with shit starts that end up good.

It definitely made me sad though. I'll put it behind After Story and Grave of the Fireflies.

Pretty sure in the credits there is a Singapore company listed.</br>  <br>Yeah but it's not like they ever mentioned Terminal Service 1 traveling to other countries for their assignments.

There was no open ending, no asspull ending, just a final ending that made perfect sense.</br>  <br> There was no open ending <br>Oh really? Looked wide open to me. Or maybe you didn't watch the post-credits scene.</br></br>  <br>I'd watch Zack and Mihiru instead<br>Fuck Tsukasa he's so boring and uninteresting as the MC, the definition of a generic anime nice guy character</br></br>  <br>Or maybe you didn't watch the 13 episodes before the post-credit scene.</br>  Are there seriously people who think Plastic Memories is shoujo?    <br>No I meant like they kiss each other in private</br>  <br>You're retardered.</br>  <br>Are you one of those guys that actually think S2 is going to happen?</br>  <br> New Giftia has Isla's base personality and traits <br> Tsukasa falls in love with her again <br> She gets reset again <br> This repeats over and over <br> Tsukasa is 35 and starts to treat her more like a daughter <br> He's 60 and she's more like a granddaughter <br><br>I know that isn't how it works with regards to the keeping shit over, but I can dream.<br><br>Not that guy btw.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>GOD DAMN.</br>  <br><br>Rota Fortunae</br></br>  I didn't feel anything during the last ep.<br><br>The stupid window cleaning technique unveiled by isla in the early part of the ep mind fucked me too hard to feel.</br></br>  <br>I will never forget her.</br>  <br>But how else would this happen?</br>  <br>Tsukasa was carrying isla after she died like that no?</br>  <br>3:39<br><br>Also I somehow skipped over episode 9</br></br></br>  <br>He holds dead Isla the other way round.</br>    <br>Watched it after I got off work the day it aired. It rekt me.</br>  <br>Throughout the whole episode. But especially at pic relate</br>  Even if you don't think that this is AotS, you can't deny that the ferris wheel scene is easily the saddest moment of the season.  <br>Considering how lackluster this season was that isin't saying much</br>  <br> Season 2 <br> this garbage sold like shit </br></br>  <br><br>Obligatory show that for some reason has a sci-fi setting that it fails to make use of so it can just fall back on cliche weepy doomed romance material of the season. The people that liked this show can move onto Charlotte and probably Classroom Crisis next season.</br></br>  <br>Was I supposed to cry watching this garbage</br>  <br><br>I don't think this seasons been lackluster at all, just people only seem to pay attention to teen high school romantic dramedy shit. It got really noticeable that this was probably the case towards the latter half of the season.<br><br>If this season was truly bad to people than I don't see how it's getting any fucking better next one so that should give people something to consider if they're into that sort of thing which is doubtful really.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The same can be said about hibikek</br>  <br><br>Probably?</br></br>  <br>Anon!! Season 2 is pretty much confirmed, but nice try~</br>  <br>Just like Amagi, right?</br>  <br><br>he writes below he wants it to be kind of ambiguous between the two options ("Tsukasa, arigatou" and "Sayonara, arigatou"). He's wants to shoot for "nani itta ka wararanai kedo kininaru" - "not sure what she said but I WANT TO KNOW.<br><br>Seeing how people keep asking the very question, it's job done 100%</br></br></br></br>  <br> how lackluster this season was <br><br>Considering how this is said about every single season this isn't saying much.</br></br></br>  <br>If you have any humanity left in you and enjoyed the Series then yes or atleast you should feel sad.</br>  <br>No because I saw the scene after the ED coming. A partial separation doesnt hit as hard as a permanent one.</br>  <br>Not this shit again. We don't even know who his new partner is. And considering that Tsundere also runs around with a shota it would be no big surprise if it's just another Loli. Also how fucking sick and twisted would the co-workers be to just give him the body of his waifu without her personality.</br>  The ending didn't really do it for me in terms of making me sad enough to cry. Maybe because the early shelf life reveal for Isla and how no miracles can occur braced me for that.<br>Anyway, what I really liked was Tsukasa being robosexual and their lovey-dovey shit. That was cute.</br>  <br>It was his decision, co-workers were not involved.</br>  <br>And when did that happen?</br>  <br>When Kazuki told him "Tsukasa, you have to sign the documents. Isla is your responsibility now"<br><br>Either episode 11 or 12</br></br></br>  <br>Ah ok so you are guessing he just used her body again. Well that's your opinion and with that ending you can go with whatever you want but that has never been confirmed in any way.</br>    Weirdly I couldn't cry during the whole episode. I felt sad as fuck but I also felt kinda content and happy with the episode, so tears were just not coming.  <br><br>/a has really bad to nonexistent short term memory, possibly wilfully because it allows for more shitposting.</br></br>  I have held off on watching this episode. And I can't get myself to spoil it for me. Tell me one thing, is there a happy end/smile coming soon™?<br>I don't know what to feel right now.</br>  <br>Just watch it anon</br>  <br>I cried more at the penultimate episode but it's still sad, you might aswell just watch it if you've come this far.</br>  You guys should just stop with this stupid discussion of who his new partner is, it isn't obviously her or not her because it's supposed to be ambiguous, if it wasn't then they'd have just shown who it was. You can just as easily say that Tsukasa reacted the way he did because it wasn't her or because he signed off on the OS replacement and wasn't surprised to see her. If you really want to get into it they're probably just waiting to decide if it is or isn't in case the do S2 or an OVA.<br><br>Personally, I'd prefer it wasn't her because Tsukasa saw how hard it was for Eru to be with Andie, and it would set this weird tint over their relationship because Tsukasa would basically be saying that he just wanted her body. Plus it would kind of go against the whole theme of being able to say goodbye.<br><br><br>Every season is a lackluster season. If you actually went through and made a list of the seasons where a large majority of shows weren't flavor of the season shit that were forgotten a few months later then it would be a pretty slim list.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This was the part that made me tear up the most.</br>  <br>One of the best ending Episodes for a long time. Just watch it. It will be painful but there is a smile in the end so it's not pure suffering.</br>  <br> he's probably too small for her. <br>This statement is not compatible with the headcannon /a/ seems to have largely agreed on regarding Zakku's Zakku.<br><br> straight_shotacon <br> huge_penis <br> shotadom <br> stomach_bulge <br> excessive_cum <br> ahegao <br> harem <br> mindbreak </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br> The ending didn't really do it for me in terms of making me sad enough to cry.  <br> Maybe because the early shelf life reveal for Isla and how no miracles can occur braced me for that. <br><br>same here <br><br>they killed the tragic effect so all we can do is just brace for the slow motion train wreck</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The sheer amount of vaginal stretching she would have to do to accommodate his girth, anon.</br>  <br> tfwsheseeshisdick.jpg </br>  TOO BAD SHE WON'T LIVE<br><br>BUT THEN AGAIN, WHO DOES?</br></br>   Robot <br> Alive </br>  <br>if it can resist rape, it's alive</br>  <br>I shed a tear once in one of the first episodes, when they retrieve the first giftia. I felt really saddened because its family looked like they cared about it so much.<br><br>To be honest, I laughed sometimes when watching the final episode because things were going precisely like I thought they would.<br>I'm sorry but 13 episodes watched in a 3 months span are not enough to make me grow that emotionally attached to the characters, especially not in an anime like this that kept on switching from sad scenes to bad jokes in the most inappropriate moments.<br><br>I felt like the drama was always spot on, but that's it. Can't think of much else that was good.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So it is just if you live alone with your pet and it is dying, only if it could talk.<br><br>Then you get a new pet.</br></br></br>  <br>PM deserves a 6++/10 for having an ending better than bad/worst expectation possible<br> It's the story settings that minimize the extent of decent ending creation </br></br>  Let us remember the fun times.  <br><br>Is allahu ackbar Isla on Jewtube? The ones I've found there are shittier than the one that got posted here frequently.</br></br>  <br>Yeah that's not like it at all. Sure you will eventually get over your loss but simply getting a new one will never replace the memories you had with the old one. That was the whole point of the Series. Enjoying the time you have with your loved ones because they won't be around forever.</br>  <br>I'd love a spin-off type thing with just this kind of stuff.</br>  <br>Do retards like you not understand that it makes no difference if its a new Giftia in Airas old body or a new Giftia in a different body?<br><br>It's like you haven't watched the show and just tuned in for the last episode.</br></br></br>  <br>Gone out of your memories also?</br>  Shit, after he said the thing about hoping she'll be reunited with the one she loves, I SO thought that it was going to end with Tsukasa going to work like a year or two later and randomly bumping into Isla ;_;  <br> The sequence from sol-&gt;Psycho Pass-like scene-&gt;rom com is messy to me <br> Expected better ending, or it's just my personal dissatisfaction <br> Fewer stories directly related to other important characters(unless this is rom com with fewer story length) <br> The thing they might have to change the most:   The no-turning-back story setting </br></br></br></br>  <br>S2 maybe </br>     Channel 4's latest hit drama Humans is based on a Scandinavian series called Akta Manniskor (Real Humans). <br> However, the Swedish version features several sexual encounters between humans and machines which will not feature in the remake, while scenes featuring nudity have been toned down. <br>Just like my robololifucktoys.</br></br>  <br>Diamonds.</br>  <br>a perfect wife wouldn't die before you</br>  <br> tfw no robowife to do the laundry wearing a wet shirt </br>  <br>This is pretty much the same as the ontological argument for the existence of God, though.</br>  You know, I had my trope counter set to maximum watching this and thought I had the entire fucking anime pegged for everything it was going to do, and the counter was going up and up and everything was being flawlessly executed by the "writers" for a typical anime of this caliber, then that fucking ENDING... I actually and honestly did not see it happening. I felt kinda bad.  It was a boring ending and not sad  <br> god wouldn't die before you </br>  the last episode was directed very well.<br><br>the ending of Shigatsu wasn't this powerful. somehow you just couldn't cry with Kirameki blaring in the background. here, they used silence very well and let the context just sink in.</br></br>  I'm going to miss her.  ;_; <br><br> I hope at least they do a proper follow up sometime in the future.</br></br>   Who else fucking died here? I was already crying like a bitch and this just dialed it up to 11. The irony of being happy that he's crying for her kills me.   <br>i lost it when the whole asspull drama began, boring as fuck</br>  I teared up, but I didn't get too attached to Isla.<br><br>come on, she's a Giftia.</br></br>  <br>I think I became a little too much attached to her, it's been 2 days and I'm still a little messed up.</br>  feet of the season  <br> it's been 2 days and I'm still a little messed up <br>Really nigger</br></br>  <br><br> I would only watch it if Tsukasa and Michiru end up together. <br><br>You people make me sick in a way I can't even express.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the limit is our understanding and capability of working with the physical limits of the known laws of the universe for the materials used.<br><br>That's why we're trying to figure out the whole variable quantum state cpu thing.</br></br></br>  <br>Me 2</br>  <br>those feet are hot, but aren't they kind of fat for her</br>    <br>She was an action girl, so she needed soft yet strong feet for better agility.</br>  <br>yet it's kind of dumb that they never showed how good she was when her limiters were off.<br><br>that one episode didn't really do it.</br></br></br>  <br>Ain't it state that Isla has already pasted her prime from the get-go? So even with limiters off she couldn't be any more spectacular than she used to be at the peak that we never saw.</br>  The ending was too bland. I didn't want an asspull where she survives, but it needed something. <br><br>Pleiades's ending made me cry, Plastic Memories just had me going "okay."</br></br>  Status: Forgiven of all wrong doings  <br>i think i love chu-tan more than you</br>  <br>I think i love her a bit more than you, just a bit</br>   you'll never find an abandoned nya-tan in a box   <br>She's had everyone inside, the filthy rat.</br>  <br>thank god.</br>  Young Adult Rin is too cute.<br><br> So is her HF epilogue appearance </br></br>  <br>Only the Fate VN, I will get round to the others though.<br><br><br><br>Already watched DEEN but was smart enough to avoid the film, thank you both.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The UBW movie is good for a laugh though.

I just watched F/0 not knowing there was so much more in the setting</br>  <br>DEEN Fate is worth watching if you really want to see more of Fate/Stay Night animated.</br>  Itoko...  <br>I know right. Well, many other novels get fucked over by editors/publishers. At least in this case the author had enough balls to give us the real ending either way, even if extra-officially.</br>  <br>That implies I even bothered watching more than a quarter of this trite shite.</br>  <br>Go away, Aiz</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YxR<wbr>qudRzIsM</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Post the ost.  Here's how I would fix Penguin Drum.<br>1. Remove pink guy<br>2. Remove Momoka<br>3. Remove muh terrorism, parents died of a car accident instead<br>4. Remove 2deep4u shit<br>5. Anime is now about Ringo and her wacky stalker shenanigans</br></br></br></br></br>  Remove the last 5ish episodes when everything went too deep. It was a great ride until then.  <br>Remove OP.</br>  <br> if there were actual substance <br>Is this the scapegoat penguindrum thread for all the retards that don't understand anythinf</br></br>  <br>eat shit</br>  How to fix Penguindrum:<br><br>1.

Nor is the third season of Yuru Yuri, or the second season of Non Non Biyori, or the third season of Haruhi, or...</br></br>  <br><br>and we'll keep posting them again and again. What's your point?</br></br>  Remember when Narutards were only allowed to have one thread a week?<br><br>All the Narutards crying here are obvious newfags that came to /a/ after the ending last year and don't know about this.</br></br>  <br>the two gayest characters are essentially background now. it is fine.</br></blockquote>]
