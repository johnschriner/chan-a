She mentions she never knew it had those kind of powers/curses on it before, and also it sounds chunni as shit</br>  I just noticed that whenever possible players are mentioned, it's always in groups. Like the six gods or the eight greed kings or thirteen heroes. It sounds to me like it's individual guilds getting transferred over.<br><br>Too bad Papa Bones is a lonely skellington.</br></br>  <br>Rolling for Demon Lord to join up.</br>    <br>The fuck is a chunni</br>  <br>Had they all logged in, Momonga would probably have convinced some to stay on until the very end and whoosh, there'd be more than just him now.<br><br>One of the dragon's specialty is turning players against each other. Wonder how that's going to work with Papa Bones. Without a WC item, turning the Guardians against him is nigh impossible.</br></br></br>    <br>lets do this</br>  <br>Alright lets go faggots.</br>  <br>You know how you wanted to be something nonsensical like a T-Rex or Harry Potter as a kid? Well a chunii is someone that nevr grew out of that phase and still spouts stupid shit like "Witness my Flames of Obliteration, mirrors of my dark soul!" well into his teens and adult life.</br>  <br>TOMB KING REPORTING FOR ACTION</br>  <br>But these people can actually pull off flames of obliteration.</br>  Ayy fucking finally lmao<br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>13399</wbr></br>  <br>She doesn't and that's why it's funny.<br><br>She's a cleric with a dark power sword and great warrior but she still wants to pretend she has a cursed evil energy and dark flames and all that shit when she doesn't.</br></br></br>  <br>As long as I'm a cute grill, I'll just charm my way out of any situation :3c</br>  <br><br>Technically this is a lie while also being correct</br></br>  <br><br>I still don't see what's up with the princess but i'<br>d kill her anyway since they are hammering us over the head that something is wrong with her</br></br></br>  <br>rolling as slime</br>  <br>Well as long as she isnt telling people its ok. Reading it it seems like they overheard her talking to herself.</br>  <br><br>I WANNA BE THE GUY</br></br>  <br>Her faith seems iffy for a cleric with this fascination of dark powers.<br><br>Honestly holy power doesn't even make sense to me most of the time. Can anyone that plays enough tabletop explain what holy damage is? I can understand healing and how it can damage undead, but what the hell is going on when holy damage hits a non-undead. I can't even fathom how it can be translated to reality.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I was pumped but he's probably only a little bit stronger than iguava. can beat maids and thats about it</br></br>  <br>God smites people in the bible. That's basically what holy damage is. Divine retribution striking people dead.<br><br>I would agree that it's pretty vague, but that's how it is.</br></br></br>  <br>Gods wreck people all the time. They just wreck undead more.</br>  <br>Yeah, I just don't like how it has no analog to anything in reality so it's hard to imagine.<br><br>I always try to see it as either physical construct of light hitting something like green lantern rings or a burning light.</br></br></br>  <br> Her faith seems iffy for a cleric with this fascination of dark powers. <br><br>Again, that's why it's funny. This is a universe where you can gain dark power but she's not actually pursuing that, she's just being silly chuuni about it for fun.<br><br>As far as holy power/damage goes it's literally asking your chosen deity/source of holy power to add some FUCK YOU to whatever thing you're trying to attack. Depending on the system sometimes it doesn't modifying attacks against a non evil enemy but most of the time it's just another damage modifier that just happens to effect evil/undead more than it would a neutral creature. Just imagine it like adding fire damage or something to an attack but it has the added effect of doing 4X damage on undead and shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also a maid and total qt.<br>All the girls are top tier semen demons.</br></br>  <br><br>Basically pic-related</br></br>  <br> Ninya <br> Lukeluther <br> Peter <br> Dyne <br>Nevar forget ;_;7</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I just don't like how it has no analog to anything in reality so it's hard to imagine. <br><br><br>It's easier to imagine than "arcane" damage and shit. Still, sometimes it takes the form of light or fire or lightning but that doesn't necessarily mean that's what it feels like when you're getting hit by it.</br></br></br></br>   people in the New World using MMO lingo <br><br>that's kind of neat, im guessing some of the players became kings or some shit and propogated that shit</br></br>  <br><br> grasping her right hand <br> rings on all fingers <br> talks with her dark personality <br> darkness powers <br> darkness <br>comeon</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They were easily forgettable as far as killed off characters go. <br><br>Most of their interactions were just talking to Ainz and I don't think we ever got internal dialogue from any of them. They were also only there for a short time and were absent for like half the time they traveled with Momon. <br><br>Really easy to kill off overall. Compare that literally anyone else from the LIzardmen on and you can see how little you should honestly care about their deaths.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Magic doesn't have an analog to real life either though. Especially not "dark magic/energy".<br><br>I think of it mostly like a really focused ray of light from the sun, almost like a laser except sunlight. The reaction a vampire would get from normal sunlight, i.e. being scorched.<br><br><br>Aye, but I'm still not feeling people with "martial arts" (hoping for a better translation tbh) "activating skills". Sounds retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ninya <br>Male or female?</br></br>  They need to introduce some more players soon. Not that I don't mind Momongas rape train, but he needs some real adversaries.  <br>They all dudes. They even talk about how having a girl would be weird with them all probably wanting to fuck.</br>  <br>Sure, but they were nice and relatable, and didn't deserve to go like that. I liked them.<br><br><br>Male.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hah, you're in for a surprise.</br>  <br>I've liked arcane as a damage type, it's just pure mana that hasn't been filtered or transformed into another element. Sure we can't imagine what the damage feels like, but that's an issue with the lack of magic in our world and not that the concept is incorrect.</br>  <br>I think it was impactful because it was the first time in the series people we;d spent some time with ended up dead. Good people. Carne village was filled with good people but we were never formally introduced to them the way we were with the Swords. It was then I realized if you weren't with Nazarick, whether good or evil, your life expectancy was pretty short.</br>  <br>Rolling for trickster fairy.</br>  <br>Alright, I've been grinding since .<br>It's finally time to beat Ainz and claim werewolf maid.</br></br>  <br>I'm actually enjoying the slow burn. No reason to rush things.<br><br><br>I guess I thought Ainz would have seen the resemblance to his own past and thought it was a bit sad that they died.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I just don't like how we're constantly shown how shit the people Ainz is cautious about are. <br><br>Like immediately after wondering who the fuck the group that MC'd Chair were we get to here a testimony from one of the guys how the super secret strongest person in their entire group could probably beat Chair without gear with the implication being that Shalltear with her armor and lance would fucking murder her so there's another group who we know aren't a threat.</br></br></br>  <br>Surprise for what they're all dead</br>  <br><br>MC's pretty busy building his kingdom. Any player introduced in the current timeline is going to have to face Ainz and his kingdom. I actually prefer the players to have been in the past myself.</br></br>  <br>In the web novel Ninya stays a dude</br>  <br>Rolling for Muscle Wizard</br>  <br>Stronk chiken</br>  <br> 29 <br>Haha my pranks shall be mildy annoying.</br></br>  <br> How did a vampire loli get into Blue Rose? </br>  <br>You could turn them against each other if they thought it was to protect Ainz or if they somehow made the order seem like it came from their creator.</br>  So I think we can all agree that Papa Bones is Neutral Evil at this point, right?  this show any good?  <br>They're not going to buy it.</br>  <br>no.</br>  <br>Some of the strongest human warriors are at level 30, so it's not like you're underpowered.<br><br><br>I like it a lot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Round 2 rollan.</br>  <br>That part always tripped me out.</br>  <br>Then what do you suggest?</br>  <br>Since martial arts aren't from Yggdrasil and it does seem kind of wierd that people would have skills they can activate by calling them out, what are the chances of it just being from another dead MMO system?</br>  <br>That does seem plausible to me. Otherwise it's kinda weird.</br>  <br>Rolling for Broken Level Hamster Wizzard</br>  <br>roll</br>  <br> Holy fuck</br>  <br><br>I would file it under standard jap move calling.<br>That or they copied people calling spell names.</br></br></br>  <br>Rolling to Lich King</br>  <br>Don't worry, once Ainz subjugates the weak humans he'll have to contend with the non-humans of the world.

And of course if any of the "Twenty" show up that alone can put even fairly weak humans on par with floor guardians.</br>  <br><br>00 is GM</br></br>  <br>I WILL EAT YOU</br>   “Realize now, Shalltear. You face Ainz Ooal Gown, with the combined might of all 41 Supreme Beings. From the beginning, you had no chance of victory.“ <br><br>This gave me a boner</br></br>  So, are we getting lizardmen or opening trolling us?<br> I'd vote for the troll </br>  <br>Troll for sure</br>  <br>It's a troll. Frost Pain isn't even on there.</br>  <br>Rolling for a bowfag.</br>  <br>She had a pretty good chance of victory and his strategy relied on him being 80% close to losing. <br><br>If anything that fight, despite Ainz being at a MASSIVE disadvantage, goes to show that Ainz is barely stronger than the floor guardians without loads of prep time.</br></br></br>  <br>Or that almost all of his skills are ineffective on undead races with lifesteal.</br>  <br>Well the Floor Guardians are basically Dungeon Bosses so it's not a big surprise.</br>  <br>I think the fact that they made Shalltear do nothing and had her just stand about showed that they aren't necessarily antagonistic to Ainz. If anything, controlling her and just letting her sit in a spot that was obvious is really a sign of good faith I think.</br>  So, does Ainz ever take a ton of NPCs from Nazarick to go on a jolly adventure together? I couldn't be arsed to read past the first book yet, shit's kinda tiresome.  <br>I keep saying she would have won but for aura interfering.</br>  <br>The lifesteal mechanic wasn't even really that big a deal to the overall fight since he wasn't even really doing chip damage until the very end and her getting into melee with him meant he was fucked even without that.<br><br>The undead thing isn't the only problem, if you have any mechanic to avoid instant death (which was readily apparent in the MMO) he was gimped to shit.</br></br></br>  <br>They didn't make her do anything because she mortally wounded the old lady who mind controlled her before she could give any orders.</br>  <br>They didn't. She murdered the shit out of the others and put the World Item user into a catatonic state before they could do anything more with the mind control.</br>  <br>You know that the level 95 fire elemental that took a good amount of time for Mare and Aura to kill? Ainz probably has multiples of those and can also summon thousands of skeletons endlessly. Any other guardian would be wittled to shit.<br><br>Honestly, if Ainz didn't actually need to kill Shalltear, she would have no way to get to Ainz through his summons.</br></br></br>  <br>Or you can also say that Ainz just soloed a Raid boss.<br>Said like that, it holds another meaning</br></br>  <br>That would be complicated. They're extremely dependent upon Ainz. And making them fight each other would be complicated, unless they managed to make they think that their companions are trying to betray Ainz, and they acted before consulting him.</br>  <br>Meant to quote </br>  <br> Cocytus using four weapons <br><br>He says the he only uses one because otherwise it would stomp. Also, he usually fights only with 2.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh I do not think the King will stop with things such as meddling.</br>  <br>The fire elemental was level 80 wasnt it? And he only summoned that with the guild staff.</br>  <br>We technically see only two weapons.<br>Dual wielding doesn't necessary means one on each side</br></br>  <br>That doesn't matter. Shalltear is good for crowd control. If you just add minions that are weaker than her, you're only helping her, thanks to being an undead she's resistant to most types of damage, and will lifesteal their hp bars.</br>   The whole everything with Shalltear vs Papa Bones <br> Everything after it <br>What an awesome fight, and then so many feels for lonely Ainz.</br></br>  <br>He takes best maid out for some adventuring.</br>  <br>That's why I'm saying that just because Shalltear hard counters Ainz, the other guardians don't necessarily match up to him.<br>Ainz can probably easily defeat any of the other guardians.</br></br>  <br><br>The only troll here is that after adapting vol 1, the anime is going to get rushed as fuck animate up to volume 8.</br></br>  <br>It really doesn't because we never get a gauge on how competent the parties invading Naz were. We're told she could take on a full group of 6 and some more but there's really no comparison on how good the people invading ever were. <br><br>If you really want to compare shit to the old game it means that the guardians are so shit that a single above average player (and I quote "middle of the high tier") with a joke RP build and small use of cash shop items was able to solo her meant she's overall not impressive (as far as we're just comparing every endgame thing from the NPCs to players) with most of his moves being useless and his final gambit being "use the shitty spell to job change and auto attack her".<br><br><br>That would only put her at even more of a disadvantage. She even summons shit for herself to kill while her Eidolon tanked Ainz (which he needed to use his ultimate shit to stop anyway). Adding the summons (which we're told how many relevant things he can summon anyway) only helps her in the long run and the fire elemental that A) was shit and B) could only be used by using the guild staff which he would never take out was better than any of the undead he's summoned before. Turning that into a prolonged fight would have been even shitter since he role is to be a drawn out tank fight.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well to be a threat to papa bones you either need to be a lvl.100 priest or a lvl.100 paladin. pretty much nothing else is a threat. maybe a lvl.100 mage. the problem all 3 run into is the NPCs in the tomb are all raid level boss characters, and all have varying strength which make a papa bones busting character sorta gimped for dealing with the npc horde. <br><br>I'll roll a paladin. they're fun to play even if you aren't taking on undead lichkings</br></br></br>  <br>Ainz's build relies heavily on using his summons as meatshields/support, and his Unholy/Instant-Death Spells. Against Shalltear using Summons is stupid because she can lifesteal off of them, and his Unholy spells don't work on her because she's Undead.</br>  <br> It really doesn't because we never get a gauge on how competent the parties invading Naz were. <br><br>It wasn't so much how competent the raiding party was, It has to do with the quality of the gear they used. Shalltear has divine class gear, at least for the spear.</br></br></br>  <br>The other guardians all have other shit to avoid instant death mechanics and even though they mention that Chair is probably "stronger" than the others that the difference in strength is minimal enough that any two guardians fighting together would easily kill her fast.<br><br>I don't think Ainz would lose to any guardian shown thus far (honestly Pandora's Actor maybe) but really the "major disadvantages" he had against Chair were easily negated by the huge amount of preptime he had to where any floor guardian would be a hard enough fight.</br></br></br>  <br>ayyyy</br>  Gotta build my own Nazarick for that pathfinder game. That still needs ~2 more players.<br><br>Advice on design?</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't say easy, but Shalltear is the only guardian that could realistically beat him.  Hell, the only reason he won was because he used his superior spell casting strength as a diversion to burn through Shalltear's MP and skills, and then took it to a melee fight with a bunch of OP weapons. Had the situation changed even a bit, Ainz would have had even more difficulty, or lose right out </br>  <br>Rollin to capture and  sexually bully  Narberal<br><br>60+ pls</br></br></br>  <br>The only reason he won at all was because of aura fucking with the fight.</br>    <br>True, the last second hesitation very nearly cost him the entire battle, damn Papa Bones and his sentimental heart or bone</br>  <br>It was upper 80s. And yeah he didn't use his regular divine items and AoG during that fight.</br>  <br>He should have taken PA. Taking Narbel was the worst decision of his life.</br>  <br>Ainz can beat any of the Floor Guardians relatively easy, compared to Shalltear, since she is specifically built to be his counter.</br>  <br>Why is narberal so cute and useless?<br><br>I don't understand how she pulls it off.<br><br>I don't even want to fuck her. I just want to hang out with her and talk.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What did she do? I forgot. I however remember that the whole fire/resist and faking his hp bar were more important overall.</br></br>  <br>Makes me wonder how large groups could have trouble with a floor guardian if a single lv 100 can handle them. Even if Ainz is upper/mid tier it sees like the first few floors can easily be put on farm status by actually competent players.</br>  <br>Rolling for regular human spear-user.</br>  <br>She psyched out Shalltear when she was going in to finish Ainz.</br>  <br>Rolling for duel wield shield.</br>  <br>I cant remember 100% But when ainz hesitated she did something to distract shaltear before she could land the deathblow.</br>  <br>And yet it took 1500 of them to actually make a meaningful raid on the tomb.</br>  <br>She isn't built to be his counter. She has anti death resistances and beyond that she has a good class match up but that's it. <br><br>If you give any sort of anti instant death then Ainz is looking at a fight that's really not any different from the Chair fight.<br><br><br>At the very last blow Aura gave off a weird Aura that made Chair hesitate just a moment longer than Ainz did.<br><br><br>Well it wasn't just the floor guardians. You had to deal with any entire zone of enemies and traps, Ainz was still upper tier and knew her inside and out, and despite mentioning that they liked to pretend to be the final bosses the instances with the mine and shit implies the guild would still go to PK the fuck out of people invading.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because it was never one floor guardian, it was always the guardians, their minions, and possibly the battlemaids. I'm pretty sure it was mentioned all the members of Ainz Ooal Gown waited in the throne room to meet anyone who could possibly get past. Plus I'm sure if any raids decided to stick around and farm one of the floors, the guild members would show up to take them out since they aren't doing it the right way, or other floor guardians/minions would show up to corner them or chase them off. But then again, you have to remember Shalltear was the first floor guardian, so she probably decimated any invading forces with her offensive power, and the raids decided to continue on rather than sit around and wait for Shalltear to be brought back.</br>  <br>Full Divine Gear.<br><br>People seem to be stuck in the mindset that YGGDRASIL endgame is like WoW's endgame. Where as long as you have a good guild that'll actually carry you, even a total scrub can get somewhat decent raid gear in literally like a week.<br><br>Based on the description that even if you include the hardcore players, the average level 100 had 0-1 pieces of Divine-Tier gear. I would assume YGGDRASIL is more like the p2w korean MMOs. In those, in order to get anything resembling end-game gear, you have to farm raid bosses for materials to make your gear. The catch?  The rare materials have 1/10000 drop rate on raid bosses so you're fucked unless you either land that 1/10000 chance multiple times, or you hate your money. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget pre-fight buffing, pay2win item abuse, attacking his opponent before the fight even started, using a treasure trove of high powered guild weapons he just gathered, reading up on all of Shalltear's abilities before the fight, setting mines up before the fight, wearing holy resist gear in secret, and pretending fire spells do nothing to him. With so many dishonorable tactics in a 1v1 fight it's no wonder he succeeded.</br>  <br> She used Sky Eye to spy on Shalltear and give off murderous intent to distract her for a split second long enough for Ainz to break the hourglass </br>  <br>A true pvp p2w god.</br>  <br>I don't think we'll be allowed to make non euclidean and nonsensical level transitions like that.</br>  <br>Rolling for skelly brawler</br>  <br>It's kinda sad how poorly she does at blending in with humans given her race. But then again she is only a level 1 doppelganger.</br>  <br>And from what we know, practically all the big names of Ainz Ooal Gown threw tons of money at the game, Ainz himself once spent all his money on trying to get a super rare ring.</br>  <br>Dont forget dropping two super magic spells on her.</br>  I wonder if fighter classes had a skill that let them turn into spell casters, like how spell casters have Perfect Warrior  <br>Aw yeah son, level 95 fighter, I'm ready to level castle walls and tear apart whole armies alone. Plus I still have room to grow.</br>  <br>I played FFXI with it's 0.0000001% droprates for years. Being with people that wont gank your drops or leave when they get yours and you haven't is a bigger issue than actually farming stuff.<br>There's also the fact that mulltiple guilds were higher ranked and/or stronger so it's not like there wouldn't be anyone incapable of fighting them<br><br>Then let's take the fact that everyone seems to insist that it's SO HAAARD to beat them that players all got scared away.<br>Absolute fucking Virtue didn't scare players away until Sundi accidentally revealed that it really was supposed to take 12+ hours to fight and there wasn't some super secret trick to drop it down to a reasonable time we couldn't discover. Sure the motivation to beat it was more of a fuck you to the devs but you underestimate just how hard players will throw themselves at a challenge.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didnt they change Absolute virtue anytime someone found a way to feasibly beat it?</br>  <br>I live to serve papa bones.</br>  <br>Roll</br>  <br> fighters <br> able to do anything at max level </br></br>   DON'T YOU GIVE ME YOUR LOVE N PASSION   <br>Touch Me was literally unkillable for a while.</br>  <br> 12 hours straight dealing with shitty MMO gameplay <br><br>Dunno how the fuck people would willingly submit to that torture.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't talk shit about Touch Me</br>  <br>Yeah.<br>To be fair the first few times were from people experimenting so much they found random as fuck glitches to exploit.<br>I mean seriously. Who honestly expects to discover that you can become invulnerable to the strongest being in the game via catching yourself in a cutscene at a spot halfway across your current map section?<br>Plus the Wall of Justice where players would nuke it from above while it couldn't reach high enough to hit them.<br>The first time it died it didn't have drops because they put some obscene monster in the game without expecting players to kill it.(How do you get that lazy?)<br><br>Noone could actually fathom that it was SUPPOSED to take that long. Everyone thought that they were just missing some obvious in retrospect trick to make it from impossible fight to a reasonable but difficult fight. That's why that Pandemonium Warden fight managed to keep the players in for so long. Noone could believe that there was anyone Sadistic enough to make something like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 12+ hours to figh <br><br>Let's be real here, was it fun?</br></br></br>  <br>He's concerned about his subordinates going on a killing spree. <br><br>Nevertheless, he's willing to sacrifice Nazarick if he can make sure that he can get away with his children. However, this is unlikely, given how formidable Nazarick actually is.</br></br></br>  <br>Ever played a game for 12 hours straight? Feels like you're slowly rotting away, falling and falling ever more.</br>  <br>I wonder if he only cares about the floor guardians or if he plans on taking the battlemaids and lower level NPCs and even a few skellingtons.</br>  <br>If 1500 players and NPCs attacking couldn't conquer Nazarick, I doubt anything in the New World below a godly being could take the tomb.</br>  <br>He cares about what was actually made by the guild.<br><br>The generated NPCs can all fuck off for how much he cares</br></br></br>  <br>I once played for 30+ hours straight back when I was in high-school.<br><br>I was fine all the way through but when I actually stopped and went to sleep I felt like dying.</br></br></br>  <br>Nazarick is a testament to endgame hoarding. He has enough legendary weapons hoarded away to equip a small army, much less the Divine weapons that many of the defenders seem to have.<br><br>This is not counting the mountains of high-end material most endgame guilds obtain over the course of just a year, much less 10. Ainz also has an advantage in that he's essentially a adult from the future; he has far more schooling than most individuals in the New World. He isn't like the demon lord and hero from Maoyuu, whom have to politicize their way to impose reforms; his minions essentially do anything he asks, alongside the perks of being mostly immortal monsters.</br></br></br>  <br>He cares about what was made by his old comrades, since they are like the children of his friends</br>  <br> goblin club </br>   DON'T YOU GIVE ME YOUR LOVE AND PASSION   <br>The only reason they lost was floor 8.<br><br>If they found a way to ignore Victim (and if the secret NPCs like the miko/Lastborn/Rubedo or whatever combination of them are each other aren't that amazing) then they would have beaten the tomb completely and even the guild itself would have lost.<br><br>Really if they all got together and tried again they would have won but Victim just fucking ruined everyone's day so much.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I DON'T WANT OUR SOULS TO LET GO </br>  So, is there a way for Ainz to actually bone Albedo and Shalltear, with him being a skeleton and all? I'm sure this topic was probably discussed at length already.

I'm actually curious</br>  The general seems so much more peaceful right now.  <br>Probably because everyone moved to the WWD.</br>  <br>Pretty much.<br>Could you draw some more cute/lewd lolis in the meantime, Heikatsu?</br></br>  <br>Honestly I kind of wish I could move my requests from the WWD to the general, even if I could I don't want double dipping shitposting because all the meta shit from that thread drags into the general during the week.</br>  This poster from Hostel 1 but with Shion from Higurashi holding the chainsaw and wearing that mask. Make sure she is wearing the attached maid outfit. <br><br>It says:<br>“Ni-Pah!” <br>-Rika <br><br>Ryukishi7 presents:<br>"Higurashi"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The general is the best during the weekends.</br>  <br> Could you draw some more cute/lewd lolis in the meantime, Heikatsu? <br>Sure thing! I can try to draw some stuff later today when I'm less busy.<br><br> the meta shit from that thread drags into the general during the week. <br>The WWD is kind of awful.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I was one of the people who told you you'd be better off doing deliveries in the general where you'll probably be appreciated more for what you were delivering there. <br><br>How's it been working out for you anyway?</br></br></br>  <br> So close. </br>  <br>awesome, man. I'll look forward to it.</br>  Requesting Louise walking funny after spending the night with Thickus Dickus and Biggus Dickus  Requesting moe maids! Tripping over, spilling water, soda, etc while screaming KYAAAA GOMEN NASAI  Now that I think about it, a maid cafe with different anime gals would be nice...  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128225109 <br>Get my tabs mixed up, every time.</br>  <br>Well  yeah .  From this point on I want her to run into more people, interact with various deities and mythical creatures.  I've got an end in mind.  </br>  Requesting Kanna and Yuu in cute swimsuits kissing underwater like in Sakura Trick  <br>Cool, I wonder if you ever thought of her running into other yurus</br>  <br>Yeah that will definitely happen  as long as artist stay interested heheh </br>  <br>Well I have to say that I've been enjoying the work people put into your requests. Hope enough drawdudes are still interested in finish it!</br>  <br>I've been lucky that some really talented people have been picking them up. And thanks so do I</br>  Hey OR, just wanted to let you know that I'm working on this, is taking longer than I expected but I'm quite busy and I'm trying not to rush, otherwise it wouldn't be as good  Requesting Yamcha and Maron cuddling together.  <br>Holy shit, those details.<br>Not OR, but good going.</br></br>  <br> going nuts on the goggles <br><br>I understand, metal stuff is fun to paint.</br></br></br>   tfw when the best request you got from this drawthread was of a character you eventually despised   <br> While bulma isn't looking. </br>  <br>With gape and cum drip still in effect.</br>  <br>Sweet mother of god! Take as much time as you need, that looks absolutely perfect!</br>  Requesting Snail and Bat in extremely skimpy bikinis like the girls on the left have.<br><br>http://i.imgur.com/7NGI7jF.jpg</br></br>  <br>I get the superslut part, but the milf?</br>  <br><br>Okay finally back, heres one I did while testing some new brush settings. <br><br><br>Posting more in the general? Worked out fine I guess.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lines look really clean. If you're still in a drawing mood, have you ever done Hachikuji? Lewds of her are surprisingly scarce.</br>  <br>nice.<br>all I can note is that her butt seems to look kinda tiny perspective wise compared to her head.</br></br>  <br> Dat loli-vagina <br>Holy shit muh dick. You must be some sort of Semen-Sorcerer to make my cum shoot out so fast at such force like that. Not OR but you are my nigga, younger looking lolis never get drawn.</br></br>  <br>Fantastic loli as usual. Looking forward to whatever you do next. <br><br>Something with some bulges hopefully.</br></br></br>  Requesting Aisha hugging Jim from behind while wearing nothing but an oversized shirt and underwear, and Jim is noticeably embarrassed by it.<br><br>This isn't a good request for the waifu thread is it?</br></br>  <br>I agree. Its all teens people try to pass off as loli. Could use some more younger lolis from time to time.</br>  Requesting a redrawn version of this, this time, colored, it doesn't have to be too fancy, just good enough so i can post it on other threads.  <br>Thanks. <br>I'm surprised there are so few lewds of her, since shes so popular. I'm not terribly fond of her so the chance i'll draw her is very slim, sorry. <br><br><br>Thanks, Noted. I completely agree, there are a lot of small issues I have with it. I will work on making the butt a little larger but other problems I probably will not change since its just a quick drawing and not something I terribly care about. "Fixed" version will be posted to my pixiv. <br><br><br><br>No prob. Glad you enjoyed it.<br> younger looking lolis never get drawn. <br>It's a real shame, honestly. Rest assured though I'm not afraid to take drawing requests of younger characters.<br><br><br> Something with some bulges hopefully. <br>Same here stomach bulges are great, I'm staying up late tonight, I'll do some more drawings definitely.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You ever looking for requests feel to say so. I don't typically request lewd stuff in these threads unless people offer. Looking forward to tonight with the more good stuff.</br>  <br>I wish I could request you, but publicly requesting lewd of my waifu is like impossible for me.</br>  <br> Looking forward to tonight with the more good stuff. <br>Go ahead and request if you feel like it. Whether I choose to take on the request or not is uncertain. Depends on the request and if I feel like doing it or not. If you have a request, post it, if i dont accept it im sure somebody else will. <br><br><br> publicly requesting lewd of my waifu is like impossible for me. <br>Why?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Illya getting  DP? </br>  <br><br>how about something cute for an aside?</br></br>  <br> Why? <br>I get extremely uncomfortable up to the point of anxiety when I attempt to.<br> Guess I must be a literal faggot. </br></br></br>  <br> Go ahead and request if you feel like it. Whether I choose to take on the request or not is uncertain. <br>Well yeah. Its just a preference of mine not to request that sort of thing blind. Plus I'm not really sure what kind of stuff you are okay with. How obscene you are okay with being and that sort of thing. <br><br>Of course you can always just pass on it, thats a given. <br><br>I guess as a request<br><br><br>These Monogatari girls sharing a large dildo, with bulge.<br><br>You can age them down a bit if you want. Actually might be kind of interesting.<br><br><br>But as I said, not knowing how obscene you are okay with or how young or old you like to go its hard to choose one request and I would hate to post a whole bunch like a greedy asshole.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Double points? On her capital cash back card?</br>  <br>I'm not sure if its the same thing as you, but I am honestly a little emotionally invested in most /a/ lolis I can think of to be okay with porn of them. And hell, even girls that aren't lolis but have loli body types, like Taiga, who is just made for sex, are a little hard to ask for porn of just because I have grown attached to them.<br><br>I don't know why, but /a/ related lolis I just get attached to.</br></br></br>  <br>A lolified Nadia getting spitroasted by two large cocks. I really don't like her so that would be an incredibly pleasant thing to see.</br>  <br>Oh, I don't actually have any problem with lewds of my waifu. I just can't publicly request lewds of her.</br>  <br><br> Please forgive me for this redirect, I don't usually do this sort of thing I swear.  No worries if you don't pick it up</br></br>  <br>Not the same thing then. Like I try and fap to porn of some girls like Taiga, or the Monogatari girls, and I can't do it unless its really sweet and happy porn. Anything else and I just get upset and have to stop. As pathetic as that is.</br>  <br>Why are Japanese animals so incredibly sexual?</br>  <br>fucking kekd</br>  <br>It's the nature of all Japanese things, it can't be helped.</br>  Requesting Noriko and Jung doing topless symetrical docking.

How obscene you are okay with being and that sort of thing. <br>There isn't really a limit on obscenity. I don't draw guro though.<br>I'm no expert at drawing (obviously) so complex requests or requests with multiple characters or detailed backgrounds and objects are less likely to be picked. <br><br><br> I am honestly a little emotionally invested in most /a/ lolis I can think of to be okay with porn of them <br>I've done deliveries of H-manga lolis in the past. Are you emotionally attached to those as well?<br><br><br>I hate her too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  May I have something sexy-lewd (such as posing nude, except keep her shoulder/head armor on) with Martei from the Mega Man X2 manga, please?  Louise, in this dress having a run in with cunt destroyer.  <br><br><br><br>Didn't feel like drawing all that extra stuff, so I just drew her lewdly masturbating.

Total Maledom, or having Hori being his pet bitch in pet-play  Rea as a futa fucking Ranko and pumping her womb full of cum<br>Rea is a partial zombie so make her have only fucking her on her mind, and power of a zombie (really strong) and her eyes are supposed to be red I do not mind balls</br>  <br>I am so alright with that, that stuff was just boring filler anyway.

It's a shame his latest comic in LO still hasnt been translated. <br><br><br> Not a fan of guro either, but sometimes you just don't know. Thats good to keep in mind. I'll try and think up some pretty obscene things then. <br>One of human kind's most precious gifts is the ability to express our imagination, even when it's lewd or offensive, you should have the right to do so. So personally I have no issues with drawing obscene lewdities. I'm still learning, so theres some things too complex for me to draw though. <br><br><br> I'd shake your hand right now if they weren't both completely covered in cum. <br>Fantastic! I'm so glad you enjoyed it. <br> this delivery is so fappable and adorable <br>I know, right? I love her expression.<br> I'm really glad I bit the bullet and link-redirected you. <br>Huh? I don't understand. What do you mean?<br> Your lolis that are actually lolis instead of the usual "lolis" that are just teenagers <br>Ah, yes.

I haven't fucked with Digimon for like 16 years so I'm out of the loop but it could be a fun request, maybe.</br>  <br>Not really, doubt it'd be a character you'd want to draw since I'd only choose my waifu or daughteru.

People who haven't read Tsukihime, this is an actual screenshot from the first 5 minutes.</br></br></br>  <br>Yea, wait until you get to Kagetsu Tohya, do yourself a favor and just use a guide.

Beef stroganoff&gt;all.    <br> You can make beef stroganoff with other meat besides beef <br>Then it isn't beef stroganoff anymore.</br></br>  hibiki's 'I don't want to fight people' is really going to autism levels now. There are freaking corpses right in front of her!  <br><br>I love her braid<br><br>it's surely her charm point</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not her legs?</br>  <br><br>No. Though I must mention that I like the beauty mark too.</br></br>  <br>Why is that kid pretending to be an evil overlord?</br>  <br> oh shit, I've been surrounded by raging lesbians! <br> the air is ripe with the stench of bitches! </br></br>  <br><br>Her legs are probably nice, but there's too much competition with Tsubasa and Maria.</br></br>  <br>She's got the biggest hat, no one can argue with it.</br>  Daily reminder that Hibiki is still perfect and that she was willing to protect her friends but Gungnir wouldn't let her.  <br> kid <br><br>She's probably a few centuries old.</br></br></br>  <br>It looks silly on her.</br>  <br>And a new bullying potential is found</br>  <br>For now.</br>  that poor biker gang...they never stood a chance.  <br> she was willing to protect her friends but Gungnir wouldn't let her. <br>It's time to stop anon. We want to love her and say she can do no wrong, but when you happen upon an insane man killer monster while your friends are there and your first response is "I don't want to fight you!" instead of "I'm going to protect these people no matter what." Then you fucked up.</br></br>    <br>So she's a 2hu? I wonder where she got her alchemic powers.<br><br><br>10/10</br></br></br></br>  <br>Symphogear definitely has problems creating convincing villains. She doesn't need to be fought, she needs to be adopted.</br>  <br>I wanted to stay out of this ongoing autism but,<br> Hibiki punching first and asking question later <br>She never did or would do that. I bet you are one of those yuyuyu newfags because holy shit do you lose the point.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You need to create white bordering around the text, this is unreadable.<br>Or at least just use white text color.</br></br></br>  Koi no Okehazama is fucking catchy as.  so with that noise drawing they are basically telling us kanade is back 100% right?<br> the only thing left for me to die happy is mikugeah or at least a song </br>  <br> implying John Wayne Vercingetorix wasn't the most threatening animal villain ever. </br>  <br> She never did or would do that <br>And she's never knowingly put her friends in danger by not acting before, only herself. For someone who prides themselves on helping people that was a boneheaded move.<br><br> I bet you are one of those yuyuyu newfags because holy shit do you lose the point. <br>I don't need to bet on anything; you're a fucking retard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please don't bully the yuyuyus<br>I'm a yuyuyufag and I'm on your side.</br></br>  <br>Dr Ver a shit. Tougou was a more threatening anime villain.</br>  <br>I want to see her punished for it really harshly next episode. She's going to watch her friends get hurt and Miku's first kiss get stolen right in front of her, all because she refuses to fight.</br>  <br> yuyuyu <br>Yuuna never lost her determination to fist.</br></br>  <br> She's going to watch her friends get hurt and Miku's first kiss get stolen right in front of her, all because she refuses to fight. <br> NTR kiss mindwipe <br>Forget Hibiki, I'll go berserk myself. Miku doesn't deserve that after how she's stuck by Hibiki's side.</br></br></br>  <br> Tougou <br> villain </br></br>  <br>Ver needs to come back and fix all their relic problems.</br>  <br>Did you skip episode 11 or what?</br>  <br> implying she's not </br>  <br>But she did anon, that's what led to Karin's awesome fight<br><br>Tougou literally did nothing wrong</br></br></br>  We're getting new content at a good pace so far so there's always stuff to talk about. Live watch &gt; subs &gt; songs &gt; more subs &gt; previews &gt;  <br>Hibiki doesn't even care enough about Miku's feelings to try and protect herself when someone is trying to kill her. Miku should have dropped her long ago, she deserves better than Hibiki.</br>  <br>Chris pls</br>  <br>Yeah, I'm not a fan of Biki's particular style of selfishness disguised as a hero/martyr complex.</br>  <br> Tougou literally did nothing wrong </br>  <br>HAPPY HALLOWEEN</br>  DMJii are the best. Hibiki is being a little bitch and I hope she gets over it soon. I loved Hibiki in the first two seasons and I want to defend her but she was just too damn lame in the last episode.  <br>Fucked that one up majorly.  would probably be more appropriate aimed at the right person.</br>  <br>Morii please.</br>  <br><br><br>Tougou chose ending her friends horrible debilitating suffering over protecting a world that didn't care about them. It could be seen as selfish in a way, but not wrong. She had no way of knowing the Gods would say "Well ok, you tried so we'll be nice now." I loved Tougou's character. She's Homura if Homura wasn't a retard and the 3rd Madoka movie wasn't blatant sequel bait.</br></br></br>  <br> knew that the world was completely fucked no matter what the Hero Club did <br> didn't want for her friends to live out fates worse than death just so that their world could go on a few more years <br> her actions ended up scaring the Shinju enough that it decided to change the Hero System and actually give humans a chance to fight back instead of just living under siege <br> is canonically gay <br>How can one cripple be so based?</br></br></br></br></br>  Can Yuyuyu fags go back to their general thread?  <br>Tougou even admits she was wrong. Why can't people respect Tougou's opinion in this situation?</br>  Reminder that DESS is the sexiest.  &gt;&gt;&gt;/yyyg/  I love YuYuYu, but can we please stick to Symphogear in the Symphogear thread?  <br>That's the problem. There isn't one.</br>  <br>There hasn't been a YuYuYu thread in weeks and the past several Symphogear threads have been consistently shit</br>  It would be really amazing if Miku got memory wiped and just directly called Hibiki out on her bullshit because she doesn't have all the pity for Hibiki's childhood holding her back.  <br> opinion <br>Do you know what that word means?</br></br>  <br>Her transformation was great. Best part of episode 3.</br>  <br>Yuna is ten times the hero hibiki could ever be</br>    <br>Hibiki would literally break. Chris and Genjuro would groan out "Ah shit." and Tsubasa would say "I may be a sword who doesn't understand feelings, but even I can tell this shit is going to be bad."</br>  <br>Yuki Yuna was just a magical adaptation of the Protomen anyway</br>  Miku should just join any major league baseball team and become the greatest pitcher of all time.  <br>But Yuuna also didn't want to fight Tougou, and it took Karin becoming a gimp cripple to convince her that sometimes you have to fist the ones you love.</br>  <br>Don't you mean she should join the Olympic javelin team?</br>  Why is Tsubasa so cool?  <br>Anyone worth their salt could hit a straight pitch like that with their eyes closed.<br><br> I don't actually know anything about baseball. </br></br></br>  <br>She's pretty sharp.</br>  <br> Don't you mean she should join the Olympic javelin team? <br>She could do that as well.<br><br><br>Not at that speed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Secret technique</br>  <br> But Yuuna also didn't want to fight Tougou, and it took Karin becoming a gimp cripple to convince her that sometimes you have to fist the ones you love. <br>Yuuna had no idea what was going on though, and it was pretty short notice. She snapped out of it relatively quickly and ended up doing the right thing.</br></br>  Now there is a Yuyuyu thread. Go back to there yuyuyu fags.  <br> I've been here before, I've stood where you stand <br> They called me a Hero, the Hero of Man <br> But why should we save them, when they stand for nothing? <br> If they deserve life let them stand for themselves! <br>It's perfect.</br></br></br></br></br>  I still find this hilarious:<br> S1 Miku worries about Hibiki all the time <br> S2 Miku goes fun yandere because she worries too much <br> S3 Miku decides to chill and believe in Hibiki <br> Hibiki immediately fucks up on a scale she never did before  <br><br><br>Please don't throw your loved one in Babylon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, Miku is lancer then, right?</br>  <br>Yuuna also had a pretty happy and normal childhood as far as we know.<br>Hibiki is pretty fucked up, which has been established from the beginning. She's basically Shirou</br></br>  <br> She's basically Shirou <br>Shirou isn't a bitch though and neither is yuna.</br></br>  There better be one of these every episode.  <br> She's basically Shirou <br>Please stop. I don't want to believe Hibiki is that much of an idealistic 1-dimensional retard written by a chuuni hack.</br></br>  <br> How do you guys even find my art </br>  <br>Well, the writer of geah is surely chuuni, but surely no hack</br>  <br>Nobody will go there because there's nothing new to talk about until the new LN comes out<br><br>But in F/SN it's established rather strongly that Shirou's ideals are insane and at least one Bad End involves in his ideals completely taking him over and turning him into a monster.</br></br></br>  <br>You're gonna have to prove that claim.</br>  <br>Zoid's always reblogging your art.  draw more faget </br>  <br> these three as chorus girls on the final battle song </br>  <br> Final Battle devolves to a cook off.  <br> Hibiki makes Beef Stroganoff as foreshadowing </br></br>  C<br>Cute girl shows up and says she wants to suck the life out of you.

Or just being an idiot. Which is it?</br>    <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127703487 </br>  <br>I don't get it, what's the difference between DESS and DESSDESS?</br>  Even Garie is tired of Hibiki's bullshit. This week's episode was surely a lackluster, but Kirika's pole dancing transformation and musical trio from out of nowhere made it worth it, and I guess they have no other to choice but to see Ver and make him fix their gear pendants since nobody else can.  <br>DESSDESS is a full 100% increase in the amount of DESS. A DESSDESSDESS is only a 50% increase over DESSDESS and therefore less superior of an upgrade.</br>  <br>They picked up season 3 without any of the other 2, so it's basically unwatchable for anyone just starting out. They do a good job driving people away.</br>    <br> lackluster <br><br>YOU FUCKING WHAT.</br></br></br>  <br>If the bad guys are trying to make you lose faith in your reason for fighting and agree to compromise your belief in saving everyone, that's probably a sign you shouldn't.</br>  <br>good work anon you broke /a/</br>  Talkback thread<br><br>http://ayy.yal.jp</br></br>  dragonball hasn't been good since DBO.    Daily Reminder that Dragonball GT is the best series. DBZ was meh, Dragonball was shit, and DBS screams shit every episode.  HOTTU DOGGU  why is cap autistic?  <br>gib me mod</br>    LOL this is Capicoli's website etc  normie scum get out  ayyyy    joowz is dead link is not working  AYYYYYYY  <br>link doesn't work</br>  <br><br><br>joowz.org works<br><br> .org </br></br></br></br></br>    ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy  <br>Switch GT for Z and you'll be 100% right</br>  faggots someone spoonfeed me a link    <br>It's already been posted you blind fuck</br>     Super Seiya-jin God <br> Super Soiya-jin God </br>  <br>http://www.ustream.tv/channel/galax<wbr>y9000</wbr></br>  ayyyyyyyyyyyyy  <br>fuck you nigger</br>  The Kais just said that theres no purpose behind Beerus destroying things.<br><br>They got rid of the Creation vs Destruction thing?</br></br>  why dont they just change king kai's VA?<br>he's clearly too old to be doing voice acting anymore</br>  What happened?  <br>What do you mean what happened? It's not like the manga has gone downhill yet.</br>  Nigga shits getting better, mantis shrimp johj got BTFO ultra REKT by based shrimp. spider confirmed bros b4 johjs, everyone OD's.  Translator dropped it, I guess. Volume 13 released back in May.  <br>Just delayed, if I recall correctly. <br><br>I can't help but feel like interest in the manga has been kinda dwindling on /a/ (just based on how there's a lot less activity during the translation dump threads), and I can't really blame that on the anime adaptation even if it left a lot to be desired.</br></br></br>  Rock Lee probably found a ninja prostitute.  <br> but bolt won't kill I promise edge lord maybe the one to deal the finishing blow <br>Possibly, but the way I see things are likely to go down like this:<br> a bunch of dumb shit happens and for some reason the 12 year old is the ninja world's last hope <br> throws the thing <br> the thing hits Momo and does a thing that kills him <br> since it's an untested technique and his only option left he's absolved of the murder <br> they go home and throw Himawari a replacement birthday party <br>Momo's gonna die, anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kurama would probably let Bolt kick Nardo's ass <br>Sure. If it were a friendly sparring match and not a straight up murder fight, then he probably wouldn't give a fuck.</br></br>  <br>You talk about the behest of the plot when Naruto didn't use half his arsenal during the VoTE fight. All he had to do was summon Gamabunta and Naruto could have sat back and did nothing. Not to mention the fact that he used like 1 clone for sole purpose of using rasengan. Bolt is nowhere near VoTE Naruto.</br>  <br>Why not put two question marks above Mitsuki? Why do they spoil already that he is a clone or test tube boy?</br>  <br>No anon you think about it! It was a fucking sasuke with the curse seal from Oro with the sharingan. a normal sasuke would of lost, so why add in a kid who has nothing to counter the fox or can really do anything the MC can't?</br>   It's time.   <br>Prison School full of worst boys.</br>  No  So how about  It really isn't time. This season is shit.  I'm loving that bara-ness of Ushio. If Tora didn't look like he came out of a 90s comic book (and wasn't a furfag, let's be honest) I could see there being plenty of doujins where Tora forcefully 'eats' Ushio. <br><br>Does Tora have a human form and, more importantly, is it cute?</br></br>  <br>You tell me.</br>  <br>You're just being picky, anon.</br>   Why can't Rui just be loved tenderly?    <br>We see a man orgasm on-screen and this season is supposed to be shit?</br>  Which Tenkai would you Knight?  <br>Because traps deserve to suffer</br>  <br>None. They look a little underdeveloped.</br>  <br>The only thing missing this season is a decent sport series with qt boys, but other wise we got all tastes filled.</br>  Anyone else start playing this? It's an actual rhythm idol boy game.<br>Some of them are cute.</br>  <br>I like it.</br>  <br>IB is best idols</br>  When's HQ coming bach?  <br>That was a surprise.</br>  <br> this face right after while the shower soundclip was still running </br>  <br>I don' have any devices that can play the game.<br><br>Also fuck off to<br/></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  I like how this season continues to omnipander.  Would you let Leo be your tortoise knight?  <br>Watching haremshit for its guys is only going to break your heart, anon. <br> But I'm also enjoying GATE </br></br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br><br>It's a good week.</br></br>  <br>I wonder</br>  <br>Why would you assume I know what that is? <br>Is it an anime or a manga?</br></br>    <br>It's from Aichuu, a mobile rhythm game.</br>  <br>What could have been</br>  <br> that show </br>  <br>Try googling text from the card then,</br>  <br>Then fuck off to </br>   thread turning into /v/ again   <br>That author who does Oreimo doujin better deliver.</br>  <br> dat look <br> dat wet hair <br> dat everything <br>popped a boner</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm watching it for  adult characters and I love the modern military in a historical or medieval setting theme. One of my favorite anime is Zipang. </br>  <br>I wish that Ghostbusters had more than 1 cute guy in it but I'm also enjoying it.</br>  I've finally figured it out, he's just Mattsundere.  Did /a/ like K? wasn't around when it was airing but it's pretty homo. <br>Here's Green King.</br>  <br>I can't figure out which one is more dominant. He is the boss and has clearly more authority but then again sensei is older.</br>  <br> dem tiger brows </br>  I've never understood these threads.<br>It's satire right.</br>    <br>Is it on google play? I can't find it.</br>  <br>Don't forget<br> dem armpits </br></br>  <br>Just as satirical as waifu threads.<br>Which means it started out as a joke and now people mistakenly believe it's a real thing and okay.</br></br>  <br>The movie was disappointing, but I can't wait for S2. I rewatched it like 3 times.</br>  <br>Its region locked. The bitches on otome general should be able to help you get it though.</br>  <br> Shounen MC with passions outside of sports or food <br>Fucking fresh.</br></br>  <br>Maybe fucking off to /vg/ well help.</br>  <br>Also, nomination for having the most surprise homolust of the season?</br>  <br>Thanks, I'll try. I've been looking for a mobile rhythm game anyway.</br>  <br>Alright.<br>So is this shit limited to 2D. I have no idea how this works.<br>Like how lolicon doesn't translate to 3D at all, can anyone that participates in these threads explain themselves?</br></br></br>  <br> surprise <br>You should read the manga, it's pure bait.</br></br>  <br>The movie felt more like something that should have been an ova instead. Did you understand a lot of the stuff that went on in season 1? The manga has horrible art but reading in explained a lot more stuff by adding in details. It was the Green King that caused all that shit to happen in season 1.</br>  <br>Everyone on this show has brain problems.</br>  <br> So is this shit limited to 2D. <br>This is a given.</br></br>  <br>Chapter 1 reads like a BL manga.</br>  <br> surprise </br>  <br>It's hardly a surprise, though the premise might sound like it's reverse harem. But it barely focuses on the fact MC is a girl and hasn't had romance so far. It's more bros being bros shonen manga.</br>  <br>I did but I don't remember it being this homo.</br>  <br>Does it have a female mc?</br>  <br>The mc is female yes</br>  <br>He's so depraved.</br>  It's time to post your husbando!  <br>Can I post my son instead?</br>  <br>This thread is off to a good start.</br>  <br>Bl needs more diverse art styles</br>  <br>It sure is.</br>  <br>Hmm, looking back he is extremely depraved.  I hope he gets the mob doujins he deserves </br>  <br> fujos <br> watching shoujo  <br>I doubt he'll get anything.</br></br></br>  <br>Summer is the best time of the year, after all.</br>  <br>Technically it's shounen, but you're probably right anyway.</br>  <br>Who looks exactly like a boy 100% of the time. There are certain implicit leanings here.</br>  <br>That's not shoujo though<br>It's "neo-shonen", aka shonen that most likely still panders to girls(see Kuroshitsuji).</br></br>  <br>Tora is a qt oversized cat, do not sexualize him.</br>  <br>You need to relax. Why don't you lay down right over there.</br>  <br> neo-shonen <br>Why do you have to invent new terms if you can just call it shoujo?<br><br>Monthly GFantasy might as well call itself shoujo since by now 90% of its target audience is girls. <br><br>ffs, Switch, Saiyuki, Pandora Hearts, Nabari no Ou and Kimi to Boku ran in it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This show is shit though. Only watching because some anon told me that there will be shota suffering in the future.</br>  <br>Wow sounds like it's demographic is shoujo.</br>  <br><br><br>MC is so fuckin ugly.</br></br></br>  <br>He looks roofied.</br>  <br>Okay. I just hope we at least see more of this delinquent.</br>  <br> Yes he does </br>  <br>So even if you call those shoujo, what does that have to do with  ? G Fantasy's titles are popular among fujoshi.</br>  <br> Ranpo kittan threads are somehow gayer than homothread </br>  Yo homodachi, any of you interested in some typesetting?  <br>Not really. You're just too used to character designs that pander to fujos. Besides, he looks a lot cuter in the manga.</br>  <br>Ouran got some doujins back then, they were all terrible but still.</br>  <br>And he is even uglier in the manga.</br>  <br>Why are they so LONG?</br>  <br>I think he's cute</br>  <br> You're just too used to character designs that pander to fujos <br><br>No man, I'm just not blind.</br></br></br>  <br> not liking LONG </br>  <br>This doujin was great.</br>  <br>I think he's really cute.</br>  <br> fujo design <br>He looked like Sousuke on manga cover.</br></br>  <br>Actually in that image he looks fine, if only the rest of the show was drawn that well.</br>  <br>Well, Sousuke is cute.</br>  <br>Wrong Sousuke though.</br>  <br>Then you should've posted who you meant, dumbass.</br>  <br>Everybody knows which Sousuke dumbass.</br>  Myreadingmanga died?  <br>No?</br>  <br>Oh god, CLAMP has a problem.</br>  <br>Because they're not 15</br>  My homo-meter was off the charts this chapter   cutest boy is gone <br><br>Suddenly there is no reason to watch it anymore.</br></br>  <br>nope.</br>   3745HOUSE new doujin out <br><br><br>Uh? Sensei still there.</br></br></br>  <br>That's some weak trolling there, dumbass.</br>  <br>What are you saying, Kaitocchi is still very much present.</br>  <br> cutest boy is gone <br>Something happened to the teacher?</br></br>  <br>Why use it? Basically everything on it is on sadpanda</br>  <br><br><br><br>Jesus christ get some taste. No wonder everyone is laughing at you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some aren't, and I prefer the scroll down format.</br>  Sera-sensei is a tyrant teacher and probably smells like beer and oil.  <br>Still posting worse Sousuke dumbass?</br>  <br>I prefer a guy that smells of blood, sweat, and whiskey.</br>  <br>Is it going to be KarmaxNagisa or NagisaxKayano? I'm personally rooting for  OotaxNagisa .</br>  <br>What an ugly bitch.</br>  <br>Kayano is clearly the manga endgame, but that won't stop me fapping to any good KarmaxNagisa doujins.<br>I really wish we'd get NagisaxKarma sometime too.</br></br>  <br>At least someone is posting a Sousuke dumbass</br>  <br> everything on it is on sadpanda <br><br>A lot of translated manga and doujins aren't. Site is good, if you ignore the terrible layout and users.</br></br></br>  <br>He sure is. Makes him even more moe.</br>  <br> Manlets </br>  <br>You are wasting image limit dumbass.</br>  <br>They also make me smile</br>  <br>And you still haven't posted the Sousuke you were thinking of, dumbass</br>  <br>No, it makes him shit.</br>  <br>Manlets are cute</br>  <br>No need to post the obvious dumbass.</br>  <br><br>Can you faggots fuck off?</br></br>  <br>Soon.</br>  <br>Old post, but am I looking at this wrong? He looks like he has a bustle, or dislocated hip.</br>    <br>Thanks for agreeing that GATE MC is cute.</br>  <br>He means Sousuke from Free. Hence why he quoted the thing about fujo bait. Now both of you can shut up.</br>  <br>And there's this faggot.</br>  <br>Almost forgot about this. I thought they'd reveal Nagare's design in the anime as some sort of surprise and not earlier.</br>  <br>He's as ugly as Sousuke still better than FMP Sousuke though.</br>  Thanks to the anon that mentioned Gakuen Ouji last thread. Shit's crazy. Nobunaga a shit but he has some serious homolust.  <br>So which Sousuke were you thinking of? Because this Sousuke is pretty cute too.</br>  <br> You're welcome! </br>  <br><br>He's wearing a dress. He's just holding side of it out.</br></br>  <br>He's better as a shota.</br>  <br>Already mentioned dumbass.</br>  <br>You haven't posted him yet.</br>  <br><br>Everyone is better as shota duh</br></br>  <br>Most bad boys are.</br>  <br>I thought it was strange too. He has a really cool design though. along with his priest and shota. Sorta wish Munakata didn't beat him to the punch of making Fushimi a clansmen. He would have fit in well with the greens.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>REJOICE</br>  <br>So it WAS Aizen all along!</br>  <br>Deaf moe is cute.</br>  <br>That's some Aizen tier trolling right there.</br>  <br> Kotomine is now the same voice of another Best Priest. </br>  <br>No you're Aizen!</br>  <br>I don't think he's moe but Nic sure is hot.</br>  <br> MFW he speaks. <br><br>I never thought having a speech impediment could be so sexy.</br></br></br>  What do I say to people who think having more than one husbando is perfectly fine?  <br>Call them a slut.</br>  <br>I call them out for the sluts that they are.</br>  <br>You join them.</br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #5<br><br>Remember to please take it easy and relax.<br><br>Previous thread: </br></br></br></br>  I would like to request a drawing of Mai Natsume.

Can someone explain what just happened...that ending felt really rushed. I get what happened to the villain and i know Giorno becomes the head gangster but that epilogue was really off putting.<br><br>also Bruno&gt;&gt;&gt;Giorno</br></br>   Jotaro could have been an athlete winning all the time <br> Jotaro could have become a better manga artist than Rohan <br> Jotaro could have joined the army and ora ora'd some terrorists <br> Jotaro could have been a doctor <br> But no, he becomes a fucking dolphin fucker where he probably never uses his stand </br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey, he is Dr. Kujo, fuck you</br>  <br>Well he did become a Doctor just not a medical one</br>  Pucci kills Jotaro  HOTPANTS<br>O<br>T<br>P<br>A<br>N<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Partially from the translation.<br>Did you know that Mista beat the shit out of people that talked shit about Clint Eastwood for change, and that the reason he dodged all those bullets was from him simply being determinated and not due to Sex Pistols?</br>  pastebin.com/qzDMjL87<br><br>Pucci gets killed by clouds</br></br>  <br>Part 5 is BuBu's Gangsta Revenge. Bruno is the real MC and Giorno a shit.</br>  Gay Priest is here now.  <br>The chapter with the ball thing was fluff so that araki could meet the required number of chapters he needed for the last volume.</br>  i guess i'll post this here too<br><br>translation please?<br>if this is an actual story mode i'll be so hype</br></br></br>  <br>forgot the fucking picture</br>  Please enjoy the sweet tunes of Heaven.<br>https://<span>youtu.be/khk5V6L8Vos  [ ]</br>  <br>Strike - Li - mode - Degas Sonhidaritsu<br>best I could get off of google translate</br></br>  <br>Story Mode.</br>  never ever  <br>The text in yellow says "there is a story mode"<br>the other text is saying they'll cover some of it</br></br>  <br>I don't recall a scene like this at all, though. Is it an original story or something?</br>  <br>Keep in mind that every battle was in Cairo according too ASB</br>  <br>Yeah, and every battle in Part 1 was in Dio's castle. ASB fucked itself a bit with the lack of stages.</br>  He makes me feel confused and funny about myself. Is this a bad thing?  <br>My point is that it could just be a scene where they're just talking to each other but they don't want to bother making a background for the scene so they just use the Cairo stage</br>  <br>Oh, it's Cairo? It looks like a big shopping mall or something to me.</br>  <br>If it were an original story, it'd be cool if it was about all the JoJo's finding themselves in some weird universe and they have to fight ton survive</br>  <br>With a name like eyes of heaven. You'd think the story mode would be the JoJo time crossover we've always wanted to see. I mean it's already set up in the post battle quotes, might as well just go all the way.</br>  <br><br><br><br>fuck i'm hype<br>i'm getting actually giddy about the idea of an original story mode<br>just actual character models speaking instead of text scrolls like ASB is enough for me</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hot Pants is cute!! cute</br>  <br> You will be able to walk around Morioh in your lifetime <br>How is EoH not the best JoJo game?</br></br>  <br> Swastikas <br>Stroheim would be proud</br></br>  <br>Funny in what way, anon?</br>  <br>The ending is definitely underwhelming, but it helps to consider GER not as the climax, but part of the resolution.

When did this happen?  <br>Yes.</br>    why does josuke in 8 have the same first and last name as the josuke in 4?  <br>Read Part 8, if you're a faggot hover  Josuke is just how Yasuho's dog was called, Higashikata is the family that adopts him. He doesn't have a real name because he's the fusion of Yoshikage Kira and Josefumi Kujo </br>    <br>my friend's oc</br>   old translations of part 5 <br>I'm reading part 6 now.</br>  <br>Hopefully SHA will work better here than it did in ASB.</br>  <br>He's David Bowie. It's only natural</br>      why the fuck does ZA WARUDO Diego Wryyy?  <br>Because /a/ is wrong about Wryyy being a vampire thing, it's just a psychopath thing</br>  Daily remainder that glorious Englishman Vampire Overlord Dio Brando is better than Greasy NEET DIO    <br> Josefumi somehow went to original universe <br> Saved Josuke in the snow <br> Pucci split him in half at one point, sending him back to JJLverse </br></br></br>  <br> somehow josuke's hair got worse </br>  <br>Anon, let it go, it's like expecting to get a flashback to Dio having a second coffin</br>  <br><br>Think Jo2uke will have the pompadour under his hat?</br></br>   Araki couldn't continue the trend of previous jojos showing up and helping out that part 3 started <br><br> We'll never get Josuke getting roped into a bunch of mobster nonsense   and saving everyone's lives with crazy diamond <br> We'll never get Giorno getting dragged to the prison along with every other one of Dio's children <br> We'll never get alternate Jolyne showing up at the SBR race somehow </br></br></br></br>  Tfw wanted someone like Midorikawa as Diego but they're forcing Koyasu onto him even though they Diego isn't the same person as Dio.<br><br>I mean I love Koyasu and he's one of my favourite castings but I don't see why they're using him as Diego.</br></br>  <br>SHA in ASB had unblockable setups though, it wasn't bad.</br>   in the end the part 7 protagonists kill more innocent people and for a much more selfish goal than the villain   <br>he sounds like he's doing a higher voice but i guess i understand</br>  <br>Best I have.</br>  <br>Bruno's fights were way more interesting than Giorno's. My favorite was the one on the train.<br><br>Also remember how GE could give someone so much life energy that they experience everything in slow motion? <br>Why the hell did Araki just drop that?</br></br></br></br>  <br>He also dropped reflecting damage</br>  <br>By the way why did Josuke apply for being a doctor? Imagine how many lives he could save with his stand. Of course he can't cure diseases but still.</br>    <br>How is 2 times a "trend"?</br>  Did Araki forgit Dio's scar in part 6 ?  <br>forgot*</br>  <br>forget*</br>  <br><br><br>It's fanart ya dingus</br></br></br>  <br>yes, but that's fanart</br>  Anyone have the links to the completed colored mangas?  <br>Apparently Gappy's hair his slicked back  and kinda sexy  underneath the hat.<br><br><br>He could just become a surgeon or something else that requires practical skills, but he'll still need to accumulate a vast amount of medical knowledge.

I finished SBR back when it ended and held off on Lion until it had a more coherent story, but fuck, the number of shit Araki is projecting into this part.<br><br> 4 Testicles <br> Bondage <br> BDSM <br> Rape <br> Child molesting female lead every other panel <br> Main character gets nude all the time for no reason <br> Boners left and right <br> incest <br> Holly getting all foot kinky with the nurse <br> Old people fucking <br> crossdressing <br> big titty whores <br> implied bathroom oral <br><br>Like seriously, is Sex the theme of Part 8? Everything with the exception for "I am a rock" and Beetle Tendency fights at underlying sexual tones to it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>PH gets another fight in purple haze feedback<br><br> but anon, an entire novel and they only made one more fight for him? <br><br>yes, they're retards  distortion gets a short one too </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think this is Araki experimenting with how much shit he can pull off under new management. He couldn't do it with SBR because a part suddenly changing tones in the middle would be sorta dumb, even for Araki.</br>  <br> &gt;tumblr <br> &gt;out </br></br>  <br> Implying Jolyne would use a condom </br>  <br>Pucci is heterosexual and died a virgin.</br>  <br>Beetle Tendency is how they choose the alpha who gets to bone everyone, and I am a rock refers to boners</br>    <br> Johnathan <br> condom <br><br> implying he'd ever have sex that wasn't with his wife after marriage, with the lights on, in the missionary position, holding hands, looking into each others eyes, for the purpose of creating a child <br><br>You filthy heathens.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"Here lies Enrico Pucci, he lived fast and died a virgin."</br>   Joseph didn't keep practising hamon  <br> we could have had near enough the same looking part 2 Joseph in part 3  <br> we could have had his shenanigans in part 3, annoying Jotaro and fucking with him <br> we could have had Young Joseph and Jotaro travelling together and fighting DIO together  <br><br>SDC would have been really fun <br> inb4 Joseph fag  <br>I'm up to date on part 8 and Johnny is my favourite jojo</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Part 8 update when?  <br>B-but..muh DIO.</br>  <br/>  <br>Pucci was pure.</br>  <br>Eros is inevitable between Josuke and Yasuho, Araki said so. Source is his book where he lewdly hugs Rohan.</br>  <br><br>well, it IS a vampire thing.<br>then in SBR universe Dinosaurs and Scary Monster are the Vampires of that universe so they inherit the WRYYYY as well.<br>as to why Diego from another Universe would WRYYY, there could be a reason in his universe that we're not aware of.</br></br></br></br>  <br>theres no one else that could do a dio voice though so i love it</br>  Finished part 6 and I'm kinda confused. How does speeding up the universe create a parallel Universe. I'm guessing when pucchi died it kept "jolyne" from going to prison but how did that keep the others out?  <br>But is he Purer than Digg-Son?</br>  <br>What'd you think of Meme-Priest?</br>  <br>it reaches the big crunch, then a new big bang emerges</br>  <br>I loved him, everything was just going so  fast  I got kinda confused.</br>  <br> I'm guessing when pucchi died it kept "jolyne" from going to prison but how did that keep the others out? <br>Gravity. And they're all replacements, so they didn't do whatever got them in to begin with.</br></br>  <br>Cool. <br>Made in Heaven sped up time, then went so fast it sped up the universe to the end of time ending that universe so a new one is made, which is where all living things go to. The people that Pucci killed are gone, and never coming back though so they are replaced. When Pucci is killed and the universe retarts again those people aren't even jolyne and the rest so what ever happened to them would be different anyway.</br></br>  <br>Then why did Giorno do it</br>  <br>YES I AM</br>  <br>Remember Jhonny and Gyro were the true Terrorists</br>  <br> For the mudad reference. </br>  <br>Did anyone else Wryy? Other than the DIO's and GIO?</br>  <br>THIS. It's like Araki's suddenly really sexually frustrated and taking it out on his comic</br>  <br>Jotaro had a mullet?</br>  <br>He always did.</br>  <br>Isn't a Mullet also a type of fish?</br>  <br><br>Stone Ocean and SBR weren't well-received on Japan so Araki needed to pander to the horny otakus.

And so Johnny would get smaller and lose range as he approached never getting closer. And even if he could, zero point erases everything to zero.<br><br>Only thing that can kill the baby is cream for certain. GER nd it tie because they both have zeroing abilities. So that cancels each other out.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah this works. Kind of a shitty stand when you think about it. Maybe the stand user can't be moved at all?

Only when it pertains to fakku, yep. Stop being so defensive, you make it too obvious.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know if it's just because of that book, but there was an article once that said that Naruko Hanaharu was a millionaire</br>  <br>I don't really understand why people support fakku<br><br>they helped nuked galleries for books they'll never release. They have 9 fucking books in their store while the wani bullshit removed literally thousands of galleries.</br></br></br>  <br> grasping at straws <br>You used the argument a lot by now. You have to be the same guy because I heard this a lot in these threads.</br></br>  <br>People just grasp at a lot of straws in these threads</br>  <br>Yeah, according to a TV show it sold over a million copies. The nips were really surprised by it and didn't believe it, so I'm not sure whether to believe it or not, I dunno how credible the show itself is, and it's not like Hanaharu himself was on there or anything (though Igumox was).</br>  <br>They'll get around to it. Eventually. Hope you still like fapping to hentai in 2060 when they finally catch up on their backlog.</br>  <br><br>That's why I'm kind of pissed that they want to enter talks with MORE publishers. Why? Forget that Wani's been around since the 70s, just go back as far as 2010 and you still have more material available than Fakku could release for years, even with an increased release schedule with a larger staff. They literally cannot even offer Wani's recent catalog in a decent time frame and yet they want to fuck up more stuff.</br></br>  <br><br>Fuck, even just for the X-EROS magazine alone assuming one per month, that's gonna be like 3-4 years playing catchup.</br></br>  http://exhentai.org/s/0d5be8c98e/35<wbr>894-4</wbr>  <br>You're not being fair, the only way for them to release more content is if they grow. But you won't support them because they won't release enough content. Aren't they doing xeros and kairakuten now? how big is their team, that is a massive undertaking on its own</br>  <br>yes undoubtedly I can't wait to fap to freshly released hentai from 2015 in 2060</br>  <br> replying to yourself </br>  <br> So this is where I was born from </br>  <br>Fuck off Daiz.</br>  <br>It's Bobobo, like anon told you earlier, which is removed for Wani.</br>  <br>What exactly is 'fair'?<br><br>The fact that they made their business out of pirating the work and translations of other people, and are now issuing takedowns against those people so they don't have competition on their piracy ring because they told you they're going 'legit'?</br></br></br>  <br><br>And they've been 'going legit' for a long time now. Let's see if they even remove h-manga at the end of this month like they said they were.</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>I wonder what it would take to get it through your thick head that they didn't have anything to do with the Wani DMCAs. Tenboro said the DMCAs came from Wani, literally every other scanlator that got them said they came from Wani. Unless your argument otherwise is that Fakku was puppeteering Wani, and even went as far as to send themselves a DMCA to cover it up.<br><br>Just drop that from your argument, because it makes you look stupid. Especially because the whole "building your fanbase on piracy" is a halfway legitimate point.</br></br></br>  <br>LIAR THERE WAS NO LOLICON OR FEMDOM IN THAT!</br>  <br>The problem it seems he has and me as well is that they are looking for other publishers to make partners with when they can't even produce a fraction of the content their current publisher has. <br><br>If they made a new partner that publisher would gain a vested interest in sending out takedowns to western sites just like wani. Then we get into the same situation with that new publisher where we get less translations of stuff it is going to take fakku years to do if they ever even get around to it.</br></br></br>  <br>Why are you referring to yourself in third person, Jewcob? Fuck off.</br>  <br>Do we have to start with this again?</br>  <br>That anon is right. If people stopped trying to pin the takedowns on fakku which has been proven multiple times to be false they would have a lot more ground to stand on</br>  <br> I wonder what it would take to get it through your thick head that they didn't have anything to do with the Wani DMCAs <br><br>Dude, they have a contract deal with wani. They hired scanlators who basically ran blogs that barely anyone knew about. Are you fucking going to tell me that wani knew about the english translated releases of YQII, and the massive amounts of wani galleries running under pseudonyms on a handful of unremarkable websites?</br></br></br>  <br><br> still using the exact same terms to samefag and shill with <br><br>Jesus christ just fuck off already, it's so obvious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, Daiz.</br>  http://exhentai.org/g/833912/3a1661<wbr>13b8/<br> 25 pages <br> 3mb <br><br>Wut.</br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/search/filena<wbr>me/1406450752439.png<br>Your other advertising thread was removed and you instantly go here, Daiz.</br></wbr></br>  <br>I saved it from that post anon, do you know how filenames work on 4chan?</br>  <br> responding to samefagging shills <br><br>Why even bother?

Most sites removed Wani content back then already, but E-Hentai didn't - it was just "hidden" in the secret club. That's why they got a second takedown later, after which they actually removed the content. So in reality the purge already started months earlier, it just took a bit longer until it actually reached the panda.</br>  I know this isn't /r/ but I'm in dire straits, I need anything with eye bags, which as I believe aren't tags on panda so I don't know where to start.  <br> MILFs edition. <br><br>Oh yiss</br></br></br>  <br>Why not jus say Mother's edition.<br><br>I dislike the term MILF.
