Get your localised lore straight.</br>  <br> Which one is this? The second or third game? <br>It's from a S;G spin-off VN called Linear Bounded Phenogram. That's older Nae with toddler Suzuha.</br></br>    <br>L-L-Licious!</br>  Mio~ <br> You can have candies after your medication. </br>  <br>HEY <br>STOP RIGHT THERE</br></br>  Mayuri deserved Okabe's love  <br>She still gets it, just in a brotherly way.</br>  Posting bestbois.  <br>how fast does time flow?</br>  <br>1s/s</br>  <br> time flows at 1 <br>simply ebin</br></br>  <br>1 second per second, Memeanon.</br>  <br>But "1 second per second" is a meaningless rate m8:<br><br>When you divide<br> 1 sec / 1 sec <br> 1 / 1 <br>You just get 1</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I'm not sure whether I should be proud or disgusted at having started this meme</br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly. It's as meaningless as asking how fast time flows, since we can only measure how fast things go by using time as a unit.<br><br>It's like asking how much a gram weighs, or how long an inch is.</br></br></br>  Am I late?  <br>Not late enough</br>  I start getting uncontrollable hype when I think of R;N getting localised and this feeling has been only been  augmented  by Steiner's recent posts but I don't want to be disappointed help me /a/.  <br>Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.</br>    Make like a train and fuck off.  <br> その目神の目？ <br> その目 <br> 神の目？ </br></br></br>  <br>Follow your own advice</br>  <br>This is a proper sciADV thread now.</br>  <br>When will Kevin give us what we desire?<br>I just want to read a good translation of the Blue Sky ending.<br><br>I desire Blue Sky.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What's so bad about the translation we have now?</br>  <br/>  <br>It's incomplete, it has bugs, it is not Noah.</br>  <br>How is it incomplete? <br>The bugs don't affect the Blue Sky End at all.<br>The fact that it is not Noah has nothing to do with the translation itself.</br></br></br>  <br> 力士シイルは神 </br>  <br>The tips section of the PC version is untranslated for example.<br>The bugs affect the true route, so it effects the enjoyment of the true ending.<br><br>Where is that picture from?<br><br><br>What should I see them as?<br>Friends?<br>Brother and sister?<br>Lovers?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best Friends.</br>  <br> What should I see them as? <br> Friends? <br> Brother and sister? <br> Lovers? <br>Why not all of the above?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Master and servant. </br>  <br>Who is which?</br>  <br> She serves. </br>  <br>Well, I can see that.<br>I want my Tulpa to kiss me.<br>Why can't I create one?</br></br></br>  What comes next? Rickert dying? Sayonara ship? place your bets, anon!  <br> Rickert dying <br>NO!</br></br>  <br>We'll get to see how Erica is raped to death, so get hyped!</br>  Nothing. <br>They will continue in the boat, we wll get a comical episode where Guts learns to fish. Hi-la-ri-ous!</br>  <br>AND he'll learn there are plenty more fish in the sea</br>  <br> mfw there are people who waited years for the new chapter  <br> mfw there are people who died waiting for it <br> mfw I won't wait one fucking day </br></br></br>  <br> Mfw asuka is worst girl <br>Faggots being faggots, what else can I expect?</br></br>  <br>I want Berserk to have more SoL elements</br>  <br>I tnk retard casca is best casca</br>   morons are speculating again   <br>Welcome back Shitposter-kun</br>  Griffith talking. Again.  <br>You're such a dumb boy.</br>   Thinking you're getting out of the boat <br>HAHAHAHAHA.<br>No.<br>I sell boats, who wants one for their guts cosplay :^)</br></br></br>  <br> NOTHING <br><br>Its gonna be 5 pages of nothing, or just 1 page with THE END would be better.</br></br></br>  Anything with Griffith is gold for me. So I can't wait.  Griffith sipping more tea like a faggot. You know it's true.  <br><br>kill yourself</br></br>  <br>But have you seen how beautiful he looks?</br>  If it's still in Falconia,<br> Griffith dicksuckers (Sonia in particular) anally annihilated by Rickert, attempt retaliation <br> Griffith reflecting on how much he would like Guts' penis up his butthole <br> Princess perhaps realizing that all the demons and shit around isn't kosher, or just continuing to suck Griffith's dick like Sonia </br></br></br>  http://strawpoll.me/4962329  <br> being a homosexual <br> any year </br></br>  <br> mfw Guts somwhow ends up alone separated from his friends for the next five years </br>  <br>you're such a dumb boy!</br>    <br>this is a sick joke</br>  <br>This</br>  <br> he doesn't realize that it's a ship <br>You're a moron.</br></br>  <br>This is the captcha that came up when I posted the boat yesterday. So I pasted the boat over one of the cars.<br><br>Fucking Google, man.</br></br></br>  <br>You're such a dumb boy!</br>  Griffith is miracle of the universe      <br>Deep lore<br>e<br>e<br>p<br><br>l<br>o<br>r<br>e</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Griffith suddenly turned into a Kushan shitskin in this page </br>  <br>still looks cute</br>  <br> stretching the image and ruining the aspect ratio <br>LoGHfags everyone.</br></br>  <br>you're such a dumb boy.</br>  <br>Shitposting isn't going to cure your autism.</br>  <br> Austistic calling other autistic <br>You're such a dumb boy!.</br></br>  art  <br>The fuck was so good it left her sweating AND drooling.</br>  <br>That's the moment when Casca went retarded. What were her last thoughts?</br>  <br>imagine if your neck was cut off and the amount of signals your senses were sending to your brain<br>Fuck with griffits is probably similar that your brain just gets flooded with signals and goes into a shock.</br></br>  <br> this isn't half bad actually </br>  <br> Dick...too...bomb </br>  <br>Do you think Casca still has a muscular back? Or has she's been out of fighting shape too long now?</br>  <br>considering how little activity she does and she eats whatever is put in front of her her physique would resemble average /v/ user</br>  Explain this  <br>He's losing his head</br>  <br>then explain THIS</br>  <br>Dang. This is NOT congruent with my fetishes.</br>  <br> implying she's a fat neckbeard </br>  <br> Berserker wants to rage but his waifu won't let him </br>  Griffith fapping to being humiliated in front of his followers by a femboy.  <br>Oh shit</br>  <br>I have a feeling Sonia is going to join Guts &amp; Friends once she learns the truth about her living idol</br>  I'll post this in every berserk thread until you like it   You will never rub yourself over Farnese's face   <br>Why isn't serpico killing puck?</br>  <br>Puck isn't supposed to die.</br>  <br>You have such a good hand... why waste it on that Griffith cuck?</br>  <br>I'm not the original artist you fag  I just appreciate best ship </br>  <br> Savor the taste <br><br>Holy shit I forgot how great Puck can be sometimes.<br>I really want to go back to Guts and friends now.</br></br></br></br>  I actually thought Miura had reused Sonia in the second panel before putting them together and noticing the subtle details. This guy surprises me every day.  <br> Serpico vs Puck <br> Puck near death <br> Uses Becchi <br> Sacrifices Guts to become an apostle <br> Destroys Serpico and Farnese <br> Founds harem with Schierke, Evarella and Casca <br> Travels to Falconia, becomes apostle-chestnut which Griffith chokes on and dies <br> Rules the world </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*subtle differences</br>  <br>How abhorrent.</br>  <br>Don't ever talk to me like that.</br>  <br> Get bored on the boat <br> Everyone likes music right? <br> Get great idea to encourage morale: have the girls dress up, sing and dance! <br> Idolm@ster crossover confirmed   still on the boat. </br></br></br></br>  UGI!<br>BAU <br>AH OH</br></br>  <br> FMA-tier silly faces <br><br>Fucking Miura breaking the atmosphere of the series. The only one allowed to do that should be Puck.</br></br></br>  Well one of the first things to happen is they will get off the boat.  <br> They make it to the island <br> Chapter devoted to approaching the island, talking about it <br> Chapter devoted to meeting up with patrol boat, diplomacy, and finally docking <br> Next chapter: everyone is on the boat wearing grim expressions <br> "That meeting with the Fairy King taught us a lot but was it what we really wanted?" <br>   TIME FOR THE RETURN JOURNEY, MAYBE YOU'LL GET SOME SINGLE POAGE FLASHBACKS TO THEIR TIME NOT BEING ON THE BOAT </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>...excuse me?</br>  <br>That's a a man, right? Wtf?</br>  <br>I might have shit memory but I'm quite sure the comedic faces have always been used, I think Griffith and Casca did that sometimes back in Golden Age.</br>  <br><br>Fags fighting</br></br>  <br>It's her fucking child holy shit do you people not pay attention<br>Owait im being 'trolled' again</br></br>  <br> considering how little activity she does and she eats whatever is put in front of her her physique would resemble average /v/ user <br>In all seriousness, assuming you've worked out really hard during younger years, puberty and so on that affects your metabolism for the rest of your life. Someone who is a giant fatass in highschool is always going to have trouble not matter what they do and vice versa, someone in great shape will lock in a certain amount of that. Consider her long periods of poor food between heavy meals and the massive amount of walking they all have to do she'd lose a ton of muscle mass but she would not get fat.</br></br>  <br>Please, don't reply to me like that. I am waiting for a response from this asshole who told me not to reply to him a certain way. I doubt he'll respond to me. He's fucked off. Thankfully.</br>  <br>........<br>.............<br>....................<br>You, sir, clearly do not belong in a berserk thread.</br></br></br></br>  What does Adut attack means?  <br>havent they been confined into a boat for decades now, ofc if you travel on foot it is going to keep you in shape<br>You need to remember average physique of a retarded person</br></br>  <br> He's fucked off. Thankfully. <br>Please don't ever talk to me like that you big cretin</br></br>  <br>penis into anus</br>  <br>Up the butt. But elves don't have dicks, so they just use their stingers.</br>  <br>be- stinger in bagina :DDDD</br>  <br> havent they been confined into a boat for decades now <br><br>Real time. Comic book time they've been on the boat for a few weeks tops.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do you think you can come into a thread that I'm posting in and speak down to me like that? I'll speak to you HOWEVER the fuck I want.</br>  <br><br>Both of you fuck off back to leddit, cancerous fags.</br></br>  <br>wow how fucking rude please refrain of ever talking to me like that</br>  <br>Please, FUCK OFF... Who do you even think you are, man? You're just dicking around.</br>  Tell me what you fucking think<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bXY<wbr>iFFM7WH4</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I've said it many times before and I'll say it again, Erica is gonna die.<br><br><br>Rape.  The game all adults play. </br></br></br></br>  <br>What makes you think Erica is going to die next chapter? You are one of the weirdest users.</br>  <br> next chapter <br>Oh, no, of course not.<br>Next chapter is going to be, again, about how Falconia is awesome. Perhaps just Rickert working and Erica having fun. She's not going to die next chapter, obviously.<br><br>First comes the crowning, then the wedding then the consummation of the marriage. Then Erica will die.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Guts and Griffith fight <br> Rickerts there watching <br>  shit happens <br>  a behelit rolls over to him <br>  shit gets real <br>  Eclipse 2.0 </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OTP</br>  <br>But Rickert has no reason to use a behelit</br>  <br>Why is serpico so hot?</br>  <br>what would modern casca singing sound like?</br>  <br>it's the fox eyes</br>  <br>Royal blood</br>  <br><br>why won't farnese tap that?</br></br>  <br>too busy learning to draw apples in her mind or some shit</br>   next chapter has them get off the island <br> "Wow, that took no time at all!" </br>  <br>She wanted to but he turned her down.</br>  <br>Fuck, I meant get on the island.</br>  <br>bastard swag</br>  <br>But he loves her</br>  I've forgot the majority of Berserk's plot up until now<br><br>It's been so long</br></br>  <br> why won't farnese tap that? <br>Did you forget her whole background chapters anon? She very much wanted to tap that but he said no.</br></br>  <br>incest is bad m'kay?</br>  <br>He doesn't want children with 11 toes. Which probably wouldn't be too out of place in the Berserk universe but they're still related.<br><br>Otherwise he'd probably be DTF.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't he in love with her though?</br>  <br>Doesn't matter. He probably realizes that since their father knows about how they're actually related that it would only cause trouble. Besides, Serpico still cares for her deeply, he just wouldn't put his dick in her. And can you really blame him? Bitch is crazy.</br>  Wait, I thought Berserk getting updates was just us memeing again.<br><br>It's really happening is it? I guess after all this time of little to no updates I've become jaded that I can't even summon any excitement for it anymore.</br></br>  What if the next chapter is the boat sinking and nobody can do anything about it?  <br>We're getting a 100 page chapter in a little more than a week and it will continue from there with monthly updates.</br>  <br>He's always aware of how Farnese looks at Guts...it hurts him. Hurts him so bad.</br>  This is how berserk should've ended:<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/452615/4a31f2<wbr>eb57/</wbr></br></br>    <br>the next chapter is just guts looking at the sea while looking bored</br>  <br> not posting the first one </br>    <br>why does that still seem wrong</br>  <br>Allahu Akbar</br>  <br>How long have they been writing about the boat adventures? 4-5 years? Is this One Piece?</br>  <br> 4-5 years? <br>I think it's been like 8 years now.</br></br>  <br>I think the crew in One Piece has actually spent less overall time on boats.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128288743 <br>Since school let out.</br>  When did it suddenly become acceptable to post hawk scans again?<br><br>Fucking scrubs.</br></br>  What are wrong with Hawk scans?  <br>How far we've fallen.</br>  <br>is that Jill?!  She'd be way older by now right </br>  <br>I'm going to continue to completely ignore this<br><br> Select all images with Boats <br>Fuck you captcha</br></br></br></br>  <br> way older <br> been less than two years since Lost Children, if even that long. </br></br>  <br> mfw Just realized this foreshadowing </br>  <br>Attention whore fuck off</br>   <br> tfw the other position was used with Guts and Casca </br>  Anyone have the page where Guts  kills the fire loli demon that's asking for it's mommy?  I sincerely though it'd be easier to find but it's proving to be harder than it used to be, I've been going through volumes 13 to 20 skimming about looking but don't see it yet.    <br>Found it, volume 15</br>    <br>How the fk do I even access this shit....</br>      <br>vol19 a best<br><br>i dont like how Miura draws Gut's upper lip now</br></br></br>  <br>I want JRPG party to die in a brutally fashion (edginess apart)</br>    <br>so basically he becomes Street Fighter's Ryu.</br>  <br>I don't mind Serpico, rest though (especially the kids) can get fucked</br>  is there a series more metal than berserk?  <br>Detriot Metal City</br>  <br>No. Slowly he becomes dolph lundgren</br>  <br>all the writing in that is the opposite of metal, though</br>  <br>RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE RAPE</br>  <br>i know the line between 'metal' and 'cheesy bullshit' is pretty thin, but that's pretty squarely the latter.</br>  <br>Are you for fucking real?</br>  <br>well shit</br>  <br>I don't remember this AT ALL</br>  So what the fuck do the Godhand do when they're not being summoned by a behelit? Did void give Femto a tour of everything after the eclipse? Do any of them care that the newbie is doing all this kind of crazy stuff in the physical plane?  <br>It's one of the spirits of the dead children that Rosine had turned in to pseudo elves</br>  <br>loli witch is a miracle of the universe.</br>  Why hasnt farnisse fucked anyone yet<br>even schierke was closer to getting laid</br>  <br>She fucked herself right?<br><br>Also are the single issue Berserks anywhere translated? Only ones I can find are 334 and 335</br></br></br>  <br>Welp they are in Mangafox all of them but that quality, also who has translated these? Are they crap?</br>  Rewatching the anime and this was the most fucked up moment first time seeing it  before ever reading the manga   <br>http://mangafox.me/manga/berserk/v3<wbr>8/c335/16.html<br>shows who translated</br></wbr></br>  <br>Forgot the picture ofc</br>  Is Gut's eye sewn shut?  <br>I'm pretty sure he just has the reflex down pat.</br>   Re-reading Berserk. <br> Having a great time. <br> Enjoying the funny moments with the Band. <br> Eclipse <br> "Oh right, the murders." <br> Become incredibly sad watching Guts watch all his friends get ripped in half, Gaston's head explode from the inside out. <br> And everything else. <br><br>On the bright side, you can literally pin-point the moment Gut's rage kicks in to MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE.<br><br><br> Casca a cute. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i just assumed it was the nerves/muscles being dead or whatever</br>  Given this a try for like 3 times but just cannot get past the opening scene with horrible CGI<br>Should I just bite my lip and go through with them?</br>  <br>the third movie is the only decent one<br>but they cut out two of the best parts, the sex scene, and WYALD THE GRAND MAGICAL RAPIST</br></br>  <br>they're what got me onto Berserk in the first place, but they don't really do it proper justice<br><br>i wouldn't bother</br></br></br>  Whatever happens I won't be discussing it with you lot. These threads are cancer and show the average reader of Berserk today is a complete utter shonenfag moron. I hope Deepfag doesn't do something stupid, like comeback to you retards.  <br>O shit son</br>  I hope we will know more about this guy  <br>why is his true form doggystyling a deer?</br>  <br>Because Miura draws his fantasms</br>   5 days until new chapter gets released <br> No leaks <br><br>Holy shit, I just want to know about what will be covering.</br></br></br>  <br>Miura here, Casca dies.</br>  <br>so how did he even end up in prison?<br><br>Obviously he went in willingly, did he just do it because he thought it would be fun?</br></br></br>  <br>Excitement and enjoyment!</br>  <br>zach here<br>thanks man</br></br>  <br>You've never raped anyone in your life.</br>  <br>Back the fuck off?!</br>  <br>Daily reminder that we must all become Cascafags in order to dispel the tripfag threat. Lashings of Rapeman Forever.swf are also permitted against no name.</br>  <br>Fighting scenes are better than the anime at least</br>  <br>Heavymetalalbumcover .jpg</br>  <br>When is this ?</br>  <br>probably at the ball after the conquest of doldarey</br>   they get off the boat <br> they find Elf village <br> they see Griffith's apostoles were first there <br> they get buttfucked <br> they get Eclipsed <br> they go grimdark </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Elf King is an all-powerful figure that may be guiding Guts and pals via the Moon Child, while Elfheim is a place that can only be entered by elves or those chosen by the elves. Witches and wizards also train there, while Schierke speaks of elves that can predict the future. All of Griffith's apostle army were focused on fighting Ganishka anyway, even if they were told to burn down Elfhelm they'd probably take the time to shipwreck the jRPG party in the process.<br><br>tl;dr - Anons are retarded to think that the island is just some sitting duck for demons.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't the moon child Guts and Caska's son?</br>  <br>No, he might be either:<br> Griffith's son <br>or<br> A guide sent by The Elf King. </br></br></br></br>  <br>That is also possible. I like to go both ways by speculating that the Elf King gives the soul of Guts and Casca's child a blessed body during nights of the full moon in order to steer the former on the right path. Whatever it may be, the child certainly has no demonic aura, which Griffith cannot help but give off.<br><br> Why do some anons spell her name as Caska? Do you drink alcohol from her? </br></br></br>  <br>It was as its best between 14 and 19.</br>  <br> it's those dastardly Hawk scans, i get it mixed some sometimes as well </br>  <br>Casca is what we call Easter here, and it's the exact same pronunciation as well.  Skellig is also an island off our coast, coincidence? </br>  <br>There's also Easter island<br><br>It's like poetry</br></br></br>  <br>If you see this post while scrolling this thread, you have been visited by the Berserk world's true lord and savior. The ability to count to behelits will come to you, but only if you post CASCA BEST GIRL on this thread.</br>    <br>What panel is that upper right image from?</br>  <br>i forget, one of the ones when they fug</br>    <br>nice</br>  <br>Rape</br>  5 DAYS UNTIL NEW CHAPTER<br>ARE YOU GUYS READY?</br>  <br>CASCA BEST GIRL</br>  <br>How long will it take until a translated version is released? <br><br>Or am I gonna have to learn Japanese?</br></br></br>  <br>a day at most</br>  <br>It doesn't take long for an anon fluent in moonspeak to come along and translate it for us, but it can take up to two weeks for Evil Genius to release a proper scanlation.</br>  <br><br>Alright, good to hear</br></br>   Guts gets off the boat <br> gets a new powerup and throws the berserker armour in the trash <br> Caska regains her memory and still loves Guts <br> &gt;you wake up </br></br></br>  <br>It's not her child anymore</br>  <br>Still has baby blood, which caused him to involuntarily save her. Too bad Griffith only wants a meal ticket.</br>  <br>I'm calling it, Casca will become Griffith's only weakness.<br>Oh the irony.</br></br>  This was one of the best fucking pages ever made in manga. Damn miura, DAMN yu.  <br> Casca must die for Guts to defeat Griffith <br> Guts insists on finding another way <br> Casca sacrifices herself <br><br>nothing would prepare me for this</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why are her arms trying to hug him? is she enjoying it?</br>  <br>Kamiyan should voice him.</br>  <br>Of course. She even kissed him back.<br>Griffith became an expert at it after all. Add to that the fact she's always been madly in love with him.<br>I think part of why she's so fucked up now is because she enjoyed the rape in front of her lover. She became the bitch she always knew she were.<br>The shame and disgust was too much for anyone to handle.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Literally copypasta from the 3-Gatsu Lion spread tribute <br><br>Lazy faggot.</br></br></br>  <br> She became the bitch she always knew she were. <br>You're taking this a little far. Why do you hate Casca so much?</br></br>  <br>She always knew it mang</br>  <br>I think that anon was trying to insinuate that Casca would cause Griffith to hesitate if he were about to land the killing blow on Guts during the final battle, which would allow Guts to finish him off once and for all.<br><br>Then they have sex over his dead body.<br><br><br>It's just bait. People have been raging over the rape for decades. Even I, the honorable Cascafag, had the same problem, but then I had the best fap in ages to it and saw the light. Now I just tell people that Casca can give you more orgasms than the average hentai, but don't go fapping to webm related.<br><br> b-but Cascafag, that doesn't sound right <br><br>It doesn't really matter if she enjoyed it or not. If she did, then I wouldn't really blame her for it, wise magical rape raven and all that. If she didn't, then Femto can give the Rapeman a run for his money. We should just want what's best for her at this point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking Guts... He is literally perfect in every way.</br>  <br>Casca would never attack Griffith though. She'd probably kill herself if he dies because of her.</br>  <br>Why does Casca look whiter in the movies than in the manga?</br>  <br> Caska <br><br>le trashman face</br></br></br>   trying to stream Golden Age Arc 3 <br> can't go full screen <br><br>HELP</br></br></br>  <br>Post the rest</br>  <br>Now, here's the thing people take too far - Casca's worship of Griffith. They all say she'll return to him or attempt to justify the Hawks' sacrifice, but she recognizes Griffith's betrayal during the Eclipse and asks him (obviously with no response) if this was "the nightmare you wanted". When most of Casca's plot during the Golden Age was her trying to accept herself as more than just a pawn under Griffith's thumb, it'd be kinda boring for her to to take a step back. I'd prefer for her to come to terms with the reality of her situation, connect with the rest of the group and attempt to talk Guts out of his suicide mission against Griffith. Obviously it won't work, but with Griffith and Charlotte having tea parties in Falconia they could also take some time out to recuperate and train for the fight back.<br>Making progress, moving forward, growing stronger, these would be good things for her character.

Even if she did want to come back, it's too far, she doesn't know where he is, and the amount of Apostles around Falconia would result in her dying instantly. <br> Casca nad Guts fighting together again <br>I need this to happpen</br></br></br>  <br>That was a textbook bros before hoes situation. You'd have to be a major cunt to run off with your lover when the guy who brought you up from nothing is a few bits of skin away from being a spooky skeleton. However, now Griffith is back to full power, he doesn't need her anymore, and Guts and Casca have now unknowingly fulfilled their promise of running away together.<br><br>tl;dr: lrn2plot</br></br></br>    <br>post this one</br>  <br>Did you forget the part where Casca called Griffith her dream and she still couldn't her over her jealousy despite having Guts?</br>    Reminder that Miss Luca is best girl  aight imma find that page  <br>You mean the part that's being dumped now? The one with the shitty Hawk scans? I think it's very realistic for her to not immediately "get over" Griffith, and courageous to admit these feelings to Guts. A part of Casca will always love Griffith, but that doesn't wash out her love for Guts. The two of them are equals.<br><br> no more nitpicking pls <br><br><br>Luca is a woman, not a girl. Show more respect.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>No, I mean this part.<br><br>You know what? I'll go and make a college just for you.</br></br></br>    <br>Nobody will trust collages based on shitty Hawk scans. Go on Bakabt and download the proper stuff, then get back to me.</br>  <br>the message gets across for crying out loud, don't be dense and accept Casca never stopped loving Griffith.</br>    <br> Such differences in dialogue! Hawks scans fucking sucksss <br><br>I know it's a thread meme by now but it gets old when you are told they don't help to support your claims</br></br></br>    <br>Yeah, I said that. Casca would always love Griffith, deep down, but it's the kind of unconditional love anybody would have towards him for saving their life and honing them into a strong, proud warrior. You're dense to think that Casca can't think of anyone else, that Griffith is the only person she cares about.</br>  I'm 30-35 chapters away from the last one, does Guts appearence ever improve? Man he's completely destroyed just look at his face.<br><br>I'm legit feeling sad for him although I've felt sad for him ever since golden arc but this is going off the charts.<br><br><br>Not only that but he seems to start getting signals that he's getting blind due to the armor. I can't see this ending well.<br><br><br>Caska is also starting to piss me the fuck off</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Judeau is cute</br>    I'm still mad there are no RAPE HORSE doujins.  <br>She realizes there's a difference in worship and love, anon. Read here<br><br>What she feels for him is deep-rooted love. And this will never change, because it's what shaped her as a person, it's the core of her character. Even after having lost her virginity to Guts, even after having him deciding to stay with her, she still prefered they part ways. In the end, her love for Griffith was greater than anything.<br>And even when she yells at him "this is the nightmare you wished for?" you can see desperation in her face, but not anger, even if what Griffith did what all she cared about ath the moment.<br>There's never anger in her, not even when she's being raped, not a single "damn you".</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>somehow, yes. i guess magic can heal burnscars.</br>  <br>Guts is best piggyback</br>  <br> those thighs <br>damn grffith u luckyyy</br></br>      Where were you when Casca realized where her heart belonged?    <br>What do you think about Skull Knight being Emperor Gaiseric theory?</br>  <br>He'll be a full-blown cripple by the time he gets off the boat at this rate.</br>  <br>It's obvious.</br>  <br>Not as beautiful as Guts.</br>  Who's this kid?  <br>small oopsie</br>  <br>Guts' bastard child.</br>  <br>PLEASE</br>  Wait...is that a...  What would Griffith do if he saw Casca again?<br><br>Apologize?</br></br>  <br>ye, who the fuck is he? He just dissapeared and we were never told shit about him ever again.<br><br>I'm guessing he's the elf king or some shit</br></br></br>  <br> There's never anger in her, not even when she's being raped, not a single "damn you". <br><br>I think that may have more to do the fact that she's barely conscious.<br><br>Anyway, seeing as you refuse to see how important Casca's love and acceptance of Guts is for her as well as him, there's no point in continuing this argument, everyone knows Casca x Farnese is the canon ending.<br><br><br>I don't understand what this image is trying to convey. I told you not to use the shitty Hawk scans, but nobody listens to the Cascafag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Take that motherfucker out of my sight.<br><br>This is how beautiful real man look.</br></br></br>  <br>i think it's reincarnated flor</br>  Who did it better?  <br>here's the DH one if you want<br><br>for best woman</br></br></br>  <br> I think that may have more to do the fact that she's barely conscious. <br>She still managed to say "don't look", anon.</br></br>  <br>I love how there are little details like that. In most things, they might describe how the protagonist's abilities/equipment fuck them up in some way or another, but short of being bisected or something the small things never get shown.</br>  <br>This is beuty</br>  <br>It's the behelit and Casca's child</br>  <br><br> that what have I done face <br><br>hngh my heart</br></br></br></br>  <br>I forgot, she said no a few times as well. Pic related is when she sees Guts being mauled by demons after trying to rescue her.</br>  poor Guts    <br>He was asking for it tbh.</br>    Was there anything better than Rickert slapping Griffith?<br><br>Miura still has it, gang. This is the greatest series of all time.</br></br>  I've been re-reading the last arc, and I forgot just how many glorious two-page spreads of Falconia Miura drew. No wonder this shit takes months, what the fuck - he's more or less architected the entire city layout.    <br>Does anyone else cringe when they see insanely detailed pages like this in Berserk because of how long it must of took? <br>I don't mean cringe in a bad way but I just feel like oh shit that must of took forever.</br></br>  <br> both Guts and Casca were asking for it <br> they're both branded <br><br>Genuinely made for each other. Griffith x Casca fuckers have been BTFO'd for years.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yet she still came</br>  <br><br>Fuck this! I'm more angry than before!</br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, all the time. I know it's an incredibly popular and well-received series, but it still feels like Miura goes under appreciated.<br><br>Spreads like that take so goddamn long, I can't imagine how much it must hurt to make progress and realize you messed up something and need to do it over.</br></br></br>  <br>You sure it isn't 90% by assistants?</br>  <br>Griffith came, and you're shit at collages. Kill yourself.<br><br><br>People like you are the reason these shitheads keep posted. Stop getting baited.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. The last couple chapters in Falconia are doubly ridiculous on that front - he'll put anywhere from 5-6 of these motherfuckers in one chapter, all with the same level of detail.</br>  <br> Griffith came,  <br>So did Casca, look at her. She's wetter than an otter's pocket.</br></br>  <br>You think what's dripping on the floor is Griffith's cum? KEK</br>  <br>You guys are less cynical than I am. I respect the effort it takes for something like this, but I think he and his team do so many of them because they're not sure where the story is going.<br><br>They're just filling up space.</br></br></br>  <br> wetter than an otter's pocket <br><br><br> using kek <br><br>No, it's Slan's cum.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most girls just get normally wet in intercourse without even squirting.</br>  Will ufotable impress us this episode?  Whose this fucking semen demon  <br>Alisa who should be introduced this episode</br>  We're guaranteed to have some delicious under-boob and midriff. Yes, it's gonna be a good episode.  Can only get better after this underwhelming first episode.  <br>If only we had a better MC</br>  <br>Why she not wearing bra? <br>Why Nana wear bra?</br></br>  <br>Because she's russian</br>  <br><br> Going into battle in harsh terrain dressed like that </br></br>  <br>I want to lick her armpits.</br>  <br>Yeah, what was up with all the random transitions? I hope that wasn't too related to the troubles ufotable was(is?) having for this series.<br><br>Then again, I'd be happy just to see Alisa animooted.</br></br></br>  Looks like the next episode is streaming in a one hour  <br> thinks complaining about practicality of outfits in a Chinese cartoon is a great show of wit </br>    <br>why doesn't ufotable use their usual artstyle?<br><br>did Hirao choose it?</br></br></br>  <br><br> dat character design <br>Still every bit as hot as during the first time I first saw her during my first playthrough</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not trying to be clever.

Fuck off, nigger.</br></br>  <br>I think it's following the game story</br>  Okay I've been googling God Eater but I'm only finding God Eater Burst. Is that the first game or am I retarded?  <br>Stop being a retard and read the wiki entry.</br>  <br>Burst is the first game but updated. It also has extra story after the original GE story ends.</br>  <br>First game with an additional storyline  to bring Lindow back ;_; </br>  <br>The first game, God Eater was never localized. The enhanced version, God Eater Burst was localized as Gods Eater Burst.</br>  <br>Gina a best!

Simple as that. If they do proceed with the idea that Alisa falls for MC, what does that mean for the manga released, particularly 2nd Break? Will 2nd break not be considered canon anymore along with the other manga released? Hell, were they even canon in the first place? Or will they just retcon everything?</br>  <br>Looks like Kill la Kill from the thumbnail.</br>  <br>Kannagi Yuu is canon in the second game.</br>  Why do people seem not to like Yuu here?<br>Haven't read the manga</br>  <br>He's too bishie is the general consensus here.</br>  <br>No, it was boring as fuck despite nice visuals.</br>  <br>Adding that truth in the picture, it's a wonder why they decided to go with Renka as the MC then. What they should have done was made Yuu the MC and then made alterations to his character. He was, after all, a blank slate in the game. Except for instances where he loses his cool   when he pinned Ren to the wall  , delivered the 'don't give up on living' speech, he's practically blank and can be molded accordingly.<br><br><br>I'm guessing some of the hate stems from Summer Wars. Yuu is practically quiet in the game, save some for the usual grunts and generic mission lines of course. Only mutters that 'don't give up on living speech' at the end.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The CG is great.Also, much better than doing them 2D and sacrifcing details. I say the best way to judge would be to wait and see how the more detailed Aragami look</br>  <br>Shit I mean 'Don't run away from living'. My bad.</br>  Can we all agree that the anime is a disappointment?  <br>Yuu is as canon as Minato Arisato and Souji Seta</br>  <br>I don't particularly mind the new MC since the games are what matters. They are making GE Resurrection so I figure they thought too many same thing is overkill. Even not all the manga have the same protag.</br>  <br>Yes because old handdrawn monsters before the CG advent were really not detailed? They used CG because it is better in the limited timeframe they have but if they were handdrawn they wuld've looked 100% better.</br>  <br> CG is great <br> CG <br> great <br> ever </br></br></br></br>    <br>Nope. Because to begin with, I'm smart enough to not expect anything to begin with. It's your own fault that you're dissapointed, because you expected too much<br>Also<br> Judging an entire show based on a single episode <br>Total retardation</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ciel is heaven or sky in french  if I remember correctly </br>  <br>No the name Kannagi Yuu is very canon as it is in the sequel,  if you don't import your GE1 save . Not some fan speculation or side manga.</br>  <br>More like Yu Narukami as his name is actually acknowledged by the sequels.</br>  <br>Ufo don't have the talent to do that, so they went for CG. Stop using that excuse. It implies the pepole responsible for that are available to Ufo<br><br>Go watch Etotama and Majestic Prince, CG hater-kun</br></br></br>  <br> Judging an entire show based on a single episode <br>It's anime so it's not hard to guess.</br></br>  <br>Why are you here if you hate anime so much, and think it's so predictable you can judge entire shows based on a single episode?</br>  <br> watching shit <br>Fuck off, shiteater-chan.</br></br>  <br> Also, much better than doing them 2D and sacrifcing details.

Too much shitposting</br></br></br>  <br>http://godeater.wikia.com/wiki/Pred<wbr>ator_Style<br><br>Predator Style is a new feature to be introduced in God Eater Resurrection.<br><br>The standard Control Unit feature has been completely removed. In its place, new devour options have been added. In addition to the standard (charge) and combo devours, there are now "quick," "step," and "air" devour possibilities.<br><br>Additionally, individual control units can be equipped to each of these devour options, each carrying abilities covering various functionality. Examples of these ability types include Attack (攻撃), containing abilities such as those that boost attack power or bullet effectiveness; Defense (防御), containing abilities such as those that boost defensive power or element resistance; Auxiliary (補助), containing abilities such as those that boost Oracle intake or charge speed; and Special (特殊), containing abilities such as those that boost allies' stats.<br><br>These abilities can be activated for the duration of the current Burst gauge (either gained through devouring or by devouring during an already-active burst) by executing the corresponding devour option. Executing a Charge devour, for example, will activate the ability tied to the Charge devour option. Which abilities are currently active are denoted by colored bars above the player's Burst gauge: red for Charge, white for Quick, yellow for Combo, green for Step, and blue for Air.<br><br>As seen in the gifs below, the combo devour has been modified into a wide, sweeping blade attack that can easily devour multiple targets at once. There is also a devour type that transforms the player's God Arc into a jet thruster assembly, allowing for "hit and run" style devouring wherein the player can devour and immediately propel themselves away. Additionally, the standard charge devour has been modified into the three-pronged version seen below.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br> being this fucking mad <br>Go back to /v/, illiterate.</br></br>  <br>Good job listing the synopsis.

Disregarding for a moment the nonsense plot, the whole directing is completely rubbish. No sense of flow, no aesthetics, it's just random pandering scenes pieced together in a desperate attempt to make some money from the degenerate otaku. Don't even get me started on all the blur and bloom, the terrible CGI, all the forced animation, etc.<br><br>ＦＵＣＫＩＮＧ　ＤＲＯＰＰＥＤ</br></br>  <br>Except that she's cuter</br>  <br>I think his voice is OK-ish but there is no reason to cast like 100 dude just for this role.</br>  <br> that chin can pierce the heavens <br> cuter <br>Yeah, if you like men, faggot.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128299888 <br>What about you?</br>  <br>But aren't anime compared on average mainly?

You're right anon.</br>  <br>Funny you mention that. I found nisekoi to be shit until about the third episode. Got a better feel for the characters around then when the show had calmed down a bit and actually really liked it.</br>  <br>wow, they really don't like it.</br>  <br>kerk everyone dislikes it</br>  <br>55% for 5 and 25% for 4 isn't that bad.</br>  <br>but 7/10 is average and 5 is unwatchable shit, anon.</br>  <br>It's actually really shit. Considering Japans give 5's super easily, not even being able to achieve over 70% 5 means it is complete shit.</br>  <br>The other way around then, fucking japs.</br>  <br>you don't know what you are saying, honestly</br>  <br>What was the score for the first episode?</br>  <br>Majority for 5.</br>  <br>Jesus. I think the lowest UBW ever got was like, an 88. And that was for the episode where they did the censored sex scene.</br>  <br>Video game adaptations are bound to be shit</br>  <br>And now we have a little over half who voted for a 5. Damn shame then.</br>  <br>It's not really about adding the %, 55 by itself it's pretty bad coming from ufo.</br>  Ufotable shouldve listen to the fans  Why do I even watch this shit  <br>Shit design, the game and anime are much better</br>  <br>For uninteresting girl whose only redeeming factor are great body and lewd clothes.</br>  <br>That's all I need</br>  Daily reminder that ufotable is much more capable, they're just being retarded and risky with that artistic design.  <br>it damn Opening song that keeps on making me watch and also the monsters</br>  <br>I'm not surprised with the Nico rating considering they spent almost half of the episode just for fighting Vajra and there is barely any progress on the actual story.</br>  <br>all the show has to do is<br> character development <br> good pacing <br> a few monster fights  <br> and some unexpected surprises <br> some underboob fan service <br>and everything will run smoothly it a simple job<br>take notes Ufotable</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh and <br> progressing the story </br></br>  <br>Yeah, quite a shame.</br>  <br>This webm gives me cgi trauma</br>  I really like all the characters in this, especially Lindow. The animation is shit but at least its different than the boring as fuck normal Ufotable animation.<br> Its already better than UBW </br>  has the episode been subbed yet  <br>No you idiot. This just a short intro, of course it would move a lot more. The new art style is way better than this.</br>  <br>But that looked like ass anon. That was some SHAFT level animation.</br>  <br>The animation is shit in this webm. It's full of one frame instant motions and moving slideshows</br>  Who the fuck was that Erik guy who died  <br>why didn't they use this artstyle again?</br>  <br>10 mins.</br>  <br>This is too fast, my eyes can barely keep up.</br>  <br> The new art style is way better than this. <br>You can't be serious, even though I like it, GE2 style is way better.</br></br>  The CG monster would look better if they used literally the same models from the game  <br>Too bad you he's not here for too long</br>  <br>that's just usual Hirao fighting scene<br><br>I mean, https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=B5J<wbr>MZm5m1o8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  Why was the doctor staring at semen demons chest  <br>What a shame Hirao couldn't get Tetsuya Takeuchi to work on God Eater this time, the latter's work in KnK 5 was great.</br>  <br>Who wouldn't</br>  <br>She's his guinea pig</br>  <br><br>I guess it's more of source material problem since there are only characters introduction and tutorial missions on the early part of the game.<br><br>Character development and actual story progression don't happen until almost halfway on the game.</br></br></br></br>  What the fuck is this faggot doing?  <br>Oh you, she is pretty much used goods.</br>  <br>He's basically edge:the character</br>  <br>He is best boy, dont talk shit.</br>  <br>GE2 was literally every anime ever.</br>  <br>Why are her straps fucked up?</br>  <br>Why is he touching my slav so casually? <br>DROPPED</br></br>  <br><br>Even though MC covered him from the tail attacks, he ran away.<br><br>Looks like your normal edgy faggot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>he's mirin those gains</br>  <br>Don't talk shit about best character, this motherfucker right here might act like a big tsundere but he's always got your back.<br><br>He doesn't like seeing his friends die.</br></br></br>  LOOK AT THEM TITTIES  <br>Is this the only service shot in the whole episode or what</br>  <br>He saves your shit way too many fucking times in the game.<br><br>He is just a big tsundere.</br></br></br>  <br> talking shit on Soma </br>  <br>Why are you here if you didn't watch it?</br>  <br> Even it's (300k+0+0+0+0+0)/6, it will still beat all other shows. <br>Not all those '300k' potential customers are going to buy the bundled version of the game, you moron.

But after helping her after she recovers from the hospital she becomes softer. She goes fully dere for leader in the 2nd Break manga too if that's any consolation</br>  <br> Gina <br>Good like trying to sneak up on an Aragami with her on your team.</br></br>  The fuck is this animation?<br> 2015 <br> Character movement still don't have weight and impact in animation. </br></br>  <br> sneaking up on Aragami <br>Are you playing MonHun clone or MGS?</br></br>  <br> Yuu gave her that stupid hat she wears in GE2 <br><br>Why does he have shit taste in clothing?</br></br></br>  <br> Gina <br> best companion <br>Oh please, tell me more.

Geez</br></br>  <br><br>fuck off /v/ermins</br></br>  <br> thinking game adaptations will not be swarmed by /v/retches <br>Joke's on you, I am from /tv/.</br></br>  <br>Anon, the animation average is at its highest now since the transition to digital cels. But this one is really bad. I mean fucking Kyoukai no Kanata had more impact to character movements than this and that's not even mentioning projects by staff that is accustomed to anikmating action anime.</br>  so is alisa the strongest god eater cus she just claimed that statement in this episode  <br>new types have a huge advantage over old types, that's for a fact.<br>she is the strongest god eater in her place, since she's the only new type.<br>soon she'll be all over the MC's dick, don't worry.</br></br></br>  <br> Comparing anyone to Kyoani <br>That's stupid as fuck. What does your 'even" mean, Kyoani has some pretty good action animator you know? Just because they don't make much fighting anime doesn't mean shit to their skill set which is so much better than anyone else.<br><br>I'm not saying God Eater having shit action is normal though. But considering their already fucked up production, I expected worse.</br></br></br></br>  JULIUS IS MAI HUSBANDO!  So which person did the OST for this anime it's actually really good  <br>KyoAni's works are all done inhouse. And they haven't done any action scenes outside of the few Haruhi ones. So for them to surpass the action animation of a studio who's only claim to fame is action shows is really embarrassing for Ufotable and Bamco.</br>  <br>I did.</br>  <br>Go Shiina<br><br>You should listen to the game's OST. See </br></br></br>   this scene <br>Poetry<br><br>Also based Ufo giving meaning to Eric's death. God tier adaptation so far.</br></br></br>  Is that only me or somehow this shit looks full CG to me, and the animation sometime is as stiff as CG too jesus.<br> tfw you will never have quality animated scenes like KnK by Ufo again </br>  <br>Everyone is embarrasing.<br>Also they're rushing the fuck out of GE, you can't compare them like this. Kyoani not only has good animators, they have a much better production line.<br>Meanwhile GE was pushed back 2 weeks and still manage to have more detailed art than most anime, they actually tried to make something different for the character art.</br></br></br>  <br> banana peel hair <br>Heh</br></br>  <br>heh</br>  <br>He still died to an Ogretail regardless.</br>   Kyoanus lickers thinking their studio is any good and shitting on others <br>Why can't the just die?<br>The animation here is fine, and this is also more interesting and entertaining that 99% of Kyoanus' crap</br></br>  <br>*they</br>  <br>Yeah but in the game he died because he was distracted. Saving Lenka made him look much better.</br>  <br>Only the monsters are full CG. Characters are hand-drawn.<br>Try watching a release that is not encoded by horriblesubs.</br></br>  requesting a anon to make a gif for the jet fighting scene  <br>kek</br>  <br>At least he didn't die like a faggot this time</br>  <br><br>My dick was not ready for her</br></br>  Miss Crazy Friendly Fire Kanon and best sniper Gina had screentime :)  MC is so fucking dull. I like his VA though and that deeper voice. It's a nice change from all the whiny sounding MCs. Was nice to see him actually get thrown in prison for disobeying because that rarely happens but he still got out because PRIVILEGED SNOWFLAKE. Alisa is super hot although it seriously bothers me how she only uses one of her suspender straps. <br><br>All in all this was a pretty shit episode to follow up with the first. I feel like it could have been cut in half really.</br></br>  <br>Kanon's kanons &gt; Alisa's &gt; alisas &gt; old hag tits</br>  Holy shit the animation is just getting worse. Lindow is the only character I can stand, Major Tits is taking bitchiness to a new level. MC is just a blank slate and Alisa didn't seem to mind the old hag doctor feeling her up so she probably pleases old men.<br><br>Ufotable flop</br></br>  <br>Sure would have been so much interesting if he was just left in prison forever right?</br>  <br> Animation is fine. <br> Better than anything. <br>I too enjoy characters living in zero gravity zones on earth. How the fuck is this animation acceptable in 2015 when Myazaki was shitting on people for mistakes like this since 1989 is beyong my comprehension.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually yes. Then a more interesting character could be the MC maybe.</br>    <br>All other characters are on the same level of generic tbh, with the exception of Lindow maybe</br>  <br>What do you mean, you shitposter?</br>  <br> Movies <br> comparable to tv <br><br>Fuck off</br></br></br></br>  <br>Better than unlimited shit works and its ginger gary stu shitrou</br>  So far I can say<br> MC - 1\5 <br> other character - 3.5/5 <br> animation - 4\5 <br> OP/ED - 4.5\5 <br> OST - 5\5 <br> story - not decided <br> pacing 3\5 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Subscribed.</br>  <br>She is not hitting anyone!?!?</br>  <br>Well there are some characters with potential but we still got 10 episode to decide that</br>  <br>A vast improvement over their previous work I would say. Director and composer really make a difference.</br>  <br>If you knew what I'm talking about you would fuck off. Myazaki was criticizing tv shows not movies. He was criticizing tv animators because they churn out garbage and are generally satisfied with it when it doesn't even make physical sense. <br><br> He doesn't like the shitty animation that I enjoy <br> Must be a shitposter. <br>Anon people tend to have weight and impact in their muscles and movements. Good animation conveys that. Shitty animation shows them going through the whole episode just by inertia. GE is the latter.</br></br></br></br></br>  Just finished this new episode, I think it's either they ran out of budget or can not made it in time. The animation was very lazy and the character is like a fucking stone even the shading won't help.<br><br>Now, I know why Nip don't like it even Alisa's underboob can not help this show.</br></br>  <br>This. Totally not canon</br>  <br>b-but the cg is good!!!<br><br>a-a-and the music!!</br></br></br>  Reminder that if you started watching anime in 2015 you shouldn't post in /a/ at all, only lurk. Fuck off cancer.  <br>op sucks. Op in game much better</br>    <br>bait?</br>  <br>I don't see anything of what you're complaining about. Please, fuck off. You're calling the animation shitty when it isn't. The problem is that it's different<br><br> Lazy <br>It's better than almost everything else this season. <br>Also, they actually have production issues. Episode 1'screening had to be canceled, and the actual airing was delayed 1 week</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is this expression saying?</br>  <br> Miyazaki's movies <br> giving him any platform to speak from <br><br>They can't even draw two different faces, he's in no place to criticize.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope you aren't implying people can only like God Eater if they started watching anime in 2015, shitposter-kun</br>  <br>they managed to make kanon look like a good comrade</br>  What the fuck happened here, jesus christ.  <br>You fuck off, newly. The animation is a abomination and you don''t even know about it at all. Do as this anon said  and fuck off.</br>  <br> animation - 4\5 <br><br>Anon, something is very wrong right here.</br></br></br>  <br>There are 7 BD volumes so we still got 11 episodes.</br>  Why did ufotable make this type of MC I feel like he dosn't fit in with the other character. <br>The only thing I like about him is that he dosn't rage like Yuu and Eren</br>  <br>Canon ingame never hits you unless you get directly in front of her (or she gets behind you) so that scene is still...canon</br>  <br> You're calling the animation shitty when it isn't. The problem is that it's different <br><br>It's both: shitty AND different.</br></br></br>  <br> Myazaki's movies <br> Not a platform to be smug about animation even when compared to other movies. <br>And this is seriously laughable when an Ufo drone says it because they have a serious case of sameface that can't be cured even outside of Takeuchi's designs.</br></br></br>  <br> a abomination <br><br>How about you fuck off until you finish grade school.</br></br></br>  <br>You forgot your bait image attached to the post, /v/ermin.</br>  <br>Go fuck yourself back to reddit, cancer.</br>  <br>Anon, the animation isn't different. The artstyle is. The camera work is the regular Hirao style wether you like or not but the animation is an abomination that should not happen in the 2nd half of 2k15.</br>  <br>the reason I gave it that score was because I was able to adapt to this type of animation. <br>I also like how the animation was executed.<br>What I don't like is that the characters barely move</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, 7 bds make it 11 episodes</br>  <br>Nice boogeymaning.<br>Completely wrong, though</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128306716 <br>reddit-kun, you do understand that what you posted serves you as well, right?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128306716 <br> all caps <br> WGSGSAEHRG  <br> CDCSDFSD  <br>wow</br></br></br></br>  <br> It's better than almost everything else this season. <br> Also, they actually have production issues.

NNB is an actual shit show.

At this rate it will become the best video game adaptation.  <br>You're implying it's shit. Thing is, it isn't and you're brainwashed by all the shitposting</br>    <br>Because clearly what is a good show and good animation isn't a matter of tastes. <br>Clearly, there's some objective way of measuring it that you know because you're an special snowflake who knows better than those plebs and has been blessed with the knowledge of how to objectively judge anime. <br>Fuck off</br></br></br>   complaining about Ufotables animation <br> THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE <br><br>Go complain in a Jitsu wa Watashi wa thread or some lerche show.</br></br></br>  not only she got nice boobs she's got a nice ass?<br>I bet that old man gave her a good time</br>  <br> HIS STATEMENT GOES AGAINST THE SHITPOSTING HIVEMIND. MUST BE BAIT. <br>Shitposter plz</br></br>  animation was AIDS in ep1<br><br>not as bad this time around. story still seems bland though</br></br>    <br>lol fatekids</br>  <br>But I started the shitposting anon. I'm IRC and I'm actually targeting the show :^)..<br>Seriously though anyone with eyes can see the zero gravity chamber that the show takes place in.<br><br> He says that unironically while posting in a GE thread. <br>Anon GE isn't even the best animated shounen of this season. Ushio to Tora by the newbie studio MAPPA has a better animation quality than this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you really so autistic that you think every opinion different to your own is bait?</br>  What the fuck is with these threads anyways?,i just see<br> hur dur the animation <br> hur dur newfag <br> hur dur bait <br>it like all /a/ comes here to shitpost<br><br>also  vajra best girl </br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>You know animation can be judged by physics and laws right? If an animation doesn't make sense and it is not going for a surreal style then it's shit. There is no way around it.</br>  <br> people who don't share my opinions must be blind <br>Contrary to what /a/ would have you think, there is no objective way of judging anime. <br>Everything is subjective<br>Also, UtT being better than GE still doesn't make GE shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because bad animation and CG triggers /a/. Go to any 3.33 thread and you'll find the same shit because it was an embarrassment as far as animation went. And this trumps that in terms of shitiness. So you can assume that /a/ would complain about it.</br>  <br> muh laws <br> muh physics <br>Keep trowing buzzwords shitposter-kun</br></br></br>  <br>I am the bait of my sword</br>  <br>Nice shitpost.</br>  <br>Art major spotted</br>  <br>Please refer to the  post. GE isn't going for a surreal animation. And it doesn't make sense in a physical way. So yeah it is shit objectively.</br>  <br> muh opinions are objective <br> muh laws of physics in anime <br><br>Shitposters are not even trying nowadays</br></br></br></br>  <br> Stuff doesn't need to make sense because I can't understand the laws behind it. <br>It's like the people who don't get triggered by the Yaoi hands because they don't understand the basics of anatomy.</br></br>  <br>Keep shitposting with your buzzwords.</br>  <br>This guy gets it.</br>  <br>fuck off tumblr, we can still tell its you.</br>    <br> good animation isn't a matter of tastes. <br> Clearly, there's some objective way of measuring it <br><br>Actually, yes.<br>Animation is probably one aspect that is easily identifiable as good or bad. And stuff like  is clearly bad.<br><br> because you're an special snowflake who knows better than those plebs and has been blessed with the knowledge of how to objectively judge anime. <br><br>At the very least I'm better than you.<br>According to you, no one is ever allowed to voice criticism because "everyone is entitled to their own opinion". Don't get me wrong, you are free to have your own opinion, but this doesn't mean the reasons for your opinion are justified.<br><br>If you aren't allowed to dislike things, just because somewhere in the world there is an autistic faggot who disagrees then we are never allowed to judge anything and there is no such thing as a "good" show or movie, because of your relativist crap.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> ufotable excels at 2D animation <br> their 3D animation is great too <br><br>Not Sanzigen level but still above average, how do they do it?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Godwin's law <br>You just lost the argument with your pic. No need to even look at your post<br>Nazi analogies make your argument automatically worthless</br></br></br>  the shitposter from last week is in this thread please R E M O V E him. <br><br> He keeps saying "fuck off cancer" and generally speaks in broken english. </br></br>  <br>Not him but<br> Taking internet shitposting rules as actual laws. <br>You're straight up retarded anon. Pantsu over head retarded.</br></br></br>  <br> No need to even look at your post <br><br>And this, my friends is how you come to like a show such as GE. Just don't look at it and it's fine.</br></br></br>  /v/ defence force outpost in this thread, all of my lels  <br>But there is anon. It either makes sense or not. The melee NGE made sense in animation 20 years ago with little to no budget. Meanwhile tthe whole GE anime doesn't have any justification.</br>  GE produced some odd doujins when it came out.<br><br>Questionable art too.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Is it me or does this show look like asshole?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't know shit about animation <br>Hilarious</br></br>  <br>It's not just you. But /v/ posters would complain that you've been brainwashed by shitposting.</br>  <br>It's just you and all the shitposters</br>  <br> Maaya Hackamoto <br>What the fuck that even mean? I get that according to /a/ all writers and directors are hacks but what is wrong with her?</br></br>  <br>Just you and your shit tastes.</br>  <br> ANYONE WHO LIKES WHAT THE /a/ SHITPOSTING HIVEMIND HAS DEEMED SHIT MUST BE FROM /v/. <br>Nice boogeyman. Completely wrong</br></br>  <br>I guess you were right since </br>  Sakuya should have been voiced by Sawashiro.  <br>You sure showed me IRC-Kun.</br>  <br>it's the shitposters making the show look more worser than it did</br>  Is there a english patch for godeater 2?  <br><br>Guess I'll go back to /v/ then.</br></br>  GE2 adaptation announced after GE ends, f/a/ggot asswreckage will be glorious.  Not even giving this 3 episodes, what the fuck is wrong with the flow of the show.  <br> There is also a devour type that transforms the player's God Arc into a jet <br>Stopped reading there<br>I'm sold</br></br></br>  <br> No hannibal <br>The first time breaking his back was fucking awesome. Thanks HDH.</br></br>  Can you STOP fapping to Russian girls, сука  <br>I don't think it will happen unless this one is actually adapting GE 1 Burst story.</br>  <br><br>Cryska superior russkie</br></br>  <br>Meh. Opinion’s only soured slightly from last week, and it was already at “mostly very boring.” This episode thankfully continued the silence thing for the first half, but that made all the bellowing BGM in the second half stand out even more. They couldn’t resist whipping out the melodramatic piano when he realized that Redshirt died protecting him… long, long, after the battle was over due to people not finishing their kills, or synthy rap of all things for the funeral portion. Yes, that’s what he would have wanted. Soulful rapping.<br><br>It’s still going nowhere very slowly, the characters are about as interesting as varnish, and the action is absolutely nothing to write home about. Even the little not exact effective visual direction stuff was pretty much gone this week. UFOTable, you lost your soul when someone took away your clay. But it did add a girl in a kilt with ass cleavage. Apparently that’s supposed to make up for it. Well, that and being the only show on Sunday period plus Sunday to Wednesday being… unpleasant. Feh.</br></br></br>  <br> Thinking /a/ can be assblasted by any anime announcement after the Free announcement. <br>Every doesn't give a shit anymore. Shit ani,e tend to have 2nd and even 3rd seasons.</br></br>  <br><br>Come on no one can be this retarded, or is plenty stupidity a default characteristic to enjoy this garbage?</br></br>  Can Ufotable just stick with Type-Moon and stop touching anything else?<br><br>They fucked up Gyo so badly...</br></br>  Confused as fuck. Can anyone confirm whether /a/ likes this or not? I can't tell with the shitposting both ways  <br>please no more fate shit</br>  Good night sweet prince  What a boring episode. The artistic liberties they took are only degrading the material. The choreography in fights are also cringeworthy.<br><br>Giving it the 3 episode rule but I doubt this crap will get better next episode.</br></br>  <br>Seems to me that half the people think it's complete garbage and everyone else is trying to say it isn't /complete/ garbage.</br>  which anime studio other that Ufotable would've made this anime better  <br> please no more fate shit <br><br>There's also Ataraxia, HF, Extra, Apocrypha, GO to adapt into anime!</br></br></br>  <br>Even their Fate went to shit anon. They should give it to Shaft. And direct shitty anime like GE forever.</br>  <br>I don't know how can anyone find this series bad. I mean, I know I started watching anime only this year (like steins gate) but my opinion is still relevant.</br>  <br>KyoAni.</br>  <br> Even their Fate went to shit anon. They should give it to Shaft. And direct shitty anime like GE forever. <br><br>Not really, you are simply overreacting. It's on par with F/Z and it's just nothing special but it's certainly not "shit". <br>Just the whole concept of Fate is so old it looks outdated and stupid.</br></br></br></br>  <br> fate <br> shaft <br><br>CCC seems ok for me https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Grl<wbr>Lqnc3vlI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>MAPPA, Bones and Sunrise 9 would've all made this better.

Fate UBW gets a blank check from /a/ because of the really good Epilogue and Prologue. But honestly EP 19 and 21 are puke worthy. And everything else is meh.

Lenka should hook up with Hibari or Licca.</br>  <br><br>But F/Z was objectively good. Denying it is delusion and only shows how new you are. Lurk more.</br></br>  <br><br>That would be bullshit. They need to fuck.</br></br>  <br>It's the least she can do after all the shit she's gonna put him through to help her get over her PTSD.</br>  you know looking at this clip it makes wan't to continue watching it.<br>the last clip actually shows the characters showing emotion unlike the the last two episode</br>   ufotable brings in a bunch of directors to polish the hell out of what is basically Gunslinger Stratos 2: horrible character designs boogaloo <br>What a turd this show is. I could tell it was going to be bad in the first 2 minutes.</br>  so was this guy supposed to be the main character  <br>Hibari belongs to Tatsumi.<br><br>Alisa already has a canon love interest and Licca is best girl and shouldn't hook up with this train wreck MC.<br><br>Does Yuki Kaji voice Shun?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, Sawashiro already voicing Ren.</br>  <br>Looks like a fag, hot-blooded Lenka is better.</br>  <br>He's the main character, in the canon manga and novels and the manga connects with the second game.<br><br>I forgot how big those things were on their wrist.<br><br>They probably for whatever reason wanted to try something different even though they have an already established MC, Yuu isn't great but hot blooded MCs aren't either.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Like fag, you say? Bruh, please he's  fabulous. </br></br>  Would this be a better crew than the current strawhats?  <br>It would steamroll opponents far faster. Sanji replaced by Sabo as the token blonde strong guy, Kyros replacing Brook as the old guy with a sad long past, Law replacing Nami as the sex appeal, and Bellamy replacing Chopper as the weakling mascot character.</br>  I'd want Brook and Sanji back. I don't care if their gags got annoying, I like them.<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128297818 <br>Good riddance.</br></br></br>  You'd think Law would cover himself properly like Robin when he sleeps. I guess he's had enough bad influence that he just morphs into the other Strawhats. <br><br>I also like how Usopp just crawled into Luffy's bed.</br></br>  It's basically the Strawhats but much better.<br><br>So, yes</br></br>  <br>i think it's a call back to how he slept as a child from his flashback with corazon. mouth open with same posture.</br>  <br>Who is the guy sleeping next to Kyros?</br>  <br>Bellamy</br>  <br>Christ, I can't even tell if his mouth is open or not.<br>Makes sense though<br><br><br>Binami.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well there's a close up shot of him pretty soon after</br>  <br>Turns out I'm super retarded this week. Who knew.<br><br> Thank you Anon </br></br></br>  the ultimate master ruseman  <br>no worries</br>  Do you think that this crew could be more entertaining than strawhats ?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128298093 <br>Such a shame Sabo has already left.</br>    <br> ruseman <br>Say the truth is not a ruse .</br></br>  Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji will always be the original and the only Straw Hat Pirates for me.

I need it for something. Preferably something LQ like the Doffy's in pic related.  <br>Luffy, Zoro, Nami will always be the original and the only Straw Hat Pirates for me. The other irrelevant 'additions' are meat shields and fodders for Luffy's goal to become the pirate king.<br><br><br>Please stop adding more irrelevant characters and letting them join in the crew.</br></br></br></br>  Who are those in the picture?  <br>Ace is so fucking dumb and selfish it hurts. Even his crewmates are yelling at him to move the fuck on but he STILL wont listen. Didnt he learn from his mistake of going after BB when he was told not to? Pretty much spat on everyone's face that came to save him, allies, crewmates, Whitebeard, Luffy. And the person he was defending ended up dying in the end because of it. <br><br> sabo a superior brother </br></br></br>  <br>Shut the fuck up, Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji is the ORIGINAL crew.</br>  <br>Not the first time.</br>  <br>Shut the fuck up, Luffy, Zoro, Nami is the ORIGINAL crew.</br>  <br> having a crew without a cook and a watch guard <br><br><br>Tell me how are they going to survive the seas without Usopp and Sanji?</br></br></br></br>  <br>stupid Ace. I even felt sorry for the guy when he asked if there were a reason for him being born, but damn he fucked up real bad.</br>  <br>Who's the fuck is Sanji ???</br>  <br> who's <br><br><br>Who*</br></br></br></br>  <br> having a crew with a misogynistic lech and a lying pervert <br><br>Tell me how is Nami's virginity going to survive until marriage with Usopp and Sanji?</br></br></br>  <br><br> don't mock the man who saved me <br><br>Well good job throwing that away twice you fucking retard.</br></br></br></br>  <br> having a crew without a doctor <br> having a crew without a shipwright <br> luffy having a crew without a musician <br> implying robin isnt best girl </br></br></br></br>  <br> Sanji <br> misogynist <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br> treating women differently than men just because they have vaginas <br> not a misogynist </br></br>  <br><br> Sanji <br> misogynist <br><br>u wot m8.<br><br>Also, pretty sure unless Nami's been fucking random dudes, it is still intact on the boat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that was just how he was</br>  <br><br>Yet if he beat women up he'd be called a misogynist too.<br><br>Double standards people.</br></br></br></br>  So, what are the chances of a big fight against Fujitora? I suppose Zoro would have to do the fighting since the other guys are still broken as fuck.  <br>That wouldn't be misogynistic at all.</br>  <br><br>Well tell that to the feminists.</br></br>  <br> treating women differently = misogyny <br>I love it when SJWs change the meaning of the words because reality doesn't support their bullshit.</br></br>  don't start with this misogynistic crap you retarded fucking imbeciles<br><br><br>not very high I'd say, Fuji doesn't seem to be on good terms with Akainu so I don't see why he should go after them.  Not that I wouldn't like it. </br></br></br>  <br>I am a feminist.</br>  <br>I love it when bitter virgins change the meaning of the words because reality doesn't support their bullshit.</br>  <br><br> domestic violence case <br><br>WAAAAHHHHH MISOGYNY<br><br> chivalry <br><br>WAAAHHHH MISOGYNY<br><br>There's no winning, they must be right either way unfortunately.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know. I'm not saying it was out of character or anything. We've already seen him blow his cover at a freaking marine base cause he overheard someone talking smack abt WB. It's still fucking selfishly dumb of him to not keep his emotions in check in that kind of situation. Especially when so many people put their lives on the line to save his life.</br>  <br> robin best girl <br><br><br>Only if we're talking about Strong World version. She is an aging obaa-san that is going to be canon with Franky. Straw Hat Pirates only needs Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji and nothing more. Everybody else is irrelevant.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody in this thread ever claimed it was misogynistic for a man to hit a woman, I claimed it was misogynistic not to just because she is a woman.<br><br>You're retarded.</br></br></br>  <br> trying to win an argument by calling your opponent a virgin <br>You're adorable.</br></br>  <br><br>Not referring to this thread you retard.</br></br>  What is Oda going to do this week during his shonen jump mandated break?  you guys just had to reply to the fucking retard right?

Or is it another case of bounty =/= power?  <br><br>Urouge is Urouge.</br></br>  <br>it is not, as a matter of fact, you are discussing your different views about the meaning of the word 'misogynyst' which doesn't relate to one piece at all, and if someone uses it in a way that doesn't appeal to you to define a character you have no real reason to bump in and start or engage into a completely pointless discussion that involves SJW bullshit and such. These threads can get already bad staying on topic, let's just not discuss this kind of shit further shall we.<br><br> also as you said there's a chance we might summon HIM, now that would be the death of the thread </br></br></br>  <br> looking at a rock is cute <br><br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>I hadn't noticed they weren't there. Where are they?</br>  <br>what does a bounty matter to a superior being?</br>  <br>That was my first post in the thread. I wasn't the guy you were answering to, so I wasn't really "discussing" per se.</br>  I can't wait to see Sanji lie in a pool of his own blood  <br> what does a bounty matter to a superior being? <br>Go back to bed, Bellamy</br></br>  <br>Kyros got the leg back after he regained his old form</br>  <br><br>What does Bellamy have to do with anything? <br><br>We are talking about Urouge.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bellamy has a higher bounty than Zoro.</br>    <br>Not the anon you were talking to, but I like the image. I like the idea of Law being the favorite son. Kind of tragic that one brother ended up killing the other because they had different views of how Law should be brought up.<br><br>Well, yeah, Roci is a marine spy and all that, but I just really like the family kind of theme, okay?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Zoro's is pretty outdated though.</br></br>    <br><br>Yeah I like it too.<br><br>Another thing is, Doffy is a douche etc., but I can fully understand why he killed his brother - he's essentially like an underworld mob boss really.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Admire your commitment, but you need to stop</br>  <br>Well you tell me how many legs does Kyros have in OP's image</br>  This is the shittiest thread we've had in a while.

Doffy might have been an evil person, but Roci had to die after what he did. Doffy had to do it as the head of the family.<br><br>I wonder how he actually felt about Law leaving, too. He saw a part of himself in Law and was hoping the kid would help fuck up the world with him. So much for dreams, Doffy.</br></br></br>  Straw Hats only needs the first 5 crew.  <br>This, the newfags don't realise the trolls true goals and they reply to people like Rebeccafag</br>  <br><br>Yeah, you talk to the Feds, you're donezo.</br></br>  <br> Straw Hats dont need a shipwright who is also a very durable heavy hitter </br>  <br>That's not a number of legs.

Like blowing a house away, because he tripped and afterwards rebuilding it with his men and asking for forgiveness or something, that would be cool</br></br>  <br>one more batshit insane admiral? I can live with that.</br>  <br> Like blowing a house away, because he tripped <br>so Admiral Corozon</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128301995 <br><br> is forbidden <br><br>Because of discrimination laws, social laws are a different thing.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128302066 <br>Dude just leave him alone. Bothering someone because they can't find ain't cool man.</br>  <br>No, I meant destroying it willingly. Like imagine a cute rabbit going around and trips and suddenly turns into a demon destroying everything in sight and afterwards turning into that rabbit again. That would be pretty nasty for anyone.</br>  <br>Green Bull should be different from the other admirals, so...<br> Aokiji: Lazy Justice, chill personality <br> Akainu: Absolute Justice, a zealot and a manipulator <br> Kizaru: Unclear Justice (whatever the fuck that means), acts like a stoner but is pretty ruthless <br> Fujitora: ??? Justice, a gambler with a keikaku <br>I think it'd be good to have a corrupt admiral who makes shady deals and turns a blind eye to his subordinates' crimes. Green Bull's justice could be "fight bad guys with their own methods".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128302220 <br><br>I'm not the racist one, I'm just talking about law.<br><br>It is socially forbidden, I'm not arguing otherwise - but there's a reason social laws don't exist, only social norms.<br><br>Discrimination laws on the other hand, exist and are feasible.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128302148 <br>Are you a 3D grill?<br>Do you really bleed from down there?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128302220 <br>Can i rub my dick on your armpits?<br>That's my fetish...</br></br>  <br>man, that would be awesome.

I don't care if that person was racist,fascist,taoist or misogynist don't assume anything about them</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I always though Fujitora was blind justice<br><br>Either way I'd rather have something like Lost Justice, someone who has the position without having a goal. Like akainu telling him to do something and he does, but only that and nothing more than that. For example if he has to catch doflamingo, he catches doflamingo, but wouldn't capture anyone related to him. That would probably open a lot of new problems which would be cool I guess.</br></br></br>  <br> that fucked up word <br> He <br>this is actually getting funny now, you should seriously consider writing satire</br></br></br>  Based mods.  shitposter-kun got banned it seems.  <br>It's either Impel Down or death unless he gets rescued. <br><br>If Doffy is ever going to be rescued, who's going to do it? The story "implies" that Monet and Vergo are "dead". I know it's debatable for people about Monet being dead, but that's what the story has so far.</br></br></br>  What if green bull was a woman? We've seen zoro and luffy attack women as long as sanji doesn't fight green bull it could work.  <br>Won't know till he's introduced.<br>Personally, I doubt it.</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry if I get offended because everyone assumes all anons have penises on 4chan.</br>  <br>His bounty was that because 108 is a significant number, he's probably as strong as the others, I'd say at least stronger than Killer, Zoro and Bonney. Maybe Bege too.</br>  <br>Are you retarded??<br>Or do you not know that breaking social laws can put you behind bars in America?</br></br>  <br>With how Dressrosa is completely destroyed, the crew isn't complete, everyone is very injured and Fujitora is already there with CP0 coming to the island, I can't see how they'll be able to party. They probably would have to do it in the ship once they leave with whoever.</br>  Seems like it's safe again.<br><br><br> Search for "bread trafalgar law" on ff.net. . Pay heed because it's nearly as sad as Rapunzel.</br></br></br>  <br>Women don't belong on the internet retard.</br>  <br>Why?

Or have you never heard of the first amendment?</br></br>  <br><br>They are classed as 'social laws' by laymen - but you are breaking the actual discrimination acts which provide the offences.<br><br>If you get me.<br><br>What I mean by a social law, is the flowery stuff which doesn't create an offence which people think should do, not the discrimination offences themselves.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Seriously, how did Fuji get appointed to admiral?

Can he just sense Luffy's potential ? Or is he drawn to his strength ? I know Mihawk said that Luffy can turn people into allies and what not but likewise Urouge has said that Zoro is not the type to follow others.  How can anybody like ussop?

Just look at this glorious motherfucker.<br>But to be serious for a moment, I didn't really get the admiral vibe from Fuji at all. Whenever the other 3 showed up, you knew shit was about to go down. Not so with him for some reason. At least for me.</br></br>  <br>His accent, and he's talking about paella. I investigated, and he's called El Risitas, he's from Sevilla, Spain.</br>  <br> speedreaders </br>  <br>Now you do. The anime may have downplayed it a little, I don't know.

It's just not right to look at. It's socially and universally unacceptable.

He was impressive but I think Fujitora's meteors might rival that.</br>  <br><br> Spanish and Mexican are the same friggin thing <br> Caucasian and Slavic are the same thing <br><br>Who was calling who racist again?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this usopp's island?<br><br><br>Sure, just like British and Americans, or Portuguese and Brazilians</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128297818 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128298093 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128300438 <br>Top fucking kek the faggot<br> hates bellamy <br> likes bellamy <br> is the "will rebecca join"-shitposter <br> is the transgender Femanon <br><br>Seriously giving this 12 year old a ip range ban would make the op threads twice as good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You obviously don't know the definition of racist.</br>  <br><br>Racism is discrimination against race.</br></br>    Anyone else love it when Luffy gets really pissed off ?<br><br><br><br>Yea, pretty sure it's Usopp's village.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Idk, you never met bro's you just hit it off with? Friendship at first sight? Instant bromance? Happened to me twice as a grown man, the friend that introduces you always get mad jello too.</br>  <br>Age doesn't really matter on this site</br>  <br>I don't really know why its like this. I know Fujitora is a fucking beast, but for some reason I just don't feel the same way about him as I did with the original 3.</br>  <br> Age doesn't really matter on this site <br>I wrote moot an e-mail just now, you should read the rules.</br></br>    <br>Finally a normal person in this thread. I'm tired of everyone posting girls. Not everyone likes that shit. Can you post some moar btw? Please</br>  <br>It doesn't have to be "discrimination" just prejudice. Not all racism is bad, Asians being better at math for example.</br>  <br>A lot of times I don't remember how I became friends with someone. It's as if we ''just were'', you know ? And I don't think I've had anyone connect with me that quickly and deeply that quickly. Then again, I'm not Luffy/Zoro nor am I in a manga so that's to be expected. I don't know, it's just kinda interesting to think about.</br>  <br><br> age doesn't really matter on this site  <br><br>Global Rule 2.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No, it can be prejudice.<br><br>In which it is still racism - I'm not talking about good or bad here, more 'is' and 'isn't.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Physical age doesn't mean Jack shit. You could be 10 but in reality you have the mind of a 22 year old</br>  <br>As I said read the rules.</br>  <br><br>Doesn't matter what you 'think', it's the rules.</br></br>  <br>Might be because Fujitora kinda showed his ability a little more than the others. All the others were just Monsters and they left the scene. Aokiji almost killed Luffy, rekt Zoro and Sanji. Kizaru wrecked everyone, Akainu was having a whale of a time. Fujitora just kinda did something, laughed and did his own thing.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128304145 <br><br>Don't whine if you get banned then.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128304145 <br>nope</br>  <br>The small arc before Sabaody was amazing.</br>  <br>I hated Sogeking, stupid coward should of just admitted he fagged out over Merry (the whole saying bye to going merry thing, was the worst part of OP for me, and made me really hate Ussop) everything else was eh. I'm just a shallow dude, and his nose fucking bugs me.</br>  Fuuuuck, so much camaraderie  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128304188 <br>So you admit to be underage?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128304188 <br><br> underaged b&amp; <br> better members </br></br></br>  <br>And as I'm saying right now <br>Just Fuck off</br></br>  <br>Fuck off feminazi</br>  <br>I think it's a bit of everything.</br>  <br>read the rules first</br>  <br>That's most likely it. I guess I've not yet seen him do the same crazy shit the others did.</br>  <br>Being a feminazi is better than being a tripfag</br>  <br>Yea, it was kinda refreshing and shit was hilarious.<br><br><br> I'm just a shallow dude <br>Well, at least you said it and not me. To each their own, I suppose.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know it's tru</br>  <br>Not me, when i meet a fellow good looking dude (to help me pick up sluts), that's way to cocky, and has a sick sense of humor like me, we insta best bros.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128304328 <br>Sorry Billy just cause you don't like some thing doesn't mean other people feel the same way</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128304420 <br>and with this you admitted to be underage. Thanks.</br>  <br> tripfag <br>well at least I'm not a homophobe like you</br></br>  <br> Sovereign Haki <br>This is the one thing that kinda irks me about the Coloured ones. T-Steak was like an Admiral something or other in the translation. <br><br><br>That's pretty normal, I suppose. But still, him yelling at Akainu was fucking badass,</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I say " racism is prejudice."<br> No, it can be prejudice. <br>huh? duh, that's exactly what i said. are you not good with reading comp? The "good or "bad" was just extra fyi i threw in there.</br></br></br>  <br> moar <br>Do you have a problem with fucking spelling?</br></br>  <br>Ah, I guess it's a personality thing. I'm not extroverted all that much so I guess it takes time for me to be actual friends with someone. Oh well.</br>  <br>Whoa I'm sorry bruh I guess I'm not allowed to use slang on the interweb</br>  <br>I would usually agree, as anything is better then trip-cunts. but feminist are even more annoying scum.</br>  Zoro's so based  <br>You men are all the same</br>    <br> I'm not extroverted all that much <br>Me neither, but i wanted people to like me, especially bitches, so i learned to fake it. It is incredibly mentally exhausting though..</br></br>  <br>I really miss Sanji's interactions with Zoro. I feel like after the timeskip we've seen way too little of them.</br>  <br>fuck off to tumblr where you belong</br>   monstertrio will never get a panel like this again <br><br><br>Fuck off</br></br></br>  <br>lel, Not true though, while i may be a disgusting evil asshole at least 20% of the dudes i know are upstanding, plain ole nice guys.</br>  <br>You don't say. I wanted people to like me too but I decided it's not worth it. No point in putting up a different mask every time I hang out with my 'friends'. <br><br>Or I was just too lazy.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Calling yourself anonymous is overrated.</br></br>  !!!!!!Post your sexiest heart pirates!!!!!!!  <br><br>The original point was that it wasn't racism.<br><br>I assumed you were the one who was responding to me, hence the 'no it can be prejudice'.</br></br></br></br>   ZOROOO <br><br><br>We got a fair amount in Punk Hazard. Obviously not in Dressrosa but that goes without saying. I'm sure it will come back in Wano when Sanji makes fun of Zoro's swords or some other stuff.<br><br><br> never <br>Yea, no, they definitely will have a panel like that again. Maybe against the real Kuma.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ALL ABOARD THE FUJO TRAIN<br><br>CHUGGA CHUGGA CHUGGA CHUGGA CHOO CHOO</br></br></br>  <br><br>Both of you should be left alone in a room with a pissed up akainu</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128304891 <br>I'm trying over here.</br>  <br>Surely Akainu would do nothing because they're not pirates ?</br>  I love and hate you guys sometimes.  <br>Just stop to copy me and it's all good.</br>  <br>For future use.</br>  <br>Here you go baby<br>btw you single?</br></br>    <br>Best navigator in the world outright.<br>Best musician outright.<br>Ryuuma's descendant.<br>Best cook outright.<br>Highest potential doctor who already knew how to manipulate Zoan devil fruits.<br>Only person in the world who can read pone glyphs.<br>A genius who made himself into a cyborg and was entrusted with the blueprints of Pluton.<br><br> random </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well it's not like he had any of this into consideration when deciding that he wants them to join.</br>  <br> Best navigator in the world outright. <br> Best musician outright. <br> Best cook outright. <br> Highest potential doctor <br>citation needed</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This makes me RAGE.

Also he was controlled by doffy in last chapters cover. Where do we go from here?</br>  <br> putting up a different mask every time I hang out with my 'friends'. <br>I don't make the effort to act sociable every time I'm with my friends, only for first impressions, and when we go out and meet strangers. They don't seem to mind the difference, except when I'm just to tired to pretend to be outgoing, and we're around some hot bitches and they wanna get laid. Then they get a little but hurt I'm not being a good "wing man" but they get over it.</br></br>    <br>I disagree, they are implied to be the best. Sanji was outright the best cook on the baratie, Nami has some kind of ability to predict weather (shown) and the ability to literally control it</br>  <br>Pfft, as if. Oda confirmed that Buggy would just run away like the shit God that he is, if his whole crew got trapped in the Bird Cage.<br><br><br> same coat as Donflamingo <br>I don't think Doffy owns the rights to fur coats, Anon. Doffy might have supplied the alliance with the weapons or something though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I honestly look a lot like law. I have the physique and face. But I don't have the devil fruit lol</br>  <br>I thought Oda just confirmed that he could freely enter and exit.</br>  <br>Huh. Well, as long as it works then I guess there's no problem, right ? Keep being you, whenever you can bruh. Enjoy the bitches, as it were.</br>  <br>O: You're right, he would--.<br><br>Even if you put him in the bird cage with his crewmates, he'd still escape by himself!<br><br>Buggy is no God of mine, I tell you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>couldn't figure out all who was on the floor, thanks</br>  <br>Hehe I'm more of a lucky roo <br>If you know what I mean</br></br>  <br>IMO, the chapters between Thriller Bark and Kuja Island were the best part of one piece. All the revelations and the crew interaction, only to be broken by OP enemies was a very good wrinting by Oda.</br>  <br>Message me</br>  <br> Best navigator in the world outright <br>Not sure about this hyperbole, but just compare her to the Heart Pirates shitty navigator. Luffy definitely lucked out with Nami as his crew's navigator.</br></br>  <br>What ? The guy is a shit cartographer but I don't see how that makes him a shit Navigator. Law's crew survived all this time and they did pretty well, considering they're in a sub.</br>  <br>Of course</br>  Luffy and Zoro sure are like-minded idiots<br>1/2</br>  <br><br><br>don't have to worry about storms or weather too much when you travel underwater</br></br></br>  <br><br>Probably have to have knowledge of currents + subterrain though.</br></br>  <br>2/2</br>  <br>still doesn't seem like it would be as treacherous</br>  <br>Water currents and shit though ? Still doesn't make him a shitty Navigator especially since we haven't seen him do his shit above water.</br>  Am I the sole Tashigifag here?  <br>p-pics or it didn't happen.</br>  <br><br> get sucked monstrous current <br> get crashed into the seafloor/underwater ridge <br> etc. <br><br>It's pretty treacherous - I think FI showed that - you'd have to have a certain level of knowledge not to get rekt.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fattys are scum, kill thyself.</br>  <br><br>Not to mention, depending on how deep you are, you are instantly fucked if you crash or something happens. Above the sea, you can still float around and be rescued.</br></br>  <br><br>I don't know why, but when I see pages of FI, it looks great and fun, but when I read/watched it as it came out, neither was enjoyable. The arc had too little happening for its length, and the antagonists were too little of a threat and did almost nothing before the final conflict. It should have had more SoL days, and after that all the conflict with Hody, also I felt Vander Decken was misused. I guess I'll have to reread it soon, it's been years after all.</br></br>  <br>i hope so. preferably next chapter.</br>  <br><br>Zoro was luffy's first nigga, so they had to bond.<br><br>Then again, Zoro respects Luffy's strength and conviction most of all.<br><br>He would never listen to anyone who was below him, look with all his crew interactions, he tends to reply while pissed off or at least disgruntled.<br> captain autismo <br><br>This is never the case with luffy unless luffy fucks up and hurts zoro with his shenanigans, he also has some nice interaction with Usopp.<br><br>Luffy offers the best opportunities for zoro to become the best swordsman.<br>It's also convenient that his crew is based on very few but highly specialized people.<br><br>They are both interested in becoming their respective best, and they encourage each other all the time to get there, what's not to BRO UP?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SoL ?</br>  <br>Man, I fucking love Luffy and Zoro.</br>  <br>Shanks won't kill him though, just humiliate him and the other silly little kids, then offer them a drink, and to party together. Based Shanks man, i tell ya.</br>  <br>Slice of Life, the usual antics going on in an arc before conflict starts, like going around in Water 7 in Yagara Bulls, meeting the shipwrights, using dials in Skypiea, I felt there was too little of all of that.</br>  <br>I know, it was just a little joke. Shanks is just gonna CoC all the fodder and leave the 4 Supernova's untouched and just stare at them with a little smile. 4 Family men will be born that day.<br><br><br>Ah, right, okay. I wasn't sure that SoL meant but I gotcha.</br></br></br></br>  <br>mmkay, i guess i get it. No, I'm not the original guy you were talking to, i was just trying to correct your definition of racism.</br>  <br>oh, can you believe some nigga actually think kid's groups has a chance of taking on Shanks? Unbelievable people that stupid can even read.</br>  <br>Never say never. Oda can make Kidd's Alliance as strong as he bloody wants. He's shown absolutely nothing of them since the TS and I think it's for a reason. <br><br>Of course, Personally I think they stand no chance cause, you know, it's fucking Shanks.</br></br></br>  <br>Traveling by sub is way more dangerous than by boat in real life.</br>  <br>Because for the 100th time, Akainu does not appoint the admirals, that's Kong.</br>  <br> Never say never <br>NEVER!! I would bet my left nut (if it was worth it) They won't beat Shanks. There's a small chance they might put up a good fight, but i seriously doubt it. <br>Just use your common sense dude, how story wise would Shanks getting done in by some rookie this late in the game, before meeting up with Strawhats, make any sense. God, some people are retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>It's okay bro, most people are just really stupid.</br>  cute  <br>that shits gayer then two bears in leather chaps pounding the living hell out of each other. So gross, and I'm not even homphobic ( do hate tranies though)</br>  <br> &gt; do hate tranies though) <br><br>How rude</br></br></br>  <br> ( do hate tranies though) <br>What do you have against based Bon-chan?</br></br>  <br>And the relation between Kong and the Gorosei? I know they are higher in ranks than him, can appoint shichibukai title but what else can they do that Kong can't? Control the CP1-9? Also why wasn't Kong at marineford during the war? I wonder how strong he is, since he formerly was a fleet admiral</br>  <br>Woah, woah, back up, Kidd's alliance isn't the only thing that has beef against Shanks. Blackbeard and fucking Kaido might still hold a grudge. They both could jump Shanks the same time as Kidd and Co. Because they know fighting Kidd's Alliance is way less risky than fighting Shanks. Shit, not only them, Shanks could have even more enemies, considering he was on Roger's ship and people like Chinjao, who hates generations for one person's acts. It's not just about Kidd and his fucking merry little band.<br><br>Stop being so aggressive. Like I said, I don't think Shanks will ever lose. Take a chill pill. Nothing is going to happen for about 4 years so don't lose your mind over shit like this.</br></br></br>  Why are One Piece threads too shitty now days, even shitposting used to entertain me, now it's all about tripfags, fujos and low quality b8. Kishimoto truly fucked us by drawing that OP jolly roger in the last chapter of Naruto.  <br>You fucking leave Bon-chan alone.</br>  <br>Useless captain = useless crew</br>  <br><br> do hate trannies though <br><br>Do you even One Piece.</br></br></br></br>  <br> forgot pic </br>  <br>I actually believe BB alone could defeat Shanks, but he need for Kid and Co. to open the opportunity for a one on one fight, even Shanks and all of his crew/allies can't match three supernovas + BB pirates + Kuzan.</br>  <br>Useless Trip = useless opinion</br>  I noticed Luffy doesn't have his hat. I looked all over the pages he was in, but didn't see it. I wonder who has it...  <br>Bon Chan is a bro</br>  <br><br>He's wearing it on his back.</br></br>  <br>You're one to speak you dense asshole</br>  <br>I don't think Teach can solo Shanks at all. Sure, he has the Darkness fruit and the Gura Gura but I don't think that will phase Shanks at all. I do think Shanks' crew might have some trouble against Teach's though. Especially with Sheliew and those Level 6 prisoners. And Kuzan, of course.</br>  <br>I don't see it. Honest.<br><br>And before you all attack me, I'm not that spamming faggot. I genuinely think she has it. You'd think Robin or Zoro would grab it.</br></br></br>  <br> implying anyone actually read the trips to confirm anything <br>hownew.ru</br></br>  <br>Absolutely. Favorite Strawhat after Zoro and Usopp, personally.</br>  <br>I don't see it on her either.</br>  <br> No Chopper <br> No Sanji <br>It's shit. Focus on rest of the straw hats when?</br></br></br>  <br>BB stated that at some point he will have the power defeat both Akainu and Shanks, just "not yet" back at Marineford, Shanks is hyped to the max, however BB just keep getting stronger, i'm sure by now he have amazing haki skills, plus tons of other DF powers.</br>  <br>I'm not doing this with you. At the most, they ARE going to talk before the crew leaves the island.</br>  I feel sorry for anons who don't like the whole Strawhat crew  <br>Teach hasn't shown any interests in taking on Shanks after the TS and is still focusing on gathering fruits, which leads me to believe Teach still isn't ready. He'll only go at it if someone else steps up first.</br>  <br>ok ?</br>  <br>Hi Sanji</br>  <br>He's said he wanted a musician pretty much from the start</br>  <br>Yes, but he didnt know Brook was a musician when he invited him, I'm pretty sure the only time that the position in the crew was the reason to join was with Nami.</br>  <br>I like them, but most of the post-timeskip redesigns suck, though.</br>   2015 <br> not modeling your life after him </br>  <br>What about Sanji?</br>  <br>Yeah I didn't like Franky post time skip but I accepted it's his evolution to become a super cool cyborg instead of just a weird looking guy with a metal nose. Every other member didn't really change much besides Brook turning into a rocker and Nami-swan and Robin-chwan getting massive tits.   I'm not complaining I love Nami's underboob </br>  <br>Nice trips, Bilic.</br>  <br>Luffy looks younger than pre-timeskip, Sanji's facial hair is disgusting, Usopp's hat looks silly, Choppa looks retarded.</br>  <br><br>Satan models himself after Borsalino?</br></br>  <br>I don't remember Marineford having artists in their ranks.</br>  <br> Luffy looks younger than pre-timeskip <br>False he even grew a few inches <br> Sanji's facial hair is disgusting <br>Its pretty clean tho <br> Usopp's hat looks silly <br>No it doesn't <br>Choppa looks retarded<br>Only thing I semi agree with</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>W-why are you asking?</br>  <br> Choppa looks retarded. <br>this</br></br>  <br>Please leave landwhale. I'm sure your twinkies, and horde of cats miss you dearly</br>  <br><br>I like your style.</br></br>  <br><br><br>It's just a hat over his hat</br></br></br>  <br>Going on tumblr isn't the problem. It's being a fucking prick about any perceivable mistreatment of women in a fictional story, and going on to shout about it at the top of your lungs that makes the landwhale community so cancerous. Seriously , have you ever considered maybe being a keyboard knight won't get you the acclaim you so desperately want?</br>  <br> False he even grew a few inches <br>Yet his head is bigger and more boylike.</br></br>  <br>he was still cuter when he was ugly-cute.</br>  <br>How the fuck do he wear this shit?</br>  <br>How's Choppa ugly? Even his ripped human form is adorable.</br>  <br>Haki.</br>  <br>Willpower, kid. The World runs on it.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Not One Piece tranies guys (they're neato, real life tranies are pieces of shit. Always hiding the fact that their really men, and then having sex with poor experienced dudes that don't know any better, that's wrong and it's rape.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ugly <br>Nigga what are you doing?</br></br>  <br>3 hours old but<br> /r/coontown </br></br>  <br>Did you get seduced by a tranny? <br>99% of trannies look like trannies and the 1% are so rare they're basically unicorns.</br></br>  <br> Stop being so aggressive <br>that hurt bro.. this bitch I'm trying to dick down just ask me yesterday "why are you always so aggressive?"</br></br>  <br>Saying <br> I am a feminist <br>Says nothing about your views because the term has been raped by feminists to mean whatever is convenient to them in any argument, to the point of contradiction.</br></br></br>  What is the new season even about?<br><br>Why are those girls from season two suddenly in prison but in the next episode, free?<br><br>what the fuck is going on</br></br></br></br>  <br>But you'll be missing out on Chris and Tsubasa transformations and songs.</br>    I think I forgot to take my pills.<br>Or was it because I took pills?<br>Either way I'm not sure what just happened to my brain.<br>Something, something, pills stroganoff.</br></br></br>  Chris is so petite, why are her breasts so dis-proportionally huge?  <br>Shortstack, maybe.</br>  It's finally over. Ending was satisfactory, but the overall show was still shit.   ignored the show since day 1, because fuck "hurr an ep every 2 weeks" <br> now can watch through it in one go </br>  I'm amazed you made it through the end. Congratulations.   Chibi Usa goes off to help Sailor Moon <br> Other senshi mention that they should probably go with her <br> Queen just shakes her head "no" <br><br>Inner senshi get shafted yet again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm amazed myself. I wanted to drop it halfway through the first cour, I stuck with it because I wanted to fully see how the adaptation would turn out. <br><br> "We got close to a perfect adaptation of the manga so what is there to complain about?" <br><br> I fucking hate MAL.</br></br></br></br></br>    Knew when I saw ep 1 it would be a pale shadow of the original. Both openers have exactly the same plot but direction/cinematography of the original is miles ahead.      <br>Now that Crystal has ended, maybe in another 20 years we will get the reboot that Sailor Moon deserves. It can still follow the manga plot but with some elements or allusions to the 1992 anime plus the seramyu and tokusatsu which in itself was following the manga plot but differed later on.</br>      <br> another 20 years <br><br>Everything about that would be fine but I just don't want to wait another 20 years for it.</br></br></br>      <br>Rejoice, at least your children can watch it.<br><br>Oh wait.</br></br></br>        <br>If it did happen, by the time it came out my children would probably be too old to give a shit.</br>      why did this turn out so shit but dragon ball super turned out good?  <br>No idea. Toei dropped the ball on this and Saint Seiya.</br>  <br><br>Because Toei doesn't give a shit about any properties other than Dragon Ball.</br></br>  <br>That's why Tri will fail. I already lost all hope for it when it turned from tv series to movie series.</br>  What arcs did the anime cover, put the show on hold around ep 10 because the directing got very bad and the pacing got shit on hard.  <br>Dark Kingdom and Black Moon. Don't bother watching the rest though.</br>  <br> It's finally over. <br>There is a "See you soon" at the end and a planed announcement though</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Hey, were these characters in the show? Cool.</br></br></br></br>  At least the Black Moon arc was better as a whole. Black Lady is still best girl.  <br>Crystal is an ONA. It has a lower budget. DBS is on tv with a higher budget.</br>  <br>When is this announcement supposed to be?</br>  <br><br>They haven't said. It'll probably be a few weeks or months.</br></br>  I don't get it. The director, producer, and composer had all done great things before (and even together, with Suite Precure.)<br><br>It has to have been some sort of higher-up decision to make the show the way it was. Probably the same people who decided to make Tri into a handful of movies and give DBS a hundred fucking episodes.</br></br>  <br>This man. I liked it, and it made me like Chibiusa more than I did before from watching the old show and reading the manga</br>  Venus and Tuxedo Mask were literally the only likable characters in this mess.  <br>they got shafted the whole time in this show<br><br>not even the 90s show did that as bad as crystal</br></br></br>  <br>Missed out on the announcement of a planned announcement, but yes I was aware of the "see you soon" at the end. When I said "it's finally over" I was referring to the fact that this travesty of a show was over...for now and whether a second season was coming was up in the air based on what I had read earlier. The rumor I read that a second season was in the works was called a mistake at the time. I guess that is not the case now.</br>  <br> ONA <br> Lower budget <br><br>No excuse. There are other ONAs that were produced in the past that look way better than this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i think toei is focusing on DBS so their budget has to shift <br>when they finish that you can bet sailor moon crystal s will come</br></br>  Were there any songs at all other than the OP and ED?<br><br>By this time in the original series, we had insert songs like Ai no Senshi, Eien no Melody, Koibito ni Hanarenai Kedo, etc.</br></br>  <br>Pretty much just run of mill background music and for more dramatic moments they played a children's choir.</br>  My dream would be to see a 90's style Sailor V anime.<br>I think expanding the story would work as well as it did with the 90's anime.</br>  <br>why was the background in crystal so lame and unispirsing <br><br>the original series upbeat 90s jazz and pop sounding music were great <br><br>why couldnt they hire back that composer?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because he's dead</br>  but he is a skull in every other iteration    Finally the show which don't exist ended.  <br>Doubt it. It seemed as if Toei didn't even want this remake. They probably hoped fans would forget about the anime and shat out the cheapest possible series to calm them down at the end. Toei only cares about currently hyped endless series, sadly.</br>  <br>the constant delays should have tipped us off really</br>  <br>Does it even make sense for them to do s2? I guess s1 sold like 50 BDs or something. Or did the ONA have high ratings?</br>  <br>It had more than 2k preorders before the show even came out. They didn't lose money on it, but yeah there really is no reason to make an S2.</br>  <br><br><br>If Toei put more work into it, by the time they got to Stars, people would be asking them to adapt the musicals, Sailor V, or new story arcs.<br>They really goofed on what could have been their greatest cash cow of the decade.<br>I still hope Toei finishes it though. It would be more of a disappointment to end after the Black Moon arc.</br></br></br></br></br>  i only watched the first 13, was the show in its entirety worse than the original sailor moon?  <br>It's supposed to be more like the manga.</br>  <br>Oh God. Oh God what is that. <br>This is a frame from Crystal? Jesus Christ I'm so glad I dropped it early.</br></br>  <br>yeah i know i read the manga but its not necessarily better</br>  <br><br>All Crystal did was show just how flawed the manga really is. The shittenou got an even worse treatment in it.</br></br>  <br>Fuckin' joke's on you, mate</br>    lor<br> All Crystal did was show just how flawed the manga really is. <br><br>Thank you. This, right fucking here. Naoko Takeuchi and her publishers were lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time.</br></br></br>  <br>If Sailor Moon Crystal had been released today without the history of the 90's anime, the manga, and all the nostalgia that goes along with it to back it up, it would have came and went with barely a blip on anyone's radar.</br>  <br><br>I posted both of these, I just had more to add.</br></br>  <br>Ayyy</br>  Which Sailor Senshi takes it in the ass the best?  <br>Toei just wanted the keep the rights to the Sailor Moon anime which was in danger of expiring.</br>  <br>Mars.</br>  <br>Do you really have to ask.</br>  <br> no La Soldier <br> Act 26: shit <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KDy<wbr>59hBJ-Cw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you for making me want to read more Black Dog doujins. <br/></br>  Did  Luna's human form  show up again since that episode?  <br>Not in anime, but in manga during Dream arc (Super S of original anime) all cats show up in their human forms.</br>  They even gave her the wrong brooch.        JUST TOUCH YOUR MOON 3 TIMES WITH YOUR NIPPLE PANTS AND YOU GOT YOURSELF UHH MCMUFFIN  <br> It's finally over. <br>So when will Togashi get off hiatus?</br></br>  http://sailormooncrystalfailures.tu<wbr>mblr.com/</wbr>   you postponed your suicide for this   <br> dragon ball super turned out good </br>  <br> Suite Precure <br> good thing </br></br>    <br>The queen knows the senshi are useless in Crystal.</br>  <br> filename </br>  So if Neo Queen Serenity and King Endymion are the future Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask, why don't they remember what their past selves went through?  <br><br>That rumor has no evidence supporting it. Quit spouting it everywhere.</br></br>  <br><br>Heartcasuals please go.</br></br>  <br>I think it was because the Crystal anime was trying to see if they can do something with it but decided in the end to trash it because it would take a lot of rewriting and they don't have the time and budget for it. Takeuchi always said that there were plotlines she wanted to do but wasn't able to do due to time constraints with the manga. The SeraMyu musicals did play with some of the plotlines I heard. <br><br>Maybe if Toei didn't treat the franchise like a red-headed stepcousin and gave it the SM franchise the treatment it deserved, we wouldn't regret how bland Crystal turned out to be.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He is half right that Toei did want to prevent losing the IP property of the anime because they were still making bank from memorabilia and re-releases of the 1992-96 anime. Takeuchi would probably on the verge of suing them until they threw a little bit of money for the budget to keep her happy and not cut into their funds. They weren't interested in marketing it to anyone other than the 25-35 year old women who grew up on PSSM.</br></br>  Wait, why did they only made classic, R and no S onwards.  Crystal looked so bad honestly. Liked I know it's based more off the manga but I read the damn manga and in my opinion it was drawn very cute and pretty. Usagi was willowy not a bug eyed spaghetti beast. Crystal seriously took whatever life was in Sailor Moon and sucked it out with shit animation , shit pacing , and shit characterization. Compared to the 90's anime I'm aware the manga wasn't as fleshed out but still it had more vitality than this crap. I honestly wouldn't have minded if it looked more like pic related. At least that looks like it could be fun.   No outer senshi <br><br>okay</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0Cu<wbr>A1ov1-Pk</wbr>  [ ]  <br> wanting the outer senshi to be desecrated in Crystal too <br>Thank god they were saved by not appearing in the first two arcs.</br></br>  <br>If you were nearly 1000 years old, you would have a hard time remembering everything you did as a teenager.</br>  <br>True. But I would have liked to see more Haruka and Michiru lesbian shenanigans.</br>  Would you rather have more Crystal episodes or this? <br>https://<span>youtu.be/ODz7ankdTHw  [ ]</br>  <br>neither?</br>  <br>Saban Moon easily.</br>   crystal's animation    900+ years old <br> Goes to train under her 14-year-old-mom <br> Queen mom tells Pluto never to stop time but sends kid back to play with past self on a whim. <br><br>How did this retard family get put in charge?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The time travel in Sailor Moon is fucking weird. NQS and King Endymion seem to act like the stuff with the Black Moon and future villains never happened to them UNTIL it happen in the main time line... (ie. The events of the original series -&gt; time jump of peace -&gt; crystal tokyo with no events of R, S, SuperS or Stars happening) almost like they're from an alternate future and yet events in the past (current manga time) directly affect the future.<br><br>Like with NQS's weapon, she only just gets the Spiral Heart Moon Rod there at the end of Black Moon and yet if her future followed the direct timeline of the entire manga, she should already have her Eternal Tiare from the end of Stars.<br><br>Basically, Naoko made it up as she went along and didn't look that far into the future with properly connecting the past-future.</br></br></br></br></br>  Which senshi has best butt?  <br>I like how there's different music depending on who's singing and they're dancing to their own "theme" at the beginning.</br>    <br> exclusive at hhtp://shitty hentai sitedotcom <br><br>Why is this still a thing?</br></br></br>  <br>This is the kind of thing Crystal could have explained better.<br><br>There are a lot of "mysteries" in the manga.<br>One is what the "Pets" are in Sailor V. I think they're from Mau and other animal planets, but there's no evidence of that. They get 3 chapters and it's never explained where they're from or why they're collecting energy. They're probably connected with Stars somehow, since Naoko wrote the chapters at the same time.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> both parents have blue eyes <br> mother is a blonde <br> father has black hair <br> grandmother has blue hair <br> grandfather and uncle have light brown looking hair <br> come out with pink hair and red eyes </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Queen Serenity and Neo Queen Serenity are different people, and Pluto dying from stopping time is probably the same as Usagi dying if she uses the power of the Silver Crystal too much.</br></br>  <br> not a single lewd leg or ass cheek shot of her unlike the others <br>Prude apologetic shit, that's what Crystal is.</br></br>  <br>considering that they were fucking with us for 2 fucking years before they actually started the damn thing and showed that damn image, yeaaaaaaah i dont see a continuation anytime sooner.<br><br>this was a fuckolossal disaster</br></br></br>  <br>All for a rabbit pun</br>  <br>Usagi </br>    <br><br><br>On those lines, if the originally planned Sailor V anime had been made, the exact same thing would apply.<br><br>The only reason Sailor Moon as such exists is because Toei wanted to create their own sentai maigcal girl show and took the opportunity to ride on the back of the name of Takeuchi's Sailor V when its anime never panned out. While Naoko's manga technically came first, it was never the reason for the genesis of the series proper or the success of the original show, which would have been spawned in an alternate form anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Oh god it would be such a delicious trainwreck if it had come to fruition. I would seriously pay cash to get the pilot to show up somewhere.</br>    <br>You should give the new musicals a go.</br>  Did ShitennouxSenshi happen?  So it's pretty much confirmed that the original &gt; crystal right?  <br>Been that way since like episode 6.</br>    I know the art made it terrible, but it was much more than that. What do you think it was that bad it shit?  I can not get enough of these Babies and manchildren who thought sailor moon crystal is bad. Stop being such a bitter nerd that you have to loudly profess your dislike for something that, by the way, doesn't affect your life at all???? wow whoa???? Keep crying tears about how this series pales to the ~original~, I've taken off my rose-tinted glasses long ago and look ahead towards what the future holds.    <br> It can still follow the manga plot but with some elements or allusions to the 1992 anime plus the seramyu and tokusatsu <br><br>You have no idea how hard my boner is for that idea. I cum buckets just thinking about how awesome something like that actually being made would be. It would BTFO of all other anime pretty much by default.</br></br></br>  So this was supposed to follow the manga but then the show only ends half way through it? What the fuck bullshit! I was waiting to see Chibi Chibi and Sailor Cosmos.   the animation was never this   good <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lXh<wbr>-u9MuEmE</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>So the abomination is finally dead. Rest in peace once more, Sailor Moon. Now to focus our energy on forgetting this ever happened, just like Drunker than Hobo.</br>  I cant' wait for the fixed designs in the BDs. Because they will be fixed, right?  Wait, is Pluto dead and not coming back? I wanted a happy ending.  <br>watching sailor shit.</br>  Second part was much better than the first at least. <br><br><br><br>Well it's very dated and hasn't aged well.</br></br></br></br>    <br> It seemed as if Toei didn't even want this remake <br>Gee I couldn't tell with this WONDERFUL animation quality</br></br>  <br>Honestly, only having to see it raped a couple times a month was better. I bet you drop it after episode 4 trying to marathon it.</br>     Hotaru is waifu since forever <br> just want to see her animated and an animated transformation <br><br>Game transformation doesn't count.<br><br>Was there a reason the old anime didn't animate Hotaru properly? They cut her out of SuperS and other things then just had her back for a moment in Stars.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The staff literally didn't know what was going on during SuperS for a schedule problem so Ikuhara and the team improvised, what mean more sexual innuendo, surreal imaginery, bizarre humor and other shit Ikuhara loves. Stars was mess from the beginning to the end and nobody mattered except for Usagi and the starlights, especially Seiya</br>  So there's really only 26 total episodes in Crystal and covers both the Dark Kingdom and Black Moon arcs? I'm watching the original and there's about 90 episodes between the two arcs. What gives? Is there no character development at all?  <br>It took a few months to make a new manga chapter, so there were a lot of episodes in between. Crystal is one episode per chapter.</br>  <br>They had to make a lot of filler while waiting for the manga to move. That filler is so damn worth it though as you are probably seeing already since it really helps really establish the characters and the anime staff managed to have subplots and such going on.<br><br> Is there no character development at all? <br><br>For anyone not named Usagi, Mamoru, and Chibiusa (with Pluto getting some focus), pretty much. The other 4 girls basically lose all their character after becoming guardians.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> still no Sailor V animu <br> no Super/SuperS/Stars remake <br>disappointment.jpg</br></br></br>  <br>Sailor V needs an anime.</br>  <br><br>There is a Sailor V anime though.</br></br>    Who /dropped/ here.<br><br>I stopped watching as soon as mars hit the building and never looked back.<br><br>I got best senshi and that was good enough for me.</br></br></br></br>  How do I get through Sailor Moon R? I want to enjoy it but it's somehow not nearly as entertaining as the first season.<br><br>Maybe the 9 month break since I last saw an episode will help.</br></br>  <br> I got best senshi <br>She's not showing up for quite a few more episodes.</br></br>   tfw the original sailor moon is still better, even if it looks like shit   K-On on motorcicles.

Actually almost every Yotsuba&amp;! covers are my favorite. But this one takes the cake I guess.      such a mischievous and playful cover, I love it.  <br><br><br>Do you?</br></br></br>      <br>yes, which is why the allusion to the actual painting isn't indicative of Pitou's gender - of which whose gender isn't the point of its character's importance.</br>  Such an amazing cover art.  <br>Based Velazquez</br>  <br>the tankobon art alone certainly isn't indicative of pitou being female, but it sure does add to the case.</br>  <br>only if you're desperate enough to use confirmation bias and moreover if there is even a case to be fought over - Pitou's gender is inconsequential because it's intentionally ambiguous. Togashi operates a certain way for a reason.</br>        <br>Except it's completely logical inference to make given the visual and metaphorical cues Togashi released over the course of things. Ambiguity is just that, ambiguity, not a complete lack of gender. And Pitou was most certainly "gendered", extending a motherly love to Meruem, which is only reinforced my the mother cat and Virgin Mary imagery.</br>  <br>This</br>    <br>This one is my favorite. It just feels so comfy.<br><br><br><br><br>These are some good ones.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Even the tank doesn't have backgrounds!</br></br>    <br>Sometimes togashi nails it, sometimes he doesn't.

Is Pitou's important? No, certainly not, but it is what it is. And it's something. If you're gonna call me a faggot for making a fair deduction based on what the author presented to us, then go ahead, but seeing as you're willing to deny reality this hard then you're probably better suited for tumblr.</br>    <br><br>I love these</br></br>  <br>It's quite obvious what Pitou's sex is, but they have no gender.

But I've always liked this one.  <br>It's too bad the series itself is such a clusterfuck, Tajima'a a great artist.</br>    Not gonna lie, one of the reasons I love Soul Eater is for the cover art.

Is it fair to say that with manga judging the cover is justifiable? I mean art is foundational to the medium, that a nice cover is a good reflection of the content?</br></br></br></br>  Also I don't know what the originals look like but the translated version of the Lone Wolf &amp; Cub covers are almost all great.  <br>Coming up with Kangoku Gakuen leaves you only with one choice.</br>  Simple but good.  <br><br><br><br>So much better than his current style. Current covers are pretty lame in comparison.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yes too true. It had something interesting with the detective thriller elements, but then all the crap about lucy and the multiple personas was becoming discombobulating - I mean there's definitely a way to avoid that somehow, it's just a matter of problem solving. I don't think the author could decide which tone and theme to keep the series on. He wanted it to be too many things and was perhaps a little too precious.<br><br>Holy shit, that's a frickin adorable cover.</br></br></br>  <br>Its sad but Toryiama's newer style, doesnt fit the old series at all... His old rounded was much better</br>  <br>I was always put off at how "hardback novel"-like lone wolf and cub appeared.</br>    <br>I think those were done by Frank Miller.</br>  <br>I kind of like that look for it.</br>  <br>Probably, this one look in particular exactly like his artstyle.

The breasts talked!<br>As expected of breasts!</br>  <br>"Let's leave our friend to die for stupid ideals."</br>  OMANKO OPPAI DESU  Directry to you  <br>Katze pls.</br>  <br>tooo soon<br><br>;_;</br></br></br>  <br>Suck on this!</br>  Do we have confirmed stats on her bust?  <br>Probably atleast D</br>  Rui's a fucking dumbass. I hope Tsubasa will kill that fucking VAPE faggot.  <br>If it was real, large D or small E<br>In anime, B</br></br>  <br>They aren't stupid.</br>  <br>She'll probably beat the shit out of him or something but be stopped at the last second before killing him. <br><br>I predict that he will truly die in some kind of anti-climactic fashion befitting his smug sense of superiority. He thinks he's important, but in the long run he's most likely just a minor villain.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Well Gel absorbed what "people wanted" and everyone was against VAPE and wishing to save Rui.</br></br></br>  "It's not me who will kill you but your ideals."<br><br>Is rytmth mentally challenged? He's the one stabbing the note.</br></br>  The lack of Utsutsu this season is FUCKING TERRIBLE<br><br>Instant worst show of the season</br></br>  <br>He was just trying to be DEEP about it. Stop bullying Rizumin.</br>  <br>I think he sees himself as just the reaction to the actions of the other characters.<br><br>Rui handing over his note led to his potential death, really it could have been anyone stabbing the note. <br><br>It's still fucking retarded though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But he's wrong. Everyone wanted him to get the fuck out in the reaction live, Gel-kun got it.</br>  <br>Are you saying she should be lacking more? well, there's no much to talk about her if it weren't for the obvious unknown information like her real name, her roots and such but no one in gatchaman has a full backstory yet</br>  Gelsadra is going to be the one who kills Rizumu because of Public Opinion.  <br>Yes but how?</br>   Katze nearly gets beaten to death by Katze, who also nearly kills Joe and OD <br> everyone likes him <br><br> Rizumu stabs Rui <br> everyone hates him <br><br>Why?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Popularity vote tornado.</br>  <br>*Rui</br>  I'm fairly certain there is no reason to watch this show except for Hajime's breasts<br><br>And it's sad to think current and future generations will think of this show when they hear "Gatchaman"</br></br>  <br>Katze isn't a delusional faggot. He's fully aware he's a murderous psycho and enjoys it. Rizumu thinks he's some entitled peaceful guy and he's actually no better than Berg Katze.</br>  <br>Because Katze isn't pretending to be morally superior in what he does. <br><br>Rizumu pretends he has some kind of moral high ground to stand on.</br></br></br>  What are the odds this season will end with Rui/JJ giving everybody a note so that they can fight the final boss?<br><br><br>Katze was fun.<br><br><br>Rui handing out his note was the only thing that made sense, not only because Rizumu was threatening to kill people (probably a bluff), but because Rui had just finished saying he trusted everyone (   Loooved this. Such a refreshing character among the genius edge lords   ). It might even have worked if Tsubasa hadn't interfered.<br><br>The only thing I didn't like was how everyone was acting like what Rui was experiencing was just a minor inconvenience (bit like in episode 7, when Sugane and Joe were idly chatting away while you could hear Rui's scream in the background). But maybe they are used to it "Mm, Rui's suffering? Must be a Saturday?)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Are we really stuck with seeing Katze in Gatcha-space or as Hajime's hajimes?<br><br>I want him back.</br></br>  Why couldn't you protect this smile /a/?  It's funny because they are both coming from the same place:<br> look at all the people who died because of CROWDS, you need to stop this now! <br> look at all the people who died because of CROWDS, I can't stop this now! </br></br>  <br>Because he's too full of himself to ask for help.</br>  <br>Congratulations on completely missing the point! It wasn't about pride, it was about ideals. If he really had been full of himself he wouldn't have conceded that he was too attached to the crowds.</br>  Miracles.  <br> The only thing I didn't like was how everyone was acting like what Rui was experiencing was just a minor inconvenience <br><br>Even the tv guy was crying wanting Rui's suffering to stop. The network went wild in hate against Vape. While Rui's a cinnamon roll too pure for this world, the people may not be. That depends what Gelsadra will do next with all the insight she got.</br></br></br>  <br>Because Rymth-kun thinks he's a righteous moralfag when he's a psycho.</br>  <br>It's never about pride. Rui left his pride behind in episode 7 of last season. Way to miss the point of his character. He's the wide-eyed idealism who actually does shit and the example of how humanity should be.</br>  <br>Yes, sorry, by "everyone" I meant the Gatcha team. <br>Though the tv guy feels fake as fuck.</br></br>  <br> Loooved this. Such a refreshing character among the genius edge lords <br><br>That's exactly why I like Rui. He's refreshing. I think that, if Rui survives, maybe JJ will pass the torch on him choosing people for Notes. His role in general seem to be empower people, give resources and help, even if he occasionally fights. He's a big good character that the villains always target for some reason.</br></br></br>  <br>Sugane, Utsutsu and Joe weren't 'calm'. OD respected his stance. Tsubasa wasn't calm at all. <br><br>I fear she'll become Rui's love interest because of rescue romance bullshit and clashing views.</br></br></br>  <br>It really was just Hajime and OD who were like "Oh, what a bummer, that seems kind of a nuisance. Oh well! Let him be!"</br>  <br>Hajime and OD were respecting Rui's wishes because they understood what was he trying to accomplish.</br>  <br> Rui's love interest because of rescue romance bullshit <br>She needs to get in line.<br><br>...Joking aside, I would be pretty bummed if my heroic and painful sacrifice was interrupted before I could make my point.<br><br><br>I guess, it just didn't feel very serious to me. Maybe I'm too used to shonen anime characters overreacting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hajima is one of my most hated characters that ever existed in anime.<br><br>She is absolutely sleazy in a way that under sweet posture lies something fucking horrible that sometimes breaks through.</br></br>    Proper subs when?  <br> She needs to get in line. <br><br>It's also how Tsubasa thought him kind and liked his appearance. She also got angry to see him hurt and decided what heroes are for with him as catalyst.<br><br>It just played as a typical hot shounen hero being mad at his girl getting hurt by the wicked villain.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What I really want to know is whether the orange-haired guy has a Gatchaman transformation of his own. Having only red-colored VAPES is getting really visually boring.</br></br>  <br>She said "you are girlier than me" in my subs. That doesn't really sound very romantic. I get what you are saying, but I don't think it's going to lead to anything that isn't Rui getting very angry or very hurt.<br><br>Yfw Tsubasa incinerates Rizumu and it's super gory and dramatic.<br><br><br>It's possible, but Rui didn't have a gatcha transformation last season. Maybe it's something only JJ can give out.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>stupid tripcode poster<br><br>sage</br></br></br></br>  <br>About 16 hours ago. Oh, you mean the meme subs? Dunno, ask the faggots on Facebook or whatever.</br>  <br> Yfw Tsubasa incinerates Rizumu and it's super gory and dramatic. <br><br>I hope so.<br><br>Rui didn't seem to want to transform very much.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or what if she tries to incinerate Rizumu and hits Rui's note instead?<br><br>But really, I think if anything dramatic was going to happen they would have ended the episode with it.</br></br></br>  Why is Hajime so mean to Katze?  <br><br>This show isn't edgy.</br></br>  <br>I think she'll try to attack Rizumu but Rui will shield him maybe for the max cliché bullshit.<br><br>Rizumu will escape with Rui, so we can complete the damsel in distress troupes.</br></br></br>  <br> a series where's someone's huge breasts can literally talk <br>As expected of breasts!</br></br>  <br>Eh, no, but it does tend to subvert genre stereotypes: the plucky new recruit usually does mess up, but it is of no consequence.<br><br>Last season the new recruit was actually in the right from the start, this season the new recruit has anger management issues and a fireworks powered suit she has never used before.</br></br></br>  <br>I doubt Rui will be seriously hurt. But Tsubasa will fuck up, the kidnapping scenario sounds more legit to me. Because Rizumu would try to keep the Crowds away and I don't think he'll actually kill Rui.</br>  <br>I don't think he will have time considering Tsubasa will fully attack and possibly make a few red crowds go into a coma<br><br>If Rizumu takes Rui, he will die since is the note that needs to be healed not him and only Usutsu can do that</br></br></br>  I know Rizumo kidnapping Rui is like your ultimate landwhale wet dream but it will not happen  <br>My ultimate landwhale wet dream is Rui being raped by Katze.</br>  <br> If Rizumu takes Rui, he will die since is the note that needs to be healed not him and only Usutsu can do that <br><br>He's a medical student, I bet he also has a bullshit healing power.</br></br></br>  <br>How are they so big<br><br>she's like, big dumb blonde bimbo slut big</br></br></br>  <br>Actually, scrap that: jj prophecy suggests that Tsubasa will save the "flame of life", so it sounds like she won't fuck up?</br>  <br>Or she'll fuck up and later be useful.</br>  <br>Fuck you tsubasafag<br>His/her ideals are not stupid.</br></br>  <br>You try containing a fucking insane alien psychopath in your tits and then we'll talk.</br>  <br>The problem is that it's Rui's ideals vs Tsubasa's ideals and they're supposed to be on the same side.</br>  <br>Or the flame of life is something else</br>  <br>That's the point, people have different opinions.<br><br>Hajime, OD, Rui and maybe Paiman are of one opinion.<br>Tsubasa, Sugane, Utsutsu and Joe of another.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Its suffering, I know</br></br>  <br>there are doujins anon, relax.</br>  Let's play a game of spot the Rui  <br>Katze just wanted to shitpost. Rizumin is just being a faggot who's attempting to take the moral highground.</br>   muh foreshadowing <br>also muh symbolism if you consider the pink+blue background? I wouldn't think much if it if it weren't for the fact that the torso of his suit is also split in 2 colors.</br>  <br>are you   Kinda sad [/Spoiler] </br>  <br>He will continue to look like a retard until they give us some context on his actions.<br>and I hope that happens soon, because in these three episodes everything we got was exposed pretty messily</br></br>  <br><br>A little  upset , ye</br></br>  What was this about?  <br>My guess is that he's starting to feel out of place in a friends of justice team</br>  <br>He feels out of place.</br>  I expected a bit more in terms of wacky visuals.<br>if the series had experimental animation or heavy graphics like the opening it would have been fantastic. maybe with a bit more budget they could had Gekidan Inucurry involved...</br>  Second.  <br>Whoops, meant to post.</br>  <br>The theme seems to be different opinion/views and how they can cause pain and separation, at least from Gel's LET'S UNITE EVERYONE. This obviously includes the same Gatchaman team which is divided.</br>  <br><br>Didn't he believe super heroes were completely irrelevant at one point?<br><br>Why did he join Gatchas soon after and be surprised no one was in line with his way of thinking?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because in the end his goal was to help people as well, even if a bit differently than defending the status quo like the flaming bureaucrat gayman</br>  <br><br>His way of thinking didn't change that much though considering everyone still has access to crowds and can change the future for the better on their own. I think that it's more that he realised there are certain things only Gatchaman can do.</br></br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/-2ACPrLbe0k?t=58s  [ ]</br>  Sure glad I'm not watching this after the shower of shit that was Crowds.   here's my soul mr. sociopathic self-proclaimed "violent pacifist" <br> let's be besties now, k? <br> also please don't stab it that would be really ba-aghhhh <br><br>Got exactly what he deserved. But I'm sure Rui will still preach his bullshit ideals like some shonen protag even after this. Everyone except Joe and Tsubasa have been infected by Hajime's brain damage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, there was no way he could've won this situation.</br>  <br>I´m not saying there is an alien in my boobs, but there is an alien in my boobs.</br>  Why are the tags for this show on pixiv so dead? This show is ripe for fanart and there's not near enough.  <br>He's a vampire. They can't enter someone's home without being invited in.</br>  PUFF PUFF  <br>If he didn't, Carrot said he would start killing people. Though there are no precedents for this so far so it could very well be a bluff. Now, Rui merely gave up his note, deliberately putting his self preservation in jeopardy just to prove a point. Even if Rizumu never backs down (staying true to what he preaches) and leaves him bleeding to death, Rui would have died staying true his ideals which are currently putting so many people in danger, at least he wouldn't die an hyprocrite.<br><br>If he doesn't re-evaluates shit after such a ridiculous close call, i don't know.</br></br></br>  <br>But according to his ideals that everyone can change, Rizumu wouldn't have killed him. It wasn't about hypocrisy, he genuinely thought that he was solving the red crowds problem by changing their leader's mind</br>  I want to hug katze.  <br>Me too, both of them.</br>  <br><br>Ah, of course, that makes sense. Shit, as soon as they get creative with the cinematography I start to think there is something deeper going on.<br><br>Anyway, I'm glad they are addressing that. I don't really think he is Gatchaman material. I'm betting that by the end of the season he is going to end up as a JJ figure.</br></br></br></br>    <br> Didn't he believe super heroes were completely irrelevant at one point? <br><br>He does, but he believes people must evolve FULLY first. He sees the update happening little by little and accepts it to be slow.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, if Rui didn't surrender his note and people started dying i don't think he would have been able to live with himself.</br>   thinking Rui is wrong <br><br>Dude, this was broadcast: rizumu is now a criminal not just some thought vandalism and everyone saw him and he just won the popularity contest because people are hating on vape now.<br><br>Not his intention, but he's getting muh trap reaction from the masses.</br></br></br></br>  <br>To add, pic related?<br><br><br>Well, yes. That too.</br></br></br></br>  <br> he isn't wrong because the other guy is more wrong </br>  <br>G</br>  It's not like Rui went into battle set on giving his note away, in fact, when Rizumu asked him the first time he flat out refused. It's only when Rizumu threatened to kill people and guilt tripped him that he agreed to meet him. Their main point of contention is whether all humans can be trusted with great power. Rui believes they can, so of course he gave him his note. <br>Seriously, what else should he have done? <br><br>Shit, he is a medical student: to the general population that means he wants to help people, not stab them.</br></br></br>    <br>Well yes, an odd choice of career, considering.</br>  <br>They are.</br>  This anime speaks to me.  <br>you forgot the funnel.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128309315 <br> Being able to hide your powerlevel in public makes you a "normie" <br>When did you fucking idiots start flooding into /a/?</br></br>  <br>Seems /r9k/ love this show.</br>  Probably would've been recieved better if she wasnt absolutly perfect at everything and we saw some flaw in public from her.  <br>I want them to leave.</br>  You are out driving and this little motherfucker is in your way.<br><br>wat do?</br></br>  <br> Tyuule plots to antagonize Empire so Japan will get finally get their ass off the couch and hit them hard, as her goal is to bring end to the Empire. <br><br>But she gets very close with Furuta, the Chef.
