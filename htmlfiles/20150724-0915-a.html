Too bad it hasn't been leaked yet.  <br>Can't wait for it.<br><br>Also hoping this time for that flashback on how Fujikido met Yukano and Gendoso.</br></br></br>  <br>3rd ED a best.</br>  <br>Same here. Speaking of which, the next episode has been shown at an event on the 19th, though of course, no one is allowed to talk about it. The official hints are pretty vague, as lots of episodes can be described by them, but nonetheless, here they are:<br> Could it be, that...? <br> Kawaii, hooray! <br> Merciless! </br></br></br></br>  Dat hair waving around  <br>4 is my favorite https://vimeo.com/127257730</br>  <br>I really hope it will be the flashback. That, or Fujikido going around thinking about his past before he became Ninja Slayer.</br>  <br>Ninja Slayer confirmed for best ED of the year then?</br>  <br>If you have this many ED's, then you have quite the high chance.<br><br>Only question which one is THE BESTEST.</br></br></br>  <br>Koki a cute.</br>  Bumping it.  2nd ED is best, full version especially. Some of the recent ones have been cool too though, that hip hop one was dope.  In the end, it's Sushi-Night at the Barricade. We are introduced to the resistance ninjas, and a certain enigmatic beauty makes her debut.<br><br>Oh, and there's a Ling Tosite Sigure ED.</br></br>  <br>Did you buy the full second ED, or was there a leak that I didn't notice?</br>  <br>A ninja of fine taste</br>  <br>It's a part of their tour set, so there are live versions.</br>  <br>Sexy Zone rip when?</br>  <br>FAIR ENOUGH.</br>   WASHOI    Episode 15 is already out on Viewster <br> It's still not out on Funi </br>    http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>15096</wbr>  <br>YEEART</br>  <br>Viewster releases episodes 2 hours before Funi</br>  <br>YEEART!<br>By the way, where is today's episode?</br></br>  <br> http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=<wbr>715096</wbr> <br>Huh?</br></br>  DŌMO, HAJIMEMASHITE, /a/-SAN. I am  falf of  FANSUB Slayer.<br><br>If the episode is really out on Viewster, then someone should rip it quickly so I can type the subs!</br></br>  <br>Funi and Viewster usually simulcasts this series at the sane time. It's just HS set their ripper for this 2 hours late for some reason and it seems Funi is having trouble with their site at the moment so their simulcasts today are delayed according to their Twitter.</br>  <br>Already out on nyaa</br>  <br>DŌMO, ARIGATŌ, Anon-SAN.

The path of REVENGE is a harsh one.</br></br>  <br>It's a cyberpunk dystopia, after all, but with ninjas. Kinda interesting if it's an RPG setting.</br>  <br>Shadowrun can do this the same way...albeit by adding fantasy elements to it.</br>     that spine <br>Such ninja flexibility!<br><br><br>Not to my knowledge, but I can't wait for Shinobigami to be translated into English so I can have some Ninja Slayer sessions.</br></br></br></br>  <a href="http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1437669905918.webm" target="_blank">http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1437669905918<wbr>.webm</wbr></a><br><br>Same band who did Tokyo ghouls OP?</br></br>    <br>Same guy, he started a solo project.</br>  <br>But were they at least able to fuck?</br>  <br>There are people in the world that are ridiculously flexible due to years of training.</br>  <br>Either the band or the solo project of the guy, I'm too lazy to check right now.</br>  Are her memories permanently gone now?  <br> they will never be translated <br>Why.</br></br>  This whole episode was bittersweet at the end, but not as saddening as episode 14.  <br>Didn't they announce an official translation a while ago? Also, there is Translator=SAN and his works.</br>  You failed to protect her smile, Ninja Slayer-san  <br>Probably.</br>  <br>Ninja Slayer could've removed the explosives from Rapture's body, but the guy simply jumped before he could remove them.</br>  <br><br>I was wondering why didn't do that as well.</br></br>  <br>Because Rapture was too fast. That's why Ninja Slayer couldn't remove them in time.<br><br>Didn't you see how Ninja Slayer removed the fuses when he fought Explosive? <br><br>Dude removed them lightning fast.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>YEEART!</br>  <br> ability to show tits and ass at the same time <br>Such a marvelous jitsu.</br></br>    <br>Nice</br>  <br>Yes.

The one in love with Rapture is Amnesia, Yukano is still fair game for Fujikido bowl.</br>  <br>No.<br><br>Trust me. My ninja soul allows me to see through time.</br></br></br>  <br>Keep in mind that Fujikido is a mid-thirtyish salary man.<br>Yukano is in her lower 20s at most.

Now give me Fear and loathing.  <br>How long yukano has been missing anyway?</br>  <br> No nano.ripe <br> No GRANRODEO </br></br>  <br><br>Why are you guys so pessimistic about this? We still got about 11 EDs left.<br><br><br>It's difficult to track time in Ninja Slayer, since the episodes are published and animated in pretty much random order.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> nano.ripe </br>  <br><br>Yeha I bit janky on the time lapses here. It has to have been a couple of months at the very least</br></br>  <br>Both of those bands are still around and not broken up like the others posted, and while I like nano.RIPE they don't fit the show. Granrodeo would be good though</br>  <br>When did she loses her memores?</br>   NTR shit <br>FUCKING DROPPED</br>  <br><br>When her granpa died and her house got nuked</br></br>  <br>Her house got nuked before that.</br>  <br>The first 3 don't exist anymore.</br>  <br>Ninja Slayer ain't got time for love after his wife died.<br>He's married to  revenge  now.</br></br>  <br>When dark ninja kill her grandpa, i guess. Is she going to remember her past or this memory lost is permanent?</br>   Dat ponytail   <br>Welp, makes sense.

I don't know I only read the manga.</br>  It's pretty funny that scythe of her's is blunt as a piece of styrofoam . <br><br><br>Lala has a neck? Lala''s been shown naked?</br></br></br>  <br>Ah,looks better here.Colourpage Lala looks off.</br>  If Zombina is my favorite monmusu, does that mean my taste is  rotten ?  <br>Sasuga fojoshi.</br>  I like the manga, but I get the feeling the mangaka has no idea what he wants to do with Lala.  <br>Nice to see she will be making her appearance in the anime.</br>  <br>Rejoice.</br>  <br>Wait, does this mean that Lerche will somehow rush the final episodes?. Because so far this has been the superior monster girl anime adaptation and while I'm happy to see her I don't want them to fuck it up like what they are doing with Jitsu wa.</br>  <br>All of my dreams have come true, is this how it feels? True happiness?.</br>  <br>Canon in-universe explanation for why Darling doesn't die despite going through more than what a single man can withstand.</br>  <br>Considering my fetish is blue skinned dark elves and I'm sure a monster oriented manga like this will never use elves, my dick is rejoicing.</br>  <br> non-separated neck <br><br>the fuck? How does that work?</br></br></br>  <br>There was a theory that Darling has monster blood for whatever reason, considering his vitality, regeneration and strength ( The punch to the tug and director ) it could be true</br>  I'm picking the mango up. Found a torrent with volume 01-07. How up to date is this?  <br><br>I'm disturbed by the lack of dismembered neck on best girl, too.<br><br><br>It's just Lala. Nobody else but her and darling know that dullahans actually are what they claim to be instead of just chuunis with detachable heads<br><br><br>01-07 is 01-30, translated atleast up to 34</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Magic </br>  <br> 01-07 is 01-30, translated atleast up to 34 <br>Cool. Thanks Anon.</br></br>  <br>She's basically a fairy anon, logic has no meaning to them.</br>  <br> dullahan with an eye of balor <br> knight of hades </br></br>  <br>Read the manga you dip.</br>  Lala still needs a bit more character development though.  <br>Can't wait for it.</br>  This thread should be more active considering the news regarding best girl.  <br>Lala is the best.</br>  <br>That's not Lala.<br><br>OG Dullahan is best girl though.</br></br></br>  <br> afterworld Lala has no ahoge <br>So, it's two different Lala after all?</br></br>  <br>I know, i call her Proto-Lala.</br>  <br>Holy shit, Maybe Lala has some sort of dual personality where the ahoge-less one is the one with all the power in the afterworld and the real-life one is the chuuni version.</br>  <br><br>Her head comes off, it doesnt mean she has no neck</br></br>  <br><br>Proto Lala a cute.</br></br>  <br>What if the ahoge-less one is the body in the real-life, and she switch personality with the head of the ahoge one in afterworld?</br>  <br>I was going to say the exact same thing, but the problem is that the body's personality seems a whole lot more, open? if you understand what im saying.</br>  Reminder    Reminder: There isn't a better girl than Suu  Is this the monstergirl thread?<br><br>I'll just leave this here, then!</br></br>    <br>IT'S FINALLY HERE</br>  <br>Yes, excellent.</br>  <br>This. She doesn't seem to have a personality beyond the fact that her head falls off. Even Mero has a personality.</br>          so what's going to be Dullahan's subspecies for endcard? what about Zombie? I don't think I've seen cyclop subspecies too, and neither Doppel's.<br><br>Are we witnessing enlightenment soon?</br></br>          <br>Oh god, yes!</br>     Ai Kakuma as Lala <br><br>Holy fuck, that's Sento's VA from Amagi Brilliant Park.<br><br>The deadpan is going to be fucking glorious.</br></br></br></br>      <br>Suddenly my interest for Lala drastically went up</br>  Also, I'm doing a quick summary of the new MM chapter, and will post it as soon as this is done dumping!  <br>Lacking development isn't the same as not having a personality. Lala has a personality based around the fact she's a chuuni, which simply wasn't developed yet.<br><br>Also, Mero has been around longer and just now we're going to see some development for her character.</br></br></br>   pigeon sisters <br><br>Bird cafe will be the death of me.</br></br>     horse pussy this <br> horse pussy that <br><br>Wow who the fuck cares.<br>I'd fuck Cerea's horse pussy with the passion and intensity of a thousand stallions. I don't even give a shit. Then I would cuddle her so hard and tell her so many "I love you"s and "You're so cute"s that she'd turn into a blushing puddle of sugar.<br><br>Shame on you faggots that would not love all of your monster girl wife.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cool.<br><br> Onee-san bird a qt </br></br></br>       liking Cerea for her horse pussy and not her good personality and loyalty <br>I'll never understand you people.</br>    <br>I like her for different reasons.</br>    <br>Not just standard deadpan, it's going to be chuuni deadpan</br>    <br>It's like screaming furry to Poltfags, it's hype and it let's summers fit in, just ignore and carry on with your waifu</br>  <br>Can stands have names from albums as well? If then, I like Educated Horses better.</br>   Not liking Suu   <br>I think the best example we have is Amagi's first episode when Sento is listing off how amazing each ride is with absolutely no enthusiasm. Shit had me dying.</br>    <br>Oh gosh, baby Suzu is too adorable.</br>  <br> inb4 kicks them out </br>      <br>called it<br/></br>        <br> She uses her Ruuko voice <br>I don't know if i'd be crying or laughing</br></br>    I'm loving these MM shorts.<br><br>I want to see what Spider does when she thinks she is alone.</br></br>  <br>Someone post the detachable spiderpart.</br>  <br>Practicing bondage or tailoring.</br>  Daily reminder that best girl is Cereal  <br>She does  cute   girly  things when no one is around.</br>  <br> corn flakes <br> not based Peanut Butter Crunch <br><br>This fucking guy.</br></br></br></br>  “Mero’s a real princess?!”<br>“That’s right! Her goth-loli loving personality is just to hide her TRUE self!”</br>  <br>Thanks TF! <br><br> she will never be real </br></br></br>  “She is the heir to the mermaid throne, Meroune Lorelei du Neptune!”<br><br>Cerea apologizes for her insolence and ignorance.</br></br>  <br>OH AM I HYPED.</br>  “Should we call you Mero-sama?”<br>“No no, the mermaid kingdom is but one small kingdom of many!”<br><br>“YOU’RE LEAVING, MERO?!”<br>“DON’T LEAVE! PAPI’S FINALLY FRIENDS WITH YOU!”<br>“Papi, she is ROYALTY! You musn’t act like this!”<br>“NOOOO”</br></br></br></br></br></br>    I want to see her  smile   <br> dat super embarrassed Mero <br>Hnnngh.</br></br>  The fish butlers look like bros.  <br>I really hope that mermen aren't all reversed mermaids like these guys. That would suck so much ass for the women.</br>  Suu doesn’t want her to leave either.<br><br>Rachnee: “Don’t cry, girls! She’s just going home to see her family, and will be right back! And look at Mero!”</br></br>  <br>Producer pls</br>  My parents, tearing me away from the one I love…<br>YES! YES! THIS IS TRAGEDY!</br>  Mero suggests they all go together and stay at her kingdom’s high-class hotel.  <br>Rachnee is best onee-san.</br>  <br><br> Cerea having an honorleptic fit <br> Mero bathing in tragic tears <br>And all was right in the world.</br></br></br></br>  Darling complains that he didn’t get much time to check out the new additions to the house.  Wait are they gonna skip the MON squad chapter because Lala's introduction is a bit far in the manga.    Darling asks why Mero’s been asked home all of a sudden.<br><br>“A DANGEROUS INDIVIDUAL IS TARGETING THE PRINCESS!”<br>“THE SCYLLA, OCT!”<br>((Forgive my butchering of the species name.))<br>“SHE’S A VILLAIN WHO’S TRICKED AND DECEIVED MANY MERMAIDS!”</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's gonna be a fucking apartment complex when they come back.</br>  <br>Isn't it about Chapter 24ish? 12 episodes, 2 chapters per episode should put her right at the end.</br>  <br>Oh shit so that girl in the pic is the scylla it seems.</br>    <br>YES</br>  <br> Scylla girl </br>  <br> Scylla <br>Oh God</br></br>  <br> scylla <br>Ahhh jeez</br></br>  <br> scylla <br><br>THIS IS IT<br><br>MY DING DONG IS READY</br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Doing gods work, thank you very much!</br>  “Oh, I forgot to tell you, this hotel is for aquatic species, so the interior is filled with water.”<br>“LITTLE LATE FOR THAT AERAOUDIJFAER”</br>  <br>Anyone else thinks Rachnee's care for Suu and Papi is really cute?</br>  <br> water soluble slime girl <br> surrounded by lots of water <br>this isn't going to end well, is it?</br></br></br>  <br>MURDERFISH STRIKES AGAIN</br>    <br>Now that you mention it she does kind of resemble a soccer mom</br>  <br><br><br><br>SCYLLA HAS JOINED THE BAT...I MEAN HAREM<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=p92<wbr>Y11peXu0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>today is a good day</br>  <br> blue skinned dark elves <br>Sylvanas / Dark Ranger hero from wc3?</br></br>  <br> bubuzuke <br><br>Fuck him.</br></br></br>  <br>It's one of the things that make her best girl.</br>  <br>What's wrong anon?</br>  <br>that art does her thighs no justice</br>  <br> He made the art for some elf rape based VN and I'll never forgive that. </br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=uIC<wbr>0TIwVpBY</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I always said there would be a Scylla/Cecaelia when Mero went home, and this was way before the onsen chapter.</br>  <br>does it need to be elves</br>  <br>Why'd you stop tf?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  AND WITH THIS WE ARE DOWN TO 2.<br><br>Assuming Polt is his way of getting out of doing a Catgirl/werewolf</br></br>  <br>I'm working on the last half of the pages, sorry!

She was initially so standoffish because she was afraid of getting rejected. Not just by Darling, but by everyone. Now that she's accepted that she's part of the family (so to speak), she seems much less reluctant to be herself.</br>  “WE ARE TERRIBLY SORRY FOR THAT! PLEASE, THIS WAY!”<br>Rachnee: “No, no, it’s fine, it was kinda fun.”<br><br>It’s a VIP hotel for aquatic species, but they also have a separate hotel for air-breathers to stay the night.<br><br>“STAY THE NIGHT?!”<br>“We didn’t bring anything…”<br><br>“Also, I’m short on cash…”<br>“YOU’RE SUCH A HELP TO THE PRINCESS, YOU NEED NOT PAY!”</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>for you</br>  “Why don’t we go to the beach?”<br>“WE HAVE SWIMSUITS FOR EXTRASPECIES PEOPLE!”<br>Papi’s super hype about the beach.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I just googled and picked a random image.

She'll be living here from now on! </br></br>  Miia’s enjoying the Eel-subtype mermaid’s lotion massage.  <br> Cerea <br><br>Damn.</br></br></br>  The fact that they end the season with lala means that they're planning on a second season.<br><br>Assuming good sales and such of course.<br><br>Are you going to do your part, anon?</br></br></br></br>  “How do you like our massage? It should be very satisfying for Lamia.”<br>“IT’S…AWESOME…”<br><br>Centorea decides to have a massage, too, to show Miia that she can handle it without melting under their touch.</br></br></br>  <br> Cerea fit her tits into something </br>  <br> Legs <br>Does this mean mermen have legs?</br></br>  …yep.<br><br>“Hee hee…nobody can escape the Eel’s magic touch.”</br></br>  The Eels get the girls to join their member’s club for benefits and goods.<br><br>Suu’s sad because she can’t play in the water.</br></br>  I wanna massage Cerea too<br><br>;_;</br></br>  But the mermaids bring her a swimsuit she can wear.<br>“It’s completely waterproof!”</br>  <br> Papi in a bikini <br>The world has become a significantly better place.</br></br>  <br>Are they seriously going to introduce another housemate at this point?

The bath portion of episode 3 wasn't in the preview at the end of episode 2 and it still happened.</br>  <br>i want to be the heat in Yukkio's life and make her feel not so lonely</br>  <br>But without the egg chapter, they won't be able to insert Rachne into the story</br>  <br>I fear anime only content may make its way here.</br>  <br>I'm guessing this will be her gag from now on. She won't show up at all in the manga till after darling almost dies, then she'll just be there in the panel hanging out next to him and one of the other girls will be surprised she's there.</br>   tfw they put the shedding and egg laying scenes in   <br>Maybe she really is there, she just has so little presence that Crabman forgets to draw her.</br>  <br>In what, Anon?<br><br>IN WHAT?!?<br><br>TELL ME ANON</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't he end up making the egg chapter less graphic than he intended based on the possibility of getting an anime adaptation?</br>  <br>she's a freaking horse you have to level the playing field somehow.</br>  <br><br>I love how the manga covers aren't even subtle.<br><br>"Hey you! Yeah you! You like fucking monster girls? You like monster girls laying eggs? Fuck you if you don't!"</br></br></br></br>  <br>In the anime you dip, learn to extrapolate.</br>  <br> FAR too lewd for tv <br>It airs at like 12:30 am over there.</br></br>  <br><br>Nah. We'll still get the chapter. I'm imagining some sort of visual sight gag in lieu of actually showing it.<br><br>Kinda like the silhouette of a ball popping out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, the series started out has one page porn comics</br>  <br>This is not how i imagined her<br> hair only on the paws and low legs <br>and that's all.</br></br></br>  <br>ive been into egg laying ever since I read that one Shugo Chara copypasta<br>you know the one</br></br>  <br><br>I'm glad he kinda re-did the design. The whole body suit thing was just dumb and awkward looking.</br></br>  <br>It says on her design art that fur covers her whole body </br>  I've noticed there hasn't been any release of Polts anime design or mention of a VA yet. We've seen all the other girls.  <br>shes not going to be in it, <br>it seems they are trying to steamroll through the series so get through as much of the harem as possible, which is why I suspect the sheeding chapter was left out.</br></br>  <br>no<br>stop saying things like that</br></br>  <br>Would you be willing to have a theoretical OVA?</br>  <br> multiple tits <br> and 2 breasts </br></br>  <br>I think 16-panel comics would be more accurate.</br>  Check the guide before posting:<br><br>Http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  <br>ordered my first soft breast figure is it going to have an obvious change from soft to plastic and will i be able to tell when it changes from looking at it?

The part that connects with soft breasts can be made hard, but it's probably cheaper to make the rest of the body from regular plastic. If you want to see examples look at Alleyne's knees (as if they couldn't not skimp on half of her fucking legs, jesus christ) and Katsuragi's collar (hidden by the tie, dunno if there are any pictures of that part on the internet).</br>  <br><br>I REALLY WANT TO COMMIT A CRIME</br></br>  <br><br>I sure hope they're cast-off (at least their bras).

You've probably been spoiled on most of the twists due to being on /a/, but it still can be fun. It's bloated as hell, but with good characters and an interesting setting.</br></br>  <br>Shit taste.<br><br>Rin's pretty ugly. Her design is a joke.</br></br></br>  <br>Rin is a sweetheart.</br>  <br>What makes you say that?</br>  <br><br><br>Twintails are generic ZR look with terrible colors are awful past 12 years old.

Where's the Grand Order Nasu?  <br>  females are shit, yes. <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br>  It is a complicated thing. It is subjectively entertaining but objectively overrated.  <br>Ive watched the '06 anime and UBW. 06 and the second half of UBW were shit. First half of UBW is alright.<br><br>Worth watching for Tohsaka.</br></br></br>  <br>No, Shirou's character is a masterpiece. In fact, If Shirou's character wasn't in a battle series with chuuni magical elements in a niche Japanese medium he'd be marveled as a literary masterpiece, a modern Hamlet that defines modern protagonists. First he'd need to be moved into a story without magic, and instead his backstory was that he was a survivor of a terrorist bombing 10 years and was then saved by the terrorist who planned the whole event. Then you could replace all the magical backstory with political elements and set the story in the Middle East, replace the Holy Grail War with a regular war, etc. If you had a more "serious" story that people didn't judge on the fact it had porn scenes and was from Japan, people would be regarding Shirou as one of the most interesting protagonists of modern literature. This is a fact that none of us can escape from even if we insult Fate as a chuuni eroge.</br>  <br>/a/ makes Fate out to be bad? Last I checked the more shitposting a series gets, the better it usually is. That's how I usually go about taking recommendations from /a/ and I haven't been steered wrong since.</br>  <br>Rin is not dumb.</br>  <br>I've only read the VN so I can't really recommend the anime versions , but I really enjoyed it. Yeah It took like 4 days in game to complete the three routes and it's just like any other typical shonen, but that's just how it is.</br>  <br> Whore of Babylon figure among best King figures </br>  <br>If there was an accepted canon of anime that any fan was expected to be familiar with, Fate would be in there so you might as well watch/read it. At the very least for shitposting purposes.</br>  Does Shirou ever stop being so bland in UBW? I'm vaguely aware of his characterization being appreciated on /a/ but jesus fuck he does not have a drop of charisma so far.  <br>How far are you? He gets better towards the end of 2014UBW but in general his characterization and development was handled much better in the VN.</br>  <br>His character is supposed to be hollow for the most part, but through the series, as he fights for his ideal and gets closer to Rin, he does emote more.<br><br><br>Nasu actually said the anime got his characterization closer to how he originally wanted him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou only really gets to God-tier MC status in HF. UBW is pretty much default Shirou.<br><br>The anime is also less focused on his characterization, which is a real shame, because everything outside Shirou's head is ultimately irrelevant.</br></br></br>  <br> Shirou <br> bland </br></br>  <br> Shirou only really gets to God-tier MC status in HF. UBW is pretty much default Shirou. <br><br>Cool opinion, man. Default Shirou is Fate Shirou. UBW Shirou is a Shirou whose characterization is actually examined.<br><br>The anime handled his character fine too. They just didn't narrate every word in his head.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Director Miura ruined his characterization, unfortunately.</br>  <br> God-tier MC status in HF <br> Throws away ideology for undeserving wormslut <br>It's an odd feeling where Archer couldn't do what Sakura unintentionally did.</br></br></br>  <br>Only 7 episodes, it's just my first impression and it's a little jarring after f/z. <br><br>If I like him more by the end I think I might read the vn.</br></br></br>  <br>His ideal was shit.<br><br>SHIIIIIIT</br></br></br>  <br>If for some reason you're still on a 4 hour old thread, think of it this way: This is the book/game/source to the movie. Would you rather just watch the Postal movie or play the games?</br>  <br>It's not a mistake.</br>  <br> Shirou only really gets to God-tier MC status in HF. <br>Nah that's him going from a non-generic MC to a full blown generic MC. <br><br>You suffer from shit taste, so just kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  Yes   I see. And what about Shirou, the main character? <br> Nasu: With anime, I think power balance that is shown objectively is ideal. This is just the image that the creator has in his head, but the ideal Shirou as a character study is a guy who doesn't crack one smile through the whole show. But in contrast, to get the players to enjoy themselves during the long game, I had to have him pull off comedy bits as well. </br>  <br>Looking pretty cool there shirou</br>  <br> Not wanting to be a hero of justice <br>I bet you selected "I want to protect Sakura" pheb.</br></br>  <br>It's one of those things where I'm pretty sure I just liked it because it was long and I got invested in the characters. In retrospect, it looks way, way worse. Like Muv-Luv.</br>  <br>If you liked it the first time through, what's the problem?</br>  <br>And then you get to see him start to smile as he interacts with Rin. I'm pretty sure this is the first time that he smiles in the show, and you see how it shocks her.</br>  <br>You can enjoy something in the moment without it being good.</br>  <br>What's wrong with enjoying things that aren't necessarily good?<br><br>Not that I'm claiming Muv-Luv or Fate aren't good, I do not agree with you at all there.</br></br></br>  <br>There's a cool little visual arc here that I like. You see him smile here as Rin tries to console him over Ilya's death, which connects to the Archer smile at the end, but it's also a good bit of character development for him too.</br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with it, but if someone asks me if it's good afterwards, I'm going to say "no."</br>  <br>The show took out 99% of his inner thoughts, which when considering the entire story is meant to be seen through the eyes of this guy is a pretty big loss.</br>  <br>You see him smile when Rin comes running after his fight with Rin, and it's by far the biggest smile he's had yet. I like to think it's cause he got his answer there.</br>  <br> her ears turning red when she blushes <br>Why do people hate this studio again? Because they're popular or something?</br></br>  OP here<br><br>Can I read one route and decide what to do from there or do I have to do all of them?</br></br>  <br>Each route is 33% of the story.<br><br>You can not be said to have read it if you have only read one route.</br></br></br>  <br>This is something you'd only catch on the broadcast version, but I think it's nice. The end title card thing for the last card is just Shirou smiling. It's a cool little end to things that kind of tells you, "hey, he's gonna end up alright".</br>  <br>1. -Fate-<br>2.

Logical consistency. Themes. Complexity. Lack of half a dozen cooking scenes.<br><br>Good is enjoyable, but enjoyable is not good. You can enjoy reading total garbage.<br><br>Not that Fate/Stay Night was garbage, I just don't think it's good because of all the dumb stuff in it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's cool to be contrarian.</br>  Since people were talking about Shirou as a character, I got to thinking about something F/HA, which I've started reading a few days ago. During the scene with  Caren when they finally get a chance to talk behind the Ryuudou Temple but then have to fight that pillar of black things, it made me think that Avenger and Shirou might be connected somehow. He can't be both the red man and this black guy, right?  I don't mind a confirmation since I've already seen what he looks like outside of being black blob.  <br> Shirou is the black man </br>  <br>It will be interesting seeing how that plays out. I wonder just how many Shirous there are?</br>  <br>why is arc so cute<br><br>best tm girl</br></br></br>  <br> Unlimited Arcueid Works </br>  <br><br>most of the people who I hear complain about the plot are the ones that missed most of what was going on on their first playthrough or have forgotten it so I'm relatively sceptical of anyone who claims that there's some problem with it,<br><br>still it's not like I rated the series particularly highly it just bugs me when people complain about writing when it's clearly more thought out than what we usually get from fantasy or science fiction series<br><br>in fact that seems to be the problem, it explains everything so much detail so that when information gets omitted it feels like a glaring plothole whereas frequently the information is something the protagonists just couldn't know about under the circumstances <br><br>I really can't think of anything to call stupid in this series other than King Arthur is a girl and Zelretch has a really plot convenient dagger, everything else gets introduced and explained and rooted in the setting</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that by explaining things so much is what lowers the quality of the writing. Infodumps should not be necessary, but it is understandable when having to set up the world that Nasu did. The rule "show, not tell" is something that can be difficult to take to heart, but once it is properly ingrained into one's storymaking and writing, then it vastly improves a writer's work.<br><br>Also, some people might point out that World's #1 Grandpa Zouken sort of just shows up for little reason in HF, and that his existence is literally a plothole. I didn't especially mind it, but I am curious why he didn't do anything in the other routes.</br></br></br>  <br>Not that guy, but you say stuff about the whole "show, don't tell" thing, but then you've got folks who get super pissed that the anime didn't stop to explain every little detail of what was going on with the characters and the situation. It's kind of a catch 22.</br>  <br>Because Heaven's Feel Shirou was slightly nicer to Sakura than the other two.</br>  <br>I haven't watched the anime yet, but from what an anon said in this thread, as well as some other threads talking about other VN or LN adaptations, what seems to be problem is that the protagonist's thoughts aren't heard. The VN makes it very clear what Shirou is thinking at times, but I also wouldn't say that the anime not showing that is necessarily bad. If that's all someone watches of the Fate/ Stay Night product, then yes, they would be missing out.</br>  <br> I haven't watched the anime yet <br>Why?</br></br>  <br>I'm not , but I don't have a lot to say. It's a very straightforward fantasy story with tons of exposition, plot contrivances, and goofball stuff. It ping-pongs between battle shit with quantified power levels ripped out of last night's PnP game, slice-of-life with King Arthur, and a threesome in the forest to power people up with semen.<br><br>It's fun, but that doesn't make it good.</br></br></br>  <br>The anime doesn't really miss anything, though. It just doesn't treat the audience as mindless. If you actually watch and listen, you'll get it.<br><br>They set out a goal to try and tell the story visually. Literally aiming to "show, not tell".<br><br> When the art is good, you don't need to spell it out </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because I was finishing Tsukihime and reading through KT, and now I'm reading F/HA. I'll check it out after taking a break.</br>  <br>"show don't tell" is a nice platitude to throw around if you hate long form fiction but can't tell what's wrong with it<br><br>some of the stuff literally can't be shown as it involves metaphysics that you're either familiar with from religious studies or have never heard of before thus leaving you lagging behind the plot<br><br>other times the explanation is important to the events that happen immediately after as well as much later still other times the information isn't explained and is implied in exactly the way "show don't tell" would have it happen but is consequently missed by the audience, in most cases it's not like it's being subtle either "hey kotomine couldn't love his own child here he is defending a giant baby made of evil, geddit GEDDIT? " is about as low key as it gets</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>i love this pic<br><br>when the tsukihime remake happens we must have another season of carnival phantasm</br></br></br>  <br>Not at all. I find the entire series to be very fun to watch. But Don't take my word for it, Zero and Stay Night are free on Hulu</br>  Always keep this in mind:<br>On the internet and /a/ specifically everything is either amazing or its complete dog shit there is almost never an in between.<br>Give it a watch for yourself and make your own judgment by forming an opinion through seeing it for yourself and not because /a/ told you too.</br></br>  <br>Rin is the only one with a bad design. Saber looks good and Sakura is okay.<br><br>Okay, I lied Caster and Medusa in their Servant gears also look stupid. But Medusa in her civilian clothes is beautiful.</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing wrong with ZR but Rin looks like a tryhard DA design tier of 'how to roll fetishes' in a character for a fanfic than a natural ZR.</br>  <br>You have a bad design.</br>  <br>  Is it really worth the investment? <br><br>If you like reading and care about Fate. <br>I really don't get you people, if you force yourselves to read something how do you expect to like it? All you'll do is hate it and shipost later.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Red man is not human<br><br>Because Saber is main girl, simple as that</br></br></br>  <br>it's about the opportunity cost<br><br>if i'm going to read ONE VN is it worth skipping 5-6 anime from my backlog?</br></br></br>  <br>So is Arc, who is even worse than Saber.</br>  <br>Why not just watch those anime later? They aren't going anywhere.</br>  <br> Arc, who is even worse than Saber <br><br>kek, back to BL with you</br></br></br>  <br>It's an entire thing people don't seem to get that its very easy for her to be heartless at times, which is why she relies on or needs a morality puppet to stop her from going too far that way, because she doesn't want to really go that way either.<br><br>She tries to put duty above everything and put on the face of a magus, a cold killing magus at times.<br><br>Sometimes when she's taken it too far she might end up either breaking or regretting it forever, but she has no doubts and the reader should have no doubts that she won't hesitate to go that way. Its even noted in one of the bios, along with how she doesn't like that part of herself.<br><br>There's kind of an entire route that explores this side of her character, as Shirou plays her morality pet to stop her from going too far, and secretly she's thankful that he does it and that he believes in her that she won't do it in the end.<br><br>Its an odd contradiction with her character; that she's possibly the softest one in some ways, the most normal one, yet there is still this coldness.<br><br>Its similar to Ciel.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The thing you have to understand is that, particularly in UBW, Shirou does change her. Archer outright notes she starts to act soft because of him.<br><br>She was taught to be the perfect magus; strong will, ruthless, and willing to do anything to live up to her family name, but seeing Shirou, a complete contradiction in what she thinks a magi should be, starts to make her second guess herself. You see early on where she absolutely balks at the way Kerry taught Shirou, but as she gets to know him, understand his morals and the way he lives, she finds that maybe there is more than one way to be a mage. She has that big moment in the Einzbern basement where she says the world needs people like Shirou.<br><br>Scenes like the one the guy posted only happen if you fail to play the VN as Shirou would naturally react. Shirou of course would forgive Lancer, but if you the player don't, the image Rin has built up of Shirou starts to go away, and she reverts to how she thinks she should play things out as a mage.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Have you read it? It's worse. <br><br>/a/ goes really easy on this shit, but it's awful.</br></br></br></br>  HA voice patch when?  <br>Not really, you just have shit taste. Rin's design is old as fuck.</br>  Gilgamesh is chaotic good  <br>he is chaotic neutral imo<br><br>doesn't really give a shit about anything as long as he gets to enjoy fine things</br></br></br>  <br>He's chaotic good<br><br>Anything you would repeat without end cannot change the facts in stone.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope</br>  The only good thing to come out of Fate is the NTR hentai  <br>FSN is the worst in the series. It has some good concepts and fun parts, but there are also the hilariously written R18 scenes. <br><br>I just don't get Rinfags, if she was male or if they actually met such a person they'd think she's an annoying bitch, but people seem to look past her character.</br></br></br>  <br>What exactly is annoying about her? I think she's probably the most down to earth of the bunch.</br>  <br>what makes him chaotic good?<br><br>it's kind of hard to be on the good half when the world belongs to you anyways<br><br>but what actions did he take in f/z or f/sn that led him to become good? this alignment seems totally meaningless and forced</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yet here you are pissing away time on 4chan.</br>  <br>Watch Fate/Zero and read the Tsukihime manga instead of this.</br>  <br> what makes him chaotic good? <br><br>He's good, but in a chaotic way; or as Nasu puts it..<br><br> His nature is Chaotic Good. <br> A cold-blooded tyrant, and a hero who had sought and enjoyed all manners of treasures and pleasures. <br> Though capricious and temperamental, he does not (generally) kill someone simply because he is in a foul temper. <br> When he kills a person, it is either because that someone’s soul is abominable, or because that person has become an enemy of his. <br><br> King and sentencer who weighs both good and evil equally. <br> To him, a life is only “that which will die this moment” or “that which will one day die.” <br> A being who is recognized by Gilgamesh as “a life that must die this moment” will be slain, even if a sage. <br><br> “So in the end it has nothing to do with rules or conditions and just depends on what he feels like that day?!” <br> This kind of reaction is understandable, but that is what a king is. <br> Whether astute judgment synonymous to the truth of the universe, <br> or misrule during a drunken stupor, <br> if he is the one to implement it, it would become the indisputable adjudication of the king. <br> Such is the absolute sovereign. <br><br> Though some see him as similar to Iskandar in their egocentricity, the greatest difference between the two is that Gilgamesh has no need of vassals. <br> Gilgamesh is a king who, from start to end, reigns by means of only “himself.” What he loves are “treasures” and “tools,” while a “person” is no more than that which must one day perish. <br> ……No matter how worthy of love he may acknowledge that to be. <br><br> Considering CCC’s themes, women’s issues can’t be avoided. Gil’s type is a “noble maiden.” (Ko-Gil’s is a “wildflower.”) <br> He dislikes women who are dependent on men and yet would make use of men. In other words, he dislikes “womanlike” women </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i think nasu just doesn't understand what chaotic good means<br><br>what you posted encapsulates a chatoic neutral character perfectly</br></br></br>  <br>Well to me it's her being so loud,but that's just my own opinion.</br>  <br>He's whimsical, he wants the best for humans, his methods to reach this can be chaotic but it has been proven its not for evils sake that he does this but rather he actually is legit in his ways even if they are warped, he's not trying to end all life, he's trying to create humans that are strong enough to withstand what's the come and reach towards the stars. He's been shown to be like a parent, but an Asian parent.<br><br>He's a dad in a home, gets word a meteor is going to hit his house, family ain't hearing shit or they're lazy, think he's crazy, he's also quite stupid since the method he comes up with to get them to get a move on already is to set the house on fire, admits that some of the family will likely die in the fire in the process but the ones that survive will become Batman. Shirou breaks into the house and puts out the fire saying "No one will die, nothing will happen, no meteors, people will live", and then kills the dad himself in some strange contradiction. Then a few years later the meteor hits just as scheduled, and aliens called TYPES kill everyone.<br><br>Gilgamesh is right, but his methods are sometimes stupid<br><br>He can see the end of humanity, its part of why he grew warped as an adult along with his solitude of no one being able to understand his path except Enkidu. He has the same Clairvoyance has Merlin, except he sometimes gets involved.<br><br>He's a guy that would indulge in all sins and deem them as acceptable, he's by no means entirely correct, but everything from F/SN, Zero, CCC, to Strange has shown he really does mean well in there and he's not just doing it for the sake of evil, he does do it for humanity. There's a reason he's considered a hero on occasion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean I guess it all comes down to opinion, but I like her cause it feels like you could actually have a decent conversation with her, you know? Sakura's a little too polite and doting, while Saber is just kind of polite.<br><br>Plus I mean she only really gets annoyed at understandable situations. If you fucking saw a guy literally get killed, and then a couple hours later run head first into a fight between Heracles and King Arthur, you'd probably think he was crazy too.</br></br></br>  <br> Well to me it's her being so loud <br>Then you don't know loud at all. Damn if you consider her loud then most people might annoy you now that I think about it.</br></br>  <br>Yes, but he's not evil nor is he crazy, which chaotic neutral would signify. His alignment lies towards "good": he is basically on the side of preserving or saving humanity naturally. If you just look at him in F/SN, then one would not see an accurate representation of him due to the Grail's taint. If he sees a human worth respecting, then his own "good" part is brought out. Keep in mind that the definitions of "good" and "evil" can change somewhat between persons. One person might say that killing is an absolute evil, while another would say not killing is the same. I don't mean to argue that there are no absolute "good" and "evil", but that one society's laws are not always the same as others. Saying that Gilgamesh is anything other than "Good" is due to looking at him biased on your society's laws without taking into regard his society's. Then again, he IS the law.</br>  <br><br>I don't know what you mean, but Saber and Sakura had times they put Shirou in his place or argued him down. They just don't tease or argue all the time. Maybe it's just your taste to have more vitriolic conversation.<br><br>Sakura seems like she is slow in a conversation, but it's more often because she thinks before she speaks. Something someone who has been tortured often would learn quickly is attentiveness and tact. But that also makes her insightful to avoid conversational mistakes by reading people. She teases Shirou often enough, she doesn't need to make it into a skit or routine.<br><br>And as a king, being diplomatic is customary, so Saber not immediately hounding people in conversation is normal. She is stubborn in other ways, and calls Shirou out several times.<br><br>Rin being more boisterous than the other two is something likely attributed to her living with less shackles than they did. She was always treated well throughout childhood, and regarded as a beauty without flaw and little scrutiny. So she behaves like someone who has lived that way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She was always treated well throughout childhood <br>Not really. Are you even the same anon who finds Rin annoying?</br></br>  <br>Maybe, maybe not. It could end up taking more than a hundred hours if your concentration isn't great while reading.</br>  <br>Red man is a supernatural monster scumbag, so it would.</br>  <br> She was always treated well throughout childhood <br><br>Her dad was murdered, her mom was turned into a vegetable, and she was essentially raised alone with the exception of visits from her dad's murderer.<br><br>Like, okay, it's not worm rape, but that's not exactly an amazing childhood.<br><br>And really, Rin just sees past Shirou's bullshit. She's the one who really notices there's something wrong with him, and she tries her best to help him. She's the one who takes him on the date and tries to make him happy. She teases him, but Shirou learns to tease right back. It's a nice dynamic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> does dumb shit all the time <br> not dumb <br>K, pal.</br></br></br>  <br>Just because he has brown skin and white hair doesn't mean he is a monster.</br>  <br><br>Nope I am not, I rather like her.<br><br>I just provided commentary.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Arturia gave a shit about her wife getting dicked by Lancelot <br>Too busy doing kingly things to deal with literal pleb lyfe. Only thing that made her remotely sexual was that one time she was given dick to do dirty work, and when she was summoned to be Shirou's waifu.</br></br>  <br>no</br>  <br> Nope I am not <br>Which is why I asked your typing pattern is recognizable.</br></br>  <br>  makes all the important decisions with his dick <br>  rushes to get himself killed and only gets saved every single bloody time by plot armour <br>  idiotic philosophy no matter the route <br>  generally stupid to the point he ought to visit a doctor about it and get a caretaker <br>Nasu is a fucking hack, m8.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's a genius.</br>  <br>Genius of fuck ups maybe.</br>  <br>Brown people need to go back to where they came from.</br>  <br>Saber is the worst servant ever she is lancer tier</br>  <br>In Christianity, I think that is what is described as 'Heaven', anon.</br>  <br>Rin is the smartest heroine.</br>  <br>Can you point out her fuck ups?</br>  <br>Well she might be smarter than her slut of a sister, but Shirou would still outwit her.</br>  <br>She figured out how to beat Gil before Shirou. Shirou only figured it out thanks to Archer telling him and him having a feeling.</br>  <br>Nah, she didn't.</br>  <br>Shirou figured it out first, this was shown in Fate route with him only having seen his NPs once to realize his identity. UBW shouldn't be any different really, upon seeing those NPs he realized that this could only be one guy.<br><br>First two routes someone usually speaks up first, as we get the slightest clue in the narrative that somethings up with him but usually people dismiss it.<br><br>We see a few examples of this guy of thing, but usually in the narrative we see him basically figure it out first.<br><br>By the third route they really aren't hiding much, so he directly calls out what Caster's NP can do upon seeing it for the first time since we already know how his ability works by now. One look at the dagger and he's already analyzed it, so he automatically knows.<br><br>In Fate route Shirou realizes who Gil is first almost off the bat, but people don't realize the oddity about this because Gilgamesh proudly claims his own identity before one can say it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Those events have nothing to do with how she was treated, I am aware she had burdens. But what I argued was that she wasn't this amazingly flawless self-made girl in comparison to the other heroines that some tote her as. She is a down to earth person with her own issues. <br><br>She had help from family members about Aoi and Tokiomi, and after that event, led an actually cheerful life with many friends. She goes on frequent shopping trips and outings with Makidera and Ayako.<br><br>Also, Kirei, while being a snake, ironically raised her well, and she will admit, was good as a master. He gave her the proper tutelage and instruction, medicines to dull the pain of the crest, and lessons to defend herself. It would piss her off more in fact to look over her life the fact that such a snake raised her properly and with care.<br><br>I am just of the mind that dismissing the positive aspects of other heroines in favor of pointing out another's strengths is generally bad, because it fosters misconceptions of the characters.<br><br>Rin is a balance yes, but that is again because she was raised with less shackles, and more options. But it isn't like Saber and Sakura don't help Shirou's distortion in their own ways. Saber with a personal understanding of that martyr type of mentality, and Sakura's often blunt and straightforward affection help him to start valuing himself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but then you've got folks who get super pissed that the anime didn't stop to explain every little detail of what was going on with the characters and the situation. <br>It feels bad admitting this, but I am one of those people. I just feel like in the VN all the characters a deeper because we get a greater, more fleshed out grasp of what each of the characters are like in their heads. What the intensity of the fight feels like when you've been cut and are bleeding all over yourself while worrying about the one you love over there, you know things like that. I MISS that in the anime. It just isn't there.<br><br>I get the idea behind show don't tell', I really do. And the anime does things that a VN can never do, like really bring a character to life through more detailed interactions, expressions, and things like that. Also the fights are wonderfully vivid and attention grabbing. Its just a pure difference in the medium. <br><br>The VN is better at some things, while the anime is better at others. To get to the point of 'nirvana' in F/SN, where you can benefit from the having the knowledge and depth of each character from their VN portions, and watching their VN actions brought to life in the anime, you simply have to watch/read both. <br><br><br>I'm literally reading that part in the VN, right now anon. He says he 'would have had better luck' while Rin tells him straight up, 'yo this is how we beat this nigga'.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She did, she put together the clues of why Gil didn't like Archer and Shirou.<br><br>I am talking about the clues that she pieces together that Shirou misses.</br></br></br>  <br>Where did you get this from? is there more of this?</br>  <br><br>Rin's just pulling nonsense out of her arse there.</br></br>  <br>All Rin did was go "He's a goldy" and somehow put together the pieces based on a nickname she created at the time, because she was jealous of his riches.<br><br>Shirou put it together because he could read all of his NPs, and realized they were all real, more than real they made all other NPs look like dirt.</br></br></br>  <br>It's from the UBW box set. I personally don't own it, but I've got some pages of interviews.<br><br>Here is the second part of the Miura interview.</br></br></br>  <br>Nasu interview part 1.</br>  <br>No she isn't.<br><br>I wasn't even talking about that scene I am talking about the scene where they discuss how to beat him before they fuck.</br></br></br>  <br> before they fuck <br>Stop reading the outdated version.</br></br>  Ah fuck, I'm really dumb. I messed up the page order.<br><br>Nasu interview.<br><br><br><br>Miura interview.<br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I read both, and?</br>  <br>Not that guy, but that shit's in the censored version too.</br>  <br> and after that event, led an actually cheerful life with many friends <br><br>Didn't she actually lose most of her friends because of the magical girl stunt that happened when she was a kid?</br></br></br>  <br> Saber with a personal understanding of that martyr type of mentality, and Sakura's often blunt and straightforward affection help him to start valuing himself. <br>Doesn't Shirou give Saber a lesson in the end and I don't remember Sakura helping him much with that.</br></br>  <br><br>She exaggerated, she was embarassed Ruby possessed her and made her an idol singer and it shocked people. <br><br>She and Issei had a combative relationship in middle school, which is why they are like they are in high school.<br><br>Plus it was kind of obvious Rin kept her distance from people, not the other way around, given she has admirers of both sexes in high school. Basically the unapproachable school idol cliche. They lampshade it a lot in Hollow.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Literally reading this now, for the first time, as I read your post. Please let me share my first time with you, anons.</br></br>  <br>Oh, you are going to have fun.</br>  <br>You're actually supposed to see dolphins here. Anything else is not canon.</br>  <br>Fusing couple dimensions together (HA)<br>Deciding to piss-off of her sister that a) had access to basically infinite amount of magical energy b) was already nearing psychological breakdown and probably would had given up if Rin hadn't had decided to piss her off (HF)<br>Wasting a command spell to enforce overly broad order (Prologue)<br><br>As far as I'm concerned those are her worst fuck ups.<br><br><br>I hope that ain't a uTorrent logo that I'm seeing on your taskbar.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dolphins? Care to explain what happens in the "canon" version?</br>  <br> fate/stay night walkthrough <br>Just what do you think you're doing?</br></br>  <br> Fusing couple dimensions together (HA) <br><br>That didn't happen, dude. That was the excuse made up to bring some logic to Avenger's dream, but she didn't do that.</br></br></br>  This writing is getting me hot and bothered.  <br> not using 4chanX. </br>  <br>Dolphins transfer some of Rin's shit over to Shirou, so there's no need to have sex.</br>  <br>That sounds really hilarious. Is this in the anime as well?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9fS<wbr>hyCWTfKw</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>To be honest it's actually kind of a nice scene.</br></br></br>  <br>They are both canon.<br><br>Yeah it's in the anime.</br></br></br>   tfw you realise there's a vanilla patch available <br>I'd been indecisive about trying the VN because I don't want to play  non homo  eroge, this is good.</br>  <br> They are both canon. <br>No they aren't. The old stuff stopped being canon ages ago.</br></br>  <br>Citation needed. It was released recently too.</br>  <br><br>Sakura is family, and she has several parts in HF where she shows Shirou honest, no bullshit affection and chastises him about not taking care of himself. But also that she appreciates him as he is, and wants to protect the clumsy boy she saw that day under the setting sun. They already act like two close people who have lived together awhile either way.<br><br>Part of the way to treat Shirou's is getting him to value himself, and you do that with honest understanding and love. Didn't you see how the future Rin from the Zelretch treasure box scene in Hollow lectured the current Rin about just that?<br><br>Saber learned from him as well, your point? Through seeing and talking with her, he better understood himself.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Censored or uncensored, they fucked eventually.  Rin doesn't shave her pubes? Wtf is this. Everyone should shave their pubes.  <br>Ah shit, should have bleeped the nips, right?</br>    <br>Every version since has skipped the old junk. Nasu clearly has put all that behind him and into the dustbin of history.</br>  <br>appchan x is better.</br>  Quality life advice from Shirou.  <br>Check you privilege, cuting'o'phobe!</br>  Where were you when Rin creampied Luvia while Ilya watched?  <br>The PC 18+ release has actually had several re-releases. Hollow Ataraxia too.</br>  <br>Why is this scene so fucking sexy?</br>  <br>Well earlier that anon mentioned that Rin was the only one to worry about that which is true. Saber route was focused on her and same with Sakura, he learned from both routes but only Rin took an initiative. Not sure about Sakura, the story gave me the impression that she didn't know how broken he was or it just didn't cross her head since she is warped too but she knew about his ideal.</br>  <br>Those 2 should fuck already.</br>  <br>It looked shaved to me, James.</br>  <br>They do in HF normal.</br>  I guess it was Ilya's birthday a couple days ago, or something?  <br>Because you like the idea of Shirou fucking your waifu and cucking your in the process.</br>  <br>Saber's not my wiafu. She's the female character I like the most. Just s Shirou is my most favorite male character.</br>  <br>Am I the only one who thought Saber looked older in this sex scene?</br>  10/10 line.<br><br><br>Its a plothole man, text says he goes past the pubes, image is a Nair'd pubic area. Come on now, wheres my consistency?</br></br></br>  <br> actually liking shirou </br>  <br>Haven't you noticed than in Eroge they always mention pubes but you don't see them? I think it implies that they are very tiny.</br>  <br>You can call it a 50+ hour anime, but since your goal is to find out whether the fate route sucks or not, you can just finish it in less than 12 hours or so if you read through it at a fast pace. I would say go for it, but you would only waste your time if you saw UBW, unless you want Saber's backstory in more detail and the H scenes for her, along with the altered route.</br>  <br>DEEN really tried to make Shirou look like shit, didn't they?<br><br>I mean it doesn't help they picked the Fate route in the first place.</br></br></br>  <br>Fate route being first makes sense. My only problem was that they made Shirou into a retard and they added things from the other routes.</br>  <br>It's similar, but I'm near 100% sure that the narration refers to Sakura and Ciel's hair as black at least once in Fate and Tsukihime. <br> If anyone could back me up on that, it'd be nice. </br></br>  Man, that bath scene with Rider in F/HA was really nice. However, I don't understand why he was so sensitive afterwards. Does anyone know?  <br>Shirou was always a retard.</br>  <br>He gets a lot better in UBW and HF.</br>  <br>Don't insult my Fate route.<br><br> Honestly though, its damn shame Archer gets all of a few dozen screens, Cu doesn't get to be his awesome self, Shirou doesn't get as badass as he does in UBW although what he does get is through legitimate hard work. <br><br>I just wish all characters had a chance to do things in all routes, though I understand why that just isn't feasible in this VN.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well he was more retarded and they made some serious scenes into a comedy with him being a bigger denser retard.</br>  <br>How is he a retard in Fate? Not starting a fight here, just looking for reasoning.</br>  <br>Does it have all the Tiger Dojo and special ending if I just read HF?</br>  <br>It main relates back to the issues with his relationship with Saber. Nasu is outright aware of the problem, and one of the core things Miura set out to do with the UBW anime was to change people's opinions of Shirou due to that initial first impression.<br><br>Miura: The content of Fate/Stay Night should be assembled to follow the vector introduced by Fate/Zero, we are following that logic. If we succeed things should become interesting.<br>There is one more thing, from the time I received the post of director I decided one thing.<br>That is to draw precisely the character who is Emiya Shirou.<br>Shirou who is incomplete as a magician and doesn't possess any worthwile talent in the first stage of the story, adding to that Saber who is tied to an incomplete summoning, who doesn't receive enough mana and who can't fight at full strength.<br>Despite this while claiming to Saber "Women shouldn't fights", he still throw himself in the frontine.<br>Drawing him like this could make him a very annoying character with one wrong move.<br>But playing the original game I realized he wasn't just an idiot who wanted to become a hero, but someone who's heart is warped somewhere.<br>Why did he become this way, by understanding and despiting this I'm sure he could become a very attractive protagonist.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there really any reason to play through besides the H scenes</br>  <br>There's a Tiger Dojo for every bad end in the game, so you'll only get a third or playing through HF. And the Last Episode is an epilogue for Fate, which has no bearing and makes no sense with HF's story.</br>  <br>What? /a/ sucks Fate's dick. <br><br>Overrated as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br> And the Last Episode is an epilogue for Fate, which has no bearing and makes no sense with HF's story. <br>So I have to reread Fate to get it?</br></br>  <br>Rin is the only good thing in Fate route.</br>  <br> even nasu himself knows that he's a hack </br>  <br>You need to get all 40 Tiger Dojos and the 5 endings, across all routes.</br>  <br>Nope. She does seem more "mature."<br><br>Here's why I think this:<br>1) This scene is a hypothetical scene after the Fate route in which Saber decided to stay apparently.<br>2) Some time had passed from the end of the 5HGW<br>3) Saber fully accepted her womanhood and sexuality<br>4) Saber loves Shirou and gives her all to him in that regard<br>5) The whole scene is orchestrated by Saber for maximum pleasure</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fate is the name for Saber's route. If you're the OP asking, or someone new to the VN, just read all of the routes. It's a novel before being a dating sim or eroge.</br>  <br>It is interesting to note some of the subtle things the anime did to make Shirou look appealing.<br><br>For instance, did anyone else notice that the anime made absolutely no reference to the fact that Shirou limited Saber in terms of power, or in the fact that Shirou was causing her problems due to not being able to regenerate mana for her? That whole thing was completely off the table in the UBW anime.</br></br></br>  <br>H scenes are only icing man. The story is gold. But if you don't like story-driven shit, character development, things like that, then you're better off with something else.<br><br><br>I don't think that he was a retard though, thats just him coming off as annoying to readers who don't like to read stuff about men telling women they can't do X. And wasn't his warped-ness explained in Fate? I don't think it was something that was necessarily 'out of left field' so to speak.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The H scenes aren't a reason to play it. They're all pretty goofy, cringeworthy and lack voice acting.</br>  <br>There's this jarring disconnect where Shirou can't put his trust in a superhuman servant who is far stronger and more capable than him in the Fate route, but then come time for Unlimited Blade Works, and then suddenly Shirou has no problem trusting Rin and thinking she can handle herself.<br><br>It all comes back to the fact that Nasu had trouble writing a relationship between Saber and Shirou.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Not OP, I have read Fate and UBW before but then my laptop shit on me and I have to get a new one, somehow I got the realta nua which has 3 route separated so my question is can I just read HF and got the last ending too?</br></br>  <br>The major difference is that in Fate, when Saber fights Berserker, Shirou sees her get brutalized and driven into a corner.</br>  <br> thats just him coming off as annoying to readers who don't like to read stuff about men telling women they can't do X <br>Nah, he's being an absolute blockhead telling his servant not to fight and inanely trying to do it himself when it's completely obvious that he can't handle the task.</br></br>  <br>No. You need to get everything again, unfortunately.</br>  <br>I get that, but the fact that she's going up against these types of guys in the first place shows she's a little above regular dudes.<br><br>Also doesn't the same shit happen in HF, and it doesn't really play out the same? With UBW, the Berserker fight was different, but it was 100% copy and pasted in the third route from the first.</br></br></br>  <br>I guess the first time I read it I saw it as Shirou basically trying to pull an Atlas, with Saber and his issues being 'the world' and him just chugging along trying to keep it all up. This route seems like him doing what he can as long as he can, before realizing its ok to look at the person next to him and say 'Ok, yeah, there's no harm in you lending a shoulder'. <br><br>Also this <br>he has constant flashbacks to how much he hated that moment and goes full smile protect mode, which I actually enjoyed. Especially with the dynamic if Saber being way better than him in essentially every combat aspect.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just keep skipping to next choice, it doesn't take terribly long.</br>    <br>Still not as cute as Sakura.</br>  <br>post more saber pls.</br>    Prisma is 31 hours away.  <br>I liked this scene too.</br>  Shirou shops at Whole Foods.  <br>Wait a blood sucking second.<br><br>That HF CG in the bottom left corner.<br><br>That's from an RN scene, isn't it?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Well fuck.<br><br>Not a good sign, is it?</br></br></br>  no its much worse  <br>Anyone got idea what they used to replace the wet dream episode with Rider Rin?</br>  <br>http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthrea<wbr>d.php/5907-Plot-Without-Porn-Let-s-<wbr>Play-R%C3%A9alta-Nua-s-H-less-Scene<wbr>s-Image-Heavy-%28Third-HF-Scene-pos<wbr>ted%29<br><br>Knock yourself out.</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Has anyone read both the original and Realta Nua versions of F/SN? Having read the RN version of the Ruins scene made me consider reading through RN next time since that dragon seems pretty cool. Overall, though, which one has the better scenes?</br>  <br>Honestly, for me I'm kind of neutral to them at this point.<br><br>I was initially really against the use of the dolphin scene in the UBW anime, because I feel it robbed the viewer of a proper culmination to Rin and Shirou's relationship, but with the epilogue, which went far and above to hammer that in, I can look at things a little more objectively. I now find it to be a nice little scene where, after a route of Rin looking into Shirou, finding out more about him, Shirou gets to look into Rin. That works, I get that.<br><br>At the same time though, some people just think the replacement scenes are just kind of dumb. I still wholly agree about that with HF. I think finger sucking is dumb.</br></br></br></br></br>  In HF, was the plan always to use Rule Breaker to seperate Sakura from Avenger? I feel like it kinda came out of nowhere, and I'm hoping It's just because I had been reading non stop from 11 to 6  <br>The sex scenes are kinda awkward to read, but I read through them originally because i felt like I was going to miss out on a part of the story reading the RN version. <br><br>Having read the RN scenes, i'd say the worst thing about them is that Shirou and his heroine don't reach quite the same place in their relationship and some of the replacement scenes are just as awkward.<br><br><br>pic related is the one RN scene I'm really hoping they adapt in the HF movie.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Which ones?</br>  <br>My god, imagine if the ANN landwhales knew of this.</br>  <br>Does Shirou have a teddy bear in his grocery bag?</br>  <br>Which ones are just as awkward? I was really only thinking of the HF ones like  was talking about.</br>  <br>I see.<br><br>What's your opinion on Fate's H-scene replacements?</br></br></br>  <br>this is doing things to my dick</br>    <br>The first RN scene It fits a little bit better than the sex scene and the art isn't half bad. The only thing about that scene that I don't like is that Shirou is now weaker than he was in the original route. Not that it makes a difference in the story.<br><br>The second RN scene is pretty good. Just Shirou and Saber being cute together and I feel like its makes a good replacement for the h-scene while still showing proof of their relationship.<br><br>I also just realized there is some info in that first RN Fate scene that is relevant in HF. Didn't realize it the first time reading.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Saber looks so cute right there! I wanna see her dressed like that more often.</br>    Question: Who has that large screencap of a late thread Shirou x Saber x Francis Drake fanfictioning?  <br>I've never bought an anime figurine, but I've been thinking about maybe getting a Saber one. Will I have crossed a line I can never come back from?</br>  <br>It depends on how much you like Saber.</br>    <br>No, but it isn't nearly as good as TM fags make it out to be. It's entry level shit, which is hilarious considering how defensive they get about it.</br>  <br> wormslut <br> cute </br></br>  <br><br>everything /a/ hates is good<br>everything /a/ likes is bad<br><br>it should be common sense by now</br></br></br></br></br>  nero &gt;&gt;&gt; arthuria  <br> post swimsuit nameless servant vs archer </br>  <br>Not enough to call her my waifu so maybe I'm safe for now.<br><br>Any fans of the OST in here? I really like some of the songs from the vn like: This Illusion, Emiya, New Dawn, Sorrow, Ever-present Feelings, etc.</br></br></br>      <br>Mordred has the best armor design (minus the helmet)</br>  <br>oh lol, archers face in pannel 1<br><br>"WTF IS GOING ON"</br></br></br>  <br>The helmet is great too.</br>  I really wish Type Moon would move onto something completely and expand the Nasuverse rather than rehashing the Fate series over and over again.  <br>Nasu's been trying to, but everyone just wants more Fate. He's the one who put out Mahoyo and is trying to put out the Tsukihime remake.</br>  <br>completely new*</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=FTr<wbr>pJUvNy-M</wbr>  [ ]  <br>I feel the same way, but apparently they wanna milk fate till it's dry. I'm hoping mahoyo will get me my Type Moon fix if a translation ever comes out.</br>  <br>Same.<br><br>I hope they do a futuristic setting or even something set during medieval times for their next work.</br></br></br>  <br>Personally I would want to see more stuff related to the Church and/or Dead Apostles.</br>  No, it's only because /a/ is filled with moe babies whose only criterion for good anime is:<br><br> appeals to paedophiles <br> has an all female cast <br><br>Whereas Fate has a mixed cast with well written characters with strong motivations. It also has good action, another thing that /a/ hates. Read the FSN VN too, it goes more into depth about all the gruesome details than the anime does. Also FZ LN. That almost as good.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Futuristic setting <br><br>That sounds interesting. So something like  Shadowrun  but with servants?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah this is kinda what I'm hoping for. Maybe with a more legitimate magus or church protagonist.</br>  <br> servants using anything other than their magic weapons </br>  <br>Shirou always recognizes Saber is superior to him in ability and has no problem letting her fight for him in Fate until she almost dies against Assassin since that's now the second time he's seen her almost die. Remember that dead end 3 happens because Shirou and Saber both agree to storm the temple together I.e. he let's her fight for him.</br>  <br>The hell? Did Deadpool just give Daredevil a gatling gun?</br>  <br>No its Spiderman giving the Flash a solid projectile dispenser</br>  <br>No, Fate is confirmed classic.</br>  <br>Yes. It's still a must read for people who want to get into VNs though.</br>  <br>I didn't do any Tiger Dojos and still got Last Episode.</br>  bump for the best girl  <br> So is Arc, who is even worse than Saber. </br>  <br>I could never understand how she learned how to pleasure a man.</br>  <br> Not Gawain or Siegfried </br>  <br>Siegfried is too overdesigned for my taste but Gawain has the 2nd best armor design in Fate.<br><br> pic related is the best </br></br></br>  <br> ifunny.com </br>  <br>Yeah, basically things that made people hate the situation in the VN, IF they only watched the anime like the filthy secondaries that they are, wouldn't know of that. So if you actually liked the UBW anime and "muh MC" shit, it only proves you're of shit taste that haven't read the VN at all.</br>  Still a neat cover.  <br>Shirou is a good character regardless, the point I was making was the anime carefully handled some things that might turn off a group of people who might have already been predisposed to dislike this character. <br><br>It also didn't really change the plot in any way.</br></br></br>    Can't believe this bait thread is still up.<br><br>Guess mods delete shitposting when it comes to SAO (something they like) only.</br></br>      <br>Soon.</br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br> Implying that I didn't get it from some anon on /a/ </br>  <br>I...  didn't like Fate/Zero much at all. </br>  <br>It's not about Zero, it's about Berserker.

Fate has multiple anime covering every route, prequel, sequel, and spinoff. The winner is obvious.</br>  <br>One has a little sister you actually have a route with, one doesn't.<br>I've made my point</br></br>  <br>But the point was, it is still possible that there exists a timeline where Shirou did metaphorically put out the flame, and yet humanity still managed to go to space.<br>Whereas that anon was talking about it as if it was certain.<br>Not that his metaphor isn't overall pretty good.</br></br></br>  <br>The maids are the answer.<br> Not even talking about the waifu potential. Just their routes. </br></br>  <br>Its very unlikely they'll ever get that far even if its another thousand years away or more, and Gilgamesh can see the future so he knows this is a pretty distinct possibility.<br><br> Q: So there is still quite a bit of background information that has yet to be revealed. <br> Narita: That's right. One of the most core pieces of information had been about the conditions for becoming a Heroic Spirit. This was revealed in a bonus novel that came with the UBW 1st season BD box. About how Merlin is still alive in the present so he can't become a Heroic Spirit. As Gilgamesh is also a fellow clairvoyance user, I asked about the state of Gilgamesh's memories when he's summoned. The answer I got was that Gilgamesh can see the possibilities of various parallel worlds if he so chooses, but the Throne adjusts the memories and knowledge of the Heroic Spirit according to the world they are summoned in, so he won't be confused by having multiple sets of memories. I was told that even if he did use clairvoyance to see the possibility of a world where he was swallowed by the mud of the grail, Gilgamesh would reject that world line as being nonsense (lol). I heard a bit of the workings of the Greater Grail, what it was based on, and other bits of important background information for Fate, but I believe Nasu will one day write the story of how the Greater Grail was disassembled! </br></br></br></br>  <br>Take the stick and become a magical girl.</br>  <br>I guess Nuruto must be superior to Fate as well due to how popular it is.</br>  <br>I remember actually thinking the same the first time I read about it, but I actually liked reading it a lot.<br>Know why?<br>Because summaries aren't end-all and be-all they pretend to be. It's all in the experience and in the details, in the way it's worded, shown and experienced. You could call it "qualia", I guess, if you don't mind some out-of-place pretentious philosophical terminology.<br>It is sometimes kinda pretentious, but I wouldn't say it's overtly so. It is all a pretty edgy setting, but there is a character to it.<br>Reading Kara no Kyoukai does make me think Nasu has a penchant for being pretentious, but I don't remember ever thinking he went overboard in Fate. If anything, in that regard, that's probably one of the works where he reigned it in the best.<br>In any case, I do think there is something worth reading there. I wasn't really much of a fan until I read Tsukihime and fell in love with it, but it still was fun, and it does remain so.<br>I think the first route is more than enough to make an opinion. It is the weakest, but it's still a pretty good gauge.<br> Yes,, I know I'm late and it was probably bait. Just felt like responding because it sounded halfway legitimate a question. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tsukihime was the influential one. It was proof that doujin VNs could be commercial successes and inspired countless doujin VNs to be made. Fate/Stay Night, on the other hand, was just another commercial cash cow and it's obvious by the way they milk it.</br>  <br> Gilgamesh can see the possibilities of various parallel worlds if he so chooses <br>Wait, so it wasn't just some kind of intellectual foresight, he literally can foresee it? Didn't know that.<br>Also, kinda off-topic, but this whole "humanity stopped progressing, boo-hoo, you half a dozen people are the only ones who can reignite it" was always a major pet peeve of mine. The rate of progress compared to before is only rising, and we've done as much in the last two centuries as we did in the twenty before! If anything, it's adoption of new technologies that's the problem, we're struggling to wield that much power, but we're still kinda pulling through at the moment. How the hell is this stagnation?<br>Well, I somewhat ignore it in Nasuverse because it is explicitly not like the real world, and there it kinda makes sense due to metaphysics of the world. Still, most of the time it's done in a stupid way and mostly just assumed to be true without any proof by some god or something. It just makes me think this particular god is an autist, if anything.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes if you have developed taste. <br>No if you haven't.</br></br>  <br>Well, maybe we aren't stagnating technology wise, but morally it has been foretold that we are heading towards death as a society. I can't remember if it was Sikhism or another Eastern religion, but there is a cycle of ages that time goes through that chronicles moral development of the people. Right now, we are fairly close to the end that has spanned many, many years, so this idea of the world ending soon isn't too farfetched.</br>  <br>Go with Saber on a date to the pool. It unlocks when you talk to Illya about the said pool.</br>   tfw decided to patiently wait for UTW translations and not watch the particular episode until it comes out <br> maybe kinda autistic, but I already read the VN so saw no reason to hurry with watching what is essentially a side dish for me <br> not like I can't just eyeball it when funposting on /a/ about it <br> tfw month later and still no sight of the last episode, the only one with original content and supposedly Rin being cute <br> still haven't watched it until now <br>I'm now on the fourth story of Kara no Kyoukai. I first read it then watch the corresponding movie.<br>I swear, if I finish with KnK, and they still don't have that episode subbed...<br>I would feel really bad about just not watching it on the day it first aired. And also I will just stop waiting and watch whatever subs I come upon first.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon that's like 150 wpm. I know that there's pretty pictures and shit to distract you but that's a completely unacceptable reading level for an adult.</br>  <br>Why not wait for the BDs?</br>  <br>Humans these days are more inclined to seek their own comfort than to explore the sea or space. They're mostly fine with the status quo of the moment in their ease.<br><br>Seems Nasu has a lot of dreams about humanity going further, and reaching the stars.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't expect #25: Epilogue for another couple days.</br>  <br>K. Thanks, anon.</br>  What is your honest opinion of Fate/stay night?  <br>It's silly and fun.</br>  a little more.  <br>Stories themselves are fun and good, each new one only brings more to the table while being even more fun. People are too hung up on the original to experience the later ones at times however. Either that or have decided they will never read anything beyond the first because they hate the later ones on principle due to "Pandering, milked to death shit, bad".<br><br>The fans can be terrible at times, but I won't hate the stories.</br></br></br>  I can't believe people are still arguing about "is Gil chaotic good".<br><br>No he's not, in classic DnD alignment a good character will never kill an innocent person and Gilgamesh was willing to kill the majority of the human population in UBW.</br></br>  <br>Fate isn't DnD faggot</br>  <br>k</br>  <br>You have to remember that in UBW he was tainted by the Grail. Of course he will kill people he deems not worthy of living, but that doesn't make him crazy or evil. Try doing research on him and then reform your argument.</br>  <br>I don't really agree with that either. We're progressing morally too, even if it is slower than technologically.<br>And even if it mostly by admitting how much we suck in some ways. Can't fix a problem if you don't see it as a problem. It has its detriments too, but it's necessary in long-term.<br>At least, that's the impression I got. I'm no history expert so I can't be sure whether they were more moral than we are. I always thought that they were mostly the same, they just didn't care about it as much. But it could be that I am wrong, I guess, since it's kinda unfounded on any objective data.<br><br>Aren't lots of people psyched about going to Mars? I think if anybody had a workable solution, lots of people would agree to go, even if because of a beauty of an idea.<br>But the thing is, it's expensive, hard, cumbersome, hard, ridden with problems, hard and not even nearly the only problem or the solution to every problem. Scientists are still solving tons of problems it has, and it can't be done right away. Like, radiation needs a solution, terraforming needs to be developed if we aren't just going sightseeing, and tons of other problems.<br>And it's not like we can just ignore all the other problems and start working only on it.<br>And what is there even to explore about sea? Like, sure, it's not even near being completely explored, but the Earth is already mapped, and exploring the sea itself isn't nearly as romantic a venture. Maybe practical, but not the stuff of dreams.<br>Being content with status quo - maybe, but hasn't it always been that way? I'm not nearly naive enough to think it's going to change either. It doesn't need to, really. 5% from 7 billion is more than enough.<br>In any case, it's not like being content with your life is bad either. Not everybody needs to be one of the movers and shakers. There is a certain kind of happiness in just living your life too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>suck dick.</br>    <br>After you suck mine, I might consider rewarding you in such a way.</br>  <br>Sea contains more wonders than you could imagine. We've explored space more than we've really explored the sea.<br><br>Its the last hidden wonder of sorts, so close yet unreachable.</br></br></br>  <br>I did for the first cour, but I decided to watch the second cour in TV quality 'cause I got kinda tired of waiting. Also, funposting in threads talking primarily about the anime without having watched even an episode of anime at all was becoming kinda hard.<br><br>Well, I will certainly read for far longer than that. I'm not hurrying with it.<br>In any case, why "a couple of days"? Do you have any information about it?</br></br></br></br>  Thoughts on Zouken Makiri?  <br>How I suck something that is nonexistent?</br>  <br>worm grandpa</br>  <br>By using your imagination, of course!</br>  <br> In any case, why "a couple of days"? Do you have any information about it? <br><br> Xythar: edited, encoded, timed, not tlc'd. i will bug the tlc some more. </br></br></br>  <br>It's genuinely pretty good.<br>Not without its flaws or stupid parts, but better than 95% of other stuff, genuinely deserves most of the popularity it got, even if maybe not all the popularity.<br>Not generic by any margin. Philosophical issues aren't generic either, and are really fun to think and talk about.<br>Tsukihime is still more beautiful, though, even if Fate is more polished.<br>Sometimes a bit too edgelord for its own good, but I guess it's just the setting. The prose and thought patterns of heroes are consistently weird, but I kinda love its weirdness for some reason. It just pulls me into the setting.<br>The amount of Grail Wars is getting ridiculous, but I don't mind as long as it's fun.<br>I remember thinking a lot in the way characters were doing things and looked at the world seemed autistic and unnatural to me at first, but it grew on me.<br>Also, infinitely fun to funpost about.<br>Gets a lot more flak than it deserves and also a lot more adoration than it deserves at the same time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Was he really?<br>Wasn't he basically unable to be tainted by being too self-absorbed?<br>I think it was something more of a "humanity is in a self-loathing teenager stage of its life, and Gil is human, so he kinda goes wild too".</br></br></br>    <br>Would be interesting to see when he was sane and idealistic to add more characterization, sort of just goofy evil otherwise.</br>  I have a question<br><br>In UBW, what's the answer Archer receives at the end, and I guess what is the "question"? Didn't quite understand it</br></br>  <br>He was tainted by his own humanity in F/SN, as CCC talks about roughly two times.<br><br>He was untainted in Zero, he wasn't tainted by Angya, but when he was incarnated he was tainted. Not because he was self absorbed, but because when he's officially part of humanity his will and ego in a sense have to align with present day humans in certain ways.<br><br>Its an "Alaya" type thing, when you're part of humanity you are conceptually together and part of it.<br><br>Mainly just makes him a bit more excitable, and less of an observer which he takes pride in. Since his entire thing when he's "True" Gilgamesh is that he's removed from the equation, he's above it, he's not taking part.<br><br>There were two other reasons why 2010 era didn't agree with him that led to this result, while in a different situation he would be a pretty cool guy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>You may want to stick to reading The Cat in the Hat. It may be a little complicated, but it's more at your reading level.</br>  <br>"But he earns a small answer.<br>The answer is only for this summoning. It is a meaningless thing that he will forget the next time he is summoned.<br>But there is nothing to regret.<br>It is something that has already been built up, something that the boy will build using all his life."<br><br>^that's what I'm referring to</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's some various quotes about what this means<br><br> Q: In Sakura’s Route, what happened to the devoured Gilgamesh? Sabre was blackened and enslaved, but was Gilgamesh’s will too strong to be dominated? Or was he completely digested? <br> A: He simply cannot be controlled. In fact Gilgamesh cannot be blackened. After being devoured by the Grail, Sakura converted Gilgamesh into mana in haste because she was afraid that Gilgamesh might tear her up from the inside if she does not digest him. However, His Majesty was very hard to digest, so “Angra Mainyu” must have been plagued by belly-ache (laughs). <br><br> This is the madness caused by coming into contact with Angra Mainyu, All of the World's Evil. There are individuals who have harnessed the black mud as power, as well as those who have resisted the spiritual corruption by virtue of powerful ego. Matou Sakura would be an example of the former, while Gilgamesh would be the latter. <br><br> “Fool. As if my affection points would rise. <br> I am more indifferent now than I usually am. <br> Most of what goes on is none of my business, after all. <br> If I were, for example, to become incarnated, my blood as a human would stir <br> and my nature would gravitate towards that of the humans of that era--- <br> however, there is no such alteration here. <br><br> Additionally, because he is not incarnated in Extraverse, he is not affected by the nature of the era’s civilization. In CCC, one may occasionally catch glimpses of the more personal sides of a neutral Gilgamesh from the era of the epic. <br><br> Interview summary: "Apparently Gil's personality is heavily influenced by the era he's summoned into. He was a jerk in FSN because the world (his property) was being sullied by the consumption society of the early 2000s, which rubbed him the wrong way. He's taken a liking to the virtual world of 2032, though, so his personality is more stable and closer to how he actually was in life. Wada says he reminds her a little of Hollow Ataraxia Gil." </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Already did that and been on the ride at universal 50 times. Pls.</br>  <br> What if I didn't read The Cat in the Hat?<br>Should I?<br>Obviously read through the entirety of the VN.</br></br> </br>  <br>why is she smoking? That can't be good for her health.</br>  <br>I think it's just a problem on your end buddy</br>  <br>It seems Type-Moon is trying to transition out of this "Only Fate" phase though. Even with the newest Fate series, Strange fake, there's a lot of talk of dead apostles and even ORT was brought up in conversation. I'm guessing it's an attempt to introduce Fate fans to Tsukihime material.</br>  <br>Dead Apostles were referenced in Fate/Zero, weren't they?</br>  <br>Yes but not the extent that they have been mentioned in Strange fake due to one of the participants being a dead apostle and a lot of dead apostles getting involved one way or another.</br>  <br>According to Notes, if humanity had just listened to a prophecy told in the year 2000, they would have made it out alive as victims but lo and behold no one bothered to do anything about it or possinly chose to disregard the prophecy as rubbish.</br>  <br> possinly <br>Possibly. <br>I just can't type today it seems.</br></br></br>  <br>I can't really blame them. There are so many wrong and straight-up rubbish "End of the World" prophecies it's not that hard to miss the real one.<br>Also, did prophecy need them to do anything hard? Was it ever widespread? Because if it's not, I refuse to believe all the people who waited for the end of the world in 2012 just randomly chose to ignore that one in particular.</br></br>  <br><br>Oh, also, magi confirmed for being the reason nobody can have nice things once again.<br>It's not just that the prophecy was most likely ignored because they were so good at keeping magic quiet. It's that none of these assholes did anything about it either.</br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>The details of the prophecy aren't really known but Gun God is extremely bitter about humanity not listening to it considering what's going on in Notes. <br>Like you said though, it was probably something like the 2012 doomsday prophecy but it also could have been announced by a scientist whose statements led him to be disregarded as a lunatic or possibly a modern saint from the church, a magus, etc,etc. We'll never know unless this story is expanded on.</br></br>  <br>But are Types really even magical beings? The black barrel it takes to kill them isn't really made of magic but rather dark matter and during notes everyone is fighting with grain not magic.</br>  <br>Well, I assumed the prophecy was mystical and was ignored by muggles because they believe magic doesn't exist.<br>Which would technically make it a fault of the magi in huge part. It's their business dealing with mystical prophecies nobody else listens to, since they are the ones actively keeping other people from messing with it.<br>Ah, who am I kidding. Even if they heard it, they would rather spend the time seeking the mystical root beer anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>Q: If this is the way it turns out after a life of being a superhero, was it really worth all this shit?<br>A: Don't care, I just really wanna be a superhero.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, when you really think about it the magus association has got to be single most useless organization in the Nasuverse outside of the 27 DAA. They don't really benefit the outside world to the extent that the burial agency and church do ( slaying dead apostles and demons is helpful) and if anything cause more trouble by throwing grailbowls every 10 years in random towns.</br>  <br>Grail rituals are considered very little known and backwater sort of things, that aren't taken seriously. Nasu makes sure to mention that they're very unimportant sort of things to the higher ups and people at large, rather than a main thing at all.<br><br>They do far more grand rituals than that all over the place.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean it's a really small event in the magus world but it still sucks for the civilians of the town who get killed during it.The magus association isn't entirely useless, Waver disproves this through his actions in case files but in terms of what they provide for society as a whole with the power they have? They do very little.</br>  <br>It's a necessary evil. If they didn't keep stuff in check, it'd be dozens of towns wiped out every month rather than a few coverups every once and a while.</br>    <br> useless organization in the Nasuverse outside of the 27 DAA <br><br>The 27 don't give a shit about anyone other than themselves. And rightly so.</br></br></br>  <br>Why would they provide shit to society? They just want to lie in their basements and research.</br>  Kancolle needs more doujins like Level 1 Zuikaku and less official manga like Honor Student.    Shouhou is beautiful.  <br>Is this a bait?</br>    <br><br>Second girl that died in the anime. <br><br>And no one cared.</br></br></br></br>   Almost every anime OP/ED has a full version of it that lasts between 3 and 5 minutes <br> Almost every full version anime OP/ED has a live action music video accompanying it <br><br>Does this mean that anime studios just pic random songs that are popular in Japan as their OPs and EDs, or that some anime OPs and EDs become so popular that they become part of mainstream music?<br><br>It could really go either way as far as I know because 9/10 anime songs make literally zero sense when you translate them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the song isn't out yet in most cases, so they have no way of knowing whether it'll be popular or not.<br><br>It just doesn't make sense to have an artist make a song exclusively for an anime. It wouldn't gain much traction. So they make a general song that can be used as a single for that artist.</br></br></br>  <br> It just doesn't make sense to have an artist make a song exclusively for an anime. <br>That's what they do (or did in the 80s) for American shows, right? It's weird that Japan rarely bothers (and even then it's only when those songs are sung by the voice actors of that same show, which admittedly makes sense and is pretty cool).<br><br>Why do Americans do this all the time while the Japanese do not? Does it have to do with different marketing models?</br></br></br></br>  Did SZS also just chose random songs for the OP? Because it fit pretty damn well.  Why are little kids in mecha anime ALWAYS the worst character?      Because little kids are the worst.  Those kids ruined the series for me  Young people do not handle life in 2015 well when they are nearly always in relative safety.

Starting from Vol. 2. I've got plenty of time to knock this out. I'm a huge fan of Kinmoza and it's relatively popular so I always just assumed that someone was TLing it.</br>  <br>Ok, meanwhile, let me post the two images of the missing pages here...  thanks NDTL for your tl request thread. </br>      <br>Is that Alice's dad? He looks pretty young?</br>  <br>Yep, Alice's dad. The couple looks pretty young.</br>  <br>agreed. And honkers needs to join too. Such a shame she couldnt attend the beach</br>  <br>What's your group handle?</br>  <br> no swimsuit Honkers <br> no kimono Kusshi <br>Why live?</br></br></br>  <br>Not much of a group to be honest. We've done a couple of hentai but that's about it. I really just want to put something out there for this if nothing else really exists.</br>  <br>Like this?</br>  <br>So I see. Yeah, nothing else exists as far as I know.</br>  Here's some proof that I'm actually doing this.  <br>Ok, great. Thanks. Where will this hit first when the chapter is done?</br>  <br>I don't know? I might just make a thread on 4chan and post a link to the file or something. I still need someone to typeset if my usual guy doesn't want to. I could post raws with a script but that seems a bit lazy to me.</br>  <br> no swimsuit Honkers </br>  <br>Oh lord they have to animate that.</br>    <br>Hopefully we get the entire gang together at the beach or a summer festival. OR BOTH.</br>  If there's a downside to S3, it's that we have to see Karen with shit appearances. Like this.  Honoka you have shit taste to give Karen lolita clothes.   <br>Well, Honkers is usually either wearing her school uniform or tennis outfit, plus she likes the dresses Shino makes. We can only imagine what kind of fashion sense she has.</br>  <br>Her imagination of Karen actually puts Karen in better dresses. So how the hell does she pick such a shitty getup?</br>  <br>She appreciates her blonde goddess in all of her appearances, no matter how atrocious they may be. Such is the life of a member of the Kinpatsu Alliance.</br>  <br>Here's some appreciation from the second to last page of Vol 6.<br><br>Are these two not a lowkey couple yet?</br></br></br>  <br><br>The gay seems turned up even one more notch compared to anime S2.</br></br>  <br>Does that mom ship Aya and Yoko too?</br>  <br>The characters make progress as the series goes on.</br>  <br>It would not come as a surprise.</br>  So how old is she?  <br>It's ambiguous. People claim that text is just Aya's mom just asking where Yoko is with no implications.</br>  <br>Maybe in her 20's. She got out of HS some years ago, now what's required to teach home ec?</br>  <br>Younger than Karasuma.</br>  <br>17  most likely around 25 but i dont think its told </br>   You will never have an immoral student teacher relationship with Kusshi   <br>Both Karen and Kusshi need to stop this two-timing. Kusshi x Karasu, Karen x Honkers. Grrr.</br>  <br> next up we have this exquisite creature. Bidding starts at $22. </br>  <br>If she wears a Union Jack jacket does her value go up?</br>  <br>Yes, it becomes 22 bong dollars.</br>  Make of this what you will.  <br>They're really the same.</br>  <br>What a beautiful housewife Rize has become.

Deeeeeeesu.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I heard it was something along the lines of Honkers asking Karen to go on another shopping trip, with Karen gleefully agree as usual.<br><br> It's also a low-key date invitation, not that Honkers would admit that. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks.</br></br>  <br>Sorry but uh... wanna do a quick jab at  next?</br>  <br><br>Kuzuhashi-sensei: Here you go.<br><br>Random guy: Thank you, very much.<br><br>Karasumi-sensei: That's right, today is...<br><br>Karasumi-sensei: You're a capable woman, aren't you, Kuzuhashi-sensei.<br><br>Kuzuhashi-sensei: What are you saying!<br><br>Kuzuhashi-sensei: I'm always giving all types of gifts to the teachers.<br><br>This is a teacher's duty.<br><br>Karasumi-sensei: But I'm always just receiving gifts!<br><br>Random teacher: What a big present.<br><br>Karasumi-sensei: I wonder what I should give back in return.<br><br>Kuzuhashi-sensei: I told you it's fine.<br><br>Random teacher: Her attitude towards just her is a bit different. (?) <br><br>Honestly not too sure about the last line but that's the general meaning.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You might be the only thing that's going to keep KinMoza thread alive on /a/ for more than 100 posts, anon. We'll have plenty to talk about if we have both a translated manga to discuss as well as the anime. I really don't know how to say thanks.</br>  <br>Ahh, Christmas Cake yuri. I never thought I needed it in my life, but apparently I do.</br>  <br>Only problem is that it's literally the same thing for now. Until we see the unique chapters that never made it in, that's when the threads might explode.<br><br>HAHAHAHAHAHA I never thought I could get someone's attention to bring back the scanlations. Too funny.<br><br><br>I see. Thank you.<br><br>It's not just that, random teacher. It's not just that...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well here's the thing. I don't know how long it's going to take for us to catch up from volume two. That's a lot of stuff to be translated and a lot of stuff that was already in the shows. I could focus more on the newer stuff if that was what people wanted.</br>  <br>Take a page from the Bakkin Translation guys.<br>My two cents is that you should start off from an appropriate spot where the anime leaves off, maybe even a few chapters earlier so reader understand the timeline. Maybe translate the chapter where Alice and Karen leave for the holidays, then start translating newer things from there. Anyone interested in KinMoza is most likely already to have seen the anime.</br></br>  <br>As the student or the teacher?</br>  <br>Sounds good to me if no one else objects and doesn't mind leaving the earlier volumes untranslated.</br>  <br>What would you teach her?</br>  <br>I'd say all ten people in this thread are fine with it.</br>  <br>If this is going to be the case then I'm just going to post the script for Vol. 2 Chapter 1 here with the raws.</br>  <br>But there's 27 unique posters, anon!  Which is still depressingly low compared to when the show was airing. </br>  Today in music class there was a singing test.<br><br>Shino: I was quite nervous!<br><br>Alice: It feels like there’s some black aura… ah!<br><br>Youko: There’s only one person drawing a lot of attention to themselves here.<br><br>Aya: I’m hopelessly tone deaf.<br><br>Alice: Your singing was great, Aya!<br><br>Alice: It had a tremendous Aya feel to it!<br><br>Shino: Your singing voice is very Aya-ish.<br><br>Youko: It was for sure very Aya like.<br><br>Aya: They’re totally not complimenting me!<br><br><br>Can you let me know which volume and chapter Karen and Alice leave for the holidays?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whatever she wants to know.</br>  Aya: Youko’s voice was loud and sounded really fun, didn’t it!<br><br>Youko: Oh, thanks.<br><br>Alice: Shino’s voice was entirely like a pipe organ!<br><br>Shino: Is that so?<br><br>Youko: That’s not the sound of a human voice.<br><br>Shino: Alice had everyone in the class smiling.<br><br>Shino: She had an amazing effect that made everyone listen.<br><br>Shino: That’s it! How about we record Alice singing and broadcast it to the entire country!<br><br>Shino: We can make the entire world smile!<br><br>Alice: Stop it please!<br><br>Shino: Karen’s singing was very good!<br><br>Karen: It wasn’t that good.<br><br>Youko: Although in some spots her Japanese was a bit off.<br><br>Aya: I want to hear you guys try to sing a duet.<br><br>Alice: That’s fine with me.

(It's a Japanese word pun. Mushroom is take and laughing is warai. Waraitake is a mushroom.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>How about we catch up with the newer stuff and then after that go back and translate the older volumes?

Everything from the quality animation, the retarded dialog and plot, and the blatant fanservice, can't watch it without a stupid grin on my face.  <br>I liked it. Would give it a 7/10<br><br>I like almost everything I watch though.</br></br></br>  <br>And this was supposed to be a trainfags niché show. <br>My balls.</br></br>  <br>I was looking forward for that too.<br>Aoi's ass ate the train's budget.</br></br>  <br> That bomb defuse scene. </br>  <br>I liked it for a while, but lost interest after a few episodes.</br>  <br>what is the train niche in japan? models ? taking pics of the real ones? <br><br>this faggots idea? </br></br></br>  <br> pointing a firearm at yourself <br>TRIGGERED</br></br>  <br> watching anime for anything other than titties and ass </br>   show girls with tiny bikinis in preview <br> they end up wearing boring swimsuits instead <br> not even uncensored in bd <br>blunder of the millenium</br></br></br>  Never forget.<br><br><br>Both models and train watching is a big thing in Japan.

I'm sad this anime didn't get that popular. We could've had great douijins.    <br>It's hard to find the good ones</br>  Time to finally pick this up.

They'll yank down his pants and each take turns giving him a blowjob, trying to be quiet as possible. The girls will draw straws to see who gets to start.

It's a shame she's the main girl. All the other girls are sexier.  Wasn't the chick with the long, light brown/pinkish hair a nutjob or was that just funposting?  <br>Only when they learn to draw them correctly and keep the same model.</br>    <br>One of the more epic scenes in anime history was watching 2 of the, erm, "females" activate the "D-unit" on the support vehicle.<br>Oh yeah, don't forget the parking snafu @ the main depot LOL.</br></br>  <br><br>I love it when official art is so fapworthy</br></br>  <br>Appalling trigger discipline.</br>  <br>That fucking shit trigger discipline.</br>  <br> This whole post </br>    <br><br>OP picture is way worse on safety to the point it actually bothers me.</br></br>  <br>Honestly, I didn't even notice the gun in OP till you said something.</br>  <br>u wot</br>  Fuck, now I want to re-watch this shit.<br>Please stop me, I do remember how shitty it was.</br>  <br>Listen to your dick, anon.</br>  <br>I won't stop you</br>  <br><br> "I can warm her up for you if you want, Anon-kun..." <br> "D-don't do that..." </br></br></br>  <br>Exept for the left grill's foot... can not unsee</br>  <br><br>Im@s cameo when</br></br>  <br><br>But I'll have to watch the bomb defuse scene again!</br></br>  <br>But do you remember that episode where they thought they were being chased by assassin cats?</br>  <br>He's fine as long as he has food.</br>  <br>I'd defuse her bomb, if you know what I mean.</br>  <br><br>wait a minute, that pool</br></br>  <br>Yeah, you will have to froze her first.</br>  <br>yes, it is That Pool.</br>  <br>You should checkout those two doujins then. He scores big time.</br>  <br> This show only got 2 doujins. </br>    <br><br>Shit, I remember now.<br>Didn't Aoi point her gun at MC at some point?</br></br></br>  <br>And his patlabor vest</br>  <br>I was referring to the two vest bro doujins, there are more but they aren't really that good.</br>  <br>Something about this image is really terrifying.</br>  <br>This show really deserves good doujins.</br>  <br>Yes. Pellet gun granted but yes.</br>  <br> Pellet gun </br>  <br>No escape.</br>  <br>Airsoft whatever.</br>  <br>I'm quite sure it has her service weapon. I don't recall air guns at any moment.</br>  <br>Doesn't she fire it and just miss? I can't remember, you might be right. I thought there was an offhand line about it or something but with this show, anything's possible.</br>  <br>Now I am curious, let me check it.<br> I still have the show on my HDD </br></br>  LN translations when      I want to see Aoi brutally assfucked.  <br>its the pool from shionmeta they blew up</br>  <br>She fires at them by accident, but it isn't told if it's a real gun or not. It makes common sense for it been a BB gun, but I don't remember her carrying anything but her real gun with her.</br>  <br> It isn't told or explained  <br><br>That was basically the MO of this entire show huh. What a wonderful clusterfuck.</br></br></br>  You had one job Passione, one job.<br>http://www.youdubber.com/index.php?<wbr>video=2Jy0ocIF7QU&amp;video_start=0&amp;aud<wbr>io=pl57hN4EaLU&amp;audio_start=158</wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br> you came to the wrong neighborhood motherfucker </br></br>  I love how at the wiki page the summaries of the episodes suddenly stop at episode 6, it's evident that whatever editor was doing just dropped the show at that point.<br>Also:<br> The An adventure game developed by 5pb. for the PlayStation Vita has been announced. The game was due for a November 27, 2014 release, until it was delayed. </br></br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2014-10-24/rail-wars-ps-vita-dela<wbr>yed-until-further-notice/.80324<br> that the delay is due to "various circumstances."  <br>Right.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  So which train has  inverted nipples   <br>Inverted nipples are shit-tier because you can't play with them.</br>  <br>I like that it's the cat episode too, just "fuck it, I'm out".</br>  <br>Look at that ass.<br>Look at it.</br></br>  It's such a shame that we live in a society that sexualizes women so much. This anime had the potential to be one of my favorites (since I truly like trains and their mechanics), however, the only thing that I got out of it was boobs and fan service. I just don't get it, if they are going to be going to such extremes why not just make a hentai? That way the audience that is actually looking for a show with trains as its main focus doesnt leave disappointed.  What was the reason pink breast monster was in love with the MC again?<br><br>It was something about their childhood but I don't have the anime on my hard drive anymore.</br></br>  Jesus, this show got nendos, and 2 of them.<br>It even has the fucking bomb defuse accessories.</br>    <br>I would've paid for a scale Nana figure, honestly.</br>  <br>He rescued her after she got trapped inside an office by some boxes. Of course the dense MC won't remember it.</br>  <br>He rescued her when they kids from...getting locked in a closet, at the train museum, I think?</br>  <br>Actually I think a bunch of us picked it up because of the train, or at least because it was gonna be something interesting.<br>It ended up being interesting in many ways I wasn't expecting, sincerely I regret nothing.</br></br>  <br>She also flipped her shit just because MC went to go meet another girl at a church.<br><br>She might be crazy.</br></br></br>  <br>Also echi =! hentai</br>  <br>Yandere love is the purest anon.</br>  <br>You realize they pop out when they harden from arousal don't you anon?<br><br>Of course not, you've never touched a woman in your life.</br></br></br>  <br>He is right, though. If the elevens want to make a show fill with fan service, then make it a hentai. If they want to make a show about a specific hobby/topic, then make it with that idea as its main plot. There is no reason to intermingle those two genres, especially when one of them is Safe for work and the other isn't.</br>    <br> those eyes </br>  Are real trains this comfy?  <br>Then why does anons get mad at me when I say that "plastic nee-san" was shit because it wasn't about scale models?</br>  Which train has the best  feet?   <br> those cars </br>  <br>Sleeper rail is comfy as fuck, if it wasn't expensive I'd do it all the time.</br>  <br>Yes they also rock you to sleep and sing you a lullaby.</br>  <br>I am a Harukafag<br> without doubt Aoi </br></br>  <br>And you have? Yeah okay buddy.</br>  <br>Fun is, I'm still not sure which one is correct.</br>  <br>Just so you know, most women don't have inverted nipples. It's extremely rare.<br>I don't see how not knowing how they work means you haven't been with a woman before.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I have, touched your mom last night.</br>    <br>fucking kek</br>  I want to board this train  The arts were even more delicious  <br>She already got a ticket to Fucking Dense MC's Harem</br>  <br>Why is she wearing riot gear?</br>  <br>Can't even remember.<br>I think it was something about terrorist.</br></br>  <br><br>The LN has an actual plot and antagonists rather than just completely random, nameless dudes wanting to blow up the railway for fuck knows what reason.</br></br>  <br>Terrorists trying to board her caboose.</br>   not adorning yourself in Rail Wars goods to show your superb taste to everyone   <br>250x237<br>let me guess you are still in 199X, right?</br></br>  <br>Is this a t shirt for ants?</br>  <br><br>Only picture on the goods site.</br></br>  <br>Jesus that's a cheesy motto</br>  FUCK THIS SHIT <br>Uno Makoto was put on this Earth to fill it with the beauty of healthy shemale incest and now he's doing this train shit.<br>There is no justice in the world</br></br>  <br> not when there's a rail, there's a way <br>Oh come on.</br></br>  <br>Can't fight those trains</br>  <br>I don't think doing character designs for Rail Wars was exactly so time intensive that he's abandoned all other work or something, not exactly a long running franchise or something. Nigga took a paycheck and went on his way.</br>  <br>I did</br>  <br><br>Those are some of the most generic designs I've ever seen</br></br>  <br>That's true, but our time on the planet is limited so he really should be devoting everything he can to producing more futa doujins<br>I think it's been a couple years by now</br></br>  <br>What is you're country?</br>  <br>Fuck this show. I was sold on cattle cars rolling up next to each other, sliding open, and cops and crims giving each other fucking broadsides. I wanted a god damn war on rails, and I didn't fucking get one.</br>  <br>Fuck off faggot.</br>  <br>I didn't think a fanservice show could be bad, then I started to watch Rail Wars. <br><br>Such a shame, the characters are hot as fuck</br></br></br>  <br>For most of them yeah, but Aoi is 10/10</br>  <br>They had to delay it until they could make a sufficiently advanced ass physics engine</br>  <br>Totally not a biased statement.</br>  <br>But I think it's true. I can't recall another similar character.</br>  <br>They did?</br>  <br>Aoi is thristy as fuck right there.</br>  <br>Entire dev team too busy fapping.</br>  <br>Maybe she should have stopped for a drink before boarding the train</br>      <br><br><br>I can definitely recognize Makoto's style in this, but my heart is crushed when I realize they don't have cocks larger than their thighs</br></br></br>  <br>She's gunna have such saggy fucking tits in about 4 or 5 years.</br>  So is this show worth watching if I just want a show with A&amp;T?<br><br>Does best girl win?</br></br>  What does the scouter say about their OTP-level?  <br>According to somebody claiming to be an LNfag Aoi is the main girl. It's still harem-y but not as much.</br>  <br>Nobody wins with Rail Wars. There are only losers.</br>  <br>I don't usually like these, but this one is pretty great.</br>  <br>Why is her hand so tiny?</br>  <br><br>Rape does not equal scoring.</br></br>  The threads were so fun.      <br>My nigga</br>  It had a surprisingly good OP and ED, credit where it's due.  <br>The girls were great but the show was actually complete shit.</br>  I wasn't exactly expecting Patlabor but this set a new low for police themed anime.<br>At least my penis was happy with it.</br>  <br><br>The only decent things about this show, aside from the cabooses.</br></br>  <br>yes they are</br>      <br>I'll rail her way, if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>Groningen is such a nice city</br>  <br><br>I have one of the artbooks. The art is gorgeous.<br>The girls are just hot enough to keep my dick standing, but the situations aren't hot enough to make me fap.<br><br>Artist could make some really high quality fap material, but all we'll get is cocktease.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Getting blueballed by an artbook </br>  This show was pure trash but goddamn, the girls sure were delicious  <br>I'd blow her Euphonium if you know what I mean</br>    <br><br>Now it makes sense</br></br>  <br>Yup, full of whores too<br>You should be here on a friday night once, goddamn</br></br>  <br>OH GOD SHE'S MISSING A QUARTER OF HER BODY</br>  <br> talking about anime which came out before the last season </br>  <br>muh dick</br>  Did they fix any of the QUALITY in the BDs?  <br>I don't get it.</br>  <br>read the thread, they added nipples</br>    <br>kek</br>  <br> This shit actually made me confused when I was watching. Like why would you hang fucking blank papers. <br><br>The show lacked budget so there were a ton of errors everywhere due to lack of checking. In this example, they needed cars, so someone just added a layer containing cars into the scene.</br></br></br>  http://fapservice.com/rail-wars-fan<wbr>service-compilation/</wbr>  <br>I really love the yellow and white cars on the left, just parked 5meters into the building. <br><br>Also find  extremely amusing.</br></br></br>  <br> Japan entrusts guns to teenagers now? <br>Aoi frequently brandishes her gun without getting reprimanded.

Even if he finds a way to restore his body there are still things that can stop brain activity like poisons and shit.<br>I hate anime Esdeath for the same fucking reason. Unreasonably overpowered, plot armored characters should never exist outside fan fiction for 13 year olds.</br>  <br> Tatsuya said himself that he wasn't sure he could beat Masaki even at full power, though <br>He was just being nice, he's the best and you know it.</br></br>  <br>He wasn't sure he could with one life. Difference.</br>  <br>He could probably find a way to perceive the sniper's presence<br>Also, Regrowth is really fast so stopping it would require something instantaneous</br></br>  Bump<br>So why wouldn't there be a second season? Popularity is alright, isn't it?</br>  <br>Didn't somebody already do that in the anime? And Tatsuya was fine like 2 seconds later because lol regrowth. What if somebody blew his brains out though, can he still regenerate?</br>  <br>It mostly depends on the sales, and from what I heard, it has a chance of getting a 2nd season in 1 or 2 years, maybe? There's also enough source material.</br>  <br>I don't think so, Rupture could probably kill him if he was able to activate his magic before Tatsuya's, which is possible, they are very close in speed. We've never seen Ichijou actually fighting at his specialty either which is mid-long range combat. I mean if Tatsuya can regenerate after his blood is instantly evaporated and his body exploding in pieces then really you might as well say he's immortal. I think Miyuki's Cocytus can "kill" him too if you consider it freezes the spirit. <br><br>Anyways, in Volume 15 Tatsuya pretty much reiterates that he's aware of Masaki's abilities and that he's a great ally but would make a formidable enemy. They're not going to fight against each other any time soon unless it's at like 9 SC.</br></br></br>  <br>Why are they all so moe?</br>  <br>Because it's a school for boys and you need to have some boy pussy to release stress.</br>  <br>He did say that, I don't think he lies about what he thinks of other people's capabilities. He's aware of his own abilities now unlike when he was 13 and Honami died. Volume 15-16 introduced a whole bunch of new asspulls like a magician's will having some kind of ability to influence things even in modern magic.</br>  <br>I forgot pic related.</br>  <br> 320x441 <br><br>Baby dont hurt me</br></br></br>  <br>Seeing Tatsuya and Masaki fight at full power would be great but unfortunately it won't ever happen.<br>By the way, why isn't Masaki a strategic-class magician although he's probably in the top ten strongest we've seen so far?</br></br>  <br>They do have grills, some pretty cute ones actually.</br>  <br>He got hit by a really good sniper once.<br>Only problem was that the sniper treated him like an ordinary person and aimed for the heart instead of the head.</br></br>  <br>No. No one can. Oniisama is a walking god.</br>  <br>You need the right CAD maybe? I've wondered about why Rupture wouldn't be able to be an S class sort of like Mio's Abyss to an extent. He does make a water bomb from the river against Zhou and his family uses it for underwater mine blasting so it has range and destructive power.</br>  <br>Sorry anon.</br>  <br>Yeah. He has the characteristics of a strategic class magician but isn't. Why would he need a specific CAD?</br>  <br>That and Lina's Brionac if it had aimed for his head instead of arm. It's probably really hard to kill him though without really good timing.</br>  <br>You could say the same thing about Maya<br>Some characters aren't strategic class magicians although they're definitely powerful enough to be.</br></br>  <br>S class magics all use special grade CADs. Lina has Brionac for Heavy Metal Burst and Tatsuya uses Third Eye for Material Burst. Regular CADs can't handle the energy output most likely so you need something better specialized for the magic. It's another reason why S class is rare, you need the right magic user and top notch engineers to build a CAD suitable for it.</br>  <br>So there are magicians who could be S class but aren't because they don't have the right CAD?<br>I thought Tatsuya could use material burst without third eye.</br></br>  <br>And maybe Maya could be one too if she had the right CAD. Her magic is a Decomposition variant so if you had something like Baryon Lance maybe it may work that way. Most of the S class magics seem to be Dispersal types from what we've seen so far.</br>  <br>Nope, he needs Third Eye for it and the military has it under lock and key until needed. He also needs a satellite for the coordinates. Tatsuya mentions this in Volume 13 iirc at the 2nd 9SC when he thought about blasting the Steeple Chase course but didn't have Third Eye and he wouldn't have enough time to make another CAD to use for MB. The fact that he even contemplated it is hilarious.</br>  <br>So S class magicians are created by giving them powerful CADs? In which case who decides who becomes S class and who doesn't? It doesn't really makes sense for Masaki to not be one of the thirteen apostles anyway.</br>  Riko is for _____.
