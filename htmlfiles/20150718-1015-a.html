Inactivity does that to people.  so what happened to HappyStick ?  <br>that guy is fucking annoying, half the stream is him pressing replay on a map and staring at chat. He is horribly unfunny and cringeworthy. fucker thinks people watch him for his personality rather than his skills, he thinks he has to be an entertainer but he doesnt realize the most entertaining thing is when he gets an incredible play. what a faggot, I cant stand him.</br>  <br>Okay but where the fuck did he go?<br><br>I don't see him in the rankings either</br></br></br>   Not osu!mania <br><br>It is not like I wanted to play with you guys anyways</br></br>  <br>Did you guys stop?<br>Can't find the room searching for /a/.</br></br>  <br>most of the time people watch streams for personality and community, gameplay has always had a secondary role<br><br>part of the reason why I can't stand watching shigetora, the gameplay is there but personality isn't<br>may as well be staring at Auto or just spectating some in-game</br></br></br></br>  <br>see </br>  <br>I made the thread too early.

Pro players get way more viewers on twitch than people who "r just funny". He tries way to hard to be an entertainer with his personality rather then his skills, and I honestly do not think he is funny at all. I think you will find that I'm not the only one who thinks this either.<br><br><br>It was, the parasite got unrestricted, apparently it was a mistake.</br></br></br></br>    <br> Pro players get way more viewers on twitch than people who "r just funny" <br>yeah sodapoppin is such a fuckin pro</br></br>  <br> Cookiezi averages a way higher viewer count than happystick. <br>so does WWW and he's literally fucking pewdiepie</br></br>  <br>He should probably just kill himself</br>  <br>I'm not sure what you mean, he's one of the best world of warcraft players.

The point of this game is not to have fun but to be the best, consequentially it is fun to be best. So fuck you for sitting around and not being able to play the game, it's pathetic to be content with your mediocrity.</br></br></br>  <br> The point of this game is not to have fun <br>please stop</br></br>  <br>so<br><br>how many non-TV SIZE 10.3 scores do you have?</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck of lewa</br>  <br>it's a reward system, you do something difficult and you get rewarded for it with a decrease in rank and satisfaction with your ability to complete the map. The fun comes with your own improvement, at it's core moving your pen in patterns and tapping to a beat isn't incredibly entertaining on its own. So no, the point isnt to have fun, the point is to improve.</br>   tfw you choke half way through and can't piece it back together   <br>non distance-snapped notes will break the system, as will random increases in difficulty. I agree with you though, it's stupid as shit.</br>  <br>feels better than 1 miss.

The jumps in those maps are rather big and that makes the game rate them as very difficult. I don't know what's hard to understand.</br>  Do you guys prefer to play cute anime maps, dance/DnB/electroshit "beat game" maps, or edgelord maps?  <br>Why do you think it has such an elaborate reward system if it isnt the point? By burnt out, I'm sure you mean a lack of interest. That's a quitters mentality and that too is pathetic.

Are you a newfag?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because they air in 720p and any higher would be an upscale, distorting quality.

I can only talk by myself, but sometime ago I had a very shit computer that didn't allow me to reproduce things in 1080p, so the best I could get was 720p.  <br> he gets his anime from public trackers </br>  <br>SUMMER FUN</br>  <br>Oh anon, you're so little and cute.</br>  <br>And I bet you use nyaa<br><br>inb4 &gt;implying</br></br></br>  <br>Also this.</br>    <br>so what</br>  <br>good enough quality without taking alot of disk space</br>  <br>I usually get 720p for CR and 1080p for Funi.</br>  <br>That's a public tracker.</br>  <br>Cause plebs like to eat shit<br><br>That's why I only watch Blurays.</br></br></br>  SHOW ME YOUR AB STATS  Because pretty much every airing show, except when it's from a studio like Kyoani, 720p with MadVR looks a lot better than the 1080p they're giving you.  <br>Decent quality and reasonable download time for my shit internet.</br>    <br><br> Piratebay </br></br>  Nice one  <br>WHO ELITE+ HERE?</br>    <br> not noticing obvious compression artifacts <br>uwotm8</br></br>  <br>what's bad about public trackers again<br>keep in mind I'm not an Americunt and where I am the popo doesn't come knocking on the door even if I visit CP sites</br></br>  <br>tbh i wouldnt call it public tracker<br><br>its much less popular then sites like piratebay or kickass</br></br></br>  <br>You don't know what "public" means.</br>  <br>You don't get to affect a sense of elitism on the Internet. And isn't that half the fun of downloading media?</br>  Anime is produced in various resolutions nowadays, ranging from 720p to 1080p.<br><br>However, Japanese HD broadcasts, like HD broadcasts everywhere, are in 1080i by default, with 720p alternatives.<br><br>720p &gt; 1080i for anything that has a lot of fast motion or complex action. 1080i loses half its frame rate when converted directly to 1080p, and applying a deinterlacing filter on it can make it difficult to run on a lot of media players. That's why fansubs use 720p encodes, which overall have higher quality for action sequences and scale to 1080p without losing fps. <br><br>Or rather, that was the case, since things have changed. Higher native resolutions + abysmal downscaling by sites like Funi have made 720p downscales noticeably worse than 1080p upscales.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, go ahead and make up your own definitions for words.</br>  <br> uses 'tbh' <br> has no clue what "public tracker" means <br>Why is /a/ infested with retards now?</br></br></br>  <br>So close</br>  <br><br>Please lurk more or kill yourself you newfag</br></br>  <br>I only joined about 6 months ago, mostly watch currently airing stuff.</br>  <br>Read the comments under every torrent and you'll realize how many faggots also use that site</br>  <br><br><br><br>educate me then, smartypants<br><br>and i use tbh because its short and catchy, dense fucktards</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>google.com<br><br>Fuck off, retard.</br></br></br>  <br>No, fuck off and lurk more.</br>  <br>Okay newfag why don't you learn to use google you retard</br>  <br>My little Anon can't be this bait.</br>  <br> The land of the Free </br>  <br>Lurkmore newfag.
