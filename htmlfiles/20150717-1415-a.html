Impure scum.</br>  <br>This is Evil. Evil is Good.</br>  Can we all agree this show is the spookiest of the season?  *Have you pledged your loayalty to Skeletor  <br>I cant wait for skeletor and his spooky minions to wreck shit next episode.</br>   papa bones will never :D me <br>Why even live?</br>  Oh my god they are going to die so fucking badly.  So other than fuckhueg dragon what do people think future plot points are gonna be<br><br>I'll go first<br><br>Leaders of Zuranon use   the creation of an undead ruled nation   to strike against The Empire and Kingdom throwing the continent into chaos</br></br></br></br>  <br>I am honestly surprised that there are good characters under Papa Bones. I would assume that the good characters get along less well than with the evil characters.</br>  http://skythewood.blogspot.sg/2015/<wbr>07/AO1.html</wbr>  I pledged my allegiance to her.  <br>The only "good" NPC are Alpha and Sebas and even Sebas who has the highest "good" alignment will do whatever the fuck anyone tells him so long as it furthers Ainz.<br><br>Sebas doesn't even really seem to dislike any of the majorly evil characters.</br></br></br>  I have joined the Gravelord covenant  How do lich's breed?  So I am not sure why /a/ hate this so much. The "hur dur trapped in a gaem" is stale but it looks like he is going to be alone and the focus is shifting away from the game aspects and more towards being trapped in fantasy land. <br><br>Am I missing something or am I taking shitposting too seriously?  or am I just blinded by the skelly MC </br></br>  <br>Whose this semen demon</br>  <br>A retarded maid</br>  <br>He doesn't like demiurge, the guy who skins and tortures people.</br>  <br> So I am not sure why /a/ hate this so much. <br>That's news to me. Bar a few shitposters, I'd have sworn it had been received if not positively then neutrally. Especially after episode 2.</br></br>  <br>Everyone hates Demi which they should</br>  I'm scared guys<br>the first episode was great like log horizon season 1 and the second was as bad as any from log horizon season 2. I really want this to be good.</br>  <br>I kept seeing that is was the worst anime this season. I find that hard to be true when GOD EATER is airing.</br>  <br>see file name</br>  <br><br>What are you talking about? The whole scene with Ainz flying to the moon was good and also Albedo scenes were great.</br></br>  <br>Of course he would, however Sebas is less likely to cause unnecessary destruction and murder unlike the evil cast. Sebas and Cocytus are less likely to enslave you, while the rest of the guardians would probably have no qualms about it.</br>  <br>People jacking off to how great the mc is and the mc being the nicest guy ever doesnt make an episode good. That's all they did in ep 2.</br>  <br> implying Ainz isn't the biggest dick OG </br>  <br>Where? Just ignore them. Most of them just heard "MMORPG and didn't bother taking a second look.</br>  <br>They are his servants, they cant do anything BUT drool for him. I agree it doesnt excuse a whole episode of drooling over the MC though.</br>  <br>If you didn't get that it was the whole point of those scenes, you probably weren't paying attention. Momonga finding out how they see him means he HAS to keep up the act in front of them even if he didn't want. That should bring out a bit of the "conflict" people like you seem to be looking for.</br>  Is Dio going to be He-Man?  So after checking around the web, the general consensus is about 85% positive. Most people are really just wondering where the series is going. And Albedo is currently the best girl.  EEEY EEEY E<br><br>Im liking the opening too much.</br></br>  <br>I mean when I saw that it was another MMO game it turned me off too, but I am enjoying it so far. <br><br><br>I am hoping that it avoids any other "real world" people and trying to explain why the MC ended up here and instead focuses on them trying to take over the world.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I am hoping that it avoids any other "real world" people and trying to explain why the MC ended up here and instead focuses on them trying to take over the world. <br>Well you're in luck my friend. Keep watching.</br></br>  <br>I thought this was going to be full on comedy. Kind of disappointed that it turned out to be SAO#29321948. I mean, it's better than SAO so far, but this setting is getting really tiresome by now.<br><br>Dark elf onee-san a best girl.</br></br></br>  <br> Dark elf onee-san a best girl. <br>which one?</br></br>  <br>What are the similarities with SAO?</br>  <br>The trap's sister.</br>  <br>Bestus Girlus. A rather rare species in the wild.</br>  <br><br>The MC is dickless, just like Kirito.</br></br>  Narbel? More like Narbest.  <br>He may not have a dick but at least he has a spine</br>  <br> guy stuck in a MMORPG <br>Come on, I'm not trying to say they're similar shows. I'm just saying this setting is getting overused. Even Danmachi sort of does the same thing but with dungeon crawlers instead of MMORPGs, except there's no real world in Danmachi, though there might as well be since everything in their world works like a game.</br></br>  <br>But anon, he  has a boner ohohohohohohhooh skull joke </br>  <br>lel</br>  <br>All D&amp;D nerds know that create dick is a 5th lvl spell so he can most likely use Greater Dragon Dick at max lvl so no worries.</br>  <br>Anybody have webm of papa bones laughing in a spooky manner in the OP?.</br>  <br>fyi this is not Ainz.</br>  I really wish the <br> how can Albedo have sex with Ainz if he has no peenus weenus? <br>meme would die</br></br>  <br>&lt;3</br>  <br> casts Albedo Breaker </br>  <br>Is that Blue Rose</br>  <br><br>Yes, thank you Mr Whales number one porn star.</br></br>  <br>I believe so, yes</br>  <br> meme <br>That is a legitimate question, you fucking redditfag.</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>To be fair you could say the same thing about every slice of life harem out there.<br>It may be because weve gotten used to everything being a slice of life harem but at least the mmorpg shows are kinda new, even if there is one every season.</br></br>  <br>yeah but hearing it 100+ times get's real old.</br>  <br> that is a legitimate question <br>no its fucking not it's a silly joke that gets spammed, and the fact that it get's repeated nearly a dozen times EVERY thread, makes it a meme you fucking moron<br> you fucking redditfag. <br>don't reflect please</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can you answer it though?</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br> At least they fuck before one of them dies. </br>  <br>Do.</br>  So no new chapter this week, instead we get a random crossover with a series nobody reads?  <br>At least Overlord does it in a fresh way<br><br>10 minutes of mmo and then no more screens no more levels hell   the new worlders aren't even aware of the concept of levels and the character sheets for them are just reflections of their skills as opposed to gaining skills from leveling </br></br></br>  <br> _________read the LN__________ </br>  <br> Wish Upon A Star - a Super Rank spell - can give him a penis or artificial human body at any time </br>  <br><br>We are still expecting a new release this Saturday, calm down anon.</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry to tell you but Dio is   a mook  </br>  <br>still says saturday. So unless Sky changes it, should be the same.</br>  I know this would be the Oregairu of the season. I shouldn't have expected any different from you guys. Worst fanbase this season. All that talk only making threads when you have an update on your LN and have something to talk about are all lies.  Post yfw someone tells you they can't wait for Ainz to be a hero and save the world.  La Shub Niggurath when?  <br>Suuuuuure buddy. Keep thinking those happy thoughts.</br>  <br> no new IP number <br>who do you think you're kidding?</br></br>  I want to marry shizu  <br>But Ainz is the greatest hero the world has ever seen whether they like it or not.</br>    <br>Who are you kidding? There is a new IP. Stop lying to yourself.</br>  <br> Worst fanbase this season. <br><br>You came to the wrong neighbourhood motherfucker.</br></br></br>  So the guardians know they were created, but do they know how long ago it actually was? Mare said she was only 70 some years old, but is that from her character setting?  <br><br>What are you talking about, this a novel about happy magicalgirls.</br></br>  <br>Their creation date is probably not their birth date. Like, they joined Nazarick at a certain age, rather than being born into it.</br>  So who would be the best Guardian to live under? Going by personality, it'd probably go like this.<br><br>Sebas=&gt;Cocytus&gt;Pandora Actor&gt;Dark Elf Twins&gt;Albedo&gt;Shalltear&gt;Demiurge<br><br>Didn't include the other two.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Papa Bones needs to impregnate Mare and Aura ASAP</br>  <br>they're too young for that.</br>  <br><br>only one of them is a girl</br></br>  <br> Cocytus in second place <br>He unconsciously releases a freezing aura. You will become an ice block.</br></br>  <br>depends on if you are a monster or not<br><br>If you are a heartless monster Demiurge is bro as fuck, just look at how happy the clown is.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see what the problem is</br>  <br> At least Overlord does it in a fresh way <br>This.<br><br>It's unusual already to have the main character being a wizard rather than a magic swordsman, let alone a fucking lich.<br><br>That already sets this show apart from all similar ones.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> too young <br><br><br>They're both girls if you will it hard enough</br></br></br></br>  <br>i think most people are misguided<br><br>i remember reading some comments on IGN abot how overlord is gonna be another story about a Hero saving people.<br>I love how wrong they are.</br></br></br></br>  <br>he's already been shown he has complete control over that.</br>  <br>He can control that. Plus, he treats the Lizard people he subjugated well. If it was Demiurge, they'd all be in slave camps and experimented on.</br>  <br>You mean like Log Horizon?</br>  <br/>  <br>I love what people think of Demi so far. It ranges from "this guy is up to something" to "he seems like a nice guy".</br>  <br>He's also been shown to be a forgetful person<br><br><br> he treats the Lizard people he subjugated well <br>After first slaughtering them</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course we lie. Why would you think anyone of us would admit this is turning into a general? I mean you have better chances at making us go outside rather than making us say our way of spending free time is bad.</br>  <br>Nah it's more<br> This is guy is definitely up to something <br>and<br> He seems like a pretty cool bro* <br><br> *heteromorphic races only, filthy human need not apply </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's too overtly smart to be blindly loyal like the rest.</br>  <br>I wonder how far they will got with Demis "subtly" in the anime.</br>  <br> draw a boy and a girl <br> call them a girl and a boy <br>Why?</br></br></br>  <br> japan </br>  <br>Shut up you bitch. Overlord is fucking amazing and so different than that fucking log shit.</br>  <br>Will MC remain as a lich and never turn back into a human?</br>  Isn't making generals while saying you're not making generals pretty much the standard modus operandi on /a/? <br><br> When did we get to be so schizophrenic? </br></br>  Next episode should be  heart crushing  right?  <br>I wish people would stop comparing Overlord to SAO and LogH<br><br>To be clear this is a legit fantasy world ala 90's fantasy series, yes it starts with an mmo but that gets dropped like a bad habit. <br><br>Hell at one point a character tries to stab out someone else's eyes and into their brain to kill them instantly because just like in the real world that shit is lethal. It isn't game style "you struck their weak point for massive damage" it's real world "you cut open an artery either they get healing magic or they will bleed out within a minute"<br><br>Ainz and co. just get to obfuscate the fact since they are horrible monstrosities that ignore most forms of damage that don't target their natural weakness.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>A general is like a forced continuation of the previous thread. If the previous managed to hit bump limit, and there was still enough discussion/posting to warrant another thread, then I think it's fine.</br>  <br>Than I see no point in making it a try from an MMO anyway unless it actually uses those mechanics later which would make if like LH.</br>  <br>People trying to find something to shitpost isnt new on /a/.</br>  <br>These aren't generals, anon. I am the OP of last thread and I only linked to the other thread to prove a point.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>A general is when you linked the previous thread for no fucking reason which you guys happily do in the previous threads.</br>  <br>Yes, he did slaughter them. All the guardians would. However he was merciful to them. If it was anyone else sides him or Sebas, the lizards would be slaves. As a ruler, Cocytus is much, much better choice than all the evil guardians.</br>  <br>Get out of my head Charles.</br>  <br>I'm talking about the threads which go on nonstop for weeks, one after the other, where people just won't admit they're having a general. That's pretty much how it seems to work with a lot of anime these days.</br>  <br>Read the novels to see why it really DID have to be an MMORPG setting at the very beginning.</br>  Whoa, stop fighting guys<br><br>We are supposed to be comfy, papa bones would be upset</br></br>  Just done episode watching episode 2<br>Its still slow pace and kinda tiring to keep up with all the info dumps but at least the scene where he flies into the sky and rips off his helmet was majestic as fuck. anyone got a webm of flying scene? </br>  <br>Go back to /v/ you fucking moron. Generals are always a no no on /a/.</br>  <br>He's overly full of himself.<br><br>He's shown he's willing to go against Ainz for the sake of protecting/pleasing Ainz in the long run but at times it feels like a lot of his little plans work on the principle "as long as Ainz doesn't find out he'll be happy with my end result".<br><br>For all we talk of loyalty he goes behind Ainz the most over really dumb shit.<br><br>He should just stick to his true passion carpentry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just tell why. As I see now they havebno fucking reason unless you think meta jokes are a legit reason.</br>  <br> /djt/ </br>  <br>The mmo is important from a world building standpoint<br><br>Very minor spoilers that aren't even relevant to the plot but just stuff that hasnt been revealed yet<br><br>  Everyone that watched the server get shutdown was transported over appearing once every century or so (at least as far as history knows), these people who are strong as fuck compared to the baseline of the world pretty much fucked the natural course of history doing stuff like introducing their games magic system, leaving behind a bunch of weapons and armour that became relics and weapons that protect humanity against monsters, and stuff like another guild hall appearing far away and years after it was emptied becoming a prosperous city  </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>See  and shut up now.</br>  <br>Faggot, I am last OP and I am TELLING you that I linked it to prove a point.</br>  <br>None of that is required for the sake of telling the story.<br><br>You can replace almost every single instance of "wow isn't like the MMO at all" with "wow this isn't like my old world at all" and nothing changes.<br><br>All the old World Class items? Them being relics from the MMO or them being relics from "ye old fantasy land other dimension" don't matter. The difference between how fucking powerful all of Naz and your baseline bumfucks from this world? The fact that's because they're from the MMO reality of Yggdrasil matters even less because even Ainz at this point just basically treats Yggdrasil as any other weird fantasy land and less like an MMO.<br><br>The only thing you get out of the MMO aspect that cannot be replicated with "Ainz and Naz were high tier final bosses of their old world and now are in a world where things are different and they're even higher tier endgame fuckers" is the whole fish out of water thing Ainz goes through with having to adjust to being an overlord for what was previously a mundane game.<br><br>Even that aspect is shat on because it takes him realistically one volume (ignoring his adventuring side projects) to take up the mantle of Overlord and you stop getting funny moments of "the floor guardians treat seriously what was mundane for Ainz" because as seen in Volume 3 Ainz really soul crushingly loved the game and his friends to the point where it might as well of been real to him.<br><br>I don't hate the MMO aspects at all but there's really nothing about Overlord where the story had to be impossible without the constant references to "WOW THAT'S NOT HOW THAT WORKED IN YGGDRASIL ONLINE".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Draw a pipe <br> Call it not a pipe <br>Why?</br></br></br>  <br>Those mexicans sure are a funny bunch.</br>  <br>Just like every other general. You don't have to defend it. We all know how much you crossboarders like to make generals.</br>  <br>Okay then kiddo.</br>  <br> All the old World Class items? Them being relics from the MMO or them being relics from "ye old fantasy land other dimension" don't matter. <br>Did you even read the story? The issue isn't only that there were relics from the game. It's the fact that people came along with those relics. Obviously, the author wanted to take people from the "real" world, future Earth to be exact, and bring them to a new fantasy world. Without Yggdrasil, what are the odds that everyone transported would have been conveniently holding items strong enough to game changers in the New World? You'd be sitting there going "No, that's too forced".</br></br>  <br> spoiler <br><br>If you think that's cool, check this out. It's basically a novel-length-length bit of writefaggotry from /tg/ about a similar concept.<br><br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/archive/17586304<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/archive/17611378<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/archive/17632664<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/archive/17648894<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/archive/17663235<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/archive/17670989<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/archive/17685424<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/archive/17705159<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/archive/17717365<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/archive/17732681<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/archive/17751162<br><br>I've been meaning to pastebin these up for easier access because I thought it'd go down well in Overlord threads, but oh well.</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, you won't. You could have a world setting exactly like Yggdrasil even without making it an MMO. Making it an MMO is just more convenient and have nothing to do with the story at all. It's just an easy way for the author to introduce something without him having to actually explain more in depth. Log Horizon on the other hand actually uses the MMO setting to its fullest without making it look stupid.</br>  <br> Log Horizon  <br>I see. This is where I get off your ride. Looks like you are just disgruntled that there's another concept like your precious LH.</br></br>  <br>  It's the fact that people came along with those relics. Obviously, the author wanted to take people from the "real" world, future Earth to be exact, and bring them to a new fantasy world. Without Yggdrasil, what are the odds that everyone transported would have been conveniently holding items strong enough to game changers in the New World? <br><br>No it's not. Again you can replace Yggdrasil with any other non MMO fantasy setting and have a bunch of random fucks get dropped into fantasy setting B and it produces the exact same effect. The likelihood of all the beings transported having a World Class item does not change when you replace "only a handful of MMO players had these items" with "only a handful of random fucks from this world had these items". What are the odds that a random Yggdrasil player had a World Class item on them when they got brought over? As much as the above random fuck having a World Class item from separate but equal generic fantasy location. There's absolutely zero difference in the implications behind having those items if you swap where they're from.<br><br>Even the "real" world shit has not mattered. What sweeping technological advancements and ways of thinking were brought over from people in the real world you played an MMO who then got transported that you couldn't achieve by cutting the MMO middleman? The creation of a fucking rubik's cube that's what. <br><br>World Class items, other "players", the differences between the two worlds, and all that other shit. The need to have a separate world from which to pour all that into this one yes. But it doesn't have to be an MMO.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I love how wrong they are. <br>B-but Momon is hero, that saves people.</br></br>  Look children. TITS!  <br>It isn't even a different concept. Overlord literally uses its MMO setting because it's just convenient and the author doesn't need to come up stuff on his own.</br>  <br>Oh but it's not forced that every single implied player transported over was a max level world class player who happened to have a world class item on them?</br>  <br>I guess we'll just agree to disagree then because I still think Yggdrasil was the best way to get people into the new world. The author obviously wanted to go that route. I don't see any reason to complain about how he wrote his story, I just enjoy it.</br>  <br>Nah it's not hate, just dislike of each others views. Same how Yuri and Shalltear don't get along.</br>  Look at the tits children. Jingle jingle jingle  <br> Log Horizon on the other hand actually uses the MMO setting to its fullest without making it look stupid. <br>muh space vampires<br>muh shitty secondary annoying and boring as hell child characters taking up 5 episodes discovering the power of friendship</br></br></br>  <br>And it doesn't make you wonder just how that happened? At all?<br><br>Alright then.</br></br></br>  <br> agree to disagree <br> I just enjoy it. <br><br>I refuted your points about why it having the MMO element is vital to the story's structure and you can't give a single reason why but yeah let's just mindlessly enjoy anything thrown at us without criticism we've clearly reached a standstill.</br></br></br></br>  Jingle jingle  <br>You don't like character development? The children episode is one the best episode in that season.</br>  Only one more day left. Are you ready?  <br>I can hardly wait.</br>  <br>Kaede at any age is perfect for me. In fact, I'll take all of them.</br>  <br><br><br>Is NBR mom incest okay?</br></br></br>  <br>Most likely, they have very little reason not to now that Anya was made that way.</br>  <br>JK Kaede you say?</br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>http://bitlasers.com/djt<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128152<wbr>432/</wbr></br></br></br></br>  なるべく諦めない！<br>なせば大抵なんとかなる！<br><br>As long as you never give up and you keep pushing to better yourself, you'll make it no matter what. You CAN learn Japanese!</br></br></br>  <br><br>How do you go from a sentence full of words you don't know to understanding most of the words without flashcards?</br></br>  zoi  Am I losing anything by not having sentence audio on my cards? I have point audio, but sentence audio feels like it takes too long.  <br>I took the sentence audio out. It's distracting and I almost never listen to it anyways.</br>  <br>I just do? I think maybe you underestimate the power of your own memory. Anki is hardly required to learn. That said I rarely run into a sentence with more than 2 words I don't know. For example, if I read a chapter of manga, it's not uncommon that I don't even have to look a word at all in that chapter. Keep in mind, I dropped anki after knowing around 4000 words. I don't know if it would be really hard to do it without anki from the get go.</br>  <br>Not needed, sentence isn't needed either. The sentences are shit anyway.</br>   set reviews to 9999 <br> have 700 to do </br>  <br>By reading more. Getting from knowing 15% of words to 90% of words is the easiest part to do without flashcards. It's the range from 90-99 or so that's really hard without flashcards.</br>  so in the last thread i asked for advice some guy apparently gave bad advice so whats a good place to start at? currently im listening to japanesepod101 anyone use it before or comment on if its a good way to learn?  <br>Japanesepod is great. You might also be interested in rosetta stone and pimsleur</br>    <br>Yep. Hardest part is the shit that is just really uncommon that I don't see again for like 6 months or more. But, I'm happy if I can at least recognize that I had seen it before.</br>  <br>ねええぞいちゃん<br>俺のちん◯を触ってくれｗ(*´∀｀*)</br></br>  <br>Shitposting is shitposting even if it's in Japanese, go back to /b/</br>  <br>エッチ！</br>  <br>無礼</br>  <br>i dont know if youre serious i heard rosetta stone was terrible</br>  Hey guys i read the guide and i think i'm doing pretty good. Today I learned Hiragana, Katakana, and about 20 kanjis. I think i have a pretty good start. What do you recommend I do tommorow?   learn hangul <br> learn the word for Korea in Korean <br> literally hangook <br> gook <br><br>Now I see.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I recommend you read the guide again.</br>  <br>Totally serious, rosetta stone is legit, people shitting on it are baiting, and the guide was written to intimidate new people to keep the thread as a secrit club.</br>  I've been reading about tulpas again and they amaze me. I haven't heard about them in years but you can control your brain to do anything. They cuck themselves into schizophrenia but Iam only going to be happy and positive.<br><br>It so beautiful that one day I will know Japanese. Something that I never thought could be possible is going to happen one day :)</br></br>  For those you who want to have kids will you encourage them to learn other languages? I wish my parents did. They knew how much I was obsessed with anime from a young age and yet they did nothing. If I ever have kids I'll support their interest and direct them the right way.  <br><br><br><br>See <br><br>You literally just learn the kana and then do a vocab deck in Anki (the one in the Anki startup bin is recommended for starters) while you go through one of those grammar guides (and RTK if you want) and then read. If you still have an issue with grammar after that, there's other resources like the DoJG (and the deck) and other grammar textbooks.<br><br>The guide is just really fucking bloated for something aimed towards beginners. Should be trimmed down a bunch to make it less wordy, and split the resources/FAQ into their own docs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>makes sense considering a lot of these threads seems like a giant circlejerk</br>  <br>;)<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qmn<wbr>lSDk7KzY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Where can I subscribe?</br>  <br>ok cool thanks man ill definitely check that out</br>  <br><br><br>I read the guide pretty well Haha. It took me about 2 hours but i finally got both hiragana and katakana. it took 10 minutes for the 20 kanjis to learn. It's easy haha. I'll be done in a few months at this rate :)</br></br></br>  <br>This bitch is so retarded</br>  <br>Haha, maybe you should read it again, haha. Haha, a few months you say? Haha, we'll see about that, haha. :^)</br>  <br>I bet you don't know why Americans started calling them gooks.<br>You uneducated negro.</br></br>  <br>What's this supposed to mean? I only watched 3 mins but I'm just saying if my kid was into Japanese stuff I'd encourage him to learn more about it if they wanted to is all.</br>  <br> The guide is just really fucking bloated for something aimed towards beginners. Should be trimmed down a bunch to make it less wordy, and split the resources/FAQ into their own docs. <br>It's fine, I got started using that guide and it helped me a lot, gives a good overview of all non-retarded options without railroading people into a single method they might not like. <br>I doubt people that don't have attention span enough to read that guide can somehow learn a language, anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't like the idea of giving new people options.</br>  <br>I'm never going to watch 11 minutes of that but I assume trying to raise a child with 2 languages could be hard and confusing for him so it's understandable to only start with the language of the country he's going to live in <br>Then when he goes to middle school he could be helped by the native parent at learning English, surely that is what she is going to do</br></br>  <br>Kids absorb languages like fucking sponges. They have absolutely no problem being raised in two languages. That's what makes her opinion so ridiculous. Knowing English in Japan is such a huge advantage that not teaching her kids English just by fucking using the language normally is just plain retarded.</br>  <br><br>Being American, and being around friends who have grown up speaking both English and their native language, I can assure you that it's not only possible to do it but extremely easy. <br><br>My friends speak their native language less fluently than they speak English, despite speaking nothing but their native language at home and on family outings.<br><br><br><br>This.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A lot of people raise their kids to be bilingual, it's just going to take a few months longer before they start to talk, starting learning English in school is going to be a lot harder and confusing.</br>  <br>I listened to it.<br>It boils down to.<br><br>I don't want to teach my children English.<br>I have that decision as a mom<br>Respect my decision<br>Don't say mean things about my poor decision in life<br>Saying English is the most useful language is offensive to other language learning<br><br><br>Its a video based on feels and woman liberal logic. I recommend leaving it on to listen once because I couldn't wait that ugly beaver bitch</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At the start he's going to speak a bastard mix of Japanese and English like my grandpa was doing with my native and French after he went to fight for the FFL</br>  <br> trying to raise a child with 2 languages could be hard and confusing for him <br>Not really, I grew up learning 2 languages and it was pretty effortless.</br></br>  <br>People can tell the difference when the people around them aren't saying certain words. We can adapt to nearly any social situation as humans</br>    <br>All babies say stupid shit at the start so it doesn't matter in the slightest.</br>  Is anyone using Memorise? Don't have anki on my phone.  <br>Memorise...</br>  <br><br>But only one of those can be construed as "liberal", and even then you need to use the really stupid American definition for it work?</br></br>  <br>Memorise?</br>  <br><br>*Memrise</br></br>  So should I work on a RTK kanji deck or KD for Kanji? Or both at the same time? is that a good idea anyways?<br><br>What do you guys recommend for starters? Im doing nothing this whole summer so I have fuck loads of time. I have Kana down btw. I plan on working on the 2k/6k core vocab deck and Tae Kim/Genki for grammar.</br></br>  <br> Memerise </br>  <br> Or both at the same time? <br>That's a really bad idea, chose one. Compare the first few cards in a deck and choose the one you like most.</br></br>  <br>Yes and no<br>From personal experience it depends on the kid and both parents. if you teach them language A only but the school teaches them language B then it becomes a problem.</br></br>  <br>I just basterdize the word liberal to mean doing retarded things that should be accepted by others and not vilified.<br><br>Slut <br>Fat acceptance<br>Bug chasing<br>Drug abuse for recreation<br>Not working<br><br>All behavior that should be called out that fits in the left wing liberal garbage mindset.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Drug abuse for recreation <br>I understand everything else, but what's wrong with that?</br></br>  <br>Mods can't read japanese though.</br>  I've been trying to get to the CoR for the past few days but my connection keeps timing out. Is anyone else having this issue or am I just an idiot?   At what level should I open up a manga? <br><br>I'm going to do what most people do and start with Yotsuba.

No  <br>So is Megu-nee basically MC's common sense kicking into overdrive</br>  They're pretty good.<br>But Mii-kun is bestest.</br>  All of them are best girls  Which girl has the best suffering face?  <br>I'm more of a Yuki kind of guy, but shovel's nice</br>  STANDING ON THE EDGE<br><br> yes<br/> </br></br>  <br>I hoped her eyepatch would be permanent.<br><br>I also liked it better when it was just bandages wrapped around her eye.</br></br></br>  I love Mii-kun.  <br>Kurumi, definitely</br>  <br><br>Rii, no question.</br></br>  <br>Thanks for nothing faggot. Now this one is gonna be full of rewarded shipping/best girl wars</br>  Calling it now, when that dog gets the shovel Miki is gonna be the one to give it.  <br>I live for shovel</br>  <br>Kurumi hits every single one of my preferences perfectly. I can't think of a single way she could be improved.</br>  <br>Rii takes the cake in that regard</br>  For you longtime manga readers, how long do you usually wait for translations after each release?  <br>Not being a slut.</br>  The best!  <br>Too long.</br>  Is it any surprise that the best girls are also the most competent ones?  What are these sticks?  <br>Pretty long but I think we're caught up. At least in terms of raws on the internet.<br><br>I don't know if 37 is the last one that's been released but I highly doubt it.</br></br></br>  <br> shovel with pantyhose <br> the crossed legs <br><br>damn.</br></br></br></br>  fuck i wanna repopulate the earth with shovel  They only have 1 person with any sort of weapon. How did they even survive until now?  <br>Who doesn't.</br>  <br>I want to do that with all the girls,  except for Rii-san because she is worst girl. </br>    <br><br>I'm sorry anon, you can't have kids with a zombie</br></br>  SLUT  <br>Umaibo I think</br>      <br>i never thought i could love the look of despair so much</br>  <br>I think this is a better one for Miki</br>  <br>Yes, it has been, I believe most of us have already read it here. Some kind anon took time to translate it for us.</br>  <br><br>It is strange that they don't all at least carry a baseball bat.</br></br>  <br>I am in love with her.</br>    <br>Interesting. Tell me more.</br>  <br>Too bad she doesn't love you because she's a filthy slut.</br>  <br>She only had a crush on one guy and he's dead now.</br>  <br>She killed him later so it was all good in the end.</br>  <br>Looks like the same shit this bitch likes to eat. Based only on the appearance and sound I think it's like one big cheetos.</br>  <br>I want to squeeze Rii's Riis.</br>  <br><br>But my favourite one is better than the others.</br></br>  <br>Legitimately lazily dark bullshit, as expected of 2ch. Die suki wouldn't even translate into "I want to die", but something like "I like die"? It's just the anon putting DIE in place of DAI because loldark bait and switch! Even though the bait and switch stuff is a very small focus of the series.</br>    <br><br>I want to squeeze Rii's  bears </br></br>  <br>Who are they looking at?</br>  <br>You can't know how much he used her. After all, they were alone there.</br>  <br>Because she had a crush on a boy?<br>A boy she was forced to kill?<br>To kill the one she loved?<br>Epic meme. She's a better person than you and I would love her forever,. She's been through more shit that your neckbeard has ever seen. <br>You sound like a virgin.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking  pedo </br>  <br>You.</br>  <br> Rii's   bears <br> sexualizing Ruu </br></br>  <br> Justifying liking a slut <br>Are you by chance a cuck?</br></br>  I want to eat umaibo with the Gurashis.  <br>No but she's very close to the best girl.<br><br><br>Shit taste.</br></br></br></br>  when will the fucking dog die? Are they like waiting to kill it off or is it going to live?  <br>She kind of looks like a Nagisa rip-off.</br>  <br>It's already dead</br>  Just finished what's up in the manga so far.<br><br>Needless to say, It was incredibly underwhelming. Hopefully the adaptation will make it seem less shitty.</br></br>  <br>This scene was cute and funny.</br>  When will the zombies storm the building?  <br>Episode 3 or 4</br>  <br>Muh shock value. I hate how they introduced Mii-kun from the start, the manga had a beautiful feeling of loneliness with nobody, but the three girls. I won't even mention the fucking dog, he is a disgrace.</br>  <br>When the helicopter explodes.</br>  10/10 episode again.<br><br>But ugh the censoring.<br><br>I hope later episodes where Kurumi goes berserk will have less black-smoke censoring.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wow a /b/ meme. <br>How is your first week here, do you feel like a official member of 4chan yet?</br></br>  <br> black-smoke censoring. <br>I'm not sure it's censoring, the zombies are pretty much always silhouettes in the Manga</br></br>  <br> I like die <br><br>Why do I have a feeling that a line from some Jpop song?</br></br></br>  When is Miki going to marry shovel?  <br><br>Stop replying to him dangit</br></br>  <br>Man, I was freaking out at that chapter. <br>Shovel thrashing under the blanket? That's just good storytelling right there.</br></br>  <br>Is wasn't a censor. If you noticed the fog cleared up when she saw the picture of the girl before she turned. It was to emphasize that Shovel didn't see the zombies as human or at least was trying not to view them as human.</br>  <br> /b/meme <br>Not really. /b/ level maybe but I'm pretty sure it isn't from there.</br></br>  <br>Well, with the way artists use English, it probably is.</br>  <br> Soon </br>  <br>100% agree but not much you can do about that now</br>  Where are you all reading the manga? I've only seen episode one f the anime but I want to join the train.  <br> Panel just for interlocking fingers <br>Not yuri they said.</br></br>  <br>Lewd<br><br>Also I hope crossbow-kun makes a return.

The mangaka probably let popularity get to their head.</br>  I want to snuggle with Shovel-chan and tell her everything will be okay.<br> ;_; </br>  <br>Mangaka's working on the anime as the script writer. The anime is his work too.</br>  <br>I dont think that Shovel needs your comfort. She's tough as nail.</br>  <br>I want to hug her and tell her  I know you're a slut. How much? </br>  <br>It's been great so far. Probably because the unique feeling of not having any characters besides the main cast.

Interpreting it as gay is really not giving the scene the respect it deserves. Miki was concerned a close friend was going to basically up and kill herself (something that she's been worried about for a while), and that friend tries to reassure her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kojima is Diejoubu. <br>Fuck Konami on this, really.</br></br>  <br>There's only one scanlator working on this series, deel, abs he does a fairly good job. He recently posted in his blog that he's in a trip in Japan and he won't be back until next month. Before he left, translations were two chapters behind and the only available scans are either in gook or chink, so a kind  cocky  native gook gave us translations of the latest two chapters and posted them a few days ago and another anon did the typesetting. <br><br>TL;DR the only good scans available are from deel, as for the latest chapters you'll either have to wait until.next month or read shitty gook translated scans</br></br></br>    What is Kurumi's best affectation? <br><br> It's the shovel isn't it? </br></br>  <br>Well, at least someone knows what the job of a director is.</br>    <br>I like her gloves</br>  <br>I'm seeing two or three different ones.<br><br><br>Cool. Does anyone have download links for deel?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Deel has only translated the latter half of the series. Prior to that it was the territory of a few other worse groups, but whatever.<br><br>The point is, there's no need to explain it. Batoto only has one version of each chapter anyway. If a series on Batoto has two versions you can check the scans yourself and quickly determine which of the two versions is better.</br></br></br>  <br>Affectation? Zombie disease</br>  <br> &gt;I'm seeing two or three different ones. <br>What in the fuck?

So she got a little flesh wound and caught a fever and now her hand is a bit chilly and the zomboids don't fuck with her. Seems fine to me.</br>  <br><br>I kno she's dead in the manga but since the dog is alive in the anime no way to see that the teacher could be alive in the anime just because no other character has addressed her directly besides yuki doesn't mean she's dead</br></br>  <br>Why'd you flip Miki? It's clearly backwards since you can see the backwards hiragana in the image.</br>  <br>I wouldn't mind as much if it was Rii, but fucking best girl is slowly walking to oblivion, and there's nothing I could do about it.</br>  <br>You answer your own question. <br> Yuki, stop you need to accept that she's dead. </br></br>   liking infected people <br><br>NO</br></br>  <br>A few threads a go some anons were convinced that she was going to commit suicide because there were multiple "flags" <br><br>it's bullshit really, most reasonable is that she's a special hybrid zombie human I don't think she will turn back</br></br></br>  <br>They're down on her because she is a slut and is tainting the purity of the group with her slutiness.</br>  Copypasta from the other thread<br><br>http://pastebin.com/xKr64Qre<br>http://pastebin.com/8rz8gEUM<br>http://pastebin.com/hgr2a3ZL<br><br>From the third link<br> Alternatively, widespread infection may lead to mutation, and different versions may appear. <br><br> There is still some hope Shovel will end up being ÜberShovel </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Let it go m8</br>  <br><br>That's probably going to be the end of the anime.</br></br>  <br>The semi-infected will inherit the earth.

Be grateful we still have Teekyuu.</br>  <br>Do you not count Second Stage as S3?</br>  <br>reading this manga makes me feel so stupid because I fall for every goddamn trick in the book. I mean, it was so goddamn obvious she's not real. I don't even need to re-read the manga but I was still thinking "wait, is she real or not, I can't tell"<br><br><br>where did it say she had zombie meds?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't give a fuck about that bitch but this 100% proves that megu-nee is alive in the anime as her plate is full and not a fake pity pretend plate like that bear bitch got</br></br>  <br> /a/ complains when shows explain things to them <br> /a/ complains when shows don't explain anything and leave it up to you to figure things out. <br>/a/ is retarded</br></br></br>  <br>see<br><br>and get out of denial</br></br></br>  <br>she was in a secure bunker, how the fuck would she of gotten bitten?</br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>I've always been under the impression that Kurumi's medicine might have been slightly different from Radio-chan's and pilot-kun's since it's company issued to the school. Maybe the company has loads of strains of vaccine to test out all over the place</br>  <br>Maybe she got bit on the way to the bunker?</br>  <br>kurumi's plate is empty does that mean she's not real either?</br>  <br>if she got bit on the way then she must've gotten medicine they girls hear the radio and we see her making broadcasts for awhile and kurumi almost turned into a zombie within 24hours of getting bitten</br>  <br>/a/ is  several people </br>  <br>Rats</br>  Going to start reading the manga, do I need to read the first few chapters or have the first 2 episodes of the anime covered enough?  <br>well, yeah, she's not a real human  anymore </br>  Shit, I did not expect her to be alive at all, especially with how the author had been hitting us with so many "maybe they can save someone" close calls lately.  inb4 she's bitten   <br>And most of them retarded.</br>  <br>You bet I can fap to this.</br>  <br>Listen bud, nobody cares what you think. So after next episode or the one after that when they reveal it and you start flipping your shit don't start bitching because we told you so.</br>  <br>Even in a bunker she would need to make supply runs<br><br><br>then why did kurumi stay alive with only one dose?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mi-kun is not with them at the beggining in the manga</br>  <br>no the first 15 or some chapters don't even have miki in them</br>  <br>Read the thread ffs<br/></br>  <br><br> That OP change <br><br>AOTYAY</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought she killed herself out of depression</br>  <br> alive <br>You're a funny guy, anon</br></br>  <br>Now I'm sad, I like shovel.</br>  <br>yfw ruu-chan wins da superb owl</br>  <br>Why is she so sexy?</br>  <br>She offed herself because she was bit and didn't want to turn</br>  <br> then why did kurumi stay alive with only one dose? <br><br>that's the main question I have <br><br>most anons in previous threads explain that away with the fact that either kurumi is some sort of special hybrid zombie or like  some other medicine <br><br>or simply we have no idea how long radio-chan's been in there maybe the medicine only works for a limited amount of time and kurumi is still at risk or turning</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did she kill herself? I thought her zombie was making noise in the other room still.</br>  <br>if you saw the note she wrote it's pretty obvious she was turning and tried to kill herself in the closet but failed or succeeded either way she's turned and locked in a closet when the girls find her</br>  <br><br>no, she was turning and locked herself in another room. They heard her making zombie noises and kurumi killed her offscreen with the shovel, that's why in the next scene it's covered in blood<br><br><br>what evidence do we have that the medicine is only temporary?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It hasn't been that long since Kurumi was bit in story, maybe a week or 2 at most. My guess is Radio was bit at the start of the outbreak some months ago, and has been going through her medicine. I bet Kurumi's gonna relapse while they're in the University.</br>  <br>She turned. Kurumi goes to "say goodbye" after they find her note in the bunker and she comes back covered in blood.</br>  I really want a flashback episode dedicated to miki's mall time with the 11 others, after many attempts I still have no idea what happened with the guy on fire and everyone else hopefully the anime could clarify that  <br>She tried to off herself, and failed. Sorry.</br>  <br>That's what happened. She tried but failed.</br>  <br>The anime isn't gonna touch Miki's time at the mall imo. They could flash back to it, but it would feel out of place.</br>  <br>we don't have any evidence but it's kind of hard otherwise to explain how radio chan got bit in her bunker<br><br><br>yea that's what I always thought anons keep saying the zombies not noticing her and her being cold is signs that she's some sort of hybrid but to me it's clear that she's slowly turning, like maybe the meds only slows down the turning processes</br></br></br></br>  <br>They will touch it, Kei it's in the opening. They will probably do it quick, but they will touch it.</br>  The anime arty style is ugly, especially the eyes. The characters look so lifeless compared to the manga.  <br> guy turns into zombie <br> bites drunk, sleeping people who also turn <br> someone pushes him onto the campfire when he tries to bite them, he goes up in flames <br> Panic ensues </br></br></br></br>  <br>yea they did very briefly mention it at the start of this ep but I feel like they are most likely going to brush past it since they already have miki introduced from ep 1</br>  <br>At most I could see it happening as a sort of internal monologue thing where miki thinks back to what happened at the mall. It covers the incident with that group of survivors and ends with Yuki and the gang saving her.</br>  <br>there's a lot of explanations similar but we aren't shown anything besides guy is bit everyone drunk and then all of a sudden guy on fire everyone else awol</br>  Has anyone explained how Shovel's senpai got infected without her noticing and without getting infected herself? Or is it impossible to explain without knowing how the outbreak first happened?  <br>They all turn since there was a group of zambies behind the barricade they set up when Yuki and the others get there.</br>  <br>The anime doesn't have the benefit of being stills, and having a month's time to make. Deal with it.</br>  <br>meh it's not too difficult to imagine what happened, and it's not that important anyway</br>  <br>The anime covers that poorly. That scene takes place at the very beginning of the outbreak, Megu-nee, the girls, and Senpai run to the roof but apparently Senpai was bit and turns. This is before anyone knows that being bit = turning.</br>  <br>It's as you say, we have no way of knowing.</br>  <br> The characters look so lifeless <br>Isn't that the point?</br></br>  <br>If you read the manga it's easier to figure out an explanation. In the anime, the two of them are all alone and he suddenly tuns; in the manga, the two of them are on the roof along with Yuki, Rii, and Megu and the outbreak has just, well, broke. They're holding back the horde at a door and suddenly Kurumi's senpai turns. Considering the outbreak has been ongoing for a few minutes/hours, he was probably bitten early on.</br>  <br>Different strains, starting one was an airborne infection, much like a flu. After that it mutated</br>  <br>Also, you have to remember that it was a dream sequence so what we saw isn't exactly what may have went down.</br>  <br> Different strains, starting one was an airborne infection, much like a flu. After that it mutated <br>Then why isn't the airborne one still around infecting the girls? Or are you implying that literally everyone who was infected before senpai also had their infections mutate?</br></br>  <br>Nothing has implied any of it's airborne. If anything it's liquid/contact.</br>  I'm in love with Rii-san.<br><br>I want to hold her and keep her from snapping.</br></br>    <br> Too late </br>  <br><br>Yeah, my bad, from the extras http://pastebin.com/hgr2a3ZL<br><br>I assume alpha strain was the most infectious one, which showed less symptoms, then mutates into beta, causing deaths and finally omega strain which I suppose makes people actually become zombies<br><br> Alpha strain: <br> Wide range infection type. Using XXX &gt;mushrooms as a base, the infectivity and range &gt;increased. Symptoms include fever, sweating, &gt;and nausea. <br> Incubation period is 3-6 days. Infection through &gt;contact, liquids, and blood. <br> Lethality is low but when not given medical &gt;treatment, weakness followed by death may &gt;occur. <br> Taking into account the incubation period, you &gt;should put these people in quarantine for 10 &gt;days. <br> Be careful of infection (wear airtight clothes if &gt;available), and use the alpha mark first-aid kit. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Those Academy kids just don't sit right with me something is clearly up.<br>And did anyone notice that the  Bear  wasn't in any of the later pages of Ch 37</br>  <br>What are you talking about? The  bear  is always there</br>  <br>that's what I've been saying no way that gate and the presence of 3 normal girls scares away those men with the crossbow <br><br>there must be something else</br></br></br>  <br> those men with the crossbow <br>I thought the guys with the motorcycle helmets weren't the same people as crossbowguy.</br></br>  <br>We're only seeing the event through Kurumi's dream. It's not a proper flashback.</br>  <br>Guy just knocked over a candle in his sleep due to seizures<br><br>You can imagine it up from there</br></br></br>  <br>There's 2 possibilities in my mind. Either the Guys in the car were trying to warn them about the college (nice job doing that by running at them with baseball bats) or they're in cohoots with the college girls and staged that to get the girls into the college and make them trust the Uni girls (but then why did crossbow chase them out in the first place?)</br>  <br>They are homosexuals and don't want girls ruining their paradise.</br>  <br>I have a feeling that the University girls are going to try and use them to kill the University boys.<br>Never trust characters that have sunshine'd glasses.</br></br>  <br>yeah but knocking over a candle doesnt turn you into an inferno</br>  <br>The zombie virus makes you a nigger. No wonder the whole city became hell on earth.</br>  Why did they stop using baseball bats after the helicopter incident? They shouldn't only rely on a single shovel for self-defense.  <br>Zombies are canonically very flammable.</br>  <br> tfw shined glasses cant happen in real life </br>  <br>It does if there's open and spilled liquor everywhere</br>  <br>Yea I think the trap angle is most likely, I'm guessing crossbow man is just a rouge agent, after all it is a college it's supposed to be large it is not out of the question that there are a few small bands of survivors on campus</br>  <br>So you think the College has factions? Or ran by some would be dean who kills anyone that doesn't do what he/she says?</br>  <br> Ch 37 <br><br>Isn't 35 the newest one?</br></br></br>  <br>dude translated 36 and 37 in one of the threads a couple of days ago.</br>  <br>I would really like it if it turned out that they're both bad groups.<br><br>College with girls has a bunch of dark secrets.<br><br>Bikers are violent, paranoid, and generally unstable.<br><br>I mean seriously, if they wanted to just talk coming at Kurumi and Miki with weapons is beyond retarded. They also chased the girls on foot and in a car. What the fuck<br><br>And, of course, the crossbow sentry really didn't look so good and was having NONE of it with the girls.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh you're behind, aren't you?<br>Archive, my friend</br></br>  <br>The reason paranoid crossbower shot at them because everyone didn't drop their stuff when he said</br>  <br><br>Well, fuck. Thanks.</br></br>  <br> and was having NONE of it with the girls. <br>But why would he shoot at a  teddybear ?</br></br>  <br>Anytime champ</br>  <br>Crossbow dude just looked nervous and scared more than anything. The biker dudes probably thought Miki and Kurumi were pals with the Uni people, but might have realized it wasn't the case when they saw the car they got in.<br><br>I hope both groups are "bad" and "good" in their own ways, they all die to zombies and survival continues. If the manga turns into TWD, I'm done.</br></br></br>  <br>Considering what you just describe of the first two groups. Could you blame the crossbow guy for being on edge?</br>  <br> The reason paranoid crossbower shot at them because <br>And if the girls in the college are the boy's enemies, he could have suspected that the younger girls were working with them.</br></br>  Uni girls  are cannibals <br>Helmet guys  are the good guys <br>Crossbow-kun  is beta </br></br>  <br>Because fuck the  burrs  man. I'm telling you, this whole virus spread because of the  burrs  or the author has some pent up phobia of  burrs <br>Bet your ass the people on rabbit island are fine. And you know why? Because there's no  bears </br></br>  <br>Kurumi is the only good fighter. Fleeing is the better option for almost all of them. No fast zombies, so this is fine.<br><br><br>Rii was just holding a teddybear.<br><br><br>The possibility of a TWD zombie politics scenario is too high and I'm really worried. I want them to leave already.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought about the cannibal angle too but then again the university is marked as a survival shelter place like the high school so there would have to be abundant supplies esp when you consider a university is much larger than a high school</br>  <br>You can hide stuff inside teddy bears, you just need to get rid of the cotton.</br>  <br>DOUBLE SECRET PROBATION</br>  <br> Rii was just holding a teddybear. <br>Yeah. That's what I meant. He told everyone to drop their stuff and Rii didn't.</br></br>  Crossbow-kun is a genuinely nice guy. He could have shot to kill Rii, but he just tried to disarm her.  <br>There's a lot of supplies, until one group takes over all the supplies. The other group gets desperate.</br>   yfw when they enter the uni and find old ugly fat men waiting for them <br> yfw the uni girls said "you want security and protection in here? offer all of your bodies to them, mate" </br>  Where can I read chapter 36 and 37?  <br>shit you think she picked up the gun that miki threw off the roof and hid it in the bear?</br>  <br> but he just tried to disarm her. <br>Something, something right to bear arms.</br></br>  <br>So he's paranoid! He thought it was a bomb or something?</br>  <br>Why wouldn't he say "drop the bear" or something like that. He just shot. He was obviously out for blood.</br>  <br> Crossbow-kun becomes Rii's love interest. <br>   She gives up because her "sister" seems interested in him too. </br></br>  <br>but as far as we know the girls control the university if anything motorcycle helmets is the cannibals</br>  <br>...no</br>  Do you think they were hinting that the dog was dead and that it was a ghost when the dog had on the triangular headband?  <br>Lurk some more anon, it's been posted in practically every GG thread past few days.</br>  <br>Uni girls  are infected like Kurumi <br>Helmet guys  are violent, possibly well-meaning idiots <br>Crossbow-kun  is indeed beta </br></br></br>  <br>Yes.

The drag created by him simply hanging there makes it impossible for the combined weight to remain in flight.<br><br>I also don't care about it, since it's cute and amusing. You should learn to not let things like this spoil something that is, by every other metric, silly and impossible to begin with.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Not nearly as frustrating as trying to get one to join you in Dragon Quest 5.</br></br>  Why is Lala so cute`?  <br>Considering something like an eagle can carry off a sheep, its really not that big of a stretch.</br>  <br>Lillith and Draco have weak-ass babby wings that aren't even their primary forelimbs.

Her complete body does, even chest.</br>  <br>she also has like 6 nips</br>  Y'all niggas ain't worthy of best girl  <br>No she just needed to know he gets hard when fondling boob.<br><br>So, about two inches?</br></br></br>    Polt has her whole body full off fur....<br>how is she not a furry</br>  <br> , dudes probably hung like Cerea <br>but cerea is a girl...</br></br>  <br>She's also a Kobold, therefore she's still a monster girl, I don't think Kobold count as animals, well, I'm not a furry, I like Polt because of her personnality and   ass   , and it's probably the same for most Poltfag, when you like Rachne, you like her femdom traits or whatever, not because you want to fuck her spider butt, I hope.</br>  <br>nope<br>I'd like to fuck her spiderbutt</br></br>  <br>Oh well, fuck the spiderbutt then.</br>  <br>Will someone commission a picture of Polt shaving allready?</br>  <br>And how is that relevant?<br>Also, she doesn't have brain damage, she has a healthy brain for a harpy. And being like childish and innocent is a huge plus, and a huge turn on, faggot.</br></br>  <br>You only need to keep her from walking by herself and that's a problem solved</br>  <br>if I could I would</br>  <br>Dude NICE</br>  OY!<br>OY!<br>OY!</br></br>  <br>I want that, I need that.</br>  <br>Why that faggot never treats Papi as a girl while he is flustered with everyone?</br>  <br>Yeah, maybe for you, paedophile.</br>  how smart would papi bee if they confined her to a wheelchair for a week?  <br>she is 18</br>  <br>Why would that-<br>What</br></br>  <br>Papi isn't a girl, she's a child.</br>  Tiny snek  <br>see panel 3<br/></br>  <br> posting on /a/ <br> not a pedo </br></br>  <br>That is if rolling around doesn't count as steps.<br><br><br>She is not though</br></br></br></br>  buyfag.moe  first    Second for being Canadian sucks.  Phat!'s Anastasia  <br><br>I'm the only one who fucking hates that Phat! is making those scale 100% like the source pics? They don't translate well into 3D, fucking stop.

Hibiki/Iori/Miki/Takane/Azusa all look fine. It's only Yayoi's face and maybe Makoto that's an issue.</br>  <br>Stop using emoticon.</br>  Are there any loli-loving Canadians that want to share their experiences so I'm less paranoid?  <br><br>Sayonara wallet.</br></br>  <br>that figure doesnt do azusa justice. Why did they have to use the DVD covers?<br><br> new im@s line when? ;_; </br></br></br>  <br> saggy grandma breasts in a baggy sweater </br>  <br>I had a feeling the art wouldn't translate well and it didn't.<br>She looks absolutely retarded, in the source she's looking upwards to you.<br>Here she looks like shes happy about a headache and she's about to fall over, looking at nothing in particular.<br><br>Anya looks beautiful, will PO.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what from I've seen<br><br>1. one guy fled the country and ran away to the US to live with his cousin when they asked him to come in for an interview (he said he was planning to move anyway, this just gave him the final reason)<br><br>2. one guy got a letter and said he never ordered anything so they destroyed the package<br><br>3. one guy got banned from using the postal service<br><br>of course only people who aren't in prison can tell their story here, so maybe these are the only ones who survived, it's hard to say how many get raped for it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Makoto is fine, I can lay her down and glue all over her delicious belly.</br>  <br>I SAL lewd stuff, nothing ever happened.</br>  <br>also based on those stories it seems pretty easy to "get away with it" if you get caught</br>  <br><br>Yayoi, Makoto and now Azusa, looks like she's answering an invisible phone while being dragged with a rope from behind. Awkward as fuck.</br></br>  <br>My God.</br>  <br>Does your lewd have big breasts or are they flat girls?<br><br><br> 2. one guy got a letter and said he never ordered anything so they destroyed the package <br>I guess that's not too bad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> sweater ruined by strap and belt running through it <br>goddamnit<br><br>And those breasts look droopy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>why are you going to report me?</br>  <br> not liking boob strap <br>I bet you're not even a boobfag.</br></br>  Eye'm the sexiest  Is Canada really that much of a crime free place that they started to crack down on the silliest things instead?  <br>Mostly big breasts, but nothing's ever been open at customs so it doesn't matter.</br>  <br>I love that picture.</br>  <br>No, but people will shit on you for it.</br>  <br>wouldve been better if it was the wedding dress from the show</br>  <br><br>When? You said orders will open soon yesterday. Amiami is updating and she's not there.</br></br>  What's going on with Tora? I have some doujinshi that I've been watching and was going to add to my next orders, and suddenly they're listed as sold out and without a restock request button. They all had at least medium stock indicators and they're not from super popular series so it's not that people were grabbing them up.  Just Arrived.  <br>SOON™</br>  <br> triangle bra thing <br> slutty hotpants <br>meh.</br></br></br>  It's funny how they did a better job with the dvd covers with their chibi line.<br>Have it based on the covers but still change it so it looks good as a figure.</br>  <br>Fucking fujo reeeeee</br>  <br>uniboob sweater is superior</br>  <br><br>Instant pre-order for both. I was worried about how Azusa would translate to figure form but she looks amazing.
