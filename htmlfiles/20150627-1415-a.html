[ Is Dragon Ball Z Revival of F is good or is another shit like other DBZ movies?  It's just Namek Arc abridged/reboot.   are the subs out yet?   It's better than most DBZ movies. It's not shit, but it's not great. It's fun tho.    They launch it on Mexico first.  I'm mexican so I nees our opinions because I don't know if is worth.     When is this movie supposed to come out in the US?   So is only to have a good time?    August 4, 2015.  On Mexico we have it first. Viva México cabrones.      I liked it better than Battle of Gods tbh fam.     Well, that makes me go to the movie theater and watch DBZ.     Goddamnit.  When I was like 8 playing YMCA soccer, the kid whose family lived in Mexico got to see all the new DBZ episodes before I did.  It never ends. Fuck you, beaner.        dumb beaner     tbh fam  go get a job you societal parasite      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pkl<wbr>8OEO0STQ</wbr>  [ ]    It's a good movie if you're not a Piccolo or Gohan fan.   spend your entire life training after the Frieza saga when you were able to do ok   lose so much power that you get BTFO by Zarbon Jr.       Out of all of the nigger insults you go with "get a job" on /a/ of all places    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WiO<wbr>NylGn8Xw</wbr>  [ ] It's pretty hype.     That explains all the engrish.   Bulma looks so sexy on this movie that I wanna fuck her.   Lost   http://www.kanzenshuu.com/2015/06/2<wbr>6/new-fuji-tv-dragon-ball-super-web<wbr>site-posts-30-second-preview/  Its looking more and more like BoG is being completely rewritten.  </wbr></wbr>  Its good for just enjoying some good ol dbz action, but the plot is absolutely retarded.   I think it starts off with it being before BoG, then it timeskips    Maybe, but the part before BoG is already a bit different.    Well, there can be an explanation for it, but yeah, the manga already is retconning shit unless Beerus didn't IMMEDIATELY go to king kai's after waking up.   How good is Kimi ga Nozomu Eien?   Appearently called Rumbling Hearts for the official English release.    Bump.  do you like melodrama? it has  ntr.  also the ova has chizuru from mub rub.   Do you like rage? Then Kimi Nozo is the anime for you.   What kind of MC cucks his comatose girlfriend for her best friend?   Pretty damn good.     it will make you angry  it's good       The kind of MC who would have gotten laid without the accident. He had been clearly mentally expectant of sexual intercourse and thus couldn't handle the lack of it.    Best girl won.    It's a good adaptation of the VN, but lacks in certain areas and removes some character interactions that still have a presence. Too bad the anime dropped all of Takayuki's soliloquies. This is pretty bad as they gave far more depth to his character. Now you really have to think yourself what he is going through, which most people just don't do.  It would be good to approach it with an open mind and trying to relate most characters.   The kind who tries to move on with his life rather than stagnate in one moment in time, especially afterwards he is kicked out from her life by her own parents. Then everything just goes to shit after he is just getting a bit better.  Haruka was aware of Hayase's feelings and basically fucked her best friend because she just wanted to have some dick. She also realised Takayuki had feeling for Hayase early on, but continued to spin him around her finger.         An MC who is traumatized, guilt-stricken and not written to appeal to otaku fantasies.   One of the few shows to give me a real feeling of anxiety while watching  It's like a Telemundo soap opera, I loved it.  Oh, watch the first two episodes back to back. That's a must now that you don't have to wait a week between them.   He gets counter-cucked, so it's all good. Also, Mitsuki a slut.     Legends say that waifu wars were impressive when this shit aired.    I've never seen worse kind of faggotry. All the secondaries who never even touched the VN couldn't wrap their heads around why things were happening and why characters acted like flawed human beings. We are talking about socially awkward faggots like  that throw catchphrases around like it was the hottest shit around, so we should never expect them to take real life into notion.    Is the VN good? I heard it suffered from bad pacing.   Mitsuki was one of the first girls I religiously saved images of    Rumbling Hearts is a good title considering how rage-inducing the series can be.     I'm pretty sure being a slut for revenge is a shitty thing to do no matter what the circumstances    The VN is excellent, âge's masterpiece by all means. Pacing issues are always subjective. There are bits that may seem mundane and long, but we are talking about true slice of life story, not that K-On kind of silly shit. Even with the mundane you get glimpses into the characters, their motivations and what carries them. Father Suzumiya has a much larger role in it and really works great balance to inexperienced Takayuki. Sadly his most important role was moved to Fumio, the red haired nurse, despite she being a complete slut. A nice slut, but a slut nonetheless. The pacing issue can be said to apply to all of âge's mainline works. This is how the writing style is usually applied with characters actually pondering and waging issues. Muv-Luv Alternative had few of those info dumps in form of classes, but we are in assumptions that the reader takes the role of the main character, so the reader has access to the main character's experiences and inner life. Takayuki's inner life is one of the main reasons people really need to read the VN, as it show how fucked he is after the accident to the point of freezing due to PTSD at multiple points. The VN of course has more time to elaborate on the strong points of each character as well as how they are weak, and I see a lot of people missing how weak Hayase's psyche really is, despite it being on the platter even in the TV-series.   It's also the series' official international title, used in Hong Kong DVD release that came before Western ones.   Fumio is a slut, Hayase's literal complete mental breakdown doesn't amount to that.              My nigga     Hey there  Kiminozo Guy.     Thanks for the in-depth post. I have Latest Edition installed so I'll finally get started on it.    Didn't the anime adapt one of the less than optimal endings?     Niggas have good taste    Tee hee hee too much whisky    Just keep away from Homura's routes until you've gone through all others and are properly drunk.   It adapted less than optimal route for  Hayase . It is possible to stand firm and tell  Haruka as things are when it comes to it, preventing Hayase's mental breakdown.  It takes some liberties with certain events and goes even to the extent to change how they go.             Muv-Luv Thread?   Reminder that Mitsuki is the worst.    The worst was really Shinji. It's pretty easy to have your way with a person with almost complete breakdown. Or Haruka, depending if you want to see love stealing little faux-princess who acts like she is doing nothing wrong as a friend betraying act.    I recall acquiring a sinking feeling in my gut as I watched it with the dull realisation that there was absolutely no positive way this could end for any of these people. All I could do to stay afloat was cling to the knowledge that as bad as things were for them, they had it a lot worse one universe over.   It's really more Takayuki's fault than anything. If he wasn't trying to have his cake and eat it too, then maybe things would've ended better.   This show is fucking horrible, like no joke people complain about forced drama in SOL series but this takes the cake, it relies entirely on the MC being a complete retard and the heroine being a complete sociopath. It attempts to be mature but winds up feeling like a 3rd rate porno plot.     But he wasn't. He was guilt ridden to four different directions. He still had a standing PTSD due to the accident, the current situation with Haruka and whatever delusions he had with it, his guilt towards treating Hayase like shit and ignoring her pleads to notice her shattering mental health. Then you have Haruka's dad coming back and requesting him to help Haruka to get better, and then Akane just drops the fucking bomb about her own feelings, after which she just gets sick and Takayuki has to take care of her. Oh wait, that didn't happen in the series. Everything around him just shatters, and he can't literally move on for three years. Then when he is finally making some progress, shit just goes wrong. Too much responsibility is stacked on him to the point he can't even handle his own emotions and acts on how things were, not how things are and that's why he can't be true to himself until, once again, it is forced on him. Only when shit hits the fan he manages to drop the responsibilities that are not his to deal with.  And nigger, I'll fight you about the end. After all, it all ends in  Haruka marrying some with Murakami as his last name and realizes her dream as a children's book author, Akane becomes the school swimming team captain, Homura doesn't peg sex-changed Takayuki all night, and Hayase and Takayuki live as a proper family and they all get together after some time to meet again as friends  on that hill.      But White Album 2 does the whole flawed characters thing a lot better.     And nothing of value was lost.    I just think it's funny how he was the one to get fucked for a change. I like to think it made life for Mitsuki and Haruka better.    Hayase never getting into swimming, Haruka having legs broken and both drafted into army to fight aliens that are constantly killing everybody you love and care for. Dunno, their EXTRA life is pretty fucking comfy compared to that.  SFD has best route; no accidents and Hayase gets her man       I wasn't talking about extra thought. I'm strictly speaking of muv luv verse. They're better off not having to put up with Takayuki's shit on top of everything else there.    Didn't Hayase confide in Takeru that they were both pretty broken up about him and that they never really got over him even years later?    I think it was Munakata or Kazama who told him that.    Seeing Takayuki has no needless pressure put on him and no PTSD due to accident, he most likely is his jolly self with Shinji. Much like all other BETAverse versions, he would have his no-bullshit side and stronger constitution. He'd still like TSFs, he was pretty into Valgern-On.  We can't really say that they would have put up with his shit, when they are talking him in such a warm manner whenever he gets a passing mention.    Pretty much. BETAverse trio didn't manage to get that ever sorted out, and when Takayuki died everything was just there. They're friends, but both know they couldn't get him because of the other.        I've got a rumbling ass, does that count?    My first anime NTR. Mitsuki sleeping with the guys best friend. WHAT.THE.FUCK.    I guess you missed the total nervous breakdown, alcohol, Shinji takinf advantage of her and how Takayuki was in hospital spending time with a girl from three years ago and basically telling her how she mattered jack shit.    If I had a wish, I'd wish that this could air today to see /a/ burn to the ground.  Jesus, imagine this airing in today's /a/. It'd be worse than Guilty Crown, Vaverape, Yahari, etc. This shitposting would make most other shows' threads look like proper discussion.      Watch what you are wishing for, anon.    Did you see the threads for the first two episodes of Death Parade? It would be like that, only ten times worse.   Mitsuki route is canon   Oh please yes.   Bakayuki is such a faggot.  Well, thanks, guys.I was really buttmad when Takayuki choose Mitsuki.I'm just a filthy secondary after all.  Mitsuki best girl.   the VN will never be translated        Watch it, then watch the randumb akane side story, then read the muv-luv trilogy and then watch the akane sidestory again.    You mean Akane Maniax? It's really great how well it connects KGNE and Muv-Luv. It's even more amazing that Extra starts with Takeru and Sumika wondering where the hell Gouda went.    Really loved her in the novel.   If Herakles could be summoned before he went full god, doesn't that mean Jesus could be summoned during his human phase?    No, because Jesus was always God and God was always Jesus. That's how the Trinity works.      Jesus was always God  yes   God was always Jesus  No  That's how the Trinity works  Do you even know what the trinity is           This is really going into some heavy theological shit but iirc Catholic Catechism States that God has always existed as the Trinity. I don't know about heretical catechism, I didn't have to sit through thirteen years of it in school.       Jesus was always God  Jesus was also always a Human. Kind like light is particles and waves.    Don't you know, /a/non? Modern Christians believe that Jesus is and always was 100% god and 100% man. You just have to believe!   You just need to be muslim - no problem at all.    Jesus was both man and God. Like what this guy said, but without the sarcasm.      then what class would Jesus be assigned?  I'd rather see Judas (Assassin?) or Maria-Magdalena (Rider, Caster) though      Jesus is always true god and true man.     Jesus would likely be caster too, it tends to go to any sort of servant who isn't actively combative anyway.        Jesus was both man and God.  This.     Saver.  Or savior hohohoho.      I want to say Lancer, since Jesus never killed anyone.     Rider  Summons Jesus as a mount?     Jesus is simultaneously both fully human and fully divine. It's called the 'dual nature of Christ' and there were hundreds of debates about this topic all the way from the dark ages into the renaissance, many of which degenerated into fistfights which left hundreds dead. Saint Nicholas beat a guy to death with a chair.  I hereby move that Santa should be a heroic spirit.        even in the dark ages they couldn't decide who the best legal Servant was      Lancer killed Shirou and Kotomine-Kirei but it would be fitting because Lancer is also a fisherman       Santa   Rider Class  What's his Noble phantasm?       If Herakles could be summoned before he went full god  wrong herakles is a God in Olymp. at the same time he is dead in Hades. odyseus had a little chat with him.        some space/time distortion that allows him to be at several locations at the same time or moves at almost lightspeed      so his noble phantasm would probably be his sleigh or Rudolph     And his NP would be spear of longinus.    I never understood this KS meme.     probably the spear that the roman soldier used to injure his torso while he was hangig on the cross I have not much knowledge of christianity or the bible but wasn't it Maria Magdalena who catches the blood from this would caused by the spear with a vessel that was later claimed to be the holy grail? holy fuck this shit is too obvious        wound not would  typo      That is the spear of Longinus. Longinus was the name of the soldier.     Maria magdalena - cock rider     He'd likely receive his own class like GILGAMESH, MONSTER, etc.   Wasn't buddha summoned?  Also if you summoned Jesus you'd have infinite holy grails so there's not really a point    Jesus would probably just be a regular/impowered guy. The Abrahamic god is probably just a high-tier Divine Spirit encompassing all three of the religions.   Why would Jesus have something that he never used? If anything make him a Rider and base him on Revelation 19.   Some christian strains say that jesus was only god once he was baptised, others say he always was. I guess trying to summon him would be a pretty interesting way to try and prove it, although the grail might give you a person that is similar to him (like with fake assassin).  That said it would be interesting to see what you would end up with if you try and use the shroud of turin as artifact      no that would be his mount, his noble phantasm would either be his bag of infinite treasure (probably as caster santa) or a teleportation like ability that is tied to the sled.     Only in the moon cell, and even so, Buddha was a lot more human than Jesus    Yes, Shakyamuni was summoned, but no one actually believes Shakyamuni was a god.      bag of infinite treasure (probably as caster santa)  then would't be archer more fitting with his infinite gift works/gates of christmas joy?       artefact crafting by pulling shit out of a bag   not having workshop as a class power   caster  Stop wanting to make everything archer nasu, go back to your molusk porn        I'm actual a casterfag who tries to think straight  also manufacturing shit isn't magic, it's artisanry       summoning a pacifist as a Servant  Good luck with that.    considering medea also had artefact crafting and workshop fits santa perfectly id go for caster rather than forcing him to be archer with his bag. He would rather be an assassin than an archer    Jesus wasn't a pacifist. He didn't kill anyone per se but he was FAR from fucking peaceful. Do I need to remind you of Jesus dislocating a hip after wrestling a dude for few hours and beating up jews?    I've forgotten whatever lectures my teachers gave me on the subject, but I remember either the Nicene or the Apostles' Creed explicitly saying he "was born of the Virgin Mary and was made man," so I think he became man-god in 1 BC.     thinking old testament god/jesus was the same as the new testament/jesus      &gt; God was always Jesus   No   Read a Bible       And what' You summon human jesus.  Hey jesus what you can do?   "I can give you some sick-ass insight!"   And what else?   "I can make some nice bread but that's about it really."         So many people just go "Caster" like he's a magus or something, but his power was authority. The power to tell the Earth to do anything and it responds, or create miracles.  There's already a class for people like him, called Saver.      He can die pretty effectively and he whipped some priests    He has a whip he used to kick merchants out of the temple.  I don't think it was his, he just stole it from someone who had it laying around.      That's part of the sick-ass insight nigga.    Jesus in the New testament once whipped a bunch of people out of his temple, and commanded them to tear it all down.  He chose not to invoke his powers since he had to show the people the correct way.  It's noted the next time he comes around he won't be so nice.         assassin because he sneaks into your house through the chimney? I think Santa is perfect as Rider though      send Jesus in to die   God unleashes hell upon your enemy   Jesus later ressurrects  Sounds like a pretty good plan to me.        Send jesus to die  You also die over god being butthurt u maggot.  Also jesus is summoned for the winner to drink his blood.        &gt;And what else?   &gt;"I can make some nice bread but that's about it really."   Are you stupid, or have you just not read a Bible. Guy had like all the powers.  Replicating fish, walking on water, transmutation, commanding dragons, touch of death to a fig tree, replicating bread, commanding storms and the sea, once walked through a crowd of people trying to kill him without any being able to touch him because he didn't feel like it, bringing people back to life, coming back to life himself, destroying mountains with a command, getting a snake to suck its own poison out of a guy and then telling it to die, curing all diseases with faith, etc.  Guy had all the powers, its like no one has read this.           that, and the fact that he knows everything of everyone, and that he has superb mobility.   but god in the old testament was butthurt and unforgiving all the time. if you compare old to new testament god he is a lot milder and friendlier in the new testament. Also the revelations were john having a bad trip displaying his big brother fantasies.       It's gonna be a Dracula thing, he can temporarily become divine.    You mean his ability to ressurect dead people?     Hey jesus what can you do?   EVE RY THING      Jesus has the power to create his own grail with his blood  why would he even bother fighting over some secondary grail scum?    I have, but OP said "human" so if you want a non-god jesus you get the son of a cucked carpenter.    Why not the saint grail itself?    because the holy grail is just a nickname and doesnt have any ties to the original. Kotomine tells you at the start. The official grail gives you eternal life, the grail here is just a honeypot for heroic spirits to get a shitload of magic to reach the root.    Jesus was always divine, there's no real separating it since he's god in the flesh. However he did all those miracles while he was in the flesh.  Can't separate the powers from the Jesus      Not summoning Santa as Berserker    Bitches stole his cup. Basically it'd fold like this:  Turns saber into dust for being a heretic slut   Just turns everyone into dust for heretic bitches   Grabs the grial and fucks off   Goes to his apartment and serves himself a tea cup on the grial     Buddha asks him why he took so long to get his favorite mug           I'm italian and I was fucking idroctinated with this shit for 20 years so stop being a retard.    Original concept was a turnover, and more fitting with the themes.  Of course the grail in this case has nothing to do with Jesus, in a way where CCC has to point out "That's obvious, this shit does the opposite of God's will". Original story for Fate, the cup is the chalice of the Whore of Babylon or whatever, a cup of infinite greed and desire, which is kind of the opposite of Jesus stuff. This revelation is more obvious when you start to think about the real nature of the grail in this case.  Jesus is more like "No you can't just have whatever selfish thing you want without limit, there are rules" and "There's glory in poverty, the women who gives two pennies of her necessity has given more than all of you who have given out of your excess".        Nothing but weak tricks and sorcery. He'd get wrecked by any C-class servant.    Jesus can't be summoned since he doesn't exist.    Nasu writes some next Fate spinoff or whatever   Lancer gets summoned   "Are you my mas-" and gets hit by collapsing roof   war continues with 6 servants  What other ways could Nasu shit on Lancer?       Golden Chalice &lt;Aurea Boura&gt;(? アウレア・ボーウラ): EX   The golden chalice that BB holds. As well as a Holy Grail.   A negative Holy Grail that grants the impudent, self-centered wishes of the owner.    The chalice possessed by the Whore of Babylon that appears in the Revelation of St. John.   A pseudo-Holy Grail, but exactly because it is a fake Holy Grail that it became a "genuine" Holy Grail that grants the desires of humans regardless of right and wrong.    To the Christians that treated the honorable poverty of those days as virtue, a chalice molded with a symbol of riches such as gold evidently had connotations of corrupted wealth, greed and the vanity of adorning oneself.    Although it was clear from the point that this was the chalice held by the Whore of Babylon - the personification of the Roman Empire - but this chalice has inverted Christ's words of "Do not pile up wealth on the land" and symbolizes the earthly wealth.   **   "I saw a single woman straddled on a red beast.   That beast, whose whole body was covered with numerous names that blasphemed God, had seven heads and ten horns."    According to the Revelation, this is the description of the beast of ruin that appeared in the Holy City and the woman that was straddled on said beast.   A giant beast possessing seven heads as if the Hydra was said to appear from the sea and land on the Holy City.   This beast and woman are one and the same, it is impossible to think about them detached from each other.    The woman is treated as one who brings forth all evils, it has been said that the imprudent and avaricious are unable to oppose her temptation and corrupted by this chalice.    This is a digression, but the Red Saber who call herself an Emperor has been regarded in the same light as this beast and antagonized by the laymen after her death.                          then you just create a wraith of someone who was closest to him.    Jesus exists as a historic figure, his Godhood is up for discussion if you'd like to tip, but not his existence.    There are Roman records of Jesus.    Turning people into dust was not any of his powers. He'd get his shit slapped out of him and then turn the other cheek because that's how he rolled.     Implying if needs be he wouldn't get angels to wrekt shit up and turn everything in to PILLARS OF SALT      I like to think of Revelations as God working out his boredom over having to play nice after the whole Jesus thing. Two thousand years of not smiting people and he just bides his time coming up with the most creative possible way to let it all out once he gets his chance again. Half the reason Revelations is so fucked up is probably because it was a rough draft.     Jesus wasn't a hero, millions of people have died because of him   What would even be the point in a grail war if you could summon Jesus?  You could just cut his finger, drip the blood into a cup and boom, now you too have your own genuine holy grail enjoy your free wishes.     There are rather several reasons why this attempted potshot is strange in this situation.  I'll just go with the angle of "You suppose Heracles and Medusa were real then?" for now.  Jesus existence isn't really in question, it's a confirmed fact.         He gets summoned into a sewer   Sewage discharge   Then he drowns in literal shit        now you too have your own genuine holy grail enjoy your free wishes.  except the official holy grail doesnt grant wishes and the holy grail the grail war is fought for is not the real grail either      Turning people into dust was not any of his powers.   He did it to a fig tree once  Touch of death, fig tree didn't live up to his ideals so he killed it.        mfw there are people who are still confused about The Trinity   Never get into Hinduism or Buddhism, your brain will explode.     And even more because of a pedophile merchant. If you want to tip, tip it the other direction.          If you have trouble just say: Quantum mechanics.          Yeshu was a common-ass name back in Roman Palestine. Doesn't mean any of them inspired the Christian story of Jesus. I'll admit that there probably was some historical basis, but I'm fairly sure there is no definitive evidence of Christ.     Why didn't he use any of those cool powers to prevent the Romans from nailing him to a cross?  Oh, wait, he totally could but he didn't want to because the bible said so.      It was totally prophecy you guys, really!    Muhammed at least was also a warrior and a conqueror. He could probably be summoned as a servant.     Fate takes Heroic in the classical sense, where heroism is defined by doing great deeds, not necessarily being a good person. A good portion of the ancient Greek heroes were assholes or selfish dicks. Ajax killed himself because somebody else got a suit of armor he really wanted.    what about including Indiana Jones as a modern age servant? he was based on a figure named Roy Chapman Andrews and almost everyone knows his lore. plus he is also in pursuit of the holy grail. would he be Rider? because he can ride almost everything, even a fridge.   How many possible people could be called Jesus from Nazareth, "son" of Joseph?    /a/ in charge of christian believes  sasuga /a/   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;1272209   Hey dad should I just teleport or something   naw let them kill you, I'll raise you 3 days later and we get to have tea and scones and catch up, don't you want to see your old man?   Okay dad.       How many people in the Bronx could be called John Smith? A name isn't equivalent to evidence.    Because he had nothing more to do, he already taught enough people for the religion to survive 2000 god damn years.     warrior   conqueror  Pick none. He was a pedophile illiterate merchant. He literally just got a bunch of dumbfucks to kill people in his name       There are loads of theories of jesus. One is that he was conjured up by the early christian sect to spearhead their faith with a charismatic leader. Another one is that he was a disciple of john the baptist but defected to start his own group Another is that he really did exist as the bible describes him Another is that another person (or persons) was jesus and the image got corrupted as the story was passed around.  That said the gospels were not literally written by john, matthew etc. They were drafted based on the memoirs of them and it took 20 years before they were written down.          You do realize how little people were alive in times of Jesus on Earth? One big city in the US probably has as many people as 30 AD.    Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels? 54 But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?”    Well yeah that was the entire point, he had all the powers, yet he could not use them selfishly since he was trying to show that humans could live properly even with their limited means and weakness.  He was trying to prove that a human could live correctly, by becoming human and showing everyone how it was done.  Thus he had to commit no sins, die righteously not because he did anything wrong but because he would not concede towards what was right, and make sure that his message would live on forever.  By dying with no sin, knowing that he would die that same day and not lifting a hand against these people, he created the salvation. Showing that a human could live right, taking all sins upon him while he was on the cross and dying with all sins, so that others could be saved.  That's what it means to be a messiah.  You're questioning this shit while you go "Woah cool!" when Archer did the same thing when he died. He had all the power to stop his death, but he abided by the outcome he foresaw until the end.               Ajax killed himself because somebody else got a suit of armor he really wanted.  No it was because he felt he was not recognised. Agamemnon was a dick, achilles was much more prominent because he had more powers and odyseus didnt do jack shit.     Its more like the last thing he did fulfilled everything he talked about.     trinitarian garbage  Jesus died. God cannot die. Ergo Jesus was not god.      "hey Jesus, you claim you are the son of god, but we find that kinda offensive, so we will kill you UNLESS you can show us one of those miracles you are known for"   "I-I dunno guys, I don't feel like showing any miracles right now"   "Dude, we're gonna nail you to a cross, that shit is painful. Show us a miracle and we will all believe you are the son of god, follow your teachings, adopt what you preach and usher in a time of peace and prosperity."   "N-nah guys, it's all good, I'd rather die... But I could totally turn you all into pillars of salt if I wanted to."   "Alright then, we're also gonna kill all your followers and prosecute christians for the next couple hundred of years, but as the son of god, you already know all of that I'm sure"   "Y-yeah, that's all part of the plan.. hehhe..he"         Can batman and superman be summoned?   He was back three days later  He died in the same sense Arcuied died, it cannot last since he's divine. He allowed himself to die temporarily to do some things in the afterlife.       Fine then   Gather Jesus blood in cup   Become literally invincible   Win grail war because you cannot die ever           he had all the powers, yet he could not use them selfishly since he was trying to show that humans could live properly even with their limited means and weakness.   Yeah, either that or he had zero powers and didn't use them because he was a charlatan. I wonder which is more likely.       has superpowers, can get everything he wants   probably spend centuries fucking his balls blue and doing w/e   lives in eternal boredom   decides to see do the ancient times equivalent of baiting, starting a religion   shit goes according to plan   they ask him for a miracle   knows that if he puts out he goes back to being hounded down by sluts wanting their wishes fullfilled and men wanting to use his powers for his own   decides not to   gets killed   revives    laughs as everyone believes his shit even though he didnt do jack               They also had much fewer common names, especially in the western world. People having the same name and being in the same area wasn't uncommon. And even if there was only one person recorded as Jesus of Nazareth, son of Joseph, that doesn't mean a lot, especially since they apparently snuck out of Palestine and went to Egypt without king Herod noticing, even though he was actively looking for Jesus. Even so, if the evidence was actually that specific, Christians everywhere would throw that fact around with a great amount of zeal, which they don't. I've actually gone to archaeological lectures about digs which seem to seek sites important in Jesus's life, and it would be basically impossible to prove that a boy or man named Jesus of Nazareth, son of Joseph was ever there. The best evidence is that early Christians celebrated them as holy sites, and by early it's usually several centuries after the death of Christ and the councils of Nicaea.    Getting caught was a part of his plan.  Define death.      Bull the trinity orgin lies in pagan beliefs adopted by catholicism and is in no way shape or form from the Bible. Jesus acknowledged that he was the son of God and not God himself. They don't even have the same name. God's name is YHVH otherwise translated as Jehovah in English. It means "he causes to become".     especially since they apparently snuck out of Palestine and went to Egypt without king Herod noticing  Is it so unbelievable considering he's supposed to be a God? They were literally forewarned.      God's name is YHVH  That's what the jews say. Frankly I think God doesn't need a name because it's a human concept.      What are you Implying? The jews worship the same God as the Christians. And who cares what you think? God has a name and he wants people to know it.   Jesus powers:  Can heal any injury or illness Can revive the dead (including himself) Can manipulate natural forces to almost any effect Can create things from nothing (including life) Can exorcise demons Capable of creating relics of insane power through his blood (holy grail grants invincibility/immortality, spear of longinus makes whoever holds it unable to lose in a battle and so on and so on)  Nigga would be broken as fuck. Literally can't die and if you die he can just revive you anyway.            I'm saying if they could get to Egypt without attracting the attention of a local warlord who had an active interest in finding them, it's pretty realistic that the Romans also wouldn't have kept records on them, especially considering the fact that the Roman Empire seems to have been pretty lax in its governing of the provinces, Palestine in particular, which the story of the crucifixion supports. My point there is that lack of accurate records don't prove that Jesus didn't exist, and that vague records certainly don't prove that Jesus did exist.    god has a name because he knows people need to put a tag on things. When he was a burning bush he had a name that was required for that moment.    He could revive after three days perhaps, in which time the master would be vulnerable.    But Jesus did do miracles according to the Bible to show people he is the son of god. He didn't have to call down angels and kill those Romans, he just had to back up his own fucking claims by showing them one micracle. According to his followers, he did those miracles all the fucking time, but suddenly when it's not in front of a bunch of gullible peasants, he believes doing miracles is abusing power and shit and he doesn't wanna do that.    You forgot to mention he could call in a legion of angels in anytime he wants. And remember one angel was powerful enough to wipe out 185000 assyrian troops in one night.  Than how come that name is used over 7000 times in the original Bible manuscripts if it supposed to be a one time thing?      Yeah, too bad God couldn't do shit against iron chariots.    Fuck you, now I am imagining Shirou fucking Wonder Woman.    because most of the bible was recorded at one small timeframe based on centuries of oral tradition. So it would make sense they picked one name.     millions of people have died because of him  If my Grandson killed someone am I at fault?     Jesus would be an amazing comic relief servant. He constantly brags about how powerful he is and all the crazy shit he can do and his master totally believes him, but he never does any of it because of reasons. Every battle he gets instantly killed and ressurects 3 days later, just to be killed again until his master finally dies or runs out of command seals.    yes that is what southpark does.   This is slowly becoming a fedora thread    This guy  Anytime the Israelites ever lost a battle its because they did something wrong. Every single time.  Than that implies that you don't believe that the Bible is inspired by God. If you did you would understand that all of the Bible writers wrote the Bible under divine inspiration.        If you did you would understand that all of the Bible writers wrote the Bible under divine inspiration.  and how would this divine inspiration not tell them one and the same name?    jesus can summon all the warriors of the crusades to fight for him. heck he can make new divine things with his blood.    It's not even that consistent. Genesis for example uses both "Yahweh" and "Elohim", probably because of the polytheistic nature of Semitic mythology that wasn't fully eradicated from the Old Testament.     God cannot die  I dispute this, in the context of death as a cessation of mortal life, not of existence in total.     Uh, I don't think Judges 1:19 leaves much open to interpretation, /a/non. Feel free to drink the kool-aid, though. There are also multiple biblical passages which contradict each other, suggesting that at least parts of the bible weren't divinely inspired, unless you engage in a large amount of doublethink. Not to mention the fact that biblical texts have been revised, and the apocrypha were excluded from the biblical canon.    Because the reason he'd be doing it you fucking maggot.   Bread and fishes  It was a wedding and they had no food, so he selflessly gave them food, for no reason other than being good.  Healing the sick  He did so, because they where sick and they could not be healed, he did all that was in his power to heal them selflessly.  Summoning the host of angels to burn rome to ashes because he's gonna get crucified  That's not selfless, he died for peoples sins to show them that there is salvation if you're good and live with no sin.  THIS ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE ANON, SPICS GET IT.           Imagine than jesus its summon in a holy war and Jean the Ark is summon too.  That could be really funny.     But those crusades went against anything he was teaching. Why would he summon a bunch of sinners from hell who murdered in his name?     אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה     You forgot  Can only use them selflessly, what that means is really up to him.      So why did he walk on water? What was the selfless act there?     be a cute girl that wants the divine dick   jeane cucks you       the twist is that he doesn't give a shit about winning and just wants to see how everyone is doing personally      No. He can perform miracles whenever he wants. He just refused to do them to prove his authority or for selfish reasons. It's not a restriction though.     That's exactly why he has only one personal name.  To save Peter who was drowning wise guy.  That wasn't on God. The Israelites were to afraid to fight despite God being with them. Where are the contradictions that you speak of oh euphoric one?        God can do anything otherwise he's not God.    But I specifically mentioned that he didn't have to summon angels to kill those Romans, you retard. He could have just picked a random sick person and healed them while those Romans were around to see it. I guess those sick people didn't deserve to be healed because that would have lead to Jesus not dying, which would be against god's plan? In which case, didn't Jesus act very selfish by ignoring to help those people just so he could die according to plan?    So Gilgamesh, basically.   You can't be Christian and claim the Old Testament to be be completely right. Jesus makes a point of correcting a lot of what was in the Old Testament in the New Testament.    To save Peter who was drowning wise guy.   You don't need to walk on water to save a drowning man. Swimming works just fine. so either he did that miracle to show off or because he was too lazy to swim, but it wasn't for any selfless reason.       &gt;God can do anything otherwise he's not God.  not really, God doesnt have to be able to everything, he can just be very powerful. God being omnipotent is just a medieval invention.      jesus goes to pray   his niggas on the boat went away because wind   He walks on water to get to them   They think he's a ghost about to spook them up   He be like "Chillax my african americans, it's me your mainest nigga"   Pete be like "If you mah mainest nigga tell me to come to you on the water"   Jesus be like "Come bruh"   Pete starts to walk on water but gets spooked the fuck out and starts to sink yelling like a bitch "PLEASE SAVE A HOMIE!   Jesus walks to him and helps him out and be like "nigga hav sum faith, why ya doubt the mainest nigga?"   Then he climbed to the boat and the wind was like "ain't havin none of dat sheit" and fucked off back to Oklahoma   all of jesus hommies be like "You dah mainest nigga bruh"                &gt;be a cute girl that wants the divine dick  I can see she falling in love for him, but he is already married.    Let me see if I have this straight.  Some guy is trying to argue that the circumstances described in the Bible about Jesus' crucifixion suggest that he can't perform miracles therefore he's not the son of god.  But by taking the bible as a factual source he's admitting that events happened in the bible are exactly as described.  Therefore things like Jesus resurrecting, performing miracles, etc are all true. So he's the son of god.  What are you arguing about again?           Are you serious?  Okay. His NP will be:  Rudolph who grants him lightspeed as long as Santa is within his sleigh   Judgement of Character which dishes out damage according to the behavior his enemy had during their lifetime.The more evil a person, the bigger they get hurt.This damage bypasses the concepts of defence, durability and endurance and cannot be avoided.Santa needs to have knowledge of the other Servant's acts during their lifetime and marked him on his list for bad behavior otherwise he cannot use it, so naturally he can't use it either without knowing the identity of his enemy.   Toy Factory.A Reality Marble based upon the believes,wishes and dreams of children throughout the course of history.Within, the factory will create whatever they desired and desire whether materialistic or abstract, realistic or imaginative.But Santa is obliged to to not make true what he deems as bad.           Ignoring your ad hominem, since I did provoke it, it seems odd that bible didn't say that the Israelites were afraid, and so they couldn't defeat the iron chariots. Instead, the bible states that God was with them, but even then they couldn't defeat the iron chariots. And since you asked, the largest contradiction, in my opinion, is the concept of free will in Christianity. God is all knowing and omnipotent, and created everything. Therefore, we can conclude that he knows everything that will happen, and knew this from the moment of creation. Thus, free will would be an illusion, since everything was predetermined from creation. I personally find this rather disturbing especially because God punishes his creations for doing what He deems evil, even knowing that they are in fact inevitable actions.    There are people in this thread that think Servant Jesus would be a normal dude.  Servants are shaped by their legends so Jesus would be stupidly powerful. Iskander was never able to summon bis army anytime he wanted (he actually wasn't that close to them in real life) but it's his NP     One big city in the US probably has as many people as 30 AD.  You don't seriously believe that, don't you?    Can you summon Heroic Spirits if they're still alive? If not, I can't see how you could summon Santa. Also, Jesus would not be part of the same group of spirits that the Grail draws from for summoning unless I am misunderstanding something.   Caster could maybe summon him, like she summoned Sasaki Kojirou.    Not him, but the estimates Google gives me (from official census places and shit) suggest that Tokyo has 10-20% of 30 AD's population, which is pretty mind-boggling in and of itself.     Get on the grial wars   Get motherfucking JESUS as your summon   All he does is help other people and ignore the war       Who eligible to be a heroic spirit would still be alive? There's Santa as you mentioned and maybe Cain with his whole cursed to walk the earth until the end of days thing.    If anything, you could help him stop the war considering he doesn't want people to kill each other and the grail's existence is heretical.    How many people do you think lived in 30 AD?  Hint: not fucking anywhere near million      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World<wbr>_population_estimates  Educate yourself  </wbr>    You're right, it was almost certainly over 150 million, as a low estimate.    Jesus never existed Look up Horus    Wandering Jew in the same vein, and any of those figures who wish for immortality but fuck it up somehow and shrivel into trees or forget their mortal lives or whatever    Oh shit, is Jesus Shirou's ultimate form? In an alternate universe does Shirou go back in time to be who he always wanted to be?   ITT: Trinitarian faggots spread their heresy   Couldn't King Solomon make for a totally broken but legal Caster?     Shit.     Why would Jesus fight in the war when he is the source of the TRUE holy grail?    It doesn't matter who he is. What matters is his plan.    Jesus is summoned   Shirou beats him because Shirou   butthurt christfags everywhere      If I pulled him off, would he die?    It would be extremely painful    Kirei summoning Jesus would've made for an amazing route.    Hey now, Jesus occasionally does cool stuff in South Park.    You're a big guy.    For Jews   Let's talk about Archer.    Ajax killed himself    himself    him       I'm GAR for him.    If I took his his clothes off would he die of embarrassment?    Could he magic away his guido tan and frosted white hair if he really wanted?    The sexiest.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12722449  You're GAR for the wrong guy.    Why is Kirei so fucking cool?   Since the Holy Grail is basically Jesus in a cup, does that make Einzberns clones of Christ?   It would be extremely shameful.     Holy Grail is basically Jesus in a cup   It's not Jesus, it's the root to Akasha if I recall, well I think it's mostly Angra Mainyu now but it was never the true holy grail.      Does Kotomine even provide any priestly services? Like does he hold mass and shit?    He's a red man.     Jesus in a cup  Are you saying that Michael Jackson has already accessed the Root?     4u    Yup.       This will never fail to make me smile. I should be used to it by now but thanks guys.       I'm happy that you're happy.    Does this mean Teucer is a grill as well?    He's a big guy.     I'm GAR for both.     This picture truly disgusts me.    "How to start a crusade/jihad?": The thread.    As long as they eventually will die, it doesn't matter. Gilgamesh could be summoned back in Gilgamesh's time if he had the means to do it. Merin is the only case so far where he can't be a hero because he will never, ever die.     Aw c'mon don't be a snob, American cheese isn't so bad.    It's only acceptable if making a grilled cheese, otherwise it shouldn't be used period.    He's actually an incredible priest.    You can't summon Jesus nor Muhammad as they're fully divine. Fuyuki Grail can't summon divine beings. You can summon "currently alive" Heroic Spirits as they will die at some point but it's risky as you cannot know whether the guy you're summoning actually managed to become a hero.  Grail is not the Jesus' Grail. Basically in Nasuverse the name "Holy Grail" is given to any wish-granting artifact which might be the original one.     Trinity is bullshit. the mormons know what's up. Holy trinity is three separate beings. Jesus was the literal son of god, meaning that Mary was inseminated by God, though he probably just placed his seed in her magically because Mary was still a virgin.    Summon Ali ibn Abi Talib   has Muslim Excalibur   literally the greatest man ever created   no heroes can defeat him, he's the greatest hero   no weapon can match his sword as it's the greatest sword   mfw Ali is a Gary Stu          Sorry for the late reply but just because God is all knowing doesn't mean he carelessly uses his predetermination like that. For example just because a strong man is strong doesn't mean he can't pick up a glass without crushing it. It is the same way with God. He would not preordain our futures at birth because he knows that it would violate our freewill.     mormons  Are you for real     Feats in real life?    He is right about thr trinity. Wrong about everything thing else. Kek book of Mormon.    There are like a thousand "greatest dude ever"s though When everyone is a Gary Stu, no one is     Servant's gary stuness is based by the fame they have.. If more than 1 billion people know your name and your story you'll indeed become a strong servant    gtfo fag, nobody gives a shit if you don't believe in Jesus.   What if you summon a wraith closest to Kirito?  I mean, Sasaki isn't even fucking real.     Damn that'd be awkward.     Summoning "The aspect of Jesus as a human prophet"  Servant Saver, Joshua the Nazarene Neutral Good STR: B END: A+ AGI: C Mana: A LUK: C NP: A  Class skills:  Charisma: A+  At this point it is no longer popularity, but rather a kind of spell (curse) in itself.

King of Kings: A+ "All authority on Earth has been given to me" Anti-Unit Through a higher power, allows the Servant to steal and make use of a Master's Command Seals.                   What even is this thread   /a/ - Religion and Christology   Is there anything Saber won't do for food?   Jesus is less about swords, and more about ideals that involve salvation in higher plane of existence type sense.  Not just saving them physically like Shirou, not that Shirou so much saves people, but teaching them in a way that will save their soul.      Holy Grail was never Akasha  Holy Grail was a huge amount of prana, that they would use to break into the other side of the world to get endless prana, which they would then use along with ten years of research to eventually reach Akasha.  People always seem confused about that, but just because the end point of the plan is "Reach the root" doesn't mean its a two step process".  They need to use the grail to reach the other side, which Ilya went to at the end of HF. Other Side is where all the phantasmal beasts, dragons, Avalon, and Merlin hang out.  It's a hidden layer of the world with theoretically infinite prana by magus standards, that Sigfried goes to at the end of Apoc. A hidden side of the world where prana thrives. No Holy Grail is Akasha the root, it's just that eventually the plan is to use the grail to reach it after you have seven servants with fuckloads of prana filling the grail.            New Years service is his favorite  His congregation really loves how he makes them really question themselves and repent hard, since he picks apart their faults entirely and makes them face yourselves.  Just two hours every Sunday or Saturday of being told why you specifically are a hypocrite or potentially horrible. It makes you face yourself and get better.        There are quite a lot of references in the Book of Revelations to Jesus pulling a sword out of his mouth, or having a mouth sharp like a sword, with which he could smite nations and the slain would be eaten by birds or something.    Too many people like  or  take bs from CCC as canon.  Remember that in Nasu's original work anything "mystic" is based on the age legend.  Caliburn loses to Gram Cu's spear loses to Odin's spear  Seeing that Jesus is around 2000 years he would be strong, but not likely to be unbelieveably powerful like Gil.  There's not guarantee since "gods" have ranged from super powerful part-gods like Herc/Gil to "devil(inverse gods)" like angry manjew who is weak as fuck.  tl;dr Jesus would likely be a caster. He's class might range depending no how Nasu writes him. Could be a human hack who's legend became great (caster)or an actual deity (Ruler. Not CCC bs evil buddha saver, but F/A style ruler who can stop fights and revive himself if killed).                but not likely to be unbelieveably powerful like Gil.   I think that's not necessarily true. If summoned as a heroic spirit his stats would be absolutely monstrous considering that he's one of, if not the, most well known heroic spirits on the planet.     I'll start with Jitsu wa Watashi wa.  Disgusting art, lame/average writing, absolutely no stand out qualities whatsoever.  Also garbage like Hibike! Euphonium and K-ON. It's easy to say "moeshit", but why? Why are unfunny shows about nothing popular?      Bleach, One Piece, Naruto Threads weekly, even for something like Naruto which was impossible to make a thread on for quite awhile due to shitposting and the stigma of making a Naruto thread even.   Not the best battle manga out, full of retarded plotlines and most of the characters are not fleshed out or interesting. Art isn't that good.     Everything by KyoAni ever.    haruhi      Mahouka   I just finished this series recently and it was a 3/10 at best. I don't see why everyone on /a/ raved about it.       I agree with Hibike. I watched it and it's so dull, don't see why it's so popular here.     It was ironic. Some people stuck around because of the girls and to figure out and marvel at the magic.   Let's get this shindig started.  Ancient Roman anime. intense arguments in the senate, amazing love stories, extremely brutal battle scenes.   Castlevania    since the fag that was doing it quit  I was unaware people still cared about it.     Symphonygay    Symphogear   What happened to Mo-tan to become so tiny? Did she only manage to reincarnate partially?  Is she not part of the zodiac anymore then?     Why the fuck would she be traveling around the world with Nya-tan in the first place, doesn't she have the whole Tokai region to protect?   inb4 it turns out there WAS somebody that missed Rat's radar and won all the Eto-seals in the last moment to become an Eto-shin.    Hooray Paca-tan          Her soul got ripped out and shattered. Give her SOME time to heal    she's on sick leave   what I want to know is Pretty Mode tiny in general or is Mo-tan just like that because of the aforementioned soul ripping          Rabbit? More like RabBest.   Well there's the manga.  Which deviates so much from the anime that it is practically a different story just with characters that look the same    You're early today      I, for one, welcome our new CG overlord.    well that is smaller but hardly pocket sized     Nya-tan is travelling the world to find a cure to restore mo-tan's body.  Mo-tan is too weak to protect a region and just tags along with Nya-tan.   season 2 never indeed        Boar is best  Reminder that Meitan was confirmed best girl last thread.    Mission accomplished     I feel sad for you Sheepfags since she gets BTFO in manga    So, uh, did they explain what the deal is with Takeru? Did I miss something?   What was wrong with him?    He was just a small town boy    I'm still wondering how he's able to barf out Sol/Lull like it's no big deal.     does anyone else feel like the ending was a tease for second season/OVA where they will have 3D segments with more realistic body proportions just like in OPs pick?  it felt like that to me.   muh sales!   there are plenty of low-sales shows that get second seasons or OVAs           List a few  because I would like to believe      there are plenty of low-sales shows that get second seasons or OVAs  Because they are for promoting the source material. If the publishers think an anime increased the sales of manga, VNs, or merchandise, even if the anime itself sold badly, they will consider it a success.  Etotama was just a commercial disaster.      Now my ears can rest in peace and heal from Nya's voice.    Etotama was just a commercial disaster.  Exactly. And it makes me fucking happy.     You could marinate a whole cow with such saltiness  not that it would be difficult now that Mo-tan has become chibi     Living in a lonely world?    Why chuu-tan looks so HIGH.    Because Murakawa subconsciously hates Rat  or her VA  deep inside     Not anymore, he has a floor boar, a monkey and a dog on his roof, a horse and a sheep taking care of his home, a tiger and a dragon keeping him company, a rooster waking him up in the morning, a snake cooking for him, a cat with a cow, and a rabbit occassionally visiting him, and now he also acquired a sexy loveable rat who hangs around him to relax. Must be awesome having such great Soul/Lull.       Shitty drawings being showcased in anime is my biggest hnnnngggggghhhh    Well that was cute.   What does her VA have to do with it?   damn, that was a totally worthless final for a worthless series   That was a joke.  A retarded one at that, sorry       Matsui Eriko and Ozawa Ari are talented as fuck.     Mo-tan  That VA can art, dang.      I like Chu-tan's and Shaa-tan's, and nya-tan's  like they know they can't draw for shit so they don't care       Usa-tan&gt;Mo-tan&gt;Uma-tan&gt;Inu-tan&gt;rest<wbr>  Usa-tan has the most character, Mo-tan is more polished but the drawing itself ain't as good  </wbr>   Favorite Pretty Mode designs?  My top 3 is boar, snake, and tiger.       nope, Mo-tan drawing best and then Shima-tan   Piyo-tan has best pretty mode        Piyotan, Uritan, Shaatan.      footfag bait   best anything       Well, finally finished whatever autistic thing I've been doing for several days.  https://mega.co.nz/#F!L1FUkAyR!sz2d<wbr>uWsfLq1-1LtM558L8w  Feel free to step up and translate.  No, fuck it, SOMEBODY PLEASE TRANSLATE    </wbr>    te plot was too similar to first neptunia game  Who the hell is drawing all these 2D Pretty Modes and how is he making them so fucking cute  Can we all agree now that Etotama is AOTS? If not, it's probably the most surprising anime this season.   The 3D animation done fucking right.    GOAT 3dcg. Is this the future of animation?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4Ws<wbr>pe9AxHng</wbr>  [ ] https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Rdm<wbr>-Xab7kHs</wbr>  [ ]    We just have to hope studios outsource their 3D to shirogumi    Maybe not AOTS, but surely is the hidden gem I'll remember fondly. Like The Rolling Girls last season.    They were always cute, anon.    Where is her nose?    Watch Short 4 and tell me if you still think Mei-tan is best    The rat took it.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127207004  Fuck, I need some sleep.   Did they complete the music video with the Etotamas singing in pretty mode yet?      Don't you want to hear desu desu sing anymore?    Comes with BD Vol 6, which comes out late July.     No subs so far.     Had to reword post to make sure I didn't fuck it up a third time desu desu.   Thanks, I'll be looking forward to it.       It's kind of obvious what they say.  Mei-tan's devotion for Takeru goes a little too far and spooks the shit out of the Takeru-house residents     that second left, top-most   ;_;     I just realized after posting, that was made by Nya-tan's VA. She must have had fun voicing her     Where's this located?      Remember that Sol/Lull is basically concentrated niceness. Positive human emotions.  Takeru, being modern anime harem lead, is constructed at the subatomic level of nothing but 'nice guy' particles. He's a Superhadron Collider of Niceness energy./         Harem  The only one that truly shows an interest in Takeru's reproductive organs is the Sheep and he tries to kick her out of his house in the manga      Every time I watch anime like this I always see the VAs having loads of fun to the point of crying when the show was over.  It's really sad, but heartwarming to know they had just as much fun voicing the anime as I did watching it.  for GJ-bu, Megumi's VA cried on her radio show because the anime was done ;_;         CG dance music video with all the characters in the last BD   Piyotan doesn't stop and go "wuhh" after three steps  IMMERSION RUINED  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5UK<wbr>fMF9vYjI</wbr>  [ ]      Hey, I just found the short episodes other than the 1st one.  http://www.youtube.com/playlist?lis<wbr>t=PLD5tew_NN2lHZ6GmqINYWunRaCOlXDAf<wbr>p</wbr></wbr>       when VA's really had fun being part of an anime because it was probably their first time receiving such a significant role that isn't background character voices and they don't want their happiness to end.    When VAs want a S2 because then they'll be off searching for another anime to voice for and it'll be god knows how long until they land another spot like that.   For all intensive purposes, I guess it's a doggy dog world out there           Cock spends most of her day sleeping in a fucking tree   You'll never look up and find a cock sleeping in a tree ;_;         episode 4   00:25          Sheep is a closet yandere        then you realize Mei-tan have Takeru's house key without him even knowing  She's gonna rape him one of these days.      Mei-tan you're scaring me.     There's more than one kind of harem. A bevy of beautiful girls all living in around and with a single hapless guy. Even if most arent romantically interested, they interact with him in friendly ways, so to me it is still what I consider a Harem... I usually think of it as a viewer harem show.. or like a supporting cast harem?    Holy shit.   Mei-tan pls go and stay go      Mei-tan is lovely. How do I get a yandere sheep to obsess over me?     Mei-tan confirmed for sleeper best girl  Why the writers made a fucking episode about Takeru's cold and not this is beyond me.          Sheep is scary.     Because they needed to provide a reason why an Eto-shin fell in love with a mortal, unless you want a slutty Sheep who falls in love at first sight with someone just because he looks good.  Also &gt;pic related        Mei-Tan   A healing specialist who delivers every possible therapeutic treatment.   I didn't realize death was a part of the treatment        That ass.    this took longer than it normally does are you tired or something     Death cures everything.    You fuckers told me I was retarded for even suggesting that she could be a closet yandere.  Fuck every last one of you.        Laid-back, easy-going, and soothing personality.   I'll never trust again      I couldn't handle the lack of anime so I started watching the niconico talk show.  Jesus Christ, does Nya-tan's VA have sugar water flowing through her veins?     Who stole Uma-tan's nose?    Finish show   Take nap   OP stuck in my head  It can't be helped.  This OP (and show in general) really grew on me. For one that I used to regret picking up, I already miss it.         OP's LET'S MOU IKAAAAAAAI   ED'S JAA NE, MATANE TO   Which is harder to get out of your head when you try to sleep?       They also did the thing where the VAs sing the ED, didn't they?     We should've noticed sooner     She's a zygote, from the union of Chu-tard's egg and Nyan-tard's sperm.      ED, apparently. I'm pretty sure that was stuck in my head as I was trying to get to sleep.  They're both great though. Fucking earworms  S2 never ;_;       Wait, each VA sung the entire ED for an episode? I distinctly heard different voices as the camera panned across the cute sleeping divine messengers.    Got a link?     Are there full versions?      man rat is kind of gay for cat whats up with that    Thank you /a/, you glorious wizard.  That makes me wonder, are there more screenshots of that discussion/thread?      Search on YT for 干支ーク   Where is muh blue moment cgi dance?     I feel like that line of thinking always ends up with idiots running in circles while screaming "haremshit" or "fujoshit" at the top of their lungs every time there is an unbalanced cast of characters.    What discussion? That was just one post in a normal thread.  But there's this right underneath that post.     It's a shame this did so poorly. I guess the idea was that with a cast of 13 waifus the show couldn't possibly do poorly, but it did anyway.    Stop making everything sadder, the BD sales alone is bad enough.  I wonder why they're so afraid of Mei-tan just because she have the key. It's not like she couldn't just climb the wall and enter through the backyard's door.      Or you know that hole in his house that connects the two realms together.   Is that the character designer who did Monogatari?  And why does the 3D look so amazing?      Stop making everything sadder  Think about all the effort put into making the CG models, and animating them.  Now think about how all these data are going to be stashed into some storage, never to be used again, and eventually deleted.       Or that. Seriously, Takeru's house is not that hard to break into.  Well fuck you too. I just got over this thinking that they're a big company with plenty of successful business before, don't bring me down again.       Monkey and Dog are best boys.   This.    Easily. I watched 29 and nothing came close.   In the end, all girls were best girl.     The etotamas are in order of rank from highest-lowest   placed in cards going from lowest-highest   ???????        and that's the part where he took the midnight train goin' anywhere.    Then why is your screenshot so bad, streamfag?    And next one is the last one, maybe ;_;  The radio also coming to an end,     wait, wut? sorry for being a slow retard, but what the fuck, they're boys?    Anon,  it's a joke.     Of course, everyone knew this. What the hell have you been doing, slowpoke?    but this  says it's a joke. I'll go take his word. They wouldn't be Eto musume if they were boys. I didn't even know it was a joke, I really am very slow.    Don't believe Anonymous, he's rusing you. Trust me.

Please I need more Etoshin in my life       Megumi's VA cried twice  Once because the anime was over  the second time was because her radio show was ending too   that moment when she's barely in any fucking anime, and only credited in less than ten shows   GJ-bu was literally  the peak of her life              You know, there are dozens of stupid ways to reply to this.  I'll just post best Eto-shin instead.      Because I got it from google.    They're boys.   How much do the BDs cost?  I'll buy it if it's not expensive as fuck like they usually are.    Non shit subs when?   6500 yen   surprise hit of the year?  surprise hit of the year      ordering    Tiger? More like Thigh-ger    Cow? More like Wow!     baka    now put Wow upside down.     got something you want to share Oedipus      Boar? More like  Moar .  S2 will focus on Nya-tan's journeys.   Cute, but I liked it when she spent an entire episode cumming.     I liked it when Shark      Why is her wish about jumping sharks?    Now I like the rat help    Japanese creation myth     It's okay, we all do.  Apart from some faggots.       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare_<wbr>of_Inaba</wbr>    who would've thought    Chu-tan is sexual     monkey confirmed for future pope    dem thighs   Chu-tan is cute      Eh it's funnier not knowing that legend        3 months of vindication        Even the rat's expression on her mask thing changed.     I wonder if the area around her bellybutton is soft as it looks      I liked her better when she was evil      Do you think the running gag with her dying has something to do with her figure      popping fresh     I'm more concerned with how her bellybutton tastes like  and whether or not you can contract the Bubonic Plague from it.      yo be fair the plague came from the mites not the rats     what do Nyatan's socks smell like?     Something that must be better than wanting to smother your face in between her thighs and smelling the ocean.     Good point. That would have went on and on.  but that's not Mei-tan, anon.       well yeah he said best girl not yandere sheep      yandere sheep    not best girl       Why do you give me these dreams that will never be real     Kanda shrine in Akihabara. A few of them got moved around or covered because these were the only Etotama ones left when I went last month     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare<wbr>_of_Inaba</wbr>  That explains this, I guess.    today I learned that every time an anime that will likely not get a second season ends, the VAs get extremely heartbroken.  I guess that's why when the VAs for Yuru Yuri were surprised with the S2 announcement they all cried for joy.      Stop, I don't want to go to bed with sad thoughts like these!     tfw Moo-tan's VA is as lewd as Moo-tan herself     Only the less popular VAs get like that   meanwhile HanaKana doesn't give a fuck cause she knows she'll get a major role in another anime no matter what she does.         You'll never hear Mo-tan speak broken english intermingled with Japanese ever again   Why live        Dora-tan   Most prudish &amp; old-fashioned Etoshin   Voiced by Maayayan   OH THE IRON KNEES         today I learned that every time an anime that will likely not get a second season ends, the VAs get extremely heartbroken.   it's nice to know that even if the fans have shit taste the people making this stuff actually seem to care       You will never be molested by Mo-tan's VA     entire Japan is managed by a rat goddess   Who wants to be under a fucking rat?   Have some dignity, Japan.      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ds8<wbr>yHO4YfXM</wbr>  [ ]  What's this fight between Nya and Moo-tan? Just PV material?     Rat master race.     Maybe they animated so much they actually already animated S2 and some of it slipped into the PV for S1    Just let it die /a/, season 2 never desdes    I can dream, anon      those thigh highs slightly squeezing those chubby thighs  My dick.        Not worshiping your rat god  Is Pikachu and Mickey Mouse gonna hafta choke sum bitches?       Not knowing Doraemon is basically the Japanese Mickey Mouse in Japan, and he's a talking robotic cat from the fucking future with 1001 assorted ways to fuck you up        And even he was afraid of rats.   Who cried when rat cried? Shit was touching for some reason.   I did tear up a bit. I always do at shit like that. I didn't want to admit it, because I thought I was the only one.     Yeah, VA did a good job.       friendship end  YES  toeless + heelless tights  YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES          2015   being a footfag  To the gas chambers with you.     We Berserk now.  Requesting 60 fps epilogue scene pls    I cried the first time wrytan dies           Post Tiger. Please        I teared up. please don't tell anyone...    I don't want it to be over already.   Minor fact: the cat in ep3 voiced by Inu-tan.     &gt;Cock spends most of her day sleeping in a fucking tree  Complains why Chu-tan is having problems by solving the shit her region has.

We'll never understand how furryshit had better sales than this.   furryshit?     Shit By Rocks     Well, did etotama have a game?     ...no ;_;     Ah, "that"    Soon ™    More like "Never™"     did anyone save that Sega Saturn Mock up game cover someone made     Cock's butt getting doubles confirm it.    I wish you were right man    It's okay anon, all we need it's a second season, not a game.    I don't know anon, Cyan was utter shit until the end of the show.  Nyatan was full of WIN.      I wonder why sometimes a series ending feels so bad. for some reason, I feel so sad this time. its like when the train of a fun trip arrives at the station     Cyan was utter shit  nips love utter shit, if you haven't noticed yet that's why it sells there      I understand, SBR came from Sanrio's big name, and also targeting Fujoshi.     One has a game The other does not    I want a kitty cat hat like this.   You could probably find one at an anime convention.    What if I'm bald?    Never game    You would also find unspeakable suffering at an anime convention.    Why would that matter?   This is true.      What would be a good game for Etotama (Well, is too obviously) ? Fighter? Mobage? RPG?      A beat 'em up. Something similar to the Phantom Breaker one.     A 3D fighting game in a similar vein to Anarchy Reign's gameplay but with No More Heroes' level structure (explore Akihabara and make cash to engage in Eto-shin duels, fight enemies and find collectibles throughout said Eto-shin's world, fight Eto-shin with a different gimmick.) You unlock every Eto-shin to play as in new game plus runs, and no two Eto-shins have the same playing style. Also, there would be an online multiplayer mode where you can choose to be any Eto-shin/musume you want and fight to the death in a free-for-all deathmatch.  It will never happen ;_;       either a fighter or cart racer  on the sega saturn.        Being jealous of another show's success     By production values, storytelling, animation CG included.  Etotama beats SbR by curbstomp levels.  Japan is gotta buy CGDCT instead.       Is there a cuter animal that boar?   SbR had some quite alright episodes until Bones just went full retard and tried to force their taste on the show. Their drama was shit, anti-climatic, emotionless and really what made it worst is that Cyan didn't do anything just whine, then out of nowhere just went and saved the day. With a performance that she didn't earn. Really, Cyan never did anything like Nya-tan to deserve a moment like that. With how it turned out, I'd even liked it more if they just did furry CG concerts every episode.       But hello kitty idol show    Only the pygmy ones. Big boars fuck shit up in rural areas regularly.     Yeah, but little ones are so cute and cuddly.    Too bad they're not pets because they're critically endangered.    Critically endangered? Never knew they are. There are quite a number of them in my country.    ~4 hours till HorribleSubs  I want to kill this fucking cunt.   Things are out of control.     I want to give this gentleman a handshake and a pat on the back.   now that's    No dubs allowed you fucking cunt.       55  and it starts    Waiting for subs is killing me.

Hayato is cute.      RIP thread   Gahamama deserves better than being a fucking dubspost.  Please moot, take it easy with dubs in this thread.   dud confirm   This season made it clear to me why people dislike Commie and why it's never ever worth waiting to watch a series they sub ever again.   It took you that long?    in case you missed it before. season 3 in the works with the man himself Watari assisting. hope he doesn't pull a Nasu.   Did any anon sub this episode? Or should I Horriblesubs?  Poor thread.  We definitely became the worst fanbase to ever step on /a/ tonight   I regret nothing       Yui a best.   Can't read that   i want to fuck ebina  So... doujins of Gahamama when?  Why the fuck is Spyro translating Volume A when he hasn't even finished Volume 11 yet?  Or did he steal that one anon's translation?     Too bad that's just the synopses for 12 and 13.    Weren't those just the synopsis for episodes 12 and 13?   I want to  make love to   Gahamama   please do tell where you read that in there. Because then I must be blind since I can't see anything there that suggests that.    dubs are the cancer killing anime   I avoided Commie in the first place because I heard bad things about their subs, but since they subbed Yahari, I said fuck it and decided to tough it out. Never again.    Doesn't have his copy of the book yet. He's only translated what's available to him so far, which are the scans that have been posted up since Tuesday or whenever.     good thing this thread is devoid of them      I wish he'd translate Yukino's fucking diary. He did Yui's but we already had that one.  I thought Spyro was a Yukinofag. I guess there's something painful in it.       Now that's alpha.   Did storm finally ended?   dud was genuine      CommieEOPs discarded      Ye- uh...      WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT    STOP    You just start it      looks like it didn't     ERASE ALL DUBS   check it for yourself     It's happening. Again.    I guess moot is an irohafag after all.  <br/>   If anything you're the AWOL TL'r. Go back to slacking off at commie.      STOP T O P       What the fuck is happening?     Nice dubs yourself as well    Thanks a lot faggot!    moot confirmed for Irohafag   no dubs beyond this post   Confirmed.  God damn..      Greatness.     who confirmed for whofag?       We'll see about that.   sure mate  mods send assistance   Phew.    Now that's alpha.    yeah ok buddy   Let's be smart and bring this off   I love this meme    mad twitter nuthugger detected    You might be right.     So, it has been asked multiple times which girls will take rejection the worst. Let's change the question. Which girl's rejection will make 8man suffer the most? Yukino or Yui?   I think we're finally finished.    h-he did it?   These dubs are all part of Haruno's masterplan.   It's not a meme  let him sleep, anon      Please yest.   WAIT FOR IT  It was fun while it lasted. Post best girl instead.   Nothing can stop the holy power   Make it stop.  Ass still better than tiatas     based    Sick my post got in it. I am now apart of history and will never be forgotten.    Posting best girl.   You killed it.       Don't worry you can meme all day all you want. I've already seen the episode and read the novel. You're not baiting anyone unless you get some sick dubz.      I refuse.    So much for that, huh <br/>    Is this what they define as hell ?   yeah except these    I'll have to disagree.    Your words shall be heard     my divine power only lasted 25 posts  Welp.      Nope     you son of a bitch   the dubs will stop if we all work together and believe in ourselves  Reminder that YukinoSHITa is worst girl.    AWOL TL'r  Wait, but doesn't the guy who's tweeting (herkz? or something) know Japanese?  I thought that, as a subbing outfit, they would have more than one person who is fluent in the language and would have many people who can perform a translation?       i dont remember from which episode is this reaction face    You had one job anon, one job damnit. <br/>     How about these?    Yes, and you are making it no better.    yes, you just confirmed it   Irohasu? いろはす     I can't believe it happened.    Where is mods?  I just want the subs to get here so dub spamming stops.   You tell me    Yes, thanks to you.     They'll be along shortly to autosage this thread.     Welp, the dubs are back.    BELIEVE IT JUST LIKE NARUTO    he's gone bro       The ride keeps going.     no thanks to you trip dubs       double triple dubs   Holy fucking shit, it's happening again.        <br/>     228800   no hope       trip dub  noice     Do you remember this face      Stop it already, just stop, please.         Noice.       Just accept it. Nothing can contain Haruno now.    Confirmed.    Sure.     I never got dubs and i it happened two times ? This is not going to end well.     I DEMAND THAT THE DUBS BE STOPPED     Yes they should have multiple TL'ers But not everyone is interested in doing the same shows since maybe they have no interest in them and TL'ing something you don't particularly like is a bore.    I want to sleep, please make it stop.   episode 1, ramen scene   quads  what if commie are dubs posting?  If dubs, commie uploads their subs in 5 minutes.   NOT WITH THOSE DUBS YOU CANT   Iroha will stop the dub posting with these lack of dubs!    77     YOU ONLY MAKE IT WORSE       triple-dubs  Good job faggot.     Well, how did that work out?      Iroha can't stop nothing. She is but a mere pawn in Haruno's game.    and you fail KOG       read secondary English translation   watched the third world Spanish sub   pls go nuthugger       stop it   If you all commit suicide right now the dubs will stop   pls stop    these dubs shall continue    I give.

I give up.     no dubs below that line -----------------------------------<wbr>-----------------------------------<wbr>----</wbr></wbr>    Iroha won't win  I resign my fate to this.    what is dead may never die   <br/>   i hope you are right   <br/>   fuuck   if dubs subs get delayed till next week   Not sure why but FEEL really did downplay all the Yui scene in episode 13. Maybe Watari already told them it is going to be a Yukino end,  or maybe they are just trying to make Yui as tragic as possible.   三人でのデートについて八幡は二人きりで八幡が誘った上でシーに行くつも<wbr>りだったから</wbr>   結衣にいきなり呼び出されて三人でデートすることになったことに不満を感<wbr>じていて</wbr>   でも約束がなくなった訳じゃないからいつか二人で行けるかもしれないし今<wbr>日は三人でいいかって言ってる</wbr>    八幡はお礼として差し出されたクッキーにお礼以外の特別な感情を期待して<wbr>た</wbr>   だから「礼なら済んでる」と探りを入れたんだが   特別な感情を込めていることを隠して結衣はお礼を強調したことにショック<wbr>を受けてる</wbr>    こういった八幡が結衣に対して抱いてる感情を読み取れるモノローグをカッ<wbr>トしてるから</wbr>   アニメだけだともう結衣は完全に芽がないようにしか見えない                  Yui will win.

I want to get off Mr Bones' Wild Ride    I-I never get dubs...   ahahahaha   Iroha worst girl   Well, my line wasn't strong enough, I guess.     9 posts      last week fucked around and got a triple double     Confirmed.

Trips dont lie      Irohasu~    I like you   So this is what happens when Commie is late with their subs, huh.   Well, I'm glad the mods are asleep.     Iroha confirm for dud solider    Confirmed. One more for the pile of Iroha gets.   And another one.       Because if they were being "fair" at ep 13 it will really eclipse Yukino's presence. Since S2 is really rich of Yui's big moments. And at least, 3 of them are 1:1 adaptation with very little alteration.    Neither did you.     00  we still can hope    fuck commie piece of shit fucking HorribleSubs at 1 am and you know what im goona fucking stay up for that shit like some crazy weeb but im NOT jesus FUCK    tfw trips     I-I'll try. Yukino a shit     Yo herkz, I know you're in this thread. How about you post some dubs on your twitter?   Haruno did nothing wrong.  It's lost guys.  What if Jaka and Herkz are in talks right now to delay HorribleSubs's release just to make you guys angry?  I am light, I am one too strong to fight. Return to dark where shadows dwell, be vanquished with this dub spell!   No dubs beyond this post.     57posters   it's almost time to decide    uh, you don't get to bring dubs   How much input does Watari have? No girl is going to be eliminated when the novels are still ongoing. Thats just bad business     gets dubs himself    Are the dubs finally over?  I blame myself for ever believing in Commie    Yes.     checked   Only one man can save us from all those dubs.

No, you definitely missed the mark.   I want to hold hand sexually with Yui.  Threesome end confirmed by watari on phone   He's just shitposting, faggot.     Extreme homophobia   implying it's bad      He is also bald    In fact, she did absolutely everything and then some right.     It's bad just as your dubs you motherfucker.    HARUNO IS SHIT    duds power in here.     All the Yukino spaghetti  She's so fucking autistic    No he didn't, you fail.    God agrees.  Iroha best btw.      Confirmed. We /pol/ now.     ☑ Preventing KyoAni from adapting the continuation of FMP   Thank God for Daiz      The dubs always contradict each other.   No more dubs.    Well fuck me.      HARUNO IS SHITTING ON ALL THE OTHER GRILLS BY BEING BEST GRILL  ftfy      It's never over    8man is based of yugi   never      my dubs banishing spell lasted 29 posts  At least I tried.     well it is time to end this   Don't be mean     horriblesubs   giving a single fuck   "b-but they do"   Fuck off.       Dubs?    True king  I hate pretenders. I wish KoG would destroy them all.    That's it, I've had enough. It's 4am here, and I was supposed to get up early tommorow. If I DON'T get dubs, I'm going to sleep.  what is goin on?!?!   Show's over Yugi-boy.   Will the pain ever stop ?  Is it over?   Are you just pretending to be retarded or have you really only been here a week?    Dubs.    volume 11 pretty much nails it that Hachiman loves Yukino   most nips agree too now    /a/ still carrying out stupid waifuwar and shitposting   So what really makes this kind of difference? Language barrier? Severe autism and reading comprehension crisis thanks to the Burgerland education?        My only failure is not working hard enough to not have a 10/10 Gahama in my life.   I was once called the Yaharithread of Tripfags. Let's see if that's true.   I wonder about this as well. It's as if they don't want the Yuifags to buy their BD.  Also worth to note that out of all the girl 8man NEVER blush to Yui in the anime, whereas in the LN there are multiple instances where he goes dokidoki and embarass/jelly about Yui.    you probably can't read moon but read <br/>            STANDING    thanks moot   Checking for Iroha  Fuck off   It's never over. Welcome to hell.     ON THE EDGE    Dubs allow, you may have some Gahama in your life.  Yeah, thanks.  Why         dubs    God damnit.      FUCK. By one second.     confirmed   The storm is over. Let us move on to more important issues now.  Ctrl+F: WA2   0 results       Most of /a/ doesn't like Yukinon you idiot. That's why the waifuwar is happening.  She's not that interesting a character, when the supporting cast is several magnitude orders BETTER. Minus Yui, she's a ditsy retard who'd be a really good fuck and dump.        OF SACRETA     Dubs!    Nice.    I see. You're not very devoted to anything in your life. Well have fun, maybe next time you can get some sort of repeating digits.      Yeah, like checking my digits        STOP        Feels good, huh?   Confirmed. Yukino is shit.        04:11:11    127229699  damn      What     I check em       <br/>      Isn't it sad? First her sister is so much better than her and now anon's dubs take a dump all over her.   man thats amazing  9999 when   OF TRIPS    damn    Daamn     wanting 9999 more that subs  Sincerely fuck off.     In japan, it's 11:11:11   No dubs over this post.   No, I've still got a lot of hard work to do.  Starting with being able to proofread two or three simple-ass lines of text.   But it's worth it. She's worth it.       Are yahari threads usually this good? This one is much better than the others I've looked at      trip    Evil dub spirit standing tall, it's time you made your greatest fall. Return to hell thou evil shite, I banish with this holy light! So fuck off and leave my sight and take with you this endless night!  No dubs beyond this post.    Shiki Tohno is the protagonist of the last series you watched/read. How easily does he kill everyone and rape the bitches?  Shiki is a power fantasy for idiots which only a twelve-year-old would think was cool.  Well I've just completed Arc's route in the Tsukihime VN, I'm reading the manga and I'm watching Kara no Kyoukai so eh.  That's not Tohno who's the murderer tho, it's Nanaya.     Danmachi   Oh boy. Shiki would have a field day.     This   I want to protect his smile.   24  Same shit but with a knife instead of Jack Bauer's feet.    Shirou is more of a power fantasy than Shiki is though.    Welcome to TM.     ASOIAF  So does he replace every POV character? There's no designated protagonist for the entire series.     Shokugeki no Soma   Can he cook?      dubstep  OVER THE LINE     There is more than enough Shiki's to go around.    fuck no shiki fits that's description a lot more, not to say shirou isn't one. he's like the tatsuya equivalent of type moon     Shiki replaces every POV character in ASOIAF  Can Shiki kill Others?     Shiki isn't even as strong as Shirou at max power. Nanaya Shiki is an experienced killer but he is still a human bean.     He put garlic on the noddle he served to a vampire. Does that count ?    Nisekoi  He raped all the bitch. Shoe included.        Shiki does not fit that description  Shiki is a natural talent all-rounder. Shirou is an as long as you work hard and aspire to be great, you will be great type of shonenfag fagot.  Shiki's that type of guy you hate because he's great at athletics even without trying, makes women suck his cock even if he's a shithead, and apparently has a huge penis even if he's Japanese.  Damn, now I'm getting angry.          Shokugeki no Souma  So he just fucks Erina after she talks shit?       So is Shirou    Shirou gets servant level stats from projecting weapons that do the fighting for him since he also projects their entire history. Shiki is a kid with a butter knife.     No he doesn't. Even when he "won" his fight with Archer it was only because Archer was holding back the entire time and Gil is retarded. He is only human physically just like Shiki.    do you not know what a power fantasy is. its a im as strong and A+ at everything without even trying. getting stronger through hard work annd virtue is the exact opposite of a power fantasy    Then bring it up with the rest of the UBW fanbase as that is what they tell me all the time instead of acknowledging that Gil can move faster than Shirou can perceive yet couldn't dodge him is a plot hole.    its not, im pretty sure everyone said he didn't acknowledged shirou and refused to get serious against him. he only tried to swallow his pride and summon ea at the last moment when it ws too late. if gilgamesh or archer had been anywhere near serious from the get go every else would stand no chance    Umm. No. A male power fantasy doesn't include being a murderous jackass that rapes women.  Chivalrous knight types that can cook well and do a shitload of other things like sports and machine repair is power fantasy. That is why the American comic superhero industry is said to be filled with male power fantasies of the great men that have everything.   In case you forgot, in FSN, you are the adopted son of a rich faggot who dies early leaving you wealth and property all to your lonesome self and you can improve yourself as a result. That's fucking Iron Man/Batman there.         That's fucking Iron Man/Batman there.  I just noticed it. Fate has a lot in common with Batman.     Does literally standing in one spot and letting someone hit you count as not taking it seriously? Servants can move at mach speed. Shirou had to preemptively block to block Lancer's spear. If Nasu actually stuck to the stats, Gil could have slapped Shirou when he got close and beheaded him before Shirou could even realize Gil moved his arm.      Because Gil was not taking him seriously till it was too late. The stats copying thing is mentioned in UBW description but he never actually uses the that ability. He only copies Archer's since Archer's style is the logical perfect style for Shirou.    It's time.   how about those comiket numbers?   Haikyuu　938 (+204) Kuroko no Basket　934 (-244) Yowamushi Pedal　860 (+132) Touken Ranbu　648 (+648) Shingeki no Kyojin　574 (+88) TIGER&amp;BUNNY　572 (-82) Hetalia　368 (+14) Free　352 (-152) VOCALOID　344 (-20) Fate　288 (-4) Gintama　234 (-12) Prince of Tennis　228 (+4) Sengoku BASARA　224 (-114) UtaPri　212 (-54)  JJBA　206 (+20)                  it's an abstract kind of homo  This time, it's time  LEGALLY    Nothing to be surprised there, except maybe  VOCALOID　344 (-20)  Why are people into that again?     Do you enjoy BL CD dramas? Tell me your favorites!   Oshioki Salesman, never 4get.    My nigger.    Is it really worth having to read the translation simultaneously? I've been too lazy to give it a chance because of that     Haikyuu　938 (+204)     Hell no, what? It's just porn. Just listen to it.    But I don't understand japanese   relatively soon™   Goddamn that's going to be a bitch to clean.    I heard that doujinshis are over. You will have to fap to JR alikes now.     Most are expect, but kinda surprised by haikyuus position.     Nia still won't do more doujin   Fucking Shingeki     Why does the next season seem so devoid of homo?    It does?    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127215255  Shinoashitter gtfo, I may like her too, but you do not belong here.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127215255  What happened? Christ, can't I stay away for a couple of days     Stop responding, they feed off of attention.     It was just some autist spamming dumb shit in a thread about gay couples. Nothing to get excited about.    Ooh so it was someone from outside these threads? I thought the beef was between homodachis, if I had known I wouldn't have asked    They're really going all out with those two, aren't they? Which is funny considering how irrelevant they were in the manga.    Just like every other season. At least we get this      Japanese television isn't ready for what they COULD have drawn in explicit detail. What if it's "uncensored" in the BD?    We actually got to see homo kisses this season in non homo shows  I hope this becomes the norm from now on    It's interesting how the top 3 are shounenshit with barely any homo in them.  So the theory about fujos preferring not to get pandered to directly and wanting to come up with their own gay delusions is true.     Huh? In what show?    Somehow Prince of Tennis still being popular makes me feel warm. I graduated from it years ago(though I watched some recent OVA) but it's so deeply set in homolust culture.    Well, not just any shounen, they're all sports anime.    Anon, please    Sports anime with majority male characters is all it takes.   Why are twins so good  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127216151  They were definitely awful but I'm pretty sure anon was referring to the Shinoa shitflinging, which was unrelated to the Free bullshit.    Sports series are the Fujo Mahou Shojo. Can't go wrong with them.     Is this the Mahou Shounen thing? Rips when.    Gangsta might be good if you put on your goggles.    My copy won't arrive until a week or two from now, so I hope somebody uploads it before then.    Yes but that's from second CD which is out in August. They are voiced by Tsubasa Yonaga. The first CD was out this week, I'm still waiting for mine and could provide a rip if there's no one out by then(might take a while though).    OTP T P       pink shoulders  Dropped     Neat. Tsubasa Yonaga voiced mai waifu.    There are at least two actual homo shows.    Isn't that just because they're blushing? The dudes that give no fucks don't have them    Looks super interesting.    X will never get a proper ending  Fuck everything.    Not really, fujos love No6. It's just that usually gay shows are terrible and romanceshit (see Nakamurashit or Love Stage). I'm convinced that a show with a plot like Tiger&amp;Bunny with actual gay main characters would be a huge success among fujos.     Tiger&amp;Bunny  Is it gay or homobaiting?     Look carefully.    Bait but there's also a canon gay character who gets a surprisingly serious character arc in the movie.    If I'm not wrong the staff said that the relationship between Barnaby and Kotetsu could also be interpreted "that" way.    Oh shit, my bad It's not very noticeable because of the scan quality but now I see the glow     In my opinion, if they say it can be "interpreted" it is bait    Yeah, anything can be interpreted. If they don't deliver it in canon then it's just empty words.    You're waifu a slut.    Is CLAMP's artstyle really that different now that it would be pointless in trying to finish it? I haven't really kept up with them so I have no idea what their current style looks like.   It was going to be a suffering ending anyway.    Their were a lot of talks this week about some sort of drama within Sunrise with Ozaki leaving and BNP being their own thing now. Apparently Ozaki took the T&amp;B right with him. Not sure if any of this is true but can anyone confirm this?   Pic related Young Black jack character designs.

Is the short with Reo raping Takao out yet?   Birdmen bodies are lewd.   Wait, you mean they aren't married already?     Suit even keeps the ass cheeks separate.  I wonder about the crotch area now, this is pure doujin material.     KyoAni's fear of doing something besides obvious subtext.    Haru a cute     interpretation is allowed  Maybe in general, but I dunno about the case of your pic related.   Why, Kurata?         the joke   your head      what was this thing called again?    Actually, that only makes their love stronger and purer.    Mahou x Shounen x Days      Cheers, I knew it was a mahou shounen something.    G-Gomen.    Danshi-seme 3-bon Shoubu. It's one of the few situation CDs where MC (listener) tops the guys instead of bottoming.    Go men!     Studio Feel  This made me laugh much harder than it should have.      Hetalia　368 (+14)  I'm surprised this still has fans. I thought it had its time and disappeared.     Doujins keep it alive in perpetuity.    I was more surprised to see a PV for OVAs recently. They must still be selling official books and keyrings.   I was going to say "post you're hubando" in celebration of recent events in Clapistan, but I don't want to shorten this thread's lifespan.  Someone should make a husbando thread, though.     My Brother's Husband  Does he steal his dead brother's husband?      What I like about these threads is any politics related shit isn't brought up. But you should make a thread.     B-But my husbando isn't manly enough to start a husbando thread.     no more gay alien kissing men in season 2  I'm gonna miss the Katze kisses and molestation.      wants to start husbando thread cuz muh gay rights   doesn't want to start it off because husbando isn't manly  Progress starts with you.     I now proudly present Suimenka (Behind Closed Doors), affectionately known as Crying Kansai Boys.    https://www.sendspace.com/file/v7gj<wbr>gp</wbr>   The tears were absolutely delectable. Harada is like the Tomino of BL, except there haven't been any actual dead bodies yet. Waiting warmly for that day.  The gigantic double-sided poster of the Hen-Ai guys came too, but I'm still patching that together in photoshop.         I forgot how lewd it was for him to use his thumb to separate Jou's lips.    Next season seems to be full of haremshit LNs and ecchishit, looks like it'll be a backlog season for me outside of Working!!!, Non Non and a few original wildcards.     tagame  This doesn't devolve into guro torture porn half way in, right?       It's getting a yet another new season this summer, the whole thing is ONA as usual.        <br/>      Thank you    I don't understand the Haikyuu craze when it's regular sports shounen shit with absolutely no homo and unappealing designs unless you're into little boys. Same with yowapeda. I understand Kuroko since the boys look delicious and it's at least a bit homo.     unappealing designs  I like them, KnB guys are better for wanking over but the Haikyuus are cuter.     If you find that cute, might as well fap to hamsters.    Okay    I don't watch any of them, but I think the Haykyuus look better than the Kurokos (they have great bodies but they look too generic).     unless you're into little boys  I am.     They look more like birds or lizards.    If you think the Kurokos look like anything but dogshit, you need to get your eyes checked.    Lizards, exactly.   They still look miles better than Your average Nip salaryman looks like a model next to these.   You mean ugly little boys.           You're just shitposting at this point.    Stop it, Haikyuufriends are untrollable.  I'll give you a true and best lizard.      They look like dogshit only when they look like haikyus.      someone asks a legitimate question and has a different opinion than you    hurr durr shitposter  Never change, faggots.      Oh God. I have been waiting for this for so long. Thank you, anon! It's translated suffering time.    Yes, I put yowapeda in the same bag.    Fuck off with that random 3DPD jew    Ok.      Thank you. There are many good things in Harada's stuff and when it ends it leave you speechless and feeling empty. I know this but I keep repeating the process, fuck.    Too bad homo was killed when Tooru was paired up with the nurse.     perfection  But those recessive chins. They look like mouth breathers.     Their personalities are great and while the original art style isn't hot - it's cute rather - the designs are good and the fanart can definitely make them attractive.     unless you're into little boys  Nothing wrong with that.     Mah nigga. Is there going to be a fourth one?   So homodachi, what's your opinion on gay toddlers?    toddlers  'no'      thinking fucking 3 year olds mean it romantically  "no"     Toddlers are disgusting, even when gay.  Grown men acting like toddlers, on the other hand, is adorable.      uh    BASED    I will never understand this fetish     Vertical  They barely do anything alternative anymore. There was a book focusing on gay manga and Tagame that was published by Fantagraphics so it would probably be something they'd license, especially with Matt Thorn and Chip Kidd working there.     Damn.     Grown men acting like toddlers, on the other hand, is adorable.   I can only feel pity for such a man. A real deep pity, the kind where you feel a knot in your stomach.      Mah nigga. Saiminjutsu Nyuumon is also pretty good.     Is he using Osaka-ben?    Sorry, I hadn't read yet.    this guy knows his shit   homodaps       Well, to be fair the phrasing of his answer leaned more toward the suggestion that the homo interpretation is the preferred one, he also ended with a "and I'm counting on your imagination" bit. Then there're the OP and ED lyrics for the movies which, when confirmed to be from MC's POV, written in accordance with the script are almost always blatantly and indisputably gay. To me it looks more like they show whatever they can, but their corporate laws will never allow them to go full gay.   Yes it's confirmed. Actually, if I'm not mistaken Sunrise is the property of Bandai, not the other way around, therefore it would be more accurate to say Bandai decided to split their intellectual properties between Sunrise (all it has left are gundams) and BNP which took everything else. Ozaki is the managing director of the company, and T&amp;B is said to be their flagship property. Sunrise only cared about gundams anyway, so having a separate company to manage other works seems like a favorable outcome. The only thing that worries me is that Tamura was left with Sunrise, and he is one of the five main creators of T&amp;B. Here's the full list of what BNP took: http://www.bn-pictures.co.jp/        Thank you and the anons that helped. That was a very sad, disturbing, and arousing reading. As expected from Harada..      he also ended with a "and I'm counting on your imagination" bit  Who was it that gave the statement anyway?  I hope Sunrise whips up some new IPs soon. As much as I like Gundam they've burned themselves out with too much of it many times before.

I mean, I've already gone over it six times and used anki to learn every word that I knew would be in it, but its a small victory!   Yes. I did the first book and I didn't bother making my own stories (outside of a few) because I don't think it's worth it. Stories for all 3007 Kanji are already made and I took advantage of that.     No. You're not even scratching the doorknob.    Beginner question  What is the difference between 終わりにする and 終わる?      buying the book  Sorry you made a shit decision and now feel that you need to justify it.    Opening: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=STg<wbr>4Ya8bEFo</wbr>  [ ]  Reminder: Sequel coming out in Fall      Underwater Ray Romano   Finally I know how to pronounce it        Did you not play the game? She asked to be sexed by Hakuro, she wanted to give birth to his baby. Oboro was super protective as a brother so it was a tough final request, he sat down with Hakuro and got drunk as he could before finally begging him to listen to his request since he couldn't say it while sober.  He was able to convince Hakuro that this was important and to please give it a shot since his sister wanted it, before he finally passed out and was dragged to his room by the traps.  Course he let her get fucked, since that was her wish entirely. It was one of the only sex scenes in the game where Hakuno wasn't just raped by the girl as well.       So is every new mask guy gonna secretly be Godzilla or was that a one time thing?   original utawarerumono was 9 years ago   Any prediction for chapter 34?    The only thing I want to know about is about Our Hero Amon and his Batgirl Kuro.    When will Haise have time to complete his kakuja? He could eat faggyama maybe   Damn, I wonder how strong he'd get if he ate Tatara, Noro, or pineapple.  I imagine that he would need to go full kakuja to beat Arima or Eto.       When will Haise   Haise  Reaching this point with that pussy still acting like someone splits on his faces whenever someone connects him with Kaneki, Haise is going to die crying because someone called him Kaneki.       You know I mean Kaneki / Kaneki after he absorbs Haise    Yeah I agree. He might be able to keep up with Arima without it eventually, but that's probably it. If Arima has time to set up IXA mines he needs Full kakuja        I know we just had a thread yesterday or so but new PV is out: https://<span>youtu.be/3jE9moHQePI  [ ]   7th needs to hurry up   And people say that summer isn't real, fucking kill yourself faggot   <br/>   I've been here for two years, retard Kill yourself with your summer boogeyman maymay     are you this retarded. Kill yourself faggot.   COOMMIE WHERE DA FUQ ARE MY SUBS??     Still praying for BD version of it, because it does seem like they cut it.    They might have cut it simply because there's no romantic resolution any time soon, so animating it would give a massive lead-up into anything.    into nothing*   they can't translate non translated material  The ponytail strikes back   But they've got the novels. Regardless of what happens in the anime, that so far has done nothing but bait so an original yuri end is more than unlikely, they can still enjoy the source material. Hetero already won. Now they're going for the second bowl.     Adorable. I'm really hoping for a second season     &gt;/a/ never had moments like this at school    You'll all never have a cherry blossomed school life. Ever.      You should know by now most of us don't think there will be a yuri or a definite romance. People just ship what they want. The threads are already not as crazy as they used too.     the problem with citing wikipedia is that it can only ever give you broad generalizations. according to that list nearly everyone has some sort of disorder at some point in their lives. have you ever been nervous talking to someone for any reason? grats you have impaired verbal communication. ever met someone you don't get along with? huzzah, impaired social interaction.  having lived with a family member with certified, professionally diagnosed autism, Reina is barely on the scale and even that's up to interpretation.    </blockquote>]
