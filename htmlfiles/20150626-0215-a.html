Poor slut, always getting cockblocked by her sister.  How relevant is Rin? I'm considering picking this up just for her.   She's Scamco and Japan's favorite girl, although she doesn't really have as huge a presence in the anime as you'd think aside from the first few episodes That being said she's complete garbage and there are a  Miria d of better girls to watch the show for      aside from the first few episodes  How kind of them to put the girl I'm most interested in in the beginning episodes. I guess I'll add it to my backlog then, if only for the first few episodes.     she is the worst girl, don't bother    There must be a reason Japan likes them so much though.     Oh Generic straight dark haired beauty-sama please step on me  Rin a shit     Don't listen to  Rin is great.     While Uzuki is better.  Suffering soon.       Uzuki is a cutie.

I beg to differ    Why is Producer-San the most moe character    Generic rapeface-san    I want to play with Kaede.    Drinking games?  (You'll probably lose, you know.)     These lips have sucked dick.   Hmph; I won't lose to a girl.   I never got into this whole iM@s-thing and the girls I've seen in these threads have been kind of bland. Recently I've been seeing a lot of this Kaede girl on the front page and she looks really cute and hot. Is she a new addition to the franchise or has she been around for a while? This is a first time in a while that I actually have committed a folder for a girl I know absolutely nothing about.    She's been around for a while.     You have a good taste muh niggah. Here's some choco.    You mean, woman.    Her actor/singer is Saori Hayami, a wonderful singer. Definitely do try "Koi Kaze" and "Yuki no Hana".   Why is this thread back in /a/, I thought you guys got booted to /vg/.   There is no Cinderella Girls thread in /vg/            I want to get rape by Kaede.    My bad bruh "real woman" she is.      Cheers, bruv.      Is she telling me to sit down?    How can a character I know absolutely nothing about be so infatuating. I have absolutely no interest in idolfaggotry stuff but I almost feel compelled to get into it just because of her.    She's guessing you can't stand up straight.    I hope you like bad punsters. (You do now.)      whens the new pv    Too bad bruh cuz the anime lacks cakes. But Rin is ok; I guess.    My brother.   The best images keep her heterochromia subtle.

Whiskey   from a mug   Oh shit nigga, what the fuck are you doing.      So it's safe in this thread to wish for more actual women instead of teen girls in the second cour?    not splashing your coffee with bourbon  Not an anarchist are you?      Wants actual women   Posts a bratty 17 year old.      sake with a splash of sake    Yeah I have pixiv but I got this on google awhile ago. Didnt bother changing it tho.    Is that a pun?    Why brother?; Im sure its gonna taste like cake.    So will the second cour make her suffer?    I bet he was a fucking loser in high school...    He was  genuine      ...     Does he even have hobbies?  Even 2011 Producer said he liked playing some vidya every now and then.      What TakeP is already 30?    Is that a thumbnail? http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=49258869</wbr>     Nah, thats just fan speculation.  He's probably AT MOST 30. But realistically, he's probably in his mid twenties. We're at least sure that he's older than AkaP.     Chibiki or horrible for cinderella?   Hanging out with his former boy idol bandmates? (He was the "little brother" / shota type.)    He was a fox at 22  I wonder when the first time he and Kaede hooked up.      Chibiki isn't even complete.    So he was Nozaki-kun in highschool?     I wonder when the first time he and Kaede hooked up.  Tone down the delusion, please.     The good, and bad, thing about HS is that CR's subs are usually just good enough. Not great, not terrible.  Having said that, I was getting weird errors with some of the subs. Don't know if it was because of them or something on my end.     All of my love for Kaede.   CR subs for CG fuck up their translations alot. They get things outright wrong quite a few times.  Their russian script gets corrupted into whatthefuckery too.        Didn't know being able to notice affection through their interactions meant delusion. Sorry for understanding more than you?    Chibiki are great but they're not complete. Just watch as much as you can from Chibiki and then watch HS.    Such a beatiful language    I bow down to you, master of human relationship that can translate a short greeting and eye contact into a long and winding love story.   Seriously, chill man. I'm just kidding. Didn't you see my image is basically TakeP x Kaede?       Chibiki has more accurate translations but the way they take liberty with a few things is annoying.  Case in point: Miku's retarded Meows and Kirari's general autist speak. Chibiki also tends to insert figures of speech (which are still contextually correct and fitting to the dialogue) that are admittedly jarring at times.  I like how they approached Anya though. Technically, there isn't really anything wrong with Anya's flow of spoken Japanese, but she does speak with weird intonations and accents.  The way Chibiki attempted to get this across was by making subs for Anya appear as broken english. I find it a cute touch.           Just saiyan, HS is Daisuki not CR.    Post underrated idols.   When, suddenly--   Going on onsen excursions with Kaede!   TakeP is a cyborg silly.  He was never a shota.        Two busty idols appeared       onsen      What the hell...?     Is Sachi tasty?    [x] offer her some dictation      I want Kaede to send me a pic of her.     Kaede will never try to eat you.  Unfair.     Did someone say "onsen"?    I remember AkaP being 20-21 so mid-20/late-20 would be right.    Why is this hag so popular?    There needs to be more Terminator spoofs, considering that a robot will die this Friday.    Takeuchi is surrounded by girls that much older than him in recording studio    sole main guy in the cast    Lucky bastard.      Does he have any new roles lined up yet?    You and me, together.     Hello, Operator? I think I've PENUS'd.     Hegochin is so cute.    I love huge tits, but those are too big for her. Modest handfuls are perfect.     17 year old   Also, here is him and Akabane at a recent im@s event with Kirari and some slut from ML   http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm26<wbr>112123</wbr>   Takeuchi imitates Kirari's "NYOWA HAPPY HAPPY" at 0:36 but Kirari doesn't like what she hears.          Let's not cast doubt on this pure maiden's chastity, if possible.     Between the hags and lolis.   Are collage aged idols no good?   They are no good plotwise for most anime because they are more mature thinkers. Most of the simplistic anime plots need immature behavior and bad decision making from the characters in order to carry the plot forward. Such behavior is acceptable from young cute middle school and even some teenagers. But when it occurs by college-aged characters or college graduates, it is unacceptable and UNcute. The audience would reject such characters.  So that is why college-aged and college-grads are ruled out of many plots. The audience simply expects better behavior from them and that would wreck or complicate the story design of most anime series. For example, you expect the thinking, maturity, treatment of issues, and performance level of chars in Legend of the Galactic Heroes to be substantially better than from chars in Highschool DxD or iDOLM@STER.         Please be my mom, Miyu!       17 years old   I still can't wrap my head around the fact that his natural voice is this fucking deep.  Also, Rei Matsuzaki's reaction to his NYOWA is priceless. You can practically hear "YOU THINK NYOWA-ING IS A MOTHERFUCKING GAME?" from her displeased face.       What is Nana's talent?   Being an adorable 17 year old.   Next chapter will be the ultimate ending, are you ready to be butthurt?  Also did you enjoy the gaiden?     I'm going with option 3. It's the best we can hope for really.   MODS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!   It'll be FRIENDSHIP and UNDERSTANDING and LOVE. It was fun though    Is it confirmed the next chapter is the final or you're pulling stuff out of your ass?    I'm glad Sarada is being sidelined for the movie now.  She's worthless to me now. I seriously haven't been this mad over anything 2 dimensional in a while.       It's a shame. She is adorable and had a nice entry, then she gets reduced into the depths of being a mini-Sakura.    Ahaha, and yet you were laughing at Sakurafags. This fucking irony.     Why are you guys upset at her super strength?     goddamn sakura looks so disgusting in that picture    Does it mean Hinata is back to being best girl?     goddamn sakura looks so disgusting  Fixed.     1010 has that spot. hinata can be 2nd best girl though.    They are Sakurafags.  Most people don't give a shit about Sakura. Lovers or haters, both are fans.       back to   implying it changed       western_lesbians_adopt_eleven.jpg    so what happened with salad in the last page?    i'm just glad narusara ntr wankfest is over.     wait next chapter is last chapter of gaiden?  wat      Because it might mean she will have a fighting style like that of Sakura, which has a long, long history if being ridiculously useless. Sarada deserves better than being like her stepmother. It also throws the fuck out the supposed rivalry she was to have with Bolt. I mean, come on, a prodigy mini-Naruto trained by Sasuke and Naruto v. a mini Karin with the lowest tier of Sharingans trained by Sakura. That is just sad an upsetting.       implying she ever was       her stepmother   Anon, please, the icing on this garbage cake will be that it was all a MISUNDERSTANDING. Not only will Sarada be mini-Sakura in spirit, but in blood too. Compelling character arc? OP Uzumaki genes? Who cares about that? As long as SS fangirls get what they want.       No, Hinata is Best Mum. She ceased to be best girl when she became a woman. Best girl now is Himawari.      Because it might mean she will have a fighting style like that of Sakura, which has a long, long history if being ridiculously useless.  When used by Sakura, who has no talent other than Chakra control. Sarada, as an Uchiha, has picked it up without all the years of training the Sakura required. And being an Uchiha, she will be able to mix it other techniques she picks up along the way. All it means is that enemies can't melee with her now with nothing short of a Chidori tier technique.  If anything, she's on her way to be Kakashi tier.       Nope, i think it's the last chapter of Sarada's story arc. i doubt kishi want to stop making naruto manga.     this makes more sense but Kishymoto just wants to please fans  I believe I saw identical line in NS posts after 700. Now what does that say about you?     kek'd   Karin has sakura real daughter, sasuke fucked both girls.    Kakashi tier  So a jobber, then. Good to know.     Don't fool yourself, this is Kishi we are talking about here, not someone competent. Tsunade's super punch is far too useful to be ever given proper consideration in fight scenes.      I believe I saw identical line in NS posts after 700.   Why should I care?   Now what does that say about you?   That I'm right and they were retarded.           Nobody ever faulted Sakurafags for being devoted to their waifu. They faulted Sakurafags because there waifu was shit.  Sarada was a good waifu ruined by bad writing.      I knew our time was limited but it was fun to laugh at.  Kishi still fucked up SS more though, all those fanarts and headcanons are still in garbage.     No, I'm pretty sure you're just denying any contradictory fact because of your own feelings toward characters.    Sarada focusing on super strength isn't just out of nowhere, it's the worst that could've happened if that's her focus and not the sharingan.  Kishi has the bad habit of giving his characters more powers than he can remember. They have tons of abilities but stick to their fighting style.  Naruto had the six paths and the tailed beasts? Still fights like the same Naruto from always.  Sasuke, Tobi etc get the rinnengan? Never use its powers.  Since it was unlikely she'd get the everything-proof skeleton shield at twelve, I was hoping she'd fight with the classic sharingan and fight like part I sauce.  Instead, she'll get Sakura's fighting style that in part II focused on clearing mooks nobody cared about, and spending her chakra healing mooks nobody cares about.              At this point I'm just mourning a legit interesting character who might have had neat fights in a possible future full series. But yeah, we had some fun and that's all that matters.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127155408   You don't have t  Did Obito come by and warped you with his ka      Obito couldn't use the Rinnegan's powers because he didn't have both. Same with Sasuke. Just sayin'.     They're not upset over super strength. They're upset because this indicates that she probably is Sakura's (biological) daughter.  It's funny because a few days ago they were bitching about ssfags who turned on Salad as soon as it looked like she wasn't proof that their ship had boned at least once. But now that the opportunity to make jokes about Sakura being cucked is slipping away, they're doing the same thing.       So a jobber, then.  Except she has the Uchiha body like Itachi said. So she will be able to do more with less than Kakashi. The only thing really holding her back is that she will likely never have the sorrow or whatever for the Mangekyo.    Tsunade's super punch is far too useful to be ever given proper consideration in fight scenes.   You don't have to have her one shot everyone. Just keep the enemy in range, like most Ninjas do anyways until the far draws to a close.          But Obito's long de   Sarada has traits from both Sasuke and Sakura and has no traits from Karin.   KARINFAGS ON SUICIDEWATCH      And I'm pretty sure you're just making strawman arguments to sound more intelligent.      &gt;Kishi still fucked up SS more though, all those fanarts and headcanons are still in garbage.  That was true long before Sarada showed up. SS is a truly disgusting pairing.      I know you're joking, but there are actual Karin shippers on /a/? I thought most people simply despised Sakura, Sasquay, or both. And the SS shippers' tears were hilarious.     So why counter it with the same move?    You can have cool weapons, techniques like the lighning rasengan or stretchy arms McOrochimarusspawn OR a big, boring punch. It would get old fast. Kishi may like to stick to the same two attacks per character, but for relevant characters those are kept flashy and kind of interesting. The Tsunade Punch takes up a valuable slot in Sarada's repertoire.       Himawari is going to cry in the movie.      Sarada focusing on super strength isn't just out of nowhere, it's the worst that could've happened if that's her focus and not the sharingan.  She didn't focus on it though. She picked it BECAUSE of the Sharingan. She doesn't even have to train for it anymore. Not to mention if she really does have Karin genetics, she will have the Uzumaki chakra pool to spam it.   Kishi has the bad habit of giving his characters more powers than he can remember. They have tons of abilities but stick to their fighting style.  All that really means though is that this will like be Sarada's finisher. Her fighting style is still relatively unknown but she seems to be pretty mobile with the Uchiha affinity for reading attacks.        Yeah. Except the planet power and the absorption power. The robot power would be too interesting.     I'm not. You're making a false comparison because it suits the purposes of your argument.      that delicious cake made with love  Boruto is the worst villain in the franchise.     Is the next chapter the last one?    I bet she'll just look puzzled at it as Bolt rushes out, she loves her onii-chan.    Implying Sarada isn't a experiment made from Sasuke or   Madara /Karin cooked inside Sakura    What if it was all a ruse by sauce and cuck to trigger her sharingen    And being an Uchiha, she will be able to mix it other techniques she picks up along the way  Hopefully. But I wouldn't hold my breath, I suspect she'll be healing fish pretty soon too.     I thought the super focused punch and shit Sakura learned from Tsunade was taught, not genetic; Sarada could have learned the trick through passively watching because she's seen the punch several times in her life and she's an Uchiha. You know, Kishimoto's attempt at showing its nurture, not nature.   Just here for the drama; I am enjoying the banter between the Karinfags and Sakurafags.       And if Pierrot takes over series once Kishi is done with, they will definitely turn her into a Sakura 2.0, ship tease the hell out of BoruSara and take away what good of her left.    I can't believe that people think sakura can be the real mother just because sarada used her technique, r u guys serious?    She's an Uchiha, she can easily modify it with whatever elemental affinity she has.      cooked  cucked*      her sad backstory is feeling bad for Bolt whose being a shithead distances him from the people closest to him   she is determined to be a good daughter, but more than that help everyone get along   her techniques revolve around cooperation, namely summoning, in the endgame with the Tailed Beasts   her life goal is to gather all the summoning contracts in the world        But I don't the conflict and moral of the story is there and entire situation is perfectly understandable, there's no backpedalling there to please the fans, no retconing, all the evidences of Karin are easily explainable, it's a story Kishimoto decided on, yet you deny any possibility of it because you dislike the character of Sakura.     dips her fist in water   sets fire to her hand       But I wouldn't hold my breath  She's a surviving Uchiha, that's what the remaining elite + Kakashi have all done.    So is Sakura the mother?  I don't want to drag storm 4 talk on /a/ but kaguya, bolt, and sarada were confirmed for the game today <br/>     They're not upset over super strength.   Yes we fucking are. That's what so many of us were on in the last thread. Her having Sakura's super strength means she'll probably just be a Sakura clone.  Whether she's Sakura's bio-kid or not doesn't matter, she's all but stated at this point to be the most useless member of her team because Kishi, instead of giving her anything original is just going to give her Sakura's useless skills.     I am enjoying the banter between the Karinfags and Sakurafags.   Nobody on /a/ cares about Karin except for her genes and the fact that she's a tool to make Sakurafags mad. Stop trying to project shit.               all the evidences of Karin are easily explainable   explain, including the photoshopped family picture.     Think about this:  Sarada can easily heal your bruised dick after you gave it to hear the whole day so that you can continue fucking like rabbits for 2 weeks or more.    We'll find out for certain next issue.   No matter the result, Sasuke is still a deadbeat dad.     Will Bolt have access to byakugan?  I could've sworn this little bastard was gonna be a major part of the Boruto movie, but nope. Squished like a rat. Fucking kek    the conflict and moral of the story is there   the entire moral lesson is pointless if it was all a misunderstanding because it has no relevance to Sarada at all. You just don't write moral lessons into stories just because they're nice moral lessons.   all the evidences of Karin are easily explainable   no it isn't. that's the problem. Occam's Razor tells us the simplest explanation would be Sasuke fucked Karin.           Her having Sakura's super strength means she'll probably just be a Sakura clone.  Why? Because she picked up Sakura's technique without even trying. No, you're right. She and her Sharingan will do nothing else for the rest of her life but throw super punches.     no Karin to cause drama and SS tears this chapter    What photoshopped pictures? Umbillical cord can easily be Salad's, since she was probably born in that very hideout, her appearance is based mostly on Sasuke while the rest is generic look of females in Naruto, eyesight is not restricted to genes only and that's the entire extent of evidences.     Glasses   Huge chakra       No matter the result, Sasuke is still a deadbeat dad.  What are the chances of that being completely glossed over as well?     Did Kishi already forget that Naruto has two kids?    How do you know it's the last?    kek, made by the Lonely Genbu right?    Where the fuck is Karin and why is she being a worse mother than Sasuke is a father?   He already forgot that Sasuke isn't Boruto's mom    Karin being cucked by Sasuke    The photoshopped pictures is anon talking about Sakura pasting a picture of herself over Karin for their 'family photo', I imagine.  The umbilical cord is kept by the mother to symbolize a link between mother and child and it's somewhat srs bsns over there, so Karin having it wouldn't make any sense unless she was either the mother or it was her own.      No, but there is no reason to involve Himawari in this story.  She would only get panel time via Bolt, and he gets the film whereas the downfall of Sarada is the point of the Gaiden.     You know, if this weren't Naruto your sarcasm might be warranted, but you know Kishi has pulled that shit before, and he may just as easily do it again    Hima is too young to fight.     Verbal ticks and power acquired through training are genetic traits.   Body type and fashion sense isn't.  Oh you SShits.   Kishi agrees though.          the entire moral lesson is pointless if it was all a misunderstanding because it has no relevance to Sarada at all. You just don't write moral lessons into stories just because they're nice moral lessons.  Except if you can't have the moral that there's no difference between A and B without outcome being specifically A it's bullshit. Sarada felt diconnected with her parents, after thinking Sakura is not her mother she had to think back and confirm the feelings she has for her as mother.  no it isn't. that's the problem. Occam's Razor tells us the simplest explanation would be Sasuke fucked Karin.  Because you don't know how to use it, Explanation for character in shonen manga cheating on his wife would be much more complex than wrong presumption.  And unlike you I still think both outcomes are entirely possible and logical because Kishy left himself enough room for both, not just the one I prefer.        Japs tend to have a boner for genetics/nature over nurture, so I'd say Sarada's style and speech patterns being a reflection of Sakura's suggests she's going to be the mother after all.  There will probably be some contrived explanation of Sakura needing Karin's help to deliver the baby or some shit, nice little ribbon to tie it all up to status quo.   I'd hope he'd go for a "family is who cares about you, not just your blood" bit, but I don't think the Japs go for that too much.         Her Sharingan is more than likely just going to go to waste. They're not going to turn Sarada into an edgelord so it's unlikely she'll ever unlock any of the Sharingan's major powers.And the whole point is that HER AURA IS SAKURA'S. Given the fact that absolutely none of the kids have been shown to have any original skills so far, and it's unlikely Sarada will master the Sharingan on any level like that of her dad, they're most likely just going to give her Sakura's useless strength and healing and make her second class to Boruto and Mitsuki.    What photoshopped pictures?    The picture of Karin she put her face over. Are you saying it'd be good to just write this off as "oh, she didn't have any other pictures of Sasuke to use."   Umbillical cord can easily be Salad's,   the fact that you think this hi-tech paternity testing equipment couldn't recognize that the two samples are from the same individual and believe that this would be good writing is astounding.   since she was probably born in that very hideout,    If the only secret was she was born outside the village. It's stupid that none of the characters just told her that.                   throw super punches  Don't forget healing as well, like almost literally every other Naruto girl.      and believe that this would be good writing is astounding.   Are you...expecting good writing from Naruto?      Sarada has Sakura's power, which is fucking logical as she has been living with Sakura for 12 years and, I bet, was taught by her. And that alone ruined her character? Are you fucking retarded? Her power is one aspect of her character, not the whole character. And before her fighting style has never been shown. This is just ludicrious.    Boruto movie out August, manga will most likely end around end of July.   unless kishi decides to continue        All I'm saying is that all the Uchihas that Itachi didn't kill have been talented and Sarada is on pace to be pretty good.  At least until she hits the Mangekyo ceiling. But who knows, maybe Naruto can recommend her for sage training later. He does need a true successor at some point.       It is something that can be learned, and honestly I hope that's what happened. I've wanted a character that used chakra chains offensively for ages and I think if Gaiden is trying to send a message of "it's bonds and not genes that matter", it would be far more effective if Kishi didn't go back on it by making this whole thing a misunderstanding. But it wouldn't be the first that he's made a point of something only to contradict it later and shoot himself in the foot (see: Naruto vs Neji in the chuunin exams); I think we knew this was going happen eventually. Sarada having Sakura's super strength has just driven the possibility home, and now people are getting asschapped and taking it out on Salad.  I still hope Kishi will surprise us at the eleventh hour but I don't think it's going to happen.      Are you saying it'd be good to just write this off as "oh, she didn't have any other pictures of Sasuke to use."  Well if they could make it, why would they still use the old one from the middle of shippuden?     The whole cuck thing was fun, but it's really overstayed its welcome. Either:  A) Sakura is the mother after all, the not-blood-family message is kneecapped and the entire Gaiden was a waste of time. (Pic related for one the worst movies I've ever seen.)  B) karin is the mother and either doesn't know or doesn't care, Sarada accepts Sakura as her mother, and the plot was again a huge waste of time.  Sakurafags didn't want this drama, Sakura haters won't want the inevitable scene where they make up. And we couldn't just have Boruto, Sarada and Mitsuki going on some missions. Fuck.             Sakura is Tsunade's daughter      I'd be willing to bet literal thousands of dollars that Naruto is going to wind up getting the DBZ treatment.   Mangaka claims to be done with it, executives seize the label and persistently squeeze out yearly video games and spin-offs to ensure nobody shuts the fuck up about it for a dozen years, and eventually it will be completely revived and Kishimoto will be dragged out of his deathbed and into the sunlight with no idea what the fuck a "Kakashi" is supposed to be       even cc2 stopped caring about her     They're not going to turn Sarada into an edgelord so it's unlikely she'll ever unlock any of the Sharingan's major powers.  She doesn't need to go down that road. Her sharingan already makes her better than what most people will be. All she needs is time to mix and match shit she sees into her own fighting style.   it's unlikely Sarada will master the Sharingan on any level like that of her dad  She's already developing faster than dad by activating her shit outside of life and death scenarios. She will never be Sasuke/Naruto tier but she could very well develop to be a Hokage candidate like the Third.         Mangaka claims to be done with it  That may not be the case once his bank account starts running low.     No fucking shit. It's kind of a big deal Kishi wrote the screenplay for the Boruto movie. If it is not a complete mess, he may continue the franchise that way.     Sarada felt diconnected with her parents   She only felt disconnected from Sasuke, whom she knew was her biological dad. She never started feel disconnected from Sakura until she began to think Sakura wasn't her mom after finding the picture and deduced that maybe the reason her parents' marriage seemed funny was because there was something scandalous going on. Had she not discovered the picture, life would have gone on the same for her. Making her Sakura's biological daughter, you essentially make the story one where Sarada already has a good relationship with her mom, falls into doubt about her paternity, force her to learn that it's not about the blood they share but the bond that transcends blood, only for it to not matter in the end because Sarada is Sakura's biological kid so everything can just go back to way it was before without a hitch. It's lazy storytelling at its finest. Even if a moral lesson is good, you don't make characters learn it who don't need learn it or have no immediate use for it. That's just a waste of a story. Sure, it might be good for someone like Sarada to know that anyway, regardless of who her parent is, but it doesn't exactly make for good entertainment.  Not only that, but as a narrative, you have a lesson that really doesn't have any evidence to prove it. If Sarada feels a connection with a dad she's never met but is blood related to and feels connected to Sakura who she blood related to, then she can't serve as an example of this moral. A better demonstration of the moral would be Iruka and Naruto but this was supposed to be Sarada's story.          She did feel disconnected with Sakura, she questioned her attitude toward's Sasuke's abscense several times, she didn't understood how can her mother be fine with father not seeing them for 12 years.    fucking hell the autism is real.  how the fuck do you guys think sarada was going to focus on sharingan-centered techniques or combat styles if she hadn't even awakened it yet? is it really so crazy to imagine that while her father wasn't there to teach her how to use the sharingan she instead picked up the style/techniques of the one parent who was there?  besides, just because she learned to use chackra for super strength, doesn't mean it's all she has, she probably has katon or raiton, maybe both, she now has the sharingan and who knows what the fuck else she could learn?          All she needs is time to mix and match shit she sees into her own fighting style.   I doubt we'll see any of this. Her role in the Boruto movie doesn't seem to be of any significance so I doubt we'll see her doing much at all.   but she could very well develop to be a Hokage candidate like the Third.   Even if she ever does become Hokage, she'll be Tsunade-tier, which is a disgrace.            Sarada is Sasuke and Sakura's daughter   Boruto is Naruto's son       B) karin is the mother and either doesn't know or doesn't care, Sarada accepts Sakura as her mother, and the plot was again a huge waste of time.  The plot wouldn't be a waste of time because the message is that a family is only a family if they care about each other. This chapter showed that Salad, Sasuke and Sakura cared about one another. And as long as Karin gets portrayed as someone who didn't give a shit about Salad, the plot would stay cohesive.    Why did Sasuke use amaterasu on the blades?   So Shin wouldn't use them against them    He was so fucking mad at them for hurting his waifu     She did feel disconnected with Sakura, she questioned her attitude toward's Sasuke's abscense several times, she didn't understood how can her mother be fine with father not seeing them for 12 years.   That has absolutely nothing to do with feeling disconnected with Sakura. She questioned her parents' marriage because it seemed funny they weren't together and that Sasuke never seemed to contact them. THAT WAS IT. Sarada didn't feel disconnected from Sakura until the picture and DNA Test led her to believe she wasn't Sakura's daughter. In case you didn't notice, Sarada wanted Sakura to be her mother and was devastated when she found out she wasn't.  Nowhere in Chapter 1 or 2 does she say anything like "I'm not like mama at all." Has Sakura not been so terrible at answering questions and maybe gotten rid of that picture, none of this story would have happened         Even if she ever does become Hokage, she'll be Tsunade-tier, which is a disgrace.   for what reason would she be tsunade-tier? just because she learned super strength jutsu she can't learn anything else? nigger she awakened the sharingan without needing to go insane or going full DARKNESS, she may just be able to go mangekyou without it too (like kakashi did, and it wasn't even his sharingan). fuck, with daddy sasuke genes god knows what sort of OP eye power bullshit she'll get.       &gt;Sarada is Sasuke and Sakura's daughter  top lel     The real question is why he hasn't already killed cuckura with the blades, magneto-style     She's the weakest of her team.     Ah, got it. Thanks.    kishi doesn't give two shits about hinata now that she served her purpose and made a naruto clone and himawari is a mini hinata     Her role in the Boruto movie doesn't seem to be of any significance so I doubt we'll see her doing much at all.  She's in the little tournament though its unknown how much of the actual tournament will be shown before things go south.   Even if she ever does become Hokage, she'll be Tsunade-tier  Why? Tsunade is an old woman who did nothing for decades. Also, she's only still alive because of her bloodlines. There's no real comparison there.        It seems like every piece of marketing goes "Sasuke and Sakura".  SS is ppular over there, right? Is it like a coincidence, or purposeful reassurance? Wishful thinking?       How do you know? We know shit about stretch.     yeah, because we know what that white-haired faggot's powers and strengths are, right? and we've also seen what bolt knows too right?     well then if cc2 is not giving a shit about hinata i might as well give up for part 3 now.     man, I thought they liked hinata? That's almost insulting and I'm not even a Hinata fag    sad but true     yeahsorry.jpg      She's in the little tournament    which will be interrupted by aliens and all she do is probably smash stuff.   There's no real comparison there.   Sarada will have the same useless abilities.     The promotional materials refer to Boruto as a prodigy and Mitsuki as a "superior ninja" shrouded in mystery. All the promotional materials say about Sarada is that she's Sasuke and Sakura's kid. Boruto has Naruto genes and Sasuke as a teacher. Sarada has a vagina which means she'll be useless.                 doesn't Shueisha or Namco Bandai decide, what will be printed for promotion?      Yeah...sorry.    only that mitsuki has stretchy arms and bolt has some chidori/rasengan kind of move  I really just want him to have the byakugan       Sarada will have the same useless abilities.  Tsunade has a Sharingan? Since when?   The promotional materials refer to Boruto as a prodigy and Mitsuki as a "superior ninja" shrouded in mystery. All the promotional materials say about Sarada is that she's Sasuke and Sakura's kid.  Is that because both are getting no screentime at all in the manga and require some kind of hype? I mean you can clearly see that Sarada is a prodigy of her own already.         *forehead poke*      I really just want him to have the byakugan   Bolt? He won't. He will get nothing of his mother, he's basically a sn child now.      The poke will be the end of gaiden 10 isn't?     He will get nothing of his mother   what is lightining chakra nature      We're talking about the motherfuckers that made the reward in Storm 3 for playing on hard be Naruto going on a mission alone with Hinata.  Revolution was even worse.       (like kakashi did, and it wasn't even his sharingan  Oh, so she just has to kill one of her teammates then?      His grandfather has it too. I wouldn't be surprised if they attribute it to Minato and Sasuke isnce it was never mentioned beyond Hinata's databook      I really just want him to have the byakugan  Better chance of Hima getting it to draw parallels.     Because Hinata is so well known for her lightning jutsus.    But why not? Is there a rule or chance involved in the passing down of kekkegenkai? Sarada gets the sharingan with only 1 Uchiha parent.    Wasn't hinata wind based?        kishimoto probably gave her that so bolt had it, to mirror sasuke   see  even cc2 doesn't give a shit  Don't get me wrong, I like Hinata, but it's clear Kishimoto stopped caring about her the moment she gave birth to Naruto jr. To add insult to injury, he has more in common with Sasuke than with her. Meanwhile Sarada is a mix of her parents.          Riding on a magical entity above the FREAKIN CLOUDS that my father conjured up   Ten times more amazing seeing as flying mechanisms hasn't been(canonically) invented yet   I WONDER WHO MY MOM IS?!   I guess Family drama&gt;Amazing shit in the Narutoverse       does CC2 have any say, what will be promoted in shonen/v-jump?    She isnt, but she has lightning chakra nature    neither is Minato, who had it as well. And even Naruto for that matter    Will the fucking salt ever stop? I didn't see a lot of Chichi in Gohan. Nobody ever hated her for that.    Because Kishimoto doesn't care about her or the Byakugan    Or she could be the Jiraiya of her team.  Please.     Yes, but do you think anyone is going to say "That truly is Naruto and Hinata's child" when he pulls a rasenchidori while wearing Naruto's jacket and Sasuke's headband.    sakura fags hate her so much they are using this chapter and the game scan to shit on her  doesn't help naruto doesn't interact with his mini me and only has bolt's photo on his desk, it's like his daughter and wife don't exist       Tsunade has a Sharingan? Since when?   Sarada's Sharingan is wasted on her vagina   I mean you can clearly see that Sarada is a prodigy of her own already.   She's just being tossed a bone before she's sidelined forever. And crying hard enough over absolutely nothing that your eyes turn red doesn't make you a prodigy. I can already see it now, she'll just do nothing but cry and then take out below average mooks and when he "SARADA, SMASH" would harm the plot, they'll stick her in the healing tent.  Greatest waste of a character I've seen in awhile.            There was more of Chi Chi in Gohan than there was of Goku. Goten was more like Goku than Gohan was.   Why is Naruto so best dad?    Hinata not mentioned in one scan.   CC2 now suddenly not giant Hinatafags  Fujoshit, please.      *with her mini me    He's only the best when he's taking care of other people's kids    sakurafags need to reassure themselves and assert that sakura is superior, they are petty as fuck.  That doesnt matter. He got lightning from Hinata, so he did get something from his mother side      implying CC2 does all the promotionial work in shonen/v-jump    Not a fujoshi, I like Hinata. This just feels disrespectful. It wouldn't be a problem if it said Sarada is Sasuke's child, but they mentioned both parents.   how proud do you think he is right now    sakura-chan is so moe   Holy shit this is disgusting.      You don't have to actually kill someone close to you to get the mangekyo, it's just the simplest way as it expedites the process of losing a friend.  If killing Rin was what gave Kakashi his, he should have already had it during part 1, and Obito got his upon seeing Kakashi kill Rin.  Also, Shisui committed suicide in front of Itachi, which is what unlocked his as opposed to the murder of the clan.        weren't sakura fags saying hinata is shit because she's moe?    Right, becasue we have seen so many interactions with his own sons. He even wastes his time running after Boruto when he could just use the heremitic mode to find him in an instant.  Fuck off.       Uchiha using a technique created by a Senju  He's angry     More like he's best when taking care of kids who are not entitled attentionwhoring shitheads.      Uchiha wants to be Hokage   She's a worthless crybaby medic with super strength.   he's probably feeling pretty good. Uchihas getting nerfed forever by useless Haruno genes is almost as good as eliminating them from the face of the earth.        this shit will never end    That's the point, Sakura is not in any conceivable way moe, it's like G4 commercials, advertisers spew words in completely inappropriate context with no understanding of their meaning, trying to earn, in this case, otaku cred.     his own sons.    sons    son and a daughter   see he is a shitty dad for this fact alone         Oh my God, you actually think CC2 wrote the article?     How the fuck does this indicate she's actually Sakura's kid when the DNA test said otherwise? Are you delusional?  Chakra-enhanced strength is not a fucking bloodline ability, Sakura learned it from Tsunade.       She's just being tossed a bone before she's sidelined forever.  You're grasping pretty hard considering you know nothing about one member of her team.   And crying hard enough over absolutely nothing that your eyes turn red doesn't make you a prodigy.  1. Her eyes awakened before then. 2. It does when you have magic eyes.  If you've forgotten then its been stated that the age the eyes awaken puts a huge emphasis on the talent/potential of the individual. As of right now, she's behind Itachi and in front of Sasuke.          CC2 already blew their Hyuuga love load, though. That was one of the first things announced for the game.    Again. From what we have seen he's a great dad.     Wait it's only 10 chapters? Are you sure?     The more her edge is suppressed, the more Tobi would like her.   Tobi created a lot of techniques. He doesn't care as long as its not powered by edge.        Plus, who gets her entire love story remade into a single player campaign?    I'm pretty worried she won't be in the final fight of the movie.     You're grasping pretty hard considering you know nothing about one member of her team.   I know Mitsuki and Boruto are stronger.  Just admit your Uchihafu is shit.    1. Her eyes awakened before then.   When she was crying. All she does is cry over stupid shit.   2. It does when you have magic eyes.   She's never gonna use them for anything. They're just there so you know she's Sasuke's kid.  God, I fucking hate her so much now.                    yfw Skrillex your wife and love child  What a monster     A tiny panel in two full pages wanking to team 7?     She won't. She'll be stuck on the bench. She'll probably cry and ask Boruto to bring Naruto back.     Not according to Burrito   The fact that he doesn't use sage mode to find his son just shows he doesn't even really want to see him bad enough and it's just a front he puts on to the villagers that he is a caring dad. All Naruto ever wanted was to become hokage, he didn't want a wife or kids just to become Hokage him having a perfect family is just a facade he puts on like politicians and presidents do    Will "that" epic battle also be re-created within NS4!?  It's weird they'd hint Toneri like that and still not announce him.     CC2 doesn't make the article, dumbass. They decided to make a new character and a full combo featuring Hiashi for fuck's sake.     If killing Rin was what gave Kakashi his, he should have already had it during part 1, and Obito got his upon seeing Kakashi kill Rin.  Kakashi go it the at the same moment Obito did, when he killed Rin. That was clearly shown in tthe manga     He's just tsun.    Is mitsuki is known to demonstrate landscape-shaping powers?    Boruto is like a white person. He hates his parents for little reason.     Dat confirmation bias  Opinion discarded.      why would Mitsuki have shit powers?      The fact that he doesn't use sage mode to find his son just shows he doesn't even really want to see him  Doesn't it show he didn't use to make the hide and seek game last more?      I know Mitsuki and Boruto are stronger.  You don't. You know Bolt is a prodigy, and Mitsuki is a superior ninja. Sarada looks to be a prodigy as well. If anything, the whole group is maybe to be a group of prodigies.   When she was crying  Her Sharingan visible appears for the first time when she is running of to meet Sasuke. She isn't crying then.   She's never gonna use them for anything.  SHE JUST USED THEM. You're just trolling now.            I'm pretty worried she won't be in the final fight of the movie.   If its a force that was able to capture/harm Naruto, she shouldn't.       why would Mitsuki have shit powers?   Stretchy arms   You tell me.         He doesn't have to have shit powers to be weaker than either of his teammates. Sarada is shaping up to be as lethal as Sakura was when she destroyed an Akatsuki member. Boruto is a prodigy trained by the hokage. Mitsuki is a transfer student with stretchy arms.    You do realize he inherited his lightning affinity fromv his mother, right ?    People expecting Sarada to not end up the weakest on her team   Yeah, she's got a great blend of abilities, but come on, this is Naruto. When don't the women job compared to their peers in the long term?     why do you niggers forget chiyo?      Her Sharingan visible appears for the first time when she is running of to meet Sasuke. She isn't crying then.   Yes, she fucking is, you idiot.   SHE JUST USED THEM.   No she didn't. She didn't use her sharingan to copy Sakura's abilities. She has Sakura's abilities because she's her fucking daughter. That's going to be the ONLY reason. And no, it doesn't fucking matter that Sakura's powers aren't genetic because they're genetic when Kishi wants to have his epic artistic parallels. Kishi stopped caring about Sharingan being able to copy jutsu years ago and probably doesn't even remember that's what it was for. Sarada didn't copy shit. She's not gonna copy shit. She's not gonna develop any of her own unique jutsus anymore than any of the other kids who just copy their parents. Her sharingan is just activated for show because "WE HAVE TO REMIND THEM THAT SHE'S SASUKE 'COOLEST GUY' UCHIHA'S SLUT DAUGHTER" while her teammates dance circles around her and get all the important fights.  Then she'll cry about some more fucking stupid ass family drama and you'll still be waiting to see her do something saying "maybe this time, maybe this time." But she's not gonna fucking do anything because she's a shitty fucking female character in Naruto.  If you think this is going to turn out any different, you're a fool.  She's Sakura's worthless daughter with shit Haruno genes. She going to be a terrible medic. She's just got melodramatic and emotional. Then she'll probably end up marrying a guy who treats her like shit and forget all about her dreams of being Hokage, which were never gonna happen anyway because a fucking disgusting ass nerfed Uchiha would never make the cut.  Fuck her.                   She looks like Sasuke so Kishi might forget that she's female.    I don't trust a man who throws a cake on the ground.    cont'd  I mean if Naruto really wanted to find his son wouldn't the best way for him to find him is by having his clone use transformation jutsu and conceal him Or fuck why doesn't Naruto put a clone waiting for him after school  Naruto isn't really trying to find him he's just pretending to that's why he goes around the village asking " have you seen my son?" to show the people "Look at me, I'm such a caring dad being BOTH the Hokage and wanting to spend time with my family"         I think Temari is categorically superior to Kankuro. And Hinata has powers that completely invalidate Shino's abilities and the wolf guy's, more or less, too. That's the only off-hand examples I can think of, though.      Sakura destroyed an Akatsuki member   Chiyo LITERALLY did the work for her, plus Chiyo was the one who delivered the final blow.     Guys. Karins EGG was places INSIDE of Sakura.  So Sadara technically have 2 mothers and one father.     cont'd I forgot to mention it, but the reason he doesn't use a transformation jutsu is because he wants the villagers to know ITS HIM looking for his son  Naruto's always been a show off and this is no different       Because the way Sakurafags read the manga is "blah blah SAKURA blah blah QUEEN blah blah SAKURA." Everything else is just noise.     No she didn't. She didn't use her sharingan to copy Sakura's abilities. She has Sakura's abilities because she's her fucking daughter.  Yes. Because Sakura (and Shizune to a lower degree) had Tsunade's powers because they're her daughters as well. Because the super strength is hereditary. gg fgt      Where did they say this gaiden was only going to be 10 chapters?  All this fuckery with this Shin fellow seemingly has nothing to do with the Kaguya related threat Sasuke mentioned.  It's not like Kishimoto to mention something like that and leave it unresolved - especially if it has anything to do with Sharingan/6 Paths Sage fuckery. He luhs dat shit.         She used it's precognitive sight abilities.     It'd be funny if they both got inexplicably tired of Sasukes shit and decided to adopt Sarada and lez it up. What, its not like the kids gonna get any more messed up     Come on, you tried too hard and it became obvious. Time to give up, refine your troll and post it next thread.    Chiyo was going to achieve fuck-all without Sakura's destructive power. What Sakura is lacking is agility, and Sarada has that whole Uchiha thing going on.     well said anon    That picture is funny. As if Naruto could become so injured he'd need to have a lie down with his face in a little girls chest.   People complaining about Naruto :   All it is just Sharingan this, Uchiha that, what about something else!   People complaining about this newest chapter :   Wtf, why isn't Sarada focusing usage on her Sharingan!   I know it's only been 1 chapter of her actually fighting and using her super strength, but I'm going to wing it and complain about her lack of usage of her Sharingan of which she just activated merely 2 chapters ago.   Kishimoto a worst.   Yet you faggots will still read this shit and complain about it anyway.              So tired of Sasuke that instead of finding a new man, we found each other   Sounds like the average feminist story      I am being completely serious and you all think this is a troll because it's an unpopular opinion. Only thing Naruto's ever desired is to be Hokage and that is more important to him than his spoiled kid    Well this whole thing is a lead up to the Bort movie.Next chapter will probably have Shin resolved, some explanation that leaves SasuSaku intact (though Karin may still be the bio mom) and the ending will have some hint of rabbit aliens. It'll end on a "Watch the Bort movie to find out what the fuck is going on!"     "Oh, I'm so fucking hurt.."  Wink, wink...        I have two moms!      Yet you faggots will still read this shit and complain about it anyway.  welcome to crackruto     WHAT PART OF FUCKING PARALLELS DO YOU NOT GET!?  FOR FUCK'S SAKE, KISHI DOESN'T GIVE A FUCK  HE DOES NOT GIVE A FLYING FUCK  SAKURA DIDN'T TRAIN SARADA  SARADA DIDN"T COPY ANYTHING  KISHI JUST GAVE HER FUCKING SUPER STRENGTH OUT OF NOWHERE SO HE CAN JUSTIFY IT LATER BY SAYING IT'S CAUSE OF SAKURA'S GENES  HE DOESN'T CARE IF IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE  AS LONG AS HE CAN BE ALL ARTISTIC AND POETIC WITH IT, HE DOESN'T CARE.  GET IT THROUGH YOUR THICK FUCKING RETARDED ASS SKULL  THERE IS NO LOGIC HERE BEYOND KISHI LOGIC                       She isn't using the innate ability of the Sharingan  Oh please. It's in her blood and like a reflex for her now. That's why Naruto had to specifically tell her she had it.  But keep grasping at nothing anon. You're doing a fantastic job.      Is Shizune in danger?    conflate contradictory aspects arbitrarily   herp derp such doublethink xd-DD  Fuck off.      dude, pls stop. You were off to a good start, but you overdid it. No need to be sad, there will be another thread shortly, so you have a few hours to polish up your argument     Why the fuck are her horns brown, thats so ugly.      I think Temari is categorically superior to Kankuro   Dunno about that given Kankuro's inheritance and masterful use of Sasori's puppets. Also, their relative strengths by the end of part 2 are never really properly established because Kankuro doesn't show up in the manga past the initial wave of resurrections he helps seal.  Most of the time in Naruto women are last on their team in strength. Sakura is the weakest of her team.   Rin needed constant saving and then got killed.   Tsunade is the weakest on her team in a serious fight (remember Pain said Jiraya might have beaten him had he known the secret from the get-go).  Tenten is basically Lee with weapons instead of fists, but minus the gates.  Karin is a team sensor/healer and the least physically capable of her team.  The only time Konan was remotely effective in combat was when she set up an incredibly elaborate trap, and even then it didn't work.  Hinata was persistently portrayed as weaker than Neji.  We could really keep going. Even if we accept that Temari was stronger than Kankuro, it's the exception, not the rule.                      Then I have rarely seen someone with such a poor grasp on such simple characters.     a sexy feminist story. I don't care if it appeals to Tumbltards, the doujins'll be worth it. Not to mention the overwhelming lack of fucks Sasuke would give    Sarada has retard strenght     WHAT PART OF FUCKING PARALLELS DO YOU NOT GET!?    SAKURA DIDN'T TRAIN SARADA  All other parents in Konoha trained their kids. Why wouldn't Sakura train Sarada?  If Sarada's strength were indicative of her heritage, then Sarada wouldn't have had doubts about her parentage in the first place.         People getting mad about Sarada getting super strength   Forgetting that she did so before even graduating the academy   implying she won't get eyehax later on   She's going to be a lot stronger than that turd Boruto       can't pass up on sexy loli chest, you don't know when the next one'll come by     getting this mad because people don't agree with your retarded argument  you're the reason these threads are so enjoyable anon, please never change      WHAT PART OF FUCKING PARALLELS DO YOU NOT GET!?  Her main parallel is Sasuke. Naruto has been beating that shit as a drum. Through her Uchiha abilities, she was able to copy her mom's ability to complete it.   This is first 20 chapter shit anon. Get it together.       Is the point supposed to be making him as unlikable as possible?    Forgot to add.  WHAT PART OF FUCKING PARALLELS DO YOU NOT GET!?  This is NSfag logic. It was wrong before; it's wrong now.         implying shit haruno genes will surpass narusasu love child    implying       maybe it's supposed to be bronze/gold? i don't know and i don't care    Shut up, i am not trolling and the opinion of 1 random anon does not matter to me I stand by the argument that Naruto looking for Boruto is only for show and Boruto himself can see through his bullshit     haruno genes   Stop      Meanwhile in Kurama's room  What the fuck man? She's only twelve and she's your friends' daughter, get the fuck off her, you disgust me.        implying Kishimoto would dare ruin one of his 2 Gary Stu's with such an edgelord meta-take on Naruto's terribleness of being a father.   This is such a tryhard attempt.  What does Naruto have to gain from "showing off?"  Seemingly you haven't read Naruto in a very long time - sorry to break it to you but he ditched the show-off, attention whore antics as soon as Part 2/Timeskip happened.  To further instill how fucking dumb your edgelord "Naruto is a narcissist" theory, why the fuck does he need the recognition of the villagers?  He and Sasuke saved the entire fucking world - he was/is world famous before even becoming the Hokage.   Naruto is a bad father because he's a bad father. He never had a real one in his life, it wouldn't be too far fetched that he's bad at emulating something he's never seen. That's it.                 Now that he's acquired some puppets with kage jutsus, perhaps. But at any time you compared the two, even during the chuunin exams, all kankuro could do was shoot poisonous knives and basically amount to Tenten 2.0. And what happened to her? She was wrecked effortlessly by Temari. Because weapons don't have shit on her, unless they're as massive as the Kazekage's iron sand.  Basically all of the rest are true and I agree, except Hinata isn't on Neji's team.      Chouchou's schtick may be one note, but damn it I love it each time.    No way that ass is only 12 Kurama, get over yourself     Salad copied Sakura's super strength with her sharingan   Impossible, because her super strength isn't a jutsu.  Tsunade's and Sakura's super strength is applied fine control of their chakra. They're able to hit so hard because their chakra control is so tight they can focus it efficiently. It's not something you just learn, you have to train it.  Were it possible to just copy super strength on a whim Sasuke would have used it already.        Who is a bigger momma's boy. Bolt or Gohan?   She didn't copy shit, that sort of super strength requires precision and training, it's not the sort of thing you can just do on the fly without ever having seen someone do it with your sharingan. Logically, Sakura taught her.     An older man is nice to a little girl   He wants to bang her   This is what /a/ believes.       Boruto. Gohan told his mom to shut the fuck up and let him go to Namek. Boruto may have thrown a cake, but he hasn't raised his voice at Hinata yet.   Anyone else thinking the whole Karin and Sarada having matching DNA is going to be a lot more asspully?  In a better world, Kishimoto could just explain that Sakura is infertile, therefore she and Sasuke used Karin as a surrogate.  BUT, I'm thinking it's going to be as inane as "Sasuke has been consuming Karin's blood for years as a means to regenerate his body from damage - her blood flows through him" or something along those lines.        implying it wasn't half Kurama's idea in the first place so he can switch out into Naruto's body under pretense of faster healing so he can get a hug       i want NTR fan beta cucks to kill themselves      the stupid is high in this anon     No you fucking dumbass. The only reason she has super strength is so Kishi can fucking sit there and show how much like Sakura she is.  He's not going to come out and ruin his poetry by saying "Oh, she just copied it." That doesn't prove that Sarada is Sakura's daughter, which is the only reason he did that. He didn't do it because he had any fucking logic prepared. He did it because he wanted to prove once and for all that Sarada is Sakura's daughter.  And again, it doesn't fucking matter that the ability was something Sakura trained to acquire. This is bullshit no jutsu. Boruto has whiskers even though he isn't a jinchuriki? Why? Because he's Naruto's son. That's the only reason? Doesn't make sense? Fuck you then, says Kishimoto.  That's exactly what we're dealing with here. Kishimoto is turning the ability into a genetic ability when it's convenient for him to stroke his poetry boner.            What are jokes and humorous make believe      The only time Konan was remotely effective in combat was when she set up an incredibly elaborate trap, and even then it didn't work.  Don't know man, there's a good chance Konan could solo Hidan, Kakuzu and Orochimaru, maybe even Deidara     Wouldn't this post have been more appropriate in your tumblr? Maybe with a gif of Beyonce acting dismissive at the end?    She's going to be Orochimaru's ultimate experiment.    learn to DNA     Kishimoto will never outright say it, but the most important thing to Naruto is being Hokage and it's been his dream since he was a child  By showing off he really "cares" about his son the villagers won't criticize him for neglecting his family. Not a narcissist and a show off anymore ? Why did he feel the need to lie to Sarada and Chou chou about his past? Why did he need Sarada and Chou Chou's recognition then? It's to upkeep the image he's the perfect Hokage  Yes now he's on top and wants to stay on top.             shut the fuck up, Kurama, do not fuck this up for me! I swear to Obito, if I don't get to fuck the lovechild of my childhood crush and emo best friend, I am gonna shove my chakra fist so far up your ass you'll be tasting my fingers at the back of your throat for a week    So fat black thorfinn is best grill    Kishimoto will never outright say it, but the most important thing to Naruto is being Hokage and it's been his dream since he was a child  Have you even read Naruto beyond the first chapters?    Don't paste for some reason   Uh, Sakura would be the surrogate in this case, Karin would be the donor if Sakura was infertile.     I don't have a tumblr. I'm just fucking sick and tired and these Saradaniggers thinking she's going to be anything more than a worthless whore. Fuck her. I wish she real so I could stab the shit out her and rip out her fucking ovaries.  Piece of shit 2D whore.       Do you just speedread and only pay attention to the part that confirm what you already feel?       I swear to Obito  kek    Why would "super-strength" be genetically related to Sakura if she learned it from Tsunade?    Nardo steals Saucegay's first kiss   Steals Sarada's too   Kishi do it        Somehow unironically thinking Hinata was or ever will be anything but shit  /a/ everyone.       Wow pretty classy /a/ instead of trying to debunk the argument you go for bashing the person who made it  Don't hate the playa        Naruto is not that interesting a character, bro. He quite literally rid himself of any inner darkness.     This is exactly what it's gonna fucking be.  CHAKRA MAGIC, AIN'T GOTTA EXPLAIN SHIT.        Impossible, because her super strength isn't a jutsu.  Neither is Rock Lee's punches and speed but how did that turn out?      Not a narcissist and a show off anymore ? Why did he feel the need to lie to Sarada and Chou chou about his past?   You're kidding right? They're fucking little kids and he was just having some fun.  Do you not socialize with people at all irl? Most adults would never admit to being a loser to kids, self-preservation of ego.  Pro-Tip - he's also the fucking Hokage, I'm sure the best thing to tell kids is how much of a fuccboi you were when you were a child is totally going to make them respect your position.          To be honest to me this was the gayest shit I read, I even skipped the anime episodes of this-   ITT: Gay couple      not these two       Video editing confirms.     that princess carry     100% confirmed     My heart's not over the Cyan and Retoree plotblock, but I absolutely love the last episode for that, at least.     Basically Makoto x anyone   What should Shuzo do?   Meant to reply      Good question. That is one pushy fuccboi, but I just don't think that that can stand up to the power of a man with a full-time job. It's best if Rom handles the pushing.     What if Shuzo pushed himself onto Rom?      Rom would just push back even harder.  Shuuzo should stick to pulling.      Pulling what exactly?    Just like in that image, pulling Rom Closer to him. He's been stalking patiently, waiting for the opportunity to strike and when he spotted Aion, he fucking leapt on it.   I have already been missing this.      No homo though  Are grils fine too?   If they're gay, they're okay    He just wanted to be helpful. ;_;    He just wanted an excuse to talk to Rom again and to hear his masculine, forceful voice.  It's okay my dear anon, they made up in the end and went on to have lots and lots of years-overdue makeup sex.  Unlike a certain other pairing       At least that pairing got an on-screen hug.    Fair enough. We couldn't get on-screen pic related, but at least we're free to imagine  and browse pixiv    Rom in a dress  This speaks to the darkness inside my boner.      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127138357  D-Don't look, author-sama! There is some sick, deranged, perverted shit going on in this pic!    They could have gone a bit deeper into things but the ending was good enough I suppose.         DIO was really fond of a certain gay twink.  An old /a/ favorite   besides OPxMe   The goggles came provided.   Not to mention his first love, Jonathan.    most of the thread is SB69   Yueni.        not Blue and Green   Kinshiro was a faggot      They even have a son.    I'll be there, hold on.     Gayer than 8 guys fucking 9 guys.    Leaving the cameraman out again?    Is that Mika with some fangtrash?  Not acceptable.       Didn't stay together at end because of Nezumi's bullshit   Fuck the ending     Why are blond fuccbois lusting over their hot-headed, estranged husbandos so big this season?    DIO only loved best boys. He had good taste.   Why is this a Show By Rock thread?   Try watching No. 6.        This is actually cannon homo isn't it?    But Esidisi cheated on Kars to marry Joseph who was married with Wham too.    I don't know, anon. You tell me.     pic unrelated  Stop wearing your fujo glasses, they're simply family      not spoilering the lewd     Whelp, he said "no homo", so it's definitely straight as can be.    I suppose I must be a deranged pervert.      not posting the cutest   At least the /y/ hambeastening keeps itself contained to one thread.   That's generally how these things work.    Nice buzzwords, friendo    I didn't realize /y/ was this legitimately mentally retarded. Okay.     /y/ is mostly westernshit now, unfortunately.  Anyway, back to gay       Only in Killua's dreams.     ignore and report, friendo     Are you perhaps bothered by something, anon?    Possibly, Gon is too pure         not posting the gif      tfw Mamoru was the last straight man alive yet the biggest faggot     B-Because I haven't s-seen it yet.  I swear to god though, it's the next fucking thing I'm going to start.       There are mixed opinions on it, it has nice world building and things pick up in the second part but I found the protagonist pretty obnoxious, hope you enjoy it though.    Go to your containment board.  Thank you for your cooperation.       I'll never understand how people can be so delusional that they don't realize that seraph is kuroshit-level fujobait.        tfw Yoichi will never clumsily fall onto you, knock you out and literally nuzzle your unconscious body back to health  Live why?      Nezumi's bullshit   It's not like Shion didn't load some bullshit in there, too.   hurrr I have to rebuild No. 6 even though I could just go with you        You can't even tell me these two aren't fucking with all the flirting they do with each other.   Maybe because they can see the amount of samefagging in this fujoshit thread in this thread with 16 unique ips.     No nipples.  Why ?       When's the last time you saw nipples on anyone, male or female, in an anime? The '00s maybe? I can't even remember. I think the Nips put nipples in their lewd laws or something.    Bahamut and Shit la Shit both had man nips      tumblr gifs      Beach episode of Ore Monogatari    Female nipples are not rare in BDs, some show up in TV, too.    Because the female love interest is actually relevant and is guaranteed to win in Owari.    This show    That isn't really gay since Enkidu is genderless.   Because they know the author and know that at some point Mika is probably going to overcome his edginess and start shipping Yuu and Shinoa.        Yuu and Shinoa.   Disgusting.       Yuu and Shinoa   Shit pair, shittiest fans.       I want baiting to fuck off and die.      l-lewd       Shinoafaggots can't keep their fucking snouts out of anything. They're the worst self-inserters on the board and take offense to anyone not treating Yuu like a blank slate that exists purely to be shipped with Shinoa. They don't even care that Yuu and Shinoa have zero chemistry whatsoever because they want to fuck Shinoa and therefore so should Yuu. Their cancer is on tumblr's level, as far as I'm concerned.    Shinofag has arrive to kill the fun, as usual.    I will eradicate them. Every last one.      The guy wrote LoLH and the manga is released in a shonen magazine. It doesn't matter what you think, the end result isn't hard to predict.      I want to disagree with you because I like Shinoa and I don't think there's anything wrong with liking her, but those threads are just so shit.     There is a thread dedicated to her when they can masturbate in peace   Somehow he felt he needed to shitpost in this istead of hiding and moving on.       They don't even care that Yuu and Shinoa have zero chemistry whatsoever because they want to fuck Shinoa and therefore so should Yuu.  Isn't the exact same true for Mikafags?        muh smug-chan hurr durr   so smugdere hurr my dick is diamonds   why is she so smug durr   Kill every last one of them.        Mika and Yuu grew up together, there's actually a fucking basis for liking them as a potential couple. Shinoa and Yuu met recently, all their interactions are forgettable and bland, and presently there is no earthly reason for Yuu to reciprocate her retarded crush other than the fact that she's cute, which means absolutely nothing in an anime series where goddamn everyone is cute. This ship is pure shit and only cancerous self-inserters would ever like it or defend it.      mad fujoshits       come into a gay thread just to shitpost  Sounds like hetfags are the ones who are mad.     Go back to tumblr, landwhale.  Only your tears can be understood by your fellow tumblr pod.      You're damn right I'm mad. I like this series and the threads for it before the anime used to be comfy, now they're just cancer-ridden Shinoa circlejerks.    Since you seem lost:     I'm sure the three other shitposters in here really appreciate how hard you're trying to fit in.    &gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/      Since you hambeasts can't seem to stick to your containment boards.        I always wonder who they think they're fooling when they show up to gay threads. We know why you're here, you don't have to hide it.    Maybe you can cry into Shinoa's bosom about it.     Says the landwhale caught samefagging in this thread hours ago.  How pathetic to not realize her pathetic imagedump thread was only kept alive by her fellow herd samefagging with just 4 people.          this thread    Funny because you fujoshits have never fit in on /a/ and constantly get pointed out and ridiculed  One look in the archive and you can seem how so many of you are incapable of reverse image searching on google and need to constantly beg for source.  I guess it is to be expected over how dumb fujoshits are.        The reason nobody responded to your post back then is because it's obvious you have no idea what samefagging is.     there's actually a fucking basis for liking them as a potential couple  What basis? Them being brothers doesn't mean that they're ever going to be gay for each other. Admittedly, Mika is probably gay, but Yuu doesn't really treat him any differently from anyone else he sees as family.   all their interactions are forgettable and bland  Their interaction are among the few non-bland and non-forgettable parts of the series.   and presently there is no earthly reason for Yuu to reciprocate her retarded crush other than the fact that she's cute  No one is saying that he has to reciprocate her feelings now. Doesn't mean he can't develop feelings for her over the course of the series. It's not hard to imagine, since they are among the few characters who have a decent dynamic going.   This ship is pure shit and only cancerous self-inserters would ever like it or defend it.  Or people who just like the banter between Yuu and Shinoa. Or those who payed attention and realized that there's no real chance of Mika winning so shipping him with Yuu is kinda pointless.              Kill all s-s-s-s- Shinoafags     Keep telling yourself that.    Why do landwhales make it so easy to identity themselves?  They still can't give up their cancerous spoiler tagging abuse in their posts.         I know why you are here and I'm going to supply you with what you're looking for.  Pic related, it's what you came into this thread for.          Their interaction are among the few non-bland and non-forgettable parts of the series.  Shinoa herself is not bland or forgettable, but her interactions with Yuu aren't anything special. She plays better off Mitsuba, in my opinion.    Were they gay?   Don't worry, I have what you need.  Do you get too embarrassed trying to look up Yuu/Mika on Pixiv? Like it'd be the final nail in your gay coffin?      The slutty one kind of flirted with Nonon that one time, but he was kinda gay with his sewing friend. I suppose he's a bifag.    No yeah, she's great, I wanna be clear. I enjoy her, it's her cult I can't fucking stand.  That said, please. Anons, instead of going to the trouble to compose a response to these glorified brick walls of edgy memes and buzzwords, isn't it easier and far less frustrating to just ignore and report? If you choke a flame it can't spread.  Enough of this gay shit, let's get back to talking about homosexual relationships or subtext in Chinese cartoons.          I like Shinoa herself too, it's her fucking fans that need to kill themselves. But you are right, there is no point in talking to them and more than enough reason to carry on with the original topic.     implying lolheroes and shone stuff ever focus on romance   implying lolheroes won't end in a threesome      I choose top left.    You fujoshits never talked about anything in the first place beside imagedumping.  Maybe you should off back to  where you belong.      The romance is never the focus, but the occasional inner monologues make the feelings of the characters pretty clear. Also,  implying Ryner won't die before that happens      You don't have to pretend anymore, it's okay.    Oh man, reading the archive is fucking amusing to see this hambeast spurging out in her fujoshit containment thread.  She acts like the equivalent of female Narutard.      And you don't have to badly pretend anymore that you aren't a fujoshit.  Your filenames make it too obvious to see that you are one of the cancerous spillover from the fujoshit thread.  https://archive.moe/a/search/image/<wbr>14Wh9B6fhksh9dP-jSKPug/</wbr>            <br/>         And you don't have to badly pretend anymore that you aren't a fujoshit.  I have never denied that.  I am here to give you what you seek. There are no closets on anonymous imageboards. Be brave.       You realize that link only returns that exact post you replied to, right?    Oh, or not. The archive hadn't updated yet and I didn't bother comparing the text because I didn't care. Never mind.    I don't care about your feud with that fujo but try reading this https://archive.moe/a/thread/127004<wbr>067/#127067087 for a while. instead. Shinoafags are equally bad because all they can do is spout bullshit and then stay silent when people bring up legit points.</wbr>     Your filenames    You mean Pixiv filenames?      Moest pair.    How new can you be if you don't even recognize pixiv filename format?    Those are pixiv filenames, you retard.   Friendly reminder that replying to bait makes cute boys cry.  Let's keep cute boys happy, okay?      Makoto x anyone = OTP Nagisa x anyone = OTP Makoto x Nagisa = _________       But it's delicious when cute boys cry.    But Mika can't be even remotely happy until Kagami finally takes pity on him.      It's especially delicious when Kerry cries because he's a terrible boy.   In the interest of evening the tides a little bit   NOTP, it's maths.     that student  Who is this demonic spirit of male ejaculate?     Jun    Girl nipples are much more common, it's just the guys getting the short end of the stick most of the time unfortunately.    BestTP   Are gay harems allowed?    Homos in the bath are comfiest    actually gay too  God damn, this fuccboi is absolutely wasted on a sensei as straight as Itoshiki.     This show. Repeatedly.    Why are these so  father and son?     Why does Barnaby have to be so shit? Kotetsu is top-tier.    I wish   It's not a stretch at all to say this is pretty much canon.   Enkidu IS technically genderless but his body is male.Narita refers to Enkidu as a "he" and his genderbent cameo in Sensha Otoko was female. I don't think it's too big of a deal to consider it gay, anon. Gil swings both ways anyhow.      Gay harems are the best.    Catching up now  God damn, it is fucking breaking my heart that I don't have a Yoichi of my own to wait patiently by my bedside for me to recover.    I wanna mindbreak him.    Gintama has some seriously talented doujinka but I don't think I can handle watching 200 episodes just to understand what's going on.   oh boy gay thread, maybe they're discussing portrayals of actual cou-  173 replies   34 posters  It's the same fujoshits that drive these threads every time. Can't you guys go to /cm/ or just circlejerk in a skype group or something? This never stops being disappointing.       Makoto  You mean Sousuke, right?     Well you don't really need to anyways. You can still enjoy the doujins without watching the series, since most of it is just episodic toilet humor.   So this is what happens when you start a gay thread with a pairing from a show with a cancerous fanbase. Fascinating.    Implying it will happen    Biggest herring ever        Having such a shit internet connection that you are as retarded as this fujoshit.       My connection's fine, the archive just hadn't scraped that post yet. And for your information, I'm here for the /u/. Not that there's much of it.  And I'm not sure why you're replying to all those other guys when they were entirely correct in calling out your retardation, anyway. They were very obviously pixiv filenames. If you can't recognize that then you probably ought to go back to MAL or whatever other worthless shithole forum you crawled out of.      What's the chance of more gay in 3+1?    Not okay.     shallow satellite character  No. Makoto and Nagisa have amazing chemistry with all of their friends instead of just one.     Kaworu is dead.    Are you retarded? You responded to a Sourin pic by saying 'basically Makoto x everyone'. If you meant to respond to OP, you fucked up, otherwise you were probably just shitposting.    For now    There is no more cancerous group of people on /a/ than the cunts obsessed with "fanbases".    Sounds like denial to me    Denial of you not being a cunt    I don't have to be obsessed with the Seraph fanbase to make the observation that all the shitposters in this thread are Seraph fans asspained by the OP ship.   Stop fighting, this thread is getting gay.   Are you mentally ill?    What part of that post did you not understand?    No really, do you not recognize a fucking Pixiv filename?     shit up a thread you don't belong in   get called cancerous   call them a cunt because they hurt your feelings       The PMS is strong in this post.    At no-one has anyone called me cancerous in this thread.   Kurocock is best cock.  Can we at least have some canonical gay couples with on-screen romance, not just shipping shit?   Yeah, only a dumbass fujoshit like yourself doesn't notice that she constantly reposts her shit fanart in this thread.  https://archive.moe/a/search/image/<wbr>WnEdIOL1uxq6NllCOBbggw/  https://archive.moe/a/search/image/<wbr>hCrBCpc3kqnWjZ3IQBlbGw/</wbr>  </wbr>     Can you fuckers take it to ghost or some shit? We're trying to talk about hot cocks and you're gaying the whole thread up with your shitfit. All of you fuck off.   Yesterday I got called out for a normal pixiv filename  not knowing how to save images   What is this new meme?       You should fuck off back to tumblr.    Here, have OTP of the season.    The uniform he designed for Dog was the lewdest so probably.     I was just doing it to keep the thread bumped while the conversation died down, I'll stop now.     Love Stage a shit. What a terrible, terrible manga.    The show was good though, well other than the shit they pulled on the lewd scenes.   RIP  vampire scum     Okay, continue ignoring everything anyone says and just insisting that all the people not shitposting with you are fujoshits. That's fine too.     this idiot assumes that all instances of the same image will come up in the archive  There is an occult secret known as 'photoshop'.     Keep telling yourself that. Maybe you should try using your oxygen starved eyes more but considering the little blood flow you get from your hammy legs, that would be quite hard to do.    Au contraire my dear friend. My legs are not as salty as your tears..    and  are the cutest couple ITT.  Stop responding to cheap bait, there are some salty as hell underage anons with weak shitposting.    Picture unrelated but cute because they are best bros     They are the best but never talked about on /a/.    ..   But how is that surprising when your legbeard ends up absorbing all the sweat from your musky forest?      owari threads   filled with MUH BOOGEYMAN FUJOSHITS   Why would anyone even care or bother?       OTP      Abusing spoiler tags  <br/>     Shinoafags don't realize the cancer is coming from inside the house.    Up there with Aldnoah threads, they have been extreme cancer in the past week.    Fujoshits like yourself don't realize they are cancer in the first place      At least we know how to stay in our own threads and recognize Pixiv filenames.           https://archive.moe/a/thread/127132<wbr>179  There I fucking gave you the link. Go suck each others dicks here, because every meta shitpost anyone makes at this point is going to be reported.  </wbr>         But you don't stay in your own threads at all much less your containment board.    Not him  her , but how about you don't go in a thread with an OP titled 'ITT: gay couple', if you hate fujos and homo so much.    Why don't you take your thread and shove it back to  if you want to compete with /u/fags as best cancer.    As close to canon without being explicitly said so.      your thread  It's not my thread, faggot. I merely took part in posting twice. I just don't understand how you ended up here in the first place. I mean the OP is as explicit as it can get.     If only not Barnaby this show might be 9/10    You can keep crying about it, but it is an /a/-related thread and the mods are obviously fine with it. Your whining won't change shit.  Now post some homo or go back to your Shinoa circlejerk threads.      That doesn't really say much with a show like Free.   Arc-V is good but I miss when YGO was gay.    Implying its /a/ related    Implying the mods are fine with it   Plenty of your fujoshit threads have been deleted in the past. Don't think your tumblrshit is welcomed on /a/.         anime characters are not /a/ related  Then report it and move on.     And yet the homothreads are a long standing tradition in the board, funny that.    It's still gay. Or it was for a little while, at least.    True, the Mas/u/mi was strong. Why'd she have to disappear? She would've been great as a lancer.     tradition   Don't kid yourself. Everyone knows its the containment thread for you fujoshits and whenever you fujoshits leak out, you get called out and sent back to where you belong.  That's why you fujoshits always cry all the time in your fujoshit thread over people ripping apart your yaoishit fantasy in other threads.         I forgot Barnaby shitters could still exist in 2k15 but seems like you guys are like furniture around here.     Agreed. It's a damn shame they decided to sideline her. I'd trade Dennis for Masumi any day.    Kek All that assbleeding.  Pic related, only Bleach pairing that is worth a damn.      You should join us instead of being mad.    Doesn't change the fact that it is a tradition. And likely one that the fujos themselves created to deal with the irrational hatred they get.    Why the fuck is Dennis even a character? He's grating as hell.    He ruined the show with his drama.    Who knows. But I guess it could be worse. We could have to deal with that foreign kid.    He's fun to watch and competent. Also evil.     I forgot he existed until now. I wish I could have gone on with my life that way. May you stay forever carded, Aladdin.    Yuri is all or at least most of those things and he's not annoying. Bring back Yuri, fuck Dennis.  Actually bring back Yuto, I fucking miss him. The show is suffering without best boy.      Yet, this thread is still here so mods are okay with it. Stay mad.    He's a gimmick character. He's got all of Yuya's showmanship except he's also an evil spy. And we've known that for ages now and it's gone nowhere. I know YGO isn't really a series known for getting to things in a speedy manner, but I'm just bored of him at this point.    If it's gay it's gay.     How is loveless? Is it as shit as it fucking looks?     T&amp;B is a character drama at heart, so yeah you're gonna have drama within A drama. And it's not like Kotetsu was any better, drama around his power loss practically ate up the entire second half.    That's not loveless.    Loveless is complete and utter garbage in every possible way, though that image isn't loveless.    Loveless is SHIT.   Post more homo     A/Zfags would be great if slainefags killed themselves. As in they wouldn't exist to be populated by the six circljerkers who are still butthurt enough to care.    Slaine is literally the only good thing about that otherwise generic, throwaway mecha show.    Nevermind him dropping the soap. Where is Shinji's towel?   I just finished watching this for the first time. Its incredible how well it aged.  I know /a/ was all about Lucky Star years ago. I'm assuming we don't see threads anymore because people has already discussed everything about it.  How do you feel about Lucky Star, /a/nons? Would you like a to get a second season? How long it has been since you last watched it?      BUT HOW DO I EAT FOOD?!?!?!?!

Photoshop is the industry standard for image manipulation why would you think it's not enough for simple cleaning?  Wasn't there a bunch of scanlation guides on the internet?  Also, gimp is only for mactards and people too stupid to pirate photoshop.    A lot of people don't really recommend Gimp. It's probably passable, but you're better off with PS. I don't think it really matters what version you use, at least not a lot. Some people use content-aware fill for instance but then other people will say that's just lazy or whatever, or only use it sometimes.   tl;dr use whatever the fuck you want.     Gimp is also pretty damn buggy   No, you have to use InDesign.   I don't have too many issues with it, though the only thing I'm doing with gimp is create reaction images.   Photoshop is enough for anything and everything.   But can it bring Ed's mother back to life?    Illustrator is a better vector program    wow this looks pretty cool, but I don't think that anyone uses it for scanlations    That shit is to make magazines and books. You won't ever use it don't listen to him.    The photoshop / illustrator combo allows you to do anything, literally.      Illustrator  Why would you need it if you already have ps?      The only reason against GIMP is the content aware feature of Photoshop really. If you don't have content awareness, you can just use GIMP.     Content aware fill   Just do it with the stamp tool      GIMP has some content aware tools, they vary in effectiveness. Although I have yet to compare them to PS.    I was waiting for something like this.      It just werks bruh   Gimp has them too resynthesizer or heal selection.     gimp   mactards   More like Linux users. Photoshop has been available for Mac since version 1.      Not OP, but what are some recommended PNG settings for saving scans?    Is Photoshop CS6 enough to scanlate or do I need another program to? Or should I rather use Gimp or something?   If you're used to GIMP, use GIMP. If you're used to Photoshop, use Photoshop. For something like scanlation work they're both overkill.  Photoshop is Protoshop for pros who pro around with pro and color spaces and stuff like that you don't need to think about if you're not in the publishing or printing industry.  GIMP is an open source nearly-alternative to it, with 90% of the same functions and capabilities, but with a legacy UI that is quite different. This is the big thing, the UI: both Photoshop and GIMP are complex, and if you're used to one, you'll be driven crazy by the other. I guess technically Photoshop should be better (they must spend some money on UI design), but GIMP is not as bad as it used to be or is rumored to be.    I haven't had GIMP bug out on me in ages. This sounds like old reputation from 2004. Both GIMP and Photoshop are old and mature programs, so I don't expect either to be terribly buggy anymore.  Maybe if you're on Windows, but then you're just flagellating yourself.  Install Gentoo.                   old and mature  That's never true for open source programs. They're just buggy in stupid ways that no one will ever fix because it's too annoying. Ok, not ever, but enough years that people will use the alternatives instead.     I should say, for any GUI program. I have nothing against console applications.     No, you need Weebcut 9000 Pro Edition: Gentoo boogaloo. It comes with multiple templates for watermarks and donation requests, and has a built-in RSS client that lets you know if anyone is attempting to translate anything you are so you can throw a shitfit.     Vectors.    Shut up, Accelerator.   Can someone with no experience/didn't take a graphic design class with photoshop learn to do shit with it if I primarily use tutorials on youtube or some other source on the net?   I gave an outdated version a try but I gave up after 5 minutes because I was out of my comfort zone.     If you are used to GIMP, pirate Photoshop and use that.   Don't let those open source idiots convince you that your time is so worthless that you should inconvenience yourself with GIMP.       Yes. Start with Photoshop 7. Follow some tutorials on using layers, masks, dodge and burn and vectoring. Then when you're ready move up to CC and begin on more comlex tasks.     why would you think it's not enough for simple cleaning?   Because OP is a weeb fag who only ever uses computers for pirating cartoon porn?      stay mad NEET.     Yes, just mess around with shit until you get the hang of it. If you're completly out of your depth, you could try messing around in Flash or something, its got a lot of the same tools. And don't listen to , you can do 99% of anything you need to to with just layers, the magic wand, filters, hue/saturation and free transform.      I can do some free transforming with your mom, in between some layers, huehuehue/saturation      You're retarded. GIMP is just as efficient as Photoshop if you actually make effort to learn it. It will also be always available on any OS, for free. Once you learn it, you're set for life. Adobe is moving PS to the cloud so you won't be able to pirate new versions anymore. If the prospect of being fleeced by a big corporation sounds exciting to you then go ahead, learn Photoshop.     /p/ here Because photoshop lacks several features and does a lot of things horribly. While it is a jack-of-all trades software it is really expensive if you are going to make money with it, the commercial license costs USD2500. Did I mention that it is terribly slow?        scanlations   commercial license       slow  Only if you're using a toaster   commercial license  Why the fuck would you need that for scanlating?    caring about newer versions of PS  The old versions still do everything you could ever want           What's the best program for digital painting and drawing?  What's the best version of PS?    Adobe is moving PS to the cloud  I just downloaded CS6, but at the site I got it I could already download a cracked CC (2015)...        GIMP is just as efficient as Photoshop  I've extensively worked with both and this is just not true. The only reason you are defending this shitty program is your ideology, not the software itself.   you're set for life  Assuming that people will still use the same programs in 20 years, assuming that people will keep developing GIMP, assuming that nobody even less competent than the current developers is going to take over messing everything up even further than it already is and so on and so forth.   You are also implying that it's hard to switch to a different/inferior program once you've learned how to use the current industry leader other programs are copying.           USD2500     yeah, I learned how to clean a black and white comic page first before knowing what layers are.    That's the sort of money you can demand when you have a quasi monopoly.      not pirating       commercial license  You don't understand what that means if you suggest pirating it - though of course the original anon was stupid for bringing it up in the context of this thread.      GIMP is just as efficient as Photoshop if you actually make effort to learn it.  Nah man, nah. I used CS2 in wine over GIMP for most complicated things. GIMP has shit layers, it has shit masking, and a lot of it is still awkward designed by engineers for artists crap. GIMP is great for what it is, but what it is isn't Photoshop.    Assuming  I'm assuming that GIMP will eventually because less awkward, maybe after a fork sometime years and years from now for a large developer turnover.        What do you guys think about leveling until blacks are black and whites are white?  I used to do that shit religiously because that was what I was told when I began learning, until I just woke up one day and realised the art isn't magically going to look any better just because some dark shades of grey are now black.  However I'm afraid to start doing that shit now because literally everyone else does it and if I don't, people will likely call it shit just because they're not used to it.  Pic related, will it really look that much better if the greys were black instead?         In my opinion you shouldn't go ffffff next to 000000. That's a huge contrast and your readers' eyes won't appreciate it long-term. However, what values are actually good to use, I do not know.    Topaz for cleaning. Or just use level. For typeset it is actualy far easier using InDesign.   I tried to use InDesign. Couldn't really get the hang of it. The whole having to put the text in boxes didn't suit me. Plus, I feel like I have more freedom with PS when I need to warp text in any way.     GIMP. It's also open source.     the problem aren't greys. leveling to something slightly lighter than zero is fine.  your pictures suffers from blurry, aliased edges. look at the quarter notes for example.       Topaz for cleaning.  it's good at what it does, but people tend to overuse it.     Nobody will call shit on your scans. Speaking as somebody who released "scans" made with a regular camera. Most people just don't care and there are always worse things to get mad at like giant watermarks and unreadable fonts.    PS is as open source you want it to be.       if you do grey on white text I will fight u in real life  If black on white text hurts your eyes, maybe your monitor brightness shouldn't be set to surface-of-the-sun.      Photoshop is like Windows.  Everybody has it, nobody pays for it.       As a mostly proud linux user, ignore cucks and steal photoshop. your scans will not be imbued with magic Free Software sparkles no matter what tool you use.     How can I fix the "..." when I typeset in PS? You know what I mean.    grey  That's an amazingly imprecise description. In fact, I wasn't suggesting grey on white, I was suggesting grey on grey. What does that mean? A uniform text? No. Are you retarded?  But I agree that text should make maximum use of contrast, since it's very thin lines where every detail counts.            Sorry I was being somewhat imprecise.  Basically, assuming it's ordinary b/w manga, the black should be #000000 and the white should be #ffffff.  The same hurrdurr lighten-the-black is happing in web design, and it's fucking dumb there as well. Even Bootstrap, which is overall amazing, uses like #303030 as the body colour  gross          Well, I guess we'll just disagree.  But don't worry, I'm not a scanlator so you'll never have to deal with my grey on grey shit.      Depends on the scans. If levelling them that much would destroy some measure of the original, I would never go that far. I don't really mind grey, but when it's clearly not even close to black, or when it's clearly not even close to white, then I would at least do something. But the thing I hate most is overlevelled, Mangastream tier garbage.     But I agree that text should make maximum use of contrast, since it's very thin lines where every detail counts.  Actually, no I do not agree on this point. Picture related. While I wouldn't force people to read text this small, the contrast is plenty sufficient.         I fucking hate the art so much.     It got better, at least Accel now looks like Accel after the hair change. Well, kind of. At least he stopped the thin white lines on black hair bullshit that kept being an annoyance.     that's retarded, have you ever even read an actual physical manga?     Clip Studio Paint   How about paint.NET?  Are anon black's typesetting tutorials the best one or are there any better ones? Also what does he mean with "Do not use text boxes"?    he  AnonBlack is just an attention whore, use www.redhawkscans.com/showthread.php<wbr>?3308-Typesetting-introduction</wbr>      And those are equally bad.    You can just click with the text tool and use enter to make a new line.   Are text boxes that bad?          Are text boxes that bad?  No, just an autistic person.     Shit works fast, nigga. The problem is - it lacks features, so you can use it for resizing images, for changing quality or image type and editing easy stuff, or even play with layers n shit, but for something more complex consider ps/gimp/whatever the fuck you like.       Are text boxes that bad?  As long as you make sure everything is lined properly there's nothing wrong with it. But just letting a text box line everything for you will give you bad results.      Microsoft Paint     It's enough for any sane person. Most people would read good shit even if it has no redrawing and it uses the same font everywhere.     Didn't they switch over to subscription method?    screenshotcomparison.com/comparison<wbr>.php?id=128256 How does one achieve to remove dust and jpeg artifacts as well as that without taking a hour?  That's probably not Topaz since details aren't killed.   </wbr>    That's probably not Topaz since details aren't killed.  It is. Fun fact: you can use topaz and not lose too much detail so long as you know what you're doing.     Shhhh, don't let them know.   I used GIMP for everything before but only after switching to PS I noticed how much the former lacked in things.  Photoshop my post out of this thread and into a better one.   Worst Gundam OVA.     Oh yeah? Prove me that you can achieve a such nice result with Topaz then.     Decent reaction image.   Serious question here: How can I get faster at typesetting? Ar ethere any shortcuts or things I hav eto keep in mind to be faster? I normally need like up to ten minutes for a single page    Please, artifacts everywhere. Some surface blur, slight sharpening and grain are needed, then it can be considered decent.     not using paint   not using yellow font   not editing 600x245 images   not adding grain   not upscaling it and then resizing to different size  it's like you don't hate people         Copy paste the word first,edit later    Is this better?    Just like my old VHS tapes.    If you experiment with Ps you'll eventually find some shortcuts. Arrange your workspace so that you have what you need with the least number of clicks possible. Make extensive use of shortcuts and actions. Ten minutes for a page is way too much. I take ten minutes to level, clean and typeset a page in normal circumstances.     kek    You forgot  not using colored semi-transparent boxes over the Japanese text      Needs more grain   "Identify images with bread"  top kek        The problem I have with typesetting is centering the text boxes. Sometimes it takes about one or two minutes to get a single one to fit perfectly.      being this autistic with centering      not saving your pages as .gif with a 1.5 second loading screen added     We've gone where no VHS tape has gone before.     Also, gimp is only for mactards and people too stupid to pirate photoshop.  An excuse to post this? Nice.     It took me a while to realize that it's about grains and not "muh seeds".    Why would seeds matter in UC timeline?     He turns into the grain  Deep.     Like I would know, I haven't seen Seed.     not being this autistic with centering  Enjoy your offsets for few pixels that you somehow overlooked and can't fix anymore.     I don't look at it after I've released it.    This is why InDesign is faster for typeset.    And that's the only way to deal with this shit, otherwise I won't able to sleep.    That's actually a decent way to be calm at nights and not being obsessed with autism every time.      that pixellation   What is this, a page for ants?   Otherwise, that looks like a pretty cool function.          Etotama raws are bad.   we /g/ now?    Please teach me senpai      now  It's like you missed all 10bit discussion.     I have no idea what's going on there, but I'm sure that's not who the pages are supposed to look. How do you output the typesetting from InDesign and put them on the actual image?    So is there really no alternative besides GIMP or PS?  I've always used GIMP because it's free, but I fucking hate it. It's not that GIMP lacks features, it just lacks common sense. The UI is a clusterfuck and features often lack tooltips and their functions are counter-intuitive half the time.  I've seen so many cool things from PS, and I've heard it's also got a complicated UI, but I can only believe they actually put some thought into what tools should have priority for ease of use, since it was designed by professionals instead of a rag tag group of engineers.       Just pirate it and free yourself.    I would much rather a free alternative to pirating commercialware.   But I guess in this case money actually does buy superior quality.     Are there any plugins I should install on CS6? I hear topaz is good for scanlations, is there anything else?   Jesus, why do the series with the shittest art get picked up and get big?    Accel got picked up being Raildex already has a set translator, js06, and multiple raw providers for LN and manga.    Lazy Nezumi is good if you need to free hand draw stuff.    Anime and technology are quite compatible hobbies.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127124596   Topaz Plugin pack - 1,1 GB  The only Topaz you'd ever use are Clean and Denoise, which are a lot smaller than that.     Done with waifu2x, denoise high, without upscaling. I'm the one who put this comparison a month ago, I was testing the efficiency of waifu2x's denoiser. I found the results really good but it'd fuck with the dark tones, making them darker. You can't have the same result now waifu2x has been trained (just tested a min ago).      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127124596  Your first line is /r9k/ shit. Please avoid that kind of shit on /a/. It doesn't give the rest of your post anything. It's just ugly.    Anyone who uses auto-formatting text boxes for typesetting is a heathen. They rarely make the correct legibility choice in shaping the dialogue, using the correct hyphenation if any, any kerning changes, etc.    yeah but the site I used only has them all as one dl, which is pretty shit    they did with Photoshop CC    Most of these are obvious, any guide on cleaning pages?    seconding this   i prefer paint.net    I did too for a long time, but PS automatically puts each text input into a separate layer and you can edit it later.  Back with .Net I had to do all of that manually.        Gimp  Never use it, if you can use photoshop. Difference in ergonomics alone worth it, not to mention that you waste 2-5 more time with Gimp doing the same work and receiving subpar results.     Just use gut feel with text boxes and you're good    Lol literally true. He probably doesn't even know how to pirate vidya.  I've used both and GIMP works fine for something as simple as scanlations. Photoshop is only better in that it's more casualized.        Casualized  So it's more convenient.      samefagging this awkwardly      http://www.insidescanlation.com/etc<wbr>/The-Idiots-Guide-to-Editing-Manga/<wbr>guide/main.html  Cleaning guide here ain't too bad  </wbr></wbr>      still using captcha v2      Anime Ace 2   I hate this memefont      Depends on scans.

Hippie pls    How would you optimize this script any further? http://pastebin.com/9zX2Gw0x      What do you guys think about leveling until blacks are black and whites are white?  It's needed for filesize reduction. And not to look like shit. Picrelated for example. Obviously you have to know how (there's many way besides mindless leveling) and if you need to do it on this particular scan, but in general there's no "if", only "how".       Also what does he mean with "Do not use text boxes"?    But just letting a text box line everything for you will give you bad results.  That's just retarded way of using it. Literally a monkey with photoshop. You set box, paste text, then set text in proper way using [Enter] to separate text on next line as you could do without box. Also hanging punctuation also should be applied before doing anything. https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/u<wbr>sing/formatting-paragraphs.html#adj<wbr>ust_paragraph_spacing</wbr></wbr>        not just using free ps cs2    this is probably the most retarded question do you know how to write "..." without the space in between by some fonts?

It basically phones home and rechecks itself to make sure it's not hacked or a copy. Eventually, the old downloadable versions will disappear off the internet or be filled with chinese trojans to get hold of your finance info. Either way, Adobe will laugh when that happens. For now, they grimace at the piracy. I have a friend who works for adobe, and he's confident about the subscription approach for the future.     But I can download CC from warez sites     Just pirate it and free yourself.  The pirate photoshops have trojans in them.     They are already using subscription in their CC products. And it got cracked the day after it was introduced.    I'm sure someone will find a way to break it eventually if it's enough in demand     The pirate photoshops have trojans in them.  I'm using one right now, what are you talking about? Everything's fine      being technologically retarded   I bet you download all those "Clean My PC" programs too.      Well a lot of the downloads probably do, you just have to avoid the obvious .exe files    my patch was an .exe and nothing changed     new generation would not know how to use photoshop   they will be using other programs for funny picture editing while in school, and then use same program for work   in the end adobe going bankrupt or returning to old distribution model  Also, for a moment the only feature I would really want to improve is content aware fill.       I'll have you know that I've pirated Creative Cloud Flash, Illustrator and Photoshop. It don't mean shit. People will find ways around it.    That already happened and it got cracked in 5 seconds. Fucking retard.    My grandmother works for anime and says that you don't know shit.     It may have been cracked, but that doesn't mean it's open to the general public. Me, I don't see how I'd get my hands on a pirated PS version.      So you really are an idiot?     but that doesn't mean it's open to the general public.  I can dl it right now from a well known warez site     I'm tech illiterate, but not enough of an idiot to be oblivious to my state as a tech illiterate. I won't select a random torrent that I can't trust.   I don't doubt that.       Google photoshop full?   Did everyone used the .exe/PainteR release of cs6?   That's precisely the thing that I won't do because I'm confident it would get me some malware.  I didn't make that post to get help. I don't actually need the program at the moment. I just wanted to make a point about the general availability of PS.      might as well post the whole fucking score  please     Literally few seconds in google.    If it wasn't an executable I was looking for but some music or a movie, I might do that. But see .   Thanks Utopia   kill yourself already    Hungry skeleton on the left.    what do skeletals eat    If you too paranoid or pussy, then just check crack files for viruses and such, or launch sandbox before applying said crack, or check whole system after applying, etc.    Cheese and other milk-based stuff.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127132922  Original source image    You can just check the comments usually too if the torrent is popular enough    Yeah, internet comments are the best source for good information.     Jesus christ. Tank v2 when?     He'll just think that all those people are retards, unlike him, and can't be trusted.    Jesus christ, that overuse of Topaz.    You can use Photoshop CS2 for free. You won't need crack or anything.     shittopia   tank  Good one. Fuck, why people don't wait for tanks anymore.       Again, stop giving me tips. I don't deserve them anyway. You are missing the point which is that retards like me are actually the majority on the internet. Pirating movies is trivial. Barely anybody pirates PS.    unlike him,  Where did I imply that?           Can someone please apply as the cleaner for this so that the rest of us can be spared, thanks. I know they're mag raws and all, but that Topaz is ridiculous.      Barely anybody pirates PS.  Don't most people who have PS pirate it?     Thanks for the laugh.    rate    It seems to be in the top 3 of most pirated programs. Okay, maybe I'm a retard *and* wrong.  That's awkward.       The solution to overfiltering is not to apply more filtering. What the hell is wrong with you?    On the left: cleaned shitty god awful toiler paper raws On the right: digital raws from the publishers     Right is definitely not digital.     the solution to overfiltering is not doing anything  I used only noise reduction filter on the left to remove this hideous moiré. And sharp after that.     Painting - SAI Drawing - SAI Colouring - Photoshop.      Just do it with the stamp tool  You dumb shits really don't know when it's better to use one or the other, eh?          Can we please have some scans to practice cleaning with?   Just remake it in sibelius or lilipad or whatnot.     see       ask elemhunter, he has thousands of pages      GIMP is just as efficient if you actually make effort to learn it  I used GIMP back in college when I was pretty much broke, and it's serviceable for scantalation, but once I had the chance to access PS and use it, the jump in the quality I was able to produce and time it took to finish projects was pretty damn dramatic.     I'll just use this thread to ask: I'm working on a manga right now, together with a friend, and I'd like to publish it in English and German. Wild Words is okay for English text, but I can't find a manga font that supports lower case letters and special characters like ß or ö. Is there any font I could use for this project?      Is it worth upgrading to CC from CS6?      Not really, apparently CAF was improved, but you shouldn't be relying on CAF that much anyway.     Do we know in what way it "improved"?     It's CAF, the algorithm is probably less retarded.     CAF was enough to land me a spot on a scanlation team at one stage before I dropped out. CAF's better than clone stamp in some circumstances as PS's pressure recognition and brush control is retarded.      enough to land me a spot on a scanlation team at one stage   That's not really saying much, the quality of scanlation is shit, fantastic, and everything in between.       How about CC Wild Words Lower?    WildWords International.    The pixels are often misaligned in the scan to begin with so clone stamp offers little to no help.   And unlike SAI with good brush control and an actual stabiliser, Photoshop is shit to draw on to begin with and often causes shoelacing of the brushes and poor pressure/size control. It's noticeable if you draw on a scan that the size 2 default brush is quite fuzzy. I have several painting brushes which handle the line widths better however these edges are too sharp and the linewidth is too variable to use on a regular basis.  Furthermore, the pen tool is not a subsitute for actual brush work, especially the faked brush pressure. It bellies in the middle and at either end, it looks incredibly fake. Without faked line pressure it can end up looking worse as there is no smooth starting point and no smooth ending point.  You can therefore argue that using the pen tool to fill in shapes would prove an adequate alternative, however the trained eye can easily pick up the difference in a shape made by the pen tool and the artist's original linework.  Ultimately all scanlation relies on resizing the entire thing or typesetting over the top to hide the differences. Clone/CA move/CA fill all have the benefits and weaknesses. It's ultimately about trying them all and picking the best one for the job.            Depends, do you respect your freedom?   Photoshop all the way.   Everyone respect it, and that's why everyone pirate photoshop - for freedom! Seriously, what kind of retard will buy $2500 software to pirate manga afterwards?   look at this quality Utopia chapter 141. it's their raw provider's raw on the right    No fucking texture  Why. That's unexcusable considering that Topaz Denoise is already cracked.      $2500 software  That was the price for the commercial license, dumbass. Don't mindlessly repeat it. You can get PS for some $10 per month as a student. Note that I am not supporting this. Renting programs is insane in my opinion. I'm just putting the facts straight.      here's the 10th mystery raw pages he gives to Utopia. Today Utopia just uses the digital magazine releases that comes out on mondays.    By the way, the warp tool on both photoshop and gimp is quite horrible (granted, it is much worse in gimp with the small as shit preview window) when it comes to "straighten" pages that were lazily taken with a camera.   Is there any way to draw a path along the curvature and instruct photoshop to warp the picture so that it becomes straight, or am I forced to fiddle with the pins/warp anchors ?      How's this?    Really bad    Then how to improve?    I-I thought it looked good    Anything learned in college can be learned on the internet for free, except the people skills   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127137751  Is this better or worse?               Not knowing about Inkscape or MSPaint   Get out.               <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127137751  Can I also get an example of a cleaning done on that page done properly?    Better.      Thanks man.     What's wrong with scanning the thing at its native resolution, so you don't have to scrawl your own halftone over the original art?     Could I ask where you got the halftone from?  <br/>      And if you're obliterating the original shading, why not use a flat grey so that it can be scaled?     not getting rid of moire noise  Why everyone do this shit?     You mean the grays? That's how the dots end up when you downscale the image.    ...and translated.    Actually I get it, it's just denoise run repeatedly. I only ran it once.    Why are you downscaling the image?  Are you sending it back to 1996?      Because no one wants to download 40MB zip which only has 16 pages.    I'll download a 40MB zip, but I won't download a 100-150MB zip. God what were those guys thinking.    That would be a monthly manga with proper 40+ pages like they should have and not 20 pages like some lazy faggots like to draw.     Hiding that sexy pattern      sexy  That's a strange way saying "horrible".     Maybe to your shitty standards.     Photoshop CS6 is more then enough to do anything related to scanlation. Actually you can even use GIMP.  I have a friend that still uses Photoshop 7 for example, and that shit is ancient by tech standards, and he does it just fine. So there's that.        shiteater saying something about shitty standards  Oh boy.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127138888  Fuck off frogshit poster.    If you didn't rely on your .atns.    you guys are still lucky. look at pic related. how would you guys clean this page? we do those every time.      The result.    use clip studio if you're going to redraw or clean. its the best you can get for cheap if buying a program to scanlate.    you guys suck. stop using fucking actions.   What is the scanlation community short on, /a/? I used to think it was translators but it seems one out of every five anons have a basic grasp of moon these days and we have more competent translators every year. Proofreaders? Good cleaners?    Good cleaners   Lol no      How? I'd wait for the tank, you idiot.    Common sense    Competent translators and raw providers.  I think raw providers more than anything.   I'm currently trying to proofread something that's being translated from fucking Chinese and the jap raws I need are incredibly hard to come buy, I'll have to buy them on my own at some point.  And of course all this could be avoided if they got an actual japanese translator.         still using ms paint  why? for what purpose?      raw providers  Elemhunter has got you covered.     That's not an acceptable solution for weekly manga.   Meiru sucks! World-three is SHIT   He's not going to buy everything.    No, it's the solution acceptable for any kind of manga, unless it's some web shit.    Not according to demand it's not.     I must work with absolute shit raws every week rather that once in four months with good ones because people I don't know want me to do so     I don't think you realize yet that most scanlators do it for e-peen and if you aren't keeping up with a weekly series despite picking it up you aren't going to get it since someone else will do it.    your retarded, because that's a last resort for raws even for most slow groups.    Only if you like sophisticated manga for sophisticated anons such as myself.   Selector Infected WIXOSS Re/verse fucking when!?   After the movie.   Do you guys replace greys?   No.    yes, don't trust     Something like this has replaced greys right?<br/>    No.    No, that's just how the tones end up looking after topaz and downscaling the page. It has nothing to do with replacing grays.    For scanlation Photoshop. But that doesn't mean Gimp is shit, at least it used to be better than PS for upscaling a few years ago, not sure if that changed.     Yeah, fuck incomplete bold letters.      GIMP is plenty fine for scanlating.  PS has some degree of edge over it, but they're fundamentally the same. If you're used to either one, then there isn't really any reason to switch to the other unless for some reason you intend to put in the time and effort to get yourself used to the other.     Can we make it illegal to denoise tanks? It makes me physically ill.    Example?   What artist do you wish had more scanlations?   Bobobo's latest tank.  I cannot believe it isn't translated. It is truly tragic.      Explain.    Total texture replacement I believe. I've seen that kind of retardation myself.    I haven't seen anyone do that since the early Rosario+Vampire II scans.     I have a friend that still uses Photoshop 7 for example, and that shit is ancient by tech standards, and he does it just fine. So there's that   I still own photoshop 4 which was purchased in a package deal long long long ago for about $600 in THOSE years's dollars but that was because it was bundled with a scanner. So it would be over $1500 in today's dollars. That was a pretty good scsi scanner. Remember when the best peripherals used scsi and not usb? Yeah. That long ago.    I used to think it was translators  There's a lot of translators out there now. Many of the best ones are on the private sites though and some are native japanese translating for their friends under the stipulation that translations not be posted publicly. Available to all members of the private site is fine though as that isn't public although this one has hundreds of members.         There 3 types of translators:  Chinese to English translators: They're usually the most common. Why?   Well, there are 1.3 billion Chinese speakers out there. Chinese scanlation community is BIGGER then English (By sheer size). So usually Chinese translations of Japanese manga are released FIRST (About 6 to 36 hours after Japanese release/leak online). Then Bilingual Chinese speakers (Singaporeans, American Born Chinese or ESL Chinese Speakers) Translate that to English. So essentially a translation of a translation.  Japanese to English translators: They're the 2nd most common, believe it or not. There are 2 sub-types:  1- People learning Japanese (N5 to N3): They're not proficient users of Japanese, they're LEARNING. So they make a lot of guess work, and hope their proofreaders translate that garbage to English. These are the majority   2- People proficient in Japanese or Fluent (N2+): They're people that essentially KNOW Japanese sufficiently to translate something, these people are RARE, not as common as you think. Example of one person like that is the infamous PROzess.  Korean to English Translator: These are the 3rd type. They usually translate webcomics (Naver and Daum) stuff. Quality is really variable as their levels of proficiency in Korean are all over the place, so it depends on the particular translator.               Do you have robes and membership rings in your secret translation club too?     People proficient in Japanese or Fluent (N2+)   PROzess   0/10       You should add a dimension for English fluency.    You forgot the 4th one. The Japanese to spanish ones.      I could clean better than that.     Sorry, but  looks better than yours.  It's funny how many people in these threads shit on scanlators but can't prove themselves competent. 90% of the people who criticize scanlators on /a/ have never produced a scanlation at all, let alone one of good quality or on a regular basis. I can't count the number of times someone's said "I could do better," but then either have nothing to show for it, or present something that is terrible. These threads are a joke.      would read  over other guy, just saying    tfw your translator hasn't contacted you for a month    The sad thing is there are people who consider that good cleaning and enjoy pages where detail is just blasted away from blur and darkening.      not keeping regular contact with people you work with      This isn't the first time though, and they're probably busy with IRL shit so I guess I could wait for a bit before sending them another email. They usually send me and the proofreader a bunch of translation to use for the raws we have after the long delay.  Can't blame them since I was real busy for the last few months too.         typesetting guide   the typesetting in the typesetting guide looks like ass   Why am I not surprised        Arghhh... after countless attempts I finally got it. So the to get the super smooth greys you run Topaz Clean over the top of the resized version or something or the other. ;~; now to figure out how to get rid of the artefacts.   Where do translators even get their scans from? Is there a database?   Ever heard of something called a 'scanner' anon? Apparently those things can be used to convert objects into digital images. I know, it's surprising.   Or they just download the internet raws.         How can one person possibly be this retarded, do you also think that MangaFox is an English publisher?      Is there a database?  Yes. Elite scanalators live in them too.     If you want to be a true elite scanlator you use pub raws and a free blog service, then claim you need donations for hosting and books.    By paying tribute to Daiz. He will then have his minions in the cartel send you the scans.   Use GIMP. It's better than Photoshop, the only reason people think otherwise is because they use the buggy Windows port rather than the native Linux version, and are used to Photoshop and refuse to learn anything new.   It is also 100% free open source software, while Adobe Photoshop is a restrictive proprietary application controlled by Adobe, who will likely, and I hope they do, fuck you over by soon making it impossible to pirate due to it moving to a subscription based cloud model. You will be forced to use an abandonware rotting proprietary application, which isn't sustainable.      , fuck you over by soon making it impossible to pirate due to it moving to a subscription based cloud model.  CC is already cracked     Scanlation is nigh impossible without Topaz Clean and Topaz Redraw. You'll be punching yourself in the face.     the only reason people think otherwise is because they use the buggy Windows port rather than the native Linux version, and are used to Photoshop and refuse to learn anything new.  So it *is* buggy and your real advice should be to install some form of linux.     Wait for tanks friend      So the only reason GIMP is better is that I will need to install a different OS? Yeah, fuck your freedom shit, I'll stick Windows.   making it impossible to pirate due to it moving to a subscription based cloud model  I'll just stick to my current CS6. It's got me by and I don't see why it can't continue to.       You can wait for it yourself.     Scanlation is nigh impossible without Topaz Clean and Topaz Redraw.   Obviously not.   Well I hope they try harder. Have fun relying off cracks and hoping Adobe doesn't just decide to fuck you over any time they feel like.   No only the Windows port is buggy, not the native Linux version.             native Linux version of GIMP   better than other ports  ahahahahahahah /g/ pedophile defending shitty programs yet again. fuck off to /g/      GIMP has colour to alpha, Photoshop has CAF and everything else. SAI is great for lineart and painting.   I have a portable version of GIMP installed so I can use Colour to Alpha which Photoshop somehow still doesn't have about five years on.       Jojo will never have high-quality scans   Part 4 still uses the duwang translation, just proofread     Can you show me what your scanlations look like when using GIMP?     Adobe doesn't just decide to fuck you over any time they feel like.  I seems like you don't know what you are talking about. If you install the cracked version CC doesn't even ask back at adobe anymore if it's pirated or not. They can't get you for it. Pirated CC is just like the normal one, the only flaw is that you have to wait for the crack for new version. But I rather wait instead of paying hundreds of dollar     It's more of an /ic/ than a /g/ matter, honestly.    people are still responding to GIMP retards     colour to alpha  Never needed it for scanlations     Only faggoty jump manga and similar paper quality magazines would be notably affected. Everything else would just make people have to put some basic effort in.  GIMP is for homosexuals though.       Not reading all that bullshit.    I'll just stick to my current CS6.    Yes you go ahead and enjoy that proprietary abandonware, tell me how it feels 5-10 years from now. It might not even be able to run on newer versions of Windows by then.     If you install the cracked version CC doesn't even ask back at adobe anymore if it's pirated or not.   It's a proprietary application, you don't know what it can and can't do. You think the crack can stop 100% of all possible Adobe backdoors?               5-10 years from now  I think I'll have bigger issues to worry about if I'm somehow still scanlating manga in 5-10 years.      You think the crack can stop 100% of all possible Adobe backdoors?   no one who pirated it gets rekt   GUYS TRUST ME I'M A SECRET ADOBE SPY I NOW YOU ALL ARE GETTING FUCKED BY THEM RIGHT NOW  How about getting that stick out of your ass       I know but I use to to remove backgrounds when bored or doing draws. Photoshop has masks, but nothing will ever beat the ease of c to a. It's painful to me that nobody has bothered adding it into CC because it's getting a stage when CC's masking is actually usable.     You still haven't shown me cleaned and redrawn LQ non-tank scans sans text made exclusively using GIMP. I'd use it if it works, but I don't believe that it would.       Use whatever OP, they gives the same results more or less. You need to be good or the end result will be shitty. I cleaned pic related in gimp.     Raw?     1 year ago, one anon asked help to scanlate keyman, i did some color page and other pages, i don't have the raw no more. But i did everything in gimp.       I'd use it if it works   No you wouldn't. Anyway anon posted a good example of GIMP scanlation:        I also did a really well done nude edit of merlin from nanatsu no taizai, but i can't find it anymore.      No only the Windows port is buggy, not the native Linux version.   missing the point that badly       merlin from nanatsu no taizai  WHERE THE FUCK IS IT YOU ASSHOLE     He said LQ non-tank scans. I'm pretty sure Keyman is from tank scans, which isn't as difficult to clean.    Although to be honest I'm much more interested in seeing what you drew underneath the 'KRASHSSS!!' text using the GIMP. How's the pressure sensitivity?   I already have a copy of the GIMP installed. I used it for two years prior to Photoshop (which I have now been using for five years) but I use SAI more than either of the programs.       The LQ scans I find practically impossible to clean without Topaz.  I find it practically impossible to clean with Topaz too, though. Have to learn the methodology because I have been so reliant on HQ scans for so long.       How's the pressure sensitivity?   I have a wacom intuos 3, but that time i used only the mouse. I have an ungodly steady hand, i even sculpt in 3d with the mouse.       Keyman's SFX are in English from the start.    How's CC's content aware compared to CS6? Any improvement?    It's quite improved. I've been using CA since CS4.    Aw shoot. I might have to get CC after all. Clone stamp is great but sometimes CA works wonders.    Just get it cracked.  CA, Clone stamp and that selective area drag thing for the dream team.  Now all PS needs is actual brush support and a stabiliser maybe.         Just get it cracked.  Yeah that's what I meant. Thanks for the advice, mate.   and a stabiliser maybe  One day.        I'm using Lazy Nezumi. It's pretty good, but SAI's is far better.     Lazy Nezumi   If your computer can handle your art software, then it will be able to handle Lazy Nezumi Pro without any performance problems  Hope it's not bullshit.      No performance problems but it's a bit buggy sometimes when I click a hidden layer or some sort. It's most likely because only the earlier version is available  cracked .   This scanlation thread is dull, no one's actually discussing techniques or how to improve. Just gimp vs PS as usual, but with a surprising lack of shitposting.   How does it handle patterns? For example, removing the selected part on the left.     Can't you just erase all its tracks from registry and run 30-day trial over and over? I haven't done this in so many years, so I don't really know if there's some sort of security against this nowadays.    perm cracked version in the archives or on CG peers.   Pic related. I have ctrl+shift + &gt; assigned to expand selection. On closer view there is almost always distortion however for smaller CA fills it's usually more accurate.       found it https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u<wbr>/198190031/Lazy%20Nezumi%20Pro.zip</wbr>      Man, they're expensive as fuck. No way I'm buying them just to make a no-profit manga.  I could dig up a version of Wild Words lower on /gd/, but even they don't have Wild Words International because it's way too fucking expensive.       There's no such thing as a 'commercial license for Photoshop' fukboi, the EULA explicitly denies it and businesses pay a discounted rate off the standard price of $10 a month for batch buys.  No wonder you browse /p/, they're pretty fucking delusional over there.      So not much compared to 5.1   I have a script for Hakumei to Mikochi c01, hoping to get it out there so that maybe someone competent can pick it up. It needs an editor, so I'll dump it later. x1483, ebook rip.   Wouldn't it be easier to CAF it in smaller parts for less distortion? And will CAF ever get good enough to not cause so much distortion?    Does CC Astro City Int work for what you want?    Here you go: http://www.mediafire.com/download/q<wbr>3ul1m69jcyih3l/WildWords_intl.zip  Thank the anon who posted it on /a/ a year or two ago.  </wbr>     edit pictures in PS and import to Illustrator/InDesign for the typing.  in short: PS works in pixels, pixalated fonds suck so you can't upscale the picture afterwars  Illustrator and InDesign works with vectorized fonts and is in general more user friendly for typing and layout, also better management for printing files if you wan't to let your stuff get printed         I'll check it out, thanks   I searched the archives like a madman but I couldn't find shit. Thanks!       I can webrip most web fonts for you as I learned the process from /gd/ if you need anything from myfonts (and obviously since scanlating is my hobby I'd also be interested in grabbing those fonts). However, the webfont cannot be an image or the process will fail.   banned for trying to post a font  o-ok ;_;    Obviously how good it it depends on my laziness. Which reigns supreme. The one on the right is maybe a touch better? I seem to be seeing a few black holey type objects in those dots. Probably my terrible eyes.    Yeah it always works. Just takes a bit longer. It's always the relative time consumed by CA vs clone stamp.             I was hoping it didn't make the blur anymore. Or did it better overall.    Kek. Improvements to CA, if I recall correctly, were listed in the changelog but that might have been designed for artists and/or photographers. At least it's more functional than that nonworking gimmick known as camera shake reduction.     Learn to google.

You're an idiot, I already said I found Wild Words lower in the same post you're quoting. I was looking for Wild Words International. That's literally the first link I found.      </wbr> </wbr>       Sorry for been a idiot and btw I got those fonts but this idiot isn't going to share it cause I'm idiot.    All I want is a sub for printroot. ;_; I'm on what and bestfilez already.  Someone figured out how to grab about 50% of the links from there  however I'd love a bot to auto generate the combos for me...   Easy as shit until they find some method of fooling it. And the method is pretty public. http://ge.tt /9sTVY2J2/v/0         Are you gonna cry?      Another example of a guy who only prefers GIMP because it's part of his "free software for free people who care about their freedoms such as myself"-religion.      The problem is that freedom is a meaningless phrase that we are indoctrinated to love.    Well, you had it coming with your "YouSuck" jpg and your inability to read. I don't need your fonts, I'll just look it up on /gd/.   Thanks mate, you're awesome. I'm at work right now but I'll try that shit once I'm home.       I usually just download the internet raws for the tanks, most of the time they're just good enough to justify not bothering with finding a raw provider.    Forgot to add but:  I believe webrips are mostly the same/usable like the original in most respects with exception to the checksum, signature, size and I think rarely, the character set (also known as the glyph set). So some glyphs may be missing from the webrip compared to the originals.   pdfrips/swf rips I think have already been shown to be of visibly reduced quality compared to the originals.         I hate not being in contact with the other group members, I want them in an IRC channel and I want to know who they are, what anime they are watching this season and why the hell are they not translating that new chapter I've been asking them for days.    hi i'm a game developer that had game of the year in 2014, i just wanted to stop by to tell you that gimp is garbage and if you use it you'll never amount to anything    what anime they are watching this season  For what purpose?     Stop being such a clingy girl.     You have all the reasons to despise those people. Just don't despise open source software, it's unbelievable what they can do.       What the dick else could one use? Unless you're a GIMP masochist.  Topaz clean for shitty raws + clone tool for redraws, all you need.        Because photoshop lacks several features and does a lot of things horribly.   Name them faggot.      It's unbelievable how shitty GIMP is, that's for sure.     be on /gd/, /ic/ and /a/   been on /3/ once   never heard of /p/  Holy shit is that even a board?        This. Fucking 20 steps of retardation to put a white outline around text for example, and even then it's aliased as fuck.    HappyScans suck, just saying.    a lot of things horribly  Not that faggot, but font anti-aliasing in Photoshop sucks dicks. Huge ones. Like, elephant-sized or something like that.     whats wrong with MSPAINT?     antialiasing   used for things other than pixel art  Now I'm confused.      virus scanner acts up, TR/Patched.Ren.Gen, i guess it's a false positive?   I have an old copy of PS Elements 9 around, how does it hold up nowadays?   Yeah I just let it install. It may or may not be evil though. I'm not sure as I'm not especially /g/ savvy.  However it appears to have been reupped here: http://cgpeers.com/torrents.php?id=<wbr>37389&amp;torrentid=37315#torrent37315 https://what.cd/torrents.php?id=729<wbr>02220&amp;torrentid=31977736#torrent319<wbr>77736  So if it was malware one would have thought that someone would have found it before uploading it to the private sites.  </wbr></wbr> </wbr>        I-I want to be friends with the people I work with, is there something wrong with that?     But they'll laugh at your shit taste.    Your friends are your weakness, and ultimately they will be your downfall. Leave them, abandon them, and become what you must.     Infinite Stratos sucks dicks but  Laura   shit taste        This is why working as a group is shithouse. Doing it all solo is the only way.     I wish I could do it all solo but I have no japanese skillz. A friend of mine sometimes goes full solo, and he burns out very quickly. He refused to just do translation work and leave the rest to others until recently, probably after deciding that he couldn't do it all alone.    Stop being so clingy.      using Stroke Selection instead of Grow Selection   not assigning keyboard shortcuts so that you can do it in seconds   not writing a Script-fu script to automate it        Why?     Weak, one chapter a week is nothing if you're not a lazy shit. I did 5 in a week last month when catching up on Maou and Himekishi.  Now just waiting for new raws for those two and searching for something else worth TL'ing that hasn't been touched by another group but there's shit all worthwhile.    I automated it by uninstalling GIMP, downloading CS6, and using its 3-click outline functionality rather than continuing to get raped by the GIMP.           Not much of improvement really.   n   Inkscape is vector program.    i paid my Windows,  OEM    You know how there's waifu2x that uses machine learning to upscale images. I wonder if something like that couldbe trained to clean manga pages. Maybe not all of it but it could help make it faster.  Buyfag thread, read this before asking questions http://buyfag.moe    Delicious brown.   Who is that qt   Can't wait for Rin   Sweet baby jesus, I want to stick my tongue in those dimples and lick them clean.    Sega Saturn     buying male figures     http://www.goodsmile.info/en/produc<wbr>t/5086/Nendoroid+Sega+Saturn.html</wbr>    What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch-NYA? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Otonokizaka Academy-NYAAN , and I’ve been involved in numerous secret club meetings on Idol Research clun-NYAA, and I have over 300 confirmed NYAAN. I am trained in backup dancing and I’m the top background singer in µ's-NYAA. You are nothing to me but just another umifag-NYAAN. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth-NYAA, mark my fucking words-NYANN. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker-NYAAN. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of school idols across nippon and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, NYAAN. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, NYAA. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare paws-NYAA. Not only am I extensively trained in background dancing, but I have access to the entire arsenal of sports related items kept at Otonokizaka Academy-NYAAN and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of Japan-NYAA, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you-NYAAA, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue-NYAAN. But you couldn’t-NYAAN, you didn’t-NYAAN, and now you’re paying the price-NYAAN, you goddamn idiot-NYAAAAAN. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, NYAA.    Not trying to be judgmental, but this is worst girl statistically right? I tend to only buy figures if they're popular characters, since I'm fickle and get tired of them and resell. Just wondering if I'll have a hard time reselling her even at a discounted price.  I already preordered kotori.      Who is this    Why isn't this young man wearing any clothes?    me    You have nice ass    A dude   In a girl's boy       Picking this sorry excuse for a nyaandol.   Oh well, HJ is having a blast, Momohime, D'Artagnan (Exclusive, hah!) and Hestia.   When can we pre order?     A dude In a girl's boy  Intirguin     Now    So gender bender? Looks like that one person from that one game    And in that game, she is possessed by a dude.     Rin's nya is at least more than just a shitty gimmick like with Miku, I swear to god I just wanted to punch the fuck out of her every time she talked, most annoying bitch in any anime ever.    Po-chan is too cute &lt;3     I want her but I don't think my mom would be able to appreciate the craftsmanship as much as I would.      That's what's up    There's something else up as well.    She should wear more clothes.     That price   Fucking hell.      1/8 FREEing 20k  No        Underage pls leave.    She actually looks decent with clothes on. She has a good face, but a pig disgusting body.    Oh well, surprisingly cheap. Hestia should be around 12ky at BiJ or so since she is less than10kY at HJ.   Hm, well that looks good rather than seeing her whale body.    I think it looks pretty nice, but you can always hold out for Max Factory.    Exclusive  Why nigga? I can't justify 18k+ yen on a 1/7 scale pvc figure. Not with my currency exchange rate.     If she was from MF or from the WHS line or even a 1/4 FREEing wouldn't mind that price since I would know I'm in for a 11/10 figure. But for a 1/8 from them? No fucking way, 90% of the time they end up with a different/derpy face from the prototype along with paint and QC issues.     Even if you have the money, trying to get a hold of her is a nightmare.     The problem is not the money, my friend, is that just tryong to order her is a fucking nightmare.     Yet somehow she's the Sega mascot girl.  She's my least favourite but well, clearly people like her.      That too. I don't understand the thought process behind starting a new line, funding an anime to advertize it, then making short supply and exclusive. Surely they would make more money at a lower price and wider release.    Oh, it was on HJ's site. Looks like I'll have to learn how to use a proxy.  Anyone have recommendations? I'm looking at 2you4 right now      Wait for the usual sites to have her up.   Got her in the mail earlier today. She's beautiful.  Just got this in the mail, didn't know it was 1/6 size. Pretty big. The lower leg seems to be disconnecting from the torso a tiny bit. Tried to use super glue to get it back where it should be, but so far, it hasn't done anything? How might I fix it?   COD proxy is more expensive than buying it straight from the usual resellers.    You have posted this exact same thing in about 3-4 different threads now. No one cares if you can afford it, no one wants to hear it, no one cares what you buy, and nobody can help you. Shut up already.    Hotglue it together.    Like Ami and BiJ?     1.84 MB, 1520x2688     Amiami doesn't deal with exclusives, Bij does. They are not the only ones though, read the guide.    Which type of hot glue do you mean? I'm not cumming on it.    I'm going to post it again tomorrow just for you anon.     20k  Are they on drugs?     Cool. Have fun never owning it.     She's surprisingly cheaper than I thought.  Nippon Yassan is the only one who doesn't ask you to pay right away with exclusives, right?      I'll get over it when the anime airs and I hate it.    It looks just like the normal one but with an uglier base. Did it at least have a different box design?    1) "Japan only" "COD only" drives up demand for high quality figures. It works because HJ are one of the best. If it's super limited, people buy more in anticipation of reselling high on YJA to foreigners in China.  2) Japan is their primary audience, for example all of amakuni's figures are Japan only. If all global sales stopped, it would only affect their sales to resellers. They don't care about global sales. HJ has the same attitude. 3) The market is maxing out in Japan. Growth is stagnant as inflation increases. What's happening to figures is the same thing that happened to DVDs. So they actually make more money overcharging the hardcore fans and forsaking the casuals.       No fucking way, 90% of the time they end up with a different/derpy face from the prototype along with paint and QC issues.  Which FREEing figure are you referring to?     But anon, if I complain about the price of things and keep mentioning how I can't afford them some wonderful buyfag will buy it for me. r-right?    It's funny seeing everyone bitch about her price when year-round everyone complains about simple bases and lackluster poses.    Yeah no, seems like you are just saying bullshit. Freeing delivers what the proto shows, the issue with them is their high prices and weird sculpt choices not the quality of their final products.  Phat is way worse in the points you mention     There is certain lewdness with TT art and figure.     I don't know who she is, but she looks shit.     I feel like I'm tho only one that likes the variant base. But to my knowledge, it was the same base, but it had foil stickers on it and such because its from wonfes    Certain lewdness...     the foil holos are the same in the regular version. Honestly, there's little point on getting the limited version, is not a recolor nor a better base like the one Kurumi had.    waiting for ami update...   Someone message NY to ask them when HJ figures are going up, so I don't have to play the f5 game all night needlessly in order to beat you faggots to the punch.    2) Japan is their primary audience, for example all of amakuni's figures are Japan only. If all global sales stopped, it would only affect their sales to resellers. They don't care about global sales. HJ has the same attitude.   And yet every time OS has claimed they want to stop international sales they quickly realise how retarded an idea that is.      There's no point on beating anyone on a product that is made to order, retard.    Who is this semen demon    But Amiko already updated. http://www.amiami.com/top/detail/de<wbr>tail?gcode=FIGURE-012203</wbr>    Honestly I hope they just delay her again in July, my order is already too much for my poorfag self to shell out at once.   Fucking christ my witch hat fetish UNF       Looking to sell what little I own. I never open the few I've bought so buying figs just isn't for me.    15,950 JPY  Could be worse       Yeah no, seems like you are just saying bullshit   The Sepang Miku released 2 months ago or their whole Yukata line who always end up 50-60% off 2-4 months after release.       Oh, I didn't realize. I got it off Manda, and it was only 2k more, so I don't really regret it.    Now this is an idol I can get behind.  Also latex Asmo, archer Asmo, band leader Satan and biker Satan when.      Death to tiny hats    YEEEESSSSSS!     that fused calf   preorder anyways   Why do I do this to myself.       Now if we only got the DICKSUCK preorders soon.   More semen demon.   Fuck, I keep seeing this posted around here and thinking a Kohina fig is coming out.      The sepang miku incidents were isolated though, also, binning is not a good way of measuring a figure or a line, Alter's Strike witches have binned for up to 80% before.     This looks very pretty, too bad she's junk tier now and not worth the effort     Yeaah. I think I'll wait for MF Ramlethal. I might get the Freeing one if she bins enough. Mu-12 got pretty cheap.    Top hat fascinators are cool + cute.   Why does mecha always cost so much?!   Two different sets of arms with no seams? So she's going to have 2 different bodies?    Well there's a doll    Wait what? How does this sorcery work?    Look like they're the same from the waist down. So two torsos/heads.    A shit ton of spare parts? SHe is exclusive anyway, so prepare for Amakuni rape.    Another fucking one? Can they give the other girls a chance first?  What's up with the favoritism anyway. Leviathan has terrible sales because they totally shit on her figure with a totally unfun cast off. And now she only has 3 figures. Lucifer, has 6. Asmodeus has 4.      This pose will never be not retarded.    Leviathan is the most popular figure actually, look at the aftermarket prices.    Where are the other Satans?    Read the dialogue at the site, technically Lucifer is the closest character to be the main protag.    It looks better in the original art, but the compromise between the standing pose and the lying pose sort of ruins the lying pose.    Normal, Ice Cream, Bunny, Santa    You say that in complete ignorance.  I'm for 2ch persian rug figure dungeon owner to show you how wrong you are.      Those are Asmodeus, not Satan    I'm waiting for*    Derp. I'm confusing Satan and Asmo of course. Satan Claus is the only other Satan.    She happens to be an expert in poses     Santa is Satan. Bunny and Ice Cream are Asmondeus     if only the figure itself had delicious tanlines.    It's orchid Seed, chances are we will get a tanned version.   Hopefully.       in this figure its a girl in a girls body the male spirit is right beside her     Why no Belphegor?    More like, if only the figure had a visible anus like the art.    To be fair, he leaves her body so she can use the hot springs, so technically unlike her other fig, this one is spiritually a chick.    Because she's shit and literal worst Sin.    I would buy a fig of her in that pose with that skin tone.    Me too, even if they game this figure tanlines I still wouldn't like it that much.  There really should be more mildly lewd tanline figures.     I'd just settle for going back in time and ordering the towel.    they tried but everyone got too lazy    fucking when     art has big round butt   figure has tiny pancake butt      This figure is so complex that I have a hard time believing they won't fuck up some part.  This is like an 18k figure at the least if it's high quality.      It's hardly any more complex than the main sins line.    Once shipping and proxy fees come into play I wouldn't be surprised to see the total price for that fig be north of 25k.    Ya, everyone is waiting on it, but once they see the price I bet most of the people reposting or commenting on it will be turned away.    I don't see it being anywhere that expensive, it's not that far from the complexity Mammon, Beel or even the original asmo had .    I want Elphelt     leviathan not capitalized     It's envious of the other name tags.    i was going to say you're wrong, but i've learned to never underestimate chinese incompetence    Are they standing on fucking Vita cases?    Yes     ENTERTAINMENT FOR PURE BOYS     Wait what? Is that? But, no. I been out of this fucking buying figure shit for more than year. How can this be? How can they have actually made D'artagnan and not make it terrible?  I gave up Alter. I had given up after so long, what in the fuck are you doing to me? I'm having the biggest slowpoke mindfuck of my life.       She just went up for preorders today   Exclusive       Also, she has a tight butt.<br/>   An 18+ daki of toshino kyouko but I've never seen a picture of this one before.  http://order.mandarake.co.jp/order/<wbr>detailPage/item?itemCode=1013563056<wbr>  If no one else wants it, I'll buy it later, just take a picture or something if you grab it before me.  </wbr></wbr>     Fucking SAME. I want a Leo too.    1/4 scale Potemkin, forced EMS shipping.    Buy it fgt    the hell is that in her mouth?     Rucifer   sexsiest      She's eating a small dog.   Hestia just went up on BiJ. I thought she was supposed to come out November/December this year? It says March-April 2016, I really don't want to pay for a fig that I'm not going to see for another year.   CONTACTO     I can only find the hobbyjapan order page. Nothing on the other sites. I'm so on edge. I NEED IT. Everyone called me shit for liking her. For making her my favorite. For wanting this figure. So much is happening for me now, I don't care how much of a fag I sound.       Okay, done.     Hige version.    Me neither. She'll be my first scale    Paypal attached to debit card works   Debit card works in physical stores   Anytime I try to buy something on amiami/cdjapan/whatever, card is denied   I don't get it. Anyone else ever have this problem?       The accumulated bushes from faceless bald men.    wait for tomorrow, BiJ will have her.   Problem?         It's already up in BiJ.       world exclusive oppai   hot for bunny   she's haitenai   Sounds like the lyrics from a Japanese hiphop track.         http://www.goodsmile.info/en/produ<wbr>ct/5086/Nendoroid+Sega+Saturn.html</wbr>    She comes with a little saturn       Why does it say cherry boys and then say ero oyajis. Isn't that contradictory. Or is this for virgin wizards?    Just noticed, also Hestia went better than keikakued.   Front and back, opposite sides anon.       I'll wait for until after Comic Con / Wonfest to order her. Orders close 8/11.  I don't want to pay in full for something that comes out 9 months from now. May as well just pay aftermarket if that's the case.      Officially, but, Bij closes the orders 10 days or a week earlier.    Ya. I'll order it from NY, when it opens, and order my second one from BIJ at the end of July.  I hate paying now for anything that's more than 4 months away.       Prices aren't bad, but I doubt I'll pay that much for something I won't see in a year.    where do you guys buy baseplates for your figurines?   What the fuck are you on about?     baseplates  the what?     Huh?   Go ahead, tear me apart.      so the garage kit i assembled is pretty unstable and can only stand by itself barely as its only supported by a small wedge (see attached pic)  i was wondering if there were like a platform or something i can attach the wedge to for added security?   i was thinking something along the lines of a wax based substance for added "stick"           Nip figs come with bases. If you need some foir some reason this place sells finished wood and acrylic ones are well as other stuff like risers. http://www.collectingwarehouse.com/<wbr></wbr>      forgot pic ;-;     19400  Not this shit again.     Meh, I don't know. Been watching Dragon Ball for the last two and a half decades or so, yet I can't bring myself to get any figure of it, they looks just so out of place with everything I have.    it also doesn't help that I remember seeing some 2$ cheap ass toys of it in the market when I was a kid, so even it were from Alter I would still associate it as something cheap.         wax based substance for added "stick"  If you don't want to glue it use museum/earthquake putty      4000 anime dollars shipping   Fuck me, for one item?      You're fucking up pretty badly     What's the name of the series this figure is from? It looks so familiar, but I can't remember       this is something along the lines i was looking for. thanks anons~   sorry         my friends are getting into that dbz card game, I always make fun of them whenever they have shitty pulls when buying packs    One item, but I blame the bath poster.    I noticed shipping from japan recently has become more expensive in that last 2 weeks. Not just with figures but with clothes too.       This is probably the sexiest figure I've ever seen, but I fucking hate videogames after dealing with /v/.  Back when they became giant faggy nintendo retards, and wanted videogames to get taken over by casuals and flooded with shovelware.         coolio      Still no Dreamcast-chan   Call me when we get best system       Now I may know absolutely nothing about economic processes, but perhaps it's because the exchange rate is otherwise fucked for the japs.  They have to get extra money from importers somehow.      Go back to /v/ and stay with that mentality there. I hate dipshits that subjectively evaluate figures due to reasons like 'original material is bad', 'slut is used goods' or '/v/ shit'.    Heh, glad I moved on to Sony.     5/10 made me respond   Volks forgot to include a base   being good enough to build a GK and not knowing how to make a base         That's 2/3 now hurry the fuck up MF I want my Benisuzume.     She will be released on time  Maki should've been released in May and now she just got pushed back another month into July. Also can't wait to see if they will delay bird.    http://goodsmile-global.ecq.sc/amws<wbr>cawd00001.html/?utm_source=GSCMM001<wbr>&amp;utm_medium=MM2015-06-25&amp;utm_campai<wbr>gn=http://goodsmile-global.ecq.sc/a<wbr>mwscawd00001.html   *Due to licensing constraints, this product will not be available for shipment to Canada, and United States of America. We appreciate your understanding.    Yeah, fuck you too, GSC. A little obnoxious, but I'll just use a middleman service.    </wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>    not building your own  fucking pleb     I can smell your shit taste from here.    Planning to order her through Nippon Yasan. Have they improved their packaging?    the base is the little wedge stand they give. i swaer mang  looked at manual and no base either       But then I have to do things, I just want to throw money at my problems.    You better not be that faggot from /v/ because that would be horribly ironic.    holy fucking shit that is sick    let me guess, colored resin, no painting required?  just build the fucking base from a piece of fucking wood and glue the wedge to it, geez      SAS Gyro Zeppeli.   YOOOO!     Is this Tenshi figure really that rare?     You could just get it from NY     I don't know about rare, but she's definitely beautiful and worth the effort of obtaining. Her first run was exclusive too, so this isn't totally unexpected, though it is a little frustrating since you have a few more hoops to jump through.  That said, I do already own her, but I wouldn't mind owning a second to display without the wings (and the prospect of a newly designed box is kind of enticing).         no dreamcast  This is not hai hai.     Did Japan announce remake of the anime without shitty ending?    Would hot glue.     new anime  All we're getting is that new OVA, though it says "to be continued," but that could just be A-1 and Maeda trolling or a not-so-subtle suggestion to go buy the VNs.   But this is what the VNs will be for. Vicariously live them for what the anime could not, and did not deliver.       now i'm more confused who to get, black heart or this one  pls not both     pretty late, but I plan on getting pic related, thoughts?   She's nice. No real issues besides the slight gap where the skirt can come off, and there's no reason to ever remove it.   I swear I will find a Guts figma that isn't absurdly priced. Wish I was here a couple years ago before they came out   test    failed   If I have an order of about five things, will Ami cancel one of the things in the order?   If you're lucky.    It's been about a month, I wonder if the Patchouli nendo is available for pre-order   Apparently missed the pre-order window by a week   amiami and hobby search aren't listing it   Well shit, I fucked up.       Yes. Every time you order about 5 items from them, they will chose one of the items at random and remove it from your order without your consent. The ultimate russian roulette.    She's an exclusive.    It won't be expensive in the aftermarket, or at least it won't be more expensive than the cost of buying from GSC. They're all bin figures now.    Yeah, I even knew that but completely forgot to check up on her since she was announced.   Hope so. Will have to keep my eyes peeled on mandarake once she's released. Cause damn if it isn't a cute nendo.       Dat ass too flat.    looks good, would love to get the forest one, but probably impossible to find one for sale though.       Good. God.     She's oppai loli, not a midget. The ass is intentionally flat.    I need to see the gravitits.     not a bubble butt.  Pretty lame, I was hoping for better ass shading, even if it was just for the prototype.    Just a reminder. Kahotan station is this morning in a few hours.   you have my attention   How many of you made the mistake of not preordering when you had the chance.    Preordering PHAT ever     Fuck off retard.    Why would you say such a thing?    How many of you made the mistake of not preordering when you had the chance.     oppai loli  Two perfectly good words that when put together become vomit-inducing.     Hoping the special one with the pimp stand bins for some reason.  Will probably settle for the regular in the aftermarket.     WON FES SOON  Vertex just tweeted an abomination   yay more boats    Don't lose hope. Your favorite series with no figures might just get one!       Cute    Is this the character with the most figures that are almost naked?    porkchop doesn't have nearly as many as sonico   Are there any daki cover materials that don't eventually get scratched up by facial hair?   shave    Just fucking shave, caveman.    Peach Skin    uh, I expected the paint job to be a lot better.     Uncultured swines.     How much would you bet that she gets delayed again?    Don't tell me you're some kind of asian terrorist muslim, noodles?     too cute    1 hour 20 minutes 'til Ryougi goes up for preorders.  Amazon JP figures are now at the start of their bin cycle again.     No, I am an asian hipster.    How are Stronger figures? Can I expect it to look as good as the proto?    That's even worse. I bet you wear colorful cord jeans too.   Stronger is former GSC staff, so it's more or less around the same level.       http://myfigurecollection.net/searc<wbr>h.php?manufacturer_strict=1&amp;manufac<wbr>turer_id=62079  A few of them look off, (Homu and Sento).  They did the new K-On sculpts which look great so far.    </wbr></wbr>    We hipster wear sarong. Get your fact right.     wearing shit that looks like a skirt  Why not go all out and make your inner trap happy with a real one?    My Phat Sachiko just got sent out after sitting at Amazon warehouse for two months waiting for another item in the order.  I am looking forward to a box that looks like crumbled tissue paper.    Anyone preorder fire emblem ciphers?  <br/>    Will they charge me right away like bij?    I want to combine shipping on Big in Japan, is there some sort of time limit? Shit I want to combine is coming out today supposedly.   How much for Thraja ?   guys what if i die soon and not be able to pay for my preorders, am i going to get banned?  Can someone post the delays for this month? TIA    They'll go after your estate / family for the money.     belt fastened through loosest notch  Nice one, Vertex.   Yeah I'm not very impressed. The paint looks kind of cheap and shitty, and I can't work out why.         TIA  go pleasure yourself anally with a red-hot iron    Ryougi is up. 13k yen.. Lol   like the yakuza?    Holy shit my dick.    i'll do it together with all of my pochaco figs    She looks good and I really want her, but   Art Spirits   Broccoli   The final product won't look nearly as good as that, am I right?         Think she'll go up on the Aniplexusa site?  ... I need her in my life.      GSC take my money for Re-Class.   Soon.    Kahotan is up.  They're talking about that gay code shit.     Needs DVR and FF.    i don't even know why i bother watching these, they never show anything good    I think they're going to show that Cordelia from Fire Emblem this time.   BiJ or N-Y?   Yes    They are, but that doesn't mean that anon thinks it's anything worthwhile. It's better to watch these streams when you know there's something you want showing.     Who is this mattress actress?     What?     Both charge right away, so I dunno.     All these preorders that opened today  Damn Hobby Japan is good at this. Got Shiki from Aniplex and Hestia from them.     I don't think that's true, ayynon    Quite possibly the stupidest thing I ever wanted to buy. Sold out though.    8,200 JPY   I was expecting her to be more for some reason.      What the fuck do you even do with one of these? Even the obvious answer of "hang it from a glass" doesn't really make any sense at all.    code   obscure game   robots  About to go back to sleep       Maki pushed back   Thank God.

If you have questions about your order/item, please email the store you placed the order with.

I guess someone with a mug collection could use them. I just want them because they're adorable as fuck.    And now they are advertising eye liner. Feels like I'm in the wrong hobby.    Muramasa   Okay I'm done with this broadcast. I can't sit through another 45 minutes of boring shit just to see 1 min of cordelia. Someone take mass screenshots please.  Otaku no Video KS ends today if you were planning on getting it.   Yes this posted 9 hour ago but I really want to know, what is the difference between Miku and Rin's nyaa? But to me they are mre or less the same nyaa. Please nyaa experts explains.    Don't worry they'll be up on MFC a minute after airing. Just check newest pictures every once in a while, or simply track her page.      Check MFC   Nothing of interest  Wow, it's fucking nothing.       Wasnt she delayed a few days, to like July 7th?    Probably late July   Exclusive lewd..again.   Shave    Just another hair color with a poster? I don't get it.   ALL OF MY MONEY  I really hate it when June release means June 30th release.     She's not getting released in June    Probably shouldn't have left the order no. No idea if that matters.    Currently on phone so I dont have the rest of the pics.  Nendo Training Honoka, raiden and iron man shown      I dont know about June 30.    Don't say that. Was something actually stated?    http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>166937</wbr>    Her pictures are up.   There's an item in Mandrake which I wish to purchase. It's like half price of what it would usually cost and the condition says that it is "Unopened, with some box damage." Is this really legit? as it seems somewhat too good to be true. There's also another similar figure that is the full price of what it should be.     Amazon has it as June 30th. It could be that ami is just saying July because that's when it'll actually be going out.    I do hope than ami send it out in july. My wallet would much rather that. Takes my 30k month from june to july but tax returns.    Where does mfc even pull their information from? Is it user updated or do admins publish shit?    Mandarake is usually pretty spot on when it comes to pricing things for the Japanese market. I don't know where you're getting your idea of what it would usually cost, but if your concern is that mandarake is going to give you a fake item or a smashed piece of shit, then don't worry. Their standards are as high as most Japanese places.    User and once they've confirmed it, it's way too much fucking effort for anyone else but the original person to get it changed.    Ok, then I'm sticking with my June 30th theory until proven wrong.   When it comes to undervaluing items, do I have to give the shop the set amount I want them to value it too?     Yes.    Depends on the site, but yeah, usually you give them a number or else they'll just knock it down 80% or some random amount. I've had a lot of places do it without asking (don't need it in the US lel)    Finally   Ohh, Iona!   Classy girl.    You must be new to this.      Mandarake always lies about their box condition.  They say that it's damaged when it's not.     Can anyone give me a picture of what the box looks like from the back please? May have to deal with customs in the future.  Btw Noodles, do you by any chance know what's the max amount an item can cost before it is taxed in Malaysia? Also how do you avoid customs, I noticed you now own bath loli?     Shit, that's cute. Not something I would've expected to get a Nendo though, is it more popular than I think it is?      Isn't noodles in Singaporn?    Below RM500. Above that, likely to get taxed and ask you to open the box to see what is it.    thought he was malay.    Thanks     He has an account on mfc     Damn I love her character design, too bad her route was boring.   Quick question everyone, if I want to ask Mandrake to undervalue an item I ask them in their comment column when I confirm my purchase am I right?  So how do you get out of this hobby? I've been stuck in a limbo for a good 8 years now.  It's one hell of an slippery slope and I wouldn't mind having money for other things.      Sell your collection.    Sell what you have    hair, eye, tile, bowl colors and skin tan are different. plus a poster.    How common is the ability of figmas to sit wariza?   Hey, I asked about buying shimapan a month or so ago. I come bearing results.  I decided to buy them from ebay, link related DL option. http://www.ebay.com/itm/15140967913<wbr>0?_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649&amp;var=<wbr>450598530477&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBI<wbr>DX%3AIT  Even though they're from ebay they came in a Taobao branded zip lock baggie which was a surprise.  They're great, the color is a lighter blue and not that standard darker 'Mio' shade but still nice. The fit is excellent it's tight elastic around the waist and thighs that dig in just a little bit which looks amazing. Comes with a tiny bow on the front of the waist but easy enough to remove. Only complaint is that the material is just a bit too thin so in the light you can see her crack. It said "Not suitable for the transvestite" which made me laugh so much I tried it, they're right, definitely "Not suitable for the transvestite" if you're into that    </wbr></wbr></wbr>      Stop going on buyfag threads and sell your collection. The more you stay with other buyfags, the more you'll buy     I'll never sell my collection but I've been thinking about ditching every payment from now on and getting blacklisted from the stores.   And if I ever wanna get back I can just use another address and name        I thought you emailed them after you made the purchase    You should know that you'll never be able to ditch every payment as there'll forever be that little voice in your head telling you to buy more     tiny bow   easy enough to remove      So you don't really want to leave. If you did you'd sell everything, or almost everything. When you have something on your shelf you keep wanting more. If you can't handle your money get banned and once you do, quit.      If they're "Not suitable for the transvestite" what were you buying them for?      gf   I don't have anything to prove and it means nothing to just say you have one on the internet. I just came to share my results because a few other people were interested in buying them too. Although I don't know how many of them would want them to be suitable for the transvestite or not.       Post pics of her wearing it.  Unless she's fat, then don't.     It says "one size" but what size would you say it is?    Don't really want to be annoying but I'm going to ask this question again. How do you ask Mandrake to undervalue your purchases?     Fuck off <br/>     one size    I wonder if that one size includes Pochaco size       If you notice, there is no knee joints.     implying anyone cares for fatties, especially when they're 3D  They'd probably rip.     Yes.  But they have done it automatically every time for me.      I don't know anything about underwear sizes but I have a thin waist and they stayed on me just fine, they filled out on her a lot more being a girl but still pretty thin if that's what you're asking. I just tested how far they stretch and it was quite far, looks like they'd start to get uncomfortable at 100Kg+ I guess?   Shingeki no kyojin thread.  The second recap movie will include a new scene at the end to make the link with season 2. https://twitter.com/anime_shingeki/<wbr>status/613880929078022144  A new trailer has been posted and includes the opening ("price of freedom") composed by Revo. Looks like they animated the flashback from chapter 44 where Annie's kicks Eren's ass and defies Mikasa. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=eMF<wbr>9WkDiuCM&amp;feature=youtu.be</wbr>  [ ] [Embed]   </wbr>       Looks like they animated the flashback from chapter 44 where Annie's kicks Eren's ass and defies Mikasa.  That's a weird idea. The flashback was perfect where it was. Now there will be even less Annie in season 2. Still hoping to see this scene animated.      The second recap movie will include a new scene at the end to make the link with season 2.  Trying to patch up their plot holes with tiny bandages?     I'll gladly take more Annie    It looks like the flashback during Eren Titan vs Armored Titan fight.    They will probably retcon the wall revelation to make it closer to the manga. Hopefully the movie ends with the hord of titans leaving Ragako, and a little sign of Monkey Trouble's presence.   On an unrelated note, Hazuki Kanae will be drawing an LM pinup in shoujo style for Dessert magazine.  http://natalie.mu/comic/news/151703<wbr> https://twitter.com/kanaehazuki </wbr>       I can't wait till that bitch annie gets whats coming to her.    That's interesting.  What's up with these stuff lately?     What stuff?    Meant to     First the two covers, then the SM thing, not this shoujo pinup     Too successful for it's own good. I'm already SnKed out.    *Now.  captcha dick biscuit      Which covers are you talking about? The bessatsu one? Aria? Frau? Newtype? Animage? Brutus?    There's all these? I'm talking about the eye sex one and the one from the recent chapter?     the eye sex one  u wot m8      the eye sex one   Which is that?      This one.     Isn't that because their Ackerman stronk connection?    It's a joke.    Oh, I see.  I never know when LMfags are joking.  Can't wait to see what the pinup thing looks like.    I guess now that the spotlight is on the Ackermen, do you guys think there will be further onscreen discussion between LM on the topic?   Hopefully not. It should be more of a background side thing if anything.    Speak for yourself, I want to see it.    When they finally have the talk, you can be sure anons will talk a lot about it.    Yeah, it will be mainly retarded shitposting.    Few people here shitposts,  just the ones who are constantly butthurt about something     I know, but I am invested in their relationship and maybe learning more about Mikasa. Who would've thought in 2015 the most annoying shippers on /a/ would be LevixMikasa?    They're bound to discuss it, but is the spotlight really gonna be on them? I was hoping for some BRMT shenanigans but it might give away too much.     They're bound to discuss it, but is the spotlight really gonna be on them?  I'm just talking about the current controversy about the SM kiss in the live action film. Obviously the spotlight is on MT, as far as the plot is concerned.       I'm surprised it still didn't started.    And what is that link, the flashback with Annie fighting Mikasa? It doesn't make much sense and it should be much later in the series.    Finally. But why does it look like a later scene? They can't remove it from the anime, can they?     They will not erase the last scene, it will be more like a link between seasons.     Who would've thought in 2015 the most annoying shippers on /a/ would be LevixMikasa  Compared to some other shipperfags, they're really not the most annoying. LMfags are generally quiet unless something relating to the characters together comes up.  Also who uses nameXname anymore? Just say LM      That will be an improvement but it won't ease the butthurt caused by the many other things they've changed for the worse.    So damn sick of Levi and Mikasa, the most overrated characters. Wish we could get other characters in the focus for a change.    No, they are very annoying as are manletfags and Tumblrfags in general and a big part of why these threads are much worse now.    They used to be extremely obnoxious, even if nothing happened. Now they're a little bit more quiet. Anyway they're still obnoxious.    I blame the political arc.    I blame shit taste, politics arc, and continuing to make these threads when it is unneeded.     I find EMfags to be ten times more obnoxious. One even tried to make an EM thread yesterday, and they do shit like that very often. For some reason anons hardly complain about them.      For real, it's been a long time that I've seen an LMfag complaining about anything.     Mikasa is overrated but she isn't really the focus.    I think you're all annoying. EM, LM and especially Mikasa are all equally shit.    I think EHfags are by far the most obnoxious shipperfags. LMfags are pretty tame.    No, see the YHfag who has been shitting the threads for 1 year now.No one can surpass him.    EH isn't even an actual thing and no one is really an EHfag. They're just LMfags doing it to annoy the other retarded shipperfags so in the end it goes back to the Ackershit autists.    This. Although some of them are the same people.    That goes without saying, this one was by far the worst shitposter ever on /snk/.    YHfags and BRYHfags in general are so much more quieter because of the hate.    Don't tell me you're retarded enough to actually believe that.    There isn't any hate, just a vocal retard. See    Which one? YHfags have been pretty quiet.    Don't tell me you're retarded enough to believe "HELMfags" aren't just LMfags looking for more excuses to pretend that many people here care about Levi or Mikasa.    You're the one pretending that x are shitposters because you're mad at something.    Good one. Unless you've been here for a week.    Well even YHfags hated that retard.    If you think most shipperfags here aren't just shitposters then you're in denial now fuck off back to Tumblr    This.    What the hell does LM have to do with EH? How would being an EHfag be an "excuse"? How would shitposting about EH make people care about LM? If LMfags wanted to shitpost they'd do it with a ship they like. You're more delusional than EH and LM fags combined.    Not him but I rarely see YHfags here now. In fact Ymirfags and Historiafags have this weird hate for each other and hardly get along. Individually they're probably the worst characterfags here but at least they usually only attack each other.    It's to "make room" for their own delusional ship. A lot of delusional shipperfags do that    It's kind of true. I see no one claiming that it's going to happen for example.    HELMfags, retard.     they usually only attack each other   only  Sure.      Looks like you weren't here last spoiler week or is just on damage control.     or is just on damage control  Probably, Ymifags tend to cause shit all over the place in every possible place and then pretend it never happened.     You're kidding, right?    There are generally more people here for spoiler week and the most butthurt came from EMfags.    You're only talking about one or two vocal shitposters.     LMfags trying to divert the attention to Ymirfags     That's just what you think because of one or two retards.    I really think that's the other way around.    Pay more attention will you? Even /u/ is pretty tame about the situation. Most have accepted that YH has possibly sunk.    Yeah, I noticed it too.     Most have accepted that YH has possibly sunk.  Not really, they just don't care about what happened in ch70 and don't overreact.     I hate Ymir and her fags but I'll agree with you here. HELMfags are the biggest shitposters and should stop pointing finger to other fags when they are the ones derailing threads all the time.     If they added any Annie scenes it should have been the one of Annie offering to teach Eren.  The Annie/Mikasa fight should be in season 2.     I've been reading through /u/ and that's not what I saw. At least, except for one drama queen anon, they aren't whining.     WHERE IS THE TENSION?   they chose to animate a scene that happens later instead of animating the one they left out before    why.jpg        I doubt it.    As happy as I am about more Annie, this makes no sense. Are they planning to make Levi Eren's mental anchor during the AT fight?  Everything will be atoned for if it turns out her smile was included as well, though   ;_;     This confirms that S2 will have no Annie in it at all.    I miss the days when HELM was Hanji, Erwin, Levi and Mike. Best HELM.        This confirms that S2 will have no Annie in it at all.  Fuck this gay earth.     She's still in the flashbacks for B&gt;A in the 47 and 49 scenes. Those will probably be still frames so its not going to be a lot really, but she's technically in the season   The only thing I can think of is they're including the scene to tease at an Eren/Annie romantic relationship and are trying to build up a bit of a love triangle thing with Mikasa so the eventual reveal, Eren's reluctance to fight and Mikasa fighting the Female Titan has more tension behind it because there's romantic reasons as well as just Annie being an enemy Titan.   So this will be shown before or right after the scene where Mikasa asks Eren if he has feelings for Annie.    I hate Ymir and Ymirfags usually too but they're very quiet now compared to shipperfags    To be honest I think they are doing it in order to prevent people from choosing EA by lessening the impact before that part happens. When it will happen in S2 people will be like 'meh, I've seen this" and the hype will go down. Was Araki in charge of this again?     I don't care about either HELM, just wish there was less shitposting about pairings here.    I think it's to imply even further that Annie likes Eren, to increase drama for their fightning. Some people could have missed it the first time, so the fightning didn't have the same impact to them.    Hardly anyone even cares about EA. it didn't really catch on, people went for AA instead.    Only EMfags went for AA. EM and AA have a lot of fanart, while EA doesn't, its no coincidence.    Blame the anime for that.   Who LH here?   They would've chosen the scenes they left out if that was the case.   EA had very few going on in the anime. A single episode is enough for some people who have lost interest in this to like something.  Araki is going on his way to crush everything.         Didn't the anime also add a scene with Armin shouting something at Annie after she transformed?    If it weren't for /a/ I wouldn't have noticed anything romantic between EA. I still don't think there's anything romantic going on.    Is it confirmed there'll be only this new scene? But this scene serves the same purpose as that one and also links to season 2, so this is better to animate.    What makes you think EA would have caught on with a bit more focus? Eren het doesn't catch on much, aside from EM and that's the main pairing and not even his most popular pairing.    Yeah, he taunted her to try and kill him if I'm remembering correctly.    The oficial high school spinoff has Annie lusting for Eren's dick, so yeah she likes him.    The same spinoff that has Frieda lusting after Historia.    That, moe scenes with Mikasa, replaced Armin with Mikasa, etc. I was googling to find this pic of Mikasa and this came up. Lel.     The flashback scene also ties into Eren's fight with Reiner though. It sets up how Eren's able to beat him.    If animefags could have seen pic related EA would be way more popular. You can't see that smile and deny the two of them would be cute as fuck together.       And I forgot the pic    But this one is a better tease. Ans they ve throwing "who would you chose?" when it actually matters.    But it is true.    I still don't think it would have become popular. For some reason AA is what became popular.    Is that why she likes Eren now? Because he has Frieda inside him?    Japanese EMfags made AA popular, anon. They want Annie out of the way.    Other day I read that Grisha and Carla didn't adopted Mikasa, they just take care of her and they happened to live in the same house. Eren and Mikasa aren't siblings in any way or form at all.    He's also brave, charming and said he likes her.     I noticed that every time someone hates on Ymir or Ymirfags, someone always fingerpoints and someone replies this exact thing to him. Why are you so retarded and why are you so quick to jump on shitty metafaggotry?     Anniefags like it too though.    will it be a 2 minute clip of historia looking wistfully at eren?    This is true though. They aren't siblings.    Anniefags don't like AA. It's either EA or BA, EA mostly.    The fuck are you talking about fag?    They're adoptive siblings.    No. It's complete trash. Arminfags are the ones who push that shit, not Anniefags.    Anniefags all over Japan and in other places like AA. /a/ is the only place I've seen where they're so against it.     Eren   charming      Historia doesn't even interact with Eren at all during that point in time.    Exactly what I wrote. Ymirfags fingerpoint all the fucking time because they're butthurt no one else likes her. I bet they never get their fingerpointing right but they always circlejerk about how right they are.    Yes but not blood related. Grisha didn't adopt Mikasa either so you could even argue that they're not even adoptive siblings.    Arminfags tend to like JAr or EAr. It's Anniefags who like AA.    Isn't Ymir the most popular character here though, she's always the first place in polls and all anyone talks about at /u/ and the other place   I hope this finishes up soon. If I finish this, finish watching this season of Nisekoi (then read the manga for some closure) all my backlog and current shows will be done.   Eren is charming, handsome, brave and kind. Not at all like that brute Reiner.     Grisha didn't adopt Mikasa either  Grisha brought her to his house and treated her like his own daughter. That, my dear anon, is adoption.     She's not but she's not as hated as people make it out to seem.    Most Anniefags like Annie as a character  and some for themselves.     Jean pls. Stop trying to pretend EH happening will make Mikasa like you.    He took an abandoned orphan and gave her a place to live at. That's not the definition of adoption. And even so, they only lived together for 1 year. How does that make it wrong?    I would think that Anniefags would like Annie.    Jewnie gonna get REKT    EH is endgame faggot. By now is clear the Historia is perfect for Eren and they marry and become king and queen.    Araki pushed both EM and AA while undermining Eren and Annie's relationship. EA would definitely be more popular if the anime were loyal to the manga in that regard.     He took an abandoned orphan and gave her a place to live at. That's not the definition of adoption.  Really? So what's the definition of adoption to you? Because from everything I've leran that's adoption in it's root.   To take on the responsibilities as parent of (a child that is not one's biological child).        mikasa is a fucking autistic slut in any case    *Learn.    He also replaced Armin with Mikasa in several scenes.    Funny how you only take the first sentence and ignore the rest of it.   Adoption usually refers to the legal process of becoming a non-biological parent   the legal process  Mikasa was never legally adopted. She isn't signed as Grisha and Carla's adopted daughter on official papers. They simply took her in and that's it.       She's just a girl who doesn't know better. She would be happy if she made out with someone handsome like Jean.     legally adopted   On the Walled cities   Implying they even know what a layer is   Implying  This is'nt modern society.        Wow seriously? People talk about Ymir on /u/? That's shocking!    And Levi.     pin up  That's nice     Except that Historia is asexual or a lesbian.    The concept of marriage exists so it's not far fetched to think that the act of officially adopting children applies there too.    &gt;Implying they even know what a layer is  They have doctors and they have judges. Why again wouldn't there be lawyers?       I wasn't saying it like a bad thing, no need to be an autist Ymirfag    They took Mikasa into their care and no one said nothing about it. So if there is really lawyers and legal adoption, they did it.     Ymir is so popular she's all they talk about on /u/!     The concept of marriage exists since way before the medieval era.    Again being butthurt for nothing, what's so bad about saying she's popular there?    Well and Historia, which makes sense. I remember someone complaining that no one discusses other characters beside these two.    I don't get that. Why don't they just bring up what they want to talk about then? People just default to YH for obvious reasons. Well right now all they argue over is Dumblr art anyway.    Not him, but you made it sound like it's weird that they do that.    It's canon that Hanji is fucking disgusting and never washes. There is no way manlet would go near her vagina/penis or whatever smelly shit she has between her legs. Like seriously, I can see him romantically with a variety of characters from Petra to Erwin, but with Hanji I can only see them as friends, because of that.    Not really, you're just being paranoid    This is true though. Mikasa lived with them for one year and they didn't adopt her as she kept her name. You can dislike EM for tons of reasons, main one being Eren himself, but the 'incest' argument is fucking retarded.   Those new character bios for Historia and Eren were pure shipper bait.   Even while being smelly the tranny is too good for the manlet anyway.    What new character bios?    So is it true that this movie confirmed Jean and Mikasa? I think it is.    I think Mikasa is more of the problem with EM than Eren is. It's not Eren's fault he actually cares about other people aside from MA and it would be annoying to have someone the same age as you try to mother you.    probably some hetfag delusions, ignore it    The one that has Eren 'admiring Historia'    I never saw that one. When was that posted?    Nice try retconning canon EM, Isayama.    I'm not caught up but does Eren even know Historia?   I find it hard to believe that Eren could be nice to a girl or even compliment her after all we've seen him do to Mikasa.      you were implying that that makes her popular. it's not weird that people on /u/ discuss the main yuri ship    They give her food, they give her clothes, they give her a new home, they treated her like she was their own daughter, but no, they totally did not adopt her. They would need some papers for that.    And? He also admires Levi. Then again that's one of the reasons fujos ship EL.    Reiner is the Armored Titan Berthold is the Big Guy For You Titan Ymir is a Trans-African Titan Historia is royalty and her dad is the King and also a Titan       I'm not caught up either but I know they had a bit of a bonding moment where Eren said he prefered her as Historia over Krista. Still, having him admire her seems like a stretch. Far as I know she hasn't really done anything worth admiring, especially from someone like Eren.     I find it hard to believe that Eren could be nice to a girl or even compliment her after all we've seen him do to Mikasa.  He only treats Mikasa like that because he views her as his sister / family. He is very nice and calm around Historia. When he looks at Historia, he is even able to ignore Jean's agitating troll remarks.  Makes you think.....       Jean also mentioned that the two of them often "hold hands" while they're alone together.    Mostly because anyone talking about anything other than YH either gets ignored or shunned out  People are tired if that. YH is old and boring.      He didn't say often.    So you want people to talk about MA?    Anything is more interesting than YH.     The story progresses if you keep reading.     Read     I agree but if you say that on /u/ the same butthurt Ymirfags from here jump on you and start whining and fingerpointing as usual.    If people don't respond to you it's because they don't have anything to say that's of worth or because they don't like the same pairing you do. It doesn't necessarily mean that you're not allowed to talk about it. Especially the post you linked to is an indication of that, there are no Mikasa/Sasha gifs as far as I know.     I find it hard to believe that Eren could be nice to a girl or even compliment her after all we've seen him do to Mikasa  That's exactly because it was Mikasa.     Why would people talk about it though? You think it has a possibility of happening?    Holy shit, stop overreacting you retard. Calling someone popular isn't an insult. Not everyone is out to hate on Ymir    of course, YH is canon just like EM, whether Isayama likes it or not    It's more interesting.    I was talking about MA. Then again you don't even know what a bee is.    Then bring it up what you want to talk about, retard. If people are interested they will reply. You can change topics without causing butthurt or acting butthurt yourself since for the most part everyone there is chill.   What's MA? Mikasa/Armin or Mikasa/Annie?   I guess that's why you never talk about it and expect other people to start a discussion.    Eren and Historia even take naps together. Which should say they're probably more like siblings if they're comfortable enough to do that.    I bring it up but no one replies, all they talk about is yummy currrryyyy.    Why not? That scene in the trailer was nice.    Hot. Ymir and Historia bore me to death. This I can fap to all day every day.     I bring it up but no one replies  For example?     Then no one cares about it. You can't force people to care. I personally don't because I don't like yuri for the sake of yuri and that's exactly what MA is but I don't care if others want to post it.    So wht, Ymir and Historia take naps together all the time except Ymir's BBC is inside her cunt while they napping.     for the most part everyone there is chill  Joke of the month. They get butthurt all the time, even more than the Ymir thread on the other place. Ymirfags get butthurt over everything everywhere.  It was great and I hope people would talk about it more. I'm afraid that means less Annie or MA in season 2, unless they reuse the scene there. If not, it means worse pacing or more filler.       It's in previous threads    It's completely out of character, but the author has had Eren not only call Historia amazing but hold her hand as well. Historia is also always around Eren and blushing.    The tension between the two is nice to watch.    Mikasa/Armin is mostly abbreviated as AM.    So they sleepfuck?    YH is plain and boring. /u/ is for everything    What's the context of this?    All that hate fucking must be wonderful, my dick is diamonds    No one is stopping you from talking about other yuri pairings.    Then stop talking about YH. I go there and it never fails. It's either a war between Ymir and Historiafags or a boring fanart dump. Where's the delicious MA?     being this butthurt    I really hope we get a season 3 so we can get more Annie, since she'll barely be in season 2.   I'm sort of hoping they add a filler scene or two in season 2 of crystalised Annie. Maybe showing the Survey Corp attempting to get her out, or having Eren go visit her.     The funniest thing is when they claim there's no shitflinging there or at the other place, and if you look there's shitflinging only from Ymirfags in every one of these places.    What the hell. If you want to talk about something else then just bring it up, it's as simple as that. Logically not many people will be interested but there could be one or two anons out there that might have the same interest as you. No one's going to stop discussing the most relevant yuri ship just because you don't like it.    I really hope you're just pretending to be retarded.    I don't care for Ymir and the idiocy surrounding her usually but please stop fingerpointing at them over everything. It's just as annoying as they can be.    YHfags always fight among one another for no reason at all. chapter 70's release was simply hilarious    Well, I can see why that anon is bored, since the YH ship only have the muh lgbt pairing thing for them, it's not even interesting or fapable, and most of the art posted there is of tumblr with a terrible art style and a wrong representation of Ymir.    Blushing means NOTHING, NOTHING. EM/YH is canon canon canon canon!!    That was just one drama queen.    It was not YHfags fighting. It was retarded EHfags shitposting left and right while whining about YHfags.    This. Her face only got red because of the heat. She looked down because of the sun.     manga   lgbt  You wot       Blushing means NOTHING  Yeah, it doesn't mean anything when you get complimented.     That was just one anon and people told him to fuck off with the cancerous art.    Keep telling yourself that, most Ymirfags are just like that.     Sasha loves and wants to marry YH     It was YHfags whining about how the spoilers were wrong and Isayama was a sellout, and we making fun of their butthurt.    People keep claiming YHfags were butthurt when most were pretty calm meanwhile it was EMfags getting pissed.    Not really.     Mikasa: Annie... likes me. Doesn't she?   Annie: Father... my chastity is in danger        whining   whining about whining   more whining  That's pretty much every thread with at least one Ymirfag in it.        She's gonna be in a crystal for all of season 2     Look I'm talking out of my arse     Sounds more like a typical snk characterfag.    Stop.      and we making fun of their butthurt  You mean autistic shitposting? I can't blame anyone for not wanting to deal with shitposters.       that filename  Kek.    This is the right otpee tbh.   Still salty?    She's not!    Is that Annie in the dress or another Armin?     b-but Ymirfags are the ones that are butthurt! I swear I'm not a shitposter even if the mods keep banning me!  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;&gt;/u/1795021      People can blush when they're being modest you know. And Historia blushes at everything because it's easy to embarrass her.    It's been months since the last time I was banned, don't know what you're talking about.       Not him, but he's right. The EH shitposters were annoying for everyone, not only shipperfags.       EHfags don't exist, they just do it to annoy everyone.    And imagine, it's still better than YH.    I doubt it. They actually are very delusional. See     The fact that there's more than one EHfag shitposting on /u/ makes it even worse, and you say we're the ones at fault. most of /y/ has been pretty chill since the chapter release.     I don't know what bait is     No one knows.   This is how I see it.         Exactly. Ymirbro is so smart he knows exactly what blushing means (if it's heterosexual).  Here's a new rule of SNK generals:   If you support HEtshit, then LEAVE or else...!   SNK generals are supposed to be an inclusive safe space for us all to discuss our canon ships (YH, BR, EM). If you like het, leave.            That's pretty much it, yes. But blushing must always mean attraction now apparently.    Being here does that to you. You can't tell delusions and joking apart.     I don't have nothing to do with that post, so I don't know what this have to do with me. And that anon clearly forgot on wich board he was.    don't you find it funny every chapter now there's more and more damage control by the EM&amp;YHfags? Five chapters ago we were crackship shitposters and now we are delusional shitposters. And every new chapter there's one more confimartion of EH.    Yes, blushing is only romantic if Mikasa does it for Eren.     Five chapters ago we were crackship shitposters and now we are delusional shitposters  You were both since in the beginning and you still are.    Since you guys are a little confused about it this  is shitposting at it's best.   Not only that, Historia is in love with DT.    Excuse me, but we all know that YH supporters are 110% girls (because we girls are the primary targets of yuri; just like we're the primary victims of wars!) and as such we cannot be shitposters.   Why is it always shipping?   Armin likes Jean too and Historia likes Reiner.    It's not shipping, we are just defending ourselves from the hetfag shitposters' shipping by reaffirming that our ships (EM, YH, BR) are canon.  If you don't like those, then  GET THE FUCK OUT.       Armin and Jean roleplay as Historia and Eren when they're alone together.     Historia likes Reiner.  No shit.  If she didn't like Ryner then she wouldn't have given him her virginity (reminder that he ripped her hyman during the training years).       Now this is actual shitposting.  Both Jean and Armin were explicitly confirmed to be straight in the manga.      This is also true.    this thread   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127157515   Deleting this.   Okay now I am triggered and all of my rape survivor memories are coming back.  "Based" mods.        good, she's fist level miniboss    get rekt   reminder that EM/YH shippers are all female and survivors and if you disagree with us you are basically raping us  Mods = gods  Something bugged me at the beginnning of the trailer with the fat titan, so I compared it with the blu-ray of the tv version. They changed the lightning.   http://screenshotcomparison.com/com<wbr>parison/132458 http://screenshotcomparison.com/com<wbr>parison/132459 http://screenshotcomparison.com/com<wbr>parison/132460 http://screenshotcomparison.com/com<wbr>parison/132462 http://screenshotcomparison.com/com<wbr>parison/132463 http://screenshotcomparison.com/com<wbr>parison/132466</wbr> </wbr> </wbr> </wbr> </wbr> </wbr>       How are they gods?  They didn't even ban me yet lmao.  Also they're only gods if you're an SJW transcuckold mangina (which you probably are, since you love Ymir so much).  Mods would be gods if they deleted this whole shitty GENERAL thread from /a/.         I just realised that since there is no mystery to titan origins left, it will just be faction political bullshit from now on.   Which chapter was this?    Why the fuck they don't ban you?    Maybe it's just the video quality? Why would they change the lighting?    It'll be Titan fighting from now on. They'll recapture Shiganshina, then they'll go on the offensive and make a push for BRA's hometown.   Just caught up to the manga  Wish I was here for the sudden Monkey Trouble entrance, fuck     I doubt we'll see the hometown out of flashbacks.    No it's not the quality of the video. They probably though it was better. The blu-ray had a shitload of changes, including different lightning.    I want him to sit on my face    The man behind the monkey is pretty hot, c'mon    Why exactly would they go to BRAs place? Outside if them kidnapping Eren? If MT is the big boss and BR his best backup it's basically over. The wall titans would be next.    Who would of thought? I wanted a hot chick coming out of him but this is twice as good. Either way it's a win    Their hometown is the enemy. After 100 years living in fear, humanity will finally be able to strike back.    I like MT as is but him as a hot chick would still be better.    We don't even know if they have shifters outside of BR or if they're hometown isn't fucked over. As it stands they seem to have nothing after BRMT while the wall titans are still an issue.    No one posted pics of him before the whole chinese scans came out so it wasn't actually all that hyped since no one believed it/nips don't care about MT. Plus the threads were still riddled with the same shitposting.      They'll recapture Shiganshina   Armor, Colossal, and MT who have months to prep vs unprepared Eren and SL  Sure they will.       not being bi and having best of both worlds   I'm happy with the outcome       wall titans  Shit, I almost forgot about them. They could still wake up any moment.     Honestly considering their previous missions, I wouldn't be surprised if SL is also somehow prepared for BRMT with Armin's superior intellect and all.    Don't they need sunlight to wake up?     implying all that shit  A refined lady scientist type would be a better and more shocking contrast coming out of MT's titan form.     Yeah but it wouldn't have, c'mon now son face the truth    A coordinate controlling them might also work.   Would she be topless and have a 6 pack too?       Yes they will. They beat 30+ guys with anti human 3DMG with LM and some kids.    He doesn't really look that good. Just a guy with a beard and pants.    It would have but still I was shocked at that outcome. My body went diamonds    Whatever man, I'd let this sexy Jesus do anything he wants to me    The thing on his arm still doesn't look like anything but titan gunk to me.   Why does everyone look like girls in part 5  The 80's were a different time  Because Araki likes to spice things up every now and a gain   Because your gender prejudice is too strong.      But Part 5 was serialized between '95 and '99.   Forget looking like girls, almost everyone has that same fucking face and build.  Fuck Araki, he sold his drawing talent in exchange for eternal youth.    I think he means the chronology   Early part 5 is arguably the worst art   really the biggest art change happened in Part 4    But mid part 4 was arguably the best    It's set in the 2000s    The worst is fucking 6. I cant believe this isn't general consensus.     There is literally no one in that image that I don't want to fuck in the vagina, wtf?!    To be fair that's entirely possible - he'd been trying to go with a female main protagonist since part 2 but his editors kept cockblocking him so he went "fuck it!" and just made them all reverse traps.  That and part 5 marked the point when he seemed to go more towards fashion models as body shape inspiration.            well, late 4 and early 5.     How is Bruno even standing like this? Are his feet glued to the ground?       But mid part 4 was arguably the best  that doesn't mean that the art didn't change.     I'm reading part 7 and I think sometimes Araki forgets that Johnny can't walk. The way he easily moves around is not something he could do crawling.  I want to ravage Narancia's boy pussy   I dunno.     Heyzeus's legs help him     I don't think the early 4 panel is representative.    Narcinia is best girl    Late 6 looks like shit, especially Jolyne that looks like a tranny.    The other thread got deleted it seems and there was some decent discussion in it too. Just don't name threads "edition" or "general" anymore, hopefully that will take the heat off.       sounds like the work of a moderator's stand     Are mods really deleting JoJo generals? Fucking finally.   A crack down on generals would severely increase the quality of the board.       What is 「GRAVITY」? Green baby don't hurt me     I thought they were purging them because there are usually multiple up at a time.   While the threads were fun there's nothing to talk about until JJL chapters/EoH trailer/general announcements of a Jojo nature. If jojofags really need a thread at the most have one weekly.  Why didn't Kira just use Sheer Heart Attack in the mansion instead on relying on slow ass air bubbles?   The one holding the knife is actually a girl... right?    A new chapter did just come out and we've actually had some unusually in-depth discussion about it over the last few days despite not even having a text translation yet. I understand why they'd want to get rid of generals but I think it's a real shame it happens just when all the cancer DIO's World brought in is finally clearing up.   That're some manly girls.   /ag/ when?    Nope    Because Araki just forgot.    Apparently the /a/ sings Jojo is going to be starting soon, someone said last thread that Jebus was going to pick it up. We should just stick to those threads.     Never.     Late part 7 is my favourite.    /r/ing an edit with them in the Gangstars' outfits and/or faces.    Early Part 3 was the best.     Because he knew they were aware of how it worked and he can only use one type of bomb at the time.     But Josuke couldn't do anything against it anyway,only Koichi could.   Araki got tired of drawing manly homos so he switched to twink homos.    He could divert it long enough to punch barrage Kira to death if he set something on fire.     Josuke could just punch it and it'd go back to Kira as his hand.    Early and Mid Part 7 was awesome, Araki started to suffer from his sameface syndrome around Late Part 7 and he has never stopped since then.    If he used Crazy Diamond's healing ability, it would go back to his left hand. Also, then he wouldn't be able to do anything offensively in that time period.    Actually at this point there's more variety than there was during either late 7 or the scratch nose era.   can anyone give me name of a music that is played during almost entire the world part from anime?   Darkness of the world i think.    Araki went through a David Bowie phase while writing part 5.     Araki had just learned to draw different faces around mid part 4 only to revert back to his sameface style in the next volume   Truly sad.  I think he hasn't found an equilibrium yet.        He got sick of people comparing his characters and artwork to Hokuto no Ken so instead of manly characters he went the opposite route and made them FABULOUS instead.    i love you     It's more like he didn't have to imitate HnK and buff 80's action stars once they went out of fashion and he became established enough to do his own thing when part 3 ended.     Didn't he lose it with his left hand?    It might just be my fetish for white hair talking, but I don't blame the Japs for liking Fugo as much as they do just because of his design.    I guess that worked out for him because that's what people prefer for him now, I mean fuck look at all the shit he's done since adapting that style.   NEWS ALERT-Actual Discussion approaching  http://jjlscans.tumblr.com/post/122<wbr>355928463/jojolion-44-delay   This month’s chapter is taking awhile because the store is slow to stock this issue and our Day 1 contact is hard to get in touch with this week.    Expect the chapter sometime really soon    Edited for brevity.       </wbr>     Fuck you.    No fuck you leatherman!    I liked the muscle bound style before part 4. Then everyone including Jotaro and Polnareff turned into fruit boys. There's manly fabulous and then there's faggot fabulous.    Both are acceptable as long as the source material is enjoyable. Like LotGH for example. Full of fruit boys, but still a great piece of work.     Early part 1 will always be objectively the worst.      it took me a while but damn.  J♂J♂     How did JoJo defeat DIO?   DIO stopped time   Crushed JoJo   JoJo apparently escaped via stopping time himself  But JoJo could move when DIO previously stopped time, so why did JoJo's time stop affect DIO?        I need the pastebin guys    I totally agree with you, Mid Part 4 is beautiful.     calling Jotaro JoJo     In terms of story and characters the first 3 parts were the best, series went to shit after he was forced to make it more mainstream     http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87     DIO's♂DARK♂FANTASY    http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87     Jotaro could move for 2 seconds within DIO's time stop   DIO can stop time for 9 seconds (as High DIO)   Jotaro stops time at the 9 second mark   DIO can move for two more seconds (now 11 seconds)   DIO can't move anymore         The youngest JoJo is the relevant JoJo     Implying   tfw Araki will never ever make women as beautiful as in Phantom Blood.      DIO seemingly crushed Jotaro to death before the 11 second mark    Because Araki is a massive faglord, but a cool faglord.    Those are 12 year olds.    I know. It's ridiculous but you just have to go with it. Araki is known for drawing things happening and then having a character say it didn't happen.  Wheel of Fortune burning Jotaro for example and then just saying it was his coat.       not colouring the painting on the wall  lazy colour job      Implying  He started excelling with females at part 4     I love how Araki used to draw women, even before Jojo. Gorgeous Irene is really  gorgeous.     The anatomy's kind of crap but the faces are truly gorgeous. So expressive.      So since they found it necessary to notify us this time I'm assuming we might not even get it this month.  Shit happens and all that and I do appreciate that we get scanlations at all, but I just really want to discuss Karera and Josefumi with you guys.      Looks like early part 1.     Fugo is not blonde  Welp.     Nobody here know enough japanese to translate it?    Yeah, Gorgeous Irene is really wild.    They said to expect it really soon, I don't think that there's anything strange about them giving us an explanation for being a few days late.    It is.    I like it, looks original. I do like Part 8 art a lot but, the sameface is kind of annoying sometimes.     Can someone explain what they're even wearing?    Clothes.    Now here's Gorgeous Irene with the Steel Ball Run art style.    I fucking hate it, how did Araki lose the ability to draw expressions on people's faces?.  Look at this Gyro from mid Part 7       He started diversifying after Paper Moon King, I think it's a telltale sign that he became aware of it.      Now look at this one from Late Part 7, that expression on his face it's terrible, it doesn't look sexy, or intimidating, nothing.     I'll give you late 7 and very early 8 but here's plenty of expression now. Our main character this time is the kind of guy who doesn't show his emotions much to the people who normally surround him, but look at the others around him.      He looks like Iggy before having a human face   Oh God. People really shouldn't be trying this early to guess the designs.  How long do we have to wait an announcement of Part 4 anime?  Like a month ago someone told me to do the phonetically matched lyrics for Jonathan's Ballad. So, uh, here it is I guess.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RwN<wbr>jSwZD8e8</wbr>  [ ]     Awful.    Jojolion Volume 10. We first saw the Iggy promo on a flyer from the Volume.    Please don't use Casca as a reaction image, it'll make me feel bad for fapping to her getting raped.  I wish she enjoyed it as much as I did.    Gyro SAS announced.   I'm pretty curious to see how he'd draw him now. Karera gets a lot of really good panels in this month's chapter and her thick eyebrows reminded me of her a bit.    That's pretty nice, i love the song and Jonathan.    Damn, that's fucking nice, It makes me really appreciate Johnathan.    As dorky as it is to say, I understand why the guy yesterday said Jonathan was his favorite Jojo now.    Jonathan has always been my favorite Jojo     tfw we'll never get an OVA/HFTF The World    This should have played when Jotaro kill DIO.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Yqt<wbr>JqKgemw4</wbr>  [ ]     Making the video was such a treat for myself as well because Jonathan is also my favorite JoJo.     No Diego SAS   No Shadow DIO SAS   You'll never have 5 different Dio SAS figures        Jonathan is the kindest and most gentle JoJo in the entire series. He's Kenshiro if he wasn't so stoic.    Would you fuck your favorite jjba character?   I would let Diego fuck my ass<br/>     Where is the Pucci SAS, and the Whitesnake     Would you fuck your favorite jjba character?  That's like an anon if they breathe air.      no diego  it hurts.    At some point he played so much with the clothes that forgot the faces.   They did say they were doing more villain part 5 SAS then they'll move on to 7. Have hope anon.      Can't unsee young Dio      Italian civilian clothing To blend in     YOU THOUGHT IT WAS DIO? NO, IT WAS I, IRINE.     No, this is Dio.     Purest Jojo didn't deserve that fate   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=DMj<wbr>hY98bf-g</wbr>  [ ]  I love DIO's adventures as a nun under a bridge in Japan.    Ｓｉｍｐｌｅ Ｓｕｂｊｅｃｔｓ Ｓｗｉｎｄｌｅｄ Ｓｗｉｆｔｌｙ ｆｏｒ Ｓｈｅｋｅｌｓ...  ...「ｓ4ｓ」     You lost. Now leave.    Far more HnK than JJBA.    This is the only good JJBA AMV I've ever seen in my life, and i'm not crying.    I wasn't trying, that was just the best image I have of [s4s]-tan    And to think I was just going to but the lyrics on a black screen to avoid being grouped in with the AMV crowd.    Araki can just recreate the late part 3/mid part 4 look can't he. If so, why doesn't he do that whenever he redraws characters from old parts. Jonathan looks like a downie in all the recent drawings. The Kenshiro look suited him.   J♂J♂'s Bizzare L♂cker R♂♂m    Because he can't recreate them.    what is the fastest stand? besides Made in Heaven of course   I heard he could. He said that in the J♂j♂nium volumes. He prefers the faggot statue of david sameface art.    possibly silver chariot without armor     Mind to post a link?   Weather Report when?      SUTAR PURACHIMA    Possibly. Even with armor, it matched Star Platinum in speed.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1XT<wbr>gcfwi_L8</wbr>  [ ] Did Kakyoin and Dio engage in homosex in Egypt, other than the fisting?     Fall♂off♂your♂horse    Now I want to reread/rewatch Phantom Blood. People seem to forget about how interesting it is because of the other parts, myself included.    they look the fucking same    DIO was his first friend.    He doesn't care how any old character looks after their part has ended and they'll never appear in the manga again. Check this out, it's from part 4's time.   He also doesn't care much for Jonathan. Back when he made his top 10 he was the only Jojo not on it.      Ah. Right there. Right there was the start of the downward spiral into sameface and scratched n♂ses.      Dio knew Kakyoin better than any of his other "friends" did       Still no C-moon.   ;-;   Spiral staircase.      No, that was always the way it was with old characters. Part 3 style Ikuro and Part 3 style young Joseph were just Jotaros, and Joseph and Jonathan looked the same a lot of the time to begin with.    what was that stand that moved through electricity? that may be the fasted     No C-Moon   No MiH      You could still tell between J♂seph and J♂nathan. I'd say it was part 3 that it became difficult to tell between the faces. Especially between Kekyoin and J♂tar♂.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=V-B<wbr>Bt29m0I8</wbr>  [ ]   Kakyoin had a longer mouth and thinner eyebrows. He also didn't had a more colder facial expression rather than that eternally pissed look that Jotaro always had.    they specifically state that it's useless against josuke     You could still tell between J♂seph and J♂nathan  You couldn't even tell between Dio and Caesar     It doesn't really fit.   Can Yotsuba beat Jotaro?   Yes.   Well, now that the season is over I'm gonna probably start reading part 7, but I'd still like something to watch. Do you fellas have any recommendations for some fun, silly shonen like JoJo?   hokuto no ken    Between the different girls? Araki has never had much variety between female faces but I'd say he's doing quite a bit better than usual in that regard this time around. Hato is particularly distinct, but I wouldn't mistake Yasuho, Karera, or Daiya for each other either.    ya ya ya    They've never looked like women. Abandon your meme    Is there any way to download the Heritage for the Future OST (without using a Youtube downloader)?     Isn't it in the pastebin?    The OST? i don't think so.    Holy shit you're right Cheers, dude     You shouldn't ask for recommendations on /a/ but what the hell, Read Devilman, you've always got to read Devilman.  That or Berserk, but you've probably already read Berserk, who hasn't? Once both are done, try reading Parasyte, emphasis on "reading". If you're more into comedy, watch Detroit Metal City, or GTO. Both are ridiculous yet enjoyable shows.   Some other great stuff to consider. Grapper Baki Golgo 13  Cromartie High Getter Robo VIOLENCE HERO Riki-Oh.  MD Geist is overblown and fucking ridiculous but you might like it or you might hate it. Inferno Cop. Legend of koizumi is short but sweet. It's about three Ovas long.   If you’d rather read more manga try, Keiji of the Flowers at the Other Side of the Clouds. It was written by the original author of Fist of the North Star. Also Kyou Kara Ore Wa is a good manga. Its a comedy but the characters are manly as fuck. Its like Cromartie High but better.  Bonus: If you’re a sadist, pick up Wolfsmund.  This list should be enough until you learn to pick up the spoon.                         YUKAKO LOOKS LIKE A STEPPED ON BABY    Not him but thanks, i've seen most of the stuff on your list but I could never find more like it and google fails me.    Araki wanted to be a fashion designer, for Gucci. He started JoJo after they refused to employ him. http://www.style.com/slideshows/fas<wbr>hion-shows/spring-2016-menswear/man<wbr>/collection/7</wbr></wbr>        You could, Di♂ is much more fabulous than Caesar    Why don't they have nipples?    Please no, i don't want the thread to be deleted again.   Anyone else think Josuke was being a dick to Yasuho? He just ran off with the other bitch   ability to load songs from your hard drive into ASB during battle   DIO vs Kakyoin   El Cairo   Noriaki Kakyoin's Theme       This is impressively edited   has anyone put the HFTF WRYYY over the anime scene?   The thread is going to be fine.     Why does everyone look like girls in part 5   You're telling me they're not?      i don't see how giving every female a manface is excelling m8     meme   Resorting to buzzwords when you can't defend your point      Nah, I'm sure Yotsuba's stand would be [MONEY FOR NOTHING] in the form of pic related    Hanged Man, nothing else came close to the speed of light.    I'm sorry I don't want to waste more time in making them wear the clothes, but I tried.   What's a good cosplay for a 6'2" lanky Puerto Rican   No, but I did this, much better than the anime wryyy  https://dl.bucket.pw/xhzdoo.mp4     Will part 2 get a print jojonium release in English? Everything I read only talks about it being released in digital..   That the lanky gentlemen in flourescent clothing, with their obvious male features, do not look like women? I didn't think I needed to explain that to anyone who's dick isn't confused.  b-but my ultra funneh meme OP!  Who knew how cancerous this could be        with their obvious male features  My sides     as far as i know   another vento chapter is done. kinda funny that abbachio is driven by the desire to let giorno be right.   Least he's in Eyes of Heaven  The only SBR character announced so far      :to not let giorno be right   So who's the best translation group for Part 4 of JoJo?    Part 5   araki goes full fabulous gay from then on        much better than the anime wryyy  fucking seriously why did the Anime WRYYYY suck so bad?     Currently reading Part 8. So, Gappy likes pressure on top of him while he sleeps because he's used to being under all the dirt while he was buried, right?   I think the anime would have looked a lot better if they kept the Part 2 style.     Part 2 style was only maintainable because they barely animated it       JOJOLION CHAPTER 8 WHEN??   Excluding early part 7, his art really went to shit starting at late part 4 and onward.    Nope. Silver Chariot managed to cut it when it was moving.     He does a shorter version of that very same cry when he does the rush in this screencap.     I think he's full of shit    black jojo    That's a big dick.    4u    This is very nice but i'm pretty sure that isn't really a very good translation, and there are better ones.  it doesn't even translate shinshi as gentleman on a Jonathan song     Parts 1-3: Stone Mask and Dio trilogy Parts 4-6: Arrow and Heaven trilogy Parts 7-9: New Universe trilogy  It's ok to end it here Araki.      anyone else find it freaky that the green baby is based off of a Toyol?    implying there won't be 27 parts    Do people still think Araki has that big of a sameface problem anymore? All the males in part 8 now look very different from one another. Even the females are better now     Parts 4-6: Arrow and Heaven trilogy   trilogy   4 parts  wat         Can you count?    Part 4, 5 and 6. That's 3.  You can count right? A Trilogy is a story told in 3 parts.      It's time to go to bed, anon.                  Please.....      This would be nice as fuck in 1920 * 1080     anon... if only    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zF1<wbr>-RCBuHwQ</wbr>  [ ]  What do you think of the New Style?              So if this was drawn by Araki then it means that he can draw the old parts right?    he also does one when hes muda-ing the Road roller which i consider to be Very fucking good              Fantastic. Well done.          How did he jumped that fountain?     To the guy that's posting JoJo art, mind if you focus on stuff Araki did when he wrote Parts 1, 2, and 3?   How about a version without that awful cover in which Jolyne looks like a man.  I'd probably change the Josuke pic so Koichi doesn't appear on it but I'm too lazy.      I'm impressed considering Japan's boner for Dio.    Remember when Josuke healed it so it would go back and he could track Kira an arc before that?   OTP   Did you forget Lisa Lisa?    Wasn't that just because he cut off his hand? If it wasn't the case then josuke should be able to force all stands back to the user.    pop pop pop the poppers      Imagine all the hatesex after defeating Valetine.     What's your favorite overlooked stand design? Mine is Scan     post best boy   The Hand   Waiting on Part 4 anime for best OTP ever.   literally who    Fuck you I like that cover.     What impresses me about this photo is that someone made a Figma-scale bathroom set.     That's a nice fucking filename.    I hate midgets. I wish Yukako was paired with Josuke. Hell, anyone would be better than fucking Koichi     anyone would be better than fucking Koichi  what about now?     Never played FFX. What's happening here?    Only by putting his blade where he predicted it was going to move preemptively. Do you remember how the fight went down or what?     Gorgeous Irene and Baoh will never be acknowledged again    Irene won't be in eyes of heaven       Apparently(don't quote me on this) there's a random bug that can happen during boss battles in the game that causes your party to face backwards,and doing certain attacks while that's happening will cause your character to run away and never look back.    How's this, anon?    I remember Araki saying that he's really embarressed when he looks back at Gorgeous Irene.Something about not knowing how to write female main characters back then.    Silver Chariot still needed the precision and speed to even hit it since it travels at the speed of light.      Fuck you nigger I'll slit your throat and feed your disgusting guts to a pack of hungry dogs.    Something along the lines of him being embarrassed about his immature view of women at the time and that it was before he was married. He was 25 at the time though.     part 7/part 8 artsyle on the pillar men   part 6 artstyle on joseph      Pretty sure both the foreground and background are early 7   Hey, the newest JoJolion chapter was translated. No scans yet tho https://twitter.com/Kewl0210/status<wbr>/613899087516147712</wbr>   I never visit Jojo threads. I'll make an exception now to say the following:  That roodo rollar. Based Koyasu and based David. It was great. Too bad no Part 4 adaptation.        JoJos look the same.    ACDC/Esidisi looks great on that.    i'm not sure when he drew that, but he recently stated that he can draw in his old style but chooses to not as they've grown in his eyes    Fuck yeah.    Looks good!    I'm going to kill Araki if he gives Jonathan Ceasar's headband again.     That weird but kinda hot Lisa Lisa   lol at Iggy   Part V cast on a bullet train is pretty cool.        I love the Frankenstein-esque look of Early Part 4. Pissed off Josuke looked like a bad motherfucker.      karera isn't the enemy  oh shit she might survive       What does SAS stand for?      But... I did. In order to make the lyrics match phonetically I had to stretch out most sentences and swap the order of them appearing. Thus "A gentlemanly glow" being swapped with "Kindness; He did show".    Her stand power seems pretty shit.   I can only make his 'hair' grow in places he touched himself. I missed out on getting paid... My range is only up to to 80 meters, so even if I grow hair on their bald heads, once I move away from them, it all just falls out so they get mad and ask for their money back and stuff.         Narancia looks top built and Lisa Lisa looks 18 rather than 25.    That's actually pretty hilarious    Worse than Yukako's Love Deluxe.    Jesus Narancia is a fucking caveman.    Pretty accurate to how he looked on the lineup page then.      We haven't seen it used outside of the context of grifting yet so I wouldn't be that quick to make judgements. It has a body, for one thing.      He predicted it's path and basically put his sword in the way    I don't want to touch that thing.    Hopefully it's a punch ghost  Anyone else kinda tired of seeing these great Stand designs not getting enough use? Josh's stand never appeared again for instance.      Karera in my country means 'cost a lot'.    It only appeared two times, to help escape from the thugs and to undress Yasuho.    I hope my bby Karera double-teams these Rock twins with Gappy.   Let's hear those original Stands.  VOYAGER The user is able to instantly interchange places with another living being in a 30 m radius, with the only condition being that the user has to know the exact location of the being he's gonna interchange places with. Aside from this, the stand posseses no other attacks and it's up to the user to figure out how to use this ability to his advantage.       Time to sperg out. I want an antagonist stand that knows it's in a manga.Kind of like deadpool but not edgy or pop culturey.It's mostly a punch ghost,but it's power lets it rearrange or punch directly through the manga's panels.Don't ask me how this would be handled in an anime adaptation.  ok I'm done now      anyone have the one where dio is going to suck jotaros dick dry?   Heaven's Door Requiem     Did you get this?     The way I see it, either she dies now or Josuke helping her with the twins convinces her to stick by his side even when she finds out he's not really Secchan anymore.  She'll most likely die at some point either way but I really want her to stay around for a while because her design and personality are great. Her and Yasuho would have some amusing interactions too.     where does josuke buy his sailor uniforms    the gap     He took Kira's.    At the sailor shop  Now seriously, there's a ton of then at Kira's house.      Yeah but that one still has the "red dot" indicating its not done, as well as the number 6.  But I guess I can live with that, it's a whole lot better than the 6.      BACKSTREET BOY/THE CALL The stand is basically a cellphone that allows the user to call his past and future self. You can only call/recieve calls from yourself exactly 24 hours into the past or future, no sooner or later.  Call your future self   No response         So like Mirai Nikki but not shitty?   I like it.       So that everyone could look like men in part 6.     It's hard to have sex when you're dead   Raws: http://tieba.baidu.com/p/3839343714<wbr> Script: https://mangahelpers.com/t/kewl0210<wbr>/releases/41436</wbr> </wbr>   are you actually gay   Motivate me to read part 8.   anyone?    why is araki so lewd    /a/ is a christian board, go look for such things elsewhere.    Waifus    Her shorts are on you know.   where can i find a good english translation of jojo with all the proper names and HQ? inb4 pastebin.   batoto.    But her zippers could be open  if you don't know what's happening.     batoto is horrible. pic related   Antagonist Stand's   S  MiH, D4C: Love Train  A  King Crimson, D4C  B  The World (Joestar blood), KQ: Bites the Dust, C-Moon, The World  C  Killer Queen, Whitesnake  Protagonist Stand's   S+  GER  A  none  B  Tusk 4, Star Platinum  C  Gold Experience, Soft&amp;Wet, Stone Free, Crazy Diamond  agree/ disagree?                         Good luck then.   I don't think eating out with the shorts on is comfortable.       she has a dick      Let me fix that.

Outwardly she's lewd as fuck.    Fucking Erina doesn't even know how to read.    GE and S&amp;W both would beat Crazy Diamond in a fight more likely than not.   I guess we're finally done this collaboration unless we want a replacement on 6.   Not much difference other than putting them on different tiers, which i don't disagree with.  but putting crazy diamond above gold experience and Soft&amp;Wet is total shit. They both have more potential and would stomp Josuke. Stone Free is arguable     best design    I put Crazy Diamond above them because of its strength and speed, which is comparable to Star Platinum.      Narancia looks like a girl   His stand is Aerosmith     DUDE LOOKS LIKE A LADY   Do you think Araki did that on purpose?        yes.    oh shit deepest lore     i know, most fights are fought with abilities alone though. Soft&amp;Wet is more versatile AND can easily be used at a distance. Gold Experience has healing, stun punches, tracking, and poison.  still it's just my opinon      Can I get a image of the finished collab?       That Kakyion actually looks bishie, is this what nips see him as all the time?   What was the deal with tie guy? He just didn't show up anymore in part 5.   Old Navy    He looks like a certain painting there, but I can't think of which. Like he has Mona Lisa eyes but not really. Any ideas?    This one?    Not quite but it has the idea.   Good thing the anime kept his size consistent.      Would you pay $20 to be killed by Gold Experience Requiem?   No.     I actually like that Yukako design    Hopefully, the high school students in the Part 4 anime will look younger.   I like it because she has  a large forehead,and large foreheads are my fetish.     Why      I want to live then die, not both forever.    Red hat chilappano pappers?   Why are mods deleting our threads? we have done nothing wrong.   Too much cancer and shitposting    I can understand deleting the generals. What's gay as shit as how they leave all the other cancer threads up. Yuru yuri generals, daily threads, le ebin everyday till you like, footfag threads, etc.    mods are biased.     That animation quality in the first few episodes   Why did it have such a fast decline? I think they rolled with confidence but then they needed to dial it down a bit.      So you wouldn't want to live forever?      yea the animation was all over the fucking place in Stardust Crusaders. At least season 1 was consistently bad.    It really was.    But it kills you too.    It doesn't actually kill you though. You just almost die before you get sent to a new scenario. I see no downside.    But what about the excruciating pain in over half of the scenarios?    Say that to the countless fate threads, mods don't give a fuck.  At least we always keep our shit on one thread.      Could I live longer than the 36th Kars?   DO YOU UNDERTANDOO  YARE YARE DAZEEEEEE     KONO DIO DA!         (And Giorno)    if jotaro got out from under the steamroller, what was that squishing noise?  did jotaro shit himself?     I don't hear a squishing noise.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=64t<wbr>8dPnU2BU</wbr>  [ ]  listen closely at 3:58-4:01      I did listen to it. It just sounded like a high pitched crashing noise. They probably need to hire another sound mixer.   I want to cum inside DIO.   Didn't star platinum punch sunlight    hard to say, punchghost stands regularly punch FTL  No seriously, Platinum, World, Chariot, Diamond, Echoes 3, Experience, Stone Free, KISS all strike FTL.      If only Valentine used D4C like a real punch ghost instead of karate chopping his way through things.     Probably could pick a better cover for Jolyne. Like the one where she's crawling, or the one where she's sitting, or a few others.     no more friday.    What about it?   Forgot to post this last Friday.   Do you not want horrible pain in your immortality?    i love how it looks like theyre all coming together to cheer Jotaro on like some spirit bomb shounen thing  someone draw it      You're the cancer Doc.   A little bonus for you guys.   dam!!! nice reactions...... but wheres the pewds one???????     He doesn't make them.    You mean  Chibi ? He didnt have any sort of "worthy" reactions    None of them is worth a shit.  Except for YOOOOO.      I can't understand half the shit he's saying, but it's still a fun watch.      anime centrul is fucking hilarious   BDv4 pics are out   Is Avdol on the inside?    no each BD only has 2 characters.    v1 Iggy/Jotaro v2 Advol/Joseph v3 Joseph/Polnereff v4 Iggy/Kakyoin  2 more to go, who's next?         Iggy/Iggy    Abdul/Pol Jotaro/Dio    I'm going to marry DIO!    Abdul/Pol  How has that not been done yet?     Part 4   Batoto only has v29 onward   Madoka only has v1-v19   pastebin only has v29 onward   Were v20-28 not redone?       So is part 4 going to be animated?    Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't part 4 still have a shitty translation? It says on the first post of Invincible Trio that he isn't actually retranslating anything, just proofreading the mangled sentences.     IGGY'S ASS  DOG ASS       doesn't go SONO CHI NO SADAME JO   legpunch   crack   JOOO   disappointing.         Why are Araki metaphors so bad?    After seeing this, you can't really blame DavidPro for not using one of the old OPs for this scene. It's too sudden - there's no room for buildup, and if they were to have the music start before DIO got up and kicked, it would ruin the suspense. They must have thought about it - they did do it for Part 2, after all - and decided that none of the OPs really fit the scene. Like, while it is a scene of victory, three of his friends just got killed, and for all he knows at that point his grandfather is dead too. Not exactly a SONO CHI NO SADAME moment.         Soft &amp; Wet is C  He can take inertia out of a fucking floor. If Josuke can win with bullshit like that, there's no way it's not A tier at least.  Also isn't Tusk 4 one of the scariest stands? It's strong enough to bypass Jesus magic.        Man, for all the tragedy and build up, it really was a boring victory, huh? The World just breaks because     http://www.amiami.com/top/detail/de<wbr>tail?gcode=TOY-SCL2-17661</wbr>     Why is part 6 filled with people having elf-ears?   Araki's assistants were probably fucking around    It's a stand ability. Probably.    Vampire spawn integrating into society    well a theory is that   Mikitaka brought friends from ayy planet     If Kars was the ultimate life form why didn't he have a stand?   Why does the ultimate life form need a stand?    Because it adds to the ultimateness.   That's like asking 'why does the ultimate life form need immortality'.      But what you're saying is like saying "why didn't he have nuclear weapons?"   why does johnny have that stupid fucking feather on his back   Nuclear weapons are not a natural part of organisms. Stands are. Therefore as the ultimate life form he should have had access to the ultimate natural power in the Jojo universe, as he had suped up versions of every other life forms abilities.    He stole it from Soundman's corpse    it doesn't even look like a feather, it's like some reality altering artifact that's always drawn in a contrasting style        These are shipping at the end of the month, can't wait.    How did Jotaro not die from that barrage?    The 3-episodes Rule.   It's an italian thing   How about you  Watch the fucking episode.     Really? Not the guy, but asking something like that seems pretty reasonable. Even people who have watched it. Jotaro doesn't have any regenerative abilities, yet he could take as much damage as DIO could. The knives were one thing, but he shouldn't be able to move after that as he clearly doesn't have SP protecting him.    The World kills Kakyoin with one punch which goes through him like butter and Star Platinum's barrage on Dio shredded him up. Meanwhile The World's barrage just fractures some of Jotaro's bones, which doesn't even seem to matter since he's moving fine moments later.  The correct answer is 'plot armor', retard.      IMMORTAL INVINCIBLE  STAND POWER!!!       For some reason I feel like DIO held back so it wouldn't cause any puncture wounds so he could drink every ounce of blood when he finally kills him but then again It's most likely just 'plot armor'     Star Platinum was guarding him from inside and crossed his fists like a shield.     But how is that possible when he was still frozen in time? Star Platinum used its 2 seconds to punch Dio and didn't end in a defensive stance.    Jesus fucking christ, Star platinum never had to move. Picture it more like reinforcing the outer layer of your skin with powerful armour and having your gut be the strongest layer because of Star platinum having his arms crossed in that spot.  This has nothing to do with weither or not he was frozen, its just reinforcing his body with a very powerful shield from within.     Dio hit his 9 seconds before attacking. He was too busy gloating.    Except Star Platinum ended its 2 seconds outside of Jotaro, because it was busy punching Dio. Unless you're saying Jotaro can unconjure then reconjure Star Platinum within himself while frozen in time.   The time was over only when The World was doing its kick barrage, which is when Star Platinum clearly raised its arms in defense. Time was still frozen during the punch barrage though.       He stuffed his shirt with manga.   Imagine being a bystander watching the bridge during the end of Stardust Crusaders. One moment there'd be a Japanese dude being chased by a banana, a millisecond later, there's a steam roller and the banana is on the floor crippled.    Other than plot armor, this seems like the most plausible case. However, even it seems like it's off because why would DIO not want to puncture him, but then shortly after desire to crush him with a steamroller?    Gyro is fucking creepy at times.   Anyone else here misses the times when Jojo was drawn more like ToF. I really miss the masculinity the series used to have.   You're also forgetting that Dio was going to skewer him with knives.  Anyone who thinks it's anything but plot armor is delusional.      I balance JoJo out with other manga so the new artstyle doesn't bother me as much.    I'm gonna guess and say the steamroller would keep all the blood in one location other than scattered or he just got fed up with dealing with him and wanted to end it.    Speaking of gay porn artists, I'm surprised Mentaiko hasn't drawn any fanart of Jojo. It seems like something right up his alley.    I re-read part 1 a few weeks ago and everyone looked like squashed yams. Initially, It was such a gradual change It didn't even bother me.   Quick question, how long exactly is the DIO's World fight? Say you had a bystander in real time, not anime time, watching the whole thing. About how long was it?    Our main character this time is the kind of guy who doesn't show his emotions much to the people who normally surround him, but look at the others around him.  He really is SBR Jotaro    Been considering giving Part 8 a go?  How is it so far? Interesting? I've heard it is a bit meandering and doesn't seem to be going in a clear direction.     ~30 min?    There's no time frame given for the car chase so discounting that, from DIO chasing Kakyoin to dying, it's only about 5 minutes at best, and that's if you're being generous with the time DIO spends chasing Joseph and Kakyoin.  The manga says that when Jotaro is going to have his head cut off with the sign, Kakyoin died roughly 2 minutes ago and the rest of the fight is less than that.  So like 5 minutes after the car chase, it could have been a couple of hours if you count it from the stair scene.         inb4 someone says 5 minutes and we finally understand why Namek too so long to explode.    show me what you got!      that mayo bottle     Meanwhile gintoki has 4 set of same clothes.    He also wore a black and yellow one for a second, in that Sadaharu episode.    Because Kagura is a girl, so she gets to have lots of clothes like real girl should. Also, it's a subtle reference to Ranma. Notice how Ranma always changed style of his/her chinese outfit each episode? There's the resemblance.        And Okada will reveal she had Umr-at-Tawil Syndrome because of too much exposition to WIXOSS factors.   ART DIRECTION    tfw no stirred translations  ;_;    Why is she so perfect?   disgusting fatty     fat  In the best places.     Ill fight you M8     insults 2nd best girl using image of worst girl  Dyke a shitty annoying one-note character. Chiya a pure and graceful maiden who loves her friends so much and runs a successful business making delicious treats and tea.    Someone post some rabbit-stepping webm.  K-Ons have the best fashion sense.    They ain't real, niggas     I am, but not on her birthday.    Good observation friend, doesn't stop me doing it for her     Mio best girl and best fashion sense.     I love Azunyan, but that shirt is long that, combined with the puffy skirt, makes her torso long and unattractive. Shorter shirt would've been golden   Ok anon, what's your excuse for not having Seiba as a waifu and not worshiping her?   Fucking secondaries and their retarded shit just fuck off.   Because of her fanbase. While I don't hate Saber, I actually really liked her back in 2006, her fanbase most be the worst of a single character in the history of anime.  I honestly couldn't stand having her as a waifu knowing I would be associated with other Saberfags. I feel bad for the honest Saberfags that are not just shitposters or band wagoners.     She's cute but I like Medea-san    The famous dude was actually a girl. She did have a cock though.    "Due to her time as a pseudo-male, her claim of "I know how to please a man" comes from personal experience." If that's not perfection, tell me what is.  To me, she is everything. My mother, my sister, my wife, my king, my everything.   </blockquote>]
