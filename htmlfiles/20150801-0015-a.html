Eventually there'll be an Aoi episode anyway which should be cute.</br>  Filthy citizens, making Hikari feel depressed.  Does this series have shonen battles?  <br>Series started with Shuu teleporting vending machine trying to attack Akane</br>  <br>This is based on a slice of life 4-Koma with super powers. I highly doubt there will be anything aside from some competitive use of powers during challenges.<br>It's pretty comfy/cute though.</br></br>  <br>Poor Teru.</br>  <br>Where do people get the 4koma that's often posted in this threads? Like the one about Shuu and Kanade's past. <br><br>Is it just some anon randomly translating future chapter or is it a apparently different manga?</br></br></br>  <br>I think the anon who translated those pages said he scanned the magazine. Volume 3 is coming out soon though.</br>  <br>Oh so it was from the same manga. I thought it was a spinoff or something.</br>  <br>Is this a reference to Durararara!! ?</br>  <br>I doubt it, since the next panels are him stealing her skirt and pantyhose.</br>      <br><br>You calling YuiKaori Ugly?</br></br>  dem voices  <br>Here, have a 10/10 clean<br> I need to learn how to use photoshop properly </br></br>  I thought the anime makes the debris worse than in the manga?  <br>It seems he acts like a slacker most of the time in public. Even his classmates treat him like he's a commoner so he doesn't get the respect like the other siblings do.  Though he's the best onii-chan in reality. </br>  <br> like a slacker most of the time in public <br>More like a perv.</br></br>  <br>I don't remember seeing him acting like a perv in public though. He only acts like that with Akane. It's more like he doesn't care and just sits back doing nothing.</br>  <br>He doesn't acts like a perv, but from my reading he is seen as a perv for some reason.</br>  <br>It's probably because everybody but Akane knows that he's in her fanclub or something.</br>  <br> for some reason </br>  Not quite a panty shot when it's a swimsuit  I wonder if any of these girls are the author's waifu?  <br>Looks like it's off centre too which strikes me as extra lewd. Although in reality someone just messed it up a bit.<br><br><br>If any of them are, it's Akane</br></br></br></br>  <br> it's Akane <br>Good taste then.</br></br>  Just getting into this series because of the fanservice from last ep. This is pretty fun. <br><br>It's apparently more of an SoL with a weird touch.</br></br>    Nearly done with the first segment, I ended up starting later than last week, but it should still be out tomorrow, just slightly later in the day.  <br>thank you based mpt</br>  <br>incest is best</br>  <br>The word wincest exists for a reason, after all</br>  <br>I love your efforts MPT, have an Akane.</br>  Their country is doomed.  <br> Onii-sama </br>  <br>Take it easy. Did you solve the typesetting problem?</br>  <br>Why?</br>  <br>Akane a qt</br>  Have you noticed that Akane's skin is pinkier than the rest of the cast...?    <br>So why'd she rise in the rankings? Was it from the city cleaning day?</br>  <br><br>Based MPT. You're awesome.</br></br>  <br>You are not a true connoisseur of superior 2D bodies yet. Keep working hard and someday you might even reach our level.</br>  <br>The entire Manga is fall in love with Akane the Mc please.</br>  <br>muh dick</br>  <br>Because Kanade and Haruka are the only ones with any capacity to rule a country and there is no way either of them will win.</br>  <br>Maybe Aoi's also able to do it but she just doesn't want to.</br>  <br>Haruka actually has a dim view of Kanade, thinking Kanade is placing national interest SECOND. (Chapter 20)</br>  <br>...maybe it's one of Misakis anyway.</br>  <br>Poor Shuu. He's such a good big bro. He places last so none of his other siblings feel bad about being last.</br>  <br>Shiori will be a great leader once she's a bit older. Hell, she'd be better than most already.</br>  Subs when  So Akane will turn into a NEET or something?  <br>I doubt it. She has a strong sense of what ought to be done, despite her shyness.</br>  Why did Akane show her pantsu in last ep? She's a bit of a prude as I watch the first couple of eps.  <br>You mean when she forgot to wear her skirt?</br>  <br>Her skirt was tore on way to school, but when she was changing into shorts, the bell rang and she decided is better be bottomless than be late.</br>  <br>She thought she was wearing shorts underneath the top.</br>  <br>Kanade is supersex</br>  <br>Thank you based MPT</br>  Loving this show.  I want to cum inside Hikari.  <br>She is the lewd one.</br>  <br>C U M I N S I D E<br>U<br>M</br></br></br>  <br><br> this absolutely adorable girl will became a cowtit in a few years <br>Do we get to see the middle ground too? B cup Hikari would be perfection.</br></br></br>   The instant I saw Akane-sama in a swimsuit, I felt a lot better. I'll follow her for the rest of my life. <br>Anon pls</br>  <br>Is this the Akane FC board?</br>  <br>Haruka call is a fansite.</br>  <br>Let me get this rite...<br><br>6 wants 5 dick<br>4 wants 2 dick<br>9 wants 8 cudles and handholding<br>1 wants 9 cudles<br><br>Alot of incest here</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really think Haruka's posting here.<br><br><br>You forgot 3 wants 2 dick too.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Wait, they're incestuous?</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>It's canon that Misaki wants Haruka's dick. The others are half text half subtext.</br>  <br>mmm.. didnt notice that until i saw the manga<br><br><br>Welcome to this ride!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone are subtext, others just need to say "I want your D/V card" while Shu got a girl from outside, he's still a siscon though.</br>  <br> You'll never hug by your onee-chan <br>I don't know about that. My sister and I went out for lunch and she was linking arms with me. I got a little spooked after that.</br></br>  <br>Pick the fuckup</br>  <br>Don't bother, the incest is just bait. The faggot brother chose a commoner instead of his bombshell sister.</br>  <br>I don't understand the hype either. It's the same shit as C.C's ass, people praise it to hell and back when Kallen's is just as big and shapely.</br>  <br>Don't bother with crazies.</br>  Any good Aoi scene this episode? I need my nee-chan dose.  <br>It's all about the number of exposures.<br>CC shows her ass more than Kallen, meanwhile Kallen shows her tits more.</br></br>   girl <br> wants to be king <br>what is this shit.</br></br>  <br>mikasa pls</br>  <br>That's because the Japanese word for monarch is unisex (ou).</br>  <br>It's more because they have a word for queen (女王) but this is not using it for whatever reason</br>  <br>The first skit is about a trip of the siblings, so she does has a cut or two...</br>  <br>What other shows has the artist(s) worked on? It reminds me of another show, but I can't remember what it was.</br>  <br>Twin-tail.</br>  <br>Twintails?</br>  <br>I mean Ore Twintail no Narimatsu.</br>   the dandelion and twintails artist is Kasuga Ayumu   Based Haruka.  <br><br> There are people in this thread RIGHT NOW who wouldn't vote for Shiori <br><br>I don't want to live in this kingdom anymore</br></br></br></br>  <br>Unfortunately not, I thought about making a vector pattern of the dots and clipping it into the text, but apparently that's fairly laggy and a lot of players don't quite liten properly, so it'll just be coloured rather than patterned.</br>  <br> Fuck the tits  <br> look at that midriff <br><br>Simultaneously? Or in that order?<br>Either way, that'll require some strategic placement</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Twincest is wincest.</br>  <br>I too want to prprprprprprprprpr</br>  <br>I don't think people here (or at least me) need fancy typesetting, so don't worry.</br>  <br>Is that like a motorboating sound?</br>  <br>Yeah, I didn't think it was too important, but figured that if I could, I may as well go all out</br>  <br>peropero<br>ペロペロ</br></br>  <br>A diamond that goes unnoticed. Too many cute girls.</br>  <br>Watashi perorisuto?</br>  What is this face trying to tell us?  <br>Nothing but sisterly love.</br>  <br>DICK IN MY MOUTH<br><br>NOW</br></br></br>  <br> God I wanna have an 8 way with you right here, right now. <br> Why are you reading that book when I'm right here ready for that taboo dicking <br> WHY WON'T YOU LOVE ME! </br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't it be a nin way? her, 7 clones, and Haruka</br>  Hahaha, it's twincest time.  <br>One of her clones is way too lazy. Haruka would have to do all the work, but not with 7 other Misakis right there with him.</br>  Wait, I'm slowpoke as fuck Satou and Twintails' Aika have the same VA?  <br>do all of the Misakis share the same attraction for Haruka?</br>  <br>The way I understand it is that all her clones have one personality trait of the original amplified, but they're all still Misaki at the core. So probably, but in varying degrees.<br><br>What I don't know is if Misaki gets all the memories of her clones once she recombines.</br></br></br>  The 3 of them can pass off as a family.  <br> no Aoi to pat your head <br> no Aoi to welcome you every night after a long day at work <br> no Aoi to tell you that everything is gonna be daijobu <br>Yet another reason to kill myself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, Kanade x Shu = shiori</br>  <br> The 3 of them can pass off as a family. <br>But... they are a family.</br></br>  <br>You're right, I thought it was 7 all together, I'm an idiot.</br>  <br><br><br>I just noticed that they have different eye colors. Also, why is it always the purple one who is the slut?</br></br></br>  <br>Imagine 8 Misakis rushing in through the door like that to jump on you and  cuddle  you.</br>  picked up  <br>I dunno, the one of the far left looks pretty angry, I don't think I've heard of aggressive cuddling before</br>  <br>Not many more pleasant ways to go</br>  <br>so they're the 7 sins of Misaki?<br><br> Slutty one best one </br></br></br>  <br>Maybe she just wants to be first for once.</br>  <br>I'd be a little worried about what the wrath girl would do to me.</br>  <br>You can't really tell which one the others are except sloth, wrath and lust.</br>  First two segments are done, Haruka had a surprsingly good excuse; maybe another couple of hours before they're done.  <br>Thank you anon</br>  <br>Faito, MPT-kun!</br>  <br> Haruka had a surprsingly good excuse <br>I just don't know why he doesn't say that in the first place, or the fact that Akane is oblivious to the fact that they've always seen as celebrities.</br></br>  I don't know if anyone's made stitches from the ED before, but I just did.        The OP/ED aren't exactly anything special, but they're pretty pleasant.<br>Fitting for the show really: it's nothing outstanding but it makes me smile every week and that's honestly enough.</br>  <br><br><br><br> Official pairings </br></br></br></br>  <br>HONEY CUMMU</br>    <br>Kek.</br>  <br>There was a glutton one right?<br><br><br>Damn I can't wait for the Aoi chapter to get animated. Her Face when using that Geass was pure win.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're all labelled with their sin in the episode, part of the reason this segment is taking longer than the others, the signs don't want to play nice.</br>  <br>At least going by the manga chapter that segment was from, I'm surprised that the clones didn't get into much trouble when they actually correspond to each of the deadly sins.<br><br>I find it both disturbing and hot.</br></br></br>  <br> I find it both disturbing and hot. <br>That's the best feeling. Like they can pull themselves together in public, but as soon as they're home, they're wild.</br></br>      <br><br>doujin when?</br></br>  Subs when?  <br>Around 65 lines left, then an edit pass and watching to make sure nothing looks awful.

Maybe with the tie being loose and the top few buttons of her shirt undone as if she had just gotten home from work and was preparing to relax.

Requesting Momo in a gym uniform, optionally sitting on a hand-, foot- or volleyball like in the reference or using her shirt to wipe away her sweat, accidentally showing off her midriff (it'd be wonderful if it were a tiny bit toned). Other ideas are welcome too, of course! Please and thank you.  Requesting Miia enjoying some relaxed lounging in one of these amazing things.<br>http://i.imgur.com/gkJNoN7.jpg<br> Or otherwise asking for help getting out of one. </br></br>  I'd like to request my Noir<br><br>Anything is fine, but perhaps seeing her in summery wear or wearing oversized clothing, semi-lewd or otherwise.<br><br>Or maybe dressed in Tamamo's clothes/Granberia's armor, of MGQ fame.<br>Ref:http://imgur.com/dUZuWZ7<br><br>Have a good weekend, either way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it a boy or a girl</br>  <br>It doesn't matter so long as it's cute</br>  Requesting Sakuya cosplaying as Revolver Ocelot, looking smug would be preferable.

Requesting my beloved Goddess Satsuki Kiryuuin, something sci-fi / post-apocalyptic themed would be nice, thanks for consideration.  Okay, so we know that they're both shit but who's the bigger offender?<br><br>Also, post seiyuus who are superior while you're at it.</br></br>   Hana kana  <br> shit  <br>Yeah, she's mainstream as fuck but damn she really got the talent. See her performance in The Garden of Words and you'll realize that she's not that really bad. <br><br>Amalia Sora on the other hand is a different story. Her performance in Aldnoah Zero and Akame Ga Kill is just inconsistent. I feel like her Hime voice fits her much better. It's like a lower pitched voice of Yui Horie's. She's just being pushed around for roles that doesn't really suit her voice (as of now). Give her some time to be more versatile and she'll turn out fine. It's just that her talent agency is pushing her around too much without giving her enough time to adjust.</br></br></br></br>  <br> we <br>Fuck off.<br><br> post seiyuus who are superior while you're at it <br>You first, let's see how great your taste is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish she got more roles like this.</br>  HanaKana had to work hard to gain her popularity while Amamiya is just Sony's puppet.  <br>left &gt; right</br>  <br> hanakana <br> shit <br>Please don't bring your subjective opinion here, hanakana is famous for a reason</br></br></br>  <br> hanakana is famous for a reason <br>Yeah, because so many people like cutesy voice, which is fine in moderation but that's the only voice she ever use.</br></br>  <br> HanaKana had to work hard <br>And you think other seiyuu (not talking about Sora) don't work as hard as her? She got lucky she voiced popular/likable characters early in her career and when Osawa saw they can milk the fuck out of her they just kept the ball rolling.</br></br>  Hanakana just need more crazy roles, her usual "cute" castings are shit.  <br>I was just comparing the 2 of them and you suddenly feel the need to get all defensive? Fucking Aoifags are getting more ridiculous these days.</br>  <br>KanaHana is actually talented and her voice is pleasant to listen to. Amamiya ranges from okay to makes me want to rip my fucking ears out.</br>  <br>Sawashiro is the best.</br>  <br>Mah nigga. She's always a treat to listen to.</br>  <br>You're praising HanaKana just because you think she worked hard when her workrate was average before she became popular.</br>  <br> that's the only voice she ever use <br>What about Rize?<br>What about Akane?<br>What about the love interest from Kotonoha no Niwa?</br></br></br></br>  <br> her workrate was average before she became popular <br>Stop lying and kindly fuck off. <br><br>Seiyuu with the most annoying fans on /a/:<br>1. Yuuki Aoi<br>2. Sakura Ayane</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Akane sounds the same as her usual roles though. Didn't watch the other 2 so I can't say anything about them.</br>  <br> Stop lying and kindly fuck off.  <br>Prove it asshole. Show me how she worked hard during her early career instead of talking out of your ass.</br></br>  Sawashiro and Chiwa Saito are my favorites in terms of talent, but I do love HanaKana the most.  <br>Can you prove otherwise? No. <br><br>One can only conclude that she worked hard because she had so many roles. Can't be lazy and still do that many work.</br></br></br>  <br>  HanaKana <br>  shit <br>Do you even Renai Circulation?</br></br></br>  any canadabros out there, see if you can meet up with tyrant-chan in 2 weeks if you want  <br>Gentlemen, I present to you: a deaf person</br>  <br>I do<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4l7<wbr>n71K0R7o</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Wow this thread really turns to shit fast.<br><br><br><br>I'll hopefully meet her, will be in Canada for a month or so.</br></br></br></br>  <br> thinks Akane sounds different from the usual HanaKana roles <br> call other people deaf <br><br>There's only one deaf faggot here and it's certainly you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, Kana Hana is so beautiful. She doesn't look like your average Japanese girl. She doesn't have that "round face" that makes so many Asian girls ugly.</br>  <br> Can you prove otherwise? <br>Yes.<br><br>https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%8<wbr>A%B1%E6%BE%A4%E9%A6%99%E8%8F%9C<br><br>See her roles for anime, game, and drama CD pre 2008 and count how many they were. Not so many, huh? Also count the number of radio shows pre 2008. One can only conclude that her workrate is the same as the average young seiyuu and she was lucky because she voiced likable and popular girls in her early career.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>   post superiors seiyuus <br><br>I happen to be an expert on this subject. A superior seiyuu all around.</br></br>  <br>Trips confirmed, miyukichi best seiyuu</br>  <br> she was only lucky <br>Is every Aoifag as bitter as this faggot?</br></br>  <br>Is every HanaKanafag as delusional as this faggot?</br>  <br>Taneda has a beautiful voice, but who is the absolute best of the best?</br>  <br><br>Yes to both questions.</br></br>  <br>you can tell it's her, yes.<br><br>But you also can tell Magneto is fuckin Ian McKellen, still it's different from his Gandalf.<br><br>So does she voice act in a different style in that role than in some below average harem shit? Yes she does and it's audible.<br>She has a range. Not a range as others might have, but also not as small as some might think.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She was lucky because she has a voice like that. no matter what role she did in her early career sooner or later someone's gonna recognize her and put her in a good show/role.</br>  <br>My personal favorite is Ayaya and Yukina(I think this is her go to voice).<br><br>Rory sounds very sexy though.</br></br></br>  <br>Not only average, many of the insanely popular seiyuu started off with those one-off gigs and years of voicing "Girl C" and "Boy in convenience store"<br><br>Without luck, they won't get big. Without any talent whatsoever they won't stay big.</br></br></br>  <br>You just don't get it. She wouldn't be this popular if she voiced shit characters like Haruna, Kirino, Mikono, etc. When you're a young seiyuu you pray to the voice gods that you get roles that are likable or popular so you can ride on the popularity of the characters you voiced and when everyone notices you voice "best" girls then you can voice shit characters and no one would care, the fans will eat up your shit. Voicing popular and likable characters is the key to becoming popular.</br>  <br> lucky people can't be hardworking <br><br>Again, how can she be lazy and still do so many roles? Almost everyone needs a lucky break (i.e popular roles) to kickstart their career to a higher level but if she didn't work hard there's no way she can build on that initial popularity to be as popular as she is today. <br><br>You just sound like a bitter retard who can't accept Hanakana's popularity.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I prefer to Mousou Express</br>  <br> how can she be lazy <br>She's not. Where in my post did I imply she was lazy? I said her workrate is average just like most seiyuu and it's nothing to brag about, retard.</br></br>  I want to hold hands with Aoi!  Post music.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gmy<wbr>oRq-lYps</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ODe<wbr>NAOifss0</wbr>  [ ]<br>http://en.musicplayon.com/play?v=96<wbr>1626</wbr></br></br></br>  <br> workrate is average because she didn't get many roles early in her career <br>Seems like you're the one talking out of your ass. There's now way she can have many roles as some newbie. What matters is what she did once she got a lucky break and everything seems to indicate her as hardworking based on how many works she did every season.<br><br>Faggot like you can't even counter what I said in my post. You seems to be very angry about the fact that some people won the genetic lottery and they can build on that by working hard, yes, working hard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>All seiyuu who are serious about it work hard. She got a break because of talent and luck.</br>  Reminder among her major roles since 2014, Sora Amamiya only have 2 roles that did not involve Sony Music in the production committee of those anime.  <br> implying Amamiya Sora works hard </br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Jxy<wbr>IV9si5eg</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YGg<wbr>ZS_uP_0k</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zY_<wbr>Tp7QLHyg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, retard.</br>   there are people on /a/ right now who like this slut   <br>Those fucking  Sonyggers .</br>   Aoifags vs KanaHanafags <br>It will never end</br>  <br>I'm not even a KanaHanafag and I don't think she is as bad as what Aoifags want people to believe. Though her same voice syndrome can really get irritating sometimes. Same with Yuuki Aoi and her grating stock voice.</br>  Tanechan is 100x better than Amamiya Sora and 2x better than Hanazawa Kana.  <br> Seems like you're the one talking out of your ass <br>You're accusing me of talking out of my ass when you're the one who hasn't provided a lick of evidence as to why she's hard working. Tell me anon, what makes her hard working? Show me concrete examples and not some stupid logic you formulated in your head.</br></br>  <br>She looks dirty.<br><br>I like that.</br></br></br>  <br>According to this anon, yes. <br><br> everything seems to indicate her as hardworking based on how many works she did every season <br>So Sora worked harder than HanaKana because she had more roles in her starting career?</br></br></br></br>  Superior Seiyuu flying through  Can Hanazawa do this?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mMZ<wbr>AMJr_DSc</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>based as fuck</br>  <br> male <br>GTFO</br></br>  <br>Future Nakahara Mai 2.0</br>  Convulted logic - the thread<br><br>Make room for best dork</br></br>  <br>I refuse to believe there's a replacement for Nakahara.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8R8<wbr>sSkDQSEM</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=E9E<wbr>dBLzPqBY</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=e6Q<wbr>RMqJreTE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Amamiya Sora was being supported from the very beginning. How did her first audition happen? Oh, Sawashiro brought her there. Her first agency? Music Ray'n, a subsidiary of Sony Japan. Her first lead roles rained on her in the same year, only 2 years after her debut. Even Sugita doesn't have that kind of jumpstart and he's the best seiyuu in the entire industry. Hell even Kaji Yuki had to wait 4 years until he got a lead role.<br><br>Meanwhile HanaKana began acting when she was around 4- 5 years old. She basically went Toroko route to stardom. Auditioned and got every role she can get no matter how minor they were while also graduating from uni. Her agency? Office Osawa. A studio with no influence. Her first lead roles weren't exactly loveable either. Nadeko is a basebreaker, Mikan is Mikan and Suou is from that second season almost everyone wished to forget it exists.</br></br></br>  Was listening to old programs of プチミレディオ yesterday.<br>One of the listeners asked them about their main inspirations as a seiyuu, or something along those lines.<br>Being an Aoifag I knew about Aoi's relationship with Sawashiro from long ago, but I had no idea Taketatsu respected Hocchan so much.<br>Hearing her talk about it was a bit moving to be honest.</br></br></br>  I just want it on the record that you, OP, are shit.  <br> Her agency? Office Osawa. A studio with no influence. <br>Nah, Osawa has quite a few popular seiyuu as well. Before HanaKana their primary cashcow was Mamiko Noto.</br></br>  <br> No liking Sugita <br>JUST</br></br>  <br>Is Sugita the Brendan Fraser of seiyuu?</br>  <br>She's so skinny, she's probably one of the few seiyuu who look better with clothes ON than off.<br><br>Seiyuu-wise, she's okay when she's not playing Chu2 all the time.</br></br></br>  <br>Well many anons seems to hate sora a lot more lately. I just wish to rape the both of them.</br>  I love Kayanon.    I love Saorin  <br>It has no influence. If Sony is Barcelona then these guys are FC Porto.</br>  <br> implying Sora, Mikan, Kuu-chan, and Kobato aren't likable <br> implying Renai Circulation did not put HanaKana on the seiyuu map </br></br>  This isn't anime  <br>You're not anime</br>  Hayami Saori is the current 'it' girl on seiyuu business right now.  <br>Seiyuu is everything anime.</br>  <br><br>She's really damned good</br></br>  <br>You don't know that</br>  <br><br>Matsuoka pls</br></br>  <br>Perfect voice, acting, and singing. Should've dominated every season since a few years ago.<br>Too bad she rose to prominence right around Hanazawa's reign of terror.</br></br>  <br> now </br>  <br>How can you be anime if you're real?</br>  <br>Sketchbook is kinda obscure, Mikan is from To-Love-Ru, Kuu-chan and Kobato serve to a certain niche but they're not leads anyway. Renai Circulation helped her because she was so good at it. Her role didn't come with that guarantee. Even now people either hate Nadeko or love her. Do the calculation which one would net in more fans/popularity in a normal distribution? She was just that good to overcome that.<br><br>She had to be good to get where she is while Amamiya Sora got "blessed"-means "Sony called the studio" in Japanese- with certain hit roles. Akame, Elizabeth, Asshime. These are not usually roles you see a 2nd year seiyuu performing. One might be, but all three at the same year? It's not that Amamiya Sora is talentless-she's good- but she get's places she had no chance of getting without Sony pulling strings.</br></br></br>  <br>I wish I had gone to Otakon last year when she was a guest. Apparently, some random confag had the gall to ask if she was a fujoshi.</br>  <br>I like Sony Music's previous gorioshi, Tomatsu more than Amamiya.<br>She's actually a great seiyuu.</br></br>  <br> okay <br>I think she's great seiyuu.</br></br>  <br>Don't forget, she has Im@s Million Live in her pocket too. With the way Bamco is pushing ML and Cinderella Girls, it's guaranteed money for her, and inevitably another anime for ML will come.</br>  <br>During Otakon Hayamin also said she is friends with a seiyuu who is a fujoshi.<br>Gee, I wonder who that is.</br></br>  <br>She and her compatriots Asakura and Natsukawa already hijacked the imas movie.<br>Their character got featured prominently and the actual main trio of million live didn't appear at all.</br></br>  <br><br>Reminder that Sora Amamiya lead roles since 2014-2015 are 14 roles (sequel counted as one) with 10 main girl roles, two 2nd girls, and 2 important girls, also she will be in two new Sony/Aniplex movie too as one of main characters in both movie. Which seiyuu do you think ever jump that much and fast before?<br><br><br>All Trysail are in ML too, A-1 is working in all of the im@s so far so Sony is definitely part of production comittee</br></br></br></br></br>  http://www.liheliso.org/2014/09/01/<wbr>otakon-2014-hayami-saori-qa-panel/<br><br>Some lovelivefags ruin it though with love live question</br></br></wbr>  <br>If they were just idolshit wota, they could've at least asked her about Cinderella Girls. How do you ask someone a question about a franchise unrelated to them in any way?</br>  <br>Her talk with Ozawa Ari in Nozaki-kun radio is really fun. That radio also make me become an Ozawa fans.</br>  <br> Sketchbook is kinda obscure <br>That was a lead role no matter how obscure it is and Sora was likable.<br><br> Mikan is from To-Love-Ru <br>What does that even imply? Mikan is one of the most popular girls in TLR. She's in the top polls of favorite characters in the manga. She is one of the girls who get consistent merchandise.<br><br> Kuu-chan and Kobato serve to a certain niche but they're not leads anyway <br>Kuu-chan is still likable and Kobato not a lead in the anime called "Kobato," what?<br><br> Renai Circulation helped her because she was so good at it. <br>No, just no. Have you heard her character songs? They're not actually good. Renai Circulation is actually a good song and it helped boost her career.<br><br> Even now people either hate Nadeko or love her. <br>Having haters doesn't matter. Nadeko is still one of the most popular girls in Monogatari and she still consistently gets merchandise.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She worked several times in Sunrise anime</br>  <br> LLtards in charge of not being obnoxious <br>Props to Hayamin to give the best answer possible, though.</br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit, Not only her voice, her look also a bit similar with Nakahara Mai</br></br>  <br>Wrong quotes </br>  <br>Here is one.</br>  <br> lead roles <br>major roles</br></br>  <br><br> AniRevo <br><br>If it wasn't on the opposite side of the country.

Her personality is fun too.</br>  <br>She is really underated and /a/ don't know her</br>  <br>I really like her voice and she also looks really cute.<br>Kinda like Kayanon's younger sister.<br>Also I was curious of what how bad her remarks were that forced the radio producers to censor her quite a much.</br></br></br>  <br> censor her quite a much <br>Do you have any links for such radio shows?</br></br>    <br>Can't find it. Even the official twitter account of the show also doesn't have any link on it.<br>Maybe someone uploaded it on Nico/Bilibili, haven't really bothered to check there.</br></br>  <br>Do you at least know the name of the radio show?</br>  <br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm267<wbr>07903</wbr></br>  <br>https://twitter.com/ozanari1134</br>  <br> Fucking Aoifags are getting more ridiculous these days. <br> these days <br>They were always cancer, spamming their "3D LOLI" in every thread.

Both of them so cute together. <br>You can find it on youtube. it almost have all episode. I can't wait for new episode tonight.</br></br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br>Seems like he meant Ozanari also.</br>  <br> Naganawa Maria <br>Why is her face looking fat there?</br></br>  Your thoughts on Takeuchi? P-kun really isn't enough to see if he has range to go with his timbre.  <br>Look fine to me, but maybe she's starting eating properly. She's not eating properly until Ari suggest her to.</br>  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh<wbr>WF9o4VLUSvP4UUtU2Owug<br>this channel has pretty good seiyuu radio collection, including Ozawa Ari's.</br></wbr>  Best young male seiyuu here  <br>Anyone who watched YuYuYu should know her.

If you were going to exploit a new talent and make her reliant on you alone, you wouldn't set her up with a guaranteed multi-seasonal work gig, would you? It would be better to keep her dependent on you from show to show, and she's probably going to be some naive 16 year old who doesn't know how to properly negotiate.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aAi<wbr>vNMYAhvs</wbr>  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VDK<wbr>b0mzAvH4</wbr>  [ ]    <br><br>Hanakana actually has talent, so her.</br></br>  <br>Same here, but it doesn't mean she would be my oneesan. I'm still older than her.</br>  <br>I was really surpised how genki she is in real life. Kaleido Star's web radio is pure gold with her and IRL Yamada. <br><br><br>They do that too, but their actual occupation is announcer (ie. reading news, acting as a neutral MC at events etc). 90% of popular anime events have one of the two as their MC thanks to their reputation as lovers of anime. <br>Washizaki Takeshi is a guy who wanted to be a musician (sings and playes guitar) and likes anime.

People like Marina and Chiwa are doing good however, sadly Kobayashi and Mamiko isn't getting as much roles as they used to. They are still active with Gangsta and MonMuse this season but they're not in as much shows as I would want them to be in.<br><br>And yeah, Ueda is struggling on by. With the end of UBW and her only role (I think) this season is Bikini Warriors, its worrying times for her. I guess she can branch out now, I believe she has done some movie dubbing before so she has that.</br></br></br>  <br> more idol-like talents <br>Being mad that your favourites can't even sing? My first preferred seiyuu was Hayashibara Megumi and she could sing as well as voicing. If your favs went out of business because they could only speak, then it's the better for everyone.</br></br>  Queen of my heart.  <br> her only role (I think) this season is Bikini Warriors <br><br>Prisma Illya 2wei Herz</br></br></br>    <br> Actors going out of business cause they can only act. <br><br>wat.<br><br>I get what you mean with the market wanting the idol glamour with seiyuus but geez, that was a bad argument.

Still though, she is lucky that she has Rin. I think that is the onlly thing keeping her relevant nowadays,</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Being an idol has nothing to do with singing ability. If your favs are in business because their biggest selling point is being a 3DPD promotion tool, then you should leave.</br>  <br> I think that is the onlly thing keeping her relevant nowadays </br>  I'll just post this here.  <br>JUST</br>  <br> seiyuu threads complain about idol seiyuu and gorioshi bullshit invading the industry over actual talent <br> shit on someone with actual range and skill just because she's old and wrinkled <br><br>You guys really aren't so different than the koebuta, admit it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I get what you mean with the market wanting the idol glamour with seiyuus but geez <br>I'm not saying that though. Actors generally should be able to sing, like stage actors learn to sing for a start. A VA that can sing well enough to live off of that is automatically better than one who can't use their voice well enough to sing a fucking song. It's also better for them, since they can release albums when they don't get much roles. If your precious VA disappeared than you can only blame her. <br><br>Also, Hayamin is one of my biggest favourites but she's doing well because she can act well, sing well, and generally marketable because she can stand on more than one leg.</br></br></br></br>  <br> actual range and skill <br><br>I love Kugyuu and all, but come on, she only has two voices: tsundere and her boy voice for Alphonse.</br></br></br>  <br>Amamiya gets a pass because she's cute.

I remember there were people from Taiwan and Hong Kong at the VA event for Working S2.</br>  <br>That's how it works, unfortunately. Just hope for the best and if an opportunity comes up and they go to a specific one, fly out to it and attend. Chances of them coming to a big US con like AX increase if there's a fairly recent or recently licensed anime that studio is pushing a localized release for (Aniplex for Fate and KLK, PonyCanyon for Yuki Yuna).</br>  <br>too bad she is not in her prime anymore.</br>  <br><br>I'll keep an eye on that then</br></br>   Kugyu <br> no range <br> Aoi Yuuki <br> pillow seiyuu <br>Funny thread, but it reeks of ignorance.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Trips confirm.<br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oB<wbr>hlM0UpHLU</wbr>  [ ] </br></br>  <br>I wonder who's behind this post.</br>  <br>  Ayane Sakura has none of those.  <br>;_;</br></br>  <br>She's only 21 so her agency/family probably want to protect her from the industry's madness until she's a little older. She'll get a blog in a few years.</br>  <br>Hopefully. I'd die for an Ayane Sakura twitter. I bet she'd tweet about the most hilarious things.</br>  Oh my<br>I've actually found her address</br>  <br>What is so crazy about having a blog? Aoi Yuuki has been blogging and answering to fan-mail since she was 16.</br>  <br>I was watching the 2014 Animelo where she sang a few solo songs. She seemed really sad and withdrawn. She didn't look like she had an once of fun in her body during it. Unless that's just apart of her Gothic loli act.</br>  <br> What is so crazy about having a blog? <br>It's not so much having a blog as the fanbase swarming around it. Maybe she wants to keep her private life and work more separate than other people. Maybe something happened behind the scenes that made management cautious.<br><br>Or maybe she isn't too interested in the social media.<br><br><br>It depends on the event but she's usually energetic/fun-loving, so she was probably having a bad day/didn't want to be there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://myanimelist.net/people/34/Yu<wbr>u_Kobayashi<br>thread</br></wbr>  <br> she was probably having a bad day/didn't want to be there. <br>From what I heard recently it seems to be constant. I feel so sad for her. What the fuck even happened? Apart from getting shit roles and being sidelined.</br></br>  <br>It could be any number of things. Death in her family, break-up with a boyfriend, argument with friends/colleagues, or just apathy/loss of interest. <br><br>But I have the feeling that some VAs sort of lose interest in their work as they reach their 30s and beyond, like it's not so enjoyable anymore. Fans gravitate towards the new faces because they're younger and fresher, and there's only so much attention left to spare for the old crowd. It's pitiful how hard Yukari Tamura tries to stay relevant (and she's depressed as fuck too if her tweets are any indication), no one remembers Yui Horie, and Fumiko Orikasa is waiting in vain for the Bleach anime to come back. They're not supposed to complain and they have to show that they care, but that's probably what's causing her the most stress, pretending to be enjoying herself when she isn't. Eventually they give up.</br></br></br>  <br> no one remembers Yui Horie, <br>I don't think this is true at all.</br></br>  <br>Not in Japan they don't. She still has a dedicated circle of followers, hell everyone does, but whenever she tries to reenter mainstream attention the reception is cruel.<br><br> recent PV for her song <br> she's dancing and singing in an idol costume (?) <br> most of the comments say she's old, used goods, trying too hard, make-up can't hide age, etc </br></br></br></br></br>  I wonder what's going on with KitaEri. Her role in SB69 was given to another seiyuu.  <br>From what I heard she didn't lose interest, but the industry doesn't care about her that much anymore, and it makes her deppressed. I wish a new Madoka would start already, no matter how shitty, at least she wiould get her role. <br>It feels so shit to fall in love with her voice when it's too late.</br></br>  There's literally nothing wrong with HanaKana.  <br> Her role <br>You mean her singing Plasmagica songs? The characters don't have voices in the game. And we don't know jack shit why they casted someone else in the anime. Maybe she didn't want to voice another stupid bitch.</br></br>  <br> I wish a new Madoka would start already <br>They ought to make a Blue Exorcist: Brotherhood because that show sold like hotcakes and Izumo's arc was great in the manga. Also Nobuhiko Okamoto's favorite character is Izumo. They could make it work.<br><br>It would also be worth watching Working 3's VA events, because she had a lot of fun in the events they held for previous seasons.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>KitaEri is a prime target for cyberbullying. Awful otaku spam "pillow" and "slut" and I don't think she ever recovered entirely from the Kokoro Connect incident either. IIRC she said she lost a great place for socializing when she had to close her Twitter account.</br></br></br>   you will never have a threesome with Nana, Yukarin and Hocchan   <br> Maybe she didn't want to voice another stupid bitch <br>But that is what KitaEri does best.</br></br>  <br>I don't want to be either of them. Maybe Nana.</br>  <br>I feel unnaturally attracted to Yukarin for whatever reason. Would fuck in a heartbeat.<br>Nana I respect too much for wanting anything lewd with her.</br></br>  <br>Well, the only reason I would be Nana is to fuck Yukarin until she's broken.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>brothers</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shiho isn't part of the main trio in ML; unless Sony forces the staff to give her a starring role.</br>  <br>Well, Ami Koshimizu was the lead in KLK but they used ancient seiyuu (plus TaMako) there.</br>  Any newer seiyuu that likely got to where she is through talent alone?  <br>Misaki Kuno.</br>  <br>Aya Suzaki</br>  Remember when she took over the industry for one season then got dropped for Hana boring Kana again?<br><br>Sad times.</br></br>  <br>This Aoi's season.<br>They alternate their reign, it's Aoi's turn now.</br></br>  Pretty good episode last night. Really like it when Ari always teasing Maria. Look like they will celebrating Maria's birthday in next episode.  Anyone like Mamiko Noto?  <br>TEH RIE was the same case when she was typecasted as that. Lacus and Chii both sounded annoying... But then Suigintou happened.</br>    <br>He's probably my favourite younger main male protagonist voice dude.<br><br><br>Hiromi Igarashi was Horie's fan club. She was a pretty big deal back in the day, although Yukinko is into a lot of the same kind of stuff as Ayachi (and more)<br><br><br>They're both old.<br><br><br>It's like you didn't watch the trainwreck that was the im@s movie at all<br><br><br>He's always going to be cast that way but he's a decent actor in the Nippon Roudoku Academy segments. I mean the highlights of those are always Reina Ueda though, and despite listening to Rie Takahashi in those for over a year I'm still surprised how good she is in Sore ga Seiyuu and Gakkou Gurashi.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's adorable. Truly an angel.<br><br> That terrible feeling she'll one day inevitably grow old and pass away. </br></br></br>  <br>The last new role I just saw KitaEri get is some random fuck Korean developed mobage with the usual mobage casting. (eg. obligatory Ai Kakuma)<br><br>Which is especially bizarre given <br>(just as a reminder, Sumipe stayed in the anime and they have regularly been put together from sharing the same label in shows like Papakiki and Cross Ange)<br><br>Also noteworthy is that Yurika Kubo is doing about the same voice as in Love Live in this game except it doesn't sound like total amateur shit anymore.<br><br><br>Aya Suzaki is only 10 months younger than Koshimizu actually, she just took a long time to break into the industry. (university+3 years as an OL before getting into an agency+2 years to her breakout roles)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://idolmaster-music.tumblr.com/<wbr>post/51164340715/song-venus-syndrom<wbr>e-artist-minami-nitta-cv<br>Suzaki a best; outsings Uesaka Sumire in the Love Laika song.</br></wbr></wbr></br>    <br>what is that?</br>  Comments about Amamiya's talent level aside, Try Sail sounds fucking terrible as a unit.  <br>I'd love to go to lunch with the two of them.<br>I wouldn't understand a word. I just want to hear the two of them talk.</br></br>    <br>But Trysail has the miracle of the world named Mocho.</br>  <br>Oh god, Saber's VA has strange bone structure. And that's not NotoMami's best side either. What was the photographer thinking?</br>  <br> being a retard who will believe every single rumor <br><br>Not saying she's a virgin but damn you're a giant faggot. Your "pure" seiyuufu probably sucked hundreds more dicks than her.</br></br></br>  I love this meme where people pretend shit seiyuus like Yuuki Aoi, Sawashiro Miyuki, Kobayashi Yuu, Hanazawa Kana and Sugita are actually good.    <br> people shit on VAs for having no range <br> love Sugita <br> "but Sugita has no range" <br> "yeah but he's funny" <br>There you are folks, skill level doesn't matter as long as you're a cool guy.<br><br>People need to fuck off with the Sawashiro circlejerking too. They argue she has range and submit Baby Beel from Beelzebub as one example. Great, so she can make squeaky baby noises. As if 90% of the other VAs couldn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hanazawa Kana  <br><br>She's actually really good though. The rest of your list isn't wrong.</br></br></br>   seiyuu thread <br> no one ever mentions kana asumi <br><br>Bit of samevoice going on sometimes but it does things to my heart  and dick </br></br></br>  <br> no one ever mentions kana asumi <br>Lurk more.</br></br>  <br>Asumi Kana is actually a good fit for seiyuu threads. She's not overrated or underrated around here.</br>    <br>Personally, I really hate this new trend of how people treat seiyuu. You have to look like a model, and fuck off with your range, we want you in all of the same cheap and easy to do roles. It's almost like people don't want voice actors anymore, they want idols who do voices. It doesn't seem like a world where someone like Akira Kamiya, Masako Nozawa, or Nobuyuki Hiyama would actually be picked for the role of main characters any more. They're all pretty talented, but they aren't exactly the most attractive people, they just look like regular guys.<br><br>It seems like being a voice actor in the 90s and going back was probably the best time to do it. You get your chance to stretch out your legs, show what actual telent you have and come back for a role every now and then.<br><br>But you know what, it's probably because I'm close to 30, and all of my favorite voice actors are of the older generation, and it kind of pains me to see the relatively younger 30-40 aged voice actors, especially women get shit upon for just being that age. I don't know what happened to Rie, but it makes me feel really bad if she doesn't look great, she's pretty much washed up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sugita has plenty of range, what kind of rugs are you on?</br>  <br> skill level doesn't matter as long as you're a cool guy <br>That's not even it. There are plenty of seiyuu who are funny and interesting. It's just that majority of the anons here are ignorant and they rely on someone else spoon-feeding them (ie. translated shows of Tokyo Encounter, English seiyuu blogs).<br><br> People need to fuck off with the Sawashiro circlejerking too. <br>It's really annoying how hypocritical they are. Also, her voice isn't even unique. See: <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Tn1<wbr>Az4OdZ20</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The saddest thing would be Nana losing relevance.<br><br>I mean, generally speaking the other seiyuus have stuff outside of their careers to look forward to. What does Nana have if she is no longer popular?</br></br>  <br><br>Nana's a very successful musician. I think she's further away from working retail once her popularity dips compared to your average voice actress.</br></br>  <br>Why are you so narrow minded? Do you know how much a seiyuu gets paid voicing in an anime? Not much. You want them to go back to flipping burgers on their free time because seiyuu pay can't let you live a normal life? You should be grateful the industry changed because now these seiyuu don't only voice act but they have different jobs to support them.</br>  <br>The only real difference is that voice actors need to clean themselves up and look presentable now instead of look like they were dragged in off the street because back then no attention was paid to it<br><br>And if you catch the odd making-of piece, you see everyone is still mostly just normal looking people</br></br></br>  <br>What are you talking about, Nana is very successful and popular singer, no seiyuu ever reached that kind of popularity as singer. She is more relevant singer than seiyuu not to mention King Records always create so many anime every year, her career is guaranteed by them.</br>  Post lewd seiyuu you fucks  <br>She will be fine.<br>His fans are very dedicated and she doesn't sells as an idol but as a musician, a job in which age is not very important.<br><br><br>You are thinking of idol seiyuu, they are the ones that have to have a perfect image.<br>Most old seiyuu are still relevant, but they are more expensive and have other jobs which makes them busy.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Yu Kobayashi 2.0   <br> Geek <br> those grody armpits <br> Pippi Longstockings <br>Her body and looks aren't bad but not sure if want</br></br></br></br>   Hanakana as first post for seiyuu thread <br>Gee, and I wonder why people always ask why these threads go to shit</br>  <br>Name me a seiyuu and I will make a seiyuu thread with the one you recommended next time.</br>  <br> dat wink <br><br><br>Should I post that Maaya pic?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuuki Aoi.</br>  <br>Kitamura Eri</br>  <br>Now that's an opinion I can get behind.</br>  <br> They're popular so they're shit <br> we <br><br>Choke on a dick and die you fucking faggot</br></br></br></br>  <br>Alright, I'll make a seiyuu thread with Ao-chan next time.<br><br><br>Sorry anon, maybe next time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sachika Misawa or Emi Nitta.</br>  <br>Please no. Aoifags are retarded and cancerous.</br>  <br><br>Oh fuck off, VA threads are made with Aoi in the OP all the fucking time. Even if they don't have her in the OP she gets spammed like no tomorrow anyways.<br><br>Give it to someone like SatoRina or OnoD for a change.

Sadly, Eri just got caught in the crossfire, she was no way involved with the bullying incident but anons had to release their anger on something.</br></br>  i'm stupid so it just hit me recently she's genetically engineered by her agency to be yukarin 2.0.  <br>It makes so no sense on so many levels, you faggots should be killed for real.

What would you do to show her that either her physiological differences from a human woman either don't matter to you, or are minor obstacles that can easily be overcome with a little creativity?<br><br>I want to hear your ideas.<br><br> One thing I'd do for Miia is take her dancing. I'd put in the effort (probably learning it without her knowing so I could surprise her) to research and learn dancing techniques for human and Lamia partners, and then give her basic lessons. Miia not only strikes me as someone who'd find dancing romantic, but knowing she could do something that required feet just as well as an human woman could would probably make her feel very special. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Darling <br> Hubby <br> Master <br> Husband <br> Honey <br>One of those has to be it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Kurusu Kimihito.</br>  <br><br>Kimohito Kurusu, but even Smith acknowledges it's just easier to call him "Darling" since she's heard it so much.</br></br>  <br>Give that bitch a blanket.<br><br>MGs love blankets.</br></br></br>  <br>Darling is one of the better harem protags mind you, he's cool in my book.

On the other hand, I think I paid about $30 local for a twin CD set of Human Seed Destiny soundtrack. But that was a few years back.<br><br>If we break the price down by number of songs though, 32 songs, works out to about $3.50 each.

And Chitoge.</br></br>  It's like on Baka-Test, best girl never wins.  <br>Shittoge is not bad, is just that everyone is better  except for Onodera she is Haruna Sairenji tier of shittiness.  </br>   Marika is kill <br>Komi doesn't have the guts.</br>  <br> it was all a lie <br> again </br></br>  <br>WAX<br>THAT<br>ASS</br></br></br>  <br>  Marika is killed <br>  subplot that goes SOMEWHERE <br>Im tired of this bait to make people still caring about this shit</br></br></br>  <br>See you next week!</br>   mfw this animated in january <br>Who will voice Yui?</br>  <br>Not this time anon, i've finally dropped this shit, i only come here to have a summary of the chapter</br>  <br>Marika either win or die. The former is never happening.</br>  <br> dropped <br> still cares about summary </br></br>    <br>This is like KNIM all over again, you can't drop it no matter how hard you try, you can only find rest on death.</br>  <br>Shut up, i want to leave this hell even though i know only the death can known peace from this</br>    Translation fucking when?!    My heart is in very much pain because of what they will make happen to Marika.  <br>Tomorrow or the day after, as always.</br>  <br>She is the promise girl sorry. It is needed</br>  <br>I know that feel bro</br>   worst girl dying <br> Tsugumi's birthday today <br>What a time to be alive</br></br>  <br>It would be quite funny if she happens to be the promise girl. It would make even better the moment when Raku rejects her.</br>  I want Nisekoi to pull a SZS.  <br>Nop, She will live and die farway like a cat, and after Raku chose Chitoge, All will know, the promise girl is Marika.<br><br>Marika naver said 'cos she don't wanna a Nisekoi from Raku <br><br>Marika&gt;All</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Y-san in full damage control mode </br>  <br>Nice  fanfiction .</br>  <br>You mean "reveal" that she's dying, have Raku formally reject her, and then reveal that she's going to be fine after all?</br>  <br>But they make it look like she will die and they show her in pain with her sickness and with her feelings. This is a bad time for Marika and I hate this.</br>  <br>Dude, She will die I Like Marika too much, SHe will be the climax, More climax then RakuXChitoge or RakuXOnodera</br>  <br>But they will end Raku and Chitoge and leave Marika a lone and sick and sad. I say fuck this manga for this.</br>  <br> Who will voice Yui? <br>Satomi Sato, hopefully.</br></br>  <br>It is sad... but on life have something more sad then your true love die and you lose it when u fallinlove? Raku will fall in pain, and I WILL LOVE IT</br>  <br>Yeah it would be better if onodera dies and not marika :(</br>  <br>I've said this a million times before, but...It's Ichigo 100% all over again.</br>  <br>But I do not want Raku to be in pain because Marika would hate that also. She just can not win in any way because she want Raku happiness but she can not get her own with him to. Its author's fault really more then Raku.</br>  Y-san on suicide watch.  <br>But then Onodera would win.</br>  <br>Nah, Nishino did a lot for the main character...<br>And Onodera NOTHING!</br></br>  <br>Kek.Dat Ie.</br>  Y-SAN <br>R.I.P<br>;_;</br></br>  <br>Best girl right here.<br>How can one girl be so best?</br></br>  Did everyone get their $200 14 inch Gorilla figure?  <br>  that lustful look in her eyes <br>Jesus fucking Christ</br></br>  <br>SLUT<br>L<br>U<br>T</br></br></br></br>  <br> handholding  <br>L-lewd</br></br>  <br>I think Nisekoi is at it's end game. Komi killed off Yui, he's now killing off Marika, and Raku is starting to realize his feelings for Chitoge.<br><br>It's really ending you guys.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck that's hot.  Second  best girl.</br>  glad i forgot about this since it was removed from batoto and i never check red hawk site<br><br>so just erase that shit from your markers and http bar and you'll be good to go<br><br>in the worst case just ignore the threads until something relevant like yui's rejection happens</br></br></br></br>  <br>You fucking wish, this is Jump anon the same shitty magazine who "forces" authors everytime they have the chance to extend a series. <br><br>Also there's still that useless piece of shit Onodera hanging around.</br></br></br>  So going forward its basically going to start dropping off girls from the running. Marika is next m8s  animefag here; should i pick up the manga from where the anime left off (+whatever it skipped) or should i just start from scratch  <br>No, get out, you can still leave this hell</br>  <br> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet<wbr>s/d/1OPZh2OepUEqUR62CgkfU52Ja_ry2cx<wbr>M0kUdhXJwMhJ8/edit#</wbr></wbr> </br>  <br>Go back and read the Lie Detector chapter.</br>  <br> not reading Nisekoi weekly <br>It almost sounds like you don't like fun.</br></br>  <br> komi flourished the girls relationship with raku for 200 chapters <br> komi after an approximately 200 chapters now started having raku shot the girls down one by one <br> by the end of the series tsugumi is kill by paula, marika died from cold, yui is married to a random big black yakuza leader, haru and kosaki is married to a generic faceless background character all the while chitoge is riding raku in a hot steamy hawaiian honeymoon. <br>   yfw this series will be his revenge for double arts </br></br></br></br>  Why Komi do progress right now? He could did it atleast 50 chapter ago.  <br>Because either sales are dropping, or he's remembered who he wanted to be before giving in to despair.</br>  <br>Or he just got bored and want to leave the boat.</br>  Is it bad I'm more concerned about Y-san's health/sanity than I am concerned with the plot of things? Like I'm half expecting him to off himself or kill Komi or something if Marika actually kicks the bucket.  <br>Im still waiting for Y-san to appear in manga. He deserves his happy ending with Marika.</br>  <br>Y-san showing up and sweeping Marika off her feet whilst also curing her sickness or whatever the fuck is going on with her would certainly be an acceptable twist.</br>  <br>Y-san will be a Doctor who will cure her.<br>It should be natural to her falling for a man who saved her life.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Of all the people in this series, Y-san is the one deserving of a happy ending. Let him have his happiness with Marika.</br></br></br>  <br>Y-san is the only decent thing that come out from nisekoi.</br>  <br>Look at her. Gasping and wheezing for air. When her Raku is in ashes then she has Komi's permission to die.</br>  <br>dem navels</br>  <br>How do we protect Y-san's smile?</br>  <br>Oh fuck that I dropped that the panel He said break up with me. I read summaries to see if his friends still hated him but after they made up I let it go.</br>  <br>We can't do it. <br>Only Komi can do it and we know how he can fuck up everything.</br></br>  <br>With just a little dose of waifu, that's how.</br>    I want to  eat a meal prepared by   Raku Ichijo !<br><br> And then, I don't know, watch tv with him for a while or something. He seems like a nice guy to hang out with, when he isn't occupied with his harem, and I'm sure Shuu could embroil us in some sort of wacky adventure. </br></br>  Komi ain't killing shit<br><br>This horrible cashcow has a lot of bad milk to give</br></br>  This is it, this shit confirms me Komi want to suicide but probably can't do it because family, fear or even some insurance money for someone he love, so he just provoked Y-san to murder him.  <br>See you next week.</br>  <br> implying one of his harem sluts wouldn't ruin everything </br>  <br> 2015 <br> ever watching T.V. <br><br>Stop posting grandpa. You're old, you're gonna die soon, spend your time more wisely.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'd totally hang out with Raku, if you're lucky you could snag one of the girls whose heart he breaks.</br></br>  <br>Would you even want to though? They're only good in the universe they're in.</br>  <br>Well, if we're talking about being friends with Raku wouldn't that put us in the same universe as them?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128814392 <br> :0 <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128831402   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128814392 <br> :0 </br>  <br>This is what I get for having way too many tabs open, fuck</br>  Dying Marika - best Marika.  <br>Fuck you.</br>  <br> Marika <br> actually dying <br>She may be worst girl but come on that's not going to happen. This is going to turn out like the Chitoge/Tsugumi "leaving" arc which was resolved positively. Marika is going to be fine  and then she's going to be rejected once and for all .</br></br></br>  <br>I'd say eating snacks and watching anime/dorama with a gang boss/harem head is a good way to spend an afternoon.</br>  <br>Context</br>  <br><br>I will legitimately drop this series if they kill off best girl.</br></br>  <br>Why is Honda just standing there looking preet scary and not helping?</br>  <br>Well, maybe, instead of being killed off, she will finally get her big white house with a medium-sized dog, and the house will fly around the world and she will go on adventures, looking for love in a post-Raku-following-his-boner world.</br>   Marika is actually the promise girl <br> she dies <br> Raku feels too guilty to keep doing the fake dates with Chitoge <br> he decides to ponder his life choices while the gangs erupt in all-out war <br> he finally steels his resolve and goes full John Wick on the gangs <br> now a certified badass, he turns down everyone's confessions and moves to Iran <br> Raku, at last, marries the Chitoge look-alike and lives happily ever after <br>True End Confirmed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck. this will actually be the best end</br>  <br>Will the Shue-Gumi become a multinational force?</br>  http://manga.redhawkscans.com/reade<wbr>r/read/nisekoi/en/0/180/</wbr>  <br>There is a difference between being straightforward and being a stalker, anon.</br>  <br>My heart hurts.</br>  <br>I can't handle things actually happening.<br>This is not the Nisekoi that I know</br></br>  <br>I hope it ends soon, so I can start reading it again.</br>  <br>Full throttle to the finish line. Get on board!</br>  Wow Marika is a pill popper.  <br>I do not want to live any more fuck this and fuck this author who makes this manga. Marika deserve a happy life but this is to bad for her. I hate this.</br>  God fucking damn it, not even a Marikafag but her reaction is probably going to feel the worst.  <br>Ho lee shit. Komi is a fucking master. I'm actually crying right now. <br>I feel terrible for Marika. She knew the whole time but kept quiet for Raku's sake. I always had a feeling she knew. She really does love him with all of her heart.<br>This is taking me back to the early chapters with emotional scenes that did me in, only it's much worse because there's a terrible sense of finality attached to it.<br>At this point, I don't care about the Rakubowl. I've always liked Chitoge and wanted her and Raku to end up together, but I don't even care right now. This is too hard. <br>Fuck you, Komi. You were trying to save us from this all along.</br></br></br></br></br>  I hope Y-san delivers justice   harem member <br> dying from Japanese cold <br>Don't be delusional</br></br>  Marika's mom is related to Raku somehow.  <br> harem member <br> flat rejected <br>Ten chapters ago you would have said the same thing about what happened to Yui.</br></br></br>  <br>even if she doesn't die I'm still gonna feel sad she's rejected</br>  <br>All this is Raku's fault. He's dense, selfish and cowardly. Anyway, for three of them this nightmare is over. Three to go.</br>  Instead of nipping it in the bud at the beginning he let it build up and will reject her feelings on valentines day while she is on her death bed.  <br>you clearly learned literally nothing from Sunohara</br>  <br>Three? So Tsugumi, Haru, and Yui are out, and Chitoge, Onodera, and Marika are left, is what you're saying?<br>That's optimistic. Marika is as good as gone. Fuck this, man.</br></br>  <br> Raku did little wrong. <br><br> Not nothing, but fuck, people seem to blame him for everything. </br></br></br>  <br>Maruusha sweeps in for the kill.</br>  <br>This is not going to end well. But I'd rather have Marika be rejected than her dying, to be honest. She's extremely annoying and I want to punch her every time I see her, but seeing her become so weak is actually pretty sad.</br>  <br>He did ignore Marika's feelings while knowing full well that they were real, even acknowledging their sincerity on many occasions.<br>He's at least guilty of negligence in that regard.</br></br>  <br> wanting to physically harm Marika <br>Dude.</br></br>  <br>Formally, Tsugumi is still in race. She still can't reject her feelings for Raku for Chitoge's sake like Haru did.</br>  <br>Why ? He's not supposed to take responsibility for her feelings. She is the one who kept chasing him knowing full well that only he had a secret to keep and that he is in love with another girl.</br>  <br>I thought she bowed out when she accepted Raku as a good man for Chitoge.</br>    <br>Sorry, I over reacted again.<br>I loved you, Raku-sama...</br></br>  <br>She deserved straight answer, not some bullshit.</br>  <br>= Raku Bowl Status =<br><br>Tsugumi: death by sudoku<br>Haru: death by sudoku<br>Yui: shot down by Raku<br>Marika: soon to be shot down by Raku/dying from AIDS<br>Kosaki: slowly but systematically neutralized by Chitoge<br>Chitoge: raiding Raku with her gorilla warfare</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Raku rejects her <br> She accepts it, but <br> She leans in and Kisses him <br> "Sorry, I over reacted." <br> I loved you, Raku-sama... <br> She passes out from shock  <br> Chitoge arrives and an ambulance that Honda called from the shadows does shortly afterwards <br> Marika recovers, but but must remain hospitalized for at least the rest of teh school year <br> While bed ridden, her young doctor takes care of her and watches over her personally <br> His name: Yamato-sensai <br> Or as he likes to be called, Y-san </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't Y-san more than one person on 2ch or something?</br>  <br>The joke would still be reverential.</br>   AIDS <br>No, not another Mother's Rosario dammit!</br>  <br> I have to face Tachinana <br><br>One fucking month and he still did nothing. Fucking Raku, piece of shit.</br></br></br>  This is moving way too fast. It's already been a month since Yui's confession?<br><br>Shit son we only have a year in-universe left, you can't just skip months like that.</br></br>  you are all retarded fags that will just hop on the next never ending ride, with that said marika is the only real answer and since irefuse to accept any other reality im just gonna neglect this development  <br>We were the ones complaining about the slowness.</br>  holy shit it's actually ending  <br>/a/ is so tsun for Nisekoi.</br>  <br>Yeah but there's a large gap between what we had, and we're getting right now.</br>  <br>It really doesn't feel that unnatural.</br>  <br>I disagree. It started moving too fast a dozen chapters ago, when Christmas just came out of fucking nowhere.<br><br>They had the school trip, which usually takes place in October. Then they came back and a chapter later it was "Oh shit tomorrow's Christmas, isn't it?<br><br>After that it just snowballed.</br></br></br></br></br>  goddamn it  I need to be free from this nightmare, If Marika dies i'll cry but also I'll be free from this shitty show, watching her was the only thing who kept me following this.  <br>After Maruusha's arc it snowballed. That is the single point in this series where the pacing didn't match the prior chapters and it hasn't been the same since.</br>  <br>Didn't really notice anything different in the pacing after Maruusha, what do you mean?</br>  The next arc is obviously going to be about Raku getting her to reconcile with her mother   before she dies.    <br>Holy shit. I can't take this.</br>  <br>Yui was the redshirt of harem members</br>  <br>She's actually honest about her feelings unlike most girls, that's why I like her.</br>  <br>That's true, he was leading her on to a degree that he could have lessened significantly, though I don't think anything he could have done would have solved the problem right out the gate. Raku is in the wrong, here, but saying that makes it seem as if there was some ideal circumstance that he was negating.<br><br> Also that whole thing about not wanting to make her sad even though it would just be delaying the issue and the right solution to these situations only ever being retrospective and yadda yadda yadda what other people say yadda yadda. </br></br></br>  <br>Before Maruusha's arc, every side girl that was introduced had a purpose or was related to someone else as a friend, confidant, etc. Maruusha was introduced with no warning whatsoever and she even fell for Raku only to never be seen or heard from again. Her whole character reveal and existence breaks away from the norm of how every other character has been introduced.<br><br>Then brings us to the Kyoto shrine visit which was a pretty big deal plotwise because every girl landed their marriage arrow onto Raku except one: Yui, who is a key holder. Meanwhile the "side" characters, Haru and Tsugumi, were main characters during the arc yet one of the main characters integral to the storyline was not.<br><br>I have to leave for now but there are so many more things wrong with the last 60 chapters that it physically pains me.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> only to never be seen or heard from again <br> implying there won't be an arc where she comes back, or where everyone goes to Maruusha's country for some reason. </br></br>  DROPPING<br><br>LIKE<br><br>FLIES</br></br></br></br>  <br>I literally can not handle this. Everyone is fucking dying off so quickly.</br>   the reason Marika has a bad relationship with her mother is because the mother wants her to stop going after Raku <br> Raku rejects Marika <br> Marika has a phonecall with her mother and explains what happened <br> Marika's mom wants her to come back <br> they live together happily <br> meanwhile Chitoge realizes that Raku is into Onodera and wants to step back <br> Raku realizes that he's actually into Chitoge <br> Onodera doesn't do shit <br> everyone is alone <br> end </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>THE END IS NEAR  like in 2 more yars. </br>  <br> komi after an approximately 200 chapters now started having raku shot the girls down one by one <br><br>this fucking manga srsly<br><br>pic sums up what I'm actually reading</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Keep dreaming m8. It'll be over by the end of the year.<br><br><br>He has to. That's the sick thing.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Keep dreaming m8. It'll be over by the end of the year. <br><br>I fucking wish.</br></br></br>  <br> ending less than a year after the second season ended <br>It could be ending soon but honestly I think it's going to go on for at least one more year.</br></br>  <br> It'll be over by the end of the year. <br>No. I admit that things are finally happening, but this will last at least one more year.</br></br>  What's yours?  1. Symphogear<br>2. Sore ga Seiyuu<br>3. Akagami</br></br>  <br>Is that still going? I honestly couldn't be bothered after episode what, 8 or something.<br>It got stale really quickly.</br></br>  <br>Kangoku Gakuen.</br>  Crayon Shin-chan.  <br>It's the anime that I never knew I always wanted to watch</br>  All S2 character song CDs are out now.<br><br>Which one is the best?</br></br>  <br>Mmm, you go tell Pandaboy that.
