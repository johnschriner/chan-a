Coma Cheese  I don't get the joke.    Now that's alpha.    "So you really are good at cooking."    "Do you not believe my words, Senpai?"    "No, not really... I just thought that you're incredible."    "Haa? Are you making passes at me again?"    Isshiki shoves spoon into 8man's mouth.    "Do you hate that level of sweetness?"    "...I don't."    "Ah, but I wasn't talking about the flavor..."   <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127109431#p127109503">Click here</a> to view the full text.                   Fresh thread! Fuck yeah /a/  Spoilers from volume 11:  Yukino gives 8man the chocolate.   Spoilers from volume 11:   Iroha won't be in volume 12 because Sensei is going to make sure she's not slacking off at the Service Club     Yukino? I thought Yui was the one giving them.  Better for Yukinofags like me     What are some other anime that were widely discussed on /a/ as they aired, and then quickly forgotten?   A board that mostly talks about seasonal anime runs out of things to talk about when the season ends and doesn't force threads on shows everyone but you has already talked about  What a shock. Lurk more.   Coppellion. Probably for the best.   cause it /a/ doesn't have a long enough attention span    KLK    Some shows that had a lot of airing hype completely disappeared after they ended, C3 being a good example. Greatest blunder is probably Kill la Kill. Some other shows only had a small audience among /a/, which disintegrated after the show was over.    Lucky Star Maybe not "quickly forgotten", but considering what a massive phenomenon it used to be it sure is dead by now. All the other "hits" from that era(Haruhi, CLANNAD, TTGL) are still being remembered to this day but no one gives a shit about Lucky Star.    Forgot Code Geass, which is still a thing as well    c3-bu was my AOTS    http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5_6L<wbr>vKWy5vo</wbr>  [ ]   Do you like forced drama?   one of these things is not like the other  one of these things does not belong     Drama is good on occasion. Some do it better then others. What the fuck is "forced drama" though? Drama by it's very nature is forced.   you don´t?   I think you mean "melodrama". Yeah I do except in Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso where it was unbearable(partially because the characters acted nothing like their age).   watches a drama show.   Complains when drama occurs.    i like ample drama  Drama in a drama show? Sure. Drama shoehorned into some other show other than a drama (Which is what I think you're asking about)? Fuck no.    I like three of those  I don't like two of them  I haven't seen one of them but I know the director is a hack so I don't need to        Bait? Bait.    how the fuck could she ever have been seen as a guy with these huge plot devices?   I'm really 50/50 on melodrama/forced drama, where as one day I'll love it and can't get enough, and others it just makes me want to drop the show/manga. The problem is, you can't even escape it with western stuff, it is everywhere.    she wore reverse push up bra. she pretty much pancaked them flat   please don't bully the white albums    What the fuck is "forced drama" though? Drama by it's very nature is forced.  I think the term "obviously forced drama" would be more appropriate. There are good and bad ways of perpetuating drama in any form of media. Many of the bad methods can result in what is known as "forced drama", or alternatively Melodrama.      drama occurs in melodramatic shows  Care to post any examples of drama that isn't "forced"?     but that only works, if you have hardly anything going there. If you actually succeeded in pancakeing THAT you would only get a necrotic decubital mess out of it.    The exact same OP as yesterday? Fuck off.    They've grown exponentially since she debuted.    I don't think that's physically possible.       why can´t they just leave us with DFC tomboy? big chest Tomboy is disgusting    Tsugumi is my favourite Nisekoi, but I agree. Her breasts are starting to get ridiculous. It was better when she was flatter.    Why the fuck am I not watching this    White Album 2   Sunn O)))     All drama is forced    That's not forced drama OP Forced drama is when a comedy/ecchi/faux-harem show decided to curve-ball us with stupid little issues being blown out of proportion only to be solved by the end of the episode  I remember it happening in Mayo Chicken in case you wanted an example. I don't remember the exact episode or exactly what happened but it involved someone camping by the river and MC catching a cold       based lucky trip tsugumi   Good  Shigatsu   Clannad Afterstory   Unfortunately bad  Angel Beats   AnoHana   Pointles  5cm   Haven't watched/read  WA2                 Is Tsugumi basically the Komi version of Naoto?     the manga got pretty boring, because absolutely nothing happens and it´s basically a neverending generic a shit Harem    There are people who haven't watched WA2   what's your excuse      Good   Shitgatsu      It's the best one of the 5 I judged.   how about a REAL forced drama   Season 2 is quite bad. Season 1 is actually quite enjoyable though if you switch off your brain.    I disagree making characters suddenly sick while somewhat realistic does not need to happen to the main female of every dramatic anime. Shows with people suddenly being deathly sick or having amnesia in order to make the end of a series more dramatic are definitely melodrama.    It's the opposite way for me, the new episodes were less unbearable harem24/7 and Chitoge isn't a bitch anymore.    bell kun?    season 2 had pretty good episodes. the one with shu confessing and the one showing onodera's past were pretty much some of the best episodes of the series.    I think if Bell was a woman I would like the series more. He'd be cuter and it would have one more cute girl for more to fap over.    But at least season 1 had some progression and a semblance of an overarching plot. Season 2 is going nowhere (even by Nisekoi standards) and most the arcs are throwaway. I did enjoy Tsugumi's episode where Paula was introduced though.     nisekoi s2 has had far too little tsugumi  the last episode was 100% onodera focused and showing off how she's fat, dumb and awkward. i felt like clapping for her. ATTAGIRL! YOU'RE #1, YOUR #1!     not really /a/ but To the moon is for me the absolutely most forced drama ever percieved by mankind  guy meets girl when they were children   guy´s brother dies, guy is traumatized   takes medication to forget that he had a brother (wtf?)   forgets girl too   meets same girl in High school they go out and marry   girl is pissed because he doesn´t remember her from before but doesn´t say anything because literally an autist   girl dies just to show him    OH MY GAWWWD SO SAAAD! GOTY             Seems to be very generic, also it has a 2 which means there is a 1.    Nisekoi had 2 episodes I liked, that christmas party, and the beach vacation, but everything else was unbearable. I went into the new season excepting to drop it and found it pleasantly enjoyable.       the last episode was 100% onodera focused and showing off how she's fat, dumb and awkward. i felt like clapping for her. ATTAGIRL! YOU'RE #1, YOUR #1!  I don't necessarily hate Kosaki, but Christ her episodes are boring as fuck. I rarely if ever get to the end of them.      Implying bell isn't good enough to fap to.      forced drama   forced comedy  I hate this forced meme        He's alright, perfect for getting dom'd. But he's still be better as a woman.    WA2 is self contained. I wouldn't call it generic. The last episode almost makes up for the plodding progression of the rest of the series but it is short anyway.     God this show was such a piece of shit      almost makes up  Doesn't sound too good now, does it?      Ano Hana  Now you've fucked up.     Fuck this show so hard.    It's a pretty good episode and it's nice to see a show that doesn't pretend adults don't have sex (not spoilers there is sex in earlier episodes).    [HorribleSubs] Kyoukai no Rinne - 12 [720p].mkv   All 20-25 followers, ARISE!     Do I need to watch Rinne no Lagrange before this?   I'm sleepy though.  So will this show turn into a romantic comedy from now on?   You're giving this show too much credit.  There are 5-6 followers at most.      no, idiot, the prequel is kyoukai no kanata   I liked the episode, it was nice and Rinne's father keeps on being a cunt.   It's Kara no Kyoukai, dumbo.   Oh SHIT  Wobble wobble   time for the AOTS   Time for a WEG thread.  Post WEGs.     I want more of Nagate and Izana interactions on the ship - as long as progress is made. Those episodes were great.     Degeneracy      I don't even /pol/       I don't get it.    Is this a new troll method? I don't even understand what you're trying to imply.   ITT: shitty tumblr gif's.  What are we going to do after next week? Is there any hope for more UFO Girl and Friends?   cri   I have hope for  s2   Did you see Reina today!!? did you see how  HETERO she is?   Why do we need constant back to back general threads?  Relevant: http://www.animemaru.com/hibike-eup<wbr>honium-episode-12-preview-shows-kum<wbr>iko-and-reina-scissoring/</wbr></wbr>     back to back threads = general threads  Why?     That's how popular anime works.   next episode is finale?  You may only chose one.   No, a dozen threads sprinkled across /a/ with the same dozen people flinging shit in all of them is much more fun.    Reina    Why I can't choose Natsuki.    No contest.    if they fill up then we need them. it doesnt seem complicated to me. if we didnt need them then they would 404 themselves. dont overthink it bro.    Kyoani will do it for /u/ Just wait and see    Buchou a best.     but muh 3rd years     Haruka.   Reina deserves Taki. She does.  they're back!  Where were you when both Shoe and Reina got NTR'd by UFO-kun?    Kumiko mentions she was with Taki   Reina mind goes blank for a second   Kumiko starts her end of the episode narration   Reina speaks over Kumiko's narration because she demands to know what happened  She is too cute        I choose Asuka if only for how comfortable her thighs look in this picture.    even when Kumiko mentioned she loved Eupho Reina didn't give a shit and keeps sayng her name hoping to get her attention back so she can tell her in detail what the fuck happened with Taki. Too fucking cute.     I still think Kumiko did it on purpose.  Too bad this isn't one of those shows where the characters chat over next episode previews.     Of course there will be more UFO related stuff from KyoAni. Who knows if it's a second season or a movie though.    last  reminder that Aoi was right   What was going trough reina's mind at that moment?   I'm just waiting for a PV of this during next week's episode.  Reminder that loser onee-chan was right and Kumiko was a bitch for no reason.    alone with Taki   alone with Taki   alone with Taki   alone with Taki   alone with Taki   alone with Taki          All things that have a beginning must come to an end. That is precisely what allows us to appreciate them.    fuck this japanese ho   muh college   muh jerb   muh salary   no fun allowed   we dont even know what she wants to learn in college or what her dream even is.          4x3 is complete, now we just need the percussion section to ruin the perfection.  What section would you join? Who trombone here?      Onee-chan gives up her passion for music to become Generic Nippon Office Drone #246520356 and pressures her cute little sister to do the same   Being right about anything      Probably all of the things she'd do if she was alone with Taki-sensei   meep meep   Kaori    Oboe or trumpet. But mostly oboe.    If I'm already in the  flute  section, can I change?     big violin  chart ruined.      to become Generic Nippon Office Drone #246520356  To become a university student.     all they did was talk all night r-right?     big violin  every time     Like holding hands?    Move on and watch some other anime anon. It really isn't hard, plus Hibiki is good but it really isn't anything special.    Trombone section looks like a fun section.    i already played horn so might as well get with dem horns and start my harem    Yes Reina, yes.    And gentle walks home    doujins when    no fun allowed   I want to make Reina jealous.    Kaori.       harem of worst girls     Horn. Not for the girls (okay, maybe except grumpy-chan), but because I fucking love the instrument.    Well on one hand my specialty is the trumpet and I was good at it, and I'd have a chance to mingle with Kaori.  On the other hand that means playing with Ribbons and even the thought of playing with that bitch makes me throw up in my mouth a little.     would you NTR Reina?   never forget    man, that filtered photoshopped pic. kyoani is not even trying anymore.     Volleyball club     I can't believe she dropped the bottle and had this look   Just how deeply in love is this fucking girl? She'll never rest until she gets that dick.      I already played woodwinds so maybe I'll shoot for brass. Which is the hardest brass instrument here?    i hated that the subs didnt have reinas lines in this scene    Yeah, no. Fuck off to A-1 or WIT.  KyoAni will make Violet Evergarden.      How wet did she just get?    Percussion to relieve stress!    Yes. It'll be brilliant. Like tea first thing in the morning.    Tuba can be pretty tough if you have a weak constitution and don't breath well. French Horns are probably the toughest to play well.   I thought it was just coincidence I thought I was just being a faggot But now I know I'm fucking watching Japanese Whiplash      I'll join the based section    Bleeding hymen    I was just watching Whiplash today. Reminded me how the guy was drumming so hard his palms were bleeding, but of course not as extreme    Piccolo to comfort the cute, tall girl (Yoriko)     The instrument shading in this show is so underappreciated     I want to play the seal      Please go fuck yourself back to you're filthy jojo general thanks.    I'm surprised the biggest girl plays the smallest instrument. I wonder if she's height conscience. I want to  bully     Make it 3x4 with one centred in the bottom maybe.   Reminder that now both Reina AND Kaori have apologized and Ribbons still hasn't.    big violin  wat    That dorky smile.  Who /crack pairing/ here   how does one play a seal?    I really wanna impregnate Kaori but I'd rather choose best girl so Asuka    The smallest girl also plays the big violin.    It's a percussion instrument.      Actually, I was alone with Taki-sensei until just now.   I stole your man, neener-neener.     president looks fucking majestic  quality solo pose, alpha as fuck 10/10 would hold hands with  they are not going to the nationals unless we get a sax solo from her         why didn't kumiko come  No penetration     Haruka a qt    Based clarinet    https://<span>youtu.be/BWUzpQCvl1c?t=2m29<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]    Exactly what did Reina say?    Which instrument is easy to play?    Inuit pls go.    Drawing these instruments must be a bitch and a half.  KyoAni is magic.      Reeeeee    Triangle.   lets get a Kumiko train going    what did you do with him   did you kiss   did you fuck   kumiko   KUMIKO         It's gapmoe.    What category does the seal instrument lie under? Brass? Percussion? Woodwind?    is she in love with taki too now?    That's the baritone sax power-stance, it channels soul through the body and into the sax.     Yes Reina   I went to school late at night   Just to fuck our music teacher       I've seen people with triangle parts screw up during actual concerts.  Shit is just as embarrassing as it sounds.      contrabased    welcome to our threads, always glad to have new faces here, sorry you missed the last 3 months.    Did you hear that, Kumiko says she wants to get better   I hope this show gets better   DOHOHOHOHOHO      Where to start a harem?    op é faggot, definitely. Look at those extremely cute girls  plus waifu     kumiko lips     /a has trouble with shows that aren't Kyoani or Shaft. It's like it doesn't know what to do as a collective. It's funny because in Japan it's reasonably popular but not anything approaching a mega hit this season but with weaboos it's like the be all end all. I'd swear the west is more obsessed with Kyoani than Japan is.     Look at those badass motherfuckers in tenor sax.    how did Natsuki become undisputed best girl so quickly?     Says the one on a Hibiki general.   I was just answering the Op's question and telling him to move on, that's all. It's not like Hibiki is amazing or anything, no need to get butthurt.      The  light music club    Suddenly Taki is so friendly with Kumiko and order her to practice that part again. I wonder what happen on that dark classroom   What does it take to un-grump her?   something definitely went wrong here  Kyoani does it again.   Why is Mamiko so unperflat?     butthurt   Please, again, stick to your jojo general, cancer. It's not airing day anymore, or do we go there fuck up things? Yeah, no. So fuck off.      Join the tubas    She was a  sleeper  hit.     Something definitely went wright here  FIFY     REMOVE    She was best girl all along, then she failed and like a phoenix rose from the ashes even bester than before    Look at her body, she's so fucking hot.   Lets all love Reina    Reina tries to yandere   night of passionate hate-turned-lovemaking ensues   Kumiko wakes up with a fuckton of scratches on her back       Please stop this cancer.    Yes    they gave her screentime    she won't want it unless you're taki   Why is she crying?   Taki sensei is going to be a lucky man     she wants to get better     She isn't special enough.    Remember how we used to talk "I wish I could see more of her" in the first episodes?  They literally just gave her a more screentime.      I've heard that clarinet is pretty easy.     Implying Taki will hit that   Ever      Then why is Squidward so shit?    umaku naritai    Kumiko gave Mamiko all of her kumikos. This way Kumiko is perflat.      Maybe it's because he's a squid.    Start with the double reeds.    Because he's playing underwater    Hayamin for the ear-sex. Asuka for marriage and impregnation. Kaori for casual sex.    because her show ends next week    Kumiko spent like 70% of this episode coated in moisture, either sweat or tears or both.    Kuyashi    thinken of genuine    Damn     That's because you rarely think     Because season 2 never    What was she covered in when she was with Taki?     implying he won't     It's what most people start on.    He totally should  once she graduates     Do the later volumes of the novel mention Kumiko's kumikos?     morning to sundown   in summer   literally 16 hours a day  I was really surprised her fingers weren't even calloused.       Of course he will. Why would he keep alone? Sensei just should move on with his life.    Its not happening Reina.    started out as a complete newbie   made it past auditions   can play the cymbals and the bass drum too  Sakai chan will take us to nationals!      He has no fingers.    It's wicked easy. Like all wind instruments it requires a bit of stamina and learning circular breathing can be tricky, but on both counts it's not nearly as demanding as just about anything else in a concert band.    Kumiko has breast envy. Which also means she spends a good amount of time describing each of the girls chests.    I would go with the soprano clarinets first then maybe move up to the double reeds.        Imitation butter. Japan's a bizarre place.    kumiko_blowing_her_true_love.jpg    I wonder why Sakai joined the percussion section. Did she want to relieve stress?   plot twist that Goto is actually the chairman of the school when  Also   that new art of them crossing scissors on pixiv   Holy shit /a/       that's how it should be. Did you see m- Reina today? she'll never accept anyone who isn't Taki.     in Japan it's reasonably popular   It really isn't popular, the first BD Vol barely broke 5K and the following Vols will sell even less. In terms of KyoAni sales that's piss poor. The west are literally the only ones hyping Hibiki up because Japan gives no fucks about this series. It's a good series but it's noting special like some anions want to believe it is. After one season it will be forgotten just like Amagi for instance, it happens all the time.      Are you basing popularity only from BD sales?    I want Goto to plow me.     cancer   It's like your pretending this thread isn't cancer, it's flattering.      What would you expect from a casual? That's why people should keep trying to expunge the cancer of here, just like that jojofag.    Girl you like is crying about how she's upset and wants to improve   Yell at her that you want to improve more than her   She starts crying more   Shuuichi is one smooth motherfucker. No wonder he gets all the girls.         my brain says the fagotts my dick says the horns  wat do       Every Kyoani show since...Nichijou? has had doomsayers running around /a/ quoting BD sales numbers like the studio's dying.    Castrate.   Who else enjoyed Kumiko crying?   Fix your dick.    What are those black things in the first pics?     I had a stroke!     What else is there to base it on? I mean free and Chunnibyou sold a shitload of BDs and they are considered popular. Seriously Hibiki really isn't popular especially if you consider the fact the Novels where it's based on were nonexistent till KyoAni got there hands on it. And even then the BD are doing average not that great. So the series is really not that popular in Japan.    Do you think they bonded over their shed blood together? Hazuki needs to work harder so she can join them.    That all the Ribbon I will get? Then it's just: bom bom bom boooom bombombombombombombombombom bom bom bom booooom.  "I get scolded a lot that I make you practice a lot, I give two shits about it though."  Everyone gives a shit about authority, not just Ribbon.        What do her tears taste like?    Do you buy everything you like?       I wonder who is this autist who keep posting things like this.       Just rubber pads. New drummers practice on them because they're quieter than actual drums and you're not scuffing the shit out of whatever you're drumming on. And so they don't accidentally stab a hole in a $300 drum, I guess.   they never did explain why Midori has an iguana on her bag.  the face of a loser  Everything about this scene was perfect.   not quite my tempo Oumae san    Because it's the section where people have fun.    What does your heart say?    The thumbnail makes it look like Midori has two huge midori's.   Kyaoni should do incest and become the second oreimo. Goddamn that shit sold so much.    I meant like people talk about it somewhat, but it's not the regional obsession like it is here.     Gon-san?      Them sweaty Kumiko   This episode is too much for me   So wait is this only a 13 episode series? I thought it was 26. Wow there was gore in the captcha.     I wish Asuka was here     And a really fat face.    I guess the west have some kind of infatuation with KyoAni.    13 episodes + an OVA, the show is ending at the Kyoto tournament even though there's still Kansai and Nationals left.  Episode 13 "Goodbye, Competition"  The amount of time to play in the concert is just twelve minutes. It seems like it will be over in an instant, but it seems like it will last an eternity... For the sake of those twelve minutes, the concert band members have stakes the springtime of their youth. Kitauji High School Concert Band's performance begins now.         They say that 1 in 4 people in a group are retarded   I'm not a retard   Neither am I   Nor I   ...         We need more of this qt   That way she turns her head in embarrassment.   So good, it's the little things.     Aw... I want Hibike!! Ensemble.    drum pads    Next year's dream team. They will lead their band to nationals.    KyoAni needs the next Free and they need it fast. Free is going to be over in December and then they won't have a cash cow. It's reasonable that people want them to have a best seller.    hail the goddess    I guess I should state that I thought it was a 26 episode series because the pacing is so slow. Comfy definitely, but slow.    we'll get something, but we have to wait till December to find out what it is    ITT: gaijin talk out their ass about Japanese tastes. I don't know or care either way, and I'm comfortable admitting this because I don't live there and don't get weekly Oricon numbers on actual sales. In any case, you forget that the other objective of these shows is to pimp the source material, so it's just as important to look at the increase in sales numbers on the LNs. If that objective is achieved, then BD sales are irrelevant as long as they cover the production costs.    kyoani will never do an anime about a female football team   kyoani will never do an anime about cute maids doing cute things   hibikek s2 never   kyoani will never do a full blown yuri anime   kyoani will never do an anime about the hip hop dancer from hyouka and her club    kyoani will never do an anime "about" background girls         Post seal girl!       kyoani will never make a cute christmas cake anime.     Here's one with a free seal.     reina + kumiko + 2 no name background girls  Why     Reminder that the bassoon is basically a big, heavy, thick, bulging phallus in instrument form and the girls are likely using to "practice" in more than one sense.    Bye Reina.    That too ;_;   Are seal that cute?        Hazuki and Midori still in promotion material despite being background characters who never hanged out with Reina     Kyoani doesn't own the novels, and they weren't hired to advertise the novels. They chose the project on their own.    BDs don't have to cover production costs, media publishing megacorps like Kadokawa cover production costs for just about any show that isn't anime-original, financed by Fuji Heavy Industries, or Kickstartered     What was sensei doing that late?  I want to have sex with Kumiko in the prone position.   Fuck, I love that position so much.     3DPD seals probably aren't this cute, sadly.      His home is haunted by his dead wife.    He can't afford broadband internet at home.    Rubbing his dick on all the mouthpieces. Also, doing paperwork.    how she jump that high   I love watching cute girls cry.   Rather then road runner it reminds me of Cross Game, but then again that probably was based on road runner.

Actually no.     implying Kyoani is gonna stop after the first movie     I like cute crying watches, girls.    KyoAni should stay out of the original anime biz?    H!E was practically an anime original. Kyoani was not approached by publisher and hired to do the project. Instead they bought the right to make the anime adaptation and did it on their own.    Cute girls I love crying about watches.    Or they stay at it until they get good. I mean it's less than 4 years that they started their publishing arm. You can't expect them to get good over night. And hopefully the Free money keeps them afloat until then.    Cutie watch-girls crying about love.    There is no way to control this. It just happens when there's a popular anime airing. See Yahari threads. Blame 4chan's oldschool imageboard design. You just gotta deal with it.    I meant more that Tamako market was the worst selling.  Also Munto.     How is that relevant? Did all fans of Free and Chuu buy the BDs for those shows? How would you measure popularity?    What are they going to do next? Free in the nuresery home? Free in their mother wombs? Free is dead anon after the movie.    her squatting technique is flawless    Free! sells, things that aren't Free! don't?    I know. All of these are made by Kyoani.    But you're considering the points after they got all their releases! Free had four volumes and we only got those numbers after the season ended! you can't compare hibike! yetyetyet    Hanada is a hack that ruins shows with too much pandering.   please let this thread be about Eupho and not sales bullshit.    implying     Chu2Koi sold well too.    Wait till Canadians see it.    Based Arseal     one season of Free sold more than all shows that aren't Free put together        Note: Reina died on the way to her home planet     I wish yurifags could muster this kind of purchasing power.    exited for the duet on Triangle Festival    I stand corrected.    fujo is really, really strong.    Would impregnate Kaori.    I already have my club out.    his house is haunted by his dead wife     Earth is Reina's home planet   the girls are all slowly falling back to Earth after having been whisked away to perform for some alien species a la some Interstella 5555 shit         Thinkign of euphorim.    I finally see it now.       not gay for hotdogs   Faggot.       I knew it. Just look at how much he likes wieners.    4u      Taki sensei is Asuka's dad?      They both live for music huh.    Fojoshis are scary.     TakiXAsuka   their offspring is Oreki and his sister      I'm glad they don't. Hopefully Kyoani learned their lesson with this show and won't ruin any new shows of theirs with pointless bait.      In any case, you forget that the other objective of these shows is to pimp the source material,  You are a retard. Next time try to be less ignorant before trying to pretend to be smartass.     This would've probably done even worse without the bait.    But that part is true. Most anime is produced by publishing companies as a way to advertise their manga/ln, and rake in that sweet marketing cash.      people want to fuck Kumiko   no ass meat   no tits   It fucking cardboard         The fluffiest cardboard known to man.  Also sex noises.     We are not talking about most anime though, we are talking about Hibike! Which in no way fits that profile since the it was the novel from little know publisher and not Kadokawa LN shit that needed promotion, and KyoAni bought it themselves - having rights on merchandize but not profits from novel itself.  So, no. Promoting novel was not their goal, also its bonus since popularity of novel increases their merch sales.  Their stake for money with Euph is - merchandize, Yahama deal and part of money from music CDs (they arent producing them, but they get parts of profits).        Its not K-On, Lucky Star, or Haruhi. As a result, it doesn't sell good.   When will Kyoani learn how to make money again?        fluffy hairjob     asking one of richest studios in industry when they`ll learn to make money  heh    You will never rape Kumiko and just watch her wallow in in self-loathing and shame.  Why even band?      I'm kuming Kumiko!   geh        They'll just make another original fujo anime and rake the fujo bucks     The patron saint of second rate musicians.     Probably, but we can't know for sure. Bait was there pretty much since the beginning, it didn't just start with episode 8. If Kyoani approached the show differently, it could have sold more.  I buy BDs of shows I like, and while I do like H!E and considered buying H!E BDs for a while, I'll never buy them because I don't want to encourage Kyoani to keep doing pathetic pandering like this.  Maybe if they give a definite romantic ending in the final episode I might change my mind. But as it stands right now, no way in hell.         PA Works to make 2 cour adaptation of all 3 Volumes   I think it would have done better, and people would have enjoyed making yuri fanart of them. People tend to like that more than being pandered to.       from little know publisher  Bullshit. These are the same people that do all those "Kono X ga sugoi" books.  Yes, KyoAni's banking on merchandising, which I believe I said was the case.      You're a terrible person and I'm certain that you lead a pathetic life, all of which is your fault.   Geh.      Rate the kumifeet.     implying   I've once heard a story about a man stranded on an island. He thought it would be a good idea to try and survive off of coconut milk and wait for help. A few hours of digestion later, he proceeded to spray diarrhea into a hole he made in the sand, and then decide to eat it thinking he would gain the nutrients back. He died a few days later from dehydration the same way he spend the last few days, eating shit and then shitting it out again.   The story I just described is the modern state of KyoAni right now.         PA can't adapt shit. Stick with originals.      richest studios in industry  Sunrise?     Aren't they a little small?    yfw Asuka will never be adaptable and quick learner to your wildest desires   yfw Kaori will never try her very best to please you   yfw buchou will never let you do anything you want to her body   yfw you will never have a threesome with these 3 goddesses   why live        Eccentric Family    Implants.     If Kumiko wasn't constantly butthurt about her chest she wouldn't be this much of a bitch.     how does one play a seal?     &gt;yfw you will never have a threesome with these 3 goddesses  Well. I am going to have a foursome with these three goddesses.     No, it's a threesome. It's one of those mysteries of faith you have to accept    Asuka always, but Haruka is putting up a stronger fight than usual.    Wait, I thought I was a euphonium.  That still counts as a 4-some?    What sound effect will Kumiko make when she stomps Shuichi next episode?  http://a.loveisover.me/lqobxe.webm      What did the kid do?     Haruka. She's nice.  Actually she is hard-working, plays the fucking sax like a badass (+her sax stance in the title card is just unf), cute, does not give up in spite of the club being full of shit and psychopaths like Asuka fucking shit up.      The sexual kind.     But that's every noise Kumiko produces.     Like poetry.     With a club.    Did the guy who is doing this for all of Kumiko's "Reina..."s update it to include this ep yet?    Reminder that percussion will never get a mid-episode eyecatch.    Why wouldn't they get one next week? They're the last section aren't they?   Gatou looks old here.    Gatou  Control yourself, Takemoto.     AKA PA's best show     VA is 44 years old     That's not Shirobako.    A miracle.    Their best are still their originals    uses both hands   OH BABY    How long has Kumiko played the ufo? I thought the whole club was filled with slackers so I'm surprised that there's only two people struggling.   Hibike! Love Story movie, please.    7 years    A Kyoani character with a nosebleed? They deliberately changed their art just so this could happen didn't they?    7 years? this is why her sister tells her to give up, she's fucking shit.    But Anon.  Only one of those are 初動. The rest are 合計s.        I thought the whole club was filled with slackers   They've already been removed. It's just that you need to be Asuka's level of autism to play that eupho phrase, and Shuichi might be having trouble because he's still getting used to the tromboner.       I played Baritone Horn for a year and I wasn't even this shit.     there's only two people struggling  We really don't know that, do we? The show wouldn't show what tribulations background characters we don't care about are going through.     I loved the way she said え、あの、けいたいをー to Taki-sensei when going to pick up her phone. She made interesting a completely insignificant line.    Is the new stuff that Taki asked her to play really that difficult, compared to what's assigned to her before (and other students)?    They actually say it is in the show. What more do you want?   Wow, how do the people that were hoping for Reina to win and the people that were hoping for Shuichi to win feel about this sudden development?  Taki grilling the Tromboners again    If you got spoiled then you wouldn't expect any romantic conclusion well maybe if you're an animeonly fag.      draw mio   call it reina  why is this allowed?        She made interesting a completely insignificant line.   What?       'A completely insignificant line, she made interesting.'    I've noticed that KyoAni's been paying really close attention, and doing much more interesting things with lighting lately. They're found a really nice balance between simplicity and detail with Hibike!'s art style      only two people struggling   [citation needed]     all the subtle KumiShu moments gave me a heart attack.   I want to squat with Kumiko    Literally blood, sweat, and tears    I hate this post-Brangelina name gattai pairing bullshit. What happened to just calling it NamexName?  And why KumiShu and not shumiko?      You're saying it like a lot will change about that number.    Knowing about novel spoilers and knowing that Reina is in love with Taki-Sensei, I can't believe that there are still people hoping for a yuri end after this scene. I don't think they could make it more obvious she's madly in love with him unless they showed her fucking table-kun while looking at a picture of Taki-Sensei.       squids have a lot of problems, huh      From what I've seen , taking the first part of each chara's name for gattai is what all nip shippers do (ShuuKumi for example).  Only tumblr makes a retarded mess out of pairing names (Shuumiko for example).    How fucking cute was Kumiko's outfit at the end there?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?t=11&amp;<wbr>v=YHYWAXFvs0Q</wbr>  [ ]   Not much    when not exerting effort, she's good   when she wants to be special, she's bad   Guess she needs to get high.      I agree, they've made some visually compelling design decisions in this series. People love to shit on the 3D and "photoshop filter photo" backgrounds but overall they've made a really cohesive and unique style.    Omelette du fromage!   Omelette du fromage!   Omelette du fromage!      What was Reina saying in this scene?    Definitely cuter than her festival mountain outfit.     Same haircut   "It's the same character!"     Is this symbolic?   I want to cut your hair      I like Taki-sensei      Nah, she might be bi.    Sure, it's symbolic of the fact that there will always be a giant rift between them.     Keep dreaming /u/     Something in the line of "Hey Kumiko, what did you talk about when you was alone with Taki-sensei?!"     From river-side to the bridge. It's getting closer.      always  See ya next ep    MAIN CHARACTERS   It's inaccurate, Anon. Do you really want to live in a world of inaccuracies?      You didn't take my Taki-sensei's virginity, did you?!     what are their names? contrabass-chan is really cute!   Reminder    Kitauji concert band power levels     Oboe-chan  -- POWER GAP --   Asuka    Midori    Reina           Even the percussion section had enough of Shuichi's incompetence.  I remember when this anime started and how everyone was accepting Sapphire-chan as their deity and savior of this board.  What happened?     I don't remember that.  Are you perhaps lying, Anonymous?     The pillow fort!   She turned out to be a bitch.    She's ugly as fuck.      Sakai-chan looks like she wants to use Shuichi's head as instrument.    Which alternate timeline did you hail from, Anon? We never had such agreement. Also, in case you are not a slider, you spelled Asuka wrong.    http://danbooru.donmai.us/data/3753<wbr>f7a44bca05e65d97dd78efc73d0e.jpg  Are you feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?  </wbr>    a bitch  wot    ugly  wot  Are we watching the same anime? I think people got blinded by rage after the aids Ribbon-chan spread. Thank god I can cleanse my eyes daily by just looking at the perfection that is Sapphire-chan.            No, she only wants ribbon's ribbon.     She ruined practice by crying after Shuichi rejected Hazuki because all she could think about is herself. It was about her feeling guilty over encouraging Hazuki, not her feeling bad for Hazuki herself. She's a bitch.    she's very talented but currently not the focus of the show  maybe in S2 they'll properly develop her      I hope not, there are other background characters I like more than her.    Clarinets a best.    if everything goes well Oboe-chan will be the focus    People got mad that she was sad because she encouraged Hazuki and then felt responsible when she got shot down, then more people got mad when she tacitly supported Kaori over Reina, plus there were always people that hated her design.  Despite all of this, I maintain that Midori/Sapphire/Quartzite a cute. CUTE.        Find something to watch next season.    Are there any Cute Girls Doing  Real  Things shows next season?    I want /u/ to leave.    I thought her name was not Sapphire, but something else. She is fucking autistic as shit, she first call herself Saphire in front of the class, and then complains when people call her that.   that logic tho       I want to know why are they still here.    sapphire's her real name, she prefers to be called midori  how hard is this to grasp wtf      This was explained word for word in the first couple of episodes.     that ass     Her parents gave her a stupid bullshit American hippy name so in an attempt to fit in she just wants people to call her Midori, like, you know, a normal japanese high school girl. It's not a hard concept to grasp.      these  it seems anon was the real autist here       The cool kids strike back.  YAMEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO   And why is the great Neo New Shingo Sawatari not considered a cool kid?    Nice Ruri.    It's an exclusive club, no losers allowed.    NEVER THE PUREST LOVE WILL NEVER STOP    6th for irrelevant decks people want put on the banlist   I'm with that Anon, Sawatari belongs. Serena can't be part of it without her dumb comedy husbando.    He isn't missing or put into solitary confinement.     tfw Crystal Beasts gets pendulum cards and becomes absolutely broken     I just want Releaser to not be banned. I don't know what I'll do if that happens.  Yeah search for other ways but it will be harder now.      Try petitioning next year, maybe you'll get in.    Yuto's Passionate Soul  This is better than it has any right to be.     Purest   Vampire Vamp   And with that pic  secretkek       But Crystal Beasts already have Pendulums      I recruited him though even after he lost like a bitch.    See  And they're still shit  Djinn lock is some bullshit, but I don't really see why it would be banned unless the lock forced a 1-deck format  Also, we've been promised Jack and... No Jack. What the Hell Konami        <br/>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-9N<wbr>BvsmQ2Ik</wbr>  [ ] http://ygorganization.com/ocg-06222<wbr>015-ocg-japan-and-china-decklists/ tfw being on top </wbr>    Would Sawataris papa approve of Serena?   This should of been called Academies theme  http://<span>youtu.be/2ieZ6qQ9818  [ ]     He'd have to.     Nobody is using Berserker soul in raccoons.dek  Brb making Berkser Raccoons     Playing in TCG is like playing OU in Pokemon (unless you are in showderp).   Reiji's chibi doesn't even look chibi.   There's also other Serena expressions that isn't shown in the manzai, but appears in the website's "Duel School" flash app.     dat flustered Serena      flustered Serena  My heart and dick are in unison.     I like the second's second panel how is he like "Oh crap what I have to say now?"  If she get this cute I may start to like her. I am really into these moe cute faces with tsundere traits, that's something Yuzu sadly didn't achieve for me.       Actual Berserker Soul is nothing compared to its anime counterpart. If it was I would've already made Superheavy Berserker Samurais   When will they just fucking go on a date?   When they reunite.    Don't worry, she still likes you.  It's not like Nekroz really need it, more if you consider that Book of Eclipse is basically a big fuck you to Rituals with Releaser in general, unless they control something like Forbidden Lance. And to be honest, after the big bullshit it was the Agent deck (in my opinion, the most annoying lock deck), I feel Djinn-lock are not that hard to deal with it. I can see Book of Eclipse getting hitted at some point though. And Jack will return in Dimension of Chaos, unless you refer to anime. If that's the case.  KONAMIIIIIIIIII          When will they just fuck?  Now that's more like it. And hopefully we can get an exclusive OVA with that. Itadaki! Seieki animation.     Tfw no masochistic tomato     Only 500 dmg per draw   Implying you couldn't STEADFASTU DRAW with Susano'o  That's 7000 damage, isn't it? I mean, what could make the combo stronger?     did Zexal have this much QUALITY moments?    Yuzu sadly didn't achieve for me.   That's nothing to be said about, Yuzu's a horrible character and has been sense day one, she's just another Kotori. No matter what the Yuzufags will tell you.     So if the one who drew pic-related is one of the artists who occasionally draws for ARC-V, especially the DVD covers, this is Serena's full attire in the ED, isn't it?   This last episode was filled with QUALITY.    And Yuya looked more like a girl than usual, I guess the koreans got confused on his gender.    How about FUCK YOU    I'm not sure but I feel like it would still be more fun with the anime effect and just be able to attack indefinitely with a superheavy samurai.    It's a very nice outfit.    Come at me, Yuzufag, I'll wake that head of yours posthaste.    Oh yes, the girl deeply connected to the plot and is a major character and comptent duelist is a useless cunt that cries out the protagonist name while getting in the way and contributing nothing whatsoever to the plot.    Double teaming me now? You yuzufags are into some kinky shit.    Or, wait. The card only allows it's usage when you do 1500 or less damage. Which means it's basically useless in Superheavy sams and shit in Raccoon's.    He's just shitposting, anon, I can't believe you took the bait.    Yo, I don't think she is horrible, just it doesn't suit for me, the only ones who maded this far were Masumi and (to some extent) Mieru. She is cool, funny and likeable but not my favourite, that's all.  Calm down, anon.       the koreans  was this episode actually made by koreans or are you just rusing me     Korean animation studio.    I mean let's make a venn diagram in our heads.  Overlap: Female. No cowtits. Love Interest for the lead.   Kotori: Yuma.wav. Fanservice. Barely ever duels. Yuma don't give a fuck, totally devoted to Yuma anyway.   Yuzu: Appears without Yuya in frame ever, Duels fairly often and has an improvement arc. Crude and strong. Could probably be convinced Yuya is a bad, given enough evidence.   Nah. Points for b8 tho        Post any waifu or cardfu you want to be yours. Pic related, except that I don't have photoshop and used something I found in my folder.  Just imagine that Ladydevimon is Vampire Vamp and it will be enough    It's not like I'm into a crude, strong girl!     Could probably be convinced Yuya is a bad, given enough evidence.  Now lets not go that far.      strong.   I'll give you that, No normal girl could break a piece of high tech in a punch. But that's it. She hasn't had a duel for 17 episodes and she did nothing but lose after her "I got gud" duel against the fodder who lost easily to captain falcon.      It's been foreshadowed.  First she doubted that Yuto was a different person, even though he was worlds more violent than Yuya (in her eyes at the time), then Gon outright saying "You didn't believe in Yuya?!"   misunderstandings       your waifu/cardfu is shit, Selena best girl, selena a cute    She's the series Jounouchi. She gets Yuya's sloppy jobbers to prove she's gotten better at the game. And really the only characters consistently dueling onscreen at the moment are Yuya, Shun, and maybe Dennis.    Oh it's going to happen especially when he EGAO and noms Yugo.     a Digimon with a pregnancy test  It may look like a hot chick but it isn't a real woman. Digimon have no define sex Anon...    Why is Serena such a miracle of the universe and dimensions?    Yuzu slap.gif  wait what the fuck? that wasn't in the latest episode or its trailer for the next one.    Guess the father.   Yuya?    I just realized that they're dressed like Johan  Am I retarted      Jonouchi was not a bad duelist at all, he should have beaten Marik and won plenty of important duels. Technically he became the King of Games after Battle City, he had to beat Yugi to get back his Red Eyes. It might not have been shown, but he did get his Red Eyes back.    Yuri.    Oh don't start that bullshit here, anon. "Digimon has no sex" it's an annoying delusion from moralfags and nostalgiafags who don't want any other Digimon that are human or something like that.    Sorry Rin.   A little bit Anon. A lot of the cards are based on the characters. The Legendary Gambler is a young Solomon Moto.        I never said he was a bad duelist. I did pretty much say he takes Yugi's seconds, and that's not incorrect. It's basically what his entire battle city career is.    Digimon not having genders is straight up said in the shows. Fap to them all you want, I do, but they still don't have genders, they're just data.   With that said, this fucking Greymon is like a blackhole of always hungry in Re:Digitize.      it's an edit, I don't see how Yugo could make her mad enough to bring out the fan.    Shit card Shit fu     Serena.       it's an edit  No its not, watch the preview for the next episode at the end of the current one     I wouldn't call Yuzu the Jonouchi though, I'd call Gon that if anybody, while Sawatari is the Manjourne. Yuzu is more like the Asuka.    What about her younger form?   At the next banlist, an errata is announced.   Cyber Dragon Nova   This card must first be Xyz Summoned with the above materials.    y/n         he should have beaten Marik  Dude that's nothing to be proud of at all, he would have even lost to Mai if it wasn't for the random chuuni chant needed for Ra Did Marik even get a single legit win?      REVOLUUUUTIOOOOON    You can't tell me what to do.    That's a boy.       This is poor bait     Yugo: So have you guys kissed yet?   Yuzu: Wha-?!       That's a boy.   Implying Yuya would give a fuck if Yuzu had a fat delicious cock       Falling for bait.     Yuzu   Asuka  That's literally saying she's irrelevant to the series anon.  Yuzu seems like the Jounouchi due to how ARC-V emphasizes her importance second to Yuya. Gon barely isn't even important to the overarching plot.  If she isn't, then she's pretty much a whole new class of character herself.             I believe Yami Marik beat Yami Bakura/Marik legit, otherwise no, he didn't win a single duel without Shadow Realm and Chuuni Chant shenanigans.    Since Yuya, Yuzu, and Gon are seemingly meant to be the power trio, I'm pretty sure they're going for something completely new.    It wasn't the coreans this time, by taking 3 seconds to check the credits. It was Studio Blanc, and their episodes being full of QUALITY is nothing new. They're awful, I hope they eventually get dropped for a studio that can at least do a passable job.    nigga i don't read nip.    I doubt it was that, after all, she's not got that red blush.     Since Yuya, Yuzu, and Gon are seemingly meant to be the power trio  The concept of a power trio is as irrelevant here as it was in GX and early 5Ds    Shun do not click this image.   Still, Yuya/Yuzu/Gon is as close as you can get since they get portrayed as such in things like the second OP and the cover for Hanate.    Too late.    Is that the touMAN I see?    Poor Gon sure doesn't get to act like a member of the power trio though.     Still, Yuya/Yuzu/Gon is as close as you can get since they get portrayed as such in things like the second OP and the cover for Hanate.  Reiji would fit better than Gon if you want to force it     Everyone has a power trio this time around.    Main Characters  Yuya, Yuzu, Gon  Cool Kids  Reiji, Serena, Shun  Crazy Fusions  Shun, Yuri, Leo  etc. you get the point, only one that isn't part of a trio is Sawatari and he's too Neo New for that shit.             Not yet at least, but he and Yuzu still get most of the non-protagonist duels (even if Yuzu hasn't dueled for awhile), along with Shun.    Bakura, apparently. I'm looking at the Duel Script now and there's no shenanigans but.   Bakura plays Exchange   Takes Ra   Marik takes Monster Reborn   Bakura had a useless normal monster and a Spirit Message in his hand  I dunno if we can call this legit, because Bakura apparently suffered a brain aneurysm when he activated Exchange.            Hurp, meant to reply to     I'm catching up on Zexal in between episodes of Arc-V, and the production values are surprisingly strong. The soundtrack too. Really, if there was less 'Yuma being an idiot' stuff eating entire episodes whole, and great (female) secondary characters getting constantly shafted, Zexal would have been a very solid series.     Studio Blanc  I don't see any of that though. All I see are a bunch of names, Studio Wanpack, and Ace Company Studio Mark.      Sawatari, New Sawatari, and Neo New Sawatari are their own power trio      Not yet at least, but he and Yuzu still get most of the non-protagonist duels  Gon has dueled more than Yuzu       Bakura was a shit duelist. he only ever got one legit win that wasn't a straight up lose or no result and that was against that Bonz character.    And Bonz lost against Joey's normal monster with like 800 attack    Shun has dueled more than her too. Serena is right there with her too.     Shun under Crazy Fusions   Shun is not a member of Academia.  Yet.       Of course.  Meant Sora, guess I have the burning passion of revolution on my mind thanks to Sound Duel 3.      Never said they dueled the same amount.    I don't blame you, those Yuto and Shun themes were great.    To be honest, Yuzu doesn't look like she's meant for dueling anyway. It looks like she's meant to be someone who goes looking for plot action.  Although this time around, her role is to see things on the other side of the story, at least on Yugo's side.      I really miss Yuto, he was too young and too pure.     Yuzu doesn't look like she's meant for dueling anyway.  She spouts about how she's an entertainment duelist all the time when she duels. She's going to duel plenty more, just give it time.     Where does one find sound duels? I've been trying to track down the 5ds ones for a while now, and can't seem to find a decent site with them.  Also, I can't believe I somehow missed that Arc-v's 2nd AND 3rd osts were released.     He'll be back one day, be patient.    Someone had a mega of it yesterday or the day before. I don't have it anymore, but I'm sure someone here does.    What or who could possibly crack the crude exterior for Serena to act like that?    I-i will    Yours truly.         tfw I actually spend 20 minutes to do this   tfw I really have free time right now  I admit I had a lot of fun doing this, and also admit I never expected to be more or less good in photoshop.         His straw is broken    I need Yuzus. Post more Yuzus.   Lewd is preferred.     No lewd.    Sometimes you just get mad you aren't invited to the table to spend time with a Ruri.   No.       I need Yuzus  What for?     Ruris are only for cute.    Sorry, I only have a bunch of cute Serenas to share with.     Shun dressed up like J Jonah Jameson   I need pictures, PICTURES OF RURIS        Jesus, he really looks like Sonic there.    I didn't even notice he did honestly, but I'm glad you pointed it out, got a laugh out of me.    Obviously    You haven't seen things yet.    Shun looks uncomfortable.     Rins hair reminds me of amy     Found it in the archives, thanks for the tip.     Yuya is Knuckles   Yugo is Sonic   Yuto is Shadow  You're bending my head like a pretzel, Arc-V        Sonic   Sora   Manjourne   Whoever the fuck Yuri looks like   No prob.        Ayye, did I miss something or did Sawatari get his duel disk back while Yuya didn't? I also saw the blocks of the action spell Crossover.   And Yuri is Amy.   Also I love Serena, but I can't be the only one that dislikes how they draw her blue strands do I? They look more like a head band than her hair.     I feel triggered but I don't know why    Yuto is Manjoume      Sometimes you just get mad you aren't invited to the table to spend time with a Ruri.   It's the flashbacks.        How is a landlord related to circus animals?     that filename     Getting kinda cthuluy, Yuya.    Why is Yuto such a brute?    My skin stated crawling when I noticed those baby crabs.     Yuto's shitty little money pile.  What's wrong, Yuto, couldn't pick the  SILENTO BOOTS?     <br/>   Its symbolism about how the harder Yuya tries to incorporate egao into his life the more he corrupts and misunderstands it       see your art posted like a year later  Feels good.        This game is hard   I don't understand it   Where are the dragons       You should make more.    I really like the touches on the monopoly one.  Shun clearly taking them to school and Yuzu is getting butthurt   Yuto has already been cleaned out, has no money or properties left.    Name has Kaiba in it and 'Go to Shadow Realm' space.         tfw only buildings level up   tfw character creation screen is shit   tfw 2d6       We need more pictures Anon.   who infernoid here? vanitys sadlife     &gt;Serena dies the same way, passing her Moonlight Cat Dancer to Yuzu.     I PUT TWO HOTELS ON MY RAILROAD    Holy shit, I think I dimly remember you posting them the first time  What the fuck have I done with my last year       Give it to them...to everyone's future...with your power...   Tits.   And then Yuzu punches her.       Dunno what you are talking about, vanity btfo by galaxy cyclone or Dekatron.    I draw for you guys all the time. Pic related was me.  I draw a disgusting amount of Yuri and Serena http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=50351463 </wbr>        Yuto is /tg/  What boards would other Yugiohs use?  Yusei is /o/   Anime Judai is /co/ while manga Judai is /m/   Reiji is /biz/          Serena dies   I'm just waiting on some more Raid Raptors or D/D/D stuff before I get back into it, or on Moonlight/Troupe/Phantom Knights.   I'll probably try out IgKnights too, they look cool.        More monopoly then or other children's games then, like the game of Life.     Rua is /toy/   Ruka is /an/   Crow is /ck/       I want to draw the Yus playing Sorry now fuck      GX Yugi is /fit/      Sawatari is /fa/.     Not maining dank-o-tron     Good, do it.    Yugi gets swoll and stops being a manlet   /fit/ would be proud.        I'll post it tomorrow night, I need to sleep stat.   Now I just want tons of kids playing board games   Sora playing Candyland and everybody having to stop him from licking the board.   Gongenzaka trying to play jenga with his giant hands.   Yuya playing twister and his coat gets in everybody else's face.        Good I'll be waiting since I'm sure Re:Digitize will piss me off with how much meat these fuckers consume.    God help Yuzu if Ruri's a cow.     Shun and Yuto playing Chess   Shun flips the board screaming REVOLUTION   Yugo playing Checkers with Yuzu   Yugo does a Synchro Checkers Chuuni Chant when he combines two pieces into a King        Ruri is pretty much guaranteed to be flat.     SPREAD THOSE WONDROUS, GLOWING CIRCLES AND TRANSPORT ME TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BOARD AT LIGHT SPEED!   Jump, jump, jump.        Shun is definitely /m/.     OH RED CIRCLE SHINING BRIGHT ON THIS CHECKERED FIELD, BRING FORTH A KING OF ABSOLUTE POWER   CHEKKA SHOKAN   Yugo is still on his bike the entire time        Serena is playing chess with Roger   Yuya and Yuzu come by and ask "Hey guys, whatcha doing?"   Roger grabs two more pieces and drops them on his side of the board.      I wonder if Yugi and Kaiba will get chants for Dark Magician and Blue Eyes White Dragon. wait, do they do chants for advance summon?    wait, do they do chants for advance summon?  Im pretty sure Strong did one for Barbarian King      Shun is playing Connect Four with Yuto   They're both trying to overlay the pieces   They don't, but they're gonna get Synchro and Xyz cards, especially considering Dark Magician has an Xyz and Blue Eyes a Synchro. Hell they might even give them Pendulum, it'd make getting Kaiba's Blue Eyes a lot easier.       Yuzu did one for Mozart too.     They don't, but they're gonna get Synchro and Xyz cards, especially considering Dark Magician has an Xyz and Blue Eyes a Synchro. Hell they might even give them Pendulum, it'd make getting Kaiba's Blue Eyes a lot easier.   Silent Swordsman and Silent Magician synchro retrains when? I love those two monsters and I don't want them forgotten about there's just something special about the partnership of a physical and magical attacker working together to overwhelm their foes.      Well they gave Horus one so maybe we could get some LV retrains in later packs for sake of nostalgia.    Probably never honestly, I'd imagine some of the other cards getting Synchros instead.    playing Love Live   see a cute card girl   Name: Shun Kurosaki   mfw        Metaphys Horus is a Synchro   Metaphys Armed Dragon is a crappy normal monster  gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay      Shun a cute.    Wasn't there some spoiler fag wayyy back months ago saying something about retrained LV monsters? I mean they called the master of pendulum structure deck as well as the 3 Odd eyes extra deck monsters. But I absolutely refuse to believe we are getting a Miracle fusion card that works for every fusion monster. Can you imagine how bullshit that would be?     anime Breaker is 1500   card Breaker is 1600  Konami are laughing their ass off.      What the hell are you talking about? It's 1600.    In the anime, Breaker had its ATK lowered by 100 by some spell card of Haga's. It was 1600.      I really gotta clean up my Arc-V folders...and you aren't helping dammit.    Speed Spell - The End of the Storm   This card can be activated by removing 8 of your Speed Counters. Destroy all monsters on the field and inflict 300 damage to each player for each of their destroyed monsters that were sent to the Graveyard.

Proceed to her faint from embarrassment and then get kidnapped when Academia attacks.   Got a new computer, looking to download Ygopro again. But I can't remember where I got it last time. Whereabouts can I find that Percy one? That worked much better than Devpro.    Not sure why would you want Percy instead of Devpro when there are much better players in the latter.    Are you talking about the percival one for android? If so, it should be on google play or percival18's blog somewhere.   Otherwise ygopro's site should have everything.       using Devpro to play other people   ever       playing Yugioh at all  Come to the other side folks.     Why are magicfags so insecure?    Cause nobody wants to play vintage with me  ;_;    I'm leaving this here as a reminder. http://exhentai.org/g/813747/4f79ac<wbr>1776/</wbr>    Aww, that panda looks sad. I'd give him a hug.

Then he got killed by St. George.    Where the fuck did Yuya pull all of those new Pendulum magic cards out of. His ass? Well, this is a prison arc after all.   Maybe he'll start channeling the power of Yuto instead of the power of EGAO.  Well considering he pulled them out of thing air in the first place, probably, or Reiji made them.     YAMEROOOOO  Now that's alpha.   HANASE      UAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH        YAMERO JA NAI  YUGO DA      Shun finally gets to talk next episode. I wonder what he's gonna say after that.    RR  Ruri Revolution~      Ruri Falcon when? Yuya can't just hog all the waifucards.    When we find out that Ruri is actually his pet falcon that he got because his real little sister died long long ago.   http://<span>youtu.be/Xbfekqs-7Kk  [ ]   DUSTY ROBE      For every waifu card someone else gets, Yuya will get two more waifu cards. Eventually he'll be able to go an entire duel only summoning Yuzus.   Odd-Eyes counts as a Yuzu.      Why does it feel so good to beat Odd Eyes Magician with pure Performapal   Because you are bad at games    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=v1x<wbr>FDbtqBmE</wbr>  [ ]     Hey Selena, how many did you get to beat?      Yuzu eats Serena    gets a green eye   eventually eats Ruri to get a pink eye   She is now Odd-Eyes    Serena ends up with a better record   it dejects Shun as a man            Serena ends up with a better record   There is only one way to settle it then.      You wouldn't hit a Ruri would you Shun?    He's not trying to hit her, Selena is just being difficult.    Difficult girls are best girls.    I wish they could surprise everyone and have him deck her or reject her outright, for whatever justifiable reason. The woes would fly with "Oh, he doesn't love Ruri anymore," when in fact it would just prove he's well aware that she certainly isn't Ruri at all.  The sooner that complacent stereotype is kill, the better.      To be fair he doesn't really seem to pay her any attention or give two shits about her. I don't even remember if he's even commented on her looking like Ruri, maybe once briefly?   Most of the stuff is just headcanon pairings and stuff with them, they seem rather indifferent to each other, they're just similar brutes, and only opposites attract.      Why on earth would he hit the person who saved his life?    At this point he probably figured out the AU counterparts thing. If anything I'm worried he'll run into the actual Ruri and go goddamnit another clone     The only fuel to the flames so far is that he looks at her/Yuzu obscurely, which everybody translates as "He's thinking of the Ruri." when in fact he's just wondering if he could ask one of them to sew the torn bits on the bottom of his coat back together.     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tdk<wbr>hQi_iEO4</wbr>  [ ]     I'm surprised nobody comments on their clothes or hair or anything. They only ever comment on their faces looking the same. I get that maybe they're supposed to look the exact same completely and they just look different for the sake of the viewer, but even then the clothes should give it away most of the time or their general height, size of the tits, eye color, or something.     To be fair he doesn't really seem to pay her any attention or give two shits about her.   He gave enough shits about her to fight for her despite his serious injuries. And tell her the truth about his dimension when prompted to by her despite refusing to do so earlier to Reiji. Not to mention he stayed with the Lancers because she asked him to.     Yusei fight for future, earth got xyz Yuma defend earth from d1k and whatever that thing in alternate retcon universe, we earth got pendulum. I don't buy Yugioh reprint after R now look what our publisher throw at us.      I'm guessing crazy hair colors and hair style in Yugioh are just as common as blonde or brown hair here.  So they might assume that they just dyed their hair (which also seems to be more common in YGO. I think it was confirmed that Yugi actually dyes his hair?).  I mean if you ran into your best friend you knew since childhood and he simply had blonde hair would you not recognize him? We just have to raise our suspension of disbelief to anime logic.  And they actually do recognize the clothes. Yuzu thought Yuto was Yuya changing into a costume and Serena and Yuzu swapped clothes to make Obelisk go after Yuzu          Insult me, fair enough. Insult my Mother, shame on you. Insult my cards, you're a dead man. Insult my comrades, hell hath no fury. Insult my Sister, WHITE WHALE, HOLY GRAIL        Well the hair dye makes since to a degree, but not for You Show to believe Serena was Yuzu, she wouldn't have had time to just go dye her hair during a Battle Royale.   Also as far as Yugi I don't think so. His grandpa's when he was younger was dark gray/blackish and gold.      Sawatari's papa was carded by Shun and nobody noticed    Why is she still in her Academia uniform in these?    Sawatari probably really doesn't care to be honest, he's too busy trying to impress the strong willed girl and save the universe.   How would you guys fill if Neo New Sawatari started using NEOS.      Translation?     New Sawatari started using NEOS.  It's a trash card that fits him perfectly     he gets a reprint thats worth using. Neo Neos Sawatari    Whoa, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. We do not talk about the new WAITO like this.     Neapolitan Summons   Strawberry: Fusion   Chocolate: Xyz   Vanilla: Synchro   Sawatari is gonna be great as this goes on, he'll stop sucking eventually. I mean he's not completely useless, he has helped quite a bit surprisingly.        Was Reiji trying to give Shun a Yosenju card? or Funky Comedian? or his own personal RaidRaptor Pendulum?   It was a ruri imouto card and he got upset about it.    It was Risebell. He didn't take it well.    It was this card.   Meanwhile in Academia, Yuri and Sora are being irrelevant doing irrelevant things for another 10-30 episodes because MUH SYNCHRO DIMENSION.    Reiji tried to give him Ruri Pendulum.   Shun gets annoyed and leaves, saying he doesn't need Pendulums.   Reiji tries to recruit Yugo by making a Rin Pendulum   Yugo goes full MISUNDERSTANDINGS and thinks that Reiji carded Rin because fuck logic.   We get Yuya vs Yugo   I'm just talking out of my ass right now just because.   But seriously, how much of a dick move would it be if Yuri learns how to Pendulum Summon after being told by Leo/Sora/Dennis... and the first Pendulums that Yuri gets is a Ruri Pendulum and a Rin Pendulum, setting both in the scales. It would NEVER happen for obvious reasons but it would troll the shit out of Shun or Yugo if Yuri dueled one of them.             Or Fusion Dimension is taking this time to prepare to invade Standard.    I can definitely see it happening but it's going to have a drawback.

My name is Smug-chan and I have a pee fetish.    perfect level of smug.                I rarely see discussions about Manwha, so I decided to make a little thread it.  I'll start by posting the whore that has pissed me off more than Enju from Dice.    Want a godlike manwha? Go read Shin Angyo Onshi.  gook shit is not /a/ related   So where should we talk about it? Most manga sites have manwha anyways.    Not anime or manga  Dice is the best webtoon.   U misspelled red storm   Anon, would you a ho?  manhwa is horrible. I absolutely hate the current flood of shitty manhwa comics that are more akin to western comics than to manga. They often suffer from a ridiculous plot line, poorly drawn art and also, copy famous manga to a sickening extent. Don't even get me started on chinese ''manga'' which is so bad it makes me wonder if the chinese are invested with any modicum of creativity, if at all.  Stop appropriating Japanese art culture you sub-human gooks no one likes your shit.     It's should be /a/   Because Manhua and Manhwa is literally what Manga is pronounced in Chinese and Korean respectively. Just like how you don't differentiate between Onee-chan and Sister normally. Anyway I've never seen a janitor 404 a manhua thread yet, not that they usually last very long.       They often suffer from a ridiculous plot line, poorly drawn art and also, copy famous manga to a sickening extent  So, nothing different from manga, then?     This    Ouch, that hurts.    anywhere but here    Tower of god is great, what I don't like is the lame clothes of the character there.      GET THE FUCK OUT OF /A/ YOU GOOKS ! GO READ YOUR SUB-PAR STUPID WEBCOMICS ELSEWHERE      It's hard to take "badass" character seriously when they look like skater punks.   I like manhwa and I read them from time to time, but holy fuck why most of them run for 300 chapters? While the stories are not bad, they tend to drag it so fucking much it gets me fucking angtsy and I just read the wiki. Tower of God, dice, and Girls of the wild and 3 big examples of mad dragging.  Jack Frost is best manhwa.  Daily reminder that The Breaker's team are the biggest bitches in the manwha industry.  Post the zombie hunters.     tower of god   girl backstabbing best boy    we learn that her only motivation is just to watch stars   wtfamireading.jpg       subhuman shit   Fuck off.     Possible 1-2 year hiatus. Why do they do this to us.   Is there something wrong with  Godoka sites?  I am getting ssl_error_rx_record_too_long  Also did you guys read some Chinese Manhwa like Long Hu Men? It didn't have a nice story but still enjoyable.      Just like anything, majority of them are total shit. There's definitely great hidden gems, though most are untranslated.  Gook shit is usually abysmal with a few exceptions, but Tower of god is indeed really good.   I read Chinese Manhua to see them throw sparkly things at each other and shout their moves which can destroy planets and stuff. Most of them are more Dragon ball than Dragon ball and 10x as ridiculous.   Rak is best boy.    I rarely see discussions about Manwha  They happen occasionally. Sometimes they last long. But no one wants to put up with the "lel, gook shit doesn't belong in /a/" despite evidence to the contrary.  Anyways, that reminds me that I haven't read the last two or so chapters of ToG. Also, when was The Gamer supposed to start back up?   Slut. Almost as shit as Rachel.           /a/ Thoughts on Overlord?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RuN<wbr>APPcjDr4</wbr>  [ ]     tfw they'll call it a SAO rip-off   Life as Skeletor.   Its 2spooky4me    illustrations showing dark and horrifying setting   actual series is just as metal   wonder if Madhouse will put this series off.      Hopefully some tidbits make their way to West from the next weekend's pre-screening event. Though I doubt we will get another PV since it airs on 7th for real, iirc.   Where were you when Demiurge discovered that Albedo had steel abs?  Well, it'll be a fresh breath of air after all the cutesy trash they air now a days.   I'd rather see her tail or Papa Bones' legs.   I read the web novel and dropped it a few chapters in. It's another self insert RPG manga where the MC gets literally everything handed to him because he's the MC. Pretty fucking bad.  Manga chapter 7 when?   But this series still has lots of pandering and wish fullfilment. Its just presented in a different, more digestible wraping. Doesnt mean it doenst have pandering and wish fullfilment like every other LN under the moon.      Overrated anime of the season alongside Gangsta.  I'll be watching Skeletor's battles but besides that I don't give a shit.     Anime character design problems:  Ainz's spaulders. Albedo doesn't have enough frills. Shalltear's lopsided dress. Aura's lack of whip. Mare's lack of silver necklace. Demiurge's boney face. Cocytus's icebergs. Sebastian's chest and hands.            Gangsta is overrated?  Always seemed like a pretty niche thing only 5 people on /a/ were interested in, me included. Same deal here, only theres a bigger handful of people.      If anything, God Eater will be overrated since the normies are all fangasming over 'MUH UFOTABLE'    Gangsta is pretty hyped outside of /a/. Expect it to be popular.  Also, why is are Overlord sprites never updated on time? Literally takes 2-3 days after reaching 200 new followers or 50 retweets.      Weird, I would expect it to not be popular with all the prostitution and drugs themes in it, but I guess those things atract quite the audience.  People must be expecting it to be like Cowboy Beboop or Black Lagoon. Wonder how censored it will be. And I wonder how many "this is outrageous" and "think of the children" scandals it will bring.        normies  Normalfags, they are called normalfags Jesus Christ.     If anything, I know /a/ will hate it because of the fujoshit boogieman and the fact that the main girl is a literal prostitute.     People must be expecting it to be like Cowboy Beboop or Black Lagoon.  People is stupid, no big surprise here.   I wonder how many "this is outrageous" and "think of the children" scandals it will bring.  Why would you care what this "people" think.        fujoshit boogieman? You talking about the supersoldier lesbian couple? Cause if anything that will cause a bigger /v/tard-tier uproar, along with katana brainwashed twin sister.  If anything the main girl being a literal prostitute would be refreshing for /a/, but it could go either way since she has a "oh what a useless female" moments in the begining. I rather quite like her character and seeig her develop.   Inevitably whatever this "people" do will get reported here so I do care. I further care because like it or not we are part of this "people".          From what I've seen, the two new shows being hyped are Gangsta and God Eater.  Gangsta is drawing attention precisely because of violence and drugs. God Eater because of Ufotable.  Going by Twitter, they're leading in follows with Gangsta at 13.5K and God Eater at 24.6K.         God Eater is the usual post apocalyptic teens with weapons anime. ANY show with those things are bound to be popular. Post apocalyptic anything is popular even harems.   I'm sure they're expecting it to be Black Lagoon. You also underestimate how edgy normals can be about their anime. I always thought /a/ would be the cesspool of internet anime. Oh no, there's much worse going on out there.       I predict Gangsta will get a psycho-pass-like following, at least at the begining. If they manage to not fuck up the anime it could even become the new Black Lagoon for some people. Though tbh Im still scratching my head at how they are gonna pace things since it doesnt feel like the first arc is even done yet in the manga. Probly anime original ending since theres not enough material for a season 2 or a story arc for a season 1.      WHEN I SAY GANGSTA YOU SAY NIGGA  GANGSTA       Stop.     MC didnt choose to play a lesbian succubus   so much wasted potential      And it's bit sad only some of those can be attributed to the need to simplify so-bin's art so it's actually doable for animators/budget.    /a/ is one of the few places on the english-speaking internet anyone can enter and have a proper discussion about anime without any stupid filters or rules, provided you go to the right thread at the right time. Like most things on 4chan it is a pile of shit-stained straw with the ocasional diamond in it that makes it worth it. Yes, there are much, much worse places out there. Good god there are. May you never have to step foot in them.     More like MC didn't choose the roleplay lesbian succubus dorm master and all the servants were girls of varying ages.  Would have been best world conquest ever.      I honestly wish there was a series about some otaku that got sucked into an rpg world and it turned out he was as much of a worthless piece of shit as he was in real life.  The whole LN concept where this "normal" guy uses his "gaming smarts" to just completely bowl over some game world is just retarded. What's the point? What's the great story here? Them crushing the competition like it's nothing and sucking the tension out of every scene? What vacuous waste of animation money he's gonna impregnate? To see the same tropes get subverted in the same way ad nauseum?  Come on.         If those were underdesigned so that they can be animated properly then I expect decent animation. So far the trailer does not impress on that regard.     I have an argument against that.  When I was watching Log Horizon back then S1 had this animation friendly style. Everything was seamless even when the scenes got QUALITY. Then S2 boasted about how they were going to be true to the light novel art. It didn't translate very well to the silver screen.  It's not a bit sad when you think about it.           Not that anon but I think the fujoshit boogieman he was referring to was this kind of thought process  oh there are two male characters   must BE FUCKING FUJOSHIT TIME TO SPAM THREADS ABOUT IT GUCBSNCJDBF  That kind of nonsense although it will definitely be a free pass for fujoshit works          May you never have to step foot in them.  I regret to admit I participated in some of them in the past. But I've learned my lesson. Even after becoming somewhat of a normalfag this is the only place I'll discuss anime.    it turned out he was as much of a worthless piece of shit as he was in real life.  I know of two series like that, people who are very proud of their depravity. One is Highschool DxD and the other is a manga I forgot the title, but is about this neet named Niito who became a monster hunter when his mom died and he couldn't mooch off of her anymore.            using DEEN for a fair comparison     Theres probably plenty of LNs in which the MC stays worthless but those dont sell to the auduence that is looking for LNs for escapism. They probably gte filed under NTR-like fetishims. Youre looking at an industry that has grown fat from pandering and pandering sells and what sells gets animated so pandering gets animated. Theres probably some really fucking good material out there but you would have to find it first.   We are all a sum of our experiences so theres nothing to regret dude. All that matters is what you take home with you.          Hey if you've got other examples I'm all ears. I'm just saying, being true to the source art doesn't always translate to the big screen well.    Oh that shit.  Everything with more than one non-MC male character gets called fujoshit these days, even Shokugeki no Souma gets called that. Its like nerds are insecure that if their self-insert isnt the only noticeable cock in the neighborhood it will ruin the experience for them or something.      As long as they keep all the macabre humor and humanity is weak and the Nazarick attitude, I'll just shrug it off.  Since those are the major components to the actual tone of the series and the cast being what they're in novels.      The Gangsta manga is shit, dropped it quickly.    True but it could also be a mockup and the scene itself doesn't have that much motion either way. We'll see how bad it is when Ainz plays around in the Arena and the Lemegeton prior to that.    They may need to tone down/cut some aspects of the story to fit the censors/budget/time/pacing/etc. of the show.  Like the twins fighting the fire elemental at the start shit like that can be cut out and replaced with far more budget-firendly things. This is reasonable. I just hope we dont get too many "they changed/cut this tiny thing so it sucks" threads/atittudes.   Heres your reply.           It's strictly in the same genre as black lagoon, jormungand, noir etc  so yeah I'm fine with some gangsta loving      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127106072  Shits pretty common everywhere on the internet, its part of human culture. Its just a matter of dealing with it, or not and moving on.  Even if you point out the double standard most people will wave it off with some lame justification. Better to just shrug, laugh and leave it, though there is a time and place for everything.      Who the hell is writing these summaries for the anime previews?  Most of these literally begin with "The story revolves around", "The manga follows", The story takes place in", "A romantic comedy set in", etc.   Do they not have any creativity?       They are souless anime watchers of course they have had every ounce of creativity sucked dry from them by all the moeblobs and pandering. Just look at what it did to Kentaro Miura the poor bastard.     There probably are plenty, they just didn't sell and no translator has any interest in them.    Another SAO ripoff with MC just another reskin gary stu that gets everything handed to him. Just beceause he looks like a skeleton doesnt mean shit everything is copy pasted from SAO with extra editing to look appealing for the edgy viewers that likes to masturbate to this garbage.    Please, this is clearly a Danmachi ripoff with the MC getting everything handed to him, and everything in the video game is on his boner.    Nah, this is Log Horizon ripoff.    Nah this is a Matrix ripoff      It's clearly a rip-off of Boku no Hack    I'll be going in for Manglobe and maybe they can deliver something good after their previous oddities.    450k views in 2 days. Holy shit      Mar 22  Not Jun 22     This is a Sharknado spinoff.    It's Madoka ripoff.    It's the 'LN Novel Superlong Title For The Sake Of Lazy Synopsis On The Spine/Front Equivalent For Lazy Reader's Allusion To Something He Might Have Liked In Past'.    I freaking wish.    For some reason I think that Overlord might have more international following than moonland alone. The novel has been licensed officially in ch and kr already.   What does /a/ think of the season 2?  Everything was so dull, and they tried so hard to be edgy. I liked the original but had a hard time finishing this crap.  Will the movie be as bad?       There is a second season? I've heard on /a/ that there isn't one.   It was okay but I was hoping that there would be a lot more Akane suffering. I really want to see her broken.  after seeing the new girl in the last episode and the first like 10 minutes of the first of season 2, i dropped it. there's very few times where a character has actually ruined an anime for me but this is one of them. she's such a cunt  i dunno, does /a/ think i should give it another shot? i haven't heard rave reviews about season 2      but I mean where do you go next with a scifi series like this?   You don't go anywhere. S1 was great and had a proper conclusion, why couldn't they leave it at that? Did Da Vinci think the Last Supper needed continuation and added dracula and frankenstein's monster in the table? No. Classics are only classics, because no one touched them after they were made. The exact same shit happened with DtB and so many other series.      I bet you think marge from the simpsons is hot too  Because thats how shit this girls design was     Is this a horse?      edition  Oh, come on anon.     You really can't fault him for that when our OPs are usually so much worse than other major threads.   Damn, all fags are sleeping or what? Let's cheer up this a bit.  Iroha fags, you can all go fuck yourselves.     fuck you too anon   iroha or death      New Chapter soon  Pastebin: http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87    Part 4 when?  can i please get the romaji for this? i've been having a really tough time with it    How many Josuke clones will Araki have to make until one of them doesn't have shit hair?     not liking best boy from the meme that makes all other memes pale in comparison   We'll settle this in the ring      SHIIIIZZZAAAAA! https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VsJ<wbr>eQWZqCpU</wbr>  [ ]    Is this an accurate depiction of Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha?   Nanoha   getting overpowered   shocked about sexual assault   There is a reason she's called the white devil.       It would be if Nanoha was Feito, Subaru was Nanoha, and Whats-her-name wasn't present.   What's the worst anime you've ever seen?  You asked for it OP.   Gantz  Filled with easily solved problems I would see in a badly written B-movie   Strike Witches/ Vividred Operation, Might as well because it felt like the same damn thing.  I tried watching this damn thing 3 times. Fanservice so blatant it's cringey, Formulaic copy pasta first season, like Gantz moments of 'WTF, why do that'.  Vividred was the fastest I've dropped an anime (seven minutes thirty seconds) and still managed to give me a literal headache.   Hyouka  I know /a/ is tired of hearing this, but I found it boring as well. The characters were uninteresting (I hate, hate, HATE Chitanda) and the first mystery was bogus as well  Hyouka = Ice Cream. Really?    Infinite Stratos  Possibly the worst harem I've seen. I didn't like Seitokai no Ichizon's cast either but that had moments of hilarity. Char was the only character I didn't hate in the end and the final episode I didn't even watch fully (alt tabbing and did other things while the player was running)                 But why is it a terrible anime? You've just said that it's terrible without basing it on anything.  "Oh, that anime is terrible but i don't know why i just hate it! hurrdurr i just want to be like all the other people who hate it"  Before you say i'm some sort of fanboy, i don't even like SAO but just because i don't like it doesn't mean it's bad.        Mahou Sensou.  SAO just had some bad writing here and there, but Mahou Sensou was shit through-and-through. Forcing myself to finish even 2 episodes was horrendous.      And then they went on to claim they were a girl, as if to solidify they were nothing more than a shitposter.    But the MAL account was for a girl, it was either legit or someone with way too much time on thier hands </blockquote>]
