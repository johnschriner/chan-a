Was happy for a while. <br> The church is burned to the ground, the Sister is killed, his brother betrays him, his sister gets kidnapped and his arm gets chopped off. <br> His arm is replaced by a magical artifact which, in exchange for power, devours the souls of the people around him, making it difficult for him to be around anyone for too long. <br> Swears revenge on the people who took everything from him. <br> Goes around destroying branches of the world government. <br> Half the characters in the series have nothing but scathing insults for him. <br> He's finally reunited with his brother, who just wants to kill him. <br> A clone of his sister loves him so much that she wants to die together with him. <br> One of the strongest warriors in the world also wants to kill him. <br> When he finally finds the guy who ruined his life, he's unable to beat him. <br> Another clone of his sister shows up and sacrifices herself for him, to his chagrin. This powers him up and lets him beat his enemy. <br> He then sacrifices his only good arm to save ANOTHER clone of his sister. <br> He then learns that his actual sister is the leader of the government he's trying to destroy. <br> Then he spends the next story getting his ass kicked around constantly due to his suddenly non-functioning arm and eye. <br> Learns that his sister is being possessed by an evil god. <br> One of his sister clones comes back to life and stabs him in the back when he tried to save her. <br> Just when he decides that he's not gonna fight for revenge but to protect what's dear to him, he gets turned into a bloodthirsty monster against his will, forced to hurt the very people he wants to protect. <br> Every single time he manages to carve out a small victory, it only plays into the villains' favor. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>fuck off</br>    If any anime character has the right to suicide, it's this girl.  <br>I'm also very interested in her backstory.</br>  <br>Dragonball is a world where fighting is literally the ONLY thing that fucking matters.

Also that now he's stuck on a boat, a little deaf, waiting to see if his retarded woman chooses to stay that way or be cognitive again, but she'll remember all that horrifying shit you did when you were possessed.</br>  Still hoping one day he can finally fucking die. It really bothers him that he cant.  <br><br> Is more easy made Adolf Hitler a good guy than Dio Brando.</br></br>    Berserk bread<br><br>I'm running out of patience Miura<br>Put an end to the torture</br></br></br>  what if he releases the full volume 38?  <br>Post best pages</br>  I stopped caring a long time ago.Why should i when he doesn't  <br>Even Miura has run out of patience for Miura. He hates Miura so much that he has stopped being Miura and does not write Berserk anymore.</br>  <br>Anon, Miura is gonna die before Berserk ends. He doesn't care anymore.<br><br>Ironically, this is the only chance for a continuation or regulation because maybe with luck, very good luck, another author pick the series.</br></br></br>    <br>I was going to post that one, good taste.</br>  Is he off the fucking boat yet?  <br>I do not understand. Why would he abandon his magnus opus? Has anyone bothered to go ask the guy what the problem is? It can't be that he can't draw anymore! He just did that pissing loli manga that nobody cared about!</br>  I want to know exactly why Berserk is being delayed so much. Is he bored of the series? Or is he sick? Is he depressed? Or maybe he's got writer's block or he's trying to work out how to deal with a big plot hole or something like that.  <br>maybe he has enough money and do what he wants</br>  <br> pissing loli manga <br>What was that? is it translated?</br></br>  <br>I'd suppose he's just lost his passion and wants to move on. It happens a lot</br>  At this point I wouldn't be surprised if he wanted it all to end. He has been drawing and writing it for 26 years.<br><br>26 Years.<br><br>However at the same time he has an obligation to at least give us an ending and not just abandoning it. Its a matter or respect and professionalism.</br></br></br></br>   anon i gonna kill myself, i can't take this anymore <br> no please, at least wait for shenmue 3 and berserk to finish <br>he still alive by the way.</br></br>  <br>Miura can't help that Cinderella Girls got animated.</br>  First three volumes in the mail, BotH Guts figma on its way. The hype cannot be contained.      <br>I guess I just can't get enough of these low angle shots.</br>  <br>The whole Lost Children arc has some great panels of Guts' berserk face.</br>  <br>Fuck, you can see the despair and rage in his eyes</br>  <br><br>Even the softer scenes in Berserk are well done though.</br></br>    Still laughing.  <br>I also enjoy the gag panels even. What makes Berserk so great is it perfectly seems to blend action, humor, drama and horror all into one.</br>    Berserk is never coming back, is it?  Im@s fan (not CG) here.<br>I'm sorry guys.<br>Really sorry ;_;</br></br>  How soon would you know if Miura is releasing a new volume? Would they make an announcement or would he just release it randomly?  gonna start looking into this whole berserk series<br><br>sounds neat</br></br>  <br><br>I still don't get how he can one hand that sword but not grip Casca when she fell off the boat. And don't tell me magnets.</br></br>  <br>write a letter to the author and ask him about it</br>  To increase the anguish let's list all the things that need to happen before the manga reaches its conclusion..<br><br>Guts needs to go through the elf island arc and probably fight the elf island boss, whoever and whatever that is.<br><br>After that and a probable power upgrade he needs to defeat all of Griffith's apostles, and since they all look formidable each one of them would probably get their own arc where they're the boss character.<br><br>Once they're dealt with we need to see Griffith taken on along with the Godhand. Again, since each one of them looks quite formidable they'd get their own arc where they get defeated as the boss of that arc with Femto as the last one standing.<br><br>So that right there are about 10 arcs or so just for those major characters, without counting in random assholes and monsters Guts might come across while traveling/reaching the major assholes.<br><br>And then of course we have Griffith/Femto's "I was pretending all along" master plan where it turns out he was doing what he was doing to defeat an ancient evil and so on so another final boss battle at the end.<br><br>Even if we condense all this into 2-3 arcs where all the apostles get dealt with in one arc and all of the godhand in another it's still way beyond any scope Miura can possibly deliver within his lifetime.<br><br>That's probably why he gave up. He overextended himself.<br><br>Same thing happened to the guy who did Bastard! and to the guy that did Alita.<br>They both kept writing their magnum opus until they got tired of it or it became so bloated nobody cares really since no end is in sight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And don't tell me magnets. <br> It's the magnets. </br></br>  <br>You know it is magnets.</br>  <br>I don't know what this means<br><br><br>Do it! I loved the anime, great soundtrack, great character development, great everything. I'm about to start the manga and then I'll watch the CGI movies as well.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>If it were in fact magnets, then the force holding the hand to the steel sword would have to be so great that separating the two would impossible.</br></br></br>   I better get this story wrapped up since it's taking way too long <br><br> chapter devoted to some lolis bathing <br> chapter devoted to Griffith standing in a flowery field with every flower rendered perfectly <br> unrelated story where a loli pees on some lughead to give him refreshment </br></br></br></br>  I watched berserk tonight with my mom not even making that up.   you will never see Guts defeat Femto and then go into berserker rage and rape his ass in front of the godhand   <br>This guy gets it. You can't even interact with him unlike fans of GRRM do.</br>  <br> unrelated story where a loli pees on some lughead to give him refreshment <br>I only sporadically join Berserk threads, I bet that Piss Wizard comic got posted all the time.</br></br>   you'll never see the skull knight slice Void's brain head in half <br><br>you just know it would happen sooner or later</br></br>  <br><br>Considering Berserk is never getting finished I'd rather Miura do more one-shots like that since I really like his artwork.</br></br>  <br> we've seen nothing of Skull Knight after Femto bamboozled him into unleashing even more monsters into the world <br><br>that's gotta burn, spent all that time on something the Godhand saw coming and based their plans on.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Given the rather tropey nature of the entire thing I'm thinking that Griffith deliberately orchestrated the merging of the planes so that the evil entities could be given physical form and harmed by combat.<br>He knows Guts will slice em all up sooner or later and in the end the two of them will somehow take down the idea of evil as well.<br><br>basically Griffith needed to ensure he's dismantling the bad guys from within so he's pretending to be evil</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gigantomachia, I think.</br>  <br><br>Thats stupid horse shit. Griffith wants his own kingdom, nothing more.</br></br>  <br>Miura, pls no.</br>  <br>http://www.mangareader.net/gigantom<wbr>akhia</wbr></br>  <br><br>You know it's gonna happen.<br>Search your feelings.</br></br></br>  <br>We don't know what Griffith's plans are now, we haven't really seen what he's been thinking since the Eclipse. All we've seen of him and the Godhand are them setting up for Falconia's return. Who knows what they're ultimately planning?<br><br>Sides, I'd argue that becoming part of the Godhand was the ultimate fulfillment of his 'own kingdom' wish anyway. Now he's up to something else.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Griffith is vain incarnate.<br><br>He saw that the Godhand are above him so he joined them but by no means is he playing their game and it's completely contrary to his character to be working for some giant evil heart with no choice in the matter.<br><br>You can bet your ass he's working it from the inside to come out on top somehow or at the very least fuck up whoever is above him.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wrong, best ending coming through<br> some unnecessary boat shit happens <br> Oh shit, Griffith's here  <br> But wait, Skull King gives Guts an amalgamation of behelits, causing another eclipse <br> Guts uses this opportunity to ask for his wish to be granted <br> His wish is to turn Griffith into a woman, who will then be married and subservient to Guts after he rapes her <br> Guts has successfully raped Griffith back at the same time as stealing his entire kingdom, because women can't rule </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well yeah sure that makes sense, but I don't think he would be trying to do it for "good" reasons.</br>  <br>Dude he isnt Griffith anymore, hes Femto. Whatever shred of good was in Griffith is gone, his soul is corrupted and now serves the idea of evil.<br>The Godhand tricked him into believing the only way he could achieve his dream was by betraying everyone, therefore claiming his soul. Just like all the demons before him.<br><br>Did you even read Berserk?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know youre a raging Griffith fanboy but relax with the stupid fanfic</br>  <br>Its a nip comic where demons and islands with teeth exist, i wouldn't think on it too hard</br>  <br>Mozgus is funny</br>  <br>It's obviously an electromagnet that is turned on when the dragonslayer is placed in the grip.</br>  <br>idolm@ster</br>  <br> he lied on the internet </br>  <br>Complete creative burnout. It's why he does silly things like spend inordinate amounts of effort on drawing shit like vases, why the pissing loli manga was so mediocre, and why the plot in Berserk has really gone nowhere since Guts finally got on the boat. I think he needs a shock to his system, like a few months traveling overseas. I think that's one of the reasons why Araki has managed to keep things so fresh.</br>  I mean, seriously. Griffith is a fucking background object to this vase.  <br>Not him but I actually did show Berserk to both my parents individually and even had my 68 year old father read the entire fucking manga. Now he's on the boat with the rest of us.</br>  <br>quick someone go take hostage of his idolmaster.</br>    <br>is there any other manga that puts same detail into its pages</br>    <br>I'm pretty happy I watched the dub of Berserk. I can hear Griffiths voice in my head when he talks, and its so fitting to the character</br>  If Miura ever kicks the bucket, I hope they bring this guy back to do the art.  How the hell does Muira make his living???    <br>The Berserk dub is really good. Marc Diraison's voice has become inseparable from Guts in my mind. The dub is excellent overall. The only character's voice I have a problem with is Gaston's because whenever I hear Sean Schemmel's voice, no matter the role, all I hear is Goku.</br>  <br> his work sold more than 30 millions <br>I fucking wonder anon.</br></br>  Could Takehiko Inoue finish Berserk if Miura dies prematurely?  <br>I thought I heard Goku's voice! I actually didn't mind it and was just kind of like "Hey its Goku" And yeah Guts' voice is great too. How are the movies? Is it the same voice actors?</br>    <br>All the key voice actors reprise their roles and sound better than ever in my opinion even though the movies abridge (butcher) the story.</br>    <br><br>Just to clarify, I do think the movies are worth watching at least once if you're a hardcore fan of Berserk. The movies are like seeing the same story from a different perspective, so they're interesting.</br></br>  <br>I'll probably get around to watching them even though I heard they are awful. Maybe might watch that Redux version</br>  <br><br>Actually, I've got time tonight I'll watch the first one now. I'll let you anons know what I thought about it</br></br>  <br>Kaoru Mori and Sui Kasai tend to get obsessive about detail, particularly with cloth, but they don't go haywire in every panel like Miura tends to, probably because they actually have to publish to put food on the table.<br><br>I kinda wonder what would happen if Miura recalibrated his brain and did something along the lines of Gisele Alain, maybe starring Rickert.</br></br></br>  Oh and I'd put Vinland Saga up there in terms of detail and in terms of probably never fucking ending, too.    Reminder that if Miura wont give us new chapter, autistic mods can delete berserk threads aswell  <br>Pretty sick colour work<br>Although i always imagined Grunbled would be blue like Seath the Scaleless</br></br>  <br><br>For me the story ended.<br>I enjoy it as something that is somewhat complete and done and i also imagined an ending for it.</br></br></br>  I just want more introspective/unstable Farnese. She's at her beast when she's confused.  <br>Don't be harsh on autistic people, they can't change the way they are.</br>  Anyone remember this shit?  <br> She's at her beast </br>  <br>One of the best Dreamcast games, here's hoping Fromsoftware gets to make the next Berserk game</br>  If you guys had to estimate how close we are to the end what would you say? 80%?  UGHHHHH<br><br>tbh i don't even care anymore<br><br>i haven't read a chapter in 8 friggin months, might as well not even exist</br></br></br></br>  <br>Let me explain to you why the wait is so long.<br><br>You see, Miura died 10 years ago but due to a life unfulfilled was cast into purgatory with one task: finish Berserk and you will be allowed into heaven.<br><br>However, after years of struggling against his own laziness and habits he became bitter at the whole ordeal. He changed the plot and put the cast on the boat.<br><br>The reason for the change is obvious, the boat is a message to the readers: "Do not lose the momentum in your life and fall to apathy as I did." Guts and friends are never getting off the boat, because just like Miura, they are trapped; because the boat is purgatory.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Based on the amount of loose ends we currently still have, I'd guess closer to 70%.</br>  <br>Fan guesses of completion could be anywhere, but knowing Miura, he could take the story in a completely new direction on a whim, because there's so much unresolved shit going on in the plot. it doesn't matter anyway because the future is dark.</br>  Say what you will about the movies, I absolutely adore the female character designs. They have this soft, fleshy look to them.  <br> ;_; </br>  <br>Slan in particular is positively delicious.</br>  <br> implying  <br><br>dude can't even finish his own shit</br></br></br>  <br> so great that separating the two would impossible <br><br>Maybe Guts doesn't have little bitch arms like you do?</br></br></br>  <br> dark souls berserk meem <br><br>Stop<br>They are completely different. Just because Dark Souls has references to Berserk doesnt mean its the same shit. From are awful at cinematics and they arent known for character development. A Berserk game would be extremely plot and dialogue heavy. From cant even animate fucking mouths for shit sake</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shut the fuck up Griffith apologist, you shit up every thread.</br></br>  <br>60 70<br><br>Still at least another 10 volumes to go in my opinion</br></br></br>  Not going to lie I kinda gave up after Guts found Casca again.<br><br>Whats the tl;dr on what I missed? At least tell me she is normal again.</br></br>  <br>You missed a lot of good shit and a lot of bad. You really should read it yourself since it doesn't hit the bad until Guts steps on the boat which is like in volume 32 or something.  She's not. </br>  <br>The most important part is swinging the sword, From is really good at letting you swing big ass swords.</br>  <br>No but were so close it might even happen next chapter<br><br>Its why i want the new chapter so bad<br><br>I want Guts to be happy again ;_;</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>she's not</br>  Berserk thread went over 100+<br><br><br>Wow</br></br></br>  Is Berserk essential cuckcore?  <br>OP here. It was all me.</br>  <br>Slan is one of the few things that the movie actually does better than either the manga or anime. I was happy with the previous iterations of her character but the movie design is an improvement in every way.</br>  <br> dark souls berserk meem <br>Who said anything about Dark Souls? I just meant seeing as how From's parent company has the right for a Berserk game they should at least use them<br><br> they arent known for character development. <br>True but they already have proved to be at the very least competent at making a hack and slash game</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes</br>  <br> platinum </br>  <br>I'm replaying 1 and 2 after finishing the anime actually and just running around two handing the biggest swords I can find. It is quite satisfying.</br>  <br>Great Job!</br>  <br>They have an entire scene dedicated to it. What do you think?</br>  <br>Judeau was a born cuck as well.</br>  <br> he has an obligation to at least give us an ending and not just abandoning it <br><br>Fucking this x 1000000</br></br></br>  <br>And Serpico, come to think of it. Shit, even Caska gets cucked by some old man.</br>  <br>The scale of it seems frightening, I agree<br><br> we have Griffith/Femto's "I was pretending all along" master plan where it turns out he was doing what he was doing to defeat an ancient evil <br><br>No. Just...No.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not the same fucking thing.<br><br>Imagine that kinda scene in e.g. Star Wars<br>"Why didn't Han pull up the Leia when she was falling...?"<br>"It's a movie with space wizards and plasma swords, I wouldn't think on it too hard"</br></br></br></br></br>  Well I just finished the 1st movie. Overall I'm pretty disappointed. Shit CG and I feel like there was way too much left out. Like Guts going from an arrogant ass to finally becoming friendly with the Band, and the plotting to assassinate Griffith. I did like the scenes that they actually animated well though.  <br>It was because he is losing his bodily functions from the armor draining his lifeforce<br>He was fucking tired and pulling someone out of the ocean while on a moving boat isnt exactly easy ok m8<br><br>The magnets are probably activated when the fingers clasp around the hilt<br><br>Happy?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What did you imagine anon-kun uguu?</br>  <br>You should still watch the others though. The duel between Guts and Griffith in the second movie is pretty well done and the entire Eclipse is interesting. Not perfect, but interesting.</br>  <br>Holy retarded shit Batman!</br>  Muira's inspiration is Hirasawa's songs.<br><br>Muira is the best mangaka by default.</br></br>  <br>I'll probably watch them tomorrow, don't have the time to tonight. I do feel like Griffith's eventual decent into evil was being foreshadowed harder in the movie than it was in the anime. Maybe I am just forgetting, but it seemed more subtle in the anime from what I remember.</br>  Will his chin ever stop growing?  <br>I dont know why but that post cracked me the hell up</br>  <br>Ok, let's say he was tired, it's not like it's the first illogical thing in the manga<br><br> The magnets are probably activated when the fingers clasp around the hilt <br>Listen, either they have magnetism or they don't, It's not an electromagnet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Its magic i dont gotta explain shit :^)</br>   Guts will never get away from the group of children <br> Guts' story will never be about suffering and despair again and will always be about love and friendship with a magic loli and a shota <br>my interested went downhill when the children appeared and stayed for good.</br></br>  <br>ever the berserker armor has some magic shit going on, why would ppl fixate on the hand</br>  <br>It was for fucking dramatic storytelling jesus christ<br>Something interesting had to happen while on that tub</br></br>  <br>Mmh now that is interesting</br>  <br>Theyll all die soon dont worry<br>People that get close to guts have a habit of.. dying<br>Also Skelly bro tells Guts his destiny is to suffer loss again and again. So they all ded</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, now I won't waste my time on the movies...for now</br>  <br>The older he gets the more he looks like Dolph Lundgren</br>  <br>no they won't, unless he decides to kill everyone together<br>people don't have a habit of dying anymore either, since loli mage put a plot device on him so monsters don't appear</br></br>  <br>hey fuck you nigga Gigantomachia was fucking cool, i wish there were more</br>  <br>the loli parts were cool but otherwise who cared</br>  Daily reminder  Elves will get Guts' artificial arm upgraded to a bionic.<br>They'll upgrade his armor so it doesn't drain him.<br>They will cure Casca.<br> probably not </br></br></br>  <br>never forget the gore in the berserk</br>  <br>elves are dead and the only thing left is ruins.</br>  <br>she's at her beast when she's horny to guts</br>  horny farnese is the best Farnese  <br>WAIT NO<br>A VISION HAS COME UPON ME<br><br>ELVES ARE DEAD...<br><br>...BECAUSE GRIFFITH KILLED THEM!<br><br>GUTS STEPS OFF BOAT, IMMEDIATELY FIGHTS GRIFFITH WHO HAD FLOWN UP ON ZOD<br><br>GUTS AND GRIFFITH KILL EACH OTHER<br><br>SURVIVORS RECONVENE, SOME BULLSHIT ABOUT 'THE OTHER APOSTLES ARE STILL OUT THERE BUT NOW WE KNOW, THEY CAN BE BEATEN, IF ONLY YOU HAVE THE GUTS'<br><br>ROLL CREDITS+SUNSET</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    I dont get it. I thought Berserk was still popular? So why arent we getting any new fucking movies or Anime? Ive given up on Miura beating his iDOLM@STER addiction and finishing the manga so I at least want everything after the Golden Age arc animated. We at least deserve that for putting up with this bullshit.<br><br> You will never see the best arc aka the Tower of Conviction arc animated <br><br>Fucking hurts.</br></br></br></br>    <br> if only you have the guts <br><br>Plz no papa Miura</br></br></br>  Never Forget this horny Farnese  <br>I'm curious, does /a/ hate Shierke?</br>  <br>Why did this even happen?</br>  <br/>  <br>She was possesed</br>  <br>Nvm, this answered it...</br>  <br>She's kinda flouted as the poster girl for the change berserk went through, but I don't hold her responsible<br><br>I liked old berserk more but I like new berserk too, just in different ways<br><br>Shierke feels out of place to me but that's really just because my brain will always be stuck in the first 1/2 or so, from Band of the Hawk time to when Guts was still wandering alone chopping demons</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually don't mind Schierke. She's not a bad character and has at least some semblance of emotional depth. This little shit however...</br>  <br> Gatts </br>  <br>Vol 14-24 have the best Guts</br>  <br>Almost as bad as Band of the Falcon.</br>  <br>This. Guts is one handsome motherfucker during that part.</br>  <br><br>Agree. I think it has something to do with the fact that Miura suddenly decided to start outlining his upper lip somewhere around volume 27 and his jaw stretching out from a more stylize manga proportions to more realistic (ugly) proportions as previously stated.</br></br>  <br>he relented on that later on, though.</br>  Here's a question. What was the point of the flashback chapters in volume 37? Why did Miura feel the need to force in the little flower elf? It's kind of a big deal because it means that Puck is actually not the first elf Guts had ever encountered. I'm assuming Miura must have had a good reason to go back and add this because Guts' history was just fine as it was and there was no apparent need to do so. Is it going to relate to Elf island in some way? Also, when is The Count's daughter going to come back for her revenge?  <br> Also, when is The Count's daughter going to come back for her revenge? <br><br>You don't get it? It's okay I'll explain it to you:<br><br> Count's daughter is Skull Knight </br></br></br></br></br>  Which Berserk girl has the best tits and why is it Isma?  <br>I don't think Ishidro is a bad character. I like him</br>  <br>He met skull knight before he met the counts daughter you autist</br>  Can someone tell me what the fuck this is? I cant read moon runes  <br>I knew fapping to him wasn't REALLY gay!</br>  <br>All apart of her plan.</br>  <br><br>Exactly? Count's daughter becomes Skull Knight and goes back in time to get revenge on Guts using powerful magics.<br><br>Skull Knights behelit sword proves this, she has already used it once to go back in time. checkmate</br></br></br></br>  <br>And Judeau is actually Isidoro right</br>  <br><br>Derp</br></br>  <br>Date sim. Pay 3 silver pieces to spend the night ploughing your rod into some nice tight buns.</br>  <br>Ok but the real question is  who is Bag? </br>  Just look at the miserable state of this thread. This is what being deprived of Berserk for so long is doing to us. We're delirious.  <br>If it never comes back, there are worse places it could have stopped.</br>  <br>I sat there with the biggest grin on my face first time reading that<br><br>Not because lol boobs but man.. thats literally the only true happiness Guts has ever felt<br><br> when Guts spills the rape story to Casca and says "ill just go now", and casca hugs him <br><br>Muh heart</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Bag-kun is Griffiths reincarnation</br></br>  <br>Griffith is a self centered douchebag and always was.<br><br>Griffith apologists are literally ultra space Nazis</br></br></br>  <br> i hated how they removed that scene from the movies</br>  <br>If Miura dies I will spend good money to make one of these "Griffith gets fucked" comics happen.</br>    does anyone have a chart like this but for berserk?  Why does Zodd think he's a match for Skull Knight when he only ever got ass raped by him whenever they fought? How fucking delusional is this guy?  <br>Well.. he is Immortal</br>  <br>Doubt it. If Skullknight decided to get serious during one of their encounters, he could shred Zodd to a thousand tiny pieces in a flash. I'd like to see him regenerate from that. He's not even a match for Guts at this point.</br>  <br>I doubt that<br>Also skelly and zodd are evenly matched, theyve been fighting for hundreds of years.<br><br>Anyway i have a request<br>Its a drawing of Guts in his berserker armor with Casca all cured embracing each other<br>Cant find it on google<br>I need it for reasons</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Serpico <br> adult <br> male <br> has completed his character arc <br><br>He's is going to be the first to go.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I got you nig</br>  <br>Thanks dude!</br>  <br> outlining his upper lip <br><br>This. Big mistake.</br></br></br>  <br> Also skelly and zodd are evenly matched <br><br>Not even close, Skully is always going easy on him.<br><br>When he decided to actually break into the eclipse after playing with Zodd he had his entire arm lopped off</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But dont forget to mask it as idolmaster question.</br>  I want a picture of "Star Wars Guts"; with bionic arm with integrated blaster and (bigger than ususal) lightsaber. Purple lightsaber. Like a dark Jedi or some shit.<br> inb4 'or some Sith' puns </br>  Cant he just fucking tell someone how he plans to end it and they make animation out of it. I dont fucking care about artstyle if never plans to draw it.  <br>why do you hate your father?</br>  <br><br>Because his father is 68 years old and now won't be able to die till Berserk finishes.<br><br>Bless that anon for granting him immortality.<br><br>Now think of all the anons who died while waiting for Guts to get off the boat.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Only 10 years <br>Small time</br></br>  <br>You're actually not too far off. My father is in poor health and I don't know how much longer he has left. I wanted to share Berserk with him before he died because I knew that if I didn't, I'd regret it for the rest of my life.</br>  <br> fucking metal</br>  <br> another 10 years to develop the game </br>  <br>Nah, the apostles can be put into less arcs with Guts taking more than 1 apostle on at the time, especially since he has the berserk armor and his rpg party it seems more likely that the only ones that would need an arc are the dragon dude and zodd</br>  Are there any modern interviews with Miura that mention berserk? I wouldn't even know how to find a japanese magazine archive for something like that. When he does them, do you think he refuses to answer questions about it for his other work?  when did they get on the boat?  <br>I feel kinda awful that by now, I simply can't give a fuck anymore. Nothing fucking happens even when Miura draws a few chapters. And it seems like he's drawing less and less.</br>  <br>Or he can just give Griffith the anti-hero persona who actually saves all the people and they live in harmony with apostles, and let Guts and Caska live on elf island. It would take only 1 arc.</br>  <br> Griffith anti-hero persona <br> loved by people <br> Guts kills him anyway <br> everyone hates him and he ends up alone wanted nowhere </br></br></br></br>  Might as well re-read golden age again, the last chapters of that arc are dope in how it slowly breaks off from medieval politics and turns into dark fantasy fighting demons and shit  <br> Rickert slapped Griffith </br>  <br>So I guess we can pretend it's over right?</br>  <br>Surely Griffith, having learned the error of his ways, will dismiss all the apostles and other monsters back to the astral world and he will go be pals with Guts again like the good old times. Guts may be a little resistant at first considering the whole raping Caska retarded thing but he sees that that's pretty much all water under the bridge at this point and they all live happily ever after. The end.</br>  I lost interest after The Golden Age arc because all of the manga scans I could find were really terrible translations and I don't know if it's worth the effort for the heartbreak of never getting an ending.  <br>... who ?</br>  Best apostle.  <br> not buying tanks and reading them while taking a dump </br>  <br>No godfuckingdammit, that would be lazy writing 101</br>  <br>the black ghost is the best apostle. this is fact. miura said so. "best apostle is that ghost guy, can't remember his name." but 'know, in japanese</br>  <br>Would lazy writing be better than no writing?</br>  <br>No, he said that best apostle was Skull knight that's why he is so important in the story and that Zodd was his second favorite. That's why he decided to draw him feline like, his first intention was to have face similar to that of bat.<br>Nosferatu-bat.<br>POTTERY<br>O<br>T<br>T<br>E<br>R<br>Y</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If it would end that fucking shitty way, then yes.<br>Eventually someone would finish it.<br>Griffith is BBEG and that's a state of the matter. You can't have an epic with such shitty ending, even G.R.R. Martin wouldn't do that.</br></br></br>  <br>They were evenly matched for hundreds of years, but now that the behelit sword is complete, I think  is right. If they really go at it now, Skelly would win.</br>  <br> They were evenly matched for hundreds of years <br><br>I'm not sure even this is true. Skully doesn't even consider Zodd a true enemy, he's going directly after the GOD-HAND nevermind a single apostle.</br></br></br>  <br>2007</br>    <br> 8 years on the boat  <br>Imagine how hot grown up Schierke is now<br><br>cant fucking wait</br></br></br></br>  <br>Miura's inspiration is Chihaya's songs.<br><br>Miura is the best mangaka by default.</br></br></br>  <br>Miura said the manga is 70% done</br>  <br>As if she could get hotter.</br>  <br>Where can I find the cunt? Does he have social media or something? The guy is like a deity that only speaks to his followers when the planets align</br>    <br>He doesn't use anything like that. He's pretty much a shut-in as far as I know.</br>  <br>thought it was 40%.</br>  <br>Yeah all the 2D stuff looked great. Too bad the whole movie wasn't like that.<br><br> I still think Madhouse, Yoshiaki Kawajiri directing and a big budget would have been the most perfect way to tackle a Berserk movie franchise. A man can dream, sigh.. </br></br></br>  I last read Berserk about ten years ago. I think Guts (or GATTSU-san as the scanlations had it) had just fotten some black armor that made him strong but could consume his soul, Griffith (GURIFFISU-sama) was wandering about reborn on Earth with Zod as his loyal cuck, and Casca literally still a vegetable after years and years. Guts had still not managed to kill one God Hand.<br><br>Has anything actually happened since then?<br>I haven't touched those shitty-looking CGI movies.</br></br></br>  <br>They got on a boat. That's it.<br> And Griffith gets pimp slapped </br></br>  <br> He doesn't like Bart Simpson. </br>  <br>Reminder that when they are done with whatever they set themselves to do in the elf island it will take them 10 years to go back</br>  <br>Like, dont have a cow man!</br>  <br>god she makes my dick so hard i swear</br>  <br>Imagine if the movies had looked like that.<br>I thought stuff was supposed to get better with time, not worse..?</br></br>  <br><br>Are you kidding me anon ?<br>The ps2 game had actually good visuals.</br></br></br>  Only nostalgiafags can't appreciate the quality of the Berserk movies CG.  I don't even care if the movies are bad. I just want them to animate more Berserk.  <br> dear diary.jpg <br>I was against Schierke her first chapter or so, but she really quickly grew on me. Dat daughteru x old man relationship.<br>Plus it's gonna be delicious when she  tastes despair on par with Guts' and she turns into a mad mad bitch or dies. </br></br></br>  <br>Then they killed a sea god.</br>  <br>What i don't like about CG in anime is that there is no detail at all in stuff that has to move. I mean, look at that image you posted.</br>  <br><br>They fucked up everything with those shaders, i mainly deal with realistic scenes and even i created much better NPR materials and models.</br></br>  <br> http://exhentai.org/g/452615/4a31f2<wbr>eb57/</wbr> </br>  I need to catch up.

PS Guts inspired me to get shredded</br></br>   Skull Knight spin-off <br><br>when?</br></br>  <br> each god-hand's rise to power spin-off <br>when?</br></br>  <br>I want to see Slan's back story. Also Void and Skully.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure slan must've been raped quite a bit</br>  <br>Probably. I think it's a little more complicated than that considering she loves torture, violence, emotions and so on. Guts killed her and she only had an orgasm.</br>  <br> first guy to reach the age of 130 years still waiting for miuras son to finish berserk already <br> still on boat </br></br>  <br>Well yeah, if we got the golden age as Griffith's story of his rise into god-hand status you can expect something of similar weight from the other 4.</br>  <br> your father will die before berserk finishes </br>  <br>I always just loved this part in the manga where they thought Gut's was bluffing with his sword</br>  <br>Sounds like wishful thinking.<br>Void would be the most likely though as he seems to be the big cheese.</br></br>  JUDGEMENT DESU  no               THREAD KUROKO  Ya'll got any more of these.

Someone who's only seen Wing or Seed is very near the top, someone who's seen, say, every UC series is probably much nearer the bottom.</br>  <br><br>I will never understand peoples raging hard on for the Monogatari series. It's so fucking pretentious and irritating to watch and not to mention prone to constantly getting sidetracked on inane conversations that don't mean anything and bringing everything to a halt for overly elaborate fanservice scenes.

Pretty much everyone on the internet seems to have the exact same damn taste in anime, what's awesome and what isn't period though.</br></br>  <br>Can't say since I don't go there, but I don't really see much of a difference in some of the posts/fanbase that I have.</br>  <br>Well, assuming you've also seen some other things.

Everything above the water is meant to represent general titles that most people have seen, Bebop and NGE are on a pretty close level.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just watched Kiseichuu no Ichiya<br><br>What the fuck</br></br></br>  <br>  good question  </br>  <br>I feel like there's a level that just plain missing.<br>It goes from pretty well known, to relatively obscure in kind of an instant.<br>I mean, no way is Mind Game and Cat Soup just a step below LoGH, Kaji and Bebop.<br><br>I don't think Honneamise is THAT low either.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Outside of maybe Kemonozume I don't feel Yuasa works are that obscure, following the popularity of Tatami and Ping Pong a lot of people have begun to watch most of his titles and Cat Soup and Mind Game got somewhat popular. <br><br>But I agree that I did put Honneamise a bit too low, it would probably best fit around Kuuchuu and Dennou Coil<br><br>I'll probably make some revisions to it later.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just because you like the same show as someone doesn't mean you'll like them. Why and how you like it are just as, if not more, important.<br><br>Someone who skips OPEDs and plays their anime at 2x so that they can brag about how much of an anime expert they are to their friends is obviously not going to be well received by the average /a/non.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd say the Daicons are near the center of tier 5. They're pretty obscure but not near the level of something like Uracon III.</br>  Seriously though , why is inferno cop so low on lists? It was the 3rd or 4th anime I watched , right after ttgl.  <br> 88 stuff <br>Cool, thanks</br></br>  <br>Just watchd it.<br>Still trying to figure out.</br></br>  <br>Seems to be Garden of Earthly Delights in animated form</br>  <br>Woah. someone else that seen Requiem from the Darkness.<br>Funny thing, it was one of my entry-level anime.</br></br>  Name dropping sure is fun!  <br>here we go.</br>  this is fucking retarded.  needs more obscure guro hentai and bestiality anime.  <br>Watch </br>  <br>It's not about knowing it. It's about watching it entirely.</br>  <br>SAO is the new Naruto,in that it invites consant shitposting. It doesn't matter that it was written as a web novel in early 2000,because the anime came out in 2012,it's totally ripping off .dot/hack bro!<br><br>Even though hack is a piece of trash with ugly character designs,and tons of normies who never saw hack like SAO,it must have ripped it off.</br></br></br>   Bebop, GITS and Eva not on lvl 1... <br><br>LOL!</br></br>  <br> No crest/banner of the stars <br><br>/a/ showcasing its terrible taste yet again</br></br></br>  <br> LOL! <br>lol</br></br>  <br> lol <br>heh</br></br>  <br>Evangelion is at least tier 2.True normalfags can't handle it. Me and friend both watched it in high school,and liked it.My friend laoned the DVDs to a mutual friend who thought he was a fucking amateur director,who constantly watched gangster movies and scorsese movies,he would jerk off with a film reel if he could.That guy hated the dancing episode,and dropped the show right then.</br>  <br> heh <br>kek</br></br>  <br> meh gore anime <br> school days <br>it's romance/drama<br>saged</br></br></br></br>  For fucs sake /a/, just watch what you want to watch. <br><br>Who gives a shit what is considered deep?</br></br>  <br>Akira is the plebest of the pleb.</br>  <br>I can only like anime that nobody here has ever watched.</br>  <br>Why are you even on /a/ then?<br><br>Some of the people in this thread are the reasons why I just lurk a good 90% of the time.</br></br></br>  <br> NIGHT OF FIRE </br>  <br>g-reco was a fucking disaster</br>  My school offers a course one japanese animation. I had the first class today. Instructor asked us why we were interested in the class, and what some anime we liked were if were already familiar.<br><br> ~60% said Pokemon, Dragon Ball Z <br> One guy said Garfield </br></br></br>  The way I see it, if an anime has a sub for it by subgroups, it's already plebian trash. This also accounts for having a Wikipedia article. If its on Wikipedia, it's already too mainstream for me and I end it.  <br>Thank you for Kiseichuu no Ichiya. It felt like playing Yume Nikki again.<br><br><br>Cap soup is pretty great, I'm happy that people have started watching it again. Mind Game was always somewhat popular.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tibetan throat singing isn't even that bad. It actually resembles real music with actual effort put into it and I can see people listening to it. Unlike wall noise or that genre that just records garbage off they hear from outside.</br>  <br> tfw I actually know what musique concrete is <br>It sucks</br></br>  There's a /v/ one that lists doom wads in the bottom tier <br>Now doom and its mods are very digestible, but the amount of people that have played them are absolutely microscopic in the big picture<br>I think shit like Inferno Cop kind of sits in the same boat for anime</br></br>  <br>I'm surprised .wads aren't more popular. I mean, I could easily see something like some Scythe levels being enjoyable for many compared to I don't know, Plutonia. Or hell, even shorter ones like Thunder Peak.</br>  <br>I liked it.<br>I masturbated to it.<br> thrice </br></br></br>  Even /v/ does this better than /a/.  <br>Trixie and Chad sound fun.<br>Better than some mopey, little faggot.</br></br>  <br> musique concrete <br> it sucks <br><br>You do not like Dr. Who intro song?</br></br></br></br>  <br>probably the most acurate list</br>  <br>He could have been held back somewhere down the line.There was a 20 year old in my senior year.</br>  <br>Do I have to work through the levels to reach the deeper stuff or can I just dive right in?

I wanna see the real weird shit because its peaked my curiosity like something crazy.</br>  <br> being a retarded high schooler </br>  <br>Why is Mononoke so deep? It was a very straight forward movie.<br> Angel's Egg I agree with. One of my favorite movies of all time and I STILL am not entirely sure what's going on. </br></br>  <br> movie </br>  <br>Mononoke was pretty mainstream when in aired, I can't understand why people would considered it super duper patrician core.</br>  <br>I don't consider it super duper patrician core but I still think it's a pretty good work, great visual direction and atmosphere.</br>  <br>Wanna know what else is entry level?<br><br> Your mother's vagina </br></br></br>  <br>Not gonna lie, that had me chuckling like a moron.</br>  <br>I'm sure that Tibetan throat singing is actually good.</br>  <br>I think what's meant by OP's link is anime that people like, not so much what they've seen.<br><br>Evangelion and all the other Level 3 &amp; lower animes (with the exception of GitS) are hardly entry level. If you make any of those series a person's first or even 5th anime they will be weirded out as hell and never watch anything related to Japanese animation ever again.<br><br>You probably just think they're "entry level" due to you being so used to anime and hyper inoculated to some of the weird shit that can come up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree with Eva's positioning in "Loser" but it's "Critic" needs to be a lot higher</br>  <br> tfw Harsh Noise is weirdly relaxing </br>  <br> no ghost slide at the bottom </br>  <br><br><br><br> some retards actually spent time making these based on their own opinion about anime <br><br>Consider suicide.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it actually good? I'm into cross-dressing, forced feminisation and traps, but not shota.

Now it'd be maybe there with Mezzo Forte/DSA/Wolf's Rain/Anything that a was slightly popular when it came out around 1997-2005<br>Why is Kite rarely mentioned these days? It was almost as big as Bebop when released, it's on the American Netflix and it got a Hollywood remake like a yea ago</br></br>  Is this one of those joke pictures, or something commonly posted on MAL?<br>There is no way it could be serious.</br>  <br>I'm gonna do the same.<br><br><br>Kite didn't age as well in my opinion, and there's not much to it. So people who saw it don't mention it again, in turn kids never hear of it until someone mentions Umetsu or something due to a new work.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you serious? I honestly don't know if you're fucking with me, but I can't really sense irony from your post.<br>There's so many normies involved in the movie industry (actors, critics) who don't watch anime at all and fucking loved Paprika, GitS or Angel's Egg. They're simply good movies, you don't need to know shit about anime in order to appreciate them.<br>Evangelion is pretty much what got every single anglosphere 90s kid and their dog into anime, it's one of the most recognizable series of all time. Robin Williams was known to be a fan.<br>I'm from former commie bloc where anime isn't very popular and I got into anime when I randomly watched Mononoke that aired on national TV sunday noon (so pretty much in family entertainment slot) over a decade ago. It's motherfucking Ghibli for God's sake, you don't need to be a weirdo to enjoy this shit.<br><br>TL;DR - even the normiest of normies can appreciate the anime in OP's image.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The 2nd mmo world isn't interesting and it feels like the first one wasn't really exploited</br>  I think being a fan of the original Japanese DBZ and the English dub should be categorized differently.  <br>Also case in point, I happened to make a screenshot of an anime thread on /tv/ some time ago because I was amused by how run-of-the-mill their taste was.</br>  "That guy" should be someone who watches hentai for the story.  <br>That's every other board outside of *most* the japanese culture ones.</br>  <br>Done, I do need to stop watching anime.<br><br><br>Agree with you, most things listed in OP are super easy access stuff. JoJo could have been level 2 if not for the fact that it got a reboot now.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Bizzare <br><br>I know these are just done to trigger people but it still succeed on me.</br></br></br>  <br> "That guy" should be someone who watches hentai for the story. <br>Fuck, I watched oni chichi after a random fap because I got hooked with the plot.</br></br>  <br>Read the fucking sticky</br>  <br>I know, it encapsulates what "I'm not really into anime, but these were pretty good"-kind of people have watched and enjoyed.</br>  <br>Every season I watch 80+% of series that air. I enjoy vast majority of them, my mean score is 7.5/10. I'm extremely easy to entertain, but when I watched SAO, I almost felt insulted.<br><br>The series is an example of a poorly executed waste of a cool concept. It's a work that revolves around an edgy Gary Stu self-insert that everyone aspired to be when they were 12, and that's about the age (give or take 3 years) you'd have to be to enjoy it.<br>To me SAO was barely any different than if one of those "Coldsteel" Sonic fanfic characters got an animated series.<br><br>It's not THE worst anime of its kind by any means (Mahouka blows SAO out of the water), but it happens to be extremely popular in the west, which is why it gets the most shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree. I wanted to like SAO. I really do. The concept is nice but there's just no tension to it since the protagonist is pretty much unbeatable for a significant chunk of the series. It's hard to feel the supposed drama behind the dying in game bit when Kirito barely has to face that danger.</br>  <br> I watch 80+% of series that air. I enjoy vast majority of them, my mean score is 7.5/10 <br>Shit man, of the ones I complete, yeah I guess my average is on the good side.<br>But I do tend to drop a lot of shit or put it on hold, I just can't be bothered to keep on watching forgettable shit now that I'm not a hikki neet.<br><br> To me SAO was barely any different than if one of those "Coldsteel" Sonic fanfic characters got an animated series. <br>Pretty much, AW and SAO are basically just that, hell the author wrote the things in that way by being an chuuni teenager.<br><br> Mahouka <br>AW and Mahouka for me are some of the worst recently, couldn't even finish them, unlike SAO which I did finish (it also had ok fap material).<br><br>It's kinda sad that the VR/Falling into a game world set up became a gimmick for low tier shit instead of cool sci-fi/dnd series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You faggots are soo full of your asses<br>These so called lists dont matter in the end<br>What matters most is that you enjoyed a show regardless of the "level"</br></br>  <br>How about a level where you watch whatever anime you like and have watched many, but hide your powerlevel irl because you are a normalfag?</br>  <br>No one is saying that obscurity level = quality or enjoyment.<br>It's just a measure of how deep you're into the shit hobby.</br></br>  <br>Same here, guess I'll be running in the 90's forever</br>  <br> Level 1: watch anime, read manga <br> Level 2: LNs <br>---- warning line -----------------------------------<wbr>--------<br> Level 3: VNs <br>----- down the abyss -----------------------------------<wbr>-- <br> Level 4: buyfagging BDs, figs <br>----- abandon all hope, there is no return ---------<br> Level 5: buyfagging dolfies <br><br>There, that's all the 'how deep into the shit are you' categories that you need.</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  How about watch whatever show you want to watch, regardless of what a group of people you don't even care about will say? Why do you try so hard to fit in? If you want to watch even Nardo, go right the fuck ahead. If you want to watch Girls und panzer, watch the fuck out of it.<br><br>For a group of people that say they hate normalfags, you try to fit in just as much as the average normalfag does.</br></br>  <br>Oh I get it<br>So an entry level show can be better than a show thats considered odd and vice versa<br>The lists are still shit because itz super subjective</br></br></br>  <br>Never read a LN and the only VN's i've read is Fate and Tsukihime, and i didn't even like them.<br>Am i a normalfag?</br></br>  That Guy and Outsider with the patrician taste.  <br>Maybe.

I watch what I want, when I want. I guess I'm a normie by your standards because I don't care about fitting in. I only come here for a select few threads anyway, and the weird sense of humor.  <br>This is in terms of depth into the hobby not quality.

Doesn't help that the manga or anime were kinda mediocre or shit.<br>JoJo no idea, maybe because it's an old series and most people watching it are jojo fans, not newbies (although I might be wrong, I don't check tumblr or newfag blogs).</br></br>  mnemosyne... damn it's one of the most satisfying anime for me  <br>Why the fuck isn`t NHK on the very loser end?</br>  <br>FMA should be way higher on the critically aclaimed list and inbetween loser and chaf exactly.<br>NHK should be way more loser<br>Also since when was K on critically acclaimed?</br></br></br>  <br>I'll never get the SAO hate train when it's been three years and at least three just as weebbait shows since then.</br>   Eva <br> Weird <br> Bebop and Brotherhood <br> Outsider <br>You couldn't get anymore entry level</br></br></br></br>  <br> Odin Level 5 <br>I thought that was one of those famous bad animes.<br> Garzey's Wing Level 6 <br>I'm pretty sure I saw the VHS at multiple video stores in the 90s.<br> Eagle Riders Level 6 <br>By this definition every UPN cartoon prior to Hulk/Jumanji/BAD is level 6.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I saw some on /a/ back before tumblr discovered it.</br>  <br> type-moon everything level 2 <br> idolshit level 3 <br> literally half of all anime (ecchi and action series) level 3 <br>Get the fuck out and take your shit taste with you, you gigantic flaming fucking faggot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Screencapped for future reference.</br>  <br>Sailor Moon is both socially weirder and more patrician than most of the first four levels.

You're scaring the Ruris away Shun, stop it.  why is he so cute? why can't i have one of him<br>PS starting the shun vs sora duel rn, this better live up to the lights out+PJs hype <br>and shun better not job</br></br>  <br>He got caught between dimensions and died.</br>  <br>shun's bedroom</br>  <br>Creating Yliaster so he can fix the dimensions and timelines, or he's off gambling in the tops for bitches.</br>  <br>He's attracting the Ruris towards him if anything.</br>  <br>Nerd doesn't even get to hang with my new cool kids.</br>  <br>Tops City while monitoring the others through Tsukikage.</br>  <br> implying shun won't break down upon seeing all the ruris safe and together </br>  <br> The still shot before the blinding light behind him catches up and explodes him to a billion pieces. <br><br> Cards raining from sky <br> Blackwings </br></br></br></br>  <br> implying shun isn't getting his ass carded by Ruri who is evil as shit which breaks his heart </br>  <br>Shun will finally be able to EGAO for real then.</br>  <br>Has Shun ever actually shown strong desire to keep Ruris beside his own safe? The strongest emotion I remember him showing is getting triggered when they use fusion</br>  <br>that would break my heart too though<br><br> explain to this poor soul what EGAO means </br></br></br>  <br>That's some yubel yandere shit right there, Ruri wants to keep Shun to herself forever.</br>  <br>This is EGAO.</br>  <br>No, he doesn't seem to give two shits about either Yuzu or Serena. The only thing interactions he's really shown is:<br><br> Believing Yuzu to be Ruri and immediately getting gut punched <br> Protecting Serena solely because she protected him <br> Listening to Serena because she said Ruri was likely safe <br><br>Otherwise he gives no crap about the other Ruris, only his Ruri.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  PROTECT ALL RURIS  <br>Yeah, as a card, in her deck. <br><br> He's not her ace </br></br></br>   tfw manlet bird boy doesn't let you break out of jail to find your waifu   YAMEROOOOO    You will never stop Fusion Shun, never.  <br>Don't know but he needs some screen time I need more DDD's.</br>  <br>He'll beat Jack and become Kingu himself and recruit him into the Lancers so he's around all the time.</br>   the real reason Shun learned how to ride a d-wheel   <br>You forgot<br> Went out of his way to watch Yuzu vs Masumi, despite not playing spectator to any other duel during the tournament. </br></br>  D-hhwheel.  <br>Back on Standard watching Netflix.</br>  i've seen a kurosaki win against you before<br>no matter how cute you are this time around i'll be rooting for it to happen again</br>  <br>Planning a new prank for Sawatari in his Synchro Neet Cave</br>  Honestly I want more Yuya thirsty scenes than Shun's Give back Ruri scenes.

This is just strapping screens built in a pair of lab goggles on your face.</br>  <br> can barely see through her shirt </br>  <br>You autistic or somethin?</br>  <br> Plot Twist: Reiji's Dimension Mover was actually rerouted ahead of time to send him right back to his NEETcave </br>  <br> dresses like a slut <br> $300 haircut <br> "girlfriend material" <br>Yeah I don't think so.</br></br></br></br>  damn this shun vs sora duel is actually very visually impressive, flight sequence caught me off guard. 8 minutes into episode 34 right now, based shun's traps are awesome  <br> virtual <br> not physically existing as such but made by software to appear to do so <br>By this definition we should be able to touch things in games.</br></br></br>  <br>Hold onto your ass, it's about to get RUM up in here.</br>  <br>I'll be sure to relay your opinion to the people who have been developing VR tech for the past 30 years.<br><br>Hey guys, Anonymous from /a/ says you can't use that term anymore because you can't touch things yet. Shut it down boys, it's over...</br></br></br>  <br>Well he DID go there in the first place for Yuzu and only Yuzu and didn't really give a shit about any other dimension's problems.</br>  <br>Loved that part.</br>  <br> Implying he didn't want any of his friends to get in trouble if they came along with him </br>  <br><br>Yuya becoming Judai</br></br>  <br>sora is legit becoming scary</br>  <br>But the friends of people who escape go to the prison rape cave</br>  <br>ALRIGHT HOLY SHIT SORA WHAT</br>  Xyz focused decks tend to have a lot of traps, Synchro focused decks tend to have a lot of cards that generate tokens and special summoning monster effects. <br><br>Fusion decks need hand generators like poor areas need guns. There should be a new polymerization card that lets you draw cards for each fusion material you use, fusion 2, draw 2 cards,ect</br></br>  <br>Does that mean his friends will eventually act like little fuckers towards him, except Gon who will be the Sho at this situation where he forgives Yuya?</br>  <br>Thats if they were involved in any way of the escape plan, so that's why Yuya waned to escape without telling them</br>  <br>this episode has made me homosexual for shun</br>  <br> There should be a new polymerization card that lets you draw cards for each fusion material you use, fusion 2, draw 2 cards,ect <br>Have you seen literally any of the fusion related they've made in the last 3 years? Fuck, that would have been broken when Heroes were the only good fusion deck<br><br><br>They didnt say that, they said that those left behind would take the punishment. They knew who knew who, do you think they'd care about how much involvement they had?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If only you were here when Shun vs Sora aired, anon.<br>Shit was so hype.</br></br>  <br>Fusion Advantage<br>(This card's name is always treated as Polymerization.) Draw 1 for every fusion material used in a fusion summon with this card yadda yadda you guys fucking get it once per turn and all that shit<br><br>Fluffals would love it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>HE DID IT<br>HE WON<br>BASED <br><br>man same here, that was almost ichigo vs byakuya levels of hype</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Welcome the club.</br>  <br>At worst, the other Lancers don't pay much attention to Yuya. At best, others like Gon and Dennis notice that something's up and are actually helpful.<br><br>Judai's friends excluding Jim and O'Brien directed all their frustration and blame at Judai for how they ended up while not really trying to help the situation themselves because of the marks.</br></br></br>  <br>What I wouldn't give to watch Shun vs Sora again for the first time<br>And you don't even have to wait for the tracks to be released, you fucking prick.</br></br>  We all know Yuya vs Yuri will be the hypest duel  <br> At worst, the other Lancers don't pay much attention to Yuya. <br> tfw nobody knows you're the main character </br></br>  <br>Damn Serena looks big</br>  <br> for you </br>  <br> tfw when I first saw this on the preview I thought she would hug him </br>  <br>Is that a bad thing? In-universe, Yuya's treated as another member of the group like all the others, rather than being the leader with hanger-ons clinging to his heels, and we all know how the latter situation ended up for Judai. For once the rival is the leader (or he's supposed to be).</br>  Guys who says this?   HANASE HANASE    <br>No, it isn't. It's one of the things I liked when I started watching Arc-V, it isn't all about Yuya.<br><br>but it's still sad for poor little tomato</br></br></br>  <br>At this point of time Yuya has the least screen time out of the protagonists, shame since he's my favourite</br>  <br> Summon Blazeman <br> Add this <br> Activate to fuse Blazeman on field and Shadow Mist in hand <br> Draw 2, add a hero with shadow mist effect and make Nova Master or whatever <br>This card is awfully designed</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Yoshida will come back and restore the peace  </br>  oh shit what yuto vs sora<br>based shun surpassed my expectations, now i just have to count on yuto not jobbing<br>also damn if i didn't expect sora being evil-ish</br></br>  <br>Wait until Violet Flash is an official card since it helps fusion decks reclaim the lost advantage by drawing for each time you fuse alongside the fact that it makes activating fusion/Poly unrespondable to.</br>  <br> Rampant capitalization <br> Bleach </br></br>  <br>I had forgotten about Violet Flash. Yuri can't get an on screen duel fast enough.</br>  <br> Sora was gonna job. He gets his non-jobbing injections later. </br>  <br>I like Bleach too but don't make yourself look like a fucking retard. This is still /a/ we are on, not /dng/.</br>  <br> not /dng/. <br><br>Thank Ra.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it's alright as it is, and I like the kid too. Past Yugioh series could occasionally get annoying about MC doing everything of importance.</br>  <br>GX was very bad about that and nobody will ever surpass the amount of duels Judai had, though I liked Judai, but maybe because the abridged shit gave me a view of him just rapping constantly which somehow fits...</br>  <br>i think one of the reasons why he's so good is because he has such little screentime and the people/relationships around him are fleshed out so well<br><br>i don't spend much time on this board but i guess bleach is one of those triggers on here, i'll shut up about it</br></br></br>  <br>Because Judai actually dueled a rapper in the dub and always talked like he came out of the 90's. I like how his deck now outshines Yusei's in getting out fusions over those synchros.</br>  <br>That's a good thing. Most side characters are treated well in Arc-V. It isn't all about Yuya and that's a thing it has over past series.</br>  Remember when people thought we'd never see Mieru again after her duel or have her cards ever released because it was flip and ritual based?  C A R D I A N S <br>A<br>R<br>D<br>I<br>A<br>N<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>M U G E N L O O P U</br>  <br>BUY ALL TWO OF THE CARDIANS THAT WILL GET PRINTED</br>  Son let me tell you about Entermachines  <br>Are you going to lead into an revengence reference?</br>  <br>just bumping</br>  <br>What monster did Hippo set?</br>  Any Ruri figmas out yet?  <br>Only dakimuras.</br>    You just got falsely accused of keeping Ruri captive. Shun has heard the accusation and is advancing on your position. What do you do to prepare?  Can't decide which not-yuya is my favorite, Banana, Tomato, eggplant, ...whatever vegetable/fruit Yuri is.<br><br>still I want Sora to show up again love that guy</br></br>  <br>Buy Raid Raptors and hope I have enough to appease him.</br>  <br>It's called writing a decent main cast</br>  <br>shove him straight into a set of pic related</br>  <br>Prepare Super Poly.</br>  <br>Gekidan Niagara</br>  <br>Yuri is either a Dragon Fruit for the pun or a Plum.</br>  <br>Watch his deck crumble because I don't special summon.</br>  <br>I prepare my  anus </br>  <br>I SUMMON MYSELF<br> steps forward </br></br>  <br>BUY FLUFFALS!</br>  Are Prophecy really so shit they can't hurt anybody? Because I like spellcasters and this is an xyz focused deck.  <br>You can probably fine tune it, but for the most part yes, Prophecy is shit.</br>  <br>They are? I remember people bitching about how broken they were. What happened. flat out outclassed by later sets or ban listed fucked them up good?</br>  <br>Isn't that banned though?</br>    <br>Banlist happened</br>  <br>Miami is in America ;)</br>  <br>And now, the only way they'll be back is if the power gap grows enough to make them a non-threat, their banned cards get an errata that shits all over them or Konami prints more xyz monsters for them like a rank 4 and 3. Sadly, there are no more of the arcana to adapt so they fucked up the ying yang.</br>  <br>This is maiami city tho ;)</br>  <br>We wont be seeing them again unless they start fucking with the power gap too much with Pendulum, which is a possibility, but I doubt it, since it seems they're making efforts to have all the summoning methods relatively balanced as best they can.</br>  <br>Cept fusion, synchro and ritual need a really big fucking buff to keep up with xyz and pendulum.</br>  Xyz is too weak right now it needs This card printed.  <br>Well fusion looks like it's starting to get individualized cards for everything. Ritual they almost never pay attention to outside of Black Luster and Nekroz, and Synchro, Synchro just needs better effects I think. <br><br>By next year I expect due to Pendulum and all the Rank 4 Xyzs that a lot of cards are going to get banned due to dumbass combos. <br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if the next summoning method will be like Pendulum Xyz/Synchro/Fusion where we'll get Synchro/Xyz and stuff like Synchros with Overlay Unit effects and all sorts of things. Could be neat.</br></br></br></br></br>  1 week and 4 days until KINGU.  <br>Chojiro will become a Cardian himself in a way  once he gets carded </br>  <br>Bad Shun, bad!</br>  <br>I mean, it's neat to see an ossan be part of the group, even if briefly, but at the same time it feels like he's just gonna die or be sacrificed in some way.</br>  <br>Fusion needs a Miracle Fusion that's not exclusive to Heroes, some way to off set that -2,more cards that fuse based on type and attribute rather than names and if they do continue that shitty trend the name material l monsters need to have effects that are worth it. <br><br>synchros need far more level 5, 6,7 and 8 synchros, <br><br>Rituals need ritual monsters and spells that can actually do shit more than ritual summon the monster and all ritual monsters should have built in protection from spells,traps, monster effects. <br><br>These 3 have a lot of work to do before they could ever be worth anything over a rank 4 xyz monster.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree, but I'll give Konami credit that they are trying to finally start making cards to keep up with Xyz at the very least. It's still gonna be awhile before it's all relatively balanced though. What they ban and don't ban though needs a serious look at sometimes, I feel like they just bang their heads on a table when it comes that more so than anything else.</br>  what is an "XYZ" anyway<br>why is it pronounced "x-sheezu"<br>is it XYZ or XZ</br></br>  <br>Because Exceed wasn't cool enough for Konami.</br>  <br>is just gonna end like Instant fusion splashable in some decks and even better in top decks.<br><br>but I am all for it if konami want us to play some degenerancy.</br></br></br>  <br>It would be the perfect topdecking card.</br>  <br>It means Exceeding it's just shortened to Xyz, because the way the Nips pronounce it is basically ik-seez, or their way of pronouncing Exceed, or X-yeez, it's weird, but Engrish, and yeah it's Xyz not Xz.</br>  <br><br>I see, thanks</br></br>  <br>XYZ variant when?</br>  <br>No problem man.<br><br>Probably for Kaiba in the new movie.</br></br></br>  <br>I see a smile there.</br>  <br>They can't make better Fusions until they ban Shadolls, because it'll just make Shadolls broke as fuck<br>They can't make better Synchros until they ban Quasar, because it'll just make Quasar broke as fuck<br>They can't make better Rituals until they ban Nekroz, because it'll just make Nekroz broke as fuck<br>It's a vicious cycle</br></br></br></br>    <br> Dark Rebellion XYZ XYZ Dragon Cannon </br>  <br> Make Nekroz broken <br> Make </br></br>  <br>No need to be tsun now.</br>  <br>I'm busy Shun go away.</br>  <br>How will making better synchros make quasar broke as fuck?</br>  <br>If there's one thing I know about Yugioh<br>It's that what is broke can be made even more broke if Konami makes the right moves</br></br>  <br><br><br>Guess we better make some new Ritual cards!<br><br>BUY NEKROZ</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Busy getting fat?</br>  <br>I'm simply stating they're already at that stage, you don't need to *make* them broken</br>      <br> If only you were here when Shun vs Sora aired, anon. <br> Shit was so hype. </br></br>  <br>omg, I read it in his voice...</br>  <br>What happened when MAXIMUM JIHAD?</br>  <br>I cant wait until the day that Shun gets absolutely destroyed, and I mean destroyed, he had a chance in that second duel. <br><br>This place is going to fucking explode.</br></br></br>  <br> Shun gets absolutely destroyed <br>pls no <br>that being said i can't wait until the day reiji gets destroyed</br></br></br>    <br> making memes for a character with literally 4 scenes </br>  <br> R-Ruri <br> W-what about heartulando? <br> Heartland? I've always lived in Academia <br>And then he died</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shun is going to go down hard. Reiji probably wont since he seems to be the main rival, he'll at least put up a fight, even if he's going to lose to Yuya or Leo eventually.<br><br>Can't wait.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm the one that brought them to Heartland silly~  Yugo Shokan </br>  <br>Serena is Ruri is still possible.<br>Seriously why are they hiding Ruri's design at this point. Is it just to foster shitty theories like the one I just typed and Ruri=Yuzu? Because come on.</br></br>  <br>It might make sense considering Yuri/Ruri, though I'm curious why Leo only calls her Serena-sama, he didn't say Yuzu-same when telling Yuri to go after her. <br><br>If anybody Yuzu has the best chance of actually being Ruri considering they both have that bird swoop, Yuto said Polymerization doesn't fit her, which is just an odd thing to say regardless of Fusion attacking Xyz, and then you have her mysterious birth and bracelet.</br></br></br>  <br>it's stabilized antimatter monsters</br>  <br>Nah. Ruri is being saved as a surprise. It'll feel like christmas once they show her.</br>  <br>I've been playing around with the unlikely idea that when the girls get to fusiontown, they're immediately mindwiped ala Masumi to believe they're Serena. But I guess with the childhood flashbacks that's not possible.<br><br>(I'm also the loser who keeps saying we won't be seeing Rin in person ever, which is why we get to see flashbacks of her.)</br></br></br>   Rewatching Shun vs Sora <br> Blaze Falcon is taken by Sora <br> Shun starts talking about always being prepared for their comrades being taken before playing Revolution Force <br>Ok yeah, Ruri is definitely gonna be brainwashed or some shit<br>And then Shun will rank her up into a Rank 6 Ruri</br></br></br></br>  <br>When Leo planned the Xyz dimension's destruction, he did not foresee the need for alliances. The Fusion users would sweep through the other dimensions, systematically exterminating their enemies and dismantling the proud xyz users. But the leo's vision was cynical. He did not count on the brave sacrifices the Xyz dimension's heroes were willing to make. After the Fusion's offensive seized the Heartland tower, Leo turned its sights to the synchro dimension,Believing the xyz Dimension was still recovering from its heavy losses, Fusion forces charged into Heartland Academy, where they were caught off guard by the full force of the Resistance's Army. The Resistance obliterated the Fusion squadron and the Battle of Heartland Academy became the Resistance's first major victory in the war.</br>  <br>KATTOBINGU DA<br>ORE</br></br>  <br>The news spread across the City, rekindling lost hopes and re-energizing exhausted defenders. The Resistance Army moved on to defend other battlefronts, but a courageous force of Duelist remained at heartland Academy to await the Fusion user's return. The vengeance of the Fusion came swiftly, elite fusion users army closed in on the Academy grounds to recoup their losses, but Professor Belth Allusis, seven dozen of the Resistance's finest duelist, and four thousand casual's players dug in to defend the Academy's grounds...or get carded trying. The disparity was staggering. An unprecedented Fusion army, fifty thousand strong, descended on Heartland Academy's brave defenders. The defenders were undaunted. With no expectations of survival, they were mindful of their duty.</br>  <br><br>But overconfident Fusion Professors threw all their armies' might into the direct assault and their ground forces fell in droves. For every Xyz duelist who was carded, ten Fusion users were killed. The Fusion professors was forced to call in reinforcements. Despite the defenders determination, their lines were whittled away until only a handful of Duelist remained. They rallied to Professor Allusis for a final stand. Fusion Professor Moff Zellos offered to spare Professor Allusis if he and his brave comrades would surrender. Neither pride nor foolhardiness drove the defender's decision. They were guided by their sidedeck. They had passed beyond the fear of death. Their glorious last stand will never be forgotten. Allusis and his men fell, but not before the Fusion users were driven to retreat. The Battle of Heartland Academy was a draw. The heroes of Heartland Academy inspired bold new xyz strategies that eventually halted the Fusion's advances. In retrospect, though, the Resistance lost too many duelsit in the early days of the war. The execution of the Leo's brilliant strategy was flawless. Survival was the best the Resistance could hope for.</br></br>  So, where the fuck is Yuri? Is he still at Standard? Or did he go back to Academia?  <br><br><br> same guy who kept posting edited Darth Bane quotes </br></br></br>  <br>You kidding? I loved Baneposter-kun.</br>  Yuya has gone full Yuzufag. Please imagine the link below comes complete with a shitty fadeout AMV of Tomato hallucinating his waifu:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sto<wbr>RjxrJavc</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>tumblr please go</br>    <br>Unless he's decided that wandering around Standard doing nothing for several days is a good use of his time, he's probably gone back to Academia for a scolding.</br>  BATTLE DA  <br>ENJOOOOOOOOOOY</br>  Meow~  So what makes the Fusion Dimension so much more deadly than the other dimensions anyways? <br><br>I mean I get the shitty logic that they're trying to fuse the dimensions, but why is fusion so good? They should in no way have had the advantage on Xyz. Makes me curious if GX characters actually are their teachers.</br></br>  <br>Probably because the Fusion dimension trained all their soldiers for war and invasion while Xyz dimension just dueled for fun</br>  <br>Even still they're just using generic decks for most of their soldiers and just trouncing most people. <br><br>That and it's pretty safe to assume that all the DM/GX/5Ds/Zexal characters barring the main characters exist in this weird dimensional rift/alternate timeline, so where are half of them even at? Also how do some characters even work such as say Kaiba? If KaibaCorp exists in Synchro, considering the Duel Runners, then what is he doing? Just retired, and if Kaiba would likely exist, I'd assume Pegasus and all the DM/GX characters exist within Synchro too, unless there is technically a Kaiba in both Standard and Fusion as well and they don't take place concurrently. <br><br>Ya know, I'm just confused by this whole stuff honestly. I know it's meant to just be callbacks, but I'm sure they have to have some type of explanation for it at the very least, I don't think they'd just do it without any type of plan whatsoever.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>artist?</br>  <br>Do not sexualize my monstah kado</br>  Soon  <br>Already ahead of ya there Standard. Two Ruris down, two to go.</br>  <br>Well, since Synchro exist due to Yliaster time travel fuckery, who knows the status of other essential characters such as Kaiba and Mokuba. Pegasus is dead though. Died in Duelist Kingdom.</br>  <br>Ok, I'll sexualize Selena then.</br>  <br>I lost my shit when they treated the fucking prison guard getting hit as a duel</br>  Are there any gifs/webms of Shun going Yusei on the guards yet?      <br>That's fine.</br>  <br><br>Thanks.</br></br>  <br> gif </br>  <br> gifs </br>  <br> gifs of Shun going Yusei on the guards </br>  So why are lancers selection being sent to do this and not like a swat team? They're just duelists.  Huh, Yuya's more of a carnivore than Sawatari is.  Tell me, /a/.<br><br>What other illicit drugs will Yuya and pals target in the next OPs?</br></br>  Why was Sawatari allowed to come with them? Didn't he like lick and sexually harass one of the female characters? Oh yeah, gotta send the potential rapist there, he's there to look after all the asses  <br>When the hell did that happen?<br>Are you accusing the great Neo New Sawatari of something he has not done? There's no bigger disgrace</br></br>  Explain this  Can someone more well-versed in the card game than me explain what monster is being portrayed in the poster?  <br>When he kidnapped Yuzu he was like, grabbing her and getting pretty close.</br>  <br>That's an Obelisk Force</br>  <br>I thought that was supposed to be Obelisk Force.</br>  <br>But he didn't kidnap her.<br>He has not ever touched Yuzu or any other females in any way either.</br></br>  <br><br>Oh, damn! I thought the 'head' part was the head and the 'shoulder blades' part was the tail, and this is some weird four-footed monster. Only now have I realized the other shoulder blade.<br><br>Thanks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're duel energy tanks. For storing duel energy.</br>  <br> Fusion needs a Miracle Fusion that's not exclusive to Heroes <br>So basically this: http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Soul_F<wbr>usion</wbr></br></br>  To whom else is Yuya going to spread his Yuzu.flac?  <br>The SWAT team would just get turned into cards dude.</br>  <br>He'll try to spread it to Jack.</br>  FREE THE ICE BARRIER DRAGONS  <br> tfw Yuya gets cucked by Jack. <br> tfw Jack/Yuzu becomes the new Jack/Carly <br>   But seriously, if Yuya gets cucked, it will be by Yugo (obvious), Shun (also obvious), or Reiji (because he wasn't enough of a troll as it is). </br></br></br>  <br>It would be outstanding if the straightest MC in YGO so far didn't end up with the girl he wanted so badly. Maybe you should try being indifferent towards her, Yuya!</br>  <br> Let's warn everyone about Yugo <br> NOT YUGO! FUGO! <br> oh right, but let's also make the person on the poster a silhouette so no one knows what they actually look like </br></br></br>  <br>Not even that guy. But you know that he is right.

The figmas look bwtter though.</br>  I live in US, is EMS worth 2k more yen than SAL? I don't mind waiting 2-3 weeks longer.

I've never had any problems with heat</br>    alter chitoge when  <br>Was the figure brand new? It shouldn't happening to a new figure unless you stored it in your oven</br>  <br>Depends on what figure and where you live.<br><br>Could be semen from factory workers.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a bit spotty. Not horrible, but it's definitely the low point of the figure.</br>  How do you buy preorder from some other user in MFC from Amiami?  <br>Under my bed, which is next to the window. It is winter, however; heat would come from the heater which is never on considerably high.</br>  <br>They change the shipping address to your address</br>  <br>Would be easier to ask them</br>  Should I order Steins;Gate Zero now or wait and see if there's a special edition?

It's always a GK.</br>  <br>I have a plan for all the figures I have preordered currently. After that, I'm going to start running into some serious space issues.

Oh and Miku shit.</br></br>  <br>A few RAHs are ok. This one isn't one of them. Even less so considering the price.<br><br><br>Haven't experienced any problem with the clothing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You'll realize that every pet fur or your pubes will merge with the RAH's clothing on contact.
