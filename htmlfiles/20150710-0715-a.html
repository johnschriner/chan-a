[ SANJI REDEMPTION EDITION<br><br>So now that it's confirmed that it's not Sanji vs Big Mom's crew, but Sanji vs. Bug Mom's crew and a supernova + his crew, there is only one way left for sanji to redeem himself<br><br> We see capone laughing at the strawhats <br> suddenly Sanji is stand at the front fucked more than zoro back at Thriller bark <br> capone shots him NOT dead, but Sanji is out  <br> we see that Tamago and Pekoms lie defeated behind the passed out behind sanji <br><br>That's the only possible way to not make Sanji suddenly OP, but still relevant.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Capone and his crew were looking towards the sky. It makes me think the Sunny flew away and Capone is personally going to hunt them down.  So much happening this chapter<br><br> All the rest of the supernovas confirmed okay <br> Smoker essentially admitting that he and Tashigi aren't happy with the government <br> We've seen Kaidos full shape which means he's a new character <br> Fuji possibly resigning from Admiral position </br></br></br></br></br>  If they're not already banging I'd be surprised but she's his side chick at best as Hina's his main squeeze. Though as the leader of an all male crew I can't imagine Hina isn't getting a different dick every week  <br> edition <br>Stay cancerous.</br></br>  <br><br>In reference to Smoker X Tashigi</br></br>  <br> edition </br>  I dont understand one thingâ€¦<br><br>Doffy said after the war that he would quit if the WG kept pestering him. Then he is forced to quit by Law and he shits himself.<br><br>Was he just bluffing with the WG officer back then?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Pekoms lie defeated  <br>Pekoms' bounty is just 10 million less than Doflamingo's. I am not saying he AS strong as Doflamingo... but he is Vergo's level at least for sure. He would wreck Sanji badly.<br>And Tamago is implied to be even stronger.</br></br></br>   Urouge last seen on a lightning-covered island called "Raijin island" <br> Mysterious person comes to his rest stop in the clouds <br><br>I wonder what this could mean...</br></br></br>  It felt so good to read the mangastream scan, I could finally understand what the fuck was going on.<br><br>Btw<br><br> Kidd alliance going after Shanks <br>Fucking called it. I personally think they are going to get rekt hard.</br></br></br></br></br>  KidHawPoo vs. StrawHeart when?  <br>SHIT. I forgot to mention this in my happening.</br>  <br>Shanks looks really evil there, I hope Killer defeats all of them including his own captain.</br>  Capone Bege confirmed for working for mom  <br>this makes me think that the strawheart expands with the kaido arc adding x drake so that its 3 vs 3 supernova clash. lots of subtle himts this chapter</br>  <br>Anyone who didn't think Kaido was a new character is an idiot</br>  <br><br>Do you guys think Luffy will try to defend Shanks from them?</br></br>  <br>I mentioned it because of the retards saying that he wasn't.</br>  <br> edition <br>typical release day cancer</br></br>  Have we seen every Supernova post-timeskip now?<br> Luffy, Zoro, Law: on Dressrosa <br> Kid, Killer, Apoo, Hawkins: somewhere allied <br> Bonney: stealing pizza <br> Urouge: meeting Enel <br> Capone: working for Big Mom <br> Drake: working for Kaido <br>Yup, 11 total. Everyone is back.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> nice quints </br>  <br>You mean 4x4<br> Killer vs Zoro swordfight <br> Luffy vs Kid <br> Apoo vs Law, intangible sound goes aginst his ability to rearrange things <br> Hawkins vs Drake ? <br><br>I forgot how little we know of Hawkins power</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If he even gets wind of this, he will stop at nothing to rescue the man he promised to return his strawhat to. For the sake of pottery, he will.</br>  <br> Urouge: meeting Enel <br>I'm calling it now Urouge will become a Yonkou at the end of the series called "the highest priest". OC do not steal.</br></br>  Is Bonny okay? I couldn't deal with the shitty panda translation  <br>nah luffy would do the same that he did back in thriller bark when ace was dying<br> lol I ain't helping, it's his own adventure! </br></br>  <br>Yeah, she's like:<br> "Damn, these guys are fucking shit up all over. I'm glad to be part of the same generation." </br></br>  <br> called the highest priest <br><br>I can dig it. Not original but I like it.</br></br></br>  <br> Do you guys think Luffy will try to defend Shanks from them? <br><br>No. More like wanting to fuck them up for going after Shanks first. But we won't even get that far. Scratchman's and Hawkins' crews are going to get crushed by Red Hair's crew, for hype's sake, while Killer might end up defecting, in exchange for sparing his captain's life, leaving Kidd a broken mess at some port town somewhere in the New World.</br></br></br>  /a/, you have the royalties  <br><br> what is the Impel Down arc </br></br>  <br>I'm really disappointed that all the Wizard of Oz theories don't work now without Big Mom as the Wicked Witch</br>  <br>He might be like<br> "I'm not pirate king yet. I can't face him right now." <br>Or<br> "Shanks and his guys are strong. They can handle it." <br>Or what you said.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, AFTER Ace lost. Liffy wouldn't interfere before Shanks can even fight to his heartscontent.</br>  <br><br> Implying Kaido isn't Chopper. </br></br>  <br>That's not Kaido. It's a shadow of a building in the Wano country.<br><br>You can tell by the trees, the shape, and the plot is clearly leading them there.</br></br></br>  <br>Mah nigga. Best ship</br>  <br>Did you see those horns?<br>Kaido is  Chopper's deer dad who hate from the Hito Hito no Mi Model:  Giant  Zoan</br></br>  <br><br>Hereee's Kaido</br></br>  <br> mfw <br><br>Would that be the ultimate twist in anything ever?</br></br></br>  <br><br>I doubt Wano is a winter island.<br><br>It was Kaido, he is huge as fuck. He probably prefers winter islands because his Zoan form is an animal that likes cold(?)</br></br></br></br>  It's time to Post your 3 worst theories /a/ !<br><br> Kaido is a dwarf with Dragon Zoan. <br><br> Big Mom fell in love with sanji and want him to cook for her eternally. <br><br> Doflamingo is    Sanji's father  </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>how can it be enel? Isn't he on the moon?</br>  <br>kaido is a beetle</br>  <br> I doubt Wano is a winter island. <br><br>It's Japan with a population that are immune to colds. Shit just got real.</br></br></br>  I don't like new Akainu's look. He was scarier and more stern looking when he was cleanly shaved. He looked like a super-powerful lawyer which he is supposed to be. <br>Now with beard and cigar he looks like some mafia boss. Not very fitting for the face of justice.</br>  <br>he got there, he can get back</br>  <br>He always had the Yakuza look</br>  <br>Why are all the Yonkou such huge motherfuckers? What do they put in the NW's water?</br>  <br>you are right</br>  <br>pic related<br><br><br> implying Eneru will have anything to do with the world of the humans again <br>A god should behave like one and not interfere with the wars of filthy humans.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Luffy wants to capture it. <br> He befriends it. <br>Could be fun but anticlimatic</br></br></br>  <br>other than big thing in the mist the silhouettes don't really match</br>  <br> Kaido is an ant zoan </br>  <br>Fitting for his justice.</br>  <br>Oda always change the designs of character that only appeared as silhouettes. Look at Blackbeard during Drum's arc and Kanjurou during early dressrosa and you'll see.</br>  <br><br>Dunno, the only "normal" one is Shanks. And even with one arm he is strong as fuck.<br><br>The other 3 seem like heartless monsters</br></br></br></br>  <br>Worst like dumbest or worst ones you still like?<br><br>My favorite bad one is that Monet died and her fruit respawned on one of Nami's tangerines. Someone unknowingly eats it</br></br></br>  <br>Any idea why they are specifically going after shanks? i thought shanks was pretty chill and just drink and eat food all day.</br>  <br><br><br><br> &gt;Urouge: meeting Enel <br><br>Time to share it.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Anc<wbr>wu_9KFTk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If he's so chill then they might think he's the easier target</br>  <br>because shanks is the only one not involved in the story yet<br><br>and blackbeard is end game so cant get him yet</br></br></br>  <br><br>Same with Kaido's human form. First it was the mustache guy and then this one with the mask.</br></br>  <br>Vergo is alive and ate the Axolotl Devil fruit to regenerate himself.</br>  <br><br>Nobody would be dumb enough to go against Blackbeard who has like a billion DF powers. Also, Kuzan.</br></br>  <br>it's not a mask. but yeah the design changed</br>  <br>thats hajrudin</br>  woah<br><br>first request page that doesn't have "crew member interacts with animal"</br></br>  I BELIEVE IN FUJITORA  <br> Big Mom fell in love with sanji and want him to cook for her eternally <br>I like it.</br></br>  <br>pinocchio and tengu are animals.</br>  <br>technically, Usopp is interacting with Chopper</br>  <br> there are people who didn't think Zatoichi is a badass </br>  <br><br>He always looked like a Mafia (or rather, Yakuza) boss</br></br>  Holy shit this chapter was fucking good. I didn't think we'd get into between-arc worldbuilding for another chapter or two. <br> Fujitora giving no fucks and not backing down <br> Gorousei all upset <br> randoms mad about loss of Smile so Law and Luffy are going to be in even MORE danger <br> Kaidou has beetle-like horns so he might actually be a beetle zoan  <br> Kuzan involved with Blackbeard (reminded me of the anon who actually called that) but I wonder why he's involved with Blackbeard <br><br><br>That's a Leviathan. I think it is supposed to be explained but who knows when.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>guise, what if kaido is a beetle zoan?</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit am I only the second one checking them?</br>   mfw this chapter alone is more interesting than all Dressrosa chapters combined   <br>Kuzan probably works with blackbeard to either set him up or to get something out of it. Maybe it's to sabotage the navy?</br>  <br>Oh and I forgot one of the most important bits<br> Smoker + Friends going to Vegapunk's laboratory <br> VEGAPUNK'S LAB <br>Maybe we'll get our VEGAPUNK reveal soon? HYPE</br></br></br></br>  <br>he's fat after all</br>  <br>Ussop sniping Sugar was better.</br>  <br>stop exaggerating like a faggot</br>  <br>Where do you ducks even come up with this shit?</br>   Akainu gets shit on by his superiors AND subordinates   <br> Thread is mainly discussion and speculation instead of rampant shitposting <br>This is truly a Christmas miracle.</br></br>  Even Akainu is mad at the Gorosei<br><br>Shieeeeeet.</br></br>  with all these reveals and new info, what can we expect for 800?<br><br> kaido <br> vegapunk <br> sanji and co <br> new bounties </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Barely did shit to help with the battle in Dressrosa precisely because he wanted to show how powerless and corrupt Marine "justice" really was <br> Makes an open apology on behalf of the Marines specifically to avoid another Alabasta situation <br> effectively renounces his position as Admiral and talks mad shit straight to Akainu <br><br>this nigga right here</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Luffy.</br></br>  <br>Marine/WG Civil War arc when?</br>  <br>Here, you dense prick.</br>   Fujitora already telling Akainu to eat shit <br>he really knows how to pick them</br>  <br>notice the flag? that was on big mom's ship. its already been discussed and confirmed in previous thread you fucking speedreading faggot</br>  Where are all the "hurrrrrrr why does Fujitora not defeat Doflamingo?" faggots now?  <br>It's great.</br>  <br><br>Look at the page again. Plus, they are going after Caesar.</br></br>  YO YO YO WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT SHIT ABOUT KUZAN JOINING UP WITH BLACKBEARD  Reminder that Kaido is this  <br>I hope it's Vegapunk. That's one of the BIG reveals. Would be fucking awesome to have it now.<br><br><br>Interesting. Thanks, anon.<br><br><br> speedreading <br>I don't remember every flag design. Sorry, boss.  No sarcasm. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What if that's the 7th Shichibukai?</br>  <br>Another fucking retarded slowpoke</br>  <br><br>Doffy has the upper hand of WG because he knows about the hidden treasure in Mariejoas. He could ask the WG anything and blackmail them threatening to tell the world everything.<br><br>Doffy only shat himself because he was afraid that Kaidou would kill him, not because Law demanded him to resign from Schichibukai. He had a plan how to take down both Luffy and Law knowing they would come to Dressrosa, but as we all know the plan failed.</br></br></br></br>  So it's Fujitora vs Alliance next. How the hell is he gonna justify this in the public's eye now? He already bowed and made a spectacle of admitting that he fucked up and now he's gonna fight the nation's greatest hero?<br><br>what the hell?</br></br>  <br>YO YO YO YO KUZAN GOT A GRUDGE AGAINST SAKAZUGAY<br>BLACKBEARD PROLLY TRYNA START SOME SHIT WITH THE WG<br>OR KUZAN JUST FUCKIN WIT HIM; SET HIM UP FOR A FALL</br></br></br>  <br>ooo</br>  <br>He's not, learn reading comprehension.</br>  <br> yfw Vegapunk is a wacky mad/scientist whose whole gimmick is that he's clumsy but genius </br>  <br>He's not going to go after the Straw Hats and Law.</br>   The Marines are puppets of the World Government <br> World Government are puppets of the Celestial Dragons <br> Celestial Dragons reside at what is known as the holy land Mariejois (Heaven) <br> Celestial Dragons = Gods <br> D = Devils = God natural enemy  <br><br>Full circle.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit learn to read</br>  <br>can you not read or was the panda translation THAT bad</br>  <br>I'm curious to see the leaders of the Tenryuubito.</br>   implying Fujitora will not be Luffy's nakama   <br> or was the panda translation THAT bad <br>it was, oh god it was</br></br>  <br>Doffy is restrained by sea stone right now. Akainu could just melt him right now, or for 2 weeks straight if Doffy tries some Armament Haki shit.<br>Now if he has some contacts on standby ready to leak the secret, then Doffy would have an edge. But right now, no.</br></br>  Shanks is going to wreck Kid <br><br>Just like how Whitebeard wrecked Crocodile.<br><br>Actually i'm betting Shanks will send Rockstar up against Kid just for the shits and giggles</br></br></br></br>  <br>Welcome to... I don't know, 6 years ago?</br>  <br>bring their heads back, I will wait for you<br><br>Just what I want to hear.</br></br></br>  everybody keep in mind this is LITERALLY 3 days after Straw Hats 2 year absence. they shat all over the New World in less than half a week getting CP0, Big Mom, and Kaido after em in the process.<br><br>they're probably gonna get one piece by the end of the week at this rate.</br></br>  <br><br>During Law's speech at Punk Hazard all of the Yonko were shadowed.</br></br>  <br>He might be sarcastic about the "friends" part, he might be not. But Ceasar is also important to Kaido. So whether he's working for Law, Big Mom, Kaido, himself or someone else entirely is still up to debate.</br>  So how many more "world reaction" chapters to you think we have left? I feel like there's just going to be one, and the rest will be Dressrosa chapters.  Why does Akainu still look like a normal admiral?  <br>This week's panda was Xusasu Basasu level.</br>  <br>Probably true, seeing how Tashigi wants to take the kids to him. And I don't think Vegapunk is another Caesar who those fucked up experiments, because Tashigi couldn't be so evil as to deliver him children to torture.</br>  <br>Did they not include the second part of that dialogue?</br>  <br>Yeah, you can't read.</br>  So fuji vs trastraw next chapter?  <br>What are you talking about they partied for a week at fishmen island</br>  <br>Fujitora is basically saying:<br> "Yeah, eat shit, sakazugay!" </br></br>  <br> yfw the big twist is Fujitora as next straw hat </br>  <br>It deserved the royalties.</br>  <br>That's what he did all chapter.<br><br>Fujitora confirmed for currently owning a pair of the biggest balls in One Piece world.</br></br></br>  <br>nah nigga this was pain of sabo and issho's victory on steroids. did panda's translator have a stroke mid-translating?</br>  I feel bad for Akainu. The WG mocks him and Fujitora talks back to him after he chose him to become an admiral.<br><br><br>edit of 'just fuck my shit up' Sakazuki when?</br></br></br>  <br>not happening<br><br>he meant that he doesn't give a shit about being essentially renounced of his title</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that's way more clear than what Panda had. Was oarticularly shitty this week.</br>  <br>speedreader aint you? they left the day after they arrived and punk hazard that same day. confirmed by camie requesting a day off to see them off</br>  <br> Oda said the next straw hat would be an "ancient leader" in an old interview <br>Goddamn it.</br></br>  <br> feeling bad for the man who killed ace <br>nah fuck him</br></br>  At what point do you think will we get to see Green Ox in action? What will his action be?  <br>Well its no surprise to know that some supernovas are teaming with Yonkous.<br>As Law said "The only way of living in the New World is teaming with a Yonkou or fighting them"</br></br>  <br> trusting anime with anything </br>  <br>where did he say that? thatd be huge news for speculation</br>  <br><br>We might see one more "world reaction" chapter. Maybe one more "good ruler comes back into power" chapter, a "party" chapter and a "new threat" chapter, followed by an "escape" chapter. Then a big reveal at chapter 800. I'm hoping Kaido, but I'ld be happy to see Big Mom in full doing something too.</br></br>  <br>Akainu status : Fracture Anus</br>  <br>Now I really wonder who the Gorosei actual are, since they dont seem to be Celestial Dragons</br>  <br>no idea, The color and animal motifs were easy to identify in the original admirals, but Fujitora's been full of surprises.<br><br>only thing we can probably reliably speculate would be which old Japanese actors to expect his design to based on.</br></br></br>  <br>this exactly<br><br>no sympathy for the man who killed best boy</br></br></br>  <br>I'm searching it. At the time everyone assumed it was Jinbei.</br>  <br>would be interesting if he went for someone recent like ken watanabe</br>  <br>Yeah, I made a similar post earlier.<br><br>Seems that they're strictly the WG leaders but not involved in any royalty or nobility.</br></br></br>  Why the hell do we still not know the name of Fuji's DF?  <br>jesus christ, dressrosa really will end up taking 100 chapters. wano will probably be 150</br>  <br>Wasn't that for Marine Ford ? Like "the next person to help Luffy will be an ancient enemy" ?</br>  <br>Because super serious people don't name their attacks "fruit fruit _____"</br>  <br>What makes you think he has a devil fruit? Maybe it is just really good observation haki.</br>  <br> fujitora next strawhat <br> jinbe will come back <br> luffy will reunite with sanji and the others <br> law alliance <br> the samurai guys <br><br>there are too many characters in this shit, oda can't give them all the panel time they deserve so next arc will be another clusterfuck like dressrosa (not that I didn't like it), with throwaway enemies being defeated in one or two panels by one of the millions of good guys and if they separate it will be years before we see the other half of the group like sanji's group is being handled right now</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>cause he aint a poser than needs to name his attacks or always introduce his DF in a fight.</br>  <br> good ruler comes back into power <br>Somewhat speaking of, I noticed one of the panels had someone using weapons from Loflumingo to fight. I wonder if it could have been a group trying to get its country back, or civil war, or any other number of plausible incidents. The group had to surrender since they could no longer get weapons.</br></br>   mfw Akainu realizes Fuji is about to fuck him up and buster calls Dressrosa next chapter <br><br> I know it's never going to happen, but I would love it </br></br>  <br>Its going to be Toshiro Mifune as Yojimbo<br> hard exterior, bad attitude <br> mischievous <br> violent, enjoys fighting <br> ambivalent with a reluctant sense of duty <br>I think he'd be a perfect foil to Fujitora, though there'd be some overlap with Kizaru's personality<br><br><br>Are you serious?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> edit of 'just fuck my shit up' sakazuki when? <br><br>I tried.</br></br></br>  <br>They're already there nigga, maybe we will continue to see the kids with Vegapunk<br>HYPE</br></br>  <br><br> Haki controlling fucking meteorites </br></br>  <br> Are you serious? <br>No, of course not. Why can't we be silly anymore?</br></br>  <br><br>eternal fuccboi<br><br> gets shat on by a half-dead Whitebeard <br> shanks makes him soil his pants <br> can only defeat someone relevant from behind or when he has elemental advantage <br> WG slaps him back into bitchboy status <br> Fujitora gives him major burns </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What can buster calls possibly do against the current power levels? Fucking Barto can solo the buster call and sink the whole fleet.</br>  <br>Re-read that page. They have a few days left until they reach his lab.</br>  <br>He is going to be a nice old man that's great with kids<br>but has a plan to destroy the world</br></br>  <br><br>Yea sry, I kinda meant "had" not "has". <br><br>Luffy and Law made huge favor for WG here.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Akainu status: loins on lava </br>  <br>Because people are legitimately stupid in these threads and I can't tell whats a joke. Look how many people seriously didn't know Kuzan was with Blackbeard</br>  <br>imagine if it is Coby<br><br> anon stop being retarded that is impossible <br><br>a man can dream</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>op discussions are serious business<br><br>also fujitora singlehandedly shut all the fujifags AND doffyfags in one chapter. good day to be a op reader</br></br></br>  <br>not bad as a first try.<br><br> that filename </br></br></br>  <br>If you think about it, he's the guy who took the most damage from Whitebeard as well. Kuzan and Borsalino didn't even get touched by Whitebeard.<br><br>He probably only won the match cause it's magma vs ice and we all know how Pokemon logic works.</br></br></br>  <br>I actually didn't know that and I just reread Dressrosa.</br>  <br>if Kizaru showed up I'm pretty sure he would scare shitless a lot of people</br>  Isshou for next crew member?  <br>wish luffy heard how buttpained he made sakazuki today</br>  <br>Shirohige fucking pierced Kuzan, even though he recovered quickly.</br>  <br>We've already seen Coby post-timeskip though. He's only a  Captain . I don't think he'll be anything more than a joke character inspired by Luffy, sadly.</br>  <br>Kizaru isn't part of buster calls. Those are carried out by vice admirals. Unless mother fucking Jonathan brings his G-8 fleet across the new world no one has to worry about anything.</br>  <br>Kuzan and Borsalino also didn't press his luck taunting in the front lines and going mano a mano.<br><br>He took the most damage, but he also got most done.</br></br></br>  <br>you must have a learning disability /a/non</br>  <br>He did make Kuzan lose a leg, too.</br>  <br>Which is bad, why?</br>  <br>Generally it seems that admiral-levels can somehow negate haki damage, Kuzan smashed into pieces and only sustained minor damage, and Akainu got his neck slashed and didnt mind.</br>  <br>it didn't actually pierce him, it was about to hit him but Kuzan used ice logia shenanigans and made a hole where the weapon was supposed to strike<br><br><br>are you sure? I thought buster calls required the intervent of an admiral</br></br></br></br>  <br>is that part of film z canon?</br>  <br>And Kuzan took a good chunk of a part of his ear.<br><br>I think it's an even trade, really.</br></br></br>    <br>Yeah.<br><br>The story wasn't canon but the characters are canon. If that makes sense.</br></br></br>  <br> a part of an ear for a whole leg is an even trade <br><br>makes sense</br></br></br>  <br>I actually believe Coby will be Luffys last opponent</br>  <br>Buster calls are given out by admirals, but they aren't present at the siege</br>  <br> Didn't press their luck <br> Kizaru is standing right next to Whitebeard 3x <br> Turns around to try and shoot Luffy <br> Gets interrupted by Whitebeard cleaving him with the glaive <br><br>Oh yeah, totally didn't press their luck or anything. It's not like Kizaru fucking smashed his dick in Whitebeard's face or anything, why would the old man get serious?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can regrow a leg with logia, but you can't regrow pretty faces!</br>  <br>well my dad died in the middle of dressrosa so my mom might be next in wano. im just hyper aware now of how long op will go and the chance of me missing the end due to death.</br>  <br>I see, seems like I was misremembering things</br>  <br>Not really, it looks like his ear was just split; an entire chunk isn't missing</br>  <br>yeah, designs and backstory are canon just not the actual events. cool.</br>  <br>It will probably be an epilogue chapter or something where they fight and laugh with each other for 10 years or something.</br>  <br> part of his ear <br> His whole fucking leg <br><br>It wasn't even, that's why Akainu won</br></br></br></br>  Think we'll get any more entire crew vs. singular opponent fights? I sure hope so. Even  Strong World  had it in the first skirmish against  Shiki . I wanna see more fightan interaction.  <br>It baffles me too, but I don't think it's that unthinkable that someone might not recall a single off-hand comment that Burgess made on the phone with Blackbeard like fifty chapters ago</br>  <br>Well no fucking shit, mister genius.<br><br>Why the fuck can't we be silly? Why does everything need three answers calling somone retarded, if the post was obviously a joke?</br></br></br>  <br>Coincidentally my dad also died in the middle of Dressrosa.</br>  <br>Jeez anon, this thread got dark real fast.</br>  <br>it's fair. It's hard to remember all OP facts sometimes</br>  <br> coby and luffy laugh continuously for a decade <br>sounds plausible. oda could make it work</br></br>  <br><br> overshadowing Zoro with Zatoichi <br><br>nah man, nah</br></br></br></br>  <br>Zoan Admiral would be perfect.

Theres a difference between having a map of what you THINK the world is, and a map of what it really is.

It's 9 arcs at most, but some of them can be big arcs like Dressrosa. There is also a chance we get some smaller arcs, although those have been quite rare as of late.<br>I would put the Reverie and the Revolutionaries (and maybe the final war) in the same arc.

So... Raftel, Final war.</br>  <br>I thought that was just the news of Dressrosa piling on top of the other shit.</br>  <br>I hope so, that would neat. Though I find suspicious that we didn't get Crocodile's reaction to Doffy's downfall.

I've got a regular Kindle and I went and turned a few manga jpgs into a file that thing can read but the screen is just too small.

Why not just buy a normal android tablet?</br>  I use a Kindle fire. 9.5 inch screen is big enough to read everything except the occasional two page spreads that I need to zoom in on.  <br>uses e-ink display instead of lcd/led<br>viewing experience is more akin to reading print on paper<br>no color though</br></br></br>  <br>It's a dedicated book reader. Its screen doesn't put out any light like tablets and computer screens and its really easy on the eyes plus it's very power efficient. It looks like ink on a piece of plastic. I recommend it for anyone that does any serious amount of reading, except of course the manga thing I mentioned above.</br>  <br>They used to have these special "E-Ink" displays that made reading them really comfortable, it's like a dynamic piece of paper. As far as I'm aware most modern kindles ditched it favor of regular LED displays, which makes the entire thing completely pointless.</br>  I tried it on my kindle touch. It's possible but generally a pain in the ass and not worth it.<br>The device is just not made for viewing this kind of stuff. Maybe other e-readers would be better in that case, possibly try a "open" e-reader like a koboor something.</br>  I use a 7 inch tablet, it's big enough for the most part. <br><br> I know it doesn't look like /a/ related, what with its complete lack of best girls or every-day-till-you-like-it <br>Not sure why you think it's a good idea to belittle /a/ while asking for help.</br></br></br>  <br>ah, thanks /a/non</br>  <br>There is only one model that doesn't use the eink display.<br><br><br> screen too small <br>That's what the DX is for.</br></br></br></br></br>  I prefer to buy the actual manga, there are some exceptions for manga I would read online and that's only because it isn't printed, such as tomo-chan  <br> Oh, and please don't delete my thread. I know it doesn't look like /a/ related, what with its complete lack of best girls or every-day-till-you-like-it, but it's about manga. <br>Your post was fine right up to this line.

I'm sure if half the "incurable hikikomori" in this thread were cutoff from daddy's money and internet they'd have a job in a week.</br>  <br>Especially if you aren't a NEET. <br>I think anyone should watch it.

That's all I can say</br>  Kind of the same. I was  homeschooled  so I'm used to staying inside all day everyday. <br><br>Only difference was I thought once I finished school I'd be out of here but that isn't the case.

His mind and body constantly are pressured, from both within and without. <br>Those pent-up grudges become endless feelings of hatred toward society. They become rage. <br>However, the largest source of rage is his own personal cowardice. <br>He is poor because he lacks the skill with which to earn money. He has no girlfriend because he lacks charisma. But the process of seeing <br>this truth and acknowledging his own incompetence requires quite a bit of courage. No human beings, regardless of who they might be, want to look directly at their own shortcomings. At this point, the conspiracy theorist projects his cowardice onto the <br>outside world. He creates a fictitious "enemy" outside of himself. <br>Enemy. My enemy. Society's enemy. <br>"Because an enemy conspires to do evil, I cannot find happiness. <br>Because of this conspiracy, I cannot find a girlfriend. That's right! This is all because of the Jews. Because the Jews are scheming away out there, <br>I can't find happiness. Damn you, Jews! I won't forgive you!" <br>Truthfully, this kind of thinking also inconveniences Jewish people. <br>All conspiracy theorists need to look a little more closely at reality. <br>"Enemies" don't exist externally. "Evil" does not exist externally. One <br>has to assume blame oneself for being a worthless person. <br>It's definitely not a Jewish conspiracy, nor a CIA conspiracy, andâ€” obvious as this may beâ€”it's not an alien conspiracy.

I made friends, have a large social group, go to parties every weekend. Yet despite being what most people would call a normal fag I feel worse than I ever have. It's like I just want to be left alone to die. Everyone always wants to hang out with me and do things with me but it feels like everytime i leave the house i have to put on a barely functioning human suit and act the way everyone thinks I am. The only thing that fills the cracks in my suit and makes it believable is alcohol. I feel like bozo the clown in that story where he goes to see a doctor. It just feels like there's no escape from the life ive built and if I wasnt my moms only surviving family member i'd probably kill myself.  <br><br> Barely 26. There was schooling intermittently and even a real job at one point. <br><br>Almost, brothers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it can always go worse</br>  <br> 9 Years </br>  <br> mfw I passed Satou's age and my life is going nowhere. </br>  <br><br>I think you missed the message of the show. The show made me realize that what I'm doing is okay.</br></br>  <br>It's time.</br>  In some ways, my life is significantly better. I've got a steady job that pays alright and I just got a raise. I'm no longer terrified of dealing with people, and I can handle social contact smoothly and just as well as anyone else. I feel like I can actually talk to other people for the first time in my life.<br><br>But in other ways, not much has changed at all. I'm still lonely. I still don't have many friends. And while it's much easier for me to deal with people and make casual conversation, I still have a hard time making friends and forming and sustaining any kind of meaningful social contact. I still spend my weekends alone. I still think of all the things I wish I had done differently.<br><br>But I'm better. And I've been getting better. And this show helped me confront a number of things about myself that I don't think I could have dealt with otherwise. Fucking love NHK.<br><br>The soundtrack is killer, too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you need a hug anon?</br>  <br> I still spend my weekends alone <br>T-this isn't normal?</br></br>  Reminder: productive NEETs are happier than NEETs who don't do anything  <br> you just haven't found it yet. <br>I have. It's called anime.<br><br>There's been couple of times where I made up some shit about how I still had work to do when my colleagues ask me to join them watch some games, just so that I can watch anime at home instead.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know. I wouldn't know, honestly. I feel like people at least get out every now and then, but I don't have much of a frame of reference. <br><br>There's also the problem that I still talk to myself more than I talk to other people. Like I'm so starved for real conversation that I have to make it with myself.<br><br>I feel a lot better, but I feel like I can objectively say that I've still got a few screws loose.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ugh I joined the military, but I think that made my life worse.</br>    <br> community college <br> hard <br><br>If niggers can do it, you can do it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I filed a form to join the military a year ago, still haven't given them the final papers on my medical check up</br>  <br>This is such a bullshit piece of advice.<br><br>I feel like I'm constantly on the verge of a total emotional breakdown that can and will happen at any moment. I get pissed off at the most menial shit. I get sad when I see a cheesy kids toy or a frozen dinner. I casually think of killing myself at least a few times a week. And worst of all, I think of the plane scene from The Dark Knight Rises EVERY FUCKING DAY SEVERAL TIMES A DAY.<br><br>Who the fuck would want to see that?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You gotta steam off that anger somehow anon.

Dead serious. <br><br>Hazing.<br>They were being hazed.</br></br></br></br>  I'm such an idiotic piece of shit that I had to look up a synopsis to make sense of the last episode. Luckily I understood most of it, I just wasn't sure if  Satou actually believed in the NHK and was really hallucinating or if he was just trying to give Misaki something to blame her troubles on .<br><br>Unfortunately, despite identifying with Satou, I didn't feel much towards the end. At first I thought it was going to be a life-changing experience for me but then it basically turned into 'lol just get a job and it'll be ok' and that really pissed me off.</br></br>  <br>No, it's more like "Just get a job and strat working yourself out of that petty life instead of waiting for someone to save you".</br>   NHK thread <br>Nice<br> Misaki thread <br>Noice<br> thread infested with frogshit and feels niggers <br>Thanks /r9k/</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 'lol just get a job and it'll be ok' <br>It's actually kinda ambiguous cause Satou could revert back to hikkikomori in the future. Anime Satou had it better cause Misaki is still on his side. Novel Satou on the other hand...</br></br>  <br>What are you talking about? Novel Satou also has Misaki.</br>  <br>I kind of remember she went back to school and left Satou or something.

Is it possible to do 12 hours of online community college a week? <br>fuck the online shit, it's just way too easy to blow it off. just go to live college. you don't even have to associate with anyone. just go, sit in the classroom, and write down everything the teacher says in a notebook. you don't need to feel self-conscious, everyone is a failure just like you. <br><br>after class, you go straight back home and finish watching shit anime like you planned. you'll see the whole thing only takes a few hours from your day, two or three times a week at most, and you'll get a B. if you actually do homework you'll get straight A's. seriously, professors are not allowed to fail entire classes, so they dumb the shit down hard and do things like add 10 points to everyone's final grade at the end, so even the lowest white trash who struggled through high school can pass.</br></br></br></br>  I'm better now, I have a job I enjoy. travel is a bitch though  <br>Online is actually better for the socially inept.<br><br>Save yourself the commute, and save yourself the time.<br>The time you spend driving to school can be spent watching anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And then what?

That was after about 5 years from the age of 16 as a shut in.<br><br>I empathise with Satou at the end of the novel, it's not that he or I ever became a normie, it's how long you wonder you can keep saying "How long can I go like this?".</br></br></br>  <br>It's not too late anon, keep fighting, there's always a happy ending in sight.</br>  <br><br>"happy ending"<br><br>read the book<br><br>there is no happy ending.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  You know, not too bad.

Man, if I had any idea what awaited me I would have dropped out of college and started working my way up the corporate ladder earlier.</br>  Looks like I'm late, happy 9th NHK.<br><br>Anons, if you could go back in time, would you change anything? <br><br>What would you do to change it?</br></br></br></br>  It's fucking 9 years and people are still talking about this?<br><br>Misaki is never going to come, anon.. It's been 9 years and she's probably busy fucking chad's thundercock by now.</br></br>  <br>Nah, she's more likely to have either committed suicide or be in some psychiatric ward.</br>  <br>Jesus fuck this came out 9 years ago?.... What.... where has all my time gone... WHY AM I STILL IN THE SAME PLACE...</br>  <br><br>No, she's going to go back to school, get hit on by chad because she's a qt 3.14, grow her hair out, and start dating.<br><br>Come to think about it,<br><br> which character from another anime would Misaki be in 9 years? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>9 years ago? Good.<br><br>Now I smoke shard, drink like a Irishman and have a mountain of unboxed figures and dakimakura covers. It's fucking great.  I'll be dead in two years though. Sage. </br></br></br>  <br> go back to school <br> start dating <br>A crazy person doesn't just go non-crazy. Stop being as delusional as the Misaki fags.</br></br></br>  So I watched this back in 2006.<br><br>I was in College. Did my homework and watched anime. I saved this onto two DVDs. I saved alot of other things to DVDs like Kenshin, Air, Code Geass, and many more.<br><br>Fast forward to 2010. I moved all my anime to big 2TB harddrives.<br><br>Fast forward to 2015. I moved all that anime to my personal file server.<br><br>It's the same Welcome to the NHK anime I downloaded from 2006.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>B-but dubs</br>  <br>Even if I could go back in time I feel like I would just repeat my shitty life.</br>  <br>NHK and Misaki threads are always gonna be feels and blogs shit.<br>Not that it bothers me and I actually quite enjoy them...</br></br>  <br>9 years ago - Last year of highschool, full of hopes and dreams going to college.<br><br>Present - Recently terminated, finding a job. Goddamn reality. My materialistic desire is what keeps me from giving up.</br></br></br>  Welp since I'm on the road to become a NEET might as well rewatch this  <br>I'm not sure if there's much I could change in all honesty. It's always easy enough to say "I'd study real hard and go to a good college, acquire a talent/skill etc etc" but anything short of that, no, I don't think so.<br><br>Also this thread has made me want to go back and rewatch the series. I remember the years ago I first watched it I used Oyasumi subs (which you can't even get on nyaa) that came with pic related in the torrent. What's /a/'s opinion on them? I tried Exiled Destiny and holy shit bright yellow subs in the middle of the screen are killing it for me.</br></br></br>  <br>I was 16 so I was miserable</br>  <br>Did someone say Oyasumi Subs?</br>   o-ohayo everyone   <br>Yes. I remember them pretty fondly for having liberal use of TL Notes, but it's been so long and I have a hard time believing that the best release is Exiled Destiny or Oyasumi</br>  i might do a rewatch thread tomorrow on /r9k/ if anyone is interested, the problem is i don't know which website should i use, last time i used tinychat, it was ok but not the best.  I scorned everything Japanese and hated weeaboos. Now I'm learning the language and following shows as they air.  got a job interview today,lets see if i can beat my NHK.<br>Been listening to the Ost all morning<br>I do alright i suppose i like how satou picked himself up at the end of the anime as everyone he knew got distant. saw the series around 2years ago around. the end of HS. <br>i've been so afraid of what the future would bring for me.it made me stagnant and depressed<br>i wanna change. <br>i know theres no immediate way to rid myself from this fear, ill still be down from time to time but it better then being who i was before.</br></br></br></br></br>   How was your life 9 years ago? <br>I had friends and people that I care about<br> how is your life now? <br>I'm my own master now.</br></br></br>  <br>which job are you applying to?<br><br><br> I'm my own master now. <br>it it worth it anon?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>a retail job <br>i figured it was a shot in the dark but they had me follow up for an interview.</br></br>  what happened to /a/? these threads didn't even hit the image limit  <br>will you be able to communicate with other people?</br>  <br> How was your life 9 years ago? <br>It was alright back then about to start high school.<br><br> How is your life now? <br>23 year old 4 year NEET approaching 5th<br><br>Now it's been difficult. I've been trying to change my life for the better these past 7 months.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was started by a shitposter, that's the only reason.</br>  <br>d-don't bully me ;_;</br>  <br>i'm fine with that part. i'm actually enjoy talking to people i just rarely get opportunities for honest communication with other people cause hikki.</br>  <br> Fire <br> 95 <br>W-What's 100?</br></br></br>  <br> How was your life 9 years ago? <br>Highschooler<br> How is your life now? <br>Dead-end job hikikomori<br>It's a pain, but I seem to be unable to think deeply about life and am satisfied as long as I don't die.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How was your life 9 years ago? <br>Jeez I was in fancy highschool barely applying myself. My life consisted of playing vidya and watching whatever was on toonami, or maguzi at that point I can't remember. Happy as a clam.<br><br> How is your life now? <br>25 and in graduate school, living on my own in another state from my family, and supporting myself. About two more years till I have the PhD. I'm miserable as fuck and lonely now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Living an unfulfilling life.</br>  <br>Fuck</br>  <br>The pain of carrying that weight.</br>  I hit Satous not too long ago and I have to say that things are going surprisingly well for me. While I was taking a neetyear out because I didn't get to do the course I wanted to do, I watched NHK and it really inspired me to better myself.<br><br>Waiting isn't going to do anything guys, even if there was a Misaki who wanted to save you she'd only be doing it for her own interests. You need to take that little baby step yourself!</br></br>  If you could go back 9 years and give yourself some advice, what would you say?<br><br> Study math you little faggot, you think you're cool by not giving a fuck about your education, but it's going to bite you in the ass. </br></br>  <br> Don't waste you're time in college.  <br><br> Find a job and start to save money for a reall doll. </br></br></br>  <br><br>9 Years ago<br>  socially awkward  <br>  no direction in life <br>  'going to make games' <br>  started first degree <br><br>Now<br>  Finished 3 degrees (2 bachelors &amp; masters) <br>  served in the Army as a Rifleman <br>  served in the Navy as an Officer <br>  mastery in 9 traditional Japanese martial art lineages <br>  competed at a national level in Judo <br>  gambled on the stock exchange and lost it all <br>  traveled and lived overseas (lived in Japan for a year) <br>  wrote 3 books - still trying to get published <br>  started my own company  <br>  tried to become a priest/monk (still might) <br>  been together with current gf for 5 years <br>  want to join the Feds/Police to become a detective/investigator <br><br><br>  mfw when I realise my life has no direction </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If you could go back 9 years and give yourself some advice, what would you say? <br><br>Stop being autistic and talk about your problems instead of making racist jokes like a dumbass.<br><br>Really, If I manned up back then instead of just laughing every thing off like a clown I would have lived a fulfilling life</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's that simple, however each year that passes by makes it harder and harder until you give up.<br><br> go back 9years. <br>Let's not pretend we are smart and study instead.</br></br></br></br>   (OP)<br> &gt;How was your life 9 years ago? <br>Just an average highschooler<br><br> &gt;How is your life now? <br> Hikikomori for 4 years now <br> 100k debt at the bank <br> Poor as fuck <br> Doing freelance jobs just to pay for food/rent/internet/meds <br> Can't do shit without ritalin <br> Avoided all my irl friends and eventually lost them all <br> Afraid to talk to new people even on the internet <br> Tried to kill myself once but couldn't finish it because I'm a coward </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If you could go back 9 years and give yourself some advice, what would you say? <br>You are not really smart person who just doesn't apply themselves. Every teenager thinks they're somehow smarter, more observant or otherwise just plain better than their peers. But they're not, and neither are you.</br></br>  <br>How was your year in Japan anon? Ever considered putting that japanese knowledge to good use by translating doujins and the like?You could probably become an english teacher over there and find your Misaki.</br>  <br> even if there was a Misaki who wanted to save you she'd only be doing it for her own interests <br>I'd be fine with that. Nobody does things just because</br></br>  <br>Take Japanese and not shitty frog</br>  <br> 9 years <br> 9 <br> Years <br> 3285 days <br>I've wasted my youth. I didn't learn one language, I don't have a topic that I can say I'm knowlagable, I didn't pick up one instrument, I didn't befriend anyone. I wasted my most precious years just watching anime and shitposting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Study math you little faggot, you think you're cool by not giving a fuck about your education, but it's going to bite you in the ass. <br>Yes this. I have to catch up now and work my ass off because I was a lazy little shit</br></br>  <br>How old are you?</br>  <br> 100k debt at the bank <br> still paying rent <br>Please tell me that's yen and not dororu</br></br></br>  <br>That would be around 30k usd in my 3rd world country's currency.</br>  <br>You could have learned some stupid language or acquire great knowledge about useless things and it will be the same. <br>The only important thing it's learning about shomething that gives you money.</br></br>  <br><br> 9 years ago <br>Easier, more fun<br><br> now <br>Waiting for a Misaki to come and save me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Was in college (studying art) living a hikki lifestyle in a room with no furniture when NHK aired.<br>Since then, got 2 steady jobs, a gf of 7 years (she's religious, lol), and studying programming at the moment as of now. Life has been good to me.</br></br>  <br>I have a job Anon. But the fact that I didn't improve myself as a human being in my most productive years just makes me really, extremely mad. Whenever I think about the past and see I didn't do one thing that I can say I'm proud of, something that I can just say "Yeah I'm really glad I started doing that." makes me just cry in despair.</br>  <br><br>Japan was fantastic, best year of my life. My Japanese is not that good and I never learned to read properly.<br><br>When I first arrived in Japan most of the girls I saw were attractive and had the personalities I was looking for (just like my chinese cartoons), but the more time I spent around Japs the more used I got to their faces and the better I could distinguish their features. Now Japanese girls don't look all that attractive to me anymore... unfortunately. <br><br>I did date a few girls but the relationships felt shallow, all I can say is it takes time to find the right one.<br><br><br><br>27</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 27 <br> did all that shit <br><br>Here I am, 22 years old and I have nothing and just starting university</br></br></br></br>  <br> I have a job Anon. <br>Then you're in better situation than most of us. <br>I have two degrees, i learned about lots of stupid shit and i feel absolutely useless. <br><br>The only thing that really motivates me to learn it's drawing and just because i have an stupid delusion about being a comic artist, but it will be the same shit as always. <br><br>So be proud of having a job, anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also, three degrees in what?</br>  <br>Same. I was constantly dropping out of schools and was a NEET in between nine years ago. I still pretend to start studying once or twice a year now, but I've held a part time job for two years and it's just enough work to keep me slightly busy and pay the bills, but not to make me crazy as 40 hour weeks did in the past. It's a customer service job and I can act like a decent human being there although the behavior doesn't carry outside the job. I still spend my free time with anime, video games, imageboards and chatrooms and I have zero real life friends and no permanent online friends, just like a decade ago.</br>  <br>Don't do homeschooling. I have mild regrets about not seeing some of those middle school cuties turn into highschool sluts. Also don't join the army, shoulda just kept my shitty part time job.</br>  <br>Some fat awkward nerd came to buy helium from my work a few days ago, I wonder if he was going to kill himself. <br>I think ours is laced with oxygen or something so it won't kill you though.</br></br>  9 years ago I was a freshmen in high school, adjusting to being the new kid and not knowing anybody. I was also  dealing with an abusive father and losing all the hope and motivation I once had  <br><br>Now I'm 22, still live with my dad, and am just the shell of a man</br></br>  <br>just go live with some anon and agree to be his boypussy or something dude, like that one guy who locked a /jp/sie under his bed</br>  I think back to it a lot, but not much helps - as much as I tried to take away the lessons of the anime, I'm missing the catalysts that Satou had.<br><br>Also, as middle school depressing as it may sound, this pic still rings very true It's a feeling that I've never been able to escape from.</br></br>  <br>Maybe NHK was your catalysts. In the end, you're the one who has to make the change. Nobody else can do it for you</br>  Still one of the best openings I've ever seen.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qcj<wbr>LT-EOrPA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>The problem is that I followed it - I got a job, I made a few friends, I have things to do to stop me from being a NEET.<br><br>But I'm not happy about any of it. It's all still empty.</br></br></br>    How do I stop dwelling of the past? All those "what if..." questions  <br>DON'T LET DREAMS BE DREAMS</br>  9 years ago I was single, unemployed and spent my days playing games and watching anime. Now I'm single, employed and spend the precious free time I have playing games and watching anime.  9 years ago I was just finishing high school and had a care free outlook on life. Now I'm in a dead end low paying job with no friends. Which is better than the neet I was for 3 years I guess.<br><br>I drink a lot.</br></br>  I just have one qestion.<br>Does a cute &amp; kind girl like Misaki even exist in real life?</br>   still no hittori bocchi instrumental track without the hispanic man singing, but the girls saying knock knock knock like in the show   <br>Sure they do.<br><br>They're all already taken, though.</br></br></br>  <br>if you figure it out im up for it</br>  <br>Read books on coding then. Any thing a university can teach is available online for free, and usually better.</br>  <br>I've seen people on other chans use cytu dot be which worked fine.</br>  Threadly reminder than Misaki is worse than Hitler  <br>Take chemistry instead of physics you little shit. 70% of my issues could have been done with there and then.</br>  <br>How.. How did they get the ratings for explosives and shotguns?</br>  <br>Here's your reply</br>  <br>Don't waste your high school years being a hikki.<br><br>Do that once you graduate instead.</br></br></br>  <br>  Book <br>About six times. It struck the perfect balance between beliavable, suffering, funny, tragic and weird.<br><br>  Manga <br>About three times. Was hetting way damn hardcore at times to really tragic ways almost without connetion to reality. Still great, though.<br><br>  Anime <br>Watched it three times. Balanced but not as believable or "realistic" as the original novel. More exgarated for the sake of fun and suffering. Still great, though. <br><br>I like the book the best.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   [CReep] Gakkou Gurashi! - 01 [1080p].mkv <br><br>Do you think Steppen King would like this anime</br></br>  I want to read a Steppen King book about cute girls doing cute things.<br><br> And then they die, because he can't write good endings unless it takes him 20 years. </br></br>  For sure  <br>Now that it's an anime maybe I'll finally remember everyone's names and not just Yuki and Megu.</br>  <br>That scene after Yuki and Miki leave the roof where the wind starts blowing is eery as fuck, for whatever reason.</br>  So what's next? Will we keep seeing the school through Yuki's eyes? The little bits from the preview didn't look "dark".  <br>The only good endings that Stephen King has written are Carrie and The Shining</br>  <br>Too bad The Shining had a sequel.</br>  <br>I liked how 11/22/63 ended, but he outright admits in the afterword that someone else told him how to end it.</br>  <br>You know it's bad when movies drastically improve the endings to his books (see: The Mist).</br>  <br>King is a huge pleb. So hopefully not, I want it to be good.</br>  <br><br>I was talking about "good" endings in the sense of them being "happy" endings. Most of his stories end with everyone or most of the characters dying.<br><br>Shit, Bag of Bones was ending nicely and then BAM!  they shoot the shit out of MC's waifu. </br></br></br></br>    Is this a Steppen King thread now?  Cujo a cute    yfw Rii channels Annie Wilkes and breaks Shovel's ankles when she eventually turns   <br> What if Taroumarou turns into Cujo? </br>  <br>   Cujo a cute <br>If you think he's cute, then you're going to love Toromaru!</br></br>  <br>Did they change things? That character isn't meant to be introduced yet.</br>  REMOVE CATHAT  <br>Yes, but they're not bad changes. The mangaka is on the anime staff as well so I wouldn't be worried<br><br>Honestly, the first episode of the anime is better than the first manga chapter, at least in terms of the reveal.</br></br></br>  <br>I think they're going to play around with Yuki's senses a bit more in this one ("why does the food smell bad????), which the others will need to explain in various ways.</br>  <br>The anime will be like half original half adaptation, get used to it.</br>  I JUST WATCHED THIS. WHY DIDNT YOU WARN ME /A/ FUCK YOU GUYS  <br> So what's next? <br>Just hopes and dreams now.</br></br>  <br> /A/ </br>  <br> WHY DIDNT YOU WARN ME <br>I congratulate you for being able to avoid any spoilers</br></br>  Mii-kun in the light, Yuki in the dark. This is the last time they spoke as friends.  <br>Kill your fucking self retard.</br>  <br>Urobutcher does it again!</br>  Taromaru a cutest. Hope there will be a plushie of him  <br>In this day and age, how did you manage to avoid all spoilers? Fucking attention whore.</br>  <br>The little bits in the preview showed no delusions.<br><br>Everything there was scenes from the manga except for the dog scenes, but the dog is still alive in the anime,</br></br></br>  <br>There'll be storyboard differences for sake of available time. Problem with anime is always they don't have limitless chapters, and don't want to end on Cool Beauty radio host  dying off-screen between chapters, fuck. <br><br>Maybe it'll go further than current manga volume even, but it's being handled great. Everything is diejoubu.</br></br></br>    I refuse to believe anyone who says they were tricked by this. Not knowing this series is a zombie apocalypse is the same as not knowing Shirou is the Redman or that Nagisa dies.  <br>The dog is a lie. So is Lerche and your expectations of this animu. Brace for it.</br>  When do you think youtube is going to start flooded with videos of faggots overreacting to this anime?  <br>Everyone knows it's a zombie series. But most people don't know about Yuki's crazy. They were probably expecting a zombie attack to happen a la High School of the Dead, not for it to be in the aftermath.</br>  <br>It's real; ate food and the other characters interact with it.<br><br>Odd decision, but I guess they're waiting to make the dog's death have impact. It didn't really matter aside from a short story in the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do ppl think Shovel is best girl? She reminds me of that gun otaku from HOTD.</br>  <br>3-4 hours from now, I'd say. I've already seen normals sperging.</br>  <br>The character who was best boy/the best character in the series?</br>  <br>Rii's in more danger than anyone at the moment. Kurumi has weird stuff going on with her so she's safe at least until that's all been explained, but Rii-san's losing it completely.</br>  <br>Because she's damn epic, don't you read the manga?</br>  <br>Because they have shit taste. Shovelfags love to avatar with her in these threads too. They are trash.</br>  <br>And that's bad because?</br>  I don't get it, are her friends going along with her delusion or is it part of her delusion too?  Can I just watch this for shovel noire?  It's gonna be 1 cour with anime original end and s2 never?  <br>The gun otaku from HOTD was the best character,  and his love interest the best girl   ;_; </br>  <br>Everyone is part of her delusion. Yuki is the only one alive.</br>  <br>She's hot, useful, cute, badass and carries a shovel around, How can you not like her?</br>  <br>It's because i read the manga that I think she's like that otaku. imo, Rii is better  before she went senile. </br>  <br>Shovel Rize</br>  <br>They're humouring her for the sake of her mental health.</br>  <br> badass <br> couldn't even kill Megu-nee </br></br>  <br>Lots of people pick anime blindly and ignore manga discussion altogether, anon. If you don't go into any pre-season discussion either but still download a bunch of first episodes you'll probably end up watching and falling for it.</br>  <br>Her friends are just pretending they can see what she sees. Miki is still trying to get used to it.<br><br>Notice how they bow to other students in the roof and Miki stares at Kurumi, wondering what the hell she's doing, before bowing too.</br></br></br>  Ending part was done pretty well. Miki reaction towards yuki was a nice touch. Is it really alright to include miki so early and Taroumaru extra scenes? Wonder if they will change the opening visuals next episode.  <br> HOTD. <br>I don't think this series will be as good as HOTD anon.</br></br>  <br> /A/ </br>  <br> only one that actively goes out to kill zombies <br> fit <br> twintails <br> cute <br> doesn't go crazy from finding her home in ruins <br> stays strong regardless of what happens <br> muscle of the group <br><br><br>They  go along with her delusions because otherwise she'll snap again and become a sobbing, screaming mess, and the fact that her delusions act as a pretty convenient way to get one's mind off the apocalypse help too. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's all a delusion. She's a zombie too.</br>  <br>More like they're humoring her for their own sake.<br><br><br>Don't get me wrong. I like shovel, just don't think she's best gril. Also explains why.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah they did. Not sure how it is going to work out. I suppose it won't be too much of a problem.</br>  <br>You're basically asking to explain shit that took a great deal of time to explain.<br><br>To put it really, really simply, her persistent good mood is the only thing keeping them all from snapping. Laughter is contagious.</br></br></br>  So how was the animation quality? Did Lerche fuck it  <br>Watch the episode</br>  <br>No QUALITY; it looks pretty good. It's what you'd expect from Mirlk.</br>  <br>Pretty good</br>  <br> stays strong regardless of what happens <br>For now. They are all going to slowly break. Right now is just Rii's arc.</br></br>  <br>Thats why I always assumed Yuki was pretending mostly in order to help her friends.</br>  <br> HOTD <br> good <br>Shit taste anon. Shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br>I noticed no animation issues, but to be fair there wasn't much to animate.<br><br>In terms of budget allocation, MonMusu &gt; GG &gt; Laplace</br></br></br>  <br>There are some scenes where it's just chibi heads saying what're they're doing and basically leaving the scene to your imagination but I'm not sure if it's supposed to be intentional or not.</br>  <br> Talks to Megu-nee and other students when she's completely alone <br> "Maybe she's just pretending" <br>There's a limit, anon.<br><br> She did start pretending a while ago, though. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>   otherwise she'll snap again and become a sobbing, screaming mess <br>Not really.<br><br><br>She's half pretending. This was the point of having Miki research psychology and learn that her delusions had to be mostly bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> only one that actively goes out to kill zombies <br> fit <br> twintails <br> cute <br> doesn't go crazy from finding her home in ruins <br> stays strong regardless of what happens <br> muscle of the group <br>   Is living dead </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> as good as HOTD <br>It's better. There's no retarded bus orgy cults and sanic-speed titties. Also, zombies are actually a thing to be reckoned with instead of a thing to mow down by the hundreds.</br></br>  Is this what we call le epic bait and switch?  <br>It's not budget allocation. Publishers/whoever pay the studio x amount to make something. They don't split that money between different shows.</br>  <br> &gt;only one that actively goes out to kill zombies <br>This is a bad thing, you realize.<br><br>There's not much point in killing zombies unless you can slaughter hundreds of them, and she can't. She just puts her life at risk when she goes zombie hunting.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She starts pretending sometime around when they find Miki I think since when her and Miki talk along she basically says she does it to keep her friends happy</br></br>  <br>Shovel seems pretty depressed whenever Yuki's off screen</br>  <br>Sorry, I'm really trying hard to break my habit of using "budget" as a catch all term in regards to animation production since Shirobako.</br>  Why hasn't her friends put her down yet? Surely a noisy little girl who wouldn't come to terms with reality would be a major safety hazard?  <br> She just puts her life at risk when she goes zombie hunting. <br>Not anymore  because zombies ignore her, now. She could pretty much kill a million zombies and none of them would pay attention to her. She became the group's final weapon. </br></br>  <br>Apparently she and Rii have a tendency to argue when Yuki isn't around.</br>  <br>Manpower is something that is split between shows though.</br>  <br> hair stays the same <br> shovel actually gets worse <br>That's bullshit</br></br></br>  <br>Left needs "gloss" removed from their eyes.<br>You know, to make them look  hollow .</br></br>  <br> She's half pretending <br>She  pretends to be happy all the time, but is aware that when she isn't looking, her friends always look distraught, so she pretends to get their mind off of whatever they're thinking . Her delusions are real (to her), obviously otherwise  she wouldn't have had a breakdown after murdering a zombie and seeing everything for what it actually is. </br></br>  <br>They ignore her if she doesn't do anything. They came after her when she banged a car during the helicopter mess and when she shouted during that stroll through the neighborhood.</br>  <br>But they hire more staff and drop them after the show. This is how this world works. Just look at Shaft if you want to see a good example.</br>    <br> empty <br>The only thing left inside most of them is the madness.</br></br>  <br><br> all these miikun and doge <br><br>They can adds as many shits they want but if they cut anything out instead I'm gonna get mad.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's the one who keeps them sane. And don't understimate her.</br>  <br> The zombies were after the car's noise and the rest of the group, not her. During the neighborhood scene, they were trying to attack Miki who just happened to appear right when Kurumi was yelling.   I am THIS delusional. </br>  Whose grave does this belongs to again?  <br>Did Nico Douga change their layout or something?</br>  <br>You mean Tomoko?</br>  <br>As you can see production delays are quite a frequent thing these days even with SHAFT. So I doubt it's always a case of higher more staff, even if it's temporary it still costs money and their budget might not be big enough to boot.</br>  <br>Outsourcing is very common to other studios though. Just look at A1 and Shaft.</br>  The official website has been update.<br><br>http://www.gakkougurashi.com/chara/<wbr>index.html</wbr></br></br>  <br> Megu-nee </br>  <br>You know they only perked up when she yelled. Miki came afterward.<br><br>It'll probably get worse (better?), but she can still be killed.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh not too shabby. Looks like they are okay with the minor changes.</br>  <br>They have the safety of their sectioned off part of the school building, so they can be as loud as they damn well want. Zombies can't reach them.<br><br> She gets better, so it's fine.  Rii-san loves bears though. </br></br></br>  <br> Really good 74,5% <br> Quite good 14,6% <br> Normal 5,3% <br> Quite bad 2% <br> Bad 3,5% </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's worse than expected fuck.<br><br>Then again it's just Nico and it means nothing.</br></br></br>  <br>We know what it means, spoonfeeder-kun.</br>  <br> You may think that's funny, but her fate is worse </br>  <br>Confirmed for low sales and no S2.</br>  <br>No but I'm saying they don't split budgets. As for staff they will keep senior staff but drop and pick up regular staff based on how much work they have. Lots of industries do it not just anime. <br><br>It's not Lerche's budget remember, it's whoever is paying them to do it. If Houbunsha (I think) pay them 2mil imaginary currency to make this, they don't spend 500k of that 2m on monmusu.</br></br></br>  <br> nico ratings = low sales <br>They weren't even that bad.</br></br>  <br> I know, but nothing says that tomb isn't meant to be symbolic. Besides, who knows what happens to her in the anime. </br>  <br>Wasn't it there even before they found her in the basement?</br>  <br>Holy Hell this website sucks. I wonder why it takes so long to load.<br><br>Could be just me, but my connection is pretty fast.</br></br></br>  <br>He's not wrong. It belongs to her.</br>  <br>They weren't bad but not really all that good. I'd say slightly above average.</br>  <br> ppl <br>Consider suicide.</br></br>    <br>Damn that's bad for nico standards</br>   Walking Dead with lolis <br> DayZ with lolis <br>You know what I think? I think it's  Gakkou Gurashi. <br><br> These comparisons are insulting. It's not really like much else. </br></br></br></br>  <br> Not keeping Mi-kun's eyes normal </br>  <br>I prefer calling it the Madoka of SoL.</br>  Dropped after the first 5 mins. I've seen enough cute girls in after school clubs thanks   Latest chapter <br> Survivor claimed territory and there bad guys chasing the group </br>  <br>That's also wrong since about the only thing it shares is a bait and switch.</br>  <br> Consider suicide. <br> Have been for a period now. Only thing that keeps me going is other means of escapism like animu.But sometimes it hurts so much, thought of slitting my wrist again. Sorry, /blog. </br></br>  <br>I don't have any "this is bait" images on me, but if I did, they'd be attached to this response.</br>  <br>Sup' bait-kun.</br>  <br>epic</br>  <br> after school club <br>Jokes on you, this is a before-school, during-school AND after-school club!</br></br>  <br>Too obvious, 0/10</br>  <br>RAPE THE GIRLS</br>  <br>I know this is bait, but I'd rather people drop it early than pick it up because "omg I thought it was cute SoL but actually it is dark and edgy so kewl!!!"</br>  <br>Just post smug anime girls, it's the same thing</br>  <br>I took the "grave" part literally, so apologies for that.<br><br>Well our statements still make sense anyway, so nevermind.</br></br></br>  Holy fuck that hit me like a truck, i had no idea this existed.  <br>Just kill yourself you fucking attention whore</br>  <br>Yeah I bet you didn't.</br>  Is this yuri? Zombies or not, shows will all cute girl cast should have yuri.  <br>Just get it over with faggot. No one will miss you.</br>  <br> <br>There is this post on the previous thread that says that the grave belongs to the kurumi senpai? Is that the senpai from chapter 2?</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  Does Shovel fuck her shovel?  <br>Nothing in the manga, who knows about the anime.</br>  <br>I am mentally sacred for these girls.</br>  the only knowledge i had going in was that it was a zombie show. still kinda surprised at the tweest since i expected a high school of the dead type thing and not a delusional character who think she is in a generic SOL anime  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I actually fucking hope that future threads don't end up being only this kind of shit. At some point secondaries watching for the first time and mangafags pretending to be secondaries will become indistinguishable and threads will be complete ass.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's Kurumi.<br>She stabbed by Rii when zombified using a knive.</br></br>   That track that plays when the delusions stop <br>Music box tracks always get me. I'm glad they're having Miki be there right from the start, she my favorite.</br>  <br> Nothing in the manga <br> All the blushing and laying on each others laps </br></br>  <br>As long as the girls stay cute  and broken , I don't mind.</br>  <br>Only some maybe one-sided yuri feelings from Miki toward Yuki. Very light, but I wouldn't call you delusional for noticing.<br><br>Nothing serious. This isn't a romance.<br><br><br>It doesn't, it's Megu-nee's. They all pray to it later, I don't think they'd be praying for Kurumi's senpai.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Imagine how they have to smell after weeks without a proper shower.</br>  <br>Nice.</br>  <br> There's no retarded bus orgy cults <br>How is that a better thing?<br>  and sanic-speed titties. <br>Assuming you meant sonic, that's anime only<br> Also, zombies are actually a thing to be reckoned with <br>GG zombies felt pretty lame so far (I'm talking of the manga), without even a decent strenght to break through barricades / form hordes to attack the girls.<br>At least HotD zombies had the decency to swarm people down and really go for the bite.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As much as I am a yuricon, I'd rather it not be pushed in this show. There's no need here.</br>  <br> At some point secondaries watching for the first time <br>Secondary is the worst, that's great.</br></br>  <br>They do have showers, though. Megu-nee said they had electricity and water thanks to their solar panels still working.<br><br> Somehow, we ended up surviving. We lived in the school. Thank goodness we had water and electricity. <br><br> Thank goodness the solar panels on the roof were alright. Thanks to that, we could even take baths. </br></br></br></br></br>  Preferred sub group for this?  <br>I always thought the lace on the cross was the lace from Megu-nee's dress.</br>  <br>Shovel should be all green and with whited out eyes, then it's perfect.</br>  <br>Vivid for dank memes.</br>   The show is about them getting rapped by Zombies and enjoying it.   <br><br><br>They shouldn't be compared, basic premise aside they're completely different series with completely different goals in mind.</br></br></br>  <br>Creep isn't bad</br>  <br><br> le vivid are meme spouters meme XD <br><br>Please stop little boy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Creep isn't a sub group.</br>  <br>YOu only say that because HOTD doesn't turn you on.</br>  <br><br>Put the recognized bulge onto the teddy bear and it will be perfect.</br></br>  <br>It's just a CR rip.</br>  <br>Fuck off herkz</br>   That fucking blackboard text   <br>Reminds me of JK to Orc Heidan, where everyone gets raped by orcs.</br>  <br>Eh? It does though.

Will we see more of weird shit?  <br> XD <br> le <br>Look at this commie dev.</br></br></br>  How long is this gonna be? Are we gonna get to the helicopter, because that would make for a great finale.  <br>Oh thanks.</br>  <br>It is said until graduation</br>  <br>Maybe there'll be no helicopter, but I think they'll get to the graduation. The "We are OK!" drawing/balloon is in the OP.</br>  <br>Why are people even into monster porn?</br>  <br>No. The reveal in the first episode/chapter is the last time they do a bait and switch on you, unless you count  if you don't know what happens, why are you trying to read spoilers? </br>  <br>It has a happy ending</br>  <br>It's not about the monsters, it's about how desperate and brutally raped the girls get.</br>  This is just going to be 13 episodes of despair and then it's not even going to finish the plot and leave off with a FUK U READ THE MANGA ending if you want more. I don't know if I should even bother.  <br>Helicopter crashed into their clubroom instead, and then OP start to play will be a great ending.</br>  Speaking of the helicopter bit<br><br> Didn't the dude from the helicopter come from either the college or the corporation? If he was infected, does that mean they'll find anything -aside from more despair- when they finally get to their destination? <br><br><br>9/10</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The OP is almost entirely made of lies, so I don't know about that balloon. I mean, yes, they'll probably do it but I wonder about when.<br><br>In the manga, it was released before Miki came around, and it only featured living characters. The OP has Megu in it for some reason.</br></br></br>   Walking dead with lolis or DayZ with lolis <br>Or what else?

That's about it.</br>  <br>Wasn't LOST just a lot of crazy bullshit that actually happened, no dreams or illusions, just suffering the problems that come with smoke monsters?</br>  I forgot that this was a monologue at the start of the series too.  <br>No point posting this</br>  <br>There is a really good reason for that. Just keep watching it.</br>  This is the first time an anime took me by surprise, loved it.  <br>Read the manga. You get to see Miki's butt.</br>  <br> They all died from the crash. They were in Purgatory the whole time. </br>  <br> Favorite book? </br>  <br>So lewd.</br>  <br>I heard that was entirely not what happened.</br>  I was a bit confused but since when did Yuki pretend not to see the issue at hand?  <br> those words are all her repressed thoughts <br>Sasuga Lerche</br></br>  <br>Well, she was one.</br>  <br> actually happened <br>The whole last season was a "jokes on you it was all just their afterlife tehee~" in regards to the whole retarded alternative timeline bullshit they started in the season beforehand. Although the rest was real.<br><br><br>I wish, at least that would have been less infuriating than what happened.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> garter over pantsu </br>  <br> The whole last season was a "jokes on you it was all just their afterlife tehee~" in regards to the whole retarded alternative timeline bullshit they started in the season beforehand. <br>If that's so, I get why folks were pissed.</br></br>  <br> when did Yuki pretend not to see the issue at hand? <br>She was insane until Miki said she was full of bullshit.</br></br>  <br>When did she meet reality? Like 5 chapters ago maybe? She had a breakdwon at school or something.</br>  <br> until Miki said she was full of bullshit. <br>I'd say she was insane until  happened, then she snapped out.</br></br>  <br>Here.</br>  <br><br>Like I mean since when was she ignoring the reality that everyone was dead? Was it from the start or just since she went back to get her bag?</br></br>  <br>I don't think it was ever stated, not yet.</br>  <br> not noticing the best pottery in the entire series </br>  I wonder if we're gonna get flashback episodes about the time without Miki.  <br>She was KIND OF insane.<br><br>Read the manga closely, and you'll notice a lot of the time she demonstrates a strong amount of awareness as to the groups needs and when they could use some cheering up.<br><br>It actually makes a lot of sense that  after graduation, she "becomes" incredibly reliable. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If it was from the very start that this introduces a new level of mind fuckary.</br>  <br>I really hope so.</br>  <br>It was. It's Megu-nee's fault. You get bits and pieces out of order, but the story is.<br><br> Outbreak, Yuki is sane (you see her helping defend against zombies in Kurumi's senpai-murder flashback) <br> things settle down, Yuki is depressed and cries all the time <br> School life club proposed, Megu wants Yuki to be happy  <br> Delusion <br><br>This page confirms it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It actually makes a lot of sense that   after graduation, she "becomes" incredibly reliable. <br>Again, because she snapped the fuck out of it after being forced to see things for what they really are  (by having to kill a zombie that somehow survived the fire). <br><br><br>She's been mad since chapter 1, but snap ped out of it recently. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking bitch.</br>  Huh, well I decided to go in avoiding spoilers and this was a pretty nice surprise. I saw that it was a "healing" anime and thought it would be about a murder/cannibalism club with cute girls<br><br> showel <br> meat sauce <br> stephen king <br> get zombies instead <br><br>I am pleasantly surprised</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe. Because Yuki started wrapping herself in delusions, the rest of the group stayed cheerful despite the circumstances.<br><br>But then, once that delusion breaks  Rii can't take it anymore. </br></br></br>  Who has it the worse, you think? I'm thinking Kurumi  <br>So she's been imagining that everyone in her school is still alive from the very begining huh</br>  <br>To be fair, I'm sure making her a delusional person was not the plan. I still think that Megu-nee's death was what pushed her.</br>  <br> cute sociopaths doing cute sociopathic things <br>I wonder if a manga like that already exists.</br></br>  <br>Posted in an earlier thread<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/112999<wbr>146/#113004805</wbr></br></br>  I want to rape Yuki while she still acts all cheerful and happy through the tears.  <br>Right now?  Rii-san .  She fucking ran into an elementary school building full of zombies in the middle of the night unarmed to look for her imouto.  Crazy bitch.</br>  Just got back from work, didn't have time to watch the episode yet.<br><br>So how badly did Lerche fuck up, guys?<br>Was it as bad as expected or is the first episode actually good?</br></br></br>  <br>Rii-san. She seems like someone who takes responsibility, and the realization she basically forgot about her little sister is driving her crazy.</br>  <br>Wasn't Abnormal-kei Joshi about that?</br>  <br>Why don't you watch it and find out?</br>  <br>Breddy grood. Expect 1080p upscales forever.</br>  <br>Big boob useless like always, that's why I prefer &lt;=C</br>  <br>At least she found her!<br><br>Right, guys?<br>Right?</br></br></br></br>  <br> watch anime that essentially amounts to an advertisement to the manga <br> expect it not to try and advertise the manga </br></br>  <br> https://archive.moe/a/thread/127826<wbr>609/#127827180</wbr> </br>  The wind noises froze my soul.  Another sample from the upcoming anthology.  <br>Rii-san, it's time to stop posting.</br>  <br>Yeah, just look how happy her friends are to see she found her cute little bear-themed imouto. Her little sister must really like bears or something.</br>  <br> Again, because she snapped the fuck out of it after being forced to see things for what they really are  <br>All I'm saying is that her delusion wasn't entirely a delusion. The whole point of Miki confronting her on it was to inform the reader that the full extent of Miki's alleged delusions were impossible. If they were completely legit, she wouldn't have<br> rallied Rii when the helicopter crashed and sent out a message to Kurumi and Miki <br> prepared to go out in full battle gear to face zombies <br> killed that zombie in the classroom <br>A proper delusion would have held through even seeing a zombie right in front of her.<br><br>There's actually a lot of examples. I think the real reason she broke down is since life was still peaceful despite everything, and with a zombie intruding directly on that peace and the school in shambles, she realized that she and her friends wouldn't be as happy as they'd been ever again.<br><br>It's pretty obvious when you see this page. The problem isn't that her delusion broke, it's that her legitimate, real safe place was destroyed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Megu-nee herself comments about how unnatural cheery she has become in her diary though, so she was probably already on the way to lala land whole she was still alive. Tulpa Megu-nee on the other hand is likely a direct result from her death and Yuki's subconscious coming up with a way to protect her from the most obvious danger.</br>  <br>Probably Miki. She's the only one who isn't fucked up so she has to try the hardest to stay not fucked up for them.</br>   yfw Rii wins the imouto bowl   <br><br>I can't wait for the reveal on that one</br></br>  <br> Megu-nee herself comments about how unnatural cheery she has become in her diary though <br>I just read that now. I guess you're right.</br></br>  <br>The yandere harem one?</br>  <br>I dunno anon, the fact that when she was alone, talking to a zombie as if it were still a normal human being up to the point it almost grabs her indicates that she wasn't pretending to be retarded. With the narration from chapter one being stated again in that chapter as she's freaking the fuck out while running through the school, it wouldn't be too hard to believe that Yuki, for the first time in however long she lost her mind is seeing things as they actually are. She knows danger when her friends seem troubled/are in trouble, and probably unconsciously knows what's actually going on in her surroundings, but consciously, she did believe things were daijoubu, to an extent.</br>  <br>Will I finally get my dose of retarded comedy in a zombie setting?</br>  <br>That's literally every manga/LN adaptation ever.</br>  <br>Well, this is why I say "not entirely", not "not at all".</br>  <br> Confirmed for low sales and no S2. <br><br>I feel this show is better with just 1 cour<br><br>Unless they do an OVA about the events that led up to the series</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck how did i miss this. based lerche</br>  <br>Bingo, pretty much what happened to me just now.<br><br>I was not prepared for this.</br></br></br>  <br> Please don't throw me away </br>  <br>i dont know if i want to keep watching this. <br>Shit's tense</br></br>  Hey guys, what do you think of my little sister?<br><br>Isn't she cute?</br></br>  <br> Yuki's eye <br>Damn, she almost looks like a cyclope</br></br>  <br>Unbearably cute</br>  <br>She's  beary  cute.</br>  <br> beary <br>P5's going to be full of cat puns, isn't it?</br></br>   They won't make it to this part <br><br>S2 when?</br></br>  <br>Oh imouto, what big teeth you have</br>  what a faggot  <br>Thank you, now I will never unsee it.</br>  I love the little shit they hide during the delusion part.

No matter what, I can only see this ending with a huge "GO READ THE MANGA" message.</br></br></br>    <br> ghost <br>I'm sorry, what?</br></br>  <br>Nothing, really.<br><br>Indexfags are just mad it's going to take literally 10 years for YP to catch up with the novels.</br></br></br>    <br>It is, but 720p is a downscale from said upscale so you will download shit anyway. Not that the stream quality itself wasn't already shit anyway, so just download whatever filesize is more to your liking.</br>  <br>Was it written in English by Lerche, or the subbers?</br>     mfw the influx of PSTD little girls that mistaken this anime for cute SOL   <br>There was a certain scene in Sora no Woto where you can see a ghost in a window near the characters.<br><br>Someone here should have the .gif.</br></br></br>  I read the manga and is good and all, but i dont think i'm going to keep watching this, it just hits too close to home, and i dont want to need to be healed every week this shit airs  <br>that's a girl</br>  <br> The helicopter finds and rescues them and everyone lives happily ever after. </br>    <br>Lerche.<br><br>Notice the Engrish on the white text.</br></br></br>  <br> it just hits too close to home <br>Did you survive a zombie apocalypse that I somehow completely missed out on?</br></br>  <br>I managed by not going on /a/ around the time new seasons start</br>  <br> it just hits too close to home <br>I know, as the little girl I am I'm really scared.</br></br>  I hope they intensify the yuri in the anime. Also someone remind me  does Kurumi have to keep getting injected with the medicine to not zombify or was the one dose enough to stop her?   <br>Only one mistake, in that last white sentence. Not bad overall.</br>  <br> You where there when it happened and now you're deluding yourself, thinking you're posting on /a/ like always. It's time to wake up, anon. <br><br> Please wake up. </br></br></br>  <br>   implying </br>  <br>I don't need that hollywood-tier ending.<br><br>I'd rather just see them taking Megu-nee's car.</br></br></br>  <br>   Please wake up. <br>Now I know I must be dreaming! No one would care if I never woke up!</br></br>  <br>Pretty good adaptation, though I'm still not 100% on the art. I get the feeling they're going to drop the  finding mii-kun  arc, but maybe not.<br><br>Going to be interesting how they integrate the flashbacks into everything, in any case.</br></br></br>  They did a pretty good job, I hope they can keep it up for another 11 episodes.  <br>"All is in the darkness in the past" also sounds kinda awkward.</br>    <br> One dose . But it's been awhile since I read, so I might be wrong.</br>  <br>no, the act of pretending that everything is okay when things around you are kinda fucked up</br>  <br>I was expecting a normal first episode and things go to shit over night. Really like how they did it.</br>  Post &gt;yfw they change the OP next week.<br><br> By Kalafina </br></br>  <br>Well animated with voices should up the atmosphere as is. They certainly did wonders for the reveal scene with the music and everything.<br><br>As to the latter, I'm not sure if it was ever stated but  considering helicopter pilot spasmed and broke his dose before crashing, she probably isn't diajoubu. </br></br></br>  Yuki= Chino+Cocoa<br>Shovel= Rize<br>Yuuri= Chiya<br>Miki= Syaro+Chino</br></br></br>  <br>Sounds expensive.</br>  <br>We've never seen her take a second dose, at any rate.</br>  <br>But I want  Maximum the Hormone </br>  <br>Pls don't bully Mii-kun, the dog is already cold enough to her.</br>  <br>Personally, I'm hoping they keep the same song but have completely different visuals.</br>  Which group will be doing this?  <br>Same music, same imaginary cardboard cutout students, but background is not shiny bright. Everything is not genki dess.</br>  When are they going to kill Megu-nee?  <br>Memelords.</br>  <br><br>They don't even have the rights to hire them anyway.</br></br>  <br>Zombie apocalypses that happen right at the start are old hat, anyway.<br><br><br>Keep the song, but slowly swap the visuals to what is actually happening.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Please don't tell me monster dick turns you on.</br>  <br>your sister is lacking a moustache</br>  <br>When was the last time you left your house Anon?</br>  <br> They already did. <br><br>I anticipate a lot of flashbacks. Probably one or two entire episodes of nothing but flashbacks, if they show how Miki got to the school.</br></br></br>  Here's your new thread.<br><br>By the way, vol.11 chapter 1 is finished for those of us here who want to discuss the plot.</br></br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.<br><br>  Should've linked it, OP.<br><br><br/></br></br> </br></br>  https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-1/#p<wbr>art-3</wbr></wbr>  <br>Sure.<br>https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-1/</wbr></br></br>  I think Yukino might like 8man, can someone reassure me of this?  <br>too soon, anon.</br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!   Yui's face when she wins the 8bowl   <br>How can one girl be so cute?</br>  Does Yukino realize she is in love or she still at the stage where she feels love and doesn't know how to describe it? <br><br>Also, not trolling here, has Iroha ever been shown to care about 8man?</br></br>  <br> Also, not trolling here, has Iroha ever been shown to care about 8man? <br>Vol 10.5 chapter 3, when she convinces him to take a photo with Yukino and Yui in order to create good memories</br></br>  <br>No one in the service club has experienced genuine love before. They're all at a loss for what's going on and how to proceed.<br><br>Yukino has a request though, so maybe that'll be their answer.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder what would her request entail...</br>  <br>I can clearly see 8man will take a step forward while having a monologue that his move might be a mistake and throwing everything in. And Yui will reject 8man's confession. Because, there is a reason why she never attempt to after the fireworks festival.  And that's where Yukino will step in. </br>  I haven't watched S2 yet, but did 8man and Yukino ever finish their "competition" that Sensei set up for them at the start of the series?  <br>It finishes at the end of the school year.</br>  <br>In S1? So it ended already? I just must have missed it then.</br>    <br>School year hasn't finished yet</br>  Are these generals the second coming of them katwa shoujo ones?<br>Will these go on btb even after vol 12 is released  by Yen Press? </br>  <br>Are these actual spoilers or is an anons opinion?</br>  Does anyone have a link to all the pdfs? I remember someone posted a MEGA link but it's gone now.... :(  Why does Hikki always stare at Yui's yuis?<br>That's so gross</br>  So, let me get this: double YY are willing to go for a threesome relationship with 8man while he just want 1 girl because "muh genuine"? He's not only a huge fag at this point, but also a huge jerk.  <br>And you're an idiot</br>  <br>because they are proper Yuis, unlike Yukinoshita's.</br>  <br>Shut up, Yui. Everybody knows it rouses you to orgasm level being watched by him while also shit talking him down.</br>  <br>He's a heterosexual teenage boy.</br>  Who won the 8inchbowl?  <br>What the hell were you watching all this time?</br>    Yukino's Yukinos are justice  <br>Bet my ass she totally gets off on that when she's home alone at night.</br>  what did /a/ think of this?    <br>Mediocre with LOT of waste potential.<br><br>Emi best girl.</br></br></br>      <br>So imagedump-kun, you seem to have a good memory, do you remember how much Kaori hit MC?</br>  Prove me wrong. <br><br>Jesus christ .. look at that ass to breast ratio.</br></br>  <br>you really need to codify if with a superior girl, Houki ruins it with her RAGEdere aftertaste</br>  chance for season 2?  <br>I keep reading there's not enough source material and it didn't sell amazing <br><br>settle for perpetual OVAs for the years to come</br></br></br>  <br>Skipping any "DFC vs cowtits" discussion, the art style and anatomy used for those spreads is terrible bony bullshit.<br>At least KyoAni has a good grasp of proportion and anatomy, making everybody (small-chested included, see Shiina) look good.</br></br>  <br>You get no arguments from me here. A very close second would be Hestia. The only reason I have Sento over Hestia is becasue Sento is just slightly better propitiated.  and she's drawn by KyoAni. </br>  Post Type Moon, if you're not a nerd.  <br>The Kayneth entry only proposes the possibility of him winning the war by exploiting Berserker and fulfilling certain conditions with Lancer as well. It means that, perhaps, in another timeline, the both of them defeat Gil, which is obviously not a fucking feat if he goes full retard at some point like he does with Shirou.<br><br>More relevantly, Gil is clearly above Lancelot, but 32 NPs probably aren't going to overwhelm him.</br></br></br>  <br>I would agree that Lancelot is skilled enough to have a chance yeah.</br>  <br>I'm not the same person. That post was just senseless.</br>  <br> Gil wouldn't need to use Ea on Lancelot. A sufficient number of NP's so that Lancelot couldn't block or grab anymore would be enough. <br>Literally stated it wouldn't work on Prisma Illya and Kayneth entry confirms he can beat Gil.</br></br>  <br>I'll believe it when I see it.</br>  Are you faggots ready for Papi's delicious butt?<br><br>Manga:<br>-Chapter 35 coming this month, probably close to 19th with the start of Mero arc.<br>-Murderfish with problems, Darling must act.<br>-Live translation? or just a final edition coming?<br><br>Hitomi sensei:<br>-New chapter when?<br><br><br>Also:<br> Shitposters and secondaries GTFO <br> Report and ignore </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So does she have different size tits? Are they both hers? Or someone else's?</br>  <br>Don't get me wrong, I love me some abs, too. But those tits are always nice.<br>Also as a person with a weakness for tall girls, the fact that an anon did the pixels-to-centimeters converter and found out that Cathyl is 8'6" including her horns pleases me greatly.</br></br>  <br>The Ending is far superior. Smith and Zombina's voice are sex<br><br>http://<span>youtu.be/amXiceqtTto  [ ]</br></br></br>   yes to Centorea-loyal, huge rack, devoted to you, horse pussy <br> yes to Papi - ass for days, easy to get along with, free eggs, not much for a talking, kinda dumb and forgetful <br> yes to Mero- a princess, moey and stuff, very gentle, I hope you like water in your life <br> yes to Rachne- DTF 24/7, free clothing, she'll be in charge, she won't do shit around the house, no faith in anyone, not even in you <br> yess to Miia- cute, loves to cuddle, will jump your bones for hours, probably break a couple, can take you to her village where you will drown in a dorito sea <br> yes to Suu- is like living with a trash compactor, floor cleaning, water purifier that can go from loli to Milf at will, not much of an eventful life here, more water in your life than with Mero <br> yes to Lala- Never die, can get fellatio under the table, detachable head for countless uses, probably will take part in her Chunii fantasies. <br>This is hard, but Miaa has the village thing, but then again Mero could have her servants fuck you and cuck herself or something. So Im divided between fish and snake pussy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Too bad she's an UNFAITHFUL WHORE</br></br>  Tiona or Tione?<br>There can only be one</br>  <br>is it good or fanservice trash?</br>  <br>Boku no pico.</br>  <br>Can't even reverse image search...</br>  <br>Was Aots</br>  <br>How soon?</br>  New chapter out, based rapeman just delivered  <br><br>He wants to be the maou, maou's gotta have a dungeon, duh.</br></br>  This dude had sex with 17 named characters so far in the novels.<br><br>Nice to see his groin getting much exercice and all that but the story lacks tension, no worthy conflict whatsoever so far.</br></br>  <br>He wants that, he believes humanity is rotten to the core, the Dungeon is to exploit people's greed while he empowers himself, adventurers and the like will keep invading his territory, they will either die or become his servants.<br><br>It's a pragmatic revenge, till he plans something greater.</br></br></br>  <br>If i remember well the only time shit really got serious was against pic related</br>  <br> "bows? Don't feel like it." <br> "You get ten barrels of beer" <br> "Deal" </br></br></br></blockquote>]
