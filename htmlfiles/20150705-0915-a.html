This hunger.  <br>Magic.</br>  <br> no panties, ever <br> not even the shadow panties from the first short <br><br>I'm confused. They made KLK, right? Why would they do this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>/co/ fucktards fuck off please.</br>  <br>if it wasn't summer i might believe you</br>  <br>I feel like losing your hat has to be the mark of a rank amateur, or someone who's kind of dumb, assuming they don't have the power or talent to cast "stick hat to head". You just wear a hat with ties on it, like a sunhat, or some cowboy hats. Maybe you lean on that if the Hat is compulsory Witch fashion and nonoptional until you know real magic and can make it stick when you have to do maneuvers that are ungraceful/not right side up.<br><br>Unwillingly displaying immodesty would be the same way. If you want to flash your panties, sure. If you are too incompetent to have magic that deals with that constantly or actively obscures your skirt dress, again, you clearly suck/have poor judgement in not wearing something sensible if you can't actually do that yet.</br></br></br>  <br> show made by japanese people in japan <br> surprised it's in japanese <br>They probably are speaking english, they're just shown speaking Japanese.<br><br>If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518?</br></br></br></br></br>  I approve of what my $300 helped bring together.  <br>Draw your own.</br>  <br>I know right.<br>PROTECT ME MARIA</br></br>  <br>She's Japanese.<br><br>Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this your first anime or something?</br>  So how are the subs for this?<br>Decent?</br>  <br><br><br>What are you talking about no retards here, that post doesn't even exist.</br></br></br>  <br>You wait for the Kickstarter for LWA3 which will be backed in a paltry 3 hours, along with all stretch goals and then some.</br>    <br>That's exactly what it feel like.</br>  <br>Spooky</br>  So the animation quality definitely isn't as high as the original, but what are your thoughts on it as a whole?<br><br>Even if it isn't up to the same standard I still think it's pretty solid</br></br>  <br>Is that what that was? I've never been to England, but I'm pretty sure britbongs don't screech like that.</br>  <br>who is this panda demon</br>  <br>There's a scene with Akko's panstu, they're dark blue.</br>  <br> If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518? <br><br><br> It is I, the animation guru who knows everything about animation </br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's any consolation, I'll make an edit of any future English dub so that Akko and only Akko still speaks moon.</br>  <br> Hand drawn Blingee <br><br>I like it.</br></br></br>  <br>600k is a pretty small amount<br><br>Consider that in the past, even for large animation studios like Disney they spent an average of 150k-300k per short for 8 minutes. That's without adjusting for inflation, either.</br></br></br>  <br> Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other Japanese girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas in Japan. </br>  <br>Animation quality not being as high was foreseeable, what with it being longer and all, and you could clearly see the segments the budget went to. A fluid and pretty animation even throughout the minor segments would have been too much for me too handle.<br><br>I liked it about as much as the first one, which is to say a lot.</br></br></br>   the boy tightly grabbing diana's ass the whole time <br><br>Fucking prick.</br></br>  <br>It is as cute and amusing as the original but yeah, animation quality is lower. I would attribute that to Trigger not having as much time as they do and should had spent now compared to when they were just starting up 2-3 years ago. Back then, weren't they only working on Inferno Cop and just planning out KLK?</br>  Did they release a copy without the English subtitles?  <br>Just like Dawn's are black, right?<br><br>But seriously, that tiny frame is like the only shadow panties in the whole thing? It's like a complete 180 from the first ep.</br></br></br>  So, when are BDs supposed to come out?  <br>I'll like it more if it had hand-drawn Snoop.</br>  Seriously. What the fuck is wrong with some of you. Trigger specifically asked you not to distribute this. Give them respect and don't be a douchenozzle who torrents this immediately. You're a selfish prick and I hope you all fall into a blender and get chopped up into a million pieces.  <br>Aug?</br>  <br>Up until the scene where the parade begins, it wasn't all that stunning. It was still enjoyable and fun but didn't really capture the feeling of LWA1.<br><br>As soon as the parade began, it was magical. I was somewhat afraid of what Trigger might end up producing but it met my expectations and then some. The new characters were very fun too. Maybe my expectations weren't as high as others after watching some of their more recent series.<br><br>Anyways, Amanda best girl from the new lot.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Someone get this hot-head out of here!<br><br> I agree with you </br></br></br>  <br>I realize that it's not going to look like a Disney movie without a huge budget. Google led me a cost of about 150k per episode of anime on average, this was from 2011, so with a bit under twice the budget they'd need for something twice a long as a regular episode I figured they could have made it look better.</br>  <br> Not downloading now and buying the BD and all surrounding merch later. </br>  <br>Nigga I backed this and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa.</br>  <br>why you yelling at me for , I gave them money and watched it at vimeo</br>  <br>cry more</br>      <br>That $600k+ also went into merchandise and other stuff.</br>  <br> and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa. <br>why arn't you getting a BD anyway?</br></br>  I want to beat the living shit out of those normie brats who were pelting our witches with disgusting commoner fruit.

Everyone else just gets a special thanks on their website, I think.</br>  <br/>  <br>yeah someone here said 300+</br>  <br>Yeah, it was like $300 or more.</br>  <br>Poorfags BTFO.</br>  <br>She was alright. She did a lot more by not talking and being aloof, in my opinion, it shows her character, but I agree with  in that Food girl needed something other than food.</br>  <br>Can this be a gif? Or even a Youtube?</br>  <br>Yeah that's true. Neither of them had a whole dance routine of time devoted to expound on their background.</br>  <br> implying a 30-something NEET lowlife living with his parents would donate enough to have their name put on the end credits </br>   diana cheering akko on <br>cute</br>  Do we know how much money was on TRIGGER's end?  So what do we need to do to get a full series? I was wary at first of getting LWB without the animation quality, fearing the animation is what gave it its charm, but now I have confidence in Trigger to give LWB proper presentation with a more limited budget, since the characters and universe are well-thought out and charming enough.  <br>I have you know I'm a professional engineering living with my parents.</br>  <br> somefaggotsstupidname (Sup /a/?) </br>  <br>Do we know if they are going to make more money from this movie too?</br>  <br> I'm a professional engineering <br>Sure you are.</br></br>  So Good Smile Company is plastered on the front and end of LWA2. Does this mean that they'll finally get around to making figures?  <br>Please be nice to Collin. He put over $300 into the kickstarter you know.</br>   Sorry, comments have been disabled by the owner of this video.   Did Takafumi Hori save Trigger's animation once again?   AOTY   <br>Anyone?</br>  <br>Probably. But that's kind of risky, the figure market in the west is nowhere near as huge as in Japan. Is LWA even popular in Japan? It looked like Trigger was making it mostly for the west (in the credits you don't see many Japanese names).</br>  <br>There were no panties in the first ep. Just impossible skirts.</br>  I like Amanda enough that I wish she'd been in the first OVA  <br>I dont think many japanese know what kickstarter is though do they?</br>  <br>Skirts like that exist, you know.</br>  <br>Well, Kickstarter is mainly a western thing so that makes sense.</br>   /a/ backs LWA2 <br> Trigger delivers a great movie <br><br> leddit and Tumblr back Under the Dog <br> CIA in shambles, production drama and setbacks <br>Feels great.<br><br><br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>They liked the animation but wasn't all over it like the West.<br> in the credits you don't see many Japanese names <br>I don't think they're familiar with KS.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I really don't understand why there isn't more like this. CGDGT slice-of-life as everyone seems to enjoy, just in a slightly more novel setting with a fantastic or sci-fi element to jazz things up a bit.  <br>That might just be Elevens not being into Kickstarter. Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously).</br>  <br>There was lots of Japanese names, just in romaji</br>  <br>That's just cause not many japs paid 300 dollars to be there.</br>  <br>jokes on them , I can fap to thighs alone.</br>  <br> Under the Dog <br><br>Was that one with Kojima?</br></br></br>  <br>Man, that Akko bitch ended up trashing Lotte's pillow.</br>  Is this the tripfags general?  <br>What a slut</br>  <br> Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. <br>[citation needed]</br></br>  <br>B-but muh slightly different school clubs are so much more fresh!</br>  <br> Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously) <br>I was in  the Yaraon threads  and they were more surprised/amused by that than anything. Only a handful of trolls were saying anything like that, and it was pretty clear they hadn't watched the OVA.<br> so this is a ripoff of Madoka funded by Amerika-jin, right??? </br></br></br>  It's official. LWA 2 &gt; LWA  <br>And hey, at the end of the day, if UTD comes out and is good, we can still enjoy it, if not, we can snark on it. It's win-win.</br>  <br>Literally the next sentence it is pointed out that that statement could be false.</br>  <br> CGDGT  <br>That's one long-ass acronym.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>   Fat-chan literally did nothing but eat, give food, and generally be fat <br>Impressive. She was still adorable though.</br>  I need a webm of Akko's transformation scene  <br> &gt;Fat-chan literally did nothing <br>she acted as the weight for the catapult.</br></br>  <br>I await the butthurt tumblr will have about fat shaming despite the character being fun, funny and cute.</br>  where is the high definition torrent? the vimo stream is choppy and atrocious. (my toaster doesn't do well with streaming)  <br>sankyuu</br>  <br>Looks like it was 20$+ to have your name on the website. I'm in the poorest of the poorfags.</br>  <br>I had<br> and generally be fat <br>for that one. The catapult was hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe not in that scene you posted. And I said shadow panties, not actual panties.</br>  <br>LWA3 when?</br>  <br>I don't think we'll get better than the 720p stream until backers get their actual BDs.</br>  <br>Yeah, she was the weak link of the secondary power trio.<br><br>I'd actually like to see a third OVA of the secondaries, but with Diana instead of her.</br></br></br>  Where the fuck is the 720p on Nyaa?  <br><br><br>WHAT THE FUCK<br><br>IT WAS JUST DOLPHIN PORN YOU FUCK</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yaraon threads <br>whats that?</br></br>  <br>She seemed to make herself larger there too. I wonder if that was just a visual gag or if she's one of those calorie-consuming magic types like Chouji in Naruto or that Zero Squad lady in Bleach.</br>  <br>Japanese Gaia, more or less.</br>  <br> DOLPHIN PORN <br>thats good too</br></br>  <br>720 is high definition you idiot, and that's what i was asking about.</br>  <br>Picked up.</br>  Was there no Kickstarter update?  <br>It's  2 years lurking before posting, faggot </br>  <br>so filled with 13 year old kids?</br>  <br>nvm, found the Trigger email</br>  <br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>I remember that trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend</br></br>  <br>I fucking wish I could make that joke.</br>  <br>Christ, someone's mad they can't get their pirated anime as fast as they want.</br>  <br>They did mention the emails going out around the AX screening in one of the previous KS updates but no, no update when the emails did go out.</br>  <br>Scene-wise, I think the first one was more memorable and better animated but overall, I think the second had the better story and characters.</br>  <br>If I never got into Ragnarok I would never know this feeling.</br>  <br>Trigger got probably more fan outside of japan than inside.</br>  <br>Some of the posters are clearly what we would call underage, yes. You'd fit right in.</br>  <br><br> trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend <br>s-seriously?</br></br></br>  <br><br>i am a backer, my computer is just a toaster and can't stream.</br></br>  <br> magnet:?xt=urn:btih:00820fc737e6cdd<wbr>fa2ea27fe37cd48928df06f30&amp;dn=388264<wbr>041.mp4&amp;tr=http%3a%2f%2fopen.nyaato<wbr>rrents.info%3a6544%2fannounce</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br>Does this work for you?</br></br></br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2013-08-12/little-witch-academia-<wbr>tokyo-event-cancelled-due-to-low-ti<wbr>cket-sales</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Not the only one, my friend.</br>  <br> first KS <br> was a student working at a deli <br> back $100 <br><br>If they open a KS for LWA3, I'm tossing a lot more in it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Because they didn't advertise it well enough. Most nips didn't even hear about the event until it was over.</br></br></br>  <br>it appears to be on kissanime</br>  <br>First definitely was jaw dropping around everything concerning magical fiesta. But I got chills when the parade started, and I actually think this has the better animation. You can see it clearly in Amanda.</br>  <br>If you were a backer you would know that you can DDL it from Vimeo.</br>  <br><br>if my computer is a toaster, and i say it's a toaster, what part of your small undeveloped nigger brain can't put 1 and 1 together to figure out i can't even magnet? <br><br>if there's an actual torrent on nyaa, say so, because i can't find it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> In order to kick off the event, Studio Trigger needed to sell at least 200 of the 400 possible tickets, but sales ended on August 12 with only 94 tickets sold.  <br><br> only 94 tickets sold <br><br>Damn.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't know that<br>how do you do that?</br></br>  <br>fuck off faggit</br>  what is the runtime for this ova? 35 minutes?  <br>if i never stream or used vimo, how would i by default know i could download the file? oh right, i wouldn't.</br>  <br> This video cannot be downloaded any more right now. Please try again later </br>  <br>Rude.</br>  <br>I never did magnets before but it worked fine for me.</br>  <br>The fuck are you on about? I don't know who you are.</br>  Jasmineka will turn out to be something greater in LWA3. I hope.  <br>Plus it had been out for six months. Everyone had already seen it, so the only draw was the creator talkback, which for a single OVA by a new studio isn't going to pull much attendance as a stand-alone event</br>  <br>There isn't anymore. It got deleted. You've got the magnet as your sole option.</br>  <br>There's a DDL link right under the video. They seem to be capping concurrent downloads, but it's the middle of the night EST so you probably should be able to get it.<br><br><br>Uh, because Trigger told us that there would be a download for backers two fucking years ago?<br><br><br>Yeah, that's the antiflood. I got that about eight times before it let me download it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>53 min</br>  <br> You can see it clearly in Amanda. <br>The only place you can see it clearly, because good luck taking your eyes off her.</br></br>  <br> My computer is a toaster so I can't magnet <br>Yes you can. You just don't know what the fuck is a magnet or how they work.</br></br>  <br>  The torrent you are looking for does not appear to be in the database. </br>  <br>have you tried turning it off and on again?</br>  <br>Toasters can use magnets.</br>  <br>Akkovision and Am and a vision were about 50/50 and all qt.</br>    <br>I'm pretty sure I came at this part.<br><br>I want to do lewd things to Mandy</br></br></br>  <br>I actually watched the entire show a few weeks ago, it was pretty damn funny. Shame it had so few seasons and the seasons were so short.</br>  <br>the magnet didn't work for me. what was that about toasters being able to use magnets again? idiot. <br><br>anyways, i found the download link on the vimo. thanks for nothing to the rest of you inept useless virgin fags.</br></br></br>  <br>wayfu4layfu</br>  <br>Are you insulting yourself?</br>  Reminder that Sucy is the best girl  <br>Ha, get fucked.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me. <br>Then you were holding it wrong.</br></br>  <br>That's what I thought as well. Figured she'd be a lot more rebellious. Smoking cigs, talking like a delinquent, etc.</br>  <br>You can't even call it a toaster then.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me <br>Clearly you're doing something wrong</br></br>  <br> mfw the person who sat in front of me at the premiere posted a picture of Yoshinari &amp; Otsuka to Instagram with the caption "based trigger" </br>  <br>Have you tried to swipe it across your HDD?<br>Fucking magnet, how do they work?</br></br>  so the download is around 590 mb right?  Does no one else like this qt?  <br>596 to be exact</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Dis nigga ain't got no magic in his heart.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>596.9mb</br>  <br>I like her, she's like a loli witch freeman</br>  <br>I thought she was a fun character but you're mostly going to get posts to the effect of <br> Constanze <br> I seriously hope you witches don't do this </br></br></br>  <br>slice of life is easy because it's cheap, i'd imagine.<br><br>then again i have no idea how budget is distributed in shows. Do they just pay the quality of animators? is it based on the number of frames to be made?</br></br></br>  <br>I wish she got some lines. But she's in the top 3 for me.</br>  <br>Just allow it in program you're using or copypaste it directly you sad faglord. Don't blame your incompetence on objects.</br>  <br> Akko, Sucy, Lotte, Diana, Ursula-sensei, Amanda, Constantze <br>These are the witches that cause me pathological grinning</br></br>  <br><br>god damn right i don't. but i had 300 bucks in my wallet when the kickstarter rolled around. and i'll have another 300 for the third ep.<br><br>and i'm not a nigger. i'm a proud aryan american national socialist.</br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCKING MAGNETS<br><br>HOW DO THEY WORK?</br></br></br>  <br>For some strange reason throughout I thought Constanze was a boy</br>  Haven't watched it yet. <br>Is Sucy still best girl?</br>  Fucking magnets, how do they work?  <br>Use those 300 dollars to buy a better toaster. Maybe one with four bread slots.</br>  <br>Yes. Amanda is best new girl though.</br>  <br><br>you're not funny. don't you have MLP to watch and a fedora to tip? you should go do that. you can fucking spot the redditors a mile away, i swear</br></br>  <br><br>its my understanding they work when the field lines created by the movement of electrons tend to point in a general direction instead of randomly cancelling each other out.</br></br>  I want some magic in my life  <br> that lotte botting </br>  <br>Please, keep posting.

I would.</br></br></br>  <br>I want one</br>  <br>I could throw 1000$ at it now.</br>  <br>That's a misconception.

(cough cough law school)</br>  <br>Akko is literally's Sucy's bitch. You can tell right away she's dominant as fuck.</br>  <br>I paid for this. Why would I watch it on vimeo if I can torrent it?</br>  <br>why is she in a magic school if she wants to build robots?</br>  <br>How about a 16-slice toaster?</br>   German is the ugliest <br>Just like in real life!</br>  <br>This nigga gets it.</br>  <br><br><br>shippers need to die<br><br>waifuism is the only way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why not? I'm enjoying them.</br>  <br>I would. Didn't back the previous one because I had doubts. No longer.</br>  <br>But can it open magnet links?</br>    <br>why would you need to if you have that much toast?</br>  If anyone is still downloading how fast is it going for you? I'm getting only getting 6KB/s.  <br>I was worried they wouldn't be able to capture the feeling of the original but they did a fantastic job. Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious.</br>  <br>Comparing the two, I think the first one had better lighting and smoothness of the overall animation, but that doesn't mean that this one was bad at all. It would be an added bonus though if they actually continue to improve on it until we get the BDs.</br>   There is no need to be upset   <br> Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious. <br>yeah klk was not bad but it didn't particularly wow me either.</br></br>  Cool, sticky, now we can just keep it in one thread.

I can't remember off the top of my head where the cutoff was.</br>  Trigger saved anime again.  <br>seriously. I'll admit i'm a very cynical person, even more so than is warrented much of the time. But at the end of the video I actually caught myself smiling. This series is just too fun and adventurous for me to dislike.</br>   Fat-chan's early design was this.   If Amanda was going to get exactly one doujin, which three fetishes should it have?  <br>Futa and two others</br>  <br>I was downloading this, does it mean my download is corrupted?</br>  <br>I'm happier with what we got.</br>  oh shit.<br>LWA is still on my backlog</br>  <br>Squinty eyed girl is cute.</br>  <br>Christ.</br>  <br>I was still in school, technically the 100$ I gave from money meant for books and other educational expenses.</br>  <br>Hurry up fam</br>  <br>If you weren't rolling around on the floor, writhing in joy anytime someone other than Jasmina was onscreen, you're bad at LWA.</br>  <br>Was doing other stuff plus I don't check /a/ too often anymore. Whenever I do come my pic folder manages to double in size.</br>  <br>Well the magic is needed to power those robots and technology she makes.</br>  Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one?  <br>For Fat-chan, they could've put in anybody and it would've worked. She was pretty useless...</br>  <br>Futa  and scat and snuff </br>  <br>Spats<br>Cowgirl Position<br>Femdom</br></br></br>  <br>I think they need to tone her down a bit</br>  <br>Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes.</br>  <br>I don't know, but for sure it should be illustrated by hirame.</br>  <br>Non-H, adventures, and with Diana</br>  <br>$300 to be in movie credits<br>$20 to be on website<br><br>less than that, and you just get an e-mail.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah! The crossover was great. Did they release it yet?</br>  <br>spats and femdom</br>  <br>YES<br>FUCKING YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. What a delightful series.  <br>femdom<br>zettai ryouiki<br>defloration</br></br></br>  <br>Fat-chan delivers candy to the people.</br>  <br> Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one? <br><br>I wanted to punch her, she was too fucking much. Then she has a sob which auto redeems her character some how and the plot falls on her lap. She's probably the worst character in the whole series, and it doesn't help that all the new girls were so delicious, smarter and level headed. <br><br>Akko behaves like a 10 year old girl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They needed her to be to set up for the heartwarming friendship to come out. When Lotte showed up and gave Akko the hat, I teared up a little.</br>  <br>That's the full one.</br>  <br>Early on yeah, had to be so that she could fall out with Lotte and Sucy in order to make up and save the day with the power of friendship.</br>  <br>Right~~ She was fine in the first one, but sorta kinda very annoying in this one. At least she became okay in the second half of the ep.</br>  <br> I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. </br>  <br>straight<br>consensual sex<br>missionary position</br></br></br>  <br>Your name is only in the credits if you backed $300.</br>  <br>And then there's THIS faggot...</br>  Damn hardsubs  I'm finally watching the movie. Amanda is fantastic as people said, so is Diana, Sucy being best as always. But I have to say Akko was a bit more annoying in this one, I can see why Yoshinari doesn't like her very much. Not that I hate her.  <br>I think you mean the fat girl eating donuts is the best girl</br>  <br><br>yes</br></br>  <br>Catch up, nigga</br>  This is like a cross between gainax/trigger and Disney. Absolutely stunning. I seriously hope they do more original stuff like this even if they need to kickstart more stuff just so they can have the freedom to do what they want without producers stopping them.  You guys do know that at this point it isn't really anime? It's literally for the western audience.<br>Man, Trigger really sold out.</br>  <br>Sounds like you could have used those.</br>  <br>But the cannonball...</br>  What Akko needs is someone to calm her down. Like a girlfriend.  Like Diana   <br>Trigger confirmed for bros</br>  <br>You again? Go away.</br>  <br>Now I remember why I put the name as Anonymous instead of something fun. I would've loved to see my name in the movie, but I rather not have my name posted on a website rarely anyone will visit besides spambots. Can't wait to get the Bluray though.</br>  WHERE WERE YOU<br><br>WHEN TRIGGER SAVED ANIME?</br></br>  <br>give me a break I doing shots.</br>  This thread is moving too sanic for me now.  What's the point of the HorribleSubs release?  Is [HorribleSubs] good?  <br> Disney <br>Funny you mention that, because there was rumors Pixar was working with Trigger.</br></br>  <br> Not Sucy <br>She'll keep her calm.  Forcibly </br></br>  <br> Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes. <br>How would tomatoes work as a fetish? Like a bunch of shotas shoving tomatoes into her, filling her up with them?</br></br>  Lets be honest, nobody cares about this shit anymore. Wasted money.  <br>Gross.</br>  <br><br>How to spot the retarded Redditfag.</br></br>  <br>Saw my name in the credits. Kinda wish I had put a silly one.</br>    <br>Her girlfriend is sushi.</br>  I don't get it.<br>Why does trigger produce trash like kill lel kill, inoushit and ninja slayer when they have the original right LWA?</br>  <br> What's the point of the HorribleSubs release? <br>Well for one the previous upload got deleted, again</br></br>   sticky <br>Okay, now this thread is total cancer.</br>  <br>nothing weird like that<br>just reverse cowgirl while juggling tomatoes<br>thats good clean fun.</br></br></br>  <br>We know it's you Diana.</br>  <br>Ah yes, anon's bait.</br>  Amanda has some nice thighs.  <br>Because Yoshinari has yet to work on full-length TV shows.</br>  <br><br>e-peen.<br><br> we were the first to release LWA2, guys! </br></br></br></br>  It was worth it, Trigger is truly saving anime.  <br>I'm sure Sucy has ways of keeping people calm. I'm sure they involve mushrooms.</br>    I hereby claim that my $400 paid for Trigger to come up with Amanda. I called it, now you never can, neener neener neener.   that scene where Lotte sings <br> I imagine it's Rukia singing </br>  <br> CGDCT <br>Fuck off you lazzy cunt.</br></br>  <br><br>Maybe the shitposting won't happen as fast.</br></br>  <br>Use the juice as lube.</br>  <br>who?</br>  Fuck I have work due and still have the first one on my backlog, should I just cram it all tonight or take my time and enjoy it tomorrow?  <br>Tomato juice would make terrible lube. Far to acidic.</br>  <br>Fuck work, nigga.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127565290   <br>put aren't vagoos already acidic anyway?</br>  <br>Get to work man, the OVA will keep.</br>  <br><br>Of course. Didn't you know anime will become illegal tomorrow? Better get your anime in before the feds come for you, pedo.</br></br>  <br> How would tomatoes work as a fetish. <br><br>They use Roger or Kyouko instead of fat, balding, old men.</br></br></br>  <br>put in some baking soda?</br>  <br>Okay, that was amusing and that  is nice (nice triples) but as I said, she could've been replaced by anybody. I like her but she is the most replaceable of any of the new girls.</br>  <br>we will still be here tomorrow anon, take care of your obligations.</br>  <br>Standard procedure is to pay animators one ramen noodle per frame drawn. <br>That's why TV anime would often fall into QUALITY, since they were under extremely tight deadlines to shit out as many frames as possible.<br>KyoAni has been famously paying its artists by the hour, allowing for a slightly less stressed work output. Still often looks like shit since most of the animators are female, but you take what you can get.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. Most bodily fluids are close to pH neutral, unless you've got something wrong with you.</br>    <br>Screwing on a pile of tomatoes, throwing tomatoes at each other while screwing, licking tomato paste off each other,  inserting a whole tomato in her anus , etc</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  I never understood the extreme fascination /a/ had for LWA, I just don't get it.  Did everybody use their real fucking names? Where's the Nig Ger Dix?  When will Diana admit her yuri?  <br> Not really. <br>yes really<br>vaginal pH is typically 3.5 to 4.5.</br></br></br>  That furby  <br>of course you don't anon, you're just a fagoot.</br>  <br>Suck a dick, pinko scum.</br>    <br> Mohammed Malik <br>kek</br></br>  were all of you watching this with a hand on your dick? it wasn't that good, it was just okay  <br> tfw misread Guckin as "Cuckin" <br>I spend too much time here.</br></br>  Watching this made me really happy. It sounds dumb, but it made me feel joy in a way so few anime have. I'm so glad I backed and believed in them.  <br>Those names are the $300+ tier, probably not too many jokers in that bunch.</br>  When did this happen? I din't even know there was going to be a LWA2 in the first place.  I didn't know Akko was gay for Sucy.  <br><br>It's literally NOTHING special.</br></br>  <br>Lurk moar, faggot.</br>  <br> feel joy in a way so few anime have. <br><br>Maybe you just have shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br> Gameboy <br> Tamagotchi <br> Furby <br> SNES </br></br></br></br>  Full show when?  <br>uh, anon</br>  <br>And the tamagotchi too.</br>  Them thighs  I want to fuck Akko.  <br>They could've at least alphabetized it but yeah... what  said.</br>  <br>That rarely works for screencaps so fuck off.</br>  <br>goodTaste/10</br>  Here's some more.

Like ideally i want to believe the people torrenting it did drop the money already and are not hurting the potential sales. It was well worth the money.  <br> It's only anime when it's headed by the elevens. <br>You obviously didn't read what I was implying.</br></br>  <br> "hey-soos" <br> not "Hey, Zeus" <br>You had one fucking job, nigger.</br></br></br>  <br> This episode is brought to you by: The color blue </br>  <br>Attentionwhoring, even in death.</br>  <br>What else in there?<br>Game Boy, Tamagatchi, SuperFami, don't recognize the wand, Walkman...</br></br>  Technomage is best witch, pass it on.  <br>Blue from /a/, though I'm not sure he posts with the name anymore.</br>  <br>No one cares what you think</br>  <br>Why is this the only time /a/ is against torrenting. Fuck off with the hypocrisy. Everyone should download the HorribleSubs release and only buy the BD if they liked it.</br>  Post your favorite background witches  <br>You were implying nonsense. Go whine in a Ninja Slayer thread, or make an Aku no Hana thread and shitpost about how Japan has fallen to Western standards.</br>  <br> Why is this the only time /a/ <br> implying /a/ is in this thread <br>This is normalfag central my friend.</br></br></br>  <br><br>but it's ok to torrent everything else? They had the production paid for completely, they aren't losing anything. Any sale is a bonus.</br></br>  I ship  Akko X Lotte   <br>I torrented it without paying.<br>What are you going to do bitch.</br></br>  <br>I remember seeing him a few months ago but nothing since. Did he died?</br>  Thank you trigger for show tomatos in face and that ducking stool. <br><br>Its as close as we're going to get to WAM stuff with dunk tanks fully animated in /a/.</br></br>  OST when?  <br>I ship  LWA2 BDs in August, thanks for the support </br>  <br>Lotte</br>  Quick stitch of all backers.  <br>And that's why they fucked up by sticking it in /a/. This should go in /co/ where it belongs. Also yuri pandering in an already backed OVA, Kek Trigger you're not selling high so why are you trying to get the panderbux?</br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br>If I'm not mistaken, he's still around.  meguca  maybe.</br>  Watched at the premiere today, sitting outside an event hall torrenting this on my phone because I want to watch it again; it was that good.   Witch Knight <br><br>Whatever that is, I want to watch it.</br></br>  <br>You're a sick man  and my nigga .</br>  There goes my ONE THOUSAND DORRARS.<br><br>No regrets, of course.</br></br>  Now we just need Little Gentlemen Academia  I want to marry Lotte.  <br>Shit meant to quote </br>  <br> GARfunkel <br> Edward <br>...heh.</br></br></br>  <br>All $300+ backers.<br>We paid good money to get our names there.</br></br>  <br> Diana's groupies will never belittle your penis </br>  <br>there will be people who choose to torrent or stream or find an uploaded version online that never intended to buy the physical copy. There will be plenty of people, me included, who watch the ova online and then buy the bluray when it becomes available</br>  <br>Uh huh...</br>  someone has a webm with fatty-chan and the catapult? That scene was glorious.  COLLIN, WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THIS THREAD. SPEAK UP.  was the first ova this devoid of music? Half the time it just felt really "empty" listening to Akko's voice over and over again without the whimsical music in the background.  So is horriblesubs better than the first one that got deleted. Downloaded both and which one should I watch?  <br>OVA three plot confirmed?</br>  <br>You already did, but here's another.</br>    <br>It's the same version. They just reuped it.</br>  <br>what about the subs are they identical?</br>  <br>Un-glassed eyes...!</br>  <br>Ask and you shall receive.</br>  <br> Cute no-glasses face </br>  <br>Shiny Chariot versus Witch Knight, with antics from the girls meanwhile? Or maybe Akko (as Shiny Chariot) versus Diana (as Witch Knight)?<br><br>There really needs to be one last finale. A trilogy would be perfect.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>And now male version w/ headphones</br></br></br>  <br>why shouldn't they be. This isn't fansubbed, it's the official subs distributed to the KS donators.</br>  <br>awesome, I love it.</br>  <br><br>Maybe she's Lotte's Chariot.</br></br>  <br> unironically implying yuri sells </br>  <br>i thought they are hard subbed</br>  <br> one last finale <br> not a 2 cour series </br></br>  <br><br>Not to mention the official subs are hardcoded, so there's no point in trying to lay out a new subtitle track.</br></br>   paying for anime <br>Am I on reddit?</br>   No "A believing heart is your magic" <br>You had one job, Trigger</br>  <br>Yuri hints sell. Madoka sold like crazy and so did K-On. Trigger wanted in on some of those panderingbux.</br>  <br>The quality wouldn't be the same, we'd get some ninja slayer animation</br>  <br>A trilogy of OVAs and then a series is fine too.<br><br>Learning more about the school and the other characters while they go on misadventures would be able to span quite a few episodes.</br></br></br>  <br>DASA!</br>  IS there an OST download?  <br>In this case not paying for it actually means it's not getting made.<br>If they didn't hit the KS goal it wouldn't of been created in the first place.</br></br>  <br> panderingbux <br>Added to filter.</br></br>  <br>It's weird, I had the same thought, though no outline to make that comparison.</br>  <br>Thank you! I really enjoyed your movie.</br>  Kinky.  <br> Wanting a TV series from Triiger. <br>If the OVA which took years to do looks OK at best in the first half then imagine how bad the tv anime would look. Maybe even lower than Ninja Slayer and they won't be even doing it ironically.</br></br>  <br>They sold for reasons not related to yuri.</br>  <br> kill la kill  looked good</br>  <br>Don't engage him</br>  <br>Explain LL then. Yuri hints sell in Japan. That's what Trigger wanted to which is a shame because the first OVA was better without all this nonsense.</br>  <br>That's why I originally said a trilogy of OVAs. They can amass the funds via Kickstarter again, take their time with it and have it look equally as good as LWA2 or potentially better.<br><br><br>You're going to get a lot of flak for that, especially with certain episodes and CG.</br></br></br></br>  I just got back from work.<br><br>Any update on when HD is being uploaded to nyaa?</br></br>    <br>It's a pet project, so I could see a kickstarter-backed trilogy OVA. <br>Plot-wise, Witch Knight would be someone other than Diana, given that small spiel about her family heritage. Is WK even current, or bygone like Chariot?</br></br>  <br>Nice fallacy.</br>  <br>no<br><br>it's a webm<br><br>webm is best</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy fucking legs</br>  <br>At the anime expo premiere the speaker had a shirt that said Pixar animation on the left side if his chest</br>  <br>Say you're right and it does sell. All Trigger did was make a decision to give some fanservice to the majority who would like it, seeing as how it's popular and sales-driving. In other words they don't care about you, the minority, so cry more.</br>  <br>Try reading some manga, there's a shit ton of comfy stuff in fantastical settings<br> Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou <br> Aria <br> Dead Dead Demons Dedededestruction <br> Kyoukai Senjou no Rinbo </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>As main director you mean? <br><br>Because he's worked as lead animator and episode director on more than one TV show</br></br></br>  <br>And Sucy collects it all and sells it off on some sketch site.</br>  i like how the giant got cute at the end.<br><br>Everything was comfy.</br></br>  <br>Japs wear shirts with random English on them all the time.</br>  <br>Love YKK. So pleasant.</br>  <br>Kek. You know this OVA is stained by the yuribait because Trigger wants some mire money when it could've been better without it but you will always defend it won't you Triggerdrone?</br>  <br> You had one job, Trigger </br>  <br>If I remember correctly, they didn't change that much (or at all) in the BDs, right? There was a lot of questionable animation for KlK. Never watched Inou Battle but I imagine that was decently animated.</br>  <br> yuribait <br> Triggerdrone <br>Gave yourself away pretty quickly, didn't you?</br></br></br>  <br> Inferno Cop <br>Yes<br> gg fansubs <br>No</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br>Here's your reply</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br> shitposting in a sticky </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br>KLK was manly?</br>  <br>And I don't care about them either. I didn't back their shit. I torrented it and uploaded it on other torrent trackers so that people find it easier to dl.<br>It's just laughable how people proclaim that Trigger cares about what they do and animate when in reality are no different than any other studio that does design by committee.</br></br>  <br>I know this is bait but<br> implying Trigger aren't the biggest yurifags </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>years ago Gainax actually paid a visit to Pixar.

Pure animation porn.</br></br>  <br>People like yuri pandering so they gave it to them. What exactly is the problem again? Sounds to me like you're just  triggered. </br>  <br>Why is Saber such a slut?</br>  <br>Honestly, I'm glad they subverted expectations with all three of those girls. They seemed like a group that would be at ends with the original three until you actually saw them interact. Even the Constanze, without any verbal interactions, came off different than expected. I thought she would be somewhat similar to Sucy's attitude.</br>  Who is best Little Witch?  <br>The robot.</br>   no panties <br>Oh my.</br>  <br>Because she know how to please men.</br>  <br>Did they fuck?</br>  Sushi pls  <br>she is a cutie you monster</br>  Blewit indeed.  <br>Those are brooms.</br>  Did I miss something?

Free wasn't homobait too right?</br>  <br>Ha!</br>  <br> wouldn't of </br>  Shadow or see-through spats?  <br>Kill la Kill was good and Ninja Slayer is fun. Inou was a meh adaption of a meh source. Most of Triggers work is at least above average at the very least which is more than you can say for most studios.</br>  It feels almost like a TV show rather than another movie. In a good way though. It feels comfy rather than grandoise.  <br>anon hes probably not good enough for nvidia</br>    <br>She does know there's a patent on this kind of thing, right?<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8tab<wbr>9C3GW3U</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> witches <br> not sluts <br>None of them wear panties.</br></br></br>  <br>This.

I haven't been keeping up with it but I last recall there being disputes amongst the creative teams. I'm keeping hype to a minimum, even after Trigger fulfilled expectations of a Kickstarter anime.<br><br>There was KickHeart as well... anything else from KS?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> At first worried that the 3 new characters would steal precious time from the 3 mains <br> After watching it now I'm sad that there wasn't more.  <br><br>that was a fun time. Bravo trigger.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>A proper reaction to all these delicious underage thighs.</br></br>    <br>Tim Schafer. RIP Spacebase.</br>  <br>Shota-Tattun.</br>   LWA The Enchanted Parade - 01 <br><br> 01  <br><br>So... there will be a second "episode" coming, right?<br><br>Right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like she's straight out of adventure time or Steven Universe. Design wise i mean.</br>  <br>Trigger's already said they aren't planning any more LWA.</br>  That part in Trigger's email to the backers about "still finishing up the anime as I type this", I think Yoshinari is cracking the whip over the animators' heads to fix some scenes. The part where the Giant falls back to sleep and the civilians climb all over it was pretty QUALITY. Hopefully they fix that for the BDs, though. I wonder if we'll get another Making Of documentary?  <br> anything else from KS? <br>There was that under the dog thing from some nobody, in the end he took the money and ran, which is what anybody stupid enough to back that thing deserved.</br></br>  That was pretty nice.  <br>What, citation or bullshit.</br>    <br>Not anytime soon, anyway. They'll probably wait until the numbers come in for BD sales. Wish they'd make another movie, I don't care if it takes another two-three years.</br>  Looks like they had international help for sound (Russia and Paris).

It was bothering me what it looked like. Kept coming back to Scott Pilgrim, but that wasn't right.</br>  <br>Just play Deathsmiles</br>  <br><br> Otsuka has stated that if the sequel performs well, they may potentially look into producing a television series or full-length film. </br></br>  <br> 1.5 million for a full TV series <br>That's nowhere near enough</br></br>  I TOLD YOU DIANA<br><br>I TOLD YOU THOSE KIDS ARE IRREDEEMABLY EVIL AND PERSECUTORS OF WITCHES<br><br>THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR RESCUING ONE OF THEM</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm still convinced they blew the majority of their budget on episode one. <br><br>They had to have. When you have scenes like https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Uhm<wbr>BnaEcbfA</wbr>  [ ] ? There's no way.</br></br></br>  <br>In the first one i believe they mention that there's ley lines and that the school is just situated on a nexus of them and the stone just sort of acts to contain a large part of that energy. so presumably their powers work best near ley lines and their intersecting nodes. I'd assume the stone acts like a large battery so that there's a constant large supply of magic for all the students to use in their training. <br><br>I dunno.</br></br></br>  <br>What si with the tiny mayor?</br>  That was great. I'm really looking forward to Trigger's next fully animated TV project.   The sequel was just as good as the first one <br>based trigger</br>  Sticky. <br><br>Why?</br></br>  Sup  <br>There was a sticky for the Kickstarter way back when. A LOT of people here backed it.</br>  <br>Because /a/ largely funded it.</br>  <br>Because the mod didn't want dozens of threads in the catalog again. We also had three stickies for the Kickstarter back-to-back  two were unnecessary  so it's probably the same mod, I guess.</br>  <br><br>I wonder how you retards imagine turning money into animation. A vending machine dispensing key frames? <br>First episode looked good because they actually had time to finish it beforehand, further along their schedule collapsed because Umetsu and everyone else involved in the production are incompetent.</br></br></br>  <br>Because it's one of those magical times where /a/ actually agreed on something</br>  /ss/?  <br><br>They could add something in similar to how other fantasy universes do it (If they ever expanded their universe).<br><br>The more experience you get as a mage, the more mana you can hold. Or they could be given things similar to what the MC has that hold exponentially more mana/magic.<br><br>I think it actually could make for a more interesting story. I've always like the lore where mages can't just shit out spells, but actually have to draw it from a souce.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why? It would only end up as an even more budget KlK. I just threw up a little typing that.</br>  <br>I forgot Inflation. My bad.<br>Let's say 2.2 million to be safe.</br></br>  Posting in a sticky   LWA get sticky <br> LOGH anime and novel being licensed didn't </br>  <br>Checked</br>  <br>It also help make sense of why the rest of the world has progressed mostly along the lines of modern technology and magic is seen as a backwards curiosity.</br>  <br>Because anime was finally saved.</br>  <br>Who the fuck cares about it being licensed?

I love you Akko.<br>I love you so much. <br>You are so beautiful and perfect.<br><br>I LOVE YOU!</br></br></br></br>  Why is this not a 12 episode anime?<br> YOSHINARI COME ON.</br>  <br>I was only replying with the same logic he used.<br><br>If he wants us to tolerate anime with fanservice without telling people to go to /e/ then he has to tolerate anime without fanservice without telling people to go to /co/.</br></br></br>  <br><br> implying that she doesn't use her poison to rape you </br></br>  <br>Sucy does the raping.</br>  <br> while you're facefucking her  <br> lucy shoves a mushroom up your butt causing you to lose strength  <br> she rapes you instead  <br>   you can't ejaculate due to the mushroom and you can only feel pain from the absence of your ejaculation </br></br></br></br>  <br>I love how her face switched from surprise to that smile</br>  <br>Do you honestly think that people don't like LWA2 just because it didn't have fanservice?</br>  <br>You need to pay the Jews shekel is magic.</br>  I wasn't liking the first half very much but the second half was so freaking great I forgave all of it's faults.  <br>You need 12 kickstarters then</br>  <br>Oh what then, it's not Japanese enough for you? It's not even western enough. It's more of a mix of both.<br>We like Japanese anime and manga, but we aren't all wapanese here, you know.</br></br>  I'm actually a bit upset now because Mandy was so great and now we'll never see more of her.  <br>People not liking LWA2 is a strong overreaction that is always mandatory when a large amount of people are hyped over something.<br><br>They will whine and whine about it because they can't stand people being happy.<br><br>This has happened with every show that generated large amounts of hype.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Lets make TWELVE kickstarters! Lets do it!</br></br>  <br>I cannot comprehend people not liking it</br>   For the second time a "big bad" gets BTFO by Shiny Chariot move <br><br>How was Shiny Chariot not OP as fuck? No one seems to respect her, but she had the most OP as fuck wand, constantly took on huge "ancient" bullshit.<br><br>The power levels in this anime make no fucking sense.</br></br></br></br>   you try to fuck a slavshit <br> she farts and kills your boner </br>  <br>Yes anon. You should be able to buy it.</br>  <br>Because they didn't backed up the kickstarter</br>  <br>SUCY Best magical Egyptian dancer.</br>  <br>But that is Atleir.<br><br>Did you think the potions and food and bombs you make in Atleir can't be used in combat?</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe the Mahou community excommunicated her and pulled a pic-related.<br><br>Didn't work out as well as it hoped, though.</br></br></br>  <br>She put on flashy shows for Muggles which was frowned upon by the witching community. Notice how most of the teachers at the academy are No Fun Allowed types and Diana, who is from a noble house of witches or something, also disdains frivolity.</br>  The orgy that followed will be in the BD right?  So what big overarching plot for LWA is possible?<br><br>More Ancient Evil Awakens?</br></br>  Well damn that came out quicker than I expected.<br>I thought it would still have so many delays.<br><br>Those you of who are disappointed judging by budget are forgetting kickstarter is an investment system, you are investing money into the company not buying a product.<br><br>You are investing in not just LWA2 but everything the company offers, it would not be unreasonable for the some of the budget to be used on things like KLK, of course they need the majority of it for LWA2 plus any merch they produce.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Disney movies cannot show orgies.</br>  <br> boys <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>flashy shows apparently double as boss-finishing moves</br>  <br>akko becomes the new shiny chariot that's it</br>  <br>Akko needs to pass or she'll be put back a year!</br>  <br><br>It's not necessary when they all can grow futa dicks anyway.</br></br>  How much money did they get from the kickstarter to make this?<br>It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime.</br>  <br> you are investing money into the company not buying a product. <br>Except you aren't. Unless if you think you are investing in Nike by buying a pair of sneakers.</br></br>  <br> /x/ </br>  <br>I can see it being an episodic SoL-type thing. Some possible episodes are<br><br> Akko wants to get gud at broom flying and enlists her friends' help <br> Lotte enters a spell-singing competition <br> Sucy's potion goes horribly wrong and turns most of the school into zombies <br> Witch Knight comes to town <br> Amanda tries to pull off a heist but gets captured and Team Akko needs to rescue her <br> Diana has a Muggle fan club, which her family disapproves of </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean horny zombies.</br>  <br>The Kickstarter was only there to extend the lenght.<br><br>150.000 for 15 additional minutes. <br><br>A TV anime would be much more expensive because:<br><br>1) It would be much longer resulting into higher costs in every department<br>2) The whole thing needs far more management because you can't just put something on TV out of nothing<br>3) You don't do a TV show only for the sake of having a TV show - You need partners in many departments to get the best out of it<br><br>A TV anime that does LWA justice would probably cost a few millions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doujins when?</br>  Other than the boys' gang, this was as good as the first one. And those fights, damn! So much background animation.  <br> It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime. <br>The Japanese people don't give a shit about it and westeners don't buy BDs.</br></br>  Who's the biggest dyke this time now?  <br>Japan has shit taste, this is an established fact.</br>  <br>Diana always</br>  <br>Diana will keep being tsun to Akko until the point where Akko actually reaches her goal and becomes a witch worthy of Dianna's admiration.</br>  <br>Posting in a sticky.</br>  The magnet still works! Thanks anon!  <br>is this shit even good</br>  <br>More than a few, a few million would get you a pretty cheap looking TV show. Maybe 3 or 4 million though.</br>  Damn, that was way better than the first one. A 8/10 for me. Other than that annoying group of boys, the music, animation and overall just sealed it for me. Amanda and Lotte are best girls.<br><br>Also, GSC figures when? Maybe even Nendoroids.</br></br>  <br>Why would another studio fund a rival upcoming studio?<br>Studio Trigger is too new and ambitious, overtime they'll build up a better financial base and be able to do the things they want to do.<br><br>Not every studio started making what they make now, hell some of them were smaller than Trigger and just uni students.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Can't we just take the kickstarter budget, multiply it by 12 or make 12 of them and get a full season? <br><br>Is it not that simple?</br></br></br></br>  Fuck you, I ain't streaming this shit. Payers forced to pirate, good.  <br>Like Gainax you mean?</br>  <br>It's better for LWA to stay a OVA series or maybe extend into feature movie format.<br><br>Nobody would fund a TV show with this much quality. It would break everyones budget.</br></br></br>  The wallpaper makes a lot more sense now.  http://i.imgur.com/XfS1BQH.jpg  <br>You can.<br>But that would probably take 5-10 years to finish.</br></br>  <br><br>Just use JDownloader.

I'm not saying the show isn't kid-friendly, but to act like the staff didn't intend the characters to be cute and attractive to nerds is ridiculous. Fuck, even mainstream TV stuff really obviously marketed at kids tends to make sure to draw the characters in an attractive way to appeal to fanboys &amp; fangirls, so to expect Trigger to take that stance would be insane.<br><br>The "westaboo anime" stuff is wrong too. LWA is a million times more anime-esque than Panty &amp; Stocking, and Panty &amp; Stocking itself was far more anime-esque than people claim in spite of the colossal western cartoon influences.<br><br>It's true that Yoshinari is a "westaboo" in that he even worships stuff that English-speaking cartoon nerds don't give a fuck about like Atomic Betty, but LWA is not a "westaboo" work in itself at all. It simply uses principles associated with good ANIMATION in general; just because those animation principles first came about in the west and were written down by Disney doesn't mean they are "westaboo", as pretty much all well-animated anime with "cartoony" aesthetics use them. LWA itself is no more "westaboo" than FLCL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127572299 <br> You mean "no subs". <br>No, I mean too Japanese.

So where's the website where I can jerk over my name if I backed just 20 american euros?  <br>These designs are extremely anime-like; you won't find a western cartoon that looks like this unless it's directly influenced by anime. It's not "westaboo" it's just traditional anime aesthetics executed well.

I've watched LWA1 several dozen times, and I'll probably do the same with LWA2. The characters are so lovable and I want more of them. I also have a major weakness for witches.  I forgot she was the voice of Hime from Happiness Charge Precure. Now Akko sounds like Hime to me rather than Hime sounding like Akko.<br><br>I guess that's what happens when a show runs for an entire year VS. a single OVA</br></br>  <br> so he at least knows that he's not white <br>Animators only do line art, you know?</br></br>  Team Sushio  <br>This works because it's short and there was large pause between 1 and 2.<br>If this ends up normal 12+ anime series you'll get your usual load of QUALITY, cliches, filler and inane shit.</br></br>  <br>Do we need more though?

KLK was disappointing.  even Rocky had a montage  Good subs when?  <br> I wonder what Trigger's next TV series will be like <br>Nowhere to go but up</br></br>  noice   Constantze's wand turning into a drill   <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-07-02/trigger-teases-new-pro<wbr>ject-and-new-inferno-cop-little-wit<wbr>ch-academia-crossover-short/.90008<br><br> Studio Trigger teased a new project, its fourth major project, at its Anime Expo panel on Thursday. It showed preliminary designs of several school students as well as a verdant city in the sea, intersected with bridges. The staff members added that the project has yet to be announced in Japan. Because of that, they disallowed photographs of the art and could not take questions on the project from the audience. <br><br> Studio Trigger also showed an Inferno Cop short with a crossover with Little Witch Academia characters. The staff said that the short has yet to premiere in Japan. </br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Good point.</br>  <br>Recent comments from Trigger people along with the release of a Nishigori art book hint that it will probably be something that Nishigori will be in charge of, so I expect it to be competent but not particularly impressive. Nishigori is a skilled artist but he's not quite as good as people like Imaishi and Yoshinari, and his designs are only GREAT as opposed to merely good when they're simply finalized versions based upon endless concept sketches from Gainax/Trigger people, like Panty &amp; Stocking and Gurren Lagann's designs.<br><br>I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again, a more major project than Yucie.</br></br></br>  <br>Look, the color palettes aren't even consistent between scenes.<br>Obviously, they didn't do much pre-production planning on these characters.</br></br>  <br> I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again <br>iktfb, I watch flcl like 4 times a year.</br></br>  <br><br>I think there will be a TV "remaster" of Ninja Slayer. I'm not sure what it will entail but I assume they'll just replace most of the Inferno Cop stuff with normal animation.</br></br>  <br>Mute loli mecha witch best new witch.</br>  <br>It reminded me that KLK was as great as LWA and that I love Trigger</br>  <br><br>She gives off such professional vibe.</br></br>  <br> It is fanservice for fans of western animation, though! <br>Yes because it was so uncannily similar to shitty flash animation. </br></br>  <br>What needs to happen now is a slice of life show starring all of Trigger's original characters living together and getting up to antics<br><br>I always wanted that from Gainax</br></br></br>  <br>LWA3 When</br>  <br>That makes no sense. The Inferno Cop stuff is the only point of Ninja Slayer.</br>  <br>You're right, but once again: if the short fat man was meant to be Ian J then Hori kinda fucked up because he doesn't actually look like Ian J in the least beyond being chubby and having what Hori probably sees as "black man lips".<br><br>But yeah, it was probably just something he added in of his own accord and it wasn't any "GUYS LET'S ADD STEVEN UNIVERSE STUFF" talk he had with the staff. See also that Connie lookalike being light-skinned and Mabel and Dipper's colors being totally off.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd be fine with a daicon-esque music video featuring all their characters.</br>  I wish the western animation industry wasn't irredeemably shit.  <br>That has nothing to do with /pol/ though.<br>JADF = Just Another DrawFag<br><br>You might be confusing it with JIDF.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Because the people who worked on LWA are people from the Japanese anime industry.</br>  <br> I always wanted that from Gainax <br>That would end up looking like Kappa Mikey between all the different art styles</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br> When an American studio tries to copy animu, like Avatar and Korra, it still goes on /co/. Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>You know, I see a pattern in there.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Anon do you realize your example goes against your point</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br> Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>For the same reason Avatar and Korra belong on /co/? I'm not really following you here.</br></br>  <br>I'm gonna be pissed as fuck if the new show will have the same schedule/budget problem KLK had.<br>A third of the episode were almost unwatchable.<br>I hope by now they have their shit together.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it was better than the first.</br>  <br>Otsuka wasn't the series director of FLCL but he directed like 3 out of 6 episodes. He wrote both LWAs and his input on Gurren Lagann was similarly important (he directed some of the best, most important episodes) but he is practically never, ever talked about. <br><br>The man strikes me as a "silent protector" of sorts for Trigger &amp; Gainax projects. No one even notices him but I'm sure a lot of the qualities of things that people consider classics while attributing entirely to people like Tsurumaki or Imaishi were Otsuka's doing.<br><br>I mean, the guy directed Gurren episode 8, the episode that made /a/ go fucking nuts when it aired.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah dude that would be to simple.

Korra and Avatar are still /co/ because the mindset is cartoon. It doesn't matter that they had actual Japanese studios, and sweatshops full of dirty Koreans working on them.<br><br>That's not what makes anime, anime. Trigger is no different. It's an Americanized studio full of westaboos, which is even worse than an American studio full of weeaboos.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  full fledged anime series when  The mugshots of the new girls made me think of that Psycho Pass ED.    <br>Hopefully never.</br>  fuck this was too perfect, i loved it.  <br>Subcontracting things doesn't make American cartoons anime.<br><br>Meanwhile, LWA and Panty&amp;Stocking are anime. You mad?</br></br></br>  <br>So much pout and grumpiness.</br>  <br>What makes anime anime is that they're made and produced by Japanese studios<br><br>Korra isn't that, regardless of how it looks, and anything Gainax or Trigger makes is that, also regardless of how it looks.<br><br>"Anime" isn't the design or how many archetypal characters a show has. If you watched enough anime you'd realise that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is nothing "Americanized" about LWA. It's a very well-made anime. The problem is you've associated actual good character designs and animation as "western", and you think anime is defined by being generic shit.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Why are none of you bringing up the fact that LWA is extremely anime-like? The designs are anime as fuck, it's just appealingly-drawn anime. The standards of cartoon "appeal" were defined by Americans, but ALL good-looking anime use them. LWA is no more "westaboo" than FLCL; both have western media references but both are largely very anime-like.<br><br>Yoshinari is also a huge fan of Osamu Tezuka; people also say Tezuka works are "western cartoon style" but they're not, they took western influences but utilized them in a uniquely Japanese way. In fact, Tezuka style is the purest form of the "traditional anime" aesthetic and the best-looking "traditional anime" is made by people who understand what Tezuka created on a deeper level than the average artist.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Anime and American animation are so far apart from each other that they have almost nothing in common. All LWA has is some vague stylistic similarities, probably in the character design, and that's it. It's nowhere near enough to bridge the gap between the two.<br><br>But I guess to some people (read: clueless newbies) anime is defined by pantyshots and power levels.</br></br></br>  <br>Anime isn't a genre. Welcome to /a/.</br>  Stop responding to the dumbass who's been trying forever to convince people to accept his retarded definition of "anime," and that the hundreds of people on /a/ who funded the show back when it had a sticky are secretly crossboarding /co/-scum.  <br>my thoughts exactly, I normally really like that type of character but it was too much</br>  <br>So Studio Pierrot isn't Japanese now?

Sorry.</br>  <br><br>Fucking hivemind, man.<br><br>But yeah the "westaboo" stuff is silly, Yoshinari being more into American cartoons than the average Japanese creator notwithstanding. LWA is a very anime-like work and there's no reason beyond pretentiousness to see it as something that goes "beyond anime" and becomes "something greater". It's simply good anime.<br><br>Panty &amp; Stocking was an overt American cartoon tribute and far more western-styled than LWA but it was still anime as fuck. It was full of Kanada-style animation which is basically the most Japanese form of animation imaginable along with use of anime-like perspective and expressions and countless other things.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    It was fine I guess, I'm really biased against disney cliches though.  <br>Isn't it a shitty vimeo link?<br>Since Kikestarter got hacked I deleted my account so I don't know.

Tezuka may have taken Bambi's eyes, but his overall style is not at all like that of Bambi. He was more overtly influenced by Carl Barks' Donald Duck comics, but that's only part of it. Fleischer animation clearly played a colossal part, at least their early work from before they tried to rip off Looney Tunes and Disney; he liked Popeye so much that he inserted him in his Monkey King manga.<br><br>Yoshinari's "normal anime" art looks so fucking appealing and good because he understands the foundation of the aesthetic.

Character design, animation style (and quality), backgrounds, music, sound design, voice acting, stories, direction, editing, visual language, cultural sensibilities, character archetypes... at best LWA bears some vague resemblance to some American animation on a superficial level.<br><br>I'm guessing you're really new to anime and have a very superficial, cliche-driven understanding of it. Either that or you're a shill.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for reminding me /a/, LWA e-mail is apparently spam.</br>  <br>Tattun and at least Wakabayashi went to Pixar for multiple days before the con.<br><br>They almost certainly are doing something for them.</br></br></br>  <br> Inferno Cop will never get a 1080p BD release with smooth 60FPS animation </br>   <br> I cannot refute this claim because I know nothing about what LWA originates from! <br>Thanks for continuously showing how little you know about anime.

While posing as a fan.<br><br> It's a rip-off because it's a poor clone that brings nothing new to the table. <br>A clone of what?</br></br></br></br>  There's something very wrong about this frame. It's like I'm not even watching anime.   Trigger announces new project <br>   Aerial Girls </br>  <br> They inevitably fight each other <br> Which culminates on them realizing something <br> That they want hot steamy kisses from each other while holding hands </br></br></br>  <br> Everyone here is from Leddit <br><br>Yeah, no, faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Akko breaks a leg and her friends try to cheer her up for roughly 40 minutes of screentime.</br>  <br>That Famicon.</br>  <br><br>Anime cuteness is very different from western cartoon cuteness and comparing LWA to 90s Disney style is the most surface-level and shallow thing.<br><br>Look at how Tezuka drew a 'cute cartoon bunny girl' design vs. how a Disney film did it. Anime cuteness is far more focused on the bare impression than the details. Takashi Murakami (I think) once made the point that a cartoon cat in the west is "a drawing of a cat", while Japan's Hello Kitty feels like "a drawing of a drawing of a cat". That's a fantastic way of wording it.</br></br></br></br>   <br>Nothing new about anime's magical skirts.</br>  <br> &gt;A clone of what? <br>The standard children's movie plot progression.<br><br>If you were entertained for even a second during this episode, you have the mental capacity of a 5 year old. When you can literally predict every single scene, how is that not a derivative clone?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm trying to find the tweet, not this one, but Grant seemed to imply it's some sort of a personal project.</br>  <br> Patrick Robert Steward </br>  <br>finally some good news, maybe i will not kill myself afterall</br>  <br> Bambi Bunny <br><br>Thanks Disney for creating a generation of furfags.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The fundamentals of animation is still the same in both western/eastern cultures; that is to say, what they teach in american and japanese animation curriculums are wholly the same. You cant say its a cartoon just because it looks like a cartoon- when both are inherently the same fucking thing. Good examples of animation from either cultures would tend to reach a middle point, where they are indistinguishable from each other- apart from deliberate stylistic choices.</br></br>  <br>Stay strong, bro. We all have to hold out until we get mandy doujins.</br>  This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. But it's still anime.  <br> Grant seemed to imply it's some sort of a personal project <br>Probably some feature-length film with both 3D and 2D animation.</br></br>  <br><br>It really depends if the anime is echhi or not. If it's not echii, magical skirts are an automatic thing and you will never see what's underneath.</br></br>  <br>She's not getting brutally fucked by old men.</br>  <br>why does she look so familiar<br>also best witch</br></br>  <br>Just like Korra, amirite?<br><br><br>I don't know why you're making this about the animation. My whole argument stems from the fact that animation style doesn't make anime anime, otherwise Korra would be anime.<br><br>It's the thematic elements. The direction style. The utterly bland story telling.</br></br></br></br></br></br>     Total times episode has been viewed on Vimeo: 2,320 <br> Seeds on Horriblesubs: 3,034 </br>  Figures when?  kill la kill had me worried about lwa2 but its seems it turned out great.  <br>i was pissed at her being selfish and not apologizing to her two friends expecting everything to be okay once she finishes her damn project. The fuck kind of moral story is that ?<br><br>" It's okay if you fight with your friends even if you don't apologize as long as you do something cool they'll be your friends again. "</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, what sort of faggots bother seeding?</br>  <br>It's something you see constantly in western cartoons and children's movies.</br>  <br>When you say it's a clone you mean it's a clone of a specific work. But since you don't mean that, why are you calling it a clone? It isn't one. Using predictable, "standard" storytelling doesn't make it a clone of anything. There's also nothing wrong with being predictable. LWA2 is good because of the story's execution, the characters, the animation, the music and so on.<br><br>You're the type of person who always wants novelty for novelty's sake and who thinks the only thing that ever matters in any sort of fiction is the plot. And how novel it is. In short you're a moron.<br><br><br> The fundamentals of animation is still the same in both western/eastern cultures <br>Maybe at the most basic of basic levels, but beyond that they're nothing alike. And Western countries are hardly even producing hand-drawn animation anymore anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tezuka's bunny girl is 100x cuter though. Chances are Yoshinari would agree.</br>  <br>It's also something you constantly see... everywhere.</br>  <br>Tezuka was such a furfag...</br>  <br/>  So did this movie get a song this time?  <br><br><br>Nigga please, panty shot was a Ghibli classic, the anime doesn't have to be ecchi at all, look at this diabetes shit from Ghibli-wannabe.<br>Fuck Trigger for not giving me the due panties.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They do OST</br>  <br>Ghibli girls aren't sexualized.<br>It's ok to show their panties.</br></br>  I quite like how there's a lot of British details that aren't in your face, I mean besides Akko parachuting with the Union Flag. I wouldn't expect anyone from Japan to know what a Punch and Judy stand is.<br><br>I've noticed Jasmineka eating Kettle Chips, Walkers Crisps and Skips.</br></br>  <br> LWA2 is good because of the story's execution,  <br>Utterly formulaic, to an insane degree.<br> the characters, <br>Totally one dimensional, no real development.<br> the animation,  <br>Not as good as the movie, an insult for the money.<br> the music  <br>I can't remember a single track.<br><br>I liked LWA1. Not a huge amount, but I could see some value there. LWA2 was trash.<br><br>I'm very sorry that I'm over the age of 5, and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. Watching the same thing, over and over, that's what autists and children like. It really wouldn't have taken much. A single second that wasn't totally paint-by-numbers, and phoned in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. <br>How is this even particularly similar to Tiny Toons/Animaniacs/whatever, let alone "purely" that style?<br><br>Are you making the comparison because the animation reminds you of the TMS episodes of those shows? Those were animated in Japan, you know.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ghibli girls aren't sexualized. <br>Not with that attitude</br></br>  <br>Also, Shaun of the Dead</br>  tfw the west will never go back to doing hand drawn animation<br><br>Why must Japan be the only country left with an appreciation for animation? <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/yZibUpH-AME?t=5m22<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>france still draws their stuff I think.</br>  <br> and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. <br>So you don't watch anime at all?</br></br>  So glad I backed this.  <br>Face it, it'll never revive to its former glory days. If it weren't for the widespread popularity of manga and the otaku fanbase, Japan would have also stopped giving a shit about 2d animation.</br>  <br>Because the Japanese are the only ones who can draw so well in such a large scale.<br><br>The West is divided into too few individuals.<br>The 3D favoritism and "easy-way-out" Flash style animation isn't helping either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That shota's got a fat ass.</br>  <br>Tezuka was not involved with any incarnation of "furry fandom". Liking cute appealing cartoon design shouldn't amount to being associated with furry culture and "furry" is not a sexual orientation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The fuck are you all arguing about?

Really, I'm not that fussy about what constitutes "new", a slightly different mix of archetypes sat round a table is enough to make it fresh.<br><br>But LWA2?

Will die before he gets any saving done.</br>  <br>Showing the back is different from showing the front.</br>  I was kind of hoping lwa2 would look into making diana and akko friends but they still seem to maintain the status quo.  <br><br>A friend of mine spent some time as a kindergarten teacher. He showed them some animated films; the 5 year olds there called golden-age Disney stuff "badly drawn" and only liked 3DCG.<br><br>I used to think that such a thing couldn't happen and that 2D will remain inherently appealing, but....</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's really hot, to be honest. You can't even really notice the butt shot when watching it normally, but the fact that they included that small glimpse of Akko ass really gets me going.</br>  <br>Your obsession with labelling anyone who disagrees with you as a child gives the impression you're somewhat insecure in your own maturity. Not every plot has to be deeply intellectual, and adults can enjoy simple storylines too. I'd hazard a guess that not one person went into LWA2 expecting any ending other than Akko and team coming together to beat the bad guy, but that doesn't necessarily make the experience a bad one.</br>  <br>Good, good. In that case, yes. It's far better than KLK.</br>  <br> black void <br>Fix your monitor settings.</br></br>  <br> black void <br>It's just shading.</br></br>  <br>Surely you're not gonna say  isn't sexualized fanservice, right?</br>  <br>Good taste.</br>  What's with the dramatic brooding Batman-esque score over the end credits?  <br>you should have linked <br><br><br>He COULD say "oh no, they didn't mean it to be sexual" it if not for Trigger being obvious perverts, Yoshinari drawing official LWA art with a focus on Akko's butt and one of the animators drawing suggestive Akko x Sucy yuri.<br><br>They obviously want to give LWA a more innocent feeling but it's not like they don't want male nerds watching it. The manga ran in a seinen magazine.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty slow for a sticky if you ask me.</br>  <br> I'd hazard a guess that not one person went into LWA2 expecting any ending other than Akko and team coming together to beat the bad guy, but that doesn't necessarily make the experience a bad one. <br>You don't seem to get my point. When I watch some cute girls shit, I'm pretty confidant that at the end nothing will have really changed and we'll be back to the status quo.<br><br>In LWA2, EVERY SCENE is like that. I don't know if Chinatsu is going to pour herself some tea or not, but I can literally predict every single event in LWA2 with pinpoint accuracy. It's like watching something you've already seen, and know all the lines to.

If you were unfamiliar with that kind of stuff then I understand you missing it, but it's super Japanese and really blatant.</br>  There are VIDEOGAMES made out of MAGIC in this world, I need me some of that.  <br> then the teacher did the whole Japanese live stage thing where she calls things out for the audience. <br>no. that's not what she did. She was pretending that it was all part of the show.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's a bit dissapointing. At least it's still totally something you could show to your daughter.</br>  <br><br> trigger never release sheet music. <br><br>I guess I could transcribe it myself i guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what he said.</br>  <br>You are a pretentious poser. You want "innovative" stories and "deep" characters just so you can tell everyone you're engaged in profoundly intellectual artistic pursuits and not merely entertaining yourself like some commoner. It's all just an act, and your actual knowledge of and interest in movies/other fiction is skin deep.<br><br>Anyone who isn't a pretentious poser will tell you that while LWA2 doesn't have an original, unpredictable story is it nevertheless well-executed and entertaining for what it is. They would also realize that it isn't supposed to be some deep character study and psychological drama, and would hardly even have any time for that. The characters are likable not because of some childhood trauma, moral dilemma or philosophical babble but because of their basic characterization, design and animation. I don't know if Constantze even had any lines, but she's an immediately likable character.<br><br>And then there's the animation and presentation in general which are really nice too. But of course they don't have any "deep" "meaning" to them so who cares right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I enjoy my 3D anime with games and MMD videos, but when I watch shows entirely made out of animation, I expect drawn animation because I honestly see it as superior and more appealing.</br>  okay that shitty brat and his tomato hijinks better be a one time thing. Everything was going good till that pile of shit showed up. Trigger better leave this series as a girl only cast.

It's not like we get a sticky for other anime announcements? Some serious favoritism going on here.

Let me guess, you're one of the backers left in denial.<br><br>So you payed these retards 800 grand for a generic 30 minute sci-fi OVA, it's been a year with nothing but updates that say absolutely nothing but "w-we're working on it seriously guys!!", and not only that, one year after it's been funded the studios have split and half the staff replaced, so who knows where the fuck that money is or when that shitty OVA is coming. The production went to shit and you got played like a violin, congratulations.</br></br></br>  Absolutely inspired direction, every scene just flows so well and is so visually engrossing  <br>that's a shaft show, isn't it?</br>  <br>This<br>Who was the director? This whole thing was just incredibly well done.</br></br>  <br>Her character could have been replaced with a boulder, but she was cute, at least.</br>  <br><br>it was good. but also kinda clichee-laden. I wouldn't call it inspired. Just good execution of old recipes.</br></br>  <br>How the fuck did that shit raise 800 grand? At least with LWA2, people already liked LWA and saw that there was a competent staff behind it.</br>  It was kinda meh. Oh well, considering the budget they did alright.  <br>LWA is You Yoshinari's pet project, though obviously lots of people are responsible for the final result.</br>  <br>Mostly Hideo Kojima shilling for them (he was my boy before but he ain't my boy no more) and also they pandered to MAL and reddit fucking hard. They unironically spread the #keepanimealive hashtag.</br>  <br>you can take the most tired cliches ever and make them interesting/fun if you're talented enough, which this guy clearly is</br>  <br>Because they advertised it with some stupid "SAVE ANIME" shit, and all the people that don't watch anime ate it up.</br>  <br> You Yoshinari <br>Well that certainly explains it.</br></br>  Has this not been posted yet?  Had better animation than literally everything I've watched all year.  <br>Calm the fuck down, Diana.</br>  <br>The fuck does Kojima know about making anime? Fucking casuals.</br>  <br>there was a pony in LWA1 too. Although it was maggot-infested.</br>  <br>Just remember that we always have an Inferno Cop x LWA anime to look forward to.</br>  It was okay I guess.  fat-chan stole one of akko's hair  HAPPY TIME KEIKAKU  i want to sniff little witch butt.<br><br>and fuck whoever already posted the two pics i wanted to post.</br></br>  <br>heh pony</br>  <br>I'm not a even a backer. you sound more like a backer than I</br>  <br> people actually seeding </br>  <br>Remember back when people could put ponies in the rooms of little girls to show that they were into stereotypical little girl things?</br>  <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clito<wbr>cybe_nuda</wbr></br></br>  <br>Under the Dog was taking advantage of the whole "Anime is trash and cookie cutter" angle and some people went "Muh mature storytelling" and gave it dosh, but it was originally not going to make it's funding goal, but then a bunch of youtubers and bloggers decided to cram the kickstarter down our throats, and then a bunch of sheep donated to make the goal.</br>  <br>And what is she gonna do with it?</br>  <br> depending on a flaky connection for streamin <br>My stream was 10/10 with no interrupts or buffering.</br></br>  <br>Pls respond</br>  <br>Butt sniffing is easily my favorite fetish.

See you fags later.  Why does every single sticky inevitably turn into rampant shitposting about height?  I didn't even know this was a thing that was happening today. i am filled with joy and smiles.  <br>Because you're short.</br>  <br>Sucy didn't have that much detailed animation, she was just long.</br>  How the fuck has no one made and posted a webm of Amanda's heist scene to get the golden egg during her intro?  just finished it<br>people weren't joking about the fat ass being completely useless, what a fucking waste of a character</br>  <br>On it.</br>  Any working DL links?

I want to sniff Lotte's butthole.  <br>And this is a bad thing because?<br>It's an accurate representation of a fat person.</br></br>  What makes these characters so likable? Even discounting the quality of the animation, there's no amazing hook to it or anything, but somehow it's all just... really nice.  <br>This.<br> <br>I'm just so jaded from watching almost every kickstarter fail or be huge scams that even this one project that looked like a miracle spooked me. <br><br>Fuck, I want to give trigger money.</br></br></br></br></br>  Sound: http://webm.host/816d2/vid.webm<br>I'll do the others as well.</br>  <br> XD <br>Half-way there brah</br></br>  <br>well maybe not comic relief in the strictest sense<br><br>but kind of a character to freshen up a bit in story intensive scenes by showing her eating? i dunno she didn't feel that out of place for me</br></br></br>  <br> tonight /u/ </br>  <br>You just know she's the drug lord of the academy.</br>  Should of been more explosive like the first one.  <br>I want to intercrural or hotdog loli-Fujiko in her catsuit.</br>  <br>I like them because they're expressive. And when I say expressive, I mean the animators actually had the time and money to spend on moving their faces unlike in most anime where the faces are pretty much frozen, changing only once or twice in a closeup.</br>  <br>wait a sec...<br><br>is that rarity next to the clock??</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't notice her :3 face when I first watched it</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>she didn't feel forced I agree, but seriously she did absolutely nothing</br>  <br>The thing is Trigger = Startoons.<br><br>Trigger is not Telecom.</br></br></br>  I WANT TO RUB MY NOSE AGAINST AKKO'S BUTTHOLE  <br>Constanze.<br>Sound: http://webm.host/4a425/vid.webm</br></br>  <br>there was a twilight in the first one, remember?<br><br>it's just a slight  tip of the hat  towards the show</br></br></br>  <br>well if i think about it<br><br>she DID hand out candy at the parade which helped bringing the little kids around<br><br>nothing she as a character would have been absolutely needed for, but at least it's something eh?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She really was the star of this.</br>  <br>Her grumpiness pleases my german heart</br>  <br> HANDA <br>Hmm, I wonder who could have animated this scene...</br></br>  <br> her goggles are over her hat <br> she is watching through her hat and then through her goggles  <br><br>i didn't notice that when watching, cool</br></br></br></br>  <br>He slaved the fireworks in the first one</br>  <br> Sign says "Braunschbank" <br> VO says "Braunschbank" <br> Subs say "Braunschweig" <br><br>What is this?</br></br></br></br></br>  I didn't back it, but where can I by the BD?  <br>*slaved over<br><br>also did this bit</br></br></br>  <br>She was the cutest<br>My favorite by far.</br></br>    Saw the premier.

How about Heaven's Feel?  HF Shirou picks Gilgamesh and wields him as a weapon<br><br>then he dies</br></br>  <br>Epilogue Shirou could 1v1 Gil, Rin mentioned his body was stronger in most ways. <br><br>He probably retained a ton of Archer's experience from having his arm as well, much more than UBW Shirou absorbed.</br></br></br>  <br>Epilogue HF Shirou*</br>  Could Shiki kill Gil's weapons?  Fate Shirou didn't have control of his magic circuits. HF Shirou would have died if he activated his reality marble. Shirou could only fight off Gil in UBW because of his interactions with Archer and jackhammering Rin.  <br>No. <br>Shirou REQUIRES UBW to beat Gilgamesh. Fate Shirou can't do anything but defend and eventually die, HF Shirou would be able to keep up for all of three shots, burn out, and die on the spot.</br></br>  <br>Could UBW Shiro defeat F/Z Gil with Tohsaka as master?</br>  <br> Not trusting Nasu's Reality Marble (Asspull) to make Fate Shirou win <br>Seriously anon?</br></br>  UBW Shirou has the highest possibility to defeat Gilgamesh out of the three Shirou's to defeat him. The other two don't stand a chance really.  <br>How?</br>  <br>FateShirou cannot into replicating weapons and is just a dude with a sword he can't activate and a shield that loses to Ea. <br><br>HFShirou cannot UBW and dies if he projects more than thrice.</br></br></br>  Fate and HF Shirou do not have UBW and that's what they need to beat Gil.  <br>You NEED UBW.</br>  <br> Epilogue HF Shirou <br>That's the weakest Shirou though, can't even wield magic properly and needs Sakura to supply him so he doesn't stop working.</br></br>  <br>ufotable Gilgamesh?<br>Both of them could do it since ufotable Gil is dumb as fuck.<br><br>VN Gilgamesh?<br>Not likely.</br></br></br></br></br>  Is UBW Shirou the one that is mostly implied to have surpassed Archer?  <br>Fate Shirou?<br><br>Fighting Gil?</br></br></br>   mfw I'm currently on day 9 of the HF route, going through the F/SN VN completely for the first time <br>Still a while for me to go, /a/, wish me luck.</br>  <br> implied to have surpassed Archer? <br>No? Archer is skilled enough to beat other servants, Shirou literally said that he wouldn't be able to beat anyone but Gilgamesh.</br></br>  <br>At the moment, later in life Nasu said that UBW Shirou will surpass him,</br>  <br>Good luck fag.</br>  <br>Can't FateShirou replicate a perfect Avalon, one of the most powerful defensive NP's ?</br>  <br>Yeah but besides that he can't do anything to Gil.</br>  <br>He needs Saber and only Saber can use it.</br>  <br>He needs seiba mana to do anything with that and even than he cant exactly counteratttack</br>  What do the respective Shirous have:<br><br>Fate:<br> Saber <br> Caliburn <br> Avalon <br> Azoth Sword <br> Body Strengthening <br><br>UBW:<br> Unlimited Blade Works <br> Kanshou and Bakuya <br><br>HF:<br> Nine Lives Blade Works <br> Kanshou and Bakuya <br> an attached ticking time bomb </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Azoth sword <br>It's a dagger, you fucking casual.</br></br>  <br>HF Shirou has all the swords Archer saw during his life and UBW Shirou has a shitload of swords from Archer and Gil.</br>  <br>All Shirou's have body strengthening.</br>  <br> HF Shirou has all the swords Archer saw during his life <br>He doesn't, he needs to search inside the arm to get anything and that kills him so he limited that. UBW Shirou has more swords.</br></br>  <br> HF Shirou has all the swords Archer saw during his life <br>Reread HF.<br>He only has access to those he himself saw</br></br></br>  Repostin'...<br><br>Cu V EMIYA = Cu wins due to Protection from Arrows and EMIYA having no way to stop Gae Bolg HOWEVER EMIYA can potentially Caladbolg Cu from a long way away.<br>Cu V Gilgamesh = Gilgamesh wins due to Enkidu and probably sword spamming Cu to not let him Gae Bolg.<br>Cu V Medusa = Could go either way. Cybele should be able to immobilise Cu who needs to look at his target to Gae Bolg them.<br>Gilgamesh V Herakles = Enkidu holds down Herakles pretty damn well, and plus Herakles was protecting Ilya at the time.<br>Medusa V Herakles = I can't see Herakles losing.<br>Iskander V Herakles = Tough one. On the one hand, it's Herakles. On the other, Iskander might be able to kite him around the battlefield with his chariot while his army slowly whittles away Herakles' lives. Maybe.<br>Cu V Iskander = Could go either way. If Cu dodges and weaves in between Iskander's army to finally reach Iskander, he could then use his runes to 1v1 Iskander into a duel which Iskander would certainly lose. However, Iskander could simply use his chariot to kite Cu around the battlefield while his army takes Cu down. Cu might be able to theoretically defeat Iskander's army but eh. The problem is Iskander won't let Cu cast Gae Bolg even once, but Cu still has a fair chance.<br>Medusa V Iskander = Cybele. Nuff said.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A: He needs Saber around for it to do anything. <br>B: Ea can punch through Avalon. <br>C: FateShirou's only weapons are Caliburn and/or a dagger, he doesn't have anything to punch through the armor that Gilgamesh wears in the Fate route. Even if he does what Saber did and uses Avalon to get into melee, he can't do anything to Gilgamesh.</br></br></br>  <br>Why does Gil have armor in Fate but not UBW?</br>  <br>So you are literaly retarded?</br>  <br>Different 4th wars, Fate Gil didn't lose it.</br>  <br>He puts on armor when he thinks the opponent is worthwhile. In fate he fights against Saber which he deems a worthy foe. In Ubw i think he wears the armor against Hercules aswell but i am not sure</br>  <br>Plot hole.</br>  <br>Because otherwise he wouldn't have died.</br>  <br> In Ubw i think he wears the armor against Hercules aswell but i am not sure <br>he doesn't</br></br>  <br> B: Ea can punch through Avalon. <br>No it can't.</br></br>  <br>Because he needs to give a bit of a damn against Saber.</br>  <br>To represent his sense of self in the routes. Fate Gilgamesh is still very much like his Zero version, where is a king that lusts after Saber and wants to rule the world and have everything for himself.<br><br>UBW Gilgamesh has taken a liking to Kirei's idea to nuke the planet and so he doesn't give a shit about ruling everyone like a king, hence he doesn't feel the need to go around looking like a king all the time. Same reason Gil wears the tracksuit in HF as well as in UBW. In both of those routes, he doesn't give a shit about ruling everyone anymore (as much).</br></br></br>  <br>Because Gil is a Cocky son of a bitch<br><br>Which is the only reason he lost, actually</br></br></br>  <br>In UBW he lost it to the mud.</br>  <br>Your entire post is invalid on the reason that Fate Gil also wears human clothing.</br>  <br>Fate Shirou have shitty mana<br>And most magic circuits "closed"<br>And almost no combat experience<br><br>You may as well note that he can't project any other different weapon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Something with the mud eating it in UBW.</br>  <br>You mean at the beginning before he decides to actually get anything done? Yeah sure, that totally disproves my entire post, faggot.</br>  <br> Rin mentioned his body was stronger in most ways <br><br>That's just a puppet body that can function as a human body, it has no special characteristics whatsoever. (Except the fact that it gets refilled through sex)</br></br></br>  <br>And Shirou can't use magic properly on it. I guess that was Nasu's way of not making True too much of a happy ending.</br>  <br>Well he kinda failed because True is still so sacharine it gave me diabetes</br>  <br> track suit <br>I do not remember this.</br></br>  <br>That's true it was too happy for my taste.</br>  <br>Fate Shirou is the closest to EMIYA, so yes, he can beat Gilgamesh ... in the future.</br>   HF Shirou able to kill Gil <br><br>kek, he is literally retarded. Even after everything is done he is a doll who is mostly burned out. I am not even sure if even Fate shirou is stronger at this point</br></br>  <br>Oh, for fuck's sake, all this time it looked like a track suit to me. Well whatever you call this thing.</br>  <br>I guess he's around RN-Fate!Shirou.<br>The one who fed Saibah 1/3 of his circuits</br></br>  <br>He means the outfit. Black is ubw/hf, white is fate</br>  <br><br>No, Shirou was just accessing Archer's abilities when he was using Archer's arm. His mind could not retain any of the data he utilized because it was being erased constantly along with most of his memories. Don't think of Archer's arm as a part of Shirou. It's an Artificial Phantasm, a weapon that he loads and fires when necessary.</br></br>  <br>Apparently even if he is gimped with only 2/3 of his circuits he can use UBW after 20 years.</br>  <br> Iskander V Herakles = Tough one. On the one hand, it's Herakles. On the other, Iskander might be able to kite him around the battlefield with his chariot while his army slowly whittles away Herakles' lives. Maybe. <br>I doubt they have the strength or weapons to even draw blood.</br></br>  <br>This most of the war he was having some weird type of Alzheimers once he got the arm. It was the route in which both the main villain and hero had Alzheimers.</br>  <br> Medusa V Iskander = Cybele. Nuff said. <br>How many times must it said that Cybele is shit? Have you even read HF?</br></br>  <br>Only if she has the sheath of excalibur</br>  <br><br>A full power Ea blast could. It destroys everything in the radius, even Gaia's Supreme Reality Marble. Avalon is a dimension that is part of the supreme reality marble, so it could be destroyed along with everything else.</br></br>  <br>Right, he totally saw Caladbolg and Rho Aias!</br>  <br>Fairyland is not part of Gaia, it's something else entirely.</br>  <br> Even wolves can hurt Herakles. </br>  <br><br>Cybele is most certainly not shit, retard. It's a guaranteed victory against anyone who tries to fight you up close who doesn't have at least a B rank magic stat or some other form of magical protection like Cu's runes. Even then, it causes a reduction in stats in the opponent, which makes it exceptionally hard for them to fight Medusa. <br><br>The only reason she never uses it except in HF is because she's always holding back because she hates Shinji. If it's Sakura's safety on the line, she'll fight at 100%.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You will need a citation on that besides your full fanwank statement. Nasu has said that Avalon is untouchable so no.</br>  <br>Shit, messed up. Forget this retarded post</br>  <br>That is literaly wrong</br>  <br> dem legs <br>Holy hell<br>And Takeuchi still doesn't know how to draw male body</br></br></br>  <br><br>Herakles didn't have Godhand at that time, jesus christ, you people just never learn do you?</br></br>  <br><br>Who came up with this theory? Sounds like unconfirmed bs to me.</br></br>  <br>A full powered Ea can stopped by Rho Aias to such a degree that a regular human can survive it as shown in UBW. Avalon stops it completely.</br>  <br>In ideals not in power.</br>  <br>Why the fuck would he not have godhand?</br>  <br>It is shit when Shirou directly affected by it in the same hallway can move and get Rin out of the way. You need to be in a super close range and it needs time to freeze you. It's one of the most overhyped abilities on /a/ for literally no reason.</br>  <br>He did, they were just A-rank.</br>  <br> full-power <br>Anon pls.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Fairies are elementals of Gaia. They live in a part of the Supreme Reality Marble that nobody except fairies and those they favor can enter, like Saber. There are a lot of places like this in the world where Phantasmal Beasts live, but humanity has lost the ability to enter them over time. <br><br>Avalon cannot be defeated by any normal attack, but even a whole other dimension has no defense against an attack that reduces all to the most primal state, the same as Archetype Earth's most powerful attack.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rho Aias has never faced a full-powered Enuma Elish.</br>  <br>Fate Saber has an entire different story for what happened at the end of the 4th war. She explains how she lost to Gil there and that she fought him in a sea of flames. UFO linked UBW with Zero and in Zero Saber doesn't fight Gil at the end and he doesn't have his armor after being covered by the mud.</br>  <br>Nah it's the same ideal, he reached further because he had someone backing him.</br>  <br>It is unconfirmed bullshit. He most likely didn't wear it because he didn't fucking want to.</br>  <br><br>Because he didn't have enough prana to manifest it yet, he could barely move without Ilya being physically wounded by the prana strain it put on her. <br><br><br><br>Shut up, dumb nigger<br><br><br><br>Shirou was all the way down the hallway. Archer even had B rank magic but because he was unprepared for such an attack, his legs were immediately petrified and the rest of him was rapidly following suit. It's an attack that most Servants have zero defense against, and the moment the legs go a Servant can no longer even move and it's GG.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So basically all your wank. I rather believe Nasu than your contrived reason as to why full EA can now pierce Avalon.</br>  Would Herakles have been a stronger servant if he was summoned as Archer?<br>Would Medea have been a stronger servant if she was summoned as Rider?</br>  <br>I think he relies that in the VN the sprite is usually cut of at the torso and thus gives very low focus on them</br>  <br> Shirou was all the way down the hallway. <br>No he wasn't, the range of cybele is super short. Only Servants that would go full melee get affected and they have to be in her range of vision.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Tell me were it was stated not to be full power. Deal with it Gilfags, he strongest attack is worthless.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Q: About Herakles who was summoned as Berserker, it seems like he can become Saber or Archer. If he had been summoned in a different class, which class would it be that he could demonstrate his true power the most? <br><br> A: Surprisingly, it would be Archer. Archer is a ranger so it's a pretty comfortable class to someone like him who overcame many trials with knowledge and resourcefulness.  <br><br> Q: Why did the Einzbern summoned Hercules as a Berserker? I'd think that in some other classes, he'd be able to have access to skills and Noble Phantasms that he had originally had.... <br><br> A: Simple is POWER. Mayhap the Einzbern, who had been up until now been betrayed again and again, felt it safer to have a "loyal dog that'd do only what they told it to do". The aspect of Hercules as a regular Heroic Spirit would have many advantages in his own right, but on the other hand, there's also the possibility of some cooperative friction occurring with the Master because the heroic part of him is a bit too strong. That kind of Master and Servant combo is pretty frequent in Fate/Zero... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Shirou can defeat anyone in any route with the help of TAIGA, the true secret being Shirou's power  <br>Takeuchi doesn't know how to draw any body. I don't know why he keeps putting himself as the lead artist for their projects.</br>  <br>Cu would shit on Iskander so hard it's not even funny. A huge part of his myth is his ability to solo armies.<br><br>Iskander can totally beat Gil if he uses IH right on top of him.</br></br></br>  <br>He actually thinks he is a good artist.</br>  <br> Cu would shit on Iskander so hard it's not even funny <br>How?</br></br>  <br> Shirou was all the way down the hallway. <br>Nope he was pretty close by as he was getting kicked by Rider. Deal with it Cybele is mediocre, the only worthwhile thing Medusa has is Pegasus and her monster transformation.</br></br>  <br>Its some shitty headcanon by an anime-only fag, he's been trying to force it on /a/'s throats these past few days.</br>  <br>What else is Takeuchi going to do?</br>  <br>He would be gunned down by GoB regardless.</br>  <br><br>Iskander could only beat Gil if Gil doesn't know what IH is beforehand, and even then, the swordspam would still gravely wound him by the time he reaches Gil and drops his reality marble on him. <br><br>Unfortunately Iskander is a very arrogant and prideful man who does not hesitate to reveal his noble phantasms or his identity, especially when confronted with someone like Gilgamesh who is likewise unafraid to reveal his identity and power.</br></br></br></br>  <br> has not read any of Cu's legends </br>  <br> anime-only fag <br>I am directly quoting the VN you faggot.</br></br>  <br> by the time he reaches Gil <br>lol what? The range of Ionian Hetairoi is insane.

They sound super adorable.<br><br> jan <br> -chau/chatta <br> shi </br></br></br></br>  <br> Who was she hiding from behind the curtains? <br>she got a front row seat to  Yui and Kyouko's kissu practice session <br> that's why she's crying </br></br></br>  <br>Why would she be grabbing Ayano's knee when Akarin~'s spider leg is right there?</br>  <br>What's so wrong about it?</br>  <br>because they're in love</br>  <br>It looks  lewd </br>  <br>Probably, because it's not as if most of us speak enough to even notice.</br>  <br>no love can surpass the power of our  sensual  lord ~nirakA</br>  <br><br>Really? I mean I kind of do the same, the voices my head uses obviously aren't exactly spot-on but I have no trouble with them speaking English when I read. Sometimes it comes out as Engrish instead, but it works just the same.</br></br>  Post your face when you realize the reverse of Akkari~n is actually n~rika-a.  <br>Nana a best</br>  <br>How do you pronounce ~ ?</br>  <br>Long "n" sound, like nnn.</br>  <br>I can transfer some of the voices relatively well (Yui, Himawari and Chitose are easy) but Sakurako ends up sounding totally different in my head compared to her anime voice. More... raspy, or something. My brain just invented completely new voices for Akari and Chinatsu and half-new half-anime voices for Kyouko and Ayano.</br>  <br>I pretty much either imagine them talking gibberish in Japanese while comprehending the text, or mentally replace certain lines with commonly known Japanese phrases.<br><br>Hard to answer regarding the former because if I'm conscious about it, the immersion is ruined and I hear them unrealistically speaking English. As for the latter, Kyouko's genki voice stands out the most., as well as Akari's.</br></br></br>      <br>More spider Akaris!</br>  <br>No ehehe-ing allowed</br>    <br>You can't tell me what to do!</br>  How do you write Akari's wow in japanese? The waih~ thing.  <br>Waai~</br>  <br>Wait, you people actually sound out everything you read in a suitable voice? How long does it take you to read a manga chapter? I just read it without even consciously pronouncing the words.</br>  <br>You don't? What the fuck is wrong with you?</br>  <br> You people <br>No, it's probably just me.<br>I do it for immersion purposes, which is also kind of weird because I now have Yurus speaking Engrish, but it's a worthwhile tradeoff.<br>It doesn't take long, still maybe a minute tops, a few minutes for the longer chapters.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I read everything aloud and follow the words with my finger.</br>  <br>I don't do it consciously, it just happens<br><br>Go to bed, Sakurako</br></br></br>  <br>It's one of those things that you never really think about so it's difficult to explain, but I've always unconsciously created voices for characters in books/manga/etc. I didn't even realize I was doing it for Yuru Yuri until this thread, but it's easier since I saw the anime before reading the manga so the voices were already there.<br><br>I remember when WataMote came out something about it instantly bothered me, and it took ages to realize that the thing that was bothering me was that Tomoko's anime voice sounded nothing like the one I'd made for her.<br><br>Surely you must hear a voice when you read anything? Even reading this thread, you must hear the words as you read them. I'm just doing it in my own voice - or at least how my own voice sounds to me.</br></br></br></br></br>  Most people sound out words while reading, some go so far as to imagine a character's voice while doing so.<br><br>One of the first things you do when you learn how to speed read is consciously suppress this inner voice and read only with your eyes. This is a useful skill to have when reading informative text, but I personally don't use it while reading things for leisure, as I feel it takes away from the literature itself.</br></br>  <br> I remember when WataMote came out something about it instantly bothered me, and it took ages to realize that the thing that was bothering me was that Tomoko's anime voice sounded nothing like the one I'd made for her. <br><br>That was exactly the case for me. He voice was way off what I'd imagine it to be like.</br></br></br>  <br>Try and make me, booby monster!</br>   Not taking the extra few seconds so that you can actually mentally hear Akari's 'ehehe' in it's full glory   <br>For more information about this, check out spreeder.com , you might learn something you didn't know anon.</br>  <br>til I always speed read</br>    <br>I think that nearly gave me a fucking seizure though.  Not even exaggerating. </br>  <br>I still had the voice at 300 WPM.</br>  <br>No, I just look at the words. Sounding out the words mentally is useless and just slows you down.</br>  <br>What if you talk really fast, and so you can also read really fast with your inner voice?</br>  <br>but it's not as cute</br>  Chinatsu is love and Akari loves her.  <br>As a friend yes?</br>  This is one excellent Yuru Yuri related conversation you guys are having.  <br>How do you hear emotion in the words then? Like, the Kyouko you put with your message made me read it in a smug tone.<br><br>H-how do you do the c-cute s-stuttering that everyone does in these threads too? That needs to be mentally sounded out to work.</br></br></br>  <br>A  really good  friend.</br>  <br>1000wpm looks so artsy</br>  <br>isn't that obvious?<br><br>It's pretty related, and discussion is fun!</br></br></br>  <br>I don't.

Also, the sad truth is that if I really were a lazy lesbian, I'd probably be the most like Chizuru.

That shit was curazy.<br><br>You guys wanna talk about great animation?</br></br></br></br>  <br> I think Jin-Roh is the better <br>My English isn't very good but I think there is something wrong with that part of the sentence</br></br>  <br>I think you're a baka gaijinn :^)<br><br>Jokes aside, are there seriously no-one here who wants to discuss art?</br></br></br>  <br>  7 YEARS  </br>  <br>i liked jin-roh but why is it more complicated than red line?<br>as far as i remember the story was just a basic spy drama with references to red riding hood wich are in your face <br>the manga was a better since it wasnt about a character instead they focused in the jin-roh force itself</br></br></br>  <br>As you said, redline barely has a story so it doesn't leave much to discuss, especially after such a long time since it came out<br>The art IS gorgeous though.</br></br>  <br>Reddit, we did that many years ago.</br>  The problem with Redline's story is that it was made over 7 years, so a lot of the plot threads they were working on either didn't go anywhere, or were just kind of flat in their final execution.  <br>This is my thread now, and we'll talk about how good Redline's OST was<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Fmq<wbr>Hs_6VSzQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>There's no "problem" there. In Redline the story is only setting up the stage for the animation. It's serving its purpose decently enough but it isn't the focus - the animation is and oh holy moley, the animation is absolutely fabulous.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but it's a shame for all this fun setup to not be used. For example, I remember a deleted scene where the two girl's car turned into a robot.</br>  <br> I remember a deleted scene where the two girl's car turned into a robot. <br>That was in the promo vid that they made for Redline.</br></br>  <br>Having good animation does not excuse a poor story line, especially when they had seven years.</br>   [HorribleSubs] Working!!! - 01 [720p].mkv <br>„ÅÑ„Çâ„Å£„Åó„ÇÉ„ÅÑ„Åæ„ÅõÔªøÔºÅÔªøÔºÅ</br>  <br>AOTS is here</br>  Time for YAMADA.

Go through a couple of managers who can't do shit right. Boss asks me to help her with orders since I know about equipment and how to manage stock. Eventually get manager position because Boss trusts me.

It gives it a really eerie feel.  <br>Shadows of the poles and building/balconies don't match.</br>  <br>Look at Eva.<br>Episode 4 was a massive budget saving episode and it's the best of the series.</br></br>  <br> &gt;KyoAni gets shat on for using photos as background reference <br>You mean kyoanus using real photos as backgrounds, and over using the fuck out of blur.</br></br>  <br>Because here it's an artistic choice and it kinda does what it should do, while in Hibike it's just laziness.</br>  <br>You answered your question.</br>  <br>And don't forgot the terrible usage of bloom.</br>  <br>That's the reason I picked it up.</br>  <br>Cos SHAFT is lazy to draw background characters<br><br>In the past people would draw them but they would turn out shitty looking and lazily drawn. The trend lately is to have cutouts or whatever shit "representing" background characters. <br><br>Here's a screenshot of the background characters from Pani Poni Dash which was made by SHAFT.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is, he did a lot of the stuff for madoka. IIRC he was even responsible for the witch designs.</br>  <br>Pani Poni Dash was a joke series.</br>  <br> he <br>They. It's two guys.<br><br>https://wiki.puella-magi.net/Gekida<wbr>n_Inu_Curry</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>So is monogatari</br>  <br>Didn't bake start the trend of doing that or was it around before?</br>  <br>Are you fucking serious nigger?<br>Every single day I see some 16 year olds DEEPfags discussing their saviour of anime, bakamonogatari, hailing it as the greatest work of our time praising shaft as the saviour of anime, just like kyoanifags.<br>Dont fucking think for a second SHAFTfags are any better.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually all you see people posting in *monogatari threads is "x is best girl"</br>  <br><br>No one can top KyoAni's background waifus</br></br>  <br> Every single day <br>Fuck off</br></br>  <br>WebM format was created for a reason dude</br>  <br>SZS had background characters. It's mostly a monogatari thing</br>  <br>Say that again to my face not online and see what happens</br>  <br>You don't even lurk monogatari threads do you? All you see is waifufaggotry and muh kaiki is best girl</br>  <br>I would say it's because SZS is a manga adaptation</br>  <br>I mean the trend of just having cutouts or no background characters at all. Where did it start?<br>After bake I see it popping up here and there.</br></br>  <br>Kaiki is pretty great though. He has a great attitude.</br>  <br>I personally think there is nothing wrong with using photos in anime. I kinda like it even.</br>  <br>Hidamari</br>  <br>Even Lain did it dude</br>  <br>I wonder how will shaft adapt the Ougi Formula arc</br>  <br>I don't mean occasionally doing it, there were plenty of background characters show in lain.</br>  <br>The walk to school was devoid of background characters to make it eerie</br>  <br>Lain did it on purpose. Bake just feels like they were just saving budget.</br>  <br>Because they were, but in the end, it turned out all right</br>  <br>They were. Before Bake they never had a hit show</br>  <br>SHAFT also did it on purpose.<br>They needed to save money but it was a solution that fit.</br></br>  <br>How do I achieve the same level of ottermode perfection and wordplay mastery as Churaragi?</br>  <br>It's scary how close bake came to a complete flop.<br>Actually I still don't know how it didn't with what aired for it.</br></br>  <br> It's scary how close bake came to a complete flop. <br>I don't think anyone expected it to sell over 20k considering it was made by shaft. How did Bake even manage to sell over 70k?</br></br>  <br>Because of snail is how</br>  <br>I blame monkey.<br>She must have done something with that paw.</br></br>  <br> How did Bake even manage to sell over 70k? <br>Preying on a fanbase of morons who cosiders themselves brilliant, just misunderstood by their peers in real life.<br>Its a brilliant move, making the stupid feel clever to raise the sales.</br></br></br>  <br> Every single day <br>No you don't.</br></br>  <br>Nisio is kind of a big deal. Bakemonogatari was already a wildly popular LN series when Shaft made the anime.<br><br>This like asking how the Harry Potter movies became some of the best grossing movies of all time.</br></br></br>  <br>anon please</br>  <br>you've never watched any Monogatari, have you?</br>  <br>SAO and Mahouka are far more popular LNs and they didn't achieve Bake's sales</br>  <br>Yeah but Harry Potter didn't get butchered when they aired.</br>  <br>Yeah they managed to fit a several hundred page book entirely in a ~120 minute film. Oh wait they actually cut a lot of shit out, including beloved recurring characters (RIP Peeves).</br>  <br><br>What do you mean? People have been complaining about how butchered the Harry Potter movies are compared to the books for over a decade</br></br>  Bakemonogatari success is honestly a complete mystery for me unlike Madoka who had a bunch of heavyweight names behind it and plenty of glorious Aniplex marketing.  <br><br>I'm talking about presentation quality, not how well it was adapted. And specifically the first few movies.<br><br>And bookfags are fucking cancer, they will bitch about literally any adaptation.</br></br></br></br>  <br> SAO and Mahouka are far more popular LNs <br>At the moment.</br></br>  <br>Because Madoka wasn't fun. Bake was.</br>  <br>He's not saying Madoka isn't popular you idiot.<br>He's saying Bake shouldn't have gotten popular but it did.</br></br>  <br>oh you mean the fanservice. silly anon</br>  <br>Because Madoka and Monogatari are masterpieces and everything Kyoanus produces is just SoL moe-shit to be gobbled up by plebians.</br>  <br>Noone said anything about quality.<br>They made a fuckton of money, thats all that matters in Hollywood.<br>Noone gives a fuck about some underground movie that makes zero money, but is godtier.<br>They want more spiderman bullshit, cus that shit sells, no matter how shit it is.</br></br></br></br>  <br> They made a fuckton of money, thats all that matters in Hollywood. <br>that's all what matters in the anime industry too anon</br></br>  <br> He's saying Bake shouldn't have gotten popular but it did. <br>This kind of autism has always fascinated me. It takes a really special kind of entitled fan to decide what "deserves" to be popular and what doesn't.</br></br>  <br>I would pay my fortune to wash crab's crabs.</br>  <br>Hyouka was good.</br>  <br>*that</br>  <br>That starry ending.</br>  <br>Are you retarded? Have you seen the aired version of bake? <br>This isn't some sekreet club shit.</br></br>  <br>So like $47.58?</br>  <br>SHAFT can't into consistency with their models.<br><br><br><br><br><br>I've asked this before and I'll ask it again: How can people take this studio seriously when they show zero interest in the shows they make? Like dude at least they could care a little, instead of focusing on making cash. Seriously, how can people really think they are the best studio?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes I have, it was still an engaging and entertaining anime. Furthermore Shaft always teases their BD releases and people knew they were fixing scenes. <br><br>This might surprise you but not everybody suffers from autism like you, they don't find animation errors and wonky art totally unacceptable.</br></br></br>  <br>to be fair nips loved the araragi/hitagi shenanigans</br>  <br>We get it, you really hate Shaft because they are popular even though they totally fail your arbitrary test of merit.</br>  <br>Animations reasons. Also, it's a reference to the LN from how Koyomi doesn't "see" regular people, he's a classic loner</br>  <br> That picture <br><br>That's low, Shaft making fun of Hibike?</br></br></br>   mfw I still remember kyonifags getting buttmad about bake outselling k-on   <br>I only have worthless yuro money.</br>  <br>I hate that people praise them for their visuals when they do this like those posts I quoted. Really zero merit for doing shit like that.</br>  <br>what about the other girls? are they also loners?</br>  <br>whats this</br>  <br>Koufuku Graffiti TV version on the left, BD version on the right.</br>  <br>Except shinbo's directing is amazing and fresh. <br>And you are just mad people like what you don't.</br></br>  <br>Two reasons<br>1. Budget constraints in bake forced shaft to get really creative in how they did things, and they just kept the abstraction after Shaft got big<br>2. Its part of one of the creative decisions; everything is from the storytellers perspective,(usually Araragi's) the books read like Araragi is retelling the story to the reader. Araragi doesn't even see someone unless he's interested in them. So from his perspective the city appears empty except for him and the people he likes.</br></br></br>  <br>Why did they think it was a good idea to alter that scene like that?</br>  <br>Shinbo's direction is just gimmicky.<br><br><br>SHAFT</br></br></br></br>  Not Shaft but can someone tell me what the fuck happened to the shadow marked in purple, and why is Kumiko's and Reina's shadow darker than the shadows of the chairs?<br><br>My autism can't take this.</br></br>  <br>I don't remember that. I remember KyoAnus lickers like myself committing sudoku when E8 was airing while SHAFT was getting new fans with Bake. The Shaft x KyoAni war didn't officially start until Madoka.</br>  <br> i don't like it so I'll call it gimmicky  <br>That word means absolutely nothing</br></br>  <br>How do you even function on a daily basis?</br>  <br>Characters' shadows were drawn on cells, the rest are painted into the background. They overlapped. It wouldn't happen like that in real life. You can see they kinda tried to make the shades match but the difference is still visible.<br><br><br>Not like it matters since KyoAni's mean sales are so much higher. If you sum their shows' average sales, they're very close despite Shaft having like 65 shows and KyoAni having like 22, so basically a third of Shaft's shows.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Shaft is being  edgy  on purpose.</br>  <br>I went back a few seconds because I missed a sentence in the subtitles and happened to notice it.<br><br><br>Makes sense, but what about the light from the window?</br></br></br></br>  <br> center the shot <br> shoot it from straight ahead or directly on the side <br> make it either a really far shot or a really close shot <br> fuck the rule of thirds <br> if the background is boring, draw Africa <br> if there's a chance for the characters to make uncanny faces, take it <br> make sure the lighting is heavy, no matter what the source is. <br> you are allowed to use birds eye view angles if it makes the scene more unsettling <br><br>and you have every Shinbo show ever.<br><br><br> but what about the light from the window? <br>what about it? seems like a minor mistake to me</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they painted it over a picture, changed the window shape but didn't change the shadow shape<br><br>Kumiko and Reina's shadows are alright I guess, a shadow projected over a shdow will aways be darker</br></br></br>  <br>How is any of that bad?<br>There is a style and flow to the scenes which is unique, fits the show well and looks good.<br><br>What the fuck are you bitching about?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bird is majestic with long hair</br>  <br>Where can I order my own Gatari-in-a-box?</br>  <br>Long hair best hair</br>  <br><br>actually Nadeko Snake is the arc that sold the most</br></br>  <br> fuck the rule of thirds <br><br>Well, honestly, using the rule of thirds all the time makes for a rather boring composition. You need to break convention sometimes.</br></br></br>  <br>those are too many to call it a gimmick</br>  <br>makes sense to me<br>it aired when it was about 50% complete</br></br>  <br>Probably because the aired version was so horribly butchered people wanted to see what it should have actually looked like with an actual budget.<br><br>Or maybe they just wanted to see more monkey and so I'm still right.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe that's why.</br>  <br>Hey autistic anon, can you upload your Fish Bait images for me somewhere? They are so funny haha. :)</br>  <br>It's bad because it shows that Shinbo doesn't think much about the material and instead just uses the style that worked best for his wallet with Bake. This isn't having a director, this is having a signature that will sell more copies.<br><br>A director should work on giving soul and unique fitting styles and atmospheres to shows, not using his own one-trick pony style that gave Aniplex the most cash. Shinbo's direction might've been good before he started using the same style for everything, but now it's just a gimmick. Not only his direction choices but Shinbo himself is a gimmick.</br></br></br>  <br>how much did each bake arc sell?</br>  <br>Except it's not. His style maybe similar from show to show but it's not the same. It does have a unique look. You can post a screenshot of monogatari and I will instantly recognize it from the thumbnail. The visual style and palette is very distinct.</br>    <br>Spoken like a true ignoramus. Shinbo did not direct Bake. The only auteur he's ever produced, Oishi Tatsuya did. Shinbo hasn't actually directed a series since Moon Phase.</br>  <br>This only supports what I said about Shinbo being just a signature to bring it more cash.</br>  <br>Found this but still don't understand what's going on</br>    <br>I agree it fits Bake style very well but you can't say the same about the rest of SHAFT shows that are nothing more than flops. I was specially fan of Vampire Bund and Soremachi and they took away what make them good in their own right, then inserted the bake template and your average SHAFT approved inside jokes and neck tilts.</br>  <br>Yes, he lists himself as director of every series Shat makes for marketing purposes. He's also stated that his primary goal when making an anime is to make an anime that sells. Just because he wants to make a living doesn't mean his style or the styles his pupils have adopted are bad.</br>  <br>Got any source for that because every site I visit lists Shinbo as director.</br>  <br>‚óãÂåñÁâ©Ë™û „ÄêÂÖ®6Â∑ª„Äë<br>01Â∑ª„ÄÄ15,513(29,372)„ÄÄ19,103(37,251)„ÄÄ2<wbr>4,755(58,048)„ÄÄ09.09.30 ‚ÄªÂêàË®à 82,803Êûö<br>02Â∑ª„ÄÄ18,731(38,973)„ÄÄ20,752(42,655)„ÄÄ2<wbr>2,557(53,396)„ÄÄ09.10.28 ‚ÄªÂêàË®à 75,953Êûö<br>03Â∑ª„ÄÄ18,607(41,319)„ÄÄ20,317(43,409)„ÄÄ2<wbr>0,901(52,135)„ÄÄ09.11.25 ‚ÄªÂêàË®à 73,036Êûö<br> 04Â∑ª„ÄÄ22,363(48,105)„ÄÄ23,918(49,937)„ÄÄ<wbr>26,058(57,909)„ÄÄ10.01.27 ‚ÄªÂêàË®à 83,967Êûö</wbr> <br>05Â∑ª„ÄÄ19,804(46,317)„ÄÄ21,716(48,631)„ÄÄ2<wbr>2,698(53,844)„ÄÄ10.02.24 ‚ÄªÂêàË®à 76,542Êûö<br>06Â∑ª„ÄÄ21,066(51,141)„ÄÄ22,576(54,016)„ÄÄ2<wbr>3,749(55,978)„ÄÄ10.07.28 ‚ÄªÂêàË®à 79,727Êûö</wbr></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Nice find anon.

Hi last decent directing work was Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei.</br></br>  <br> How can he afford to buy porno mags when the internet exists? <br>isn't that a japanese thing? still buying porn mags</br></br>  <br>Araragi is a man of many fetishes, I doubt he'd be able to contain all his magazines without people stumbling upon them. <br>He should just know better and use the internet. TOKYO METRO DOESN'T EXTEND TO THE INTERNET!</br></br>  <br>Maybe he isn't buying porn mags. Maybe he's buying doujins. There's an entire sub-industry regarding doujins right?</br>  <br>We know he's buying porn mags though. <br><br>Kanbaru mentions it, Araragi mentions it, Tsukihi mentions it and Nadeko finds them in Otori.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if he took his porn collection + hanekawa's undies with him when he moved out with Crab</br>  <br>You know Senjougahara took the underwear. That fiend. <br><br>She probably rehashed Epsiode 12 and told him that the things she's going to do to him is going to make his porno mags look like the bible.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know man, his porno mags are pretty crazy.</br>  <br>The bible, man. <br><br>You think Kanbaru is perverted?

Thanks.</br>  <br>Really now?<br><br>What's more perverted. Sexual shit in the back of a car with your father driving OR throwing your spaghetti all over the floor when a girl gives you a kiss on the cheek?<br><br>Kanbaru is only perverted around Araragi and when they're alone. <br>Senjougahara is the true freak, being perverted in front of her father.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think this is from the commentary.</br>  <br>When will they learn?</br>  <br>But how can that count anon? She wants to fuck her father. Being lewd in front of him is no problem.</br>  <br>Her Electra complex proves she's the bigger freak. <br><br>Until I see Kanbaru wanting to fuck Izuko or Tooe, that automatically puts Senjougahara and Araragi as bigger perverts. <br><br>The fact pic related happened in Hana during the final bantz scene is evidence enough that Araragi has surpassed Kanbaru.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well apparently Tooe is like Araragi and monkey wants to fuck Araragi so there's that. <br><br>Besides it's not fair bringing Araragi into this, he has matured as the perverted master, this is about crab.</br></br></br>  <br> The fact pic related happened in Hana during the final bantz scene is evidence enough that Araragi has surpassed Kanbaru. <br>I think that has to do more with monkey's being the pov character. Also she was feeling slightly blue due to the recent events with numachi .</br></br>  <br>Crab &gt; Araragi. <br><br>Crab just seems less perverted because she can keep her business in order but to have spoiled Kanbaru and outdo Araragi shows she is top-tier pervert.</br></br></br>  <br>Bake araragi maybe, not post nise and especially hana araragi.</br>  <br> Should I be worried about Karen.  <br><br>Even if she was a bit blue, the fact she needs to worry about Karen at all shows Araragi is greater than Kanbaru.</br></br></br>  <br>Well shit, Devil.

I have had to fill it at least twice every time in the last week.</br>  So, their abilities must be related to something wrong with their lives, kind of like the witches in Yamada-kun?  <br>Did you even watch the episode?</br>  <br>It's literally mentioned within the first 2 minutes it only lasts for 5 seconds.<br><br><br>After how PA Works + Maeda did last time round, doubts are understandable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>lighting up our hearts since ep 1</br>  <br>Switch to legacy then.

MC is really Kanye-like.<br><br>But only 13 episodes huh, I'm kinda worry Maeda can't deliver the story with such short episodes.</br></br>  <br> Charlotte <br>Jhonathan!</br></br>  <br>I thought the same.</br>  Trashy garbage. Far too anime to be good.  <br> far too anime to be good <br>/a/: the post</br></br>  <br> Far too anime to be good. <br><br>0/10</br></br></br>  <br>I hated Kanie too. It's not about how mc uses his powers. It's his attitude that pisses me off.<br><br>Also wtf captcha why are you showing me pictures of dead insects.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Remember to ignore bait.</br></br>  GOTTA GO FAST  <br> likable <br>Sure, at that 90chapters in 12 episodes pace, you don't get a chance to even know, let alone dislike them.<br>We're one fucking episode in, save your judgements. Some characters haven't even been introduced yet.</br></br></br>  <br>Is it becuase you can't self insert into an MC thtat isn't an outright loser deadbeat?</br>  <br> falling for obvious bait <br>Clearly you haven't been around long enough.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Edgiest picture I've seen in a while</br>  <br> Far too anime to be good. </br>  <br> Far too anime to be good. </br>  <br>He's doomed to be the friend of the MC who watches him get all the girls, isn't he?</br>  <br>Self inserting is for faggots.</br>  <br> tfw his power sucks <br> no scene like this </br></br>  I don't really like the MC, but I like how the anime is going so far.   Teleportation with momentum <br><br>GOAT power + handicap</br></br>  The main heroine is such a moralfag. The only entertaining characters are the lead to an extent the imouto, though her genki levels are almost irritating.  <br>But he's slightly cooler than Sunohara</br>    <br> He has a gift, is it not his responsibility to use it? <br>No it's not. It's called "power abuse". That's why he got figured and fucked at the end. Shit MC.</br></br>  <br> momentum <br>He's clearly just chuuni and it's super speed.</br></br>  <br> not self inserting as little girl <br>Are you a faggot?</br></br>  So  which character has the KEY aids?   <br>Imouto. Calling it now</br>  <br> the imouto <br> or the big brother that died long ago </br></br>  <br>The sister</br>  <br>Imouto, who else?</br>  What's the deal with "the" Uncle?  The imouto was annoying as shit. It sucks that she's obviously just there to be all uguu and genki to gradually catch AIDS and finally consumate her role by being the cheap tears and muh feels bait. God, why do I even bother with Key anime.  <br> Far too anime to be good. </br>  Just from the screenshots I'm pretty sure I won't like it.  <br><br><br><br>Please no</br></br></br></br>  <br>Key MCs can't have parents or decent guardians</br>  How do we fix Charlotte?    <br>I second that. It's extremely annoying when she go with her forced DESU DESU act.</br>   MC is a pushover  <br> Tomori is a bitch <br><br>Already dropped. I hate this trope and it's sad that he'll probably fall in love with him.</br></br></br>  <br> Kanon </br>  <br>Give   more screentime</br>   Show is called Charlotte <br> No character named Charlotte <br><br>I'm just going to keep calling the main girl Charlotte tbh</br></br></br>  <br>EPIC POST</br>  Fucking great opening episode. The MC is hilarious and the other two characters compliment him well. Even the sister is great and I usually hate imoutos.  <br>Charlotte is the meteor at the start of the show.</br>  <br>You have literally no idea what natural selection is</br>  <br>Make an vn first then adapt it to anime.</br>  <br> I usually hate imoutos. </br>  <br>Please kill yourself. At least try to watch the episode. Just to inform the thread, you obviously didn't watch with your brain turned on as you didn't see Yuu run away because if he tried to use his power they could've just tied his body up, as there were two opponents who knew his weakness. One of them moved at super speed and literally flung him 50 feet into the air and into a river, after which Tomori turned invisible and beat the shit out of him. Try to explain yourself out of how he could've resisted.</br>  <br>My favorite post this thread.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127589526 <br> This is exactly how I see weeaboo, neckbeards acting with this kind of ability. <br><br>Which is why people hate the MC, they can't self insert into something they already are and are trying to escape</br></br></br>  Which one, /a/?  Best girl next episode?  <br>I ship them.</br>  <br><br>Top has the better ability.</br></br>  <br>Best girl coming through.</br>  <br>Actually he will be the first one to fall in love with her</br>  <br>Yahallo?</br>  <br>What's up with all the guys lately having the exact same hair. It doesn't help that they all wear uniforms too</br>  <br> he'll probably fall in love with him </br>  Man, the mc is a dick. He pretty much caused that driver to lose his job.  <br>Holy fuck, you mean twins that don't have purple hair? Well, that's a shocker for Maeda.</br>  <br><br>You kill yourself, you fucking cockroach. Infact, I'll do it for you since you want to be edgy. The MC is a pushover because he didn't refuse the offer and bended over to some creepy stalker and didn't even land one punch.</br></br>  The 'it's going to start slowly' warnings had me worried, but this was a great episode. <br>I look forward to more.<br>I want to fuck Tomori.</br></br>  <br>Kanye has better personality.</br>  god-tier first episode<br><br><a href="https://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1436037926023.webm" target="_blank">https://i.4cdn.org/wsg/143603792602<wbr>3.webm</wbr></a></br></br>  Don't know why people are bitching about this guy. I thought it was funny and way more refreshing that your average male lead.  <br>Is this going to be like the idol girl from Mekakucity Actors?</br>  <br>MC not even thinking. He could have died or failed to save the girl. What a fucking chuuni.</br>  <br>Just because he's different doesn't mean his personality isn't trash.</br>  <br> landing a punch on a guy with super speed and someone who can turn invisible </br>  <br>Maybe you missed the fact that Hoshinoumi is clearly run by the government, and forced them to transfer. They also got his guardian's approval, as he's only 15 and therefore a minor. Good cockroach insult, though. Kept it Key related.</br>  <br>0/10 Bait. You didn't even watch the fucking episode.<br>Pic related is somehow edgy.<br><br><br>Looks like he might hook up with the blonde idol.<br><br><br> power abuse <br>There's a fine line between that and just using it for one's benefit.<br><br><br>Looks like the main heroine will catch it, judging by the first PV.<br><br><br>Maeda called him imperfect character to sympathize with, so he should get plenty of development.<br><br><br>Her ability is apparently fire.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Both the purple twins are Itaru girls, Na-ga did Charlotte.</br>  Why do people not watch shows because of a character's morality? Characters have their traits for a reason and the show is meant to use these traits, a show isn't worse because its MC is immoral, a show is worse because it doesn't use that immorality effectively.  <br><br>I belive people don't have a problem with the MC himself, their problem lies with the cast that will bring him down to be another run off the mill muh morals MC.</br></br>  <br>Yeah fam I'm reppin</br>  <br>What about him offends you? His over the top "I'm the shit" attitude was mostly done for comedic effect. How are people missing this? Autism?</br>  <br>Fuck off, Maeda.</br>  <br> that music </br>  <br><br>And I give a fuck? One punch is all I need no matter how injured I get. I'm tired of anime girls being overpowering.<br><br><br><br>It would have been better if he refused</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Underrated post</br>  <br> ep 1 over <br> best girl already gone FOREVER <br><br>Fucking dropped.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks only average, nothing close to something like Kyoani/Ufotable work. But then again, it's PA Works.</br>  <br/>  <br>I agree with you completely, that's ridiculous. For example I hated Lelouch's hypocrisy but that didn't make the show any less enjoyable, if anything it made the ending more so.</br>  <br>PA Works shows look better than Ufotable shows you blind cunt.</br>  <br><br>She's fucking invisible. What the hell do you think you can do?</br></br>   The MC is edgy because he isn't a huge moralfag   <br> replying to the most obvious fucking bait <br>Did you not see the s on the end of anime? <br>It's was so obvious it hurts.<br><br><br> refused <br>So he gets expelled and his high school education ruined? He had no other choice really. Lets not forget they wouldn't let him back into that school without passing the test. They even made his uncle sign the transfer papers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Worse than Glaslip.  The MC is basically a deconstruction of a harem lead.<br><br> Not a moralfag but a complete trashbag <br> Good looking not just average looking <br> doesn't bait girls that like him into a harem but immediately rejects them <br> Gets rejected by the girl he wanted in the first episode <br> Imotou doesn't want his dick and gets immediately attached to the first girl he brings home <br> falls for lead girl first but gets treated like garbage by her <br><br>I can see how he is insertfags' worse nightmare</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon it's possible to make a non-edgy character who isn't a moralfag<br><br>This anime didn't do it</br></br></br>  <br><br>There's a difference between being a Bible-humping moralfag and downright being criminal. This MC committed multiple felonies and doesn't seem to give a shit.</br></br>  <br> Looks like he might hook up with the blonde idol. <br><br>Would be good but I doubt it.</br></br></br>  <a href="https://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1436038475503.webm" target="_blank">https://i.4cdn.org/wsg/143603847550<wbr>3.webm</wbr></a>  <br>More like Good-bad-meh-bad-meh-Good</br>  Imouto please have superpowers, Imouto please have superpowers.<br><br> besides being best girl </br></br>  <br><br>Keep punching.<br><br><br><br>Yeah, why not? It would make for an interesting story than a generic SoL route.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and this is an issue why</br>  <br><br>I love how pretty much the biggest publisher in the anime scene right now is 90's Capcom tier in terms of translation acumen.</br></br>  <br>but this isn't a harem</br>  <br> Not a moralfag but a complete trashbag <br> Gets rejected by the girl he wanted in the first episode <br> Imotou doesn't want his dick <br> falls for lead girl first but gets treated like garbage by her <br>I can self-insert just fine.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Being the complete opposite of an established archetype is not a deconstruction.</br>  Who the hell is this Charlotte person?  <br>It's not bait though. All the good anime are non typical anime. Things like ping pong or mushishi the kinds of shows we only get 2 or 3 times a year. Ones with actual artistic ambitions rather than being commercial garbage pandering to otaku for a quick buck.</br>  <br><br>Still better than Funi.</br></br>  <br>It's an outlet for haremfags to complain because they can't self-insert into someone with an actual personality, or at least one not like theirs.</br>  JIBUN WO  <br>He got beaten down by the "no-fun-allowed" police way too quickly.</br>  <br>Nah she probably will, they are shown together in the official poster and PVs and he is actually a fan of hers</br>  <br>I'm sorry but being too 'anime' is not criticism in any way.</br>  <br>Fuck off, moralfag hipster.<br><br><br>Fucking this. Anyone hating the MC is an insertfag or a moralfag.<br>You also forgot to mention that they are scared to admit, that they would act that way given the situation and the power. Mainly the ones calling him edgy.<br><br><br> generic SoL route <br>You really think that will fucking happen? Maybe for a few episodes at best.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   praised Jun Maeda writing <br> steal Kanye from Amagi <br> steal Haruhi <br> steal Koizumi <br> all characters shallow and flat as boards <br> reuse same basic plot over and over and over <br> cant write jokes even under threat of death <br> does not understand after dozen failures tha "writing story" does not exclusively consist of narration and dialogue </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, and you think his personality will make him stop trying to beat the system? Just because the student council has their eyes on him doesn't mean he can't mess around. He just has to be more clever about it. In fact, joining the council himself authorizes him to use his powers to fuck around officially as long as he does his job.</br>  <br>The only thing that bothers me about the MC is that he went out of his way to stalk other students so he would know who would have the correct answers on the test when he could have just as easily used that time to study.</br>  <br>Stop projecting, edgelord.</br>  <br>KEY aids?</br>   it's Kanye again <br> it's even the same va </br>  <br>Go away, edgemaster.</br>  <br>I'm waiting to see how he behaves once he's in the new school.

You did this. You all this did this.</br>  <br>Well, sometimes searching a way to cheat is way easier and more fun than just sitting down and study.</br>  <br>I hope you don't mean Death Note.</br>  An MC worse than Onii-sama <br>I didn't think it was possible</br>  <br>It happens every season.

Kids with mutant like powers teaming up and attending school together.

Amusement park Kanye and Xmen Kanye.<br><br><br> shit taste <br>How surprising that you can even remember it, considering how garbage it was as a whole, wouldn't that fact make you remember it all as such? You must rewatch in regularly. <br><br><br> self insertfag can't understand why he can't self insert <br>Typical retards.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>I hope so. But he didn't have any female MC. It would be interesting if he changes that in few years.</br>  <br>Kanye was actually very skilled at what he does. Yuu is just a skilled cheater.</br>  <br> You must rewatch in regularly. <br>I did, first ep of Hanasaku Iroha and Glaslip to have comparison to Charlotte ep. Both thousand times better directed than this.</br></br>  <br> self insertfag can't understand why he can't self insert <br> Typical retards. <br>I don't get it, why are you making things up and talking to yourself?</br></br></br>  <br>This. I want him to at least keep some of his douchebag side by the end of the series because it's entertaining as fuck.</br>  <br>Can you be anymore edgy? No one is asking for a hugbox but returning to a non /v/ tier discussion in /a/ is preferable.</br>  Not very subtle  <br>Why does /a/ know so much about /v/?<br>I have absolutely no idea how they handle their threads.</br></br>  <br>it's called autism</br>  <br>Not really. Kanye was child actor. He is not born genius and miracle manager - all he has is charisma and ego based on a face he was once famous (as a kid). So with that self confidence and egocentrism he rushes into problems absolutely sure he can solve them (however most of achievements are not his actual actions, but motivation of others.)</br>  Which of Maeda's VN are worth playing?  <br>Why, yes, I would have. I shall attain wizardhood and currency.</br>  <br>Yes, as I wouldn't believe her.</br>  Fucking Mc reminds me Lelouch.<br>Fucking love actors who have internal monologues through your thoughts.<br>I am Yuu di Brittania</br></br>  Only thing I enjoyed about it was the MC which is strange considering it's typically the other way around for me. I liked that he was an actual manipulative cheater too and not some goody two shoes. Don't really care about any of the other characters so far but the glasses guy's power is pretty funny with how he actually has to deal with the momentum.  So instead of getting a strong SoL with a great MC, we get council student hijinks, aka shit. Disappointing.  <br>Does Kanye's power ever actually do something or do they just drop the entire thing after he used it for something important that one time?</br>  <br> MC reminds of lelouch <br>Go watch Amagi Brilliant Park. Lelouch right now is in Classroom Crisis. This is Kanye.</br></br>  <br>So how the fuck does a manga that started in may, get a anime by july? Or was the manga not the source material?</br>  <br>Yes, he's a good leader and made some pretty good plans to get the amusement park back up on its feet. Ever since Yuu got his power his only motivation was getting a cushy position in life with a cute girlfriend in the best school. It's a good thing they stopped him or else he would've been worthless after his power went away.</br>  <br> put a frickin pen in their throat <br>What could possibly go wrong, with murdering the leader of a group of superhumans?<br><br><br>Yes, you pointed it out as such last thread. However nobody gives a fuck considering how shit the plot was. Enjoy the episode one eye candy and reminisce about what could have been.<br>Good to know we have Glasslip fans on /a/.<br><br><br><br> pretending not to understand the reason you got called out for being self-insertfags <br>Playing dumb just doesn't work. Go watch some shitty harem.<br><br><br> KEY cola in AB! trailer <br><br><br>We haven't even seen the SOL in question yet. At least give it a try when we actually see it by episode 3.<br><br><br>It's not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Because the MC was entertaining as fuck, Abusing his power for his own greedy needs and not doing the old "I'm going to use this to save the world/for good!" shitty thing they do.  <br>Fuck mate game of thrones is way to T.V to be good.</br>  The power of four eye is useless. Because after he uses it is useless and extremely tired.  So the glasses guy is basically the reincarnation of Takamatsu from Angel Beats right?  <br><br>There is nothing more annoying than a pushover MC.</br></br>  Little Busters. It's the best out there.  <br>We won't see no SoL anymore.</br>  <br>Calm down man, it's not your AMA thread, you don't need to respond to everyone</br>  Worst MC of the season? <br>Worst MC of the season.</br>  <br>Anon, have you ever gotten help for legitimately being dumb?</br>  Until end an alpha MC, who is not afraid of women and have not seen a bixa when you see the body of a woman  His brother is Magneto. You read it here first.   all that effort <br>why not just study yourself?</br>  <br><br>But Tomori is Professor X.</br></br>  What's her power?  <br>Worst MC of the season is Classrom Crisis if the Teacher counts as MC. Not L-11 Kyousuke seems cool, but MC still use useless teacher.</br>  <br>In the LN's he actually uses it a couple of times, becomes a bit more important right after the anime ended as well.</br>  <br>Yeah, I get sick of people fast if I have to deal with them on a daily basis.</br>  <br>Maeda said 6 episodes of SoL. Think of the Fukko arc in Clannad.</br>  <br>because using unique powers for cheating is cool</br>  Good taste.  <br> Little Busters <br>Everyone expected romance, what a fucking rip off.</br></br>   I can just possess people so I don't study <br>I sure hope he's not planning to become a doctor or an engineer or some career where you actually have to know your shit or else stuff happens and people die.</br>  <br><br>Too hard.

Hell, will all this talk of superpowers, I am half-expecting a Guardian reference in one of the future episodes.  <br>Basically when things rotate, they produce a force that keeps it up. It's like how when you spin a quarter around, it can resist the effect of gravity, but as it loses spin it starts to fall down.</br>  is this some sort of gundam unicorn reference?  Ep1 was bad. MC was terribad.<br>This show still has a change though, it needs to be about the MC being tortured by other people with magical powers. <br>Teleport guy teleports him underwater, invisible girl waits until he falls asleep, and pushes a dildo up his anus (and films it of course), and so on. Every ep they would introduce a new character and new kinds of torture.<br><br>Now, imouto is the only person this shit cares about.

Surely he could have remembered at least 90% of the test answers, it's the exact same test  I really want MC to remain a fraud. That's something we don't often see in an MC, but as someone that has largely succeeded in life through luck and other flukes, and as someone who has compromised his morals more than once to succeed, I was looking forward to a rare opportunity for self-insertion.<br><br>But no, reform is on the way.

Because I'd also do what MC is doing if I habe his power. I'd also kill those two partypoopers who went to your school, killed your dream and forces you to transfer to theirs. Don't say worst MC because Maeda himself said so that he'd be a dick. For me, the president is the worst girl. She's even the main girl.

She summoned one that looks like her dead oniichan. She just wants to see him live happily. She even gave it superpowers so he could live out all his desires, and be happy. For every day the oniichan doll is out, she loses a week of her life. But she doesn't want to live without oniichan. The other student council members are the same.

Now we'll never see her again!</br>  <br> This is Kanye. <br>Kanye barely used any of his powers throughout the show.</br></br>  <br> Far too anime to be good. </br>  <br>I fucking hate that whore for fucking with based protag's life.<br>Wish he would possess her and make her jump off a building.</br></br>  <br>edgy</br>  <br>Gotta admit that would be a nice twist.</br>  <br>True, but status-wise she's the best at her school which is why he's attracted.</br>  Would they explain how she got the time to stalk him? She was working on that for a while.  <br>Bitch, please. She was fighting for worst girl the entire second half.</br>   summer <br> anticipated anime <br> PA Works <br> Key <br>No wonder this thread is so shit.</br></br></br></br>  The premiere looks solid and entertaining so far. Not-Kanye isn't your KEY stereotype, but I can't deny the fact that he had a mischief for exploiting his ability for his own self-interest and deserved to come to his senses. I also like the way their abilities are flawed and temporary, and I wouldn't be surprised if it goes full chuuni battle at some point. That being said, I'm waiting patiently for this slut's introduction and her secret behind her idol career. <br><br>Speculah: They've got their abilities from watching the shooting star years ago.</br></br>  <br>You should be able to figure this out yourself. In case you can't, it's her duty as the student council president of Hoshinoumi to find troublemaking power users and bring them to their school for protection and surveillance. She's given the time to do whatever she needs to succeed. This much can be figured out from the information given in episode 1.</br>   Durarara x2 Ten air day <br> no thread <br><br>Come on /a/.</br></br></br>  <br>No one cares about Durarara anymore. No one cares about Aquarion anymore.

I really hope they don't expect me to recognize her.</br>  Holy shit, 5+ years later and they finally adapt the karaoke scene from the first book.  <br>Or they could've just replaced her with Rio and have had Rio actually be important in some way, which would've been 10X better, but lol nope let's just add another character to our already over-crowded cast.</br>  <br>moot is gone. no reason to watch this</br>    <br>Different.</br>  <br>Different girl. The shit with Rio doesn't happen in the books.</br>  <br> shit <br>Oh, so just more of the same?<br>Maybe they should drop the "slash everybody's names during a semi-continuous shot" thing. Including Baccano, this will have been the 5th OP like that. It's kinda wearing off it's charm. Especially with the increase in characters.</br></br></br>  So will he get stabbed or not?  <br>But Rio is useless.

The shit with Rio never happens.</br>  OP: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>wlx83</wbr>  <br>I know, I've read the LNs. I'm saying that my problem I had with LNs by the end was that there were so ,many characters thast I found myself not giving a shit about most of them. If the anime keeps doing this shit, it's gonna have the same problem but worse.</br>  Well it's a good thing the novel is licensed because this adaption is shit. Seriously, how you gonna cut this?  <br>Is this really sung by Mikado?</br>  <br>I'm waiting on subs, but did they actually not adapt Schoolgirl Celty?</br>  I didn't expect them to cram the entire vol 7 into one episode.<br>Anyone willing to list what was cut?</br>  <br>They had Maid Celty</br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>They zoomed through a couple of chapters, mainly they butchered Shinra and Celty's part. They barely touched on the others so they'll probably go back to those. They better at least not fuck up Akabayashi's chapter.</br>  New OTP.  <br> Well it's a good thing the novel is licensed <br>I sure can't wait for the 10 years it's going to take to reach this point!</br></br>  OP: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>wlzav<br>ED; http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>wlzhw</wbr></br></wbr>    <br> Izaya's left leg <br> that Vorona </br></br>  OP2&gt;OP1&gt;OP3&gt;OP4<br><br>ED1&gt;ED3&gt;ED4&gt;ED2</br></br>  <br>this show has so many fucking characters GODDAMN I love it.</br>  <br>Celty is pretty flexible.</br>  <br>They're gonna be releasing a novel every 3 months, and the first one releases this month, so we'll get Schoolgirl Celty 1 year and 9 months from now.</br>  <br> Rocchi's group  <br><br>I feel bad for the guy.</br></br></br>  <br>ED 4 &gt; ED 3</br>  <br>Why does everyone looks so weird?</br>  <br>The new background looks nice but everyone looks badly drawn.

The subs doesn't matter as much, admittedly.  <br>You mean a BDbox of last season?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>    <br>Why did Ruri get 5X hotter for thatcover?</br>  <br>Because Yasuda wills it.</br>  <br>dat boob squish</br>  <br>This pleases me greatly.<br>I was hoping Gangsta and Gate was going to surprise me but they turn out to be disappointing as expected.</br></br>  <br>I like the new OP<br>Just wished it had Celty x Shinra again, but oh well</br></br>  I can sense the wave of parodies for the new ED. <br><br>That is If they can find a way to fit in 30+ character spots</br></br>  <br>Yeah, upon comparing  and  , her tits and thighs grew, her calves got more shapely, her skin become paler, and she developed a collar bone for the BD cover.</br>  Izaya/Namie OTP  <br>Go to bed, Yasuda.</br>  <br> But it's true though. </br>  Is Shizuo the new Subaru Hasegawa?

Lewd Ruri.  <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>07907</wbr></br>  <br>Check  nobody gives a fuck, faggot </br>  <br>The fuck is with that cat adverisement?</br>  <br>Where's Vivid?</br>  <br>Is that her desktop in the background? It's flaring up my autism.</br>  <br>I hate that slow-ass autofocus that most smartphones have. Really ruins taking any shots.</br>  <br> WHY IS HE NOT PLOWING HER EVERY FUCKING NIGHT UNTIL SHE LEARNS JAPANESE "YAMETE" <br>He's a busy working man.</br></br>  <br> Scoype <br>m8</br></br>  <br>I'll buy 7.</br>  So, that was the whole of book 7, huh? I feel like that part during Dota-chin's monologue was three very important scenes condensed into 9 seconds.  that Kamiyan  OP 2 &gt; 1 &gt; 3 &gt;&gt;&gt; 4<br><br>what the fuck man</br></br>  So, did Izaya kill her ?  Book 1<br> 12 eps <br>Book 2<br> 5 eps <br>Book 3<br> 7 eps <br>Book 4<br> 4 eps <br>Book 5<br> 4 eps <br>Book 6<br> 4 eps <br>Book 7 <br> 1 ep </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, suddenly I don't really want to see Baccano adapted that much anymore.</br>  <br>Animeonlyfag here, first 12 eps were the best</br>  <br>No, they are  friends  now.</br>  <br>Because they need to adapt 10 volumes in 36 episodes. One of them had to be butchered hard.</br>  <br>Maybe, that scene with Izaya being attacked by the crazy girl and Shinra and Celty meeting Aoba happen near the end of the book. The shit that Kadota was talking about were all separate chapters. <br><br>Hopefully they go back and cover some of it, at least debt collectors part and Akabayshi's story.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Considering next episode has the yandere vs. Brocon thing there are atleast 2 episodes for Vol 7</br></br>  <br>1&gt;2<span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;3 &gt;&gt;<span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;4 <br><br>It just gets progressively worse. Current OP is some karaoke-level shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Oops.</br>  <br><br>OP:<br>1 &gt; 3 &gt;2 &gt;4<br>ED<br>1 &gt;4 &gt; 3 &gt; 2</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I feel like that part during Dota-chin's monologue was three very important scenes condensed into 9 seconds. <br>Any chance future episodes might revisit them?</br></br>  <br>I'd say yes.<br>Probably in flashbacks while progressing in the mainstory.</br></br>  <br>I meant how disproportionate it all was. They could've easily cut down Book 4 by an ep, and given Book 7 at least two eps. But if what  ,  and  are saying is right, it may be getting two eps anyway.</br>  <br>There's a screencap of Namie and Mika kissing, so we know they're going to go back and cover that part.</br>  <br>Yeah seriously what the fuck<br><br>OP5 better be good</br></br></br>  how has this fucking kid not gotten himself killed yet?  <br> Desktop clutter <br><br>Dear lord this bitch shouda killed herself.</br></br></br>  <br>His gang's got his back against the small fry, and he doesn't make big enough waves to attract any big guy</br>  Celty please.  <br>He still would have gotten himself killed  right there by Shinra had Celty not stopped him </br>  <br>Wait, is that a heart? Celty you lewd girl.</br>  <br>I dont remember they knew her</br>  wait they did all of novel 7 in one episode? What the fuck? I thought this cour was 8-10?  <br>they go to the same martial arts school.</br>  <br>Gotta make way for kidnapping.</br>  <br>Mikado's voice actor isn't the best singer. But I feel for thematic reasons they let him sing the OP.</br>  They'll probably go back and tie in volume 7 events in later episodes, hell we might even get a Celty date OVA this cour like we did for the Hot Pot party last cour. I don't doubt Omori's adaptation abilities.  <br> we still haven't seen hot pot OVA <br><br>Suffering.</br></br></br>  <br>comes out in a little over 2 weeks, not much longer</br>  Great ED.  I didn't get the karaoke part, Izaya tricked some girls into killing themselves?  <br>Izaya tricked some girls that wanted to kill themselves into killing themselves</br>  <br> literally saying Nakura-san <br><br>Unless you skipped S1, or are illiterate even with spoonfeeding subs, I don't think anime is for you.</br></br></br>  <br> Bitching because no one created a thread <br><br>Stfu faggot and simply make a thread without bitching.</br></br></br>  <br>Well you're early.</br>  <br><br>Well i was busy doing other stuff. Like watching new anime.</br></br>  So, guess no DRRR SH for a while since sales weren't as good as original DRRR and looks like Narita is pandering exclusively to Fujoshits now.  <br>I thought that was just a sidestory.</br>  <br>What's he even writing these days?<br>Baccano's last novel was entirely build-up and Etsusa Bridge Gaiden had a "see you next volume" thing but no next volume was seen</br></br>  I missed these threads. Paid little attention watching the episode. This cour will be pretty shit if my memory is correct regarding the LN.  <br>He's written Fate/Strange Fake<br>Don't know what else</br></br>  <br>Busy role-playing with Urobuchi and Nasu.</br>  <br>Didn't he just release the first volume? I thought that was entirely a minor rewrite of the volume he'd already released of /strange Fake</br>  <br>He released 2 volumes</br>  Tell me about suicide-chan. What is her role in all this? Does she become buddies with Izaya?  Why is Gilgamesh so overpowered?  <br>How powerful you are doesn't fucking matter, considering he gets punked in every route. Actually, basically every servant gets punked by someone "weaker" at least once.<br><br><br> It's pointless to bring up. Serious Gil doesn't exist. <br><br>You act like "serious Gil" is just some bullshit the fandom invented, when it was actually Nasu himself and other official sources mentioning this shit over and over again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course he does. Gil is serious when he's topless.<br>Praise be Gilgamesh.</br></br>  <br> Actually, basically every servant gets punked by someone "weaker" at least once. <br>Fake assassin?</br></br>  <br>We already have three different series with srs bsns Gil anyway. People need to drop that meme.</br>  <br>Well he got punked by Saber but she's not weaker</br>   wanted sci-fi or /m/ <br> knights of sidonia season 1 was okay <br> mfw this shit <br>Convince me not to drop season 2 right now</br></br></br>  <br> fights <br>They were turned into shit with anime original resolves</br></br>  <br> Implying you ain't part of the cancer that is violently killing Sidonia. </br>  <br> but worse for harem shit. <br>Ah, so you mean that in the sense that it's worse if that's what you're looking for, true. I thought you meant that harem is more distracting in the manga than in the anime.</br></br>  <br> those manly arms and shoulders <br><br>it looks like a trannie</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing important actually changed in the end fight, they just added more flash to it for the finale. Other than giving BeniJiro to Kunatochiai the story could move back to the manga line quite easily.</br>  Only two hours to go, anyone else expecting some fun?     funishit <br><br>Better subs when?</br></br>  ORE NO DICK  <br>Is anyone else even touching this?</br>  <br>There are a lot of instances, they translated gattai as melt for example.<br>I don't like it.</br></br>  Hibike Euphonium Season 2 Confirmed<br><br>http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/655<wbr>17</wbr></br></br>  what will be their winter show?  <br>already leaked<br>kyoani won't find the way</br></br>  <br>THANK YOU BASED OBOE-CHAN</br>  <br/>  <br>Shoe1 transforms his trombone into a motorbike?</br>  Friendly reminder that every day episode 12 doesn't air, is a day Leo gets raped by the King of Despair.  <br> is this actual rape <br>Well, in ep 11:<br><br>Zetsubou drags Leo down to his huge ass basement and forcefully  uses  Leo's  power  as Leo cries and squirms in pain. All while it's being recorded on video.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Anything noteworthy?</br></br>  <br>yeah, thats why Haruhi S3 happened.</br>  <br> responding to joke post <br><br>Don't think that part was recorded, just the part at the very end with the "preview". Otherwise the whole city would know about the eyes and he would have to leave HL.</br></br></br>  <br> he would have to leave HL <br><br>More like Leo'd need to up his security a lot, regardless of he stays in HL or not.</br></br></br></blockquote>]
