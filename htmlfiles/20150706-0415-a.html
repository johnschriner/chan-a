Despite the difference in numbers the Japanese are superior and win because Asian gamer damashii.<br><br>Then PoH (who is also an evil NSA agent) unleashes a zerg rush of Korean and Chinese gamers who were recruited by being told this is the a Korean VRMMO that's in beta test but evil Japanese hackers broke into the server, turned off pain dampening and are torturing their countrymen.<br><br>Even when some Japs who speak Korean try to explain the situation to them they don't listen because hurr japanese<br><br>The other NSA guys are surprised this works, they thought it wouldn't be worth it because they didn't think Japan is more different from Korea/China than European countries are from each other (hurr).<br><br>Kirito wakes up and wipes them all out in one attack though.<br><br>(Also PoH's motivation is that he's Korean and he hates Japanese so when he got stuck in SAO he decided to set up Laughing Coffin and have them and the clearers kill each other for shits and giggles because Nips killing each other is hilarious.)<br><br>Leafa and Sinon get almost tentacle raped because Kawahara loves them tentacles but Sinon gunfights with a real American.

That's hilarious.</br>  <br>I wish there was a short children's book with this plot. It would be the best.</br>  <br>They're correct in broad strokes, but skim over or exaggerate many details.<br><br>For example the reason the Japs win against Americans is because they're using exported high level accounts rather than newly created level 1. It's not enough to defeat the Chinese and the Koreans, though.</br></br></br>  <br>This looks like bullshit, but I believe it.</br>  I look forward for more doujins.  <br>It's from the webnovel. How much the author may change when all is said and done, is unknown. If past experience is something to go by, he'll dial back the numbers some at the least.</br>  <br>That sounds like both the dumbest shit ever and the most hilarious shit ever. 11/10 will watch every episode</br>  <br>Of course when they need players that have to be evil they get Americans, and when they need to save the day they get Japanese.<br><br>I get it, you guys are still sour that you lost.</br></br></br>  <br>Seriously, SAO is nothing but literally bad writing.<br><br>It started off really good but toward the end of the first arc it just went down the shitter.</br></br></br>  <br>this is just dumb enough to make me think it's real</br>  <br>It was only good for the first episode.<br><br>Also the books SAO II was based off of were actually decent (except any time Kirito was in them), but A-1 fucked up their adaptation.</br></br></br>   [Mori] Wakako-zake - 01 [C190060B].mkv <br><br>Nobody was making a thread.</br></br>   Alcoholic Christmas cake enjoying food <br><br>I expect great things from this.</br></br>  Man this was really comfy, nice op too  Koufuku Graffiti: After Story?<br>Nice short, though. Thanks Mori.</br>  PLEASE  Based Mori. <br>Weekly scans never.</br>  <br>Man, how did I not notice the meme subs options?</br>   There are memes.    picking up girls imitating their taste <br>No.</br>  <br>ebin ftw jsut what I needed</br>  <br> tripfagging on /a/ <br>No.</br></br>    <br>It truly is a josei</br>  <br><br><br>rofl</br></br></br>  <br>That's okay, you can stop now.</br>  <br>okay I'm sorry but the memes are just so funny</br>  This one was better  This looks funny   op is 1/4th of the episode   that &gt;this fucking faggot and his shit taste, what a pleb, look<br><br>I expected this to be a lot funnier and cuter though, like Wakaranai-ken or whatever people want to call it, but at least the food drawings were nice. Sure have been a lot of food related anime as of late.</br></br>  <br>Welcome to 2 minute shorts.</br>  <br>so did she have bad experiences with her salmon-and-rice-loving ex?</br>  <br>No, she knows that rice is just filler</br>  <br><br>Isn't it just that it's considered weird to have more than once source of rice in a meal, and that she prefers sake?</br></br>  <br>I'm literally ecksdeeing right now</br>  <br>It's value added. Sure, why not, two minute short, sub it twice. If only teekyu could be so lucky</br>  <br> It's value added <br><br>Sure, if you're a 12 years old from Reddit or MAL.</br></br></br>  What a weird style for the girl  <br>I actually am and Mori came to us asking for advice and shit several times before, at least we helped him subbing his stuff.</br>  <br>but that's what makes her so cute. the funny eyes and her pshuuu</br>  <br>If you don't like it, you don't have to select the alt subs. They're purely optional, and there's nothing wrong with the main subs.<br>Stop being such a prickly-dick.</br></br>  Lovely character design.  <br> mature subs for mature people like myself <br>Well okay then, sorry for finding a persons comedic efforts somewhat humorous for the two minutes they went on, surely I have done great harm.</br></br>  It's amazing how josei manga perfectly capture my feelings, sometimes.  <br>Here Anon, have a laugh: Ayy lmao.</br>  <br>Does this have the potential to be AOTS?</br>  <br>Haven't you heard? We're banning fun in here.</br>    <br>Ayy lmao.</br>  <br>I wonder if I can draw Wakako with my shitty drawing abilities.</br>  No one hyped for Overlord? It's a virtual gaming reality anime like SAO and Accel Word.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RuN<wbr>APPcjDr4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> 2 days left </br></br></br></br>   It's a virtual gaming reality anime like SAO and Accel Word.    like sao and accel world   You're putting people off it if you're just gonna mention SAO.  <br> like SAO and Accel Word <br> badhouse <br><br>Yeah I'll pass</br></br></br></br>  Oh boy here we go.  <br>honestly not sure if baiting or believing</br>   inb4 everyone just greentexting SAO   Honestly, for the longest time I assumed that Accelerator was in Accel World.<br><br>Thanks for the confusing naming, Japan.</br></br>  <br> SAO </br>  <br> SAO and Accel Word. <br><br>Oh yea, I WAS hyped, now I'm flaccid.</br></br></br>   Accel Word <br>What is this? Is it an anime about Accelenigga in the ghetto of Academy City?</br>  <br> Hey everyone aren't you hype for Log Horizon? It's just like SAO! <br> Hey everyone aren't you hype for Overlord? It's just like SAO! <br> Hey everyone aren't you hype for .hack? It's just like SAO! <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br>  I guess IRC got tired of trolling Gangsta and Gate and moved on to Overlord.  op actually trigger me by his post what'd i do now /a/?  <br><br>Fund it.</br></br>  <br>Oh God no..<br><br>NOOOOOOOOOO<br><br>Not another SAO clone.<br><br>Fucking stop with this MMORPG shit already.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Madhouse is a piece of shit studio, the biggest normalfag out of all.<br>As a lolicon, I will pass.</br></br>  <br>calm down bro you are mad</br>  <br>But anon, the MC is literally Skeletor.<br>I downloaded the LN. It has the potential to be something quite different.</br></br>  <br>He's right though.</br>  <br> all that cgi <br><br>absolute dogshit</br></br></br>  <br> fetishized shota trap <br>No, it does not.</br></br>  <br>I am. <br><br>Shalltear is mai waifu. NO touch.</br></br></br>  <br> like SAO and Accel Word <br>Read LN</br></br>   MC is skeletor <br>Damn I thought he would be the antagonist.</br>  <br>well the mc and his crew kinda are the bad guys</br>  <br>I hope we get some femdom doujins at least</br>  <br> MC is literally Skeletor </br>   inverse sao clone <br> mc and his harem are the evil guys <br> mc and his harem hunt down humans <br><br>I think we got ourselves the AOTS.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't even read fucking manga, get the hell out you shitter.</br>  The story begins with Yggdrasil, a popular online game which is quietly shut down on its last day. Our protagonist Momonga decided to stay until the last moment in his beloved game and wait for the force logout. Unexpectedly, the server did not shut down and Momonga is stuck in his skeleton body and got transferred to another world. "The powerful Overlord" needs now to discover a new world and face the continuous challenges. <br><br>Having no parents, friends, or place in society, this ordinary man strives to take over the new world the game has become.<br><br> people denying this is not SAO 2.5 </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>MMO is only like first half of first chapter in Novel, then its just fantasy with some references to original game.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know what else had potential until about an episode or two episodes in?<br> SAO </br></br>  If you're going to shitpost at least shitpost better. You won't get much traction if you use SAO, shit's old and busted.<br><br>Log Horizon would be a better example to equate the show with. That way, you can simultaneously shit on both of them instead of being immediately outed as mouth breathing troll the moment you mention SAO.</br></br>  Deadhouse  <br> people denying this is not .hack 6.2 <br>ftfy</br></br>  <br>But LH is exactly like SAO.</br>  Why people shitting on SAO, it actually a good amount of sales for a reason. <br><br>I think this show looks pretty good, and everyone shitting on SAO probably were the ones who enjoyed it the most and are just following the hate train to look like cool kids.</br></br>  <br>It's like SAO, but it just pretends to be very clever at the same time.</br>  <br>Now we're talking.</br>  <br>Why the fuck do these people not just make straight up fantasy instead of half assing it with shoehorned game mechanics</br>  <br> But LH is exactly like SAO. <br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH</br></br>  <br>Nah, LH is inferior Maoyuu (same author), which was set in generic JRPG.<br><br>Maoyuu was decent with all the technology and society building. LH on other hand a LN about MMOs from someone who seems not play any.<br><br>SAO is shit written by 14yo kid, so no matter how you look on it is shit. Accel World is same author that actually learned bit from his mistakes and learned to write.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fantasy needs coherent world building, and it requires the author to have a vivid fantasy - hence the name of the genre.<br>Throwing around random RPG elements is much easier.</br></br>   IIWTTTPUGIAD ripoff <br>Dropped</br>  <br><br>LH is more reminiscent of an actual game though, and has a tad bit less mediocrity and wasted potential.</br></br>  <br> high-quality-bait.exe </br>  <br> It's a virtual gaming reality anime like SAO and Accel Word <br> why no one hyped for it? <br>I REALLY CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY JEEZ</br></br></br>   My garbage is better than your garbage anyway! <br><br>Sure</br></br>  Watch people praising the anime while its running and then when it's done watch how everyone starts shitting on it like half of the dumb kids in /a/ did with SAO.  <br>We Burger King vs MacDonalds now.</br>  Since we are talking about SAO, I must confess that I think that first novel was pretty good 8-9/10, but then it turned into complete shit.  I literally dropped SAO after that shitty Asuna ark with aids-chan. Fucking filler shit to end the season.  <br>Overlord will not be even fraction as good as Hataraku, because Badhouse adapts it.<br><br>Maoyuu, Hataraku, Yuusha ni Narenakatta - all better than adaptation of studio that gave us Mahou Sensou and seeing trailer plans to repeat that achievement.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean like literally every anime ever.</br>   It's a virtual gaming reality anime like SAO and Accel Word. <br><br>Keep saying this, it might decrease the shitposter count when it airs</br></br>  <br>Turbulent start for the series is to be expected. Even though it drops the VR shit halfway into first episode, people not looking far ahead will see only this.</br>  <br>I'd rather most of them not pick it up at all</br>  <br>what the fuck is that on the right side?</br>  <br>I only pick up 0-5 shows per season but it's inevitable that the people hoarding shows in multiples of dozens will pick it up. Though I doubt they have the need to go full shitpost overdrive.</br>  <br>True form</br>  <br>Her real form, all the servants are monsters or demons and the humanoid model/AI programming is just to mask it. She was True Vampire and iirc only Origin Vampire was more hideous.</br>  <br><br>nice</br></br>  <br> TFW NO more Lodoos Wars anime <br>Fuck. I lost my hope with these Berserk movies.</br></br>  <br>Technically, Chaos Dragon is from creator of Lodoss</br>  <br>There's still Chaos Dragon but it's apparently shit.<br>Oh and Rokka no Yuusha.</br></br>  <br>Because then you can't have 14 years old nippon destroying dragons and gods with his katana folded over a 1000 times or magic sequenced over 1000 times.</br>  <br>Because it's the fad these days, easy relation and all that, even if the mc is 30 something salaryman and paranoid.<br><br>Author could have gone without it but then establishing the fact how Nazarick and the servants were created would have less edible if nobody else in the New World has managed to do it.<br><br>The strongholds/guild bases from Yggdrasil do exist in New World, at least 2 of them besdies Nazarick but the other has no "masters" and the other is "stuff of legends", ie appeared loooong time ago.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mmo anime <br><br>Into the trash it goes</br></br></br>  <br>Because they're been doing that garbage for the past what 60 years<br>fuck off</br></br>  So every character's true form looks like shitty monsters, and MC is the only one who doesn't give a fuck and stays like that.  <br>He goes out with the helmet on and uses illusion magic whenever he needs to show his face when he's gallivating as a pretend hero.</br>  <br>do we have summary spoilers for vol 7?</br>  Well shit, it really makes a difference in the quality if the thread if you don't mention SAO in the OP. Well done OP in luring the shitposters.  <br>Congratulation OP you killed your own thread.<br>Anyway I'm looking forward to it.</br></br>  <br>No other true forms are revealed for the characters outside of Shalltear and if they can't use their gear or items in monster form I have to question the validity of reverting to them.<br><br>The rest of their forms are merely hinted at or partially revealed, ooze, doppelganger, dragonid and so on. Well there's mushroom bartender/chef and head maid/high priest with human body with dog head transplant but they barely have lines/appearances.</br></br></br>  <br> No other true forms are revealed for the characters outside of Shalltear <br><br>You are forgetting Demiurge.</br></br></br>  <br>Well he is suave motherfucker that doesn't really get "hampered" by his true form (later in raws, or the partial form in 1st volume). I'm hoping the rest are somewhat valid too.</br>  <br>Inb4 Sebastian's true form is a apartment complex size dragon.</br>  <br>isn't there some belief that Albedo's true form is some form of a guerrilla</br>  <br>Anyone who reads it is hyped. Everyone who is not is a dirty secondary.</br>  <br>Equal parts of wary and hype. Don't want to get my hopes broken too hard.</br>  Who is working on the next volume anyways? I heard Kaezar was working on one.  <br>I beat you just read the shitty manga adaptation days before and feel like the shit, to bad you're worse than a secondary.</br>  <br>Nigga you have no Idea who you are talking to. I've been reading Overlord before it even got attention on /a/. The manga is decent for visuals and reaction pics though.</br>  <br>Kaezar works on 6th, someone on baka-tsuki is doing 7th. So I'm guessing FSO (and maybe Sky since he did half of 4th) will tackle 5th.</br>  <br>Sure thing buddy, keep lying to yourself.</br>  <br> MC is a spooky skeletor  <br>2spooky4me</br></br>  <br> like SAO <br>I fucking hate SAO and actually enjoy the overlord WN and LN. Please don't throw my dear papa bones into the same bag as that SAO garbage, thank you.</br></br>  <br>the main problem with the manga is that it's going on sanic tier speeds and it doesn't seem to be slowing down, hopefully the anime will avoid that.</br>  <br>at 13 episodes it's not looking good</br>  <br>You do realize that in the original WB, there is cannon demfom and S/M going on right?=</br>  <br>I've read everything translated and I am not even remotely hyped. It looks to be shittier than Madan no Ou to Vanadis. At least that anime IMPROVED the art.</br>  <br>well three volumes with 13 episodes is decent, it could be a lot worse.</br>  <br>Who is Kaezar and where does he post his shit?</br>  <br> implying the publishers are willing to let Madhouse stop at 3 volumes </br>  <br>If they want the advertisement to succeed, they better go for that. Nobody wants to see hundreds of pages of runes condensed into 1-2 episodes.</br>  <br>which one's that? I read the WN so i could give you some, but its VERY different from the LN</br>  <br>it's the one where some adventures end up finding the Tomb, Ainz let them enter loads of different parts of it, though I don't recall why.</br>  <br>Morbid curiosity at best, since you know, they end up being pretty dead for the most part. Best second hand salt ever, fucking WN readers and author asking progression by public vote.</br>  <br>But that's the thing, most publishers believe letting them watch more arcs means hooking more people. Compare LH and SAO. LH has way more talking, a lot less action. Which sold more? Therefore which influences publishers when they make their decisions?<br><br>Madhouse is only the studio, I doubt they can say jack shit if the publisher tells them to go for 6 instead of 3.</br></br></br>  <br>has there ever been a case of an anime adaptation of an LN which was was rushed that ended up selling well. We have to remember that the purpose of the anime is to advertise the LN, so not showing too much could also be considered a good thing.</br>  <br>ah, you want me to summarize it? I can give you the info from the WN if you want, but so far, its quite different. For starters, Arche is a bitch in the WN but she's a nice person and dutiful daughter/sister in the LN.</br>  <br> tfw no character has survived the deathflag poll </br>  <br>SAO skips entire segments, possibly arcs. So yes.</br>  <br>True, it's pretty lamentable for the original readers/fans. And we can only hope that they go for 3-4, more later if it sells well.<br><br>It's pretty ?? where to stop since the "big picture" and grand scheme of things only get work done on them in 1st, 2nd and 7th volume for the most part. The "Grand Plan For Nazarick" that is.<br><br>3rd volume with the Shalltear's resurrection and Ainz looking at his servants like they were his comrade's children and so on would be pretty good spot to end on.<br><br>Same with 6th/7th volume turnover I hear. Ending it just on 4th or heck, 5th since it's just build-up for 6th would be pretty damn dumb due their ending notes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just don't think they can resist the 6th volume because of Momon's big damn hero moment and having an entire nation circle jerk to him. Hell I bet during the rolling credits for the final episode they would do Vol 7's prologue where they reveal to Ainz everyone's aiming for World Domination and leave it off at "Eh?"</br>  <br>Please no, it would be sweet but damn, no, don't do it Production Commitee.</br>  <br>Unless the 6 BD's revelead are all 4 ep long to accommodate 24 eps. That would okay too but that would be counter-intuitive for jp bd jewing schemes.</br>  Only 13 episodes...? let me think...<br>yeah, 3-4 episodes per arc seem fine</br>  <br>No episode count announced, just that the series will have 6 BD volumes. So either they jew it out with 5x2, 1x3 setup or span it out with 6x4.</br>  <br>Now ask yourself, how many LN anime adaptations were paced right when they have lots of QUALITY?<br><br>Honestly I think mecha works a lot better for CG, because guns are a lot easier to animate than melee combat and crazy rainbow colored explosions. <br><br>And then you gotta factor in the fact that despite the LN's claims that people like Shalltear were moving at the speed of sound basically during her duel with Ainz, she was still managing to utter out entire fucking sentences mid charge. It's not escaping the big problems of adaptation conversion.<br><br>Ironically I think the Slime LN works the best, because the MC not only has 1000x perception speed, but he also receives sound/voice/etc through magic sonar and not the actual sound waves. That and the WN is already finished, unlike Overlord. But both are way too different to compare I guess.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It looks promising. Cant really say much because I haven't watched it</br>  <br>He's just like Kirito</br>  This reminds me, what happened to the manga on batoto? it hasnt updated in months now  <br> Not posting the DUAL WIELDING BLACK SWORDSMAN alter ego </br>  <br>Manga publication took 1 month break in magazine for the 1st volume release. No idea if the newest magazine carried(/will carry) a new chapter.</br>  <br>People probably lost interest in it. It's vastly different, we're talking Maoyuu manga different. And ironically it tries to be cutesy like the Maoyuu manga as well, except Overlord isn't a comfy romcom with saving the children economics at all. It's quite the opposite.</br>   mfw overlord isn't about a nooblet logging in just as the game goes offline for good and deciding to slowly conquer the world  <br><br>Fucking japan.</br></br>  <br><br>Looks like you're wrong. </br></br>    <br> No one hyped for Overlord? It's a virtual gaming reality anime like SAO and Accel Word. <br>This is you</br></br>  <br>you forgot "with monkey grip"</br>  guys i have a problem. i watched all of dragon ball which i really enjoyed and then i watched Z. i got to episode 186 of Z which is during Gohan's fight with Cell. However it got really boring and I havent watched an episode in about 5 months. I want to watch Super but i have to slog through another 100 Z episodes, which i have no motivation to do.  why dont you watch Z kai instead?  Then watch Kai or  You could check the  dubs .  Goku beats up a pink blob<br><br>there whole buu arc spoiled go watch super</br></br>  At least finish up the cell saga.<br>The Majin buu saga is much better in my opinion but /a/ will tell you that it's the worst, you need to watch it to get some characters from super. <br><br><br><br>Kai ends in the cell saga.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kai ends in the cell saga. <br>good b8 m8</br></br>  <br>They already animated the buu saga too.</br>  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>Watch it x2 speed.</br>   Not watching Kai <br> Being this retarded </br>  <br>You gave up at the show's peak, so the whole thing is probably not for you. I'd just watch something else.</br>  Just read the fucking manga you idiot.  <br><br><br><br>They dubbed it?</br></br></br></br>  <br> watching dub <br>LOL</br></br>  <br>It's not like it would take you more than 30min to catch up by reading a summary.<br>It's DBZ, just check out the new powers of the characters and learn a thing or two about Buu.<br>If you want to catch up for Super, watch Battle of Gods and Fukkatsu no F</br></br></br>  <br><br> watching dragon ball subbed <br><br>Goku is voiced by a fucking 80 year old woman.<br><br>I mean, good for her, but the jap dub is pantsu on head retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oh come on if you even know the slightest bit about Dragon Ball you can watch Super. You don't have to watch the entire series if you haven't already.  <br><br> Buu Saga <br> Goku gets more powerful <br> Fusions <br> Goku and Vegeta kill a pink asshole <br><br>There you're all caught up</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Maybe that's your problem. Stop watching Toonami Ball Z and learn Nozawa's range. I don't see how anyone could prefer the dub.</br></br>  I like the italian dubs<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Bnh<wbr>4YSb897k</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>meant to quote<br/></br>  <br>That's a problem with you, not the show.</br>  <br>sorry.<br><br>no.<br><br>you are wrong.<br><br>I mean your opinion is valued, but you are dead fucking wrong.<br><br>The difference between toei and funimation is incredibly huge that you'd figure yourself to be "pantsu on headu retardedu" for even saying that.<br><br>Prime example of how Funimation sucks. In Battle of Gods, Goku refers to the Super Saiyan God form exhaustion as a "bad hangover" where Goku never in his life drank beer or alcohol or anything of the sort. He wouldn't know what a "hangover" is. In the original battle of Gods Goku plainly said that it took a lot of energy.<br><br>And since Op is watching dubbed Z instead of Kai, it's even worse. All of that shitty Bruce Faggotry playing SUPA SERIUSSS HADCORREE ELECTRUCSS GUITARSSS during scenes that really doesn't need it. Filling all of the silence that normally builds up tension with shitty music because silence is bad. All of the characters making extra grunting and noise because HURR DURR kids will get bored.<br><br>All of that shitty english humour as well that makes no sense in the Dragon ball universe. Dub is just horrid.<br><br>Funimation even said it themselves, back when they dubbed Z it was in the 90's and they had almost no power or control over it. They had to do whatever the directors and producers at the time put in front of them. These people knew little to nothing about dubbing and japanese culture and animation.<br><br>So yeah, fuck you, Jap is better. Translated mangas are better. BECAUSE IT IS SOURCE MATERIAL that isn't fragmented by convoluted english bull shit.<br><br>Also<br> hurr durr muh 80 year old granny Goku <br>This is about as bad and as irrational of an argument as saying you can't wipe your own ass because then you'll get shit all over your fingers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Translated mangas are better <br><br>I was with you until there. Learn Japanese and read it in its true form, EOP.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot to mention how much of a fuck up Gohan becomes.</br>    Don't waste your time with the show.<br><br>If I were you I would read the manga for the rest of it, only watching episodes that feature specific events that are really cool in the manga, like Teen Gohan's  SSJ2  transformation. I don't know why I spoilered that, but maybe you're really living under a rock.<br><br>DBZ had a shit ton of awful animation and filler that isn't worth sitting through.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Didn't Goku say it would be bitter and picked a sports drink instead?</br></br>  First the anime and now this.<br><br>Why does Umineko suffer so much?</br></br>  Is the ending to umineko considered good? Or is it one of those open to interpretation affairs?  <br>The ending is very good.</br>  <br>When Yukari started to get motivation to fight back against bulliing and told Reiko that she didn't need to sacrifice herself for them I started to think "Yes! Now give her a big hug!" And then my illusions were shattered right after as I remembered who was writing the story in the first place.</br>  <br>The last installment of the VN isn't great, honestly. The manga ending is much, much better.</br>  <br>It's &lt;good&gt; if you pick the right one</br>  Ep 1 in a little over 4 hours.<br><br>Who Alisa here?</br></br>  Nuh uh.  <br>Alisa and Gina are best girls</br>  <br>Better hope Ufotable does a good job at this. It's going to be pretty hard to beat a lot of the recently airing anime.</br>  <br>Why are Slavs in anime always so fucking sexy?</br>  <br>the best</br>  Wait, pretty sure it's delayed for a month right?  <br>Because they need to make sure the best girls looks good.<br> German girls are good too </br></br>  Who Nana here?  <br>Wasn't it a week?</br>  <br> month <br><br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>Delayed a week.<br>Also, GE2RB localization never EVER.</br></br>  <br>Honestly the Shounen to beat this season is Ushio to Tora and it's going to take a lot to trumple the MAPPA Magic.</br>  <br><br>They delayed the first episode a week, you know, arguably the most important one, the one where they get you hooked so you watch the rest and then go out and buy the games? What does that say about the quality of the rest of the production?</br></br>  UBW killed God Eater.  god eater is nothing special, why the hype?  <br>Really good since they're putting lots of effort and time into it?</br>  <br>From what I remember what Ufofags are saying is that the anime have better toning. That's it.</br>  <br>Nigga you put extra effort and time by scheduling properly and having built in crunch so you don't need to cancel and push things back cause shit aint done when it needs to be.</br>  <br>Good, because the shading in the preview looked sickening.</br>  I know people is going to hype this because<br> mah ufo <br><br>I will wait for the QUALITY.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No no i just checked it once again to make it sure.<br>http://www.necoweb.com/neco/info/de<wbr>tail.php?id=400<br>They changed the schedule for a whole month.</br></wbr></br></br></br>  Will neetball be streaming?  Are the games any good anyway? And I mean in ways that would translate into anime(so characters, story, setting), not gameplay.<br><br>I'm still hyped because of the director but I'd like to temper my expectations.</br></br>  <br>Why does it say it's airing today on the official website?<br><br><br>I would say the story is OnS level. Maybe a bit better.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Like? Not that it's airing tomorrow but I've yet to see any real winners so far or even anything better than mediocre. It'll probably just slot right in there.</br></br>  <br><br>ufoTABLE fanboyism seems about it really. It might have some good action and cool characters, but I'm not expecting all that much special kind aside from that kind of like with UBW.</br></br>  Aus fag here, God Eater Burst isnt available on PSN here. Does God Eater have a good enough plot to justify wasting the 20 minutes it takes to watch an episode?  What should I watch Dragonball or this?  <br> Why does it say it's airing today on the official website? <br>They are airing episode 0 special today.</br></br>  <br>She is cute, but butter if she stop friendly bust me to the ground.</br>  Delayed right from the get go that surely bodes well<br><br>Bunch of hacks at ufotable</br></br>  <br>I'm going to blame Aniplex and UBW.</br>  For those who want to watch the 10 min PV.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Zkm<wbr>5MKMrbhs</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Isn't it suppose to be a special episode cause episode 1 is delayed?</br>  <br><br><br>Wait, so they just re-aired that?</br></br></br>  <br>They are airing that PV for the the 1st half and staff interview for the 2nd half.</br>  Oh, monsters have uncesored tits  <br>Wait what?! sauce?</br>  <br>What happened to SHADING?</br>  <br>I guess wait until BD.</br>  <br>Ushio to Tora.<br>Charlotte.</br></br>  <br>That PV is actually the old OVA made a few years back. It has a different character designer from the current show.</br>  <br>What's the age rating for this adaption? That alone will give an indication whether it's worth picking up.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that PV is unrelated to the current anime, and it's that game prologue OVA that was released some years ago</br>  <br> MUH UFOTABLE </br>  <br>Nana a cute<br> Julius is the best girl though </br></br>  <br>I'm a sucker for post apocalyptic settings<br>That , and I also love to see people with big weapons take out even bigger monsters</br></br>  Anime will probably be delayed a month, maybe even next season. People at AX said all ufotable showed at the GE panel was the unfinished OP  <br>What the FUCK is Hirao doing?</br>  I played the game for a while before and it didn't really have a story, stuff just happened between missions, will it really work as an anime?  <br>Back to /v/ you go.</br>  <br>I doubt this predicament is his fault.</br>  <br>For playing the game the anime is based on? Should I go to /v/ for playing Persona? I'm not even trying to discuss the game itself.</br>  <br>The music is good. The plot is kinda JRPGish, but okay, doesn't harp on cliches too much.</br>  <br><br> aniplex production hell cause aniplex  <br> bamco production hell cause asinine bamco release dates.  <br><br>Doubt this is his fault</br></br></br></br></br>  I'm not really into monster hunter games, maybe anime based on monster hunter games are better.  <br>What the fuck? Should I go to /v/ for playing Hyperdimension Neptunia? <br><br>Fuck off, retard.</br></br></br>  I'm surprised this got an anime adaptation when the psp game sucked so hard. Is it because of the waifu value?  Alisa and Ciel master race, I've had burst since 2010 but just made it past 300 hours mark today lel, can't wait for the actual first episode  <br>Yes you should fuck off to /v/ for playing a shit game. Now fuck off retard.</br>  <br> Ciel <br>Good taste here my friend</br></br>  <br>I need to replay Burst eventually.</br>  <br><br>Wait for Ressurection</br></br>  Thanks, and I just wish Bamco would localize the sequel already, but it seems they don't want our gaijin money :T  <br>Is that translated?</br>  Important facts about Dragon Ball Super<br><br>-It will start out with its own thing and then It's doing Battle of Gods and Revival of F as arcs and then doing something involving Universe 6<br>-The manga is monthly, not drawn by Toriyama and strictly for promotion of the show. Don't use it as reference<br>-There is no plot past this that we can guess. Anything you hear about it is fake and gay<br>-Current subs kinda suck in terms of timing and typesetting. Wait for Moonlighters. Or just watch Raw, its not that hard to get<br>-Videl is love, Videl is life</br></br></br></br></br></br>   reusing the whole movies <br> toei <br>Why am i not surprised<br>DBZfags will defend this</br></br></br>   Or just watch Raw, its not that hard to get <br><br>Wow you are a faggot</br></br>  <br>True DBZ fags hate pre BoG movies tho</br>  Are they fighting in the first ep or I can skip it ?   opening song not HERO by Flow <br>Fucking dropped<br><br> jk the op is pretty good </br></br></br>  <br>Have you ever considered that what you say out loud might make you look like a faggot to other people?</br>  <br>Skip if you only want fighting. Only real "fight" is Trunks punches a big snake.</br>  <br>There's a fight, I'm sure it'll satisfy your needs</br>  Why does Goku need a tractor when he could just pull pretty much anything by hand with little to no effort?  <br>It is pretty good.</br>  First episode was a dissapointment and somehow everyone got like 10 years younger  <br>tsundere Videl was great<br> turn her into deredere shit <br>flirtatious 18 was great<br> turn her into tsundere waifu <br>pure Chichi was great<br> turn her into horrible soccer mom <br>Bravo Toriyama and Toei</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Soccer mom spotted hashtag happening</br>  <br>Each universe has it's own God of Destruction?<br><br>Sweet. I hope there's a Hindu universe and Goku fights Shiva</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, what the fuck did they do to Videl, man.<br><br>And her new design is shit, best design is the first one she had before cutting her hair.</br></br></br>  Remember when Videl was a cool martial artist? Remember when she was a human on a show with walking planet crushers and managed to be relevant for a while? Remember when she had some personality and wasn't just some waifu bullshit?<br><br>I miss those days.</br></br>  <br>Except Satan's fucking dog. How come he's suddenly grown up?</br>  God, fuck this new Videl. They completely ruined her character. And Gohan.  <br>ChiChi</br>  <br>Women in Dragonball just get shit on. At least Bulma was somewhat the same when she got knocked up.</br>  <br>Videl was never really relevant. I mean she goes 0 to wanting Gohan in like 4 chapters.</br>  <br>don't you know that once a woman settles down, she becomes a useless passive object that exists that shits out babies and takes care of them? what, are they supposed to be proactive and go on adventures like the guys? that's crazy talk!<br><br>I think 18 got hit the worst by this. She's actually a superior fighter to her husband, yet Krillin still gets treated as the real fighter out of the two. She never does shit when she could do so much.</br></br></br>  Fine, I'll get best Videl elsewhere.  <br>As much as I'd like to see 18 do more, I do equally like seeing her always holding Maron's hand or holding her. It's the cutest shit ever.</br>  <br> managed to be relevant for a while? <br>Literally never</br></br>  How is it all these years people still complain about girls not getting enough screentime in shounen.<br><br>I mean yeah it stinks, but consider the demographic</br></br>  <br>well, there is still Bulma<br>she didn't really turn all deredere with Vegeta and probably keeps building stuff/runing Capsule Corp</br></br>  <br><br> true DBZ fans <br>More like those who only saw BoG like BoG and nothing else.<br><br>Revival of F is the biggest reused fillershit.<br>BoG was complete ass, the jokes were too fucking much, too much stupidity, not enough fighting, goten and trunks are still kids but they shouldn't be, etc.<br><br><br>then we have Super, the next monstrosity.<br>reusing the movies is absolutely unforgivable. Forgetting animalfolk from towns are also that.<br><br>However, one can only hope it will get better over time, as the first episode was complete shit, except a few parts with Videl - Gohan excluded of course.<br><br>Chi-chi is a bitch, Gohan is a pansy, and now Goten's getting turned into a pansy too.<br><br><br>I'm with Piccolo on this one, absolutely disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>God, 18. Such a cool character who gets shafted so hard.<br><br>Just give the gal someone to fight, seriously.</br></br></br>  <br>At least the first 2:25 minutes were good.<br>The OP is nice.<br><br>Everything else was shit, from drawings, to animation, to story, to that roundfaced Videl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  getting kneecapped in the face means being relevant <br>but I agree. Videl should be a policewoman with a tomboy attitude or something and have some personality.<br>c18 is a fucking robot so she had no personality to begin with</br></br></br>  <br>she just came in too late<br>considering how fast she learnt to fly, she could have been a beast if she existed in early DB<br>(still don't get how she was able to fly, but not to do kikoha)</br></br></br>  <br> BoG was complete ass, the jokes were too fucking much, too much stupidity, not enough fighting, <br>You've completely highlighted the things people loved about it and why it was good</br></br>  <br>Alright, she never fought anyone besides fucking Huge McDuder during the tournament, but she was a cool character at least. Plus it was cool having a human character get some spotlight again.</br>  <br> Krillin still gets treated as the real fighter out of the two <br><br>Not really, Krillin vowed to protect the Earth when he trained with Kami, so yeah, he will pretty much be dragged to all fights.<br><br>18 only cares about her family and money, she doesn't really care about Earth at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  God this was bad. There were fucking no fights. IT was all just sitting around doing nothing with a few shit jokes thrown in. What has happened to DBZ? This isn't the DBZ I knew, this is an abomination. Videl has turned fucking useless, Gohan is still a btich, and now what... VEGETA GOING ON A HOLIDAY?? Fuck this. I'm out. DBZ is officially dead.  <br>How to spot a faggot in 1 post</br>  Shes hiding her power level.  <br>Anon, that doesn't make her relevant. It makes her a character you like<br><br><br>Obvious faggot post detected (It's not even DBZ you idiot)</br></br></br></br>  <br> i have not seen Dragon ball in my life <br> i have no seen BoG/RoF either <br> i am a huge faggot </br></br></br>  <br>stfu faggot</br>  <br>Now I get what it reminded me of!</br>  <br> the only normal human woman in the entire world who can fly and use Ki <br> turns to a dere dere housewife <br><br>this should be a crime.</br></br></br></br>  Gohan is a fucking pedo.  Just started the franchise. 20 minutes into My Conquest is the Sea of Stars, and I'm kinda bored. The battle was pretty enjoyable though.  <br>It's like you're asking for spoilers.</br>  <br>Are you expecting a masterpiece in the first 20 minutes or something?<br>Think about that series develops across 110 episodes, where at the end of the series half of the main cast is dead.</br></br>  I hope you're baiting, because otherwise you're just really stupid.  <br>So you're 20 minutes into the first movie, and you're bored? Jesus, better give up on the second film and the 110 episode main series, because it only goes downhill.</br>  I think you guys are doing the series a bit of disservice, sure the main OVA is 110 episodes, but I think the Gaiden really deserves to be watched as well and at 50 episodes with both Gaiden's I really enjoyed having more material a couple weeks after I'd watched the finale.  <br>There's two prequels and the 110 episode OVA. I think you're jumping the fucking gun if you think it's going to go full masterpiece in the first episode.<br><br>There's this thing called world building that doesn't just happen. Give it time.</br></br></br>  <br>Why would you tell us something like this? Go finish the damn movie.</br>   Just started the franchise. 20 minutes into My Conquest is the Sea of Stars, and I'm kinda bored <br>Why? Too complex for you? Try watching Lucky Star instead, you baby.</br>  <br> not enjoying it <br> HURRRRRRRRRRRR 2COMPLEX4U <br>Fans like this are what put me off of watching the series.</br></br></br>  <br>But that doesn't make any sense.</br>    <br>Nice facebook tier fallacy.</br>  <br><br>A cancerous fanbase can ruin something good. Look at what happened to Attack on Titan. Granted, Attack on Titan isn't extremely good, but it's enjoyable, but the fanbase has ruined it and made many people avoid it entirely.</br></br>  <br>Why don't just ignore the fanbase?</br>  <br> can't even sit through a 1 hour movie without pausing it and begging to be encouraged to continue <br> 1 hour <br>It's not even as long as Bambi you ADD attention whore. Either watch the movie or don't<br><br>I'd spoil it for you just to spite you, but that would be an insult to the series</br></br></br></br></br>  Everyone dies.  <br>I never liked it, the fanbase has no bearing on it. If I disliked things because I disliked the people who like them, I'd kill my dog because Hitler liked dogs. That's dumb.</br>  <br>When I have people like  over here, it's kind of hard to do so.</br>  <br>If you can't get through 45 minutes of something, you really have issues.</br>  <br>You stop watching something because his fanbase? Thats very superficial.<br><br>Make yourself a favor and return to /r/anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Yang and Reinhardt dies.<br><br>Now you can put on your MAL that you completed LOGH.</br></br></br>  This thread would be better if I was here.  <br>He never got to tap Reinhard's sister, did he?</br>  <br>I got through it and was actually very entertained by the other 39 minutes that I watched. But first impressions are key, and the first 20 minutes, apart from the battle, wasn't very impressive.</br>  yang dies  <br> first impressions are key <br>I don't remember any single anime that hooked me with how it started, but whatever you say.<br> very entertained <br>So are you going to sit down and watch the series or not?</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, he died in Episode 20 and didn't get a chance to.</br>  <br>He needs some TTGL tier for get hooked to a series.</br>  It's been a year now. What does /a/ think of Akame Ga Kill?  The manga is powerfully stupid and bleak as fuck for no good reason. The anime was simply powerfully stupid. <br><br>I liked it and the anime original ending surpasses the manga because fuck the Akame Ga Kill manga, friends.</br></br>  Anime was better than source material.<br>Esdeath was the best thing from this show.</br>  <br>I didn't like the art style or the plot.</br>  <br><br>Worst post</br></br>  <br>I still haven't reverted back to 14 years old so It's still shit.</br>  Next chapter when?   p e a n u t b u t t e r   <br>Esdeath anime aedition was my favorite part. Holy shit those luscious tits. But yeah the anime was supbar, not that the source is so much better. Having the MC not be suck a plain self-insert would improve the series immensely.<br><br>Least favorite part was MC's disinterest in fucking a 10/10 who was literally begging for it. Yes, I fully understand that realism isn't something to be expected in a series like this, but they took it too fucking far. It was insulting to imply that anyone would react that way.</br></br></br>  <br>Dropped it.<br>Started promising but it turned into fucking shit very quickly.</br></br>  <br>Well, you're half right.</br>  <br> It was insulting to imply that anyone would react that way <br>Staying loyal to his friends instead of fucking some crazy bitch? What a fucking asshole!</br></br>  The manga threads were amusing.  <br>This is the common train of thought, but why are we to assume anything bad would happen after fucking her? She's already obsessed with him by that point</br>  <br>Because Esdeath could mindbreak him into betraying NR for her, and believe it or not, he actually knows better in spite of the giant watermelons staring him right in the face.</br>  <br>Because she's a fucking psychopath and worst girl?</br>  <br><br>Choice A:<br> Stick to your beliefs and stand your ground against the genocidal sadist after knowing he can't change her <br><br>Choice B: <br> Dive into pussy, fuck the revolution and better nation big titties here I come </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The manga, shit as it may be, will surpass the anime ending if they have Tyrantsumi kill Esdeath. It's building up to that, and frankly it's the only thing that's keeping me around.<br><br>That, and hoping Wave gets to die with his waifu since I'm not about to pretend she'll live.</br></br></br>  <br>In what way would fucking her, then continuing on the same path of escaping have changed anything?</br>  Step aside, here's real best girl.  <br>Because she's absolutely fucking insane? <br>Did you miss the whole show?<br><br>You know the idea of "not sticking your dick in crazy"? It probably includes batshit crazy genocidal sadist psychopaths.</br></br></br></br>  <br>See <br>She's already out to kill Night Raid. Unless there's somehow a worse punishment she can deliver than death he has nothing to lose.</br></br>  <br> Manga will follow the anime's ending in a general way <br>I stopped caring. Best girl won, so there's that at least.</br></br>  <br>It really says something about AgK when the fucking 2-minute joke theater segments made me tear up harder than the anime or manga ever could.</br>  <br>Even better.</br>   make a cute loli <br> turn her into an old hag <br> kill her off <br><br>Well, at least Kurome is still alive.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kurome and Wave better make it out alive.</br>  <br>Wasted potential, if the author wasn't a freaking shipperfag it could have been greater than HxH.</br>  Ok, fuck off with these threads for one.<br><br>Manga was unfinished when the anime had to end, so the ending or how they changed the plot in accordance to that isn't the problem. That's like saying FMA 2003 was shit.<br><br>But Akame ga Kill was. All the characters were just fucking poorly written and I didn't care much for them at all. It didn't help that all the squeezed in comedy that was supposed to be left in Theater was tarnishing the "edgy" image of the anime.<br><br>Subpar/10, it's okay.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The same as always Esdeath is the best!</br>  <br>Waiting for next chapter.</br>  I enjoyed it. I wish more shounen would kill off characters instead of making them magically survive every battle making the bad guy look like a small, unimportant weakling.<br><br>Also Esdeath and Akame were some of the hottest girls of 2014.</br></br>  I want to settle down in the woods with Akame, trigger her flags to make her go doki doki for me and hunt danger beasts for a living with her.  manga&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anime  <br>I want to doggystyle Akame.</br>  <br>Don't be so delusional, because reading your post make me delusional as well and when _that_ happens I'll hate you and myself equally. They are the last two components why I am still reading this SasugaTakahiroManga. Maybe Tyrant too. Maybe.</br>  <br>They'll live. Wave will become a high rnaking official in the new government and he and Kurome will share a nice home in the capital where they happily raise their two children.</br>  <br>But before that he'll introduce his waifu to his mother.</br>  <br>Yep. And they'll get along great, even if they'll get competitive while trying to make dinner for Wave together.<br>It'll be a great, happy ending.</br></br>  So is there no new chapter this month or what?  <br>nope</br>  <br>It's been a year? Holy shit I'm getting old. Man I'm going to die soon.</br>  <br>Wait till July 20. That will be the beginning of the last arc.</br>  Horrible show, manic tone changes and overly dramatic character deaths that were funny more than sad. Mine dying was actually hilarious.  <br>Manga ended up being as stupid as the anime original material.</br>  <br>Akame not being a better character and not being the winning girl made it even more shit. She was the only reason i even picked this up.</br>  <br> Akame not being the winning girl made it even more shit <br>Akame likes all meat. Not just Tatsumeat.  Mine is still shit though. </br></br>  Akame a cute.  <br>She got some majestic breasts.</br>  <br>My friend told me it's his favorite anime.<br>His second favorite is SAO.<br>So we're not friends anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>Wasted potential. It should have been about Akame.<br>The anime should have been better produced.<br>The manga shouldn't have been shonen crap.<br>Takahiro a shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> It should have been about Akame. <br>You wanted to hear what she thinks or what? Akame is tagging along. The build around would have been the same.</br></br>  <br>It actually wouldn't. Akame as MC would skip most of the shonen shit (because she's so strong), and the writer could focus on the story and worldbuilding much more to make something actually interesting instead of the usual shitty shonen duels<br><br>They're assassins. They shouldn't fight this much in the first place. I hate how most of their target was conveniently strong and knew how to fight them on equal grounds.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, the fights were weird. It was a fighter group, no assassins.</br>  <br>you cant just kill off every character and call it an ending, like what the fuck</br>  <br>That no matter what the whiners around here say, it was a very entertaining show.</br>  She was delicious.  <br> They're assassins. They shouldn't fight this much in the first place <br>I'd just like to remind you where that word comes from; an order of Islamic warrior-monks who murdered people for money. They aren't Agent 47</br></br>  You promised me there would be meat anon, where is it? Where is that meat? Anon?  <br>The threads were the best part about it.</br>  Cutest girl with the best girlfriend personality.  <br>She gave great head too</br>  I still have scars from all the edge it cut me with.  <br>Kill Ga Kill yourself.</br>  <br>It's betrayal in spirit. Come on, anon, it's not that hard to grasp.</br>  I avoided the threads cause of autism but can someone explain to me why people are triggered by esdeath? Is it because people want to pretend that they are normal and righteous? Cause, I have no problem with her oppressive ideals, you could even argue she had the right of it. MC's ideological resistance just came off as stubborn naivete to me. Besides, you get a loving waifu to rule the world with and build a functional (if not ideal) paradise together if all you do is agree with her? Not a bad deal by any means.  Do i need to watch Kill la Kill first before i can watch this?  <br>Yes.<br>And also Boku no Pico.</br></br>  <br>Because Lelouch used to sperg out whenever someone posted Esdeath a shit, it was amusing</br>  <br>Oh, okay. That's justification enough for me, fuck that guy.</br>  <br>Esdese being cute was nice, but it's not all that good.</br>  I never shook the feeling that whoever wrote the plot, didn't know in which direction it should go. "Written as we go" kind of vibe.<br><br>By the end it just seemed.. pointless. When Akame was alone in the end all i thought was "..okay?" it didn't really elicit any emotions.</br></br>  <br><br>No, this is the prequel to All You Need Is Kill.</br></br>  If you could spend a day with Esdese on a deserted island, what would you do?  <br>Penis in vagina, all the time.</br>  I'm glad all the wild cunts are dead. I wish they were never introduced in the first place and I still want my full Rider fight between Wave and Takumi.  <br> Implying she wouldn't be the one pegging you </br>  <br>It was fun, it could be better but not as bad as /a/ says.</br>  How do you feel knowing that Akane will never caress you or kiss you?  <br> Akane </br>  <br>She's never been dicked though. She might be curious.</br>  <br>I would dominate her with my D.</br>  <br>Yeah, fuck threads for discussing a show, let's talk about waifushit.</br>  <br>That is every AgK thread though, it's always about the waifus</br>  <br>Her body was made for nonstop fucking.</br>  <br>She has man face.</br>  <br> Unless there's somehow a worse punishment she can deliver than death he has nothing to lose. <br>Did you miss the fact that she's overseeing a torture facility?</br></br>  <br>I don't see it.</br>  <br>That manly chin.</br>  <br>It's been a year already? Wow, it feels like only a few months at best.<br><br>Well, it's a lot of wasted potential. It's a mediocre battle shonen with only two things going for it: gray morality and high mortality. It did deliver on high mortality (though pretty much everything surrounding Mine was bullshit, especially her teigu). As for the gray morality, it failed to deliver. Only Bols and Wave were sympathetic villains. Others were likeable, but clearly evil and they all had what's coming to them. I feel Seryu at the very least could've been fleshed out more.<br><br>As it stands, it's okay. Not really bad but not really good either. Esdeath is literally the only thing elevating this manga/anime above the level of pure mediocrity, and even then only slightly.<br><br>Also the anime was better than the manga. Budo jobbed even harder in the manga if that's even possible.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She will never fuck you every single day of your life <br> She will never push out a new child every 9 months for the next 20 years <br> She will never have your children compete among themselves for strength and honor <br> You will never have a squad of mini-Esdeaths under your command <br> They will never grow up into strong men and women and each conquer their own empires </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You speak of such beautiful things, anon.</br>  I can see that you might hate her but I don't believe you when you are telling me that you wouldn't fuck her until your dick bleeds.  First time that an anime original end is better.  <br>She should have been blonde, god damn.</br>  <br>Delicious Esdeath.</br>  <br>You insecure fuck</br>  Anyone got a proper scan of this? I need it for scientific purposes.<br><br>She sure is.</br></br>  <br> unzips </br>  <br> a women will never do this to you <br>why aren't we killing yet</br></br>  <br>blond is too boring, ice blue hair is great</br>  <br>/a/ hates it but makes and posts in countless threads about it.</br>  <br>I don't like hair colors that aren't natural on best girls.</br>  I felt nothing for any of the deaths except for  Bols . Then what happened after... shit that was rough.  <br>Cutest Pyro and his family deserved better.</br>  <br>And then they get raped and killed by a clown, I actually can't think of something edgier than that</br>  <br>There's always something edgier. And the fact that it was a clown that did it makes the whole thing funny.</br>  <br>I read every Champ line in Pennywises voice, it's hard to take it seriously</br>  <br>I wonder if Bors' family floats now.</br>  <br>They all float</br>  <br>Beep-beep Richie!</br>  <br> He died because he tried to help a wounded little girl <br>How horrible<br><br><br>Shut up, they're alive and honorong Bols' memory!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No anon. They're in the Deadlights now. And it's true what they say, they really all float down there.</br>  <br>You're too old to stop me</br>  <br>Champ was a real hero.</br>    <br>I'm going to pretend she's about to tickle my balls.</br>    <br>She's leading you to her bedroom.</br>  How is this shit-tier thread still not dead?  <br>My dick is too hard for that.</br>  <br>I'm going to pretend I'm in her love dungeon and she's going to tickle my balls while I'm helpless to stop her, and that is what she would prefer!<br><br>Forget it Jake. It's waifu town.</br></br></br>  HOW THE HELL IS THIS BITCH STILL ALIVE!  <br>She will do something creative in the next chapter. Believe it.<br><br> Anyways, I don't have any idea. </br></br></br>  <br>Slapstick can't kill you.</br>  <br><br> single Rakasha Demon outlives literally all of Wild Hunt <br><br>Anyone see that coming?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, Wild Cunt were shit jobbers where as she actually put up a fight</br>  <br>But what is the point? Will she do ANYTHING? Who will fight her?</br>  <br>To tell the truth if AgK was vn, her route would be the first I would do. Then Leone's.</br>  I prefer Akames body but Chelseas personality.<br><br>Doshiou?</br></br>  <br>Why do you have to talk shit m8?</br>  <br>I had hoped this wasn't your answer but it was<br> natural <br>you're complaining about naturality in an anime fighting shonen show?</br></br></br>  <br> Dorothea route <br> and finally it is revealed that the loli the MC loved is an old hag </br></br>  <br>it was supposed to be a VN, but goddamn it why the fuck did he made it into an anime<br><br>it was supposed ot be like this;<br><br>manga -&gt; VN - &gt; anime<br>not manga -&gt; anime -&gt; everybody hates it why bother making a VN<br><br>goddamn it goddamn it goddamn it fuck sake, this could have been the perfect thing to replace majikoi as their babymilking franchise</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> if AgK was vn <br><br>How the hell has this not happened yet</br></br></br>  <br>The VN actually could have been great<br> NR routes <br> Jaeger routes <br> A route where you wingman WavexKurome <br>What a waste</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>[x] take her right now</br>  <br>He made Esdeath 2.0 for his shitty VN instead, fuck Takahiro</br>  <br>Esdese 2.0 doesn't look as fuckable as Esdese. Sadly.</br>  Cringe worthy edgy shit, the only good thing was the chara design of Esdeath.  <br>She's nowhere near as interesting psychologically either, it's lazy as fuck. I don't really give a shit about Esdeath but man is 2.0 fucking boring</br>  <br>both versions are fucking boring.</br>  <br> fucking boring <br>You're wrong!</br></br>  <br>I don't like her either but at least there's a smidgon of complexity as poorly executed as it is</br>  <br> a route where esdeath wins and you somehow defeat the empire within or a bad end where you attempt that and you failed horrible and you'll be her boytoy forever </br>  <br> bad end <br> her boytoy forever <br>How is that bad again? In Starless marrying Marika was supposed to be a bad ending too, but it was the best ending. What is it that you people dislike about girls who love you with all their heart?</br></br></br>  <br> century old christmas cake alchemist loli <br><br>the word hag has shed its mortal coil and ascended</br></br></br>  <br>That's not love, that's control, and I'm not into femdom so it dosen't get me off</br>  <br>I could die happy if a mini esdeath came to me saying she conquered two empire for father's day.</br>  <br> That's not love <br>As far as I care, it is.</br></br>  <br>well, there are different types of femdom, the idea I just posted is just a possible outcome if you fail to convince her to break away from the empire, and she uses you as her dildo forever, or something</br>  Anime should have ended with Esdeses victory and Tastumi as fuck fuckboy on the throne.  <br>Sadly enough Kickstarter doesn't allow lewd stuff.<br>I would fund it so hard. <br>Minatosoft could make it non-h but that probably wouldn't even hit the goal.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm totally fine being a dakimakura for Esdeath.</br>  <br> your waifu will never use you as a daki, rubbing you off in the process, wrapping her legs above yours like a spider, pressing her boobs against your back and whispering lewd nothings into your ear while licking it <br><br>ASMD WHEN<br>I NEED IT NOW</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean ASMR? I need it too.</br>  <br>?</br>  <br>Let me tell you instead when I dropped it.</br>  <br>That shit was terrible.</br>  <br>But anon, that scene was meant to be comedic. At least I think it was.<br>I hope it was.</br></br>  You Esdese fags could always read Takahiro's Next VN With Dominant Women: Milking The Jackson Edition.<br><br>https://vndb.org/v16066</br></br>  <br>that was pretty generic. and disappointing. that part looked like it straight came from a naruto filler episode.</br>  <br>What a hack.</br>  Should've been a SoL.  <br> jackson <br>why<br>well it means hes working on something else, this show seems like like an offproject.</br></br></br>  <br><br>yeah sorry I ment ASMR<br><br>the only I can find is the one from momoyo, which is fantastic</br></br></br></br>  <br>Go on, keep it to yourself. It's not like anyone else wanted to hear it.</br>  <br><br> 1 year <br><br>Time sure flies</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, I actually lied. I dropped it a bit later. When all the other fighting scenes were just as bad. So I don't think it was comedic but rather staying true to the manga. This only works in manga when your brain fills the gaps and even then it's bad fighting.<br><br>I only read the first ~40 chapters of AgK for its edge appeal. When I noticed that the anime is pretty much exactly like the manga but insufferably slow, I gave up on it. If a manga is bad, you can just read very quickly and it's not that boring anymore. With an anime you can't do that to the same extent and watching quickly becomes an unpleasant experience.</br></br></br>  <br> Dominant women <br><br>The only dominant woman was Naruwa.
