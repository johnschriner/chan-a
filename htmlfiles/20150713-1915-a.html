Went in there last night just to check out their gunpla and, not only did they have some neat RG's MGs and even the minatures, but they have some hyperspecific manga and other weeb shit.. There was some unofficial Hatsune Miku manga that was like 150 pages long.  <br><br> It makes sense for to reach out through stores to manga fans, who are largely female and under the age of 22, as they may be more comfortable going to a traditional bookstore rather than a comic-book store, Salkowitz said. <br><br>-----<br><br> “Comic-book stores are still a male-dominated environment,” he said. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So a chance to meet cute grills?</br></br>  <br>I wonder if this means they're expanding their Gunpla selection as well.<br><br> 2025 <br> E-readers are as common as cell phones <br> B&amp;N survives by becoming a weeb store to cater to the rising anime &amp; manga audience in america. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> muh secret club </br>  <br>He's saying B&amp;N has more females shopping in it than a comic store would<br><br>Last I went to one in '11 there were like 3 fat females and 50 males, maybe that changed</br></br></br>  <br>The place I go to never has Gunpla and that makes me sad.</br>  I haven't paid for manga in almost 10 years, and I can't imagine I'd start again since the only manga I'm currently reading either have no English publication or have terrible localizations.  <br>Remember Rapelay?<br><br>Sure, it was an H-game, but it's still a valid concern.</br></br></br>  <br>But manga is big in the west alredy. Just because where you're from manga isn't big doesn't mean it's the case everywhere.<br>Here in France you can nearly get all the manga you want localized in the matter of months. And Italy have an even bigger scene with the world largest manga convention outside of Japan.</br></br>  <br>Buy the originals...?</br>  <br>I'm amazed that there hasn't been some sort of parental/feminist moral panic, then.</br>  <br> ... <br>Whats the point if he can't read them?</br></br>  <br>Why would I buy something I can't read?</br>  <br>By west, I assume he's referring to the Western Hemisphere/North America.</br>  <br>The only manga I'm not buying is Yuru Yuri and that's because it isn't localized. Buying manga is cheap as fuck and having the paper copies is always nice and better for the eyes than the computer screen.</br>  <br><br>Supporting the mangaka</br></br>  cool maybe now i can read some kekkai sensen  <br>Anon, France isn't the USA. As long as you're not discriminating against jews they won't freak out. I could go to my local manga store and buy loli doujins here in Montpellier.</br>  <br>Japan and France have a pretty tight cultural history going back many years, probably because of Disney. I imagine anyone living there just sees it as pretty normal. Americans don't get mad about the violence in movies from the 80s anymore, they're used to it.</br>  <br> B&amp;N survives by becoming a weeb store to cater to the rising anime &amp; manga audience in america. <br><br>I hope they convert some of their stores into Denki-gai Honya-san style where they sell nothing but comics and manga and PVC swags</br></br></br>  <br>I'd like to support the mangaka and buy something I can read.</br>  <br>That is true, but don't you think that the growing Muslim population might end up objecting to it?<br><br>Huh, I see.</br></br></br>  <br>It's because French bande dessinée are very similar to manga. The same can't be said for the American comics. Everyone grew up on Tintin. Manga is a logical progression.</br>  If I'm going to buyfag, it'll be an import so as to more directly support the creators. I don't get the point of supporting obsolete middlemen.<br><br>I have the scanlations, so I wouldn't even need to read the originals. Kind of silly to buy something only to let it collect dust on a shelf, but short of a direct donation to the author (not bothering with a physical copy) it'll have to do.</br></br>  <br>can't he do that by buying merchandise?</br>  <br>Buying manga used to be cheap, but tankobon are now around $12 a pop. It's not prohibitively expensive, but it's enough that I won't just pick up anything cause I want it.</br>  <br>learn to read moon</br>  <br>You can't learn Japanese</br>  Meh the nearest Barnes and Noble to me is about a 45 minute drive each way so I almost never go out there.  <br><br>but Japanese is easier and gives you better motivation than learning spanish!</br></br>  <br>Spanish would help me much more in my day to day life.</br>  <br>not with that attitude</br>  <br>You know 4chan is overestimating Muslims right? As long as you're not in Marseille you can not give a shit about them and live your life as always.<br>If anything it's the leftist that are worrying when it comes to Jap media.<br><br>I thought the 4€ a tank was the price everywhere. I guess 12$ is too much. I won't be buying manga at that price honestly.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kind of silly to buy something only to let it collect dust on a shelf <br> actually believing this </br></br>  <br><br>Are there really more women than men reading manga in the west? I find that hard to believe.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128011849 <br> necessary censorship <br><br>Maybe stuff aimed at a younger crowd like Yugioh and Naruto might get censored I don't know but none of the stuff I read does.</br></br></br>  <br>You underestimate fujos.</br>  <br>he was baiting</br>  <br>This is completely anecdotal, but I once visited my university's anime and manga club out of some sort of morbid curiosity and it was dominated by slightly chubby women in ill-fitting graphic t-shirts. From what I've seen, the fujo demographic is pretty real.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128011849 <br> If I'm going to buyfag, it'll be an import so as to more directly support the creators. I don't get the point of supporting obsolete middlemen. <br><br>and not to mention necessary censorship that happens during localization.<br>seriously, stuff like this is what's giving me the motivation to study jap!</br></br></br></br>  <br>And the point contained in your greentext is, what exactly?</br>  <br>if by cute you mean fat oily smelly fujoshits</br>  <br>E readers are more popular amongst normie readers. I highly doubt they will be THAT popular by that time. <br><br>Also that implies that reading as an activity will be common enough to be in every hand that has a cellphone</br></br></br>   Some of the most fun I had during my childhood was sitting in the manga section at B&amp;N for hours reading.   <br>No way. B&amp;N is dominated by women. Women, on average, are way more likely than men to read fiction as a hobby since they're not visually stimulated as strongly as men, who gravitate towards TV and video games. That's part of the reason fanfiction is almost entirely written by and for women.<br><br>Every time I've been in a B&amp;N, I see more older women than anything else.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Is America really this bad?</br></br>  <br> minimum wage worker detected. <br><br>Seriously, Spanish is only useful if you're a janitor, hotel cleaner, busboy &amp; kitchen worker here in America.<br><br>Get into a real career tier in /biz/ and tech sector and you'll see your Spanish usage come down.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> most fun I had during my childhood was . . . reading <br>Nerd alert.</br></br>  <br>It's great just so long as you never leave your house. But now they're trying to fuck that up too.</br>  This is pretty pretty awesome and will almost make up for the death of the much better (manga wise) Borders.  <br> here in America. <br>"here in California" you mean.</br></br>  <br> If anything it's the leftist that are worrying when it comes to Jap media. <br><br>explain further, please</br></br></br>  <br>Were you one of those people who sat down in the aisles? I'm all for sticking it to the man and reading shit you don't intend to buy, but go to a table or something. I'm sure as hell not going to peruse with someone else there.</br>  <br> And Italy have an even bigger scene with the world largest manga convention outside of Japan <br><br>I think you mixed up France and Italy here.</br></br></br>  <br>Nerds are awful everywhere, but America is glorious</br>  <br>I have this book.</br>  <br>It's about time. B&amp;N manga sections were always paltry compared to borders, and when borders went out of business there was no where else to go. To bad this change didn't happen 5 years ago when I actually would buy manga from stores. It doesn't really effect anything now.</br>  <br>Ooh, I remember visiting Borders when it was closing and they were having their fire sale. I'm a stingy motherfucker, but I bought 10 tanks.</br>  <br> bad <br>As in what, full of fujos? Presumably. The thing about sampling from anime clubs and the like is that your sample is going to be mostly of the sort of people who actually like participating in anime clubs, i.e. fujos and narutards. I've met a small handful of non-landwhale girls with non-shameful interests in anime and manga, but they're usually just as interested in concealing their powerlevels as you are.</br></br>  <br>There's manga in comic book stores? The few I've visited have all had about one small section of shelves dedicated to it.</br>  <br>Leftist in the EU wanted to ban graphic manga. It didn't pass but they will try it again anyways.<br><br>I don't think so. But maybe I'm wrong. Not the convention type of guy anways the only one I went to was Yuricon ages ago.</br></br></br>  <br>Left means Right in France.</br>  <br>  they're not visually stimulated as strongly as men <br>Source?</br></br>  <br>It has good states and bad states with good cities and bad cities just like everywhere else. <br>Oregon, Washington, Texas, Minnesota, and Montana are the best states though.<br><br>California, either Dakota, Chicago, New Mexico, and Florida are the worst. <br><br>Just stick near the goodies and avoid the shitties and you're golden.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The point this article makes is that there are more women than men reading manga at Barnes and Noble specifically. B&amp;N seems to think this is because comic shops are so male-centric that it intimidates the women, so they go to B&amp;N instead.</br>  <br> Are there really more women than men reading manga in the west? I find that hard to believe. <br><br>purely anecdotal but...<br><br>American geeky/otaku boys like us are adept at utilizing technology and we know how to navigate the internet to find vast libraries of manga and doujin... for free!<br><br>girls on the other hand can't into technology and internet outside facebook/twitter... so when they want their  yaoi manga fix they go to libraries and B&amp;N and Borders to acquire it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's still pretty fucking bad, Anon. Also, Chicago's a state now? They secede from Illinois?</br>  <br>you're retarded</br>  <br>I grew up impoverished so reading was the best free entertainment at the time. <br><br>Nah I usually took them to the nearest table or if there wasn't one a step ladder.</br></br></br>  <br>Obligatory</br>  <br>It's a state of emergency.</br>  <br> Oregon, Washington <br>Fuck yes!<br> Texas <br>Okay, you lost me.<br>California isn't that bad so long as you stay out of the big cities. West coast best coast.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop</br></br>  <br>Fuck Oregon</br>  <br> As California Goes, So Goes the Nation. </br>  <br>Why do you have to lump us with fucking California?<br>Maine is cool</br></br>  <br><br> There are people who thought this was acceptable to pout out in public. </br></br>  <br> Chicago's a state now <br><br>With how different Chicagoland is from the rest of Illinois it kind of feels like it.</br></br></br>  <br>They're doubling the size so the weebs can squeeze through the aisles again.</br>  <br>Northern Texas is great and most of the south is good too as long as you avoid all the meth heads. <br><br><br>Why don't you say that to Oregon's face, tough girl?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It is funny. It's like meta irony. No one can type that seriously.</br>  <br> oregon  <br> minnesota <br> montana  <br> good <br><br> california <br> bad </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Every time<br>Fucking Aussies<br><br><br> Texas <br> Okay, you lost me. <br>I live in small-city PNW so I'm sort of biased, but from what I've seen some parts of Texas (San Antonio) are pretty cool.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're the only state in the only country in the world that has "swamp niggers". <br><br><br> nigger spic liberal central <br> good </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Leftist in the EU wanted to ban graphic manga. It didn't pass but they will try it again anyways. <br><br>what type did they want to ban.<br>I feel for you EU-ians... you guys have no REAL Free Speech like America and Japan</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Florida <br>The South is shit in general and Florida is no exception. Georgia is also shit but Metro Atlanta and the surrounding suburbs are the best place in the South. It's a fun place all around and full of diversity. I also don't think there isn't a single demographic not represented here.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Borders was good, but second to Waldenbooks. Media Play was also surprisingly good, especially because of their rewards program that basically let you get a free tank for every 2 or 3 you bought.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't think I'd buy manga from them ever again, too many kids sit around reading the books and gunking them up. Rather buy online new or get a used one at Half Price Books, I am not paying full price for essentially a used book.</br>  Are there lewds?  <br>lel I never noticed, does it say biri biri under join now?</br>  <br> Free Speech <br> Japan <br>I don't want to turn this into a shithole /pol/ thread, but Abe and his nippon strong nationalist buddies have been working on that. I think I read a while ago that Japan dropped from top 10 to somewhere in the middle of some big index of press freedom in the last year.<br><br>We're also liable to see more efforts at regulating h material as a result of international pressure and desire to look good during the Olympics.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aren't manga usually in the plastuc tights? I'm pretty sure they can't have manga laying there on shelves for display.</br>  <br><br>I didn't get that impression. It seemed to me like they were saying manga readers in general skewed female and under 22</br></br>  <br>Next time I'm there, I will. The parts of the state that aren't nature preserves are full of startling levels of poverty and dumping grounds for annoying faggots from farther east and south.<br><br>Anyway, East&gt;West</br></br></br>  <br>If they fuck this up with censoring or American puritan bullshit I'll go straight back to pirating and importing. This is the fucking last time I'll give official manga a chance. I swear on my mum.</br>  <br> not attempting to shrink-wrap all incoming manga and magazine deliveries for the books store <br> murricans in charge of selling books and magazines in stores </br></br>  <br>Those aren't nature preserves dude, those are people's yards.</br>  <br>Nope, most aren't shrink wrapped so you can just pick a book off the shelf and read them.</br>  <br>Is this supposed to make me cringe or something? I would unironically laugh at it if I saw it in real life.</br>  <br>I visited my community college's anime club once and it was full of smelly neckbeards with two slutty hambeasts visibly hanging off of some of the slightly less disgusting ones. They began the meeting with a fanart slideshow on the projector that contained more than one image of ika getting tentacle raped. Then they went on to discuss how Hidan no Aria was the best show of that season. It was one of the most horrifying things I've ever been a part of.</br>  <br> American puritan bullshit <br>what the fuck are you on about</br></br>  <br>But isn't most manga 18+? I mean even Baku-On have full frontal nudity. How is it that they can have there for minors to see?</br>  <br>You don't read much manga, do you?</br>  <br>I would hate to be compared with California as well.<br> Produce the same fruits and vegetables as California <br> Objectively worse than California produce in every way <br>Central valley is GOAT</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really. I've only read maybe 50 completed ones.</br>  <br> We're also liable to see more efforts at regulating h material as a result of international pressure and desire to look good during the Olympics. <br><br>The so-called undesirable elements that can be found in Akibahara (otaku stores) and Roppongi (grey area prostitution) will just be swept under the rug for 2 weeks.<br><br>After that it will be business as usual.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How embarrassing.</br>  <br>I haven't been following this conversation, but a lot of the puritan ideals that America was founded on still have an effect on our culture today. Why do you think exposing children to gory violence is a normal affair, but one nip slip of a celb sends everyone into a panic?</br>  <br><br>Hey, Muslims were into Loli before it was even cool. Mohammad himself is the patron saint to lolicons everywhere.</br></br>  <br>Opposition to h, opposition to loli etc etc<br><br><br>I hope that turns out to be the case.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Loli isn't 3D</br>  <br>If you were a graphic designer you would cringe. <br> having a character take up more than 30% of your advertisement  <br> using informal speech and typing in an advertisement  <br> that awful white border  <br> the majority of the text is absolutely useless and gives potential members absolutely no indication of what to expect from the club other than roleplaying faggots <br><br>Which to be fair is likely all there is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is why /a/ hates anime/manga clubs (and conventions, for that matter).</br>  fucking niwaka scum  <br>Si t'es encore là tu peux me dire le nom du magasin si c'est une enseigne? Perso j'ai jamais vu de coin manga dans des Maisons de la Presse en banlieue Parisienne mais faut dire que je cherche pas vraiment aussi.</br>  <br>Anime clubs are pure cancer. Conventions on the other hand allow you to meet the hottest cosplaying chicks in your area. Step your game up and get that pussy.</br>  <br>Same. <br>B&amp;N used to have couches so I would just sit there and finish the whole of Death Note in one day.</br></br>    <br> not sitting on the ground cross-legged, blocking the entire aisle with your fat ass. </br>  <br><br>lefty international NGOs and the Japanese equivalents of dindu nuffin crowds there are pushing for EU-style speech regulation laws because of 2channel forum (Japanese reddit) users</br></br>  <br> wanting to attract casuals <br>But then again, <br> wanting an anime club at all <br>I think I get you though, if I were the kind of faggot that would take part in this, I would want something more accessible.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But I don't buy my manga there.</br>  <br> /gd/ on /a/ <br>Mah nigga</br></br>  <br><br>This guy gets it. Then somewhere along the line they added a fucking starbucks and everything pleasant about reading fell into place. <br><br>B&amp;N is the closest thing to a manga cafe we have here in the states.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I hope that turns out to be the case. <br><br>That's just how the Japanese NPA rolls!</br></br></br>  <br>Nice too see something that isn't Company X shuts down.</br>  <br>Eh, the anime club was okay at my Uni, probably because everyone at the school were all fairly nerdy in the smart way rather than the cringe. Besides, an autist here or there, it was 20 something people watching a couple shows together. <br>I stopped going after a couple weeks since there wasn't really any socialization as everyone was either glued to the screen or doing homework.<br>Anyways, anime clubs don't necessarily have to be cancer but they're pretty useless in my opinion.</br></br></br>  <br>No, if I had to run an anime club at all it would be as professionally done and clinical as possible. It would be nothing but fat men in suits sitting at tables examining manga under gemcutter glasses and sorting them into order of highest quality to worst based on content, paper quality, and thickness. We would have sixteen 4TB external hard drives all hooked up to multiple computers and everyone would be constantly downloading anime from every source and sorting it into first raws of various quality, then subs of various quality, and finally dubs of various quality - alphabetically. <br><br>Then the experimentations would begin. My anime club would be the anime CERN.</br></br></br>  <br><br>fuck anime clubs <br><br>cultural/nationality clubs  like Japanese club  is where the real fun is at without degeneracy!</br></br></br></br>  <br> blogging <br>Confirmation yet again why /a/ hates clubs.</br></br>  <br><br> Friends want to check out anime club at Uni begining of freshman year <br> "No that sounds fucking awful and nothing good can come from it." <br> They agree <br> We all go anyway <br> Come in as they are watching Hellsing Ultimate (Dubbed of course) <br> Hey this isn't that bad really <br> It end and the president of the club walks to the front  <br> He is sporting fox ears, a fox tail, and a large wrench  <br> This begins "President time" where he talks to us for 30 minutes about dumb shit  <br>Remember anons every bad thing you heard about anime club is true and only pain and regret can come from visiting it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> calling the south shit <br> saying metro atlanta is good <br> diversity <br><br>I think your red hair dye is rotting your brain, tumblrina. The south is amazing. Most big southern cities are crime ridden shitholes but the south is awesome.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dans Montpellier : Azimuts ou Ikoku.<br>Pour toute la France tu peux voir cette page : http://www.nautiljon.com/boutiques/<wbr></wbr></br></br>  Does this mean they'll start selling a greater variety of manga, or will it just mean more shonenshit? I'd be nice to Tezuka, Mizuki, Tatsumi, etc. on their shelves. These manga do get localized, but I rarely see them in public, save for specialized comic stores.  What happens if anime and manga begin to attract the same crowd who love Capeshit but only like it at a surface level to appear OH SO NERDY XD? Even more than it does.  <br>Hopefully this means more Yuri manga gets localized. Because for some reason no one bothers getting those in stock.</br>  <br>Oh wow, Nautiljon. J'avais oublié ce que ce site existait.<br><br>Merci beaucoup!</br></br></br>  <br> Hopefully this means more Yuri manga gets localized <br>Na, that's just more trash. We don't need that stuff.</br></br>  <br>I would join that, the problem would be finding people less autistic than you, which is most likely impossible  and already takes me out of the candidacy for potential members. </br>  <br>But it's true. The only decent southern states are Georgia and North Carolina with Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana being extra shit. The urban areas are the only places that are worth going to or living. The only appeal to the rural south is for INNAWOODS types, in which case they are probably too dumb to notice there is nothing to do in bumfuck nowhere</br>  <br>People would join out of good will as we would provide a much needed service to the community: People could bring in their anime and manga and have them examined by a professional fat autistic nerd who would then rate its quality and tell them the value of it for free.</br>  <br>but all little girls want to join clubs, and they seem like lots of fun in these cartoons</br>  <br>Why isn't there more F&gt;EN translations you cunts.</br>  <br>The healthy fujos hide their power levels, so they're the most unlikely to show up to a public setting.</br>  This won't end well. Anime and manga is catching on very hard in the west and it's only going to increase the post-Olympics culture hysteria.<br><br> OH MY GOD THESE ARE THE JAPANESE COMICS ALL THOSE KIDS ARE READING?

It used to be sorted by publisher, and then within that alphabetically by title. As a comic fan I prefer the publisher way, but if I'd never heard of Wolverine and wanted to read him, I'd check the 'W' so maybe it will work. <br> Graphic novels are by far our most shoplifted product. Also our most "tore off the plastic" product and there are a ton of assholes who will write down the digital code in the back of the trade paperbacks then enter it on their tablet right in front of the section, and then put the book back and leave. <br>Analog Piracy on the Rise.

Also I was there this week and  literally no Berserk on the shelf.   <br> Sacrebleu! You ignorant Americans! </br>  <br>I have seen the Haruhi light novels in the "M" part of the manga section, the "H" part of the manga section, and the fucking  Teen Paranormal Fiction  section, which is sorted by the Author's last name.</br>  Yes, your dying stores really could use an expanded section for assholes to sit on the ground and read shit in.

Superhero films are selling way too well for Hollywood to ditch them. There will be a few movies, but that's probably it.

Kinda embarrassing tbh.</br>    <br>Because little girls dont order lewd figures, also dont forget to preorder the 2015 Figure of the Year™.</br>  <br>With the amount of unique items they have, with stock constantly changing, having an actual person translate it isn't viable.</br>  <br>What's this, free shipping?</br>  <br>I feel like I should get more horse sluts to go with Celia, but I really don't care about the series.</br>  <br>normalfag please</br>  <br>Would this be considered lewd?

That one is pretty high quality though so it's tempting.</br>  <br>You better listen or you won't get any chicken tendies tonight.</br>    <br> not wanting to lick the velvety skin <br><br>what kind of faggot are you?</br></br></br>  <br><br>I agree, but where do you draw the lewd line? Swimsuits? Tits out? Most figures are a bit lewd.</br></br>  <br>I don't think swimsuit figures are lewd in generally, unless they're presenting.<br><br>But they usually get filtered by the boringness threshold anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>Ok mom, but can you please stop insulting my Pochaco collection, shes not fat just horizontally challenged and I like that.</br>  <br>I'm so fucking sick of hair seams</br>  <br> oppai mousepads any worse than figs. </br>  <br>Get good at garage kits.</br>  <br>Imagine all the great figures that could have been bought with that money instead of that fat garbage</br>  <br>Who dis?</br>  <br>YOU'RE RUINING MY LIFE</br>  Anyone know a place that's taking the z-ton centaur pillow preorders still, or is it just amiami?  <br><br>Imagine the figures that could have been made with all that plastic.</br></br>  <br>you already asked that previous thread and got your answer</br>  <br>And the oil that could have been kept underground.

That pose is impossible, especially for her. Her ass is almost at the same height as her tits.</br>  <br>fine.

I genuinely believe there are just a couple of them who want to shit up the thread as much as possible.  Anyone here assembled a garage kit? How much of a pain in the ass is it, if at all?  <br> that doesn't really answer the question <br><br>also none of the sites listed even have it either.</br></br></br>  <br>Just discuss something else instead of metashitting.</br>  <br>I'd like to fuck my cat.</br>  <br>Is her figure not based on that image?</br>  <br>Careful anon, as the saying goes, there are more ways of killing a cat than choking it with cream.</br>  <br>She looks amazing, it's just her breasts that are ugly.</br>  <br>Contacted PETA, you're going away for a long time scumbag.</br>  <br>Do you have steady fingers?

It's a/fit/ meme.</br>  <br>I pretty much order lewd things exclusively. But I've had to significantly cut back on my spending now that I moved to a new place. Money is sadly ridiculously tight right now.<br><br>Still have these girls on order though. Football Pochaco should be here on Monday or Tuesday too.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw only 7x5 </br>  <br><br>I've built a few. It depends totally on the kit.</br></br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br>Fag.</br>  <br><br>I remember there used to be this cat that lived in an alley that would always come up to me and get pet. Holy fuck she was a slut. She would sit and my lap and I would get a boner and she would rub her ass against it, she would get on her back and spread her legs, bend over and try to show off her ass. I wanted to creampie that cat but obviously I would have killed it if I tried. Are all cats this slutty?</br></br>  <br>I'm as white as it's possible to be without being ginger or an albino.</br>  <br>Bottom left is the only one of those that doesn't look like shit.</br>  <br>Awful.</br>  I bought some display case things for my nendoroids.  <br> top right <br>Her abdomen looks like a noodle.</br></br>  <br>How much were they?</br>  <br>Take your blogshit to </br>  <br>Your nendos look so dead in that picture. They remind me of those butterfly collection showcases.</br>  <br>wow i didn't even know this was a board.</br>  <br>Resize already. People told you so often and you still don't remember to do it.</br>    pew pew  <br>$10 at the container store. <br><br>Well they are dead. I think they look fine this way. <br><br>Sorry, anon. I'm on an iPhone and I did the best I could by cropping it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>    <br>I don't understand people like you, can you not contain your excitement over posting your shitty picture to get to a computer first and resize and touch it up there?</br>  <br>I don't understand autistic people like you. Is you're internet really so shit that you have to complain about the size of photos? Is it that hard to just not complain about it? I post large photos just to trigger autistic fucks like you.</br>  <br><br>We've gone over this many times, groups of nendos together naturally gravitate towards standing blankly in a row. Its hard to do interesting things with them.</br></br>  <br>Do you really think there's nothing wrong with posting a shitty oversized picture like that ?</br>  <br>Nendos are trash.</br>  <br>That's the only reason I kind of want to buy all the sword nendos. It'd look pretty great putting them all in attack mode and displaying them in a formation.</br>  <br>Not really, no. I don't mind large photos.</br>  <br>At least the filesize is ok. I don't mind the resolution if the filesize is fine.</br>  <br><br>Same reason I'm getting all the Kancolle nendos, they look fun ganging up on attacking Re and Wo.</br></br>  <br>Pochaco is Perfection</br>  <br>I'd marry a girl that looked like her in a second.</br>  <br>Potaters gonna potate. This is a lovely collection anon. I need to get that kneeling Pochaco one of these days.</br>  <br>All of that useless fat disgusts me to no end.</br>  <br>It's not useless. It's for fucking. Fuckmeat</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br>Their heights are listed on their respective pages, you know. And besides the height, the styles will be very different.</br>  <br>where2cop?</br>   tfw you own more "large breasts" figures than most people own figures in total   <br> Not wanting to get into all those crevices.  <br>Get a load of this faggot.</br></br>  <br> Belly button <br><br>L-lewd</br></br></br>  So what's the deal with these two? Kahotan's twitter said that they were being sold at a Haikyuu event, but will they'll get a GSC online shop release too?  <br><br>I am married to a girl like Pochaco. It is true that this is the post perfectly fuckable body type.</br></br>   that shitass First GE episode <br> those pre-orders <br>Aragami figures literally never. Fucking kill me.</br></br>  <br>FUCKING NORMALFAGS LEAVE FUCKING LEAVE<br>REEEEEEEEEEE</br></br>  when?  will you?  <br>This is a garage kit right?|</br>  <br>I can't even begin to imagine the inner turmoil you feel on a daily basis when you see a fine thick ass.</br>  <br>Nope</br>  <br> anime of imako <br> by queen bee <br><br>oy vey</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have never seen a Macross figure this lewd before. Good thing I like Sheryl more out of the Frontier girls.<br><br>Beta-san is ordered, but I'm still on the fence with D'Artagnan. I never really cared for her as a character, but I like how they did her clothes and sword, and Alter hasn't disappointed me on a single Nishi design except Senhime's Succubus fig.</br></br></br>  I got some scales, am I cool yet?<br><br>Limitgunz was only $25</br></br>  <br>You do realize that like 20+ people here have Amakuni's Momohime preordered, right?</br>  <br>Pain in the arse regarding customs.<br><br>I'd probably get more if I had my own place. Lewds seem like where people I live with would draw the line.</br></br></br>  <br>I have no problem with the concept of lewd figures. They just don't make any that appeal to my tastes. Most of them of grotesquely huge breasts (I'm fine with up to an D-cup), a lot of the outfits are ridiculously gaudy, and the faces are often ugly (although the one in your picture is good).</br>  <br>you posted this last thread</br>  This is my line of lewd. Anything cast-off is a no-go. But things like this are fine. However, if it's loli, I think exposed flat chests are far less offensive and displaying figures like Mordina is fine.  <br>That's pretty lewd dude. Way too lewd for me.</br>  <br>I really want a scales of them in their work uniforms. Also nendos, especially for Rize</br>  <br>What about this? What's your condition of lewd?</br>  <br> Anything cast-off is a no-go <br>She's cast off. It's the reason the swimsuit looks so terrible.</br></br>  <br>Re-read what I said.</br>  Question<br><br>When I see the stock images for a figure and some of the images contain removed items of clothing or bare breasts, does that mean you can remove some pieces of clothing or do they sell extra parts you have to buy for that?</br></br>  This Pochaco fig when? I love huge breasts in yukata.  <br>It'll include everything shown, whether its removable or separate pieces that you can swap out.</br>  <br>Great, thanks.</br>  <br>Never, they don't make Pochaco figs without exposed breasts and thighs.</br>  <br>If I take the clip off would she still be fat?</br>  What kind of packaging does Big in Japan use? Is it similar to the plain "FRAGILE" boxes amiami uses?  <br>It would be extremely painful.</br>  <br>There's no anime girl or anything weird on it if that's what you're worried about. Just a box.</br>    <br>That is one good looking figure.</br>  <br>Figure soon..</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12799885 <br>but sadly too small.</br>  <br>Look at those feet. That's slimmer than some Sonico figures.</br>  <br>That is a Sonico figure.</br>  <br>it's based on that image</br>  <br>Regular brown box with a generous amount of newspaper filling and some bubble wrapping.</br>    When will pirate sento be shown?  <br>That explains it. What a shame, slim Pochaco is cute.</br>  So GSC decided to ignore their own poll to justify their higher prices by buying through them?  <br>It's shit.</br>  <br>Not soon enough</br>  Want to buy this, but I don't know anything about Revolve.  <br>we already know that, scram.</br>  <br>That tail connection looks awful.</br>  <br>yup.</br>  <br>What was the poll?</br>  <br>Me either but I love that hair</br>  <br><br>Do lewd doujins count? Lewd figures for the most part just seem pretty shit.</br></br>  <br>Thats probably the least disgusting porkchoco I've seen. Still wouldn't buy tho</br>  <br>Odango a cute</br>  <br>Wait till after wonderfes, better looking kiniros might be announced. <br> I'm hoping for a good scale of aya. </br></br>  <br>too skinny would not buy</br>    <br>I disagree.</br>    I don't know the character either, but she looks beautiful.  <br>She's a fucking bitch. That's what she is.</br>  <br>Too bad she's dead.</br>    <br>Waiting to see GSC color theirs.</br>  <br>Please understand.</br>  <br><br><br>at least you should have put spoilers, you people are awful.</br></br></br>  <br>that looks amazing too, is she 1/8?</br>  <br>They cover their boxes in loli scat h manga pages and have a special barcode on them so when they go through sorting at the terminal they get scanned and an alarm will go off that suddenly yells "ahahahaha get a load of this loser [your name] ".</br>  <br>The show aired last season, there's no excuse for not knowing who she is. That's what you get for being retarded.</br>  <br>Not all of us are nerds that watch anime 24/7. Some of us have backlogs.</br>  <br>Well I don't watch anime :/ .</br>  <br>I'm not even asking you to watch it, just to know who she is. <br>When you post comments like that you're pretty much asking for it.</br></br>  <br>If you've ever looked through the catalog these past months or so you would have known. I haven't watched it and I knew.</br>  <br>my response was this one </br>    <br>Careful</br>  <br>I saw the wrong figure, then. Looks nice.</br>    <br>Sell me her body? 200 bucks.</br>  <br>GG is shit, could not even finish the first episode.</br>  <br>This is not the thread for that.</br>  <br> Dropping it before zombies </br>  <br><br>That body would sure look good covered in hotglue...</br></br>  <br><br>I'm amazed you think anyone would give a shit about the opinion of someone like you.</br></br>  <br>Good for you anon. I'm sure there's somebody out there who cares!</br>  <br>Plastic Gurashis when</br>  <br>I did. Your statement is inconsistent with the picture that you say is "fine".</br>  <br>Yeah I got confused too.</br>  <br>that's the whole purpose of that fig, I wonder I should order her, the bad thing is that I would have to order her on my mom's name.</br>  <br>Looks like you're just shit at picking up context.</br>  <br><br>I found two people who care about his opinion.</br></br>  <br> I want a Miki figure but shovel knight is ok </br>  <br>is that a dude?</br>  <br>Re-read it again. Do I really have to spell it out for your secondary English speaking ass?</br>  <br><br>If it's cute, does it matter?</br></br>  <br> anything cast-off is a no-go, but things like this cast-off are fine <br> matter of context <br>No, it's a matter of either not using your words correctly to get an idea across, or you being retarded. Look up the word "anything" if you care to improve yourself, or perhaps throwing in the word "usually" in the first part would have cleared it up.</br></br></br>  <br>Can you read?</br>  <br>I think he meant the cast off figures are better when their clothing parts aren't off. Basically, the picture.</br>  <br>Well Celia has a pretty nice body too but I havent seen any hotglue pics or vids of her.<br>I also might just end up getting her for hotglue purposes, that body should not go uncovered.</br></br>  <br>"If the figure is cast-off (past tense), it's no-go. But things like this (picture) are fine. I think exposed flat chests [compared to exposed breasts] are far less offensive"</br>  When?  <br>just let it go.</br>  <br>If he had written that, there would have been no confusion. As I said, the word "anything" being used was not the best choice.</br>  <br>No point passing the blame for your inability to grasp context. You're in the wrong here.</br>    <br>I should feel bad, but  he was ok with the region lock </br>  <br>I think I could never cum on a scale, maybe on a prize but definitely not on a proper scale,</br>  What's on the way to you at the moment? <br><br>I picked up a couple of Sonico prize figures but otherwise nothing else I'm waiting on has shipped.</br></br>  <br>I only made the two posts suggesting not to have used the word anything, but okay big boy.</br>  <br>"Has been cast-off" would have been correct, not "is cast-off".</br>  <br>Only selvaria</br>  <br>Okay, that makes sense. It's confusing because in normal usage saying a figure is "cast off" refers to the fact that the figure can be cast off, whether or not the clothing has been removed.  should have just said "Anything nude is a no-go."</br>  <br><br>I didn't know what you guys were talking about. At first I thought he was fired or something.</br></br>  Is this lewd?  <br> overlapping bases <br><br>No, it's shit</br></br></br>  <br>This fatty should be home in a few days, cant wait to cover her mammaries in my man juice</br>    <br><br>I didn't realise I wanted a garters-chan figure until just now.</br></br>  <br>This set up makes me want to puke.<br>Please remove that base from overlapping the other.</br></br>    <br><br>That sakura looks so retarded. What a shitty setup. Don't you have room for wall shelves or something?</br></br>  <br>I only did that because Medaka was covering too much Sakura for the pic.</br>  <br>That girl on the right from gundam or some sunrise anime?</br>  <br>Oh its okay then, you should get a better place to keep them though, that shelf looks ugly and clashes terribly with them.</br>  <br><br>Are you displaying two of the same figure?</br></br>  <br>I have little room and too many figures :/</br>  <br><br><br>This looks bad, cluttered, your bases are overlapping and makes you look like a 10 year old who leaves his toys anywhere. <br><br>From the looks of it, its a very narrow shelf and I bet you can only look at them from the front, leaving many things to be seen. <br><br>Also, mixing scale heights and lewds with regular figures just makes it look stupid too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it's the same I moved it with the bigger ones.</br>  <br> shitty setup <br> one piece <br> emoticons <br>poetry</br></br></br></br>  <br>End yourself or buy a fucking display already, you could have bought a couple of simple planks and some hangers with the price of any of your figures and your whole collection would fit on it.</br>  <br><br><br>I know, I'll buy this one, next month.</br></br></br>  <br>You still have shit taste.</br>  <br>That's a nice cabinet, Anon</br>  <br>is the color bad?, there aren't much options where I live.</br>  <br>I mean your collection.</br>  <br> wheels <br>absolutely haram</br></br>  <br>Nice one.

I really don't want to miss out on the upcoming Lupin III prize figures. The first one is up on HLJ now, but there are still 3 more announced.  <br>Not really that I can tell. Your best bet would be to follow comments on MFC and hope somebody posts the link, or hlj post it themselves.</br>  Anyone know how the 3.0 Evangelion Real Action Hero figs came out, especially Rei? I hear it can be a hit or miss with RAH.  <br>I'll probably do those. I'm also checking Banpresto's recent releases daily. I lucked out and found the first Lupin figure today. These prize figures sell out quick.</br>  Does anyone here have the Dragon's Crown elf? How is she?  Ended up doing it on canvas instead of framing it. Came out decent enough hopefully  <br>It's conflicting. I like the idea of materials used on figs but it looks like really loose skin. Like the plug suit didn't shrink right.</br>  <br>I had Asuka Q (battle damaged) RAH, and to be honest, it was a bit shit. I think it being crappy for me has a lot to do with the plugsuits not being very pose friendly. The fabric is very tight and I worried just slight movement would rip it. I tried to the poses on her box and I couldn't. Then again maybe I got a fluke one with shitty joints.<br><br>tl;dr<br>My experience was it's a jointed doll that will stand in a boring position, with a real clothing gimmick.</br></br></br></br>  finally the cast-off pictures, pretty sure this is the best pochaco so far  <br>Sales tax? Are you a britbong or is there some extra prices that an amerilard should be concerned about.</br>  <br>10/10 would  ejaculate on then feel immediate regret, clean her off then ejaculate on again </br>  <br>GSC doesn't remove Japanese sales tax from their international store. So instead of just paying the full base price, you pay that plus 8%.</br>  <br>Well shit, guess they have to justify their shitty pre order bonuses somehow.</br>  <br><br>Neither does Amico or any store aside from Manda and Amazon, so complaining about it is dumb. <br><br>Also, the tax is usually like 300 yen so you're even more dumb to complain about $2 extra.</br></br></br></br>  <br>BiJ, HLJ and HS and CDJ don't include the sales tax. AmiAmi usually has enough of a discount to essentially get rid of the sales tax.<br><br>And the amount of the tax depends on the base price. Something that costs 15k isn't going to have 300 yen tax, it's going to be 1200.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Good thing we're talking about a 4k Nendo and not a 15k scale. My point is that complaining about having to pay that tax is dumb because it is already included in literally everything you purchase, Amico elevates the retail price and then offers a good discount so people don't notice, BiJ usually charged the same as Amico, HS, HlJ and CDJ can charge anywhere from 1 to 3k more that both Amico and BiJ, so at the end of the day it doesn't matter if they tell you "nuh uh we're not charging you any tax!" because you're already paying more.</br></br>  <br>I hope it's easy to get her to hold something else instead of the handegg.</br>  <br><br>I'm not sure if the nipple plasters make it better or worse.</br></br>  <br><br>well, her nipples are kinda meh</br></br>  <br> My point is that complaining about having to pay that tax is dumb because it is already included in literally everything you purchase <br>Oh I see, you just don't know what you're talking about.<br>BiJ, HLJ, HS and CDJapan DO NOT include sales tax in their pre-discount prices.<br>AmiAmi DOES NOT elevate the retail price, they take the base price + 8% tax (which is what you'd see at GSC's store) and then apply their discount, which generally puts them on par with BiJ's prices.<br>The other stores simply have smaller discounts, but they are still not charging sales tax. At no point are you paying more at any of these stores than you would at GSC's. Usually you're paying less.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>front view</br>  <br>The bandaids wouldn't be so bad if they didn't look so fake.

Of course complaining about it isn't going to change anything, but it's normal to not be happy over the idea of spending more money unnecessarily. The system is the way the system is, and discounts can often cover the fee, but that doesn't mean a person has to agree with it.<br><br><br> it's fine since the consumer doesn't notice it and is paying it already <br>You are one hell of a little bitch.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>October's going to fucking suck.<br>Not looking forward to paying 10% tax for proxy/forwarding stuff to a nation I don't live in.</br></br>  <br><br>Wait are they fucking raising sales tax again?</br></br>  <br>Definitely better without. 11/10 would  tenderly love </br>  <br>Loyalty</br>   buy Japanese shit <br> pay 10% tax <br> UK customs shows up <br> they want 20% </br></br></br>  <br>Why are Walkure Romanze designs so good?

I wonder if anybody customized this fig to look like Chino yet.</br></br>  <br>That's why you use the site in Japanese.</br>  <br>Thanks for reminding me how much I absolutely hate when some retard drops a google translation of raw manga spoilers.</br>  <br>Amazon takes off the tax.</br>  Was there a more pointless character in anime ever?  Nikki and Paulo from LOST  <br>Pointless? No.<br><br>Walking plot device? Yes.</br></br></br>  <br>He was introduced way too late and had zero development. Shinji's depression could've been played differently if he didn't exist.</br>  <br> pointless <br>He's pretty much the reason why so many males in Japan are closet homo and therefore why the birth rate is so fucking low. Thanks a lot, Anno.</br></br>  <br>He's not really supposed to have character development. He's a foil to Shinji, representing an ideal self. (Shinji's infatuation with him contrasts with his inability to love himself)<br><br>Kaworu makes sense if you think of him as the last "monster of the week" and not as a love interest for Shinji. All of the latter angels take their psychological toll on the cast, usually through some sort of mind rape. Kaworu on the other hand ultimately damages Shinji simply by loving him.</br></br></br>  <br> as the last "monster of the week" and not as a love interest for Shinji <br>But he's both of those things.</br></br>  <br>Still, I think Anno would've tried to extend his interactions with Shinji and other characters a bit more if he had more budget available. 3.0 kinda tried to fix that part, but failed at everything else.</br>  <br>Kaworu was originally supposed to be around for 2-3 episodes, the drafts reflect that. They had to cut it short, but I don't think the impact of the episode is invalidated or is lacking in any way despite Kaworu not really having much depth. He had more than enough for a minor character with that amount of screentime, in my opinion.</br>  <br><br>I think Kaworu had just enough screentime in NGE. Rebuild on the other hand just shows how shallow Kaworu is as a character.<br><br>As a plot device he works; as a major character he just doesn't. There's only so much you can do with a character designed to be "perfect" like him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree they really dropped the ball with Rebuild. Not so much because they gave him more screentime, but the fact that they didn't do anything new with him that could make him an interesting character. He's just the same old Kaworu from NGE in a different situation, which was a character that relied on a small amount of screentime to work. They should have had him interact with other characters or do something to be an intriguing character. But they fucked up, along with everybody else in 3.0.<br> designed to be "perfect" like him <br>An extremely naive and suicidal being fueled by instinct rather than rational thought isn't exactly perfect.</br></br></br>  <br>You know what I'm saying. On the surface he looks like a perfect husbando.<br><br>Aside from the fact that he's pants on head retarded of course. (possibly justified because Angels don't have the fruit of knowledge or whatever)</br></br></br>  <br> On the surface he looks like a perfect husbando. <br>Just like how on the surface Asuka looks like a bitch and how on the surface Shinji looks like a pussy. The only one who thought Kaworu was the perfect husbando was Shinji blinded in love, on the other hand, Misato was quick to point out his flaws at the end of the episode. <br><br> pants on head retarded <br>It makes sense. The other angels weren't exactly intelligent either besides a few tricks here and there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He wasn't pointless for my dick</br>  itt: people who dont understand eva and never will  <br>How is he pointless? He's Adam, the father of all the Angels.<br><br>Do you even fucking Eva?</br></br></br>  <br>To some people, any character that isn't a cute moe girl is pointless.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128004387 <br>That terrorist from the second season of GitS SAC. He's the female MC's love interest.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128004387 <br>nope</br>  <br>Irule hacked Nerv harder than Seele could with five other Magi systems and adapted to attacks as they happened, Kaworu was dumb even among angels.</br>  <br>Kaworu was smart enough to create Irule into acting that way.</br>  <br>Yes, it was even in the same series.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>No wonder why they're in so many pictures together.</br>  Kaworu for Shinji is the embodiment of a total external validation. Karl-kun isn't someone capable of a human relationship because he's obviously not human and doesn't have the same type of personality, psychology that we do. <br><br>He's a poor replacement for actual self-worth (In terms of Shinji), which is what the series is trying to say I think.</br></br>  <br> he's obviously not human <br>Even though he was as human as me?</br></br>  <br>He wasn't! He wasn't! He wasn't!<br>Kaworu was an Angel. He was one of the enemy!</br></br>  <br><br>Episode 25 was amazing. I loved the way it started out.</br></br>  <br>Wow, thanks asshole.</br>  <br>I didn't wanna kill you! I didn't have a choice.<br>Otherwise we would have all died, we would have all been destroyed!</br></br>  <br><br>get a room you fucking fudge packing fags</br></br>  <br>No, the one who deserved to survive was the one with the will to make it happen.<br>He wished for death. He ignored his will to survive and chose to die for a false hope.<br>Your survival is not a mistake Shinji.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you sure?</br></br>  <br> chose to die for a false hope <br> literally died for the lilin's future and survival <br>Misato, you dumbass.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretending you're sacrificing yourself is just another cope out. It makes you feel so special to play the martyr. It satisfies you twisted little mind.</br>  <br>Don't be mean to him! He did nothing wrong! He was...so much better than I was, he deserved to be the one to survive. Not me!</br>  The Manga handled him much better.  <br>You can't be serious.</br>  <br>I am being serious, him being introduced earlier on was an improvement.</br>  <br>The manga made him a creeper who got bitchy at people for not liking him. It's the best he's ever been.</br>  <br>Doesn't really mean anything when he's given just a clusterfuck of Asuka and Rei's arcs from 20 chapters ago. Plus being completely cut out and irrelevant once the EoE segment hits.<br><br><br>It doesn't make sense for the mother of angels, Adam, to act like a bitchy teenager on her period. It's the worst he's ever been if we pretend 3.0woru isn't a thing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>he's not LITERALLY Adam, anon. He's an angel that carries the soul of Adam. Adam is attached to Gendo's hand</br>  <br>It doesn't make sense for Adam to have any approximation of a human personality at all. Kaworu is as distinct from that as Rei is from this, a shell formed around alien salvage.</br>  <br> he's not LITERALLY Adam, anon. <br>Yes, he is literally Adam. In Eva, the soul is everything. Just like Unit 01 is literally Shinji's mom and Rei is literally Lilith.<br> Like a jimensou, Kaworu's upper body emerges from around the base of Gendo's thumb.[22]  <br> This in turn transforms into a smiling Rei.  <br> Gendo: "Adam is taking on Lilith's form."  <br><br><br> any approximation of a human personality at all <br>Which is why Anime Kaworu works and Manga Kaworu doesn't. Anime Kaworu is very inhuman and alien in all his mannerisms and words. Manga Kaworu is just a mini-Asuka.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, he is actually Adam. The way we see him in episode 24 is just the way he perceives himself, same as with Rei. When Rei merges with her body, Lilith, it takes on her shape. When she absorbs Adam's embryo from Gendo's hand, it takes on Kaworu's shape as we see when he comes to tang Shinji.</br>  <br>This wasn't any more of an inscrutable alien consciousness. This is also a maladjusted human teenager, one that doesn't get Keel's ominous puns.</br>  <br> This is also a maladjusted human teenager <br>Kaworu is literally by definition and as described as just Adam trapped in a human lilin body, everything he says is of his own consciousness and perception as such. He never once refers to himself as a lilin or any part of them, he's just been put in the body of one more or less against his will. The EoE script as cited in the previous describes him as Adam as Lilith is Rei and as Unit 01 is Yui. In Rebuild he even calls himself the first angel for you. <br>Animeworu acts as you would expect an alien who knows Japanese to act. All-knowing yet curious of human nature, speaking in phrases hard to understand, ultimately clueless to human social cues and emotions. Manga Kaworu is just male Asuka, pretty bland.</br></br></br>  <br>Manga Kaworu has more of less been humanized and acts nothing like you would expect an alien to act. Just like a whiny little child. He even has pupils, unlike Anime Kaworu who doesn't. Everything about Anime Kaworu is unseemy, a bit creepy, alien, and incomprehensible from looks to mannerisms. Manga Kaworu has none of these traits, we even hear his thoughts quite often; which allows him to be relatable and sympathized with; completely ruining the foreign atmosphere that Anime Kaworu so easily gave off. It's just all around pretty bad, in my opinion.</br>  <br>The point was that he was the only one who loved Shinji unconditionally, but since he was an angel and Shinji an EVA pilot he had to kill him.</br>  Holy shit, has there ever been a worst Opening song than Parasyte's?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yy1<wbr>BShbtVOQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I mean, FUCK.<br>I dare you, /a/.</br></br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=U1Y<wbr>Hr_CUiJ8</wbr>  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YBh<wbr>sDtFUgdM</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Both of Brynhildr's openings</br>  <br>Yeah its pretty fucking awful</br>  <br>/thread<br> Fucking Madhouse. </br></br>  Parasyte's op isn't tbad though.<br>It's not even Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' worst op either.</br>  <br>op 1 was god tier you pleb<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=581<wbr>yuUMGQPE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Jesus christ that's horrible, I don't even remember that one.

There is none, it's such a broad term that it may as well be discarded as far as I'm concerned, bruckner is late-romantic but it is well known that he studied some of the most ancient compositional techniques and became a master kontrapunktisk, genuinely advancing the well-established musical laws and imbuing them with his own sophisticated sense of beauty rather than attempting to artificially break the rules like some kind of musical nietzsche hack.</br></br></br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/3Z4DZ_s7roc  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=U8N<wbr>FS8WXfCI</wbr>  [ ]  https://<span>youtu.be/C6-AN8J385c  [ ]  <br>So you like Bruckner because he's done work that aligns with the rules and practices of Allegri's time?

I actually prefer it to their casual outfits in their website so that's actually a plus.</br>  <br>clothes*</br>  <br>She grew up wearing things like that, she probably thinks it's normal.<br><br>Teenage girls do dress like whores nowadays anyway so she's not even wrong.</br></br></br>  <br>I think they will just give us some flashbacks then threw the whole details to keywords again.</br>  <br>Wasn't she only with Fine for a couple years?<br><br>I think she was primarily raised by South American drug lords.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope we get lots of flashback</br>    <br>I want some DMJii doujins</br>   not choosing the sexiest   <br>We will have a definite answer once I know what Chris' farts smell like.</br>  <br> MID BATTLE SELFIE! </br>    <br><br>A couple of years with Fine is a long time, friend</br></br>  <br>At least 2 years.</br>  <br> We're never going to see a heartwarming post-G DMJii doujin with awkward first-time sex between the two ;_; </br>  <br>But that would imply that haven't already had sex before G even started.</br>  I'm more interested in hibiki's job career in GX. Looks like her grade isn't that great going by the conversation in ep 1. What hibiki want to be in the future? song diva just like tsubasa?  <br> those fucking smug "I'm getting to tap that and you don't" faces </br>  <br>Suffering</br>  <br><br>What's with these two getting some of the lewdest art?</br></br>  <br>Full-time S.O.N.G. agent, maybe? Though I guess she wouldn't be able to tell her teachers that.</br>  <br>I need this<br><br>I don't even want to fap to it, I just want to read it</br></br></br>  <br><br>Because they always look like they're about a minute away from pulling each other into the bushes and fucking like rabbits?</br></br>  <br>Seems like that might be a plot point this season, her sort of deciding what she wants to be. Since she always says she isn't a hero.</br>  <br>They make the sexiest couple.</br>  <br>W-what makes you think they already did?</br>  <br>Kind of like Subaru.</br>    <br>It sounds like good heartboner material<br><br> HibiMiku have wild, unrestrained sex <br> DMJii is half fumbling and sweet kisses </br></br></br></br>  <br>The shower scene</br>  Hibiki's pantsu  <br> I want Shirabe to have a huge scar on her back from Kirika's scythe to ramp up the awkward and subsequent tenderness </br>    <br> telling them to do things like that at home <br><br>What is wrong with her?</br></br></br>  Tsubasa from behind  in Sympogear :<br>SYMPHOGEEARRR DAA!!!!<br>in G:<br>Gekisou!

So these clothes are most likely Fine hands me down. <br><br> At the sea wearing lingerie </br></br></br>  <br>I thought it could be hers but she was passed the fuck out, ODing on Linker, like always. Not sure why Fine/Shirabe is so special that they are automatically protected even when not transformed.</br>  She was taken from us too soon  <br> No one will ever fix these disgusting pointy knees. </br>  <br>Why do people think Hibiki and Miku are so sex crazed.<br><br>They're both pure and innocent. If they have sex it'll be awkward and cuddly.</br></br></br>  Why don't they just just Swan Song against the alchemists? Easy win.  <br><br>Dammit Chris you do not wear lingerie at the beach</br></br>  <br>Fine could probably cast it regardless of who she was in, even without having to take control. Her never possessing either of them means the topic is going to be a hell of a can of worms no matter how you look at it.</br>  <br><br>Except part of the Symphogear mythos is that it was used by the heroes of old (i.e. servants).<br><br> All masters are just different instances of the same dominatrix queen <br> All servants are Symphogear <br> Literally just Fine hosting a idol battle </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ver's OP LiNKER is gone, meaning the ults are highly dangerous again. Considering Phara shrugged off an entire EX ability, it would be way too much of a risk for something that could potentially be similarly shrugged off.</br>  <br>Does Gungnir detect best girls or does Gungnir make them best girls?</br>  <br> in front of impressionable youths <br>But what if the impressionable youths are the ones being gay?</br></br>  <br>I remember that one thing about Tsubasa teaching Chris that sex can be filled with tenderness and emotions instead of violence and pain.</br>  <br>Wearing lingerie is probably second nature to her, I bet she feels more comfortable in that than an actual swimsuit.</br>  <br>That's a little too intense for me.</br>  <br>Was just curious if anything was confirmed as to why, it's not really important enough to have a full discussion over. It was just another asspull false cliffhanger. Damn season 2.</br>  <br> Fuck, I really want art of that now </br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>They don't know any better.</br>  <br>From what I remember, even the keywords are inconclusive, not to mention all the things that Fine herself mentioned back in S1.</br>  <br>DMJii a best.</br>  <br>Oh, found it in the archives. It was from /m/, in regards to headcanon about their relationship.<br><br>Tsubasa's the one doing the teaching; showing Chris that raw power isn't everything. Taking things slow and steady, savoring each moment, and gently guiding her to the peak and tipping her off it with emotion, not aggression.<br><br>And the followup:<br><br>"See, Yukine? Not everything has to be a competition."<br>"S-Shut up! I only c-c-came because I was bored! You were too slow I almost fell asleep!"<br>"... Two more hours, you say?

We never found out the limitations on her powers when she merely has the option of taking over without actually doing so.</br>  <br>Sadly you're probably right and even if you ever did get to the point where she's somewhat okay with it, you could never be too rough or she might freak out on you.</br>  TAKANARE  G BEAT  MEETA WO GANTO  <br>Their sex will be cute and cuddly but sometimes, Miku turns on her S mode.</br>   5 enemies <br> 6 gears <br>Who will be left out I wonder?<br>Could it be useless?</br></br></br>  Loli Kanade?

Currently we're putting time into sword art online but I want to know, what anime has the best concept and the worst execution?  So the latest chapter was interesting to say the least.<br><br>Keith explained a few gray areas but also created a new one, what the hell was Eren's Dad doing on the outside of the walls? Where did he come from? Was he from a human comunity outside the walls more advanced then the inside of the walls? He seemed to have had more advanced medical knowledge.</br></br>  He lived in a community that coexists with the titans. He stole some titan serum, ate a shifter, and then ran as fast as his ass could run. Once he arrived at the walls he was found by the SL and brought inside the walls. MT, knowing that Grisha probably made it inside the walls, released a plague on the inhabitants (the same plague that turned Connie's village into titans). Grisha, being a doctor that specializes in studying titans, cured the city and won the Carla bowl.  <br>BRA are from areas that have been subjugated by MT, who is carrying out the will of the First King. They were forced to go to the walls and attempt to locate Grisha, with the permission to destroy all life within the walls to do so if they must. Once they discovered that Eren had eaten him they tried to instead bring Eren back so they no longer had to kill anyone.</br>  <br>Probably related to MT and BRA. He originally invaded as a spy but he grew attached to humanity, enough to marry a human and support humanity. He obviously lied about being too drunk, he had his memories from the start.</br>  <br>Hange was a real cunt this chapter</br>  <br>Or he was a doctor 100 years prior and was one of the first titans to be created and he wondered around like Yimir until he happens to eat a shifter and turn back into a human.<br><br>Hell he could be one of the original scientists working with the first king who created the titans.</br></br></br>  <br>The First King created titans as a means of warfare, with the goal of destroying all of humanity except for his own society, where there would be no conflict. MT is one of the warriors that he set out to accomplish that. There are other villages outside the walls, but they have all been subjugated by MT and his forces. The walls are comprised of his subjects that he gave the Colossal Titan serum to, and willed them into hardening themselves. They aren't shifters, so they can't be exposed to sunlight, lest they start destroying things.<br><br><br>That's possible too. However, I don't think it's that easy to come across shifters to eat. Ymir got lucky in that she was one of the first titans to enter the walls after Bert kicked the gate in. Then she found BRA's friend and ate him. Ymir didn't have the shifter power until the walls were under attack and only got it because MT sent a bunch of kids to do his dirty work and infiltrate the SL if necessary.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She wanted answers and all she got was a guy crying about how useless he is and how he got cucked.</br>  <br>Grisha and monkey trouble are half brothers or some shit.</br>  <br>who would've thought keith was an ultimate cuck.<br><br>First by Grisha then by Erwin</br></br></br>  <br>He also probably felt feels when he saw Eren at training, he did say he looks just like Carla.</br>  <br>That's gotta be weird, seeing a 15 year old boy that looks exactly like you're waifu.</br>  <br>I just said feels I didn't specify what kind of feels.</br>  I wonder if Carla knew about Grisha's basement experiments.  <br><br> incoming eren rape doujin by the trainer </br></br>   This child isn't like you <br>OUCH</br>  /a/, I just wanted to let you know that you are already great...<br><br>Because you were born...<br><br>Into this world.</br></br></br></br>  Who's BRA and MT?  <br>MT = Monkey Trouble<br>I forget BRA<br><br><br>Was this the mangaka's way of letting us know Eren will never get more development?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>BRA - Bert Reiner Annie<br>MT - Monkey Trouble</br></br>  <br>typical shonen mom trump to make all the virgin reading feel special.</br>  <br> Was this the mangaka's way of letting us know Eren will never get more development? <br><br>Or maybe that he's special because he isn't special? Unlike manlet, Mikasa and Historia who are all special snowflakes.</br></br></br>  <br> chief kieth: EREN PUT ON THIS WIG! <br> eren: D-DAME DESU SENSEI </br></br>  <br>How is Eren not the biggest special snowflake? He's a shifter and the coordinate at that.</br>  <br>He's written like the chosen one, but other characters try to force that he's not. Eren is the biggest one out of all, even Isayama said he wasn't flawed enough.</br>  <br>Why Grisha stole the Coordinate? Why he chose to die?</br>  <br>I know, I was saying he's the biggest special snowflake too.</br>  <br>Carla looks really hot.</br>  <br> Carla's mom <br> Literally Eren with long hair <br><br>Absolutely disgusting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>MT is Grisha's senpai and he just wanted to be noticed.</br>  this manga reminds me of that show Lost<br>and Lost became  shit </br>  <br>I know right?</br>  <br>Maybe She admired his and was dissapinted he retired, and now she heard his shitty excuse she got mad.</br>  <br> And you Mister. You shouldn't let people sweet-talk you like that, you know <br><br>Was Carla alpha?</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, there are some threads in this board where you can lurk desperately and make countless post, and yet gain nothing,</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128004956 <br> Saved. <br>You mean my webM right?<br><br> tfw someone finally notices how cute as fuck my webM is </br></br></br></br>    <br>Eren looks cute in that barmaid dress.</br>  <br>Carla was the manliest Jeager in the manga.</br>  <br>I don't get it why he decided to die? He was leaving the key to save humanity with a kid. That's too much faith in the next generation.</br>  <br>Alpha women aren't manly they' are just sexy as fuck.</br>  <br>Because he genetically modified Eren to be able to use the powers of the First King. The basement is filled with the corpses of failed clones.</br>  <br>Because Grisha is Eren. Plot twist</br>  <br>I want her to dominated me.</br>  So BR chapter next month?  <br>kek u gay</br>  <br>Jesus Christ how horrifying</br>  <br>mmm Carla femdom would be sooooo hot</br>  <br>The resemblance is uncanny.<br><br>Disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't mean it in a bad way or in a "she's a man" kind of way, Carla was the Alpha Jeager and that's arousing.</br>  <br>Keith did say that he looks like her. Cue<br/></br>  <br> that's arousing <br>Please don't tell me you text those babes on tinder "that's arousing"<br><br>Don't say that shit again.</br></br></br></br>    Would Mikasa a Carla? Would Grisha a Eren?  <br>nah, Mikasa abandoned the fuck outta Carla</br>    <br> He stole some titan serum, ate a shifter, and then ran as fast as his ass could run. <br>He might've been a titan shifter already and he probably made the serums himself seeing how he knows so much about the human body to be a doctor. <br>I'm wondering why his clothes were messed up when he met Keith. He got messed up before he shifted or after somehow.<br><br> MT, knowing that Grisha probably made it inside the walls, released a plague on the inhabitants (the same plague that turned Connie's village into titans). <br>Grisha's smart af so if he was running from MT, I think he would've chose which outer district to be found nearby and taken in. <br>Those plagues are pretty different. The one that hit Connie's village looked instantaneous while the Shigansina one killed people slowly. <br>The plague that hit Connie's village looked instantaneous because they all came out in separate areas where if it was slow, they'd all go to a hospital nearby altogether like how everyone came to Grisha in Shigansina. I also doubt Grisha was able to save everyone before they died from that plague too and if it really was the same plague that MT used on Connie's village, they should've seen some titans too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Granny Historia.</br>  <br>SnK: Peaceful Rural Life edition</br>  <br> Would Mikasa a Carla?  <br>Mikasa is erensexual, it doesn't matter if there is anyone that looks exactly like him she'll still be hopelessly pining for her husbando<br><br> Would Grisha a Eren? <br>Pretty creepy to fuck your kid</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this real? It looks so badly drawn even for Isayama.</br>  <br>why is Armin jacking himself off???</br>  <br>Why is Eren squeezing Armin's ass?</br>  <br>He is thinking about when he lost his virginity</br>  <br>His hands are in his pockets, fag.</br>  <br> fag <br> implying EAr is homo </br></br>  <br> They were forced to go to the walls and attempt to locate Grisha, with the permission to destroy all life within the walls to do so if they must. <br>iirc, one of their main objectives was to kill all of humanity which is not the will of the First King. read that chapter when Bert and Reiner are chatting when they have captured Eren and Ymir.<br><br>Also if capturing Grisha their main objective, I think they would've taken Eren after hearing his last name and that he was from the same district they attacked.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Look's like Isayama's art, though there are a lot of good imitation artists.</br>  <br>I suppose it is real since Editor-kun posted it.</br>  <br>Would Ymir a Armin? </br>  Two theories.      <br>End of theory one.</br>    <br>End of theory two</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128010024 <br>It's Team Manlet minus manlet. Why would Ymir be there?</br>  <br> Armin felt Molester-kun's boner through the cracks of that chair </br>  <br>What is this from?</br>  <br>where is this from?</br>  <br><br>Science book.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128010024 <br>Why would Eren standing close to her be weird?

Are they that easily triggered by YH?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128010024 <br>But Armin is almost right on top of Eren and Mikasa is staring intently at him, even though Eren is staring in the distance. There's no EH shippingfaggotry happening, so stay calm.</br>  <br>They get triggered when their precious EH gets no pandering.

Special people have a hard time understanding normals.</br></br></br>  <br>Tranny is 2edgy4me.</br>  <br>The MP were after him I think. There was nowhere else for him to go.</br>  <br>Heh. Back when I was just getting into the series my original theory regarding the Colossal Titan was that 60 meters titans were the normal out in the rest of the world and the 15 meter ones scratching at the wall were the small titans. <br>I still sort of hope that's true.</br></br>  Is Mr. Hansi man or woman?  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Why not both?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128011418 <br><br>Please go back to tumblr.</br></br>  <br>There's a full theory in the book about how Titans in the North would be bigger. It uses the migration patterns of bears as an example. <br><br>I thought the implications of BRA's village getting attacked was more interesting though.</br></br></br>  <br>In the official translation someone responded to her with a "Yes, sir".</br>  <br>There was something about Isayama asking them to switch between male and female pronouns. <br>I still think he was just butthurt that someone even asked about it in the first place.</br></br>  <br>If he doesn't like a question he'll just give a bullshit answer to fuck with the idiots. Reminder that it's okay to read Armin as a girl if you want to.</br>  <br>Didn't he ask them to use neutral pronouns?</br>  <br>I guess he never studied English because that isn't really possible.</br>  Even if you're countershitposting don't reply goddamn  <br>So this means that CT can explode at will then?</br>  <br> I still think he was just butthurt that someone even asked about it in the first place <br>He was cool with the questions about Nanabs sex he said she's 100% female. hanji was meant to be a shemale since the beginning.</br></br>  <br>Isayama went to America for school. He knows English.</br>  <br> last chapter <br> interesting <br><br>I fucking wish.</br></br></br></br>  who did grisha eat?  <br>he ate out Carla probably.<br><br>oh you mean as a titan!<br><br>one of the Reiss family.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I doubt it, he seemed sentient at that point</br>  <br>The titan the Survey Corps were fighting beyond the wall at the very start</br>  <br>'He' is the gender neutral pronoun in the english language</br>  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/int<wbr>erest/2015-07-12/hideaki-sorachi-to<wbr>ps-japanese-poll-on-favorite-manga-<wbr>artists/.90300<br> 12.
