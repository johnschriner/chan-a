[ So a simple summary of this scan.<br><br>[About the keyword of the project - 新生 - rebirth/second birth]<br> They want to reintroduce Tsukihime to player and they thought about what to do. <br> Nasu feels lot like when the worked on Mahoyo. Making graphics better, taking the scenartio to another level, but the base stays the same. <br> They want to make the player think "nostalgic but fresh" about some things they see in the game, move his feelings by some things, suprise him, and to give it all Type-Moon has. <br><br>[About the setting change]<br> The setting now change from a city that resembled "vaguely Tokyo suburbs" to pretty clearly "Tokyo metropolitan area". The scale of the incidents doesn't change, but the new scale of the setting might affect the story in some way, pls look forward to it. <br> Long talk about how different settings might feel. Original Tsukihime and Mahoyo are kinda like "what if something happened here" to new "big cities are scary, isn't it, things like this happen in big cities". <br> Takeuchi says a big city is more fit for modern vampire stories.  <br> They're talking about how they did location scounting around Tokyo, but won't say which specific places are inspired by. They don't want the players to know what to specifically look forwatd ro yet. <br> The Toono mansion and the school are being remade in details. The mansion will still be Western style and will feel like the best place for murder incidents to happen.  <br> They're talking about the 3D image of the mansion that's on a different page. Takeuchi is making a 3D model of it, which makes drawing easier, but it's also hard, since he needs to create all the details and mind object collisions.  <br> Nasu says that when you add the characters and text it really feels like a proper mystery/horror etc. and is really happy to be making a hype of game he likes. <br> Talk about how the mansion doesn't really look scary at night, but gets ominous at night, like Resi 1 mansion. <br>(cont.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  (cont.)<br> They're asked if there'll be elements of local folklore/traditions - basically what people talk about between themselves and pass it. Since the scale of the setting has changed, it might be about how Toonos got the mansion and th lands around.  <br><br>[About the character design change]<br> Takeuchi says he created a more modern designs while for example keeping the image of Arcueid as "pure white" vampire.  <br> Also pls get used to the new designs already.  <br> Nasu asks if because of the change of setting he gave Arcueif a miniskirt.  <br> Not really, but... [End of the page] </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>These almost alleviate some of my fears but I'm not sure on the reasoning behind the setting change.</br></br>  <br>You need the next page? I think it was scanned too.</br>  <br> &gt;Long talk about how different settings might feel. Original Tsukihime and Mahoyo are kinda like "what if something happened here" to new "big cities are scary, isn't it, things like this happen in big cities". <br><br>This caught my attention.This can be really good as scenes like the hotel can be even more intense.<br><br>Also<br><br> &gt;Also pls get used to the new designs already. <br>Nasu pretty much saying fuck you to people bitching about the miniskirt.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Red-Eyed Seibah <br>Cool.</br></br>  <br> Nasu pretty much saying fuck you to people bitching about the miniskirt. <br><br>Takeuchi says that. I should have tagged.</br></br></br>  <br> Also pls get used to the new designs already. <br>Fuck you, Nasu.<br>At least bring back the air intakes.</br></br></br>  <br>You should keep your nip knowledge for yourself and let EOPs rot in hell for being retards.</br>  Going to be interesting how they keep the 90's feel of it.  <br>God fucking dammit Takeuchi</br>    <br>Of course he says it in more Japanese-y way.<br> I was thinking people could maybe have already gotten used to the new designs... </br></br>  <br>where you get this? j</br>  So basically this story is going to take place in 2015?  <br>Nope it will always be the 90's<br><br>Any other time would fuck up the Nasuverse. Same way Mahoyo is set in the 80's.</br></br></br>  <br>Beast's Lair and Mobius Space.<br><br>http://z13.invisionfree.com/Mobius_<wbr>Space/index.php?showtopic=248&amp;st=13<wbr>5</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  Why are you posting old interview?<br><br>This is not from TM10</br></br>  <br>Didn't he say he was going to have it take place around 2005 with Fate? But seeing as they are copying modern day Tokyo then my guess is they upped the date.</br>  <br>Sorry Nasu, the miniskirt is horrible.</br>  <br>That's indeed from TM Ace 10.</br>    <br>Holly shit. Dat Tohno mansion</br>  <br>But it is?</br>  <br>It still has to be the 90's for the events that happen. It may at very end of it though as modern Tokyo was similar to it then.</br>  last thread   <br>Fluffy Shiki?</br>  <br><br>And he doesn't care what people think.<br><br>Nasu is growing up, he used to fold all the time when people got mad about something. Good for him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That was just people misunderstanding a complete material line.</br>  OP if you are still around mind translating this?<br><br>Got the HF manga the other day and it came with this guest comments page.</br></br>  This man is your friend.  <br>It's mostly a talk about the designs, sorry.<br><br>But the last part with about how the game developement is proceeding. Basically everyone in Type-Moon is working on FGO, sorry but pls wait a little more. Also Nasu says he would like to return to Tsukihime and also work on something new (新作 - doesn't really have to refer to completely new IP, it's simply the newest thing a company is making, for TM it might be Mahoyo 2 too).</br></br></br>  I'll never get over new designs.  <br>Better quality.</br>  <br>Nice<br><br>Didn't want to bend the fuck out my book to scan it</br></br></br>  <br> Long talk about how different settings might feel. Original Tsukihime and Mahoyo are kinda like "what if something happened here" to new "big cities are scary, isn't it, things like this happen in big cities". <br><br>Fuck I literally thought that this could be done better while playing the VN. That hotel scene was amazing.</br></br></br>  <br><br> still waiting for my copy <br>Jelly as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br> Ctrl F <br> Search "Satsuki" <br> 0 results <br>This is the definition of suffering</br></br></br></br>  <br>what if they go higurashi on us?</br>  <br>Why do bitches like Shiki when Arihiko is looking sexy as fuck?</br>  <br>Who are you talking about?</br>  <br>Oh god he is wearing my glasses.</br>  <br> Basically everyone in Type-Moon is working on FGO, sorry but pls wait a little more. </br>  <br><br>Dammit Takeuchi, don't spread your ahoge fetish to Sakura. And keep her curves, you bum.</br></br>  <br>At least she lived in the manga.</br>  <br>She was cut out completely to make room for the teacher route.</br>  <br>He draws her with that small ahoge since years ago from some reason.</br>  <br>nothing wrong with that maybe wormslut improved with that</br>  <br>Sacchin is old and busted. <br>Have you seen the new sensei and Arihiko? I bet they're getting their own routes instead.</br></br>  <br><br> from <br>for</br></br></br>  From BL about Grand Order:<br><br> Alright. One turn is divided into a tactical phase, command phase, and enemy reaction. <br><br> In the command phase, you draw five random cards made up of a random selection of quick, arts, and buster, with the corresponding Servant illustration on them. Picking cards from among these is basically the equivalent of commanding the Servant illustrated on that card to perform the corresponding action.  <br><br> Tactical phase is when you make some preparations, for example, using skills, or Master skills as back up and healing, and Command Spells.  <br><br><br> Now there are five cards per Servant for a total of 15 cards in a deck. And you can basically chain types of attacks together.  <br>But I don't really care about the specifics. <br><br> Now the Ascension thing we saw in the earlier images was basically some form of Servant evolution. If we can some certain items, we'll be able to ascend them to a higher level of existence, and there are apparently four stages of that, with the visuals changing. <br><br> So we have the normal Nero, and then by ascending her we get the Nero with the special arm armor she had on in one of those cards. That's apparently her final evolution also. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was one of the first fucking things I noticed on the HF poster. Now I see it everywhere. It's stil cute though.</br>  <br>Sounds shitty as hell</br>  Any news on Nrvnqsr?<br>I want my Professor Chaos route</br>  <br>Arihiko is a BRUTE</br>  <br> No region lock pls <br> No region lock pls </br></br>  <br>Then there is the multiple classes thing.</br>  <br> gangsta Shirou <br>Damn, I love his new design.</br></br>  <br>Lies. <br>He's a gentleman and a top tier bro. <br>He's hot now too. <br>Perfect husbando material.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's here too</br>  <br>Sounds like pretty standard mobage stuff.</br>  <br> Shirou <br>Nigga Arihiko looks completely different, his swag level is off the charts.</br></br>  <br><br>At least he recognizes she has curves now. Take what you can get.</br></br>  <br>It's a phone game, can't expect much.</br>  <br><br>Someone show this guy that script cover of adult Shirou macking Rin.<br><br>Shirou is swole now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Typical mobile shit. Only gonna be interesting if there's a heavy story emphasis.</br>  <br>I've seen it, Arihiko is better. His face is better and hes a bro.</br>  <br>If Shiki looks so sexy in his "normal" mode, my body won't be ready for Nanaya mode</br>  <br>They already said that the main story has more than one million lines of text.<br><br>And then there is also the individual Servant stories.</br></br></br>    <br>So you command multiple Servants? I love card games but a 15 card deck doesn't seem like the kind I like. Sounds more like a Kingdom Hearts kind of "card" game than an actual card game. I hope it will be fun, but it doesn't sound like there will be active pvp or co-op.</br>  <br>Maybe someone could rip it and make a PC port with no boring gameplay.</br>  <br>We still don't really know how the gameplay is in action.<br><br>And it will be probably more fun than Extra too.</br></br></br>  Who is this?  <br> New Sensei gets a route and Sacchin doesn't  <br>Isn't it sad?</br></br>  <br>Why would anyone make a PC port when you can use Genymotion?</br>  <br>Looks like Archer.</br>  <br>She looks too much like Satsuki. Boring.</br>  <br> 褐色の肌と生気に満ちた瞳、そして深紅の大弓を携えた。伝説にうたわれる<wbr>弓の名手。かつて彼は、戦いのなか で数千人にも及ぶ人民の命を救うという偉業を成し遂げたという。</wbr> </br>  <br> Arihiko <br>He's a homosexual.</br></br>  <br>Where's that Shiki's shack supposed to be?</br>  <br>Because he looks like a retard.</br>  <br> tfw you will never play Mahjong with Shiki and Arihiko </br>  It seems there will be more stuff about the Association in the remake too.  <br> Air intakes <br>It's back to its rightful owner.<br>Your hair alreadylooks nice &amp; fluffy like that, Arc. You also looks more cat-ish now. Back then I don't understand how Shiki-kun can say that you looks like a cat.</br></br></br>  <br>Shirou's starting to look like Archer two years down the line.</br>  <br> friend <br> implying Arihiko isn't in love with Shiki just like Issei is in love with Shirou </br></br>  <br>I wish that would mean the improvement of the battle quality.</br>  <br> Sacchin <br>Who?</br></br>  <br> secondary <br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tLf9<wbr>oWUe2fc</wbr>  [ ]<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=U7n0<wbr>e5XMV-Y</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>And the partial bangs are back with their rightful owner. All is good.</br>  15 years later and Takeuchi still can't draw man's body properly.  <br>I don't even care about this petty shit, my problem with the new designs is that everyone has the same rounded eyes and face structure now. Say what you will about his old style, but at least them the same face syndrome wasn't this severe. Now they are just a palette and hair swap away from each other. <br><br>Arc and Curry are the worst offenders, coupled with the new hairdo they don't even look like the same character anymore. They revamped the style before for Kagetsu Tohya and the Melty blood games and it looked fine. There was no reason to change their looks this much.</br></br></br>  <br>Here maybe? Somewhere in the forest anyway, it supposed to be hard to find</br>  <br>It's his style.</br>  At this point I think geting rid of Takeuchi would be a good thing.  how's your japanese learning going, anons? if you want to read this when it comes out you better not falter, because 100% serious, this won't be translated for at least 5 years after its release, or it may even follow Mahoyo's path and never be translated at all.  <br>Nasu would never fire her husbando.</br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>I'll start  tomorrow </br>  <br>5 years in, pretty good.</br>  <br> his won't be translated for at least 5 years after its release <br>Don't remind me please.<br>Guess I'll start tomorrow</br></br></br>  <br>Damn you're good. I didn't notice it at first.</br>  <br>I am just going to wait.</br>  <br>He's pretty useless. But Koyama lacks style. Hiroyama progresses much better than Takeuchi, but his faces also lack expressivity and 2uguu4me.</br>  <br>I haven't done my anki reps in a few weeks.</br>  Takeuchi has REGRESSED so hard.<br>His best art was truly back in MBAACC.</br>  <br>Maybe something about the Sea of Astray with Nero?</br>  <br>You mean MBAA.</br>  <br>I-I'm sure it won't take that long! Maybe even an official one since VNs are becoming more popular over here!</br>  <br>so we are really getting a tsukihime remake right?this time for real?</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Let's say that they'll release it this Christmas and everybody already knows that. How many fansub groups are gonna take it?</br>   Basically everyone in Type-Moon is working on FGO <br>STOP!</br>  <br>Would you believe me if I say that with experience of 10 years of watching anime and 5 years of reading japanese internet and fiction with rikaichan gave me enough moon skills to read a VN? I never learned kanji properly so I still need to use some programm to capture ones I can't read.</br>  <br>Fags on Fuwa start with a MT patch.</br>  <br>Oh i see, thanks asshole.</br>  <br>That was surely translated somewhere already. Or is it new?</br>  <br>what does it say?</br>  <br><br>The the second Takeuchi's syndrome "High Crotch"</br></br>  <br>If you mean the coloring style I think that style is more suitable to the more light-hearted works.</br>  <br>Read Mahoyo recently. I'm ready for this.</br>  <br>No. I mean the fucking art.<br>Shiki and Arc were perfect in MBAA.</br></br>  <br><br>Actually he has a point about coloring. Koyama's detailed shading sometimes doesn't match Takeuchi's shitty lineart. MBAA coloring on contrary makes it look better.</br></br>  <br>New Shiki is awesome though. Look at this sexy motherfucker</br>  <br>White haired Shiki be pimpin'</br>  <br> Takeuchi's shitty lineart <br>What?</br></br>    <br>I'd let new Shiki rape my ass raw.</br>  <br> tfw he's still wearing these blue-orange pajamas </br>    <br>Now THIS is where a final fight can take place.</br>  <br>My dick is not ready for Nanaya mode.</br>  <br>Shame that SHIKI is a weakling.</br>  <br>He'll get boost in remake</br>  <br> ahoge </br>  <br>Just started with the Hiragana, doing 3-4 per day. <br><br>Taking it slow to make sure I remember them properly.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is uniel so popular if it's just a Melty Blood ripoff? I can hardly find people to play with.</br>  <br> French Bread make Melty Blood HD after remake is out <br>Yes please</br></br>  <br>That goes for everyone else too so he's still the weakest.</br>  <br>You're going to slow. You're going to be using Hiragana for EVERYTHING so you'll eventually remember them whether you want to or not.</br>  <br>What is Carmine's story anyways? Cause he would fit right into Melty.</br>  So, how good are the H scenes in Tsukihime?  <br>SHIKI is quite powerful, but he was just too insane to employ his abilities properly. It was noted by Mikihiso that SHIKI and Akiha's abilities were quite exceptional. He beat Ciel and nearly killed Shiki a few times, but he was also just as likely to gnaw on his own arm, stab himself, and shit since he was fucking insane due to being possessed.<br><br>He really is the most unfortunate guy in this game.<br><br>He was a good guy, he was one of their friends, then one day through no fault or will of his own he gets possessed and loses his shit, gets forgotten by everyone, ten years in a basement still insane, and in his deliriousness he thinks he's the one that was killed since he was forgotten and cast out.<br><br>He's too insane to even lament that stuff properly, condemned since they don't know its just some old vampire inside of him doing all of this, yet we see one moment in the game where he has a window of clarity with his old friend.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All shit. It's nice knowing that they fuck though.</br>  <br>Yes and?</br>  <br>I think they were less embarrassing than Fate's, but by all means they were nowhere near good.</br>  <br>I just finished Dies the other day, I'm ready.</br>  <br>The manga understood</br>  <br>mollusc/10</br>  <br>What the fuck, mate, you can learn kana in a single day. And if you keep taking it slowly with 4 characters per day it will take you years to just remember joyo kanji.</br>  <br><br>If we remove the ahoge, do we get Nanaya mode?</br></br>    <br>Mollusk-level.</br>  <br>I read Nasu for the porn.</br>    <br><br>The manga made SHIKI such a tragic character, I wish we could get a manga version of the Akiha route for more SHIKI.</br></br>  <br>Seafood with a hint of Lovecraft.</br>  Currybutt is too cute  <br>Well this is what he always was, but it just wasn't touched enough on the game. However even Akiha and the maids say he was quite tragic. You don't really understand it enough going in, until you process it all, and see how it played out from his angle.</br>  <br>THE CUTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEST</br>  <br>The extra scene in KT really drove it home to me. What a fucking bro.</br>  <br>It's going to be so easy to self insert into this guy.</br>  <br>That scene in Kohaku's route where the Shikis chat over coffee is one of my favorites.</br>  <br>Man, she must be terrible at giving blowjobs.</br>  <br>S-sacchin!?</br>  Is there a way to use alternate music in the Japanese version, or is it something the English patch adds?  Is TM Ace fully scanned or just a few leaks?  <br>Slightly worse than Fate's which is really impressive.</br>  <br>I spent a year trying to learn, I gave up. Then I spent another year later. Still not good enough. As much as I love Tsukihime, it's not really worth the time and effort if all I'm going to do is play VNs.</br>  <br>It's not even officially out, make your guess.</br>  I recently deleted my TM folder and all SHIKI pictures in it, then this thread happens<br>There weren't many anyway</br>  <br> In the remake even SHIKI will be Servant tier </br>  <br>Leaks<br><br>It comes out in a few more hours unless some Elevens get them right after midnight.</br></br></br>  <br>It's the 1st in Nipland, it should be out.</br>  <br>It's 1 a.m. there</br>    <br>Are you implying that people don't go to the convenience stores at 1AM?</br>     still no hair vents <br> still a twig <br> still no granny skirt <br><br>Die Takeuchi</br></br></br></br>    <br>I don't, but I doubt that convenience stores get new batches of magazines at 12 a.m.<br>I also doubt that TM Ace is sold at convenience stores.</br></br>  <br>I'd insert myself into Shiki if you know what I mean.</br>  <br> he attacks the mansion <br> rekt by the Dark Jade Fist </br></br>  <br>TM Ace is sold in convenience stores not just at Animate and Amazon, usually they get new stuff as early as 12 A.M with 4 A.M being the latest.</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>Dat Tine.</br>    <br>Huh. <br>How convenient.</br></br>  <br>JUST<br>IN<br>TIME</br></br></br>  <br> Nasu says that when you add the characters and text it really feels like a proper mystery/horror <br>Sweet. <br>I saw that some people are apprehensive about the remake because they don't feel like the atmosphere of the original vn can be topped, but if there's one thing Mahoyo's shown us, it's that modern TM are the masters of atmosphere.</br></br></br>  <br>And that Nasu hasn't improved in writing SoL in over 10 years.</br>  <br>Mahoyo was a mix of what he wrote 20 years ago and new scenes.</br>  <br> SHIKI is quite powerful <br>What, is he going to bleed on me?</br></br>  <br>He's never been a particularly great writer.</br>  Have these leaks covered all the Tsukihime news we're getting?  <br>When he bleeds on you then you'll be made of swords.</br>  <br>That's the face of a man who knows how laid he's about to get. <br><br>Also c'mon Type Moon. You know you want to give us the Aoko Route.</br></br></br>  <br>Not everything, there is still more artwork left and maybe something else.</br>  <br>And you're judging this by a halfassed translation of F/SN that came out over ten years ago and was noted to be not so good tanslation, perhaps? Maybe Apocrypha or something that doesn't count at all towards Nasu's writing?<br><br>What exactly are you using as a basis to say there's been no improvement exactly?<br><br>CCC is the most recent indication of Nasu's writing, and it shows he's improved quite a bit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mahoyo 3 will be the Aoko route, my dad is Nasu so you can trust me. Mahoyo 2 is scheduled to end with Aoko meeting Shiki which is why Tsukihime Remake is getting released first.</br>  I always thought Tsukihime was hurt by the inclusion of Arceuid as a character. It's intended to be a murder mystery type story, but there's the 'most powerful being in the world' walking around casually and being moe and hot as hell. I honestly believe that Arceuid deserves to have had her own story separate from all of Tsuki, even if it would leave Tsukihime without a prominent main heroine type girl. I can't get over the fact that some random Japanese punk kills her and then romances her until she's slobbering over his dick like a two cent whore.  <br>most faggots doesnt even know that the FSN and tsukihime translation is very bad</br>  <br> CCC is the most recent indication of Nasu's writing, and it shows he's improved quite a bit. <br>Well it's not like it's incredible either</br></br>  <br> more artwork left <br>Hoping for Nero/Roa<br>Do you have a source for that claim though?</br></br></br>  <br>Are you mad that Shiki fucked you're waifu?</br>  <br>I've seen all the leaks so far, some images haven't been seen that are partway inside each leak.</br>  <br><br>No, you're right, and Arceuid's role should have taken by  Sacchin </br></br>  <br>There is not Nero or Roa, but the girls are there.</br>  <br>She doesn't even exist in half the game.</br>  <br>It's been confirmed that there is no Nero nor Roa this time.</br>  <br> Aoko Route is Shiki and Aoko traveling around Japan <br> Tohno runs into Touko while Aoko re-meets Ryougi.  <br> The bad end is getting Touko and Aoko to meet and ends up with both Shiki getting caught in the explosions. </br></br></br>  <br>arai in BL already got it and said that no Nero or Roa.</br>  <br><br><br>amazing<br>picked up Tsukihime manga<br>already read the VN, haven't done KT yet<br>That scene is shopped though, right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone does. The problems with the writing isn't just simple prose. Things such as pacing and awkward lines are also giant issues in his writing</br>  <br> I always thought Tsukihime was hurt by the inclusion of Arceuid as a character. <br>Stopped reading there.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>That's a shame.<br>How about more information? Are there still pages of text to be uploaded?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mate, I love TM, but Nasu is a decent writer at best whose writing suffers the most in an SoL style. He still has some pretty bad pacing issues too.</br>  <br>Still nothing? There's that many Archers saving lives on the battlefield?</br>  <br>No, it's not.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, I can feel the tense and brooding atmosphere of this dark murder mystery emanating from that burger she's eating.<br><br><br><br>And that half is the best part of the game!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Was this in Ciel's route? I never read it because I never liked Ciel.</br>  <br> Touko <br> combat magic </br></br>  Sensei route when.  <br>Pretty sure these:<br><br><br> are in the translation's extra content. I think they just compiled a bunch of /a/ posts.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She's officially taken by Souichirou now, Tohno can't have her anymore.</br></br>  <br>I hope her shitty tsundere self suffers as much as she can in mahoyo.<br>Alice was so nice.</br></br>  <br>Arc does shine pretty brightly.</br>  <br>Nope it's in KT, also read Ciel's route. This is from Ciel's route.<br><br><br>Yes it is, it's from the legendary Nasu porn thread.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have to say I agree with you.<br>It's been a while since I read Tsukihime, but I seem to remember there being fairly little sol. The 'everyday' scenes in far side were mostly suspenseful and the sol scenes in near side gave the vn a sense of humour more than anything.<br>I don't think Nasu's poor sol writing skill will hinder his writing of tsukihime as a whole. I'm pretty sure fate was more negatively affected by sol overall.</br></br></br>  <br>Souichirou is with Alice. Aoko is going h-keikaku with Shiki</br>    I can't wait for this scene with the remake's engine.  <br> Yes it is, it's from the legendary Nasu porn thread. <br> That was honestly the best day of my life </br></br>  <br>She will be forever alone. She defied the world itself for bringing him back but both forgot all of it.</br>  <br> Glad to know it wasn't just mine. </br>  <br> brown hair <br><br>What were they thinking?</br></br></br>  <br>I can't wait to hear all that voiced insanity.</br>  <br>I was more thinking about Starmine and Starbow more specifically for the explosions. <br>Aoko is only good for destruction ya know. Touko is a veritable Batman compared to Aoko's Superman.</br></br>  I hope Nasu improves on best girl's route who had one of the weakest routes in the game but still was best girl.  <br>I don't know, Aoko at first was supposed to have black hair but they changed it just like how they changed Touko's blue hair.</br>  Is it going to be 18+ like the original or have TM spinelessly surrendered to the terror of all-ages marketing?  <br>Hmm. I guess that line could be correct if he felt a kind of love for her before moving in with the Arimas after she left. Tokie is still his first loveR though. Why does Shiki have such good taste with all these onee-san characters like those two and Arihiko's big sister.</br>  <br><br>I hope he writes her out of the game  because I don't want my waifu to became a slave to Shiki dick again  ;_; </br></br>  <br>What engine did Mahoyo use?</br>  <br>Shit, have they said anything about voices in this issue of TM ace?<br>I've heard that Japan was fairly vocal (ironically) about Mahoyo lacking voices.</br></br>  <br>She was always brown since that shitty 1997 Takeuchi art.</br>  <br>Not sugoi enough</br>  <br>It's 18+ from Tsukihime being Tsukihime. H-scenes are unconfirmed however.</br>  <br>Nigga you're meant to self insert into Shiki. At least a bit in the Arc route.<br><br>Also Shiki and Arc play off each other quite well (in the manga especially) you can't say that.</br></br></br>  <br>Before the Takeuchi art on his site she had black hair according to Nasu.</br>  <br> Nigga you're meant to self insert into Shiki. </br>  <br>She doesn't even look like Ciel anymore.</br>  <br>All-Ages is just VN lingo for not porn. Blood is irrelevant.</br>  <br>kirikiri. It's a powerful engine and TM has, apparently, good programmers.</br>  <br>The real answer to this question is 'nothing has been confirmed'.  is referencing an interview with Takeuchi who said something along the lines of 'it might have to be 18+ for its depiction of violence'.</br>  <br>So?</br>  <br>And now he gets new sexy teacher</br>  <br>Isn't that ancient? <br><br>They should get rUGP 6.20 from age.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't kirikiri open source?</br>  Any theories on the teacher's name being 'Noel'?<br>I doubt Nasu would give her a French name just to fuck with us.</br>  <br>Not sure about its age but Mahoto honestly looks fucking sick.<br><br>Probably the best VN visual-wise I've ever seen</br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't seem they need it given the awesome results they got with it in Mahoyo.</br>  <br>Yeah, that happens... What's your point?</br>  <br>Good. Ciel was ugly as fuck in Tsukihime.</br>  <br>I was under the impression kirikiri was a customizable engine because of </br>  <br><br>Fuck you both, Ciel looked bro as fuck.</br></br>  <br>She's an association member who used similar magic to Ciel's when she infiltrated the school. Probably to look out for Shiki via Aoko's request.<br> Or she's Aoko. </br></br>  <br>This, I can get used to the miniskirt, but the hair makes her look way too saberish.</br>  <br>The animations are cool as hell</br>  <br>It would be hard to self-insert into someone who just suffers for the majority of every route.<br>You'd have an easier time with Shirou.</br></br>  <br> Tsukihime will have animations like this <br> &gt;inb4 they show the Zelretch fight with Type-Moon in this </br></br>  <br> when you nut so hard you get visions of R'lyeh </br>  <br>She can't be Aoko with Touko's hair and eyes.</br>  <br>There is magic for that.</br>  <br>I don't think just because there is suffering implies you cannot self-insert. Shirou suffers quite a bit too. Actually, his past is a lot more defined than Shiki, I'd say it's harder to self-insert into him, especially since he's a PTSD autist.</br>  <br>The difference between Shirou and Shiki is that they just tell you Shirou had suffered, but you feel how Shiki suffers.</br>  <br>Shirou gets some of that in HF with the arm though.</br>  <br>Yeah, HF is the most like old Nasu, which is why its my favorite route.</br>  <br>Shirou is a defined character with a defined personality, it's hard to insert because he's just another character in the story with his own thoughts and ideals. It would be like trying to insert as Luke in Tales of Abyss; it doesn't work since its clear he's his own character.<br><br>Shiki is a bit more of an insert without thoughts or ideals, meant to be a device to get into the story with. His personality is kept mostly blank and open on purpose as he's static while changing per route to achieve this end as an insert.<br><br>Just because he goes wild at times doesn't detract from that unlike some some people think. Even if you make a blank character and give him a berserk switch, he's still blank. Even the most bland protags ever would still have some fighting mode where he does something cool or fighty, but it doesn't mean they're different outside of that mode.</br></br></br></br></br>   blue will eventually be ntr'd by alice   <br>It's not really NTR now is it? She's not actually dating Soujuurou last I checked. <br>Aoko is better off being single given her lifestyle. <br><br>It's a cruel irony, that is. Both Aozaki are great bodies but neither of them are really mother material and live lives that actively persuade them to not settle down and have kids.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're good to need a big budget then.<br><br>Q: You must tell us the details of the battle between the Crimson Moon and Zelretch at his prime!!<br><br>A: You are asking me to divulge such delicious details from my stash of ideas? Mmmm... I have shown some similar scenes in Mahoyo, they would carry a similar vibe. It would be something like, the Crimson Moon dropping a mirror image of the Moon (HERE IT COMES!) versus Zelretch doing something only he was able to do: a virtually limitless Ether Cannon unleashed through a special magic circle ("Magic Square"). If we had five times the budget of Mahoyo, then we may be able to realize such a scene.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You must be real asshole in real life to insert in Shiki</br>  <br>Considering they are using all that Tsukiihime money Takeuchi has been sitting on for over 15 years it should be a given.</br>  Given a chance to go on a nice date with Aoko, where would you take her?  <br> officially taken by Souichirou <br>No, that's Alice Kuonji, not Aoko.</br></br>  <br>the amusement park</br>  <br>KFC</br>  <br>Because of the vivid imagery? There are plenty of examples of that in Fate too, especially HF.<br><br><br>Put into better words than I can manage at the moment. I'm sure it was clear, but I wasn't arguing for the side against yours.<br><br><br>Just another snarky remark, honestly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Alleyway.</br>  <br>I don't think she'd be impressed. Although she's Japanese, so who knows.</br>  <br>Garan-no-dou.</br>  <br>The future, so I can date best Aoko with red hair, jeans and a T-shirt.</br>  <br> The difference between Shirou and Shiki is that they just tell you Shirou had suffered, but you feel how Shiki suffers. <br>literally UBW route</br></br>  Too bad we won't get translations for another 10 years after it's release.  Are there any better ways to read Tsukihime on android? I've been meaning to re-read it and I've got a 14 hour flight+ a month without internet in the near future. ONScripter Plus seems to indent randomly and has text problems, and VNDS has a shit layout and cuts text off.  <br>The manga did SHIKI so much better.<br><br>He was presented as the tragic character he actually is instead of the nutjob he became.<br><br>Well, from Shiki's perpective, that's probably the most he is.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>You can learn moon in that time.</br>  <br> Shiki is a bit more of an insert without thoughts or ideals <br>Spoken like a true idiot who did not read Tsukihime.<br>Anyone who actually read Tsukihime knows that Shiki has his own thoughts and ideals. It's not your shitty Saturday morning cartoon type ideals, but they are still his ideals. He actually shows more of his thoughts through his introspection, especially on his train ride home, or, when he's walking the streets. Just because he's not shoving his ideals in your face doesn't mean he doesn't have any.<br><br>Just goes to show what kind of reading comprehension level you have.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey, I'm poor.<br><br> It's the thought that counts ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>It's great, isn't it?</br>    <br> Just another snarky remark, honestly. <br>And what if Shiki talked politely? Just another polite boring remark, honestly.<br><br>Do you faggots even know what the words personality, ideals, and thoughts even mean?<br><br>It's like you grabbed a bunch of trigger words and started describing a character for a novel you haven't even read.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> she wants to date an austrian </br>  <br> Shiki is a bit more of an insert without thoughts or ideals <br>I hope you're not that dumb and are only pretending to have read Tsukihime.</br></br>    Why are all the Tsukihime girls  except for Ciel  so god-tier?<br>All the Fate girls  except for Ilya  are so bland and boring.</br>  Sacchin route when?  <br>How shit is the French trans?</br>    <br> Shiki is a bit more of an insert without thoughts or ideals <br> without thoughts or ideals <br>You get bombarded by them in the first 15 minutes of the VN, not including the prologue. It was like an explanation arc for how he acts the way he does.</br></br></br>  <br>French is not my native tongue so I can't judge. You can probably text-hook TL it.</br>  <br> Both Aozaki are great bodies but neither of them are really mother material and live lives that actively persuade them to not settle down and have kids. <br><br>They're both too busy grooming them instead.</br></br></br>    <br> tfw ditched French in High-school for German and now it's come to haunt me all these years after </br>    <br>Citation or bullshit.</br>  <br>No grammar mistakes at least.</br>  <br>Rin is perfection, but you're right for the most part.</br>  <br>My bed.</br>  <br>Rin is just a less developed Akiha.</br>  <br>To be fair, Touko is a confirmed lolicon so Beowulf being genderless can work out nicely for her. <br><br>The Aozaki sisters just straight up like their prey to be young.</br></br></br>  Reminder that LNs are the cancer that's killing anime.  <br>reminder that OP is a faggot who is sadly not killing himself</br>  Thanks, Captain Obvious!  <br>Idiot.</br>  <br>Yep we need to go back to more VNs.</br>  <br>We need to go back to manga and original productions.

Whether or not it was from Kumiko’s own body heat, its fabric had roughly felt warm to the touch.<br><br>“It suits you.”<br><br>She laughed in a somewhat curious way, and then suddenly placed her hand on his shoulder. Pressed against such force, Shuuichi spontaneously tilted his body towards Kumiko. The lifting of her heels had playfully come into sight. Kumiko stood tip-toed and she held her hand close to his ear, with her lips following suit. This froze Shuuich’s body in place, even while his heart was bouncing — with Kumiko ever so close to him, Shuuichi found her presence difficult to ignore.<br><br>Kumiko’s voice had flowed, with the sigh of her breath tickling his ears, and the sweet fragrance of her shampoo striking his nose.

Also I'm the anon who talks about TakixReina and Mizore all day so those are my credentials I guess.<br><br> Kitauji wins the prefecture tournament, then they move onto the Kansai tournament. At Kansai, one of the top schools expected to win JOB hard because their adviser left, which lets Kitauji get a narrow third place Gold victory. However when they get to Nationals, they get btfo pretty hard by actual good schools and get copper. And it's pretty sad, everyone cries all the way home to the bus. Reina is especially upset for obvious reasons. She also apologizes to Kaori first surprisingly, since Reina feels like she jobbed it and took away Kaori's chance to play a solo. Haruka is crying so much that Asuka has to give a speech. And the section of the novel is Asuka passing the figurative torch to Kumiko in the shape of Asuka's music notes, which she received from her dad that she hasn't seen in 15 years because that is another long story </br></br></br>  <br>I want them to wear their marching uniforms as swimsuits.</br>  <br>Fuck off</br>   [HorribleSubs] Hibike!

This gave them a mini power boost for prefecture but when they got to Nationals, every motherfucker can play this easy. That's also why Kaori playing the solo part was pretty important to her, because it would be her carrying the entire band to victory. But in actuality it's the Oboe carrying them. </br></br></br></br>  <br> hetfags thinking they won just because /u/ didn't win </br>  <br>anon, is pretty much confirmed by now.</br>  <br>context please.</br>   Both fagotts having a good taste in both man and fashion <br>Damn can they get any better?</br>  how to post link here.<br>has a fucking shit in neytip seems announcement of a free movie and third season of K-on<br><br>bitch who pario the media Hibike sales is 4,9k</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, just like Amagi Brilliant Park season 2 and Hyouka season 2</br>  <br><br>   it's the Oboe carrying them. <br><br>Absolutely halal.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This anime is an adaptation of a novel.<br>The novel has a "het" end.<br>Anime adaptation did not have an anime original end.<br><br>There is literally nothing left to argue about here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon said<br> hetfags are chill </br></br>  The ponytail is back.  <br>TAXIDO!</br>  <br>Amaburi is bound to happen, Hyouka there's not enough material yet and Hibike is even on event already.</br>  The entire first season summarized in one frame.  <br>Hyouka is confirmed no s2 because not enough source material.</br>  Anybody else hyped up for the upcoming anime series?

Hopefully I can get the proper Japanese translation today so that we'll have both the English and Japanese version available.<br><br>Several more designs are in the works and should be uploaded as the week progresses.<br><br>Also, I'm still looking for suggestions for designs to make.<br>If you have an idea for a graphic t-shirt you would totally buy if it were available, let me know, and I may be able to design it for you free of charge.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>An alternate-version the client requested, with some place-holder Japanese text while I get a proper, grammatically correct translation from a contact of mine.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm also looking for any suggestions anyone has on how to improve this design before I finalize it.<br><br> I think I cracked the code for the lazy method Okayado uses to create Lamia-scales when he finishes drawing pages in the manga. <br><br>Let me know if you think this one still needs something, or if it's ready for printing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I bet the Centaur's vagina will be loose as fuck for a human penis due to size.  <br>fuck yeah.

I'm not much of an illustrator, and I tend to avoid visually representing the actual characters on t-shirts as:<br>1. Putting the actual character on a t-shirt tends to look like shit.<br>2. It helps avoid notices for copyright infringement.<br><br>However, I'm sure I can use shilouettes effectively.<br>Let me know if you have a picture of her or a pose I can trace to make a partial silhouette, which I'm sure I can work into some kind of horse-racing logo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was going to avoid copyright rather than insulting your work .-. I'm sorry<br><br>I have a few others and I'm sure a good google image search will help.

I am looking forward to seeing it in motion.  I've always wondered, are any of them actually paying rent or are they all just free loading with Darling ? <br><br>And do they all have a house key or do they not need one ?</br></br>  <br><br>seeing how the tail moves is key<br><br> you will never take a selfie with Miia </br></br></br></br>  <br> rent <br>Government yen. As long as he keeps the receipts, Kurusu can claim for food, electricity, water bills. They also pay for all the renovations to accommodate the girls.<br> keys <br>Probably only Cerea and Miia need them(and can be trusted to keep them safe)<br><br>Papi could drop hers, plus she flies, so balcony entry works.<br>Rach crawls in and out the same entrance, so no need either.<br>Mero can't swim out.<br>Suu can just squeeze any way in.<br>Lala allegedly will pop in unannounced, so probably no key either.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good, selfies are disgusting.</br>  <br> H immeasurable <br>Really?</br></br>  I'm stupidly in love with Miia<br><br>It's physically painful knowing that she will never wrap me up and whisper loving things into my ear</br></br>  <br>even if you got to that universe you would not get her regardless as she is gonna win the kurusu bowl</br>  <br>Not him, but there's an entire race of lonely lamia's in that universe. He could easily visit Yukio's bath house and find an eligible snek to cuddle.</br>  <br>Kind of hard to define her "hip". Do you wrap the tape in front of her rear legs? That's the "horse waist". Or do you wrap it around the "horse bum" and loop all the way to in front of the front legs? I guess a better term might be "indefinable".</br>  <br><br>If needed another lamia would be nice, but if given a wish from a magic lamp or something I would ask to become darling, I would try and break up with the other girls as gently and honestly as I could<br>And then live a happy married life with Miia until I died</br></br></br>   Reminder Ms. Smith is Best Girl.   So what kind of review would you give her Onsen ?  I'm looking forward to the anime but i also realize it wont sell, if we're lucky the anime will boost the manga sales but that's it.<br> No name studio <br> Primarily rookie or up and coming seiyuu <br> Monster girls are niche </br></br></br>  <br>Miia's so dangerously cute in the bottom right panel. I don't think I'll be ready for this.</br>  <br><br>I've always wondered, is part of her character a reference to the Matrix films "Mr Smith" ?</br></br>  <br>Marriage/10<br>Yukio is honestly the best non-main harem girl.<br><br> tfw no spin-off series about her and her boyfriend </br></br></br></br>  <br>tio is best non harem girl</br>  <br><br>That's not Polt.<br><br> Jokes on you, i love them all. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Only if she's blue</br>  <br><br>Is she blue ? <br><br>I don't think shes ever been depicted in color so.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Monmusu Tier Chart:<br> S+: Everyone </br></br>  <br><br>I've been wondering why does Lala have to write a review when she hasn't even used the Onsen ?</br></br>  <br>Do you wan a Polt plot?</br>  <br>Sorry no<br>Darling tier: Darling<br>S+: my waifu  Miia <br>S: everyone else</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I've been wondering since normal laws don't apply to Monster Girls does that mean Polt doesn't have to pay taxes on any of her establishments ? <br><br>Or is there a special branch of the government that covers collecting taxes from Monster Girls ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Presumably, she's rich enough that she pays taxes regardless. Conversely, the government may grant her refunds in cases where there's government mandated training for very out of shape mon musus.

Then I'd say this</br>  My Hibiki is in transit to her new home.<br>What have you in transit right now,buyfags?</br>  <br> ?!? <br> ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.png <br> i <br>Are you underage?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I-I'm only 8 Anon-sama desu ka</br>  <br>Or maybe you're spending too much time on these threads.</br>    <br>Go back to having threads during wonfes/other events that happen or when scans come out like it used to be.</br>  <br>I agree.<br>They're the buyfag equivalent of the "post yfw" cancer that spread to /a/ since KLK.</br></br>  <br><br>The only people who post their MFCs are usually selling something. <br><br>Quit taking threads on an imageboard so fucking seriously, you twit. Don't like it? Stop fucking responding.</br></br></br></br>  Just had this bunny arrive today, got her for 5.5k including shipping from the HS sale.  <br> tfw you will never be stalked </br>  <br>I hope the next sword nendo will be Kasen.</br>  <br>The shoes look so fucking big.</br>  <br>Only the kuroneko's ones</br>  <br>This is easily going to be my favorite figure forever.</br>  <br><br>That's a really great figure, shame it's a GK.</br></br>  <br>Also no nipple.</br>  <br>I prefer Alter's version, even with the faded colours</br>  <br>I hadn't even noticed. That's oddly disappointing.</br>  <br>Several artbooks. I made the mistake of using Sal, now I just have to hope my package arrives before I leave for vacation.</br>  Anyone pre-ordering?  <br><br>That's a very unpopular opinion.</br></br>  <br>You sure? I don't think even my sisters had shoes that big compared to their feet.</br>  <br>Her breasts don't look as big as they're supposed to be in that picture. Needs more meat</br>  <br>I liked that it was more detailed, especially her clothes. MF's feels quite flat.</br>  <br>Enjoy your broken figures and figures that look nothing like the protype. Most of their figs turned out shit. At this rate they heading towards griffon territory.</br>  <br>Not that guy, but Alter's has better shading and detail. Look at the cape for example.<br>The pose is less interesting, and the colors seem to be an issue, but everything else about Alter's is better.</br></br>  <br>Those tits need some gravity or a tighter wrapping.</br>  <br><br>Only people who missed pre-orders believe that.</br></br>  <br>But the hair color is wrong.</br>  <br><br><br>The only thing Alter did better was the boobs, everything else is worse on her; the pose, the colors, and the art style.<br><br> I still bought it. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I certainly fit that bill. Don't even know why I waited to order her. Now I have to hope she doesn't balloon on the aftermarket.</br></br>  <br>Best IS</br>  <br>I understand you weren't here before that aired.</br>  Ugh amazon.jp increased the shipping rates for figures internationally. USA is now 1.6k per 1kg of weight (up from 1k to 1kg of weight), Europe is now 1.8k up from 1.2k to 1kg of weight.  Friendly reminder that checking your EMS tracking page every 15 minutes doesn't make your package show up any faster.  Just paid for Mordred and the FE:If N3DS cover plate which i was lucky enough to see back instock yesterday.  <br><br>That blows. Should've ordered stuff I wanted earlier</br></br>  <br>Fuck. I guess this is goodbye for me.</br>  <br>Check the archive. There's about 4 pages between 2011 and KLK, and over 75 pages between KLK and now.<br>The early 2014 ones are almost exclusively KLK.</br></br>  <br>Best taste</br>  Will NY stock the aniplex+ Rin?  Who ready for this month?  <br><br> IS <br> best anything </br></br></br>  <br>Still the best deal around I believe, between the japanese sales tax reduction and the fact that they use a 'cheap' shipping weight. IE dark angel olivia is only 1.7kg weight shipped (~2.7k yen), as opposed to some place like amiami which would add a ton of packaging and crap and it would end up being like a 3kg package and you'd have to pay 5k+ for ems.<br><br><br>Pretty much.. I was going to order like 20 figures and noticed the shipping was like 28k and it seemed off even though I have like 6 1/4ths in my cart.. did a little math and decided to check out amazons shipping fees page where I noticed the increase in price. It's not a big deal, but it is a little annoying.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384182 <br><br>I don't want to pay $100 now for something that won't be out for a year, mr shill.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127384182 <br>Can't they range ban this fucking faggot cunt already?</br>  New Buyfag here, I bought a Super Sonico Campus Life figure at a recent convention.<br><br>I've since pre-ordered Junai Kajitsu Shii Kiya Cover Girl Natsuiro Shoujo "Manatsu-chan".<br><br>Don't really know what I'm getting myself into but I like it.<br><br>Been wanting to get into figurines for a while now, I read the buyfag guide ages ago.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lewd choice.</br>  <br><br>She's there now, but you can't order her. Not sure if she sold out or what. <br><br><br><br>I've got a few things saved in my cart, but still haven't pulled the trigger cause I always think the prices will tank after.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hating all harem is cool man. <br>Grow up son</br></br>  <br>I like lewd. But I will limit myself with lewd figurines.</br>  <br><br>All harems are lazy and mostly shit, but IS is especially terrible. Just vapid wish fulfillment trash.</br></br>  <br>i didnt want any lewd figures but when i got my first lewd one i was hooked they really get my dick hard</br>  <br>It's between that and Alter's Beethoven. But I am not counting out wedding dress Saber or the Maiko Kyouko and Sayaka yet either,</br>  <br>I would get some tame figures but I'm not up-to-date with anime.<br>Most of the good figures for shows I watched before are gone.</br></br>  <br>what did he post?</br>  <br>I too, can't wait for best IM@S.</br>  <br> what did he post? <br>shill link</br></br>  <br>Heh, I do too, but what usually ends up happening is either the figure sells out or the price never drops lower than I expect it too .. and eventually sells out. Worst case scenario, the price increases.<br><br>The mika jougasaki figure just sold out, I watched it suddenly have a '20 left in stock' notice and some jackasses on amazon bought up the rest of the stock in like 5 minutes. It makes sense to do, but it's pretty lame. Once amazon is out of the way they can resell all the figures they bought for 1-2k profits or whatever.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Referral link shit</br></br>  <br><br>I never really got the point of reselling figures outside of exclusive stuff. The profits are marginal unless you have some kind of middle man cutting the shipping/fees. <br><br>Even the exclusive/long OOS stuff doesn't exactly fly off the shelves. Sure it may be worth 30k, that doesn't mean you're gonna get that much immediately if at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hibiki <br>mah nigga</br></br>  <br><br><br>Well fuck me, finally a good looking Rias fig. I thought it would never happen. Embrace Japan isn't a great maker, but they're recent stuff has been better.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, I believe the shipping fees inside japan are cheap. There used to be a 1 figure order limit on items for international customers, (don't know if it has changed) so I doubt someone from the USA or whatever bought them all up. <br><br>It was probably just some japanese person or business that felt that buying 10-20 of that figure at 7,800 yen was a good deal and there was profit to be made eventually. I mean if they posted on other amazons and stuff they could probably sell to stupid people for pretty big profits. They could also post on amazon.jp because the price will likely go up. The cheapest sealed version of that figure is now 10.8k, the people bought up the 1-2 cheap ones by 3rd party sellers going for 9k and 10k. Could potentially give pretty good returns, but as you said, your money could be tied up for a while.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>See: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;119163536 </br>  Quality is ehhhhhh  <br>Fuck off to tumblr, landwhale.</br>  <br>I agree with them for what its worth.

They generally put things into the bargain bin long before stores like AmiAmi do. The discount is calculated by an algorithm that mainly takes into account the # of units left in stock and the pace of the orders. The price of the item is updated around 6PM JST daily.  <br><br>So I read the guide, and saw this. My question is, if an Amazon.jp item goes out of stock which was being sold by Amazon.jp, will they restock it in the future, or has their inventory completely sold out? I don't have Amazon in my country, maybe someone here knows how this works.</br></br>  Fuck this.
