I guess I just never expected someone to have him as their husbando.</br>  <br>At first i thought he was silly, but some anon said that if he had a relationship he would spout Wikipedia facts while   having sex in the missionary position for the sole purpose of procreation while holding hands   and then he would make complete analysis about it just to show them and ask for his couple to do the same so they can get better at it. That was so cute.</br>  <br><br>We can't help who we love, anon.

I would like the Vocaloids more if they had more of a backstory.  Comedy SoL  It would probably be something like Idolmaster or Love Live  As long as it has Rin fanservice, I wouldn't care.  <br>Worst vocaloid, twins in any anime are always the worst characters</br>  It'd be 5 minute shorts, a minute and a half of each being dedicated to a music video.  <br>you take that shit back</br>  See Black Rock Shooter TV. Or Mekakucity Actors.<br>A piece of shit, basically.</br>  <br>please no. i didnt understand mekaku city actors, they force a plot.</br>  <br>SoL, comedy and for God's sake avoid any romance subplot.</br>  <br>The making of popular videos. I remember in "Life is beautiful" someone saying how all the Vocaloids would think the story was about two lovers who died until everyone saw the tittle.</br>  <br>Not if it's future Rin, she's sex.</br>  <br> avoid any romance subplot. <br>Fucking this. While on the subject on an anime adaption, who would be the staff in charge of it?</br></br>  <br>I'd love it if they took the plots for their most famous songs and played them out as full episodes like actors. <br>Then maybe give their two cents after credits and make them small talk until next episode of plot and song.</br></br>   One human girl, trying to become a singer in a world dominated by computer-generated singers. <br> people think human singers are outdated and never sound so good as computer-generated singers <br>   The girl is Miku </br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br> I would like the Vocaloids more if they had more of a backstory. <br><br>No you faggot thats not how they work.</br></br></br>  Pure guro with boobs. That's what it's all about nowadays. At least it won't be a harem, oh wait...   Comedy SoL with best girl in it   Cyberpunk  <br>Not crypton. No chance.</br>  <br>One can dream, anon.<br><br> ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>SoL, drama animated in CG like this one.<br>https://<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6WIQ30c<wbr>QgtE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Probably idol anime  Was surprised the Sonico anime wasn't shit. Maybe Vocaloid would be okay too.<br><br>Problem is that Vocaloid's popularity has to do more with everything else -&gt;besides&lt;- the voices.<br><br>All those fan mmd movies don't have them talk because their voices suck at simple conversations.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sonico anime wasn't shit </br>  In the Shit Genre.<br><br>Just like the Touhou Anime and Boatslut Anime.</br></br>  <br> because of magic or something Miku becomes real and start living in MC's house <br> on first they have to deal with some real world problems, but it's mostly SoL <br> because Miku is good at singing, they practice and make songs together <br> as Miku becomes more popular they realize that other Vocaloids became real as well and spend lot's of time with them <br> MC start to feel distant from Miku and became afraid that he might lose her if she decided to join her old friends <br> however Miku realize that she has fallen in love with MC <br> near the end there is a concert with all the Vocaloids <br> and after that Miku and MC realize that they need each other, confess their feelings and decide to not separate anymore <br> &gt;tfw this will never be real </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Madoka shitheads ladies and gentlemen</br>  <br>The first two episodes were non-stop unadulterated shit.<br>The rest of it was okay.</br></br>  Read the guide before asking anything buyfag related, contains all the basic info and much more:<br><br>http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  <br> Having dirt show on your figure's promotional shot </br>  <br>What dirt?</br>  <br>Right there on her tit.</br>  <br>Clean your screen, man.</br>  <br>Joe dirt</br>  <br>they want 14k for this<br> how </br></br>  <br>Not seeing it, unless you are retarded enough to think the shadow tones are dirt.</br>  <br>Time to clean up your monitor m8.<br>Also meme girl is dead. Anime sold like shit, rip.</br></br>  <br>Literally nothing there.</br>  <br>Blind or joking?</br>  <br>Didn't bother watching the show, was it even any good?</br>  <br>That fucking face</br>  <br>Fuck no.<br>Typical super special strong male MC in a generic RPG-inspired fantasy world full of girls who want his dick to varying degrees.</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>no</br>  <br><br><br>I thought so, I'm a sucker for girls with twintails, and this bitch is pretty decent looking, but I can't be assed to watch the show when I could tell just from this gif its faggot shit.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't care about the meme, I like her character and I like her appearance so I'll just buy it.</br>  <br><br><br><br>/a/ didn't like it, its probably good.</br></br></br></br>  <br> asking /a/ if an anime was any good </br>  <br>Hestia is only popular because she's an H design in a non H anime. She's designed to be sexualized, that's all.</br>  <br>http://hestia.dance/</br>  Taking all bets; how hard with Hestia figs bin.<br><br>I'm thinking at least 40%.</br></br>  What's the quality on Q-Six figures usually like for the price? That Lovers figure is pretty tempting.  <br>*my shiny teeth and me*<br><br>Nah, I like girls with twintails too, and that wasn't enough to make me like Hestia. It's not worth it.</br></br></br>  still waiting  <br>Design wise, her outfit is the only unique thing about her, dark haired twin tails are a dime a dozen, i can't speak for her personality or anything since I haven't seen the show but her looks are not enough to hook me.</br>  God, I can't wait for the others to be released. Chihaya and Haruka are a must, personally. Yukiho too.<br><br>Still, at the rate they're going, it's gonna be a while</br></br>  <br>ANd you will be losing since the very start, given this one is made to order so it can't bin.</br>  Got these recently, cute as fuck. I hope the anime isn't shit.  <br>This isn't /v/ you fucktard.</br>  <br> dark haired twin tails are a dime a dozen, <br>So, are you saying we need to create new hait color to make a character unique.</br></br>  <br>I'm looking forward to Chihaya and Haruka the most too.<br>At least its not releasing as slow as their figma line, which seems to have been halted in favor of cinderella girls.</br></br>  <br>Whoa, where at anon?</br>  <br>Haruka's gonna be last. Gonna give fans a reason to collect them all.</br>  <br>Mami is the perfect daughteru, and Ami is a shit-tier whore.<br><br>Being Mamifag is suffering.</br></br></br>  <br>Azusa and Ritsuko are all I want.</br>  <br>Meant to quote </br>  <br> http://shopping.hobidas.com/shop/g/<wbr>g110377</wbr> </br>  <br>Ritsuko should come out really nice, but Azusa im not so sure.<br>Her art is drawn from a high perspective, it might not look to good in figure form but I guess we will wait and see how that goes.<br>I think Chihaya is going to look stunning as long as they don't fuck it up somehow.</br></br></br>  I can't wait for the Monster Girl merchandise. Figures when?  anyone know a cheap place to get movic stuff or should I just proxy directly off their website?  <br>I wish I could, but I'm really running out of space and money.<br><br>Just gonna be Iori, Yukiho, Chihaya, Haruka, and Makoto for me, and that'll be it buyfag-wise for a while..</br></br></br>  <br>I SEE IT!<br><br> I'm so sorry </br></br></br>  Hmm. Anyone going to go for her?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>They could have made a Saber figure instead.<br>What were they thinking?</br></br>    <br> mfw </br>  <br> tits too big <br> wafer thin waist <br><br>Of course I fucking am.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> fruit roll-up as a cape </br></br>  <br>They could probably get away with re-angling Azusa's head down a little so she's more forward facing. I agree, she'll probably be difficult for them to pull off, but I'll buy her regardless. Besides the wedding one, none of her other scales look particularly great either but I have them all.</br>  <br><br>When?</br></br>  <br>Takane is really the worst of the bunch, in this line anyway.<br><br>She looks like an old woman, and it's a shame because otherwise she's best girl.</br></br></br>  <br>I imaine Azusa will be leaning forward until her face is level. I really like her outfit even though I don't care for her as a character that much. <br><br>Red indicating that which didn't order/don't want, so I'm glad it's only the girls I want left now. <br><br>If only Takane had turned out better.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh shit now I want fruit leather.<br><br>Thanks asshole.</br></br></br>  <br>Why did they fuck up the Archer fig but this one looks great</br>  Lucina's price on amiami is 6800JPY, which is the MSRP with Jap tax included. I thought they excluded the tax for the gaijin site?  <br>Yeah I'd hope they take some liberty for the sake of the figure but who knows, I thought they'd mess with makoto but they didn't really do anything with her, and we still don't know how they're doing ami and mami.<br><br>Leaning forward could work I guess, could be kind of similar to yayoi.</br></br></br>  <br><br> tfw my screen is dirty as fuck and it actually looks like the figure is filthy </br></br>  <br>They up the price nearer release lately.</br>  <br>I really want to see some scales eventually.</br>  <br>This. I prefer shows with weak, useless MCs with girls lusting after every other cock instead of his.</br>  <br>The best poses are the ones where they have their mouths closed. They'll also be the least cockmongly figs, then.</br>  <br>I liked Takane's, but I seem to be in the minority here on her. The only ones I really don't want are Yukiho, Haruka, Hibiki, Makoto, or Yayoi. So I'm still looking forward to seeing the rest.</br>    <br><br>Because someone at Alter said<br><br> Hey guys, maybe we should turn him into fujobait to get more sales! <br><br>And then they lost mine and of around 8 friends that also wanted it. Fuck them. Hope Orange (GSC+MF) can deliver on a non fujoshit Archer in the near future.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's going up on Japanese Aniplex+ on the 27th.</br>  <br> Nendos come out <br> Cerea and Miia have separate lower halves <br> Can make just about any Nendo a centaur or a lamia <br>Just go ahead and take my money.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How does a character become fujobait?</br>  <br> 8 whole friends </br>  <br>Mind if I join you?</br>  <br><br>By turning him into a 16 year old pretty boy when he's far from that.</br></br>  <br>I think I have seen more people here that like Sexy Grandma. I understand the poses are based off the DVD covers but those poses are just downright silly.</br>  <br> scales <br>Wheyyy.</br></br>  <br>Cerea Figma when?</br>  <br>That would be a breath of fresh air honestly.</br>  I got some art books from amazon JP and the box is much smaller than normal, maybe within an inch of the books on two sides. <br>The shrinkwrap was tight enough to hold them in place, but I don't want to risk it with them again.</br>  <br>It's more like someone said <br> let's use Takeuchi original gorilla arms design and not the updated ufo one that everyone wants <br>Seriously though I hope he gets another one because it's just awful</br></br></br>  <br>I always wondered if Amazon jp's packaging sucks as much shit as what I get from regular Amazon.</br>  <br>I think her design doesn't even translate all that well into a figure. Kinda boring when not in motion.</br>  <br><br>Is your autobiography getting an anime adaptation?</br></br>  <br>I do like Takane, but I will try get her on the aftermarket. <br>I have a lot of preorders at the moment so I can't exactly afford her at the moment.</br></br>   want to get this babe <br> dont want my mom thinking I like fat 3dpd <br><br>I hate real life 3dpd but for some reason Pochaco triggers my penis.</br></br></br>  <br>maybe you should just kill her</br>  <br> aftermarket <br>judging how iori and hibiki turned out im kinda worried about the aftermarket for takane</br></br>  I want to bury my face into Wo ass.    Bell-kun  <br>Po-chan &lt;3</br>  <br> At least its not releasing as slow as their figma line, which seems to have been halted in favor of cinderella girls. <br>Very true.<br><br>They're releasing the line faster than I thought they would. A third or something is already out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>More like bell-end, amirite?</br>  <br>cg ruins everything<br>the soulless cash grab wins again<br>not that the originals are not cash grabs</br></br></br>    <br>That's really cute</br>  <br>Exclusives can drop in price on the aftermarket if no one wants them. It just might take longer than it does with a standard release.</br>  <br>What's this from?</br>  I'm about to order from AmiAmi for the first time.<br><br>Do they put the bill on the outside of the package or do they put it inside?</br></br>  <br>are you stupid?</br>  <br>Both</br>  <br>So? Prices going down in the aftermarket DOES NOT mean a figure bins. For the later to happen the offer should be higher than the demand which is exactly what drives the prices to the point stores put them in their offer bins.</br>    <br>dominos</br>  <br><br>sure</br></br>  <br>Amiko doesn't leave the sales tax out of their prices, they just give a higher discount percent so it looks like they do. BiJ, HLJ and HS leave the tax off the prices from the start.</br>  <br>I mean, it's obviously Miku, but is it from a specific song?</br>  http://animaru.jp/shop/pages/k-on_f<wbr>igure_tsumugi.aspx/</wbr>  <br>I'd rather an Echidna scale, that would be hot.<br><br> And she would be delayed </br></br></br>  <br>Clear when?</br>  <br>"Miku Expo is coming to Shanghai! Of course we have the cutest Exclusive Nendoroid Miku to join her too!!"</br>  <br> The figure of Kotobuki Tsumugi has been canceled, due to unforeseen circumstances she will only be available at the black market. </br>  <br> 301x336 </br>  <br>Slightly higher res</br>  <br><br>Wish this retarded joke would die.</br></br>  <br>Ah, great. Thanks for the info.</br>  <br>I really don't want to get onto the slope that is miku nendos, but she's so beautiful</br>  <br>just avoid slipping</br>  <br>Holy shit she's beautiful. I already have enough Miku nendos but I don't think I want to resist this one.</br>  <br> figure sits on shelf at retail price, doesn't sell <br> price is lowered until someone buys it <br>That's exactly what binning is. Of course producing more than people currently want is a more frequent reason for binning, but a character losing popularity or a better figure coming out will also cause it.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;figure sits on shelf at retail price, doesn't sell <br>Thats the point, the figure doesn't sit at retail price since there are no distributors, anything on the market after the release is second-hand.<br><br>That is not binning at all.</br></br></br></br>  The bird died :(  <br>Actually it's not, binning is making it's way into a distributor's sales bin AND the price going down because of that, and exclusives don't have distributors beside the manufacturer/production company themselves, that's why technically they can't bin. Only decrease their price at the after market.</br>  <br>You're going to follow suit I hope.</br>  <br>Give it a Viking funeral.</br>  <br>Then get out of the mine.</br>  <br>it's a message from your cat<br> you next </br></br>  <br><br>BiJ and N-Y are distributors. If people cancel their orders, they're left with figures they may or may not be able to sell right away. I'm sure there are other stores worldwide that deal with exclusives too, and have the same problems.<br><br>And the definition of binning is to sell something at a reduced price. Exclusives are sold at full retail plus tax so technically, selling it for anything below that is binning, though most would probably agree there's a threshold it has to cross first before it's actually considered binning.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off with your shitposting emoticons.</br>  <br> BiJ and N-Y are distributors <br>Wrong, they are resellers</br></br>  <br> BiJ and N-Y are distributors <br><br><br>Yeah no, not for exclusives, they are scalpers, resellers if you want to call them that</br></br></br></br>  <br> And the definition of binning is to sell something at a reduced price <br><br><br>Actually it's not, comes from the fact that they are in the sales bin of the distributors, not just because their price got reduced. By your definition the lower than retail prices amiami offers are binning.</br></br></br></br>  Woah!  <br> And finally, the ongoing DRAMAtical Murder series will also become ORANGE ROUGE! <br> ongoing <br><br>Soon. I hope they'll announce his nendo at Wonfes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>best dinghy</br>  <br>The ships floating around her look kind of half-arsed, with their clear bases and black support stands. A cool idea in theory but the execution is shitty. If I get her I think I'll display her without them.</br>  <br><br>Whatever. If a figure is sitting in their warehouse because they can't get rid of it until they lower the price enough, and that price is below retail and the figure is an exclusive, it's binning. And they also lose money since they don't get a discount when buying it.<br><br><br>Yes, okay, anything below the initial discount price can technically be considered binning. It's just the more radical examples like 50% off that jump out at people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I am pretty happy that amazon.jp put her up for global shipping.</br>  <br><br>Oh come the fuck on, I already have two Miku nendos.</br></br>  <br>Lame, it was cute.</br>  <br> And they also lose money since they don't get a discount when buying it. <br>Main point here is neither the makers nor the real distributors lose money, it's the reseller who does, that is second hand.<br><br><br>It's like a random anon buying a second copy of a figure and never selling it because the local market is not that friendly.<br><br>Just deal with it, your definition of binning is fucked up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> two <br>Whoa, watch out for that slope.</br></br>  <br> anything below the initial discount price can technically be considered binning <br><br><br>You just went full retard. Your usage of the word binning is screwed beyond belief.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off back to where you came from.</br>  <br><br>Shit, I want it. Surely they'll put it up for order in their store, right? It won't be like Ahri where you have to go to the damn country the event is in to get one for non-ridiculous prices, right?</br></br>  <br>It's too late for me, anon, she has too many designs I like.</br>  Not sure whether to get the tan version or the standard...  <br>Neither because it looks like shit.</br>  Well AmiAmi just took my money. Now I just have to sit back and wait for the other two girls to be released. Only thing I don't like is how they changed the base. Not going to look right next to the other two.  <br>The thing about Ahri is that it was a commission by Riot. So GSC couldn't sell it even if they wanted to.</br>  I got Alters Estelle and Raven and that Jubilee scale on a whim. Eventually I'll work my way up to Yuri and Rita  <br>Best loliballer when?</br>  Nice display.  <br> Best loliballer when? <br>She was released first.</br></br>  <br>Damn. Someone really put a lot of effort into this.</br>  <br>Can't I have Sakurider instead? Or how about that BB figure that was announced a while back? Or maybe just a decent Sakura figure besides that one Dark Sakura with the weird hair/forehead.</br>  <br>I'm pissed about the base too. Saki is next and she'll be getting the same curved base.</br>  <br>Oops, you can't see her behind the ugly giant in that picture.</br>  <br><br>Once HF comes out maybe.<br><br> Who am I kidding it's going to be full of Sabers like always </br></br></br></br>  <br>I know. So I'll have two with the first style base and three with the curved based. Since Maho is my second favorite loliball I can't just hide her in the back.</br>  <br>I'm surprised they didn't make some sort of deal. Going by the resale prices she would've sold very well as a standard release or as a Riot/GSC store exclusive.</br>  <br>HF will just be an excuse to make more Saber Alters. Maybe a Rider or two. We'd be lucky to get a Sakura.</br>  <br>Two flat and three curved isn't so bad.<br>You can display them like X Y X Y X.</br></br>  gamagori fig when?  <br>just buy a mako for scale and then print a poster out that'll cover a wall for gamagori</br>  <br><br>Airi is love. Airi is life.</br></br>  <br>Just watch them do re-releases of the first two with the new base  as exclusives. </br>  <br>She's too  short <br><br><br>I'd be fucking pissed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The ships themselves are pretty cool, but your right about the stand/base.<br><br>And to me they distract too much from Wo herself.</br></br></br>  <br>I was hoping that Saki would have her hair down in her bunny figure. Hair down Saki is sexy.</br>  <br>Holy fuck, that's honestly the worst loliballer you could've chosen.</br>  <br>Really? Well I hope that happens</br>    <br>She's not the worst. Close. <br><br>They go in order:<br>Tomoka<br>Maho<br>Hinata<br>Saki<br>Airi</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  exclusive  <br>Not bad, but this is the real order:<br>Tomoka<br>Hinata<br>Airi<br>Maho<br>Saki</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Would you?  Fucking release when  <br> Maho that low <br>End your life. It isn't worth anything.</br></br>  <br>Tomoka beats Maho because of the better personality. Maho is cute as hell though.</br>  <br><br>They all suck. LeBron would beat the shit out of all of them.</br></br>  <br><br>Ill help you guys out since it looks like you need it.<br><br>In order:<br>Airi<br>Hinata<br>Tomoka<br>Maho<br>Shit<br>More shit<br>Aoi<br>Even more shit<br>Saki</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I kinda wanted Maho, but if I am to choose just one it'll be Saki for sure.</br>  <br>Only utter fuckwits hate any of them.</br>  <br>Shitty weeaboo art</br>  pedophiles please go  <br>Not sure. Both LeBron and the loliballers have a hard time winning championships. <br><br><br>But Airi's personality sucks. She's not cute. Has too big of boobs. Is scared of everything. Has too big of boobs. And is the weakest girl on the team. She also has too big of boobs.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>She was annoying as fuck, though. To coincide with that statement, she was objectively the most cliched character in the show. These two very major faults could have been forgiven if she was even the slightest bit attractive, which she wasn't. At least she wasn't Saki, though, right?</br></br></br>  <br>Event or store?</br>  <br><br>I'm reminded of that loliball thread that had some real-life basketball announcers calling a loliball game.</br></br>  <br>Miku Expo exclusive, but GSC apparently said on their Facebook she'll be up in their store too at some point after the expo. I haven't fact checked this so it could be devious lies.</br>  In the end, does it matter? We'll all have all five loliballers and then sit around wondering if the fifth graders will ever be released. Oh to have TsubaHii. <br><br><br>Damn, must have missed that.</br></br></br>  Hair up or down?  <br>TsubaHii a double nigger</br>  <br>Hair down. Definitely down.</br>  <br>Aren't all their exclusives available from their store?</br>  <br>Because Sakura / BB is shit, hopefully never.</br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/766112<wbr>35</wbr></br>  <br>Thank you kind anon.

The two things on the far right are pre-order bonuses for purchasing the two books together.</br>  <br>Such a shame I missed those, guess someday I might be able to get them(bonuses include). By the way, thanks for the info anon.</br>  Which store has the cheapest shipping for book/artbooks? I've bought the namaniku atk one and some queen's blade books from HLJ. Other places seem to be about the same or worse.  <br>It's pretty much the same everywhere. Shipping prices mostly depend on weight, and books are heavy.<br><br>Amazon.jp has fixed shipping prices that depend only on quantity, and not weight, thus potentially cheaper. However, their packaging is very poor and it is highly likely that your items will arrive damaged.</br></br></br>  I like this character and her proportions<br><br>I don't like the hair and the corset apparently has a weird paint job that makes it almost look dirty to me.</br></br>  She's cute.<br>I want her.</br>  <br>Buy her.<br>And don't forget to purchase her lover/sister.</br></br>  <br>I'm not a fan of the way her clothes are vacuum-sealed to her almost perfectly spherical tits.</br>  <br>Am I the only one that hates it when they add visible nipples to figures?</br>  <br>wait for MF or OS</br>  The hair would take up so much space, but I kinda like the design.  <br>Same. Only apparent downside for me.<br><br><br>I don't think they're 'visible nipples'. Just slightly coned at that part. Probably not even noticable when you actually have it. I know a lot of figures that looked like the nipples were a lot more prominent under clothes in promo pictures, but in actuality they're not at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Does she wear stripes?</br>  <br>Just white underneath</br>  <br>Are there any Planetes figs? I cant find any</br>  <br>No there is not.</br>  <br>Why not ;_;. It would be a good line</br>  <br>Not popular enough.<br>Not enough hot girls or distinctive designs.<br>If it was a series like Yamato/2199 in which the women wore skin-tight space suits then it'd probably get plenty.<br>Sad fact of life that the really good shit rarely if ever gets figures.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Miku the Gauna Edition </br>  <br>There's a few space suit designs. The Van Braun and toybox. I'm sad. Can't even afford the series box set</br>  <br>That face is pretty fucked</br>  Any canadafags here have any issues importing daki cases?  Fucking stupid  <br>That looks horrible</br>  <br>I wish more weird shit like this got figures. It's a shame that most official stuff sticks with designs that either look mostly human or mostly mech.</br>  <br>I agree. I want to see more macabre figs.<br>But cute/sexy sells far too well.</br></br>  Who Cu-poche here?  <br><br>some dude from futaba sculpted it from scratch</br></br>  <br>Shame. I'd buy it if it were for sale.</br>  <br>that's crap, now this is art.</br>  <br>that dude is seriously into KoS</br>  <br>I actually do like this one too, but I never finished reading the manga.</br>  <br>Yeah I've wanted that for a long time. <br>Too bad it's impossible to find legit kit. I don't want to get a recast.</br></br>  <br>Caught up, I should say.</br>  <br>can anyone please reply?</br>  <br>It's kind of cool I guess but how the fuck do you explain having that in your house?</br>  <br>literally inferior nendos</br>  <br>It's like 3am and you waited less than a half hour.</br>  <br>Why would you need to explain it and to whom?</br>  <br>You are confused friendo, you are thinking about Nanorich</br>  <br><br>I'm fairly sure anyone who owns something like that lives in either a basement and never goes out or is more alone than a lighthouse.</br></br>  <br>No, just don't use dhl if it's a nude loli.</br>  <br> Chocolina Miku </br>  <br>I'm disappointed that this is from a MAD.</br>  Did I screw up? There's a hologram sticker on the box that reflects but it says "made in china" on the bottom...  <br>Yep, bootleg</br>  <br>Shit, dude, just look at the sculpture.</br>  <br>He lusts for her young body.</br>  <br>I'll be nice because it's a slow thread and I like Horo. She looks legit.<br><br>Almost all figures are made in China. Lurk more. Take it easy.</br></br></br>  <br>LOL</br>  How much longer must I wait, I thought I'd have been invoiced for them by now.

My Japanese is not amazing, so some things I had to assume the original was right in, but at least the English grammar is now readable. Also there are a few things lost in translation, especially さしすせそ, but if that's a problem, just go learn Japanese already.<br><br>Instructions for inserting the script into the VN can be found here: https://www.mediafire.com/folder/67<wbr>05q59djxz5n/YuYuYuS<br><br>It took a lot longer than I expected, mainly because the game crashes if there isn't a line break in the right space in every single goddamn line and English takes up so much more space than Japanese. Still, it would've been impossible without the guy who provided the mediafire files for inserting the script into the VN (see above), so kudos to him.<br><br>If someone else wants to do other ones, I'd be happy to provide editing/translating work for the other 2 crappy translations ( http://pastebin.com/3Jn10QDg and http://pastebin.com/cGYp9HEy ) but I'm not going through that line-spacing nightmare again.

See you in 8 hours  <br><br><br>OK what's even supposed to be happen on these pics?</br></br></br>  Wait, so it's just a LN? No second season or whatever? Well damn.    <br><br>*happening</br></br>  S2 when?  <br><br>Scans when? Mine will take one month to arrive.</br></br>  <br>Why are they so gay, god damn.</br>  hey, remember that time Yuuna punched a thing.  Hey guys, script anon here. I've been really busy lately, but now I have some time to work on adding translation data.<br>Also some good news, while fiddling with the data files I found how to remove the text size limit, so separating lines won't be necessary anymore, I also found how to translate the color codes for names so adding the @ won't be necessary either.<br><br><br>Yeah the most annoying part is getting the line breaks right, but the crashing issue should disappear with this fix, if you can edit the other translations I'll gladly add them to the script file.<br><br>After I'm done re-editing the existing translations so they work with the new fix I'll upload them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, good times</br>  <br>There's still 3 unannounced news so I'm pretty sure a second season will be one of them. I'm not surprised they haven't released any information about a s2 yet considering it was only a short while ago s1 aired and they didn't expect it to get the popularity it did. I rather wait for them to pan out the details than rush it.</br>  <br>i l-love you anon</br>  <br>You're doing God's work anon!</br>  Got some tiny bit of information<br> The new LN chapter doesn't directly connect to the supposed S2 but to Nowayu. <br> Highlight is Wakaba's picture. <br> Chapter has an unrest atmosphere. <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Cleaned this picture up a little bit.<br>Though, having a scan in 1200 dpi and original size I'd be able to make it look better.</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> &gt;Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>It kills my kokoro that we know that something is wrong with Yuuna but we don't even know what exactly.<br>During the whole second VN Yuuna acted like she was daijobu so the others don't have to worry.<br>God damn it Yuuna you are supposed to talk to someone if you are troubled ;_; <br>Protect Yuuki Yuuna, even if she is 100% Vertex or godess or whatever now she still is perfect!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> &gt;Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna may turn out to be 0% human </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>c-come on anon,,, t-tell me it's a joke ;_;</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>Why this</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br><br>So she's an immortal divine being with the  soul of a lion  now.</br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br><br>I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS</br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>W-which Yuuna?</br></br>  <br>Thanks anon.</br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>REAL HUMAN BEAN</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  Okay, guys. Brace yourself for chapter summary, as well as a tiny snapshot of Wakaba. <br> Chapter starts with Sonoko and Karin in the bath talking about candidates for the next club head. <br> When Sonoko went home she found an old Hero Record book. <br> Content has been heavily censored by Taisha. <br> However, at the last page there's a picture of a girl that looks like her. <br> The name is Nogi Wakaba, the year is 2015. <br> Sonoko shows the book to the club. <br> When Yuuna looks at Wakaba's picture, she's a bit surprised but also has an "of course that's how it is" reaction. <br> She spaces out and only comes back to her sense when Fuu calls out to her. <br> Last illustration is of the entire club looking at Wakaba's picture. <br> Yuuna's the only one with her eyes hidden in the pic. <br> Chapter ends. <br><br>Inb4, the old Yuuna's soul hijacks our current Yuuna's body.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Content has been heavily censored by Taisha. <br>damn not again Taisha</br></br>    <br>I'm scared, /a/. Also, <br> 2015 </br></br>  <br> Yuuna's the only one with her eyes hidden in the pic. <br><br>I bet her soul is  burning as hot as the sun .</br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna's the only one with her eyes hidden in the pic. <br>I don't want to see her cry...</br></br>  <br>Guys, we got too used to the cute SoL moments in the vita and VNs. This is the true face of Takahiro. Brace yourselves.</br>  <br>E-everything will be ok.</br>  <br> Yuuna suffering continues <br>I can't go on guys, this is too much for my heart.<br>Can't she just punch things back into daijobu again? ;_;<br>God I need NoWaYu now</br></br></br></br>  <br>Y-yeha be postive guys!<br>The healing will feel even better after Yuuna dealt with the next shit happening. She is a hero she won't lose! let's just belive in her!<br>You're likely to succceed if you try!</br></br></br>  Okay, prediction time:<br>Yuuna absorbed a part of Leo's soul when she touched the core. She was in coma because of the adjustments in her soul that had to happen.<br>Leo's soul is now sleeping inside her waiting for a trigger to wake it up. I can see two different paths from there:<br>1. Yuuna becomes a combined hero-super-vertex and the final boss, Tougou calls out to her, Yuuna fights within her soul against Leo and wins.<br>2. Leo is actually an observer and messenger and its task is to see what's going on inside of the walls of the Shinju-sama and to assess if they should continue trying to destroy humanity or if the Shinju has a point.</br></br></br></br>  we evangelion now  <br>I'd like the first thing.  Actually as long as Yuuna is fine in the end I'd love any ending I guess. <br>The whole Takashima deal makes all this a bit complicated though. I think because of the <br> When Yuuna looks at Wakaba's picture, she's a bit surprised but also has an "of course that's how it is" reaction. <br>we can assume that Yuuna either has <br>A. The memories of Takashima<br>B. Is Takashima<br>Just being named after her won't work now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  God I need these YuYuYu Character songs now.<br>I am in need of healing.</br>  <br>Or may be Takashima   is Leo </br>  <br>Or maybe Takashima got absorbed by Leo, and now both got absorbed by Yuuna.</br>  <br><br><br>It would make a lot of sense that the humans dying within that small world reincarnate over and over again as they have nowhere else to go.<br>I like this idea a lot </br></br></br></br>  <br>I still like the Yuuna unintentionally absorbed Leo as fuel and is slowly becoming a godess theory. As time goes on she is becoming more aware of the past events and her blacking out is the recalling of past events triggered by her immediate surroundings. That play that they put on may have actually occurred word for word in the past.</br>   mfw all the people who got crazy about Yuuna's fainting after ep.12 aired were right after all   Guys, I think we're too naive to thinks that there'll be any scans in the near future. Remember that this is from a Visual Fanbook, not a magazine, not many people are willing to dissect their book to scan it.  <br><br>Makes me wonder why there are no paper-thin flexible scanners. There are paper-thin flexible displays, shouldn't be too hard to create something like that using a combination of microscopic light sources and detectors that basically create a snapshot of the surface they're put on.</br></br>  <br>T-try not to give up ;_;</br>  i need more healing already...  <br>Just gives me incentive to buy the books myself.</br>  I want to fuck Yuuna.  <br>Healing when ;_;</br>  <br>Staying true in her time of struggle, eh?</br>  <br>Alright, here's Yuuki Yuuna 24-hour coverage, edited/retranslated: http://pastebin.com/QpW8Dys6<br><br>Note that the original TLs don't distinguish between Tougou dialogue and Tougou narration - I've left it as is, but if you get confused anywhere let me know.<br><br>Actually, the original translations were a lot worse for this one, reading like a machine translation at times - my favourite parts were the copy-paste definition of 顔パス - "free admission for being well known" and the translation of 国語 as "national language" instead of Japanese. <br><br>Note everyone that this scenario contains the most information about Yuuna's post-recovery status that we get in the VN.<br><br> Tougou: There are still mysteries left, but with everyone, I'm sure... <br> Tougou: I casually raise my head to the sky. <br> Tougou: Since it is noon, the stars aren't visible. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tougou is becoming a stalker.<br><br>Also<br> Tougou: However, did they really return? <br> Tougou: Could it be that we were granted something new...? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn Takahiro! i'm not ready for this!</br>  <br>No need for that, my copy will arrive in about 4 days. If there's still no scans for 2nd translator anon, I'll take up the task myself.<br><br><br> Yuuna's soul (consciousness) fused with Leo and then got taken away as offering. <br> When Shinju "returned" the offerings, it "accidentally" mistook Yuuki Yuuna's soul with Takashima Yuuna's because they're too similar. <br>I can see this happening.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tougou: ...I let them know about being chosen as an offering. <br> Tougou: However, no one is to blame for the human sacrifices. <br> Tougou: Just being delighted with my recovery is sufficient. <br>About this part, I think it should be<br> ...My parents knew about me being chosen as offering. <br> However, no one is to blame for the human sacrifices. <br> Just seeing how they're so delighted with my recovery is sufficient. <br>As seen in Wasuyu, Taisha only hid the truth from the heroes, not their parents so it'd be weird for Tougou to be the one letting them know. Her parents knew the truth and didn't do anything about it, however, seeing how they still truly care about her, she doesn't blame them anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Such a mature behaviour from a teenaged girl really strains my suspension of disbelief.<br> Just kidding. </br></br></br>  <br>It's 喜んでくれただけで, which definitely means that the parents are the one's being delighted with Tougou's recovery. I think I intended it to be "Just them being delighted with my recovery is sufficient" but accidentally a word. Sorry.</br>  <br><br>I don't get it.</br></br>  <br>However, the "let them know" is correct, 知らされていた definitely implies Tougou imparting the information to her parents.</br>  <br>Wait nevermind, I'm an idiot. The information was imparted to the parents but not by Tougou, you were right.</br>  <br><br>I love Karin</br></br>    <br>She looks like a mix between Sonoko and Wasshi.</br>  <br><br>That's a fucking glorious hairstyle.</br></br>  <br>Hot damn, she looks like some bad-ass Taisha hitwoman</br>  <br> Or may be Takashima is Leo <br>Or may be Takashima Yunna is   Yuuki Yuuna, when she is in coma. Mental time travel yo. So they actually foreshadow it in the spin off?? Damn. </br></br>  <br> time travel shenanigans <br><br>Now we're talking.</br></br></br>   Standing on top of Kamagura castle's inner right citadel in Kaogawa prefecture, Nogi Wakaba stared at Seto Inland sea.  <br>6 main characters:<br> Nogi Wakaba <br> Kamisato Hinata <br> Takashima Yuuna <br> Gun Chikage <br> Doi Tamako <br> Iyoshima Anzu <br><br>Tfw Wakaba's flower is the same as Tougou.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Forgot to mention, for this one, Takahiro's just in charge of planning, Akashiro Aoi'll be the one writing it.</br>  <br> Gun Chikage <br><br>I hope that is also her weapon of choice.</br></br></br>  <br><br>So I missed a few threads, this is going to be another LN series like WaSuYu?</br></br>  <br>Yes, it'll be about the very first group of hero back in the time before they changed the calendar.</br>  <br> Iyoshima Anzu <br>Actually, it's "Iyojima Anzu".</br></br>  <br>Elysium works fine, Bloatgirls if you desire so.<br><br> Lesbian <br> LESBIAN <br>You delusional fuck she even writes that her dream is to become a wife.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's Marugame Castle, which is the one that Sumi visited with her mother in episode 10.<br>So the setting will probably be the same as WaSuYu's, meaning that the old Yuushas won't have to see their homes turn to fire at the end of the LN.</br></br>  <br>Elysium's release is overfiltered garbage.</br>  <br>Yeah, my mistake, it's Marugame castle.<br>Their home won't turn into fire but the rest of the world might. <br><br>Got another interesting detail in the new chapter<br> Sonoko talks about the type of person she likes. <br>  &gt;It sounds exactly like she's describing Wasshi.  </br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/651<wbr>19<br> 2018 <br> mfw 2015 nao <br>THE SUFFERING NEVER ENDS<br>WE HAVE NO FUTURE</br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>I don't really know how to tell the difference man, the only thing I can measure is blurriness and even that I'm not very good at.</br>  <br>Tfw Vertices's attack is in 2015.

Brothers!  <br>God, this series is so shit. I can't believe I forced myself to watch this season to the end.</br>  Apparently Ayane Sakura got confessed to by Yui's VA  So, can we try and pinpoint the moment she fell for the MC? Because I'm well aware that opinions will differ on this.<br><br>My guess would be sometime during volume 9, while getting all the help from 8man but whether that's when she overheard the genuine request or before, I'm not sure.</br></br>  <br>But both are females?</br>  <br><br>Well, that's hot.</br></br>  did commie make a mistake here or is this some new meme i haven't heard of yet?  <br>How new do you have to be to not know the 8man/Batman comparison?</br>  Why does it seem like there is going to be another episode next week?  <br>she fell for him that time he forcefully took her bag in the chrismas event (that time when she said she can carry it by herself).</br>  <br> not in the last episode for even a second  <br>B T F O<br>T<br>F<br>O</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hard to say but she went gloom in the library when 8man brought up Yukino and Yui so who knows. Think about it, her only threat that time should be Yumiko if we assumed she was gunning for Hayama.</br>  Iroha chan !~  <br>I think the same. She realized that she was merely attracted to Hayama but started falling for Hachiman after hearing the speech.She understood that she was chasing Hayama superficially and wanted something genuine .too</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127245940 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127245973 <br>3rd time's a charm</br></br>  <br>Well, falling in love isn't something that goes from black to white in an instant. Her rejections are a hint about how she really feels about 8man at each moment.<br><br>I would say the first time 8man offered to get her bags, she started developing feelings for him, which grew stronger by every passing day he helped her.<br><br>The rejection about 8man liking younger girls scored a bunch of points too.<br><br>The peak would be the genuine scene and the rejection from Hayama just confirmed her feelings for 8man</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Praise our goddess!  What a terrible ending, not even open-end harems end this bluntly  I can't remember the last time a girl's fanbase was this cancerous.  Brothers!<br><br><br>I think that's way too early. She got upset like that because 8man was trying to make her upset with things like "there's no way you'd win the election agaisnt them anyway" and "your bullies will laugh at you".<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127245973 <br>I actually like this. Her rejections do change a lot over time. Now, which one made it almost obvious? (because the obvious one would be the one during vol.10,5).</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it wasn't a good idea to stay awake waiting for subs</br>  <br>batman, huh? sorry im not some murritard who's into capeshit. but i guess the commie fanbase it</br>  <br>where was Iroha in the last ep?</br>  <br>Anon, that's some old meme right there.</br>  <br>Here.</br>  <br> Now, which one made it almost obvious? <br>Perhaps this moment?<br> “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me while I’m heartbroken? I’m sorry, it’s still not possible just yet.” </br></br></br>  <br>kek</br>  Reminder<br><br> “Huh? W-What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, it won’t work out. There’s someone I like.” <br> “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, you’re aiming too high. It’s creepy too and not possible.” <br> “Ha! Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, for an instant that made my heart skip a bit, but now that I think about it rationally, it really wouldn’t work out.” <br> “…Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, I do like them older, but it really wouldn’t work out.” <br> “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me while I’m heartbroken? I’m sorry, it’s still not possible just yet.” <br> “Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a boyfriend just because we went out to have fun for a bit, I’m sorry, please do that only after we do this a few more times.” <br><br> “In any case, today turned out to be a good learning experience. Thank you very much.” <br> Isshiki lightly bowed, honestly expressing her appreciation. Taken aback by her earnest and mannerly behavior, I replied back awkwardly in a fluster. Isshiki lifted her face and laughed in amusement. <br> “…Senpai, make sure to keep today in mind, okay?” <br><br> I was interrupted by Isshiki’s sliding movement towards my side. <br> “That’s why, for now…” <br> Isshiki stopped her words there and moved her lips to my ears as if to say something secretly with deceiving eyes at the end. <br> She added some spice smeared with sugar. <br> “You’re the only one that I’ll act this way with, senpai.” <br><br><br>These were flirtings.  Irohasu so sly </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  who is better, yukinons mom or yuis mom?   昔の俺なら一瞬で即落ちだったよ、今の？ <br> 8man admitted that if it's his old self then he will fall in love with Iroha's act right there. <br><br>What does it mean? His new self already in love with someone else so he doesn't fall for her "trap"?</br></br></br>  why didnt hikki sleeper over with them? i thought they were friends by now?  <br> dat pic <br><br>How does she know all of Komachi's quirks</br></br></br>  <br>all yukinoshitas are shit</br>  <br>Thanks for your hard work, album anon. Your efforts will not be in vain</br>  Was that the last episode? Who won?  <br>Doesn't fall for her "trap". That's just he trying to stay denial because of his trauma</br>  <br>Gagaga Bunko's sales department.</br>  <br>I can't into moon so I don't even know if that's accurate.<br>But if that's the case, it's just him admitting that her actions are appealing to him, but right now he must raise his delusions to not get hurt.<br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't "今の?" at the end mean that he's wondering if he'd fall for her right now?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd switch Zaimokuza x Iroha with Tobe x Iroha. Tobe and Ebina is where it's at.</br>  <br>sauce</br>  <br>kek</br>  holy shit this was so good. why don't more people talk about it on here?  <br> why don't more people talk about it on here? <br>Because it's been over 10 years since it ended.</br></br>  <br>If it makes you feel better we have Kekkai Sensen threads and the original creator of course is Nightow who created Gungrave.</br>  <br>Eva's been over for 20 years. And yet we still have near daily threads about it.</br>  <br>but kekshit is worse</br>  Reminder to skip the first episode.  <br>Kekkai is good but not as good as Gungrave. Just my shitty opinion.</br>  <br>I agree too.<br><br>Kekkai &lt; Gungrave &lt; Trigun<br><br>But all three are still great. It's kinda sad that it took until now for Nightow to finally achieve a high level of success with his work. Kekkai is his first 10k+ anime which is saying a lot since Trigun and Gungrave sold less than 10k. Then again I wonder if it was because of Madhouse that happened. They just never seem to have luck selling anime, not that they need it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why what's wrong with it?</br>  <br>Because the first episode is supposed to "paint an inaccurate picture" of what the anime is all about and acts as a flash-forward which spoils future events in the anime.<br><br>I on the other hand like to see it as a reflective viewpoint, you see the future path the anime will take and how certain characters got to that point and the development they went through.</br></br></br>  <br>I did this because people said it didnt represent gungrave well.<br><br>Well it does represent gungrave once you get through the first 10 episodes.<br><br>And it wasnt good at all, the human half is ruined by the the superpower second half and the second half is ruined by plot from the first half. They should have just split it up in 2 anime.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Just my shitty opinion. <br>Don't try to be cute.</br></br>  <br>Classics aren't really talked about, because, well they are classics</br>  <br>Evangelion has been remade and twisted so many times it's not a classic or masterpiece it's more a constant work in progress by the old cunt</br>  <br> remade and twisted <br>what did they do, manga and the movies are all I knw of</br></br>  <br>Oh and occasionally you'll see a thread that states something along the line, reminder you don't need o watch the 1st episdoe and the pic is usually the image of them in the elevator scene</br>  Do servants poop?  No. Excretion implies they need regular energy sources to maintain a regular flowing equilibrium of energy. For humans that intake is done through food and servants get it through mana link from their masters. Since they don't need to eat, they don't need to poop either.<br><br>As for Saber when Shirou was her master, while Saber did indeed get hungry, there was absolutely no indication that she NEEDED the food to remain materialised or alive in general.

Looks fun.  so /a/ what do you expect out of the epilogue that is airing later today?  <br>If you don't like Shirou, you don't like Shirou, but he's an exceptionally fleshed out character. He has multiple valid character arcs between the routes. There's a bad end where Kerry's character is based around. Like, seriously, he is developed to the nth degree compared to the people in Zero.<br><br> They were riding on the Fate/Zero success wave.  <br><br>They did it multiple times. Premiere of the second season was screened too.<br><br> Art exhibition is minor when you display all what they did for Zero. Zero was a machine to sell the most unusual merchandise. UBW just doesn't have the same wide appeal anymore. <br><br>They're literally recreating sets of the show that you can be in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Will there be some UBW stuff from Ufotable at Comiket? C88 is only two months away  <br>I like Shirou, but he's not really impressive nor he's exceptional. He's also dull when you have more potentially interested backstories and characters to be explored. I mentioned the Illya episode as a good starter. It's the highlight of UBW and it's so good because it's not about Shirou.<br><br> They did it multiple times. Premiere of the second season was screened too. <br><br>Naturally. They are doing that after Madoka movies-marketing change. It still doesn't mean UBW won't be a second rated sequel to F/Z anime in the majority's mind, despite its origin. F/Z is the breakout work. UBW is the unfortunate older, uglier sibling that gives some money.<br><br> They're literally recreating sets of the show that you can be in. <br><br>That looks like CGI.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I like Shirou, but he's not really impressive nor he's exceptional <br><br>Okay? That's your opinion. People readily talk about him and his character 10 years later. People get into heavy debates about his ideal, his progression, and everything about him. You seem like a bit of an Ilyafag though, because I don't really know many people that harp on about the backstory in that episode. It was a serviceable connection to Zero to fill in for the lack of Fate.<br><br> Naturally. They are doing that after Madoka movies-marketing change.

UBW is the unfortunate older, uglier sibling that gives some money. <br><br>You went off point. You were saying they were just riding off of Zero, but now you're talking about Madoka and how you just think Fate will be viewed as lesser. The facts are dude, that FSN is the origin. Zero might have sold a lot, but the countless spin off and products being pushed out aren't trying to emulate it, they're trying to emulate the original product. <br><br> That looks like CGI. <br><br>It's a mock up. You're gonna be able to sit on the couch where Archer first appeared.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How come Lancer didn't get a back story?<br>Even Assassin got one.</br></blockquote>]
