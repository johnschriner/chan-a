This hunger.  <br>Magic.</br>  <br> no panties, ever <br> not even the shadow panties from the first short <br><br>I'm confused. They made KLK, right? Why would they do this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>/co/ fucktards fuck off please.</br>  <br>if it wasn't summer i might believe you</br>  <br>I feel like losing your hat has to be the mark of a rank amateur, or someone who's kind of dumb, assuming they don't have the power or talent to cast "stick hat to head". You just wear a hat with ties on it, like a sunhat, or some cowboy hats. Maybe you lean on that if the Hat is compulsory Witch fashion and nonoptional until you know real magic and can make it stick when you have to do maneuvers that are ungraceful/not right side up.<br><br>Unwillingly displaying immodesty would be the same way. If you want to flash your panties, sure. If you are too incompetent to have magic that deals with that constantly or actively obscures your skirt dress, again, you clearly suck/have poor judgement in not wearing something sensible if you can't actually do that yet.</br></br></br>  <br> show made by japanese people in japan <br> surprised it's in japanese <br>They probably are speaking english, they're just shown speaking Japanese.<br><br>If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518?</br></br></br></br></br>  I approve of what my $300 helped bring together.  <br>Draw your own.</br>  <br>I know right.<br>PROTECT ME MARIA</br></br>  <br>She's Japanese.<br><br>Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this your first anime or something?</br>  So how are the subs for this?<br>Decent?</br>  <br><br><br>What are you talking about no retards here, that post doesn't even exist.</br></br></br>  <br>You wait for the Kickstarter for LWA3 which will be backed in a paltry 3 hours, along with all stretch goals and then some.</br>    <br>That's exactly what it feel like.</br>  <br>Spooky</br>  So the animation quality definitely isn't as high as the original, but what are your thoughts on it as a whole?<br><br>Even if it isn't up to the same standard I still think it's pretty solid</br></br>  <br>Is that what that was? I've never been to England, but I'm pretty sure britbongs don't screech like that.</br>  <br>who is this panda demon</br>  <br>There's a scene with Akko's panstu, they're dark blue.</br>  <br> If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518? <br><br><br> It is I, the animation guru who knows everything about animation </br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's any consolation, I'll make an edit of any future English dub so that Akko and only Akko still speaks moon.</br>  <br> Hand drawn Blingee <br><br>I like it.</br></br></br>  <br>600k is a pretty small amount<br><br>Consider that in the past, even for large animation studios like Disney they spent an average of 150k-300k per short for 8 minutes. That's without adjusting for inflation, either.</br></br></br>  <br> Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other Japanese girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas in Japan. </br>  <br>Animation quality not being as high was foreseeable, what with it being longer and all, and you could clearly see the segments the budget went to. A fluid and pretty animation even throughout the minor segments would have been too much for me too handle.<br><br>I liked it about as much as the first one, which is to say a lot.</br></br></br>   the boy tightly grabbing diana's ass the whole time <br><br>Fucking prick.</br></br>  <br>It is as cute and amusing as the original but yeah, animation quality is lower. I would attribute that to Trigger not having as much time as they do and should had spent now compared to when they were just starting up 2-3 years ago. Back then, weren't they only working on Inferno Cop and just planning out KLK?</br>  Did they release a copy without the English subtitles?  <br>Just like Dawn's are black, right?<br><br>But seriously, that tiny frame is like the only shadow panties in the whole thing? It's like a complete 180 from the first ep.</br></br></br>  So, when are BDs supposed to come out?  <br>I'll like it more if it had hand-drawn Snoop.</br>  Seriously. What the fuck is wrong with some of you. Trigger specifically asked you not to distribute this. Give them respect and don't be a douchenozzle who torrents this immediately. You're a selfish prick and I hope you all fall into a blender and get chopped up into a million pieces.  <br>Aug?</br>  <br>Up until the scene where the parade begins, it wasn't all that stunning. It was still enjoyable and fun but didn't really capture the feeling of LWA1.<br><br>As soon as the parade began, it was magical. I was somewhat afraid of what Trigger might end up producing but it met my expectations and then some. The new characters were very fun too. Maybe my expectations weren't as high as others after watching some of their more recent series.<br><br>Anyways, Amanda best girl from the new lot.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Someone get this hot-head out of here!<br><br> I agree with you </br></br></br>  <br>I realize that it's not going to look like a Disney movie without a huge budget. Google led me a cost of about 150k per episode of anime on average, this was from 2011, so with a bit under twice the budget they'd need for something twice a long as a regular episode I figured they could have made it look better.</br>  <br> Not downloading now and buying the BD and all surrounding merch later. </br>  <br>Nigga I backed this and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa.</br>  <br>why you yelling at me for , I gave them money and watched it at vimeo</br>  <br>cry more</br>      <br>That $600k+ also went into merchandise and other stuff.</br>  <br> and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa. <br>why arn't you getting a BD anyway?</br></br>  I want to beat the living shit out of those normie brats who were pelting our witches with disgusting commoner fruit.

Everyone else just gets a special thanks on their website, I think.</br>  <br/>  <br>yeah someone here said 300+</br>  <br>Yeah, it was like $300 or more.</br>  <br>Poorfags BTFO.</br>  <br>She was alright. She did a lot more by not talking and being aloof, in my opinion, it shows her character, but I agree with  in that Food girl needed something other than food.</br>  <br>Can this be a gif? Or even a Youtube?</br>  <br>Yeah that's true. Neither of them had a whole dance routine of time devoted to expound on their background.</br>  <br> implying a 30-something NEET lowlife living with his parents would donate enough to have their name put on the end credits </br>   diana cheering akko on <br>cute</br>  Do we know how much money was on TRIGGER's end?  So what do we need to do to get a full series? I was wary at first of getting LWB without the animation quality, fearing the animation is what gave it its charm, but now I have confidence in Trigger to give LWB proper presentation with a more limited budget, since the characters and universe are well-thought out and charming enough.  <br>I have you know I'm a professional engineering living with my parents.</br>  <br> somefaggotsstupidname (Sup /a/?) </br>  <br>Do we know if they are going to make more money from this movie too?</br>  <br> I'm a professional engineering <br>Sure you are.</br></br>  So Good Smile Company is plastered on the front and end of LWA2. Does this mean that they'll finally get around to making figures?  <br>Please be nice to Collin. He put over $300 into the kickstarter you know.</br>   Sorry, comments have been disabled by the owner of this video.   Did Takafumi Hori save Trigger's animation once again?   AOTY   <br>Anyone?</br>  <br>Probably. But that's kind of risky, the figure market in the west is nowhere near as huge as in Japan. Is LWA even popular in Japan? It looked like Trigger was making it mostly for the west (in the credits you don't see many Japanese names).</br>  <br>There were no panties in the first ep. Just impossible skirts.</br>  I like Amanda enough that I wish she'd been in the first OVA  <br>I dont think many japanese know what kickstarter is though do they?</br>  <br>Skirts like that exist, you know.</br>  <br>Well, Kickstarter is mainly a western thing so that makes sense.</br>   /a/ backs LWA2 <br> Trigger delivers a great movie <br><br> leddit and Tumblr back Under the Dog <br> CIA in shambles, production drama and setbacks <br>Feels great.<br><br><br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>They liked the animation but wasn't all over it like the West.<br> in the credits you don't see many Japanese names <br>I don't think they're familiar with KS.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I really don't understand why there isn't more like this. CGDGT slice-of-life as everyone seems to enjoy, just in a slightly more novel setting with a fantastic or sci-fi element to jazz things up a bit.  <br>That might just be Elevens not being into Kickstarter. Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously).</br>  <br>There was lots of Japanese names, just in romaji</br>  <br>That's just cause not many japs paid 300 dollars to be there.</br>  <br>jokes on them , I can fap to thighs alone.</br>  <br> Under the Dog <br><br>Was that one with Kojima?</br></br></br>  <br>Man, that Akko bitch ended up trashing Lotte's pillow.</br>  Is this the tripfags general?  <br>What a slut</br>  <br> Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. <br>[citation needed]</br></br>  <br>B-but muh slightly different school clubs are so much more fresh!</br>  <br> Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously) <br>I was in  the Yaraon threads  and they were more surprised/amused by that than anything. Only a handful of trolls were saying anything like that, and it was pretty clear they hadn't watched the OVA.<br> so this is a ripoff of Madoka funded by Amerika-jin, right??? </br></br></br>  It's official. LWA 2 &gt; LWA  <br>And hey, at the end of the day, if UTD comes out and is good, we can still enjoy it, if not, we can snark on it. It's win-win.</br>  <br>Literally the next sentence it is pointed out that that statement could be false.</br>  <br> CGDGT  <br>That's one long-ass acronym.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>   Fat-chan literally did nothing but eat, give food, and generally be fat <br>Impressive. She was still adorable though.</br>  I need a webm of Akko's transformation scene  <br> &gt;Fat-chan literally did nothing <br>she acted as the weight for the catapult.</br></br>  <br>I await the butthurt tumblr will have about fat shaming despite the character being fun, funny and cute.</br>  where is the high definition torrent? the vimo stream is choppy and atrocious. (my toaster doesn't do well with streaming)  <br>sankyuu</br>  <br>Looks like it was 20$+ to have your name on the website. I'm in the poorest of the poorfags.</br>  <br>I had<br> and generally be fat <br>for that one. The catapult was hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe not in that scene you posted. And I said shadow panties, not actual panties.</br>  <br>LWA3 when?</br>  <br>I don't think we'll get better than the 720p stream until backers get their actual BDs.</br>  <br>Yeah, she was the weak link of the secondary power trio.<br><br>I'd actually like to see a third OVA of the secondaries, but with Diana instead of her.</br></br></br>  Where the fuck is the 720p on Nyaa?  <br><br><br>WHAT THE FUCK<br><br>IT WAS JUST DOLPHIN PORN YOU FUCK</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yaraon threads <br>whats that?</br></br>  <br>She seemed to make herself larger there too. I wonder if that was just a visual gag or if she's one of those calorie-consuming magic types like Chouji in Naruto or that Zero Squad lady in Bleach.</br>  <br>Japanese Gaia, more or less.</br>  <br> DOLPHIN PORN <br>thats good too</br></br>  <br>720 is high definition you idiot, and that's what i was asking about.</br>  <br>Picked up.</br>  Was there no Kickstarter update?  <br>It's  2 years lurking before posting, faggot </br>  <br>so filled with 13 year old kids?</br>  <br>nvm, found the Trigger email</br>  <br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>I remember that trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend</br></br>  <br>I fucking wish I could make that joke.</br>  <br>Christ, someone's mad they can't get their pirated anime as fast as they want.</br>  <br>They did mention the emails going out around the AX screening in one of the previous KS updates but no, no update when the emails did go out.</br>  <br>Scene-wise, I think the first one was more memorable and better animated but overall, I think the second had the better story and characters.</br>  <br>If I never got into Ragnarok I would never know this feeling.</br>  <br>Trigger got probably more fan outside of japan than inside.</br>  <br>Some of the posters are clearly what we would call underage, yes. You'd fit right in.</br>  <br><br> trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend <br>s-seriously?</br></br></br>  <br><br>i am a backer, my computer is just a toaster and can't stream.</br></br>  <br> magnet:?xt=urn:btih:00820fc737e6cdd<wbr>fa2ea27fe37cd48928df06f30&amp;dn=388264<wbr>041.mp4&amp;tr=http%3a%2f%2fopen.nyaato<wbr>rrents.info%3a6544%2fannounce</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br>Does this work for you?</br></br></br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2013-08-12/little-witch-academia-<wbr>tokyo-event-cancelled-due-to-low-ti<wbr>cket-sales</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Not the only one, my friend.</br>  <br> first KS <br> was a student working at a deli <br> back $100 <br><br>If they open a KS for LWA3, I'm tossing a lot more in it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Because they didn't advertise it well enough. Most nips didn't even hear about the event until it was over.</br></br></br>  <br>it appears to be on kissanime</br>  <br>First definitely was jaw dropping around everything concerning magical fiesta. But I got chills when the parade started, and I actually think this has the better animation. You can see it clearly in Amanda.</br>  <br>If you were a backer you would know that you can DDL it from Vimeo.</br>  <br><br>if my computer is a toaster, and i say it's a toaster, what part of your small undeveloped nigger brain can't put 1 and 1 together to figure out i can't even magnet? <br><br>if there's an actual torrent on nyaa, say so, because i can't find it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> In order to kick off the event, Studio Trigger needed to sell at least 200 of the 400 possible tickets, but sales ended on August 12 with only 94 tickets sold.  <br><br> only 94 tickets sold <br><br>Damn.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't know that<br>how do you do that?</br></br>  <br>fuck off faggit</br>  what is the runtime for this ova? 35 minutes?  <br>if i never stream or used vimo, how would i by default know i could download the file? oh right, i wouldn't.</br>  <br> This video cannot be downloaded any more right now. Please try again later </br>  <br>Rude.</br>  <br>I never did magnets before but it worked fine for me.</br>  <br>The fuck are you on about? I don't know who you are.</br>  Jasmineka will turn out to be something greater in LWA3. I hope.  <br>Plus it had been out for six months. Everyone had already seen it, so the only draw was the creator talkback, which for a single OVA by a new studio isn't going to pull much attendance as a stand-alone event</br>  <br>There isn't anymore. It got deleted. You've got the magnet as your sole option.</br>  <br>There's a DDL link right under the video. They seem to be capping concurrent downloads, but it's the middle of the night EST so you probably should be able to get it.<br><br><br>Uh, because Trigger told us that there would be a download for backers two fucking years ago?<br><br><br>Yeah, that's the antiflood. I got that about eight times before it let me download it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>53 min</br>  <br> You can see it clearly in Amanda. <br>The only place you can see it clearly, because good luck taking your eyes off her.</br></br>  <br> My computer is a toaster so I can't magnet <br>Yes you can. You just don't know what the fuck is a magnet or how they work.</br></br>  <br>  The torrent you are looking for does not appear to be in the database. </br>  <br>have you tried turning it off and on again?</br>  <br>Toasters can use magnets.</br>  <br>Akkovision and Am and a vision were about 50/50 and all qt.</br>    <br>I'm pretty sure I came at this part.<br><br>I want to do lewd things to Mandy</br></br></br>  <br>I actually watched the entire show a few weeks ago, it was pretty damn funny. Shame it had so few seasons and the seasons were so short.</br>  <br>the magnet didn't work for me. what was that about toasters being able to use magnets again? idiot. <br><br>anyways, i found the download link on the vimo. thanks for nothing to the rest of you inept useless virgin fags.</br></br></br>  <br>wayfu4layfu</br>  <br>Are you insulting yourself?</br>  Reminder that Sucy is the best girl  <br>Ha, get fucked.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me. <br>Then you were holding it wrong.</br></br>  <br>That's what I thought as well. Figured she'd be a lot more rebellious. Smoking cigs, talking like a delinquent, etc.</br>  <br>You can't even call it a toaster then.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me <br>Clearly you're doing something wrong</br></br>  <br> mfw the person who sat in front of me at the premiere posted a picture of Yoshinari &amp; Otsuka to Instagram with the caption "based trigger" </br>  <br>Have you tried to swipe it across your HDD?<br>Fucking magnet, how do they work?</br></br>  so the download is around 590 mb right?  Does no one else like this qt?  <br>596 to be exact</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Dis nigga ain't got no magic in his heart.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>596.9mb</br>  <br>I like her, she's like a loli witch freeman</br>  <br>I thought she was a fun character but you're mostly going to get posts to the effect of <br> Constanze <br> I seriously hope you witches don't do this </br></br></br>  <br>slice of life is easy because it's cheap, i'd imagine.<br><br>then again i have no idea how budget is distributed in shows. Do they just pay the quality of animators? is it based on the number of frames to be made?</br></br></br>  <br>I wish she got some lines. But she's in the top 3 for me.</br>  <br>Just allow it in program you're using or copypaste it directly you sad faglord. Don't blame your incompetence on objects.</br>  <br> Akko, Sucy, Lotte, Diana, Ursula-sensei, Amanda, Constantze <br>These are the witches that cause me pathological grinning</br></br>  <br><br>god damn right i don't. but i had 300 bucks in my wallet when the kickstarter rolled around. and i'll have another 300 for the third ep.<br><br>and i'm not a nigger. i'm a proud aryan american national socialist.</br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCKING MAGNETS<br><br>HOW DO THEY WORK?</br></br></br>  <br>For some strange reason throughout I thought Constanze was a boy</br>  Haven't watched it yet. <br>Is Sucy still best girl?</br>  Fucking magnets, how do they work?  <br>Use those 300 dollars to buy a better toaster. Maybe one with four bread slots.</br>  <br>Yes. Amanda is best new girl though.</br>  <br><br>you're not funny. don't you have MLP to watch and a fedora to tip? you should go do that. you can fucking spot the redditors a mile away, i swear</br></br>  <br><br>its my understanding they work when the field lines created by the movement of electrons tend to point in a general direction instead of randomly cancelling each other out.</br></br>  I want some magic in my life  <br> that lotte botting </br>  <br>Please, keep posting.

I would.</br></br></br>  <br>I want one</br>  <br>I could throw 1000$ at it now.</br>  <br>That's a misconception.

(cough cough law school)</br>  <br>Akko is literally's Sucy's bitch. You can tell right away she's dominant as fuck.</br>  <br>I paid for this. Why would I watch it on vimeo if I can torrent it?</br>  <br>why is she in a magic school if she wants to build robots?</br>  <br>How about a 16-slice toaster?</br>   German is the ugliest <br>Just like in real life!</br>  <br>This nigga gets it.</br>  <br><br><br>shippers need to die<br><br>waifuism is the only way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why not? I'm enjoying them.</br>  <br>I would. Didn't back the previous one because I had doubts. No longer.</br>  <br>But can it open magnet links?</br>    <br>why would you need to if you have that much toast?</br>  If anyone is still downloading how fast is it going for you? I'm getting only getting 6KB/s.  <br>I was worried they wouldn't be able to capture the feeling of the original but they did a fantastic job. Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious.</br>  <br>Comparing the two, I think the first one had better lighting and smoothness of the overall animation, but that doesn't mean that this one was bad at all. It would be an added bonus though if they actually continue to improve on it until we get the BDs.</br>   There is no need to be upset   <br> Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious. <br>yeah klk was not bad but it didn't particularly wow me either.</br></br>  Cool, sticky, now we can just keep it in one thread.

I can't remember off the top of my head where the cutoff was.</br>  Trigger saved anime again.  <br>seriously. I'll admit i'm a very cynical person, even more so than is warrented much of the time. But at the end of the video I actually caught myself smiling. This series is just too fun and adventurous for me to dislike.</br>   Fat-chan's early design was this.   If Amanda was going to get exactly one doujin, which three fetishes should it have?  <br>Futa and two others</br>  <br>I was downloading this, does it mean my download is corrupted?</br>  <br>I'm happier with what we got.</br>  oh shit.<br>LWA is still on my backlog</br>  <br>Squinty eyed girl is cute.</br>  <br>Christ.</br>  <br>I was still in school, technically the 100$ I gave from money meant for books and other educational expenses.</br>  <br>Hurry up fam</br>  <br>If you weren't rolling around on the floor, writhing in joy anytime someone other than Jasmina was onscreen, you're bad at LWA.</br>  <br>Was doing other stuff plus I don't check /a/ too often anymore. Whenever I do come my pic folder manages to double in size.</br>  <br>Well the magic is needed to power those robots and technology she makes.</br>  Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one?  <br>For Fat-chan, they could've put in anybody and it would've worked. She was pretty useless...</br>  <br>Futa  and scat and snuff </br>  <br>Spats<br>Cowgirl Position<br>Femdom</br></br></br>  <br>I think they need to tone her down a bit</br>  <br>Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes.</br>  <br>I don't know, but for sure it should be illustrated by hirame.</br>  <br>Non-H, adventures, and with Diana</br>  <br>$300 to be in movie credits<br>$20 to be on website<br><br>less than that, and you just get an e-mail.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah! The crossover was great. Did they release it yet?</br>  <br>spats and femdom</br>  <br>YES<br>FUCKING YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. What a delightful series.  <br>femdom<br>zettai ryouiki<br>defloration</br></br></br>  <br>Fat-chan delivers candy to the people.</br>  <br> Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one? <br><br>I wanted to punch her, she was too fucking much. Then she has a sob which auto redeems her character some how and the plot falls on her lap. She's probably the worst character in the whole series, and it doesn't help that all the new girls were so delicious, smarter and level headed. <br><br>Akko behaves like a 10 year old girl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They needed her to be to set up for the heartwarming friendship to come out. When Lotte showed up and gave Akko the hat, I teared up a little.</br>  <br>That's the full one.</br>  <br>Early on yeah, had to be so that she could fall out with Lotte and Sucy in order to make up and save the day with the power of friendship.</br>  <br>Right~~ She was fine in the first one, but sorta kinda very annoying in this one. At least she became okay in the second half of the ep.</br>  <br> I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. </br>  <br>straight<br>consensual sex<br>missionary position</br></br></br>  <br>Your name is only in the credits if you backed $300.</br>  <br>And then there's THIS faggot...</br>  Damn hardsubs  I'm finally watching the movie. Amanda is fantastic as people said, so is Diana, Sucy being best as always. But I have to say Akko was a bit more annoying in this one, I can see why Yoshinari doesn't like her very much. Not that I hate her.  <br>I think you mean the fat girl eating donuts is the best girl</br>  <br><br>yes</br></br>  <br>Catch up, nigga</br>  This is like a cross between gainax/trigger and Disney. Absolutely stunning. I seriously hope they do more original stuff like this even if they need to kickstart more stuff just so they can have the freedom to do what they want without producers stopping them.  You guys do know that at this point it isn't really anime? It's literally for the western audience.<br>Man, Trigger really sold out.</br>  <br>Sounds like you could have used those.</br>  <br>But the cannonball...</br>  What Akko needs is someone to calm her down. Like a girlfriend.  Like Diana   <br>Trigger confirmed for bros</br>  <br>You again? Go away.</br>  <br>Now I remember why I put the name as Anonymous instead of something fun. I would've loved to see my name in the movie, but I rather not have my name posted on a website rarely anyone will visit besides spambots. Can't wait to get the Bluray though.</br>  WHERE WERE YOU<br><br>WHEN TRIGGER SAVED ANIME?</br></br>  <br>give me a break I doing shots.</br>  This thread is moving too sanic for me now.  What's the point of the HorribleSubs release?  Is [HorribleSubs] good?  <br> Disney <br>Funny you mention that, because there was rumors Pixar was working with Trigger.</br></br>  <br> Not Sucy <br>She'll keep her calm.  Forcibly </br></br>  <br> Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes. <br>How would tomatoes work as a fetish? Like a bunch of shotas shoving tomatoes into her, filling her up with them?</br></br>  Lets be honest, nobody cares about this shit anymore. Wasted money.  <br>Gross.</br>  <br><br>How to spot the retarded Redditfag.</br></br>  <br>Saw my name in the credits. Kinda wish I had put a silly one.</br>    <br>Her girlfriend is sushi.</br>  I don't get it.<br>Why does trigger produce trash like kill lel kill, inoushit and ninja slayer when they have the original right LWA?</br>  <br> What's the point of the HorribleSubs release? <br>Well for one the previous upload got deleted, again</br></br>   sticky <br>Okay, now this thread is total cancer.</br>  <br>nothing weird like that<br>just reverse cowgirl while juggling tomatoes<br>thats good clean fun.</br></br></br>  <br>We know it's you Diana.</br>  <br>Ah yes, anon's bait.</br>  Amanda has some nice thighs.  <br>Because Yoshinari has yet to work on full-length TV shows.</br>  <br><br>e-peen.<br><br> we were the first to release LWA2, guys! </br></br></br></br>  It was worth it, Trigger is truly saving anime.  <br>I'm sure Sucy has ways of keeping people calm. I'm sure they involve mushrooms.</br>    I hereby claim that my $400 paid for Trigger to come up with Amanda. I called it, now you never can, neener neener neener.   that scene where Lotte sings <br> I imagine it's Rukia singing </br>  <br> CGDCT <br>Fuck off you lazzy cunt.</br></br>  <br><br>Maybe the shitposting won't happen as fast.</br></br>  <br>Use the juice as lube.</br>  <br>who?</br>  Fuck I have work due and still have the first one on my backlog, should I just cram it all tonight or take my time and enjoy it tomorrow?  <br>Tomato juice would make terrible lube. Far to acidic.</br>  <br>Fuck work, nigga.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127565290   <br>put aren't vagoos already acidic anyway?</br>  <br>Get to work man, the OVA will keep.</br>  <br><br>Of course. Didn't you know anime will become illegal tomorrow? Better get your anime in before the feds come for you, pedo.</br></br>  <br> How would tomatoes work as a fetish. <br><br>They use Roger or Kyouko instead of fat, balding, old men.</br></br></br>  <br>put in some baking soda?</br>  <br>Okay, that was amusing and that  is nice (nice triples) but as I said, she could've been replaced by anybody. I like her but she is the most replaceable of any of the new girls.</br>  <br>we will still be here tomorrow anon, take care of your obligations.</br>  <br>Standard procedure is to pay animators one ramen noodle per frame drawn. <br>That's why TV anime would often fall into QUALITY, since they were under extremely tight deadlines to shit out as many frames as possible.<br>KyoAni has been famously paying its artists by the hour, allowing for a slightly less stressed work output. Still often looks like shit since most of the animators are female, but you take what you can get.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. Most bodily fluids are close to pH neutral, unless you've got something wrong with you.</br>    <br>Screwing on a pile of tomatoes, throwing tomatoes at each other while screwing, licking tomato paste off each other,  inserting a whole tomato in her anus , etc</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  I never understood the extreme fascination /a/ had for LWA, I just don't get it.  Did everybody use their real fucking names? Where's the Nig Ger Dix?  When will Diana admit her yuri?  <br> Not really. <br>yes really<br>vaginal pH is typically 3.5 to 4.5.</br></br></br>  That furby  <br>of course you don't anon, you're just a fagoot.</br>  <br>Suck a dick, pinko scum.</br>    <br> Mohammed Malik <br>kek</br></br>  were all of you watching this with a hand on your dick? it wasn't that good, it was just okay  <br> tfw misread Guckin as "Cuckin" <br>I spend too much time here.</br></br>  Watching this made me really happy. It sounds dumb, but it made me feel joy in a way so few anime have. I'm so glad I backed and believed in them.  <br>Those names are the $300+ tier, probably not too many jokers in that bunch.</br>  When did this happen? I din't even know there was going to be a LWA2 in the first place.  I didn't know Akko was gay for Sucy.  <br><br>It's literally NOTHING special.</br></br>  <br>Lurk moar, faggot.</br>  <br> feel joy in a way so few anime have. <br><br>Maybe you just have shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br> Gameboy <br> Tamagotchi <br> Furby <br> SNES </br></br></br></br>  Full show when?  <br>uh, anon</br>  <br>And the tamagotchi too.</br>  Them thighs  I want to fuck Akko.  <br>They could've at least alphabetized it but yeah... what  said.</br>  <br>That rarely works for screencaps so fuck off.</br>  <br>goodTaste/10</br>  Here's some more.

Like ideally i want to believe the people torrenting it did drop the money already and are not hurting the potential sales. It was well worth the money.  <br> It's only anime when it's headed by the elevens. <br>You obviously didn't read what I was implying.</br></br>  <br> "hey-soos" <br> not "Hey, Zeus" <br>You had one fucking job, nigger.</br></br></br>  <br> This episode is brought to you by: The color blue </br>  <br>Attentionwhoring, even in death.</br>  <br>What else in there?<br>Game Boy, Tamagatchi, SuperFami, don't recognize the wand, Walkman...</br></br>  Technomage is best witch, pass it on.  <br>Blue from /a/, though I'm not sure he posts with the name anymore.</br>  <br>No one cares what you think</br>  <br>Why is this the only time /a/ is against torrenting. Fuck off with the hypocrisy. Everyone should download the HorribleSubs release and only buy the BD if they liked it.</br>  Post your favorite background witches  <br>You were implying nonsense. Go whine in a Ninja Slayer thread, or make an Aku no Hana thread and shitpost about how Japan has fallen to Western standards.</br>  <br> Why is this the only time /a/ <br> implying /a/ is in this thread <br>This is normalfag central my friend.</br></br></br>  <br><br>but it's ok to torrent everything else? They had the production paid for completely, they aren't losing anything. Any sale is a bonus.</br></br>  I ship  Akko X Lotte   <br>I torrented it without paying.<br>What are you going to do bitch.</br></br>  <br>I remember seeing him a few months ago but nothing since. Did he died?</br>  Thank you trigger for show tomatos in face and that ducking stool. <br><br>Its as close as we're going to get to WAM stuff with dunk tanks fully animated in /a/.</br></br>  OST when?  <br>I ship  LWA2 BDs in August, thanks for the support </br>  <br>Lotte</br>  Quick stitch of all backers.  <br>And that's why they fucked up by sticking it in /a/. This should go in /co/ where it belongs. Also yuri pandering in an already backed OVA, Kek Trigger you're not selling high so why are you trying to get the panderbux?</br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br>If I'm not mistaken, he's still around.  meguca  maybe.</br>  Watched at the premiere today, sitting outside an event hall torrenting this on my phone because I want to watch it again; it was that good.   Witch Knight <br><br>Whatever that is, I want to watch it.</br></br>  <br>You're a sick man  and my nigga .</br>  There goes my ONE THOUSAND DORRARS.<br><br>No regrets, of course.</br></br>  Now we just need Little Gentlemen Academia  I want to marry Lotte.  <br>Shit meant to quote </br>  <br> GARfunkel <br> Edward <br>...heh.</br></br></br>  <br>All $300+ backers.<br>We paid good money to get our names there.</br></br>  <br> Diana's groupies will never belittle your penis </br>  <br>there will be people who choose to torrent or stream or find an uploaded version online that never intended to buy the physical copy. There will be plenty of people, me included, who watch the ova online and then buy the bluray when it becomes available</br>  <br>Uh huh...</br>  someone has a webm with fatty-chan and the catapult? That scene was glorious.  COLLIN, WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THIS THREAD. SPEAK UP.  was the first ova this devoid of music? Half the time it just felt really "empty" listening to Akko's voice over and over again without the whimsical music in the background.  So is horriblesubs better than the first one that got deleted. Downloaded both and which one should I watch?  <br>OVA three plot confirmed?</br>  <br>You already did, but here's another.</br>    <br>It's the same version. They just reuped it.</br>  <br>what about the subs are they identical?</br>  <br>Un-glassed eyes...!</br>  <br>Ask and you shall receive.</br>  <br> Cute no-glasses face </br>  <br>Shiny Chariot versus Witch Knight, with antics from the girls meanwhile? Or maybe Akko (as Shiny Chariot) versus Diana (as Witch Knight)?<br><br>There really needs to be one last finale. A trilogy would be perfect.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>And now male version w/ headphones</br></br></br>  <br>why shouldn't they be. This isn't fansubbed, it's the official subs distributed to the KS donators.</br>  <br>awesome, I love it.</br>  <br><br>Maybe she's Lotte's Chariot.</br></br>  <br> unironically implying yuri sells </br>  <br>i thought they are hard subbed</br>  <br> one last finale <br> not a 2 cour series </br></br>  <br><br>Not to mention the official subs are hardcoded, so there's no point in trying to lay out a new subtitle track.</br></br>   paying for anime <br>Am I on reddit?</br>   No "A believing heart is your magic" <br>You had one job, Trigger</br>  <br>Yuri hints sell. Madoka sold like crazy and so did K-On. Trigger wanted in on some of those panderingbux.</br>  <br>The quality wouldn't be the same, we'd get some ninja slayer animation</br>  <br>A trilogy of OVAs and then a series is fine too.<br><br>Learning more about the school and the other characters while they go on misadventures would be able to span quite a few episodes.</br></br></br>  <br>DASA!</br>  IS there an OST download?  <br>In this case not paying for it actually means it's not getting made.<br>If they didn't hit the KS goal it wouldn't of been created in the first place.</br></br>  <br> panderingbux <br>Added to filter.</br></br>  <br>It's weird, I had the same thought, though no outline to make that comparison.</br>  <br>Thank you! I really enjoyed your movie.</br>  Kinky.  <br> Wanting a TV series from Triiger. <br>If the OVA which took years to do looks OK at best in the first half then imagine how bad the tv anime would look. Maybe even lower than Ninja Slayer and they won't be even doing it ironically.</br></br>  <br>They sold for reasons not related to yuri.</br>  <br> kill la kill  looked good</br>  <br>Don't engage him</br>  <br>Explain LL then. Yuri hints sell in Japan. That's what Trigger wanted to which is a shame because the first OVA was better without all this nonsense.</br>  <br>That's why I originally said a trilogy of OVAs. They can amass the funds via Kickstarter again, take their time with it and have it look equally as good as LWA2 or potentially better.<br><br><br>You're going to get a lot of flak for that, especially with certain episodes and CG.</br></br></br></br>  I just got back from work.<br><br>Any update on when HD is being uploaded to nyaa?</br></br>    <br>It's a pet project, so I could see a kickstarter-backed trilogy OVA. <br>Plot-wise, Witch Knight would be someone other than Diana, given that small spiel about her family heritage. Is WK even current, or bygone like Chariot?</br></br>  <br>Nice fallacy.</br>  <br>no<br><br>it's a webm<br><br>webm is best</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy fucking legs</br>  <br>At the anime expo premiere the speaker had a shirt that said Pixar animation on the left side if his chest</br>  <br>Say you're right and it does sell. All Trigger did was make a decision to give some fanservice to the majority who would like it, seeing as how it's popular and sales-driving. In other words they don't care about you, the minority, so cry more.</br>  <br>Try reading some manga, there's a shit ton of comfy stuff in fantastical settings<br> Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou <br> Aria <br> Dead Dead Demons Dedededestruction <br> Kyoukai Senjou no Rinbo </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>As main director you mean? <br><br>Because he's worked as lead animator and episode director on more than one TV show</br></br></br>  <br>And Sucy collects it all and sells it off on some sketch site.</br>  i like how the giant got cute at the end.<br><br>Everything was comfy.</br></br>  <br>Japs wear shirts with random English on them all the time.</br>  <br>Love YKK. So pleasant.</br>  <br>Kek. You know this OVA is stained by the yuribait because Trigger wants some mire money when it could've been better without it but you will always defend it won't you Triggerdrone?</br>  <br> You had one job, Trigger </br>  <br>If I remember correctly, they didn't change that much (or at all) in the BDs, right? There was a lot of questionable animation for KlK. Never watched Inou Battle but I imagine that was decently animated.</br>  <br> yuribait <br> Triggerdrone <br>Gave yourself away pretty quickly, didn't you?</br></br></br>  <br> Inferno Cop <br>Yes<br> gg fansubs <br>No</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br>Here's your reply</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br> shitposting in a sticky </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br>KLK was manly?</br>  <br>And I don't care about them either. I didn't back their shit. I torrented it and uploaded it on other torrent trackers so that people find it easier to dl.<br>It's just laughable how people proclaim that Trigger cares about what they do and animate when in reality are no different than any other studio that does design by committee.</br></br>  <br>I know this is bait but<br> implying Trigger aren't the biggest yurifags </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>years ago Gainax actually paid a visit to Pixar.

Pure animation porn.</br></br>  <br>People like yuri pandering so they gave it to them. What exactly is the problem again? Sounds to me like you're just  triggered. </br>  <br>Why is Saber such a slut?</br>  <br>Honestly, I'm glad they subverted expectations with all three of those girls. They seemed like a group that would be at ends with the original three until you actually saw them interact. Even the Constanze, without any verbal interactions, came off different than expected. I thought she would be somewhat similar to Sucy's attitude.</br>  Who is best Little Witch?  <br>The robot.</br>   no panties <br>Oh my.</br>  <br>Because she know how to please men.</br>  <br>Did they fuck?</br>  Sushi pls  <br>she is a cutie you monster</br>  Blewit indeed.  <br>Those are brooms.</br>  Did I miss something?

Free wasn't homobait too right?</br>  <br>Ha!</br>  <br> wouldn't of </br>  Shadow or see-through spats?  <br>Kill la Kill was good and Ninja Slayer is fun. Inou was a meh adaption of a meh source. Most of Triggers work is at least above average at the very least which is more than you can say for most studios.</br>  It feels almost like a TV show rather than another movie. In a good way though. It feels comfy rather than grandoise.  <br>anon hes probably not good enough for nvidia</br>    <br>She does know there's a patent on this kind of thing, right?<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8tab<wbr>9C3GW3U</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> witches <br> not sluts <br>None of them wear panties.</br></br></br>  <br>This.

I haven't been keeping up with it but I last recall there being disputes amongst the creative teams. I'm keeping hype to a minimum, even after Trigger fulfilled expectations of a Kickstarter anime.<br><br>There was KickHeart as well... anything else from KS?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> At first worried that the 3 new characters would steal precious time from the 3 mains <br> After watching it now I'm sad that there wasn't more.  <br><br>that was a fun time. Bravo trigger.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>A proper reaction to all these delicious underage thighs.</br></br>    <br>Tim Schafer. RIP Spacebase.</br>  <br>Shota-Tattun.</br>   LWA The Enchanted Parade - 01 <br><br> 01  <br><br>So... there will be a second "episode" coming, right?<br><br>Right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like she's straight out of adventure time or Steven Universe. Design wise i mean.</br>  <br>Trigger's already said they aren't planning any more LWA.</br>  That part in Trigger's email to the backers about "still finishing up the anime as I type this", I think Yoshinari is cracking the whip over the animators' heads to fix some scenes. The part where the Giant falls back to sleep and the civilians climb all over it was pretty QUALITY. Hopefully they fix that for the BDs, though. I wonder if we'll get another Making Of documentary?  <br> anything else from KS? <br>There was that under the dog thing from some nobody, in the end he took the money and ran, which is what anybody stupid enough to back that thing deserved.</br></br>  That was pretty nice.  <br>What, citation or bullshit.</br>    <br>Not anytime soon, anyway. They'll probably wait until the numbers come in for BD sales. Wish they'd make another movie, I don't care if it takes another two-three years.</br>  Looks like they had international help for sound (Russia and Paris).

It was bothering me what it looked like. Kept coming back to Scott Pilgrim, but that wasn't right.</br>  <br>Just play Deathsmiles</br>  <br><br> Otsuka has stated that if the sequel performs well, they may potentially look into producing a television series or full-length film. </br></br>  <br> 1.5 million for a full TV series <br>That's nowhere near enough</br></br>  I TOLD YOU DIANA<br><br>I TOLD YOU THOSE KIDS ARE IRREDEEMABLY EVIL AND PERSECUTORS OF WITCHES<br><br>THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR RESCUING ONE OF THEM</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm still convinced they blew the majority of their budget on episode one. <br><br>They had to have. When you have scenes like https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Uhm<wbr>BnaEcbfA</wbr>  [ ] ? There's no way.</br></br></br>  <br>In the first one i believe they mention that there's ley lines and that the school is just situated on a nexus of them and the stone just sort of acts to contain a large part of that energy. so presumably their powers work best near ley lines and their intersecting nodes. I'd assume the stone acts like a large battery so that there's a constant large supply of magic for all the students to use in their training. <br><br>I dunno.</br></br></br>  <br>What si with the tiny mayor?</br>  That was great. I'm really looking forward to Trigger's next fully animated TV project.   The sequel was just as good as the first one <br>based trigger</br>  Sticky. <br><br>Why?</br></br>  Sup  <br>There was a sticky for the Kickstarter way back when. A LOT of people here backed it.</br>  <br>Because /a/ largely funded it.</br>  <br>Because the mod didn't want dozens of threads in the catalog again. We also had three stickies for the Kickstarter back-to-back  two were unnecessary  so it's probably the same mod, I guess.</br>  <br><br>I wonder how you retards imagine turning money into animation. A vending machine dispensing key frames? <br>First episode looked good because they actually had time to finish it beforehand, further along their schedule collapsed because Umetsu and everyone else involved in the production are incompetent.</br></br></br>  <br>Because it's one of those magical times where /a/ actually agreed on something</br>  /ss/?  <br><br>They could add something in similar to how other fantasy universes do it (If they ever expanded their universe).<br><br>The more experience you get as a mage, the more mana you can hold. Or they could be given things similar to what the MC has that hold exponentially more mana/magic.<br><br>I think it actually could make for a more interesting story. I've always like the lore where mages can't just shit out spells, but actually have to draw it from a souce.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why? It would only end up as an even more budget KlK. I just threw up a little typing that.</br>  <br>I forgot Inflation. My bad.<br>Let's say 2.2 million to be safe.</br></br>  Posting in a sticky   LWA get sticky <br> LOGH anime and novel being licensed didn't </br>  <br>Checked</br>  <br>It also help make sense of why the rest of the world has progressed mostly along the lines of modern technology and magic is seen as a backwards curiosity.</br>  <br>Because anime was finally saved.</br>  <br>Who the fuck cares about it being licensed?

I love you Akko.<br>I love you so much. <br>You are so beautiful and perfect.<br><br>I LOVE YOU!</br></br></br></br>  Why is this not a 12 episode anime?<br> YOSHINARI COME ON.</br>  <br>I was only replying with the same logic he used.<br><br>If he wants us to tolerate anime with fanservice without telling people to go to /e/ then he has to tolerate anime without fanservice without telling people to go to /co/.</br></br></br>  <br><br> implying that she doesn't use her poison to rape you </br></br>  <br>Sucy does the raping.</br>  <br> while you're facefucking her  <br> lucy shoves a mushroom up your butt causing you to lose strength  <br> she rapes you instead  <br>   you can't ejaculate due to the mushroom and you can only feel pain from the absence of your ejaculation </br></br></br></br>  <br>I love how her face switched from surprise to that smile</br>  <br>Do you honestly think that people don't like LWA2 just because it didn't have fanservice?</br>  <br>You need to pay the Jews shekel is magic.</br>  I wasn't liking the first half very much but the second half was so freaking great I forgave all of it's faults.  <br>You need 12 kickstarters then</br>  <br>Oh what then, it's not Japanese enough for you? It's not even western enough. It's more of a mix of both.<br>We like Japanese anime and manga, but we aren't all wapanese here, you know.</br></br>  I'm actually a bit upset now because Mandy was so great and now we'll never see more of her.  <br>People not liking LWA2 is a strong overreaction that is always mandatory when a large amount of people are hyped over something.<br><br>They will whine and whine about it because they can't stand people being happy.<br><br>This has happened with every show that generated large amounts of hype.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Lets make TWELVE kickstarters! Lets do it!</br></br>  <br>I cannot comprehend people not liking it</br>   For the second time a "big bad" gets BTFO by Shiny Chariot move <br><br>How was Shiny Chariot not OP as fuck? No one seems to respect her, but she had the most OP as fuck wand, constantly took on huge "ancient" bullshit.<br><br>The power levels in this anime make no fucking sense.</br></br></br></br>   you try to fuck a slavshit <br> she farts and kills your boner </br>  <br>Yes anon. You should be able to buy it.</br>  <br>Because they didn't backed up the kickstarter</br>  <br>SUCY Best magical Egyptian dancer.</br>  <br>But that is Atleir.<br><br>Did you think the potions and food and bombs you make in Atleir can't be used in combat?</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe the Mahou community excommunicated her and pulled a pic-related.<br><br>Didn't work out as well as it hoped, though.</br></br></br>  <br>She put on flashy shows for Muggles which was frowned upon by the witching community. Notice how most of the teachers at the academy are No Fun Allowed types and Diana, who is from a noble house of witches or something, also disdains frivolity.</br>  The orgy that followed will be in the BD right?  So what big overarching plot for LWA is possible?<br><br>More Ancient Evil Awakens?</br></br>  Well damn that came out quicker than I expected.<br>I thought it would still have so many delays.<br><br>Those you of who are disappointed judging by budget are forgetting kickstarter is an investment system, you are investing money into the company not buying a product.<br><br>You are investing in not just LWA2 but everything the company offers, it would not be unreasonable for the some of the budget to be used on things like KLK, of course they need the majority of it for LWA2 plus any merch they produce.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Disney movies cannot show orgies.</br>  <br> boys <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>flashy shows apparently double as boss-finishing moves</br>  <br>akko becomes the new shiny chariot that's it</br>  <br>Akko needs to pass or she'll be put back a year!</br>  <br><br>It's not necessary when they all can grow futa dicks anyway.</br></br>  How much money did they get from the kickstarter to make this?<br>It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime.</br>  <br> you are investing money into the company not buying a product. <br>Except you aren't. Unless if you think you are investing in Nike by buying a pair of sneakers.</br></br>  <br> /x/ </br>  <br>I can see it being an episodic SoL-type thing. Some possible episodes are<br><br> Akko wants to get gud at broom flying and enlists her friends' help <br> Lotte enters a spell-singing competition <br> Sucy's potion goes horribly wrong and turns most of the school into zombies <br> Witch Knight comes to town <br> Amanda tries to pull off a heist but gets captured and Team Akko needs to rescue her <br> Diana has a Muggle fan club, which her family disapproves of </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean horny zombies.</br>  <br>The Kickstarter was only there to extend the lenght.<br><br>150.000 for 15 additional minutes. <br><br>A TV anime would be much more expensive because:<br><br>1) It would be much longer resulting into higher costs in every department<br>2) The whole thing needs far more management because you can't just put something on TV out of nothing<br>3) You don't do a TV show only for the sake of having a TV show - You need partners in many departments to get the best out of it<br><br>A TV anime that does LWA justice would probably cost a few millions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doujins when?</br>  Other than the boys' gang, this was as good as the first one. And those fights, damn! So much background animation.  <br> It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime. <br>The Japanese people don't give a shit about it and westeners don't buy BDs.</br></br>  Who's the biggest dyke this time now?  <br>Japan has shit taste, this is an established fact.</br>  <br>Diana always</br>  <br>Diana will keep being tsun to Akko until the point where Akko actually reaches her goal and becomes a witch worthy of Dianna's admiration.</br>  <br>Posting in a sticky.</br>  The magnet still works! Thanks anon!  <br>is this shit even good</br>  <br>More than a few, a few million would get you a pretty cheap looking TV show. Maybe 3 or 4 million though.</br>  Damn, that was way better than the first one. A 8/10 for me. Other than that annoying group of boys, the music, animation and overall just sealed it for me. Amanda and Lotte are best girls.<br><br>Also, GSC figures when? Maybe even Nendoroids.</br></br>  <br>Why would another studio fund a rival upcoming studio?<br>Studio Trigger is too new and ambitious, overtime they'll build up a better financial base and be able to do the things they want to do.<br><br>Not every studio started making what they make now, hell some of them were smaller than Trigger and just uni students.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Can't we just take the kickstarter budget, multiply it by 12 or make 12 of them and get a full season? <br><br>Is it not that simple?</br></br></br></br>  Fuck you, I ain't streaming this shit. Payers forced to pirate, good.  <br>Like Gainax you mean?</br>  <br>It's better for LWA to stay a OVA series or maybe extend into feature movie format.<br><br>Nobody would fund a TV show with this much quality. It would break everyones budget.</br></br></br>  The wallpaper makes a lot more sense now.  http://i.imgur.com/XfS1BQH.jpg  <br>You can.<br>But that would probably take 5-10 years to finish.</br></br>  <br><br>Just use JDownloader.

I'm not saying the show isn't kid-friendly, but to act like the staff didn't intend the characters to be cute and attractive to nerds is ridiculous. Fuck, even mainstream TV stuff really obviously marketed at kids tends to make sure to draw the characters in an attractive way to appeal to fanboys &amp; fangirls, so to expect Trigger to take that stance would be insane.<br><br>The "westaboo anime" stuff is wrong too. LWA is a million times more anime-esque than Panty &amp; Stocking, and Panty &amp; Stocking itself was far more anime-esque than people claim in spite of the colossal western cartoon influences.<br><br>It's true that Yoshinari is a "westaboo" in that he even worships stuff that English-speaking cartoon nerds don't give a fuck about like Atomic Betty, but LWA is not a "westaboo" work in itself at all. It simply uses principles associated with good ANIMATION in general; just because those animation principles first came about in the west and were written down by Disney doesn't mean they are "westaboo", as pretty much all well-animated anime with "cartoony" aesthetics use them. LWA itself is no more "westaboo" than FLCL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127572299 <br> You mean "no subs". <br>No, I mean too Japanese.

So where's the website where I can jerk over my name if I backed just 20 american euros?  <br>These designs are extremely anime-like; you won't find a western cartoon that looks like this unless it's directly influenced by anime. It's not "westaboo" it's just traditional anime aesthetics executed well.

I've watched LWA1 several dozen times, and I'll probably do the same with LWA2. The characters are so lovable and I want more of them. I also have a major weakness for witches.  I forgot she was the voice of Hime from Happiness Charge Precure. Now Akko sounds like Hime to me rather than Hime sounding like Akko.<br><br>I guess that's what happens when a show runs for an entire year VS. a single OVA</br></br>  <br> so he at least knows that he's not white <br>Animators only do line art, you know?</br></br>  Team Sushio  <br>This works because it's short and there was large pause between 1 and 2.<br>If this ends up normal 12+ anime series you'll get your usual load of QUALITY, cliches, filler and inane shit.</br></br>  <br>Do we need more though?

KLK was disappointing.  even Rocky had a montage  Good subs when?  <br> I wonder what Trigger's next TV series will be like <br>Nowhere to go but up</br></br>  noice   Constantze's wand turning into a drill   <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-07-02/trigger-teases-new-pro<wbr>ject-and-new-inferno-cop-little-wit<wbr>ch-academia-crossover-short/.90008<br><br> Studio Trigger teased a new project, its fourth major project, at its Anime Expo panel on Thursday. It showed preliminary designs of several school students as well as a verdant city in the sea, intersected with bridges. The staff members added that the project has yet to be announced in Japan. Because of that, they disallowed photographs of the art and could not take questions on the project from the audience. <br><br> Studio Trigger also showed an Inferno Cop short with a crossover with Little Witch Academia characters. The staff said that the short has yet to premiere in Japan. </br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Good point.</br>  <br>Recent comments from Trigger people along with the release of a Nishigori art book hint that it will probably be something that Nishigori will be in charge of, so I expect it to be competent but not particularly impressive. Nishigori is a skilled artist but he's not quite as good as people like Imaishi and Yoshinari, and his designs are only GREAT as opposed to merely good when they're simply finalized versions based upon endless concept sketches from Gainax/Trigger people, like Panty &amp; Stocking and Gurren Lagann's designs.<br><br>I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again, a more major project than Yucie.</br></br></br>  <br>Look, the color palettes aren't even consistent between scenes.<br>Obviously, they didn't do much pre-production planning on these characters.</br></br>  <br> I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again <br>iktfb, I watch flcl like 4 times a year.</br></br>  <br><br>I think there will be a TV "remaster" of Ninja Slayer. I'm not sure what it will entail but I assume they'll just replace most of the Inferno Cop stuff with normal animation.</br></br>  <br>Mute loli mecha witch best new witch.</br>  <br>It reminded me that KLK was as great as LWA and that I love Trigger</br>  <br><br>She gives off such professional vibe.</br></br>  <br> It is fanservice for fans of western animation, though! <br>Yes because it was so uncannily similar to shitty flash animation. </br></br>  <br>What needs to happen now is a slice of life show starring all of Trigger's original characters living together and getting up to antics<br><br>I always wanted that from Gainax</br></br></br>  <br>LWA3 When</br>  <br>That makes no sense. The Inferno Cop stuff is the only point of Ninja Slayer.</br>  <br>You're right, but once again: if the short fat man was meant to be Ian J then Hori kinda fucked up because he doesn't actually look like Ian J in the least beyond being chubby and having what Hori probably sees as "black man lips".<br><br>But yeah, it was probably just something he added in of his own accord and it wasn't any "GUYS LET'S ADD STEVEN UNIVERSE STUFF" talk he had with the staff. See also that Connie lookalike being light-skinned and Mabel and Dipper's colors being totally off.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd be fine with a daicon-esque music video featuring all their characters.</br>  I wish the western animation industry wasn't irredeemably shit.  <br>That has nothing to do with /pol/ though.<br>JADF = Just Another DrawFag<br><br>You might be confusing it with JIDF.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Because the people who worked on LWA are people from the Japanese anime industry.</br>  <br> I always wanted that from Gainax <br>That would end up looking like Kappa Mikey between all the different art styles</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br> When an American studio tries to copy animu, like Avatar and Korra, it still goes on /co/. Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>You know, I see a pattern in there.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Anon do you realize your example goes against your point</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br> Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>For the same reason Avatar and Korra belong on /co/? I'm not really following you here.</br></br>  <br>I'm gonna be pissed as fuck if the new show will have the same schedule/budget problem KLK had.<br>A third of the episode were almost unwatchable.<br>I hope by now they have their shit together.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it was better than the first.</br>  <br>Otsuka wasn't the series director of FLCL but he directed like 3 out of 6 episodes. He wrote both LWAs and his input on Gurren Lagann was similarly important (he directed some of the best, most important episodes) but he is practically never, ever talked about. <br><br>The man strikes me as a "silent protector" of sorts for Trigger &amp; Gainax projects. No one even notices him but I'm sure a lot of the qualities of things that people consider classics while attributing entirely to people like Tsurumaki or Imaishi were Otsuka's doing.<br><br>I mean, the guy directed Gurren episode 8, the episode that made /a/ go fucking nuts when it aired.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah dude that would be to simple.

Korra and Avatar are still /co/ because the mindset is cartoon. It doesn't matter that they had actual Japanese studios, and sweatshops full of dirty Koreans working on them.<br><br>That's not what makes anime, anime. Trigger is no different. It's an Americanized studio full of westaboos, which is even worse than an American studio full of weeaboos.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  full fledged anime series when  The mugshots of the new girls made me think of that Psycho Pass ED.    <br>Hopefully never.</br>  fuck this was too perfect, i loved it.  <br>Subcontracting things doesn't make American cartoons anime.<br><br>Meanwhile, LWA and Panty&amp;Stocking are anime. You mad?</br></br></br>  <br>So much pout and grumpiness.</br>  <br>What makes anime anime is that they're made and produced by Japanese studios<br><br>Korra isn't that, regardless of how it looks, and anything Gainax or Trigger makes is that, also regardless of how it looks.<br><br>"Anime" isn't the design or how many archetypal characters a show has. If you watched enough anime you'd realise that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is nothing "Americanized" about LWA. It's a very well-made anime. The problem is you've associated actual good character designs and animation as "western", and you think anime is defined by being generic shit.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Why are none of you bringing up the fact that LWA is extremely anime-like? The designs are anime as fuck, it's just appealingly-drawn anime. The standards of cartoon "appeal" were defined by Americans, but ALL good-looking anime use them. LWA is no more "westaboo" than FLCL; both have western media references but both are largely very anime-like.<br><br>Yoshinari is also a huge fan of Osamu Tezuka; people also say Tezuka works are "western cartoon style" but they're not, they took western influences but utilized them in a uniquely Japanese way. In fact, Tezuka style is the purest form of the "traditional anime" aesthetic and the best-looking "traditional anime" is made by people who understand what Tezuka created on a deeper level than the average artist.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Anime and American animation are so far apart from each other that they have almost nothing in common. All LWA has is some vague stylistic similarities, probably in the character design, and that's it. It's nowhere near enough to bridge the gap between the two.<br><br>But I guess to some people (read: clueless newbies) anime is defined by pantyshots and power levels.</br></br></br>  <br>Anime isn't a genre. Welcome to /a/.</br>  Stop responding to the dumbass who's been trying forever to convince people to accept his retarded definition of "anime," and that the hundreds of people on /a/ who funded the show back when it had a sticky are secretly crossboarding /co/-scum.  <br>my thoughts exactly, I normally really like that type of character but it was too much</br>  <br>So Studio Pierrot isn't Japanese now?

Sorry.</br>  <br><br>Fucking hivemind, man.<br><br>But yeah the "westaboo" stuff is silly, Yoshinari being more into American cartoons than the average Japanese creator notwithstanding. LWA is a very anime-like work and there's no reason beyond pretentiousness to see it as something that goes "beyond anime" and becomes "something greater". It's simply good anime.<br><br>Panty &amp; Stocking was an overt American cartoon tribute and far more western-styled than LWA but it was still anime as fuck. It was full of Kanada-style animation which is basically the most Japanese form of animation imaginable along with use of anime-like perspective and expressions and countless other things.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    It was fine I guess, I'm really biased against disney cliches though.  <br>Isn't it a shitty vimeo link?<br>Since Kikestarter got hacked I deleted my account so I don't know.

Tezuka may have taken Bambi's eyes, but his overall style is not at all like that of Bambi. He was more overtly influenced by Carl Barks' Donald Duck comics, but that's only part of it. Fleischer animation clearly played a colossal part, at least their early work from before they tried to rip off Looney Tunes and Disney; he liked Popeye so much that he inserted him in his Monkey King manga.<br><br>Yoshinari's "normal anime" art looks so fucking appealing and good because he understands the foundation of the aesthetic.

Character design, animation style (and quality), backgrounds, music, sound design, voice acting, stories, direction, editing, visual language, cultural sensibilities, character archetypes... at best LWA bears some vague resemblance to some American animation on a superficial level.<br><br>I'm guessing you're really new to anime and have a very superficial, cliche-driven understanding of it. Either that or you're a shill.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for reminding me /a/, LWA e-mail is apparently spam.</br>  <br>Tattun and at least Wakabayashi went to Pixar for multiple days before the con.<br><br>They almost certainly are doing something for them.</br></br></br>  <br> Inferno Cop will never get a 1080p BD release with smooth 60FPS animation </br>   <br> I cannot refute this claim because I know nothing about what LWA originates from! <br>Thanks for continuously showing how little you know about anime.

While posing as a fan.<br><br> It's a rip-off because it's a poor clone that brings nothing new to the table. <br>A clone of what?</br></br></br></br>  There's something very wrong about this frame. It's like I'm not even watching anime.   Trigger announces new project <br>   Aerial Girls </br>  <br> They inevitably fight each other <br> Which culminates on them realizing something <br> That they want hot steamy kisses from each other while holding hands </br></br></br>  <br> Everyone here is from Leddit <br><br>Yeah, no, faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Akko breaks a leg and her friends try to cheer her up for roughly 40 minutes of screentime.</br>  <br>That Famicon.</br>  <br><br>Anime cuteness is very different from western cartoon cuteness and comparing LWA to 90s Disney style is the most surface-level and shallow thing.<br><br>Look at how Tezuka drew a 'cute cartoon bunny girl' design vs. how a Disney film did it. Anime cuteness is far more focused on the bare impression than the details. Takashi Murakami (I think) once made the point that a cartoon cat in the west is "a drawing of a cat", while Japan's Hello Kitty feels like "a drawing of a drawing of a cat". That's a fantastic way of wording it.</br></br></br></br>   <br>Nothing new about anime's magical skirts.</br>  <br> &gt;A clone of what? <br>The standard children's movie plot progression.<br><br>If you were entertained for even a second during this episode, you have the mental capacity of a 5 year old. When you can literally predict every single scene, how is that not a derivative clone?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm trying to find the tweet, not this one, but Grant seemed to imply it's some sort of a personal project.</br>  <br> Patrick Robert Steward </br>  <br>finally some good news, maybe i will not kill myself afterall</br>  <br> Bambi Bunny <br><br>Thanks Disney for creating a generation of furfags.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The fundamentals of animation is still the same in both western/eastern cultures; that is to say, what they teach in american and japanese animation curriculums are wholly the same. You cant say its a cartoon just because it looks like a cartoon- when both are inherently the same fucking thing. Good examples of animation from either cultures would tend to reach a middle point, where they are indistinguishable from each other- apart from deliberate stylistic choices.</br></br>  <br>Stay strong, bro. We all have to hold out until we get mandy doujins.</br>  This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. But it's still anime.  <br> Grant seemed to imply it's some sort of a personal project <br>Probably some feature-length film with both 3D and 2D animation.</br></br>  <br><br>It really depends if the anime is echhi or not. If it's not echii, magical skirts are an automatic thing and you will never see what's underneath.</br></br>  <br>She's not getting brutally fucked by old men.</br>  <br>why does she look so familiar<br>also best witch</br></br>  <br>Just like Korra, amirite?<br><br><br>I don't know why you're making this about the animation. My whole argument stems from the fact that animation style doesn't make anime anime, otherwise Korra would be anime.<br><br>It's the thematic elements. The direction style. The utterly bland story telling.</br></br></br></br></br></br>     Total times episode has been viewed on Vimeo: 2,320 <br> Seeds on Horriblesubs: 3,034 </br>  Figures when?  kill la kill had me worried about lwa2 but its seems it turned out great.  <br>i was pissed at her being selfish and not apologizing to her two friends expecting everything to be okay once she finishes her damn project. The fuck kind of moral story is that ?<br><br>" It's okay if you fight with your friends even if you don't apologize as long as you do something cool they'll be your friends again. "</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, what sort of faggots bother seeding?</br>  <br>It's something you see constantly in western cartoons and children's movies.</br>  <br>When you say it's a clone you mean it's a clone of a specific work. But since you don't mean that, why are you calling it a clone? It isn't one. Using predictable, "standard" storytelling doesn't make it a clone of anything. There's also nothing wrong with being predictable. LWA2 is good because of the story's execution, the characters, the animation, the music and so on.<br><br>You're the type of person who always wants novelty for novelty's sake and who thinks the only thing that ever matters in any sort of fiction is the plot. And how novel it is. In short you're a moron.<br><br><br> The fundamentals of animation is still the same in both western/eastern cultures <br>Maybe at the most basic of basic levels, but beyond that they're nothing alike. And Western countries are hardly even producing hand-drawn animation anymore anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tezuka's bunny girl is 100x cuter though. Chances are Yoshinari would agree.</br>  <br>It's also something you constantly see... everywhere.</br>  <br>Tezuka was such a furfag...</br>  <br/>  So did this movie get a song this time?  <br><br><br>Nigga please, panty shot was a Ghibli classic, the anime doesn't have to be ecchi at all, look at this diabetes shit from Ghibli-wannabe.<br>Fuck Trigger for not giving me the due panties.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They do OST</br>  <br>Ghibli girls aren't sexualized.<br>It's ok to show their panties.</br></br>  I quite like how there's a lot of British details that aren't in your face, I mean besides Akko parachuting with the Union Flag. I wouldn't expect anyone from Japan to know what a Punch and Judy stand is.<br><br>I've noticed Jasmineka eating Kettle Chips, Walkers Crisps and Skips.</br></br>  <br> LWA2 is good because of the story's execution,  <br>Utterly formulaic, to an insane degree.<br> the characters, <br>Totally one dimensional, no real development.<br> the animation,  <br>Not as good as the movie, an insult for the money.<br> the music  <br>I can't remember a single track.<br><br>I liked LWA1. Not a huge amount, but I could see some value there. LWA2 was trash.<br><br>I'm very sorry that I'm over the age of 5, and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. Watching the same thing, over and over, that's what autists and children like. It really wouldn't have taken much. A single second that wasn't totally paint-by-numbers, and phoned in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. <br>How is this even particularly similar to Tiny Toons/Animaniacs/whatever, let alone "purely" that style?<br><br>Are you making the comparison because the animation reminds you of the TMS episodes of those shows? Those were animated in Japan, you know.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ghibli girls aren't sexualized. <br>Not with that attitude</br></br>  <br>Also, Shaun of the Dead</br>  tfw the west will never go back to doing hand drawn animation<br><br>Why must Japan be the only country left with an appreciation for animation? <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/yZibUpH-AME?t=5m22<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>france still draws their stuff I think.</br>  <br> and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. <br>So you don't watch anime at all?</br></br>  So glad I backed this.  <br>Face it, it'll never revive to its former glory days. If it weren't for the widespread popularity of manga and the otaku fanbase, Japan would have also stopped giving a shit about 2d animation.</br>  <br>Because the Japanese are the only ones who can draw so well in such a large scale.<br><br>The West is divided into too few individuals.<br>The 3D favoritism and "easy-way-out" Flash style animation isn't helping either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That shota's got a fat ass.</br>  <br>Tezuka was not involved with any incarnation of "furry fandom". Liking cute appealing cartoon design shouldn't amount to being associated with furry culture and "furry" is not a sexual orientation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The fuck are you all arguing about?

Really, I'm not that fussy about what constitutes "new", a slightly different mix of archetypes sat round a table is enough to make it fresh.<br><br>But LWA2?

Will die before he gets any saving done.</br>  <br>Showing the back is different from showing the front.</br>  I was kind of hoping lwa2 would look into making diana and akko friends but they still seem to maintain the status quo.  <br><br>A friend of mine spent some time as a kindergarten teacher. He showed them some animated films; the 5 year olds there called golden-age Disney stuff "badly drawn" and only liked 3DCG.<br><br>I used to think that such a thing couldn't happen and that 2D will remain inherently appealing, but....</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's really hot, to be honest. You can't even really notice the butt shot when watching it normally, but the fact that they included that small glimpse of Akko ass really gets me going.</br>  <br>Your obsession with labelling anyone who disagrees with you as a child gives the impression you're somewhat insecure in your own maturity. Not every plot has to be deeply intellectual, and adults can enjoy simple storylines too. I'd hazard a guess that not one person went into LWA2 expecting any ending other than Akko and team coming together to beat the bad guy, but that doesn't necessarily make the experience a bad one.</br>  <br>Good, good. In that case, yes. It's far better than KLK.</br>  <br> black void <br>Fix your monitor settings.</br></br>  <br> black void <br>It's just shading.</br></br>  <br>Surely you're not gonna say  isn't sexualized fanservice, right?</br>  <br>Good taste.</br>  What's with the dramatic brooding Batman-esque score over the end credits?  <br>you should have linked <br><br><br>He COULD say "oh no, they didn't mean it to be sexual" it if not for Trigger being obvious perverts, Yoshinari drawing official LWA art with a focus on Akko's butt and one of the animators drawing suggestive Akko x Sucy yuri.<br><br>They obviously want to give LWA a more innocent feeling but it's not like they don't want male nerds watching it. The manga ran in a seinen magazine.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty slow for a sticky if you ask me.</br>  <br> I'd hazard a guess that not one person went into LWA2 expecting any ending other than Akko and team coming together to beat the bad guy, but that doesn't necessarily make the experience a bad one. <br>You don't seem to get my point. When I watch some cute girls shit, I'm pretty confidant that at the end nothing will have really changed and we'll be back to the status quo.<br><br>In LWA2, EVERY SCENE is like that. I don't know if Chinatsu is going to pour herself some tea or not, but I can literally predict every single event in LWA2 with pinpoint accuracy. It's like watching something you've already seen, and know all the lines to.

If you were unfamiliar with that kind of stuff then I understand you missing it, but it's super Japanese and really blatant.</br>  There are VIDEOGAMES made out of MAGIC in this world, I need me some of that.  <br> then the teacher did the whole Japanese live stage thing where she calls things out for the audience. <br>no. that's not what she did. She was pretending that it was all part of the show.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's a bit dissapointing. At least it's still totally something you could show to your daughter.</br>  <br><br> trigger never release sheet music. <br><br>I guess I could transcribe it myself i guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what he said.</br>  <br>You are a pretentious poser. You want "innovative" stories and "deep" characters just so you can tell everyone you're engaged in profoundly intellectual artistic pursuits and not merely entertaining yourself like some commoner. It's all just an act, and your actual knowledge of and interest in movies/other fiction is skin deep.<br><br>Anyone who isn't a pretentious poser will tell you that while LWA2 doesn't have an original, unpredictable story is it nevertheless well-executed and entertaining for what it is. They would also realize that it isn't supposed to be some deep character study and psychological drama, and would hardly even have any time for that. The characters are likable not because of some childhood trauma, moral dilemma or philosophical babble but because of their basic characterization, design and animation. I don't know if Constantze even had any lines, but she's an immediately likable character.<br><br>And then there's the animation and presentation in general which are really nice too. But of course they don't have any "deep" "meaning" to them so who cares right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I enjoy my 3D anime with games and MMD videos, but when I watch shows entirely made out of animation, I expect drawn animation because I honestly see it as superior and more appealing.</br>  okay that shitty brat and his tomato hijinks better be a one time thing. Everything was going good till that pile of shit showed up. Trigger better leave this series as a girl only cast.

It's not like we get a sticky for other anime announcements? Some serious favoritism going on here.

Let me guess, you're one of the backers left in denial.<br><br>So you payed these retards 800 grand for a generic 30 minute sci-fi OVA, it's been a year with nothing but updates that say absolutely nothing but "w-we're working on it seriously guys!!", and not only that, one year after it's been funded the studios have split and half the staff replaced, so who knows where the fuck that money is or when that shitty OVA is coming. The production went to shit and you got played like a violin, congratulations.</br></br></br>  Absolutely inspired direction, every scene just flows so well and is so visually engrossing  <br>that's a shaft show, isn't it?</br>  <br>This<br>Who was the director? This whole thing was just incredibly well done.</br></br>  <br>Her character could have been replaced with a boulder, but she was cute, at least.</br>  <br><br>it was good. but also kinda clichee-laden. I wouldn't call it inspired. Just good execution of old recipes.</br></br>  <br>How the fuck did that shit raise 800 grand? At least with LWA2, people already liked LWA and saw that there was a competent staff behind it.</br>  It was kinda meh. Oh well, considering the budget they did alright.  <br>LWA is You Yoshinari's pet project, though obviously lots of people are responsible for the final result.</br>  <br>Mostly Hideo Kojima shilling for them (he was my boy before but he ain't my boy no more) and also they pandered to MAL and reddit fucking hard. They unironically spread the #keepanimealive hashtag.</br>  <br>you can take the most tired cliches ever and make them interesting/fun if you're talented enough, which this guy clearly is</br>  <br>Because they advertised it with some stupid "SAVE ANIME" shit, and all the people that don't watch anime ate it up.</br>  <br> You Yoshinari <br>Well that certainly explains it.</br></br>  Has this not been posted yet?  Had better animation than literally everything I've watched all year.  <br>Calm the fuck down, Diana.</br>  <br>The fuck does Kojima know about making anime? Fucking casuals.</br>  <br>there was a pony in LWA1 too. Although it was maggot-infested.</br>  <br>Just remember that we always have an Inferno Cop x LWA anime to look forward to.</br>  It was okay I guess.  fat-chan stole one of akko's hair  HAPPY TIME KEIKAKU  i want to sniff little witch butt.<br><br>and fuck whoever already posted the two pics i wanted to post.</br></br>  <br>heh pony</br>  <br>I'm not a even a backer. you sound more like a backer than I</br>  <br> people actually seeding </br>  <br>Remember back when people could put ponies in the rooms of little girls to show that they were into stereotypical little girl things?</br>  <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clito<wbr>cybe_nuda</wbr></br></br>  <br>Under the Dog was taking advantage of the whole "Anime is trash and cookie cutter" angle and some people went "Muh mature storytelling" and gave it dosh, but it was originally not going to make it's funding goal, but then a bunch of youtubers and bloggers decided to cram the kickstarter down our throats, and then a bunch of sheep donated to make the goal.</br>  <br>And what is she gonna do with it?</br>  <br> depending on a flaky connection for streamin <br>My stream was 10/10 with no interrupts or buffering.</br></br>  <br>Pls respond</br>  <br>Butt sniffing is easily my favorite fetish.

Actual subs or just memeshit?  <br><br>The first two seasons were subbed pretty well by Commie, I'd assume this will be okay.</br></br>  <br> Swan Song </br>  <br>Swan Song &gt; Superb Song</br>  What a great first episode. I wonder if this season will have a bigger shocker than Hibiki getting her arm ripped off  <br>While I agree, the official name is Superb Song.</br>  <br> Tsubasa literally says 'Superb Song' in G 02 <br> still translate it as 'Swan Song' </br></br>  GAAAAAY  But why?  <br>same as everything in symphogear<br>phonic gain</br></br>  <br>Now post Chris' line.</br>  I wonder what Zoid's release will be like  First episode poll<br><br>http://strawpoll.me/4824420</br></br>  <br> no "N/A" <br/></br>  <br>What a lewd couple, they definitely fugged off screen.<br>How many pairings were confirmed in this first episode? At least 3, Tsubasa x Chris, Miku x Hibiki, Kiraka x Shirabe. Am I missing any?</br></br>  <br> Chirs </br>  Wow, they're NOT holding back this season     Not NAMU-SAN <br>Dropped.</br>  Question: how come the Oregairu episodes were like 200 MB while this one is 559? Not complaining I just wanna know  <br> tfw   spelt my own name wrong </br>  <br>Lots more things going on visually</br>  <br> Miku and Hibiki fug on-screen <br> Aoi using her Sex Bear voice </br></br>  <br>Action = more bitrate.<br>Dialogue = less bitrate.</br></br>  <br> sexual innuendos with Chris <br> singing duet with I LOVE YOU and first name basis with Maria <br>She definitely fucked them both. Tsubasa is the alpha in this anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Some hands moving quickly is nothing compared to actual action scenes</br>  When is the next Macross coming out again?  Zoid when?  Why are you so perfect Hibiki?    <br><br><br>Chris is just letting Hibiki know what Tsubasa gets every night.</br></br></br>  First episode was great. I missed this show so much.  Charm point.  <br>He's done translating but I think the typesetter is sleeping.</br>  <br>2lewd4me</br>   .mkv   Didn't the concerts used to look sort of semi-realistic at some point? Like all the effects were pyrotechnics and stuff?<br><br>When did we go full Macross Frontier?</br></br>  <br>hahawhat</br>    <br><br><br> you will never tell Hibiki a really corny joke that makes her giggle </br></br></br>  <br>What</br>  <br>What the fuck else would it be?<br>.xvid?</br></br>   mfw that hotblooded singing <br>Do you think it will be the same in the single release? Or it was just to fit this scene?<br>It's too good<br><br><br>Oh god</br></br></br></br></br>  Haha  Are they gayer than Hibiki and Miku?  <br><br>Commie stop fucking with us</br></br>  <br>And this episode was strings and a pan of glass.</br>  <br>Do you know Japanese?</br>    So is this the last season? Is it over after this?  What's the name for the first song they sing at the beginning of the episode?  <br>HibiMiku definitely have to step it up.</br>  <br>You can hear the normal, not-screamy version in the second PV.</br>  <br>Yes. If this episode wasn't enough to show it your gaydar is probably broke.</br>  Come on guys, for once who cares if someone does/doesn't want to watch Commie. We're here for SYMPHOGEAR.  <br>Every season is the last season</br>  <br>They aren't gay. They're just two halves of a whole.</br>  <br>But I don't want to, this is obviously superior.</br>  <br>Zoid's translation of the scene:<br>Tsubasa: Just like Yukine, this ride is a bit rough around the edges.<br>Chris: Then you better learn to get used to it, Senpai!</br></br></br>  Who else thought when Shirabe talked about Kirika's arm it looked like she was about to grab her boobs instead?  <br>How fucking terrible</br>  <br>honestly I think commie's fits a slight bit better although still off.</br>  Remember the old days of transforming when it was like 10 seconds or something?<br><br>We've come so far</br></br>  <br>I should draw a V2 of this.</br>  <br>Took me a few rewatches to realize</br>  I can feel the BUDGET flowing through me  <br>It's definitely what they said. You could remove the "dear" though</br>  <br>So it's still gay as fuck. Got it</br>  <br>Definitely sounds less like "I RIDE HER EVERY NIGHT IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN"</br>  <br>No it's still gay.</br>  <br> forcing innuendo on a banter scene </br>  Hibiki please  <br>Good to have another reason not to watch HorribleShit</br>    Did Kirito always had those bumps on her? I thought she was flat.  <br> Commie <br>NOPE.</br></br>  Lewd.  <br>I just want Hibiki to be happy with M e_  and I supposed Tsubasa can have everyone else in her harem, that would be hot.</br>  I fucking love SYMPHOGEAH  <br><br><br>It's more about teasing Chris about her brash attitude.</br></br></br>  <br> auto correct fixes kirika into kirito <br>What the fuck?</br></br>  <br>it has a non sexual meaning to it as well. saying "rough around the edges" doesn't fit well when talking about a ride though. but because the clear innuendo purposes I still say its a bit wrong how commie does it, I just think its more appropriate than zoid's.</br>  <br>Come on, you know you'll watch it live, the raw, commie and the other groups subs.</br>  <br> Sword's stomach <br>You could serve a 5-star meal on her chest and use her navel as a makeshift wine glass.</br></br>  <br> My dear Senior </br>  <br>Why the is she doing this<br>I'm pretty sure Chris has stabilizers just like Hibiki</br></br>  EXTERMINATE WITH OPENING SEQUENCE NEXT WEEK.<br>I'm ready.</br>  <br>I definitely like both takes on the scene. It's nice to have more literal subs in addition to Commie's attempts to localize the script a bit. I'll probably end up watching both releases.</br>  <br>But this is the final last season right?</br>  <br>Would take Hibiki on a date to dine on Tsubasa's cute belly.</br>  Radiant force single when?  What's with all the slapstick tsun shit between Chris and Hibiki?  <br>Because Hibiki was in the way and she couldn't shoot missiles any further back without damaging the shuttle.</br>  Objectively the gayest scene in the episode  <br>There isn't enough room on the shuttle for Chris's stabilizers. The ones she uses for her missile stance are fucking gigantic and take a bit to anchor, the shuttle deck probably wouldn't even be able to support her, it'd rip right off.</br>  <br>Same as S2, they didn't say anything.</br>  <br>They've been doing that since the first series. Every time Hibiki tries to jump on here, she's like "What the fuck"</br>  <br> hibiki x miku <br> tsubasa x kanade x maria <br> kirika x shirabe <br> chris <br>she's just jealous</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>September 30, with BD1</br>  <br>Ayyyy</br>  <br>I never recall anything like his happening.</br>  <br>Serious question, why would you think this?</br>  <br>more like symphogay</br>   polished toenails <br><br>Muh dick</br></br>  <br> September 30 <br>That late? Damn.</br></br>  <br>Why is everyone so gay?</br>  <br>Footfag fuck off. We don't need your kind in here.</br>  <br>A ride doesn't have rough edges, get the fuck out with this ESL shit.</br>  <br>This reminds me of ALL THE GAY JOKES good college friends make with one another. Dat phonic gain is strong between them.</br>  <br>Their singing turns even random pilots gay.</br>  <br> static dialog with many panning or still frames  <br> suplexing a fucking space shuttle  <br><br>Why do you think?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Chris does that when embarrassing things start happening. <br><br>All the more reason that the Tsubasa and Chris talk on the rockets wasn't meant as anything lewd since Hibiki never got decked for it.</br></br></br>  <br>  <br><br>Delicious indeed.</br></br></br>  <br>Symphogear StrikerS next.</br>  <br> B-but I'm married... <br>Truly, Symphogeah is a force to be reckoned with.</br></br>  <br> senior <br><br>Thank phonic gain we have options with time</br></br></br>  IS IT FRIDAY YET?  <br>Don't forget the<br> concert with shitloads of lighting effects, lens flare and glittering water drops <br>I wouldn't be surprised if that concert scene alone took 100 MB</br></br></br>  I bet you didn't catch this wink.    <br>There is literally nothing wrong with senior<br><br>Chrissie on the other hand</br></br></br>  <br>FriGAY already came and went.</br>   Kanade is still kill   Now that DMJii are confirmed turbogay, doujins when?  <br>Is there any reason not to think this? Things can't continue on forever.</br>  <br>She will never come back.<br>It's time to let go.</br></br>  Imagine the amount of phonic gain they could achieve with the sounds of chris's moans.  I see pictures but I see no text on them.<br>What the heck</br>  Gekisou Gungnir or Seigi wo Shinjite, Nigirishimete?  <br><br> heard u talkin shit </br></br>  <br>Gekisou Gungnir.</br>  <br>avi is much better</br>  <br>Fix your player.</br>  <br>Not gay.

I thought Carol controlled the dolls, end Panty9 is feeling from her. That makes her SONG's ally  for now, at least .</br>  <br>Yep. That's the song Kaneko had said his favorite song of GX.</br>  <br>The best song of the season!!</br>  <br>They want to kill all geahs. It's why Phara said she's worthless to her without her gear.

It feels like they were supposed to be taking her to a cell or something, is she actually imprisoned under the concert hall; dragged out every now and then to do a little song and dance and return to her hole? Is it a different building?

SCANS WHERE?  <br>What's wrong with you colors, m8</br>  <br>So, is there an actual reason why she literally shoved her crotch into Bikki's face?</br>  <br>Why is the past upscaled and warpsharped?  It's like an anime. </br>  I thought Commie wasn't going to sub this? Where the fuck is H&amp;D?  Why the flying fuck is Deadfish out second?   Do we have a stich of this scene?  <br>I rationalized it as to make shure she doesn't hit her.</br>  <br>Get out with your DB shit.</br>  <br><br>Chris was still pretty tsun the whole time. She needs to go full dere at some point.</br></br>  <br>I dunno</br>  <br> That shitty localization <br> Still keeping to localizing in 2015 <br>Sasuga Commie.</br></br></br>  <br>  My daddy was burned at the stake! <br>  Yeah, well at least yours loved you. </br></br>  <br> Where did they even take Maria? <br>She has limited freedom as part of the deal so they're taking her back to her designated room and being kept under watch I guess? They're probably just heading towards a secret exit instead of above ground so the public doesn't know where she is.<br><br> How did Tsubasa reach it fast enough/know there were problems? <br>She probably heard the gunshots and rushed over. The fight actually started in the doll room and ended up in a different area so Maria survived long enough for Tsubasa to finish her waving, hear the gunshots and rush over. It just seemed very fast because of scene transitions.</br></br></br></br></br>  Another season of cancerous subs with no other option.  Someone needs to update this chart. I'd do it myself but won't be able to for a week or two.  <br>At least they are not Anime Junkies.</br>  <br> Why the flying fuck is Deadfish out second? <br>Because that's what Deadfish does? They take the vid of whoever subbed it first and reencode it for people with shitty computers.</br></br>  <br>Bikki's face is an actual pussy magnet.<br><br> Going with the whole "Hibiki is a harem protagonist" joke, she needs to plant her face into at least one crotch in the opening episode. Combined with Chris' tsundere antics later it all checks out. </br></br></br>  I made a webm but its too big and I don't wanna fix it<br>http://www.mediafire.com/watch/eoik<wbr>kzblvua4ii4/[Commie]_Senki_Zesshou_<wbr>Symphogear_GX_-_01_[A9903EC2].webm</wbr></wbr></br>  <br> commie <br>Seriously, they'll try to tell you the innuendo was there in the original, but Tsubasa was really only teasing Chris about her personality.</br></br>  <br>She needed the stability. Bikki could hold her there while she fired so she didn't have to use her gigantic bracing things</br>  you've gone too far this time, commie  <br><br> not Rainbow Flower </br></br>  Protect the loli.  Rape comes later.    Chrissie <br>Disgusting.

I'd rather have their localized version than "Ooh Chris-chan!"</br></br>  <br>PHONIC GAIN IS GOING ON</br>  <br>P H O N I C G A I N<br>H<br>O<br>N<br>I<br>C<br><br>G<br>A<br>I<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She probably doesn't want to use it, D√°insleif is dangerous. Even accidental unsheathing would mean disaster.</br>  <br>And I'd rather people stop acting like 'localisation' is a good thing.</br>  <br>SPACE<br>SHUTTLE<br>SUPLEX</br></br></br>  <br>I'd prefer just "Chris" to be honest. "Chrissie" is a nickname. Adding "chan" to the end of a name is not giving someone a nickname.<br><br>Just "Chris" is closer to an accurate translation than "Chrissie" is.<br><br>And that's what grinds my gears.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that Fine's skull?</br>   destroys a village and cause who knows how many just to save a fucking corpse <br><br>Fucking shitty S2 characters continue to fuck shit up even after they're dead.</br></br>  Kohai are cute. CUTE.  <br>My mind automatically converts it to "Aussie", which makes the dialogue very strange.</br>  I really hope we get some info on Bikki's dad this season. Feels like they've been teasing us about that hard  <br> if you were to localize it <br>you would be a massive faggot.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off with your shitty opinion.</br>  <br>Plus a space shuttle, two astronauts, and whatever data and artifacts they obtained from the Frontier capsule.</br>  <br> Kimi to Iu Oto, Kanade Tsukiru mate </br>  SLAY THE GAY  <br>Shirabe is cute, Kiri sucks</br>  <br>There's info about him in the keywords. After the concert disaster he lost his job, turned into an abusive drunk, and eventually left.</br>  <br>Hibikidad couldn't handle the bantz and ended up leaving.</br>  <br>The lights made it amusing.<br><br><br>So Hibiki will befriend the shit out Carol with understanding and hot-blooded fist hugs.<br><br><br>Megadeth Symphony clearly needs a dumbass for anchor support. Hibiki is also still rooted into the shuttle for reverse thrusting until Chris jumps on so there's no time to fuck around. Holding Chris in place is legitimately a good support for firing all those missiles anyway.<br><br>Good excuse for innocently lewd moment and more UWEEEH anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would like to commie to step up their game and localise Chris name to something I'm comfortable with, like Betty or Velma.</br>  According to someone on AX, it seems CR got Symphogear.    Episode aired in Tokyo and now it's trending on twitter.  <br>Stop. Shirabe is the cutest and best, but Kirika is great too.</br>   concert opening <br>meh/10<br>Fushichou no Flamme's hoooOOOOO was way better.</br></br>  <br>Straight males have only one end.</br>  <br>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br>Please other sub groups please don't drop this.<br>Anyone but crunchysubs.</br></br></br>  CR got Symphogear.  <br>And Genjuro is Hibiki's surrogate dad, and he wants to fight this season, so something bad could happen to him too.</br>  Getting real tired of your shit, Anime notJanai.  <br>It was suggested they rescue the pilots and get the fuck out of there. But Hibiki said fuck that because gotta save Mom-san's rotting corpse.</br>  <br><br>Even if CoMemes drops it, Zoid will save us.</br></br>  <br>Miku's waifu.</br>  Crunchy simulcasting GX now is pretty hilarious  <br> CR <br>Thank God. Much better than Commie.</br></br>  guys please stop watching and downloading commie  <br>Since when was commie adverse to editing CR rips</br>  <br>You mean well-preserved corpse.</br>  <br><br>Where are Chris' legs?</br></br>  <br>I'm going to enjoy those subbed songs.<br><br>Oh wait.</br></br></br>  <br>On Hibiki's shoulders.</br>  <br>But Hibiki wants a cute boyfriend, not Mikushit.</br>  <br>MOTHERFUCKING HYPE!<br><br>Enjoyed the shit out of the opening sequence and then some.

Stop trying to make murderers sympathetic with shitty sob stories. When does Sugita come back?</br></br></br>  <br> no wait for subs anymore </br>  <br> no matter how manly Hibiki becomes, Miku still doms her </br>  <br>Not-quite-leglock around Hibiki's head.<br>I'm not sure who I'm more jealous of.</br></br>  <br>It was a Geah bait.</br>  <br> We will never see Sugita voice a villain again. <br><br>Whats the point of staying alive?</br></br></br>  please tell me he says GUNGNIR DATOU? this is make or break for me  <br> Miku <br> not a cute boyfriend <br>Chris pls</br></br></br>  <br>Miku's face when she was doing this was too cute.</br>  <br>Nope</br>  <br>It was to lure out the geahs. Also, bikkie saved everyone.</br>  <br>Not yet.</br>  Ready to watch the geahs lose next week?   Hibiki being happy as fuck for having a symphogear <br>Hibiki confirmed for losing Gungnir again, this time permanently.</br>  <br>Yeah very cute.</br>  <br>Is there some way for a diagram to shows a faster hype increase than than being parallel to the y axys like it does in G? Like dunno, using those weird imaginary coordinates or something.</br>  <br><br> this time permanently <br><br>To much plot for this show, unless this is the last season.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Miku please</br>  <br> Phara beats Tsubasa <br> Starts kissing her to steal her soul <br> Maria gets jealous and Airgetlam responds </br></br></br>  <br>That's okay because Miku will get a geah again.  Bikki can then dock with Miku. </br>  <br>Hibiki suplexing the line so it inverts along the X axis, indicating a retroactive increase in hype for past scenes, might do the job.</br>  <br>This scene was weird because I'm pretty sure Miku isn't that short.</br>  <br>Will they form Vivid Geah?</br>  <br>I wonder why CR translate the songs for some series like UtaPri and they don't do it for the others.</br>  <br>Maybe she loses Gungnir and gets D√°insleif instead.</br>  <br><br> reading the song lyrics while watching the fight sequences </br></br>  <br><br>Honestly, I think the first season had the best transformation sequence. It was quick, stylistic and not too intensive, probably only like that because of the limitations of their budget at the time but they didn't break up the action to much. They were like, WHAM BAM ready.<br><br>Season 2 was a cry too far, sort of like StrikerS when you got several transformation sequences in a row and it would just eat time and take you from the moment. Once you get to a certain point it gets distracting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Galaxy Cross. confirmed by Kaneko interview that he said Agematsu tried to named the song title with words GX in it.</br>   Ballistic astronauts <br> Propulsion generators <br> Space surfing <br> Exploding mountains <br> Punching tunnels <br> Mowing the forest </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Licensing costs money.</br>  <br>Wait a minute, are we sure we know what the long, supposedly leg-like protrusion that Berserk Hibiki has in the GX logo actually is?</br>  <br>geahs are literally magic</br>  <br>I wish they'd forced in some abnormal energy readings line around the start.<br> It's coming from... <br> GUNGNIR DATOU?! <br> Suplexes a fucking shuttle with her miracle energy burst. <br>But they had it on screen and he was at least shocked by her again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's okay, Elfnein will fuse Hibiki with D√°insleif to save her life afterwards.</br>  Will there be any berserk Hibiki this season???  So how well did the S1 anime sell?<br>S1 cds?<br><br>S2 anime?<br>S2 cds?<br><br>How much $$$ do they have for the budget this time around?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> yuri left and right <br> spectacular concert <br> that was only the first half </br></br></br>  <br>Too early for Airgetlam I think. If Phara has to win, Tsubasa will just probably JAM protecting Maria and remind Maria of what happened after Serena protected them. Kirika and Shirabe being forbidden to join without drugs seems like a set-up for them to get hurt too along with Hibiki loving the miracle of symphogear.</br>  So what was the reason Hibiki was unable to use the spears? Was it because she only had a fragment of gungnir or was she just not able to figure out how to do it?  <br>More than enough.</br>   CR <br> Commie <br> Zoid <br><br>Add the livestream and whatever raw comes first and i would've watch the show at least five times by the time it ends airing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We're gonna get D√ÅINSLEIF DATO?! instead.</br>  <br>Looks like her boot twisted to more resemble a claw.</br>  <br>About tree fiddy</br>  <br>Read s1 keywords, it's all explained there.</br>   it's legit <br>Fuck.</br>  <br>Conflicted with her personality. She wanted to hold hands with people, which you can't do if you're holding a weapon.</br>  <br> &gt;Mowing the forest <br>Is Miku's really that thick or maybe it's Bikki's? I'm interested because reasons.</br></br>  <br> not watching all of the scenes twice <br> not realizing they are figuratively and/or literally narrating all their fights </br></br>  <br> Another excuse to watch the episode again </br>  <br>Bikki's dad lost his job during the post concerto bullying and left home.</br>  <br>The S1 character CDs were like a million dollars US and I believe S2 were about the same.<br><br>I don't think it's being reinvested, because the staff said S1 and S2 had similar budget and I'd expect this season to be the same.</br></br></br>  <br> releasing the 3rd season when the 2nd season hasn't been officially done by anyone </br>  <br>Come again?</br>  <br>She's in the goddamn logo.</br>  <br> a paragraph on a slide <br>Do these people know how to make a powerpoint presentation?</br></br>  <br>I wonder then if the two slots they have for "New Catalog Titles" are going to be s1 and G.</br>  #symphogear is TT in Japan. Do we know how the nips reacted to the first episode?  <br><br>Was she really bullied? I thought that was all a dream?</br></br>  <br>She didn't burn the thing because she felt bad, it was a bait for the Geahs so they would show up.</br>  <br>Chris-chan cute.</br>  Any rips of this episode's ED yet?  This show makes me question if Aoi Yuuki is sane.  <br>So they use Norse mythology again?<br>Not famous I think.</br></br>  <br>read<br>the<br>keywords</br></br></br>  <br>One of them is Gatchaman.</br>  So, which body part is Biki losing this season? <br>My unpopular vote goes to her Bikis.</br>  I miss Sugita.  <br>Which of them cuts things?

How come this non-sensical low budget crap is so popular on /a/, and actual good shows like Danmachi and SAO aren't?  So who am I supposed to ship Tsubasa with?  <br>Every time.<br><br><br>The Concert Tragedy and the Tachibana Family <br>2 years prior to the start of Symphogear's main story, the specially classified disaster known as the Noise emerged in the middle of a public performance by Zwei Wing. Combining the numbers of spectators and staff, there were over 100,000 people present at the concert hall. The number of deceased or missing totaled 12,874, a terrible disaster. However despite the fact this occurred on such an unparalleled scale, the tragedy does not end there but continued on. <br><br>Of the 12,874 that died approximately 1/3 of them was due to the Noise. The others died as either the result of being crushed by the crowds attempting to flee, or by intense fighting that broke out between attendees trying to secure their escape. This information was published in weekly magazines and quickly set the stage for public opinion. Since the majority of deaths became attributed to other people, the survivors began to experience public bashing. Victims and bereaved families of the deceased also received reparation from the national treasury, and thus the public opinion turned into a harsh debate about one's self-responsibility. Although what had been published and announced in the press was accurate information, a lot of it had been modified to agitate people's emotions, glorifying certain aspects of the story. Using "righteousness" as their guide, many people took to the internet and began to spread their own opinion on the story.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   yfw Hibiki doesn't dodge it   <br>Symphogear threads are just Nana and Aoi samefagging</br>  <br>Everyone. Yes, even that one.</br>  <br>Kiri-chan, your bait is stale.</br>  <br>Ninja dude.</br>  <br>Watch S2 ep1 again and compare it to later episodes. People spend 2-3x budget on the first episode to get people hooked.<br><br>In fact, nearly every episodic show I can think of does this, including countless action-focused anime and american tv shows.</br></br></br>  <br>Everyone</br>  <br>The anime is just not the same without Hibiki and Miku.</br>  <br>It eventually broiled to the point where even those that were uninvolved or uninterested in the event had begun talking about it passionately, as it distracted them from other problems. Thoughtless slander was thrown around, supported by the majority as having "sound reasoning," not because they had deduced this themselves but rather "because everyone else was saying so." At this point the true nature of the tragedy was lost and had turned into something akin to a witch hunt from the middle ages, or the barbaric persecution of Nazis, fueled by some warped sense of "justice." The goodness of people and their ability to become emotionally attached had been twisted and changed into a drive to hunt down the survivors of the tragedy simply for the reason that "because they survived." Of course at this point there was a faction of individuals who held the opposite opinion, but the majority had already made up their minds and the wave of madness swallowed up any opposition. <br><br>Hibiki Tachibana's environment was greatly affected by this. One victim of the tragedy was a boy who attended the same middle school as Hibiki. He was the captain of the soccer team and had a very bright future ahead of himself as a student. Why he had died and Hibiki, who had no redeeming features worth mentioning, had lived was something used to torment her. It all started with a single student, a young girl who had been a fan of the boy, who lashed out at Hibiki yelling in hysterics. It wasn't long before it had consumed the entire school. But that was far from the extent of it.</br></br></br>  <br>Gotta try harder.</br>  <br>It isn't low budget.</br>  <br>Jesusman</br>  <br>Because while Symphogear may not necessarily be a good show, you'll be hard pressed to find anything that's more fun.</br>  <br><br>Chris is her main squeeze, Maria is there to please her on the road when she's lonely.</br></br>  <br> Myself </br>  <br>Dainsleif doesn't appear to be an intact relic given how small the box is, so...<br><br><br>That was just because the Vivid system was ultimately designed for gattai, so they didn't put too much effort into making the base outfits fancy.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Me</br>  <br>The daughter of the president of a company that Hibiki's father did business with was also among the list of the deceased. At first her father was incredibly overjoyed that Hibiki had survived the ordeal, but it wasn't long before the news spread around and he found that his contract with the company had been rejected and was removed from the project. Having lost his sense of pride and unable to figure out how to cope with the situation, her father turned to alcohol which eventually led to yelling and even violence within the household. Originally her father had married into her mother's family, taking on her name, but one day on his way to work he intentionally went missing, abandoning the family altogether and never returned to the house again. <br><br>Be it at school or at home, Hibiki took on an immense amount of unreasonable torment and harassment. The young girl who puts all her efforts into helping others, is also a girl with a past that had been trampled on by those same people. <br><br>The darkness in people's hearts, born of a mutual misunderstanding. Having been exposed to this darkness more than most, Hibiki is still capable of believing in others. Surely this is because she knows that in the space between 2 people, there exists sunlight.</br></br></br></br></br>  It just won't be the same without SUBS WHEN.  <br>Yes but the overall budget should be higher since the animation/quality in the first ep is significantly higher than S2's premiere</br>  I fucking love this shit.<br><br>I hope the rest of the show keeps it up.</br></br>  <br>Where's GX?</br>  <br><br> responding to bait that shitty <br>Sure is summer~</br></br></br>  <br>Everyone that isn't Hibiki/Miku/Shirabe/Kirika/Genjuuro<wbr><br><br> That includes Ogawa </br></br></wbr></br>  <br>The only other sword on the cast.</br>  <br>Our hype has gone 3D</br>  <br> It just won't be the same without SUBS WHEN. <br>We actually had one of those threads.

Totally homo.</br>  <br>I feel like the fairy will return in some way sooner or later.<br> I also love you by the way. </br></br>  A surprising number of the entries at YuYuYu have this pairing in their samples.  This is the cutest Gyuuki Gyuuna but they probably can never use it as it looks too much like a certain Symphogear outfit.      <br>What are your guesses as to what happens now?  Threesome in nurses office </br>  Yuuna has become the Leo!  I want to fuck Yuuna.  ded  Anyone else in line for the panel?  <br>Bigger line than I expected</br>  Who else at anime expo? I snagged the only Yuuna Daki.  <br><br>The weird thing is that I was close to where I was yesterday for the Euphonium panel and just got in before the room hit capacity, but today the room was half empty.

So many great new pics.<br><br><br><br>I wish I was, even if only for YuYuYu.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like the same group from Sakura Con.<br>Karin's got... at least some semblance of the gauntlets now.</br></br>  <br>Yeah that's what I mean, I recognized them from Sakura Con.</br>  if anyone gives a shit, Togo sounds like she's voiced by Cristina Vee.

I suck cocks. They all sound the same though</br></br>  <br>Yeah, we learned the cast already at Sakura Con.<br>It still kind of blows my mind how fast YuYuYu got dubbed despite its relative lack of popularity. Volumes 1 and 2 were dubbed before Volume 5 came out in Japan.</br></br>  I am sitting in my home with a fan and I am almost dead aren't you guys melting at the Anime expo?  <br><br>The screening rooms are pretty well-ventilated. It's the hallways/exhibit hall that are clusterfucks</br></br>  <br>I want to fuck Yuuna too</br>  <br>How do who dubs things decide what things to dub?</br>  Now that it has ended what does /a/ think of this? I thought that it was a pretty decent adaptation of the manga.  Animation was fun to look at and story was too stupid for me to take seriously or get disappointed with. Entertaining last two episodes too. <br>Looking forward to second season and it is AOTS</br>  <br>It was solid I think. It got kinda stupid at times but I can overlook that. Probably cause of pic related.</br>  Piano fag here. I'm bored so I'll post a song, if you guess right I'll pick up a request. <br><br>After the request, I'll do the same thing all over.<br><br> not the best audio but it's ok, also it's a elecpiano <br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s08CutNfzewE</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> http://vocaroo.com/i/s08CutNfzewE <br>anaconda by niki minaj?</br></br>  I dont know but play the op from your lie in april please senpai.

Is it hard to play?  What the fuck happened?   Hey! These Orcs drawn 25 years ago looks different than Orcs drawn today! <br><br>turns into<br> WHY AM I SO SHORT?! WHY GOD?! WHY?! <br><br>In less than 30 posts</br></br></br></br></br>  I thought japanese orcs were always pigmen while wester orcs were bulky and green  <br>You better praise the Lord every day if you are not a manlet. I had to lift hardcore for 4 years until other people started taking me seriously.</br>   FOOOOOORTH EORLINGAAAAAS   Will there be brown elves?<br>This is very important.</br>  Soon  <br>I wonder Uta will say to Haise</br>  <br>Why is there no dialogue?</br>  Why does Ishida tease us with cliffhangers  <br> being this retard. </br>  It seems Ishida is going to make a daily calendar for 2016.  <br>Do you guys think will get an awesome fight scene with Haise vs Uta or will it simply skip to three weeks from now and Haise will just make some comment of "So it turns out the mask was made for Kaneki" and just let us all down?</br>  <br>I doubt he will fight clowns yet</br>  <br> Do you guys think will get an awesome fight scene with Haise vs Uta <br>never, but it's really odd that Uta shows him his ghoul eye right away. He probably bets on Haise knowing about kaneki having ghouls friends and hopes that Haise thinks that Uta is an old friend of his.</br></br>  <br>So the art in :re is going to get worse?</br>  <br> Do you guys think will get an awesome fight scene with Haise vs Uta <br>No, the chances that Haise and Uta are going to fight are nil, but they're going to have an intriguing conversation.<br> Also, get out shounen fag. </br></br></br>  <br>Not much of that white hair left.</br>  <br>Something something tragedy something unpopular</br>  <br>Not necessarily. I think Ishida is quite capable of handling simultaneous tasks while keeping up the quality.</br>   Faggyama arc is progressing at a rabbit pace <br>Based Ishida, he knows that I want this arc to be over with. <br>So is Kanae get rekt by CCG or not? <br><br><br>I'm excited to see next chapter.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Never, Uta doesn't like to fight.</br>  <br>Really? To me it seems that he's enjoying fights. It's just that he doesn't really care about winning a fight, it's rather playing around for him.</br>  <br>He doesn't always start a fight. He used to yeah but not now. Next chapter will be talking.</br>  <br><br>Torture scene for Haise when?<br><br>It's coming right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if Haise is going to immediately identify Uta as a ghoul, or if Haise is going to think Uta is wearing contact lenses or is one of those people that inject ink into their corneas to make their sclera look black.</br>  <br><br>Uta is probably an extremely powerful kakuja, fights for him are a nuisance, unless it's with someone he like to play with like Yomo or Hirako.</br></br>  <br>nothing will happen</br>  <br>Haise comes to the shop with the knowledge of the owner is making masks for ghouls. He is also aware of friendly ghouls like Hinami or Donato, I don't see why he should consider Uta as not being a ghoul. <br>He is a freaking ghoul investigator.</br></br>  <br>If anyone's getting a torture scene, I'd bet you it's one of the Qs other than Haise.</br>  <br>Which one of the Qs would it be though?</br>  <br> Next chapter will be talking. <br>Yeah, I know. It's obvious that Uta and Haise aren't going to fight, I was just talking about his attitude regarding fights in general.</br></br>  <br>This.<br>Ishida probably skip everything again and in chapter 36 we'll see Haise doing boring CCG stuff.</br></br>  <br>it will be same as it was with touka</br>  <br><br>That's bullshit I can believe in.</br></br>  <br> I think Ishida is quite capable of handling simultaneous tasks while keeping up the quality. <br>Friendly remainder that chapter 16's art sucked so much because Ishida was making the anime ED cards.</br></br>  <br> Based Ishida, he knows that I want this arc to be over with.  <br> So is Kanae get rekt by CCG or not? <br>I'm surprised as well, if homo prince and his fanboy got BTFO by CCG, then this arc's purpose was just to get rip off of them?<br>Based Ishida.</br></br></br></br>  <br> nothing will happen <br>SoL talk and then Uta saying: yeah he is the same. Now to work.</br></br>  <br>So what? He's always improving the art for the volumes and that's what actually counts.</br>  <br> Which one of the Qs would it be though? <br>Just one?</br></br>  <br>I'd say Saiko or Urie, but I actually doubt that there's going to be a torture scene with one of the Q's.</br>  <br> He's always improving the art for the volumes and that's what actually counts. <br>The errors are still there, and by errors I mean the weird hands, the photos backgrounds, the weird faces.<br>Chapter 31 was full of weird tiny faces. <br>I want Ishida to take things slowly, he said in his tumblr that he cried out of stress while he was doing the anime ED.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Trap is a good candidate, as her meet with Torso is inevitable. I don't think the violence will be very brutal, more like a little sexual violence.</br>  <br> Mutsuki gets tortured <br> he gets a new personality <br> he becomes almost as strong as Shironeki <br> Mutsuki and Urie become the strongest investigator couple <br><br><br>Yeah, Ishida is loaded with work, he needs a little break.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he <br>kek</br></br>  <br>I feel bullied, anon-kun is trying to bait me. Now who can save me?<br> Well, it seems it¬¥s time to leave this threads and return tomorrow </br></br>  <br>*she</br>  <br>I agree he shouldn't rush things and take his time. I don't want him to get a stress induced sickness.</br>  <br><br><br>I forgot, sorry. I usually use "she" because I know using the masculine pronoun would trigger other anons.</br></br></br>  http://tieba.baidu.com/p/3871711701<wbr>?fr=frs</wbr>  <br>he will do the hxh</br>  <br>No, please.</br>  <br> hxh <br>Ishida admires HxH's author, don't call the devil.</br></br>  so what does he say?  <br>He worked for Togashi as assistant.</br>  <br>Let me eat your dick</br>  <br>Chink anon where?</br>  <br>can I suck your Eyeballs</br>   banging his head in the tree <br>What a fucking dramatic faggot.</br>  <br>I don't understand japanese but I bet they're saying something like<br> Is this the HySy Art Studio? <br> Oh, a new customer... </br></br></br>  Does a ghouls dick grow back when its cut?  <br>If the ghoul isn't a jobber, then yes.</br>  <br>Yes, that's also why Big Madam could never be a true madam and forced her ideal vision of herself onto Suzuya.</br>  <br><br>He just says good evening and ask if the shop is still open. <br>Uta: "... yeah it's still open"</br></br></br>  <br>I'm hyped for chapter 36.</br>  <br> I'm hyped for chapter 36 <br>It is going to be like chapter 31, nothing happens in the end.</br></br>  I think the best explanation for Uta's constant kakugan is that it's supposed to be an eye tattoo, which isn't very exciting, honestly<br><br>I hope Haise still confronts him about it, I just want something interesting to happen...</br></br>  <br>An interesting thing about Uta's Kakugan is that he doesn't have the veins arround his eyes that other ghouls have.</br>  <br>Oh he has too high RC that he can't shut it off. Ishida will explain it later. <br><br><br>He does.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it doesn't bother me too much<br>I just meant that saying "oh this? just an eye tattoo" is the perfect cover-up and that sucks</br></br>  I guess I can call Faggyama Torsoyama now.  <br>Nah, he doesn't tattoo it. I'm sure. Way before he had tattoo, his eyes were always on constant kakugan state.</br>  <br>Okay so I think that Haise is going to talk to Uta and to other ghoul about the person he used to be aka Kaneki Ken.<br><br>And, I think the time for Haise is up now.<br><br> Kaneki and the caterpillar fungus comparaison. <br> Arima becoming suspiscious of Haise after the Auction raid and sending Ihei to watch him over  <br> Since Haise is going to try to learn more about his past, he will probably interact more with Ghoul. <br> The CCG won't allow this. <br> Hinami in prison and Akira is losing patience. <br><br>With this much going on, I don't think he can keep up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>holy shit dude, really?<br><br>I meant that he could easily fucking lie about his kakugan being an eye tattoo, given that he looks exactly like a bodymod freak</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck do you find so good about this manga?</br>  On the other hand...<br><br> Haise knows that Kaneki had many ghoul friends <br> Haise gets a mask from Kaneki's friends <br> Haise walks into the shop and instantly sees a guy with a kakugan <br><br>I don't think even Haise could be retarded enough to be fooled in a situation like this</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but Uta send him the mask right ?<br><br>And well, Haise is not stupid , he probably already figured out that this mask was the mask that Kaneki used to wear.</br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't lie. There are many occasions that he needs to shut it down but he never does so.<br> Going to human market with Tsumugi and Asa  <br> Stay in front of hospital gate <br> Walk to Anteiku <br> Meet Tsumugi <br> etc <br>When he was young and he fought Yomo in front of the public, he had to wear sunglasses and he had a whole collection of it. It was shown in the omake.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He does. <br>I never saw an illustration of Uta that showed him having veins arround his eyes. Also your pic doesn't show him with them.</br></br>  <br>Lower panel, look into the eye retard.</br>  <br> Okay so I think that Haise is going to talk to Uta and to other ghoul about the person he used to be aka Kaneki Ken <br>To be honest I don't think Haise is going to ask explicitly about Kaneki, maybe Uta is going to toy with him, because it will be bloody stupid for Uta to literately say: oh, yeah, I knew that man and I made the mask for him, When it could arise suspicions about him. <br>Haise is a pussy, but still.<br> I don't think he can keep up <br>Haise becomes ash when Amon appears. As he is the final key to Kaneki's return.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> When it could arise suspicions about him.  <br>What suspicions?<br><br> he is the final key to Kaneki's return. <br>Amon is ONE of the keys, not the FINAL key.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then why isn't he going full CCG on Uta?</br>  <br>Haise is not the type that kill ghouls he sees on the spot unlike Arima.</br>  <br>I meant throwing him into Cocklea but okay</br>  <br>*like</br>  <br>Yeah Amon is one of the key to Kaneki's return but, I just think that the time for Kaneki to come back is very near.<br>Like, I think that it is at this volume that Kaneki will come back.<br><br><br>Because he want answer and, since Kaneki was not the type to be a monster, Haise probably believe that Uta is the same.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What suspicions? <br>That he is a ghoul, I mean if I were a criminal that is visited by a police to ask about another criminal, I would be very cautious about what I say.<br> Amon is ONE of the keys, not the FINAL key. <br>He is the final key. He was the first key to be mentioned, but he will be last and final one. Typical Ishida writing.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Haise is not the type that kill ghouls he sees on the spot unlike Arima <br>He can take him to ghoul prison, like the taxi driver.</br></br>  Anime &gt;&gt;&gt; Manga  <br> since Kaneki was not the type to be a monster, Haise probably believe that Uta is the same. <br>How fucking naiv√©, given that even Kaneki knew fuck-all about the clowns<br><br>next chapter is gonna be delicious</br></br></br></br>  <br>I forgot to add...<br>I think that because , it seem that all the hints to come back are here.<br> Kaneki's caterpillar fungus comparaison. <br> CCG and Arima being suspicious of Kaneki <br> Hinami in prison. <br> Akira losing patience. <br><br>I think that it's all going to explose, Haise's life is going to be destroyed and THEN Amon will appear to help him.<br><br><br> How fucking naiv√© <br><br>Yeah, that's very naive of me to think that...<br>But Haise is also naive.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kaneki knew fuck-all about the clowns <br>Kaneki doesn't know that Uta/Itori/Roma nor Nico are clowns. He only knows about Souta.</br></br>  <br>yeah that's what I meant</br>  <br> I think that it's all going to explose, Haise's life is going to be destroyed and THEN Amon will appear to help him. <br>Fuck, anon, that's delicious. I wish you are fight.</br></br>  <br>If the conversation between Uta and RE was right he always was a friend despite being a clown.</br>    <br> yeah that's what I meant <br>Sorry, then.</br></br>  <br>He wins if you reply.</br>  <br> But Haise is also naive. <br>In one hand the correct way to act is to be cautious when a ghoul investigator is at your door, in the other if Uta talks about Kaneki, hinting that he is also a ghoul, but Haise doesn't notice anything, then he will be a bigger pussy and retarded.</br></br>  <br>Amon is the chosen one along with Kaneki their tragedy will wash all others away. <br><br>Of course he is the final key.</br></br></br>  Man, if Haise is here to stay, then Kaneki died the death of a true tragic hero<br><br> didn't get strong enough <br> couldn't save anybody <br> ate his best friend <br> died ignorant to the fact that Uta and the others were just fucking with him all along </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaneki's tragedy is to keep suffering like Roma and I want. Pic related, see the face of a happy man-child.</br>  <br>Thats my theory aswell. Kaneki Tulpa will use the fight between fagyama and himself to try and sieze control. He will activate his half kakuja eat fagyama for bonus points and then escape. Amon will then track down Beserk kaneki and they will have their final "talk" before Kaneki gets his full memory back wnd teams with Amon.</br>  <br> He is the final key. He was the first key to be mentioned, but he will be last and final one. Typical Ishida writing. <br><br>We're not getting Amon back till chapter 100, are we? Our suffering is worse than Hirako's.</br></br></br>  <br> We're not getting Amon back till chapter 100, are we? <br>No, chapter 60-70 to parallelism.</br></br>  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet<wbr>s/d/17Zwq2_njezILPbhozSwR-Fq-c1iXeR<wbr>ckRj9H3MyBrVw/pubhtml<br>Wow, IS are fast this week.</br></wbr></wbr>  <br> criminal <br>He doesn't know No Face identity, he just knows the shop owner one. It is not like Haise will kill any of Kaneki's friend on sight.</br></br>  <br> YOU WANT AMON?! TOO BAD! HERE FAGYAMA! FUCK U! </br>  <br>They are the same entity.<br><br><br>This is what Amonfag actually believes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do IS put fuck Touka on the chapters for?</br>  <br> He doesn't know No Face identity, he just knows the shop owner one. <br>Kaneki was a ghoul, ghouls use mask, Kaneki's friends were ghouls. Haise doesn't kill ghouls but he sends them to prison.<br>Anon, do you have autism?</br></br></br>  <br>To have fun.</br>  <br>Cause fat landwhales are into yaoi.</br>  <br> They are the same entity. <br>i'm aware that this is what Ishida is trying to push<br><br>but a person without memories just isn't the same person, I'm sorry</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon I believe you are smarter than that.</br>  <br> They are the same entity <br>They are two personalities created by the trauma of getting skull raped. Science approves of this. <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnes<wbr>ia<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deper<wbr>sonalization<br>I know the exact name for this, but I don't remember it in this moment.</br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Because they actually don't want Kaneki to fuck Touka because as the anon above stated they are fujos.</br>  <br>They are still the same person anon. Do you actually think Haise will remain amnesiac till the end of this manga?</br>  <br>Anon, I'm not going to discuss the obvious because I don't want to makes this a shitstorm.</br>  <br><br>so we let fujos translate Tokyo ghoul kek</br></br>  <br> They are still the same person anon. <br>No, two personalities that have the same core, but aren't the same entity. <br>Personality disorder.</br></br></br>  <br>Haise never meets No Face. Haise never investigate about it. Haise never hears about him.<br>Haise only knows Uta as show owner selling ghoul masks and also a ghoul. <br>Then how the fuck does he knows Uta is No Face?</br></br></br>  <br>Do you think he will remain amnesiac?!</br>  <br> Do you actually think Haise will remain amnesiac till the end of this manga? <br>Why not?<br><br>Ishida already put us in an almost CCG-exclusive perspective</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have any other translator that is ready to start a drama war with them?</br>  <br>Will you eat your post if he remains like that after chapter 70? It is obvious Ishida is going with the parallel here.</br>  <br> Ishida is going with the parallel here. <br>You mean Amon and Kaneki being essentially inverted?<br><br>Like Amon will provide us with the ghoul perspective as soon as they meet?<br>I'd like that<br><br>but that's not gonna fucking happen, I have zero faith in Ishida</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Then how the fuck does he knows Uta is No Face? <br>If someone is a ghoul+if someone is a ghoul investigator= the ghoul investigator is obligated to kill/arrest him.<br>I don't know where are you bring the whole No Face.<br>If Haise notice Uta is a ghoul, he will be obligated to arrest him. That's what is I was saying.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually I heard there was some professional translators who translate Tokyo ghoul so far</br>  <br>Niggastream.</br>  <br><br> I don't think even Haise could be retarded enough <br> Haise is not stupid <br>When it's about Kaneki or his ghoul side/past, he is dumb as fuck. Haise is only good for searching info about your average ghoul. <br><br><br>Indeed. But I guess Ishida will immediately start Rosewald raid and we will see this conversation in flashbacks</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> be obligated to arrest him <br> whoo hoo, I'm gonna find my identity by asking a shop owner and also a ghoul ans then arrest him right away even when he used to be my friend <br> all ghouls go to prison even when they are my friend <br>What a retarded logic for Haise. Did you see how he was hesitating in Hinami's case?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good lock convincing them to start a drama war with IS cause a drama is going to start and batotofags plus tubmletards are going to start shitting on niggastream.</br>  <br> What a retarded logic for Haise <br>Haise is learning well from Autisma's autism.</br></br>  When will we get a nigga ghoul  <br>He learned shit. All he did was to pose lile Arima but he couldn't strike the same. It is like China copying Japan model but the quality is shit tier.</br>  Her eyes are way too far apart. Fix it please, Ishida.  <br>That's a nice looking quinque.</br>  <br>No, I don't believe that.<br><br>You see, Haise is currently doing the exact same mistake that Kaneki was doing :<br><br>He's trying to save everyone, all the while trying to keep the family that he has in the CCG.<br><br>But, the readers (us) and Kaneki, know that it is simply not possible, you can't save everyone.<br><br>Like, when Yamori had gave him a choice between a child and a parent.<br>He didn't choose, so both died.<br><br>He then though that , if he get stronger, he could protect everyone without having to sacrifice someone else, but he sacrificed his sanity and, because of all that, he failed.<br><br>At the end of the manga, he understood the lesson.<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127581453#p127589409">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The thing he was not able to do in the original manga.<br><br>Either he sacrifice his "ghoul friend" and continue to pretend to "be happy"<br>Or he sacrifice the family that he made at the CCG to find the truth.<br><br>Since this is "Kaneki's second chance to make the right choices" It's very probable that Haise will choose the second choice.<br>And, when he'll be broken, when he will be in despair, it's only then that Amon will appear and he will help him and Kaneki will be hopeful once again.<br><br>It fit with the star as well.<br> Star Tarot Story <br>On the bleak landscape where the Tower stood, the Fool sits, empty, despairing. He hoped to find direction on this spiritual journey, a path to his spiritual self, but having just learned that most of his life was a lie, he now feels lost. Sitting on the cold stones, he gazes up at the night sky wishing for some kind of guide. And that is when he notices, nearby, a beautiful girl with two water urns. As he watches, she kneels by a pool of water illuminated with reflected starlight. She empties the urns, one into the pool, one onto the thirsty ground.<br> "Like possible futures," agrees the girl. "Cool and distant. Yet if you keep one in sight, it can guide you to your destination no matter how far away it is." Even as she says this, she began to fade away, like dew, vanishing. All that remains is a gleam that was at the center of her forehead. This rises up and up, until it settles in the night sky as a shining star. "Follow your star," the woman's voice seems to sing from that light, "and have hope." <br> The Fool takes in a breath and rises. It is a dark night, a desolate land. But for the first time, he has a guiding light to show him the way. Distant as it is, it restores his faith. <br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127581453#p127589594">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It almost looks like she has a kagune  The show is shitty fapbait and the MC is such a little bitch.<br><br>So why can't I stop watching?</br></br>  Because your taste is fucking horrible.

Tanaka isn't ready to reveal that Abyssal's true form yet. I personally believe in sunk Kanmusu theory, but even though I can say I can care less, Allied theorists with do anything to win this autism battle, so I rather that KDKW don't. For now.</br>  <br>Then include Allied girls first, both RN and USN.</br>  <br>That's probably only way, but like I said above, Tanaka isn't ready</br>  <br>That's why I said wait a few years. But then again the devs are insanely slow so maybe it'll be a few decades.</br>    <br>Not only because of that, E2 had CARNIVAL DAYO or KIRISHIMA in preboss nodes while E3's route was a cakewalk.</br>  <br> allied girls <br><br>Like Germany and Italy?</br></br></br>    <br>Allied as in Manhattan project-chan.</br>  <br>They are going to have to do something, since they are running dry on the Pacific war material.
