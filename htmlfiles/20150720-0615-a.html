He even had time to wonder if they were building a new underground mall while they were at it. <br><br> There was a lot he wanted to say, but he only spoke the first phrase that came to mind. <br><br> “Misaaaaka.” <br><br> “B-blame the map!!”  <br>This whole thing feels like some crazy cartoon chase and I fucking love it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  She will win right? She just have to close the gap right?  <br> B-Blame the map!! <br>I swear I've heard this phrase in another show from this season.<br><br><br>Fuck off with your reverse trolling.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She'd have to fucking confess first, and we all know NO ONE in this series has the guts for that. No one will win because every fucking heroine is a fucking coward.<br><br>I don't root for losers who don't even fucking try. She should just cry in a corner somewhere. If she actually grows a spine, maybe I'll reconsider her worth.</br></br></br>  <br>The mummy was to good for this world.</br>  <br> She'd have to fucking confess first, and we all know NO ONE in this series has the guts for that. <br><br>Index</br></br></br>  <br>She has no guts to confess AGAIN.</br>  <br>She already confessed in NT2 and NT3. But Touma too dumb to understand it.</br>  <br>She did it once she can do it again. Index is no coward like Misaka, Index will win the Toumabowl or Othinus will. We all know that for sure.<br><br><br>She never confessed she wanted to share Touma's burden which is ironic since she became the burden.</br></br></br></br>  <br> which is ironic since she became the burden <br>Nice meme!</br></br>  <br>she literally just said it herself.<br><br><br>its not even a meme<br>its the truth she realize</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> she literally just said it herself. <br>"I’m just a high school student!” (c) Kamijou Touma<br>Something like 0/8</br></br></br>  <br> fiamma fucking failed against HP hard <br> touma and misaka are gunning for an open space to deal with this shit <br> they both just rode into a giant chasm <br>well their lives collectively suck right now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Now if only that development would stick with Misaka and not be shrugged off next volume like with what happened with NT3. Instead of following up on sharing the burden, she was saying on what a good woman should be like in NT6 which that development was shrugged off and thrown out next volume. Hell I believed it happened in the same volume cant recall what happened after. <br><br>In fact, what happened with the rings Misaka bought? Pretty sure that they never came up again or even mentioned. I guess its just the golden rule for kamachi to have her character forget any type of development. <br><br>How about some more index? Starting to really miss her be part of the story.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This volume references Aleister's dead daughter, pretty soon they'll reveal Index as her clone. :^)</br>  <br>Don't disappoint me, anon.</br>  <br> yfw Aleister and Laura's daughter looked like Index <br> yfw she dies thanks to magic god shenanigans <br> yfw Aleister turns his back in magic angering Laura <br> yfw not only did she have the Anglican Church hunt him down she preserves their daughter's DNA <br> yfw Laura experiments on creating the perfect clone of their daughter out of spite towards Aleister, continuing this she has her suffer with the inputting of the grimoires and yearly memory erasures because she despises her for her appearance <br> yfw she later releases Index in Academy City as a mocking gesture to Aleister, whom she believes may be the Aleister she once new and love <br> yfw Laura gets her own pawn within Kamisato Kakeru as a counter to Aleister's pawn within Kamijou Touma <br> yfw Raildex's plot originated from a couple who didn't go to marriage counselling </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   “Ah, wait!! It’s dangerous here, so please don’t run! Oh, honestly. If I could see, I could at least teleport over, and…Uiharu! Is the power still not back up!?” <br>But Kuroko is DED.</br>  <br> what happened with the rings Misaka bought? <br>Holy shit, I've completely forgotten about those. What DID happen to those rings? We're never going to see them again, are we?</br></br>  <br>if thats the case laura is a spiteful cunt and seriously needs to get her shit wrecked.</br>  <br> “Misaka, can I make one – just one – incredibly selfish request?” <br><br> “What is it?” <br><br> She urged him on even though she was pretty sure she knew what it was. <br><br> The boy gave the exact answer she had been expecting. <br><br> “I want to save that girl right this instant.” <br><br> She smiled without meaning to. <br><br> It came out of nowhere. He was ignoring their current predicament. The fear of the High Priest had to have permeated his very being, but he still looked away from the approaching mummy. <br><br> However, Mikoto did not need to analyze why she was smiling. <br><br> She simply gathered strength in the arms wrapped around his waist and gave her answer. <br><br> “Don’t worry. I would’ve had to punch you if you hadn’t said that.” <br><br> Nothing more was needed. They did not even need to discuss what they would do.  <br><br>The best.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She simply gathered strength in the arms wrapped around his waist and gave her answer. <br>Very cute. But somehow people will find a way to complain/shitpost about this.</br></br>  Isn't this pretty much the first time Touma and Mikoto have stuck together for an entire volume?  <br>Yes. Unfortunately, it also means that next time we get a Touma-Mikoto team up it will be in NT23. Fruit cola.</br>  <br>Wait js06.exe already finished chapter 2?</br>  <br>yup, and we are mostly through part 3.<br>robots work stupid fast mind you.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, js06 is amazing.</br>    <br>Yeah, and this volume seems pretty fast paced if you discount the misadventures of whatsherface and the liquid diamond.</br>  <br>Laura is probably his other daughter Lola Zaza, and not his lover.</br>  <br> This whole thing feels like some crazy cartoon chase and I fucking love it. <br><br>The next picture thread, someone needs to request Touma and Misaka as Road Runner and High Preist as Wile E. Coyote</br></br></br>  <br> yfw Raildex's plot is just a daughter acting out because daddy has a new daughter </br>  Wow Fiamma jobbed hard.   “Uho hoi”  <br><br>I love this priest.</br></br>   What happened in that instant was extremely simple. <br><br> An acrobike running at full speed collided with the college student holding the liquid diamond’s storage tube. <br><br> It may have been a light bicycle, but it was still moving at over sixty kph. <br><br> The front wheel dug into Kenzan’s side and he really did bend into a shallow V shape. <br><br>Man I'm really liking Touma this volume. Also using High Priest so that he could indirectly save Mie</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What was even the point of bringing Fiamma, only for him to job and to never get mentionned again?  <br>Comedy.</br>  <br>I'd imagine he'll show up again before the end.<br><br>As things currently stand, he's pretty much the only one on Touma's side who's even remotely capable of standing up to a Magic God. The fact that he can't win against one more or less means that no one can. Even Ollerus is shit tier now, thanks to that Fairy Spell.</br></br></br>  <br>fiamma thought he was hot shit for landing a lucky shot on othinus, so this was to cut down his ego some.</br>  <br>Fiamma's ego isn't entirely misplaced. If he can't beat someone, then most likely very few others can. Even nerfed, he's still one of the most powerful characters in the series, barring Magic Gods and Aleister. He's certainly the strongest one on Touma's side.</br>  <br>The new Stiyl</br>  <br>Not like it's the first time a character jobbed like a bitch the moment they got on the protag side.</br>  <br> defeated by a magic god <br> jobbed </br></br>  <br> guts <br>ToumaxGunha Confirmed.</br></br>  Wish this whole chase scene was animated.  <br> animation outsourced to Warner Bros. </br>  <br>  NO ONE in this series has the guts for that. <br>Challenge accepted</br></br>  Thought this volume was gonna be shit but it's actually pretty good so far.   yfw Touma using lethal methods <br> endangered those punks by putting them in High Priest's path <br> Misaka is totally okay with this <br><br>Misaka following Touma even unto his fall confirmed?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mikoto never really cared about thugs, she's been frying them since before she met Touma.</br>  <br><br>She's so callous toward harming thugs that Touma tries to save the thugs when he sees thugs near her.</br></br>  <br> Touma saved the thugs by putting them in High Priest's way instead of Mikoto taking care of them </br>  <br>Looks like someone made a wrong turn.</br>   But he was not the only person who had gotten her heart worked up. <br> There was another. <br><br>Who is it /a/?</br></br></br>  <br>I think you're taking this shit too seriously. Kamachi is trying to have fun with this.</br>   Fiamma got trashed that quickly   <br>Fiamma?</br>  At this point I just cheers for Fiamma trying to be relevant and on Touma side. Can respect him for this.   Chapter 3, part 3 <br><br>Is this like, the worst NT volume by far?</br></br>  <br> the worst NT volume by far? <br>Gr8 b8.<br>Better than 1, 2, 7, 11, 12.</br></br></br>  <br>Not when NT 1 and NT 12 exist.</br>  <br>That's not NT10.</br>  <br>NT10 was most based volume in entire Raildex.</br>   “Ho ho. Are you youngsters having an intimate discussion on methods of murder?”  <br><br>Magic gods was the best thing that happened to this novel. First came NT9 and now we got this. Shame they will go away.</br></br>  <br>It's shit m8.</br>  <br>  not liking boss rush <br>  being against trip to denmark </br></br>  <br><br>SUFFERING HYPE</br></br>  <br> They had used the word “god” so lightly and irreverently, but there had also been no salvation in the fairy spell.  <br> That was true whether it had made Othinus powerless as planned or if it had instead destroyed her body’s structure from within. <br><br>I love him being arrogant christian Touma.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Every Touma villain is Touma</br>  <br> Liking terrible boss rushes  <br> Liking Touma's bs win against Thor <br> Liking that cringe worthy fight with touma and misaka  <br> Liking that shitty ending </br></br></br></br>  Why haven't they sent out the dog yet?  <br>Entire series is terrible boss rush anon</br>   She pressed her face into his back and seemed to groan. <br>Touma smells good?</br>  <br>Aleister amused by chase and secretly toumikoto shipper.</br>  Misaka is pretty strong i guess.  <br>She is saint level, remember?</br>    I wonder if Touma's ever going to tell Biri that the guy in red they just saw get rekt was the one behind World War III.  Anyone got a good representation/illustration of the wind tunnel thing Misaka did on high Priest? Can't imagine it.    <br>He won't, only we readers will know.</br>  <br>Saints are pretty shit.</br>  <br>And tell him that the person who ended the world over a billion times is living inside of a dollhouse at his place?<br>...Did he actually ever get that dollhouse?</br></br>  <br>Well, look where we at now with magic gods. it's not that weird that saints aren't that big of a deal anymore.</br>  <br>Magic god is the new hotness</br>  <br>  this is my friend Adolf Hitler he is gonna to help us to find final solution of our problem </br>  <br>I get it now. So High Priest is the projectile and the magnets were the arms. Pretty smart move.</br>  <br>Magic gods are already old and busted<br>World Rejector is the new hotness.</br></br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br><br>But they're even worse.</br></br>  Accel would have been a better helper.  <br> accel <br> help <br>top.kek</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but the banter wouldn't be as good.</br>  Has he fucked her yet?  <br> who is this old guy trying to kill my Touma <br> tries to reflect his giant arms and gets send flying <br><br>GUTS would be a better helper.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Golden winged accel when?</br>  <br> GUTS would be a better helper <br><br> Implying he wouldn't end up like this after getting smacked like a bitch </br></br></br>  <br> implying that'll stop him from getting up </br>  <br> tries to reflect his giant arms but they end up broken instead  <br><br>Fixed.</br></br></br>  <br> being this new </br>    <br>Is this from accel or railgun manga?</br>  <br>Delusional as usual</br>  <br><br>The fact you can't tell the difference is kind of fascinating.</br></br>  <br>I haven't even read both yet.</br>  <br>Eh. They have reason to celebrate. After all these years Misaka is finally strong enough to beat Styl in a fight.</br>  <br><br>After these many years of Raildex, you can't notice it from the postings of the manga here?</br></br>  <br> Implying Styll is weak </br>  <br><br>Another flame magician cut his flame sword. How the fuck is that possible.</br></br>  <br>There's no wind tunnel. The palms just created a vacuum and sucked all the air in. You can try this by pressing your own palms together. Notice the suction effect when you try to separate them. Now amplify that by a few orders of magnitude.</br>  <br> Reading this for the fights <br> Being underaged </br></br>  <br>Magic.</br>  <br>It wasn't cut. It was burned. Fire burning fire.</br>  <br>Accel confirmed above magic god tier</br>  <br>Someone should make touma snap already.<br><br><br>I want to see him use all those lethal tactics on a person.</br></br></br></br>  <br> He doesn't read this for the magic/esper battles </br>  <br>Its actually really fuckin impressive what PTSD Touma can do to kill a person. It wasnt just one or two Lethal tactics, he even went through a though-process on how he would act if it was a saint chasing him. NT9 May have given him PTSD, but he is now a Master Tactician Touman.</br>  <br> yfw NT9 was a hidden training arc </br>  <br><br>Poor man.</br></br>  <br/>  <br> tries to reflect his giant arms and gets send flying <br>Is not like that stopped him against Misha or Aiwass<br>Accel, Kakine and Gunha are probably the only 5s who could take a lethal blow like that and get up to keep fighting</br></br></br>  <br>I thought he slightly mentioned her to Mikoto but she wasn't really paying attention to that just the thought of him calling another girl on her phone.</br>  <br>Even normal highschool boys have their own tricks in their sleeves</br>  How is the bike not broken already?  <br>Dude gunhas Body is like shizuo.<br>I heard that accel blood reversel just caused a minor headache.<br>Then accel compered shizuo with the data of Number 7</br></br></br>  <br>How come Touma's jacket survived his descent on the elevator cables in NT12?<br>Science.</br></br>  <br>Its just a "Normal Highschool Jacket +15 [Legendary]" that anyone has anon.</br>  <br> Glorious nippon bike, folded over a thousand times <br> Breaking </br></br>  <br>Man, Touma is reckless as fuck now due to experiences and even before nt9 happen he is brutal if we judge how Enshuu beat the fuck down Biyouri when she channeled the touman or the fact that he almost strangle to death Aurelous dummy or that poor fucker on the plane<br><br><br>Now imagine him losing his shit on a person now that He have many fucking lethal tricks that he experience himself. and use it to beat the fuck out of someone.</br></br></br></br>  Who is the shinji of index?  <br>Misaka didn't get stronger. She was always strong. Kamachi just never lets her do anything to prove it. Nothing she's done in NT has come even close to the sheer destructive output she used on AIM Burst way back in 2007. Stiyl would piss his pants.</br>  Season 3 when tho?  <br>Awaki comes to mind</br>  <br>Whenever they feel like it.</br>  <br>Whose this semen demon</br>  <br>demon lord touma when?</br>  <br>When the LNs sales goes down. So soon,  thanks to Misaka. </br>  <br>Accel did nothing wrong.</br>  <br>This guy</br>  <br> Misaka didn't get stronger <br>That is sad because all the level 5s got stronger</br></br>  <br>  magic/esper battles <br>Literally zero of them in entire main series. Magic will never met science. Never.</br></br>    <br>Fuck it might as well watch the fillers for railgun s that nigga seems hilarious.</br>  <br>You need to be defeated before power up. Misaka is always wins so no reason.</br>  <br>But can you held all of incoming DEEP DARKNESS OF STUDY?</br>  <br>She hasn't been working hard, though. Her whole schtik was 'got there through hard work'. But she hasn't been working hard. She's been writing thousand-page volumes of fantasy about having violent BDSM sex with Touma and becoming his slave. So her training has slacked.</br>  <br>Why work hard when you've reached the top level?</br>  <br>That reminds me of this guy who used grimoires as armor. Was it Birdway enemy? Actually if you think about it Birdway like most hardworking character of raildex.</br>  <br>She needs guts</br>  <br> She's been writing thousand-page volumes of fantasy about having violent BDSM sex with Touma and becoming his slave. <br>No, this is about handholding and cumming inside.</br></br>  <br>Orentz Tryce from Kanzaki SS.</br>  <br>useless</br>  <br>Fiamma btfo.</br>  <br>She probably just thinks that what she did was hard work when in reality it was nothing compared to even the lv zeroes.</br>  <br>Citation needed.</br>  <br>Becoming a level 5 is easy as fuck right?</br>  <br><br>Parameter list.<br>We've seen in this series time and time again that lv has almost nothing to do with personal effort.</br></br></br>  <br> lv has almost nothing to do with personal effort. <br>Parameter list just means that your maximum level is set, doesn't mean hard work is useless. The misaki novel showed that it's not easy to achieve lv5 regardless.</br></br>  <br><br>Unless you have GUTS</br></br>  <br>Its not your maximum level that's set. It's how much effort AC itself is willing to put in.<br>Lv 5 might not be a complete cakewalk as you study up on how to use your powers but progress is entirely in AC's hands. Your mental effort has nothing to do with the physical effects caused by AC messing with your brain.</br></br>  <br> Its not your maximum level that's set. It's how much effort AC itself is willing to put in. <br>I'm pretty sure its both.</br></br>  <br>Nah. The price rises the harder it is to raise your level but in the end it's really how much of a shit AC gives about raising your level. <br>It's basic economics where they weigh the cost of leveling a person vs how much they want a person at that level. If Saten was a lv 3 accelerator you bet your ass she wouldn't be lv 0.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I know.<br><br>I just meant that I think that there is an element of hard limits.<br><br>Using the Saten example, if Ac was willing to spend the money on it, Saten could be a level 3 Aerohand. But no mattter how much they spent, they'd never be able to push her up to level 4.<br><br>There are actually multiple reasons why Leveling up Saten is unviable.<br><br>First would be her low lvl potential.<br><br>Second would be how she'd be a money sink.<br><br>Third is the fact that her power isn't exactly uncommon. <br><br>Heh, Fan girl probably took away all of Satens potential resources.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, Parameter List does include a hard level cap. The resources needed to reach that cap is another story.</br>  <br>I'd have to reread the LN it was presented in just in the off chance my memory of it mutated but to take your example; they totally can take Saten up to lv 4 but they don't want to actually spend the amount of money or time that it would take to begin with(it could even be possibly be more than they have) and they could upgrade Kongou instead.<br>The list is what they CAN do before upgrading becomes what they consider a money sink. The actual current levels are what we get after they allocated resources based on the list. <br> <br>Another line of reasoning is that if it was an actual hard cap then noone would be trying to make accel hit lv 6.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's been implied as early as in Index vol 1 and vol 3 what it takes to be #3. Misaka hasn't been calling herself a monster back then and now without a good reason.</br>  <br>They probably raised based on how usefull to Aleister keikaku you are. I mean, if someone like accel and his vector powers had low lvl potential they just wouldnt give a fuck and spend a shit ton of resources on making him lvl 5.</br>  <br>Everyone in AC calls the lv 5 monsters simply due to the power gap and that's before i accidentally derail by pointing out that the lv fives aren't known for being mentally stable by the adults to begin with. There are tons of perfectly legitimate reasons for Misaka to get used to using the term monster to describe herself unrelated to personal effort.</br>  <br>Misaka, gunha, misaki and pierce are never shown to be unstable though. At least not that I can remember. Well maybe Mikoto gets a bit crazy when touma is around another girl.</br>  <br> pierce </br>  <br> A little <br>Misaka stalked him to RUSSIA in the middle of a world war via hijacking a military jet.<br><br>Misaki is fairly high on the sanity scale now but she also was moments from suicide before Touma ran into her. I think she's a bit more frail than she lets on.<br>I don't know what Gunha is. It's hard to gauge sanity when dealing with a person with the power to do whatever he wants.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aogami is the Observer. Headband girl is just a decoy.</br>  <br>Toppest kek. Parameter list just shows your level-cap. No efforts = No level.</br>  <br>Gunha is insanity itself <br>That guy is not sane</br></br>  <br>If effort was all there was to it then lv 0 would be able to attain lvup on their own. You are trying to attribute mental effort to a psychical alteration done by other people.<br><br>That's the thing. Sure it might seem insane to us to stop gravity via shout but when you can actually do it is it really crazy?</br></br></br>  After re-reading Vol 3, both the fantranslation and YP release, I can surely say that:<br>Regarding SISTERS Arc:<br>Railgun manga = Railgun Anime &gt; Index LN &gt; Index Anime.<br><br>This is the objective truth.</br></br></br></br>  <br>he is as sane as Himegami.<br>both Gemstones</br></br>  <br>Railgun S anime had nice soundtracks in that arc so fuck the manga.</br>  <br>That's the thing.<br>In lots of parts I consider Railgun S adaptation to be the best, but in others it was weaker. So they're about equal.</br></br>  <br><br>Isn't Misaka also kind of sadistic person?</br></br>  <br> stop gravity via shout <br>Gravity does not work that way.</br></br>  When did index turn so shit?<br>I used to really like the novel, but now I can't even force myself to keep reading.<br><br>Something is being done really wrong, Othinious Arc was the last good volume.</br></br></br>  <br>That's the point. Gunha gives no fucks about physics. The bar for what's sane and insnae for him is actually an M. C. Escher painting</br>  <br> talking shit about Fuyukawa </br>  Has Misaka fucked Touma yet?<br>Has Accelspammer returned to save our souls yet?</br>  <br>Its a mix between sadism and being excited that someone is on her Level.<br>Than she can go all out.</br></br>  <br>The Misaki/Mitsuari thing should had settle this debate already<br>If left alone they would naturally cap at level 3 but with AC's help they both had the potential to reach 5, the thing being that the city only had money for one or probably only wanted one Mental Out so they choose to invest in Misaki.</br></br>  <br>No, nothing romantic or sexual will ever happen.<br><br>Nope he did an hero.</br></br></br>  <br> If effort was all there was to it then lv 0 would be able to attain lv up on their own. <br>This is so hard to understand?<br>Parameter List says you can be Level 5 =&gt; Little efforts =&gt; Level 1 =&gt; A lot of efforts =&gt; Level 5<br>Parameter List says you can be Level 5 =&gt; No efforts =&gt; You're a shit<br>Parameter List says you can be Level 0 =&gt; Little efforts =&gt; HURR DURR I DON'T SEE A RESULT =&gt; End of efforts =&gt; You're a shit</br></br></br></br></br>   In fact, to Nayuta, the AIM diffusion field around this guy was rather unstable. Even <br> when he was not doing anything obvious, she still couldn't visualise him in this state. <br> Maybe there was some power obstructing the sighting of the AIM diffusion field. <br>So there is his actuell power and the power which hides his Aim diffusion field.</br></br></br>  <br>On the other hand that filler was 2deep4me</br>  <br> pushing up glasses <br>Was this Nagai retarded on purpose, or did he unironically think that it looked cool? If it's the former, why did he decide to make a mockery of Academy City's darkness?</br></br>  <br> only the cute girl doesn't fixes her glasses <br>;_;</br></br>  <br>Only Accelerator and Kakine are capable of reaching Level 6. The others are growing in a different direction. There is a hard cap. Kamachi himself calls the Parameter List a wall.</br>  <br>More like <br>Parameter List says you can be Level 5 =&gt; do nothing =&gt; Congratulations you are the strongest level 5 Accel! now go and kill this clone<br>Parameter List says you can be Level 5 =&gt; AC shits on you =&gt; Sucks to be you, Takitsubo <br>In fact wasn't Accel supposed to reach level 6 just by chilling out for 200 years or something</br></br></br></br>  <br> just by chilling <br><br>No? If he continued with the current curriculum he'd attain it in 250 years.<br>The "current curriculum" means getting experimented on every single day, testing your shit every single day, and so on.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Parameter List says you can be Level 5 =&gt; do nothing =&gt; Congratulations you are the strongest level 5 Accel! now go and kill this clone <br> Parameter List says you can be Level 5 =&gt; AC shits on you =&gt; Sucks to be you, Takitsubo  <br>I'm tired of your fanfiction.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't the big plan to have Misaka evolve to lvl 6?</br>  <br> why did he decide to make a mockery of Academy City's darkness? <br>I don't know, that scene with Gensei calling study's masterplan a summer project was hilarious</br></br>  <br> stop gravity via shout <br>He never did that. Learn to read properly.</br></br>  <br>No, that was just Gensei's scientific curiosity <br>Accel is the plan, Kakine is the back up</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>I am pretty sure he did it when Kuroko tried to throw him</br>  <br>Thats routine in AC<br>Nothing different to the kind of shit he had to deal with on a daily basis</br></br>  <br>No, he didn't. He shouted and righted himself after being flipped, but nowhere does it say that he stopped gravity. Also, the translation of that SS is iffy.</br>  <br> He shouted and righted himself after being flipped <br>Gravity was probably one of the many forces acting on him that he decided to ignore because of guts</br></br>  <br><br>Until Aleister confirms it himself, that is.</br></br>  <br> Kakine <br>Assumption<br><br> “Academy City has seven Level 5s. However, the predictive calculations of Tree Diagram have established that there is a single one of them &gt;who is capable of reaching the as yet unseen Level 6. The other Level 5s are either growing in a different direction or their bodily balance &gt;would be lost by an increase in dosage.” <br>#1:Reaching Level 6<br>#2:Body balance lost<br>#3:Body balance lost.Did happen.<br>#4:Body balance lost.obvious<br>#5: Dont know<br>#6: Dont know<br>#7:different direction</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure?<br> With a roar of hot-bloodedness, the surroundings started to be affected by the wave. <br> The vibration of the atmosphere echoed throughout, and everyone hurriedly covered <br> their ears even though they knew that it was too late. <br> He didn't even need to use his hands. He just used a shout to prevent himself from <br> falling down. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He was flipped. If he just "ignored" gravity like you said, he wouldn't have been standing on his feet afterwards.<br><br>No, he didn't ignore anything. He simply moved super fast.<br><br><br>No. Kakine is the spare plan (and the only space plan) for a reason. If he isn't even capable of reaching Level 6 then there should be no spare plan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even if he can't he is still the second best option</br>  <br>He cushioned his fall with a shout. Who knows, everything's basically possible with Guts</br>  <br>Agreed. Mikoto is like a bitchy version of Onodera.</br>  <br>He didnt ignore gravity but used his shouting <br>to work against gravity.<br> He just used a shout to prevent himself from <br> falling down. <br>And even that makes as much sense as ignoring gravity.<br>And about kakine being the spare plan.We dont even know if Aleister needs Level 6.<br>and being the spare plan is something that kakine invented because he is Number 2.The official dokuments say accel is the only who can become a stable Level 6.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why do people say that Mikoto and Touma's interactions suck? This volume has been great so far.</br></br>  <br> like a bitchy version of Onodera <br>Just say Chitoge and be done with it, because even the inevitable winner of Nisekoib Owl gets shafted every time.</br></br>  <br>Yes, this volume</br>  <br>Because Kamachi almost never has them interacting beyond the typical violent tsundere antics nearly everyone is tired of.</br>  <br>Spare Plan was first mentioned by Accelerator. Kakine didn't invent shit.<br><br> makes as much sense as ignoring gravity <br>No. "Shouting" to work against gravity and fly is the same concept used by rockets.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't knew rockets were powered by GUTS</br>  <br> Spare Plan was first mentioned by Accelerator <br>Yea again because Accelerator is Number 1<br>and Kakine Number 2.When Number 1 is not anymore<br>Number 2 becomes Number 1.But that doesnt mean Number 2<br>is as qualified Number 2.And again.<br> “Academy City has seven Level 5s. However, the predictive calculations of Tree Diagram have &gt;established that there is a single one of them who is capable of reaching the as yet unseen &gt;Level 6. The other Level 5s are either growing in a different direction or their bodily balance &gt;would be lost by an increase in dosage.” </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except Kosaki could have one day one if she even tried.

Then Erica will die.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Guts and Griffith fight <br> Rickerts there watching <br>  shit happens <br>  a behelit rolls over to him <br>  shit gets real <br>  Eclipse 2.0 </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OTP</br>  <br>But Rickert has no reason to use a behelit</br>  <br>Why is serpico so hot?</br>  <br>what would modern casca singing sound like?</br>  <br>it's the fox eyes</br>  <br>Royal blood</br>  <br><br>why won't farnese tap that?</br></br>  <br>too busy learning to draw apples in her mind or some shit</br>   next chapter has them get off the island <br> "Wow, that took no time at all!" </br>  <br>She wanted to but he turned her down.</br>  <br>Fuck, I meant get on the island.</br>  <br>bastard swag</br>  <br>But he loves her</br>  I've forgot the majority of Berserk's plot up until now<br><br>It's been so long</br></br>  <br> why won't farnese tap that? <br>Did you forget her whole background chapters anon? She very much wanted to tap that but he said no.</br></br>  <br>incest is bad m'kay?</br>  <br>He doesn't want children with 11 toes. Which probably wouldn't be too out of place in the Berserk universe but they're still related.<br><br>Otherwise he'd probably be DTF.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't he in love with her though?</br>  <br>Doesn't matter. He probably realizes that since their father knows about how they're actually related that it would only cause trouble. Besides, Serpico still cares for her deeply, he just wouldn't put his dick in her. And can you really blame him? Bitch is crazy.</br>  Wait, I thought Berserk getting updates was just us memeing again.<br><br>It's really happening is it? I guess after all this time of little to no updates I've become jaded that I can't even summon any excitement for it anymore.</br></br>  What if the next chapter is the boat sinking and nobody can do anything about it?  <br>We're getting a 100 page chapter in a little more than a week and it will continue from there with monthly updates.</br>  <br>He's always aware of how Farnese looks at Guts...it hurts him. Hurts him so bad.</br>  This is how berserk should've ended:<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/452615/4a31f2<wbr>eb57/</wbr></br></br>    <br>the next chapter is just guts looking at the sea while looking bored</br>  <br> not posting the first one </br>    <br>why does that still seem wrong</br>  <br>Allahu Akbar</br>  <br>How long have they been writing about the boat adventures? 4-5 years? Is this One Piece?</br>  <br> 4-5 years? <br>I think it's been like 8 years now.</br></br>  <br>I think the crew in One Piece has actually spent less overall time on boats.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128288743 <br>Since school let out.</br>  When did it suddenly become acceptable to post hawk scans again?<br><br>Fucking scrubs.</br></br>  What are wrong with Hawk scans?  <br>How far we've fallen.</br>  <br>is that Jill?!

Did void give Femto a tour of everything after the eclipse?

Only ones I can find are 334 and 335</br></br></br>  <br>Welp they are in Mangafox all of them but that quality, also who has translated these? Are they crap?</br>  Rewatching the anime and this was the most fucked up moment first time seeing it  before ever reading the manga   <br>http://mangafox.me/manga/berserk/v3<wbr>8/c335/16.html<br>shows who translated</br></wbr></br>  <br>Forgot the picture ofc</br>  Is Gut's eye sewn shut?  <br>I'm pretty sure he just has the reflex down pat.</br>   Re-reading Berserk. <br> Having a great time. <br> Enjoying the funny moments with the Band. <br> Eclipse <br> "Oh right, the murders." <br> Become incredibly sad watching Guts watch all his friends get ripped in half, Gaston's head explode from the inside out. <br> And everything else. <br><br>On the bright side, you can literally pin-point the moment Gut's rage kicks in to MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE.<br><br><br> Casca a cute. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i just assumed it was the nerves/muscles being dead or whatever</br>  Given this a try for like 3 times but just cannot get past the opening scene with horrible CGI<br>Should I just bite my lip and go through with them?</br>  <br>the third movie is the only decent one<br>but they cut out two of the best parts, the sex scene, and WYALD THE GRAND MAGICAL RAPIST</br></br>  <br>they're what got me onto Berserk in the first place, but they don't really do it proper justice<br><br>i wouldn't bother</br></br></br>  Whatever happens I won't be discussing it with you lot. These threads are cancer and show the average reader of Berserk today is a complete utter shonenfag moron. I hope Deepfag doesn't do something stupid, like comeback to you retards.  <br>O shit son</br>  I hope we will know more about this guy  <br>why is his true form doggystyling a deer?</br>  <br>Because Miura draws his fantasms</br>   5 days until new chapter gets released <br> No leaks <br><br>Holy shit, I just want to know about what will be covering.</br></br></br>  <br>Miura here, Casca dies.</br>  <br>so how did he even end up in prison?<br><br>Obviously he went in willingly, did he just do it because he thought it would be fun?</br></br></br>  <br>Excitement and enjoyment!</br>  <br>zach here<br>thanks man</br></br>  <br>You've never raped anyone in your life.</br>  <br>Back the fuck off?!</br>  <br>Daily reminder that we must all become Cascafags in order to dispel the tripfag threat.

Witches and wizards also train there, while Schierke speaks of elves that can predict the future. All of Griffith's apostle army were focused on fighting Ganishka anyway, even if they were told to burn down Elfhelm they'd probably take the time to shipwreck the jRPG party in the process.<br><br>tl;dr - Anons are retarded to think that the island is just some sitting duck for demons.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't the moon child Guts and Caska's son?</br>  <br>No, he might be either:<br> Griffith's son <br>or<br> A guide sent by The Elf King. </br></br></br></br>  <br>That is also possible. I like to go both ways by speculating that the Elf King gives the soul of Guts and Casca's child a blessed body during nights of the full moon in order to steer the former on the right path. Whatever it may be, the child certainly has no demonic aura, which Griffith cannot help but give off.<br><br> Why do some anons spell her name as Caska? Do you drink alcohol from her? </br></br></br>  <br>It was as its best between 14 and 19.</br>  <br> it's those dastardly Hawk scans, i get it mixed some sometimes as well </br>  <br>Casca is what we call Easter here, and it's the exact same pronunciation as well.  Skellig is also an island off our coast, coincidence? </br>  <br>There's also Easter island<br><br>It's like poetry</br></br></br>  <br>If you see this post while scrolling this thread, you have been visited by the Berserk world's true lord and savior. The ability to count to behelits will come to you, but only if you post CASCA BEST GIRL on this thread.</br>    <br>What panel is that upper right image from?</br>  <br>i forget, one of the ones when they fug</br>    <br>nice</br>  <br>Rape</br>  5 DAYS UNTIL NEW CHAPTER<br>ARE YOU GUYS READY?</br>  <br>CASCA BEST GIRL</br>  <br>How long will it take until a translated version is released? <br><br>Or am I gonna have to learn Japanese?</br></br></br>  <br>a day at most</br>  <br>It doesn't take long for an anon fluent in moonspeak to come along and translate it for us, but it can take up to two weeks for Evil Genius to release a proper scanlation.</br>  <br><br>Alright, good to hear</br></br>   Guts gets off the boat <br> gets a new powerup and throws the berserker armour in the trash <br> Caska regains her memory and still loves Guts <br> &gt;you wake up </br></br></br>  <br>It's not her child anymore</br>  <br>Still has baby blood, which caused him to involuntarily save her. Too bad Griffith only wants a meal ticket.</br>  <br>I'm calling it, Casca will become Griffith's only weakness.<br>Oh the irony.</br></br>  This was one of the best fucking pages ever made in manga. Damn miura, DAMN yu.  <br> Casca must die for Guts to defeat Griffith <br> Guts insists on finding another way <br> Casca sacrifices herself <br><br>nothing would prepare me for this</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why are her arms trying to hug him? is she enjoying it?</br>  <br>Kamiyan should voice him.</br>  <br>Of course. She even kissed him back.<br>Griffith became an expert at it after all. Add to that the fact she's always been madly in love with him.<br>I think part of why she's so fucked up now is because she enjoyed the rape in front of her lover. She became the bitch she always knew she were.<br>The shame and disgust was too much for anyone to handle.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Literally copypasta from the 3-Gatsu Lion spread tribute <br><br>Lazy faggot.</br></br></br>  <br> She became the bitch she always knew she were. <br>You're taking this a little far. Why do you hate Casca so much?</br></br>  <br>She always knew it mang</br>  <br>I think that anon was trying to insinuate that Casca would cause Griffith to hesitate if he were about to land the killing blow on Guts during the final battle, which would allow Guts to finish him off once and for all.<br><br>Then they have sex over his dead body.<br><br><br>It's just bait. People have been raging over the rape for decades. Even I, the honorable Cascafag, had the same problem, but then I had the best fap in ages to it and saw the light. Now I just tell people that Casca can give you more orgasms than the average hentai, but don't go fapping to webm related.<br><br> b-but Cascafag, that doesn't sound right <br><br>It doesn't really matter if she enjoyed it or not. If she did, then I wouldn't really blame her for it, wise magical rape raven and all that. If she didn't, then Femto can give the Rapeman a run for his money. We should just want what's best for her at this point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking Guts... He is literally perfect in every way.</br>  <br>Casca would never attack Griffith though. She'd probably kill herself if he dies because of her.</br>  <br>Why does Casca look whiter in the movies than in the manga?</br>  <br> Caska <br><br>le trashman face</br></br></br>   trying to stream Golden Age Arc 3 <br> can't go full screen <br><br>HELP</br></br></br>  <br>Post the rest</br>  <br>Now, here's the thing people take too far - Casca's worship of Griffith. They all say she'll return to him or attempt to justify the Hawks' sacrifice, but she recognizes Griffith's betrayal during the Eclipse and asks him (obviously with no response) if this was "the nightmare you wanted". When most of Casca's plot during the Golden Age was her trying to accept herself as more than just a pawn under Griffith's thumb, it'd be kinda boring for her to to take a step back. I'd prefer for her to come to terms with the reality of her situation, connect with the rest of the group and attempt to talk Guts out of his suicide mission against Griffith. Obviously it won't work, but with Griffith and Charlotte having tea parties in Falconia they could also take some time out to recuperate and train for the fight back.<br>Making progress, moving forward, growing stronger, these would be good things for her character. Even if she did want to come back, it's too far, she doesn't know where he is, and the amount of Apostles around Falconia would result in her dying instantly.<br><br><br>Because Studio 4c are hacks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First you should  kill yourself </br>    <br>Did you miss the part where she literally prefers Griffith over Guts and her desire to change went to hell because Griffith is all she's ever lived for?</br>  <br>http://kissanime.com/Anime/Berserk-<wbr>The-Golden-Age-Arc-III-The-Advent-D<wbr>ub here you go anon</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>I feel like Red Saber and Wyald would get n pretty well.</br>    I wish there were Mongolian Nomads in Berserk. <br><br>I like to see how Guts can fight off horse archers.</br></br>    <br> Making progress, moving forward, growing stronger, these would be good things for her character. Even if she did want to come back, it's too far, she doesn't know where he is, and the amount of Apostles around Falconia would result in her dying instantly. <br> Casca nad Guts fighting together again <br>I need this to happpen</br></br></br>  <br>That was a textbook bros before hoes situation. You'd have to be a major cunt to run off with your lover when the guy who brought you up from nothing is a few bits of skin away from being a spooky skeleton. However, now Griffith is back to full power, he doesn't need her anymore, and Guts and Casca have now unknowingly fulfilled their promise of running away together.<br><br>tl;dr: lrn2plot</br></br></br>    <br>post this one</br>  <br>Did you forget the part where Casca called Griffith her dream and she still couldn't her over her jealousy despite having Guts?</br>    Reminder that Miss Luca is best girl  aight imma find that page  <br>You mean the part that's being dumped now? The one with the shitty Hawk scans? I think it's very realistic for her to not immediately "get over" Griffith, and courageous to admit these feelings to Guts. A part of Casca will always love Griffith, but that doesn't wash out her love for Guts. The two of them are equals.<br><br> no more nitpicking pls <br><br><br>Luca is a woman, not a girl. Show more respect.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>No, I mean this part.<br><br>You know what? I'll go and make a college just for you.</br></br></br>    <br>Nobody will trust collages based on shitty Hawk scans. Go on Bakabt and download the proper stuff, then get back to me.</br>  <br>the message gets across for crying out loud, don't be dense and accept Casca never stopped loving Griffith.</br>    <br> Such differences in dialogue! Hawks scans fucking sucksss <br><br>I know it's a thread meme by now but it gets old when you are told they don't help to support your claims</br></br></br>    <br>Yeah, I said that. Casca would always love Griffith, deep down, but it's the kind of unconditional love anybody would have towards him for saving their life and honing them into a strong, proud warrior. You're dense to think that Casca can't think of anyone else, that Griffith is the only person she cares about.</br>  I'm 30-35 chapters away from the last one, does Guts appearence ever improve? Man he's completely destroyed just look at his face.<br><br>I'm legit feeling sad for him although I've felt sad for him ever since golden arc but this is going off the charts.<br><br><br>Not only that but he seems to start getting signals that he's getting blind due to the armor. I can't see this ending well.<br><br><br>Caska is also starting to piss me the fuck off</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Judeau is cute</br>  Obligatory best girl thread.  Can't you fuckers see that all the girls in this show are shit on purpose?  <br>Only in order to kill the Kaworu and Shinjifags.</br>    <br>what the fuck did you just say about misato</br>  Where are the reifags? I wanna argue.  Didn't see a thread.  Why is Erina such a bitch?  Aldinis a qt.  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA!  <br>Get in line.</br>  So what are the dishes in the manga that are worth cooking?<br><br>I already tried Chaliapin Steak Don. Shit's delicious.</br></br>  <br>I would fuck post-summer Isami, no homo.</br>  The first five posts ITT more or less summarize a typical Shokugeki thread. Bravo.  Why hasn't there been Toriko and SnS collaboration manga?  So why did they feel the need to replace Kaarge arc? Why would they just randomly switch arcs, what is a reason?  <br>and it's glorious</br>  <br><br>that's the inevitable truth with generals</br></br>  <br>Because Toriko is literal dogshit. Notice how Tosh loves collaboration work but decided to do it with Isobe Isobee instead of the obvious choice.</br>  <br>They will probably adapt the Karaage Arc in only one episode or something.</br>  <br>I think it's not up to him to call the shots, no? I agree Toriko became officially worst thing ever after Human world but it's kind of hilarious when it would be the obvious choice. Guess Luffy and Goku don't want to be associated with Toriko anymore also.</br>  <br><br>Because collaborations feels pretty forced in general.</br></br>  <br> you will never eat gelato with Aldini bros <br>Why ever live?</br></br>  <br>That fucking gap between Isami's thighs.</br>  <br>Takumi a cute.</br>  Meat best girl.  <br>What the story behind this pic again?</br>  劇場版selector destructed WIXOSSの公開日は2016年2月13日（土）で、新宿バルト９ほか 全国35館にて上映になります！！！（つかやん）  <br> 2016年2月13日 <br> 2月13日 <br> February 13 <br> that release date </br></br></br></br>  Is this just a recap movie or will there be original content?

This happened when I was posting daily reminders in madoka threads back then.</br></br>  Post yfw they go full rebellion.  <br>What kind of reminders</br>  <br><br><br>Checkmate, fakers.</br></br></br>  <br>But that's my image.</br>  <br>They are definitely going Rebellion. Ulith is back. The Selector System 2.0 is back. And probably Tama and Iona will appear again.</br>  <br>Why just don't Yuragi fuck the shit out of Alfou.</br>  <br>Aww shit, summary incoming:<br><br> First, Yuragi literally didn't know the term "Eternal Girl", if you can believe it. In 8 chapters, Alfou never told her.<br>Meanwhile, Mako knows that a body swap exists, but nothing more, and she hasn't realized about Wakaba and Aoba.<br>The Green girls keep pushing Yuragi and Alfou back in the battle, and Alfou doesn't listen when Yuragi tries to counterattack<br>They actually pull off a Big Bang against her, and we enter a flashback<br>Guess what? The wheelchair girl was Alfou, and to give full context her father is rich or owns the hospital or something, and Alfou is spoiled when she's bedridden<br>She hears that her father remarried and had another child, effectively throwing her away<br>As a last resort, a girl is called in to volunteer to be her friend and help her, and that is of course Yuragi<br>They immediately become friends, and discuss how Alfou loves the Grimm version of Cinderella, where she must lose her glass slipper to get the prince, and her step-mother and sisters have their feet cut off and their eyes gouged out at the end<br>The moral that she likes is that to gain happiness, one must first sacrifice, so by losing her legs she'll be able to become a bride<br>Yuragi brings wixoss to her and suggests that she plays black<br>This is when Mako's sister dies, which traumatizes Yuragi and prevents her from seeing Alfou anymore<br>Alfou decides to go through the extremely painful rehabilitation so she can move herself around and go see Yuragi herself<br>She ends up in front of their school, but as Yuragi passes and Alfou speaks out, their eyes meet and Yuragi walks away without a word<br>(Recall that at this point she's developed the inability to see faces)<br>Alfou basically falls into despair as the Cinderella who will live forever covered in ashes<br>That's when she meets her LRIG, and makes her wish: Let me be by Yuragi's side!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br>  <br>She's just too obsessed with a shitty twintail who'll probably never love her back.</br>  <br>And, time to leave this thread in fear of spoilers.</br>  <br> Maybe in the end Yuragi will get over both her obsession and her past trauma, so she'll finally be able to recognize Alfou's face and they'll live together happily ever after. <br> I want to believe.  ;_;  </br></br>  <br>All this suffering.</br>  <br>OKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAA!<br>All this foreshadowing.</br></wbr></br>  <br>The more this develops the more I want to see it animated.</br>  <br>It will never happen. It's such a shame Mari Okada wasted something like this in a spin-off and not in the main series.</br>  <br>At this point Re/verse will surpass even WIXOSS S1.</br>  <br>Because not everything is anime sales, fucking faggot.</br>  <br>Look at the glorious background and you will find the answer.</br>  <br>These two are very cute!</br>  <br>Piruluk is now Amika property.</br>  <br>I completely forgot that that's when Valentines' Day is.</br>  Will be a recap?  <br>R U U C H A N<br>U U C H A N<br>U C H A N<br>C H A N<br>H A N<br>A N<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    post yfw it's written by the same scriptwriter who did Spread     backstory movie about Midoriko when she was a Selector   At first I thought the movie would focus on completely different characters, but using the same is a big plus.  I just watched the first season. What the hell kind of ending was that? What was the scene at the beginning supposed to be (if season 2 spoiler, don't answer)? Do I have to watch Spread? (It seems people hate it)  <br> Do I have to watch Spread? (It seems people hate it) <br> relying on other people for your enjoyment <br>Just watch the first episode and decide things for yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>The first season ending was a punch to the face then a suplex and while you were lying down in pain, finish you off by a kick to the balls.<br><br>It was great.</br></br></br>  <br>No nigga. The first episode was what we expected to happen THEN the writing shifted to another road.</br>  <br>It was more a watered-down Madoka but I don't want to start a war. <br><br>I'm not the kind to complain but literally nothing is explained. What was the "condition" supposed to be? What was Tama's wish?<br>I'm a sucker for tweests but plot-wise, it was absolutely empty and felt like it was here just for the sake of being here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>THIS.</br>  <br>You need to pay attention more. The show gave a lot of hints regarding this.<br><br>We know that you need to recite the "whole" Eternal girl chant to fulfill it.<br><br>We know that the only really two conditions are that you win at least 3 games and your LRIG thinks she can grant your wish. This is when you start to glow.<br><br>In Iona's case she was not turning Eternal girl on her 3rd win due to her unique wish of wanting to be the LRIG of the best Wixoss player. So she had to lose once before Ulith thinks she is capable of "granting" that specific wish.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I had understood that but that was truly a risky act coming from Iona. <br>Did Tama say she couldn't grant the wish because it was absolutely impossible or because she didn't want Ruu to become a LRIG? She said she didn't want to be far away from Ruu so she sacrificed herself, is that it?</br></br>  <br>Tama made a selfish decision that is selfless towards Ruuko. She did not want Ruuko to be sacrificed and be a LRIG alone. Add to that Mayu's emotional manipulation of Tama and you've got your pot of confusion brewing.</br>  <br>Looks like I have to watch Spread after all, no matter if it's shit. The ending really felt contrived, albeit understandable, and made solely to spite Madokafags.</br>  <br>Enjoy the derailed ride.</br>  I'm confused,  why were there 2 Alfous on chapter 7? Was it just a way to show what Alfou wanted but regreted later? or was the other Alfou Alfou's original LRIG? They had different hair too, one of them had 2 braids but the other only one   <br>chapter 8*</br>  When these two will fuck?  <br>Never<br><br> ;_; </br></br></br>  I miss Selector threads. It was fun looking forward to this show with you all every week. Haven't gotten that kind of feeling from an anime since.  <br>You better prepare yourself for the new Gundam because it's mostly guarantee almost half of the people from these threads will be there.</br>  <br>Yeah, but so will /m/.</br>  <br>Fine with me, I already go to /m/ anyway for Gundam and  Symphogear .</br>  <br>We just need another HYPE anime original, like Samflam, WIXOSS or YuYuYu.</br>  I can't wait to hear something like this in the new gundam.  <br>  another HYPE anime original <br>Why aren't you watching Symphogear GX, anon?</br></br>  <br>Symphogear GX only has shitty memesubs.</br>  <br>I should have posted this image, actually.</br>  <br>You have Crunchy for minimal-song-subs-speedsubs now, Commie for memesubs, and H&amp;D for maybe-not-quite-as-flowing-but-not-<wbr>memesubs. No worse than Funi simulcasts and then the wait for Asenshi for WIXOSS.</wbr></br>  <br>Not that anon, but is it worth it? I haven't watched the first two seasons.   Can't believe I don't watch anything this season besides Gangsta. </br>  <br>You can't just skip, you'd have to go back and watch from the beginning.</br>  <br>You'd have to marathon the two previous seasons but believe me it's worth it.</br>  <br>If you like songstresses fucking up toku-style mooks with magitech powered armor, Wild Arms references, and suffering overcome by friendship and hotblood, then yes, definitely (especially if you like Nana Mizuki, Aoi Yuuki, and/or Ayahi Takagaki, as they all have main-character roles).  is absolutely right, though.</br>  <br>The wait is real now.<br> What's up with asenshi site? It's been down for a couple days now. </br></br>  <br><br>Thanks, I'll go for it then.</br></br>  <br>It's up on my end.</br>  <br>This season is shit and they have their own lives. I hope they do the next gundam.</br>  <br> Nana <br> Aoi Yuuki <br>Ok, I'm completely sold now.</br></br></br>  <br>It's up for me, just checked.</br>  <br><br>Well shit, I have some figuring out to do, then.</br></br>  <br>Oh, turns out I just had an old-ass bookmark to asenshi.net when they moved to .moe at some point.

Ok, I've started watching episode 2 of Spread and I'm wondering what the fuck is up with all of those flashbacks and weird dreams. Also, the plot doesn't hold when there are no stakes and the characters are absolutely not hellbent on trying to change anything, and it doesn't seem to be such a bad thing for the friend to be a LRIG now.<br><br>I feel like continuing beyond this point would be a bad idea. I'm giving up.</br></br>  <br>Okay.</br>    <br> I feel like continuing beyond this point would be a bad idea. I'm giving up. <br>I pointed the same back then in the second episode of Spread's thread.</br></br>  <br>It's a shame she just got a a few minutes.</br>  Oh boy, maybe we'll finally get something about Ru's dark past<br><br>Also hopefully more Aki-Lucky</br></br>    <br>    Can't believe I don't watch anything this season besides Gangsta. <br>Symphogay's as campy as it usually is. This season's pretty good though; Lerche's going into maximum overdrive with three whole shows.</br></br>  Would you buy Wixoss cards if they were translated and released in the west?<br><br><br>This season is good for light shows.

And they are around 18. The manga is doing an actually good depiction of the toll a zombie world takes on the mind of the girls, that is the strength of the manga.<br><br><br>GG isn't.

So what deck does everyone play?  <br>Blue deck with Piruluk as my LRIG cause she's my waifu</br>  <br>I made proxies of Drawkai, Angels Tama, and a really awful Piruluk deck back when there were only two or three sets out.</br>  <br>Eldora but I have no one to play against.</br>  <br> what is webxoss? </br>  <br>Takara Tomy needs to drop the selector shit and star from 0.</br>  <br>I thought he meant real decks. I'm too shy for webxoss. Also no Dynamite which is important.</br>  <br>What? To be like the usual other TCG promoting anime? Hell no.</br>  <br>It's going nowhere.</br>  <br>Between Wixoss and Pripara, they cover pretty much everything.</br>  <br>I got over the shyness after playing a couple of matches and getting completely wrecked by some chinks. It's pretty fun after that</br>  <br>Is Pripara also from Takara Tommy? Are you shiting me?</br>  <br>W-Will you play with me?</br>  <br>Did you forget that Wixoss is TT's only adult oriented product?</br>    <br>might as well, haven't played in weeks  and I suck at this game anyway <br>room: /a/<br>pass: animu</br></br></br>      What does "free" mean on webxoss? Why do I see it all the time?  Well thanks to the thread's urging I finally finished both seasons and frankly I'm impressed. <br><br>I'm goig to sound pretentious but this is simply atmospheric. Every shot every subtle score and emotion conveyed this sense of offness from how the battles are in soft glowing colors, the subdued palettes and how grounded the whole thing was. <br><br>It felt real when Yuzuki had conflicting feelings over how she felt over her brother. I felt pain when Hitoe was basically robbed of happiness when she lost the chance to be an Eternal Girl. I felt shocked and justified when in the end Tama's desire to stay with Ruko ended their companionship and finished the season. <br><br>Hell I even liked how in the end the main conflict was resolved with reason and understanding rather than perpetually continuing a viscous cucle of victimhood.<br><br>In other words really, REALLY good and I fucking love it and I feel like a faggot for thinking it was boring when I got to episode 4. Thank you Anons for not having shit taste.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sashe isn't either.</br>  <br>*cycle not "cucle" Dang it I'm just so excited for the movie I can't even spellcheck right.</br>  <br>I think it means free as in without restriction. Meaning everyone can join.</br>  <br>Not already buying and supporting so it can.</br>  <br>Sashe, op energe angel tama, myuu, Eldora, and anne</br>  <br><br> not posting 600 ppp scans of you waifu </br></br>  <br><br>A dead website because people always play TCGs with other real people.</br></br>  <br>There are literally 66 players on Webxoss right now.</br>  <br> infected WIXOSS <br> promo Tamas <br> pajama Tama <br> BED TAMA <br>Mad jelly.  I hope some other person who doesn't care about cards calls you a faggot. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Collecting worst LRIG </br>  <br>It's a disease collecting all thesepromos <br><br> implying she's not best girl <br> implying I don't collect them all cause I'm a major faggot </br></br></br></br>  This TCG is sexist.<br><br>Where are the males?</br></br>  <br> tfw only have magazine and book promos <br>Fuck me. Original Ancient Surprise isn't even that cool since it isn't holo.</br></br>  <br>Tcgrepublic.com has most of the cards if you really wanna drop some cash on the game. Prices are decent for the most part</br>  <br>Too poor for those cards, saving money too. Thanks anyway.</br>                   no Alfou       <br>Hell yeah, baby.</br>  I desire to procreate with Piruruk.  <br>Shame this isn't full-size like  for a wallpaper.</br>   Looking at recent winning decklists on twitter <br> See stuff like pic related <br><br>How can a deck with so many 1-off copies of cards be competitive?</br></br></br>  <br>I think this is a good thing.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Why do I see none of you on webxoss. Everyone there is either Iona/Mayu or Vermillion Ulith.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You got it, it's basically universally agreed that the synergy of the music, art, direction, and voice acting make a subtle atmosphere that draws you in because nothing feels out of place. Okada's specialty is also in writing relatable situations and then having her characters react realistically, if not dramatically, to them in an entertaining way. The whole series was built on duality, which basically went over everyone's heads until the very last episode because everyone wanted spread to be as dark and suffering as infected. Fortunately even those people are getting what they want in the several manga she's writing, so the franchise as a whole has a wide appeal.</br>  <br> Ancient Surprise <br> Idol Defense. <br>This deck lacks originality.</br></br></br>  <br>Be glad you don't see FafuAura decks.<br>I started to put Idol Defense in all my Webxoss decks and I get to use it quite often.</br></br>  <br>Last night I was literally about to ask if there were any Prixoss images.</br>  <br>Ulith redemption incoming?</br>  <br>Holy shit that pajama Piruluk, my dickkkk</br>  <br>Holy shit!</br>  <br>Mirurun needs different name Atoms for her deck to make the best use of Chemical Flash, which can banish any number of SIGNI upto how many different name atoms you send to the bottom of your deck from the trash. Fracturing Lust is just tech that stops you from getting Big Banged. RAINY and other cards like Helium helps you toolbox into what atoms you need immediately, and what can be salvaged with Hydrogen, Uranium and other shit; so that's why you don't need that much card consistency because the deck should be able to cycle like crazy.<br><br>The lone Servant O is just to fill out the non-burst as well as have a solid 8 count. Carbon and Oxygen also fill out the non-burst while also help to make Chemical Flash live.<br><br>Of the 4 spells on the top right, I cannot tell what the left two are. Growing Future on the top right is basically an in-deck Ener Charge, and MAGIC HAND is just a tutor for Fracturing Lust or the other two spells.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> batoru tanoshii! </br>  <br>Scans<br>Fucking<br>Never.</br></br></br>  <br> I cannot tell what the left two are <br>http://selector-wixoss.wikia.com/wi<wbr>ki/Next_Ready<br>http://selector-wixoss.wikia.com/wi<wbr>ki/TRICK_OR_TREAT</wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  Ha ha,<br>time for best girl.</br>  Selectors pack Vol 5 just got released in Webxoss.  <br>Webxoss stills needs to achieve the same level of sophistication as Tenhou. I know they recently got the Spectator Mode, but I don't know how it works.</br>  <br>Oh, then Next Ready looks fucking great for any LRIG without Exceed effects, and I guess Trick or Treat is just to help the insane cycle this deck has or punish the other guy for overextending. Again, MAGIC HAND is a battery and can toolbox into any of those spells including Fracturing Lust so this supports having the one-ofs. <br><br>I haven't tried it but that's pretty much what I make of the deck. Seems like you have a lot of ways to clear the board, keep your hand full, and put a lot of pressure on the other opponent, so overall I'd like to try this deck a lot.  SHORT is still not played, hah. <br><br>Thanks for finding out the cards for me, was killing me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure if I should send bug reports since it seems like the guy is chinese. They should try to fix Rikabuto's ability to proc in the trash, which last time I checked doesn't work.</br>  So, what kind of movie project will Studio Pablo work in the 2017?  <br>Selector rebellion wixoss</br>  Any tips to improve this deck?<br>It does already win games because Mayu's exceed is broken but I feel it can still be made better. There are just too few deck slots to put in everything I would like to use.</br>      <br>Someone post more like this, I need more to justify my marathoning of Spread tomorrow.</br>  <br>If you look up the second post number that specific thread has a lot of good discussion in it.</br>  <br>We already had tons of dicussion back then.</br>  Anyone have that pic of Piruruk card covered with cum?  So what's popular in the meta right now? Haven't touched WIXOSS since Idol Defense.  <br>Tip 1: remove Ancient Surprise. Reason: it's a cancer that is killing wexoss.<br>Tip 2: remove Idol Defense. Reason: same.<br>Tip 3: remove Mayu. Reason: see above.<br>Then you'll become an upstanding member of community.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Webxoss should add a section in which you can ban some cards.</br>  Re/verse new final release when?  <br>Ask hard enough and I might be able to do it today, but otherwise it might take a few more days.</br>  <br>I can do that.</br>  <br>There are still the same old cancer decks. Pic related won a Wixoss Party today.</br>  <br> 3 colours (4 if we count ID) <br>This is quite neat actually.</br></br>  <br> That promo Re/verse card <br>I'm jealous.</br></br>  <br>Seems like I'll receive this tomorrow. If the thread's still there, I'll post some pics. If not, raws wil be available for the next one.</br>  I hope we get a proper character development for Hitoe in the movie.  <br><br>I like it too. The older version spammed Charging. This one uses Ein Dagger, and some new cards like Next Ready and Cyua. <br><br>The framework is the same, but I like it when people find out exactly what they can cut from such a consistent deck like Hanayo Kai was. It's basically the equivalent to HS face hunter or MTG burn deck which a lot of people don't like, but it serves as a test your deck has to pass.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 436 <br>It will reach limit-bump. Better we have another thread in the next month or by the end of this month.</br></br>    <br>Just post a new thread if this one dies. Please.</br>  So what's the plot?  <br>And I was thinking it was Wizard's Souls.</br>  Does anyone have this picture but with Tama and Mirurun? I remember have seen it before but I can't find it.  <br>Hey, that's the picture I requested in a drawthread!</br>  <br>I'll see if it's worth making a new thread, or if it's just 4koma stu...ok, I'll think I'll make a new thread.</br>  TL please.  <br>No one will keep it alive.</br>  <br>Slightly larger would be helpful.<br><br><br>I thought this was done.<br><br> Anyone would have been fine.

It's a shame Ellis couldn't be with her husbando Leonhardt.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm shocked Idea Factory even released the first Agarest game on mobile devices, but then they released Agarest Zero half a year ago.<br><br>As nice as a new Agarest would be, IF seems like they've run out of ideas. I hope they port Agarest 2 to mobile before giving up on the franchise.</br></br></br>  <br>I think falling for someone's son or grandchild is pretty cute for a character that lived long enough like an elf IMO.<br><br>Murmina was my choice too anon...and Dyshana.<br><br>I chose the Syrium girl in the Agarest 2.</br></br></br></br></br>  Ok, that's enough, who is Agarerst?    <br>Agarest is an RPG. You get to pick a waifu and have a child, who is the Mc of the next 'generation'. Repeat a few more times, and you can eventually get a MC who is a mixed Kitsune, elf, dark elf, and with wings like </br>    <br>too healthy</br>  What's a good class for an elf?  high impact sexual violence  <br>Mage, thief, bard, cleric.</br>  <br>release her and get some magic suport until I get a proper mage</br>  <br>Mage, cleric.<br><br><br>Bard is the faggot's class of choice. Not even the most prancy-la la homo elves choose bard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holyfuck. Filename. I'm dyngig</br>  <br>What ideas? most games seems they had run enough already including some other IF games yet Agarest is one of those who they haven't milk enough.<br><br><br><br>The only one now that is alive is Fire Emblem with this "picking waifu have a child character" Agarest now seems dead as well as Rune Factory which was at least another who came close and a bunch of old game.<br><br>Devs should really step up and do more with this system. Its strange that not even hentai games arent thinking about this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> dorf <br> bros <br>The only bros are skeletons.</br></br></br>  <br>Gamers in Elevenland want idol games, I guess, not RPGs where you have children with your waifu.<br><br>Even Dragon Quest has done it!</br></br></br>  <br>  more like court of loli </br>  <br>Take her back to my brothel and whore her out.<br>Does /a/ even pimp?</br></br>  <br>Sex ed.</br>    <br>God damn it.

Besides the game is still being sold expensevely.</br>  <br>at first I was disgusted.<br>Then I saw the filename<br>10/10</br></br></br>  Take her home, clean her up, and then do what must be done.  <br>Take her back to her home?</br>  <br>Rape her violentely and clean her again?</br>  <br><br>It is sold with a Kirika figure, I don't know if it sold without one. <br><br>Besides the DLC is just oufits</br></br></br></br>  <br>What do you mean, pure? That was absolutely licentious and haram.</br>  <br>Some anons here prefer to treat elf the right way (also know as the correct way) that is respect, love and tenderly procreation (no seriously, some people here really want a elf family)</br>  <br>I want an elf waifu who I treat like my Queen, and to have a family with her.</br>  <br><br>Will they release a normal ver. of her?<br><br>She's like the missing elf to my collection and  my heart </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shadowrun anime when?</br></br>  <br>When did /a/ become /tg/?</br>  <br>I'd fund it just to see racistly drawn Orks.</br>  <br>B-b-but that's leeewd!~</br>  <br><br>Knowing sega, probably not, but you can hope for a re-release</br></br>  <br>All of muh want.

I felt it with Tolstoy’s “War &amp; Peace”, got a glimpse of it in Dostoevsky’s “Crime &amp; Punishment” and got completely overwhelmed by it in Full Metal Daemon Muramasa. <br> From the authentic-sounding ancient Japanese prose, to a meticulously constructed alternate history of early 20th century and carefully researched martial arts of real samurai; you simply can’t make a story so vast and this profound unless you sacrifice majority of your life researching and contemplating the subject matter.  <br> Muramasa is a masterpiece, and it sends shivers down my spine just imagining what Narahara Ittetsu, a certified master of ancient Japanese martial arts and by no means a professional writer, had to go through to bring this grand work to life. <br><br> Note that this is all true. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I make her wear clothes.<br><br>And then I enjoy her suffering from being properly dressed.</br></br></br>  <br>Short selling them to bankruptcy.</br>  <br>What the fuck happened?</br>   you will never have an elf waifu <br> she is perfect in every way possible <br> she is ageless, and will always be young, nubile, healthy and supple </br></br>  <br>Sensual buttfucking.</br>  <br><br> implying she would give consent to you </br></br>  <br>I'm worried that if I had a son with an elf he would seduce her after I'm gone and she would end up forgetting about me.</br>  <br> Continuous poor quarterly results posted and so downgraded to "Sell" status by most market advisers.

I'm not saying it was out of character or anything. We've already seen him blow his cover at a freaking marine base cause he overheard someone talking smack abt WB.

It is in topic.<br>You're just afraid I might summon Rebeccafag back with this kind of subject, and I do agree that the thread kind of turns to shit even without him when the subject is touched upon, so I didn't plan on discussing this too much. I just thought I'd give my two cents.<br>tl;dr Calm you tits.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Think he meant Urouge.</br></br>  <br>I meant Urouge will ally with BB's crew, not Enel.</br>  <br><br>my bad, I misunderstood.  I don't want Urouge to join BB because they would have to job him real hard </br></br>  <br><br> implying he wouldn't kill BB and form the true Fallen Monk Pirates </br></br>  <br>Kuros has two legs?</br>  Isn't Urouge the weakest supernova though? Or is it another case of bounty =/= power?  <br><br>Urouge is Urouge.</br></br>  <br>it is not, as a matter of fact, you are discussing your different views about the meaning of the word 'misogynyst' which doesn't relate to one piece at all, and if someone uses it in a way that doesn't appeal to you to define a character you have no real reason to bump in and start or engage into a completely pointless discussion that involves SJW bullshit and such. These threads can get already bad staying on topic, let's just not discuss this kind of shit further shall we.<br><br> also as you said there's a chance we might summon HIM, now that would be the death of the thread </br></br></br>  <br> looking at a rock is cute <br><br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>I hadn't noticed they weren't there. Where are they?</br>  <br>what does a bounty matter to a superior being?</br>  <br>That was my first post in the thread.

I like the idea of Law being the favorite son. Kind of tragic that one brother ended up killing the other because they had different views of how Law should be brought up.<br><br>Well, yeah, Roci is a marine spy and all that, but I just really like the family kind of theme, okay?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Zoro's is pretty outdated though.</br></br>    <br><br>Yeah I like it too.<br><br>Another thing is, Doffy is a douche etc., but I can fully understand why he killed his brother - he's essentially like an underworld mob boss really.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Admire your commitment, but you need to stop</br>  <br>Well you tell me how many legs does Kyros have in OP's image</br>  This is the shittiest thread we've had in a while.

Doffy might have been an evil person, but Roci had to die after what he did. Doffy had to do it as the head of the family.<br><br>I wonder how he actually felt about Law leaving, too. He saw a part of himself in Law and was hoping the kid would help fuck up the world with him. So much for dreams, Doffy.</br></br></br>  Straw Hats only needs the first 5 crew.  <br>This, the newfags don't realise the trolls true goals and they reply to people like Rebeccafag</br>  <br><br>Yeah, you talk to the Feds, you're donezo.</br></br>  <br> Straw Hats dont need a shipwright who is also a very durable heavy hitter </br>  <br>That's not a number of legs.

If you're American, you should be ashamed for acting like retarded monkey for disrespecting us, we're as human as you are.</br>  oh shit it's really more than one person<br><br>Are OP threads doomed to suffer like this for eternity?</br></br>  <br>I'm not disrespecting you, we arent being serious when we say these words</br>  Can we use this One Piece thread to discuss One Piece instead of what you are doing now?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128301784 <br><br>Yes, and that was feasible.<br><br>I think you're confusing social laws with discrimination laws.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128301733 <br>Phillipine is African as far as I am concerned.

I expect him to be collected as shit despite the name for some reason</br></br></br>  <br>I want him to be sort of like a mix of Kuzan and fuji</br>  <br> Phillipine is African as far as I am concerned. <br>are you a bit retarded?</br></br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!<br><br>I wonder how Law ended up hating bread.

Like blowing a house away, because he tripped and afterwards rebuilding it with his men and asking for forgiveness or something, that would be cool</br></br>  <br>one more batshit insane admiral? I can live with that.</br>  <br> Like blowing a house away, because he tripped <br>so Admiral Corozon</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128301995 <br><br> is forbidden <br><br>Because of discrimination laws, social laws are a different thing.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128302066 <br>Dude just leave him alone. Bothering someone because they can't find ain't cool man.</br>  <br>No, I meant destroying it willingly. Like imagine a cute rabbit going around and trips and suddenly turns into a demon destroying everything in sight and afterwards turning into that rabbit again. That would be pretty nasty for anyone.</br>  <br>Green Bull should be different from the other admirals, so...<br> Aokiji: Lazy Justice, chill personality <br> Akainu: Absolute Justice, a zealot and a manipulator <br> Kizaru: Unclear Justice (whatever the fuck that means), acts like a stoner but is pretty ruthless <br> Fujitora: ??? Justice, a gambler with a keikaku <br>I think it'd be good to have a corrupt admiral who makes shady deals and turns a blind eye to his subordinates' crimes. Green Bull's justice could be "fight bad guys with their own methods".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128302220 <br><br>I'm not the racist one, I'm just talking about law.<br><br>It is socially forbidden, I'm not arguing otherwise - but there's a reason social laws don't exist, only social norms.<br><br>Discrimination laws on the other hand, exist and are feasible.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128302148 <br>Are you a 3D grill?<br>Do you really bleed from down there?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128302220 <br>Can i rub my dick on your armpits?<br>That's my fetish...</br></br>  <br>man, that would be awesome.

I don't care if that person was racist,fascist,taoist or misogynist don't assume anything about them</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I always though Fujitora was blind justice<br><br>Either way I'd rather have something like Lost Justice, someone who has the position without having a goal. Like akainu telling him to do something and he does, but only that and nothing more than that. For example if he has to catch doflamingo, he catches doflamingo, but wouldn't capture anyone related to him. That would probably open a lot of new problems which would be cool I guess.</br></br></br>  <br> that fucked up word <br> He <br>this is actually getting funny now, you should seriously consider writing satire</br></br></br>  Based mods.  shitposter-kun got banned it seems.  <br>It's either Impel Down or death unless he gets rescued. <br><br>If Doffy is ever going to be rescued, who's going to do it? The story "implies" that Monet and Vergo are "dead". I know it's debatable for people about Monet being dead, but that's what the story has so far.</br></br></br>  What if green bull was a woman? We've seen zoro and luffy attack women as long as sanji doesn't fight green bull it could work.  <br>Won't know till he's introduced.<br>Personally, I doubt it.</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry if I get offended because everyone assumes all anons have penises on 4chan.</br>  <br>His bounty was that because 108 is a significant number, he's probably as strong as the others, I'd say at least stronger than Killer, Zoro and Bonney. Maybe Bege too.</br>  <br>Are you retarded??<br>Or do you not know that breaking social laws can put you behind bars in America?</br></br>  <br>With how Dressrosa is completely destroyed, the crew isn't complete, everyone is very injured and Fujitora is already there with CP0 coming to the island, I can't see how they'll be able to party. They probably would have to do it in the ship once they leave with whoever.</br>  Seems like it's safe again.<br><br><br> Search for "bread trafalgar law" on ff.net. .

Has Franky ever showcased a love for animals?  <br>How tf do you know that? Or are you just tryin to sound smart</br>  So why exactly is it that Zoro became such bros with Luffy ? Can he just sense Luffy's potential ? Or is he drawn to his strength ? I know Mihawk said that Luffy can turn people into allies and what not but likewise Urouge has said that Zoro is not the type to follow others.  How can anybody like ussop? Weakest, stupidest, ugliest, pussiest Strawhat, god i hate him. How can the fucking sniper be allowed to be the weakest member? ridiculous.  <br>Wow it's like you're adolf hitler himself.</br>  <br>Is Law afraid of bread or something?</br>  <br>That's because Akainu is his bitch. Just look at this glorious motherfucker.<br>But to be serious for a moment, I didn't really get the admiral vibe from Fuji at all. Whenever the other 3 showed up, you knew shit was about to go down. Not so with him for some reason. At least for me.</br></br>  <br>His accent, and he's talking about paella. I investigated, and he's called El Risitas, he's from Sevilla, Spain.</br>  <br> speedreaders </br>  <br>Now you do. The anime may have downplayed it a little, I don't know. But I remember being mega hyped when "Zoro" appeared in Impel Down.</br>  <br><br>He's a Spanish comedian.</br></br>  <br>That's Hitler-sama.</br>  <br> gets BTFO <br> HURR DURR HITLER SAMA <br>just Fuck off already</br></br></br>  <br>I used to think the same, but the fucker just grew on me. He is smart and creative, he can be brave and kick ass when it counts, his VA is awesome. And his lies come true!</br>  <br>He doesn't like it. He's willing to fight Luffy and a monkey in order to not eat it.</br>  <br>Your probably a cracker aren't ya</br>  I feel like all the shitposting in this thread is done by like two people.  <br>said the racist.</br>  <br>Usopp is awesome. A ton of people used to hate Usopp which made me appreciate him even more and I'm better for it.</br>  <br> investigated <br>Your not a detective fuckwad</br></br>  <br>Where have you been the last couple years?<br> select all hamburgers <br>Christ I'm hungry.</br></br></br>  <br>Been reading since Skypeia.. don't think he's gonna "grow on me" if he hasn't already.</br>    <br>I think sometimes people take bait just because they;re bored too. And there's probably lots of bored people here. All it takes really is one dedicated master baiter.</br>  <br>Wouldn't surprise me in the least.</br>  <br>Spanish and Mexican are the same friggin thing dumbass.<br>It's like saying Caucasian and slavic</br></br>  <br>Doflamingo forced him to eat a bread made of his dead parents when he was a child to prove his royalities.</br>  <br>Same. Must be something about Logia Admirals.</br>  <br>Why can't people just post nice pictures when they're bored or something?<br> When I'm bored I post homos </br></br>  <br>I=What was your reaction to Sogeking and him trying to bait Lucci and him fighting Perona and defending Zoro against Kizaru and Kuma and him sticking up for his Captain in PH and God Usopp ?</br>  <br>Because not everyone likes a guy and a girl in the same pic. It's just not right to look at. It's socially and universally unacceptable. If your gonna post something there shouldn't be a female in it.</br>  <br>Did you get that vibe from Aokiji's introduction ? He was impressive but I think Fujitora's meteors might rival that.</br>  <br><br> Spanish and Mexican are the same friggin thing <br> Caucasian and Slavic are the same thing <br><br>Who was calling who racist again?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this usopp's island?<br><br><br>Sure, just like British and Americans, or Portuguese and Brazilians</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128297818 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128298093 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128300438 <br>Top fucking kek the faggot<br> hates bellamy <br> likes bellamy <br> is the "will rebecca join"-shitposter <br> is the transgender Femanon <br><br>Seriously giving this 12 year old a ip range ban would make the op threads twice as good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You obviously don't know the definition of racist.</br>  <br><br>Racism is discrimination against race.</br></br>    Anyone else love it when Luffy gets really pissed off ?<br><br><br><br>Yea, pretty sure it's Usopp's village.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Idk, you never met bro's you just hit it off with? Friendship at first sight? Instant bromance? Happened to me twice as a grown man, the friend that introduces you always get mad jello too.</br>  <br>Age doesn't really matter on this site</br>  <br>I don't really know why its like this. I know Fujitora is a fucking beast, but for some reason I just don't feel the same way about him as I did with the original 3.</br>  <br> Age doesn't really matter on this site <br>I wrote moot an e-mail just now, you should read the rules.</br></br>    <br>Finally a normal person in this thread. I'm tired of everyone posting girls. Not everyone likes that shit. Can you post some moar btw? Please</br>  <br>It doesn't have to be "discrimination" just prejudice. Not all racism is bad, Asians being better at math for example.</br>  <br>A lot of times I don't remember how I became friends with someone. It's as if we ''just were'', you know ? And I don't think I've had anyone connect with me that quickly and deeply that quickly. Then again, I'm not Luffy/Zoro nor am I in a manga so that's to be expected. I don't know, it's just kinda interesting to think about.</br>  <br><br> age doesn't really matter on this site  <br><br>Global Rule 2.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No, it can be prejudice.<br><br>In which it is still racism - I'm not talking about good or bad here, more 'is' and 'isn't.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Physical age doesn't mean Jack shit. You could be 10 but in reality you have the mind of a 22 year old</br>  <br>As I said read the rules.</br>  <br><br>Doesn't matter what you 'think', it's the rules.</br></br>  <br>Might be because Fujitora kinda showed his ability a little more than the others. All the others were just Monsters and they left the scene. Aokiji almost killed Luffy, rekt Zoro and Sanji. Kizaru wrecked everyone, Akainu was having a whale of a time. Fujitora just kinda did something, laughed and did his own thing.</br>  <br>Rules are meant to be broken bruh</br>  <br><br>Don't whine if you get banned then.</br></br>  <br>nope</br>  <br>The small arc before Sabaody was amazing.</br>  <br>Who cares if it's the "rules". Those stupid rules just block off this site from getting better members</br>  <br>I hated Sogeking, stupid coward should of just admitted he fagged out over Merry (the whole saying bye to going merry thing, was the worst part of OP for me, and made me really hate Ussop) everything else was eh. I'm just a shallow dude, and his nose fucking bugs me.</br>  Fuuuuck, so much camaraderie  <br>So you admit to be underage?</br>  <br><br> underaged b&amp; <br> better members </br></br></br>  <br>And as I'm saying right now <br>Just Fuck off</br></br>  <br>Fuck off feminazi</br>  <br>I think it's a bit of everything.</br>  <br>read the rules first</br>  <br>That's most likely it. I guess I've not yet seen him do the same crazy shit the others did.</br>  <br>Being a feminazi is better than being a tripfag</br>  <br>Yea, it was kinda refreshing and shit was hilarious.<br><br><br> I'm just a shallow dude <br>Well, at least you said it and not me. To each their own, I suppose.</br></br></br></br></br>  can a mod just delete this thread please  <br>You know it's tru</br>  <br>Not me, when i meet a fellow good looking dude (to help me pick up sluts), that's way to cocky, and has a sick sense of humor like me, we insta best bros.</br>  <br>Sorry Billy just cause you don't like some thing doesn't mean other people feel the same way</br>  <br>I admit to being a better member</br>  <br>and with this you admitted to be underage. Thanks.</br>  <br> tripfag <br>well at least I'm not a homophobe like you</br></br>  <br> Sovereign Haki <br>This is the one thing that kinda irks me about the Coloured ones.

The "good or "bad" was just extra fyi i threw in there.</br></br></br>  <br> moar <br>Do you have a problem with fucking spelling?</br></br>  <br>Ah, I guess it's a personality thing.

Also he was controlled by doffy in last chapters cover. Where do we go from here?</br>  <br> putting up a different mask every time I hang out with my 'friends'. <br>I don't make the effort to act sociable every time I'm with my friends, only for first impressions, and when we go out and meet strangers. They don't seem to mind the difference, except when I'm just to tired to pretend to be outgoing, and we're around some hot bitches and they wanna get laid. Then they get a little but hurt I'm not being a good "wing man" but they get over it.</br></br>    <br>I disagree, they are implied to be the best. Sanji was outright the best cook on the baratie, Nami has some kind of ability to predict weather (shown) and the ability to literally control it</br>  <br>Pfft, as if. Oda confirmed that Buggy would just run away like the shit God that he is, if his whole crew got trapped in the Bird Cage.<br><br><br> same coat as Donflamingo <br>I don't think Doffy owns the rights to fur coats, Anon. Doffy might have supplied the alliance with the weapons or something though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I honestly look a lot like law. I have the physique and face. But I don't have the devil fruit lol</br>  <br>I thought Oda just confirmed that he could freely enter and exit.</br>  <br>Huh. Well, as long as it works then I guess there's no problem, right ? Keep being you, whenever you can bruh. Enjoy the bitches, as it were.</br>  <br>O: You're right, he would--.<br><br>Even if you put him in the bird cage with his crewmates, he'd still escape by himself!<br><br>Buggy is no God of mine, I tell you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>couldn't figure out all who was on the floor, thanks</br>  <br>Hehe I'm more of a lucky roo <br>If you know what I mean</br></br>  <br>IMO, the chapters between Thriller Bark and Kuja Island were the best part of one piece. All the revelations and the crew interaction, only to be broken by OP enemies was a very good wrinting by Oda.</br>  <br>Message me</br>  <br> Best navigator in the world outright <br>Not sure about this hyperbole, but just compare her to the Heart Pirates shitty navigator. Luffy definitely lucked out with Nami as his crew's navigator.</br></br>  <br>What ? The guy is a shit cartographer but I don't see how that makes him a shit Navigator. Law's crew survived all this time and they did pretty well, considering they're in a sub.</br>  <br>Of course</br>  Luffy and Zoro sure are like-minded idiots<br>1/2</br>  <br><br><br>don't have to worry about storms or weather too much when you travel underwater</br></br></br>  <br><br>Probably have to have knowledge of currents + subterrain though.</br></br>  <br>2/2</br>  <br>still doesn't seem like it would be as treacherous</br>  <br>Water currents and shit though ? Still doesn't make him a shitty Navigator especially since we haven't seen him do his shit above water.</br>  Am I the sole Tashigifag here?  <br>p-pics or it didn't happen.</br>  <br><br> get sucked monstrous current <br> get crashed into the seafloor/underwater ridge <br> etc. <br><br>It's pretty treacherous - I think FI showed that - you'd have to have a certain level of knowledge not to get rekt.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fattys are scum, kill thyself.</br>  <br><br>Not to mention, depending on how deep you are, you are instantly fucked if you crash or something happens. Above the sea, you can still float around and be rescued.</br></br>  <br><br>I don't know why, but when I see pages of FI, it looks great and fun, but when I read/watched it as it came out, neither was enjoyable. The arc had too little happening for its length, and the antagonists were too little of a threat and did almost nothing before the final conflict. It should have had more SoL days, and after that all the conflict with Hody, also I felt Vander Decken was misused. I guess I'll have to reread it soon, it's been years after all.</br></br>  <br>i hope so. preferably next chapter.</br>  <br><br>Zoro was luffy's first nigga, so they had to bond.<br><br>Then again, Zoro respects Luffy's strength and conviction most of all.<br><br>He would never listen to anyone who was below him, look with all his crew interactions, he tends to reply while pissed off or at least disgruntled.<br> captain autismo <br><br>This is never the case with luffy unless luffy fucks up and hurts zoro with his shenanigans, he also has some nice interaction with Usopp.<br><br>Luffy offers the best opportunities for zoro to become the best swordsman.<br>It's also convenient that his crew is based on very few but highly specialized people.<br><br>They are both interested in becoming their respective best, and they encourage each other all the time to get there, what's not to BRO UP?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SoL ?</br>  <br>Man, I fucking love Luffy and Zoro.</br>  <br>Shanks won't kill him though, just humiliate him and the other silly little kids, then offer them a drink, and to party together. Based Shanks man, i tell ya.</br>  <br>Slice of Life, the usual antics going on in an arc before conflict starts, like going around in Water 7 in Yagara Bulls, meeting the shipwrights, using dials in Skypiea, I felt there was too little of all of that.</br>  <br>I know, it was just a little joke. Shanks is just gonna CoC all the fodder and leave the 4 Supernova's untouched and just stare at them with a little smile. 4 Family men will be born that day.<br><br><br>Ah, right, okay. I wasn't sure that SoL meant but I gotcha.</br></br></br></br>  <br>mmkay, i guess i get it. No, I'm not the original guy you were talking to, i was just trying to correct your definition of racism.</br>  <br>oh, can you believe some nigga actually think kid's groups has a chance of taking on Shanks? Unbelievable people that stupid can even read.</br>  <br>Never say never. Oda can make Kidd's Alliance as strong as he bloody wants. He's shown absolutely nothing of them since the TS and I think it's for a reason. <br><br>Of course, Personally I think they stand no chance cause, you know, it's fucking Shanks.</br></br></br>  <br>Traveling by sub is way more dangerous than by boat in real life.</br>  <br>Because for the 100th time, Akainu does not appoint the admirals, that's Kong.</br>  <br> Never say never <br>NEVER!! I would bet my left nut (if it was worth it) They won't beat Shanks. There's a small chance they might put up a good fight, but i seriously doubt it. <br>Just use your common sense dude, how story wise would Shanks getting done in by some rookie this late in the game, before meeting up with Strawhats, make any sense. God, some people are retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>It's okay bro, most people are just really stupid.</br>  cute  <br>that shits gayer then two bears in leather chaps pounding the living hell out of each other.

They already had this talk about keeping secrets and shit.  <br> the music is just unbearable for me <br>So you are one of those homosexuals then?</br></br>  3 eps in and it's already so much better than G was. FIS trio became great instead of just ok, dolls are fun, Carol has some weird problems but she's cute and it will be really hard to do something worse than mid-late G where villains were fighting each other for some dumb reasons. I'm lovin' it.    <br>Then don't watch it. /a/ isn't your blog.</br>  <br>Sick nightcore remix bro.</br>  <br>Well, there was only one human villain this time.

Elf Nine, with alchemy magic, or will they go to Dr. Ver to fix them?  <br>Fixed.</br>  <br>It's pretty much un-noticable in the first episode, but side by side it's definitely visible in the second.<br><br>Top is HS, bottom is commie.</br></br></br>  <br> wanting Shirabe to sneeze on Kirika's vagina <br>Gross.</br></br>  <br>I'll take niptext over shit quality encode any day.</br>  <br> will they go to Dr. Ver to fix them? <br>The fact that this possibility exists means that it has to happen.</br></br>  <br>I don't understand how they can break. I thought the symphogears were just shards of complete relics that are brought to full power with phonic gaim. <br>Why would it matter if a shard gets cracked? <br><br>Hibiki used shards of Kanade's armor to turn into gungnir.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The quality of the HS rip was better than that of commie, but commie's subs were better imo. Your call either way.<br><br><br>Totally Ver. It makes the most sense especially considering he was also able to make customised linker.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon, those pink crystals were what made the whole system works. The relic is probably as small as atom now.<br><br>As for Hibiki, she literally fused with Gungnir.</br></br></br>  <br>Someone probably can drop a keyword on this, but even based on this episode you can understand how it works. The pendant itself isn't the relic, it has a shard inside, while the pendant is like a mechanism allowing the user to use it and transform. Arcanoise damaged the mechanism, leaving the shard intact, but without a way to access its power.</br>   Dainsleif <br> Dainsrave <br>Tis' a prophecy</br></br>  <br>My waifu isn't from symphogear.<br><br>There's still no Ver.</br></br></br>     That beef stroganoff song. <br>Literally what.</br>  <br>I think you meant "Literally perfection".</br>  So what's your dream Symphogear episode? Here's mine:<br>Tsubasa gets a booty call from Maria to meet her at the concert arena. She gets there, turns out it was Carol and the concert organizers using a voice modifier. All of the Autoscorers are there too. They've stolen all of her swords and they tell her she has to follow all their instructions and whatever happens to her she has to act like she enjoys it. If she doesn't, they will break all of her swords and get their concerts canceled.<br><br>So the next day, Tsubasa walks into a room wearing diapers and a pacifier, acting like a retarded baby. All of the Autoscorers are there and they give her the hardest, most brutal gangrape in history. As instructed, Tsubasa acts like she completely enjoys it and asks for more.<br>Then in walks that guy Dr. Ver from season 2. Turns out he joined the Autoscorers for revenge. He's been eating a special protein-only diet for weeks just for this. He pulls down his pants and partially defecates the longest, thickest, hardest log ever, and proceeds to use it to give Tsubasa the most furious ass-to-ass action ever recorded. Tsubasa can't hold her tears anymore, but pretends they're from pleasure. It's finally over.<br><br>Then Carol reveals the room they're in is actually see through from the outside, and they're in the concert arena. All of the audience has been watching Tsubasa get gangbanged and enjoy it, and it's been broadcasted worldwide. They finally kick her out of the premises, and break all of her swords anyway.<br><br>Later, Tsubasa runs into Maria, who tells her she didn't know she was such a straight CIS scum. Her lolis walk in and proceed to have passionate sex with her in front of Tsubasa, and after they finish, pee all over Tsubasa, much to Maria's delight<br><br>After the ending credits, Tsubasa is wandering off on a road in the middle of nowhere. A speeding car runs her over and breaks her spine, but it's non lethal. She is left laying there in extreme pain for days, and finally dies of hunger.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Seriously?

HS video with Commie or H&amp;D subs?</br>  Is it bad I'm really wanting to skip through all this hibiki drama?<br><br>I mean I'm sure it makes sense or whatever but I've kind of had enough of depressed Bikki by this point.<br><br>It's gotten boring and I'd rather people like Maria or Chris get more focus.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 'sup Dr.Ver <br> go away <br> I need you to make more Linker stuff <br> fuck off <br> I'll let you take credits for your assistance in subduing alchemists and saving the world, you will become an hero <br> ok, when do I start? <br><br>that was easy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think anyone in the show is naive enough to trust him. Not even Hibiki.</br>  <br>Let him breed with Maria, that way she'd finally have a use.</br>  <br>Sakimori wouldn't let that happen.</br>  <br>Why do I have this sinking feeling that this is word-for-word the plot outline for episode 7?</br>  <br>I don't find that opinion unreasonable.I am a Bikki/Aoifag myself but most of G was already focused on Bikki's character.<br>They already mentioned that every character will have an arc and there will be plenty of FIS focus, so there is that.</br></br>  <br> VLC <br> Hyphens for emphasis <br>Oh boy.</br></br></br>  <br>Or you just tell him that the current mission is to bully a loli, he will probably like that</br>  <br>Give it a few episodes, it's probably gonna be critical to the plot.<br><br>That said, I'm tired of Hibiki as well. Chris, despite hardly even saying anything this episode, stood out because those very words showed that her head is in the right place. Her and DMJii, of all the people, being the most reasonable and sane is really weird, but I'm liking it quite a bit.</br></br></br>  Is Anime-chan straight?  <br>You sure proved his point wrong, anon.</br>  <br>Kill yourself, Lelouch.</br>  <br>What point? That he's an idiot?</br>  <br><br> Give it a few episodes, it's probably gonna be critical to the plot. <br><br>I know, but it's just Hibiki was so great at the ends of S1 and S2 that seeing her going through more of this awkward "I can't do anything" shit rubs me the wrong way. It's frustrating.<br><br>I'm really really hoping that next week they surprise me and she gets her mojo back somehow early but I seriously doubt it.<br><br>I'd be satisfied if berzerker mode activates though, that'd be fine.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Hibiki feeling bad for a total of 1 and a half episode <br> WHEN WILL THIS DEPRESSION ARC BE OVER MAN SHE SHOULD JUST PUNCH SHIT AND EVERYTHING WILL BE DAIJOBU <br><br>These are probably the exact same people that bitched about Simon being depressed when Kamina died.</br></br></br>  <br> Hibiki has been dealing with these feelings for over 25 episodes now, and despite all that she's been through it all comes to a head in the worst way possible <br>Yes, that's bad.</br></br>  <br><br>dude you know she's going to be useless for half the show right<br><br>that's how this shit goes</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the thing though - G in itself had poor writing, and people misrepresenting Hibiki because of their poorly formed perceptions from G is exactly why they're so upset right now.<br><br>Her conversation with Maria made it clear that she never grew up at all. All she did was teach Maria how to hold hands, yet somehow people are misrepresenting that and the entire end of G as Hibiki somehow 'evolving' into a mere hotblooded punch vending machine.</br></br></br>  <br>Symphogear simply doesn’t have time for that. We have arcs for all characters and Hibiki has to have some berserk time too, that’s not a lot of screen time spread across 13 episodes.</br>  <br>IMO resolving all drama in one episode would be kinda stupid. What about switching focus to DMJii, so Hibiki can spend some time thinking about her reason to fight and why it's stupid to be depressed over her dad when Genjuro is better dad than anyone could be. Then we get Training Montage and everything is Fine again. <br><br><br> Hibiki has been dealing with these feelings for over 25 episodes now <br><br>This is exactly why it's good she can't sing now. She was running away from problem for two season, hiding behind her friends and sometimes throwing a punch or two. It's now time she finally finds her determination, so we will never have to see depressed Hibiki again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I do hope Maria uses Gugnir next ep.  <br>Would she get a new song or will it be KORT EL FES GUNGNIR again?</br>      <br>This. I wonder if it's because of the director change.</br>  <br> This is exactly why it's good she can't sing now. She was running away from problem for two season, hiding behind her friends and sometimes throwing a punch or two. It's now time she finally finds her determination, so we will never have to see depressed Hibiki again. <br>It shouldn't take that long for her to actually listen to her friends and to actually learn something from her experiences.</br></br>  <br> IMO resolving all drama in one episode would be kinda stupid. What about switching focus to DMJii, so Hibiki can spend some time thinking about her reason to fight and why it's stupid to be depressed over her dad when Genjuro is better dad than anyone could be. Then we get Training Montage and everything is Fine again.  <br><br>But we've done this shit alreadyyyy<br><br>we've had two seasons of this alreadyyy<br><br>why can't we have a fucking curveball please???</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop posting like a fucking retard.</br>  <br>2ch are a bunch of retards that by shit like Infinite Stratos by the tens of thousands.<br><br>All of the people in that post needed copious amounts of fisting before they became friends, and on top of them Ver never became their friend. Her belief that "I can totally just talk it out peacefully" has never once actually worked.</br></br></br>  <br>The 11 literally explains that was at the end, after the character received a massive ass kicking and had no other choice but to listen. Fine didn't change her mind until she was 10 seconds from dying.</br>  <br> Feelings can't be bottled up and come out at inopportune moments <br><br>Hibiki was always naive as fuck about these things. Her ideals have been consistent as fuck though. "We should talk things out and everything will be fine" has been said throughout the entire show. In season two she goes out of her way to try to save the FIS girls and I don't think she actually hit anyone seriously besides the noise and that relic eater thing.<br><br>She's been hiding her problems for over two seasons as well. All she would do would laugh shit off and pretend everything is ok. Why do you think Miku is getting irritated every time she blew shit off like her abusive dad being a shit and leaving forever? Why do you think she blew shit off like literally having relic cancer?<br><br>Hibiki likely thinks her problems are invalid and doesn't actually talk through them. While simultaneously thinking that every problem can be talked through. Which is absolutely insane. <br><br>There's also the fact we've never had significant development for Hibiki at all. Tsubasa had season one and Chris had season 2. This is Hibiki's season.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>nooooooooooooo</br></br>  Why is Hibiki always such a cunt to poor Miku  <br> Feelings can't be bottled up and come out at inopportune moments <br> Miku has been telling Hibiki not to fucking do that since season 1 <br>She tries to get through to everyone and make them understand what she feels, but the most important person to her tells her to let her own feelings out so others can help her and she reacts in the worst way possible constantly? That's a shit character. "People have emotions and do stupid things" doesn't excuse inconsistent writing when every other character developed over time but Hibiki just kept going backwards.</br></br></br>  <br> Chris had season 2 <br><br>Uh, did she? I totally didn't notice.</br></br></br>  WHEN WILL NANA SING ENKA AGAIN?  <br> Ver never became their friend <br>You can thank Ver taking away the only thing she had in the world (the ability to hold hands), Berserk Hibiki's regenerative ability and the circumstances surrounding the Gungnir Cancer for that. Ver is the exception to the norm, not the norm, and she didn't have to learn a thing from that.</br></br>  <br>Did you somehow missed the 4th episode and her whole endgame play?</br>  <br><br>That's not the whole season though. That's like, an ep and a bit.</br></br>  <br>And Ver was ultimately not dealt with by Hibiki, Genjuro and Ogawa did that. <br><br><br>Not until she pulled down the moon fragment potentially killing humanity which was entirely Hibiki’s fault since she just had to rescue her instead of killing her along with Nehushtan. Somehow the show completely ignores this though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because she is a bad and unhealthy person, and for good reason given the shit she went through. It's not shit writing, it's people having no idea what she's supposed to be like because they have no idea how to interpret the events of G.<br><br>Not even several years of support can make up for that. Tsubasa's BSOD lasted at least 2/3 of that, and she's not as unhealthy as Hibiki.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know what's inconsisent about not wanting the person closest to you not to worry. It's contradicting as fuck but it's hardly uncommon.</br>  <br> they have no idea how to interpret the events of G. <br>and that happens because G was messy as fuck. You can't deny that.</br></br>  <br>Chris stopped being anti-social and learned to trust Tsubasa as a senpai. Now she aspires to be a cool senpai like Tsubasa.<br><br>So yeah, she did have season 2<br><br><br>Hibiki is kind of a shit yeah. Even with season one all she learned to do was not lie to Miku about what she's doing. But she never learned to stop lying to Miku about her feelings. Miku knows about the missions now, but about how Hibiki feels about them? Shit all. Hence we're going back to the "my problems are invalid" issues.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To your credit, I fully agree, but there is enough that can be interpreted from it to make Hibiki's current situation decently understandable and sound from a writing perspective.</br>  <br><br>Even ignoring G, this is stupid as fuck. <br>Hibiki learned to not be a baby in season 1 when standing around uslessly almost got Tsubasa killed. She trained with Genjurou to be a fighter. <br><br>Next time she encountered Chris, she had no problems knocking the shit out of her to make her calm down so she would be willing listen.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even if it's understandable and sound, it is not necessarily what people want to watch.</br>  This scene is probably one of main reasons current events feel out of place for some people. It's hard to notice Hibiki is insane and thinks she has no value if she can't throw away her life when she's manly and awesome as fuck. As much as I love it, it shouldn't happen back then, but later this season.  By the way guys.<br>Where did Maria get that second Gungnir in the first place? You know, back in G.</br>  <br>I guess that was because they didn't expect the show to get a second season.</br>  <br>Probably just a different part of the relic.</br>  <br>Fine made a second Gungnir and gave it to FIS.</br>  <br> Next time she encountered Chris, she had no problems knocking the shit out of her to make her calm down so she would be willing listen. <br>This is my main issue with this development. As a followup from G, I get it, but it just feels inconsistent.</br></br>  <br>It’s worse than that, Miku only knows about the missions because she found out by chance. Hibiki wouldn’t have told her jack shit.</br>  <br>Well, they only need a little piece of relic to make a symphogear. It's not impossible to make hundreds of Gungnir.</br>  <br>I'm sure by episode 7 at the latest, she will be punching things bigger than mountains. She's just going through a phase right now, and once she's snapped out of it, I'm sure she'll finally have found a good reason to fight.<br>I'm rooting for you Hibiki.</br></br>  <br>symphogear is part of a relic, if the Gungnir Spear was broken in 1000 pieces, there can be 1000 gungnir symphogear</br>  <br>We already know that that's most likely going to be the case given the OP. The real question is what's going to happen before then.</br>  <br>And G was a logical continuation. At the start of G when they thought Maria was Fine, Hibiki was upset because she thought Fine learned her lesson. <br><br>Genjurou explained that it doesn;'t matter. They just need to keep fighting until Fine remembers what she learned. Hibki agreed. <br><br>Hibiki wants to be friends, but she isn't retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They could mass produce Gungnirs from Hibiki's crystal cancer.</br>  <br>She'll wield Danslief.</br>  <br>I don't think the cancer is a valid part of gungnir is probably corrupted useless relic material, the core of Hibiki was the part that broke off Kanade's</br>  <br> You don't have to learn from things if they don't coincide with your views <br>Stupidest thing I've ever read.</br></br>  <br> Hibiki learned to not be a baby in season 1 when standing around uslessly almost got Tsubasa killed. She trained with Genjurou to be a fighter.  <br>But that’s just it. She physically trained to be a fighter but got zero psychological development. She could only hit Chris because she believed she could talk to her afterwards. The point of the dolls is that they cannot be reasoned with, and that’s why Hibiki breaks down. She broke down in similar situations during G and never psychologically overcame that either, unless you call going berserk from Gungnir fragments character development.</br></br>  <br>Not before at least briefly getting Gungnir to respond to her again unless the OP is a massive bait&amp;switch. The second part of G-Beat is already a sign that she'll quickly learn to get past her current conundrum.</br>  We are still really in the air about how will season develop.<br>We should get by around midway through. So episode 7.</br>  I'm just sad that we can't have berserk hibiki because what caused it was the part inside her.  <br> unless the OP is a massive bait&amp;switch <br>Bet on it.</br></br>  デスデスデース  <br>Yep, that's what I'm thinking will happen as well, but we don't know that yet.</br>  <br> Because she is a bad and unhealthy person, and for good reason given the shit she went through. It's not shit writing, <br>Except it is. When you stack her up next to other characters who have been through arguably worse things who all eventually learned from the people around them and their experiences, then you have Hibiki herself preach friendship and progress to them but doesn't follow a single bit of that advice then she's a poorly written character.<br><br><br> Hibiki is kind of a shit yeah <br>I could deal with it up until now, but the way it was handled this week was fucking horrible. That shit about the knife actually made me want to slap her.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm afraid of what might happen in episode 7.</br>  <br>Let's talk more about our goddess, /a/. I'm sure Hibiki will solve her own problem.</br>  <br>I think for Hibiki, it's hard to fight other people without knowing exactly why it is they must fight. With this, she doesn't know why Carol and the dolls are doing any of this, whether they can reasoned with. There's too many unknowns, and now there's also the pressure of being the only one who can fight.</br>  <br>Maybe sticking the relic directly into her chest will bring back good memories.</br>  <br> my waifu and my preferred fightan game characters are polar opposites <br><br>please don't make me choose</br></br></br>  <br> She could only hit Chris because she believed she could talk to her afterwards <br>This is a nice fan fiction, but there was literally nothing implying any of that, unless Hibiki was a mind reader. <br><br>Carol showed more emotion than Chris did by crying. Chris was just an arrogant bitch at the start.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Being a hypocrite isn't poor writing though. This is why it's Hibiki's season to develop, she's going to learn it's not ok to be a hypocrite when it comes to her own feelings</br>  <br>People learn and evolve from their circumstances differently. All it shows is that Chris and DMJii are much more mentally strong than Hibiki, which, in Chris's case, was already obvious.<br><br> then you have Hibiki herself preach friendship and progress to them but doesn't follow a single bit of that advice <br>"Do as I say, not as I do" is a thing for a damn good reason. Some people genuinely are like that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They really should've picked Sumire for Kirika.</br>  When will people finally realize that Hibiki is shit and Chris is god-tier waifu.   Episode 7 <br> 7 <br> Nana <br>Holy shit.</br></br></br>  <br> Being a hypocrite isn't poor writing though. <br>Writing a character to be able to skate by and appear to learn things then turning around and dropping all these things on us at once is bad writing. <br><br><br> People learn and evolve from their circumstances differently. <br>That's the problem, she hasn't learned at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I knew that as soon as chris fought on screen in her own gear.<br><br>Genki a shit.</br></br></br>  <br> This is a nice fan fiction <br>Sure thing bud.</br></br>  <br>Reminder that Kiri-chan is best girl.</br>  <br> Nana said she'd scream a lot <br> Kaneko said producers were angry because he went too far <br>Hold me /a/. I'm scared.</br></br></br>  <br> When will people finally realize that ... Chris is god-tier waifu. <br>Boy have I got some news for you.</br></br>  <br>I was talking about the part where she only punched Chris with a rocket punch after this conversation because a secret psychic link let her know she could talk after, unlike with Carol.</br>  <br><br> New OP sequence <br> It's wasn't Berserkbikki or Dainsleif Bikki in the title logo. <br> It's Carol. The scarf was actually hair. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Tsubasa is screaming because Maria is having her way with her.<br>Producers are mad because you can't show that kind of thing on TV.</br></br>  <br>Who liked her before this episode here? I can never rewatch S1 because she isn't in it.</br>  <br>Please, my heart.</br>  What if anime-chan becomes the new user of Gungnir?  O TO KO NO KO WA<br>SHI RA NA I KE DO~</br>  <br>I could never pick a best geah but she always was in my top tier with Chris and Bikki</br>  <br>She never "appeared" to learn things. That was your perception. At the end of season one she still didn't talk about her own feelings, she only learned to be considerate of other people's feelings.<br><br>At the end of G she was still pretty static leaving off from season one. She still thought people can be reasoned with, she still thought her problems were invalid. <br><br>Going into the beginning of this season, it's still consistent. She never learned to be open with her own feelings. Again, Hibiki had never had any significant psychological development in the previous seasons before.<br><br>In season 1, most of the development was with Tsubasa. In season 2 it was Chris. This season is for Hibiki.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If Hibiki's retarded "muh ideals" drama takes time away from what could be used as another Chris episode like episode 4 of G, I'm going to be fucking mad.<br><br>If Hibiki's retardation gets Chris killed in episode 7, I'll kill Hibiki myself.</br></br>  <br>Fund it.</br>  <br> She never "appeared" to learn things. That was your perception <br>She saw first hand that she needed to fight AND use her words instead of babbling like an idiot to get through to people. This is not my perception, this is what happened in the show.</br></br>  <br>I liked her since the beginning. Too bad her G henshin sucked balls.<br><br>They kinda pay the price here though.</br></br></br>  <br>#1 from the start for me. Dumb as she may be, she's fun without having the problems that define Hibiki as being unhealthy as fuck, and her chemistry with Shirabe is great, especially now that they're both developing as characters. I also found her paranoia in G to be surprisingly interesting.<br><br>S1 was still much better than G though.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, I didn’t write anything about knowing, this is entirely your fanfiction. This is not about her knowing it, it’s about her believing in it. Just rewatch that fight, she is absolutely convinced she’d be able to talk to Chris, yet the dolls and carol managed to make her waver in her belief. I agree that the latter could have been handled better, but it’s completely in line with previous seasons.</br>  <br> How did she become so lewd? <br>are you complaining?</br></br>  <br> #1 from the start for me. <br> from the start </br></br>  <br>I'm not complaining in the slightest. It's just she was so unsexy in G.</br>  <br>Hibiki clearly tried to talk things out beforehand, but she wasn't about to sit there and get beaten up, she was too manly back then. But she wasn't going to kill her either, that should be clear.</br>  <br>I've had that shit looping for literally hours.<br>Just kill me.<br><br><br> unsexy <br>kirikatummy.jpg</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then we'll see a Symphogear version of God Finger.</br>  <br>Someone linking the fanmade DMJii duet while G was airing was the reason why I picked up the show in the first place. I knew nothing about Hibiki&amp;co. before that.</br>  <br>Are you by chance gay?</br>  <br>And she did try to fight once the doll started to attack them with noise. The thing with Carol was also mental, because of her daddy issues. <br><br>She can't transform because of her mental issues.</br></br></br>  <br><br>She's a stupid dumbass and her partner's a hypocrticial edgelord.<br><br>They both suck and are the worst characters.</br></br></br></br>  <br>When did this happen, though?<br>She hit Chris one time and spent the rest of the fight running away.<br>She never laid a single finger on any member of FIS.<br>If anything her perception that problems can be resolved by just talking and holding hands has been consistently validated.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Tsubasa slowly slips back into edge and TSURUGI because she lost Ame no Habakiri. Maria eventually gets sick of it and locks themselves into a room for a whole day and has her way with her. When they finally get out again Tsubasa is mellowed out and soft like pudding.</br></br>  <br>How does it feel to have such shit tastes?</br>  <br>Holy shit that handholding should have been censored. Not sure why I couldn't see nipples though.</br>  <br> And she did try to fight once the doll <br>Why did she hesitate? She knows talking never works and she knows her friends are there and in danger. Everything that happens from here on out is 100% her fault.<br><br><br> problems can be resolved by just talking and holding hands has been consistently validated. <br>Please tell me a single time that she just stood there without her gear on talking to somebody and it got through to them without any sort of physical confrontation.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> edgelord <br><br><br>Fair enough.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait for Symphogear the Movie G's</br>  <br>She hesitated because she thought it would work. The doll is working through Carol and she probably feels that Carol might be listening in there somewhere. <br><br>Once it didn't work she tried to fight and that also didn't work because there's a mental block. You're acting like she broke down and cried like a baby in front of everyone instead of going straight to Gungnir once talking fell through.</br></br></br>  <br> She hesitated because she thought it would work <br>Why? It's literally never worked before.<br><br> You're acting like she broke down and cried like a baby in front of everyone instead of going straight to Gungnir once talking fell through. <br>But that's what happened. She lost her resolution and confidence. She's become such a wreck that Gungnir won't listen to her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Please tell me a single time that she just stood there without her gear on talking to somebody and it got through to them without any sort of physical confrontation. <br>She hasn't been entirely successful because other want to fight and aren't so easily talked down. She does minimize the fighting as much as she can though, and even Tsubasa learned from her and put down her sword against zerbiki in seaosn 1, which effictively cooled her down.<br>After trying to talk to her enemies, it shows them think about what Hibiki said and reflect on their lives, and this brings them closer to the befriending in the end. Reminder that she succeeded in even winning over Fine in the last moment.</br></br></br>  <br> Please tell me a single time that she just stood there without her gear on talking to somebody and it got through to them without any sort of physical confrontation. <br><br>When she tried to talk to Maria but Maria didn't listen so she took the Gear instead?<br><br>The other times she just stood there in her gear because there were noise in the area. But she never attacked any of the FIS girls out right. <br><br><br>That's not what happened. The chant didn't resonate with her because Gungnir rejected her. She broke down AFTER it rejected her not before.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tell me a single time that she fought somebody and it got through to them.<br> Chris just fucks off after Fine dumps her <br> Hibiki didn't actually hit Fine outside of berserker mode and Synchrogazer, and even then she was trying to pretty much destroy the world <br> DMJii and Maria eventually join Hibiki's side without Hibiki ever hitting them once, in fact saving their lives at least once. <br><br>Many of the times when Hibiki already had her gear on, it was because of nearby Noise. When she fought Chris, she transformed so that she could protect Miku from a flying car. The only two times Hibiki transformed with the direct purpose of 1v1ing somebody was against Fine and against Miku.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Love is not over!   <br>That's a nice rant, but you still haven't actually answered my question. All you did was talk in circles and try to rationalize her stupidity.<br><br><br> When she tried to talk to Maria but Maria didn't listen so she took the Gear instead? <br>So the one time she talked without a gear and it worked was the one time she literally didn't have a gear, and that ended with her forcibly stealing a gear.<br><br> She broke down AFTER it rejected her not before. <br>No, her mental deterioration is why Gungnir rejected her in the first place.<br><br><br> Tell me a single time that she fought somebody and it got through to them. <br>I literally never said that. In fact, I've literally said that a combination of talking and fighting is what worked in every case.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So what's your dream Symphogear episode? <br>S3 e1. The only thing that could make it better if hibiki wasn't a bitch.</br></br>  When are we going to get hot blooded Hibiki punching the shit out of Carol?   Tsubasa, will you call me "Onee-chan"?   <br>Never</br>  <br> Hibiki didn't actually hit Fine outside of berserker mode and Synchrogazer, and even then she was trying to pretty much destroy the world <br>More than that, Hibiki actually rescued Fine from her Nehushtan fusion. Fine could only pull the moon fragment down because of that.</br></br>  <br>Wait, what's gonna happen ep 7?</br>  <br>I guess you are right. Maybe if they went into more detail about what they are feeling. <br>There is the random shit about her dad. There is the implication that she feels different now that she isn't physically fused with gungnir.<br><br>Since they didn't go into detail about anything though, it seemed like she is just being a baby.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Group song <br> Chris surfing on a missile with her arms crossed <br> Destroy the mountain <br> Suplex a spaceship <br> SoL with pajama party <br> Jesus duet <br> G-Beat  <br>What a long way we've come since then. Thanks Hibiki.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Muh Sakimori.</br>  <br>Except only Fine was arguably gotten through to after any fighting at all, Chris mostly defected because Fine dumped her, Hibiki was willing to help her fight Noise and because of Genjuro's concerns for her.<br><br>And again, Hibiki never fought FIS. Not a single time. The only reason she had her gear on in any encounter with them was because there was also Noise nearby.<br><br>Hibiki has never ever wanted to fight human or humanoid opponents. She will always, always try to talk to them first. The point is that Hibiki's ideals are insane and this is the very first time that her faith has been challenged, she has no reason to believe that it shouldn't work now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Compared to the other gear-users, she is.</br>  <br>The sword will break</br>  <br>But it already broke?</br>  Important thing is, since Hibiki is going to solve her own problems finally, what will happen in S4 to stop her from asspulling the shit out enemy before ep1 even airs? Someone steals her relic? Will she go on vacation with Miku? Or maybe she becomes Genjuro and can't do anything other than training new generation of Geahs?  <br> was arguably gotten through to after any fighting at all <br>Fighting happened, then words got through to them. This is objectively what happened in every single scenario bar none. Stop projecting your head canon over actual events to justify this shit.<br><br> she has no reason to believe that it shouldn't work now. <br>Except that they never worked in the past without fighting first.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tsubasa will regain Habakiri and shout SYMPHOOOOOGEEAAAAAAHHHHHHHH</br>  <br>The other sword.  The sheath was too tight. </br>  <br>S4  will never happen </br>  <br>S4, Hibiki is the enemy.</br>  I do not watch this show.<br><br>However the character designs have caught my eye. Give it to me straight, is Hibki best girl? Whether or not I watch this hinges on that.</br></br>  <br>But fighting never influenced why the other people joined in the first place. They always fucked off after the fight was over, they only gave it serious consideration after Hibiki or somebody else helped them in some way or the people they were working for turned out to not have their best interests at heart.</br>  <br>Go apologize to Nana now. What the fuck are you saying?</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Hibiki is voiced by Aoi Yuuki so she is best girl by default.</br>  <br>No. OP is best girl</br>  <br> is Hibki best girl? <br>Nope. That would be Yukine Chris: best girl in all of fiction.</br></br>  <br> But fighting never influenced why the other people joined in the first place. <br>Baseless speculation. They never were convinced with words alone. Not once. You can project all you want but it won't change the facts.</br></br>  <br>It's just plain ole Getter Robo having a love affair with Macross 7.</br>  <br><br>Yeah see it's that which caught my eye. Her hair and tits are great.</br></br>  <br>All girls are good, but I like Hibiki a bit more than the others outside of this most recent episode.</br>  <br>FIS<br>Again, Hibiki never fought them.<br>In fact, in a situation where she had an enormous advantage over them she chose instead to save their lives while putting her own in grave danger.</br></br></br>  <br>She's really fluffy. I bet she smell like strawberry</br>  <br> Again, Hibiki never fought them. <br> That means they never fought the heroes and Hibiki's words alone reached them <br>They still fought before words got through to them. Give me an example of someone Hibiki talked down and there was no fight with.</br></br></br>  <br>Her hair smells like  love. </br>  <br>She smells like Vitamin R.</br>  <br>Stop moving the goal post seriously.<br><br>First you asked for examples of people Hibiki herself didn't fight and now you're asking for examples of people that didn't fight Chris or Tsubasa as well? The point is Hibiki herself not fighting, the other character fights are irrelevant</br></br></br>  <br>They never fought Hibiki though.<br>And their fights with Tsubasa and Chris never convinced them of anything.<br>In fact the whole point of Kirika's story arc was that she should've sat down and talked to Shirabe about her problems instead of keeping them bottled up and fighting for retarded reasons, and it was this realization that made her join the good side. Trying to fight her problems out almost got Shirabe killed.<br><br>Meanwhile, Kirika joined the other side because she realized that the crazy man who was murdering innocent people with Noise probably didn't have their best interests at heart, and she was willing to talk to the 2nd Division rather than fighting them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you'll never roughly   sniff  her  hair <br>Why even live</br></br>  <br> Meanwhile, Shirabe joined the other side </br>  <br>All girls are best girls. They just take turn being best girl on a given episode.</br>  <br>Is literally said "Fighting happened, then words got through to them. "<br>You haven't addressed my point and now you're claiming I moved goalposts.<br><br><br> And their fights with Tsubasa and Chris never convinced them of anything. <br>Oh, that had no impact on anything? How do you know?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hair and tits <br><br>You forgot the best part</br></br></br>  <br>Yes. She is a miracle.</br>  <br> Is literally said  <br>I literally said*</br></br>  <br>The main point is that Hibiki still never fought any of them, and her words did get through to them.</br>   First on-screen yuri kiss stolen by dolls <br>Why?</br>  <br> fights Tsubasa and Chris in Episode 1 <br>Wow those guys are fucking monsters</br></br>  <br>It's just mana transfer</br>  <br>I'm hungry</br>  <br>No, that's what you're falling back on now that you realized you can't actually address my point. Her words have never reached someone before they fought the good guys. Not in season 1, not in G, and not now.</br>  <br>The real question is, why not?</br>  <br>dem puffy vulva</br>  <br>sex sells<br><br> omg how can she be so lewd! <br> wow what a slut <br> shes hot <br> shake that ass <br> would you a girl? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just the best.</br>  <br>Because everyone else is so gay that it feels wrong for them to get it first.</br>  <br>Stop that. You're making me lose the will to live.</br>  <br>and then preach about how the girl has to be a virgin despite all this sexual showboating<br><br>highly hypocritcal shit that devalues the show and women as a whole as a cheap tactic to raking in more money</br></br></br>  <br>You /u/fags should be glad that there's even one.</br>  <br> living <br>If you kill yourself now, when you reincarnate you'll be able to marathon the next 7 seasons and 3 movies.</br></br>  <br>Problem?</br>  <br>Wrong again, nerd.<br>It's the butt.</br></br>  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/</br>  <br>You honestly don't have any points and you keep repeating the same stuff that has been clarified by multiple people at this point. You keep arguing in the same circles and you keep getting the same answers that you'll never accept because you want to prove your headcanon of Hibiki being a manly fighting machine is more accurate than what has consistently been presented.<br><br>We may as well stop because you're still not getting it at all.</br></br></br>  <br> is Hibki best girl? <br>That's a funny way of spellin Tsubasa</br></br>  <br>Honestly you faggots should just wait for the next episode for another argument.</br>  <br>But if I can't reincarnate in Chris's world there's no point.</br>  <br> its tumblr now to point out how sexualized the anime industry is while putting a huge emphasis on "purity" </br>    <br>God damn how can one character be so fluffy, cute, and sexy at the same time?</br>  <br> miracles </br>  <br>TsubaMaria is GOAT</br>  <br> You honestly don't have any points and you keep repeating the same stuff that has been clarified by multiple people at this point. <br>I said that literally no one in this show has been convinced by words alone without some sort of fight. You tried arguing that and failed. You keep trying to talk in circles and failed. Hibiki's strategy is retarded because it has never fucking once accomplished anything. You have absolutely nothing to say that can go against that because I'm referencing what actually happened in the show and you're talking out of your ass while trying to sound like you're on the high ground. <br><br>You didn't make a point after trying to, and now you're backpedaling.

There was one thread before the subs even came out where people were having these discussions for the first time after the episode came out, and in this thread there was one guy who was very dedicated to arguing about how Hibiki was acting out of character this season.

I'm saying if "my" posting style is so obvious then it should be able to be spotted outside of any argument. <br>Yes, and I said that your positing style is similar to a handful of other anons whose first languages aren't English, and that unless we're on the topic of shipping it isn't really obvious which posts are yours. Hence me asking you which posts are yours out of curiosity.<br><br>No need to assume everyone is your enemy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She will though, that's what the lyrics of Little Miracle are about.</br>  <br>Let me see ya grit those teeth?<br><br>If I was Kanade, I would have mixed feelings about it. <br>On the one hand I'd be absolutely analocalypsed that I was stuck being useless and needing LiNKER just to get shit done. <br>On the other hand I'd be happy that my successor doesn't have to deal with the same bullshit I went through just to use a Symphogear<br><br>It's disappointing to an extent. People like Kanade have to work super hard and make up the difference in hard work and talent while people like Hibiki get an easier ride of it just for naturally having a high sync with the relic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;She will though, that's what the lyrics of Little Miracle are about. <br>Only after 12 episodes of ball crushing. No thank you.</br></br>  <br> but they've never been really challenged before <br>Except how they had to fight every single enemy before words reached them, and how they never broke through to Ver regardless of what methods they used. Her ideals only "worked" at the end when they all asspulled into X-drive and saved the world.</br></br>  <br>I miss Kanade</br>  I have the answer. <br><br>Hibiki was always an idiot that did not fight untilshe was pushed into a corner. This is the same as right now, she decided to fight when surrounded by corpses and when her friends were in danger. <br><br>But Gungir is a ferocious relic. It will probably only sync with someone that will fight without a second thought. Now that she isn't fused with it any more, it won't deal with her bullshit. <br><br>Hibiki didn't change at all to cause the song to not come out. How her gear works is what changed.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> All I'm saying is this guy was the spark for all the arguments that followed. <br>Or it could be the episode itself and people being mad at Biki.</br></br>  <br>Hibiki never had to fight though, and Ver was pretty obviously completely loco. <br>You could argue that fighting usually made things worse, actually.</br></br>  <br>Yes people agreed with him, I don't deny this. He still set the autistic tone of the discussion.</br>  <br> On the other hand I'd be happy that my successor doesn't have to deal with the same bullshit I went through just to use a Symphogear <br>I'd be furious that she didn't have the one thing that held me back and that her gift was wasted on someone without a shred of resolve.<br><br><br> Hibiki never had to fight though <br>She had to fight Chris, and there was still plenty of fighting with other enemies. Ver being crazy doesn't mean them not getting through to him didn't happen. It's just more proof that her ideals don't apply to every situation like she (incorrectly) believes they do.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see how it was autistic</br>  <br>Additionally, Gungnir was fused into Hibiki's heart, and probably responded unconsciously by bypassing Hibiki's mental attitude. Now that Gungnir is separate and has to be activated consciously, her mental block is what's interfering with the transformation.</br>  <br> I wish she'd learn from another mahou shoujo that we all know and love. <br>Even younger mahou shoujo waver less in their ideals than Hibiki.<br><br>Though, Hibiki being flawed as she is makes her more likable than another mahou shoujo I could name.</br></br></br></br>  <br> One poster set the tone for every argument because people are incapable of forming their own opinions or expressing them without someone to lead the pack <br>You don't make any sense.<br><br><br>Apparently paying attention to the show and actually talking about it like you care makes you autistic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Seeing your own autism is usually not easy.</br>  <br> but they've never been really challenged before. </br>  <br>Chris joining her side wasn't due to them fighting, though. <br>And they never event tried to reach out to Ver.</br></br>  <br>Hibiki fighting against Knight Blazer and then teaming up with him to defeat Ragu O Ragula</br>  <br>And then Tsubasa got wrecked without Hibiki laying a finger on her, and Tsubasa eventually mellowed out after a talk with her ghost girlfriend.<br><br>That's a win for Hibiki</br></br></br>  <br>Tsubasa then goes on to realize that fighting isn't the only thing that she can do and moves on from Kanade's death.</br>  <br><br>Tsubasa learns to accept hibiki, but she wasn't wrong in her criticism of her, and her words are still true to this day.</br></br>  <br> Chris joining her side wasn't due to them fighting, though. <br>But they needed to fight before her words ever had a chance at reaching Chris. Words alone didn't work on Chris.<br><br> And they never event tried to reach out to Ver. <br>No, they just couldn't do it. If the show spent more time with them trying it just would have made Hibiki being an idiot more apparent and her lack of learning on moving on even more grating than it already is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See, I don't see it that way. Yeah I'd be buttflustered that I got fucked by life but if someone out there who is willing to fight the noise is having an easier time of it because of random twist of fate then I'd be alright with that. <br><br>The person who succeeds me is going to need all the help they can get because they're not going to become better than me with just effort alone. <br>There would be no amount of effort they could put in which would outdo the effort I had to. <br><br> wasted on someone without a shred of resolve. <br>I disagree. She has the resolve but it's only against the Noise. When there is Noise, Hibiki is all up in that shit. <br>When it's against humans and Dolls (why?) then it's understandable that someone who heavily preaches talking it out and only fighting when talking fails wouldn't have the same resolve as when fighting the noise. <br>Hibiki just got blown the fuck out by both Carol and a Doll verbally, effectively beating her at her own game and they're the first people in the show to actively do it. <br><br>No wonder Hibiki is taking it so badly, she got blown the fuck out and can't get back up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This seems about right.<br>Wouldn't be surprised if it is the canon explanation at what is happening.</br></br>  <br>It has nothing to do with what Gungnir wants.She can't sing because all previous "fights" she had to do against her beliefs finally acumulated and she has enough of hurting others, especially Carol, who seems to be pretty hurt already.<br><br><br> She had to fight Chris, and there was still plenty of fighting with other enemies <br><br>Not really. She punched Chris once, then went full defence, then she saved her from Noise. Other fight were the same, amount of actual punching was always really low.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to see Hibiki talking with Gungnir.</br>  <br>If I didn't have to train all of my life and then got every major victory handed to me by deus ex machina and made friends with all of my former enemies, I wouldn't be too inclined to take things extremely seriously either.<br><br>Hibiki's ideals have always been vindicated eventually.</br></br></br>  <br> I disagree. She has the resolve but it's only against the Noise. When there is Noise, Hibiki is all up in that shit. <br>The problem is that the noise aren't the only thing that threaten innocent people, so her noise-specific resolve is still a lack of resolve in the grand scheme.</br></br>  <br>Not only that but all of the info she has on Carol is that maybe she had issues with her father, something that Hibiki can relate to and that leaves her feeling pretty weirded out about I guess</br>  <br> Not really. She punched Chris once, then went full defence, <br>Do you know what the word fight means?</br></br>  <br>Hibiki punched Chris once after a lot of whining in which she was defensive the whole time.<br>Hibiki would be done if it wasn't because Tsubasa.</br></br>  <br> She can't sing because all previous "fights" she had to do against her beliefs finally acumulated and she has enough of hurting others <br>I disagree. This explanation would be completely retarded because of the situation. If the set up was "kill a human or be killed" then it would make sense. <br><br>But in that exact moment where she tried to transform, she was just going to defended her friends from the arcanoise.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hibiki went on the defensive because she didn't know how to fight against rocket launcher/Gatling gun spam.</br>  <br>That's a fight you retard. She had to fight Chris before she could talk and get through to her.</br>  <br>Yeah but within the realms of Symphogear, the armour itself is an anti-noise weapon and Hibiki treats it as such. <br><br>It's a weapon used to protect people (from the noise) and it's that conflict which is messing her up internally. <br>The Relics have always been anti-Noise to Hibiki, I don't think she fundamentally grasps the situation she's in right now. <br><br>But I can still respect Hibiki's determination to not use an Anti-Noise weapon against a human if possible. <br>I'm guessing the reason she won't fight Dolls is because she's not used to comfortable with fighting human opponents even if they're fake humans. <br><br> inb4 the Dolls are actually revealed to be alive and Hibiki's reluctance is plot contrivance to keep her from needlessly harming humans. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  ITT : adaptations that surpass the source material    <br>I can't beat it, but I can certainly beat off to it.</br>  <br>I actually agree. The mango is good but the animu really gives it life, especially the battles where in the mango you can't really tell what's happening.</br>  Most 4-Koma adaptions.<br>You don't even have to really try, it's that awful of a format.</br>  <br>Disappearance Ponytail Haruhi is the only bearable Haruhi.</br>  Explain to me why Prisma Illya is in it's 3rd season while Tsukihime has yet to get an anime?  <br> there are actually people in the world right now who believe that any VN can have any literary credit, and that VNs can be compared on that basis </br>  <br> implying altrough is a loli </br>  <br>There isn't a single western fantasy novel that can even compare to Fate so yes, it's pretty damn great.</br>  <br>Fuck off /lit/, VNs are the pinnacle of literature and everything else is worthless trash.</br>  Because ufotable still has a lot of things to animate and TM probably doesn't want to be their own concurrent considering the remake should come out soon(tm).

It would still be interesting if Mangaka would introduce something new, but she's basically re-doing the first arc with new characters now. Characters that literally nobody gives a fuck about, that's why it's so boring now.<br><br>We won't have the same problem with JW, as it's based on comedy and character interactions - something that won't get boring anytime soon, especially now that they're dating.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I like how there was basically a chapter which was obviously a result of editor intervention where they just suddenly gave up the witch hunting.<br><br>Even the publishers knew the whole "new witches" thing was a cancer.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't remind me.
