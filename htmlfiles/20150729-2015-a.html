[ H-How? How can BONES make something this good? This is totally going against all the expectations. This adaptation has been fucking great so far. <br><br>Or were the expectations too low to begin with?</br></br>  <br> How can BONES make something this good? <br>Is this your first BONES show?</br></br>  <br>I expected absolutely fuckin nothing. It's not like BONES are bad tho, they are mostly &lt;in&gt;famous for their anime original stuff.</br>  <br> (You) </br>  This isn't really an unusual performance for Bones so far. It's the endings you have to watch out for.  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>I was expecting an Akatsuki no Yona clone so I was pleasantly surprised despite being repeatedly told that it was nothing like Yona.</br>  <br>She's so CUTE!</br>  <br>That's a big meme of its own</br>  <br>It's pretty fantastic. My only complaint is that they removed all the humor from Shirayuki's character, she's a bit too mellow. But other than that, it's beautiful and has a fantastic atmosphere.</br>  <br> How can BONES make something this good? <br>How can you watch a show that's retarded for not making an in-demand pharmacist make dyes to hide her hair?</br></br>  <br>It's okay. It's riddled with romance cliches, and it seems to be fine with that, but it's not very exciting.</br>  <br>This. There's got to be a bunch of explosions for my interest to be kept.</br>  <br> salty <br>I don't understand people who can bear to watch the same retarded romantic cliches every season and deceive the viewer about the female character's competence.</br></br>  <br>It's all about the execution of said cliches, which has been fine so far.<br> deceive the viewer about the female character's competence. <br>What?<br><br>Are you sure you're not the salty one?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't like when people deceive others so they'll watch their faggot show.<br> Shirayuki <br> competent <br>The guys always clean up after her ideas. How's that competent?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Who are you quoting?</br>  <br>yeah it's great, definitely AOTS.</br>  This series does things to my heartboner.  <br>explain further</br>  <br>I thought she was proud of her hair color even though she gets in trouble cause of it</br>  <br>His decisions and actions don't make her incompetent.</br>  It's not like BONES never made a good show, it's just that they've been struggling recently. <br><br>This is probably their best since E7, unless I'm speaking too soon</br></br>  <br><br>Darker than Black, FMA:B, and Tokyo Mag 8.0 were all in between now and E7. Otherwise I'd agree with you.</br></br>  <br>None of those were as good, I believe. Star Driver is in that area too and while I loved the show, I wouldn't call it good.</br>  <br><br> HEARTBONER </br></br>  <br>Maybe it has something to do with original material for adaptation?</br>  <br> FMA:B <br>That was terrible.</br></br>  I hope there isn't a lot of drama, I don't think I'd be able to continue watching if there was.  <br>I don't think this is bad, but I guess I'm missing whatever makes people love it so much. It's a bit overly dramatic/hammy for my tastes.</br>  <br>But this is BONES, who had the large potential for fucking it up.<br><br>As of yet, they've done quite the opposite</br></br></br>  Shirayuki a cute.  <br>Ouran came out right after E7 and this isn't quite as good as that yet.</br>  <br><br>It has good atmosphere. A lot of shoujo just run through the tropes and the setting is inconsequential or exists just to support the romance.<br><br>In this it feels like a living breathing world with plenty of characters who don't give a fuck about whether MC gets her prince or not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ouran was after E7?<br><br>I had thought it was older</br></br></br>  <br>I actually thought it was good, too. But then<br> Girl gets saved once an episode <br> Dialogue that would make Yahari's writer cringe <br> No attempt at romantic subtlety <br> Muh girl meets prince scenario </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Came out right when E7 ended</br>  <br>Are we talking about the same series?</br>  <br>aots</br>  This anime is making me wish for more herbalism/alchemy in anime, Atelier anime when  <br>It's like you didn't watch the last 3 episodes.</br>  <br>seems boring</br>  <br> I didn't watch it </br>  <br>But it would have cute girls doing cute things, like eating cake over a pot filled with dangerous bubbling liquids.</br>  <br>Not him, but I agree that the dialogue has been pretty bad. I could also do with fewer close-ups of people's faces looking determined while they're speaking or shocked while someone else is speaking.</br>  <br><br>wtf, what he described is exactly what happens.<br><br>sure she has this stupid "I'm a strong womyn, gon' get where I want by myself" act going<br><br>But then she just breaks down in tears while reading some undoubtedly dry medical log. Like god fucking dammit, gimme a break. And then gets saved by the fuccboi. goddamit. I dropped this last episode like 3 times before finishing. Had to stop and play a few games of dota in the middle.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I think this is a bit above average at best, but these last few threads have had more and lazier bait than fucking Gangsta threads do.  <br> dota <br><br>7/10 Almost had me.</br></br></br>  <br> Or were the expectations too low to begin with? <br><br>This story is like one of those romance novels featuring the secretary and the billionaire. There's tons of variances of these stories. Nanny and the billionaire. Pharmacist and the billionaire. Etcetera. <br><br>Of course, we had many western romance novels in similar vein. Nanny and the Rich Rancher. Storekeeper and the Rancher. Etc. And of course, the most old and classic romance novels featured girl and the Prince. Poor girl and the prince. Etc.<br><br>From watching 4 episodes so far and trying to look at the story as a story being revealed chapter by chapter, it has very few normal story elements. Instead, each story and the characters appear as needed to make Shirayuki look good or endear us to the Prince. <br><br>As for the story being Snow White with the Red Hair, it is one of those tacked on concepts to help the show sell character goods while building up to the inevitable Snow White scene with the poisoned apple and the Prince has to rescue her with a kiss. Of course, this gives the perfect excuse for the Prince to kiss Shirayuki without any prurient motives. Happy non-prurient Ending.<br><br>And no, what I said was not a spoiler because the show has been pushing the Snow White thing and poisons episode after episode. It's shoved in the face of anyone who has ever read about Snow White except there are no dwarves like Doc, Grumpy, Sneezy, Sleepy, etcetera.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ok you went too far I almost took it seriously. Impressive powers, anon</br>  <br><br> shit taste <br> dota <br><br>Put your trip Lelouch</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I think this is a bit above average at best, but these last few threads have had more and lazier bait than fucking Gangsta threads do. <br><br>The problem is the show has a lazy plot. It's like walking down a long linear visual novel "game" with almost no branches. And the few branches that exist have only one scene and thus no depth. In other words, this show is a good example of a forced plot anime. The forced plot screams out at you. <br><br>Is that bad. No, there are plenty of fans of that kind of story. Not every anime opportunity that Bones gets can be juicy highly acclaimed Grace A properties like Full Metal Alchemist. This anime original show is fine for those who liked Dog Days'.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>don't summon that retard.</br>  <br><br>Why is dota so bad?</br></br>  <br> more and lazier bait than Gangsta </br>  <br>It's not. It's the best MOBA which has mechanics that are just complex enough and character models that are sufficiently unattractive to keep the shitty 13 year olds out.</br>  <br> This anime original show <br>But it's a manga adaption</br></br>  <br> This anime original show <br><br>I didn't even have to read the whole thing to find out this was bait. Go back to your haremshit and Shonenshit faggot.</br></br></br>  <br> forced plot <br> had to stop to play dota <br>I don't think I'm overexaggerating, honestly.</br></br></br>  <br>0/10</br>  <br> I actually thought it was good, too. But then <br> Girl gets saved once an episode <br> Dialogue that would make Yahari's writer cringe <br> No attempt at romantic subtlety <br> Muh girl meets prince scenario <br><br><br> wtf, what he described is exactly what happens. <br><br>A lot of fake suspense in the show so far except for the original creepy Prince that wanted her. As for Snow White, she already had her poisoned apple in the 2nd episode and was protected by her prince. Not much of a poison apple as it was paralyzing and not killing.<br><br>More like the "low level threat" shoujo romance show with forced shoujo ending. But she claims to be achieving everything on her own, yet she depends on her friendship with the prince for getting as far as she has. She has no money worries as well as a number of other concerns since the show blithely skips over inconvenient necessary things. I say necessary because while these may be unncessary in other anime shows, in this show things like money are necessary because Shirayuki makes such a big deal about "making it on her own" yet there is very little of that going on anywhere even in the first episode. A herbalist spiderweb in the corner business that doesn't run on money is not making it on her own.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Prince saving her <br>Don't the signs point towards him falling to some poison with her rescuing him?</br></br>  <br>You were totally correct. It was forced plot. The fans of the show are just looking for any excuse to fault you. "Oh look, you misspelled one word, therefore everything you said was wrong!".<br><br><br> But it's a manga adaption <br>If the manga is just like the anime, then the same criticisms apply to the manga as well. But if there are anime-original elements, then there is a chance the manga is like the anime and actually has a little depth in the plot. For the sake of the manga, hopefully the anime is different.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, I pretty much punched my computer during the medical log scene, but even still I was able to make out impending likelikhood of <br><br> ooooh shit, looks like some fuckers gonna throw a dart or something at this prince in the middle nowhere forest somewhere <br><br> whhhooaaatt are all these plants doing here in the middle of nowhere that I can use to brew some nasty shit to save his tuchus <br> and maybe reference some shit from that medical log <br> epbic storytellan </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She has no money worries <br>She had a job she was good at, it's not far fetched to assume she has enough money to not worry about it until the end of the royal herbalist test.</br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit, these threads are unbearable.</br></br>  <br>Maybe I misunderstand what you are saying, but he wasn't poisoned by a dart, it was an apple (aimed at Shirayuki) and she wasn't able to cure the poison, it's why she surrendered to Raji.</br>  <br>It looks like poison is all over the story so far. The prince took poisons to try to build up immunity. She's been paralyzed by poison in an attempt by royalty to exercise their legal rights (might makes right in that kingdom).<br><br>It would be cockeyed story to keep on using poison over and over and over and over in the plot. If the prince gets poisoned again, that would be overuse of the poison plot trick.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm predicting what will likely happen, given the emphasis on her being a strong willed ho, who act independently and wait for it...<br><br> ... <br><br>save the prince<br><br><br>UN FUCKING BELIEVEABLE</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>DanMachi had a lot more strong-willed self-made women in it.</br>  <br>Because they don't sell.</br>   mfw these threads are no longer comfy   <br>You have a point.</br>  <br>This is the closest thing we'll ever get to an Atelier anime.</br>  <br>Do you mean the OST and art/animation or what?<br><br>Because the story and characters while not terrible are pretty mediocre.<br> It's your typical shojo self-instert with bishonens around the girl all the time. I read the manga until chapter 20 something so i'm not talking only about the anime.<br>There's some bad attempts of comedy too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Erm...<br><br>There was an Atelier anime last year</br></br></br>  <br>Oh come the fuck on this is SHIT, and i'm not trying to bait anyone. <br>it's fucking terrible, I read the manga because /a/ said it's good, fuck off it's fucking disgusting. Cliches all the time, self insert faggots. <br> It's the new Yona  <br>Fuck you all i'll never believe you again, at least Yona has character development and she gradually starts doing shit for herself</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128720048 <br> Is like the hundreds other shojou shows <br>Yeah, we are really not watching the same thing. Or maybe you are just trying way too hard?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128720048 <br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128720177 <br><br>now this was all me</br></br></br></br>  Shoujo is a love it or hate it genre in general. I like the show but some of the dialogue seems awkward at times.  <br>Only if they are also merchants working off enormous debt and are forced into  stock manipulation </br>  <br>There isn't really much to hate about this show. Anons most common complaints about shoujo is that the love interests are dicks, but Zen's a total bro.</br>  <br>I missed the endless  New Game+  and  that fucking loli(s) and fairy who ruined my lowest price record. </br>  This fucking thread holy shit. I just wanted a comfy thread about this anime, not this cancerous abomination of a thread with faggots bringing up dota and acting like smartasses but instead they are little dumb niggers.<br><br>Seriously if you don't like the show then I understand but don't bring your cancer and shitposting. Do that in a another thread that's haremshit or Shonenshit.</br></br>  <br>That loli isn't so bad after you leveled your customer relationship with her.</br>  <br><br>If you haven't noticed, today the shitposting on /a/ has been going full-bore. Accel-kun even appeared and trolled a hentai thread into oblivion.</br></br>  <br>Is that so?</br>  Stop overhyping this generic anime  I really like this show and the comfy vibes it gives but I got to ask your thoughts on this /a/; is she a mary-sue?<br><br>Like she seems inhuman and perfect. Even if she has flaws, they still make her perfect and every character in this series loves her or eventually loves her for her perfection.</br></br>  <br>She's a mary-sue for sure</br>  <br><br>If she's mary-sue,  then who is the gary-stu? Zen or Izana? </br></br>  The main couple is making my heart feel funny, I usually never feel like this about shoujo couples.<br><br>What does Akagami do right, /a/?</br></br>  <br>Misunderstandings are dealt with swiftly, that's it.</br>  <br> responding to mary sue shitposters <br>Report and ignore. They did the same shit yesterday.</br></br>  <br>This. Fuck misunderstandings.</br>  <br>Her actions meaning nothing without Princely support and money make her incompetent.<br><br>And not making hair dye ffs.</br></br></br>  I was curious about what period this was set and had some clues from that lime concrete they were using in the pier in episode 2, but this greenhouse definitely shows that it's easily in the mid 1800's.  <br>Probably no later, but we'll have to see if we end up seeing anything more modern/magitech-y</br>  <br> It's the endings you have to watch out for. <br>You can say that shit again</br></br>  <br><br>Their tech is pretty schizo already with those magic lamps</br></br>  <br>Gas lamps are old tech and probably brighter than you think. They're still used in a few places today.</br>  <br>Stick to your guns, anon. I'm with you on the barricades.<br>It's cute and all, but nothing ...<br><br>... I can't even come up with an adjective. It's nothing but cute.</br></br></br></br>  When are Ryu and Shirayuki going to fuck?  <br>Never. Ryu is her practice son with Obi and belongs with that other shota anyway.</br>  <br><br>It's clearly a fantasy world, evidenced by the fact that herbal medicines have anything other than a placebo effect.<br><br>I'm no Hox, but if I had to pick a timeframe I would say even late 1800s or early 1900s based on architecture, but with no fossil fuels or saltpeter existing in this universe.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Na, Space Dandy.</br>  <br>Sounds like you're living in a fantasy world yourself</br>  <br>You forgot Kekkai Sensen.</br>  <br>We should institute some manner of security pass. Like if you don't have some goofy crystal dogtag id, you aren't allowed into these threads.<br><br> I really felt like they glossed over that Palace ID thing really quickly. Who instituted this? When? Why? Who makes the tags? they're clearly some kind of etched glass, which isn't cheap. Shirayuki is an exception and they don't normally allow anyone in without one, but they don't seem to have visitor tags, either? There are some other stories going on here. </br></br></br>  <br>Back off Watari, his LN's are pretty based. <br><br> Second season should never have happened, we used to have great threads and Yahari used to be well respected within the fanbase. </br></br></br>  <br>Is that your genuine opinion?</br>  <br> great threads and Yahari <br>Maybe months of shitposting have deluded me but I don't remember this.</br></br>  <br>When spyro started the translations, between vol 7 until 6.5 (which is after vol 10) If I recall correctly. <br><br>They were LN exclusive, but great threads.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128720048 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128720177 <br>oops</br></br>  Guys, I think I'm in love with Shirayuki  I like her. she's very likeable.<br><br>I almost feel bad for the kid court herbalist, he is getting cucked hard and he can't do a single thing about it  except maybe poison Zen or concoct some miracle age gap closer .</br></br>  <br>Perhaps it's funi's fault?</br>  <br>He can never win. There's already an age-appropriate rival who's actually better than Zen in almost every way except status and being second boy.</br>  <br>Akagami's very likable, but I want Zen to get smacked several times.</br>  <br>Soon, figuratively.</br>  <br>feels bad.</br>  <br>Get the fuck out shitty frog poster.</br>  <br>please, no ntr here</br>  <br>the only thing Obi is better at is sitting on things that aren't chairs.<br><br>Branches, ledges, roofs, windowsills. Never chairs though.</br></br></br>  <br> better at romance <br> better fighter <br> better shopper <br> better wardrobe <br> better with kids <br> has an actual backstory <br> hangs out with the main character <br> more creative sitter <br>He has a lot going for him. It's a good thing he's not serious about being a rival.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How the hell does having a backstory make him better from Shirayuki's viewpoint?</br>  <br>I don't recall mentioning her viewpoint. That would be totally irrelevant to the topic since she isn't looking around.</br>  <br>I assumed we were talking about from her viewpoint, since we were discussing him as a romantic rival superior to Zen.</br>  <br>Not at all.</br>  <br>No, I only mean in general terms or from the audience perspective since this was originally about potential rivals. It doesn't really matter for her since her pairing is basically set in stone.</br>  <br>The problem with this is, Shirayuki is a wonderful heroine in a stale and boring show. <br><br>I like the character, but find the show boring as all fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>I like it well enough, but I think something needs to actually happen, rather than every episode being a scenario that takes twenty minutes to pan out despite the viewer knowing where it's going five minutes in.</br>  <br>easily aots</br>  Will Zen or someone important in the palace get terminal illness?  <br>yes  probably her. </br>  <br>If this is seriously the best BONES show you've seen then you need to watch more anime. A lot more anime. This isn't even their best shoujo.</br>  <br> am I fitting in </br>  <br>The only time where she really needed Zens assistance was at her abduction and even then she managed well for herself. You obviously don't know what incompetence means, go back to school.</br>  So how long is this supposed to follow the manga?<br><br>I get the impression that we won't make it to the crown prince even though he's a stone cold motherfucker.</br></br>  <br> crown prince <br>I don't even remember this anymore.<br><br>I think we are going up to ch 26</br></br></br></br>  <br> BONES is shit lel <br>You can't have been watching anime for more than two years if you actually believe this<br><br>Heck the only legitimately bad show they made last year was SEN</br></br></br></br>  <br> lel </br>  <br> Needs to take a two hour break in the middle of a 20 minute episode <br>What are you, a 13 year old hopped up on sugar and caffeine?</br></br>  <br>The main character is a pharmacist. That's like complaining about people getting shot more than two times in a show about guns.</br>  <br>The prince appears right after their trip next week. They just won't get to her going to grad school.</br>  <br><br>same<br>except played few games of League</br></br></br>   Woke up hoping a nice Akagami thread <br> Get this instead <br><br>What's wrong with /a/ this week, can't we just have nice things ?<br><br><br>Episode itself was pretty great (again), Shirayukis honesty and eagerness makes her just so lovely.<br>Don't really get why people are shitting on her crying scene, reading how a kid is puking his guts out or suffers through immense stabbing pain is a sad read, especially when you committed your life to the healing arts.<br><br><br>People who are unable to eve feel a shred of empathy shouldn't watch shoujos.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it was kind of hard to watch, really, in a good way.</br>  <br>/a/'s been incredibly bad the last few days.</br>  <br>Yeah I've just taken a look into the breaker thread and it's filled with comments like this <br><br><br>Might take a break from this place.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree</br>  <br>Well Korean manhwa is objectively terrible though, anon.</br>  <br>Oh, that's every manhwa thread for a while now, actually. There was some sort of blow-up about it not being /a/-relevant, and the mods had to step in and decide to allow it, and now there's what I think is one really pissed guy who keeps riling others up to shitpost the threads.</br>  <br>I fail to see why they are supposed to be so different from regular manga. Some are great some are shit, just like in grand nippon.</br>  <br>Fucking this.</br>  What did Sabo tell Dragon after regaining his memories?  <br> hey did you know I'm the brother of your son? <br> uh...? </br></br>   ワンピース795話 <br> we finally see Sanji and others on the LAST PAGE </br>  <br> why did you give your son to the WG if you are a revolutionary </br>  <br> why did you give your son to the WG <br>Wat</br></br>  <br>Why did Garp have Luffy with Dragon alive?<br>It is not as though Luffy's childhood was stable or his island safe, seeing as he was raised by mountain bandits and the island was burned, and one of his brothers shot by the tenryubito.<br><br>I think the most obvious question is why didn't Dragon raise Luffy like he did Sabo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>confirmed that Luffy will lose an eye in the final battle</br>  <br>Maybe he thought it was safer since Garp could keep an eye and Ace was around and the whole village loved Luffy. Maybe he wanted Luffy to become a Marine so he could have someone on the inside. Maybe he's super irresponsible.</br>  <br>Zoro</br>  <br>I hope Dragon is actually an evil motherfucker or at least very morally ambiguous<br><br>Bad Guy WG vs Good Guy revolutionaries isn't that interesting but that's how it's shaping out to be. <br><br>Hopefuly Luffy won't like what Dragon is doing and will forge his own path to changing the world</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Obvious Zoro is obvious. Luffy will die before the final scenes</br>  why does he have to job? he's my favorite marine, and hes almost as bad as king jobber sanji now a days. at least he put up a better fight vs vergo than sanji did I guess.  <br><br><br>Why would Zoro need a eye patch after the one piece is found? What difference would it make since he just keeps it closed anyway?</br></br></br>  <br>he's not a very good fighter anymore but he'll have a big relevance considering the marine's future</br>  <br>Fashion sense</br>  <br>What if it's a scene from when he gets old?<br>What if there really is something special behind his closed eye and he overuses it and has to use an eye patch to keep it even closed?<br>I don't know anon. But the only one I can think of right now would be Zoro because of his eye.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Zoro <br><br> It doesn’t really matter if you know or don’t know the thing called the One Para Column, but this appears to be last of behind the scenes talk. The last story to tell is more of a behind the scenes policy, rather than a behind the scenes story. So what is a "pirate"? If you ask someone with artistic talents to draw a pirate, you will normally get a sketch that looks like this... or this ....  <br><br> Indeed, a pirate. Very easy to understand, but if you take off the eye patch, there's a big difference to one with, and one without (the one without looks like a normal middle-aged man). So then, that means, eye patch = pirate. It’s just like, afro = champion type thing... so have you noticed yet? Well, you probably haven’t. That in One Piece, there has not been one single pirate with an eye patch! ... yes i know, who cares right? But this is my secret "behind the scenes policy". It’s not like every pirate has an eye patch!!! ... right? You can totally draw pirates without an eye patch!!!! <br><br> And with that thought in mind it all began; the story of a normal looking boy's pirate story. <br><br> I thought, if there's an image in everyone's head about what a pirate is, then I thought I would write/draw about the process of the boy getting there. But its not like I dislike eye patches, so in the final scenes of One Piece, there is one pirate who appears with an eye patch. <br><br>It's Luffy<br>Why the fuck would Zoro need to wear an eyepatch when he's been getting along fine just by keeping his eye closed?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why can't Luffy keep his eye closed as Zoro?</br>  <br> yfw when luffy uses two eyepatches as fashion because he loses both eyes instead of sunglasses or shit like that </br>  I think Usopp is the most likely to lose an eye. Especially since he's the Sniper and unlocked CoO.  <br>Usopp will probably get his eye shot out by Van Auger but still win.</br>  <br>Luffys style is that of a pirate<br>Zoro resembles more of a samurai <br><br>Zoro with an eye patch would look off putting.</br></br></br></br>   tfw Bisoromi Bear-Sama is gone   <br>This disqualifies any straw hat who is not a normal human.<br>Only Usopp is stated by Oda as<br> the closest to a normal human <br>When he joins Luffy's crew he was actually about to start his own journey as a captain but Zoro said get on the boat.<br>Usopp then said (and Luffy agreed with all crew present and not objecting that should luffy die, Usopp is captain.</br></br></br></br></br>   There are at least 15 notebooks that include Oda's ideas about Dressrosa arc. <br><br>That guy really does work 24/7 even when he is on a break doesn't he?</br></br>  <br>Mangakas doesn't sleep.</br>  <br>At first I thought that sounds like a bit of a longshot but if you think about it there could be a little bit of foreshadowing for this.<br>Recall the first chapter where Luffy tries to stab himself in the eye to prove he's tough?<br>Then there's the volume cover where he has one eye closed.</br></br></br>  <br>Luffy was likely an infant when he gave Luffy to his grandfather.

I've been watching  dota  all day long.  <br> Sacrificing my life means nothing if the SH can continue their journey toward their dreams <br>Kinda, I guess ?</br></br>  <br>I'm referring to the story arc in literary terms, not the wiki's arc system.<br>Even under that definition though Dressrosa is absolutely just the little garden of this saga which won't end till Kinemon's conflict is resolved.<br><br>For example Laboon, Whiskey Peak, and little garden were all buildup to Alabasta with Vivi being introduced at Laboon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Lawhats didn't form to kill Doffy they formed to kill Kaido, and taking out Doffy was just an essential step.</br>  <br>Dressrosa is more important and longer than alabasta, so year no comparing it to little garden is retarded at the first place there is nothing that suggest tha kinemon is the main factor that describes the current saga instead of kaidou, big mom or someone important on wano. Afterall the baroque works saga was not named after vivi, but after the organisation of a big shot</br>  <br>spoilers won't come out til tomorrow</br>  post yfw Bellemy joins the strawhats  <br>That's the difference between an saga, a arc and a build-up arc. The Saga SHOULD be about kaidou while dressrosa still is an actual arc and Punk hazard was a direct build-up arc for dressrosa</br>  <br> dressrosa isn't just a segment of the "Luffy and Law take down Kaidou" arc </br>  <br> I don't know the difference between arc and saga <br>Look ist up</br></br>  <br>Water 7 is actually longer than Enies Lobby I'm pretty sure. <br><br>EB was actually more like a conclusion arc to Water 7 that went on for way too long.</br></br></br>    <br>Arc and saga are words that exist and have their own meanings outside of the context of One Piece.<br><br>Inside the context of One Piece, arc and saga don't necessarily refer to a specific thing because the source material is in fucking japanese.<br><br>Are you ESL, or just autistic?</br></br></br></br></br>  Friendly reminder Shanks will BTFO Kidd and his allies, and will make them serve him rum everyday  <br>  <br>Inside the context of One Piece, arc and saga don't necessarily refer to a specific thing because the source material is in fucking japanese.<br>Are you actually retarded?</br></br></br>  <br>Shanks will lost another arm.</br>  <br>please show me where in the one piece source material it is specified that alabasta is an arc and baroque works is a saga, and that the words arc and saga refer to specific story patterns</br>  <br>It is important but only in that it gives us a lot of the pieces for the Great War and Revery. Only in that it is buildup for Kaido/big mom/akainu. Only in that it shows us Luffy's strength max, so that when he gets owned by Kaido it seems impossible Luffy could win.<br>Dress rosa is longer than Alabasta but Alabasta introduced:<br>Poneglyphs <br>Roger's real name<br>Fire fist Ace<br>Shichibukai<br>The ancient weapons<br>Inanimate objects with devil fruit<br>Dr. Vegapunk (not sure if his name was dropped though could be wrong)<br>Logia<br>Steroids<br>and poison</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Blackbeard</br>  <br>It's the Yonko saga, Dressrosa is a really long arc but not the main one of the saga which is going to be yonko resolution, not shichibukai working for a yonko resolution. Not that anon.</br>  <br>Nah he was intro as a silhouette at Drum. Also I forgot Krieg used poison gas. Still, also the only person who can read glyphs joined the crew at the end of it.</br>  <br>Initial<br>D<br>D<br>D</br></br></br></br>  <br>Logia were already introduced with Smoker<br>Gold Roger's real name was mentioned in Drum<br>Steroids and poison aren't important plot points<br><br>But other than that yeah</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>and Bepo.</br>    <br>Thanks for the correction but multiple royal families had secret royal steroids so they are relevant.<br>Poison is relevant because poison can also be a fatal disease.<br>Smoker wasn't a very overwhelming logia like croc but you are technically correct.</br></br></br>  <br>Lets face it. Only reason Kidd's crew is going after Shanks is because Hawkins cards predicted that their survival rate is the highest against the Red Hairs verses the other Yonko. And that's only because Shanks is a chill guy and will probably give them a little beating and then laugh about it and party with them afterwards.</br>  <br>I disagree with that being even the main reason.<br>Shanks is the most desirable Yonko to defeat because looting his ship and even just asking him how to get to Raftel could have good results.</br></br>  <br>We don't know that it hasn't already been used. She's a prime candidate if you ask me.</br>  <br>I want it to happen</br>  <br>Dammit, every time I see Doctorine my head changes her symbol to the 4chan clover</br>  <br><br>Is it impossible for Blackbeard to be Pluton?<br>The Blueprints Franky burned in front of Spamdam said PLUTON but when Franky talked about what he had to people in confidence it was stated as the<br> countermeasure <br>To PLUTON, rather than the weapon itself.<br>This has always confused me because sometimes the manga says frankly has plutons countermeasure and others it says the weapon itself.<br><br>How did Blackbeard know Luffy was at Water 7 after Skypiea is my main question though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Dragon was too busy with revolutionary stuff when Luffy was born probably. Plus he's mentioned in some of his appearances that he approves of Luffy's choices in terms of finding his own way in the world. It's very possible he wanted Luffy to grow up and form his own opinions on things and also new that while Garp would want him to be a Marine he would also be too busy to raise or influence Luffy that much (which is indeed what happened)</br></br>  <br>I think you're confused. It was stated that Pluton was to be used as a countermeasure against one of the other ancient weapons in case the government or someone else revived one.</br>  <br>Makes sense, I'll re read it.</br>  <br>You didn't answer the main question.<br>It makes no sense that Blackbeard could know where Luffy would exit the sky.<br><br>But on to other shit, check out this 330 year old skull that Robin found from the ship that fell from the sky and read what she says about his smile.<br><br>Then remember that Luffy found a treasure chest in this boat that fell from skypiea which had been in that place while roger was alive.<br>Roger undoubtedly found this boat while it was in skypiea, and learned his own family history.<br><br>Unfortunately the exclamation pointed treasure chest was never opened, but at least luffy found the map of skypiea.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  posting canonically gayest one piece character  <br>You mean Delly</br>  <br> canonically gayest one piece character <br><br>you mean fanonically<br><br>Gayest award goes to Whitebeard</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here is the ship.</br>  <br>that quote is bullshit. Just because you can't imagine a new color, doesnt mean there arent any more</br>  so how did those people on the island find out tanjihadou laluflamingo were former tenryuubito? did he literally tell someone he used to be one?  <br>The quote never said that things humans can't imagine don't exist, it just said all things they can imagine are possible.</br>  <br>Pluton is a ship man</br>  <br>it says that anything your imagination can create can exist in the real world, not that only things you can imagine can exist<br>reading comprehension</br></br>  <br><br>Here is the exclamation marked treasure chest that got eaten by the sea turtle.</br></br>  <br>So it is Water 7 then, because the saga ended with Iceberg telling Franky Water 7 would be converted to a ship.</br>  How different would the Dressrosa arc have been if Akainu sent Kizaru instead of Fujitora?  <br> read what she says about his smile <br>Are you talking about how he had rubber oil put on his teeth after his death?<br><br> Roger undoubtedly found this boat while it was in skypeia and learned his own family history <br>Okay, first, the boat was floating around in exile on a cloud island or something in a place where it couldn't get back. I'm not sure how Roger could have found it.<br>Second, in what way is this tied to Roger's family history? I see no indication of any of this. Roger is from the East Blue, this guy is from South Blue.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fujitora did nothing. <br><br>Kizaru doesn't give a fuck about anything so he wouldn't have done anything as well.<br><br>I like Fuji but with Kizaru the arc would've been 3 times better.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kizaru would've gotten shit done<br> laser beams gladiators that try to join Luffy's side <br> Sabo tries to hold him off but get kicked with the speed of light <br> Law and Luffy would probably try to escape, the two of them could barely take down Dofla, so Kizaru would've been out of the picture. <br><br>I still don't get why they don't just send kizaru to destroy the ships of the supernova.He could just uasaka no magatama them to oblivion.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> rubber oils <br>Or he was a rubber man till he died.<br>If it can literally fall next to luffy I think roger would find it too. He found skypiea.</br></br></br>  <br>More pages dumpin no order though.<br>All the other skulls miss teeth by the way.</br></br>  <br>i like how this one really happens by the rust user at ennies lobby</br>    <br>I love that page so much, only because of how Robin can decipher something as simple as a skull and extract a ton of information. Ohara's researchers were ahead of their time. Damn the fights, I want Oda to release a book on all the information regarding One Piece's world. Just an atlas of stuff explaining certain areas and the like. Some people just can't appreciate One Piece for what it is.</br>  <br>Coating the deceased's teeth in rubber oil is a custom of a specific region of the South Blue. That's how Robin finds the name of the ship, which is later confirmed in the page you posted .<br><br>If he were a rubber man, that would be a hell of a coincidence. Also, if his teeth were rubber, then either they would still be rubber (which is not the case), or they would have ceased being rubber upon his death, in which case they wouldn't have been stayed in the same condition and deteriorated.<br><br>And yeah, I don't expect Roger to have found that ship, and there's absolutely no proof that he did. I'm just not sure where you're pulling this from.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fujitora would've gotten shit done if we wanted to, too</br>  <br>Also, the log pose pointed to the sky only after/while this ship fell from it. Before that it was pointing normally.</br>  So once Luffy gives the hat back to Shanks, what is he going to do about his Crew name and Jolly Roger?<br><br>Cant very well go on being known as Strawhat Luffy after that.</br></br>  <br>Shanks is going to die at the hand of the Kid alliance.<br><br>He can't give the hat back.</br></br></br>  <br>Fire Fist and I sodomized your son.</br>  <br> ship with a treasure chest falls from the sky, then your log pose immediately points at the sky thereafter, and you get a map of skypiea  <br> not a hell of a coincidence <br>Ugh</br></br></br>  <br> implying Shanks wouldn't just give the straw hat back <br>Would be petty of shanks if he didn't</br></br>  <br>Ahos need not reply</br>    <br>didnt Shanks say to return it though? It IS still his hat. One he got from his deceased captain no less</br>  <br><br>He'll learn to awaken his power and make everything smoke.</br></br>    Who is the most autistic character in One Piece?  <br>Imagine this. After a big fight Shanks is dying, Luffy returns it and then Shanks immediately gives it back to him. And then when Luffy finds the One Piece he will pass the hat to the next strawhat.</br>  <br>Getting the map is not a part of the coincidence. The ship was on Skypiea.</br>  <br><br>Wanze</br></br>  <br>Luffy, he has Dragonball Goku levels of autism at times.</br>  <br>Hard to say. Going by the internet's definition, a lot of characters are autistic.</br>  <br>Vegapunk.</br>  <br>You're making a theory (Roger found his history) based on two baseless theories (Roger found the ship, the Saint Bliss guy was a rubber human) and another unproven theory (Roger was a rubber man).<br><br>It's highly unlikely Roger even found the Saint Bliss, and even if we're assuming he could because coincidences happen in One Piece, there's no evidence that he did.<br><br>The ship crashing down next to them giving them a map of Skypeia is a hell of a coincidence, sure, but it for sure happened.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Zoro:*unseathes katana* shishi sonson Pssht.Nothing personnel kid</br>  <br>The map being completely untarnished while the sword disintegrated as it unsheathed is a pretty lucky coincidence.<br>So is Luffy of all people being the one to find it.<br>The falling ship coinciding with the change in magnetic field is the only reason they got the map as well so yes it is.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel like he just said it to make some sort of promise that they'd meet each other again. I think seeing Luffy again is more important to him than getting his hat back, and I'd think he'll know that the strawhat would be important to Luffy by then too. I don't know, he might take it back, but I don't see him doing that.</br>  <br>that's too predictable</br>  When will the rest of the Sun Pirates be killed so Law can join the Strawhats  <br>Where did I claim Roger was a rubber man? I just claim this ancestor was as all other skulls on his ship had missing teeth and he was murdered so there was no one to put rubber oil on his teeth and manicure him after death.<br>You drew the roger was rubber on your own.</br></br>    <br>Roger hears the voice of all things and found all the great treasures because of it, and there was a treasure on the ship, and the drawn map was clearly NEW compared to all other artifacts on the ship.</br>  <br>Nah. Actually I think Luffy is very in tune with other's feelings and naturally knows what they need to hear or do to make them feel better. Like how he handled Laboon for example, though he's an animal. Definitely not stunted when it comes to social interactions.</br>  <br>looking at it like that, maybe he wasnt expecting the hat back. There was always a chance, Luffy would give up or die and he'd never see that hat again<br><br><br>I dont think Aladdin dying would effect whether or not Law joins. He can hardly stand Luffy, there's no way he'd stay with them</br></br></br></br>  <br>My mistake, I assumed you were using the "Roger had a rubber fruit" theory to try and prove your own.<br><br>You said that Roger discovered his own family history on that ship, correct? How on earth do you draw the conclusion that he find this information on that ship?<br><br>Maybe I'm misunderstanding you. I'm trying to clear it all up now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More like Shanks knew someone like Blackbeard would kill him and take the hat so he bet it on the next generation. Even though BB will still kill him he will only achieve that much.</br>  <br> There was always a chance, Luffy would give up or die and he'd never see that hat again <br>I think that was the point. Shanks making Luffy promise to give the hat back, was in a way making Luffy promise not to give up on his pirate dream until he's able to meet up with Shanks again in the New World.</br></br>  <br>its just a hat. If what you're getting at is that the Hat is necessary to the future somehow, then im going to have to stop you right there</br>  <br>I dont think thats true, BB mentioned that he was willing to die a normal death if he never stumbled by the darkness fruit, which probably means he was mortal.</br>  <br>I suppose. But there was also the chance he'd die at sea before meeting Shanks again. Hell Sabaody should have been his end. Roguetown should have been his end really</br>  <br>Yeah, you're right, the hat isn't necessary for anything.<br>It still is, unbeknownst to almost everyone, Roger's hat. It's possible it's older than that as well. There's that image of a kid wearing the same hat while Noland told a story 400 years prior.</br></br>  <br> BB mentioned that he was willing to die a normal death if he never stumbled by the darkness fruit, <br>when did he say that?</br></br>  <br>Is Luffy a true Egoist?</br>  <br>Yea thats why no one told luffy it was Rogers hat even though many who met him know this, especially shanks and Rayleigh.<br>Faggot.</br></br>  <br>I never realized Rayleigh has a vertical eye scar like zoro</br>  <br>dont be a moron<br><br>If the hat was important, Roger would not have given it to Shanks. At least not until he was about to turn himself in to the marines</br></br></br>  <br>Passing the hat to the next generation in no way suggests it is unimportant.<br>Surviving (at least) three generations of pirating suggests it is special.<br>Appearing twice in Norlands story also suggests it is special.<br>The time skip also gives the hat specifically a heavy focus (page related).<br>The Straw Hat has dodged every attack except Buggy's, including lightning, magma, ice, and lasers.<br>The straw hat flew to shanks feet when it dodged magma.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He'll be known as Pirate King Luffy</br>  <br>I smiled<br><br>Fuck You</br></br></br>  <br>ur a faget</br>  <br> Passing the hat to the next generation in no way suggests it is unimportant. <br><br>the hat going from Roger to Luffy only means the hat is being returned to its rightful owner. That's all<br><br> Surviving (at least) three generations of pirating suggests it is special. <br><br>special=/=important<br><br> Appearing twice in Norlands story also suggests it is special. <br><br>this means nothing until it's actually proven to be the same hat. Not just fanon speculation<br><br> The time skip also gives the hat specifically a heavy focus <br><br>because it's his symbol. He's was going to essentially reform the Strawhat pirates after that. Of course there'd be symbolism with Luffy putting it back on<br><br> The Straw Hat has dodged every attack except Buggy's, including lightning, magma, ice, and lasers. <br> The straw hat flew to shanks feet when it dodged magma. <br><br>It's not sentient. plot wont allow the hat to be destroyed while its the main character's symbol</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So who's going to join the Straw Hats next and how long until Jinbei joins?  <br>drake vs law luffy vs apoo kidd hawkins</br>  <br>I dont remember but if I had to guess it was when he was fighting ace.</br>  <br>i hope jinbe came to help fight big mom and sanji died</br>  <br>What is jimbei even doing? He said he had to do something, then we get the cover story of jim just helping out some random fish.</br>  <br>Jinbei needs to join right the fuck now</br>  <br>Yah I was right he says "i would have given up" not die a normal death but still<br><br>http://www.mangapanda.com/one-piece<wbr>/440/17<br> inb4 mangapanda <br>I couldnt find this chapter on bato.to</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Same poster, but implying Oda won't have another two members join so the Straw Hats can all be divided into groups of three<br><br> Implying this isn't the reason the Bellamy joining theory is going around </br></br></br>  <br>If it is not proven it is the same hat to you, then you are an irrational person.<br>Luffy's hat is iconic and unique within the one piece manga.<br>It is drawn not just one time on the kid by Norland but twice. Oda consciously chose to put the straw hat in Norland's Lore, and Norland is relevant even at Dressrosa, with a plaque with HERO literally written.<br>Oda has stated that the last chapter was known since the first. In the first Luffy gets the pirate kings hat from a future or current yonko after declaring he will become it.<br>Also when Crocodile threw luffy in quicksand the straw hat flew to Robin, who freed luffy and threw the hat back to him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If it is not proven it is the same hat to you, then you are an irrational person. <br><br>please provide actual proof. Fan speculation is not proof. Demaro also had a strawhat which PROVES that there is more than one in the OP universe.<br><br>None of what you wrote is proven<br>  <br>Oda has stated that the last chapter was known since the first.<br> That Luffy will become Pirate King? Of course we knew that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait is your argument seriously that Oda didn't draw it on purpose?<br><br>Because either<br>1. It is on purpose and therefore extremely relevant.<br>2. It's accidental, Oda is known to draw straw hats like luffys by accident here's some other examples.<br>I can understand arguing that the hat is not the key to raftel but I can't understand the argument that Ida "accidentally" drew the iconic version of the straw hat in nolands flashback.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The hat probably didn't stay long with Roger, seems like only his own crew (Shanks and Rayleigh) know its original owner. <br><br>Here you can see Roger's long time rival WB associating the hat with Shanks rather than Roger.</br></br></br>  <br> Wait is your argument seriously that Oda didn't draw it on purpose? <br><br>no, my point is that strawhats arent some rare commodity. It's a hat made of grass. That village is full of farmers. There's no proof the hat in your pic is anything more than a common sunhat</br></br></br>  <br>Demario had a normal hat, modified to look like the straw hat.<br>It did not look like luffys hat.<br><br>If you want to get technical there is one legit straw hat, which Masara who is directly connected to norlands descendent, wore.<br>Even that hat still doesn't look like luffys but the one in the flashback does.<br>The drawing of luffys hat on this kid from 400 years ago, twice, is proof.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Demaro has a straw hat, but it doesn't resemble the one Luffy has.<br><br>The one straw hat on the kid in Norland's lore looks identical to the one Luffy has. <br><br>You don't just draw things randomly. Everything is a conscious decision and is meticulously gone over. If he wanted all straw hats to look alike, he could have done exactly that. Instead, he made it so the design of the hat Luffy has is unique.<br>Aside from Norland's story, which is, while admittedly not concrete proof, still fairly convincing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> straw hats aren't rare <br>Demalos was fake.<br>Show proof that straw hats aren't rare. So far all evidence suggests they are extremely rare.<br><br>Just by wearing a fake, a imitation of a straw hat, a fat retard successfully faked being luffy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Demario had a normal hat, modified to look like the straw hat. <br> It did not look like luffys hat. <br><br>which is not the point. The hat was a strawhat.<br><br> The one straw hat on the kid in Norland's lore looks identical to the one Luffy has. <br><br>looking identical doesnt make it the same hat. Strawhats have an actual usage besides being symbols for pirates</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Show proof that straw hats aren't rare. <br><br>pirates dont wear strawhats typically so its not like we'd see many people wearing them<br><br> Just by wearing a fake, a imitation of a straw hat, a fat retard successfully faked being luffy. <br><br>you're talking about a scene with joke characters that were immediately recognized when someone of actual importance showed up</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Wow. All of you are really fucking bored, aren't you?  Didn't Jinbei say he was going to get a crate of straw hats for the kids on FI?  <br>At this point it appears you are just saving face. I'll let you anon, sure.<br>My point was that a dude faked being the most famous supernova who fought at Marineford on TV just by wearing a non straw hat made to look like a straw hat, so it's pretty clear that straw hats like Luffy's are extraordinarily rare, or more specifically that his is unique like the eye patch.</br></br>  <br>If we had access to fun/friends/a life we wouldn't be on /a/</br>  <br> At this point it appears you are just saving face. I'll let you anon, sure. <br><br>If you arent actually going to refute me then quit replying. I'm giving you points of conversation and you brushing it aside is just rude. You know damn well that was a strawhat, weathered or otherwise</br></br></br>  <br>We are usually on islands with millions of people.<br>You mean they tricked everyone until when someone (Sentomaru) who had directly fought Luffy 1v1 in the past showed up?<br>None of this supports your claim that the straw hat is common.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm here because none of my irl friends want to talk about or read One Piece ;-; </br>  <br>She's supposed to be Swedish. Of course she has a bit of gay in her.</br>  <br>It's stated as a modified hat. I can't refute you because your claims aren't even substantiated enough to be refuted. Your example of another straw hat is a guy mistaken by a nation state as straw hat luffy</br>  <br> You mean they tricked everyone until when someone (Sentomaru) who had directly fought Luffy 1v1 in the past showed up? <br><br><br>you're talking about a universe where people dont recognize Sanji because his wanted poster is drawn<br><br>you can't just negate comedy because it doesnt make sense in the real world</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I can't refute you because your claims aren't even substantiated enough to be refuted <br><br>of course you cant refute me because nowhere has it been stated that there is only one strawhat. Which is my point</br></br></br>  <br>A straw hat is used to keep the sun out of your eyes and help prevent heat stroke to a small degree.<br><br>Pirates very much could wear straw hats in One Piece, but don't.<br>Neither do the people in Water 7, Alabasta, etc.<br><br>I never said it is 100% sure to be the same fucking hat. I said exactly the opposite in the same post that you linked. We do not fucking know if it is the same hat, there is simply not enough concrete evidence for that statement to be factually true.<br><br>However if you are trying to say that the theory is stupid and unfounded, then you're being ridiculous.<br>The straw hat is an iconic symbol in the One Piece franchise, and you do not accidentally a drawing of it. The fact that it appears twice should at least make you go "Huh, that is a bit odd."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sanji's wanted poster is so bad he realistically should go unrecognized, though. Usopp has Sogeking, etc. Importance and comedy are not exclusive elements of style.<br><br>Stating "it's funny" doesn't substantiate your claim that the straw hat is not unique.<br><br>It being passed from Roger to Shanks to Luffy, with Shanks telling Luffy<br> protect it for me <br>Does suggest it is unique.<br>That Luffy is identified by the hat, that Shanks returned it to him at Marineford, that it appears when roger meets Rayleigh, and in norlands flashback twice suggests it is unique.<br>Nothing is certain but it seems far more likely the pirate king hat is relevant than not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But it's been shown, anon, which is substantial in a 17,000 page manga, and which refutes your point.</br>  <br>He gave Luffy the freedom to be whatever he wanted to be, marine or a kind of outlaw.

Children can MAKE strawhats, people BUY strawhats, Demaro picked up a strawhat from somewhere or other.

It's a hat he modified to look like the straw hat. It is not proof they are in circulation, it's proof they are so hard to get it is easier to fake one.<br><br>Is a drawing of Luffy not proof of it being Luffy? Sure, mr. 2 could fake it, but the default assumption is it IS Luffy.<br><br>There is no reason to believe the straw hat drawn to look like luffy's hat, twice, in the norland flashback, is not luffy's hat.<br><br>Since nowhere in the story is his hat drawn but it's not his hat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See<br><br><br>I posted a picture of the type of hat ace and he learned to make in Wano.<br>You post proof he can make hats like Luffy's.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There is no reason to believe the straw hat drawn to look like luffy's hat, twice, in the norland flashback, is not luffy's hat. <br><br>you say twice like it means anything when it stays on the same kid. There isnt a reason to believe it IS Luffy's hat just because they're drawn the same. For all you know, that style of hat was just popular in that time<br><br> it's proof they are so hard to get it is easier to fake one. <br><br>The strawhats are handwoven, it's not even a matter of being hard to find, just the knowledge to stick one together.<br><br><br>How is posting a picture of a different hat proof that its the one Jinbe was bringing back?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Demario's hat was not a straw hat originally. It's a hat he modified to look like the straw hat. <br><br>where are you getting this from?</br></br></br>  <br>Because it's known that Ace and Jinbe know how to make that other kind of straw hat from Wano where the straw hats are now on the way to, shown on panel, and so it's absurd to believe it's a different hat.<br><br>Show another hat drawn the same as Luffy's that isn't Luffy's unique one.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Luffy would have to rename his pirate crew, it would be awkward as fuck.</br></br>  <br>An anon told me so</br>  <br> Ace and Jinbe know how to make <br>Jinbe said he would buy them from the fucking surface<br><br><br> Show another hat drawn the same as Luffy's that isn't Luffy's unique one. <br><br>see<br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That will be a random no-name pirate. Or Pandaman at best.<br>Why do people think it's gonna be someone important?</br></br>  <br>So what?<br>You can only post translated dialog, because you have NO example.<br>The straw hat is the straw hat, it's the one drawn on Rogers head, and the one drawn in Norland's flashback.</br></br></br>  <br>The straw hat predates one piece.</br>  <br> So what? <br>so he isnt making Wano hats, he's buying hats like Luffy's<br><br> You can only post translated dialog, because you have NO example. <br><br>what does dialog have to do with anything? The kids want strawhats because Luffy is wearing one. Why would Jinbe bring them something else entirely when he KNOWS what they're asking for?<br><br> The straw hat is the straw hat, it's the one drawn on Rogers head, and the one drawn in Norland's flashback. <br><br>Where is your proof? You have none and until you do, they're different hats</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>can you reiterate?</br>  <br>Unless you can show another hat identical to Luffy's that isn't his they are presumed the same hat.</br>  <br>Eichero Oda was an assistant on Kenshin. This straw hat/Jolly Roger is in the kenshin manga.<br>Oda talked about it in SBS.</br></br>  <br><br><br> People actually think the hat from Nolands flashback isn't an easter egg. </br></br></br>  <br>He looks more like Ace.</br>  <br> they are presumed the same hat. <br><br>you can assume whatever you want but same style=/=same hat. It's not proof and will never be proof. How do you even know its the same hat? Do we EVER see it in color?</br></br></br>  <br> drawn twice <br>Why presume something as non canon instead of canon in the most world history revealing flashback in the manga?</br></br>  <br>oh that's neat</br>  <br>So if he were to join, he'd just become Luffy's student? <br><br>Honestly I just want Bartomelo to join more so. I know he's got his own crew but I think if he were given the chance he'd jump to it. <br><br> I'll settle for alliance tho </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's literally drawn the same, and other than luffys hat, in 17,000 pages, no other hat is.<br>It isn't an assumption, it's a drawing of the same unique hat.</br></br>  <br> &gt;drawn twice <br> on the same farm kid </br></br>  <br>You wouldn't think Sabo was a Noble looking at him on trash island.<br>that it's on the same person proves it is not random, none of the other "farm kids" have that hat.</br></br>  <br> It's literally drawn the same <br><br>as I said same style=/=same hat<br><br>why do you assume its the same and not a similar hat made by the same artisan? Maybe that kid wearing a similar hat demonstrates that Roger's hat came from the area or descendants of the people living there?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> that it's on the same person proves it is not random <br><br>why would the hat switch around?<br><br> none of the other "farm kids" have that hat. <br>nor do they need to</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can say it all you want but if Oda draws Zoro I'm gonna believe it's Nami until something suggests otherwise.<br><br>The hat is an older character than Zoro and drawn just as unique.</br></br></br>  <br> if Oda draws Zoro I'm gonna believe it's Nami until something suggests otherwise. <br><br>is this a strawman? how ironic<br><br> The hat is an older character than Zoro <br>we know this already<br><br> and drawn just as unique. <br>THIS is fan speculation</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> zoro I'm gonna believe it is Nami <br>Welp I'm done.<br>Can't wait to see another straw hat drawn just like luffys that isn't his hat.<br>Oh wait there isn't one, so the skypiea hat is obviously his and has been passed down, which is supported by it being handed down in canon by the pirate king</br></br></br></br>  <br>Unless you can show a duplicate of the straw hat it is not speculation. Technically Zoro has been faked by Mr. 2, so the straw hat is MORE unique in its depiction than Zoro.<br>That you refuse to accept this is irrelevant to the truth of it.</br></br>  <br> Unless you can show a duplicate of the straw hat it is not speculation <br><br>this is where your logic is flawed though. You have no way of knowing its the same hat whether 3 of them exist or not. Another hat looking similar doesnt make it the same hat and you cant prove otherwise</br></br></br>  <br>Exactly, it is one hat passed down.</br>  <br><br>Robin has double Ds though.</br></br>  <br> Exactly, it is one hat passed down. <br><br>exactly what? Nothing I posted implies its the same hat</br></br></br>  <br>That's the issue though, you'd be right if other hats looked like it.<br>None do, so when it is drawn it is recognizeable to the point that the protagonist is colloquially named after it.<br>Thus unless you allege it doesn't look like the straw hat, or can show that hats exist which look like it, but are different hats from the one lift wears, it's proven Luffys hat is at least 400 years old and probably 800</br></br></br>  <br> There is no reason to believe the straw hat drawn to look like luffy's hat, twice, in the norland flashback, is not luffy's hat. <br><br>What the fuck are you talking about man<br>It's a fucking straw hat<br><br>There's no reason to believe it's the same hat unless you're a turbo autist<br><br>There's a reason why Shank's gift to Luffy wasn't some jeweled impressive looking hat, just a regular straw hat. To show that even mundane objects can mean a lot if they're connected to people you care about.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you'd be right if other hats looked like it. <br>this isnt true in the slightest <br><br>other hats dont have to look like Luffy's to prove the one in the flashback isnt the same. Until we're actually shown that hat being passed down TO Roger, then you cant say its the same one because you dont know</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shanks arm got cut off before he gave Luffy that hat.<br>It being drawn the same is a very legitimate reason in a drawn story.</br></br>  <br> trying to be able to backtrack when the story ends and it's made even more obvious <br>Haha.</br></br>  <br> Shanks arm got cut off before he gave Luffy that hat. <br><br>what are you even talking about? Shank's arm has nothing to do with anything</br></br></br>  <br>please dont resort to greentexting because you cant refute me. If you have nothing more to say then bow out gracefully<br><br>otherwise make a point that actually makes sense</br></br></br>  <br>Shanks was hiding in east blue for a year, Luffy found Gomu Gomu at the end of that year, on the same day he got the straw hat and Shanks set sail after saying "protect this."<br>Sure it has sentimental value, it just also has more value than that, being 400 years old.</br></br>  <br>All of my points make perfect sense.<br>A unique object being drawn is assumed as that object until proved otherwise, not the other way around.<br>You have yet to refute this or show that Luffy's hat from Kenshin all the way through 17,000 pages of one piece is not unique.<br>Since it is so unique, when it is drawn in a flashback, like rayleighs of Roger, we can assume it is Luffy's hat.<br>This doesn't stop applying just because one of the flashbacks it appears in is 400 years ago.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and what does Shanks arm have to do with any of that. Setting aside that your timeline is a tad off in the beginning, how would Shanks even know if it was 400 years old?<br><br>He gave the hat to Luffy because Luffy reminded him of Roger, who he's pretty much the living embodiment of</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe it was two days. Shanks directly stated to Whitebeard that he lost his arm because he bet the future on Luffy.<br>When you place a bet you lay down chips. But I won't say more than that because you will derail from:<br/></br></br>  <br> All of my points make perfect sense. <br>none of them prove anything. Not one of them.<br><br> A unique object being drawn is assumed as that object until proved otherwise, not the other way around. <br>The only person defining a unique object is you. You arent Oda and dont know HOW he'd depict similar style/identical hats<br> You have yet to refute this or show that Luffy's hat from Kenshin all the way through 17,000 pages of one piece is not unique. <br>Why would a hat from a different manga matter in the OP universe?<br> Since it is so unique, when it is drawn in a flashback, like rayleighs of Roger, we can assume it is Luffy's hat. <br>No we can not.<br><br> This doesn't stop applying just because one of the flashbacks it appears in is 400 years ago. <br>there's no proof that applied in the first place. That's YOUR speculation</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't need to prove it.<br>When Luffy's hat is drawn it is the default assumption.<br>When it was drawn on Rogers head in one panel in only one flashback we knew it was Luffy's even though shanks could have just had another straw hat.<br><br>Your only issue is you don't like that it is in not lands flashback because it violates your belief that the hat is insignificant beyond sentiment.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shanks directly stated to Whitebeard that he lost his arm because he bet the future on Luffy. <br><br>as in the next generation of pirates because he saw Roger's will in Luffy and believed in it</br></br></br>  <br>Or you know it's just a fucking straw hat drawn worn on a complete nobody 5 million chapters ago with no reference to it otherwise</br>  what one piece movies are worth watching besides baron, strong world and z?  <br>Except that is extremely unlikely because Oda intentionally thought out every panel of Norlands story, and there is no reason for the norland the liar book to have the straw hat as its a fabricated tale of what happened yet Oda still included it that second time. He did not have to draw the scene twice at all but he intentionally did so.<br>You're a moron if you believe he accidentally included that hat.</br></br>  <br> I don't need to prove it. <br> When Luffy's hat is drawn it is the default assumption. <br> When it was drawn on Rogers head in one panel in only one flashback we knew it was Luffy's even though shanks could have just had another straw hat. <br><br>All of these people are related/in contact with eachother. Random Noland kid is separated by time AND association. <br><br>I dont believe it because there isnt any proof. None. You're trying to urge me to accept head canon just because you WANT to believe you found so hidden relevance in a farmboy's hat</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is Oda preparing to have the top 6 of the worst generation duke it out? Kid, Hawkins and Apoo vs Luffy, Law and Drake? <br>I expect this post Wano</br></br>  <br>Movie 4 and 3D chase are alright</br>  <br> Except that is extremely unlikely because Oda intentionally thought out every panel of Norlands story <br>Source?</br></br>  <br>do you actually think oda draws luffys hat with it in mind that its the hat from kenshin? it has nothing to do with kenshin you complete autist. there is no reason to believe the hat goes any further back than roger, if you actually have some complicated theory that its hundreds of years old then you are trying too hard</br>  <br> Noland isn't associated with the straw hats <br>Except he very obviously is, being relevant as far along the journey as Dressrosa.<br>Norland either went backwards and was at green bit before jaya or he went the same way as Luffy across the grand line.</br></br></br>  <br> You're a moron if you believe he accidentally included that hat. <br><br>You're a moron if you don't think that was just an Easter Egg<br><br>It doesn't have to be unintentional to not mean anything</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not Drake vs   Monster Point Chopper </br>  <br>I didnt say anything about Noland. We're talking about the kid.</br>  <br>This is the only valid alternate possibility.<br>It is unlikely because it is the straw hat, something that has been in an equal amount of chapters as Luffy.</br></br>  <br>But Norland is in panel with the straw hat and the kid.</br>  <br>are you saying he stole the hat off a random kid to pass down to Roger's ancestors?</br>  <br> Norland either went backwards and was at green bit before jaya or he went the same way as Luffy across the grand line. <br><br>If that's your reasoning literally every godamn sailor on the grandline has an association with the straw hats</br></br></br>  <br> complicated theory <br>It looks like the same hat so it might be the same hat.<br><br>That's not very complicated.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No but it is possible Norland gave that kid the hat, or someone associated with Norland.</br>  <br>That four weeks felt more like a year</br>  <br> No but it is possible <br>sure its possible, i never argued against that</br></br>  <br> something that has been in an equal amount of chapters as Luffy <br><br>You are literally the most retarded person I've ever talked to on 4chan, holy shit<br><br>Luffy wears the straw hat you dolt, of course it's going to be in the same chapters as him. That doesn't mean anything beyond what we already know; the hat is special to him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It looks like the same hat so it might be the same hat. <br> might be <br><br>Nigga might be isn't what you've been arguing all this time. Although the possibility is quite low that it actually is, just by using common sense about how retarded that would be.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also I am not saying he took the hat from the kid.<br>Rayleigh stated all this about fate, just read this full page and know that Roger actually says<br> turn the world on its head <br>Roger was wearing the hat when he was "ready" in his own words, but otherwise preferred a different hat.<br><br> there may be no such thing as coincidences in this world <br>Above Roger wears luffy hat, and you argue that the straw hat in norlands story is a coincidence.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you <br>That's not me anon.</br></br>  <br> Norland <br>How's Binami, Tanjihado Lofulamingo, and Bisoromi Bear?<br><br>wtf is this 2004?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rayleigh is reminiscing of Roger while thinking of Luffy. It's reasonable to think that it's the same hat, given that Shanks was also in Roger's crew. If that wasn't the case, I'd assume it was a different straw hat. <br><br>There's no fucking connection between some random farm boy on Livneel and the Straw Hats. It's an easter egg bro.</br></br></br>  <br>Would be cool if it was</br>  <br>I was watching the fight, he does much better than law.</br>  <br> watching <br><br>But nah Smoker only does better than Law because Vergo had Law's heart. Once Law got the heart back he fucked that dudes ass.</br></br></br>  <br>I just watched the anime version of that fight myself. Law one shot Vergo.<br><br>Law is infinitely more powerful than Smoker currently is, which is clearly shown when he wrecked his shit outside of the facility on Punk Hazard, and in the SAD room when he one shot Vergo.<br>Smoker on the other hand, was consistently outmatched at every turn. To be fair, Vergo was a damn powerhouse.<br>But yeah, if Law had his heart from the get-go, he would have won immediately. End of story.<br><br>Smoker is unfortunately a fucking jobber and there's nothing we can do about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I just watched the anime version of that fight myself. <br><br>Anime version also makes Hody faster than gear 2 Luffy, and CC almost as strong as Gear 3 Luffy.</br></br></br>  <br>Why couldn't two people in the same crew have a straw hat?<br>Your pretending to be consistent but actually a hypocrite.<br>The straw hat on Rogers head was assumed Luffy's by appearance. The other statements just compliment the obvious.<br>But because Norland was 400 years ago and this conflicts with your view of the hat, you deny it.<br>Maybe you just werent reading weekly when it was first revealed that Roger had a straw hat;<br>And Lvneel is not some joke country.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm a faggot and it showed up on my youtube recommended videos. I didn't actually watch Punk Hazard, FI killed officially killed the anime for me and I switched to the manga during the FI flashback.<br><br>The anime Vergo fight is basically the same as it is in the manga, the big difference is somehow Smoker is less of a jobber in the anime.</br></br></br>   mfw you faggots are actually arguing about the fucking hat <br> mfw this idiot believes the fun easter egg in the Noland flashback is relevant </br>  <br> I noticed the straw hat in norland's flashback too I swear guys! <br>The only value of your post.</br></br>  <br>You act like there's only one of us saying that it might actually be more relevant than we've been led to believe.<br><br>And yet I'm also getting the sneaking suspicion that you're actually just one person who keeps posting shit like <br> <br><br><br><br> I think I fell for the bait, boys. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HOLY SHIT DAT MONKEY IS WEARING STRAW HAT THAT IS LUFFYS HAT</br>  <br>If that hat is relevant I'll throw myself off Tokyo Tower in full Bon Clay cosplay and a sign with /a/ taped to my chest</br>  <br>do you think kanjuro's cabbage is tasty</br>  <br> being so stupid you don't realize the poster who's arguing Luffy's hat is in Norland's flashback posted this picture <br>Also, proving you backtracked. One post ago it was an Easter egg, Luffy's hat but not significant, now you are back to arguing it isn't luffy's hat.</br></br>  <br>nope, I just got sick of talking to you since you had no proof besides<br> muh unique style <br> muh rare grass hat <br> muh kenshin </br></br></br></br>  <br>I am okay with this and will hold you to it, anon.<br><br>I assume we mean relevant beyond the whole "passing the torch to a new generation" thing, because it already holds some relevance, and it wouldn't be fun to have you sudoku now.<br><br>In return, I will stop talking about the hat because I'm pretty sick of the faggotry that has been achieved in this thread now too. I can't stop the others, but hopefully we can make it die off by the time the next thread rolls around.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please don't harm yourself when it's made even more obvious anon.</br>  <br> you <br>Funny thing is, I'm not even the guy you were arguing with the whole time. I was in the thread a few hours ago, and came back for like, two posts. I've never once mentioned Kenshin. That's definitely just Oda drawing it ahead of time because he could.</br></br>  <br> implying that me calling it an easter egg means it is Luffy's hat and not just a hat that looks like it </br>  <br> I'm not even the guy you were arguing with the whole time <br><br>of course not. Im not the guy you were talking to. I stopped reply around that Robin post and someone else has been arguing the point since</br></br></br>  <br> nope, I just got sick of talking to you since you had no proof <br> of course not. Im not the guy you were talking to. <br>Were you pretending to be that guy? That's silly. Why would you do a thing like that?</br></br></br>    <br><br><br><br>post yfw we've been passing down the hat arguing just like how the pirates have been passing down the hat<br> GODA is proven fact </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;And yet I'm also getting the sneaking suspicion that you're actually just one person <br> nope, I just got sick of talking to you since you had no proof besides... <br> &gt;Funny thing is, I'm not even the guy you were arguing with the whole time <br> of course not. Im not the guy you were talking to. <br><br>apparently both players left awhile ago and new people joined in. I left like 30 minutes ago</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> just like how the pirates have been passing down the hat <br>Starting at Roger of course</br></br>  <br>thats how laws power works though. he would one shot whitebeard if he could hit him. (whitebeard wouldnt go full retard and charge him though)</br>  <br><br> mfw </br></br>  <br>Is that picture supposed to connect that farm kid with Luffy?</br>  <br>Only in that they both possessed the same straw hat and so did Gol D Roger and Red Haired Shanks.</br>    <br>and how is that conveyed in that picture?</br>  <br>Haha silly bitch<br><br>WHY IS THERE NO FUCKING HENTAI OF HER<br><br>ACTUALLY, WHY IS THERE ALMOST NOTHING OF THIS ENTIRE SERIES<br><br>THEY HAVE 2 FUCKING LOLIS</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>In my defense, I am currently the torch bearer for the hat, and back when the discussion started four hours ago with posts like<br><br><br>I was defending the theory, because it seems reasonable as hell. That said, I mentioned it was a goddamn theory and have maintained that the entire time. <br><br>Hilariously just before that, I was debunking someone's retarded theory that Roger discovered the Saint Bliss and uncovered a secret about his past, and that the guy from the ship was actually in possession of the rubber fruit 200 years prior to the current time.<br><br>Okay so I said I'd stop so I'm done. I have better shit to do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It shows how Eichero Oda focused on Norland (The Liar) Montblanc. Luffy wasn't shown reading stories about Dr. hiluluk, Bellemere, or etc.<br>Hell, I think this is the only time Luffy was shown reading a book, like <br> even a retard knows Norland is important and the straw hat appearing in his flashback/story book is not a coincidence. <br>It is boring to see you attempt to turn a colored cover page of luffy reading about Norland into something more than a jab at your own comprehension, as proved when you believe it's an argument.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not who you're responding to but to imply that Luffy being entertained by a picture -book for children more than deep personal shit about his own crew who he already knows he loves implies the hat is the same is a bit of a stretch</br>  <br>usopp better pray to enel he never ends up in that town</br>  <br>How does Noland getting screentime mean anything about the hat? Being read about doesnt suddenly mean he's more important<br><br>And STILL doesnt prove that a random strawhat on a random kid is the one that Roger passed down to Shanks<br><br>I dont care that you like to headcanon it, but im not taking it as fact because you REALLY want it to be THE hat</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I am from the side of hat importance, and I want everyone to disregard this obvious bait.</br>  <br>I didn't imply that. I said Oda making a point of it on a colored cover page shows Oda's focus on the subject.<br><br>Your shit is your own keep it that way.<br><br>The straw hat is drawn on panel in Norlands flashback so I don't have a reason to argue about that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The straw hat <br>A straw hat<br><br>that hat could be pink for all you know</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bullshit. Post another one that looks like Luffy's.<br>There is not one.</br></br>  <br>Stop. Just stop.<br><br>You have not added anything to the thread, what you have said has been said before, and you are replying to bait. We need to collectively move past the hat.</br></br></br>    <br>According to some the colored manga is official.<br>Is the straw hat in Norland's flashback pink there? Is the band green or black?<br>I don't consider the colored manga as canon but it still at least proves you are grasping.</br></br></br>  <br> According to some the colored manga is official. <br><br>Is it colored by Oda?</br></br></br>  Chapter tonight  <br>Thank fuck, we need a change of topic.</br>  <br>Like I said I agree it's not canon, but it shows that you have to grasp to color it pink, and that you don't have to grasp at all to say it's the same straw hat.</br>  <br>Was that supposed to be a question? Or are we getting this one a day early?</br>  <br>Cool beans.</br>  <br> but it shows that you have to grasp to color it pink, <br><br>im not saying its pink, im saying you dont know WHAT color it is<br><br>Oda didnt color that page so it is unable to prove anything. You cant KNOW whether or not that hat is Roger's hat because Oda himself hasnt made any connections<br><br>It's all speculation based on probably's and perhaps'</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  so how many other characters died outside of flashbacks besides ace, whitebeard, roshio, and the countless amounts of impel down prisoners  <br>No it is based 100% on it being drawn by Oda in the Norland flashback. You could paint the hat it would still be Luffys though. It really doesn't need more of a basis than being drawn in canon.</br>  <br> You could paint the hat <br>you realize its straw, right?<br><br> No it is based 100% on it being drawn by Oda <br>then that means shit all because you can't prove its the same hat. Despite what you think, looking almost identical doesnt make it the same. It COULD just be the way Oda draws strawhats by default</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Countless amounts of impel down prisoners <br>You assume.<br><br>I mean, I assumed everyone died in Skypeia when they got their face lightning'd off, and somehow literally nobody died. I'm actually more skeptical of deaths in this series than I am in A Song of Ice and Fire.<br><br>It's fucking ridiculous, is what it is.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Citation needed<br>There's nothing at AP or redon's spic site</br></br>  <br>They didn't have anything up for last chapter either</br>  <br>The only other straw hats look different. The one in Norland's flashback doesn't.<br>It is the same hat to the eye, whereas all others are not, so it is the same straw hat.</br></br>  <br>Moria marine zombies were alive at the beginning of the war.</br>  <br> The only other straw hats look different. <br>yes and? I said default<br><br>he has a different style for imposter hats(Demaro, Saruyama) For plain strawhats? they look the same(Luffy, Livneel kid)</br></br></br></br>  <br>I already posted Masira's, which is just as plain as Luffy's, but very different.<br>Lvneel kid had the same straw hat as luffy is more likely than not given the fact straw hat luffy's straw hat is always unique all story.</br></br>  <br> Lvneel kid had the same straw hat as luffy is more likely than not given the fact straw hat luffy's straw hat is always unique all story. <br><br>yeah sure but it isnt proof</br></br></br>  <br> luffy's straw hat is always unique all story. <br><br>until the Lvneel kid of course which may be proof that Luffy's hat isnt unique rather than proving that it is</br></br></br>  <br><br>Okay, boys, we've had this discussion before.<br><br>Yes, the hat looks identical.<br>No, there is no proof that it is the same hat.<br>Yes, Luffy's hat is unique in all of One Piece except for the two instances with the Lvneel kid. This gives lots of credence to the theory, but it remains a theory.<br><br>Can we move on now?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yes, the hat looks identical. <br> No, there is no proof that it is the same hat. <br> Yes, Luffy's hat is unique in all of One Piece except for the two instances with the Lvneel kid. This gives lots of credence to the theory, but it remains a theory. <br><br>this is what ive been saying theory=/=fact</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes and that guy is not going to admit it, so you can both keep bashing your heads against the same wall everyone else was several hours ago, or we can drop this nonsense already and move onto something else.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128744397 <br> Or rather the probability that this hat is different is the same as the probability that Roger wore the same straw hat as Shanks and Luffy. <br><br>no. Lvneel kid was from hundreds of years ago. Roger to Shanks to Garp is a generation. And I really dont care about probability. I'm saying it isnt canon and there's no proof of it being canon.<br><br>It's fanon unless Oda steps up and proves otherwise</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dont see what the big deal is with debating<br><br>No one else is saying anything. It's not like anything else is happening in thread because no one else is here or there'd BE conversation running along ours</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>It baffles me that people don't realise it's just an easter egg</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats bullshit though because the same straw hat Luffy wears is literally drawn in the Norland canon.<br>You have to show it's a different hat, because there is no different hat that is depicted like it, and it is the most famous hat.</br></br>  <br> Thats bullshit though because the same straw hat Luffy wears is literally drawn in the Norland canon. <br>[Citation Needed]</br></br>  <br><br>There is no reason to doubt what is drawn in the flashback, and Luffy's straw hat is drawn there.<br>As shown by how every depiction of the straw hat luffy wears, regardless of who was wearing it, being actually his same hat.<br>The default assumption therefore isn't negated just because it's drawn in a place you didn't expect it to be</br></br></br></br>  <br> There is no reason to doubt what is drawn in the flashback <br><br>it's not about doubt, its about proof which you have none of. Insisting its the same hat doesnt magically make it the same hat no matter how many times you say it<br><br> and Luffy's straw hat is drawn there <br>[Citation Needed]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So I had an argument with some One Piece nerds.<br>Who would win in a fight Crocodile vs Enel.<br><br>I personally think Crocodile but everyone was saying Enel because he would have a 500mil bounty and he can use lightning. So /a/ who would win?</br></br></br>  <br>Again the drawing of the hat is proof, you are right it is not about doubt.<br>The same hat as the one Luffy wears is literally drawn in Norland's flashback.</br></br>  <br><br>Bounty has never been indicative of power level, merely a numerical representation of the threat people pose against the WG.<br><br>They gave an 80million dollar bounty to an 8 year old after all.</br></br></br></br>  <br> lightning against sand <br>depends on who oda wants to win</br></br>  <br>Blackbeard had a 0 bounty and captured a 550 million bounty to become a shichibukai.</br>  <br>thats where it was hard to pick.<br><br>lightning vs sand. like wtf looks like a stale match</br></br></br>  <br>If we go by logic, Enel would win because the heat from his electricity would turn Crocodile to glass.</br>  <br>just like it should have melted rubber?</br>  <br>That's why I said "If we go by logic".</br>  <br> Again the drawing of the hat is proof <br>it isnt.<br><br> The same hat as the one Luffy wears is literally drawn in Norland's flashback <br>[where is your proof?]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Enel would be able to hit Croc with physical attacks but he wouldn't be able to overcome sands insulation properties if he couldn't overcome rubber.<br><br>Crocodiles Sand being an insulator like rubber would make Enel tangible and therefore vulnerable to all Crocodile's attacks as well.</br></br></br>  <br>Assuming Croc busts out haki, then Croc.</br>  Fuji's making his move  <br> Maynard sighting <br><br>We better see Gambia. If he ends up banished to cover stories, I will be pissed</br></br></br>  <br>Oh shit</br>  <br>Yeah, that would be the most logical thing if Croc vs Enel happens.

Pepekekeko has a level 150 Inazuma.</br>  <br>tru</br>  <br>The whole Sendai class is nice. Sendai herself is my favorite, however. Marriage soon.</br>    <br>What level is she?</br>    <br>80.<br><br>Okay, maybe not as soon as I'd like. It's a struggle from here on out but I won't give up on her.</br></br></br>  <br>You're not even half way to 99.</br>    <br>You'd better have the mahjong kotatsu in game.</br>  <br>This event will be a good time to do that. Last event Suzuya and Kumano got themselves from 74 to 86 while I was dying farming for Isokaze.</br>  Best fairy pilot.  <br>This .<br><br>When you get her to 99, remember to wed her on the winter solstice.</br></br></br>  <br>I know. But unless the game disappears, I'll head towards that goal little by little.<br><br><br>Repair buckets are in high demand. The event is almost here and constant expeditions just aren't enough.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you get her? I ran through all my damecons and two Goyas before she finally showed up.</br>      <br>~500 should be the max you would ever need for clearing, anything else above that is just buffer for farming.<br><br><br>I got her. It took me 553 buckets, 101 successful sorties and countless failures to get her, though, and 8-12 levels for everyone on the E5 team.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 大将 </br>  <br>Akebono is Akebueno</br>  <br>What? They're slaves not people so it's alright.</br>  <br>One blueprint a month is enough for me.</br>  soon  That improves the Poi.  <br>Do some 5-4.

The only real exceptions is the Furutaka-Aoba superclass, since Fujikawa, Aoba's artist and Ugume all worked together to make a relatively similar uniform (down to Aoba and Kinugasa having similar hair color).<br><br>Parsely's kagerou have a uniform resembling Yoshinori's, though, and Drew's destroyers have a uniform similar to Shibafu's special types.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is she a cute boy too?</br>  <br> Post underappreciated girl <br> Kagafags not spamming  <br>Good thread, now we need a translation to make it perfect.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm retiring Kagaspam for Harunaspam.</br>  <br>spam daughterus pls</br>  <br>Will things be daijoubu?</br>  <br>Fuck off Kagafag, your kind are cancer</br>  <br> he still thinks the spammer is a Kagafag and didn't just use her because she's an easy target to piss off people <br>You never learn.</br></br>    <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128665<wbr>545/#q128690388<br>You Kagafags sympathizers are part of problems</br></wbr></br>  <br>Not the other way.

Her Tenryuu is probably the highest leveled ship in her fleet and getting married would raise the cap.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  Remember the spergout when Arpeggio episode 1 came out and people were raging about Shibafu subs? Good times.  Damn, reading about the Pacific War makes me wish I could have fought in it (and survived).  <br>Some people dont change opinions just to agree to the popular one, I still think the same as that day.</br>  <br>You mean that she is one of the most popular submarine out there? Getting as first submarine even a high priced figurine and nendo.</br>  <br><br>Would be interesting, but honestly the idea of surviving an attack but drifting on the ocean for a rescue that may never come scares the hell out of me.</br></br>  <br>I'm talking about the artist having a level 150 Den. There's no way it'll be any different with Koharu, the story has pretty much been leading to that.<br><br><br>The only reason people got mad was because they took Iona away from them.</br></br></br></br>  Translation time<br>Fubuki: I'm Fubuki, the new ship that has been appointed here!<br>Fubuki: I'm still inexperienced but...<br>Fubuki: I'll try my best!<br>Nagato: I see<br>Nagato: So you're that Fubuki-kun...<br>Nagato: I'm Nagato<br>Nagato: I'll be counting on you<br>Nagato: Fubuki-kun! What's the meaning of today's sortie!?<br>Nagato: You didn't move like you was practiced at all!<br>Fubuki: I-I'm sorry!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only thing I remember how bad the threads were because people were butthurt what the anime wasn't a straight 1:1 adaptation.</br>  <br>Why? It sounded like a terrible experience unless you were a badass pilot.</br>  <br>Nagato: Were you hurt?<br>Fubuki: No, I...<br>Nagato: It's good then! Well, maybe you're still not used to it yet...<br>Nagato: In a battle, you just need to stay calm and act accordingly<br>Nagato: Just rest for today<br>Fubuki: Y-Yes!<br>Fubuki: Nagato-san is scary, but...<br>Fubuki: Deep down she's so nice and cool. I really look up to her!!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, it would be just as bad. <br>If your plane gets shoot down you would be dead with the plane or shot as you float on.<br><br>The top if not the worst case would be stuck <br>on a sinking ship with no way to get out.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Nagato: Kanabun!!! (A kind of bettle)<br>Nagato: Kanabun!!Kanabun!!Kanabun!!<br>Nagato: The grass is delicious! The grass is delicious!<br>Nagato: The grass is delicious!<br>Nagato: Delicious grass!!<br>Nagato: Deliciouuuuuuuuuuuss!!!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's why I said badass pilot. Not a mook pilot. It seems like the survivors with the most wild stories to tell were pilots.</br>    <br>You've gone mad, Nagato!</br>  Fufufu, ya scared?  <br>Oh God</br>  <br>What went wrong there?</br>  <br>It's time! I've been waiting for this.</br>  <br>The fact that it was from the god itself and it doesnt even look plump was completely dissapointing.</br>  <br>Kisaragi: Nagato-saaan!!<br>Nagato: What's wrong?<br>Kisaragi: Hurry!!<br>Mutsuki: Well... I baked some cookies for Nagato-san, so...<br>Mutsuki: Will you accept them?<br>Nagato: Cookies huh? Well...<br>Nagato: Actually I'm not good with sweet things<br>Nagato: But since they're something Mutsuki-kun made for me<br>Nagato: I'll accept them<br>Nagato: Thank you, Mutsuki-kun</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think we lost her, Damn woman!<br><br> my sides </br></br></br>  <br>What about the guys on the O'Bannon tossing potatoes though?</br>  <br>What is this supposed to mean? Nagato, why?</br>  <br> Hidden depth Nagato </br>  <br>Nagato: Yahooooooo!! I got some Mutsuki-tan's cookies!!!<br>Nagato: Mutsuki-tan's cookies!! Mutsuki-tan's cookies!!!!<br>Nagato: Ohoooooooooooo!!<br>Nagato: Delicious!! Deliciouuuuussss!! Mutsuki-tan's cookies are so sweeeeeet!!!<br>Nagato: Mutsuki-taaaaaaaan!!!<br>Nagato: I love Mutsuki-tan!!<br>Nagato: I love Mutsuki-tan so much!!!<br>Nagato: Huh!?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess she lost it because of constant boredom.</br>  Can low level (=&lt;50) Teitokus hope to achieve something in events?  Navy has the history of having either the highest or lowest loss rate of all branches. <br><br>It's a hit or miss thing</br></br>    <br>Shirayuki: Nagato-saan<br>Nagato: What is it?<br>Nagato: What!? What's happened, Hatsuyuki-kun!?<br>Shirayuki: Well, this is...<br>Shirayuki: Someone stole Hatsuyuki-chan's underwear<br>Nagato: What did you say!?<br>Nagato: This must be the Admiral's doing again!!<br>Nagato: I won't forgive him!!!<br>Hatsuyuki: Don't worry<br>Nagato: This Nagato will absolutely catch the culprit for you!<br>Nagato: That's why, you don't need to cry anymore</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because you take part in something important in your life.</br>  <br>Please don't tell me she's going to pull out the underwear from her pocket.</br>  <br> Hatsuyuki: Don't worry <br>Shouldn't it be Nagato?</br></br>  <br>I can't wait to know what happens next</br>  wo  <br>Shirayuki: Nagato-san is really reliable!!<br>Hatsuyuki: Yeah!<br>Nagato: Ooohhhhhhh!!<br>Nagato: Hatsuyuki-chan's panty ooohhhh yeahhhhh!!<br>Nagato: Hatsuyuki-chan's panty!!<br>Nagato: Pantyyyyyy!!!<br>Nagato: This is really great!!

No moeshit. No tropes. Just a touching story that goes from A to B without appealing to manchildren who want to be eternal high school students  <br>....its kind of depressing most modern series are nothing but moeshit and tropes.</br>   learn moon <br> rewatch haibane renmei <br> finally understand the name stuff <br><br>I wish they hadn't discontinued the novel</br></br></br></br>  <br>Except it's not slice of life at all, it has a solidified plot which kicks into gear from episode 6 and never really returns to "Rakka goes around doing odd jobs".</br>  <br>There is a way to say what he wants to say and what you want to say and that would be<br><br>Haibane Renmei is what I wish slice of life were, so it comes out as "how slice of life should be"<br><br>The reason why you're saying Haibane Renmei isn't slice of life is because you're taking other anime that became standards of slice of life and using it as a standard of comparison.<br><br>But what that poster wants you to do is use Haibane Renmei as the *actual* standard of slice of life, and use it to compare it to other anime. Haibane Renmei has slice of life features in the beginning but also has a heart and a plot and that's what the standard of slice of life should be, not what you're taking it for to begin with.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There was a novel?</br>  <br>was it a novel, was it a doujinshi, now I don't really remember but there was some material going on before the anime aired and it was cancelled because of the anime<br><br>I think it was called "old home no haibane-tachi"</br></br></br>  <br>Aaaaah....<br><br>I read that. It's really just a full chronology of Reiki's running away from Old Home.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you know the other meaning of Kuu's name?</br>  <br>It's the other reading of the kanji sora (sky) 空, "クウ”<br><br>The reading "kuu" for sora usually means "empty" or "void" but in this case it literally means sky<br><br>I guess it's obvious from the opening scene as she is looking to the vast sky iirc.<br><br>Reki's would be a big mindfuck if I were watching it for the first time with the knowledge though</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How do the true names work?</br>  <br>So that means that, no matter what, Kuu was destined to perform the Day of Flight?<br><br>.... see this is why I don't buy the idea that she was a suicide?</br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but iirc they were different kanji which have the same pronunciation as the old ones. So your spoken name remains the same but the meaning changes. I don't remember anybody's alternative name though.</br>  <br>Hold your heart anon, here it goes I'll try to make it simple<br>Reki's name comes from the kanji 礫 you have 2 readings for this kanji, "koishi" and "reki" (which is how's she called), which means pebble<br><br>but forget reki reading for a sec and just focus on koishi reading.<br><br>Koishi is also a way to spell small stones with 2 kanjis by using 小(ko)石(ishi) 2 kanjis, the first 小 means "small" and the second 石 means "stones"<br><br>I remember on the anime she says that her name stemmed from the kanji "koishi" 礫, but then the mindfuck is when she says<br><br>"'Reki' is the small stones(小石) that represents pebbles (礫), the true name was something teared off... 轢 (Reki)(which means runned over) "<br><br>Now you notice how beautiful this is you got these two kanjis 礫 (reki, koishi, pebbles) and 轢 (reki, runned over)<br><br>Now notice how similar they are, they are identical except for the left part on the kanji, look very closely you see the kanji for koishi 礫 has 石 (stone) on the left side, and the kanji for 轢 has the radical 車 (car) on the left side.<br><br>it's a little hard to understand but just try to observe 轢(runned over) and 礫 (small stones) and you'll see the difference<br><br>Now my mind was blown was not only on the choice words but the choice of verbs, when Reki said "the true name that was teared apart" the verb she used for tear was 引き裂かる (reads hikisakaru), and the verb to be run over is 轢 (reki) and the verb was "hikaretanda" (conjugaded as runned over)<br><br>So she says "hikisakareta mono...sou hikaretanda"<br><br>So it was a very smart alliteration with the "hik" and makes you understand why she used that verb for "teared apart", her true name was teared apart because she was runned over.<br><br>My face when I saw that scene again</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yeah.<br><br>Yeah, they were dead.</br></br>    <br> Slice of Life <br> Story that goes from A to B <br>But that's wrong. The point of the genre is to NOT do that. I don't like SoL but it is what it is and that means some other fags are liking it that way. Let them have their fun.</br></br></br>  <br> Haibane Renmei <br> Not moeshit </br></br>  <br><br> Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World. <br><br>Fuck that book. Fucking ending was shit.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Haibane Renmei is one of the best moeblobs ever.</br></br>  <br>By the way there's actually more stuff and I just can't remember everything, but that scene was really really amazing I could probably make a few posts more about it but we're cool like this</br>  <br>MAKE MORE POSTS<br><br>We need to keep this thread alive!</br></br></br>  <br>Every good thread goes beyond page ten eventually. This one's not going anywhere just yet.</br>  What are some of the theories of this show?<br>I finally got around to watching it around 6 months ago but they are never any threads.</br>  <br>...dammit anon you're making me remember how much Rakka looked up to Reiki. She wanted those moments with Reiki to never end ;_;</br>  <br>Depends on what you are looking for. Aska question and you'll find different theories. Like Lain, it should be noted that every person ahs their own different take of Haibane Renmei, and no two opinions should be 'too' similar.<br><br>That being said, tis not as avant-garde or  pretentious  as Lain, so Haibane Renmei makes sense, yet, still leaves enough mystery for interpretation and self-reflection. A Christian take on this series is as possible as an agnostic take and a Buddhist take.</br></br></br>  We know that Reiki was a paint, but do you think Rakka would have learnt to paint, to try and recreate the likeness of Reiki?<br><br>Also, would Rakka have eventually taken over Reiki's job? I can't imagine her collective light leaves under the Glie's walls forever.</br></br>  <br>Well, the production was extremely small. The budged was almost non-existent. Also, the TV partly financing it where it was airing was quite fucking with the show. Practically no promotion, insane timeslot and airing shifts viewers weren't aware of and such shit caused that at the time the show was airing almost no one knew about it. But built decent following in Japan over time.</br>  <br>Alright.<br><br>Take from my previous post I focused more on the runned over thing, but check this out her sentence was this<br><br>レキは小石を現す轢だが、真の名は引き裂かれたもの、礫だ。<br><br>Now this is when you have to hear her voice saying, pronouncing each word so you can fully understand how incredible this is<br><br>The way to read is<br>"Reki(レキ) wa koishi(小石) wo arawasu tsubute (礫) daga, shin no na wa hikasareta mono, sou da hikaretanda" <br><br>Take the first part before the comma<br><br>Reki wa koishi wo arawasu tsubute.<br><br>This translates as "Reki is the small stones that represents throwing stones (tsubute)"<br><br>Tsubute as a reading for 礫 (reki) means "stones that you throw"<br><br>As far as my interpretation goes it really ought to have something to do with misfortune and separation, "tsubute" for throwing stones usually means the ones you throw at people.<br><br>As for the aliteration that's when she says "そうだ、引き裂かれたる者。そうだ轢かれたんだ"<br><br>If you memorized all the kanjis from now you should see them "teared apart 引き裂かれる" (hikisakareru) and runned over 轢かれたんだ (hikaretanda)<br><br>The whole thing reads "Sou da, hikisakaretaru mono. Sou da, hikaretanda"<br><br>Translation:<br>"That's right, what was teared apart. That's right, what was runned over"<br><br>You notice if you read the original japanese you can see it just sounds very poetic with alliteration.<br><br>Man, that scene was really good. It's kinda hard to understand though, maybe one day I'll draw a picture or something</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That reminds me.<br><br>Why do people still remember/like this show years after its airing? I don't deny its one of my favourite shows of all time, but I am impressed by its lingering memory/presence.</br></br></br>  <br> "Reki(レキ) wa koishi(小石) wo arawasu tsubute (礫) daga, shin no na wa hikasareta mono, sou da hikaretanda" <br>Ugh, I haven't slept too well lately, should've double checked this. The second part after the comma is not "sou da hikaretanda" it's actually "Reki da" (礫だ)<br><br>That doesn't harm anything on what I said though so you can read at peace.<br><br>Not that anyone will take their time to read this anyway</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's one chapter doujinshi which freatured only the basic idea and nothing more. I think I have never seen more than three pages out of that.<br><br>Then there's one volume doujinshi the anime was based on. It provided only a basic setting and characters. In anime Yoshitoshi is scedited with script but director Tokoro Tomokazu actually provided much help and thanks to him got the whole idea and story shaped up.<br><br>After anime aired there was published a special artbook which featured some material created before the anime, production notes, art by Yoshitoshi and even some information explaining on the anime and its symbolism. I think the scans are available somewhere but not sure if they are translated.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I think I read that back in 2010 and all I remember was a message by yoshitoshi saying he won't write the doujinshi anymore since they're animating the series</br>  <br>Don't be so pessemistic. Of course people read it, I'm not sure how much of it I actually understood though.</br>  <br><br>I remember a bunch of TL notes on that last episode and I still didn't get much of it</br></br>  <br>sum up what he said<br> the kanji of stones and kanji of runned over are almost identical and seve as a pun <br> the verb tear apart and the verb runned over sound very similar and both said together in the sentence sounds like nip poetry <br> the kanji for small stones is a pun on throwing stones which may mean what brings misfortune on others <br><br>that's what I got from it anyway</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>These? The first two pretty much cover the same material in the first two anime episodes, while the last is a flashback to Reki's early years. There have been scanlations of all 3 out for years.</br>  <br><br> &gt;a pun on throwing stones which may mean what brings misfortune on others <br><br> &gt;You now remember that Midori threw rocks at Reki <br> &gt;and that Reki was ostracised from everybody else because of ehr black wings <br> &gt;probably because they most likely thought she'd bring misfortune <br><br>The feels.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All of this in 2 sentences<br><br>Shit man, legit one of the best written original anime i've ever seen<br><br>Whoever thought of this was really damn original, I really enjoyed watching this after learning moon.<br><br>A lot of stuff made more sense</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy</br>  <br> &gt;Whoever thought of this was really damn original <br><br>aBe Yoshitoshi was the writer of Haibane Renmei and most likely came up with its names, dieas and themes.<br><br>Its why I prefer both NieA_7 and Haibane Renmei to Lain. aBe didn't write Lain &amp; Texhnolyze, Konana did. That explains why it ahs such a heavy-handed cyberpunk element.<br><br>But aBe's dieas and themes hit more to home, and resonate with you. NieA was lakcing, and I still feel thata series like Haruhi Suzumiya better explored what NieA tried to explore. But dammit: aBe tried.<br><br>And for Haibane Renmei, he hit the ball out of the park. Its a very poetic and moving series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Great witch of pachel <br><br>It didn't have the same luck as haibane, and I'm never reading it<br><br>never<br>ever<br>never<br>ever ever</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why?<br><br>Just wondering. I haven't read it, but I'm wondering why you're emphasizing that you'd never read it.</br></br></br>  <br>My first contact with Yoshitoshi was when I was shopping for light novels and saw that LN "welcome to the NHK" and some friend of mine told me he was a huge fan of the illustrator<br><br>He also told me to watch haibane renmei too</br></br></br>  <br>I'd say it actually gains another layer in English (unless the meaning exists in Japanese, too?): one may say "the stone is cast/thrown" to mean a fate that is set in motion or a course that cannot be altered. Luckily enough, it could be, of course.</br>  <br>The doujinshis are really hard to find and you can find a few volumes, but not all them<br><br>I've been waiting for the first edition for awhile now, the ones I found are pre-owned</br></br></br>  Can we all agree this is worst ABe?  <br> yfw his worst blows the fuck out most of what comes out these days <br><br>I can agree on this at least</br></br></br>   you weren't born in the universe where haibane renmei is successful and moeshit is niche   Lain = Tex &gt; HR &gt;&gt;&gt; Niea  <br>I sometimes wish aBe had illustrated/designed some of the characters of my favourite shows.<br><br>I can think of one character that I wish aBe had designed, though aBe would most likely hate that series.</br></br></br>  <br>i would rather have an oversaturation of shit and having some fantastic niche shows 3 times a year<br>makes it alot easier to watch anime since i can easily sort out the shit</br></br>  <br>NieA_7 is awful, it's the worst thing he had involvement with by far.</br>  <br>I'm going to be polite, and say you're dumb. And of course, very wrong<br><br>~<br><br>The correct ranking is:<br><br>Haibane Renmei &gt;&gt;&gt; NieA &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; texhnolyze = Lain<br><br>Texh is depressing and nihilistic as all hell, while Lain isn't convoluted and hard to make sense of, if at all.<br><br>But NieA ahs somethign to say, even if it fails. And Haibane Renmei? Well, it pretty much could do what NieA couldn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Fuck's wrong with you<br><br>NieA may not be that well animated/rendered, but its FAR better than a lot of pointless shit out there in the market today. And its not pretentious like Lain. Hell, if I wanted a DECENT cyberpunk anime, I'd watch Dennou Coil.</br></br></br>  <br>Lain isn't pretentious. It's just written complexly.</br>  <br><br>Fuck fof back to your Lain thread<br><br><br><br><br>This is a Haibane thread here. Leave the folks at Old Home alone!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus fuck I didn't mean to start a fucking war. I didn't even say HR was bad. I meant to reply to </br>  <br>The first part from C81? I have a copy, but ABe doodled on it and I'm not going to break it</br>  <br>Agnostic take? As in we neither know the origins of the haibane and where they go afterwards and it's all existentialist? First of hearing an "agnostic take" of anything really.</br>  <br> Texh is depressing and nihilistic as all hell <br>Is that supposed to be an argument to why it's not as good as HR or NieA?<br> Lain isn't convoluted and hard to make sense of, if at all <br>Isn't it good to make your own interpretation of it all though? It's not as much of a clear story like Haibane but it sure involves themes and ideas that make sense once you link them in your own way.</br></br></br></br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/jltichpozp.web<wbr>m</wbr>  Hello, /a/, are you still waiting? Or have you accepted that it will never happen?  <br>Well, think of it this way::<br><br>You CAN'T prove that its an afterlife. You can't prove that there's a God in this series, nor can you prove that the Day of Flight would either take them to Heaven (the Christian take) or reincarnation/Nrivana (the buddhist take)<br><br>It could very well be that each haibane were created 'on the spot' and had what they thought were memories, but, may not be actually their own. Remember that the Haibane have no full memory of their previous lives, only their dream. This could be taken very liberally.<br><br>Also consider that the Wasshi are very vague on who constitutes the Haibane Renmei, what happens to the sinbound if they don't pass the test, whats beyond the walls, and so on and so forth. I have 'my' theories of the show, but I'm not gonna lie when I state that these theories are based on ( a) my interpretations and with that ( b) my biases.<br><br>Consider what Rakka said to Nemu in episode 5. They were writing a creation story, but Rakka suggested writing a God that 'sleeps'. Nemu found it disrespectful, but Rakka made an important point: its supposed to remidn the reader that its written by humans.<br><br>And thats the thing: how can we be certain that anything thats sacred/divine is definite. Heck, I'm being charitable by considering an agnostic take on this series, I'm willing to consider there could be an atheistic take on this series. Or that atheists may outright disregard it. *shrug*</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the Despera anime was announced six years ago </br>  <br> But it will. <br><br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-01-10/yoshitoshi-abe-despera<wbr>-project-is-moving-forward-with-new<wbr>-director/.83127</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>  He honestly believes that. <br>In all seriousness, I would love to have your naivety, anon. I would love to live in a beautiful dream that it will once be completed.</br></br>  <br> Isn't it good to make your own interpretation of it all though? <br>I feel like "interpreting" Lain is a bit more fuzzily defined. You have to figure out what's going on first, and then try to figure out what was meant, but ultimately the latter part seems fruitless. Computers sure are powerful? Cyberspace would be pretty weird to live in? Lain is really cute? All of these are true, but they just don't speak to me. It's like "well yeah, obviously that. And?"</br></br>  <br> Computers sure are powerful? Cyberspace would be pretty weird to live in? Lain is really cute? <br><br>All of those completely miss the point of what the show is trying to convey. Watch again and take notes. Don't spend so much time on the technology - it's not what Lain is about.</br></br></br>  <br>Its a personal/subjective argument. You like Texhnolyze, good for you.<br><br>But I hate it. I hate it because everyone dies at the end, some with a meaningless death. Life is already harsh, and I don't need a TV series to remind me of its harshness.<br><br> &gt;it sure involves themes and ideas that make sense once you link them in your own way. <br><br>Here's the thing. Haibane Renmei does the same thing, but, it has some concrete/definite imagery that you can actually make sense of whats going on. The only exception is the evry last episode of Haibane Renmei, where a certain sequence could have taken place entirely in a dream, or may have actually happened.<br><br>But in Lain, you have a lot of metaphorical/symbolic imageyr that looks nice but, when you try to dissetc it, it leaves too much to the imagination that, if a laymans ees it, he's going to write it off as the animators being pretentious. Look to episode 1. There's a scene where smoke rises out of Lain's fingers. What is the point of that? What is the point of the alien that peaked into Lain's room? (I have my own reading of it, but I'm just saying) What is the point of Lain seeing her doppelganger? Was she actually physically there? Or did her physical form take on a life of its own?<br><br>Do you see what I'm getting at? A series like NieA_7 and Haibane Renmei makes sense. But Lain is so interpretive that people who want a story with meat will easily write it off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I believe... I believe that Haruhi Season 3 will be made.<br><br>I believe it as much as Despera getting made and aBe finally making a Haibane season 2. Or at least a series that *he* himself wrote, thats like NieA and Haibane.<br><br>I also dream of a day when aBe wouldd raw Haruhi Suzumiya. Its a pipe dream, and it'll never happen.<br><br>But its fun to dream.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That sounds like no fucking fun whatsoever. I'll pass. Lit-Crit's bad enough without subjecting YOURSELF to it.<br><br>Or, see  who has explained it much better.</br></br></br>  <br><br>thank you anon, I enjoyed the anime but thanks to you I have a deeper appreciation for the work that was put into the subtleties of this anime.</br></br>  <br>Nothing you said is an actual critique of the show, and this layman you're talking about seems an awful lot like yourself.</br>  <br> I don't like Tex because it's not escapism <br>Tex was trying to show that life will always be shitty.<br><br> But Lain is so interpretive that people who want a story with meat will easily write it off <br>It's fine if you don't want to spend time interpreting stuff but it doesn't mean the show doesn't know where it's doing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, I understand where he's getting at. Lain is very complicated. If you want something to enjoy and think about on the first watch, Lain is not for you.</br>  <br>IIRC it was one of Grumpy Jii-san's favorites.</br>  <br> mature animes for mature peoples such as myself </br>  <br> &gt;life will always be shitty. <br>Yes, and thank you for pointing out the obvious. I'm not going to like a show for stating something we already have accepted. And there's nothing wrong with a certain amount of escapism.<br><br> &gt;it doesn't mean the show doesn't know where it's doing. <br><br>That, is where I want to disagree with you. I don't deny that both aBe and Chiaki had some clear intentions/ideas they wanted to portray in the show. And Lain was a multimedia platform that was also explored in game as well as an anime.<br><br>But I can't help but feel that they were a bit clumsy when making Lain. Consider that every series they made after Lain, even texhnolyze, had some level of concrete storytelling/symbolism. Those series 'made sense'. but Lain seemed too freeform. if anything, Lain would be at a time when aBe and crew were still trying to figure things out. And, my interpretation would be valid, sicne Lain is meant to be freeform.<br><br>So no, I don't think Lain is the masterpiece some make it out to be. Is it an important series? Well, why not. But its not 'that' great</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't like Tex because it's not escapism <br>Escapism is more aspect the person perceiving than the work itself. If you watch something to provide you a brief moment of relief from reality you are escaping. If someone else watches the same show but gains something from it like impulses for thoughts then the same shows becomes a valuable experience. That's why I value opinion that "Everything is interesting depending on which way you are looking at it." <br><br>If you discard that then everything is escapism since you watch/read it so it would provide impulses which life otherwise isn't providing for you (fun, thoughts, aesthetic pleasure, et cetera).</br></br></br></br>  <br> But I can't help but feel that they were a bit clumsy when making Lain <br>Does a story need to be precise for it to be called a "masterpiece"? Most art is abstract afterall.</br></br>  <br> Lain is very complicated. If you want something to enjoy and think about on the first watch, Lain is not for you. <br>To be fair, you don't necessarily have to sit down and think about the show for hours to guess the symbolism and rewatch it just to enjoy it. Sure, you have to pay attention a bit more but I just enjoyed the story of Lain. The convoluted visuals and overall narrative gave Lain a fantastic atmosphere.<br>Not to say that Haibane isn't amazing in itself, of course. It was just a lot more laid back.</br></br></br>  <br>The only anime series he gave five stars to were Haibane Renmei, Aria, Gunbuster, Bokurano, and Seirei no Moribito</br>  <br>I only watched Lain once, and enjoyed it a lot. But it just seems kind of hollow, like - what exactly was I enjoying? I don't remember. Can I just step out and trust that the magic will happen twice? Or would I ruin my memories of it by looking behind the curtain and seeing that it was all just random junk that doesn't actually follow any deeper meaning?</br>  <br>Which is weird, because I love all of those except for Aria, which is one of my least favorites.<br><br>Different strokes for different folks, I guess.</br></br></br>  <br>Not precise. But at least 'make sense'.. Whats the sense in seeing smoke arise from Lain's fingers? Or Lain eventually seeing the figures of people around ehr turn into shapes?<br><br>Another series did this kind of thing - Madoka. Especially the movie. But in the movie, and near the end, they gave a very concrete explanation as to why it was going on. But Lain doesn't do that.<br><br><br>There are different definitions of art. Consider that dipping a shark in a pool of plastic will not be conceived as art by a lot of people. (a cookie for anyone who gets that reference)<br><br><br>I guess another way to put is, "I have limits". I can't value everything. And I know what I like. Thats not say I won't consider a series in full, and I did watch Texhnolyze to the end in order to form an opinion about it. But no, I still don't like it.<br><br><br>Well I am a layman, thank you very much. I don't have time to invest into watching anime 24 hours a day, and my anime diet is very limited at best. I may have taken literature at university level, but I hated Sylvia Plath and Samuel Beckett's 'texts for nothing' with a passion. In contrast, a play like Amadeus, or even Marat/Sade actually makes sense, and are trying to say something.<br><br>I admit I have not watched a lot of anime, but I know what I like, and I know the type of anime, as well as the type of stories I like. And Lain isn't one of them. And I know enough people who have called the series 'Serial Experiments Lame". Do I think it has something for the people who treasure it? Well, why not. But its not for me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok, now your clearly just baiting.</br>  <br> &gt;give an honest opinion <br> &gt;its called baiting <br><br>oh lol<br><br>~<br><br>How about we go back to discussing Haibane Renmei?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not random, I can promise you that. When you're rewatching keep what you know in mind. Interpret everything as it would make sense within the story based on what info you've got.</br>  <br> &gt;Implying I'd rewatch it. <br><br>Anyway, can we keep the Lain discussion to the thread here  and keep this a Haibane based thread?<br><br>I think we were doing good for a Haibane thread, and I'm more interested in the anon who had noticed something interesting about the names.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it could be said that those examples could be merely red herrings in the story or the progressive delusions and degeneration of Lain's sanity/mind and the physical world around her.<br><br>I also think you have to realize it's a surreal series. A lot of the beauty/weakness of surrealism is in its superficiality: what you see is what you get. Its abstract symbolism is its strength and weakness.</br></br></br>  <br>Because it was good. Why shouldn't it be remembered?</br>  <br>I'm going to redirect you to my answer here <br><br>Lets keep this a Haibane based thread.</br></br></br>  <br>Cynical answer: because (evidently) pretending to understand Lain sends a much better signal of how refined your tastes are than actually understanding Haibane, which any idiot can do.<br><br>Reasonable answer: a lot of good shows just get forgotten because they never reached any kind of critical mass of viewers to sustain a fanbase. Haibane is one of the ones that toes the line - typically a good thread about it here will leave a 'tail' of other threads over time as people read about it, watch it, and ask questions here.</br></br></br>  <br>I think thats a comforting thought.</br>  First time I've ever heard/seen an anon saying japanese helped him understand something in an anime<br><br>So the kanji for pebbles is a pun for throwing stones and that was why they threw stones at reki<br><br>and the kanji for throwing stones is almost visually identical to the kanji of being runned over<br><br>I wish I could try to get this poetry thing, I can't read japanese for shit so I dont know how to pronounce all that but I fucking believe you</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> pretending to understand Lain <br><br>Why are just trying to antagonize?</br></br></br>  <br>ABe then: deep and poetic<br>ABe now: boatsluts <br><br>What the fuck happened?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I said it was cynical.

This was a really lovely thread and you're all great people  <br>Haibane Renmei is one of my all time faves. The story is just beautiful, it says more in it's 13 episodes than a lot of animes do in a full season</br>  <br>13 episodes is a full season</br>  I thought Lain was ok, but the story is too abstract and impenetrable to actually enjoy watching. It's one of those things you watch to talk to other people about what was going on, like EoE, not because it's an enjoyable watch.

You can half-guess the story, but too much within Lain is so avant-garde that some people will write it off as pretentious (like smoke rising out of Lain's fingers, or Lain seeing a doppelganger come 'out of her')<br><br>Grnated there were concrete moments - like the end of episode 4, when Lain warded off the MIB with what seemed like a psychic attack. But the anime didn't have enough of these fairly concrete moments.<br><br>In contrast, you actually know whats going on in NieA and Haibane.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Lain is pretentious and doesn't really have a point with tis surreal visuals. <br><br>It's not, and yes it does. It's not concrete by any means, but there is a point to everything that is shown on the screen.</br></br></br>  Lats lain thread 404'd but there's a new one <br><br><br>This is my response <br><br>Please keep Lain discussion off the Haibane thread.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you don't want Lain discussion in the thread, stop fucking talking about Lain in the thread, then maybe people will stop replying.</br>    <br>Don't know what you're trying to convey, but don't deny it's your own fault. You didn't have to keep mentioning Lain if you didn't want it talked about.</br>  <br> Rekki will never hold me tenderly in her arms. <br><br>I may as well just drink Bleach now.</br></br></br>    <br>Let it go, anon. She had to move on.<br><br>That she was no longer sinbound was already a blessing.</br></br></br>  I like the idea that the town is populated by the souls of the best of humanity, to help guide the Haibane back to the light  <br>Actually, I have a different theory.<br><br> They humans of Glie are all angels. The crows too. And the toga are the angels who come to Earth from time to time <br><br>If anyone is interested, I can post my theory in full.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;he doesn't get the reference so he keeps making the same fucking mistake <br><br>Get gone.</br></br></br>  <br>Go ahead</br>  <br>Alright, ehre goes.<br><br>My theory is predicated on the following assumptions:<br><br>1. You can't actually die in Glie (but you can fall terribly sick for ages on end)<br><br>2. There is no sex in Glie. Also, the place is very mild mannered.<br><br>The justification for 1. is the scene where Hyoko did not die from the fall. He climbed a fairly high height from which he could've been killed. But he didn't die. The other is from another assumption - if Glie is set in the afterlife, how can you die within an afterlife?<br><br>The justificationf rom 2. goes something like this. In a scene where Reki gets angry with Hyoko and Midori, she shows an index finger. I took this to mean that she actually wanted to show her middle finger but, and because such an action may have been forgotten to her, she could only manifest it as an index finger.<br><br>Mind, you these are all assumptions but, and due to the ambiguous nature of the show, I work with these.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With those assumptions, here's the theory:<br><br>The humans of Glie are actually angels who guide the haibane, the deceased into the afterlife.<br><br>One way to consider this is to note which humans are attached to which Haibane. Nemu's teacher and Kana's superior all have stereotypes that may exist in the actual world. While it could be argued that they'd exist in any setting, it could be possible that they are just normal humans. Perhaps but, it could also be argued that play a role specifically to guide a certain haibane to a set path (Reki becoming the teacher to younger haibane, Kana being the clockworker for the town)<br><br>The best way to udnerstand this is to consider that the humans of Glie harbour no ill-intent to the Haibane and have, from time to time, dropped hints that have helped the Haibane along their way. Any negative actions a Haibane does is usually of their own choosing, and not from intervention from a 'human'.<br><br>But what about the librarian, you might ask. She was pregnant. Yes, but, did she ever state whow as the father. She also did say 'a life from nowhere'. Assuming there is no sex in Glie, the humans in Glie auto-reproduce. Or rather, they get pregnant, but they only do so to reinvigorate a memory of childbirth and pregnancy to the Haibane.<br><br>The best way to think of this theory is to consider that there are no pregnant Haibane at Abandoned Factory.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, what are the Toga then?<br><br>The Toga are two things:<br><br>1. Angels who have been delegated to leave Glie and collect items from the real world to help Glie seem mroe familair to the Haibane <br><br>or <br><br>2. Sinbound Haibane who did not receive the blessing but nonetheless perform the same duty/<br><br>I'm more inclined to 1, but I think 2 is possible.<br><br>Also, what is the Wasshi? Some have suggested that he is a sinbound haibane who knwos a lot, but, it seems out of character for a man, who is so enlightened of whats goes on in Glie, to have been sinbound.<br><br>So, to me the Wasshi is actually a 'human'. Or rather, an angel, and perhaps the caretaker of the city of Glie. Its 'mayor', so to speak. That he wears the fake wings and mask is simply a guise and symbol of status.<br><br>Then whoa re the actual sinbound haibane? Well, remember the silent temple workers who also fake wings? Those are the sinbound haibane - doomed to work at the temple and be silent.<br><br>A final though - the people of Old Home dug up relics that showed some of the history of Glie, from which Rakka learnt the hand signals. While I thought this may have hinted a much more ancient history to Glie, the Wasshi spoke as if the hand symbols and knowledge was already well known to them.<br><br>I think there's a lot more to the Wasshi then aBe is letting us know but, and for the moment, I shall pretend that he's a very big angel, simply doing his duty.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That being said, there is one possible criticism of my theory. The first is the one time some humans saw the Haibane as a 'lucky charm'. that behaviour wasn't very angelic. I agree, but I shall note that it wasn't malicious either.<br><br>Also, and back  - what about the dead bird at the bootm of the well that Rakka found? Well, Rakka also did say that she ahd another dream at the bottom of the well. SO here's a question: did Rakka actulally find the skeleton of a bird at the bottom of the well? Or did she 'dream' that she found it?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Nice, but I still think the humans of Glie are actually real humans.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's a pocket world I feel it's more likely they're volunteering dead humans from the afterlife or beings placed there for their role.</br>  <br>Artland could.</br>  <br>If its the latter, I'd call them angels because of said role.</br>  <br>dat quality</br>  Wow.<br><br>200 posts. Not bad, guys.</br></br>  <br><br>We need more quality shots from this show. Haibane Renmei had A LOT of quality.</br></br>    Would you a Haibane moe series?  Yeah obviously they were dead. Reki's dream was her getting hit by a fucking train, and is the only one of the dreams that can definitely be attributed to death and suicide on top of that, which is why when abe reveals it at the very end it definitively confirms what is hinted by Raka's experience in the well and ties the entire anime together in a matter of seconds. Reki is saved, the existence of sinbound haibane, as well haibane themselves, are explained all at once.    <br>I wish I had that.</br>    <br>Cute.</br>  <br>Washi was very much implied to be a former haibane who never left the nest and is probably what Reki would have become (live quietly at the temple). They kept showing close ups his wooden wings and symbols on his clothing when he described those not taking the day of flight.</br>  <br>Do the other Toga have the wings? I just realized it could have been just him who was a former haibane.</br>  <br>Rakka most likely fell down a well, there was well symbolism for her all over the place and when she was at the bottom of the well while she was knocked out you could hear sounds of somene opening a door and running out in the rain. She was probably upset about something, ran away, and accidentally fell in the well. I think Reki was the only one who could realistically be called a suicide, and even then she just sort of gave up rather than outright killed herself.</br>  <br>Well there were the toga (those who visited the town with goods to sell) and the people who lived in the temple- were both Toga? I don't remember. I dont think either of them had wings but maybe that was just Washi's outfit.</br>  <br>While I do agree, bear in mind the other temple guardians also wore the same trappings. And its really not that difficult to just get an ordinary human, give him fake wings and symbols. The only reason why the closeup was done on the wasshi, and not the other 'failed' haibane is ebcause only the Wasshi was allowed to speak.<br><br>I guess I just find it hard to buy the idea that the Wasshi is a failed haibane because, if he was - he sure knwos way too much for a failed haibane. And he's the one who understand the dreams best, so far.<br><br><br> &gt;She was probably upset about something <br>I think, IRL, Rakka had lost someone very dear to her. Perhaps a relative. Kuu's departure rekindled those memories.<br><br><br>No they're not both Toga.<br><br>The Toga do not have wings, the people who worked at the temple, including the Speaker/Wasshi, had the fake wings (pic related).<br><br>Its why I don't buy the idea of the Toga as being Haibane - rather, its the temple workers who, because they failed the day of flight, are doomed to stay within Glie forever. Its also why I think Wasshi is a normal human or,a s I call them 'angels': he merely wears the garb so as to prevent the haibane from knowing the truth about him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What if the hatband had penguin wings</br>  Yo, I don't remember seeing much tl's the time I saw this. Which subs are good to understand more?  <br>Coalgirls.<br><br>Go google it.</br></br></br>  <br>Just grabbed [HAIBANE-FANS]. It's a BD release but then again the BD still looks as atrocious as ever</br>  what were the walls exactly?    I desire to stick my penis into Carol's hair.  Cotton Candy continues her quest for friendship.  <br> hey hey, Tomo-chan. <br> (SFX) Fluff <br> Ah? <br> It's you... What is it now? <br> You see... <br> Fwends! <br> Friends! <br> hmm... Well. <br> It's a bit difficult to tell you... <br> (SFX) Jolts <br> !? <br> T-This woman is telling me that what she wants to tell me *now* is difficult? <br> (SFX) Badump badump <br> Just what kind of horrible thing does she want to tell me!? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Damn, Carol is still one of the fluffiest characters in all of existence.  Why does it feel like Cotton Candy getting so many pages? I don't remember any of the other side characters getting nearly as many pages, but perhaps I just feel like that because the shift to daily releases happened right around when she was introduced..  <br>She's a plot device.</br>  <br>Because she's the fourth main character after devil woman, autism-kun and Tomo herself</br>  <br> Introduced as clueless jealous ditz <br> Turns out she's actually a bro who knows her shit and just wants some friends to hang out with. <br><br>Why is Cotton Candy so perfect?</br></br></br></br>  <br> autism-kun <br>What</br></br>  <br>More like denial-kun</br>  <br>She can't beat kyoani's two queens of fluffiness. Unless this koma mag is picked up by Kyoani. Which it won't be because they don't do that anymore.</br>     you will never ignore the romantic gestures of your tomboy buddy until it's too late  <br> you will never get flaked on so she can see her prettyboy boyfriend  <br> you will never become an awkward third wheel  <br> you will never invite her to hang out and she spends her time gushing about him  <br> you will never fap vigorously and cry while he deflowers her in the next room </br></br></br></br>  <br>What was the point of this post?</br>  <br><br>What do you mean by fluffy anon kun?<br> I ask because in my country fluffy means highly sexually appealing </br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>So is she going to misunderstand and think that Blondie is coming on to her?</br>    <br>The blonde girl has a surprisingly dark past</br>  <br>So what is the update schedule for this? Are there any more untranslated pages?</br>  Why did she reject strength training?<br><br>Does she want to be as weak as a kitten, forever?</br></br>  <br>she doesn't care. she just started to beat gorilla-chan but then she saw that dense-kun and gorilla-chan like each other</br>  <br>She knew she didn't need to fight Tomo and didn't want to start one.</br>  <br>This post makes me angry</br>  <br>That blond girl surprisingly is the smartest one in this story.</br>  <br>Why are you looking at it?<br>Too see bait is to give it power.</br></br>  <br>I don't know the smug one seems pretty on the ball.</br>  <br>Anon what country are you from?<br><br> Also the fluffy one is sexually appealing. </br></br></br>  <br>I'm Jamaican (though I'm not currently living there)<br> pic related is from a Jamaican anime convention </br></br>  <br>Learn something new every day.<br><br> I have to give that guy points that mask is amazing. </br></br></br>  This is kind of sad. Poor Carol.  <br>filthy gaijin</br>  <br>Are those the same girls both times?</br>    <br> otomorachi <br>Loli Carol is a miracle of the universe.</br></br>  I want to hug the fluffy.  <br> make a generic foreigner character <br> turns out to be more and more complex <br>Fantastic.</br></br></br>    I have yet to hate a single character in this manga. The worst is that karate senpai guy, and only because he hasn't been fleshed out. It's more like a feeling of apathy towards him.  <br> "Hey Mizuru-chan, are we friends now?" <br> has no friends as stated a couple of chapters ago <br><br>It was there, just never shown how deep it would affect her</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you were a character in this manga I would hate you.</br>  <br> eating cake with Mizu must've been the greatest thing ever to her <br><br>Carol a cute.</br></br></br>    <br>I bet she preferred eating wedding cake with her husband</br>  <br>Even if you weren't in this manga I'd love you anon.</br>  <br>I dislike the one perverted guy friend. Never liked those characters, and worse yet is that he's going to end up with best girl.</br>  <br>I already hate that faggot classmate who is a masochist.</br>  <br>Who doesn't? Reading about a Misuzufag is far less funny than being one.</br>  <br>So she's been living in Japan since, like, ever?</br>  <br>No. The reason the lolis ran away is because she was speaking some scary squinty eye language they didn't understand</br>  <br> Implying misuzu doesn't like Jun. </br>  <br>Yes, girlyboy-senpai from karate club said they were childhood friends. She never had any girl friends because they were all jealous about girlyboy-senpai.</br>  <br>Or I guess more about other boys flocking to her.</br>  <br>She was a rich girl too.<br><br>Peasants have a hard time associating with the upper class.</br></br></br>  <br> he's going to end up with best girl <br>Nah.</br></br>  I just watched the first season of chu2 for the first time, and I liked it a lot. How disappointed am I gonna be with the second season?<br><br>Is it just not very exciting?<br><br>Or does it completely ruin the characters?<br><br>Should I bail out now?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  its okay <br>just watch it you just wont enjoy it as much as the first one probably</br>  It's very bad but best girl only appears in S2 so you have to endure it.  <br>I think that was the 1st show that I have ever dropped. It was just too boring for me, but I'm just a fag, so watch it for yourself and decide.</br>  <br>It's like chu2 fanfiction. Don't think of it as canon and it makes it a bit less unbearable</br>  <br> It's very bad <br> best girl only appears in S2 <br>Holy shit, how the fuck do you have such shit taste?</br></br></br>  <br>Like  said, it's not as good, but Shichimiya made it worthwhile.<br><br> Kumin a best though </br></br></br>  <br><br> NYA HAHAHAH </br></br>  <br> Spoiler </br>  Heart attacks. They introduce a new character  but her whole plotline is basically unnecessary.   Fuck.<br><br>I just finished the first ep.<br><br><br>This is impressively accurate. <br><br>I realize everybody else experienced this the other way around, but for me this feels like disappearance of yuki nagato all over again. Everything is weird and dumb. The plot is stupid, the humor is all lame puns and totally absurdist visual gags (how does she keep producing all those idol magazines from behind her back?!). How is this the same writer and director? Even the OP is weird and fanservicey compared to the original.<br><br>Why is it that kyoani can only put together one good cour of a show? Hyouka's second cour was weak as shit. Tamako Love Story was pretty lame. You get the idea. Second season of k-on was better than the first but it definitely dragged in the middle.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  THEY HAD THE CHANCE TO MAKE DARK FLAME MASTER AND MORI SUMMER FIGHT EACH OTHER<br><br>THEY DIDN'T <br>FUCK THIS SHIT<br><br>ALSO DRAMA UP THE WAZOO<br>IT'S SHIT<br>SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII<wbr>IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only way to fix this is to go full circle and start watching the dub of the second season. It will be so bad you'll enjoy it.</br>  Finished the second ep. <br><br>It was full of pointless references. Are these supposed to be the gags? Then MC's friends stalk them all day and get concerned they're not relationship-y enough. How much more nineties cliche can you get? It felt totally unnatural. I like the theme of them figuring out what their relationship should be for themselves, but it felt ham-fisted here. Also so far it's oddly episodic.<br><br><br>I'm curious about the dub, hah. I haven't listened to it at all yet, not sure if I'm emotionally ready for that. How bad is it? It seems like a lot of this shit would be really hard to dub.</br></br></br></br></br>   pointless cross-dressing <br> pointless extended action sequence <br> obvious misdirect about a love-triangle to add some tension <br><br>In the first season all the action sequences felt like they had purpose, and they were used to juxtapose their fantasies with how ridiculous they were. This was great because it setup the end where main girl just wouldn't react to whatserface's attacks. It was all in service of the plot and characters. Here they're just action sequences. <br><br>All that being said, there were some things I really liked about episode three. The foreshadowing about this "dark flame dragon" or whatever was nice, it implies that rikka is stating something about MC that he doesn't understand yet. And the moment at the end where rikka is all jealous but MC calms her down. Basically the only thing this show has going for it is that rikka still feels like rikka, and I'm still emotionally invested in her character. I wonder if that was the intent, to just quickly and easily cash in on the emotional connection people like me have built up. Even the animation and direction are lackluster compared to S1.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish people wouldn't post this gif. Even Kyoani has apologized for these sequences from the first OP and they changed it when they reaired the first season before the second started and on the second version of the BDs.</br>  <br> Even Kyoani has apologized for these sequences <br>why</br></br>  I present to you, Shrimp-chan.
