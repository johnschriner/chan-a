[ Starting off on a sad note, the author of MC Yumi finally succumbed to her cancer and passed away. Fortunately, she provided the entire plot to her illustrator who will take up her work, so we'll still get more MC Yumi, but depending on how extensive her notes were the English translation and correct military terminology could suffer.    Since it's vaguely /ak/ related, did you guys know that the Upotte mangaka drew a long original erodoujinshi series full of mindfucks, rape, NTR, and death? <br><br>Shit's great, yo.</br></br>  <br> author of MC Yumi finally succumbed to her cancer and passed away <br><br>What a fucking week, man.</br></br></br>  damn that sucks, fucking cancer.<br><br>On a more positive note, the Maris Stella mangaka will start a new series called Etten no Sora in the next issue of quarterly GoGo Bunch (same mag as Trench Flowers)<br><br><br>Blue Snow Blue?

I could either dump chapter 4 tomorrow, or I could dump it together with chapter 5 on Friday or Saturday like I originally intended.<br>I might also try to typeset the new chapter once I'm done with 4 and 5, assuming there is a translation by then. And I'll even break my no leveling rule since that scan quality looks like ass.<br><br>New suit.</br></br></br>   On My Own <br> World Goes Round <br><br>This soundtrack is pure bliss</br></br></br>  So haven't seen any Arslan thread...<br><br>Am I the only one who's loving the anime? <br><br>It really shows why a well written story that was written decades ago can still stand on its own.<br><br>Even if tons of games and anime have emulated and copied the tropes from Arslan . <br>that still cant compare to its story and its characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Nobody?<br><br> ;_;</br></br>   Badass art <br> Whoa that shit must be great <br> Google "Arslan anime" <br> See this <br><br>Nigga what the fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, you're just over exaggerating or a newfag. Even Kingdom does it better, let alone Ravages, Altair, etc.</br>  <br>It's a ton of wasted potential due to low production values.<br><br>The original concept carries the series, honestly. If it weren't for the story, the anime would be garbage.</br></br></br>  <br> implying there haven't been plenty of threads about best waifu Elam, lewd boys and QUALITY <br><br>Just fucking lurk moar.</br></br></br>  <br>The art for the old OVAs &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shit tripe art from the manga that's used for this new series.</br>  <br>It's more detailed, but just as gay and ridiculous looking. Actually it's even more ridiculous looking, but at least Arslan doesn't look like a lil bitch, just a flaming faggot.<br><br>But you guys still don't get it do you? The anime for the original already exists, and no one on this board gave a flying fuck about it for the entire history of 4chan until the remake started rearing it's head, so don't act like this is LOGH where people actually keep giving it attention.</br></br></br>    <br> Even Kingdom  <br>But Kingdom is great, dunno why you put "even"</br></br>  The show is fine, I enjoy it well enough every week but it's impossible to shake the feeling that it could be quite a bit better with a bigger budget and some tighter plotting and dialogue.  <br>The fuck are you buttmad about?<br>Yes, the old OVA exists. But it's an early 90s OVA that only covers what part of the story that existed in '91-'95.<br>It used the designs from Yoshitaka Amano, the same guy who did the illustrations for the Arslan novels and Vampire Hunter D's novels. <br>His designs were the base for the 90's OVA and his style of fabulous is well-retained.<br>Still, /a/ rarely ever talks about old anime. LOGH stands out because it's a massive production featuring a massive cast of massively talented VAs. <br>/a/ only talks about it now because it's not a new anime using the designs of Hiromu Arakawa's manga and even then, it doesn't get that much discussion anymore because it's a pretty shitty show overall and it's run for more than one cour.<br>The hype is dead and outside of the airdates, there's not much to talk about.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's great, but it's also very simple and puts a shonen spin on all the characters, like white washing Qin Shi Huang, making Li Xin a commoner underdog, making Wang Jian look like he's trying to usurp the kingdom, etc etc. It's like the new Warcraft movie.</br>  <br> It's like the new Warcraft movie. <br>Don't fucking talk to me about that shit here. Metzen needs to get knocked upside his head and kicked in the dick for his stupid orc boner.</br></br>  <br> because it's a pretty shitty show overall <br><br>I don't get where you interpreted as me being mad, but your post clearly shows how you're assblasted.<br><br>Yet at the same time you acknowledge it's shit, so I don't even know what you are trying to get across here sperging out your Googlefu.<br><br>People also regularly mention series like Slayers or even shit like Lodoss, but Arslan is completely off the radar meaning as a story it's even less popular on /a/ than Lodoss. That tells you plenty about the 'story telling' and 'characters' which the OP tries to sell off as great.<br><br>It's just shitty nostalgia. Arslan as a novel is just as bad because it's written by the same hack who needed walls in outer fucking space combined with dungeons and dragons magic just to tell a story. Even LNs today like Overlord have more consistency and thought put into their writing, and that's just self-insert / wish fulfillment with flavor. <br><br>TL;DR today's ice cream has better quality than the old day's full course meal.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> just as gay and ridiculous looking <br> Amano <br>You are a moron.</br></br></br>  <br>I went overboard, but you should understand my point about Kingdom being rather simple no? The black/white/grey are all very clearly defined, yes even the grey. <br><br>Compare it to say Ravages of Time and the difference is like heaven and earth.</br></br></br>  <br> The anime for the original already exists, and no one on this board gave af lying fuck about it for the entire history of 4chan <br>Nice hyperbole faggot, Arslan's 90s OVA series and movie got talked about fairly often in LotGH threads years ago before we even knew about the reboot anime being made off of Arakawa's adaption of the novels and original manga.<br><br>Also you talk like an aspie with some kind of stick up your ass if you get this flustered over the references to the original series. It was being done over the OVAs when people watched them to prepare for the Arakawa adaption anime and plenty of people including yours truly didn't like some of the changes she made design wise.<br><br>Stay mad, faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh look, a closet faggot who can't argue and just green texts a name like it means anything to people without rose tinted glasses. Care to share with us your wardrobe so we can point out how gay you look?</br>  <br>I don't read kingdom and I don't read Arslan, I wasn't even the guy you were talking to. I just saw you say something about the warcraft movie and it set me off.<br><br>Keep in mind that WoW itself is in the middle of the biggest jewing Blizzard has ever done as a game company. And the biggest lore fucking ever is happening to the main story as well.</br></br></br>  <br>He looks cool older. how long is he gonna be 14?</br>  <br>Your proving everyone's point about your frustration, samefag kun.</br>  <br>Slayers and Lodoss are complete series that got complete releases here in the US.<br>Arslan's OVAs are an incomplete story given an even more incomplete release by a nobody studio who didn't advertise it for shit. People just never heard of it due to lack of exposure unless they were actively searching for fantasy anime.<br>Of course, /a/ knew of it and occasionally discussed it when discussing older or fantasy series. Because they liked it. <br>Just because you didn't see it doesn't mean discussion didn't exist. And even with subdued discussion that doesn't mean it's bad. You literally have no clue what you're talking about.<br>By your measure, Wan Piss is the best thing to ever grace paper with ink because so many people talk about it endlessly.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We've had Arslan threads years before the new anime series came out. We even had them in a bunch of LotGH threads as a side-reel discussions  pointed out.<br><br>I have no idea how you honestly came to the conclusion the Arslan OVA series is something "no one cares about" or the source material itself when its a fucking mid 90s adaption that while good, had little exposure. It was never finished.<br><br>And you bring up Slayers? A major influence on fantasy anime and was a massive commerical success with multiple seasons that got brought over to the West with it? So I guess Dune sucks because Star Wars completely overshadows it right?<br><br>Your arguments are nonsensical.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> posts a picture of an effeminate man who looks like a bigger pussy than  in both armor, face, and body <br> raging hard but accusing others of it <br><br>Closet faggot detected. Go jerk it to Amano some more.</br></br></br></br>  <br> effeminate man </br>  <br>You're the only pile of asspain around here, champ.</br>  <br>Are you merely pretending to be retarded?</br>  <br> raging hard but accusing others of it <br>What others? You're the only one shitposting here while being an illogical jackass trying to stir up everyone else. <br><br>The other is you and only you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, by my logic Wan Piss has the most appeal to the majority, which it does. Just because I said your shit is gay doesn't mean you have to take it negatively, it's pretty much a fact that old 80s/90s shit like Saint Seiya is way more faggoty than 'hot blooded' stuff nowadays.<br><br>You're the ones with Daryun's spear up your ass getting offended over it.<br><br><br>The fact that Slayers was brought over while Arslan wasn't is quite telling in itself, as is the fact that Arslan was never finished. What you gonna tell me the author died like Guin Saga? Wait no Tytania just finished awhile ago.<br><br>Dune and SW both suck, as does Slayers. They were all just good for their time. I deliberately used Slayers because it wasn't anything special.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Slayers <br> sucks <br>Go eat a dick.</br></br></br>  <br> greentexting makes it not true <br><br>Once again you nostalgia fags just can't accept reality. Just imagine your asspain if someone were to criticize LOGH.</br></br></br>  <br>The Arslan novel series is on going and far longer then LotGH novels. The OVA series was never completed, so why would the production studio or animation studio try to localize an complete anime or OVA serise to the west?<br><br>They have NEVER done that now, and they haven't done it before either.<br><br>You just keep talking out of your ass.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> a *incomplete anime or OVA series </br>  <br><br><br><br>Keep circle jerking it in the closet, that'll show your parents!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hot damn, kid, you're going all out with that edge!<br>Keep talking out of your ass. It's getting funny watching you squirm so hard to offend people.</br></br>  <br>Probably because the anime is shit tier</br>  <br><br>Nice samefagging</br></br>   want to watch Arslan <br> Funi rips from episode 4 onwards <br><br>What did I do in my past life to deserve this?</br></br></br>  <br> /a/ has daily LN threads to series even without an anime adaptation yet <br> Arslan novel series doesn't even have annual threads <br> People care about Arslan <br><br>Your actions don't match your words.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Dune and SW both suck <br> so does Slayers <br>The only thing that sucks here is your inability to actually make a proper rebuttal, and your lack of comprehension on anything brought up to explain why what you're saying and claiming so wrong.<br><br><br>Arslan novels aren't LNs, for one monkey.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Arslan novel series even have annual threads <br> appeal to popularity fallacy and misusing it at the same time </br></br>  <br>I know right? It's so funny seeing people say absolutely nothing but keep being so aggressive and acting like they are right.<br><br><br>I never claimed to be someone else. You were the one who misinterpreted. Do you think most people would give enough a shit about this subject to even come in just to say it sucks dick?<br><br>Sorry buddy, but this thread was gonna die until you faggots took offense over a simple observation.

Lizard</br></br>  Your Suu has become dehydrated.<br><br>What liquid do you refresh her with?<br><br> And what effect does it have on her biology/personality? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, they're more reptilian.</br>  <br><br>Shouldn't she be drowning? Or was that retconned out?</br></br>  <br>Well she has nostrils and a mouth.</br>  <br>So cute.</br>  <br>HEY GUYS LOOK I DID IT AGAIN AM I OLDFAG YET<br><br><br>Well there's the explanation. I think Germanic kobolds lay eggs so that's prolly why.<br><br><br>WHY, SEMEN OF COURSE.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Centaur accepts rape <br><br>As expected of a slut.</br></br>  <br>Nah, she doesn't stay in the water for long. She tries to put up with it to be with darling, but then she cashes out.</br>  <br>Her entire book lung is submerged though.</br>  <br>I honestly believe that Cerea's horse part looks great.</br>  <br>Miia would be the depressive kind.<br><br>Papi would become the Flash.</br></br></br>  <br>You stupid furfag, do you really think that everybody is accepting of your disgusting shit?</br>  <br>Cola.<br> She becomes SUUUUUUUUper </br></br>  <br>Every time</br>  <br>I honestly believe  that it should've been a lighter shade. You know, like most horses? She should've had white fur. </br>  <br>Judging by what had been seen in thread so far, yes.<br>Why would you not accept the glorious Polt ass?</br></br>  <br> White fur Cerea <br>There's a thought</br></br>  <br>Horses are big majestic creatures, mostly stupid and easily frightened, but big and powerful creatures.</br>    <br><br>When you are up to your neck in water, your entire set of lungs is submerged too.</br></br>  <br>Because I'm not a furfag?</br>  <br><br> wet horse <br><br>Probably smells terrible</br></br></br></br>  <br> Trash can rattles <br> Cerea freaks the fuck out <br> "SHOW THOU SELF!" </br></br></br>  <br>EMBRACE THE ASS</br>  <br>Please contain your hatred for when someone posts an actually disgusting furry.</br>  <br>I see Miia as the drunk singer and Manako as the mean drunk. Cera could be the sick type I guess</br>  Polt butt is best butt<br><br>You cannot deny</br></br>  <br>Nose is fine, her other facial features are also human so she is definitely not a furry.<br><br>A snout and an animalistic facial structure is what makes a furry.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. Especially seeing as she bathes at least once a day. The only time horses stink is after long rides and that's mostly due to the saddle blanket being on them for hours trapping the sweat and heat on their skin.</br>  <br>Horses actually do have some form of beauty in there figure they look sweet and kind but are really powerful when they need to be just like Cerea.</br>  All this talk of horse pussy girl makes me wish I had screenshotted that post on /adv/ where a guy talked about fucking one of the horses on his parent's ranch when he was 12.  <br>I'm not trying to argue or anything. I was just curious if they retconned it after the group bath scene in one of the volume openings.  is a good enough answer for me.</br>  <br>Move away faggot</br>    <br>Why should I? Papi's got a good butt, Suu has a bigger butt, Lala's got a nice ass, HORSE PUSSY too... really, the list goes on and on.<br><br><br>But Polt IS a disgusting furry. The animal nose is what does it. Shouldn't you be wandering around with your trip off trying to rally hatred for the lack of Papiservice?<br><br><br>The nose is the killer. Pigsnout, beak, whatever, it's too much. You people really are stupid if you think that doesn't make her a furry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As much as i like Cerea the most you should just go to /mlp/ to know all about horses.</br>  Booty call!  <br><br> You will never get to spend time in a warm hot-spring with Miia, watching her enjoy having her body-temperature raised and having to stay vigilant and watchful for what she might do with her tail to you under the surface of the water <br><br> Then again, Darling won't get to experience this either. At least not without Cenrorea the walking cock-block raining on that parade, or Papi mucking it up somehow. </br></br></br></br>  <br> Lala's got a nice ass, HORSE PUSSY <br> Polt IS a disgusting furry </br></br>   Cerea has a baby <br> YOUNG SPAWN FROM MINE LOINS, THOU HAS BEEN BLESSED WITH YONDER CRIB! BEHOLD! THE MOBILE! </br>  <br>I wanna wash Cerea</br>  <br> Polt is not acceptable, but full-on animal vagina is. <br>Nothing to see here folks. Move along.</br></br>  <br><br>why is her womb there? She's got the body of a horse the womb wouldn't be there.<br><br>2/10</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Horses are so sexy <br/></br></br>  <br>Cry more, you wish your gf had an ass like Polt.<br><br>I bet Polt has to be careful during anal lest she clench to hard and cruss her bf's dick</br></br></br>  Darling name tier<br><br>Darling &gt; Honey &gt; Husband/Hubby &gt; Master (horse pussy) &gt; Dear Sir &gt; Master (jello pussy)</br></br>  <br>Yeah? I emphasize with the human face Cerea obviously has.<br><br><br>See? This is why I can't stand you furfags.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Behold, the only instance Cera is considered flat</br>  <br>Bigger != better.<br>That's a horse you're posting for all intent and purpose.<br><br>Not bad, but I can deny it, as Papi still has the best butt.<br><br> for the lack of Papiservice? <br>Truth to be told, I've seen much worse adaptations in that regard. Just think ViVid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pffff</br>    <br> Doesn't like Polt's ass <br> Likes HORSE PUSSY <br>Damn, it's times like these where I wish I had some popcorn</br></br></br>  <br><br>Hi there! You seem to have made a bit of a mistake in your post. Luckily, the users of 4chan are always willing to help you clear this problem right up.<br>You appear to have used a tripcode when posting, when your identity has nothing at all to do with the conversation. Oops! You should always remember to stop using your tripcode when the thread it was used for is gone, unless another one is started. Posting with a tripcode when it isn't necessary is poor form.

Just think ViVid. <br>Yeah, but you were doing that earlier. Just go back to doing that instead of trying to spread your furry-loving shittaste. You've reached a new low for me, LRD, and that's sad.<br><br><br>Yeah, I like a centaur and not a furry. Is there a problem with that?<br><br><br>See above.

Hello alone &gt; Everyday world. Not by a large stretch, but it was.</br>  Have you accepted the Haruno end yet, delusional /a/nons?  <br>Hello Alone is pretty depressing and sad though.</br>  <br>them trips confirm</br>  <br>I wholeheartedly agree. Not a yukinofag, but wow the ballad ver. was amazingly beautiful.<br><br>The original ED was just kind of there. Pretty sure everyone skipped over it. I only like the sort of faint trumpet or violin or whatever thingy you can barely hear.</br></br></br>  <br>You're a fool if you think three consecutive numbers mean anything.<br>Am I literally the only one who wants Haruno to get with Hayama?</br></br>  <br>I wonder what it feels like for Yui. I bet at the beginning and middle she was certain that no one on earth could possibly like him but her. Now I wonder how she feels that Hikki is swimming in bitches.</br>  I only just noticed the small differences in the opening of season 2. The cat Yukino was looking at starts shaking his tail, the still pictures that appear during it changed, 8man starts to actually appear holding a book on closeup (probably only a fix, no deeper meaning), the cup they got for 8man starts appearings in the tray and iroha appears among the three in the room. Each of them are gradual, the two last don't appear until episode 11 or 12.<br><br><br>But it matches the melancholy of their relationship perfectly.<br><br><br>Even though it was obvious they were saving money with the stills, I still liked to watch just to see the montages with the three of them drawn in real photos, but yeah, the slow ballad was completely heartfelt. And I'm a senseifag, not even a yukinofag, too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Accepted it? I embrace it.<br><br>Haruno is a goddess.</br></br></br></br>  Reminder if you like Iroha then you're a cuck  <br>Nope, but just because it would solve a lot of problems and they kind of deserve each other. She's kind of a (caring) bitch. He's kind of a (caring) dick. They can put up with eachother. Works like a charm.</br>  <br>Yui is kinda dumb so she probably thought a lot of girls liked Hikigaya since she's the bright-eyed idealist hypocrite.<br>Yukino is the one who'd be weirded out, she's seen human beings at their worst after all. As there aren't that many who'd give fish eyes the time of day.</br></br>  <br>If you love someone, you can only see their good points. She's probably just going 'Oh shit, they caught on that he was actually a jackpot of a man. I should've seen this coming!' or something of the sort.</br>  <br>Imagine the sex tho. The hate-fucking would be glorious and the conversations intriguing. What we don't see of those two when they meet some non-main characters must be so awesome. Both talking about their outlooks with Hayama trying to be kind, while Haruno being completely judgmental and whispering to him all the little irregularities and insecurities that person is hiding away.<br><br> Hayama should get a POV chapter. </br></br></br>  <br>It must mess with Yukino that as soon as she realized her feelings she finds out Yui also loves him. <br><br> . As there aren't that many who'd give fish eyes the time of day. <br>She must have known someone else would have her fetish.</br></br></br></br>    <br> steal <br> implying he belongs to anyone besides Komachi right now <br><br>But she's well aware of double YY and she's being smart about it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's nothing but a gigantic shipping shit flinging mess.<br> It's not ending anytime soon.</br></br>  <br>I can't believe people repost this horrible GIMP job.<br>The string of saliva is well done though.</br></br>  Is oregairu a scanned yet?  <br>I approve of a side story.<br><br><br>Yukino knew Yui liked him since the start. Yui made sure to broadcast her love all the time. Yukino herself couldn't understand what Yui saw in 8man at the time. Her realizing she also likes him came much later than that, and if you ask me, she might have taken so long to admit it to herself exactly because she also likes Yui and felt guilty deep down. Unlike Yui, who seems like she wouldn't be against stealing 8man for herself even if it made Yukino suffer, Yukino probably places her own feelings in a lower priority than Yui.<br><br>I get some hardcore White Album 2 vibes from how things are going, with Yui being Setsuna.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's the other way around boii. Yukino has hair of black and she's the most popular of the two. So odds are, you're cuck senses are tingling the wrong way.

It is quite big."<br><br>"Nowhere to go, unable to find a resting place.. hidden in the currents, being swept along and chasing after something, only to hit an invisible wall."<br><br>Yukinoshita reached her hand towards the glass wall but retracted it right before they touched. <br>As I glanced carefully to the side, Yukinoshita was staring blankly in front of her.<br><br>"Which fish are you talking about?"<br><br>Yukinoshita did not speak immediately but calmly exhaled before replying. "I was talking about myself."<br><br>After her answer, Yukinoshita wored an indiscernible lonely smile and touched the aquarium wall. <br><br>Yukinoshita's outstretched profile was seemingly being absorbed into the waters but obstructed by the glass walls from returning to her original place.<br><br>It was an ethereal sight, so transient as to disappear in the blink of an eye.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm okay with this</br>  <br>Oh, she was actually looking at her reflection.</br>  <br>Wait what the fuck I thought she was a cat<br>Watari's really fucking up he animal symbolism isn't he</br></br>  <br>The way he's been describing her ever since Destiny it feels like all those moments she has with him are always extremely beautiful but they never last.</br>  <br>All of them were being compared to fish in the last episode.</br>  <br>the last line was a mess in meaning but I kept the nuances best as I could.</br>  <br>Was Yui compared to a fish? All I got was the penguin symbolism for her.</br>  <br>Just changing things up.<br><br>Bears and penguins and fishes. Makes up a tidy food chain eh?</br></br></br>  <br>Penguins are fish, bro</br>  <br>Yukino honestly has 3 animal motifs I think. Yui is mostly a dog and Iroha I think is mostly a fox. <br><br> Cat <br> Panda <br><br>Should be obvious why<br><br> Fish <br><br>This is is harder to discern but she does have a fish theme. The aquarium date really sealed it but in Vol 1 she says the goal of the club is to <br>"Teach someone how to fish". Of course, like the fish we got in this scene, the club is really a means for Yukino to change herself<br><br>She also calls Hachiman a fish often (mostly his eyes) . Cats of course are tied to fish. But bears are as well and Hachiman's animal theme as seen in his 2nd essay is a bear (he is also Pan-San too heh)<br><br>Though I may just be reading too much into this<br><br><br>I think you have a point but I think a less talked about change Hachiman needs to undergo is his thought that relationships (and things in general) just reset in life. His convo in Vol 10 pretty much confirms this thought train of his. Even in Vol 11 he assumes that he knows the way the story is going to end (with him being alone) but I feel Watari is going to make it such that beautiful things can last when it comes to Yukino and Yui</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Man why is Yukino so self-centered?<br>Does she ever stop talking about herself for once?<br><br>Reading her conversation with 8man is so tiring, somehow she always manages to turn the conversation back to herself and her family drama.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What did Yui think penguins were if not birds? Did she really think they were fish</br></br>  "I can't agree with that.

I couldn't run away because of her kindess nor could I answer her kindess with lies.<br><br>Because, Yuigahama is a kind person, Yukinoshita is a strong person.<br><br>"Furthermore, this is just sophistry."<br>"Vague answers, superficial relationships, I don't need any of these.<br>No matter what, to think it over, to agonize and struggle , I.."<br><br>The voice that leaked out those words was hardly audible. <br><br>I know this wasn't right. <br>Living a life thinking about a future that did not exist and about happy possibilities, perhaps nobody would be hurt this way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>But even so, I wanted to squeeze my thoughts out, because I wasn't strong enough to live in a dream. After doubting myself, I didn't wish to lie to the people important to me. <br><br>What I wanted, without any pretence, was the answer I sought. <br><br>"I knew you would say something like that."<br>Yuigahama had a gentle smile even as a tear flowed down the side of her face. I could hardly think about how I looked myself except hope that I didn't look atrocious right now. <br><br>Our eyes met and we exchanged nods.<br>The things we hoped for might never be the same, but it was not impossible for them to become the same. After speaking of everything, perhaps we could discover things that were interconnected did exist.<br><br>With this in mind I turned towards Yukinoshita. <br><br>As we waited for her answer, Yukinoshita took a deep breath before replying. "Don't just decide my feelings on this matter."<br><br>"Besides, this isn't the last. Hikigaya-kun, your request still remains."<br>Yuigahama's laugh came before I could ask further. "That's right." She agreed with Yukinoshita with a nod. The two exchanged slight smiles as if to share a secret between themselves. <br><br>Yukinoshita spoke again. "One more thing. Could you hear me out on my request?"<br>"Let's hear it."And Yuigahama reached her hand out.<br><br>The evening sun that was slowly setting casted shadows onto the blank sea.<br>It wasn't defined, being slightly crooked and bearing a rough profile.<br>However it was certainly connected to form something. <br>Perhaps if wishes had a shape.<br>That most certainly --<br><br><br>  Don't let it be said yuibros don't help out here </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It seems like Yukino and Hachiman have switched places sort of from the beginning of the series. At first, Yukino had this attitude about helping people improve themselves (and she wanted to improve herself most of all). Hachiman was dismissive of that and his solutions to problems always skirted the real problems and maintained a less-than-optimal status quo.<br><br>But now as of of vol 11 it seems like Yukino has abandoned the attempt to better herself. She's back in a mode that presumably she was in before the series began and has surrendered to Hachiman''s original way of thinking. Ironically Hachiman seems to have moved towards Yukino's original way of thinking as the series has progressed. He's not opposed to bettering yourself anymore.</br></br>  <br>Maybe she really was listening to his words when they were watching Haruno preform.</br>  <br>Honestly, if Watari can pull it off, 12 would be a perfect bookend to the series. <br><br> Volume 1 <br> Hachiman and Yukino meet each other and form ideals onto each other. 8man doesnt want to change but Yukino does<br><br> Volume 6  <br>It is the midpoint of the series in many ways. That image you posted is representative of that since it suggest that Yukino may not want to change at all but Hachiman starts to (also ties into Sensei's request to change Hikigaya)<br><br> Volume 12 <br>I think this will wrap up both Yukino's and Hachiman's requests somehow and ties up the series. We will also get to see the final forms of Yukino and hachiman as well <br><br>Also, woulldnt surprise me if Hachiman asks Yukinoshita to be his (girl)friend once more as he did in Volumes 1 and 6</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you're the best yuibro</br>  <br>That's a bit of a stretch. The way she acts around other people hasn't changed. The only noticeable change is that she no longer puts up the ice queen wall around 8man or Yui.<br><br>All she was really doing all this time is avoiding her problems or preventing them from occurring. Clearly that wasn't working so at this point with no other options left she has no choice but to adapt and face her problems directly. I suspect her request will likely be the start of this.</br></br></br>  <br>What would she want for her birthday?</br>  <br>We were so close</br>  <br>Don't forget, you are here forever</br>     you will never be called Kimoi by a girl who is deeply in love with you <br>This shouldn't be my life.</br>  <br><br>Never say never, Anon.</br></br>  <br> wanting to be insulted <br>What are you some kind of masochist?<br> There are better girls for that, anon. </br></br></br>  <br>You just said it, twice.</br>  <br> Ne Yukinon, don't you think Iroha-chan and that Orimoto girl are getting familiar with Hikki? We should do something about it. </br>  <br> kek <br> head </br></br>  <br>They're the least of your worries.</br>  Dammit.<br>Why does she always sell out first.<br>Life isn't fair.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off with your moon runes.</br>  <br>They made 2 of her, that's why</br>  <br>SELLOUT</br>  What if Hayama was a girl? Would 8man and Hayama have fucked already?  <br>No, she would have just been another nice girl to him.</br>  <br>Hayama would be the best tsundere</br>  <br>Iroha's first? But someone said she needed 8man to sell</br>  <br>At first yeah but as he knows more he would learn otherwise. Girl Hayama would definitely be in the harem. He is almost in there as a boy.</br>  <br>If Hayama was a girl he would have won already<br> I don't like you <br> I don't like you either <br>that's some romantic shit right there</br></br></br></br>  <br> I feel inferior to you <br><br>PLATONIC<br>L<br>A<br>T<br>O<br>N<br>I<br>C</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What did sensei imply by this?  <br>She knows what happened when she left those two alone in the club for hours.</br>  <br> What happened? </br>  <br>SOX</br>  <br>Be realistic anon, what could possibly happen between two hormonal teenagers when they are put in a room alone for hours at a time?</br>  <br>Something platonic, of course.</br>  <br>Nothing if they are as incompatible as yukishit and 8man</br>  <br>I wonder</br>  <br>So something involving cucumbers?</br>  <br>i never watched this serie, is the female character being a mary sue to obnoxious?</br>  <br>Where's obnoxious</br>  <br>She's a mary sue, until S2 where all her shortcomings explode into a beautiful cringefest</br>  <br>Not really, she only appears to be a Mary Sue superficially.</br>  <br>Read the LN</br>  Double YY a shit. They never apologized for the car accident, nor visited him (directly, that thing from Yui doesn't count) or even talked about it with 8man. They just tried to forget it all. Just like in true japanese spirit.  <br>but isn't she the best at academics sports and beauty in all the school?</br>  <br> I'm sorry that I was in the backseat of a car that you ran in front of. <br> I'm sorry both you and my dog are suicidal. <br>What?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why should Yukino apologize? She wasn't driving. She holds 0% of the blame, no reasonable person would expect her to apologize for happening to be in the back of a car that hit somebody.</br></br>  <br><br>She's called Yuckyno for a reason.</br></br>  <br> but isn't she the best at academics  <br>She is smart yes although her curriculum is different from the rest. <br> sports <br>Only for like 5 minutes until she can't go on.<br> beauty in all the school? <br>She's recognized as such but that's what made her somewhat unapproachable to people.<br><br><br>Yukino had no fault in it, the driver did apologize, even when she did want to apologize 8man didn't care.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For most of the first season she does appear to be more-or-less "perfect," but she's hardly a "mary sue." Since that's associated with a very specific character who basically warps the plot around them, solves everything and actually does have no flaws. At the very worst you could call first-season Yukino a generic ice queen-type character or whatever, and even that I think is a pretty uncharitable interpretation of her character</br>  <br>But TM is good, Yahari is shit. Learn the difference</br>  <br>what happen in season 2 that get her out of the perfect zone?</br>  <br>Watch the fucking anime dude<br>or read the LN</br></br>  <br>Was it a long day?</br>  <br>She doesn't have a personality of her own and imitates others. She has dependency issues and she relies on her sister and used to rely on ALPHA MCALPHA as well.</br>  <br>Why don't you just read it? The time you spent shitposting here could have been spent actually reading the LN</br>  <br> Our eyes met and we exchanged nods. <br> The things we hoped for might never be the same, but it was not impossible for them to become the same.

Needs translation ASAP.</br></br></br>  <br>Just don't call it an irohafag thread, or a weekly thread for that matter. Make it a thinly veiled thread with some kind of "news" as the OP.</br>  <br>A prime example would be Miuna Monday threads<br>I have no idea who she is but she still has threads on Mondays well after her show has ended.</br></br>  <br> some kind of "news" as the OP <br>do you really think there's not a single mod who follows these threads? yahari is extremely fucking popular it's hard for it to go "under the radar"</br></br>  <br>She's trying both because Hikki comes off a bit dense like when Yui tried to invite him to the festival him saying Komachi should go too, she knew Yui wanted to go with him alone and she was trying to make him go so he sent him to get stuff for her.<br><br>With Yukino I remember her trying to raise a flag somewhat like Haruno did trying to imply that Yukino was Hikki's boyfriend but was disappointed when Yukino that it didn't raise a flag for Yukino.</br></br></br>  <br> didn't watch NagiAsu <br>what the fuck are you doing with your life</br></br>  <br>Judging by the average thread quality I'd say not a single mod does.</br>  <br>I was bored out of my mind the whole first episode that I didn't even touch the second episode when it aired.</br>  <br> thinking mods judge quality <br>if they really thought it was 24/7 shitposting they would have killed us already<br>And if you think this general is that shitty you haven't been on /a/ long enough, it can get much fucking worse</br></br></br>  <br> She's trying both because Hikki comes off a bit dense <br>Which has fuckall to do with how she feels about either girl. Thank you for agreeing to my point.</br></br>  <br>Don't be dissing my goddess. Miuna Monday is only on Mondays, Yahari threads have been going nonstop every single day.</br>  <br> Which has fuckall to do with how she feels about either girl <br>Not that Anon but she was the one who made him act to get the club back to normal. She's pretty attached to both girls but wants one to get with her onii-chan.<br> I wonder if she knows both of them have feelings for him. </br></br></br>  <br>It's not being compared to the Yhari btb.<br>It's being used to see if Iroha Sly Saturdays are a viable option.</br></br>  <br>Watch it. It gets really good, you should have been in the threads with us they were great</br>  <br>You could probably pull it off. Miuna Mondays has had shit flinged multiple times and its still there. Just stay in one thread and you'll probably be fine.</br>  <br> thinking mods judge quality <br>They enforce the rules, and based on the rampant shitposting that goes on in these threads they don't bother doing it here.<br><br> And if you think this general is that shitty you haven't been on /a/ long enough, it can get much fucking worse <br> Dubsfaggotry, forced memes, NSFW, fanfiction, shitposting everywhere. <br><br>Oregairu threads are nothing but /v/-tier cancer. Maybe that's why you don't think they're bad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She was intentionally acting as a mouthpiece for 8man's desire to keep the club together. 8man outright fucking says so.</br>  いろはすのあざとい土曜日<br><br>;_;</br></br>  <br><br>I wonder why 8man's monologue were more favoring to Yui than Yukino during Genuine speech 1.0 and this scene despite he has beauty sonnet all time with Yukino.</br></br>  <br>We just have to wait<br>It will happen<br>We'll live to see it happen.<br> maybe </br></br></br></br>  <br> Dubsfaggotry <br>happened once, I'm not excusing it but it's not like it really happened again<br> forced memes <br>happens in literally every general, lurk more<br> NSFW <br>a single thread, that was killed halfway through, and if you don't think it happens elsewhere you need to lurk more<br> fanfiction <br>barely happens, not even against the rules nor do mods justify it as shitposting, nor do people post links to fanfictions extremely often<br> shitposting everywhere <br>you still haven't defined what this actually is<br><br>you need to lurk more or GTFO</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> happens in literally every general, lurk more <br> generals <br> /a/ <br><br>/v/ confirmed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 8man's monologue were more favoring to Yui than Yukino during Genuine speech 1.0 <br>[citation needed]</br></br>  <br> FEEL removed all the 8man's monologues <br><br>Sasuga Yukinofag director.</br></br></br>  <br>I wish they actually removed them all. 8man's internal monologue when Yukino and Yui were talking completely fucking ruined the flow of the scene.</br>  <br>What? Today is Ebin's birthday?</br>  <br>the fact that this is a general is a justified reason for the mods to kill it, not the vague newfaggotry that you shitted out before</br>  <br>So you're saying /a/ mods didn't moderate forced memes because they're normal in every general which /a/ doesn't have.<br><br>Sure thing /v/. Backpedal harder.</br></br></br>  <br>During genuine speech 1.0 there this line:<br> Yuigahama said and hugged Yukinoshita’s shoulders that she pulled closer and began to sob as if the string of tension was cut.

Just how could she, how could Yuigahama say those words like that? <br><br> Like someone who could only wield a theory drenched with a contradicting falsehood in a roundabout way? <br><br> Like someone who couldn’t put into words properly their thoughts and instead stayed silent? <br><br> Nothing could be conveyed without words, yet there was a mistake because there were words. So what exactly could we understand then? <br><br> Yukinoshita Yukino’s held beliefs. Yuigahama Yui’s sought relationship.

That this time right now wasn’t a mistake at all. <br><br>Yukino only start crying after these line,<br><br>And During genuine scene 2.0:<br><br> Yuigahama was a kind person, that I decided selfishly. <br><br> Yukinoshita was a strong person, that was the ideal I pushed onto her. <br><br> I told myself this as I relied on them all this time. <br> However, precisely because of this, I couldn't rely on them anymore.

I don't think any of it is holding Yui below Yukino either.</br></br>  <br>You don't actually know what generals are, do you<br>I know I shouldn't argue with newfags, but that fact that you still can only argue about the terminology I used instead of arguing all of  kinda means you don't really know what the fuck you're talking about<br>because you're a newfag</br></br></br>  <br>Genuine didn't favor anyone, it was all about Hikki's "selfish" desire.</br>  <br>No shit, he's blatantly lying. I simply said it was 'after' instead of 'during' the genuine scene</br>  <br><br>It's still during. 8man and Yui were finally able to pry open Yukino's hard shell. Stop being a turbofag.</br></br>  <br>Rather than lying i think genuine scene 1.0 part is from 8man start entering service club room to rooftop scene for closure.</br>  <br>By all means /v/, tell me all about the generals on /a/, as well as how they are exempt from forced meme moderation. I'm sure it would be more interesting than listening to you scream "newfag" more the harder you lose the argument.</br>  <br>I apologized for miswording it. I think during genuine scene 1.0 and 2.0 show how 8man and Yui "ideal" clashing each other. <br>Despite that they manage found same conclusion regarding it with Yukino just like being third party in that scene.</br></br>  <br>Not him but I don't see how it favour Yui. Both scene doesn't emphasize Yui from Yukino at all, if anything the first scene:<br><br> No matter how much I thought, that answer, those words were the only thing that came out. Just how could she, how could Yuigahama say those words like that? <br> Like someone who could only wield a theory drenched with a contradicting falsehood in a roundabout way? <br> Like someone who couldn't put into words properly their thoughts and instead stayed silent? <br><br>Describes Yui's actions as irrational, while this:<br><br> Yuigahama was a kind person, that I decided selfishly. <br> Yukinoshita was a strong person, that was the ideal I pushed onto her. <br> I told myself this as I relied on them all this time. <br> However, precisely because of this, I couldn't rely on them anymore. I couldn't run away because of her kindness nor could I answer her kindness with lies. <br><br>Describes how he put both of them on a pedestal, and this:<br><br> "I knew you would say something like that." <br> Yuigahama had a gentle smile even as a tear flowed down the side of her face. I could hardly think about how I looked myself except hope that I didn't look atrocious right now. <br> Our eyes met and we exchanged nods. <br> The things we hoped for might never be the same, but it was not impossible for them to become the same. After speaking of everything, perhaps we could discover things that were interconnected did exist. <br><br>Describes how their ideals clashes with each other. None of these favour Yui.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's because Yui is looking for something that neither 8man or Yukino are looking for and he realizes that, but just because they are different doesn't mean they can't end up becoming the same thing.</br>  <br>You still haven't made any arguments, buddy<br>I'm pretty sure once you're saying shit like <br> the harder you lose the argument <br>shows you're kinda running out of ideas<br><br>if you want the definition for a general thread, google it. Bring up something original and I'll gladly argue about it with you, newfriend</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> forced meme moderation <br>define this</br></br>  <br><br>Based on this  I think he's saying that both 'genuine' scenes are about Yui and Hachiman working together (not necessarily intentionally) to bring Yukino out of her shell to engage them. So it's like Hachiman/Yui on the one hand and Yukino is sort of the third party that's being engaged.<br><br>Or at least I think that's what he's saying.<br><br>That's one way of viewing it I suppose. But in a romantic sense neither scene is pushing Yui harder than Yukino. I typically view both 'genuine' scenes as Yui acting as a conductor to get Hachiman and Yukino to engage each other. Especially the first one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I think I found a plot hole. 8man vowed to not start a romcom with Yukino but<br>A) he has been in comedic situations with her <br>B) she fell in love with him</br></br>  <br> fell in love with him <br>platonically, I'm assuming?</br></br>  <br> B) she fell in love with him <br>Why did 8man prevent that?</br></br>  <br>Not really</br>  <br>The whole point was him trying to not fall for her, he kept comparing all his early interactions with Yukino to a romcom setting only for Yukino to crush that.<br>Like the when she started playing the game of guess the club, he thought it was going to be some romcom thing that gets lewd but instantly gets a vibe that it were game straight out of Kaiji.</br></br>  <br>Is there more of it?</br>  <br> based Haruno <br><br>At first I thought she was playing like Ami, but she's just a total cunt.</br></br></br>  <br>Is she wrong though?</br>  <br>If Yukino wanted to crush that setting then why did she fall in love with him?</br>  <br>Doesn't really confirm Yukino's feelings, all she's spilling is her dependency issue.</br>  ITT: straw grasping Yuifag and Yukinofag baiting  <br>What she said isn't wrong, but her sense of timing flat out suck and she seeks out to destroy anything with semblance of comfort.<br><br>It's hardly unexpected, given that bitch is envious of Yukino's position as unimportant child of the family.</br></br></br>  <br>Haruno was right all along.</br>  <br>Yukino's feelings for him grew, their relationship literally started from scratch.</br>  <br>Because he put her on pedestal.</br>    <br>I meant why DIDN'T he prevent her from doing so. It worked on Yui.</br>  <br>He didn't know Yukino loved him until the end of Vol11, even then I'm still skeptical think he doesn't know.</br>  <br>8man never really activated his antigirl walls around Yukino outside of the first time he met her</br>  <br>You've failed to address my point, why would I need to come up with another one? Until you can answer me you have no argument.<br><br><br>The first post of this thread being deleted, for starters.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Never put pussy on a pedestal</br>  <br>He never bothered to put his guard up because she was always insulting him, that was his first mistake.<br><br>Although he never really read into her actions much because of that, so he just took the mall date as platonic, although probably not his idea of a date.</br></br></br>  <br> he never really read into her actions much because of that <br>Shame, she went full dere in 10.5</br></br>  <br>I have addressed it, if you're not going to "argue" any other points then you don't really have any points, do you</br>  <br> It worked on Yui. <br>Yes because Yui never fell in love with him or if she did she fell out of it.</br></br>  <br>The reason why i think it favoring Yui in meta sense because both genuine scene supposed "vital scene" within story and yet both scene do almost same thing:<br>1. Give another build-up for 8man and Yui relationship(it's like despite two person are opposite in almost everything, they try to reaching out each other and seeking something connect both of them).<br>2. Both of them are bring out Yukino from her hard shell.<br>3. It "fix" and deepen their current relationship from their worry. <br><br>Because of this I think for Yui ended up rejected by 8man become a bit unlikely in term context story because it's like author trampling the build-up of their relationship after everything happen between 8man and Yui.<br><br>But that's just my biased thought.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yui is not going to get rejected despite being shit on for 11 volumes just because <br>At least you know that you're biased.</br></br>  <br>You must be fucking new around here if you think cuntkiller getting deleted is new, he probably uses a bot<br><br>I also love how you don't even address the other guy's argument but get stuck on one word<br> Until you can answer me you have no argument. <br>You don't really have an argument don't you anon</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>[citation needed]<br><br>No seriously, when did that happen? I'm genuinely curious.</br></br></br>  <br>He never did, the guy is talking out of his ass.<br>The only thing 8man ever did was prevent her confession.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah I dunno. There are reasons to think 8man likes all the girls. I mean you can also view the whole series as Yukino and Hachiman keep misunderstanding each other, then getting a better idea of one another and drawing closer as a result.<br><br>Really we don't know. Any of the girls could end up getting rejected. If we take Yukino, Yui, and Iroha all as possibilities then for sure two girls are going to get rejected at a minimum. I personally think Hachiman is ultimately going to end up with none of them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He prevented Yui from falling for him by acting like an asshole, preventing her from confessing, acting like a useless wimp, and not responding to her feelings.</br>  <br> my biased thought <br><br>Well, no shit. But at least #2 is right. If anything, it almost like Yukino is the only one standing on another side of the fence. Both 8man and Yui shared the same sentiment. It was hinted during genuine 1.0 that Yui hated things as it was.</br></br></br>  <br>Read the LN.<br><br>No seriously, read the LN. Even Haruno commented that 8man was more soft spoken when Yui was around. Heck even from vol 5 he already softening up around Yui.</br></br></br>  <br>They all hated things as they were at that time, Yui kept acting falsely cheerful and Yukino had her fake smile the entire time.<br>No one was actually happy being that way.</br></br>  <br>Anyone else get the feeling that if 8man and Yui got into a relationship he could slap Yui around, drink too much, and cheat on her and she still wouldn't leave him?</br>  <br>You haven't addressed anything.<br><br>You say moderators don't ignore these threads, yet cuntkiller is clearly still there the vast majority of the time.<br><br><br>Thank you for agreeing to my point. Cuntkiller has been banned before, therefore he'd be modded consistently if mods actually came here. Most threads he doesn't get deleted, therefore there is no mod presence most of the time.<br><br>Is the discussion settled or are you going to throw another shitposting fit to ease your ravaged anus?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The fact that you still haven't addressed my shit ton of points makes me not want to argue with you.<br> ease your ravaged anus <br>You're angry, aren't you anon</br></br></br>  <br>With her low self-esteem, she might allow that. But that's fucking awful to think about.</br>  <br>Then why does Yui still like him despite all this?</br>  <br> You haven't addressed anything. <br>He did actually, but you haven't funnily enough</br></br>  <br>He could but I don't think he is that kind of man</br>  <br>She doesn't. He behavior in volume 11 shows that she has fallen out of love with him to the point where she doesn't want Yukinon to get with him.</br>  <br>Because he actually responds to her feelings enough to lead her on, but not enough to the point where Yui would think she has any chance of winning.</br>  <br><br>That's what I thought. Better luck next time /v/.</br></br>  <br>I wonder what kind of face Yui'll make if she knows 8man was jelly for her.</br>    <br>Call him gross but have a flood in her pants. She would be so happy it makes me feel kind of sorry for her.<br><br><br>Yui thought she had a good shot until the infirmary scene. How long would have taken for her to figure out Yukino also loves him without that and the bowl scene?</br></br></br></br>  <br> I wonder what kind of face Yui'll make <br>Broadest grin humanly possible and she would still have it the next day. I bet it would go in the diary.</br></br>  <br>She actually wouldn't have since they put her suspicions of that to rest,  she probably saw her lean in unlike Hikki. </br>  <br>Well not even Yukino is aware of the nauseating feelings he has from time to time when he feels whenever anything resembling a Yuki's romance past is brought up</br>  <br>She'll go home and hug her Hikki bodypillow with the stupidest smile on her face for hours.</br>  <br>Deep down she probably still feared it would happen.

If you emphasize 普通 then it is more likely to be insulting, I think. If the dude you're talking to comments on some girl being ugly and you reply by saying she's 普通に可愛いじゃん then you're saying you think she's actually pretty cute</br>  <br>According to the first Yahoo Answer link I found through google it's like this 【ブス】＜【普通に可愛い・普通に綺麗】＜【可愛い・綺麗】＜【超可愛い・<wbr>超綺麗】. The guy who told you it means one step above ugly seems to be correct although according this this Yahoo Answer it seems to be more "one step above nothing/average".</wbr></br>  <br> according this this Yahoo Answer it seems to be more "one step above nothing/average". <br>This is how I would usually interpret it<br>【ブス】＜【地味】＜【普通に可愛い・普通に綺麗】＜【可愛い・綺麗】＜【<wbr>超可愛い・超綺麗】</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Slight correction. Rikai tell me that ブス means homely woman or plain-looking woman but google images shows only ugly woman.</br>  <br>root double, white album 2, dies irae and muramasa off the top of my head</br>  <br>Yeah, I saw that, but if you scroll down you'll see other people with the same question and slightly different answers. One person even said it's a compliment. But, well, it's the internet, so I'm sure there are retards and trolls mixed in.<br><br>At any rate, more people definitely seem to see it as negative.</br></br></br>  <br>But that probably has more to do with how its heard subjectively. I'm guessing that it's like saying "you look young for your age". Many woman will take it as a compliment and many others will through a fit. Calling someone "normally cute" might be a compliment to some and not one to another(the cuter ones I'd imagine).</br>  So what languages do you plan on learning after Japanese? I want to learn Chinese, but not because I have any interest it in outside of just learning the language itself. I wonder if that will be enough to push through.  <br>I uploaded two entire sentence packs from AJATT to MEGA. Lemme get them for you.<br>Sci-Fi Pack: https://mega.co.nz/#!v9BFBZSb!N6Tu3<wbr>fYYR6TvE50Yc0wufA26GAOnEgMOJrkmLC6z<wbr>yhE<br><br>My first sentence pack: https://mega.co.nz/#!vogGzIYa!l1c2m<wbr>T4alCAc-s_P3GIucm14x93Vdpvh-pJCzI41<wbr>tx4<br><br>Sentences are way better than pure words, since you learn them in context and you kind of absorb the grammar by osmosis. More fun to do it that way, too.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>busu is also just used as a general insult for females. It means ugly, but is often times used on cute girls as well if they are not as attractive as others. If you watch akb48 media they will call each other busu a lot, and there are busu kyara but they are actually attractive compared to the average person.</br>  <br>Russian or maybe Chinese like yourself. To have something to do when I don't feel like studying Japanese. I think I'll be occupied with Japanese for a while longer.</br>  <br>The problem is knowing when to stop. I don't want to start Chinese because I don't want to stop Japanese, even though I'm at a pretty good level. I've been studying for 3 years, but I am still learning of course. I'll stick with Japanese for now.</br>  <br>I'm learning spanish because it's easy enough that I can just add 10 sentence cards to anki a day and still feel like I'm making progress.</br>  腹上死  <br>  It means ugly, but is often times used on cute girls as well if they are not as attractive as others. If you watch akb48 media they will call each other busu a lot, and there are busu kyara but they are actually attractive compared to the average person. <br>That doesn't really say much about the word ブス, just about media. Just like how the girls who are uglier by setting in hollywood films are still usually really hot.</br></br>  <br> I read this and the second in the series and it was boring as shit. <br>The second one is so good though.<br><br> Read prince of nothing <br>I'll check it out.<br><br><br>I also read portuguese books though that is not fair because that is my native language. The other anon said it the best already. People interested in languages will eventually be interested in books. You'll probably reach the point where you'll stop reading manga/VN yourself and move on to novels.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm just telling you the usage of it. It is a general insult that means ugly, but it isn't all that insulting and it's thrown around quite a bit.</br>  <br> The second one is so good though. <br>Actually, I liked the first a lot more than the second. I just didn't like how it turned into too much of an "adventure" type book. Kind of like The Hobbit or Alice in Wonderland. I much prefer the style where the world is more known (while still being fantasy) and is developed more, rather than the main character encountering some crazy monster, getting out of the situation, and then the monster never coming up again.</br></br>  <br>And also it's only used for females.</br>  <br> but it isn't all that insulting and it's thrown around quite a bit. <br>I doubt actual Japanese people not already being paid a bunch for being cute would feel the same way.<br><br><br>There's ブサメン for males</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The second one is so good though. <br>Have you read the sequel? It's also good, but it takes a bit of a different approach and some might think they'd be better of not having read it.</br></br>  What is some good listening practice for beginners?

All of them have several uses, and they require quite a complicated explanation. If you make it too simple, it simply becomes misleading and will cause you headaches when you get past the beginner level.</br>  Should I go through the trouble of adding vocab from VNs to a separate decklist before finishing Kore6k? <br><br>Currently I am about 1/3 into 6k and KD decks, started reading about a week ago. As I mostly read on my Vita  Amagami. I know reading with no text-hooker is a royal pain in the ass, but being able to read Sae-chan's route is one of my main motivations to try and do my best. Besides, it's not too extreme, I expected it to be much harder, considering my current level of knowledge , interrupting every minute to add words on Anki seems conter-productive, as it takes away from my concentration, and I am pretty sure that even if I do add reading vocab now, I'll still encounter 90% of them in core6k anyway, then why bother?</br></br>  <br>Try to find the Nihon Shock Cheat Sheet.

I just paste them to a word document and add them to anki thru Epwing2anki afterwards. If it's too much of a pain w/o a text hooker I wouldn't even bother with it, but for your next reading material I would definitely choose something that's on PC or otherwise easy to get text from so you can start a deck. I'm planning to stop adding new cards on core once it's at 3k words and start focusing more on my mining deck, but try stuff out and do whatever works for you.</br>  <br>i just started CAPITAL LETTERS today. why can't they just use lower case for everything? it's so much easier ;_;</br>  <br>Why do we even have capital letters?</br>  <br>Romans and Greeks.</br>  <br>SO THAT WE CAN EXPRESS OUR RAGE THROUGH TEXT</br>  <br>The same reason Katakana exist.<br><br><br>Although I'm the first one to spit on memrise, the site can be useful to practice your Katakana skills, learn some words and overall get used to them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>why does katakana exist?</br>  <br>Be happy you don't speak german<br>English capitalisation is extremly easy<br> Not that german capitalisation isn't but you need to pay more attention </br></br></br>  <br>To trigger your autism.</br>  <br>Why don't the japs have capital hiragana and katakana?

Like those people who think they can learn japanese just by watching anime<br><br>It's quite simple really, if there is hardly any text in that VN then you can hardly use it to study.<br>and on top of that, just reading japanese is not studying, just like simply watching anime is not studying. If you want to use reading to learn then you need to have something with a lot of text and you have to actually _study_ it in some way, not just read it.</br></br></br></br></br>     You're learning Japanese so you can understand weird shit like this <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=e22<wbr>VnQF4NtQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Such an odd people the Japanese.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll just save this for later</br>  Anyone know a list similar to that of English SAT to increase advanced Japanese vocab?  <br>The best translators are often good writers, and the best writers are often good readers. Read more and write more and you'll find your translation skills will improve. <br><br>That said, the translation is fine, I guess. It's not something easy to translate because the idea of the "flow" isn't something we really talk about in English. It's really common in Fukumoto's stuff though for example.</br></br></br>  <br>What is おひえて here?</br>  <br>教えて. This is a dialect commonly spoken among sluts.</br>  <br>Reminder (from Ixrec's grammar guide on second person pronouns)<br> お前 (おまえ) you the default second-person pronoun (especially for males) <br> 君 (きみ) you more friendly than おまえ, implying that there is some sort of relationship <br> 貴方 (あなた) you a second-person pronoun used by females, sometimes used specifically to address her husband <br> あんた you a more colloquial version of あなた without the strong connotations <br> てめ you used primarily to express contempt of the subject. Also, attaching め to the end of any noun or pronoun conveys the same nuance of contempt. <br> 貴様 (きさま) you essentially a more formal version of てめ. In some contexts this does not convey contempt, but rather an expectation of humility or submission. <br> お主 (おぬし) you a very old second-person pronoun </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh, i see, so it's like she's talking with her mouth hanging open or something</br>  <br>Yea. Another thing you'll see is dakuten being added to words. いぐ for example, instead of 行く.</br>  <br>What the fug is an Ixrec?</br>  I've been studying for about 1 year and a half, know a few thousand words and I'm still not sure what だって means.  <br>It means all kinda things depending on context, kinda like "fuck"</br>  <br> 君 (きみ) you more friendly than おまえ, implying that there is some sort of relationship <br>No, 君 can be used with strangers in the proper context. Policemen stereotypically use it, for example. Also, using お前 with close friends is very common. <br><br> てめ you used primarily to express contempt of the subject. Also, attaching め to the end of any noun or pronoun conveys the same nuance of contempt. <br>Except this め has nothing to do with the め in てめえ.<br><br>I don't know much about ixrec but it sounds like he's just pulling this out of his ass. If he's going to bother covering shit like お主 he might as well cover 汝 or 自分 as a second person pronoun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It can mean either "also/but" (similar to でも) or be a quote. It's also used to elaborate reasons, especially when arguing or trying to convince the other person. <br><br>It would help if you posted specific examples, because explaining a grammar point/word that has so many uses is difficult without being specific.</br></br></br>  <br><br>By the way, since you two were nice enough to help me. Is it okay if most of the time I read けど at the end of sentences as a mood-marker-word(I don't know if I'm getting my meaning across) like よ? Because it almost never seems to mean "but" unless it's at the beginning or in a sentence.</br></br>  <br>I think you've got some problematic assumptions you're working on. No, けど doesn't always mean "but" in English, but that shouldn't be something surprising. It gives the listener room to interject and can make the difference between a natural and an unnatural sentence.</br>   looking up top reasons to learn english because i'm convinced its not worth it <br> most of the reasons are to get paid more money <br> doesn't matter if you already have a good job <br><br>Why bother learning English?</br></br></br></br>  <br>to my mind, it's almost exactly like ending an english sentence with "but..."<br><br>it sort of expresses doubt/uncertainty and prompts the other person to speak. like you hear people answer the phone and say 失礼けど… meaning something like "i know it's rude, but...

You have to lead the conversation 100% and be aggressive as hell. Once you've had a few "conversations" then you need to advance the relationship to the next level. For example, if the conversations were in text then tell (not ask) her that the next conversation will be voice. Then trade pics of each other etc etc. You have to keep it going. If you're stuck at the first step then drink a bit of alcohol. <br><br>If you're looking for just a friend then find a guy. They're MUCH easier to talk to than the women are.

Not to mention the god awful accents because that makes them 'sexy' and once I swore they were just straight up speaking Spanish.<br><br>English movies are a blessing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not sure. I hate language exchange sites because the conversations always seem to die out really quickly.</br>  <br>Are you at least learning every day for an hour? If you can't manage that, then there's something wrong with you. If you are spending that hour everyday on only anki then I'm not surprised. Drop anki and spend that time reading. Reading is the most important thing, although you should also listen and produce if you are able to. But if all you can do is read, do that. Spending all your time on anki will not teach you japanese. Beyond the beginner months, anki is a luxury. <br><br>I have a question though. You've been studying for 2 years; what is your ability at now? Can you read VNs at all? can you read shounen without a dictionary yet? If not, I'm sorry to tell you but you've been doing it wrong with whole time because I am quite capable already after half that time. Yes, I make mistakes all the time and have trouble with complicaed japanese, but I can understand 2ch and youtube comments completely and can understand most music I listen to, can read most manga without a dictionary and can understand youtube and niconico videos as long as it's not a long rant. You need to step up your game if you are not a tleast half that at this point. I'm aware that I'm privileged from being a neet so I'm giving you a 100% handicap, but you should at least be at half my level as a normie, I think. Otherwise you haven't been trying at all. Now, if you're only complaining because you're not fluent; that's to be expected, especially with an east asian language. Without living in the country fluency may never come.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you often go on autistic rants like this?</br>  <br>I'm probably autistic, sorry.</br>  Studied 29 cards in 13 minutes today.<br>Again count: 8 (72.4% correct)<br>Learn: 17, Review: 7, Relearn: 5, Filtered: 0</br></br>  I found this website ages ago about that had a pretty detailed explanation of 開け口 and words similar to it, explaining nice 連用形 too.<br>Anyone able to figure out what website it was?

I started sometime in 2013 at my college. For that year I didn't really do anything outside of class so I basically knew nothing. But 2014 I found anki and started practicing off and on. This summer I started going hard on anki and got burnt out so I started reading and that's what I'm doing now. <br><br>I still can't understand music, 2ch, or youtube comments. I can barely read manga cuz I always have to look up words. And you're right my effort has been shit thus far. <br><br>I'll just take it slow and read and do listening practice for 2hrs a day.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just started mining.

If you're reading and listening everyday, then you're on the right track. Good luck. <br><br>Do you have a good grammar base? Are you having any trouble when reading with grammar? This is very important, I think It's a huge different if you have a strong grammar base. <br><br>Personally, I used tae kim's guide and then afterwards, learned grammar from absorption. But if you have used a different source for grammar, maybe a bad text book that doesn't cover important slang stuff, you should maybe go back and study some grammar.

There hasn't even been a question about even basic grammar in quite a while despite there being questions like "How do I study Hiragana?" and "Why does Katakana have to exist?" as well as other equally stupid things that only a 5 year old would ask, and almost all of this has been caused by the overrun of summer fags. There's also been an increase in frog and shit posters as well, which I expect has also been caused by summer fags.<br><br>Of course, this is all only temporary. Once the summer fags leave because they've given up, things will go back to normal until Christmas comes again.</br></br></br></br></br>  How do I study Hirganaga?  <br>In addition to this, perhaps a really simple visual novel?

Please tell me this isn't true and she was just a nationalist or something...  <br> kanji <br>2,500-3,000 is probably more accurate. However she is probably talking about vocabulary in which they probably know at least 20,000 vocab.</br></br>  <br>It's true, at least for most educated people, but typically they can only write about 2000 or so of those from memory. The other 3000 or so are Kanji that they can only read.</br>  <br>I think I read somewhere that the average is 3000-3500, and that a really well educated person would know 5000 and any more and you get into specialized people who learn them for a living.</br>  <br>Your low with that vocabulary estimate. A 20 year old Japanese person will know about 45,000 to 50,000 words.<br> 語彙の総量を「語彙量」という。満年齢で6歳になる子どもの場合、理解語<wbr>彙の総量は、およそ5000～6000語ほど。13歳では3万語前後。20<wbr>歳ではおよそ4万5000～5万語ほどという調査結果が出ている[1]。</wbr></wbr> </br></br>  <br><br>Damn it... All this time I had the magic number 3000 in my head and I thought I would actually be able to do this shit. But 5000 is a whole other ball game.</br></br>  <br>Interesting.

The Scientists are dumber than they appear<br>2. The person helping her is VERY powerful politically/militarily/corporately and is thus keeping the scientists at bay.<br>3. Or the scientists are very smart and are actually using her to identify more people with abilities and the person helping her is actually in league/controlled by them in the first place.<br>4.
