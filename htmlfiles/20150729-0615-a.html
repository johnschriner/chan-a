[ read the guide buyfag.moe  Reminder: No Togou scale and life isn't worth living.  I'm still disappointed that there were no other Rin scales announce at Wonfest. The aniplex one has a dumb looking face.  Wonfest was nothing but boatsluts and mikushits  <br>at least there was one good figure.</br>    Aren't you glad the USD and Euro are strong against the Yen? <br><br>It almost converts the price 1:1 and makes shipping free.</br></br>  <br>Maybe one day they might make a Ginko figure too</br>  <br>I wish I had a better job and more disposable income to really take advantage of this.</br>    When does the Rin Hoshizora fan book ver. fig come out?<br>amiami.com/top/detail/detail?scode=<wbr>FIGURE-011054<br>its late july already fug</br></wbr></br>  <br><br>I can't wait to clean her with  my q-tip </br></br>  Best MF sculptor is now making swords. <br> I like it. </br>  <br>best boy too, hopefully it's not too boring</br>  <br>I'm still mad that even this little shit is getting a scale and Imanotsurugi gets nothing.</br>   payment request for IA/VT Colorful <br>It's finally happening.</br>  Really Aquamarine? That's the shittiest base I've seen.  <br>You should see football Pochaco's base.<br><br>It looks like someone just cut a piece of MDF and used that. Basically the only flaw with an otherwise 10/10 figure.</br></br></br>  <br>Making good bases is a rarely practised art. Some of the large, gorgeous figs are a let down because the characters are just standing on a round piece of plastic.</br>  I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm actually tempted to buy a One Piece figure<br>at least this set is cheap</br>  <br>Do people actually like this art style? I've always thought it just looked shitty.</br>  <br>I never thought it looked good on figures, but this one looks cute as fuck</br>  <br> Trying this hard to fit in <br>You forgot swords and idols.</br></br>  <br>reminder she was in sm brothel around the age shown on your picture</br>  <br>You do know you're supposed to take that off right.<br>It's actually a mirror base.</br></br>  <br>I still can't fathom what the maker thought when he decided on those colors.</br>  <br>I didn't, but that's good.</br>  <br>Pochaco has the prefect fatty body that you just want to fuck, unfortunately her baby face ruines it.</br>  <br>He thought "I'm going to repaint it all white with my cum".</br>  <br>if you like pochacho you've already got shit taste so might as well have shit taste in colours</br>  <br> even better </br>  <br>what the hell is that</br>  <br>1/60 Koto Arbalest's announcement makes the entire event.</br>  <br>That shit is nothing compared to Ayesha's plain white base.</br>  <br>Plain white is fine. It's not interesting but it's not actively offensive either.</br>  It sucks when you get a figure that can 99.99% stand up by itself and then they give it a HUGE base instead of just putting a little base on each foot which would stabilise it and take up significantly less room.  <br>Figures look a hell of a lot nicer with a base than without.</br>  So, did they show anything related to pic related during wonfes?  Is there a gallery I can go too that will show me everything from Wonfest?  Lewd.  <br>I just want clear bases and across all lines. This is the most practical solution. the decorative shit just detracts from the figure.</br>  <br>BEAT's Tamamo? Unfortunately, nothing.</br>  How stupid am I for wanting this? She's a 1/3 scale doll. Shipping will be stupid expensive.  <br>Sometimes unique bases can be great, but I also like the uniformity that clear bases can give across a collection.</br>  <br> 1GBP = 192.89 JPY <br>What a time to be alive.</br></br>  <br>To me that looks like crap. The bottom of the dress looks ratty and hangs in a weird way. Just way for the RAH version. I'm sure that will happen and look a thousand times better.</br>  <br>Between that diamond Miku and this, it's like they're not trying with poses anymore.<br><br>Can you even curl 3 toes without curling the first 2?</br></br></br>  <br>Nope nothing new on that and I've been on the usual twatter tags for it the last few days.<br>But I don't have big hopes for it to be shown anytime soon tbh.<br>FLARE did enough for me!<br>And I'm curious how Broccoli will handle her Goth lolita costume. Too bad there are no better pictures of the prototype though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck. I'd never even thought about the curled toes, that's actually pretty much impossible to do.</br>  How are you supposed to display figures that don't have stands?  <br>Have you looked at the pricetag?<br><br>Azone's other homu doll looks kinda sorta acceptable, but not really great either.<br><br>But that just looks like shit. And that's in a promo picture. In real life they often look worse to some degree.<br>Specifically the jagged fringes of her half-skirt look bad.<br><br><br><br>I would think curling toes might be possible if you train for it. Like some people can't do the vulcan salute initially.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The people whose arms get cut off/deformed and then learn to use their feet like hands probably can.</br>  <br>I love this Yuuki.</br>  <br> I would think curling toes might be possible if you train for it. Like some people can't do the vulcan salute initially. <br>I hadn't thought of that. Though now I'm wondering if I can train my toes to do the vulcan salute.<br><br><br>That's disturbing, but a valid point.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Meanwhile on Paypal:<br><br> 1 GBP = 184.169 JPY </br></br></br>  <br>I think this is impossible to recreate as shown. I remember vaguely someone telling that it has something to do with the way the tendons are attached. I think the feet look weird but not unacceptable but its obviously pandering to a certain demographic.</br>  <br>Like figures that are laying? Just put them on the shelf, or on something soft on the shelf.</br>  <br>for that purpose<br>I'm not afraid to pay AmiAmi with my shitty visa classic, and my bank's rates are tons better.</br></br>  <br>Attach magnets to their feet.</br>  <br>Nah, standing up. Just doesn't have a stand.</br>  anybody have her yet?  <br>too puffy. no thong.</br>  <br>Just checked wikipedia. Looks like the small toes mostly move as a group although the little toe can move somewhat independently.<br><br>Let's conclude miku is not human.</br></br></br>  When she's up to pre-order tell me  <br>I think she'll go great with Misa, but I'm begging for a  cast-on .</br>  <br> FREEing <br>I'll be keeping my money</br></br>  <br>thats why I didnt pre-order it, but its takane so I really wanna know how it turned out</br>  <br> thong <br>disgusting</br></br>  <br> I'm glad I'm not the only one. </br>  <br>I like how they conveniently leave out the angle with her disgusting lumpy stomach.</br>  <br>That's the reason why review blogs exist.</br>  Where can I get a rotating base like the ones reviewers use to take photos of figures?    <br> tfw canadian </br>  <br>Well thanks to my country's economy failing it's now 3 to 1, but somehow I still have to get all those plastic butts</br>  <br>What country?</br>  <br>Same as Noodles, Malaysia</br>  Enjoy the twenty-eighth of July.  <br>Thanks anon.</br>  Has anyone here used suruga-ya.jp?<br><br>It's got an obscure book I want but seems kind of shifty</br></br>  <br>They sometimes are a bit slow but otherwise good.<br>Oh, and they didn't include a preorder CD once even though it was listed.</br></br>  <br>The picture actually made me laugh. Thanks, you too.</br>  Where's my fucking Feito, Alter?    <br> shifty <br>Nah, they're fine. Don't expect perfect books though, even if they don't mention any damage.</br></br>    <br>So I should go with the second linked book then?<br><br>http://www.suruga-ya.jp/product/det<wbr>ail/185135613001<br>http://www.suruga-ya.jp/product/det<wbr>ail/185025353001<br><br>They're the same book but the fact that they're mentioning damage in the first one might mean that it's really bad</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  THREE MORE WEEKS  <br>If they can balance on their own you can just put them on a shelf like any other figure. The downside is that they won't be as stable.</br>  <br>Is FREEing really that bad? From some of the reviews I've seen they weren't so bad.</br>  <br><br>I've just had her shipped RSAL from Amiami, pretty hype, her hair seems like it would be brittle as fuck though.</br></br>  <br>It can't be as bad as Racing Miku 2011's can it?</br>  <br>Yes, avoid Rank B items in general. With that price difference I'm guessing there's some really visible damage. The second listing might not be perfect, but it at least shouldn't have tears or stains.</br>  <br>Thanks anon</br>   store exclusives are still a thing   <br>Their 1/8s can be pretty subpar for the price. Their 1/4s often look great.</br>  I remember an anon use too post pictures of Magician Miku every thread hoping a figure would be made of her. I guess he gave up hope.  <br> memegenerator </br>  <br>Will we ever see more BRS figs? I would buy the shit out of a new line..</br>  <br>Reddit told me if I meme hard enough bad things will go away</br>  <br>I don't think much is happening anymore in terms of BRS sadly, the creator artist hasn't drawn her in years afaik</br>  Slightly vidya, but a new daki is always nice.  <br>Yeah I order from them all the time, they have some insane good stuff for a very low price every now and then.<br><br>I'd find myself using them more than manda if they shipped overseas without proxy</br></br></br>  <br>nigga senran is always relevant</br>  <br>Pushing Yumi for Summerslam</br>  <br>Yumi already has a daki, this is going to be something new but limited to this version only<br><br>I want a proper Hikage daki</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Note – The Dakimakura design will be a character featured in ESTIVAL VERSUS and not the design featured on this preview – which shall be updated accordingly in our UPDATE features. <br><br>Wonder who it'll actually be</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>STILL FUCKING SAD.<br>4TH RELEASE WHEN?</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much all of the cast are featured in EV, but it seems more likely that it would be one of the new characters</br>  <br>You should have bought it off amazonjp anon, oh well.</br>  <br> EU and AU only <br><br>Fuck</br></br></br>  <br>Same thing happened with Shinovi Versus if I recall.</br>  <br>Xseed localized SV for the states.</br>  <br>I meant the Limited Editions that EU and Australia got and not the US.</br>  <br>I came this close to reserving the SSSSSSS edition despite not even owning a ps4 yet.</br>  What went right?  <br>The hair gradient.</br>  <br><br>It should've been Karen.</br></br>  <br>I'm still pissed about chino</br>  <br>Let's not talk about Chino.</br>  <br>I ordered both for Vita and PS4, and I don't even have a PS4 yet.</br>  <br> USD and Euro are strong against the Yen?  <br>  and Euro <br><br>NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU NO ITS NOT FUCK YOU <br><br>I AM PAYING LIKE 30% MORE THAN I WOULD IF WE STILL HAD THE DM FUCK THIS EURO SHIT I WANT OUT</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Too bad if you pay in Paypal you lose most of that power.</br>  <br>Ruhig bleiben, Bernd.

Economically speaking, what would happen if Greece is bombed? Would it be that bad?</br></br>  <br>Unless you modify the settings, Paypal automatically uses its own shitty conversion rate rather than the interbank exchange rate.<br><br>For example 1 GBP = 184.169 JPY whereas the interbank exchange rate is 1 GBP = 192.92 JPY. Exchanging £100 under Paypal's rates would cost you £4.50 compared to if you had exchanged under the interbank rate.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't it a little early for europoors to be up?</br>  <br> 6pm <br> Early </br></br>  <br>Half 6/half 7 in the afternoon?<br><br>Yeah mate.</br></br></br>  <br>PayPal's rates are always at least 2.5% behind the current rate, sometimes more since they update just twice a day.<br><br>If you use a card through them you can change it to use your bank's exchange rate. Otherwise you're stuck with PayPal's rate.</br></br></br>  <br>The value of the Euro would decrease even further meaning plastic butts would become even more expensive than they already are.<br><br>The only good thing is that if they bomb hard enough we might EVENTUALLY stop pouring down billions of tax money into their shitty country.<br><br><br>How can I sleep when my country is falling apart around me thanks the the EU?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope.

Still missing other faces</br>  <br> emotionless  <br>It's shit</br></br>  <br>I also pay tax money on the shipping plus the wares.<br><br>I wouldn't give a shit if they inspected my figures in front of me even if it were naked lolis.

But I'd feel like I wasted money leaving her head in the box because it reminds me too much of Chucky.</br>    <br> go through old coins I have <br> 5DM piece from 1994 <br>surely you must be over 21.<br><br> also find drachma <br>oh the ironing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>looks cute. but the quasi-rabbit blob seems too small</br>  <br>Do you eat shit?</br>  <br>they screwed up her tits and her face.</br>  <br>They're making a whole line out of 1/4 bunny girls.</br>  <br>I don't like the design itself. But I do like that they're trying to vary their bunny designs, adding a jacket to the mix.</br>  <br>Bunny girls tend to be 1/4 for whatever fucking reason.</br>  <br>Probably easier to do the fishnets that way</br>  Will  Aquamarine  save us all?  <br>Yes.<br><br>But if not, Koto will.</br></br></br>  <br>so cute</br>  <br><br>  tfw one of the few good things good about Brittan </br></br>  <br><br>Because they look better, Bunny girls 1/8 always look like meh, just another scale more.</br></br>  <br>I know, I just don't really get why. I'd love to get her at 1/7 <br><br><br>There are a bunch of bunny girl figures at 1/7 that don't have issues with fishnets.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bought Elsa in hopes of them making Anna.

Everything in 1/4 should theoretically look better.</br>  <br>Nope. A guy actually got arrested for similar shit not too recently.</br>  <br>what makes them open parcels. do they get a heads up from the seller or do they just check parcels at random?<br><br>......what</br></br></br>  <br> Tumblr <br>Stop posting now and save yourself from further embarrasment.</br></br>  <br>Yes please</br>  <br>More than likely, only actual depicted sexual activity is illegal.

Now the 6 month wait begins...  <br>must be fun to be rich</br>  <br>Anyone bought pic, is it any good?</br>  <br>yeah</br>  Why did the redhead lesbian suddenly turn bi in the second season?  <br>atleast its not VLC</br>  <br>File -&gt; Save Image</br>  <br>Because being a lesbian is just a phase.</br>  <br>I watched the specials that came out first. Near the end she went full dere, I only picked up the anime ebcause of this. It took a fucking full season for it to happen in the anime. I was pissed but I was rewarded. Dere straight Kuuko a best.</br>  Sexual frustration. Think of how blue balled Nyaruko left her.  <br>Because bi &gt; straight &gt; gay</br>  <br> where is the print screen key </br>  OP, I'm sure you think you're being funny, but you're not, you talk like a fag and your shit's all retarded and your bait is weak.  <br>Implying that these abominations ever had a real gender.</br>  <br>This bait is so try-hard it's not even funny.</br>  <br><br><br><br>You guys laugh, but as someone with keycaps on my keyboard with no letters, I frequently have to look up the printscrn key</br></br></br></br>  <br> where is the print screen key </br>  Mahiro is fucking cute as hell. He looks especially girly. How could you not want to pound this cutie? Pretty sure he turns everyone around him bi. <br><br>Imagine how good a threesome with him and his mom would be, holy fuck. I love being bisexual.</br></br>  <br> You guys laugh <br>No, no I didn't. I just cringed.<br>As I did again right now, watching your desperate damage control.</br></br></br>  <br>It's kinda funny.</br>  <br>Just stop posting.</br>  <br>Fuck you. I'm not OP.</br>  <br> dat fork <br>Nope, I want to stay alive. 0/10 wouldn't fuck.</br></br>  <br>Because people have fetishes.</br>  <br>I expected gay porn with hats</br>  do you live in 2006, OP?  <br>hurr durr everything is b8 m8<br><br><br><br>Is this bait?</br></br></br></br></br>  What happened to those lovecraftian writeups of each episode? Did the guy stop doing those?  <br>No, you're born with your sexuality.<br>This slut was bi all the time though, she just didn't know.</br></br>  <br>this actually isn't far from the truth. many school girls in japan go through a light yuri, or esu phase before becoming mature enough to begin seeking relationships with the opposite sex. tends to be common amongst middle school girls</br>  <br>I want to kill this heterosexual slut.</br>  Cute lesbian girls submitting to the cock is my sexual fetish.  <br>Not OP but you're a complete faggot.</br>  <br>The power of the dick.<br><br><br>Also this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's too bad the lazy faggot artist didn't change her facial expressions at all.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>wut</br>  Rei or Asuka?  Blue is my favourite colour.  Shikanami a shit  Whichever pisses off the most people.  <br>(you forgot to add Misato)</br>  Shinji.        <br>That ass is flat. 'Animation team fuckup' levels of flat.</br>      <br> Or </br>  <br>Down with the tsunbitch<br>This is REAL best girl.</br></br>    <br>back when he was still with us...</br>  <br>What's moot?</br>  <br><br>Asuka Soryu</br></br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  And after what I have to choose the best take both.  Rei.  <br>Asuka because I'm a masochist.</br>  Misato  <br>Asuka because I prefer a real person</br>  Asuka has better rape doujins while Rei has better prostitution materials.  Rei  <br>I'm going to marry Asuka-chan!</br>  I'd like to imagine that I'd hate anyone with the personality that Asuka has. The truth is my past few girlfriends had strikingly similar personalities to Asuka. Guess I'm a masochist or have a thing for red headed psychobitches.  Rei all the way!  How can any fucking autist prefer Asuka over Rei? <br><br> asuka <br> annoying <br> rash <br> slut <br> shit at piloting evas  <br> has to be saved all the time <br><br>Rei is better in every other way holy shit<br><br>Only reason why someone would prefer Asuka is if they overlooked personality for looks, which is completely immature</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Liking Asuka over Rei is immature.</br>  Rei because in the end would come after me.  <br>Asuka may have a shit personality but Rei has no personality. Asuka has the opputunity to grow out of her bitchiness and at least I can connect to her and comfort her on some level. Rei is a cold shell. She isn't supposed to exist and she knows it. She will never connect to you emotionally because she knows she's an ancient being that created the human race trapped inside the body of some build-a-bear styled girl. The only time Rei would be a better choice is if Third Impact is coming soon.</br>  <br><br>Not being perfect is just human.<br>Why would someone prefer someone like Rei who is in barely any way like an actual human being.<br><br>Asuka is the way real girls often are, especially at her age. But Rei is just as much of a fucking fantasy as Kaworu. <br><br>You know what´s immature? Liking a character that´s 2deep because it makes you feel mature and prefering her over a realistic character like Misato or Asuka. It´s just delusional and escapism.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think your post just explained why people choose Asuka over Rei.<br><br>They don't understand the characters. They're making a mistake.<br><br>Rei has a personality and she actually shows progress in growing out of her coldness. She meets Shinji and forms an emotional connection with him in the series, and through Shinji as well as the others is capable of analyzing and understanding herself better eventually leading to some of her problems solving or easing up.<br><br>Asuka on the other hand doesn't show capability to grow like Rei does, and is more likely to self-destruct internally than accept her own flaws and do something about it. That's how the series ended.<br><br>Then Asuka has issues that makes her have no personality. Unlike Rei who is more free in what she thinks, Asuka is locked down to following the role NERV assigned, to be an EVA-pilot. She has no personality because she just clings to that role mindlessly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not being perfect is just human. <br>Who said Rei is perfect? NGE sure as hell didn't.<br><br> Asuka is the way real girls often are, especially at her age. But Rei is just as much of a fucking fantasy as Kaworu.  <br>Some are, some aren't. Asuka is equally as much as a fantasy because of these facts:<br><br>1- She is not real. She is a cartoon.<br>2- Even as a cartoon, she has poorly developed "ideal traits" such as being a child prodigy who graduated with some unspecified college degree, and is a special snowflake since she's a "chosen" pilot and all.<br><br>"Immature" is not realizing the two and pretending one cartoon is more real than the other.<br><br>There are far more Rei's in this world than there are Asuka's. Rei is the model of an unfortunate, tragic and systematically neglected child, who there are far more of in this world than spoiled early graduates. (That's a sad fact FYI)<br><br>No, anon, escapism is parading your own choice of a cartoon character as "better" because it's more realistic, which makes it the ultimate form of escapism since as pointed out earlier, neither of them are real.<br>Pretending Asuka is real is more or less entering an even deeper state of escapism and self-delusion.<br><br>This is why this: <br>is the logical and mature way to see things, despite how immaturely it was worded. As a person, Rei is far more admirable and meaningful than Asuka is as a character. Asuka's only achievement is imitating life, while Rei's character does both that and achieves giving us some understanding and appreciation for life. Rei might one day make life imitate art, despite how scary that might sound.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Then Asuka has issues that makes her have no personality. Unlike Rei who is more free in what she thinks, Asuka is locked down to following the role NERV assigned, to be an EVA-pilot. She has no personality because she just clings to that role mindlessly. <br><br>Now that´s just bullshit. You might as well say you don´t have a personality because you do what your boss tells you at work and then you do it.</br></br></br>  Why not misato?  <br>Rei because I prefer her and it's funny how mad she makes people.</br>  <br> Now that´s just bullshit. You might as well say you don´t have a personality because you do what your boss tells you at work and then you do it. <br><br>If you do so in the same way that Asuka does, then yeah. Asuka doesn't really have a life outside piloting.<br><br>If I took away your work, you could start at another place if I offered you the job. If I said Asuka couldn't pilot any more or she couldn't, then she'd kill herself just like she attempted to do so in the anime.<br><br>Asuka isn't "just following orders" from her boss, her entire personality and self-worth is based on being what someone else wants her to be. She's entirely dependent on it, her entire person is, and her brash personality is therefore essentially something NERV gave her.<br><br>Compare with Rei, who is extremely obedient but - isn't at all dependent on being obedient. That is if we took away Rei's job, her purpose, then she'd still move along at her own pace. Rei not being able to pilot doesn't harm her self-worth. <br><br><br>OP didn't ask. Misato is best woman though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Gendo  <br> Who said Rei is perfect? NGE sure as hell didn't. <br>I´m just saying that Rei isn´t nearly as flawed as any other character except for Kaworu who is literally Jesus. Rei doesn´t hurt anyone.<br><br> she has poorly developed "ideal traits" such as being a child prodigy who graduated with some unspecified college degree, and is a special snowflake since she's a "chosen" pilot and all <br><br>Who cares about that? That´s not why people like Asuka. <br><br> There are far more Rei's in this world than there are Asuka's. <br><br>Not where I life. I can not recall to have ever met anyone who is remotly like Rei. <br><br> unfortunate, tragic and systematically neglected child <br><br>You mean Shinji?<br><br> Pretending Asuka is real is more or less entering an even deeper state of escapism and self-delusion. <br><br>Fucking strawman. I never said she´s real just that her character comes closer to that of a real person.<br><br> As a person, Rei is far more admirable and meaningful than Asuka is as a character. <br><br>So what? She´s not realistic in my opinion. Shinji is, Asuka is, pretty much any Eva character is except her. That´s why I prefer Asuka.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I´m just saying that Rei isn´t nearly as flawed as any other character except for Kaworu who is literally Jesus. Rei doesn´t hurt anyone. <br>She slaps Shinji, inadvertently hurts Asuka's pride, and makes Gendo so crushed he falls on his knees by the end of the series.<br><br>There's more to being flawed than hurting others. Rei hurts herself, and is emotionally stunted. She lacks social understanding. These are flaws.<br><br> Who cares about that? That´s not why people like Asuka.  <br>People who like Asuka care, and you're wrong in asserting it's not a reason. You can't ignore a part of the character because it doesn't suit you.<br><br> Not where I life. I can not recall to have ever met anyone who is remotly like Rei.  <br>You live in a better part of the world, and people like Rei are usually either in therapy, locked up in some basement or out in the wild (literally). There's more damaged and abused children in this world than there are early college graduates. Even where you live probably, but I don't think you hang out around psychiatric wards or similar places.<br><br> You mean Shinji? <br>Him too, but Rei even moreso.<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128710903#p128718008">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry but this Asuka doesn´t have a proper personality won´t become a new maymay. Not as long as I´m her.<br><br> her brash personality is therefore essentially something NERV gave her. <br><br>Where did you get this idea from. She was told she would be a pilot and then decided she would do her best to gain respect. She came to that decision because of her shitty parents and everything not because of NERV.<br><br>The fact that she cares so much about being a pilot is the point. She extremly pround and strong enough to show her intentions. You say she doesn´t have a real personality because of that but dude, that is her personality.<br><br>Rei has nothing she cares about. You can tell her she has to pilot the EVA one day and the next day she has to become a scientist or whatever. She doesn´t do what she does because she wants to. Essentially she just pilots the Eva because Gendo wants her to not because she wants.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sorry but this Asuka doesn´t have a proper personality won´t become a new maymay. Not as long as I´m her. <br><br>You self insert as Asuka?</br></br></br>  <br>You don´t?</br>  Less arguing more Eva girls.  For someone that is supposed to be lewd, her reaction on that scene was a bit surprising.  <br>MC porbably has a huge penis.</br>  She is actually purer than Anna.  <br>She's a poser. Pretending to be something she is not. It's all a facade, all lies.</br>  <br>Anna is a huge slut that has no shame because she doesn't know any better<br>Kajo is embarrassed because she knows exactly what she's looking at</br></br>  <br>But japs have small dicks</br>  <br>Are you talking from personal experience? Have you seen many? How big of a sample size are we talking here, 100 Japanese dicks?</br>  <br>There're exceptions to every rule.<br>Like how chinese are supposed to be short until some 7ft tall freak of nature is born and becomes a basketball star.</br></br>  <br>thats only cause the wank so much<br>this is a world where wanking is outlawed</br></br>  Kajo's mind is lewd and her heart pure. Her cause is noble. <br><br>She would be best lover.</br></br>  <br>Yep.<br>Kajo a best. Gap moe a best.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>No one would take walking in on getting NTR'd well.</br>  There's a manga of this right? Or an LN?<br>Who does the protag get with Anna or best girl Kajo? I have to know.</br>  She has a dirty mind but she's not actually horny.<br><br>And she probably never saw a real dick before, she only spreads 2D stuff.</br></br>  <br>That was no freak accident, the Chinese government had their tallest people marry and have children for the sole purpose of tall children</br>  <br>On-going LN, has a manga adaptation as well.<br><br>Apparently both Anna and Kajo formally confess their love at around the same time, not sure what volume that happens--I assume the latest. Kajo confesses as she's being arrested for something.<br><br>With any luck we'll get an unconventional polygamy end.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>glasses kajo is best kajo.</br>  <br>He's a big guy.</br>  <br>For you.</br>  The OP shows her and Tanuki both going nude-terrorist so she's probably not dickophobic in of itself  <br>Why am I not surprised?</br>  <br> Anna is a huge slut <br> only lusts for one guy's D <br>She isn't anon. She;s indeed incredibly lewd but nowhere being a slut.</br></br></br>  <br>You know what I meant. She's consumed with cocklust.</br>  <br>No. There's a big difference. Being a slut means she wouldn't care whose D it was. Anna is still virgin and badly wants it from a single guy.</br>  <br>Yes anon, I get that. I wasn't literally calling her a slut in that sense. It was the easiest word to get my point across.<br><br>Rest soundly, your waifu's purity has not been insulted.</br></br></br>    <br>MC has a huge D. But why does it not even bulge on his pants?</br>  <br>stylistic choice</br>  <br>Grower not a shower<br>Or mandatory bulge-free future pants to protect our vulnerable youth</br></br>  <br>I thought Japan used the metric system.</br>  <br>He better fuck them both. He better fucking fuck them both. Don't you go and be a little faggot, Tanukichi.</br>  <br>Obviously this universe is so prude because in their reality America was run by Puritans from the very beginning and eventually they took over the world.</br>  <br>They do. Maybe its metric on the flip side of the ruler.</br>    <br><br>Cocks are measured in inches. everywhere</br></br>  <br>He's a big guy</br>  <br> Possible harem. <br><br>Thanks for the warning. I was enjoying this show, good thing i found out about this now before I went any further.<br><br>Dropped</br></br></br></br></br>   you will never eat Anna-sama's shit   <br>she's a phony, wasn't it obvious?</br>  <br>Yes, that's why she's using a metric ruler to measure him.</br>   not measuring your cock in feet   <br> feet <br> not miles </br></br>  <br>She's pretty much that one bitch from American Beauty. Can talk up sex for days but when it cones to the real thing, shes just as cherry as everyone else.</br>  I-I thought she was acting like she was surprised. Guess not.  <br><br> measuring by length and not weight </br></br>  <br><br>Good, thats one-less faggot with shit taste.</br></br>  <br> two girls <br> harem <br>Euthanize thyself.</br></br></br>  <br> Weight <br> Not Volume and Density </br></br>  <br><br>this show had so much promise, dropped</br></br>  <br> not by the number of particles </br>  Real semen demon when?  <br>To be fair, he did say possible.<br><br>Hyouka seems to be into him in ways most emotionless characters show it</br></br></br>  <br>His member is big but his body isn't. Anna is even bigger than he is.</br>  <br/>  <br>Sadly, this doesn't make sense. If you measure by number of particles, the number will be huge which means you are trying to overcompensate. The others worked because even a small amount using those units of measurement is huge for a cock.</br>        <br>So this is where cowtits mirai came from.</br>  <br>I think it was more from seeing your best friend naked and trying to seduce your other new fried.<br><br>Kinda like how it's really awkward to walk in on family members getting kinky or stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/mgg/</br>  This anime is pantsu-on-head retarded.<br><br>Still, the action sequences are kinda fun</br></br>  So if nobody knows where babies come from how have the birth rates not fallen and the country dissappeared?  <br>Like I said, show's retarded</br>  <br>its about up until high school probably.</br>  <br>who says this isn't happening?</br>  <br><br>Can't self insert anymore, faggot?</br></br>  <br>Did you ever read The Giver when you were younger? Might work the same way. <br><br>Or maybe, since the textbook answer in this world is "When a man and a woman love each other and get married..." maybe there's some kind of official intercourse process after weddings.</br></br></br>  <br>Artificial insemination maybe. That way only the ones who were selected by the government would know how a baby is really formed.</br>  <br><br>There's a pretty big jump from dirty jokes to witnessing p0n0s about to enter vag00 in real life.</br></br>  <br>i guess there will be an official training course or book once you are married. <br> Ok you are married, you may now officially kiss, also here is a book, be sure to study it well *grin* </br></br>  <br>Because if it were happening they wouldn't go further with the laws as they're doing because they'll destroy the country</br>  <br>Like most of /a/ I guess, we talk about lewd things all the time but only a very small percentage of anons actually had sex.</br>  <br>Or he might have a lot of dick cheese. <br><br>Imagine that smell hitting you full on.</br></br></br>  More important than that, how come in a extremely morally conservative society they let a girl wear such short shorts?  <br>This so much. You all acting surprised as if most people in this board wouldn't lose their cool if they saw a vagina in real life</br>  <br>my friend and his gf had sex on the bed behind me while I was playing burnout and that didn't bother me one bit.</br>  <br><br>This show is fucking terrible. It's not funny in the slightest, the MC is a huge beta faggot. And the characters are completely uninteresting.<br><br>Anime just plain blows, it seems. Manga is vastly superior.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But my doujins told me the smell turns girls into cock slaves!</br>  <br>She looks like a kid, the law must ignore lolicons exist<br><br>(like how British law used to outlaw gays but not lesbians)</br></br></br>  <br>okay then</br>  <br>People actually thinking this is good should just watch Qwaser instead. That thing was an absolute masterpiss.</br>  <br><br>That repressed sexual tension has to come out somehow</br></br>  <br>Did he fuck Eva?</br>  <br>This dude has a point. Also can you even buy shorts this short any more? Those look like they're out of the 80s.<br><br>Not that any of you fags would remember the 80s...</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't know which is funnier, that it "didn't bother" you, or that it didn't bother them to have sex behind you.</br></br>  <br>It's about as appealing to them as tuna vaginas are to men.</br>  <br>Everyone did, Volgin even did it up the ass</br>  <br>I remember the 80s, micheal jackson was still alive, and black.</br>  Kajo is healthy lewd, Anna isnt more lewd its just that those kids are cannisters so full of opressed sexual desires they dont even realise it so when they get poked it blews the whole thing. <br>Kajo lets steam off gradually like you are supposed to.</br>  <br>Those are in fashion again, or at least they are were I live</br>  <br>A little bit of natural dick stank is fine but dick cheese is fucking disgusting in any case. They put that shit in doujins because they're written by and/or for ronery unwashed otaku.</br>  <br><br>Anon I saw a real life 3DPD loli wearing booty shorts walking down the streets not too long ago</br></br>  <br>there were two other people in the room too.</br>  <br>So she's just boring.</br>  <br>were you able to hide that you were checking her out?</br>  kajo is normal lewd girl<br><br>Anna is "pure" semen demon</br></br>  <br>I'm not sure there was anyone who did not fuck Eva in Snake Eater. Except for Ocelot.</br>  <br><br>Yes<br><br>But that was because I averted my eyes like a second later. I don't wanna turn into a 3DPD pedo, that shit carries too much baggage<br><br>For real though, that booty was nice.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why'd she beat him down and tie him up if she thought he was consenting?</br>  I bet Anna is the type of heroine that is willing to share.  Talking about "unexpected" personality traits, eyebags-chan has a pretty decent awareness actually.<br><br>How mad is she going to be? I can feel her tranquil fury.</br></br>  <br>tired of all anime being the same show but different costumes</br>  <br>Far, far from it. She gets all stabby when other girls get too close to Tanuki.</br>  <br>Dude, he had a pituitary gland disorder. His body produced an abnormal amount of growth hormones, just like Robert Wadlow. <br><br>If that is not a freak accident, I don't know what is.</br></br></br>  <br>She's possessive as fuck</br>  <br>why is that though, why are we drawn all to the same place?</br>  When does slutty Mirai show up?  <br>That's her natural way of expressing her unadulterated love, anon. If he's consenting, anything goes.</br>  <br>She could be mad for many different reasons in that pic.<br><br><br>Really? He isn't hers. All she has for him is lust, not true love. It isn't as if they're going out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter to her. She is dedicated pursuing him with all the strength of her resolve and her purity. Anyone who gets in her way is just a pest to be exterminated.</br>  <br> Anna confesses in vol. 8, Kajou in 9 before she gets caught by Anna. MC comes back to rescue Kajou and then in that cafe they talk about future. He says that he will drop out of school and asks Kajou if she want to run away with him and live in some quiet place. They planned to take everyone from SOX with them. Annie even dances and sings 'polygamy, polygamy'. He gives Kajou present for White Day and almost confesses, but zendouka with his mom barges in and arrests Kajou. </br>  <br>not this season.</br>  <br>I'm not sure Kajo would be into sharing.</br>  <br>That is almost into yandere territory. I sure hope she has no access to dangerous instruments or poison. Good thing she is friends with Ayame so there won't be any bad blood there.</br>  <br><br>Well, sounds like shit. Time to drop this then.</br></br>  <br> I sure hope she has no access to dangerous instruments <br>Kitchen knives, dude. Sharp ones.</br></br>  <br>    Kajou in 9 before she gets caught by Anna <br>How'd Anna take  Kajou's confession? </br></br>  <br> Slapped her cheek, Ayame fainted. Later when Kajou wakes up Anna says, that she wanted to kill her but somehow she held back and doesn't understand why. </br>  <br> Not too well it seems. She was screaming in front of them so Tanukichi wouldn't hear her. Well that what the LN peeps translated. </br>  <br><br><br>Were all gonna look anyway, its not a serious anime. I appreciate you blacking it out, but i dont think its needed anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>What I wanna know is why Kajo even romantically likes Tanuki. Anna's only there for sex, but did Kajo develop feelings after being with Tanuki for so long?</br>  <br><br>That's fucking scary. I thought she would be more of a joke character. <br><br> Are you sure Anna's anger isn't because Kajou is a terrorist? Tanukichi shouldn't be that important to her. Where does she develop "love" since it seems she just wants to fuck him. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Quints confirm life to be meaningless and bleak.</br>  It's pathetic that he would go for the girl with severe tourettes and a problem with getting intimate. <br>But it's not like light novels and the people writing them are worth giving a shit about besides the lewd.</br>  <br>Meh, I hope this is fake spoilers.<br><br>But then again it's LN. They always come with nice concepts but blow everything with terrible outcomes.</br></br></br>  <br>He looks good in garters and stockings.</br>  <br>The way I see it, the kiss just unlocked her lust. It could've been anyone, it just happened to be the MC.</br>  <br>This.</br>  I wonder if Anna was properly educated would she be more understanding.  <br> Anna stops being lewd after she thought she got pregnant and her mother tells her that pregnancy is obscene. She is angry because Kajou betrayed her twice. At least that's what she thinks. She was Ao and Anna thinks Kajou somewhat deceived Tanukichi and that's the reason he drifted away from Anna. She knows that she made a mistake somewhere, but she misunderstands and says that her only mistake was that she trusted Kajou and entrusted Tanukichi to her that day when he entered seitokai. Kajou wants to explain herself to her but she wouldn't listen. She repeats 'Give that person back' during their conversation. When Mizukume asks for オナ禁百日目童貞 name Anna just says 'I won't let any other women get near him ever again, even if it's you'. </br>  <br>She would probably not be going on a witch hunt, threatening to stab people, and attempting to rape people.</br>  <br>Okay, smart guy.<br>The entire anti-lewd stuff was introduced 16 years ago in the story, so everyone older than the main cast know perfectly well how babies are made.<br><br>Additionally, why do you believe teen pregnancy is more common in areas/communities where sex ed is not a thing? <br>Anna almost raped the MC and thought she was doing nothing wrong. Had Kajo not intervened, Anna would probably be pregnant right then.<br><br>tl;dr: No sex ed doesn't mean no sex.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  doujins when?  <br>I kekd</br>  <br>Never, moons hate this anime</br>   No girl will ever get dripping wet at the yhought of you. <br><br>This hurts a bit more than it probably should.</br></br>  <br>is she pretending to fuck her seat upwards?</br>  <br>It's just going faster and faster the more I look at it.</br>  <br>Someone needs to rape her so she learns her lesson and stops acting like a pervert that she's not.</br>  <br> Can you buy shorts that short anymore <br>Yes. Go to California in the summer and you'll find that out pretty quickly.</br></br>  <br>So why Anna thought she was pregnant? Did she actually had sex? And behaving so lewd how she avoided being arrested?</br>  <br>That's actually the one this that isn't outlawed yet. They can supposedly trace the motions of your hands if you draw lewd pictures, but think of all the hand movements men and women can do to masturbate. Outlawing all of them would make just about any job involving the use of your hands illegal.<br>They just don't tell you how to do it.</br></br>  <br>He meant in that story. For a story in which any lewd is outlawed, that's a fucking short pair of pants.</br>  <br>the reason someone like her is notable in this fictional world is pretty much due to the reason that said rape would never happen.<br><br>Were lewdness alowed she'd probably be pretty normal</br></br></br>  <br>What's so lewd about shorts anon? Are you going to have to have a talk with Onii-chan?</br>  <br> rape would never happen. <br><br>You underestimate rape.<br>Rape always finds a way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anna is not going down easy, huh. She fell for him too hard, I was hoping she would realize that she didn't actually love him but it seems like she is too infatuated with him to realize that. <br><br>Reminds me of Yui from oregairu, she is infatuated with the MC and misinterprets it as love.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't you remember how they defined how pregnancy happens?</br>  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87 <br><br>Does The World stop time, or speed it and its user up?</br></br>  <br>I was born in 95 and the CLAMP doujin was released in 94. Big fucking deal.</br>  <br>Depends on who you are and how useful are you.<br>[SPOILER]I'd try to be his 『friend』.[/SPOILER]</br></br>  <br>So you're telling me that Avdol being Joseph's friend and Polnareff being saved twice wasn't shown in the manga?</br>  <br><br><br>Yeah, Kakyoin and Jotaro were too quiet and always doing shit on their own, but the other three were pretty close.<br><br><br>Well, I feel like the manga showed a camaraderie between them? Like I said above, it was Jotaro's autistic ass who never interacted with anyone.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, I meant their relationships weren't shown in the manga.<br><br><br>And Jotaro is the main protagonist. Their camaraderie is shown at the end but most of it is implied.</br></br></br></br>  What went wrong?  Your birth.

I'm only recommending for an average man's workout to stay not-fat. You probably know your body well enough to balance your own diet and exercise, but I would recommend doing 1.5-2 hours per day (not all in one go). Maybe take a break from the anime and the computer screen to digest the episode while you run. Get to reflect and think while you exercise. <br>Also remember your pushups. those are easy to remember. Just do it before every meal. three sets of six. so do 6 pushups, wait 15 seconds, do 6 more, wait 15 seconds, and then do another 6, then eat.</br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw watching this entire thing </br>    <br>The nose bridges are similar in structure if not downright the same.

In reality this isn't a hikkineet pandering show, it shows that you can have fun slacking off once you're done with your duties and have a happy life. Look at Umaru, she could be anxious and obsessed with her peers and with school but instead she just doesn't give a shit, pays attention during class, studies before exams as a result does well and just thinks about video games and snacks.</br>  <br>I need the sauce of that.</br>  So anons, who preordered the hoodie?  <br>I was thinking of getting one, but I'm a man and i'm not sure how a hamster shawl would look on a male.</br>  <br>who cares, noone else will see you, I wouldn't buy one because hell whats the fucking point but if all you're worried about is what people might think, then noone will think anything</br>  <br>I want one but I am poor as fuck right now and don't know how much it costs</br>  <br>Looks like they're about 5000. I kind of want one too.</br>  <br>What's interesting is this is more or less the exact same message of Evangelion. 90s NEETs didn't have it so badly they actually needed to withdraw from the world. They can find some way to participate in a minimal way, or even if they're lucky in a real and satifying way, and still enjoy their hobbies and not have their identity subsumed into the monoculture, or whatever. I guess it's not surprising exactly that the same message has to be repeated again and again to each new generation of otaku though.</br>  <br>Nice blog where's the titter button I want to follow your every update.<br>:^)</br></br>  <br>Absolutely nothing.</br>  <br>Can someone shoop out her arm so she looks like a cute little blob?</br>  <br>;^)</br>  <br>You claim to filter yet you reply.<br>Nice going champ.</br></br>  <br> Kyoani mousepad <br>superb taste, anon</br></br>  <br> No octopus sucker snack <br> No hamster hood <br><br>1/10 that photo is shit</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying you aren't just jello of my white lolita cookies </br>  <br>And it's drawn by a nip woman.</br>  <br>Do japs measure in liters?<br><br>It was my understanding that americans did everything assbackwards <br>This is coming from an american too</br></br></br></br>  <br>That has to be at least $100 in junk food.</br>  <br>Well it's really easy to get sick of the world and just hide away with things you like.

It's the same weight as a kilogram. Milliliters are also the same weight as grams. Everything is connected in the metro system.</br>  <br>BULLY? IN MAI COMEDY ANIMU!!!</br>  <br> metro system </br>  <br>it's called liter here, and in a lot of places, no it's not, 1l of clean water is 1 kg but 1l of anything with different density is different, liter is a volume system you dumbass, and more than anything it just supposed to express volume of liquids as opposed to volume of anything including gas and solid things</br>  <br> [kdfss]  <br><br>Literally who?</br></br></br>  <br>Better than horrible, that's who.</br>  Ebina smells like shit  <br> implying liter is an incorrect spelling <br> metro system <br>Typical bonglander.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. I don't expect you to understand. You're a dumb Yankee, after all. That doesn't mean you can't be taught to regurgitate bullshit, though. How many times have you been made to spit out the names of all 50 US states, I wonder?<br><br>Here's a fun fact for you. 1m cubed = 1000L of water.</br></br></br>  <br> the oppai mousepad <br>im only now noticing it in here.</br></br>  <br>This is a troll right? You're taught the difference between weight and volume in your country, right?</br>  <br>not even american though, you're just talking straight bullshit<br> of water <br>yeah, that's the point, ever heard of density? just saying but I've spent a lot of my time in chemistry/biology labs and if I measured every liquid as if it was 1l/1kg then I would've been kicked out on the first day<br>you know, drink are mostly made of water so it's more or less the same as in kgs but from a proper scientific pov 1l is not necessarily 1kg</br></br></br></br>  <br>Vitamin D deficiency ;^)<br><br><br>I was in a locker room once and some guys were joking around weighing themselves before and after peeing.<br><br>They said, "lol I don't know how much water weighs" and I gave them a dirty look. They probably thought it was about their piss game, but really it was about their piss ignorance.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>1m really does equal 1000L. That equals 1000kg, which equals 1 ton. Do you understand density and volume, Mr. Cowboy?</br>  <br>Especially since she's only had like 4-5 minor roles before this.</br>  <br>moe anime moe problems</br>  <br>1m3 does, only with water, again density gb2schoolpls</br>  <br> 1m really does equal 1000L </br>  <br>I don't think the difference in density between water and piss is really great enough to matter in this context.</br>  I want to bully Umaru.  <br>probably, I didn't say anything about your piss contest though, but in labs I have to measure dense ethanol, sulfuric acid, acetic acid etc. and those aren't the same density as water, which he seems to not understand</br>  <br>Ebina, simply Ebina.</br>  when you nut but she still going  <br>Yeah holy bet she thinks people are giving her rapestares when they're just staring at her fugly jewnose. Also standing with a sign that says "don't look at me" how fucking retarded woman can get.</br>    If you reveal this spoiler, it unleashes a curse of being unsure upon you! You will never quite know what your purpose in this world is or if there really is purpose in anything at all unless you post "i'm here for the memes" in this thread.    <br>Joke's on you, I have no purpose in this world.</br>    <br>I opened the picture before I read the text. <br>Am I still screwed?</br></br>  <br>[red]Courses don't exist.[/red]<br><br>Jokes on you.</br></br></br>  <br> 3 sets of 6 pushups <br><br>What kind of fucking pussy do you think I am? No less than 10 pushups in one set faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>I do ~80 pushups in one set but running for one hour? Fuck I'd rather kill myself.</br>  <br>Running is really fucking boring unless you happen to have nice scenery.</br>  <br>The scenery is okay around here, sometimes I go to run along the river but 1 hour twice a day heeeell no. I can just do pushups while watching tele and it only takes a couple of minutes also I'd have to take a shower, get clean clothes and shit if I go out, way too much hassle.</br>  <br>I used to run a hour each day, but i've gotten real lazy and it's gotten real hot. I hate running so much.</br>  Bill Murray dub when?  <br>Yeh running is torture, I love swimming but then again it's so much fucking hassle. I just want to stay inside all day and shower maybe once a week.</br>  I can't tell if it's cute or kinda sad. If anything I want to get her out more.  <br>Her shitty brother enabled her bad lifestyle and now she's a drain on society and on himself in general.</br>  Why does the guy coddle her so much? He should just let her live in her own filth and make her own meals. She can obviously do it since she's a Mary Sue and perfect in every way.  <br>What drain, she's performing perfectly well and is living in a one room apartment with her brother. Compared to Ebina whose parents are renting her an apartment and still performs as shit she's an example citizen. Most likely when she's finished school she's gonna be an asset to society, being a normie who doesn't amount to shit is not better than being a nerd who performs well.</br>  <br>You fool! The curse is already affecting you</br>  <br>Because he loves his precious imouto.</br>  <br>ayyy</br>  <br>5000 yen + shipping and you don't have to pay until like mid October when it comes out.<br><br><br>It's not like you will go out in it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> lusting after your best friend brother </br>  <br>better than lusting your own brother</br>  <br>why, that's a perfectly healthy relationship</br>  <br> Teiki <br>Kill yourself, cancer.</br></br>  Umaru on the front page!  anyone else feel like fucking their own sister after watching this?<br> that episode when she climbs in bed and sleeps next to him <br> implying I'm not going to cuddle her from behind while giving her small humps as she rest </br></br>  <br> tfw no sister. </br>  <br> bad lifestyle <br><br>She does extremely well at school and spends her free time how she wants to, nothing wrong with that. It's not like her at-home habits negatively impact any other part of her life, at most it killed her out-of-school social life.</br></br></br>  <br>it's not like other characters have out of school social lives, and she hangs out with ebina, kirie later sylphine too and goes out shopping and eating with her brother, that's plenty social life</br>  <br>Nothing. I'm pretty sure most people assumed the show would not actually be good so the fact that it isn't is no surprise.</br>    <br>FUCKING SECONDARIES <br><br>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</br></br></br>  <br> not lusting your own brother </br>  <br>I can't judge since I've only watched the first episode so far, but I do feel cheated in a way. I wish she didn't turn chibi and we could see what she would look like normally doing those things. I think it would be a lot better that way.</br>  <br>it wouldn't be as cute.</br>  How can I truly embrace my NEET life?

I remember the first season threads being a lot more fun.  I wish I had a house like this, it looks super comfy.    Kaede. ;_;<br><br>Also, what the fuck is it with country towns and lolly stores? Went to a town for some scones and there was store solely dedicated to lollies in a &lt;1000 town. <br><br>How does the business structure remain profitable?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Were NNB threads always shit? <br>Yes.</br></br>    <br>This one is not even so bad yet.</br>  <br>Stock doesn't go off, doesn't need many staff, small town land rates are probably pretty good for this type of thing.

It's not a joke filename. It's just room 101 actually being empty.</br>  <br>I like this meme.</br>  <br>Guess they are saving the trip for the next ova  or season 3 .</br>  This past episode was just perfect. The teru teru bozu arc was absolutely hilarious and the Flatty-san arc was simply beautiful, from its mono no aware to its heartwarming climax illustrating the innocent, youthful realization of the miracle of life. The climax in particular, the way it was directed with the music and the interspersed shots of nature and the cycle of life... just fucking stunning. Why is this so AOTY?  <br>This episode demonstrated the transient beauty of life in a way I haven't seen since YKK.</br>  <br>Terrible.</br>  <br>I will always remember this scene as the exact moment she became my waifu.</br>  <br>Didn't you see her sniffle and wipe her eyes?</br>  Is there going to be a season 3?   Next episode will be an anime original featuring school pool <br><br>Besides being surprised that the school actually has one, does this mean we will see Hotaru in a school swimsuit  and more Koma-chan misery? </br></br>  <br>I sure hope so. I'm just about ready to move this show into the 1a/1b slot of GOAT SoLs along with ARIA. One more episode this season the quality of S1E04, S1E10 or S2E04 and that should do it.</br>  why isn't Komari wearing her sukumizu?  <br>They appeared fully clothed, not even in swimsuits, while in the pool in the preview.<br> Thank God. The last thing we need is these threads next week circlejerking over middle and elementary schoolers in swimsuits. </br></br>  <br>Since you seem to favour the Renge episodes, what did you think of the OVA? I thought that was around the same level of quality and high amount of Renge-focused introspection.</br>  <br>This hitted me hard, since my dog is sick and getting surgery tomorrow.</br>  <br><br>Well, we technically had that when S1 aired didn't it?</br></br>  <br> S1E10 <br>That episode was magical.</br></br>  <br>I have no mouth and I must scream.</br>  <br>I love every NNB episode and loved the OVA but I'm not sure the OVA lives up to those three episodes I mentioned. I may be biased because the OVA was &lt;720p. <br>I feel that Renge is the show's most unique, entertaining character by a good margin. I don't think those episodes are the best episodes because they're Renge episodes, though. I think it's more that the writing and directing of this show really seem to excel when they're focusing on heartwarming moments and they seem to focus these heartwarming moments around Renge.</br></br>  <br>only if they cry from below.</br>  <br>Good answer. I guess you can't just say all the episodes are great but I agree with what you're saying. I personally find the Natsumi/Komari sisterhood moments to be some of the best heartwarming stuff too, but it might also be a personal bias owing to it reminds me of how me and my sister were as kids. But just the understated thoughtful moments are the best, like when they run away and Natsumi sees that a cat stole food from them to feed her kittens, and that's what finally makes her think "we should go home."<br><br>I hope for more Natsumi/Komari stuff this season, at least one or two episodes.</br></br></br>  Best girl. She'll become a great mother and wife.  <br> She'll become a great mother <br>Will probably need C-section.</br></br>  <br><br>That's not Koma-chan</br></br>  <br> giving birth to children is only something 7 feet tall giantesses can do <br><br>No, anon. No.</br></br></br>  Holy FUCK this show looks depressing. I've never watched this but is this the show's selling point?  <br>Komari is the one who needs a C-section and a 7th-month delivery, Natsumi will be fine.</br>  <br>People will claim otherwise but all the depressing episodes are also the most popular ones.</br>  <br>What a depressing edit.</br>  <br>She was always best girl. If you rewatch S1 and pay attention you will notice that Natsumi is usually very aware of social situations and the feelings of the people around her and acts accordingly. More often than any other character she does small things and gestures that makes others feel good about themselves and have fun. This episode was just the most obvious example.</br>  <br>This post contain so much truth</br>  <br> entire anime original episode <br><br>Does the school really have a pool in the manga?</br></br></br>  <br> the temptation of the shovel <br>She's so used to digging graves for Vietnamese children that it's become a reflex.</br></br>  <br> crop her shop her <br>CROP HER SHOP HER DROP HER TOP HER BOP HER COP HER MOP HER HOP HER</br></br>  <br>Give me templates.</br>  Who is this guy???  <br>Ace Ventura.</br>  <br>Judging by his state of dress and shiftiness.<br><br>Tsuchimikado Motoharu</br></br></br>  <br>kaiki deishuu<br>monogatari</br></br>  <br>Ace ventura is too fucking hot</br>  An overrated character from a shit show.<br>/thread</br>  <br>this spoonfeeding. kill yourself</br>  Me.<br>Intelligent, nihilistic and with a wicked sense of humor.</br>  <br> putting /thread in your own post </br>  It's not a guy OP, It's  A digitally drawn character   <br>Yes da</br>  <br>Leave him be, anon.

Just put the turkey in a hot oven.</br>  <br>Solid objects can excrete liquids</br>  Is best girl going to be in Super?  <br> not sure, if you're interested, but DBO Main timeline Trunks opens up a sword school with Goten. <br><br>Oh, now this quite intesting and refreshing, swordmanship.<br><br> There is no word about his personality, though <br><br>A shame.<br><br>Personally, I like to believe he's a bit of a smartass, sometimes making jerkish remarks, (but can still get owned depending of the situation, like when Vegeta threatened to cut his allowance, or when he ended up selectes to fight the village people guy) but not an asshole.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I still don't like how they changed Future Trunks' design to regular Trunks. Regular Trunks is the better character, yes, but without the badass attitude there's no point to Future Trunks at all.</br>  <br>what?! No!!! She was supposed to be with me!</br>  <br>Why the heck you make no multiplier at all when goku jumped from SSG to SSGSS. He should be at least jumped 5 or 10 time and far surpassing beerus. I have not heard that SS multiplier is that very low.</br>  <br>because we have literally no idea what SSGSS actually is, it might be just SSJ on top of full power SSG powers or it might be just an alternate way to access SSGSS powers<br>also Freeza's power jump is pretty impressive for 4 months<br>it's all speculation though</br></br></br>  Left, middle, or right?  <br><br><br>Why do I even try to apply logic with megumifags when most of them are not old enough to know what a rhetorical argument is. <br>I should know better than to deal with megumifags</br></br></br></br>  <br> ad hominem and shitposting <br>You sure showed us.</br></br>    <br>What are you going to do? Cry about Megumifags in every thread like the autismal shitposter you are because you can't handle the heat?<br><br>Sasuga Eririfags.</br></br></br>  <br>missing best girl.</br>   Underage sex <br> necrophilia <br> Destruction of public propert <br> kidnapping <br> incest <br><br>How does the defendant plea?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cougars anything but the finest meat for punding <br>how about you stop and go in the corner</br></br>  <br>all mums are cum dumpsters, except for mum of jesus.</br>  <br>She was the cum dumpster for a deity ayy lmao</br>  <br> all mums are cum dumpsters <br>While this is literally true, the term cum dumpster refers to sluts and whores or girls who enjoy bukkake. That does not apply to most mums.</br></br>  <br> A ghost (technically 17-18 as well) <br> An iimmortal vamp <br> An 18 year old corpse </br></br></br>  God fucking bless Japan  <br> Ending Scene <br>I can manage. Pretty much the only scene I masturbated to in that Eroge! episode</br></br>  Just watched. It's shit.  GROSS  What the fuck? Are they Siamese twins or something? Or is this just QUALITY?  Where i can discuss mom son hentai without getting bullied?  ITT: Characters that ruined their shows    <br>You mean, like Railgun?<br><br>It was better than Index.<br><br>Touma is the epitome of Gary Stu self insert, only Kira and Kirito are worse.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>He and Kurugaya were the best thing about Little Busters. Then again I didn't watch the show so maybe they did ruin him.</br>  <br> Sisters <br> Daihaseisai <br> implying he's not still the real main character </br></br></br></blockquote>]
