[   Who still gives a fuck about this?     I do, because I find it funny.    I do, so?      it was annoying when i was a kid and funny as an adult      Does he just carry around little paper sacks in case he needs to rip someone's heart out?    I always assumed the clothe was part of the guy's shirt, it's the same color      I'm more bothered by the fact that we still don't have a proper, uncensored release of the Dragon Ball manga in English.         100 times better than black bar/fog censoring that is becoming popular.       I don't understand what is being censored     stop or i'll activate the spring to bonk him on the head    Where's the Zabuza on the floating handle. Come on guys.      at least it made sense. a chef shouldn't fucking smoke. Thats probably the least horrible censor that 4kids did.    Show me one canon scene in which Sanji has smoked while cooking.     Show me at least 20 scenes where he hasn't.     i mean in the sense that it ruins your taste buds.    Terraformars was shit, and that scene made me drop the manga completely because I realized what kind of series it was: lets job every fucking character to the nhojs to hype them up then run out of ideas.   that racist    The entirety of Tokyo Ghoul TV or Netflix.   kek    This can't be real...     It's funny because neither version is realistic.      I don't really mind her censorship. It only looks ridiculous in frames like this, and she's already an adorable busty fetish magnet even without the cleavage. I bet boys are discovering their weewees even with the edit.    Yeah, FT's manga is better, but I prefer other reasons...     It looked more violent when it was in the sac imo    Every Time There is always one who sees it and doesn't believe it.     why   I never understood why this happened, but Mammy is still on Tom and Jerry reruns.  People would be questioning a jelly donut that size, so they had to change it.     Aprons are racist because slavery.    This can be real    Is that QCDJ remix out yet?    I can believe it.     Believe it     Wasn't this during the 4kids run?   4kids ruined a lot of anime back when they were still around, it was almost impressive. What the fuck were they thinking?      BELIEVE IT    Considering she was actually redesigned in B2/W2, I wouldn't be surprised if the character designer didn't realize it was a racist caricature until the games released, and then voluntarily changed it.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=K5U<wbr>fIRmkv28</wbr>  [ ]     I dont even understand why.    The heart is actually surrounded by a membrane which partitions it off from the rest of the human body. Most organs have it. I like to think Togashi knows a bit of anatomy and the bag is that membrane.    Him having the sac made no sense, the heart still beating in it and him putting it in the mans hands was fucking great    I remember the scene where he threatens some guy by pointing the sword at him, and in the German version he's just pointing the handle at him.  But how the hell did they deal with the sword being thrown into the tree in the first place?      Money.    Looks less like a cross i think. That's the best i can come up with.       Same reason they censored luffy's mouth     I get it, they went with the idea   we can censor it if we say its a see through water blade.          The idea's fine Though they completely screwed up the times         OH MY GOD I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THAT THEY FUCKING CENSORED LUFFY'S MOUTH BEING OPEN     When you start getting edits like this, it's proof that the censors have run out of actual things to censor and are just trying to fill up their 8-hour work day at this point.     I'm sorry, what?        The idea's fine  Explain it to me       Yes, now what did it look like then he threw the sword and it lodged itself in the tree?    why did they change it?      What the everlasting fuck?  WHY?      They changed Japan's 24-hour clock to the US 12-hour one. That honestly isn't so bad if you consider that American kids may not understand how Japanese clocks work.  But they screwed it up in that 19:00 should be around 8 pm.     Why? For what purpose?       French chefs smoke all the time. Sanji's supposed to be "french"      8   I meant 7, fuck     Oh god Yu-gi-oh replacing all the guns with pointing fingers was hilarious.     There are people here who don't realize that the sack came from the guy's shirt when Killua tore his arm through his chest        Japanese clocks  I live in Mexico and I always used a 24h format     My sides    That's just cruel. What if he needs to poop?  Also, speaking of cruel...       I wish someone would create a series of videos showing both the original version with subtitles but no sound and the censored localized version with audio at the same time for things like Yugi-Oh. It'd be great to compare episodes with everything side by side like that.     It's because 4kids also brings their shows to other countries. Rather than translate for every language, they just remove the text to make things easier.    Well, I just used 'japanese' because that's what the original's from. A lot of other countries use it too. But the US doesn't, so the change is necessary.        Huh, making the cigerrette look like a lollipop, thats kind of clever. Stupid and not necessary, but clever.    WHY    I thought everyone in Yu-Gi-Oh just had a spirit gun when they pointed their fingers    I... I don't get it. Why?     it's called military time or 24 hour clock   so the change is necessary   no it's not         what what why?    What was the point of that ?    why?    My god, that blue color is an eyesore.    Jews    Maybe not necessary, but it's helpful for young children. Which is the main audience.  And yes, I know what it's called.     I think most of the confusion comes from the size of the piece of cloth, given that it's big enough to hold his heart completely. Sure, some of the surrounding cloth was clearly pushed into the cavity, but it still seems a little small.   Left is original   It's not necessary, in school when they teach you how to read a clock they teach you both ways    Weren't they even called contests in that generation's games?     The fuck     I refuse to believe this is real.      They didn't teach it at my school. Then again I grew up in some country town in the middle of nowhere.     ellipses are ominous, I don't blame them    That's it...they got ran out of stuff to censor and got bored. It's the only explanation...    The former happened in the initial Japanese broadcast. The latter was changed by Japan for international and Japanese DVD releases.    Do pokeballs trigger people now? I don't get it.    The only thing I can think of with shit like this is that they weren't just censoring or localizing, they were making it full-on completely generic. Completely stripping the show of as much identity as possible so no one could possibly be offended by anything. No language, no logos, nothing.    I don't see any difference      Whats this from, some mudslime country?    Pokeball -&gt; clam -&gt; vagina -&gt; some devillish stuff. That's the way censors brains work    no wonder why i hesitated to pick up this series when it first aired    For what fucking purpose?    If I remember right, he jumps onto Pegasus' platform and demands that he give him the prize money right there.  Even as a kid, I remember thinking that scene was weird as shit. He didn't have anything to threaten him with.      My guess is that it have something to do with advertising laws. Yu-Gi-Oh can't have the back of the cards like real life because for some reason you can't advert real products in your japanese cartoons without paying royalties.     Honestly, I think the jelly donut thing was a genuine mistake. They really didn't have much to work with back then, so it was all translated up front. So they see what ends up being a rice ball, but it's filled with what looks like raspberry jelly or something, with what might be coconut shavings on the outside.   4kids comes up a lot in these threads but their edition of Zorc was on another level.  There are parts where the edit is so shitty his torso is just an indistinct dark haze with a dragon poking out     same here I was always thinking wtf was he going to do with that finger.    What, are there like licensing issues with pokeballs?  Were they worried that featuring their stylised likeness in anyway apart from actual pokeballs would contravene some condition about advertising in the show?  That I could kinda see, the networks not wanting to have the stigma of it being a full-on merchandise advertisement, so they have to cut out/edit stuff that could be construed as merchandise - change the logo and 'branded pen' becomes 'generic pen' and everything's fine.       to be honest that just looked like a huge dragon dick.    So far this is the only "done right", that is just a dragon strap on      That's pretty obviously why they did it.  It doesn't change how retarded it looks.      no he's from Boston   what about this?     This is about direct censorship, not people trying to cover their asses legally.    I'm amazed Konami even did that for Elemental Recharge.    Did they... remove her breasts?      I'll give you a hint: what's black and white and actually large enough to split between the four of them?    She wasn't supposed to look pretty in that.   In any case anime fucked up      My dick?      Wasn't this because his smaller self drank beer, but they made it orange along with him so it'd be like his thing?    Hher name in my country means "Blowjob"    No, but it is jelly-filled.    Arc-V is going to looks like shit if this happens.     And then run out of ideas   The anime was shit. However, if you're not at least keeping up with it, you're missing out.      For fucks sake Did display;none drop it or what?     Nah, Next volume release from them soon. Should catch up to just around that image before we have to wait on 14 to release in Japan.     Roaches in nice suits  Player Haters. Middle roach is Silky Johnson, Buck Nasty in the back.       DON'T CHEW WITH YOUR MOUTH OPEN KIDS      Are laser guns somehow less offensive than actual guns? Unless they're all playing a rousing game of laser tag it would kill all the same.     No bullets, no blood.     I'm thinking that's the only logical reason, but they got the rights to dub the show and there are TONS of Pokeballs in it.     To be fair, a single saltine is a lot more pathetic to be down to than a whole onigiri ball.      and that name is?    in america every family has loaded handguns in every draw. if you show characters shooting each other kids will imitate with the handgun their mother got them for christmas     The fuck am I looking at?    95% of chefs smoke like chimneys. The other 5% do coke off the prep tables where they make your food.     real footage of Robert Johnson and Son House        Tearju molestation sequence in TLR Darkness     What is this even supposed to be?    It's not.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kDy<wbr>B91YRRCQ</wbr>  [ ] 15:10       Honestly it was just a localization. In the US we count times 1-12, am or pm. We don't usually do 13:00 or higher to denote time.      WOW IT'S FUCKING NOTHING   LASER  CHAINSAW      Five Nights at Freddy's     HOW CAN I HELP YOU KING DEDEDE? I NEED A LASER CHAINSAW TO ????? THAT THERE KIRBY.     Americans are retarded  More news at 11     We had one gun in my house and my dad was pretty serious about it. I never actually saw him use it even once, he kept the gun and ammo in separate locations, and I didn't even know where the shit was. So no, all american parents aren't retarded white trash who take pictures of their babies holding guns and put them on facebook.    Man, it was awkward as fuck when suddenly all the laser guns turned into real guns and there was blood everywhere.  Those last ~5 episodes of the run were a trip and a half.      Picking this back up now    Who knows. There were a ton of action cartoons in the 90s where everyone had lasers and blasters. It blew my mind when I learned that ki effects in the Ocean dub of DBZ had laser sound effects.    your house still had a gun in it and i bet if you cared enough you could have found and loaded it how many pakistani houses have police grade batons in them do you think     I guess it was  too edgy for them     go home carlos you're drunk    Wow... they really had to get creative.    Yeah. They were doing that in the 90s, early 2000s.  Now consider that they're still incapable of doing typesetting in 2015.      Urmum        ... for nothing why     What's that blue bar?    I remember when the show debuted on toonami and in the ED which was random screenshots next to the credits, there was a shot of her with her uncensored tits. And then in the next episode her rack got cut off. Made me realized censors existed.    Covering the tip of tue penis    Toonami   not exactly a censor, but...  When Pikachu is repeatedly shocking Ash to try to bring him back to life, Misty says "Pikachu…" in the Japanese version, and "Please, no…" in the English version. A commentary revealed that the dubbers had many alternatives for this piece of dialogue, one of them being "My bike…"     The only time Gundam Seed was entertaining.      a spring loaded hammer with force behind it to fire a bullet isn't more dangerous than a Pirate era gun  the Hammer will probably crack open their head       "My bike..."  Holy shit if they used that instead I would have still cried during that scene  from laughing of course  yes I cried a bit during that scene I'll admit it        art    has art gone too far?    Why?    Some dubs like to change the name of the characters    That's because Togashi can't draw for shit.    the single saltine cracker is so much better for the comedy      They improved her.     Five Nights at freddy's   Initial release date: August 8, 2014   Death-Toy's appear in the Arc-V Anime   May 11, 2014        Everyone did. No need to be ashamed.    He just made a comparison to the recent teasers, jeez     Latest Five Nights at Freddys teaser   June 25, 2015   Death-Toy's appear in the Arc-V Anime   May 11, 2014        I didn't. Not even trying to sound edgy, I was just really fucking confused. Why did Ash think it was a good idea to run inbetween the beams?   Why did he turn to stone?      Again, just a comparison. Nobody said they were connected.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127192293  This isn't real right?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127192293  where do i find the uncensored version   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127192293  dick, but no nipple     I still think it's a good idea   He make his lollipops every day.       Hey fuck you, buddy. That theme song was amazing.    What are you a puff?    Fucking dying    Fucking this, man Delicious flatchest &gt; Disgusting cowtits      Why has no one answered  Why was luffys mouth editededed       That doesn't make any sense considering they'd have to pay an homeless guy from the street to photoshop all the shit away.    putting the heart on that nigga´s hand is fucking brutal     4kids turns cigarettes into lollipops and other faggotry    "100 times better than 'please buy the BD's' broadcast censorship"  Dumbest thing I've read all week.      Naruto actually got cut so it'll run on german TV - but they didn't just cut out like alot, the dub is horrible. For example no character will use the word "kill" - they use "I want/need to beat him" instead. Bad words like "dumbass" or "son of a bitch" got replaced with "bad person" or something like that.  It's for the kids man.        That's not even the worse thing that happened. In an episode, she turned into the girl in the pink dress and had giant tits, this was NOT censored in the dub, so I have no idea what the hell was going on.       http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>6r3p4_yugioh-every-pegasus-desu_tec<wbr>h Japanese Pegasus is the gayest thing ever </wbr></wbr>       It's a mystery to everyone.     You know, this change would have at least made sense if they played up Devil Fruit user's weakness to water.  Which would have been the least problematic plot hole they'd dig.       This is why you should just wait for the Blu-Ray release   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127192293  I think for elevens seeing a little boy dick isn't a big deal, it's like seeing a naked baby.    Oh God, I remember when the episode aired, and everyone was just lost.   We're taking away this little girls tits   But it's totally fine if she transforms into the other little girl, and has gigantic tits.        At least the BDs actually are uncensored. 4kids only released cut versions.    That did seem off to me at the time. I never knew. Same thing when Gin cut Hiyori in half.     Are there even rips of the 4kids censored versions?     Post the Erza torture scene comparison.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127192293  Baleeted lol   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127192293  Help! What's in this?!    bomb one is best   Hey there. Dumping a dead scanlation. Chapters are usually 8 pages long. The raws look terrible, so I'd be willing to scan this, if anyone wants to work on it.  Previous works include Genocyber. Tony Takezaki's Evangelion parody anthology was recently published by Dark Horse. Aside from that, he also has a comedic Gundam anthology that's a few volumes long.   The hero is Dr. Kishiwada, a brilliant but demented scientist, who creates bizarre mechas, battles the forces of evil, or just mucks about. There are many parodies of B-grade sci-fi movies and of TV. Crazy, slick, and very funny.                                                                                           Jesus Christ, how terrifying.            The more you know.        these are great                What happened to Mo-tan to become so tiny? Did she only manage to reincarnate partially?  Is she not part of the zodiac anymore then?     Why the fuck would she be traveling around the world with Nya-tan in the first place, doesn't she have the whole Tokai region to protect?   inb4 it turns out there WAS somebody that missed Rat's radar and won all the Eto-seals in the last moment to become an Eto-shin.    Hooray Paca-tan          Her soul got ripped out and shattered. Give her SOME time to heal    she's on sick leave   what I want to know is Pretty Mode tiny in general or is Mo-tan just like that because of the aforementioned soul ripping          Rabbit? More like RabBest.   Well there's the manga.  Which deviates so much from the anime that it is practically a different story just with characters that look the same    You're early today      I, for one, welcome our new CG overlord.    well that is smaller but hardly pocket sized    Taiga is toradorable!

I miss the days when I wouldn't have to see any fateshit outside of power level threads. Fatefags were much more tame in those days   "You'll never be able to do it. You'll NEVER be able to do it. Never ever. Never ever. NEVER EVER!" "I'm gonna do it." "HE DID IT!"  It's a very basic writing thing, dude. You see it constantly in anime and manga.        I know that, but it's something I'd expect to see in a battle shounen, or even in fucking Fairy Tail, but it's not something I'd expect in the Fate universe. The whole point of Fate is well established established in-universe laws, so when those laws are broken you can't take it seriously.   I miss the days where we could actually just have fun talking about fate but nowadays everyone wants to get completely fucking butthurt over everything. Nobody can just accept an explanation.  OR JUST READ THE VN.  Saged for blogshit but hey, these faggots probably don't even know what sage is anyway.      Those laws were established in that initial story in the first place. Like, it might seem weird if you started with something else, like Zero, or Extra, where servants are seen on a whole different level, but to me I didn't see it as particularly egregious when first reading it.  You also have to think of the themes of the novel. It's a story about heroes, with an MC who's trying to get on the level of those heroes, you'd figure he'd fight a few at some point.     How many of you /a/nons are going to Anime Expo? If you're thinking about going  JUST DO IT   Why would I go if I hate anime?

Thanks for reading my blog.            I actually bought a ticket for the UBW concert.     Whore yourself   Last time I went to a con I had like 8000 fat ugly neckbeards following me for my boypussy. Never again.   Where do I subscribe?    I've only been to one and had fun buying fanmade posters and random small merchandise like mystery box nendos.       going to a convention   going to an anime convention     I went to one back when I had no powerlevel and all I remember were whores begging for attention to feel good about themselves, there were no bad smells.     mystery box nendos.  I tried that once. It was $25 and full of Naruto shit. Pretty sure I'm not doing it again.      I already waste buttloads of money just going to Comiket every year. Fuck going to a shit murrikan anime con.   But my waifu's VA isn't an american VA.   tfw told boss when i got hired i need those days off tfw had to fight with him and only managed to get friday and saturday off tfw wanted thursday off for concert (not at ax but a toe concert in la) and to get my premiere badge tfw cashier life is miserable       he actually thinks that /a/ shitposters go outside  You're a moron.    How is it anon?    I didn't say she was anon. Just surprised me how many american VAs they had  Lurk more      You have to do it anon, is for you waifu!   I found out hookers cost less than travel, hotels, costumes and ticket entry to bang girls with daddy issues.   Explain this image    Horrible much like every year.  Payoff is fantastic though.     You should come to top level asian conventions.    autists have their containment corners   shit gets up to 50% off on last 2-3 hours   /cgl/ scene is 20 shit / 80 eyecandies   tolerable to excellent taste           fucking 3D  Why are you here? You should never cheat on you're waifu     Labeef made a motivational video of him saying JUST DO IT over and over again. That scene in EVA is a single frame for like 3 minutes.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nuH<wbr>fVn_cfHU</wbr>  [ ]      it's not sabershit is it?      ticket entry to bang girls with daddy issues.  So it's the same in the West? I thought it's only a thing in Asia.     It would be good if he didn't went full fit with the squats and shit    Nobody wants to talk to you anymore. They're all afraid of catching your cancer.    I kind of like this guy. Maybe it's because he doesn't seem to care and is probably autistic.    They are whores son, who in their right mind would get semi naked for nerds    The squat is the reason why it became a meme.    I cant take him as a serious actor when he played the spazy kid in a tv show called Even Stevens.    Well there is more cucking involved in the west since since guys like showing off their girlfriends here. I know this one girl who has different black and asian guys in most of her pictures with her boyfriend taking the pics.    expected to draw 100,000 attendees between July 2-5, breaking past attendance records   This expo has become nearly as big as San Diego Comicon.  http://www.la.com/celebrity-gossip/<wbr>ci_28366870/anime-expo-spend-next-5<wbr>-years-at-los?source=rss</wbr></wbr>      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127196292  Why did the whales feel the need to do that?   I went last year. Most of it were booths selling shitty fanart and panels for the dub VAs. I don't know what I expected, but it wasn't worth it.  and I got my ticket for free too.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127196292  WAIT, I KNOW THAT EXCITED REDDITOR!   Yeah I go to have fun and hang out with friends Never really buy much though but like to browse and see what's going on     JUST DO IT       I thought he was decent in Lawless. He has good scene presence I think, maybe he just has to find the right director to work with.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127196292  Man that asian guy is trying so hard to not be associated. Sunglasses, coffee, hes got it all.    See<br/>   I miss Anaheim hotels were closer.   this triggers me    Speaking of which aren't they showing some little witch academia 2 stuff their?    post pics     Nope       I'm not even American.      Do you love freedom?      Yes, my childhood dream was joining the marines    Then you're an American    thats not you and thats a real girl  try again nerd       girl   hahahaha       implying that is Rose's arm   Also any idea whether it's written "Rose's" or "Roses' " ?     I already went to one this year. I mostly visited the dealer's room and avoided the rest. Horrible.  People that loudly broadcast that they enjoy this hobby frustrate and embarrass me.    I'd go but I'm saving my money for  EVO    Which one?    Nice. Fuel economy on those must be good, right?   http://animeexpo2015.sched.org/even<wbr>t/69915237947dd320b501b94f270bafbc?<wbr>iframe=no&amp;w=&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no#.VY0<wbr>G5kbl-7S   implying current /a/ is old enough to know who Mark is   </wbr></wbr></wbr>   This one.   So I hear.       going to EVO   What games you play, bitch?      REAGUE OF REGENDS    Please no.   Cons are shit though. What's the point? Any important news that will get announced there will be immediately announced in /a/ by some fag anyway.    Oh hi Mark     Xrd and USF4, I'm decent at both.  I'll probably enter a few side tournaments for shits and giggles.     stay strong anon; i'm sorry for your situation   Nah, I'm going to Comiket. Cosplay sluts over there are more in character. Also, dressing as Buccellati can get you quite the attention.   remember to cheese it son    Rarely do you ever go for actual anime news. Aside from AX.  You go with your friends to act like jackasses in an anime setting and still manage to look like less of a fool than everyone else there. You can be a terrible drunk and nobody will be the wiser. Also, hotel parties. It's basically the most normalfag event you can do while still remaining in a setting that caters to your frowned upon hobby. Which is why most people on /a/ despise it.      Did you ever find a gio girl and lick her?    What's your Gamertag/PSN/Steam?    I play Zato, I'm always cheesing it.     She offered to fuck after suggesting. I'm not kidding. I don't know what nip girls see in the guys of Vento Auero but I think I understand.     Never went to an anime convention before but I heard last year's Anime Expo was a disaster like the venue can't even handle the amount of people it claims to be able to support and that the weather was absolute shit.  Makes you wonder why don't they actually find a proper location for an anime expo.       How many of you /a/nons are going to Anime Expo?  That depends, how easy is it to con people there?     boku no fuck off    Part 5 is Japan's favorite part But if part 4 does get announced I'm still doing Kira in honor of it at the next con I go to And then it will truly be a beautiful duwang       It may sound like a cop-out but I hardly play online since shitty internet.   PSN: caecilius24    Fuck you        people go to a place that is literally called a con   how easy is it  In this case it's an expo, but you get the point.     Can this thing even sing?   Who cares?   No but she can look cute on stage  If by "sing" you mean slurp some semen.   Anon don't make me horny    Nobody here give a shit about that, we want to impregnate her sexy body.    Speak for yourself, I won't bed a false NEET.    Then will you bed me?     Why are you a faggot?      The most useless idol, she's not even sexy     sexy  She looks like a child anon.      we   Fuck off.      Yes, and?    You wouldn't like me when I'm horny.    Children aren't sexy    And you belong behind bars.   <br/>   She's 17 that's legal in most parts of the world    Yes, I will.  Listen Anon, it's not my fault boys just happen to be cuter than girls.      See<br/>     Shitposting and shit taste shouldn't be allowed, and fags like you - castrated.      would she let me have sex with her for money?   Who cares? She still loves us NEETs and glorifies being one. Anzu is my love.     Who cares if she can suck dick?    You two anons are gonna have to take responsibility RIGHT now! Give me your cocks!      Shitposting and shit taste shouldn't be allowed   If that were the case, all pedos would be permabanned.      Hi mootles    Anzuchang the smelly flesh onahole!     posting quotes from a tripfag from 5 years ago  Who the fuck is that anyway    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127192053  Wish it was out of MY boxers    I can pull yours out of your boxers and rub ours together right now. I'll use our precum as lube as I jerk both our dicks together      who's that?    Who gives a shit about moot? His dick isn't even black.    My dick is and I agree with moot.    Ew nigga thats gay.     He was still young, in time we all become Lolicons.     I want to fuck a sweaty Anzu.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0Di<wbr>k5pmFzD8</wbr>  [ ]   Stop posting pics that obviously aren't moot. That's some retard using his (partial) leaked capcode. If it were moot the entire name section would be red. Shit, I could do that myself if I could find where I saved it. Anyone who takes that post seriously is a fucking newfag.       I want to split her sweaty greasy ass cheeks with my thumbs, then dive in with my face deep, running my tongue deep up in her rectal opening, and lick and suck the feces out of her insides.   PV: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CLc<wbr>pO8S8tvY</wbr>  [ ]  Only eight days left until the first episode.  I need a thread to deal with the unbearable excitement until it airs.   What's Carol's goal? Destroying the moon? Calling the Custodians? Getting rid of the power of song and Symphogears?       Also Hibiki's new boots look pretty fucking sweet. I never liked her weird black G boots.   Maybe reclaiming the relics. In the PV sword doll shows up in England to attack Tsubasa, coin doll goes after Chris, and Carol tries to nuke Hibiki personally.    Hibiki seemed more like she accidentally stumbled into something which made Carol try to remove her as witness.    How many times have you guys watched the new pv?    at least 10 times. That tempo buildup.    I never counted in the first place. I think I've watched it at least twice every hour.     I lost count Nonstop since yesterday     Watched? No idea, but I listened to it a million times.    Too many times. I've also probably listened to it 3x more often than I've seen it. Symphogear is the only show that manages to get me hyped up like this.   Reminder that Maria is not useless. She is directly responsible for:  Revealing FIS to the world and putting gang on the quest to save the world. Exposing the Americans as dirty backstabbing jerks. Taking care of Shirabe and Kirika. Taking the burden of playing Fine so they could get help. Raising the Frontier. Curing Hibiki's space cancer. Giving Hibiki a new Gungnir. Satisfying the fantasies of 7 billion people by stripping both herself and Hibiki nude on life TV Saving the world by activating Arghaitlahm.             I want to  touch her hair and watch her get all flustered.     More than 40.   ONLY 1 WEEK    She's the most beautiful of them, I'd marry her.     1v1 me bitchnigga    That's not Hibiki, Shirabe, Miku or Chris   Autism General   I just realized how tight the spats in that picture are    Sorry, this is not the Naruto thread<br/>     Hibiki  A cute tomboy  Shirabe  A cute loli  Miku  A cute tomboyish wife of a cute tomboy  Chris  The cutest of all  They're all cute, but none of them is beautiful like Maria.             They're all more cute than beautiful though. Maria is the prettiest geah.   OFFICIAL GEAH POWER RANKINGS 1. Tsubasa 2. Bikki 3. Chris 4. Maria 5. Miku 6. Shirabe 7. Kirika 901. Fine             Dolls don't have to have sane facial expressions.    I can't wait to see Mika's fight.      I want to fuck that doll      Dolls don't have holes, anon.    Buy a dutch waifu.    Maria's too old to be wearing these cute girlish clothes.    alot   This Touhou big bad is really cute.   She's young in her heart so it's okay.      Man this fight is gonna look great.     Let's hope it's not like S2 where first half was amazing and then everything started falling apart.  is there a translation for the PV?   http://symphogear.blogspot.de/2015/<wbr>06/new-promotional-video-released.h<wbr>tml Song translation. </wbr></wbr>   I was hype so I drew a derpy Hibiki. Any simple requests so I can waste more time?    I hope we get to see her this smug in the show at some point. There's not enough Smugbiki.    DMJii kissu     find this thread   watch the PV   start downloading the first two seasons  How much time do I have to binge watch them and catch up for the first episode of GX?       T-too complex for me. I already suck at facial expressions.     You've got time. First airing is on July 3rd, I think it was, but subs will probably take a while.    8 days anon. Plenty of time to watch 26 episodes. Keep in mind though that it takes about 4 episodes for the first season to get interesting.      What convinced you? The punching, the explosions, the singing or the concert?    S1 is like Nanoha's, it should pick up after 6 episodes or so. On a rewatch all of it is enjoyable though.    Maria genuflecting. We'd probably get a lot of use out of it this season.     Grand so, plenty of time.   I truly appreciate the concept of punching stuff while singing        L F P  Any ideas?    Welcome to the hype train. Why did it take you so long to discover Symphogear?    Just kinda ignored it when it aired first, I've started to like mahou shoujo a bit more recently though. I always like stuff that's a bit different so I can't wait for S1 to finish downloading, honestly.    You have plenty of time, please enjoy yourself. Just a heads up, it's yuri as all hell on top of the fighting and singing.     Lesbian Fisting Punch    This just gets better and better.      What time of day is it airing? The site lists 27:10 on July 3rd which doesn't make any sense.    24+3.16 h?    27:10 simply means 3 hours and 10 minutes after 24:00, so it's 3:10 July 4th.     he doesn't use a 30 hour clock     So thats ~4:10 PM eastern on thursday right?    Never mind I'm retarded. Its on the friday.     more than half of those weren't even planed  I know it's the joke, but it's still pretty sad when it's all written down like that.     I don't care about the plot, I just want to know if there'll be more training regimes from old kungfu movies while singing hot blooded Cantonese songs.    100% guarantee    I miss that slutty edgy badass geah cape Seriously she had the best design. If only it was similar and black on Hibiki too after she stole it     The prehensile nature of that cape was fantastic.    We could have lost the scarf     slutty   cape  What? Also she only had it because she was afraid of everything and needed something to protect herself with, so Gungnir gave her a cape.  Gungnir is pretty bro.  user seems to hate heels   give her proper boots in the next version   she also seems to prefer to punch things   give her piston and revolver gauntlets    this other user wants to hide from everything   give her a giant awesome cape that can cut and grab things and turn into a tornado                Bikibutt.    Blue is the only doll for me.    Reminder that the blue doll is Miku's reanimated corpse.    I like how Aoi still remembers the lyrics to Eiyuu Eiyuu Koji. https://d.maxfile.ro/uyptxnwngi.mp3<wbr></wbr>     Did someone say HOT BLOODED CANTO SONGS?  https://<span>youtu.be/AiluIsFXxI4  [ ]       Miku's  Uhhh     Care to actually add some substance to your posts?     P   That's a thorn.      Can Miku handle Hibiki's determination to fist?    Sure. You made a fucking mistake and Miku isn't dead you stupid fuck.    What? I know she isn't dead  yet . I think you're the one who has made some kind of mistake.     Every night.    Then why would you even post a picture of a different character?    Oh, you thought I thought Serena was Miku. Yeah, no. Sorry. It was just a way of conveying my thoughts of the idea.      Carol a cute. Too bad about all that edge.  So are we going to get previews of the battle songs or not?   Witch Chino did nothing wrong.    Shooting death lasers at Hibiki seems pretty wrong    Woah    You mean like this? Somehow I think I got it all wrong.  Holy shit this was more difficult than expected. Not only is the pose really hard from any perspective but the side but Maria's gear really doesn't work in anything except a neutral pose without stabbing herself with all the metal parts.       Maria's gear really doesn't work in anything except a neutral pose without stabbing herself with all the metal parts   So she is useless even on design?      Some anon a thread or two back mentioned it meant "that which is forbidden."    The one with her stabbing herself could be funnier.    Not that anon, but it looks great to me.    I actually meant the orz pose. I just googled genuflect and I see where you got the idea. Sorry for not explaining it better. You did a nice job with that pose though!   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tQC<wbr>EVb4r5zE</wbr>  [ ] Reposting from /m/     These both look pretty great, but Bikkie's expression is a bit weird  and her bikkies are too small      what the fuck am i watching?    Looks more like Ryuko   On three days (5-6-7 July), they're going to marathon both S1, G, as well as 2013 Live on Nico. http://www.symphogear-gx.com/specia<wbr>l/special03_niconico.php</wbr>    But I'm in the middle of doing that already.    noice.    is it bad i simply want a scene of genjuro just whooping the every living shit out of either the dolls or magical girl edge-chan?     重大発表もございますのでお見逃しなく！！   Seems they will also have major announcement      The best I can imagine is a new live show, and I would be very please with that.    Can I expect a game or movie?    If they announced a game I'd shit myself.  If Platinum was making it I'd shit myself harder.     I like some of the soundtrack better than some of the songs.  https://d.maxfile.ro/wogufllati.fla<wbr>c https://d.maxfile.ro/fmfmtkejmo.fla<wbr>c</wbr> </wbr>    Hold on to your butts   Platinum don't like moe games, go ask others like Gust or even Koei.    Only if it's their A-team and not their Korra team.   That logo remains the coolest fucking shit.        7:50-8:20    My sides are going to the moon      Same. This is the best one in my opinion. http://picosong.com/YpAn/     It's so fucking good.    More like 80 days because subs where.     S1 is like Nanoha's, it should pick up after 6 episodes or so.  Are you kidding, Sympho is the first time in a while I watched the first 5 episodes of a show glued to my seat.     Same, I loved it from the start. I don't understand why people hate on the first few episodes.     implying   anon it got good when hibiki did dat training montage with genjuro so towards the end of episode 4.      I don't understand why people hate on the first few episodes.  It's because you're not allowed to like anything with a dark tone.     mostly because tsubasa's edge early on was pretty damn thick, i mean, its understandable, but god damn.   I want to fuck Kirika.   Shirabe pls.      How would people react if Hibiki died halfway through and Miku ends up inheriting her Gungnir?      probably mad as hell because hibiki is best girl.    Pretty peeved Unless its some like ghost hibiki lives in Gungnir and they share control of her body when they fight thing mite be cool     KAKU OE KOE TA SAKI NI     HAJIMARU UTA HAJIMARU KODOU     This is so unattractive, why is her underwear shaped like a heart? And her limbs are bent in ways that looked like they'll crack off. Give me  any day.    How would people react if Miku died halfway through and Hibiki'song became the song that destroys the world?     why is her underwear shaped like a heart?  Because it's following the contours of her ass and because it's sexy  And her limbs are bent in ways that looked like they'll crack off  Except that's wrong.       I'd wonder why it took them so long.   http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/genjuro.php Genjuro: "Since the opponents are not the Noise, it should be my turn to fight them!"  The staff knew it.   </wbr>   I'd question why it didn't happen last time she thought Miku was dead.    but her ass looks weird like her cheeks are just barely clinching together since there's so much space inbetween them    Why the fuck are they fighting each other again  I can't wait for the CDs.      Hibiki becomes gungnir-chan?     Fighting each other again   Did you even watch the PV?      That OST That Tsubasa     this is everything i wanted.   I want to get fucked by Tsubasa-senpai's sword.   I want to penetrate Bikki's Rainbow Flower.    Aww yes, there better be an entire episode dedicated to him kungfu fighting the shit out of enemies.    Looks like a senketsu color palette     Google translate   If the other party is not a noise, I will protrude ~Tsu!      I want Genjuro to move fast enough to look like he's flash-stepping while dodging Carol's danmaku shit.   And then he pulls off a SICK ASS HYPER BOMB     http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/shirabe.php  Other than Kiri-chan, I don't want anyone to see my embarrassing parts.  Welp.  </wbr>   What if Genjurou loses badly and gets hurt to show how serious things are?    Yes. In the first half of the PV there are clips of kirika/shirabe fighting and tsubasa/chris.    ...  That's just reused footage from G. Are you stupid or just acting?      GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYY<wbr>YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY! they arn't even trying to hide it anymore. </wbr>    LEWD    I think you misinterpreted the question. Why are they fighting? I'm wondering why they are using those clips. Is it some kind of foreshadowing? are they going to end up fighting again?    I thought it was obvious it was just a "LAST TIME ON SYMPHOGEAR" kind of thing.    Well it's obviously part that + part something else. It came to mind since it seemed to match the music so well.    I'm sure Symphogear is at the limit of how gay a show can be before it's actually considered yuri and tanks in sales.     Why is show using clips from the climax of it's prequel to hype up the sequel?  Holy fucking shit, nigga.     That's obviously part of it, but if you've read anythign i've said i'm merely wondering if this indicates more internal conflict in the 3rd season.    Just fuck/kiss/hand-hold aggressively already   Shows don't tank in sales when they "become yuri." What extremely few examples we have (KnM off the top of my head) disprove that meme.        Shirabe and Kirika are pouting in the PV because someone is telling them "No, you two can't spend all your time fucking each other."    http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/micha.php  Mika: "People, cats and dogs in this street, I will dissect all of them."  Edgelord.  </wbr>  http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/tomosato.php  Their unison's result exceeds any numerical value!  </wbr>   I've always been of the opinion that it's not that yuri don't sell, it's just that yuri tend to be the only thing it's got going for it and the character dynamics are kind meh beyond the obligatory fanservice, thus not very good and so don't sell.    When you've got knives instead of fingers you probably develop a bit of a complex    Time to channel the power of /tv/ and spam Edward Scissorhands quotes when she starts turning up.   [x] Cool logo [x] New villains [x] Hotblooded fighting [x] LISTEN TO MY SOOOONGs [x] Genjuuro [ ] Yuri  It's so close, and yet, I feel empty.          S2CA Twin Break confirmed.   Oh god, I can't believe I'll have to go through the "subs where" again.     She will fuck Miku's shit up, I guarantee it. And the Zerbiki will tear her apart.  I cannot wait.      http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/garie.php  Roogeer! Garie is gonna do her best~☆  Guess we know this doll's personality now, huh.  </wbr>   Well shit. I was hoping for Shinku-style classiness.    What does Kirika's say though?    Is the yellow doll a slut? She looks like one.    http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/chris.php  I've always wanted this and yet... I still can't help but feel uncomfortable...    Is she talking about sex with the sword?    </wbr>  I've lost count of how many times I've listened to this. I'm not sure if I should be sad that the final song was spoiled, provided it is, but for now the hype is alive and wins.  Do we have a preview of Nana's OP yet?     She's talking about having a place to call home, and genuine friendship.  My sweet Chris. I want to protect her.       spoiler  Don't be silly; senpai doesn't know what sex is.     I'm banking for a Ononoki Yotsugi style of delivering it all in a deadpan voice.     implying Kanade would have been okay with that arrangement     http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/kirika.php  Now that you mention it, it was seriously an Aha-experience!  </wbr>    What does that even mean? And holy fuck her tits are so lewd.      Kiri's kiris are bigger than Tsurugi's tsurugis      Kanade forcing herself on Tsubasa   This pleases my penis.      http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/leiur.php  ...I don't like to be plain...  She's /fa/.  </wbr>    What about Carol? She sounds like she's pissed.    I'll take that as a yes then.   Of all the way to make Symphogear better, I didn't think they would go with adding doll joints.  It's like this whole series was created for me.    http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/phara.php  Fufu... From what I've listenined to, that song's so dull.  </wbr>   I want to fuck her so bad.  New look is nice. I'll miss her skirt, striped stockings and zr though.       What the hell is with that outfit anyway? What kind of high school girl dresses like that?         You will never see Shirabe's embarrassing parts  Also those Ogawa crackfags can leave now.    SOON   Will come out on Sunday.    Aha means Wow! I think she wanted to say it's a whole new experience.    eight days  Neat.   http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/phara.php  You can't do anything! Symphogeeaaaar!  </wbr>    What are you doing Symphogeaaaaaah!!    Should I expect QUALITY? Later episode of S2 were terrible.     That must either be when she's sitting on her throne or when she's about to use her danmaku shit on Bikki.     Oh, I misunderstand its meaning. this  is correct answer.     She's worst girl.    Noise look like CROWDs.    They are still better than S1. But since Satelight is also making Aquarion S3, I don't think they will have enough staff and time.     She should just go back to Gensoukyo, her moms are probably worried.      Satelight   Except impeccable animation.      You are worst taste    She has a young sister who has a nice body though.   http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/elfnein.php  My atonement is to deliver this heritage.  </wbr>   What does that mean? And put some goddamn pants on.    probably an asteroid-based superweapon or ancient zeppelin    I guess she fucked up something in the past and now is trying to compensate for it by delivering the box to someone/something. Carol for whatever reason doesn't lile that idea.   http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/hibiki.php  I... it's a miracle to be able to wear a Symphogear, I'm happy abou it!  </wbr>   No, you're the miracle Hibiki.    What are Miku's runes?     it's a miracle to be able to wear a Symphogear   got her Symphogear from Maria  Maria confirmed for miracle.      Could they make her spats any more lewd?  I mean holy shit. God damn. I want to see the back.      You don't realize how lewd they are until you realize her spats are tight enough to show her puffy vulva, check the OP    http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/ch_miku.png  Actually, letting you go back with an empty stomach would worry me more.  </wbr>    I don't mean to be crude, but I want to bury my face in that crotch.    I was hoping for something lewder.    I want her to bury her c ock  in my face    She's gonna take in some lesbian while Hibiki isn't home again.    Elfnein? And then Carol gets even more pissed off due to her sister(?) complex?    Everything with Chris is great.  Scale pajama christ, when?   I abandon any hope with gear scale already.           That tail   So is she an alien now?       Wonder where it's attached at?    Please no.   http://www.symphogear-gx.com/charac<wbr>ters/tsubasa.php  Sorry... But that's the way we are.  Tsubasa pls, not anyone can be a sword like you.  </wbr>   She's talking about being flat-chested. Sorry, I mean being "B81" chested.     The fuck is an Aha-experience? Is that just an experience that makes you realize something(makes you go "Aha!")?  Is she talking about how S2 made her realize how much she wanted to fuck Shirabe?       Why are damaged goods always the cutest?      HibiMiku adopt Elf9   TsubaMaria adopt Carol   Genjuro gives Chris a box full of doll parts and tells her to have fun   one gattai later...          Is she talking about how S2 made her realize how much she wanted to fuck Shirabe?  Well, she uses the word 体験 (taiken) which can either mean "own experience" or "physical experience".     That just means you're not trying hard enough!     This fucking LN. It feels pretty fun and good at first, but after volume 3, I feel like I was being scammed, betrayed, NTRed and... fuck, I'm just mad. To start off with the story premise.  It looks like a harem   It feels like a harem   It isn't one  For now at least, though I doubt it will change in the future. Fucking hell, the MC got a bunch of girls surround him and NONE of them can be said to hold actual romantic feeling for the MC. They just stand around him, being useless for the most part and tease the reader like: "Maybe there will be romance in the near future", "Look at all of these delicious girls who don't have any interest in the MC". This shit is just hardcore blue balled.  Then next, onto the 3 main girls. The goddess is an absolutely useless sack of shit in every aspect who has no redeeming point, the chuuni is also an useless sack of shit but to a lesser extent, the hardcore masochist knight is so good at the first 2 volumes it turned out to be a scam in volume 3 and she just make me feel NTRed while reading the first 2 chapters. She redeemed herself a little after that but I'm still mad.  2 other good girls that stay consistently good is that one Lich who's not in the party and the perfect goddess who has no screen-time (I doubt she will in the future)  And then we got the whole fiasco in volume 3 where it's essentially Shield Hero all over again with rotten aristocrat being rotten except that the MC didn't retaliate at all and just going along with all of these MISUNDERSTANDING and unjustly charges after a little bit of protesting. Which is a shame because he's a pretty good MC, a MC who's not a beta faggot at all, actually have interest in girls and sex, isn't dense, actually have common sense and an advocator of true gender equality but not to the degree of edgy.             Overall, this LN is good in the sense that it make me actually care and feel some kind of intense emotion toward it. But please, stop with the blue balling, if it keep continues like that then I'd rather the MC accepted the death sentence and proceeded to meet his true goddess. Maybe then he would find his happiness and those useless fucks would realize the gravity of what they had done.    Agree. Now anime fucking when?     Eh? Next season?    I feel pretty fucking bad when darkness was being shit to Kazuma. Fuck i know that its a comedy but come the fuck on.    There are a lot of serious issues in the story but they're all being downplayed 'cause it's comedy. I think doing so has an opposite effect rather than make the story funny.    If moonreader spoilers can be believed  MC does get the Good End with Eris.      Chuuni wizard is a less useless retard who cant do shit othern than explosion   Goddess of water is so much of a retarded drunkardthat mc wishes he didnt revive when jack frost beheaded him   Crusader girl is a fucking idiot who dreams of NTR and rape   all this girls that cancel his suppose good luck  And whats worse that all the other aquintances he knows are ungrateful little shits and he has to pay debts. The Lich and the other goddess is the only one that is relief for him         Come on, it's not that bad. She just got turned on because of a pervert old man but she still saved the MC in the end. The 3rd chapter was cute, even.     The LN is very different from the WN now though, supposedly the last boss is Moi, but it seems its expanding it.    That was in in the WN though, wasn't it?    Oh yeah, I forgot that the mass population of the town now shit on him because of his bad popularity and associating with him mean = debts. Fuck them.  Crusader girl is a fucking idiot who dreams of NTR and rape  Well, at least she still has a little bit of common sense and stand up for Kazuma ass time to time. If only she wasn't that much of a pervert.  YES. Even if this doesn't happen in the LN, I'm still happy.            the MC didn't retaliate at all and just going along with all of these MISUNDERSTANDING and unjustly charges after a little bit of protesting  Dont forget that when he actually tried, Aqua and darkness remarks on the schemes he did to make money and because of that he got in trouble more and supposed to be executed until darkness intervened with her being a noble.     What are you talking about? Volume 3 was hilarious. Thanks to Darkness, MC was pardoned then set free as long as Darkness meets the aristocrat's son, who, as you noticed, is a very good man. In fact, the MC tried to set Darkness up with the son (to get rid of her, but still.)  As for the debt, it will be gone soon (then come back, then gone again). The MC's A++ Luck rank comes in effect whenever those 3 (and their E Luck rank) are not with him.      Chuuni mage loli is best girl.    Right, the court was pure rage instead of fun with the main offenders are Megumin and Aqua.     Which is a shame because he's a pretty good MC   Steal the core  But from vol 2 he was actually stupid, not annoying stupid dense like generic MC though.  He is deserve to got all 3 stooges for party.       Yes, after chapter 2 it's fun again. But chapter 1 is pure rage (with a mixed of fun as well, I'll admit), and chapter at 2 I was too busy worrying about Darkness.    Only that one moment is stupid though. It feels too out of character when he just did that, I guess he was just following the heat of moment.     MC dies of SHOCK when he tried to save a girl but didnt notice it was just a tractor   no one mourn for him a bit and laugh when he was taken to the hospital when even his body was being buried in his funeral everyone was still laughing in the way he died   Goddess even laughs the fuck at him   gets send to another world expecting to redo his life and become adventurer   too bad its the weakest class possible   oh here get some useless girls that does nothing but put a debt on him and only joins because no accepts their useless ass   MC gets more in debt and regrets more   hunts jack frost and gets beheaded because his party members didnt mention about it being strong as fuck   meets a humble goddess   about to get send to a world where he has a waifu and rich   Useless goddess tries reviving him and mc begs to get send fast but DENIED   some city destroying giant is gonns destroy town   put alot of efforts in destroying it   now his a terrorist because it destroyed a nobles mansion   tries to defend himself in court and part and "friends" even puts him more to shit  ITS A COMEDY                  reminder from chink tl reader that loli mage pretty much wants MC's dick in future volumes    The goddess is an absolutely useless sack of shit in every aspect who has no redeeming point, the chuuni is also an useless sack of shit but to a lesser extent, the hardcore masochist knight is so good at the first 2 volumes it turned out to be a scam in volume 3 and she just make me feel NTRed while reading the first 2 chapters. She redeemed herself a little after that but I'm still mad.  So what's this shit about? they fuck some other dudes or what?     Some fucking comedy. Where the fuck is Naofumi when we actually need him?    They pretty much only care about the MC since no other party wants them    Who /succubus/ here?  Nah, she didn't fuck the other dude. She was just being a pure slut who lust after anyone who would give her a good beating and humiliation. Anyone.        tfw he didnt get that wet succubus fucking dream because of his party  Why.jpg     The succubus don't even actually fuck their customers with their own body but just give them lewd dreams.  That's a pretty shitty deal if you ask me.      the point of this kind of story is that you don't supposed to self insert onto the main character.  Just enjoy it from an outsider perspective       pure slut   not fucking anyone  What?      It's a good deal actually. You don't have to worry about all sort of diseases and fucking a loose hole, even more, you got to choose whatever play you want  Hell yes, best service in the industry. Despite her lewd occupation, she seem pure as fuck.      Then your gonna like the arc where his party betrays him because he ''ripped the king a new hole" and chases after him for bounty and the princess only the one who tries to convince everyone that he didnt do it.    You wouldn't feel mad about injustice if you're an outsider? I don't think so, I've sympathy you know?    Demons don't get STDs    Is this a Shield Hero parody?    Hence the pure part.   whats up with the knight ? i havent read the 3 yet   Things happen, just read it. It's better to read than to explain.   Is this a ln that will purposely try to annoy you or what? I'm getting mixed messages here. The Mc seems cool but I don't want to read another one of those novels that blue balls you ad infinitum  I don't know how anybody could feel annoyed with this LN. It's fucking hilarious.   Depends what you're looking for. If you want touching romance, you're totally in the wrong part of town. If you want near-porn, go read Shinmai Maou no Keiyakusha.  Like the other anon said, this is comedy. It's even more of a parody of serious fantasy stories than something like Slayers. That's what it offers, that's what you'll get. Take it or leave it.      I don't know actually. It seem like the author was trying to be funny but he went way overboard with volume 3 and make some people feel mad instead. I think you should give it a try anyway, volume 1 and 2 is definitely fun, volume 3 is also fun but there are rage mixed in.    Is that Hayate no Gotoku spin off?    Its try to be comedic but instead making you fuckig laugh its makes you fucking mad.    Both.     he went way overboard with volume 3  How so?     All the people that he meet so far basically put him more into trouble when he was defending himself in court for accidentality blowing up a nobles mansion and its pretty rage worthy scene    It was hilarious. Maybe you should try reading something different. It was obvious since the prologue of the first book that what kind of comedy this series is.    all girls are best girl in terms of character design   no romance/harem   What's up with this trend of great artists carrying lackluster authors? I don't know what's worse, worst girl winning in a visually impressive show/series, or the fact that it isn't even an option because there's no romance to begin with.       the designer of the giant robot was a depressed drunkard who submitted a squashed spider as his superweapon blueprint to try and tell them to fuck off but they actually built a spider robot the absolute madmen!     Just read the thread? In volume 1 and 2, everything is still reasonable to a certain extent. Masochist knight at that point is only shown to be lust after monsters, demon and MC. The debt he shouldered isn't that unfair considering his companion was the one who brought the demon boss to the town and he didn't do much to stop her at the first place. Then in volume 3, shit hit the fan with the MC actually got sentenced to death when all he did was just blowing the landlord mansion up with no casualties because the situation demanded it. He saved the whole town by doing so. But nobody in the town is willing to help him despite knowing exactly what he just did, everyone turned against him even. His companions are fucking idiots who fucked him up even further when he tried to defend himself in front of the court. And the worst part, after doing all of those useless shit that troubled the MC up until volume 3, they didn't learn they lesson at all, they didn't even shown sign of remorse. Then we are back to the masochistic knight, she's the best one of the three and she stand up to protect Kazama many times, she also saved his ass in the court but after that she just dropped a bomb that she's also lust after fat old men, then she proceed to disappear for the next chapter to do "something" with the landlord. Et cetera... there are more than that but I only remember this much.      More like only care their own ass while having someone to pay their price and they found MC Let's call it selfish     She doesn't mind perverts who are too skinny as well!    No, it wasn't obvious.  It seem like there will be romance later in the story, but blue balling readers this much in a supposedly harem LN is a fucking crime though.       she just dropped a bomb that she's also lust after fat old men, then she proceed to disappear for the next chapter to do "something" with the landlord  She lusts after anyone who will abuse torture humiliation her. Also you seem to have missed the part where she was gone because she was busy negotiating, the end result of which was the meeting for arranged marriage with the lord's son. It's doubtful she was ruined for marriage if marriage was the goal.      Do someone still remember we once liked this manga?   Not anymore after the mangaka made the shitty sequel, though     Who is "we"? I thought the sequel was fine, apart from the  one-dimensional secret boss replacing the more interesting villain out of nowhere .  /a/ liked it? I kinda dropped it due to RL issues but I wasn't aware /a/ cared about it.   There were some fans, but I don't remember people particularly dissing the second half.   Decadely reminder that you should skip the first chapter of this manga.  Have some chapter 2.        I remember.          Final Fantasy characters/10                      Question, does the hero stay as a beta pacifist fag like trigun?     I think? He gets a good background chapter early on.                              It dropped the balll with Superior Cross, felt pretty rushed.                                I remember it got boring fast like pretty much everything that goes for some half assed heroic fantasy stuff.      Dawg, it's all about the romance.      Hence the half assed heroic fantasy stuff.      You don't deserve to watch trigun you shit.   Shotas are for  healing             I really, REALLY wanted to like this series  But it's just not done very well    Which are better?  yu ya  best girl   Ash and Dawn are like bros, you argue with your bros, but at the end of the day you're still each others niggas. This relationship is platonic as fuck, like they could fuck one day because they're bored and it'd mean nothing to either of them.  Ash and Serena on the other is a whole nother type of relationship.  Don't piss off your significant other type of deal.       Oh my.     Yugioh   gay   2015  Someone hasn't been watching lately. Biggest YGO fuckboi yet, but also the least gay.       Are you saying Judai was gay? He gets to bang a demon yandere for all eternity. How's that gay?    [ron] Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha Vivid 01-12 (BATCH)  http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>05040  Bring on season 2.  </wbr>   based Ronanon is kingu  The swarm has episodes 11 and 12 which is the important part. The rest will slowly trickle in over the next day or two. Various sources say that there are other seeds but if they exist, then my awful connection still seems to be the best.  who are the best of the new character bloat. I like victoria and girl sol badguy. miura is cute too but for some reason I feel like her face is really punchable.  Thank you based ron  May your fields forever bare abundant crops    This show was incredibly disappointing. Half of it was devoted to training/tournament shit, and then the whole thing wasn't even covered.  How do Zerofags exist? I don't get it. It boggles the mind. Every fight in Zero feels like something from Naruto (He caught his sword and used it to deflect the other one!), and the plot is like a less mature version of Fate but with Heaven's Feel for an ending. This is ignoring that Zero is full of shitty CGI.  Even after Ufotable decided to remake UBW into the same sort of adaptation as Fate/Zero, Zerofags manage to actually bitch about UBW and how it isn't as "smart" or "mature" as their shitty spinoff.     UBW is the best for an series out of the 3 routes. But the ending of HF is also a high point of the whole VN. If there's some way to make those into one series then I don't think there would be as much anime-only fags bitching about F/SN being inferior to Zero.    No, maybe because in TV-version, but in VN none of the routes is balanced.    UBW is pretty balanced though. Like, at least when it comes to giving stuff to servants and the war. I think only Rider gets screwed over when it comes to fights. Compare that to Fate, where you had several servants show up and pull a Rider, or just die off screen, or HF, where most get done in by The Shadow.  Like, if you had to pick one route that'll give you as much out of the grail war premise as possible, UBW works the most.      i've only watched the anime but i have the exact opposite opinion and have no idea how people could like UBW more than zero    If you thinks about servants fights then yeah, but if about actual characters then UBW is lacking even more than other routes.   I think we can all agree who the best FMP girls was    No, apparently we can't.     Your taste is flawless, OP, here's a bump.      Tessa is the best by far.     you're good people  </blockquote>]
