[ Which Symphogear the sexiest, /a/?  <br>Shirabe</br>  In terms of pure raw sex appeal:<br><br>Maria &gt; Chris &gt;&gt;&gt; Hibiki &gt; Kirika = Shirabe &gt; Tsubasa.</br></br>  <br> Maria  has the best body.</br>  <br>How is Hibiki more sexy than the lolis?</br>  <br>Really?<br><br>Really?</br></br></br>  <br>She has a better body, and besides the lolis are more cute than they are sexy. If this was a ranking of cuteness, they'd be near the top  behind Chris of course. </br>  Hibiki<br><br>Because boobs</br></br>  <br><br>Miku stop posting on 4chan</br></br>  <br><br>oh god what is that expression supposed to convey</br></br>  Oh I think we all know the answer to that  <br>It's almost impressive how you managed to get the exact opposite of the real order.</br>  Chris  <br> that wasn't a fart </br>  <br>Kiri-chan</br>  <br><br>Call the police!<br><br>Some fiend has stolen her pubes!</br></br></br></br>  Sword autist, though everyone is sexy as fuck.  Carol should have taken advantage of Hibiki while she was KO'd.  <br><br>I bet she's double-jointed with no gag reflex and she fucks like she's being electrocuted</br></br>   Tsubasa lands first to absorb the shock before letting Maria go <br>Neat.</br>  <br>Dat loli butt and dfc. My penis is being compelled to agree.</br>  <br>And summoned the wrath of SENKOU on herself? No she needs to survive as a villian until at least episode 11</br>  <br>No one has to know</br>  <br>Anon no I don't need to think about Kanade deepthroating my dick right now.</br>  <br><br>She'd be stimulating your prostate the whole time too just to make sure she got every last drop out of you she could</br></br>   What are you doing?   <br> one of at least two Biki-POV shots <br>I've never wanted to be a Biki so badly.</br></br>    Will Bikki become a god or have a talk with Odin himself?  <br> You know, gay stuff </br>  <br>More like<br><br> woh! They do that even in public! </br></br></br>    <br>Why are they so gay?</br>  <br>Symphogear has always had bunch of nice animation touches.</br>   no Genjuro <br> mfw </br>  <br>Anyone would be gay for these two so it makes sense they are gay for each other. I wonder if we will ever see how they first met. Were they from the same orphanage?</br>  Chris, Kanade, Maria    <br>They are clearly  brother and sister. Seriously, Kirika still looks like a boy to me. </br>  <br>It's implied</br>  <br> White wedding dress </br>  <br>I'm not gay but I'd let Genjuro enter my butt while watching Enter the Dragon.</br>  <br>Maria and Chris.</br>  <br> being rude </br>  <br>They were Receptor Children so there was probably a long drawn out genealogical survey by Ryoko to find potential replacements for herself, then they were abducted young enough/bought to make suitable experiments without any emotional issues related to being kidnapped and turned into guinea pigs.</br>  <br>All of the characters except for Chris and Maria still need their backstories explained more in depth.</br>    <br>Didn't Shirabe and Kirika basically just spend their entire lives as lab rats? They were picked up so young that they don't really have backstories.</br>    Does Tsubasa have no good parents too?  <br>We only know Tsubasa has Genjuro and a grandpa.</br>  <br>I imagine they were killed by Noise.</br>  Chris is sex<br><br>Seriously she is made to be loved physically, whether its with held hands, fingers locked while making love in the missionary position for the purposes of procreation or tied by the wrists to the headboard, blindfolded ridden hard until she loves it so much she can't live without it</br></br>  <br>A blade is forged, not born.</br>  <br>3deep5me</br>  <br>Ver</br>  <br>I thought the Receptor Children were all taken from orphanages. How long has the Receptor Children program been going on? Did DMJii know Serena?</br>  <br>She's too pure for sex</br>  Who's she going to kill to get Hibiki angry enough to fight?  <br>Kanade because dat voice</br>  <br> Kanade </br>   Oh! Miku! <br><br> You want to get in on this? <br><br> I'll hold her down if you want to have some fun! </br></br></br></br>  <br>But who forged her?</br>  Post table manners.  <br><br>Kay</br></br>  <br>牛乳? More like 巨乳!</br>  <br>Will Chris still be the most unfit one in this season's training montage, or will one of the FIS girls dethrone her?</br>  <br>No one. She'll either prove that pacifism is the best path by not fighting even after someone is killed or learn that pacifism is shit and bad guys need to be punched by going on a journey to find a reason to fight.</br>  <br/>    <br>Chris has to be unfit. Otherwise, you'd have to imagine all that fluffiness replaced by lean, toned muscle.</br>  <br> Those zenbus <br>muh dick</br></br>  <br>WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN</br>  <br>Shirabe will. Maria will surprisingly be fit and spend her time worrying and babying Shirabe.<br><br>For a twist Kirika is last while Shirabe is fit as hell.</br></br></br>  Chris is a whore. A WHORE.  <br>Option A is ludicrous in the face of someone who intends to end the world and option B is going to require an impetus to force her to change her viewpoint. You know, like someone getting killed due to her inaction.</br>  <br>Former whore anon, get it right.</br>  <br><br>Same time this did</br></br>  <br>Hibiki is a ludicrous person and has pulled that shit before. All you have to do is call her a hypocrite once and she'll be a ball of insecurity until she can training montage it away.</br>    <br>lookin mighty chaika there</br>    <br>Will Carol finally be evil instead of being cute?</br>  <br>Hibiki'll sing the second verse of G-beat when option B happens.<br> In order to protect, even if I have to hurt something <br> I won't turn my eyes away from pain anymore <br> Unless I step forward with more resolve <br> I won't be able to face the future </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> We need to save Miku! <br> Go punch some dead cows. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not like they knew where Miku is anyway. Better leave that for the investigation team.</br>  <br><br>That bothers you but drinking three raw eggs in a gulp is fine?</br></br>  <br>Meat. Punch. Get stronger. Fight. Save friends!</br>  <br>She's trying really hard</br>  <br>They're all sexy, except hibiki and shirabe.</br>  <br>Shirabe, hopefully.</br>    <br>I remember you. You're that creepy ass guy who thinks Chris is his loyal wife.</br>    <br>Sexiest:<br>Kanade &gt;= Maria &gt; Chris &gt;= Hibiki &gt; Tsubasa &gt; Kirika &gt; Shirabe<br><br>Cutest:<br>Chris &gt; Kirika = Hibiki &gt; Kanade &gt; Shirabe &gt; Maria &gt; Tsubasa<br><br><br>It's going to be Genjuuro and I'm going to cry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    why do people like this show? its just retarded singing  <br>I was going to &gt;sample; but the full image is 2big.</br>  <br>it's the madoka ripoff of the season what did you expect?</br>  <br> DESS will never surprise hug you </br>  <br>So retarded to the point of being fun and cool. Especially with hibiki as the MC. (Punching through a mountain and suplexing a space shuttle).</br>    Sometimes I sleep and I dream that I'm tsubasa. Then I wake up and remember I'm not a sword and cry.  <br> actually replying seriously </br>  <br>While he took the bait, he's not wrong. Symphogear is blatant stupid fun and little else.</br>  <br>Just like that ass.<br><br> We will NEVER get a Hibiki version <br><br>Fuck everything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean you don't watch it for the intriguing, well-developed plot?</br>  <br><br> Is that going in my ass? </br></br>  <br><br>ANIMEJANAI</br></br>  <br><br> Drinking egg yolks like that <br><br>Shit, mix them up a bit before you do it.

I blame /co/ and /v/ for their unhealthy fear of the non Japanese SJW</br></br>  <br>There's going to be the typical sidekick bro and MC is going to marry him</br>  <br>Isn't he just lovely?</br>  <br>I'd literally import every volume just to support it then</br>    /pol/ has been pretty active the past month on /a/, I wonder why  <br>He wants her to think he's creepy AND dumb.</br>  How long until the joke gets old?  <br><br> It's true when I say so <br><br>Pls go.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Go dig up some dirt right now. You'll find at least five in that scoop.</br>  <br> not wanting the loli <br>TOO FAAR</br></br>  <br>nigga thats worms</br>  <br>You might be confusing caterpillars and worms.</br>  <br>Because their own board is a cancerous piece of shit, so they flock to others and shit them up in the process<br><br>Like immigrants</br></br></br>  <br>No wonder he is gay.<br>Those cow tits would make anyone detest women.</br></br>  <br>Never because it is a oneshot.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128008715 <br>Even the dialogue is terrible. Why re people excited about this? Is it just the novelty of the idea? Are you all that easily entertained?</br>  Does this have an abbreviation already like gayrem or something?  So why doesn't he just say that he's gay?  <br>She's generic anon. You wouldn't want a generic loli would you? Its not special in any way.</br>  <br>oh look /v/ermin getting in again.</br>  Why is everyone discussing it like its going to be an ongoing series? Isn't it just a new oneshot?  <br><br>I can't see this lasting long. He's pretty much nailed every trope</br></br>  <br> &gt;tsunderes are ineffective against gay people <br>So the tsundere haters are literally faggots.<br>I KNEW IT</br></br></br>    <br>Well we watch anime. What do you think.</br>  this is pretty great but I don't see how it could be more than a one-shot and still be good.  <br>It's already dull.</br>  <br>Because Japan doesn't have gays.</br>  <br> non blood related <br> overseas parents <br><br>Where is his sidekick already</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure they used this plotline in the TV show "Number 96" about 40-45 years ago</br>  This guy acts a lot like me.<br>Is this why people think I'm gay?</br>  Why is MC such an annoying edge lord faggot? Can he not be nice or something?  <br>Bro incoming!</br>  <br>No you just have autism</br>  <br>He is just apathetic because he is a gay in Japan.</br>  <br>He is just tired. He gets this shit everyday and he doesn't want any of it. Being nice will just make it worse.</br>  <br> make like a tree and leaf <br>What? That's not it. Hasn't this guy seen Back to the Future?</br></br>  <br>Yeah, no, fucks this conversation. This is clearly going to go nowhere. Feel free to say whatever.<br><br>Kudos to the guy that storytimed the one-shot, it was fun.</br></br></br>  <br>An abrasive asshole who tries whatever tactic possible to get women to stay away from him?<br><br>Yeah probably.</br></br></br>  <br>I should get tested then.</br>  <br>What kind of faggot do you want him to be?</br>  <br> Cause his life is hell.</br>  So this is just a one shot right, don't see it working as anything else. Maybe a 4koma  <br> Homosexuality is a disease <br><br>Now I know why this board turned me gay after all these years. T-Thanks, /a/.</br></br></br>    <br>yes.</br>  <br>this<br>being nice has a chance, however slight, of being encouraging</br></br>  <br>he was probably nice the first few times, but he got tired of the same shit that he doesn't even care anymore</br>  <br>some one shots become great after being serialized even if they had zero potential, others become shit right away even if they had lots of potential, the premise isn't important but the execution of it.</br>  <br>Holy kek</br>  <br>I love this.<br>Its hilarious.</br></br>  <br> I friggin' love cats <br><br>I'm dying here</br></br></br>  <br>man i love this shit, i'm gay now?</br>    <br>There's something off about this guy. I thought he said he was allergic to cats.</br>  <br>I would be okay if this shit be yaoi instead of trying to emulate a fucking shonen harem manga. I would rather want a religous MC instead of a fucking shitty gay one.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128008715 <br> implying shit </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128009185 <br>it wouldn't survive long but the premise is genius.</br>  <br>Oh boy, here we go.</br>  <br>this guy.... my sides.... in orbit</br>  <br> He's actually gay <br> Has an actual crush <br><br>I'M PROUD, JAPAN</br></br></br></br>  <br>God damn it, don't make me like this. Homosexuality is a sin.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128009185 <br>Good concept but the Author is really doing it in the worst way possible.</br>  <br> mc friend starts liking her <br>its ogre</br></br>  <br>Stupid bitch you are ruining everything</br>  <br>waiting for him to have asked mc-kun over just to get to the girl</br>  <br> mfw that was translated </br>  <br>Who cares, this is just funny, take your rights bullshit wherever that antisjw went and both kill each other.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128009325 <br> having a devianart <br> making comics <br>wat</br></br></br>    <br> makes the protag outright gay. <br> Excellent. <br><br> getting fucked by an actual fag. <br> This sounds fantastic. <br><br> fuck off /v/ faggotry is great  <br><br> male gay tsundere. <br>ITT:Americans</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And that's an excuse to be a dick? Right.<br>Fucked up part is I know for a fact this would happen in real life. Why are people so self-centered cunts?</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128009325 <br>and you are stuck posting in the threads about deviant art comics</br>  <br>Here it comes!</br>  <br>Ntr coming in fast</br>  <br>this needs more pages</br>  <br> let me get a sip of your oolong tea </br>  <br>people are dicks in real life, because their lives are hell.<br>it makes sense</br></br>  <br>Chill dude it's a gag manga.<br>Did mommy not give you enough tendies?</br></br>  <br>Because that's the way people work? It isn't surprising that someone takes the only solution they can see for their problem.<br><br>The character doesn't want to be liked for Pete's sake. Of course he is going to be a dick.</br></br></br>  <br>No need to get defensive, I like that his preferences take a part on the comedy best.</br>  <br> Getting this mad over a gag manga and a oneshot at that. <br>You are a sad person.</br></br>  <br>No let ME get a sip of YOUR oolong tea anon ;)</br>  <br>Ironically, you're the one being a dick in this thread with your incessant whining while people are just having fun with a comedy manga.</br>  <br>it was over before begining</br>  <br>do you want to keep smiling to everything anon ? There is a time where you get tired of the same shit everyday that you just don't give a fuck anymore. He's being an asshole so what ? Does that make the girls lives horrible ? Would his words drive them to kill themselves.</br>  Is this gay push thread just newfaggotry, or are we getting raided by tumblr?  Your daily reminder that:<br><br> /a/ <br> straight </br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, that's all. It's a bit vague on whether the last page will be published online too or only in the magazine  but I'm one of those faggots who buy magazines so I'll be able to update it with the final page either way. </br>  <br>He's also only an asshole to the girls who constantly pester him with shit he doesn't care about. Which incidentally is everyone because he's a harem protagonist.</br>  <br>Pretty much I genuinely create elaborate and long reviews for games and anime, but also just shitpost that they're horrible without reason on /a/ and /v/<br><br>But I genuinely enjoy them, but they are genuinely shit and if you think they're good you should feel bad.</br></br></br>  Given the success in this thread, is Yaoi finally becoming more acceptable in the /a/ mainstream?  <br>Well, I can safely say the gag got old after the first few pages.</br>  <br>Thanks for the dump.</br>  <br><br>FUCK THIS GAY EARTH</br></br>  you guys are missing the point, even if a premise like that got somewhere like getting a series the discussion about it would be no different from a normal harem manga, but with boys instead.  <br>FUCK.<br> Thanks </br></br>  <br>You're so new I can taste it. /a/ as had homo threads for almost a decade.</br>  <br>Only Americans anon. Other people aren't.</br>  <br>Trips confirm that we are all faggots. Digits don't lie.</br>  <br>Baka, what the fuck.</br>  <br>Less Yaoi and more poking fun at stupid harem tropes.</br>  <br>More and more anons are liking shoujo.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128009465 <br>Are you ashamed of your posts being removed?</br>  <br>Nope</br>  <br>there's hardly any well written yaoi, you get more rape in yaoi that in anything else and somehow it's fine and shit. i'll never understand fujos.</br>    <br><br>Its obvious that TooGay-kun is going to get NTR'd by the pussy cat slut.</br></br>  <br>You do realize this is for shits and giggles, right?</br>  <br><br>Haters gonna hate.<br><br> No but really, this is the thing that people that got sick and tired of the overused and sad archetype of the Harem MC were waiting for. It would be weird if nobody gave a shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The janitor is a bully, poor guy  ;_; </br>  <br>Pretty entertaining, but it'd be properly top notch with someone with more experience and finesse behind it.</br>  Let's stop shitposting and just enjoy a moderately funny gag manga that makes fun of stupid harem tropes.<br><br>So that we are clear, both sides of the SJW debate are stupid, selfcentered people that have no place here, so let's avoid any form of discussion, jap give no fucks about that so it doesn't affect /a/</br></br>  <br>It's less about being gay than it is about making fun of harems.<br><br>Get fucked.<br/></br></br></br>  <br>Yaoi is porn. Not a gag manga that happens to have a gay protag and makes good use of it for laughs.

I watched it KNOWING it would turn into incest, and I didn't see any romance at all in the first season. It was a cute story about a brother and a sister haphazardly repairing their broken relationship. <br><br>It was adorable. <br><br>Season 1 is always gonna be a 8/10 for me, while season 2 is always gonna be a 1/10. <br><br>Show is a 5/10 overall.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You meant to post this  <br>See, I didn't think the second season was that bad. If anything, the only thing I didn't like was how everyone confessed to Kyousuke and the ending.</br>  Bitch.  Thinking about the ending will always make me upset. It would have been a perfect story if it ended at the kiss. Every moment that happened afterwards just broke my heart. The author's implications at the end aren't enough for me   Greatest Love Story Ever   <br>Abominations are to be removed, not loved.</br>  <br>Wasn't it actually confirmed? Pretty sure Kirino said something rather damning to Kuroneko well after the fact.</br>  <br>You can't remove  love </br>  <br>It turned into a harem out of nowhere. The only person who you could say had feelings for him in S1 was Ayase (before she thought he was a disgusting creep and forcing otaku fetishes onto Kirino), and Kuroneko (who really only had feelings for him toward the end). <br><br>I thought the ending was highly entertaining, because of how much of a trainwreck it was, but other than that I hated it. I feel like it ruined the story. And I don't even care if the LNs were vastly different. I liked S1, I wanted to see more of that. Instead I got a harem that the author had to leave ambiguous due to censorship laws.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope. I'm right with ya friend.<br><br>Daily reminder for all the anime only fags:<br>http://pastebin.com/g1awYmW4</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I know. I know that all too well.</br>  <br>Yeah, that was the annoying part.</br>  Reminder she rides her  Nissan  every night  Second after story when?  <br>Fucking idiot it's "A Nissan"</br>  Best girl of all time?  Is it more lewd in the manga <br>Where should I pick it up? I don't read much manga but I might start</br>  <br>btw thank you for the link anon.</br>    <br>thank you we will not forget</br>  <br>I think someone needs to update that pastebin with the following info:<br><br>In volume 3 of ero manga sensei, the new novel of the creator of Oreimo. In the last chapter Masamune and Sagiri went to a bookstore in akihabara to view their own created light novel. While getting out of the bookstore, Masamune meets with kirino, kyousuke, kuroneko and sayori. Kirino bought the light novel of Masamune. <br><br>This story can be found in the last chapter of volume 3 ero manga sensei and has a connection with: A Momentary Chance Encounter of Oreimo. <br><br>In other words, Ero manga sensei takes place in the same time/place as Oreimo. <br><br>In Ero manga sensei, kirino is not mentioned by her name but if you read A Momentary Chance Encounter of oreimo and then volume 3 of ero manga sensei then you will see the connection. <br><br>THERE YOU HAVE IT KIRINO BRO'S A CAMEO!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's definitely interesting, but not what the pastebin is for.</br>  <br>You know I read an interpretation somewhere that all those confessions to Kyousuke were his chances to get a girlfriend that wasnt Kirino before Kirino went abroad. I like to think it had some significance.<br><br><br>I don't know/remember. Was it in the LNs? I haven't read them but lately I've been really wanting to</br></br></br></br>  <br> You know I read an interpretation somewhere that all those confessions to Kyousuke were his chances to get a girlfriend that wasnt Kirino before Kirino went abroad. I like to think it had some significance. <br><br>I personally think that the reason why kyousuke became popular is because of Kirino. You have to remember that those girls, the ones who confessed to kyousuke are all kirino's friends. We only see the story from the point of view of Kyousuke but we don't know what kirino was thinking and what she did. <br><br>There are some hints that she didn't shittalk about him if she was with one of her friends. Ayase and Kuroneko mentioned it a few times and hinted to it that kirino was talking only good about her brother. Perhaps in the process of this things the other girls started to like kyousuke. <br><br>And besides kyousuke also helped the other girls with their troubles he gave them also a form of life counseling so I don't think the harem came from nowhere.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm <br>Honestly, it was something I heard from someone else, so it may just be a game of telephone at this point. I'm going to go read through them again myself.</br></br>  <br>wrong pic.</br>  Kirino is the cutest  <br>Since when did K-on do romance?</br>  <br>If you're referring to the anime, yes.</br>  <br>How funny and original anon!</br>  Assuming we never went incest, which girl would theoretically be the best for Kyousuke?<br><br> We know it won't be Manami due to Kirino </br></br>  <br>I say Ayase.</br>  <br>Definitely Ayase. Even if Kirino wasn't in the picture Manami would be THE WORST choice ever. She's so boring, submissive and complacent.<br>Ayase is pretty independent and passionate. Plus she has that aggressive/cute personality similar to Kirino and has a sense of humor that is similar to Kyousuke's.<br>I like Saori too but I don't think she's as interesting as Ayase.<br>Kanakana (or whatever) is...no<br><br>And DEFINITELY not Kuroneko. This one also needs no explanation</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Also I was disappointed that Kyousuke's male friend and his imouto didn't hook up ;_; Would have been very entertaining tbh  <br>It's unquestionably Sakurai, Kyousuke's actions heavily imply it.</br>  <br>Well she was a homolust fujoshit. Kirino was a brocon.</br>  Thanks for reminding me. Makes my innards warm when I see this image.  <br>She just need some vitamin D from her Onii-chan.</br>  <br> &gt;There are some hints that she didn't shittalk about him if she was with one of her friends. Ayase and Kuroneko mentioned it a few times and hinted to it that kirino was talking only good about her brother. <br>It's more than that. Whatever she was saying about Kyousuke made them all realise that she was a brocon long before the end.<br><br>That's part of the reason for the harem shit, they were trying to separate the siblings romantically.</br></br></br></br>    There aren't any more novels <br>I needed this story to be 500 chapters long</br>  <br>If it makes you feel any better, there are still people deciding to read it for the first time</br>  <br> you will never read it for the first time again </br>  <br>Why you do dis anon?</br>  <br>I don't know, it's not like that doesn't make me sad too. I hope we will be able to read the NanoDesu translation, though the progress is extremely slow.</br>  <br>The best would have been Ayase for sure, but I think if it wasn't for Kirino, Kyouske would have decided to go for Sakurai, after all she was his first love.</br>  <br>His first love was Manami.</br>  <br> Although Manami's eyes were red and swollen from crying <br><br> But just like in the past, we smiled with each other. <br><br> That must be the end of our first love, which never began. <br><br>Kyouske never saw her like that, she was just her friend, and nothing more, no matter how the story would have developed, Kyosuke would never have ended up with Manami.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it never happened because of Sakurai's injury, his grandmothers death and Manamis meddling combined. However he once was in love with her, that's why he answers Sakurai in volume 11 that had she confessed on that school trip he would have said that he already likes someone else, which was obviously refering to Manami.</br>  Why did everyone keep quiet on how good this show is?<br><br>Best first episode of this season by far.</br></br>  <br>Its actually generic shoujoshit and not good.</br>  Anon please next episode will be coming soon we're trying to save it from shitpost  <br><br> Shoujo <br> Bad <br><br>spicy meme</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the exact reason we keep quiet about it.<br>Have you watched Yona?

If the committee still want him, he must still have some serious use.<br> Okabe <br>Reading steiner could maybe be useful somehow, kind of smart, gets pretty dedicated when it comes to saving some people.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But we do have new stuff in the form of the mainline games. We just got Chaos;Child last year.<br>Antimatter would have been something new. Zero is just based on three novels we already got between 2012 and 2014.<br><br><br>Takumi is a  full bona-fide human now. There's nothing differentiating him from any normal person anymore, not since the moment Shogun died. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fate/Zero and Fate/hollow ataraxia are canon, yes.</br>  <br>Hey, I'm the one who asked that question!</br>    <br>I really wonder what's up with Shoguns family after his death. Do they just care for Nanami, do they even know about Taku?</br>  <br><br>Shogun's entire existence confuses me with how little of it is actually addressed.</br></br>  <br> no need for any event to connect both franchises. <br>Oh, for fuck's sake</br></br>  how did takumi lose his powers? he still had them at the end of chaos;head right?  <br>No.  When Shogun died he was finally real-booted fully as a real person. No powers. </br>  <br>Real booting a person, so changing himself from delusion to human, takes away your sick powers.</br>  Without his powers as a gigalomaniac, how exactly can Taku even be useful or relevant anymore? As far as I remember, he wasn't really shown to be particularly good at anything non-otaku related.  <br>He doesn't have anything to bring to the table. Even in 2019 (as seen in Robotics;Notes) he's the same old anime fanatic.</br>  <br><br>Taku is smart and able to learn.<br>He could scout for information in the web and be some kind of apprentice to Daru's "Hakka skillz".</br></br></br>  <br>He knows about the Committee, and b y the end pof C;H is smart, confident and willing to help. With how limited the Anti-Committee resources seem to be, I bet he'd be a great asset.</br>  Chaos;Child Love Chu-Chu happening  <br> From within Takuru's prison cell? </br>  <br>he makes a good coffee</br>   Removing worst girl from S:G <br><br>10/10 AOTYEY</br></br>  <br>kek, you aren't getting rid of Steins;Gate mascot any time soon. Amadeus will be Okabe's replacement waifu, and she's able to phone him anytime. Expect Kurisu to show up plenty even if she's dead.</br>  <br>This also excites me. All they have to do is add even more Daru and I'm hyped.</br>  <br>Daru is prominent in Epigraph. So that shouldn't be an issue.</br>  <br>  Nah, it would be at the nursing home.  </br>  So I've only watched steins;gate, and all the talk of these other "series" within the steins;gate universe confuses me <br><br>How does robotics;notes or chaos;head tie into steins;gate? <br><br>Are they really necessary to read or am I better off just leaving the steins;gate ending where it is?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Real booting a person, so changing himself from delusion to human, takes away your sick powers. <br><br>Was this mentioned in C;H? Or maybe the shitty english patch for it glossed over this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You read the VNs and don't touch the anime for anything else.<br><br>If you don't want to read, that's fine, but don't watch the animes, just do not.</br></br></br>  <br>Mentioned in Love Chu Chu.</br>  <br><br>no,no, I'm fine with reading, I'm just curious if reading r;n and c;h is going to be worth it? <br><br>Unless it specifically ties into the events of s;g, i don't really care.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He also claims in chaos;child that he lost his powers.</br>  <br>Chaos;Head is more disconnected since it was the first in the series. Steins;Gate is actually full of references to it. Robotics;Notes ties the titles together even further, and Chaos;Child binds Chaos;Head into it more again.</br>  <br>Yes, it is worth it.<br>Chaos;Head sets up the antagonists, S;G uses theories of C;H. R;N uses both characters and theories of C;H and S;G.<br>The new Chaos;Child is a direct sequel of the Chaos;Head Dual VN.</br></br></br>  <br>Here you go anon, get reading.</br>  <br><br><br>alright, sounds good. For some reason I assumed that they were a part of the same franchise, but each took place within their own "universe" that had nothing to do with one another. <br><br><br>If the other VN's explain some things in S;G more elaborately then I definitely want some of that</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They are all in the same universe, all reference each other, and share common themes.<br> Whose eyes are those eyes? </br></br>  <br><br><br>The VNs are highly recommended reading material. Most people would prefer you hold VNs &gt; anime as the anime adaptations are typically subpar.<br><br>All of the Sci;Adv entries take place in the same universe in chronological order with:<br><br>Chaos;Head -&gt; Steins;Gate -&gt; Robotics;Notes -&gt; Chaos;Child<br><br>All of them tie into each other.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Robotics;Notes is in 2019, Chaos;Child in 2015.</br>  <br><br>その目だれの目？</br></br>  <br><br>Ah you're right, my mistake.<br><br><br><br><br>I thought there weren't any translations for C;C and ChuChu available?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> その目神の目？ <br> その目 <br> 神の目？ </br></br></br>  <br>Some people can speak Japanese.</br>  <br><br>At the rate it's going, I'll be fluent in Japanese before a localization comes out then.</br></br>  <br>what was happening here? I was away for that stream</br>  <br>Like Evangelion.</br>  <br>They're talking about the murders and then one of them spazzes suddenly</br>  <br>Oh man, I really hope I can experience and read that one day. <br>I remember the voice message Takumi got on the school roof, that shit was pretty creepy, then the fucking buzzer.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127997529 <br>Shit, wrong pic.</br>  <br>What is happening? What are they doing?</br>  <br>Yes it does! It needs a wedding episode! Then we can call it good. Though I agree, the new series seems a bit much.</br>  <br> okabe marrying a conputer </br>  <br>I must be missing some theory, or concept.<br>I only watched the main series and the OVA, it looked like everything got fixed and they were all in same timeline.</br></br>  <br>Do you think Amadeus teases him about falling in love with a 2D girl? I'd like to see that.</br>  <br>0 is the story about the Okabe that failed and planned operation Skuld. <br><br>It's a good moment to step up your game and read the side stories as there is some great material.</br></br></br>  <br>I know that 0 is going to be about that, but when I made the comment on the marriage episode I was basing it off the main story ending. Not that there should be a marriage episode in 0, though, I'd find it amusing.</br>  <br>There's no romance in Epigraph. Amadeus hurts him rather than makes him feel anything good. It piques Okabe's interest and he likes the brain, but he does not register it as his Kurisu. Because it isn't.</br>  <br>Ova isn't canon.</br>  <br>As long as the ending scene is a dying Okabe smiling at the ruins of the world saying one last time "Christina", all is fine for me.</br>  <br>The more I know.<br>So what is the canon end then? The end in the original series? Well if so, doesn't that still leave potential for them being reunited? I admit my memory is hazy, been awhile since my last watch.</br></br>  <br>Neither the Movie nor the OVA are canon. The canon ending is ep 24, it's an open ending. Though in the canceled project it shows that their relationship had not advanced.</br>  <br>There was also the afterstory set around Christmas.</br>  <br>interesting, kinda sad, but ok.</br>  <br>It isn't canon to the VNs, the anime kind of is its own canon.</br>  Was she autistic?  <br>No, just a retard.</br>  <br>All moe is, in its core, autistic.</br>    <br>Truer words have never been written.</br>  I could never skip a single one of this show's OPs/EDs<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_bi<wbr>TwsOOhKk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XPE<wbr>xT7cepdk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=SSJ<wbr>7RBvchlw</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PU7<wbr>NkF2YMNs</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wrong thread.</br>  Actually looking forward to this. It's not being written by whoever did the OVA and the movie, right? It's the original author of S;G, yes?  <br> Antimatter committee <br>I'm still FUCKING MAD</br></br>  <br>He's right, you know</br>  <br>Yes.</br>    <br><br>Correct. Some actual canon S;G writing.</br></br>  <br> the writers of the VN were not at all involved in the writing or direction of the movie. <br><br>That's just bullshit, Naotaka Hayashi is credited as having supervised the scenario for Deja vu</br></br></br>  <br>He supervised it, but Hanada penned it.</br>  <br>He supervised the scenario for the TV anime too. Doesn't mean it's canon.</br>  <br>Didn't he wrote the short novel for Deja Vu too?</br>  <br>Of course, but that's still involvement.<br><br>Now that Naotaka worked on Plastic Memories, I think it would be interesting to see him adapting the script to one of the SciADV anime adaptations himself though.</br></br></br>  <br>All I'm saying is you should find a new way to argue about what's canon or not that isn't about Naotaka Hayashi's involvement with it when his role in Deja vu's production was the exact same as his role in Epigraph's, which I have a sneaking suspicion you have no problems calling canon.</br>  <br>ZONO ME, KAMI NO ME?</br>  I heard some japs were making a fanmade VN set in the SG world line where the main guy gets turned into a girl and works together with the Anti-Committee for some reason.
