Her lust won't be sated with Kuro.</br></br>  Kuro is worst girl. Literally only good for doujins.  Totally a deep nuanced franchise about complex subjects and great characters and not just fan service schlock....you know just like Monogatari.  <br> http://webmup.com/78780/vid.webm <br>For a moment I thought I was watching Sakura trick.</br></br>  <br><br>The truest Ilya is the F/Sn one, because that one's complete. This one is basically half of Ilya. missing much of the full Ilya's personality.</br></br>   <br>Live reaction thread for those who missed it.</br>  <br>It can be interesting and have decent character interactions.  When Kuro isn't around. Otherwise it's just slutty loli fanservice to insure NEET bux </br>  <br>How many anons would have actually bought this OVA though?</br>  <br>When will you stop with your shitposting?<br>Not everything needs to be deep to be good, faggot</br></br>  Jesus christ!!

There isn't any genitalia or nipples drawn so looking at blank crotches and boobs is terrible, so steam is okay here in that case.</br>  <br>Does it really count as NTR when they all want Shirou's dick anyway?</br>  <br>why shirou is so ugly ?</br>  <br><br>Miyu doesn't.</br></br>   All these people picking Prisma because loli yuri <br>Is yuri really that effective at baiting people into shows?</br>   DVD <br>The OVA is actually a BD.</br>  <br>you're clearly here for a reason, else let me guide you to a more suitable place for you<br/></br>  <br>Yuri done well yes.</br>  <br>But I came to Prisma Illya because of 3rei not because of yuri.</br>  <br>Why she keeps sliding on Illya's body?<br>That's fucking delicious.</br></br>  <br>They were rubbing their nipples together.</br>  <br>S-Stop anon, this dick can't take anymore hardening</br>  <br>Then she grinded her pussy on Illya's knee.</br>  <br> the girls are straight and the yuri is text book definition fanservice <br> done well </br></br>  <br>I mean the quality of the animation.</br>  <br>okay, that's kinda going too far. The show still had a pretense of making sense, but this is just softcore porn.</br>  <br>So... How old are they again?</br>  <br>Oh, okay. Yeah, you're right, there.</br>  <br> Too old.</br>  <br><br>11</br></br>  <br> softcore porn <br>and this is bad how?</br></br>  <br> The show still had a pretense of making sense, but this is just softcore porn. <br><br>I don't see why those things are mutually exclusive.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think it's possible to get any lewder than this without going full hentai.</br>  <br><br>11 or 12</br></br>  <br> The only man/person/being in your life (assuming the dad died) <br> Sacrifices himself so you'd have a new place to go to <br> Find a new best friend <br> She keeps hitting on your onii-chan <br> Even though she's his sister <br><br>Imagine having to be raised only by your mom.

Just showing a page of examples,</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off retard.</br>  <br>If they're on the clock, they're ready for the cock, anon.</br>  Episode 3 was everything I wanted from this adaptation.  Giving more depth and personality to Megu-nee was fucking brilliant.<br> I love you all SO WHY WON'T YOU OPEN THE DOOR <br>Is gonna hurt like bricks.</br></br>   next episode is the bestgirl episode <br>Hype.</br>    Is this lewd?  Post Rii-san  <br> I'M SO HUNGRY, SO WHY WON'T YOU JUST OPEN THE DOOR <br><br>I don't think I'm ready to see that after getting more development for Megu-nee.</br></br></br>  Does it follow the manga? First episode was annoying as hell.   Yuki only started enjoying school because all the ones who bullied her died    humanizing Kurumi more by expanding her crush on senpai <br> making Megu-nee a real character instead of a flat-ish twist on chapter 3 <br> giving real depth to Yuki by making it so that she was bullied in school <br>Thank you, based manga writer.</br></br></br>    Do I really have to use the HS release?  <br> humanizing Kurumi more by expanding her crush on senpai <br>How did it expand on her crush at all?</br></br>   got to see day zero in detail <br> got to see Megu-nee and Yuki before the attack <br> Yuki wasn't as energetic and was bullied <br> Yuki confirmed not to know any of the other members before the attack <br> Kurumi confirmed not dating senpai <br> this fucking scene <br><br>Now THIS is how you do an adaptation if you're not doing it 1:1. I just wished they showed the other girl that was on the roof that ran away when she thought Megu-nee was going to scold her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>[stupid noises]</br>  <br> Kurumi realized her lust for blood that day </br>  <br>It's not funi, so it's at least tolerable</br>    remove dog  I dunno, when I was watching during the livewatch thread, opinions were not so favorable.  <br>Screams of sex</br>  Pretty glad to see the anime doing it's own thing. I feel like I might have blown through the manga too quickly when I first read it so I never got the impact a lot of people claim to have. The anime is definitely giving a different enough experience that it's hitting all the right points, even if I have a general idea of the upcoming story details.  <br>Not sure why, it was the best episode so far. Great direction, good art, backgrounds and atmosphere are spot-on and the expanded writing was very nice.</br>  <br>I don't see why. I've been one of the bigger critics of the first two episodes but I fucking loved this one.</br>  after see ep 03 I have again a doubt megu-nee is realy here or just in yuki head?? &gt;&lt;  <br> I feel like I might have blown through the manga too quickly when I first read it so I never got the impact a lot of people claim to have. <br><br>I feel the same too. At least, there's the new chapter coming anytime now.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Everyone was just panicking because of all the changes.</br></br>    <br> yfw the moment when the shovel came down </br>  10/10 VA work.<br><br>Now if only Crunchy didn't look like dogshit.</br></br>  after see ep 03 I have again a doubt megu-nee is realy here or just in yuki head?? &gt;&lt;  <br> It was at that moment Kurumi lost her virginity to shovel-kun <br> Yuki saw it all <br> All the blood <br> The rough pounding in and out <br> In and out <br> In and out </br></br></br></br></br></br>   Kurumifags   So how are yurifags handling the confirmation of Kurumi's heterosexuality? <br><br>Are they pulling the whole "bisexual" thing again despite the fact she only shows romantic attention towards men?</br></br>  <br><br>Because the pacing is starting to seem like they're not gonna adapt graduation and are gonna have an anime original ending.</br></br>  <br>I'm not weir/d/ enough for this.</br>  Skinship.    <br>Is that Komeji?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>At worst it will end in the episode in which Yuki suffers a break down after killing a zombie with the mop.</br>    <br> Are they pulling the whole "bisexual" thing again despite the fact she only shows romantic attention towards men? <br>It's a zombie apocalypse and most men are rapist assholes. That doesn't leave Kurumi many options, and lately she's getting pretty close to Miki.</br></br>  <br>Because<br> WAHHHH NOT 1:1 ADAPTATION <br> WAHHHH THEY DIDN'T [insert anything from the manga] </br></br></br>  <br>No skinship she says.</br>  <br>Aren't all the girls straight?</br>  <br>I pray this will be scanned.</br>  <br>Go away please.<br><br>Yes.</br></br></br>  <br>Nice, but just a tad too large?</br>  <br>That's what graduation is. The rate they're going they're not gonna make it that far, despite it being a natural ending point.</br>  meguu-nee is really here or just yuki head? after EP 3 I have a doubt again... I don't know  <br>literally the second I open the thread<br><br>SPOILERS<br>P<br>O<br>I<br>L<br>E<br>R<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's super obvious</br>  <br> &gt;humanizing Kurumi more by expanding her crush on senpai <br> &gt;making Megu-nee a real character instead of a flat-ish twist on chapter 3 <br> &gt;giving real depth to Yuki by making it so that she was bullied in school <br> Thank you, based manga writer. <br>Sakurai was the one who wrote this episode.<br>She wrote the What a beautiful series of eroge and Fate/Prototype</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> knew people were going to be asking this after this episode </br>  <br>Scared Rii-san</br>  <br>I think after ep 03 "ok she really here...But....maybe not "</br>  <br><br> meguu-nee is really here or just yuki head? after EP 3 I have a doubt again... I don't know <br><br>She's there in the flashback parts of the episode on the first day when the zombie breakout occurs and in the scenes where she's writing in her diary.<br><br>She's not there in the other scenes where the girls give Yuki weird looks and "accidentally" say they have enough room for four instead of five.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rii makes the best faces.</br>  <br>Will we get Mall episode ?<br>Will the dog get zombified ?<br> Will we get second season ? </br></br></br>    <br> Will we get Mall episode ? <br>Didn't you watch the next episode preview?</br></br>  <br>Mall is next.</br>  <br>yeah I know for flashback she here but yeah , I was wondering for other scenes So as I suspected it is right she just in the yuki's head ok...</br>  After this episode I reevaluate my best girl list<br><br>Miki=Kurumi=Megu-nee&gt;Yuki&gt;Rii<br><br>Best sensei ;_______;</br></br></br></br>  <br>the deepest lore</br>  Miki=Kurumi=Yuki=Rii=Megumi  <br><br>Zombie pussy is the best pussy.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, it's not even a question, you can tell by how everyone reacts to Yuki in the scenes with Miki and Taromaru (them being there means Megu-ne's already dead). There's the four instead of five people remark, there's everyone going "oh, Megu-ne's here?" after Yuki says Megu-ne's here (something they wouldn't say if they could actually see her, there's the way Miki talks about everyone really liking Megu-ne which indicates she never really met her, etc.</br></br>  <br> CD player <br><br>Does this show take place in the early 2000s?</br></br></br>   Megu-nee backstory <br> It wasn't even in the manga <br><br>Today was a good day</br></br></br>  <br>yeah... ;_; but I knew I wanted hoped she was still alive although I suspected that not</br>  <br> coming to /a/ for an adaptation of an airing series <br>Either read the manga or it's your own fault.</br></br>  <br><br> opening threads on an adaptation of a manga everyone's already read <br><br> kurumi_posing_like_costanza_with_b<wbr>aseball_bat.bmp</wbr> </br></br></br></br>  If it was so urgent, why didn't her mom just call her?

The final piece and the one Reina and Kumiko play in episode 8 are gorgeous.</br>  This is the blandest anime I've ever seen.<br>It's like k-on, except 100x more boring.</br>   fluffy <br> no Watashi </br>  the fluffiest lesbian    <br>Made this for an MS paint thread.

Others suck.</br>  Friendly reminder that these girls are literally breeding grounds for mites and fleas  <br>People in developed countries do this thing called "bathing", Pablo.</br>  <br>They surely are a breeding ground, but not for fleas.</br>  Does this also apply to fluffy tails?  <br>this</br>    grown kumiko is pure sex    kumiko is a QTko  <br> Proof <br>More like poof, am I right?</br></br>    (posting a few more)  fluffy cake      People are still talking about that fucking euphonium show? And they're still calling it hibike? I'm not surprised.  <br> Kaoru is my favorite Amagami <br>Exquisite taste.</br></br>  <br>And you're still butthurt. I'm not surprised.</br>  <br>I think it sounds weird to use the verb "sound" as an imperative, so unless they come up with a better translation, I'll call it Hibike.</br>  <br>Hibike is a much shorter word than Euphonium, and rolls off the tongue more easily. You can refer to all the characters in the show as hibikes, while if you refer to them as euphoniums, you might cause a confusion since someone might think you're only thinking about the euphonium trio.<br><br>And eupho as short for euphonium just sounds awkward.</br></br></br>  <br>Or you know you can call it Euphonium like everyone else.</br>  Shit, the T's been getting a lot fluffier recently.  <br>So you speak for all euphofags in admitting that you're retarded and an EOP?</br>  <br>Sound! is a stage command, it's not the verb</br>  <br> EOP <br>I'm not to terribly concerned about the opinions of /jp/ rejects, sorry.</br></br>  <br>And what if I want to be special and not like <br> everyone else <br>?</br></br></br>  <br>So you're not concerned about being retarded? Most people seem to get offended at the very thought.</br>    <br>You misread. I said I'm not concerned about a /jp/ reject considering me retarded.</br>  <br>But you clearly are retarded if you think typing the roman characters that spell the japanese word for sound is suitable because you're too lazy to type a 9 letter word.</br>  Such things as are argued about.  <br>I did not need you to explain to me why that post made you angry.</br>  <br>"Why do people use the first word of a title as the shorthand instead of the last word?"</br>  <br>Because they're retarded. What a dumb question.</br>  Needs more poof in here.  You can only pick one side.  <br>Are you even trying?<br><br>Literally a faggot.<br><br>MY DICK<br><br>Good taste too.

It's kinda short so not all of it, but yes. Why?</br>  <br>well then its not as messy as i thought it was. i dont know how having a lot of hair works, ive always had very straight hair, so i cut it a lot</br>  <br>Not quite sure you understand how the word "claim" is being used in the OP.<br><br>It's not claim as in "I now own," it's claim as in "I am making a statement."</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks anon, I thought you were an idiot but you might actually be a nice person</br>  <br>rude tbh :/</br>  <br>Do you remember when you said you imagined me being disgusting?</br>  <br>i didnt say you were disgusting, i said that about the hair. donald is a qt but his hair can still look disgusting.<br><br>maybe disgusting is a bit too powerful of a word</br></br></br>  <br>Ok then.

He ended up keeping the colors for Manako and the multiple skin colors and eyes of Zombina and went with his own idea for the rest.</br>  <br>probably not going to be subspecies of zombies or dopplers</br>  <br>I wish they handled this part better in the anime, we never got to see sexy Papi belly up close like we did in the first episode.<br><br>Papi tummy best tummy.</br></br></br>  <br>Cyclops: 4 variants of Manako all using their text descriptions to hid their faces.</br>  <br> picking anything but "work in a lab with Suu as your chemical waste disposal unit" <br><br>It's like you faggots don't want to do SCIENCE!</br></br></br>  Ok, looking at the stalker points and how people on 2ch/niconico reacts to MonMusume seems like the adaptation is very popular. If Lerche is going to adapt like 20 chapters of the manga that leaves at least 15 chapters away and if the BD-DVD sales goes well we can think about a second season I guess.  We can all agree Zombie and Fish are worst.  <br>No fish is second best</br>  <br>Considering how well the series is doing I'd say a second season is basically guaranteed.</br>  <br>Murderfish will continue to be worse girl unless something in the newer chapters makes her somehow redeemable.</br>  <br>lets not get cocky</br>  <br>I checked a poll on Nico page and they said Monster Musume is like an Idol franchise.</br>  <br>I love how the print ads for the anime said <br><br>"They said it was a niche!

If he studio doesn't make an S2 or explode this on OVA's and stuff to sell is because they are retarded.</br>  <br><br>Well, you say she is the SUUperior Waifu</br></br>  <br>Listen here you little spic.</br>  <br>Suu?</br>  <br>how are the bd sales?</br>  <br> crab man's panic goes into overtime when they ask him for a second season </br>  <br>Not me, I find that kind of attitude childish.</br>  <br>I just want to make love to giant Suu.</br>  <br>Non-existent until September.</br>  I'm the only one who can't stop looking at this image?

Where will you be without your memes, /a/? WHERE WILL YOU BE WITHOUT YOUR MEMES, XYZ SCUM?</br></br></br></br>  <br>is Dennis actually a fusion nigger?</br>  <br>I'm concerned that whenever Ruri is finally reunited with Shun, that he's going to hug her so hard that it crushes her ribs and kills her.

Dennis has managed to not set off any alarm bells other than Crazed Imouto Man's "LDS shouldn't be good" alarm bells.</br>  <br>The more I think about, the more I'm inclined to agree.</br>  <br>what if he is from standard, but Leo/Yuri contacted him to be his personal spy?</br>  When will be the next time Yuya summons Odd-Eyes EGAO Dragon?  <br>that's what I've been thinking</br>  <br>A double agent huh.</br>  <br>When he jumps on this next against his first actual Friendship Cup opponent<br> tfw fucking around in your spare time and drawing a D-Wheel for some reason <br> tfw Yuya's turns out to look just like it <br>whoah man</br></br></br></br>  I don't care if she isn't the best, I want to run this qt in Performapals.  <br>He isnt true XYZ.

It makes sense.  <br>Damn, anon, now I'm going to be sad if this doesn't happen.</br>  <br>no, i was using that as a figure of speech, sorry, all the other fusions(ritual beast only all others are filthy) are the same color, I've order them all fro the same site, maybe it is a regional thing.</br>  <br>Why not Reiji operating it?</br>  <br> Reiji <br> doing stuff ON SCREEN while he could be doing whatever plot needs offscreen <br>It's like you don't get his character.</br></br></br>  <br>he has nothing else but his mission to protect the little shota, he lost his home,his brother soon...he'll lose himself.</br>  <br> Reiji <br> Doing anything other than keikaku doori <br>Kekel my shekel mate</br></br></br>  <br>Ninjabro runs around the track while Reira rides piggyback</br>  <br>Reiji's character is him sitting back doing nothing 90% of the time and then appearing before everyone and pretending everything went according to his "plan".</br>  <br><br>I just want some sibling bonding between them or something...</br></br>  YAMEROOOOO  <br>Why would he need to operate the D-Wheel if it's on autopilot</br>  <br>Was getting Tsukikage to duel part of his master plan?</br>  What's the point of dueling on a D-Wheel if it's on autopilot?  <br>It's Arc-V, I'm not going to take the time to explain shit</br>  <br>There is no point, it's just another gimmick.</br>  <br>Tell me about Reiji why does he not wear socks!</br>  <br>It would be extremely painful...</br>  <br>5D Nostalgia bait.</br>  <br>If I make him wear socks will it itch?</br>  <br>So Reiji is Aizen?</br>  I HATE HOW A CARD CAN BE SO LOW ATK AND LEVEL  <br>WHO WOULD EVER USE SUCH A WEAK CARD</br>  <br>Shut up Sam and read the card.</br>  <br>SOMEBODY GAVE ME THIS SHIT BACK IN THE DAY<br>TRADED IT FOR A BLUE EYES, BEST TRADE EVER</br></br>  <br>Why would he? City is obviously card game America. You can tell who is important from City by their names being Japanese.</br>  <br>Too bad its banned.</br>  <br>Shinji is like the only one with a japanese name though</br>  <br>Thank god Konami cares enough about the game that they'd never let anyone accidentally play such a garbage card with weak attack and low level</br>  <br>Yugo and Rin too, I guess.</br>  <br> Hugo  <br> probably Lynn or something equally retarded </br></br>  <br>Don't forget Chojiro</br>  <br>And it's a fusion of 2 even weaker cards. Why would anyone use this trash?</br>  Man, I hope Yuya doesn't go into edge mode anymore. His screams when it happens sound extremely painful. Especially one he let out when Sora carded Red Ninja. It sounded like he had been stabbed.  <br>Kensho Ono loves doing suffering, Yuya needs to be more mindbroken if anything.</br>  <br><br> The only Synchros who will survive Academia's assault will be these two. <br><br>How would that make you feel /a/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bullshit. Just like that Shun VS Sora rematch. There is no possible way the people at Academia can take down Crow or Jack, and if Chojiro pulls out No Cheating Allowed, no one can stop him either.</br>  <br>I hope Yuya fuses with Yugo as well for even more suffering and pained screams. They're absolutely delicious.</br>  <br>How would No Cheating Allowed mess up Fusions. They don't even need to swarm the field to pull from the Extra Deck.</br>  How can a single man be this based every time he speaks?  <br>Inherited from Kaiba</br>  <br>Yuzu's virginity wouldn't be safe if Yuya fused with Yugo.</br>  <br>Nigga please. Kaiba is great and all but he has nothing on Jack being hammy and dramatic.</br>  <br>Kaiba's outright dickery is more than a match for Jack's drama</br>  <br>But does Kaiba have  ABSOLUTU POWAH FOHCE </br>  <br>Does he need it? <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-J4<wbr>j9nbDvkE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  FUCK<br>CASTEL</br>  <br> Ancient Gearfags  <br> laying a finger on Blackwings and KINGU </br></br>  <br>They could always bring along a little extra help.</br>  <br> Yuri <br> laying a finger on Blackwings and KINGU </br></br>  <br>I want to lick Yuri's eyebrows.</br>  <br>NO FUCK THAT<br>KILL WHOEVER MADE CASTEL</br></br>  <br>Jack may be a traitor but he also believes in justice and I don't think he'd hold back or take kindly to an eggplant harming little girls at night</br>  <br>Do people honestly think Yuri can compare to Jack or Crow? <br><br>He's dueled what? Two scrubs, and three Ruris? I think people have been hyping up his power too much. And at this point I don't even think he can take down Yuya or Yugo.</br></br></br>  CHAARGE SHITE BOMBA  <br>But does Jack also hold a determination to fist?</br>  <br>That'd actually redeem some of this Synchro arc if we get Jack punching someone <br><br>Anyone honestly.</br></br></br>  <br>Especially Sam</br>  <br>It's for people who don't know how to use them, you still have to give it throttle and manually do turn and shit if you want to manage to get the first turn.</br>  <br>If this two don't reunite in ep 70 i will get really depressed</br>  <br>Yugo would definitely have won the Yuzu bowl then.</br>  <br><br> Implying Reira won't get one of those cool skateboards Rua used </br></br>  <br>The best bland there is.

But it's okay because she's a cute girl.</br>  <br>Consider suicide.</br>  <br>its the background image for pixiv accounts.</br>  Ebina is the only good reason to watch this series.  <br>Fuck off, secondary scum.</br>  What is wrong with Kirie? is it just repressed lesbianism or a deep and server autism  Would you use it as an onahole?  <br>I agree the rest of the girls are complete shit especially Kirie I wish she would just get fucked and die already also not looking forward to blue hair eternal #2's episode</br>  <br>Same shitter.</br>  So is next week gonna be Sylphy's episode?<br>Will everyone fall in love with her next?</br>  <br>Yes.<br>Then, hopefully, they'll cycle back around to the Umaru redemption chapters.</br></br>  <br>she seems like a shit character but I will give her a chance but it will be hard to top Ebina.</br>  <br>Ebina is a spineless shit. Literally the Mikuru of this show.</br>  I can't help but skip the parts with Ebina, she's too damn boring and bland.    <br> B-BUT MUH BEWBS </br>  <br> all that shit <br><br>for what purpose<br><br>also<br><br> RWBY </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is Kirie ever going to thank Alex?

These are important questions.  <br> Lotus Juice gets another rap in an OP </br>    <br>now give her red m&amp;m's face</br>  Am I the only one that enjoys Umaru's tantrums?  <br>I do, but that's because I'm not the target of them.</br>  <br>get out</br>  <br>I wish he'd shut her up with a good dick in her mouth</br>  <br>I love them so much, I keep rewatching them. Her chibi form and her voice are perfect.</br>  The fact she is literally good at everything while spending every waking moment surfing the net and playing gamers outside of school confuses me.<br>This clishey is actually kinda annoying.</br>  <br>Never underestimate the magic ticket to life known as Talent.</br>  <br>pmt</br>  <br>At the same time you can also agree that Umaru herself became a lot better by the time she started hanging out with Sylph too.</br>  <br>Talent is a made up concept.<br>At best you can have slightly better genetics than someone else and be physically better by a small %.<br>But everything else comes from hard work and dedication.<br>And no mater how talented you are you cant be best at literally everything if you spend 99% of your free time just playing games and doing nothing.</br></br></br></br>  Ebina is the cutest, That banging body.<br>Sexy as fuck dialect.<br><br>Give it to me.</br></br></br>  <br>And as always Lelouch has the worst taste.</br>  Same reason you would have a guinea pig/hamster  <br>talent &lt; effort &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; talent+effort</br>  1) Ebina<br>2) Umaru<br>3) Blue haired sparkle bitch<br>90000000000000000000001) Le autism meme girl</br></br></br>  Do you think Umaru posts on imageboards?<br> &gt;Be at home <br> &gt;Onii-chan gets home <br> &gt;Ask him for Last Fantasy 15 <br> &gt;He says no <br> Why is he so evil?! Do other little sisters have onii-chans like this? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Only your last line is true. Talent is very real, especially with things like academics. If you are born with a better intellect and memory, you will naturally do better in school than those who are less talented, even if you don't spend much time studying at all.</br></br>  <br>She seems like she for sure posts with a trip</br>  <br> &gt;This one girl keeps making weird faces at me <br> &gt;I think she is gay for me and wants to fuck me <br> &gt;What do? </br></br></br>  <br> talent isn't real <br><br>lmao buttmad ""nurture"" beta cuck detected<br>Why don't you get back to spend every waking minute of your life practicing shit that everyone else can do perfectly naturally</br></br></br></br>  I just read all chapters available and holy shit, I can't believe this thing has an actual plot going on.<br> Ebina's   brother leaving his home when Ebina was 7. <br> Umaru's development and realization that she's lying to her only true friends and her onii-chan is way too goddamn nice to everyone <br> Everything about Alex <br> Hikari <br> Why does Umaru live with Taihei? <br> Why the mother flashbacks?

Stay mad.</br>  <br>oh</br>  <br>only except there are only three episodes. it is not elitism. factually, people who have read the manga would know more than a person who has not even seen all three episodes</br>  This is important: Should I go to sleep or pull an all nighter? It's 2AM and if I go to sleep now I'll probably oversleep.  <br>you're up just in time for early morning chinese cartoons</br>  Why did the girls in the horror movie look like more realistic japs than the actual characters  <br>stylistic differences, it's a movie</br>  <br>they look just as bug eyed as everyone else<br>what are you talking about</br></br>  <br>It's a reference joke.</br>  <br>Ebina wants that d so badly</br>  What if being defeated was exactly what Doffei was aiming for ?  Perona a cute  <br> I am retarded <br>Good for you</br></br>  <br>I just noticed on pic related that the WG gives no fucks if human slaves aren't from allied countries, Wano slaves when?</br>  <br>Doesn't mean Akainu couldn't draft him from there in some way</br>  <br>Why the fuck would they care ? If you're not with them, you're against them. And Wano has been strong enough to hold out on their own.</br>  <br>It just seems cold to basically let unallied countries get fucked up and enslaved by pirates but that is how the WG rolls I suppose.</br>  <br>You can buy 11 mermaids for all the money you'd collect from beating the entire Strawhat crew.  And you can keep Chopper, too! </br>  <br>Yea, it seems cold to fucking erase an island from the face of the planet because a bunch of people could read moon language. The WG ain't all sunshine and buttercups, sadly.</br>  <br>retoasting in new bread:<br><br><br>but wasn't the void century several hundred years ago?<br><br>We are talking at least 25 generations if not more. After 25 Generations the amount of "D" left in your bloods is nonexistant.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes that is true. What's different about them and Monet/Sugar, though, is that THEY were shown in the Law Flashback. This indicated their presence with the crew in the past, and they had no SBS mention. Monet and Sugar were not present, BUT they were mentioned in the SBS through it as in explicitly having a backstory. If their backstory isn't important, why aren't they present with Dofla during Law's past?<br><br>'Well they hadn't joined yet' you might say, but why have them both join later, if it didn't matter? 'So Law wouldn't recognize Monet during Punk Hazard' you could say, but why establish the sisterhood with Sugar too? 'Because Law didn't know about Sugar either, so she was introduced at the same time' but none of the rest of the crew is blood-related save Dofla's brother, and we know what happened there.<br><br>This just adds more and more questions with each layer of explanation, all in part to explain WHY Sugar and Monet don't matter. And remember, it does matter enough to be explained. Oda specifically said something about them, he specifically made them absent. There's a lot less hoops to jump through to say it IS important and WILL be addressed, than to say it's NOT important and won't be addressed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or you could just beat Luffy and buy 400 fishmen to be pirate nakama. Fishman strength is 10x a human so you're basically buying 4000 dudes.</br>  <br>I just replied to that 3 seconds ago.</br>  <br>Holy shit, OP threads really hit quality wise the bottom.<br>If you don't have anything to talk about, let it rest.</br></br>  <br>Yea, good luck managing 400 people stronger than you, who'd break your neck the first chance they got.</br>  <br>But you bought them. What kind of self-respecting slave would go against the power of commerce?</br>  <br>Hey I'm a saviour to these poor fishmen, I bankrupt myself to buy their broke ass and all I demand in return is a little bit of backup,c'mon.</br>  <br>Since when where you under the illusion that I am not retarded ?</br>  <br>well I suppose it could be possible, seeing as we never saw any D. have interest in "regular women" so far. Maybe it's in their blood to only like other D. women.<br><br>I mean Law was also the only one shown to have 0 interest while he and his crew were on the Kuja island.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah, if you 'bought' them, you humiliate them. Your best bet is to free them and keep the people who wants to stick around.<br><br><br>Would makes sense too since Roger definitely knew then meaning of D. Which makes me wonder about what WB said to Teach. Since Teach is like a typical pirate and was being all creepy towards Bonney, he probably raped some poor girl, right ? Maybe WB knew about it and that could be another reason why Teach wasn't the guy Roger was looking for. Or something like that, I don't know.<br><br>Or it could mean Bonney is a D. too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Or it could mean Bonney is a D. too. <br><br>Or that she got the D from Marshal D Teach. Jokes aside, has there been any kind of sexual violence in OP. implied or at all? It seems strange for a series about pirates to not have non-consensual dickings.</br></br></br>  <br>if you can beat Luffy 400 fishmen shouldn't be a challenge for you</br>  <br>Maybe with Robin and the Boa sisters and the Celestial Dragons. Otherwise, not really. And let's be real fucking honest, there isn't a whole load of "real" piratey stuff in OP other than stealing treasure.</br>  <br>Yea, but that's just one fight. I mean, if you don't have Whitebeard type CoO, you'd probably get killed while sleeping.</br>  <br>Sorry for /r/ing, but are there any good Zoro x Perona doujins? Or is there only that 1 weird one which focuses more on Luffy?</br>  <br>Don't you know powerful characters can't be killed by fodder, anon? It's like thinking bullets actually kill people,cannonballs can hit anything or be destructive and that DF users can drown.</br>  So, how about that Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Fetus?  <br>Huh. I suppose you probably would have some major CoO and CoA if you beat Luffy. But still, 400 fishmen ?</br>  <br>400 fishmen cower in the presence of Buggy "Pirate Kingslayer" Clown.</br>  There needs to be a filler arc where Chopper gets switched out with a midget who ate the Deer Deer Fruit, Blue-Nosed Reindeer model.    <br>Whitebeard was fatally stabbed by Squardo.<br>Pistols were used to killing blow him.<br>Bellemere was a better fighter than pre skip Luffy, but Arlong was bulletproof and she wasn't.<br>When Robin boarded the going merry Sanji pulled a pistol on her, meaning he has one.<br>Shanks whole crew has pistols and used them to kill mountain bandits in chapter 1.<br>Doffy killed his father and Corazon with a pistol.<br>Oarz was mostly killed by cannon fire.<br>Garp's strongest known attack is Meteor Canon, where he throws canonballs</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  forgotpic  how can capone be a supernova and manage in the new world? he's "just" a walking fortress with several hundreds of regular men which can be a big deal in babby seas but wouldn't be an issue for anyone strong enough to survive new world, let alone strong DFs  <br> Bellemere was a better fighter than pre-skip Luffy <br><br>please elaborate</br></br></br>  <br> Shanks whole crew has pistols and used them to kill mountain bandits in chapter 1. <br><br>This was most likely before Oda properly established the powerlevels hence why Shanks got his arm bitten off by some weak ass sea king.<br><br> Garp's strongest known attack is Meteor Canon, where he throws canonballs <br><br>That's just garp being garp, rather than someone actually firing a cannon.<br><br> Pistols were used to killing blow him. <br><br>Only after WB got fucked up beforehand, pistols couldn't touch him even in his old weakened state.<br><br>I agree with the rest though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Worst concept for a hito variation ever.<br>I'd rather see these.<br> Model: Neanderthal <br> Model: Golem <br> Model: Devil <br> Model: Angel <br> Model: Leprechaun <br> Model: Sasquatch </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 4kidz changing the gun in that scene for a shovel </br>  <br> Model: Leprechaun <br>How the fuck would that even work?</br></br>  <br>Didn't he shrink cannonballs once that were fired at him to put them inside his fortress? Capones got a niche in being very mobile and probably has the element of surprise but other than that I don't understand how he survives with scrub pirates. Probably some crazy haki or some awakened bullshit.</br>  <br>I know what you meant but<br> Oarz <br>That niggah froze to death. You're thinking of Oarz Jr.</br></br></br>  <br>Element of Surprise ? He probably has other skills too. I highly doubt he's a one trick pony.<br><br>  <br> before Oda properly established the powerlevels <br>Herewegoagain.jpg</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's what Lucky Roo has. My cousin's dog is Oda's middle name.</br>  <br>Whereas Luffy got stuck in concrete, thrown in alike, and rescued by Sanji,Bellemere easily tackled Arlong and shot him inside his mouth.<br><br>The difference is both Luffy and Arlong are bulletproof. Only reason she would lose to them/only reason she did lose to Arlong.<br>Don't forget Bellemere was a Marine</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe I could have phrased it a bit more eloquently but Shanks back then probably wasn't planned to be some badass cream of the crop pirate that was on the Pirate King's crew. There's no excuse why he had sacrificed his arm besides damage control bullshit.</br>  Everyone remember to do their best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>No, it's cool, I get where you're coming from. It's just that people might get triggered over your choice of words.</br>  <br>Penguin is a gay fag and I hope he and the rest of Law's shitty crew die.</br>  <br>Luffy barged in and hit Arlong straight in the face and sent him flying. He only got stuck in concrete because he's slow, not because he was a worse fighter than Bellemere.</br>  <br>Save Jean Bart/Bepo none of Law's crew look remotely threatening.<br><br>Maybe that's why Law left them on that island.<br>They're shit in a fight.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>In the manga it is NOT shown how Shanks loses his arm. He appears and his arm is already lost.<br>Higuma is shown on panel tone faster than shanks whole crew, he west not shown to be eaten, therefore he is alive.</br></br></br>  Reminder Law is a   Great singer  <br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=im_<wbr>daAwkZw4</wbr>  [ ] </br>    <br>Oh, ok. Yeah I can see how that choice of words can start a 100+ post shitposting tirade.</br>  <br>she attacked him through a closed door, arlong wasn't prepared. I just reread the chapter, Bellemere even said: 'i can't fight them, they are too strong'</br>  both the higher ups of the marine and the gorosei seem to not like tenryufaggots much, why don't they do a coup and take control? nobles may have direct control on cipher pol but marine got fucking admirals  <br>higuma is kaido</br>  yellow monkey is the strongest admiral  <br>Luffy is physically stronger, but less skilled, pre skip. His initial hit didn't even phase arlong, doing maybe the same damage as bellemere Rifle.</br>  <br><br>That's mean anon, I know Shachi's a slut, but calling Law's crew shitty, that's going too far.</br></br>  <br>probably some super secret reason, just like how they couldnt kill dofla...<br><br>cp0 might be as strong as the 3 admirals, too, and in that case they might lose control and weaken the WG enough to shatter it, with the yonkou and pirates sweeping into the power void.</br></br></br>  <br>The Nationsl Treasure, perhaps. And the CDragons probably know about the true history as well, which the WG does not want anyone to know.</br>  <br>They were too strong, being bulletproof</br>  <br>I want to see this motherfucker with the Angel one. Imagine him growing wings that are like Angel's from X-Men and fighting Zoro while flying</br>  <br>Yes, Luffy's punch did about the same as a rifle. And you say Bellemere is a better fighter than Luffy. I don't even.</br>  <br>it'd be appropriate considering gandhi's reputation, too<br>also lewd dubdubs</br></br>  <br>Anon pls</br>  <br>One might say<br> Angel vs Demon <br><br>Who's the Angel one btw ?</br></br></br></br>  Enies Lobby was great    <br>The only reason they couldn't kill Doffy is if he is an ancient weapon.<br> king of birds </br></br>  <br> Doctor <br> Germaphobe <br> putting your feet near food <br>Nope.</br></br></br></br>  <br>am i beeing trolled?

My bad, sorry.</br>  <br> Germaphobe <br>One Piece Party author pls go</br></br>  <br>Arlong bit the barrel of her gun straight off before she could shoot though IIRC.</br>  <br> Ceasar's factory gets destroyed <br> Kaido is probably already killing Doffy, even if his factory in Dressroba still intact due to being late on shipments. <br> Know Luffy's track record for never killing his opponents. <br> Gets Luffy angry. <br> Gets rekt. <br> Gets taken to safety in Impel Down. Even Kaido isn't crazy enogh to fuck with that. <br> Reveals that his plan succeeded on the way to ID on the marine ship. <br> Kaido is now focusing only on the Lawhats. <br> Plans to break out later in prison. <br> Not even planning a revenge, because he was pulling the strings all along. <br>The only loose cannon in his plan was Law. That asshole was really trying to kill him all along.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's still a Doctor, dude. Nigga don't have to be a germaphobe to know putting your bloody shoes near food is dirty.</br>  <br> realises Crocodile isn't in ID any more <br> I didn't think this through </br></br>  <br> He's still a Doctor, dude. <br>He's also a pirate which counteracts that pussy shit</br></br>  <br>I guess you're right, posting that triggered my memory, my bad anon.<br>I still say her skill level&gt; Luffy.<br>She said she was no strong enough to fight "them."<br>Luffy only defeated Arlong, and only with a sudden ass pull burst of strength he didn't have. Before the end of the fight. Zoro beat Haachi, Usopp beat Chuu, and Sanji beat karate fish.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Whoever taught Law did a shit job. Guess he got what was coming for him.</br>  <br> ass pull burst of strength <br>You might as well have used a trip called "Baiter McMach20son"</br></br>  Can sanji get anymore gayer? Udall is manlier than him  <br>Reread the Arlong fight. Luffy suddenly, out of nowhere, becomes way stronger and breaks a steel harabachi with his grip whereas before he couldn't break out of concrete.</br>  <br>You might have noticed that Luffy was confused, blinded, being goofy, underwater and then pissed off.</br>  <br>Fuck that. I hate insects too. Godless creatures. Fuck them all. Even a butterfly would freak me out as a child.</br>  <br>He IS a walking fortress with a whole army, ton of weapons and who knows what else inside. In a one-on-one fight, if he can reduce size of objects, what stops him from shrinking an opponent to tiny size and simply crushing him? Good enough power for me.<br>Besides, he seems to be a scheming type, not the one that has to kick every other ass to establish dominance. He'll be totally fine joining some major force.</br></br>  <br>look, it's the Jurassic park meme.</br>  where did the "D are aylmaos" theory come from? it seems a bit more retarded than the usual shit you guys come up with  <br>that's kawaii</br>  <br> Implying that wasn`t oda true vision and jump fuck it up <br><br>newfag alert</br></br></br>  <br>This makes my fujo blood boil</br>  <br>D represents one half of the moon, descendants of the ancient kingdom. Apparently some guy who was going to do an article on the one piece website had to get his theory censored, possibly because it hits too close to home. Pretty sure the guy in question is Greg from the one piece podcast.</br>  How come we don't have any women admirals? Fishman island was all about diversity and equality and luffy likes diversity in his crews and enemies so why no women admiral. After the dressrosa arc with rebecca and oda saying mom is the opposite of adventure I'm starting to believe he's a misogynist.

I love my waifu, not her shit, and definitely not the shit of her bacteria.</br>  <br> How can Capone manage in the New World <br>Have you read anything post time skip yet? Plenty of shitters exist in the New World. Hell, most of the people in the tourney that were considered "elite" could probably get their asses kicked by Capone.

The only thing is to see how long before Big Mom gets that information.<br><br>I don't think we'll get any new nakama post dressrosa. All the spots luffy has wanted are fulfilled, apart from that Luffy wants oddities and now Kinemon isn't just an ass and legs, he doesn't generate that curiosity in Luffy. Jinbe was different since Luffy and Jinbe are almost brothers now, not to mention he's a fishman so he's an oddity in most of the real world.<br><br>Also this <br>I wouldn't find very exciting. The theory of 'D' being descendants of 'Devil' who was the creator or from whom the devil fruits come from seems better to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, what ?

Monsters is what a lot of people are getting the 'Zoro is related to Ryuuma' thing.</br>  <br>What letter would you use?</br>    <br> D stands for devil <br> interesting <br>Really? That's the first thing everyone goes for. What makes that more exciting?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, I'm more interested in Devil's motivations and way of thinking than things being tied to moon again, just like Naruto ended up doing. And I just find hellic scenery more appealing although I don't know if we'll ever get that in One piece.</br>   The D, which is the half moon is only "One Piece".   <br>this is a translated story from Japanese so I don't think it is a letter but a smile, which is more thematically relevant</br>  <br>Here we go<br><br>This covers most of the points that were brought up</br></br></br>  <br> people learning that the Celestial Dragons mortal enemy is hell itself will inspire them to go to war with the former <br> Knowledge that the World Government destroyed hell is dangerous <br><br>I can't wrap my head around it. Why would the WG not let people know that the D stands for devil and that Satan opposes the Government? That seems like something that would draw them closer to the government.</br></br></br></br>  <br>With names like "Monkey, Dragon, Marco, Edward Newgate, Zoro, Brook, Robin, Franky, Marshal Teach, Roger, Silvers Rayleigh, Boa, Donquixote, Dracule Mihawk, Vista, Ace, Rouge, Benn Beckman, Leo, Trafalgar Law, Eustass, Killer, Capone, Bonney" and so, so, so much more, a D being English isn't all that far fetched.</br>  <br> giant women <br> less than giant men <br>It's like Disco was gay or something.</br></br></br>  <br> most of the points that were brought up <br> only one section talked about what the D represented, most was dedicated to the importance of moon people having descended to Earth with advanced technology and being wiped out by the government <br><br>While I doubt most people were even aware of (or remembered) the whole "all sky people came from the moon", the theory of them being the country that was destroyed seems pretty far out there relative to how much people on this board seem to actually remember/piece together from the manga</br></br></br></br>  <br>its implied that moon language could end the world so its justified.</br>  <br>What if Greg is missattributing the evidence that Uranus is Enel and the Endless Vearth to being One Piece?<br><br>Luffy may very well have shandian ancestry, and Usopp blood from LVNEEL (Norland the Hero's native country), but this just ties up and parallels the Norland/Shandian Warrior.<br>Time will tell</br></br></br></br>  <br>at that size they are meant for labor</br>  <br> satan <br><br>If D is the Devil, it's the Sea Devil: Davey Jones.</br></br></br>  <br>Are we certain Big Mom is Lolas mother?</br>  <br>And Zoro's from Birka! Yes! I knew the Bro Trio would be super important.</br>  <br>All of it's about the theory that Greg posted years ago and the possible hints with the Volume 27 cover. The rest of it was the story about how he tried to publish an article on the subject and he got rejected from fairly high up. He's never been censored in anything else he's written for One-Piece.com or V-Jump.<br><br>Everything else that was linked to it was in the OPP article.<br><br>It's all just a theory at the moment but it's got a lot more weight than most.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>pic related is</br>  <br> yfw   Tashigi ate the Yuki Yuki no Mi while freeing the other G5s and her trying to control Smoker's DF was foreshadowing </br>  <br>Where was that confirmed?</br>  <br>Monet's already hanging with a new crew.</br>  <br>It wasn't. Disregard everything.<br><br>Nothing's been revealed. It's all speculation.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe Wano was renamed from Birka at some point? I think Zoro is without doubt the descendent of Ryuuma.</br>  <br> I think Zoro is without doubt the descendent of Ryuuma. <br>yeah but we dont know how back or where his decendants traveled.</br></br>  <br> knows she stands no chance against Zoro <br> knows she almost lost to Snow Logia <br> knows how easily Zoro could have killed Snow Logia <br> I'm gonna eat the Snow Logia! </br></br></br></br>  <br>lola definitely would've mentioned if her mother was a Yonkou. the subject probably would've been raised at Marineford too.<br>it's too predictable and obvious a route to go, too. "big mom" literally being lola's mom. everyone's thought of it.<br><br>remember that i was right when oda reveals the truth.</br></br></br></br>  <br>based on what?<br><br>Sell it to me.<br><br>Bonus points if it's not fanfiction tier</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I think <br> without doubt </br></br>  <br>Yes. It was Checkhov's Gun. The only pirates considerable as "strong" in comparison to the straw hats are the yonko and supernova.</br>  <br> implying it'd be intentional <br> implying Oda won't turn it into a gag </br></br>  <br>Oh sure dude I'll remember that one anon who made a post about Lola not being Big mom's daughter. <br>Faggot.</br></br>    <br>brutha ur only mad b/c u know im right<br>the more mad u get, the more certain u are to remember i was right :^)</br></br>  <br>What  said. Same with Usopp's and Luffy's ancestors. Who knows, Norland travelled to Jaya and Green Bit. Maybe Birka was part of Wano before it got blasted. I doubt it, since they don't have wings.</br>  <br> everyone's thought of it. <br>That's definitely points against the theory. It's well known that Oda fucking hates being guessed. If that even might have been the original plan, there's a good chance he'd have changed it.<br><br>Could well be related to that Marineford pic instead. It's a less popular theory</br></br></br></br>  <br>He looks like Ryuuma.<br>Ryuuma personally gave him his sword.<br>Ryuuma is depicted defeating the Sunflower Knight at the end of Monsters.<br>Mihawk is a very outright mirror of said defeated opponent, with sunflowers literally drawn on his clothes.<br><br>All of the theory posted is fan fiction until confirmed in canon, not just the ones that disagree with yours.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It wouldn't be the first time something obvious was foreshadowed and then the expected thing happened.<br><br>I remember saying this when people said Sabo wasn't alive, too.</br></br></br>  <br>The people in thriller bark said Lola's mother was an amazing pirate and surely would be able to help if Strawhat needed any in the new world. What sort of pirate would have that much influence? <br><br>Not to mention this is One Piece, the characters talk about stupid shit for hours on end and never mention the real details only to be surprised and go 'EHHHHHH?!' when it pops up.</br></br></br>  <br>Would she have killed him, if she had pulled the trigger?</br>  <br>the theory was all over Narutoforums when lola's introductory chapter was introduced, but somehow everyone forgot about it by now.<br><br>most notably lola uses the words 'an infamous new world pirate' to describe her mom, and when elmy is introduced as a Whitebeard ally, she's described using those exact words: 'an infamous new world pirate'<br><br>she also seems to summon a clay golem to fight Kizaru in the chapter where Luffy fights Mihawk.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ryuuma and Zoro also both behead a dragon.</br>  <br>Based on what Ryuuma and Zoro looks like, I'd assume. And their similarities. And the dragon. And the sword choosing Zoro.<br><br><br>You'd think Tashigi is smart enough to know what a DF looks like. Then again, she's blind as shit. I guess that's confirmed!</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck, i mean elmy's introductory chapter<br>10 pm = brain todt</br></br>  <br>Also the fact that the way Sanji and the crew are fucked right now, what thing could possibly save them from Big Mom's crew?<br><br>The only bullshit I can think of is the Lola card that Nami can pull.</br></br></br>  <br> looks like Ryuuma <br>I can't really argue that although both were made very early on and both were swordsmen <br> Ryuuma personally gave him his sword <br>Because Zoro is a good fighter? I can't see what evidence that gives, he didn't just hand it over.<br> Ryuuma is depicted defeating the Sunflower Knight at the end of Monsters. <br>Mihawk is a very outright mirror of said defeated opponent, with sunflowers literally drawn on his clothes.<br><br>This is where I really can't see it. Cyrano was a scumbag who was destroyed by Ryuuma and was a thief. Mihawk is none of those things and his relationship with Zoro in no way mirrors Ryuuma's with Cyrano.<br><br>I'm not the one you replied to, nor am I trying to go out of my way to disprove your theory, your basis just seems off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He looks like Ryuuma. <br>Not really solid enough. That was hundreds of years ago. Young Roger looks like Luffy and they aren't related.<br><br> Ryuuma personally gave him his sword. <br>That's quite debatable actually. The Arrow Notch Slash move, personality, laugh and voice are Brooks. How much of Ryuuma's personality was really in there? It was Brook's shadow. I'd wager that it was a mixture of both.<br><br> Ryuuma is depicted defeating the Sunflower Knight at the end of Monsters. <br> Mihawk is a very outright mirror of said defeated opponent, with sunflowers literally drawn on his clothes <br>Definitely a good detail but were not entirely sure how long Monsters was a part of One Piece. Could have been intended from the start. Could have been an idea he had from much later.<br><br>I'll be honest, I don't hate the idea. There's just not really too much going for it. I guess soon enough we'll get more clues if there are any.<br><br><br>I'd like to check if the phrasing is exactly the same in Japanese for both instances. If it is, I'd definitely take that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Laffite has that. Sorry to ruin your dreams.</br>  <br> clay golem  <br>what's the relevancy?</br></br>  Franky makes a better Sanji than Sanji does himself  <br><br>Ryuuma's body knew he was a pretty major Samurai and he could sense the feeling of fighting a huge beast when facing Zoro. And Zoro ended up defeating Ryuuma with a "Dragon" attack.</br></br>  <br>And that implies relation how exactly?</br>  when  <br>Sure, it mirrors the fight in monsters, I still don't really see it as Zoro being related to Ryuuma.<br><br>If Oda wanted to include Ryu, who would fight him? Zoro, obviously. If Oda wanted to reference earlier work, it'd make sense for the fight to have similarities as well. Maybe Zoro is actually the reincarnation of the dragon Ryuuma killed?<br><br>I also still don't see a connection between Mihawk and Cyrano. The latter was a thief and a shitter who got one shot, the former trained Zoro and acts entirely different. Mihawk has less to do with flowers than Vista.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would he need that stupid shit when he already has Kyuutoryu?</br>  <br>Not talking about the relation. Talking about how Brook's shadow was quite aware of whose body he had. And that other Anon said "Ryuuma personally gave him the sword". I believe it was the Sword who chose Zoro. It's master was already dead and being inhabitated by another will.</br>  <br>I'll fight you</br>  <br>because then he could have 15-sword style</br>  <br>I'm not the guy who was talking about that. But, to be fair, Mihawk is still a pirate and a dick to almost every body. I don't think Cyrano is Mihawk's mirror.</br>  So what are the theories to Zoro's left eye?<br>Something like Rayleighs right eye?<br>Some power Zoro has yet to reveal?<br>Just any old injury?<br>Sharingan?</br></br></br></br>  Why are the yonkous so retarded? If the 4 of them united, they would destroy the fucking navy and pretty much split the world in 4 and then try to claim the world  <br>i don't think that's what it is, i just think it looks pretty badass.</br>  <br>It's simply blind but opening it gives him the atmosphere of being serious as fuck with blurred lines and darker colors in one panel.</br>  <br>he lost it training with Mihawk<br>when the Strawhats reunited, Franky built him a robot eye that either shoots lasers or lets him hold a fourth sword</br></br>  <br>why do they all have tontatta noses</br>  <br>Either something like Rayleigh's, where it's just taking time to heal or any old injury. I think Oda was testing out some scars for Zoro in the TS concept art thingy and the Eye scar wasn't really a staple.</br>  <br>Because they're all little.</br>  One Piece is a knock up stream to the Moon.<br><br>Luffys final boss is Enel.</br></br>  Accept nami is a woman you fucking moron. There's nothing to indicate she a guy  <br>The thing is though, wouldn't they just have talked about it if it were just an injury?<br>Something like <br> what happened to your eye <br> mihawk recked it <br><br>Isn't Oda waiting to reveal that there is something special with that eye?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll show you a knock up stream ;)</br>  <br>Shanks was distracted saving Luffy and was all like "Pfft, it's just an arm, I was already a boss with both of them tied behind my back anyway" after it happened.</br>  <br>He'll probably go the indirect route, we'll see mihawk and he will either be missing an eye (I fucking hope not) or he'll just flat out explain that he took zoros eye out by accident with his tiny butterknife or he'll say he took his eye as payment or something.</br>  <br> flashback <br> Zoro training with Mihawk <br> Mihawk comments that Zoro's aim sucks when he's going full tilt <br> Zoro uses a sword to cut his left eye so the scab seals it shut during training </br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck are you on about?</br>  <br>Not really. No one explicitly talked about what they did during the Timeskip. The characters know because they talk to each other. Like when Luffy asked Zoro where he went 2 years ago. It's just as readers who don't know.</br>   yfw BB offscreens shanks   Mihawk's eye is just fine after 2 years. It's not going to be some kinda sharingan/hawkeye bullshit.  <br>Without help from the navy, or a secret deal with Akainu who then backstabs Shanks, there is no way BB's crew can do shit to Shanks</br>  <br>That's one pissed off Mihawk alright.</br>  Why are sadists so good? Post OP sadists.  <br>he is the strongest warlord afterall</br>  <br>Maybe Mihawk was born with Observation Haki like Aisa and generally doesn't give two shits because he knows he can kick the asses of just about everyone around him.</br>  <br>Nah, he usually has a frown like that.</br>  <br>Uh, okay ?</br>    <br> not mentioning sadi chan </br>  <br>her design is lame</br>  <br>its good enough for my dick</br>  <br>your dick is probably gnarled and calloused</br>  <br>Your sick had shit taste</br>  <br>What are you on about?!<br>Anyway, here's a picture of penguin appreciating his captain.</br></br>  <br>when will you fucking go away you insipid cunt?</br>  <br>If you are pretending to be a fat hippo maybe, Sadi-chan is the only good sadist.</br>  <br>Does Hancock count ?</br>  <br>he got pink eye from eating out pinkqt and cut it to make it look like a scar</br>  <br>That's pretty good, thanks. Why they banging in such a gross looking room though?<br><br>Easy there, anon. Dentist-chan is cute.<br><br>She could've been hot but instead of that she's a boring stereotype and her whole character is a joke.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> penguin is so pure he doesn't even take off his clothes to fuck </br>  <br>well yes, and Shachi too</br>  <br>easy for you to call someone insipid when you're so salty.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>literal faggots have arrived<br>thread ruined</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I havent even watched the movie and I love pics like this</br>  <br>Best trap sadist</br>  <br>Post female sadists instead of complaining then, faggot. I never said it had to be men.</br>  So are we all in agreement that the top tier in power in the One Piece world consists of:<br><br>Shanks<br>Mihawk<br>Dragon (likely)<br>Aokiji<br>Kizaru<br>Akainu<br>Garp (probably)<br>Rayleigh<br>Big Mom<br>Kaidou</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128494198 <br>go on...</br>  <br>Aokiji canon lost to Akainu. Swap them around.<br><br>Also, if admirals were stronger than two of the yonkou, they would probably be taken care of.<br><br>I'd want to put Rayleigh higher, but he is old and was breaking a sweat against Kizaru, even if speed readers say differently.<br><br>I don't think Garp is that strong though.<br><br>You forgot Blackbeard and maybe Marco.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Blackbeard</br>  <br>That's all there is.</br>  <br><br>Also Sengoku.</br></br>  <br>Nigga does that look like it's numbered to you?</br>  <br> Why they banging in such a gross looking room though? <br>I don't know. It's from this Korean blog where the artist keeps drawing penguin like some sort of yandere, I think?<br><br>I'm not dentist-kun btw</br></br></br></br>  <br>Im really sad. any info on the maker; sauce? this is my fetish.</br>  <br>Oh, sorry.

I had him on the list and then accidentally deleted the post. He's probably up there just because of his dual-powers, although I imagine he's probably the weakest of the four emperors personally right now.<br><br>I wonder about Garp too. I've always felt like he was comparable to the three admirals from before the timeskip but I don't get the impression that he's definitively stronger than him, even though a lot of people think he is.<br><br>Marco is definitely a possibility too; I just left him out because he hasn't had much presence compared to most of the others on that list.<br><br><br>I've never thought Sengoku was as strong as the pre-timeskip admirals. Maybe he was at one point but I think taking a desk job for decades (and then finally retiring) would leave him below them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> EVEN ODA SHIPS IT <br>[citation needed]</br></br>  <br>That would be BB's brother, the bandit, that used it to weaken shanks so that he would defeat him in the future.</br>  <br>Oda imply they fuck, not ships them. You know why it's called "ships"? Because whales do that, they look at the ships and think they are fellow whales ready to mate, but when they get closer its a jap ship who harpoons them to death and eats their meat.<br><br>In the end, those whales just really want to be eaten and to get impaled by some big harpoon.</br></br></br>  <br>sanji's clothes look nothing like robin's in this</br>  <br> implying zoro isn't intentionally handicapping himself </br>  <br>what if Zoro started carrying like 5 extra swords on his back that he never uses, but then when shit gets real  Robin makes 5 arms appear on his back and he goes spider style? </br>  <br>They would not be his arms, so pretty shitty. Robin would just cut herself.</br>  <br>Yes, it does. Obviously it was changed to a male design but it's still recognisable.</br>  The gianst on little garden said the only thing they can't defeat is that "bloody snake". Do they just mean the Island Koi?<br><br>(Chapter 129)</br></br>  <br>It'd be just like Hana Arashi.

I'd "la kill" both of them if you get my meaning.  Ryuuko is perfect  This one.  <br>I prefer Ryuuko but I'd gladly take them both.</br>  <br>Ryuko seems like a fuckbuddy while her sister would be one of those girlfriends that acts like your mother.<br><br>You get in trouble with Ryuko.

She does everything right.  Ryuko is the ultra best girl.  Ryuuko's pussy is hot like fiya. Satsuki's pussy is cold like a dead fish.  Why did they have to turn Satsuki into a 30 year old office lady?    <br>Anyone who doesn't pick glorious Satsuki-sama is objectively wrong.</br>  <br><br>the only correct answers in the entire thread</br></br>  <br> liking the most annoying character in any anime I've ever seen <br><br>Literally shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Satsuki-sama is literally perfect<br><br> Implying Ryuuko could ever dunk on her </br></br></br>  Ryuko obviously.<br> There will never be someone as cool and perfect as Ryuko </br>  <br> women <br> dunking <br>In your dreams tripfag.</br></br></br>   best girl   <br>This is the best answer.<br><br><br>There's nothing wrong with liking Satsuki, she's pretty cool. But if you dream of waking up in the morning with her heels on your chest, you might want to think about your role in relationships.<br><br><br>kiru means "cut" and "cloth" in Japanese, as well as "kill" in english. So it's a triple entendre meaning "kill the cloth" "cut the cloth" etc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I bet she's fun to play vidya with.  Is Ryuuko X Senketsu a valid pairing?  <br>If by "play vidya" you mean "pass around a room of big dicked niggers", then yes.</br>  <br>No. Ryuko is not a shirtsexual.<br><br>It's not INVALID any more than any other pairings, but KlK was written without pairings so it's not debatably canon either.<br><br><br>If by "pass around" you mean "play vidya with", sure. Although I don't know why anyone's penis size would be relevant.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The most valid.</br>  <br>If by "play vidya" you mean "horribly disfigure and dump her in an alleyway", then yes.</br>  <br> Ryuko is not a shirtsexual. <br><br>That's debatable.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't mean that, because she could literally throw a room full of hostile basketball Americans into orbit.<br><br>The whole room, all at once.</br></br></br>  <br> basketball Americans </br>  Just keeping thread alive with best girl.  <br>You're correct about KLK having no romance, but that Ryuko loves wearing Senketsu more than anything, that he's the person she loves most, that he's her one true love, that they are soulmates. That's not my opinion, that's from the show. Their relationship may not be explicitly romantic, but it is explicitly the strongest relationship. Whatever that it is, it's the entire way that Ryuko needs to not lose.</br>  <br> one true love <br><br>Please, that's not from the show. Soulmates, maybe. Best friends, definitely. But "one true" implies a lot of things that make no sense.<br><br>She also took about 30 seconds to get over his death, which I wasn't okay with, but there you have it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There was a bit of romance between Mako and Gama.</br>  <br>Yes, but that was added by the animation staff. It wasn't written into the original plot.</br>  <br> dump her in an alleyway <br> Not paying it forward </br></br>  <br> She also took about 30 seconds to get over his death <br> Still coming to terms with it in the OVA <br> Still having panic attacks when she thinks she sees him in the crowd months later <br><br>The show took about 30 seconds to transition from his death to the epilogue (where she has said panic attack), but that's just bad directing. Also the one true love line is from episode 17, I think.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>who /hoc/ here</br>  <br> Still coming to terms with it in the OVA <br><br>But is that different from how she'd be if Mako or Satsuki had kicked it?<br><br>Having one true loves die isn't something that leaves you fully functional, if pensive, 2 weeks later.<br><br> months <br>It was one month.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So, which team would Mako root for?<br> I'd say the Jets </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128458295 <br>Boku no Yuri</br>  <br>If you recall in the OVA Ryuko realizes that Senketsu's soul is with her, and she's still wearing him insider her.
