[ Who is best shingeki and why is it Annie?   Because she was characterized damn well.    I know this is you, anniebot. Don't lie.   Thats not Sasha  is anniebot a  girl    I only liked her when she laughed at Armin.  I want to say Mikasa is the best but she is actually really boring.     How would either wall breach had gone if the full SL had been there? Slightly less casualties maybe?       It isn't Annie, it is Jean, who was by the way confirmed the winner of the Mikasab owl in the Live action movie (just saw the thread in the archive; funny how deluded autists thought it was supposed to represent Levi somehow).  I am celebrating victory over here, whilst EM/YH autistcucks are getting cucked the fuck out.  Allah akbar. *shoots his AK47 in the air*        kill yourself    *teleports behind you* *unzips katana* *slashes your AK47 in half* *teleports away with a cheeky grin*  Nothin personnel kid          Ymirfag owns a katana  Literally nobody is surprised.     I only read the AK47 part of your post Not gonna bother with shipping shit m8     Based Jean.   Is EH the hero we need?   EH is freedom from the tyranny of YH and EM.    are you high?   It's now official that Hanji is a tranny, Isayama just said it on his blog   dubs    nice one     the neckbeard has to post the same 5 pictures he has over and over again because Japan will never make any new ones for his delusions     We knew that already. What retard still thinks he's female at this point?    Because we haven't seen anything of her in so fucking long you forget about her and then remember her and you think she's the best, but really she was okay.    Annie a shit.    you sound underage    And has not been changed for years thanks to crystalization.  The rest of her corps' characterizations are now very messy.     so whats going on now, i stopped reading when that bitch got crystalized and they were trying to get to the basement, did they ever make it?  why are the walls titans? whos the gorilla man? why isnt everyone dead when they were all dying left and right  lets make a lot of characters so we can use them as cannon fodder        you'll never marry Annie    Hange is best, everybody else is a shit.   http://blog.livedoor.jp/isayamahazi<wbr>me/archives/8867221.html  So Hanji is both male and female?  </wbr>  http://m.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Mt3WMO<wbr>fh2Wo</wbr>  [ ]  Dat kiss.     The fuck you say...    Annie worst girl    Sauce:  @hituzi2gou     Why do people care about the kiss?  best shingeki isnt a character but a concept. it's the concept of dropping shingeki and finding some self respect   It's inexpected I guess. And also it's probably because it's Mikasa.    Because Mikasa is only good for shipping fodder for self-inserting twats     Who is best kyojin and why is it Annie?     Blorphole Poover Poobar    It's okay, I got him covered.    Annie is love Annie is life Annie is the sun that warms my heart Annie a miracle of the universe Annie might've done some things wrong, but she's still a beautiful person inside and out           think they will finale be going there next chapter or atleast to Shiganshina District      First king had them build the walls with hardening abilities.      monkey trouble he is a shifter and the one leading the others. He is waiting at Shiganshina District for them.     reanimation jutsu             I haven't been that legitimately sad in a long time.    Annie a shit.  Can't even run away properly and just gives up on life.      Butthole a love.    Blorp oozes from the Butthole.    Serves him right for the semen demon he is.   Eren x Annie OTP    lets make a lot of characters so we can use them as cannon fodder  SnK in a nutshell, I wonder how Flegel and the reporters are still alive.     I think the series actually does a decent job making you care about the cannon fodder characters.      Who, Marco? Petra? The rest of Levi's squad? Nifa? Mike? Not really.    Same guy, I wanted to add that I only know their names because I lurk here, otherwise I might only remember Marco and that's because Jean couldn't shut up about it in the anime. In the manga he was just a random dead guy.    It makes me sad that titans are primarily supposed to be war machines and this'll never happen.    The character grew on me when I read them in manga compared to the anime.    Maybe if you watched the anime first. For someone that reads/watches it for the first time most of these characters are just random redshirts.   I wonder what will the ending be. Most likely the entire wall will be destroyed but then what?  Was pretty cool.   Hey man.  You intentionally left your trip on.     Lelouch is intentionally a faggot, news at 11.   Does anyone have the most recent chart? I was withouth internets for 2 weeks, I missed the release hype  Who is Monkey Trouble, am I supposed to be able to tell who he is? It's just a long haired glasses dude     That guy who led the squade when taking back Trost and had Mikasa and Eren's back.  Those two guys who died last at Utgard.  That black haired chick who died because Eren's an idiot.       That guy   Those two guys   That black haired chick  So you agree with me.       Hey, I never said anything about knowing their names.    I thought Levi squad will live because they are like elite of elites.    Annie is eliter.    There no memorable I just remember all their names   Damage control        Damage control  Do you even know what that means? I only added more to my rant, I didn't take anything back.     To jump off your "Marco is just a random dead guy" comment, he's really not. His portrait is featured at the start of every volum of the manga, whereas other dead characters have their's removed.   I have a feeling he's still important to the story somehow. Hopefully we'll find out when Annie gets uncrystalised.      Mmkay you don't remember every last one of them or anything I didn't even remember some of those names damn anon they really had an impact on you.     More like I lurk these threads a lot.        Historia a bestest.        You love them don't you I bet you cried when each one was killed off     N-No I didn't ;_;    Why I can't but agree with this.   Not that guy but I loved Petra, thinking she is qt and may be spared but not a single tears was shed when she died       It's one of the reasons why his characterfags think he'll come back.      I might be the only one who didn't give a shit about any of the fodder. Especially Levi Squad, they were too obvious.    Me neither. Although I wish Nanaba didn't die so soon.    Do not sexualize the queen.    No way he's coming back, but there has to be more to it than him just being a normal guy who died somehow.     I hope Levi died.   I remember Ian leaving an impression on me, he was an upstanding man and I'm sad he died.    Marco is Ymir's time travelling son from the future.  Marco will come back as a titan, Isayama said it.  Marco was just pretending to be dead, didn't you see that his left leg was moving?          I mean I didn't cry but I was like, aww, damn :/.     Ymir   Ever getting pregnant   I see through your lies.       :/  Get out.     She's the father.   So I heard Hanji was confirmed a beautiful transwomyn?   Fyi Ymir was just pretending to be a lesbian. Her true love, Bert, impregnated her and she's currently in labor. Baby Marco will be born soon and we can finally have our canon Jeanmarco.     :/  Scawwy angry face anon     Sounded more like she's a herm    It was just Isayama just fucking with us about the incognite thing.  &gt;2015   &gt;Still doesn't get Isayama's jokes       Marco is totally a BY spawn how did I not notice.      He sounded pretty serious.    Well are you up to date?    Bert actually has standards, he would impregnate Annie not some tranny-looking thing      So does Annie. He might have a chance with Pigner.    Do you think she will just be queen of orphans or will she get to try her hand at other things too?    If Annie had standard she would love Bert, not that self hating, crybaby titan with a huge role that he can't handle that is Er- wait, fuck.    I didn't say the Rageturd is any better.    That's who Annie likes though, and he's the same as Bert.  I like both anyway, she should too.     Not really.    Annie likes Armin       All this delusion.     Eren and Bert are completely different.  Bert is a pawn who's just going along with what's expected of him.  Eren is going against the world, and trying to change things. Annie respects that. I can't imagine she respects Bert.      You're a delusional retard    They are equally terrible characters though.    Ymir would rape his pathetic ass before he even touches her.    Look who is talking.    Eren is the scouting legion's pawn, which is quite obvious. He always does what he's ordered to. At first he wanted to go against the world but that's not really what happens, he's just a pet.     thinks Annie likes Armin   calls others delusional  /snk/ never ceases to amaze.      Only Reiner would want to touch Bert's second weak spot.    That's a trait that many characters have expressed respect and admiration for, it probably means nothing in terms of romanticism. Historia and Bert have said more or less the same kind of thing at some point, maybe others that I can't recall right at this moment.    Historia admired Eren as well because he knew what he wanted to do. Even if he's their tool he still keeps a sense of self even though right now he's depressed over eating Grisha.    It also means that Annie has zero respect for Bert who is the complete opposite of Eren. If there's lack of respect there's also little room for romantic feelings to develop.     Historia and Bert have said more or less the same kind of thing at some point  You mean Annie and Bert? Because Annie and Bert have pretty much the same worldview from what they said. About humans that go with the flow and being normal I mean.     Bert also knows well what he wants and has to do. Out of BRA he's the only one that never wavered from their goal even if he just wants to return home.    Bert's just a coward.     depressed  He showed symptoms of PTSD in the latest chapter.     Eren is just a whiny ragetard.    I'm thinking of the conversation between Eren and Historia during the chapter where they were in the cabin. Did she not say something about how she admires that about Eren? I could be remembering it wrong, it's been a while since I read the chapter    Maybe you should read the manga for a change.    It's much more emphasized in Annie's case, though, and she's very selective about who she associates with. I don't have anything against BA, but I don't see it realistically happening.    I thought it was more like envy.    From memory she was saying that she's jealous of the fact that he seems to know exactly what he's doing with his life.    And Bert is a whiny fag.    Sorry my bad, you're right. I still don't see Eren as someone who goes against the flow as Annie or Historia describe him. From humanity's viewpoint, Eren does that and Bert is a pawn, but from the titan's viewpoint it's the other way around. If you look at it from a third person's viewpoint, both of them are pawns for their cause.      You both are getting to my words. I like both characters but in the end they're not much different from each other. Bert has acted like a ragetard at some points and Eren has acted like a crybaby. Both claim they have no will but both do everything to help their cause.     I think it's because Eren always calls other people out on not fighting back. At least early on he was always giving speeches about how humanity needed to stand against the titans.   Also, he did put in a hell of a lot of effort to become a soldier. That's respectable in its own right.      Eren put a lot of effort to become a soldier but BRA put much more effort to become warriors. Sure they're not the same, but Eren's will to go against the flow was there only in the beginning. After Levi and Erwin took him under their control he just helps the scouting legion with everything, it just happens that he agrees with their cause.  I expect Bert and Reiner to go against MT for whatever reason, since it's starting to look like MT is doing it for selfish reasons and BR disagree, but that's just speculation on my part.      Bert will go awol to save Annie. Reiner will directly go against MT and die for it.    Bert loves Annie but he wouldn't leave Reiner to die. Reiner always gets into trouble but that doesn't mean that Bert agrees with it, that's why he's always running after him.    Either way he managed to get two girls to envy or admire him because Eren comes across as a strong-willed person. Bert doesn't really have anything admirable about him.    So Reiner and Eren are equally dumb. Although Eren's behavior was even more retarded and got his team mates killed.    Bert is more strong willed that Reiner or Annie though, he only thinks he's not.    The SL's goals coincide with Eren's and it was a dream of his to join them. Why would he deter from that anyway? He still has a strong spirit to him and if he felt the SL were doing something he disagreed with greatly he probably wouldn't stand for it.    Annie hides in a crystal and Reiner created a second personality, it's not like they're much competition.     He still has a strong spirit to him  Not as much, at least during the last arc that changed.  if he felt the SL were doing something he disagreed with greatly he probably wouldn't stand for it  Really? He disagreed with the SL's intentions about Annie but he still helped them catch her.       Is this some sort of pretending to be retarded? Reiner wouldn't have developed a second personality if he had Bert's will and Annie wouldn't have hidden if she had his will. Although I think Annie did it to protect the information, not just her life. Point still stands about Reiner.    He also knows Annie is responsible for the deaths of many soldiers and is considered an enemy to them first and foremost.    Sure, but he still disagreed and he still did it. He doesn't do what he wants he does what the SL wants.    My point is that out of a guy with a split personality and a girl who hid in a rock, of course Bort is going to look like he's strong willed. But compared to others aside from his tagalongs he's a pussy.    Because for the most part he agrees with them. Do you think he would be okay with it if for some reason the SL told him to kill Mikasa and Armin?    He looks strong willed because Reiner and Annie are cowards too.    Annie was willing to risk being eaten by Titans. That's something.   What was he meant to do, let a Titan rampage through Stohess?        Sure I guess, he's far from strong willed in general. The problem is that people describe him as weak willed even compared to RA, hell some say he's more weak willed than the whole cast when that's not true at all. He just hates himself and thinks he's more worthless and cowardly than he really is.     Bert is just a weakling who shows signs of strength sometimes. Other characters are strong that at times show signs of weakness, as most humans do anyway.    Pretty much. He's just the least cowardly of a trio of cowards      Depends. Most humans are either weak that shows signs of strength or strong that show signs of weakness. He's not more strong willed than many characters in the cast, but he's not the most weak willed of the cast, unlike what the consensus thinks.    He is weak-willed in comparison to many others though.    That's what I'm saying too, in case you can't read.   Fuck off hetshipping scum. Only YH is canon and maybe EM.   He's not the most weak willed but he's definitely in that area.    Yes anon, in case you didn't notice we agree on that for quite a while.    I know that, I'm reiterating because some think otherwise.   How do Mikasafags feel about this?  Is it true that Mikasa's actress filmed a naughty scene with Shikishima's actor?   Jesus Christ, I wonder if Isayama will comment on this if the fanbase gets too loud.    No.    I like how that artist had to change Mikasa's expression and also turn the OC into Levi.    I'm looking forward to the massive amounts of LM fanart that this will bring about.   tfw Levi with a mustache      LM isn't as popular as people like to believe. Plus it's just a live action offshoot so who cares?    Yeah but we know nothing about him anyway. MT is anon-kun.   Am I the only one who doesn't care about Levi or Mikasa?   I guess anything's better than EM.     I have a feeling he's still important to the story somehow.  Isayama killed him earlier than planned because he "didn't stand out"     You're never the only one, now stop shitposting.    Mikasa is qt but manlet a shit.    No, Kenny was the only interesting Ackermann. He had more personality than LM combined.    Marco was just a random good guy, like pretty much every redshirt in the series that dies two chapters after getting introduced.    Get out, neckbeard.  Kenny was just an autistic manchild.      I fucking miss when all we has were these ass threads and sometimes discussion.    The face of a cuck    We can still make the ass discussions happen. I'll take anything over more shipping cancer.    Annie has the best ass     neckbeard  Women with taste don't like the manlet. They go for better options like Erwin or Reiner.     You mean sleepy time threads?    Annie never to to see that.  Anyway Eren's still bent on his dream, he just recognizes the SL has the same dream as him. That's why he wanted to join in the first place so of course he'd do what they told him to. Eren has radical ideals for humanity that trump his regard for his own life and he's working towards achieving that, that's what Annie respected, and what Bert lacked.      That too, and Bert has a more gentle attitude and looks in general, and it may make him look even more weak willed than he is.   In the end I agree with the anons that say both Bert and Eren are pawns and just follow around orders. Which makes sense since they're soldiers and that's what soldiers do.      The difference is Bert's still going "with the flow" it's just that the flow is to do their mission. Like you said he's doing this because he wants to go home, it's not on the altar of a higher purpose unlike Marlo and Eren's goals.     I still don't see Eren as someone who goes against the flow  Eren's living in a society of cattle. Everyone is encouraged to live with their heads down inside the walls, but he always wanted to go out.     Depends on how you see it, Eren wants to see the outside world, Bert wants to go home, they both do what's necessary for it. Along with their dream they also help humanity on Eren's case, and MT or the village on BRA's case.   Eren and Bert combined would make the perfect Shinji.   Nah I meant the threads way before and no one had any idea that Isayama would waste most of his girls into irrelevancy.    Well sleepy time had nice discussions too.    Erwin is a pleb and Reiner, again, looks like a deformed dyke. Tell me, what is so distasteful about the manlet? He has a better personality than the both of them.      Nice bait.    Manlet doesn't even have a personality.    Shinji a shit tho. Kaworu a best.    I wasn't implying that he isn't.    He's loyal, introverted feeler and consistent. What's not about him to like?     I have come to appreciate the manlet. He's better than characters like Eren and Bert. Erwin is good too.    So it makes sense that worst shingekis Bert and Eren combined make Shinji.    He's just a retarded lapdog who can't make any decision on his own and just repeats the same dumb speech again and again.    He's also mentally retarded, ugly, a manlet, can't think for himself and has an awful, bland personality. He can cook and clean sure but anyone with working arms and legs could do that if they tried.    I find manlet far worse than Bert or Eren    That's your opinion, but I disagree with it.    Because he is, manletfags are just desperate to make him rise up a little in popularity on /a/.    she is the queen of my heart    You and the rest of the retarded 13 year old fujoshits that populate 90% of the fanbase.    He is far worse. Bert and Eren at least have some conflict in their personalities despite being pawns, while manlet is just a lapdog that mindlessly follows orders no matter how bad they are. Bert and Eren think for themselves.    They already shit up the threads as is and hate on everyone who isn't the manlet because they think people only dislike him due to popularity.    I think out of all the characters who are consistently shat on here, which is pretty much everyone as is, Levi is the only one who deserves it. Especially since a good chunk of the plebs with bad taste will defend him no matter what anyway.    I'm neither a fujoshi nor am I a teenager. To be fair I don't even care about shipping. I'm not sure why you get so butthurt over a differing opinion.    I dislike his fanbase too but that doesn't mean the character is good. If Levi was a good character no one would mind his popularity.    Where do you think we are    No one is butthurt, just saying your opinion isn't unpopular.    I know I'm on 4chan but your level of butthurt over someone liking Levi is just childish. Did I shit on your favorite character or something?    Yeah he's pretty bad and this arc proved he's dumb as shit too    No it doesn't, really. The difference is ideological, that's the part Annie admires.  It's just that they have a dream or how far they're willing to go for it, though she does admire the way the "special" people stick to their guns, but the basis is quality of those dreams themselves.  In her conversation with Marlo she says he's special because goes against the society's mentality simply because of what he believes to be right even though the system itself is built on corruption, same as Eren who believes that people should go out simply because it's their world and it's their right even though everyone thinks it better not to mess with the walls and the SL are regarded as freaks.   Bertolt has probably the strongest determination out of BRA despite being underestimated, but in the end he admits himself that he doesn't have anything he values more than his own life. On a personal note I think he's not quite correct on this, I would bet he is capable of sacrificing himself for Annie or Reiner, but they're not dreams or ideals. He doesn't want to die for that, even on the off chance he was fed some bullshit about higher goals for their mission, what moves Bert are very personal things: his desire for home, and his care for RA.          Go back to Dumblr now    No one got butthurt though, your damage control proves you're the only butthurt here.     both Bert and Eren are pawns and just follow around orders  Difference is Eren believes in those orders while Bert just wants to get it over with.     I simply said I liked Levi and I got anons replying to me for no reason.    Ymir will get inside that with her BBC while you're gonna watch like an impotent cook.    How does that make someone butthurt?     implying watching your waifu getting fucked by another man with a big dick isn't hot     Clearly I'm not the one who's angry over someone liking a character I don't.    So in the end Annie admires Eren's ideals because he is selfless? Bert isn't as selfless, he puts RA above him but he seems like he doesn't care about the rest, like humanity and such. Not that he likes killing people, but if it means being happy with RA, then he's okay with it.   he admits himself that he doesn't have anything he values more than his own life  I don't know if that changed or if he never realized it, but that's not true.       I hope Isayama gives us canon beardlet soon. Beardwin was heaven sent from above      He has a better personality than the both of them.  I don't even hate manlet but that's just not true. Reiner is bro-tier and at least all Erwin's decisions are his own.     Ymir is not a man, she is a strong independent woman. Having a penis doesn't make her a man.     Ymir   man   big dick       Woah people replied to you? That's unusual, sorry about that, it will never happen again. Stop whining already, you should have expected that because almost no one likes Levi here.    A true Historiafag acknowledges that Ymir fucked her and impregnated her and is okay with that.     Eren's ideals because he is selfless?  No, it's because like she said, he's one of those "special" persons that don't go with the flow.   I don't know if that changed or if he never realized it, but that's not true.  Please read  On a personal note I think he's not quite correct on this, I would bet he is capable of sacrificing himself for Annie or Reiner, but they're not dreams or ideals. He doesn't want to die for that, even on the off chance he was fed some bullshit about higher goals for their mission, what moves Bert are very personal things: his desire for home, and his care for RA.          True, she probably has a tiny penis actually, from all the estrogen she used to take to help her transition.    Can you post that panel where she has Ymir's jizz all over her face?    This this this. Historiafags are all cuckolds with a bull fetish.    He always comments on other people's beards. Can he even grow one?     Nah.    No one gives a shit, Reiner was her first. He took her virginity. Nigmir can have sloppy seconds for all I care.    I can accept she will never love me like she loves Ymir.    I'm going to assume he has testicles so in that case the answer would be yes.    No mate no. She loves you just as much as she loves Ymir!!    You Ymirfags can't accept that YH is yet another one sided romance in a series full of one sided romance and Historia sees her as a dear friend and nothing more.    There isn't a single character in the series who wouldn't be improved with the addition of facial hair.    Reiner could barely even talk to her.    But he was malnourished so perhaps he can't and wishes he could?    I'm not a Ymirfag I'm a Historiafag. And YH is the only reasonable pairing for her because Ymir makes her happy.    And? He is an alpha male, he doesn't need to talk, he needs to  FUCK___ . He just put it inside her and gave her an instant orgasm with no talking.    I agree. Even shitren would improve slightly.     I'm not a Ymirfag I'm a Historiafag  Nice try, really subtle. Eren makes her happy too  and no EH is not a thing  and if you were a Historiafag you would understand that.     I believe this poster and everything he says.      Nice Historiafags hate Ymir maymay. But I really am one.    Who said Historiafags hate Ymir? Are you retarded?    That's not Ymir's liquid. The titan is not part of Ymir's body (since it is obviously male and we 4channers believe that gender is biological and not an identity thing).    like gordon ramsey?    Even the females?   The 104th are a bunch of 15 yr olds, they can only grow baby beards and shit.       Because that seems to be what some think here the moment you say you're a Historiafag who likes YH or Ymir.    Gordon Ramsey is an EH/hetfag? Fucking dropped his show.     Funny how Annie comes off as such a cynic but is openly into the idealists.     Umm no I said that YH is one sided, I don't care about Ymir and that means I also don't hate her. I also don't care much about Eren. I don't ship EH or YH particularly, but both Eren and Ymir make Historia happy, but at least Eren doesn't throw her off cliffs and force her to do things.    It's because you're not a Historiafag if you like YH.  Your fag status is determined by the most beta character you support.  Ymir is clearly the more beta out of the YH duo, so you are an Ymirfag.  If you liked, in example, Judenmadchen x Eren, then you are an Anniefag since she is the more beta out of the two (the one who wants his kebab dick; Eren himself has a harem to choose from).          Beardwin was great but mostly because of that smile. Not the insane one but the small one. That was the first time he looked soft.    Most Historiafags hate Ymir.    Annie a good but I'll always be loyal to MikASSa no matter how much Isayama wastes her potential.  Dem abs still the best though.      How can you love Historia but not care about Ymir? Ymir is the one who helped her stop being suicidal and I kind of doubt Historia only sees her as just a friend considering her reaction to being separated from her. As for Eren, he's important to her too but I don't see the romance in EH.    Fuck off. Hetfag scum are NOT real Historiafags.    You mean the two or so who hate literally anyone who gets close to her? They don't count as anything but bitter waifufags.    She is a cynic that wants to believe and it's breaking my heart.     Ymir helped your favorite, you MUST like her!  How many times do we have to say it for Ymirfags to understand this? Ymir doesn't appeal to me as a character, and thus I don't care about her. You should be able to understand this concept since grade school.     The threads ain't ever gonna be as cozy as back then, but sure. Unfortunately I lost my ass folder years ago ;_;     Ymir is the one who helped her stop being suicidal  Yeah, because she wasn't suicidal at all in chapter 50+. At no point was she like "Fahkeet, just kill all the humanities gibsmedat serum papa!". Nope, Ymir did everything, Ymir da man.  Ymir himself ran away from her because he knew that his future is somewhere else.      Previews of the ED and bonus tracks of the second recap movie: http://shingeki.tv/music/movie_op.p<wbr>hp</wbr>    I am afraid for her to be back now that the SL has a serum.    I'm not a Ymirfag, again. And if you devalue Ymir as a character then you're ignoring a huge part of Historia's growth as a person. Not only that but she's also the most important person to her above all else.    I never thought I'd say that but I hope she stays in her crystal a bit longer. It's safer in there ;_;    This movie won't flop now that it'll have a lot of Levi, will it.    Everyone hated Annie before and during the anime though, what are you talking about. The Annie a shit type of posts were everywhere and so was the Jew maymay.    Obvious sarcasm, but it is true that Ymir helped a great deal even after she abandoned her.    I understand that, but I still don't see why I should like a character that my favorite interacted with. By that logic all Jeanfags should like Marco even if he was a redshirt and so on. Liking a character isn't a chain reaction.    Did you even read 66? Her memory of Ymir is what caused her to rebel against Rod. It's obvious that Ymir's words to her mean a lot to her otherwise she would have went through with taking the serum and eating Eren.     what are you talking about  I don't remember much if any hate during the time of Pandaniku's reign and before, when no one had a clue she was FT.  Speaking of Pandaniku, does anyone have a fullsize of his Sasha one? With the heart eyes? That was him, right?       You just replied to a shitposter    I just don't see why you would dislike Ymir either. Even if you don't like her much then at least acknowledge Ymir's importance to Historia.    Now that MT's mentioned her chances are she'll be relevant in this arc.    It's kinda logical to appreciate the character that pushed your shingeki to become the person they are now. Individually this character may not appeal to you, but it's an undeniable fact that without Ymir Historia would have gone nowhere.     when no one had a clue she was FT.  Here's your reason.      I do acknowledge her importance to Historia, I just don't like her as a character. It's not that hard to understand and you should stop whining when someone has a different taste than you.     Those were fun days.    What exactly do you have against Ymir? Don't tell me you're one of those who thinks she's "abusive".    I'm not saying that you should like her, it's just that a lot of Historiafags seem to devaluate Ymir's importance to Historia and to me it just comes across as being ignorant on purpose. It's a weird concept to me that Ymirfags or Historiafags would look down on the other character.    I have nothing against her, I have a lot against your whining though. Not liking a character doesn't mean I hate her.    Let me do it again then.    Yes it does. It's literally a synonym. Hate = not like.     Nah I like Ymir a lot but I can intellectually acknowledge the impact a character I dislike has on a character I like without having to appreciate them. Like how I acknowledge that boring as fuck Marco had a impact on Jean.  It's a fucking simple concept and not hard to understand.        Uh, no, not really. Again, stop being so defensive. I don't like her but I don't hate her either, that means I'm indifferent.     Well I guess as long as you appreciate her for what she's done. I just don't get the other Historiafags who hate on her, they seem to be retarded.    No, it simply indicates a lack of like. Indifference can play into it.  Don't be an idiot.      For yet another time, your whining is annoying. It's a different opinion and you should learn to accept it.   I just created my own Ymir figurine  (on the toilet) , anyone wanna see it?     moar MikASSa plz?      I do understand that much. For example I don't have much of an opinion on Historia but I do acknowledge that she's important to Ymir. To be fair comparing it to Jean and Marco's situation is weird, Marco barely had any relevance in the manga and his interactions with Jean were too little to really form an opinion on him and his relationship with Jean.    You're replying to a reverse shitposter.     Keep you filthy wanking elsewhere, neckbeards.     No, he isn't. You are so fucking autistic that you can't even tell your posts apart from mine, Ymirbro.    There's no such thing as reverse shitposting, there's only shitposting.    I wonder how much her dad plays into it. She said he "was" "high on a pipe dream of an ideal" which means either he broke down/changed his mind or he died.  Given his apologies, he probably broke down. Her being bent on keeping their promise means he still means a lot to her. But does she feel like he let her down? Is she looking for someone who won't back down on their dreams?  Will we ever get more Annie backstory? ;_;        How am I a reverse shitposter?   When's that new game coming out?   This this this. Neckbeards and hetshitters go away.  Now let's post some delicious Bert x Reiner. :-^)      I'm replying to a Ymirfag that claims to be a Historiafag. That's some form of reverse shitposting but that person believes his claims.    I lost my collection.    With all the bloom effects and shit, it looks like an average picture of a cosplayer.    Just stop anon, it's embarrassing.    Eren and Armin then.     being in this much denial   I'm probably the biggest Historiafag here. Being okay with Ymir doesn't make me a reverse shitposter.     Sure why not.    Sure.    Bert is like Makoto-lite for SnKfags huh?    Why is Reiner an ANT?    Noice.    I'm hoping she gets a redemption arc, seeing as her crimes are far less than BR's.    That is a bee.    No. He has nothing in common with Makoto. Makoto is a cute tomboy Idolmaster, Bert is not cute or a tomboy.     her crimes are far less than BR's  Seriously? Annie is responsible for the same amounts of deaths as BR, since she called the titans in Shiganshina and maybe in Trost as well.     That's a bee, not an ant.    Fuck I hope not. I love Annie but redemption arc is way too cheesy for BRA and she's not looking for redemption anyway.    It's not a fucking bee. I studied biology for 8 years and I can tell a bee and ants apart. It's an ANT ANT ANT.    The fags have arrived. Abandon thread.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-qL<wbr>BEI0SFI8</wbr>  [ ]    What's so unbelievable about a Historiafag who likes Ymir? You're probably just projecting.     kiss  Por Que?       Nothing is unbelievable, just the whole  hey guys Ymir is best shingeki, I'm a Historiafag btw and why don't you guys like Ymir?      The belief that Ymirfags and Historiafags must always be at odds because of a few autists.    Just wait for Season 2, all the porn will be delicious.     &gt;&gt;hey guys Ymir is best shingeki, I'm a Historiafag btw and why don't you guys like Ymir?  You lack reading comprehension      since she called the titans in Shiganshina and maybe in Trost as well  Pure speculation.   She's only ever been shown fighting enemy soldiers. She never kicked down walls and caused civilian deaths. She's actually been shown having regret when civilians have died (when Eren punched her onto that church she seemed shocked by the people she crushed).       I never said Ymir is best shingeki, she isn't even one of my favorites. But I am okay with her and can acknowledge her importance to Historia.    I've reached my limit anon. Can someone please help us post more delicious shingeki girl ass ;_;    Te voy a encontrar en la vida real. Voy a descomprimir mi pene y lo puso en su boca y lo frota en el interior hay hasta materia blanca sale y te trague, maldito coño. MUJERES EN VIDEOJUEGOS NO MÁS    She was still in cahoots with BR and when discovered she was completely unrepentant and antagonistic. She doesn't want to work with the SL anon, face it. Embrace Annie as she is.     Pure speculation.  Sure, Armin's speculation and nothing so far proves the opposite. Armin is always right by the way, we know that well.     My ass is much more delicious than her flat ass.    Soon.     her importance to Historia.  Historia has now a good relationship with Eren. She doesn't need Ymir anymore, kek     So if we agree, I see no reason for all your whining, I see her the same way as you claim you do.    Wow thanks for ruining makoto for me you CUNT    When I said redemption I didn't mean working with the Survey Corps, I just meant her sort of going her own way and no longer trying to kill humanity.     kek   Hetfags, everyone.      Will the following chapters and Season 3 make them rise in popularity? Their role might be even bigger than the one they had in chase arc and Utgard.    At first I though that was a Mikaso.    Historia can have more than one friend you know.    I'm kind of lazy but eh, why not.    I think we can both agree that Ymir is as important to Historia as I am important to you.    Oh you dick    I hope so,    Oh but you're very important to me anon. Will you marry me?    Gringo de mierda, no sabes escribir español. Vuelve a tu país de mierda.       Thanks man.   I see. Annie as a free agent could be interestinf but I wouldn't call that redemption, to be redeemed she has to compensate for what she's done, and to do that she has to do something real big for the SL. But that's just semantics.          I just leave it here     back muscles  Yes.        "I won't forgive her"   proceeds to defend her against Connie      I fucking love Hysteria. Araki and her VA better not fuck this up.    Do you have any reading comprehension? She even defended her afters.      This and her screaming during Utgard.    Are you retarded?      You know the only this this proves is how much Historia cares for Ymir. And she's being rather possessive, too.    If anything that page just proves how much Ymir meant to Historia you fag.    I'm worried none of the extra pages will make S2    *afterwards     tfw their canon underwear looks nothing like this       The extra pages are part of chapters 50 and 51 and they were included in the official volume release.    I'm worried they'll cut out Eren's interaction with anyone who isn't Mikasa. I'm still annoyed they didn't include Annie offering to train him in S1.    They're important scenes and too short to make OVAs from.   Then again the Annie and Eren bonding scenes were important too.        I hope the make an OVA of it.      I want to see her go Hysteria as the queen.      In last chapter she talked with Eren about BR    And didn't say anything about Ymir  Yes, she is still really important to Historia, I see       tfw looking forward to fapping over shota-looking Armin on a bed   tfw Araki removes it for the sake of shipping faggotry  Fuck everything        How can they make an OVA of a few pages. I can see them making another OVA of the joke pages though.    She asked about BR because she knows Eren wanted to kill BR. Why would she even mention Ymir.    Why would she bring up Ymir when talking about if Eren wants to kill BR?    Because Eren is only angry at BR, not Ymir.    I don't.  Unless Zackly goes wild first, causing her to go Hysteria on him and removing him from his post.     Annie a shit.   What would she be Hysterical over? the only thing I can think off is when Eren finally dies at the end of the series so she has to raise their daughter alone      Combine them. Or add filler about BRY hanging out/traveling.      crystallized shit    I think I'm out.    I'm sorry you feel that way.    Nope, one more.    H-Hot    That was a valiant effort, anon, thanks.    Sankyu    I would just like to see another Hysteria moment again.    Maybe when Ymir comes back and Historia chews her out for leaving.     chews her out  Lewd     What makes you think they will have a daughter? What if they have a son instead?   can we *please* stop discussing hetshit already   No she will yell at Reiner for leaving her behind. Didn't you see how depressed she was when Eren said he has to kill Reiner?    Maybe her VA practiced a lot. She's good friends with a perfect sparring partner.    You'd be depressed too if your new boyfriend wanted to kill your old boyfriend, your first true loev.     implying Reiner will come back  He's gonna die giving birth to an armored monkey titan.      inb4 instead of angry screaming, Araki will change it to moe pleading     It was already pretty moe.    Who do you think she will root for in the end? The handsome, strong Reiner who is also the perfect soldier or the cute, sensitive Eren who helped mend her broken heart?    He might ask her to make the 'haah' sounds during the kidnapping more lewd.    This is a joke right?  Of course if she could have her alpha male Lyner back she would drop that kebab into the loo where it belong.      She will blush and cry and plead for Ymir to return to her and fuck her in the ass.    Do you think she was exaggerating or does she really think Ymir is the worst human bean to ever walk on the face of the earth.    Obviously exaggerating.    She exaggerated.    It's Hisu. She says a lot of dumb shit to get people to do what she wants.    She's merely speaking the truth.    She's saying she's the worst girl because she's fishing for compliments. Obvious desire for kebab dick.    That's a mistranslation, she says that Ymir will never get into heaven.    Well that is a fact. Deviants don't go to Heaven, even in Christianity I think.    True.    That's what it says dumbass.    Nope she's just being emotional, b-baka.     implying Ymir deserves to go to heaven  No friend, that wasn't an exaggeration.     Ymr and Historia both are going to hell.   Can we get more LM fanart of the kiss.   See . It's not about deserves or not deserves. In all religion, deviant women go to Hell.    So then YH are going to hell.    Look for it on Pixiv.    Historia had blessed Aryan semen (Lyner's) inside her first, so there is still hope for redemption.    Reiner is no aryan, he's a homosexual. Plus Historia would bite his dick off.    Disgusting.   Ymir is nordic so she's going to Valhalla. Fuck heaven.   Reiner was defiled by a monkey.    Ymir is African,    No she wouldn't dare. If she tried to, he would squash her skull between his manly arms, no problem.    he thinks Congoid immigrants are Nordic just because their ancestors immigrated to Swedistan  Look at him and laugh. Now I understand why you guys own fedoras and katanas.        If Ymir is nordic then she's going to Hel.    Historia acts more like a man than cherry boy Reiner.    2015   still thinking a hell or heaven exist     Jean is an albino.     Valhalla  Valhöll*  Ymir would go to Náströnd in Hel.       Remember kids, if you touch your weenie you'll go to hell.   Reiner will never get laid. Historia even ripped her skirt off for him practically and all he could do is sit there and stare. He has zero game.   It was loveless rape. Reiner is still a pure maiden at heart.    Kek, good thing I don't have one then.   Onee-chan or imouto?   Why not be the middle child and have both?    Onee-san.    Imouto because Onee-chans are already tainted temptresses.    Twin sister you fag    Neither because I'm not an incestuous faggot   imouto with oneesan personality  The answer is you should be open to both possibilities.  It would be mean to discriminate your sister, just because she was a bit older than you, or just because she's younger than you.  I would like to fuck Mikan senseless though.         Onee-san that looks like a imouto   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127070591  Please kill yourself.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127070591   The Irregular at Magic Middle School.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127070591  Boku no Cockblock    I suspected it was a bad idea to ask before i posted, thank you for confirming my suspicions. Somedat, my knowledge of /a/'s culture will eventually reach a level where I, too, can tell offenders to kill themselves     The safest thing to do is to Image Search. (And yeah, you get the answer for this one). The second is to bait people into answering for you.     You don't even have to do that, show's name is in the metadata.    not picking Onee-chan   Unless the onee-san is at least 3-5 years older then it might as well be an imouto.   how can i say not imouto after the qt3.14 you posted anon?    anime Mikan sucks   Who would stick their fingers in a marshmallow?   it sucks when you are the middle and all you have are brothers. fuck that shit.    That's old manga, Mikan looks more ugly there.  Anime is better.      Mein bruder   Oneesan, unless the imouto is Mikan, in that case Mikan   Anime is shit   Oneesan   Overprotective neesan   IMOUTO FOR LIFE    there will never be an anime or a manga about a delinquent oneesan protecting her otouto     Holy fuuuuuuck    Has Ishikei made anything new lately?    Onee-san   a significantly older Onee-chan that just hasn't moved out of the house and is drunk every night.    This man speaks truth.    Nee-sans of the triangle variety.   Unlucky Malcom     NBR  DROPPED    Onee-san   You don't deserve a nee-san.   Remove nee-san.   This, but only if you came out first so she still has to call you onii-chan.   <br/>   Onee-chan always.    I hate my one-chan so imoutos are best        Onee-san, how is this even a question?    Yes I would!  Especially because she's my sister.      Prove it    Wrong, I'd do anything for her, so if she wants to fuck I will    Why not both?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127083444  hownew.ru    The two toothbrush are touching.  Is his penis finally kissing his sister's womb?     Onee-chans are double edged blades. On one hand, they can be more voluptuous and therefore more attractive. On the other, they can become used goods quicker. I'm going to have to go with imoutos on this one.    Well since I would usually say "neither" I'm going to create a situation where I am forced to choose.  If my mind were warped so that I would have to have a fetish for one of those two then I would choose Onee-chan.  You see I wouldn't trust myself influencing lesser minds than my own, that is known as corruption and unlike Kyousuke or Haru I am not comfortable with reaping the rewards of manipulation.  Onee-chans are older and more experienced. They're far more likely to be aware of what they're doing and able to bear the responsibility of their actions. So naturally the only acceptable answer would be Onee-chans.  They also tend to be tall, have long dark hair, and be on the busty side. So naturally they're more womanly as well which is far more desirable than undeveloped and tiny.            She's so damn sexy     they can be more voluptuous and therefore more attractive  What about voluptuous imoutos?     christmas cake imouto    Has Mikan's belly been impregnated?    Anon please, she's just a child      I hope you mean pic unrelated because that's definitely a 12 y/o at best    It's the pineapple sex hair    Old enough to bleed, old enough to breed.    So you want some one who can fend for themselves? I can agree with that.    Eleven, actually    best friend that you call onee chan, when she is actually only a few days older than you.    This is loli... This doesn't feel right    Why contain it?    Onee-chan on face Imouto on dick     Is there actually anything like this?    More?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127083444  You dont deserve those trips.    I love that him fingering his little sister's asshole was animated.  Thank you Japan.     Considering picking up this series just because of OP webm?  Good or bad idea?      look up source   find it   look it up in my list   dropped at ep1   Is it worth it guys?         Read the manga, faggot.     The show can't hold a candle to our based god Yabuki     yes, S1 is not that good tho, 2 and 3 are breddy gud    It's sixty odd episodes of ecchi romcom that consists mostly of Rito falling and landing exclusively in someone's breasts, ass, or thighs or wacky hijinks caused by Lala's inventions. Watch it if you have the time and feel you can put up with it.  Alternatively: Read the fucking manga, faggot.      Love this artist.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127085241   start watching halfway through the series   HURRRRR, who are all these characters?!      I don't think I've seen it explicitly mentioned, but some sibling doujins have siblings in their twenties.    Isn't she NBR to him? I only have a vague knowledge of this series.    yes, he is adopted.    Ah, so NBR then.     This is one of my favorite manga, but I couldn't get past episode 4 of season 1 and I tried watching it several times Try Season 2, it's more true to the manga.<br/>     imoutos   As a person who has older sisters I choose Imoutos.    She has the hips and thighs of a big teen already  I want to impregnate her so badly      As someone who has neither I choose both.    How is she so perfect?    at least the op was top tier    As someone who has both i choose neither       As someone who has both I choose imouto.  Nee-sans a shit, imoutos are love.         You a shit   Your sister can't help it if she's a bit older or younger than you.  You're just an asshole if you reject her based on that. Please fuck off if that's the case.     Nee-sans a shit.     ...and I came     I like to believe that you are a sister to someone and have a complex about being older or younger than them. Not fitting your brothers preferred.    As someone who as an imouto, I choose imouto.    As someone who is an imouto I choose oneesan    Is onee-chan closer to onii-chan or imouto?    I kinda want that frog backpack     What is faster than a kiss      your imouto will never look at you like that     degenerate    Oh I'd love to start some blogshit right now.    Don't judge me.    Imouto.    this    NBR       I just don't care for onee-san's in general. My general preference is for a submissive girl, regardless of age, but for some reason, even if the onee san is submissive, I just can't get into it.     It's a crime against humanity that she isn't in one of our beds right now.    Do you like tsundere imoutos who are only secretly submissive to their baka anikis?    hold on anonkun, when VR hits full force we can all mean up in the m/a/nsion online arm in arm with our waifus.

New mods and janitors seem to say otherwise, a pity really.    She's not my daughteru and I'll sexualize her all I want     Blogging is allowed when it's about incest.  It's not, that two assholes like it doesn't mean it's okay  And 3DPD is encouraged if it's about your sister.  Again, its not       I've been warned because of incest blogshit multiple times already. You know like, she wore my shirt after a shower or, she grabbed me from behind to show me some move and I've felt het boobs on my back.      new   implying it was ever okay in the first palace      Try telling me what to do fag.    Stop being so bitter that you don't have any sister. Or stop being a monster without heart that can't enjoy the purest form of love.     You're the one that seems new to me.

Incest is gross, otakus are gross, that's why they like it   Dick her straight.     Normalfags not welcome.     Why do you think it is gross?   Confirmed Mikan best imouto. And i thought nobody liked her, my dick is diamonds when i see her   He's probably american        I'm american and I want to fuck my sister.  I'm from the rural south though so I'm just a stereotype.     are you dumb? brothers are better in every way   Why are all imoutos silly in 3D?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127090791  /b/ incest threads are for shitty captioned pictures of 3D and fake greentext stories.    Not all of them   I want to make love with pineapple-tan   do it faget    Nope, the only people that like Mikan are onee-san fags and that's because Mikan is just a loli nee-san. Nee-sans a shit.    What the fuck does that even mean    She acts like a nee-san, not an imouto ergo she is just a loli nee-san, and nee-sans a shit should be self explanatory.    You're fucking retarded, you know that?   Always  <br/>    complying you have a sister     And you think /a/ ones are true?

Of course not, but /a/'s fake incest stories tend to be more than just &gt;slutty sister &gt;be me &gt;had sex.     I know TLR  You clearly not if you had to ask if it was good     Still not a n excuse to blogshit     not having read the manga     Isn't the manga still harem shit just more lewd?    お姉ちゃん    Just go and read it or shit the fuck up       I haven't read the manga     you seem to be confusing "occasionally tolerated/flying under the radar" with "allowed"    I suppose that's a more appropriate analogy.      What's the artist name?     I like it when they're as close in age as possible, twins preferably, but really I don't care. I can't get enough.  Truly the purest form of love     reverse-search, faggot.    That's the problem, I do reverse search and I get nothing    not google    I liked that one for some reason even if I'm not a fan of femdom.     implying iqdb ever gives you someth-  Son of a bitch it worked     you need to learn which service is appropriate for which kind of content   Listen up motherfuckers.  Imoutos are the best. That is all.     If you were going to pick up a series just because of that, then TLR is literally the series for you. Happy fapping, anon.    S1 is really slow and honestly just bad. S2 gets better, and darkness gets even better. You can honestly speedwatch a few episodes of S1 to get the characters down, then jump straight to S2.    Manga is good, anime is shit    Is that a shop, the have the exact same eyes.     No one has translated this yet     Unless all imoutos are Mikan, you're wrong    Except they don't.    No its not a shop, the anime implies that she's Shirou's imouto, who died in the fire. Also that would explain why Illya always mistakes him for Shirou in the mornings       Put you and your sister's name into the penis/vagina affinity analyzer and show your sister the results.      That outfit is far too sexy    I don't know if Kyousuke would let her outside in that.    Strictly for at home with him.    Worst. Girl.      Is this a Cirno thread now?    got any sadpanda links to them?    Same. Reality has proven to me that older sisters are shit so that may stem my bias and makes me wish I had a real imouto.      https://archive.moe/a/thread/126750<wbr>974/#126802854 Not sure if betacuck or gay </wbr>        You failed as a little brother, you failed hard.     Sora alone makes all imoutos best.      Sora   good  Pick one       Seeing as how Sora = good I pick Sora, always.     Sora doesn't even make up for Kirino. The record shows imoutos are still shit.     Now you're just shitposting anon, though this is expected since you are a nee-san fag, which are below even negroes in terms of intelligence.     Don't assume I'm 'pick one' anon. Sora wasn't very appealing in the anime, and as a whole doesn't counter the number of shitty imoutos throughout animu and mango.    Nah you're shitpoting. Only a shitposter would say this trash.    Sora a shit.    Only shitposters pretend that imoutos aren't vastly inferior to nee-sans.     Neat.    The correct word is "superior" anon, not inferior.         Most onee-sanfags don't even see the difference between NBR and Blood related which is utterly disgraceful.   Oneechan forever.   NBR, not a nee-san.    Nee-sans don't show up a lot in animu or mango, I take what I can get.    They're not sisters anon, you are simply deluding yourself.    Then they're not a true big sister, anon. They're just an older caretaker type female.    You're in desperate need of standards, anon.     Its nowhere near the same if its NBR. Not even close.      Christmas cakes are great too.    I don't go outside much.   I can see why a blood relation for imoutos tends to be necessary but is it the same for nee-sans? NBR imoutos tend to be tsunderes while NBR nee-sans tend to be childhood friends or keiki. I don't think blood relation is quite as essential for nee-sans but I would entertain some differing opinions on this matter.            She's plainly average an pesonality is unappealing, but the main problem is really the Sorafags. They always hijack imouto threads to blow up how important they are, but in reality, they're so few they YnS threads either die out of suffer from constant samefagging.    Then they aren't fucking onee-sans if they're not blood related. They're just extermely close people.     Blood relation isn't important for nee-sans but it's important for imoutos  It's either one or the other fuckface, you can't have separate standards for both. Fucking hell this is why nee-san fags are scum.      I didn't realize that Sora wasn't allowed in imouto threads. To think, she's not an imouto even though she's constantly referred to as such.      blood relation is essential to the whole thing. I'm not sure you're actually have the same interests, maybe you just like older childhood friends, like you said.     Twin sister who walks the line. Her fierce loyalty is her best feature and if she works on her faults she would be perfect.     Her entire arc is about her working on her faults and overcoming the most egregious ones. Unfortunately the anime glossed over this.     So the biological relation is what makes the archtype? Here I thought character traits were far more important.    I DO have seperate standards for both what are you gonna do about it? And look at you taking the highground, you wouldn't resort to namecalling would you.   I'm honestly an ara ara kind of guy, thanks for not calling me a fuckface.          Character traits don't make someone a sister, it is blood.    NBR nee-sans are trash. You are giving all nee-san fags a bad name.    Nee-san fags already gave themselves a bad name since 90% of the nee-sans they post are NBR. This is why we should stop including them in our threads.    You realize that imouto and onee-san refer to sisters, right? Not just girls that are younger/older than you.     4,5,11   M-Muh duck!     I find 12 to be the hottest.    But character traits make the archtype.   I just venture into these threads because of the nee-san/christmas cake overlap. They represent traits I like.   They also refer to a set of character traits portrayed in most anime and manga.          But that's not what we're talking about here. Learn to context.        <br/>        I agree. It just looks so affectionate and lovely.   Either. ;_;   Kirino please go and don't bother the pthwr imoutos. Kyousuke is waiting for you in bed.     other  Fuck me, that came out wrong.       Fuck off, you contrarian faggot.   Wrong, you idiot. We talk about Sora because no one posts any other fucking imoutos until hours later and we're keeping an incest thread alive.        4chan must be why my sister doesn't want my dick   scapegoat yuri like a faggot when your life isn't even fucking anime and manga     becuz i sed so         I noticed the thread turned into shit right about two hours ago, the moment they start posting.     Yea it's my fault, not the people shitposting.      implying kirino doesn't shitpost while laying in Kyousuke's bed with her bare ass hanging out the bottom of his old shirt        God damn that is a lewd ass figure.     The root of the problem is probably the degree of how obnoxious the fanbase is in general. A lot of people are turned off the moment you enter, because we don't want to associate with you. We figured out how obnoxious you are to other characters in yns, and we see how obnoxious you are to other sisters, especially older sisters, so it's kind of natural to connect the dots.       am i cool yet?   No, you're a tryhard hipster faggot.        Oh sure, all shitposting is me and totally no one else.  I'm not going to pretend I am 100% innocent but you really don't have any actual proof that any of what you are saying was done by me.        obnoxious to other characters in YnS    obnoxious to other sisters, especially nee-sans   Not even a whiteknight. You're full of fucking shit.       You've either never been into an yns thread to see how much they shit on nao, or you're in denial, refusing to see how much they've shat up this thread.     blame the anon getting shitposted, not the shitposters      They can be secretly, but it has to come out at some point.     It's not easy to make out.  Even shitposts against could in reality be mere retaliation to how much you shitposted in the past and maybe even well deserved. I'm not one to judge that. All I know is there's history between the two factors.        While I will be the first one to say that Nao is 3rd best girl, you aren't exactly doing her any favors by whining about some people hating her.     People, not including me, hate Nao for raping Haru and having the most boring route.  As soon as that anon posted about Sora alone being an example of how good imoutos are contrarian faggots got obnoxious and you're not going to attack them instead? Bullshit.      Did you even read the idiot post I replied to?  Are you simply denying that post exist and that my post came up from thin air?     Onee-sama all day every day   best girl    Because karma What comes around goes around.  People react to you negatively because you've behaved negatively.        I completely agree with the guy you were responding to though, you are full of shit. For some reason you have a problem with me or one of the other 4 Sora posters (probably me since I post the most) and now you are trying to construe the silly contrarian shitposting that has been happening since day one on 4chan, long before I ever started posting Sora mind you, as some kind of "karma" because I...post Sora which in your mind is some kind of unforgivable crime.      how much you shitposted in the past   First of all, faggot, I'm not either of those handful of Sora loving anons. In every thread I've seen them in I have never seen them doing anything but either post a little carelessly or properly defend her while posting plenty of images and occasionally amusing comments.     <br/>   Well, once you are ready to accept reality, you can come back to my post that explains where you went wrong.  The first step involves you to start behaving and stop throwing shit against other characters.      I should have realized eventually people were going to start more commonly being contrarian faggots even about a harmless girl and imouto like Sora with a civil enough fanbase.  I hope /v/ isn't leaking.       stop throwing shit against other characters   How about stop pulling shit out your ass and post some archive links if you feel so sure?      Your fanbase isn't civil Anon. Back when you had yns thread, it was full of shit slinging even back then.     I officially think this guy is a master baiter  heh   fucking hell I'm 27 and that can make me giggle  and he has effectively strung us along.  I shall stop responding or just go "K" to him like I do everyone else that's baiting, I suggest you do the same but hell that's up to you maybe you find his delusions fun.       You are anonymous. You don't have to defend your personal reputation because you don't have one. By trying to do so you are only shitting up the thread even more.    not even 300 posts   Merely a diversion.      Yea I've already come to that conclusion in      be onii-san   imouto is over 10 years younger   never see her as anything but a little kid       defending themselves is shitting up the thread   not the faggots making baseless claims       That simply means you will be more susceptible if you ever notice her womanly charms.     It was leaking for a while, I think. I remember sauce? posts in almost every fucking thread. Good thing that crap isn't all that welcome here.     You should do fun things with her.     Defending myself or whatever won't change the simpletons mind and all it does is give him more posts to air his madness and fewer posts dedicated to imoutos and the 3 BR nee-sans that actually exist.     Any idea what Meleefaggots do on /a/? I want more reasons to hate them.  Or do they just bitch about how the latest anime isn't the exact same as their favorite in the same genre regardless of its own merits?       dat webm     Same. Mine's cute though so it's okay. So long as she doesn't end up a bitch when she hits puberty, she'll be alright.   How many imoutos do you see here?  Has TLR taken any more steps towards the harem plan or was it just a shitty ruse after all?  I'm so sick of fake harems.      1 is the imouto of the MC, the other is the imouto of another character, the other two are boring.      Is this a trick question?  Three seems about right.       3 and one bitch that needs to die. Can you guess who is the bitch?     No, it's foreshadowing Miyu's brother is GOAT onii-chan     why do i live     So long as she doesn't end up a bitch when she hits puberty, she'll be alright.   Implying any girl doesn't become a bitch at that age.  I prey for you.       No one has translated this yet       You all missed best imouto.       NBR   not even inseki   WCW shit <br/>       No I mentioned her, she was in the boring category.      The two big girls looks so stupid, yet I can't stop wanting to fuck them.  I realise this would make imouto sad if I actually did this. I can only hope she grows up soon enough before the other two meat demons tempt me too much.      Who is the manliest aniki?   The sleepy aniki.    Kamina    Imouto.   I don't either so I like both, call me a tasteless faggot because I want everything.   *don't have      I think it's cute when brother and sister can't help but to have sex all the time.    But her ass isn't eve showing!    Isn't the Imouto a slut and the Onii-chan a faggot in that show?   My imouto used to be a precious one! Then boys and drugs entered her life. I want to rip the boys apart.    Thinking Len &amp; Rin are siblings    Onee-san i don't want to spoil someone, i want to be spoiled.   To be honest I wouldn't. I'd fuck a slightly older woman who plays that role however, that's the appeal for me.   As long as its Mikan not Kirino, im happy.  i want a suteki onee chan with a mio kind of personality  and then when she gets scared of lightning or something like that, i hear a knock on my door and she wants to climb into my bed  sho ga nai nee, nee chan        Onee-chans, of course.  They can step on you and berate you and you can't hit them back.       I'll never understand wanting to be dominated.    I'll never understand not wanting to be dominated.    Sounds like a beta thing, wanting to be controlled and abused.    Onee-chan x imouto    But those can't breed and impregnate.  It's better when it's brother and sister, two puzzle pieces who first each other.      checked    At least there a manga    I'm sure some yurifag would call you out on that.    Those people doesn't belong to /a/ though    Damn, I want that but options are either:  opened, "stained" on Mandarake   440GBP on Amazon       These two should just have sex already. They fit so well together. Like a T being inserted into a U.  I wouldn't fault anyone for wanting Mikan, no one would fault him for that.     &lt;-    stained  How stained is stained? Like somebody's cum made her shirt crusty stained?    You shouldn't really discard either. Lots of interesting combinations can be made from both older and younger.  Tsukihi is younger, but she's this sage at the same time. Albeit a bit inexperienced, she always has interesting advice, and fun to talk to and joke around with.  An older sister version would unlock her the super wise sage mode. I'd like to see something like this too actually.         Shit with a random whore.      Go away with your nbr.     It's always amazing when you can conquer an older girl in my opinion.  Since it's difficult as hell, the starts need to align, but it's so awesome when it happens.        These are completely irrelevant to this thread and serve as further proof of nee-san fags being plebs with no standards.     I feel sorry for True Oneesanfags that have to share a title with pretenders.    I think it's okay though. Sometimes when you're single child, you would need to settle for what you can get.  I don't mind adoptive older sisters.      Was it rape?    Starts fingering her   He's just pretending to be asleep, right?     There's a lot of hearts so I doubt it.  She's attacking him aggressively, but he can attack back at her weak part, with his penis, repeatedly.      He was clearly cowering in that tiny panel    Pretty much.  In the latest TLRD chapters, we actually had a title called "First accident", the first time something happened accidentally.  That means for all these years, Rito had been groping the girls very specifically and with intent, while pretending otherwise.          that pose  Gets me everytime     But why is she so peefect, /a/?     Perfect  I'm obviously not perfect like her.    Imouto for life   So all those "accidents" I see sometimes aren't accidents but him groping girls and getting away with it? What a louse.   Imouto, especially those with twintails and a touch of tsun.    yuri incest   It's shit. Keep them separate or you ruin both flavors, idiot.   It's better because brother and sister is just that fucking good while sistercest needs twins just to not be shit.         I can't really agree with you there.  Older sister and younger sister is better than same age any day. It's also more rare to succeed, because the older sibling is constantly tempted by other peers at its age and ever older peers. And this tempting will constantly happen over a long time before the younger sibling matures enough to be attractive to the older sibling.  That's why I think it's more miraculous when they succeed.         Okaa -chan    My issue is with the multiple taboos. It comes off less as romance and more tryhard in general.    It sucks more being in the middle with 9 sisters     tfw my sister became a super-bitch at puberty but then chilled out tremendously a few years later as if to apologize and now we're best bros   and she lets me see her in panties sometimes     I think there is also something very pure and romantic about older sister loving her little brother.  If she accepts him as her man even though he is still small and can't fully penetrate her yet, it requires something else, more extraordinary in their relationship.      Pretty much the exact same for me. She turned emo (literally) in middle school, but when she got older she stopped being edgy, and now we talk about comics and play video games and shit.   haven't seen her in panties, but basically everything else at this point        Fuck your sister already.      It always surprise me, /a/sisters seems to be the best girl of the bunch. They can be unbearably bitchy at times, but they're also bros and pure sex.    I'm trying         Good luck    All in good time.   Probably because everyone else decides they permanently hate their sisters the moment they enter the bitchy puberty phase.       This image always gets me.  the aroused face of the imouto   pantsu dangling from her left feet   pack of condoms on the pillow   wet spots from love juice on the sheets          Good luck  We already life partners anyway    Probably because everyone else decides they permanently hate their sisters the moment they enter the bitchy puberty phase.  And as said after that, their adult form is better because they're boner-inducing best bros.          I don't know if she wants it.   On any given day, she'll go from hanging out in my room in a t-shirt and pantsu or chilling on the couch with her feet practically on my penis, to randomly starting discussions about how some Swedish guy/Egyptian king/Game of Thrones character fucked their sister and how "That's totally disgusting." I don't know which hint I should be taking.        /a/     Looking back my Imouto dropped hints all the time that I only noticed after she become an angry SJW tumblrite. Proceed at your own discretion.    Imouto is the only way to wincest.    correct her with the D.         I don't know if she wants it.  Mah nigga      My relationship with my older sister is more or less like the one in that image. People with shitty family relations need to stop projecting.    tfw no imouto to pamper and spoil.   tfw you'll never have an imouto that'll cling to you   tfw you'll never get overprotective over your imouto    On the bright side I get money from time to time from my onee-sans and one of them is loli-sized        That is one puffy vulva   Kaga is love Kaga is life  I miss the daily prayer anons     Nagato should have gotten all the anime after the war.   towyen pls   meant for     http://pastebin.com/y07u27f1 http://exhentai.org/g/796958/fdc7b9<wbr>c7b4/</wbr>     Eugen is cute but she has too much ass.

Mai waifu, so happy I married her.    too much ass  Wat.     Nonsense, this is one is just a harmless joke due to something that actually happened in history. I even went and checked the source jpwiki used, though it took a while to find the specific page.    More annoying than Urakaze and Dragons attention whores?    More annoying than Kagafags?   How to make Kaga fall in love with you?   Marry her.    But she won't agree to marry you unless she loved you.    Beat her.    Same way you make Ooi crave for your dick, a ring.   I will post this occasionally until you like her.   You dont, the only thing on her head is Akagi and food.     Kagafags   annoying       Akagi     Shower her with love of course     Fucking slut.... (note: due to the font i can't actually tell what's being said, but it would fit Ushio's response)      Nagamon in charge of new Sakaki in Kantaimanga Daioh    Hell, doesn't lot of people mix up Yuugumo-class as KagePro-class?        Stalker     Noshiro-class was also something that happened historically.    The only words I can make out are "摆么," which means "showing off" or "putting out," and given the circumstances and Ushio's response, it seems like Wo is accusing Ushio of being immodest.  Hence "fucking slut."      Oh I thought that said Ushio was saying fucking slut.    Does she have Japanese cold? That's kinda life threatening.    Well, but it won't happen, unfortunately    Kaga is always hot.    The OP really wants to kill her    tfw your destroyer turns into a Toyota     orig.jpg  Is getting caught part of the plan?

Who is going to bury them then?      Why do they give a shit? They're dead.    Mutsu's a pretty good girl too.      Why would you marry Kaga and not get her pregnant? Would you buy an onahole and never finish inside of it?    Nagato is a failure of a secretary ship.    Because War.

Im still waiting for that Taigei version, also thank you kawaii hat.         marrying Yamagumo     Oboro  There's quite a bit of married Oboro, actually. She isn't that obscure.      How about Mikazuki?    She's relevant for being irrelevant.    Yeah I kind of guessed that, after all her desdiv is quite popular.  That looks like a tough one, I know a Kikuzukifag, but never ever seen a Mikazuki one, even if she's cute.        Mikazuki  Too easy, I even chanced upon this one last night.     Post girls you hate. I'll start: Ooi.   You    She's not too bad tbh    If I didn't have favorite already, I'd be stuck between Arare and Mikazuki     Kongo     Refrain    But I'm not a little girl.

Yuura    Now that I think about it, I'm kind of surprised Yukikaze doesn't have a larger role in any of the other media.   I wonder why that is.     Yura.    Because she only brings death to her own fleet.    She brings bad luck to everyone else.    Somehow I get the feeling that you just drew it and posted it here. Hmm, Wakaba.   yfw Shinano by Huke        Yura is surprisingly popular, actually.     Shittiest hotel because she looks like shit. Godawful character design.    hating Ooi  There is only one man responsible for this.    She's like a CL version of Shigure,of course she is  I still se her hair as white .    Thanks for the translation, Prinz a cute.      One's good luck should not constitute the causing of bad luck.      Saw this a few weeks back. She's not too obscure either.   I'm no artist.   Wakaba  Hold on.          Nevertheless it happens.    not knowing about Yura's war history    wheredoyouthinkyouare.jpg    Who is this? New event ship?    It did during the war whenever Shigure, Yukikaze, and Zuikaku sortied.    I probably laughed more than I should have when a Yukikaze hit my Yamashiro to red in one hit in PVP.   Kaga literally has the perfect personality to be a wife and mother.   She had good luck, but she also caused everyone around her to have bad luck.  Even 53 luck Hatsushimo suffered. I figure that if Shigure and Zuikaku had sortied with her together they'd have sunk within a year or two.      You're baiting the faggot from the previous thread, aren't you?    How so?    She's the type of girl you can live your whole life with, and not get "bored" within a few months, or want to kill yourself because she's annoying.    Which lines suggest that?    But Kaga is boring as fuck.     This one is really cute, should I dump it here?     At least explian why, I hate her, but Im not an idiot. The replies I got the last thread means that I was spot on.    Kaga is just a Mother's helper.    So you did fall for his bait, how boring.    Fuck, forgot pic.    I know what is he trying, but what else should we discuss then?    Art looks like shit so no.    How about something about a girl you don't hate like a smart individual would do? Or do you really want to shitpost that much? Why don't you make yourself useful and go typeset something?    Which boat u wud fug.     boat     This boat.

Volume 2 Prologue Page 3 Panel 1 The Fight So Far Narration: The newbie Admiral Mizumoto reported to Maizuru Naval District and, together with destroyer Fubuki, set sail for the waters dominated by the Abyss.  Panel 2 Narration: From construction and sorties, they gathered new comrades.  Panel 3 TTK: Nansei Islands Defense Line, captured! * Map 1-4 Fubuki: We've broken through the Sea of the Naval District! * Map 1 * Chapter 7  Panel 4 Narration: Afterward, while completing a quest at that same map, they cried over their first failure.  Panel 5 Narration: Even so, they got Fleet Carrier Akagi from a quest. And when they captured the next map in the Nansei Islands, Bashi Island, they got Fast Battleship Kirishima. * Map 2 and Map 2-3 They steadily built a strong combat force, but...

Page 4 Panel 1 Narration: With Ooshio's dismantling, they had their first parting experience. They then joined the Autumn [2013] Event...  Panel 2 Narration: "Decisive Battle! Escape Ironbottom Sound!" Title: Anchorage Demon Kuma: Bam kuma!! Narration: The persistence of the shipgirls in battle got us all the way to Lunba Point! * E2  Panel 3 Narration: Sometimes they shipgirls would teach... Blackboard: Regarding Attack Order Narration: Sometimes they would encourage...  Panel 4 TTK: Finally, we've captured it... our first great obstacle, Nansei Islands' Okinoshima! * Map 2-4  Panel 5 Narration: And then, from the two maps they could sortie to afterward, they chose the Northern Seas! * Map 3    small c  Stop trying to push that shit, nobody gives a fuck.

Fubuki: Because everyone's... already preparing!

Chapter 23 The Admiral and the Carrier-based Aircraft Development Festival  Page 6 Panel 1 Ryuujou: In honor of the capture of the Nansei Islands... * Map 2 Kirishima: Mic OK♡ SFX: Yay, yay Ryuujou: the "Carrier-based Aircraft Development Festival" has begun!  Panel 2 Ryuujou: Progress will be covered by me, Light Carrier Ryuujou, and - Fubuki: I, Fubuki - Jun'you: and me, Jun'you! * deeeeesu  Panel 3 Ryuujou: Fubuki, what do you think about equipment development? (Here you go) Fubuki: Once, around the time Commander only had six shipgirls,  Panel 4 Fubuki: he burnt up all our materials on equipment development. Since then, he hasn't had any passion for development, I think...  Panel 5 Fubuki: But now Commander's level is over 50, isn't it! Sign: Moderator Fubuki: So Commander's making a comeback! SFX: Gulp Ryuujou: Now for the Admiral's debut at the factory!  Panel 6 Ryuujou: Serving as secretary is the one that brought us victory during the capture of Okinoshima, Kaga! Let's give it a shot! * She stops using Kansai-ben for this panel SFX: Cheers Jun'you: Let's go all out! All out! * Battle start line   This wiki doesn't seem as cancerous as the wikia, unless you've got a problem with the tuhu guys hosting it.   Kantai Collection, also known as KanColle   KanColle Wiki Staff  Also note that they use KanColle with an uppercase too right on their front page, so I guess you're fucked buddy.                                             Oh so you're that faggot from /jp/ that keeps getting angry about the new wiki being posted in the OP.    Page 7 Panel 1 SFX: Murmur, murmur Mogami: Heh~♪  Panel 2 Ryuujou: Oh my... this is! A surprise result is stirring up the Naval District! Somehow, somehow, our very first development was... Jun'you: [Loud breath]  Panel 3 Ryuujou: A suuuper powerful, +9 anti-air carrier-based fighter! "Shiden Kai Ni"!! [holy shit] SFX: Tadaa! Jun'you: Hyaha~!!  Panel 4 Ryuujou: Even with a reasonable amount of resources, we succesfully developed way stronger equipment than we expected! SFX: Cheers TTK: Awawawa~ Crab: Awawawawa~ Ryuujou: The Admiral's all worked up!  Panel 5 Akagi: Incredible! Raiden: Clap, clap  Panel 6 Kaga: Akagi-san... Ryuujou: This result has even the serious Kaga smiling!  Panel 7 Ryuujou: Oh, the Admiral's taken a liking to it!! TTK: Let's see... Ryuujou: The Admiral's pushing his luck and continuing with the same resource inputs! He's trying to mass-produce Shiden Kai Ni!  Panel 8 Fubuki: C-commander...  Panel 9 Ryuujou: Fubuki looks on with unease! Jun'you's... drunk too much and is already falling asleep! What're ya doing, Jun'you!? Jun'you: Funya~                                                 The site design on wiki is better in my opinion (don't have to scroll left or right to see all the info in a chart or the quest log) but it needs more people editing. For example Yamashiro does not any of her Kai Ni lines listed on Wiki.     For example Yamashiro does not any of her Kai Ni lines listed on Wiki.  One day I'll learn how to edit wikis.     I kind of want to do it too, but I didnt do anything html based in years, a super basic guide would be helpful.     I'm not /kcg/fag, I think the steam group is just as cancerous. And it turns out that the wikia, while still cancerous, is actually somewhat less so.  Still, if it were up to me wikiwiki would be the only wiki in the OP.    This wiki doesn't seem as cancerous as the wikia  I used to think that way too until they showed their true colours.  http://en.kancollewiki.net/wiki/Kan<wbr>colle_Wiki  small c  </wbr>             Page 8 Panel 2 Ryuujou: That's that!! With about 5000 bauxite used, the Carrier-based Aircraft Development Festival's now over!  Panel 3 Ryuujou: Kaga, what're your thoughts? Kaga: I feel exhilarated. * Paraphrase of equipment line Ryuujou: These are the other carrier-based aircraft we've developed besides the Shiden Kai Ni!  Panel 4 Ryuujou: The Admiral's delighted by the enhancement to our air power! Carrier-based Dive Bomber "Suisei Model 12A" Carrier-based Fighter "Type 52 Zero" Carrier-based Torpedo Bomber "Tenzan" Ryuujou: ...is what I thought, but what's this?  Panel 5 Ryuujou: Why're ya so down?  Panel 6 TTK: If we had these equips back when we were capturing Okinoshima, things could've been so much easier for everyone...  Panel 7 SFX: [Lean over] Jun'you: Admiral, it's all good. TTK: Jun'you...  Panel 8 Jun'you: The carrier-based aircraft we developed today will help us from here on out. Don't forget to be thankful for all the aircraft that fought for us up until now! Jun'you: That'd be fine! TTK: Ju-Jun'you!!  Panel 9 Jun'you: 'cause of that, we should have another equipment development celebration, alright? TTK: Eh!? Ryuujou: Eh... the drunkard's started talking again, so let's end here.  Festival adjourned!   Oh, I have no idea about the site quality, I just noticed the lack of wikia bloat and a comments section.   If you think I support "cancer" because I made a stylistic choice, then so be it.                                                    I can see Kongou marrying an anon     The comments section, while cancerous most of the time, actually helped the wikia during the event; errors in drop lists were quickly corrected. And wikiwiki also has a comment section too.    Page 9 Panel 1 Fubuki: Commander, we're almost at the equipment storage limit. TTK: We'll need to dispose of the excess...  Panel 2 TTK: We've got a bit of excess left over... We can scrap things like the Type 0 Recon Seaplane and 14cm Naval Gun...  Panel 3 KTKM: Eh... Gun scrapping?  Panel 4 TTK: Sorry... KTKM: This elegance...  I guess I got too attached to it, huh... * Bit of a paraphrase of battle start line  Panel 5 KTKM: But, well... when you become obsolete, I guess renewal has it's own elegance. I know! How about -  Panel 6 KTKM: firing a final salute?  Panel 8 TTK: A salute... for the equipment to which we are so indebted! SFX: Ba-boom To be continued  Well shit, now I can't scrap equips without feeling bad either.

Because its similar to how I imagine Mikasa looking as a ship girl. Mikasa should be in the game as a stats boosting unit like Akashi or Mamiya. You have Mikasa and you get a boost to your battleships shooting stats. Her role should be fleet gunnery instructor.     Very cute, my wife is beautiful   Kawaii kawaii Murakumo.  I want to tickle Kongou's feet   There are way better Kaga cosplay sets.

There are regular bikinis that don't make girls look like mega-sluts.        Micro bikinis on flat or small breasted girls don't even look slutty to me, just cute.

Disappointing.      Coma Cheese  I don't get the joke.    Now that's alpha.    "So you really are good at cooking."    "Do you not believe my words, Senpai?"    "No, not really... I just thought that you're incredible."    "Haa? Are you making passes at me again?"    Isshiki shoves spoon into 8man's mouth.    "Do you hate that level of sweetness?"    "...I don't."    "Ah, but I wasn't talking about the flavor..."    She was almost touching her lips and slightly turned to me, searching for the answer with her eyes. I tasted the sweetness in my mouth and gave Isshiki the words she was waiting for.    "Even so, my answer is the same."    "Is that so..."    Iroha starts thinking of something and her gaze drops to the bowl. She then hastily lifts her head.    "Thanks for the reference, I'm off then. Hayama-senpai~"    8man wipes chocolate from his cheek and licks it.    "Too sweet..."                               Fresh thread! Fuck yeah /a/  Spoilers from volume 11:  Yukino gives 8man the chocolate.   Spoilers from volume 11:   Iroha won't be in volume 12 because Sensei is going to make sure she's not slacking off at the Service Club     Yukino? I thought Yui was the one giving them.  Better for Yukinofags like me     Reminder   “Huh? W-What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, it won’t work out. There’s someone I like.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, you’re aiming too high. It’s creepy too and not possible.”   “Ha! Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, for an instant that made my heart skip a bit, but now that I think about it rationally, it really wouldn’t work out.”   “…Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, I do like them older, but it really wouldn’t work out.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me while I’m heartbroken? I’m sorry, it’s still not possible just yet.”   “Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a boyfriend just because we went out to have fun for a bit, I’m sorry, please do that only after we do this a few more times.”    “In any case, today turned out to be a good learning experience. Thank you very much.”   Isshiki lightly bowed, honestly expressing her appreciation. Taken aback by her earnest and mannerly behavior, I replied back awkwardly in a fluster. Isshiki lifted her face and laughed in amusement.   “…Senpai, make sure to keep today in mind, okay?”    I was interrupted by Isshiki’s sliding movement towards my side.   “That’s why, for now…”   Isshiki stopped her words there and moved her lips to my ears as if to say something secretly with deceiving eyes at the end.   She added some spice smeared with sugar.   “You’re the only one that I’ll act this way with, senpai.”   These were flirtings.                      Spoiler that shit next time, jesus.    Summary of the entire LN:  -Yui being a retarded whore who can't even say her true feelings and now is getting BTFO because she wants to live a lie -Yukino is a worthless bitch who can't fix her own mess and try to ask for help to everyone, first hayama, then Haruno and now 8man. Fucking dependant whore. -8man is an edgy faggot who try to find muh genuine even if he have that on his face but he's too retarded to make a single desition because he's just a coward. -Haruno take the antagonist role just because all those 3 faggots can't even realize they are living a lie. -Hayama a cunt -SENSEI IS THE ONLY TRUE ENDING BUT WATARI IS A CUCKLORD SO HE'S GOING TO PICK YUI OR YUKINO  Seriously how people can like something writen this badly?             Fuck off retard, stop posting false information      I'll make a summary   Seriously how people can like something writen this badly?      Friendly reminder  To those complaining about Spyro's translations having mistakes, many people here are happy enough to have his translations. Spyro is a damn blessed soul for them. An official translation means having to wait years until it reaches the point where we currently stand, and we don't want that. I will read it raw too because japanese isn't a problem to me, but that's not the case for others here so stop being a retarded fucktards and show some appreciation to Based Syro at least. He's doing this for free. Fucking plebs    Meta cuck   Marvelous.    I'm gonna miss you after this all over. See you in another thread in summer, I guess   No matter how much shitposting we make, you're all great, anons. Couldn't ask for a better, fucking twisted community. Fuck you all anons, fuck you all.    Blatant shitposter obviously trying to false-flag one of the smallest and weakest waifu factions.   Nigga go fuck yourse-   Doesn't bother including Iroha   kek'd. Carry on you gigantic faggot.           Implying he's not falseflagging falseflag     So he's not  genuine ?    Wait, would that mean he's actually a senseifag, or that he intended for his post to be called out as a false flag?   Little sister won right?   She already won before Hachiman got turned down by Orimoto    too lewd    I think this comic will answer your question  (1/3)      Hachiman teachings:  “It’s obvious they did that so no one would suspect them. If it were me, I would’ve avoided slandering one of them on purpose to frame them.”  He intended to be called out as an irohafag falseflagging a weak faction. Either a senseifag who wanted pity or an anti-irohafag      (2/3)    (3/3)    The best.     As to be expected     Maybe so, but I figured that given how Irohafags have been clinging to Iroha's spoon thing that taking a jab at her irrelevance by leaving her out would be far more damning than the meaningless words tossed at everyone else.   Making me read at 4 am   It's a commie meme sub. It sounds like she's saying that but the real joke is that she thought he was talking about the rice which CR surprisingly got right.     Reading  What kind of american are you?     I have a hunch that you are a yukinofag trying to falseflag and frame irohafags   In all honesty, 8man's behavior in the spoon-feeding scene is pretty suspect, and it's possible Iroha realized it too. (Thus her ambiguous reaction to the exchange.) Namely, between the "words she was waiting for" and the "Too sweet" line at the end, there are implications that 8man wasn't being entirely genuine with Iroha here during the spoon dialogue.  The question is, what does it mean if he wasn't? 8man outright lying to Iroha would be an extreme step out of his usual character. Even if he's guilty of falling into non-genuine patterns in the past, he usually never does it directly through dialogue, but instead manufacturing situations where it's not necessary to do so. (Such as the whole valentine's event.) Therefore, even if he isn't being honest with her, it becomes an equally (if not moreso) big event specifically because he's not being honest with her.  In previous scenarios where 8man's non-genuine, it's usually been a misguided and fear-driven attempt to maintain (or, in his words, "protect") something he doesn't want to lose. Take the club for instance, which he effectively froze into a status quo because he was afraid the election would cause their friendship to dissolve. When he stopped being non-genuine with the club, it's not like he gave up on the club itself. He got exactly what he wanted and the club became closer and more "genuine".  1/2          Now let's look at this instance, 8man is clearly being forward with Iroha in this case. Normally when she's being sly and flirtatious he'll tsukkomi, brush it off, or generally not give a proper answer. In this case he actually answers in a positive fashion: "I didn't dislike it." 8man isn't cold/dishonest enough to use Iroha's feelings for utility, so if he's being non-genuine in returning her flirtation it's because he's afraid of what not flirting will do with their relationship. 8man's non-genuine actions stay true to what he genuinely wants, but pursue them in the wrong manner.  For these reasons, even if he's not being genuine in his dialogue with Iroha, it still seems to demonstrate a desire to build a romantic relationship on his part. Furthermore it's not likely that it's "I have to humor her to preserve our friendship", as 8man has been aware of Yui's feelings for quite a while but has not given her the same sort of treatment. It goes without saying that something as cliche as "this isn't genuine, I actually love X" is unlikely, as his prior development shows that a non-genuine attempt to be with Iroha will be backed by a genuine desire to do so.   In conclusion I'd say that Iroha has very likely won 8man's affection, but she has not yet won the 8bowl. The simple reason being that since Watari put in those implications, it's most likely so he can capitalize on them for later drama. As an Irohafag I'm actually pleased about this because, quite frankly, it wouldn't be good writing if things were so simple. Iroha's best and most endearing moment is when she was on the train after being rejected, and she really hasn't been given any particularly emotional scenes other than that. There's upcoming roadbumps but, assuming 8man doesn't catastrophically fuck things up, their relationship will be all the better for it in the end.  2/2           You should stop if you don't even know what those 3 pages were about.    Can't fall asleep so it might help but it was like only 4 minutes long    It's not that Commie didn't got it wrong, it's that it makes sense. I don't know how CR translated it but if they went "Komachi? Who's that, rice?" they went full retard.    We should wait until some anon gives us a proper translation of all six pages, and not just a summary. For instance, I don't know if he said "too sweet" or just "sweet" (amai)     This is kind of a stretch, and that coming from a guy who was happy to see 8man shift from "this was irresponsible of me" to "how do I even ask someone out" with Yui's promise date.     Are you seriously believe that everybody in your fanbase is completely innocent and can do no wrong? And is it somehow always Yukinofags fault?    It's become a bit of a meme to blame literally everything on Yukinofags evwn though literally the only ones waifufagging are Irohafags.    mu dik   Also, despite that I also enjoyed keep talking about saliva and flirting as if they really exists. But in fact this part only has one meaning: It's hinted that Iroha will make a move in the valentine day (or later) using the "preference" she got from 8man in this scene.   He says 甘すぎだな     Does he know? Do you think he still think that Iroha is going after Hayama? He can't be that dense right? A girl waited for him until he show up just to ask him about his choco preference.      Correct me if i am wrong.  From what happen in ,When Yui is saying she want everyone living in lie together with her. She trying to baiting 8man or Yukino to called out her bullshit.  8man bit it and desperate do another genuine speech to convince both Yui and Yukino back on track to find genuine thing together with him instead stray to superficiality.  After 8man speech done, when Yui saying it just like him and smiling.  8man realises Yui intention and that he (and possibly Yukino too) was the one that almost stray to superficiality makes him cry.         He states 甘いすぎだな when she walks away, when licking the chocolate from his cheek.  甘いすぎ literally translates to "too sweet".  That line alone is a pretty big warning flag, especially the way it's used. The "words she was waiting for" is more of an additional nail in the coffin.  And really, it comes down to simple narrative structure. There's no way in Iroha and 8man would get into a relationship without it running into some kind of drama before the end of the series, it wouldn't be refined if it isn't put to the test at any point.          I don't believe irohafags are completely innocent and free of shitposters. However, in this case, it's very unlikely for them to be behind that post. Why would we be so obvious at false-flagging, when we can just circlejerk about the (not confirmed yet) indirect kiss and their flirting afterwards?  Once you discarded irohafags, then the culprit has to be either yukinofag or yuifag. And there are 3 reasons why a yukinofag is most likely behing that post:  He shitted on Yui before Yukino (while the normal order would be Yukino and Yui). He did the same with who will win (Yui first, then Yukino)   Between yukinofags and yuifags, the first ones tend to be more anti-irohafags than the latter (I call it not-first-girl sympathy)   Sensei is like an adult Yukino (although this argument is subjective)           いすぎ     Yes, that was why some anon said she is the hero Service Club deserve.    Feel free to elaborate.  I did maybe go a bit too strongly by taking it for granted that 8man already likes Iroha, but at the very least things are heading in that direction.  The 嫌いじゃねえけど was a very significant statement by 8man. What is currently in question is the exact motivations behind him saying it.       Iroha will win, right?   Now you're projecting  Who's to say it's not Totsukafag or even Hayacuckfag?  Really, no one is fucking innocent. Best bet is to assume all falseflaggers are neutral party who wanted to see the thread burn  Which is what happened with almost every thread anyway.         「えいっ！」 一色の声と一緒に、頬をかすめてスプーンが口に突っ込まれる。突然の出来事<wbr>にもごっとまごつき、目を白黒させていると、その明滅する視界の中で、一色<wbr>が蠱惑的に笑った。 「先輩、こういう甘いの、お嫌いですか？」 スプーンをふりふりしながら、小首を傾げ、一色は上目遣いにこちらを見る。<wbr>いたずらに成功した子供のように得意げな口元の微笑みと、女の子らしく挑発<wbr>的に胸を張る姿はアンバランスで、だからこそひどく魅力的に映る。 「……嫌いじゃねぇけど」 糖分はきっとそこまでではないのだろうけれど、舌が痺れるほどに甘い。てい<wbr>うか、そのスプーンさっき使ってやつじゃないの……、そういうことされると<wbr>ほんと心臓に悪いからやめてほしい……。 疲労には甘いものがいいと言うが、この手の心労には逆効果らしい。どっと押<wbr>し寄せてくる疲れに思わず吐息を漏らすと、一色も同じようにため息を吐いた<wbr>。 「はぁ。別に味の感想聞いたわけじゃないんですけど」 口ぶりこそ興味がなさそうだったが、ちらと向けられた瞳には答えを待ってる<wbr>色がある。 俺は口の中に残る甘さを噛み締めながら、一色の言わんとするところを噛み砕<wbr>いた。</wbr> </wbr>  </wbr></wbr> </wbr></wbr>  </wbr></wbr>  </wbr></wbr>     3 reasons why a yukinofag is most likely behing that post:  All your reasons are bullshit      the words she was waiting for  He fucking knows, anon. He's not buying into the Hayama crap anymore.     She is there for the drama so not likely. She might be another Kuroneko    He picked up enough to give her a forward answer regarding the chocolate. Whether he has a solid idea of how she feels about Hayama I don't know, but whatever he thinks about it he's shown intent in getting closer to Iroha.   My mistake, it's pretty late.      「それでも、答えは変わらんな…」 「…そうですか」 一色は何事か考えるように、腕の中のボウルを見つめてふむふむと頷く。そし<wbr>てぱっと顔を上げた。 「参考になりました。じゃ、ちょっと行ってきますね。葉山せんぱーい！」 にこやかな微笑みで言うが早いか、一色はばたばたと駆け出していく。 それを見送りながら、ほっぺについたチョコを指で拭って口に運んだ。チョコ<wbr>レートとラム酒の香りが鼻を抜けていく。 「甘すぎだな……」 </wbr>   </wbr>     I'll be expecting your full thesis on how Yukinofags did everything wrong by friday. Don't let me down anon   Why is she using to pencils as chopsticks?   I can't figure out whether this is satire or just the ramblings of a retard    Guaranteed replies/10.     “You’re the only one that I’ll act this way with, senpai.”   MUH FUCKING DICK         W-where is the evidence?       Actually yeah, when you put it that way it's almost undeniable that 8man realizes what he's doing.  He's answering a girl who seemingly likes him by giving her "the words she was waiting for". It sounds like he's going after Iroha but with an eroge-esque mindset of acting with the express purpose of making the girl like you more.  In short, 8man's lack of relationship experience is going to fuck him over.         She is there for the drama  kek, she is there for comic relief       This is fucking delicious, 8man trying to go romantic on Iroha. Thank you Watari, you\re not that much of a cunt now.       Iroha finally wins   might actually just be getting Kuroneko'd   Kill me.      There is not going to be another Kuroneko for at least another decade. Everybody remembers what happened when she got kuroneko'd.     Yeah that's the only really glaring issue. You were building a solid argument, then completely jumped the shark by speculating that 8man might want to actively pursue romance with her.  I am interested in the 嫌いじゃねえけど debate though. I'm passingly familiar with the phrase, but I don't really into moon so I'm probably missing out on some nuance.  The best translation would be "I don't hate it but-" correct?          drama  It is out of her character to be all drama queen like. Even at her lowest when she was shown to be out of her depth during the stuco collab event and at the end of the disneyland, she never made a big deal out of it or cause huge drama.      I'm a Yuifag, but somehow I feel like Irohafags circle jerk is a lot more endurable than Yukinofags circle jerk.    It's nice now that its calmed down. It was goddamned unbearable right after the pages with the tasting scene got posted. Some of those guys turned the autism dial to 13 then broke the knob off.    We don't photoshop saliva or an actual kiss between the two and then shitpost those until the website's duplicate image system prevention kicks in.     The best translation would be "I don't hate it but-" correct?   「……嫌いじゃねぇけど」   But the pause is before the sentence, so it should be But I don't hate it. Another story would be that the pause was at the end, as if he didn't finish the sentence       Stop false flagging!     Just to add something to this, isn't Iroha the only one he went out of his way to talk to during the chocolate-making? Orimoto comes to him, Yukino calls him for chocolate-tasting, and Hayama just happens to be there while he's chilling by the wall. Iroha he actually walks up to and compliments for being able to make sweets, it's almost no surprise that she immediately responds with the hitting-on gag. And then of course we get the sweetness conversation from that.     Basically he thought for a long time before saying this line. His brain was shutting down.    She was made to lose.    The dots / pause came before the sentence. My guess would be "but I don't dislike/hate it". A comma or a repositioning of that pause would change everything.      You must be not here when the fake spoilers were posted for the first tiem.    How can one girl be so fucking best?     "So you really are good at cooking."    "Do you not believe my words, Senpai?"  now BTFO yui       How the fuck can you be mad about phoroshop? That's the only good thing to come out of these threads. Not to mention that scene was basically asking to be shopped.    Who the fuck is trying to raise false flags? Fucktards. Yuifags are at least easier to tolerate than Irohafags.   I'm not especially proficient myself but I'm pretty sure it's meaning changes contextually. What you're referring to would be more like 嫌いじゃねえ、けど。。。 which would firmly indicate the けど leads off into something else. When it's just used to end a standard sentence I think it turns into more of a slang/nuance that indicates a non-committal answer.  That said I'm really not an authority. I've heard けど end sentences a lot though and I don't recall it ever being something that significant. It really doesn't make sense contextually for 8man to be using lead-offs in that conversation either.     Holy shit this thread going mad again. Sasuga /a/, I'm going outta here.  Fuck the falseflagger, all of you.      Hayate  Hinagiku end when?     Wait, when did the spoon come off his mouth? The illustration shows this part  She was almost touching her lips and slightly turned to me, searching for the answer with her eyes.  And he still has the spoon on his mouth.      So basically Yui is Haruno's foil in this volume.    She intervenes when Haruno's needling are making things uncomfortable between Yukino and Hachiman during cooking event, even though it pains her.    When Haruno says she's moving in with Yukino, causing Yukino to despair, Yui invites her to stay with her.    At the end, Yui is the catalyst for the dialogue that leads to the service club finally starting to overcome the problems Haruno exposed.        thinking about what others said about the pause being in front, is it possible that he only vocalized the back half of a thought? like say "It's too sweet, but I don't hate it"     「……嫌いじゃねぇけど」"I don't hate it, but..."   「甘すぎだな……」"it's too sweet"       Yui is Haruno's foil   Since the beginning. Since Chiba Mura end. Haruno already knew that Yui will be a needle in her plan. Hence she showed unfavorable response to Yui, occasionally      Was that where 2ch was getting the idea that maybe he was rejecting her? Effectively saying "She's not bad, but too sweet for my tastes"  Related to that, how many times could the sweet/naive wordplay be a factor in that scene?       一色の声と一緒に、頬をかすめてスプーンが口に突っ込まれる。突然の出来<wbr>事にもごっとまごつき、目を白黒させていると、その明滅する視界の中で、一<wbr>色が蠱惑的に笑った。</wbr></wbr>  「先輩、こういう甘いの、お嫌いですか？」  スプーンをふりふりしながら、小首を傾げ、一色は上目遣いにこちらを見る<wbr>。いたずらに成功した子供のように得意げな口元の微笑みと、女の子らしく挑<wbr>発的に胸を張る姿はアンバランスで、だからこそひどく魅力的に映る。</wbr></wbr>   I'm cumming bucket now. God blesses Watari-sama.        That's where some of them were coming from, yeah. But then again, others just said that they're trying to read too much into it, that 8man is not going to BTFO somebody like that.      ていうか、そのスプーンさっき使ってやつじゃないの……、そういうことさ<wbr>れるとほんと心臓に悪いからやめてほしい……。</wbr>   Suck this denialfag, it's clearly stated that Iroha had used it before, and 8man is conscious about it.       Now that you mention it, I like that interpretation a lot. It ties in his answer to her question with the last line of the conversation very nicely.  Only thing that it leaves me wondering about is the "answer she was waiting for" bit though. On one hand it carries implications, but on the other it sounds kinda lewd.  I also have a foggier idea about the nuance of the scene now.        The waifufagging and shipping in these threads is absolutely intolerable. I stayed out of Yahari threads for the first half of the season until I caught up with the LNs and I came backing thinking there might be decent threads like before the anime aired, how stupidly mistaken was.   Do you fags actually enjoy spending your time on this shit?     so what do you think "...I don't hate it though" mean?     &gt;She was almost touching her lips and slightly turned to me, searching for the answer with her eyes. I tasted the sweetness in my mouth and gave Isshiki the words she was waiting for.   &gt;"Even so, my answer is the same."   &gt;"Is that so..."   &gt;Iroha starts thinking of something and her gaze drops to the bowl. She then hastily lifts her head.   &gt;"Thanks for the reference, I'm off then. Hayama-senpai~"  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;8 man wipes chocolate from his cheek and licks it.  &gt;"Too sweet...   He lied to her. Iroha ship sinking.             Do you fags actually enjoy spending your time on this shit?  Nah, but for some reason I always ended up in this place anyway.       Now we're going back to ground zero in their scene with no proper conclusion. This is when informality becomes a huge issue. People are supporing either side both here and in 2ch because of Watari's way of writing that.        「……嫌いじゃねぇけど」"I don't hate it, but..."  Shouldn't it be 「……嫌いじゃねぇけど...」or 「……嫌いじゃねぇ, けど...」 for that translation?     Pure love.     I have no doubt Watari wrote it deliberately to be ambiguous.  Sort of like Yukino's purported "I have become aware of Hachiman" line.        because of Watari's way of writing that.  Maybe it's intentional that he made it ambiguous? Watari is certified troll that like to rile up his fanbase.     So, Iroha ship is on the limbo right now? If that's so, then we'll have our answers only on volume 12.     Every ship is on the limbo, they've always been there since the start.  Watari is a troll, a cocktease and a possible hack.  News at 11.      Does it matter? Look at  It is not something negative and coffee max is sweet as fuck.      yukino is going to win  Nothing changed indeed.     Yukinofags unite. All enemy shitposters shall choke on their keyboards when Yui and Iroha get rejected by the 8man,    I really don't see how you can call that a rejection. Quite the opposite in fact, as 嫌いじゃない is often used as a confession-LITE. For the LN to spend that huge amount of time setting up Iroha and 8man only for him to go "thanks but no thanks" and drop her into obscurity would just be shoddy writing.   Also something worth mentioning, the entire "sweetness" metaphor used in that conversation is most likely a reference to 8man's date with Iroha in 10.5, during which he makes a bunch of "sugar and spice" metaphors about her. (Including saying she has "a bit of excess spice in her")  So in 10.5 8man says he's she's sweet and a little too spicy. In 11 he says she's too sweet, but he doesn't dislike it. What does it mean?        Why even bother?. This bowl was over from episode/volume 1. It's either her or no one.     「……嫌いじゃねぇけど」"I don't hate it, but..."  That should be tranlated as "...I don't dislike/hate it though". There's no comma splitting the sentence, nor ellipsis at the end of the sentence, so you can't get that "but..." meaning    Alright, just woke up from a come from 3 weeks.  What have I missed?  Did Iroha win?       I just want to see Iroha get rejected   The raw version makes me think he says "too sweet" as "too much to be believed".  Damn I really can't put it into words the right term.       character to be developed last   winning       First half of v11 has a bunch of Iroha flags Second half is yukinoshitas drama, 3some date, Yui going all out and Yukino finally deciding to say what she wants after 8man called all of them out for being not genuine.     I understand your point anon, but you're reading far too much into it. He simply says "Too sweet" and he doesn't dislike it.   Is there really gonna be only 1 more volume left? There's way too much shit for just 1   I wouldn't necessarily say we're "back" at ground zero. The scene implies big things in regards to Iroha either way, it's just not entirely clear to what end. In that sense we're much further along than before the LN came along.  And really, we've made a lot of progress from "holy shit they're basically having sex with sweetness metaphors Iroha won!" and "no fuck you this can't possibly be real!"       Did Iroha win?   She lost, 8man is not genuine with her.     What are these faces trying to convey? It's just harmless giri choco   http://peace.2ch.net/test/read.cgi/<wbr>bookall/1435077524/262  Lots of nips seem to believe that Yui has the highest chance of winning right now because of 8man's reaction after he received Yui's cookies.  Also kinda funny how they nicknamed Yukino Copypaste-non,  because apparently in one scene she repeated what 8man said.     </wbr>   So guys, what do you expect 1) a weak love triangle in the background 2) brutal and traumatizing love triangle 3) no love triangle     We still have the VN brothers , right?    Not harmless when the person you're interested in gets choco from another bitch. It's serious business. If they had AKs they would use them.     Well, it's 1 problem per volume so it will be enough. Will probably end at their spring time of their third years.      winning right now because of 8man's reaction   How he reacted?      Second, but it leads to bittersweet friendship end with hints of future romance    Nothing was stated in the afterword, so it's likely vol 12 isn't the final volume    It went something like  Komachi? You mean the rice?  which is perfectly understandable.  Next I suppose you'll be defending "chalk and let" and "rice krispy treats"?        Chocolate is serious fucking business in Japan.     Orimoto never said it was giri. Also if they knew 8man once liked her there would be hell to pay. Yui may defer to Yukino and vice versa but I doubt the would let in another girl. Why do you think Iroha still keeps up the Hayama facade?      ITT: no Yahallo!   What happened?       I still can't consider you as a boyfriend   But maybe we can be friends?  It's giri choco.       because apparently in one scene she repeated what 8man said.  What did she say?     Most of the Yuifags are skellytons now    I know it is giri choco, 8man knows it too. Yukino and Yui don't know it is giri.    2ch is Yui Central. It's inevitable that they'll think that.  I personally consider her more likely than Yukino, but I can't see her currently winning against Iroha without some main heroine plot armor asspullery. The Iroha spoon scene was just too big of a deal.      We're just waiting until vol 11 storm blows over because yukinofags will not let up gloating on Yui.    Orimoto really wasn't that convincing when she said it. There's no way she'd drop the DAYONE act and be genuine with 8man without getting addicted.    What do you mean addicted?    If it was such a big deal, the anime would have focused on it more. It's not.    To be honest, I consider Iroha has the lowest chance of winning considering she's not even involved in the main drama that revolves around the relationship between the main characters.    It was cut (replaced with non-canon Tamanawa, more accurately) specifically because it's a big deal. The LN hadn't come out yet.     big of a deal.   So big deal almost nobody talks about Iroha on 2ch.      Read carefully   2ch is Yui Central. It's inevitable that they'll think that.       Then we can throw everything sensei said out of the window.     2ch is yuifag central   almost nobody talks about Iroha there  Well no shit.      Deluded    Assmad     Someday finally happened   Threesome   Yay! I guess?       iroha fans are the funniest.   Why didn't 8man pin her down and coat the inside of her womb against her will?   Yeah this confirms it. There may not be a Yui end but there won't be a simple Yukino end.     the thread so fast.  Yahallobros only posting in fresh bread.  Even hayamacunt cant keep the pace.       By your post I can guess that burgerland is waking up.     smearing dick with shit  8man knows better.      Also kinda funny how they nicknamed Yukino Copypaste-non,   because apparently in one scene she repeated what 8man said.   Is this the dependency issue people keep talking about? Like admiring Haruno before and now 8man?       Yes.    Yep, that's it.  8man also told her not to be too reliant on others.  [character development.exe]        It's like she doesn't like to think for herself so she lets other people do the thinking for her.    Is she going to cut her hair too? Little haruno incoming.    50% yes    Haruno &gt; shit &gt; Yukino    What happened to your body, Haru-san-senpai?      I can't into translation but this is roughly what happen:   8man:"let's calm down for now and talk about this tomorrow, give her a call just in case"    Yukino:"K."    Yukino:"Moshi moshi Nee-san? let's calm down for now and talk about this tomorrow, I gave you a call just in case." (Exact same wording)             That's because the story revolves around the club, not the romance. Romance within the club has been treated as a secondary issue early on, and later on a major problem by the story and the characters throughout the series. As of Vol 11 it still seems to be the case and we're looking at maybe one or two volumes left before the series ends.  8man's romantic development with both club members is pretty weak, and Watari investing precious narrative space on developing him with Iroha only undermines that further. Considering Destinyland was barely 2 volumes ago it would be very questionable both from a pacing and a narrative standpoint if someone from the club were to, for instance, win 8man's heart in Volume 12.      What a creep.    If I was 8man right there I would be scared.      It's understandable, but it's retarded. Is there a type of rice called "komachi" known to English speakers? I certainly don't know any. The Japanese dialog is something along the lines of "こまち？だれですか、おこめ？" It's a "joke" made because of the phonetic resemblance between こまand こめ. You can't convey what goes on there to English speakers by translating it literally, even if you can convey the meaning in a half-assed way. Commie's choice was a good one, it was actually better than WW's writing too. Translation isn't only about making things understandable, it's about giving them flavor once they're translated.         I still think there has to be some kind of irony in here, considering 8man cried in front of Yukino to get her to help him not very long ago at all.    You have a point but honestly we'll only know on volume 12. Iroha will either show up briefly and disappear into nothingness, confirming the 'rejection' in the spoon scene or she will get a lot of romantic development and seal the deal, confirming 8man stepping over the line on the spoon scene and flirting with her. The actual v-day did not arrive yet so we'll see what happens 7 months from now.  Personally, I'm expecting the worst. That's just something that I've learned from reading the yahari novels.   Also, good night anons.            won't be a simple Yukino end.  So if there is a Yukino end it would have to take a lot of building up to it? Doesn't the fact that she openly admits to her dependency and wants to change it imply she is already on the road to recovery? 8man already said he ain't putting up with it.  Also does Yukino realize she has feelings for him yet?       In truth 8man doesn't like Yuckyno. It's why he didn't kiss her at infirmary scene.     Commie's choice was a good one, it was actually better than WW's writing too   We don't need to follow the source material, we're better than the source material!   Why not just do it properly and put in a TL note?          What happened? Why does she need to calm down?      こまち？だれですか、おこめ？" It's a "joke" made because of the phonetic resemblance between こまand こめ   Talking out of your ass   http://www.ak.zennoh.or.jp/rice/lin<wbr>eup.html  Fucking 2 seconds in google.  The direct translation delivers the joke precisely.    </wbr>       I hate Commie with a passion but TL notes are just as bad.    He would have but Yukino didn't let him kiss her.    Yukino is on autopilot, that's why someone need to shake her off.    And here I thought dependency was just a buzzword used for waifu war purposes.    Fuck off  You too  8man is the one making distance, but that's just his anti-romance autopilot working, not because he hates Yukino.        So you hate literally every proper LN (and novel) translation ever written?    That isn't not respecting the source material though. If you claim that it is, then any and all translation is.    I DIDN'T READ THE POST  While it is true that the joke isn't actually about phonetics,  Is there a type of rice called "komachi" known to English speakers? I certainly don't know any.   So yes, a direct translation delivers the joke precisely, by mentioning the name of a rice not a single person in the West has heard of. Definitely some high quality comedy right there. You're really good at this anon! You should work for CR.            no dependency issues they said   haruno is just jealous they said      You fuck off, shippershit.   sp, when do we make the Yahari+Nisekoi Cucks Anonymous General thread?    it was actually better than WW's writing too   That isn't not respecting the source material though   0/10         haruno is just jealous they said   This. I'm already having the idea alot of Yukinofags does not know how to read.       Why doesn't he autopilot when it comes to Iroha?    he probs means getting addickted to the 8inch     he doesn't realize the fact that the Coma Cheese joke could be made in Japanese in the exact same way   "whatever I don't agree with/cannot understand must be trolling!!"   ok kid       She loves Hayama-senapi.   Also anyone else think it is funny that Yui's ship didn't sink and only got stronger?      Weren't you ever watch the show?     Speaking of which, is 11 the only volume we have in 2015? We have a pretty solid chance at seeing the ending this year.     The actual v-day did not arrive yet  it did. v-day is the day Komachi took on the entry test, and the 3p date took place.  It's just not ended, that's it/  So Irohafags can still hope.        Iroha work too fast for him to react against.  Remember, despite what he boasted, he's a loner with minimum social experience. Having a girl that aggressive around him fucked his pace.   Second heroine. If Watari fuck her progression too much he has no future in publishing.         I'm going to bet another novel in 6 months. Last year, we got 10.5 in place of 11.     Backpedaling   You already got caught shitting false information everywhere, and you should feel embarassed, just FYI. We've already shown beyond a shadow of a doubt that replacing that line with a pun was a pure and simple mistranslation, since there was no punning present in the dialog.  Anyways, dont' underestimate the intelligence of the viewer. When I watched this scene in HS it was pretty obvious there's a type of rice called komachi which led to the misunderstanding. Not the funniest joke in the world, but at least it was comprehensible dialog.  Commie will continue to translate yen as dollars, mochi as jelly donuts, and taro as rice krispy treats. Also, chalk and let.          The actual v-day did not arrive yet    volumes are supposed to be split off by months   Okay Watari what the fuck are you going to do now?      So are we in full love triangle mode?   Unless I am reading this wrong 8man said no to Yui swallowing her feelings and he told Yukino to not be dependent. Yui makes his heart skip a beat and Yukino acknowledges her problem.     It's no use, hope is just something that will destroy us even more. Davy Jone's cage is closing, but I'm staying on this sunken ship.   See . Volume ended during v-day it seems.       Commie Defense Force is in full swing today     the club burned V-day on a 3p date   Doesn't this pretty much destroy their chances? Lumping themselves together into a group is basically the biggest romantic death flag a heroine can have.        people watch FFF subs      She loves Hayama-senapi.  8man doesn't seem to think so.     Aren't you tired asking the same question over and over? Why don't you just read the thread to find out?    who knows, Watari sure had his own reason to write mock date, indirect kiss, the rejections, Hayato "her feeling is probably for someone else" and other shit.   Before the story actually end, we can always hope for an unexpected end  and that genius writer sill exists        Crap, what the heck? She sure is cute. She’s like the school academy’s idol! It’s Iroha-chan, you know! It wouldn’t be unnatural if that actually happened… No, it definitely would be.     That slyness and cuteness, however, was directed at Hayama Hayato, and not me, so I was able to stay composed. I’mma pretty darn sure I’d fall for her first trap had I been the same as my pure and younger self, ya know…?     By intentionally thinking in a different accent, I faced my identity as a citizen of Chiba, solidifying my love for my hometown and was able to calm down. Phew, close one. If it wasn’t for my love for Chiba, Irohasu’s slyness would’ve completely annihilated me. Thank you, Chiba. I love you, Chiba.   As long as Iroha keeps her 'going for Hayama' facade 8man's defenses are lowered.           backpedaling  How is it backpedaling when I responded to your objection right off the bat in the first place? My assertion was valid in both cases, and I admitted that one of the cases was wrong. The other isn't, and my assertion stands.  We've already shown beyond a shadow of a doubt that replacing that line with a pun was a pure and simple mistranslation, since there was no punning present in the dialog.  You sure did. You didn't show anything, you're just thinking that the pun replacement equates into a mistranslation when it isn't. You obviously don't know anything about translation and have never translated anything.  When I watched this scene in HS it was pretty obvious there's a type of rice called komachi which led to the misunderstanding.  Again that doesn't matter at all because... I already explained why.  This must be summer, there's no other explanation. People weren't this pathetic even when the "get a feeling so complicated" line appeared in Commie's S1 translations.           I'd watch Hadena over Commie. And that's exactly what I did.   Kyoukai Senjou no Horizon S1 was misery       I get no answers to that question   I am currently working on a theory that Iroha doesn't like Hayama and actually likes 8man.       Why would you ever subject yourself to that?     people entitled to THEIR subs on a schedule THEY set   Commie makes fun of these people     it's actually fucking hilarious too   EOPs man          defending Eotens      Maybe, still in the end it's clearly that they thought that "genuine thing" 8man is searching for is romantic feeling. So they are openly aiming for his dick now.   And it's silly to say 8man doesn't have any special feelings for the two beautiful girls he spent a whole year with.      I'm not defending Eotens. What, just because I appreciate Commie's translation for Yahari you thought that I appreciate everything they do?     not finding the internet funny   using 4chan      You would have had to be there to understand what kind of a hell it was. And I'm not just talking about Hadena subs either, Commie was really not much of an improvement.  Not even the nips could figure out what was going on in that show. Someone basically had to make a website with a guidebook spelling out everything that was happening in each episode.      Why does he always draw clothes so they look wet?     watch FFF subs for Hoozuki no Reitetsu   pretty good   watch CR subs for that one episode where Prince Shotoku and Zhuge Liang are put in a Street Fighter IV style VS screen   CR's TL note says that the 2 characters are Japanese strategists or something like that        &gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/    The same reason why he draws 2 left feet    Daily reminder that Zhuge Liang A SHIT.    I thought the fact they were all together on said day and what he says during the date reinforces that there will be romance and that both of them have a shot.   8man isn't the kind of person who should be in the middle of a love triangle between best friends. Why did they equate genuine = my pussy?        their subs are shit EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE  Every Commie discussion ever.     Hey hey, it's all part of his PLAN.     &gt;"not even Heaven can save him from this trap now!   &gt;it starts raining      I can't click gray links anon.    What did he say, exactly? I thought all he does is reject Yui's proposal for them to just remain friends as a rule of sorts.  As for how they interpreted the GENUINE to be romantic is baffling to me as well, as he clearly directed it to both of them. They're just seeing what they want to see, I think.      Did I ever say "except this one"? I said that this translation isn't shit and that not all of their translations are good.    If you guys spent the time learning moon instead of fighting over subs, you wouldn't need subs   because he is just a teenage boy?     S1 goes   I understand it   S2 starts   suddenly they are selling Meat for no fucking reason at all   there's a war now   and then not   I know anon, I know           Commie is fucking retarded. They inserted "rice crispy treats" as something plain a child wouldn't like. Holy fuck.     muh krispie     Holy fuck don't even get me started about the meat.  That anime adaptation made about as much sense as King Crimson.      Taro isn't something plain a child wouldn't like either though, IMO. Just raw taro maybe, but even dried taro is very tasty let alone any sort of sweet thing made with it.     Epic fail.    Why, SURELY eroge protag patterns wouldn't backfire. If you're aiming for the harem end (if applicable) it's hard to make all the right choices the first time around, but it's generally pretty easy to focus one girl.     Asian children actually eat those caramelized crispy rice. They eat it like a candy treat. They even add different coloring to them.    http://exhentai.org/g/826973/a338ef<wbr>5065/  oh baby  </wbr>   So how high are the Iroha points right now?    I still don't get why he act this way with her while always dodging Yui advances. Is it because there is no risk of him accidentally making her fall for him?     Still lower than Komachi     I actually don't think the "words she was waiting for" line was really as questionable as people made it out to be, considering prior to that describes her "searching for the answer with her eyes". It's basically just saying that he gave her an answer like she wanted.  And the answer seemed like a good one, unless there's some crazy ass nipology going on in the dialogue.         Rice and sugar is a fantastic combination. Have you ever had rice pudding? Holy fuck.    So is it a good thing or bad thing for her chances to win the 8?    Well, they should put out if they are going to act this way.    She's already confirmed for winning    Bad. He is not genuine     Truly Komachi is the best girl, the forbidden fruit that 8man can never partake in.     It's grim out there    Don't see how it could be anything but good. She asked if he dislikes her, he said no.     Why did they equate genuine = my pussy?  He had an emotional outburst saying he wants something genuine after talking about people's relationships. The two girls like him so they are going to believe with what fits into what they want from him.   Remember when Yukino brings up genuine again? It seemed to me that they thought genuine had everything to do with romance.         The genuine thing is not a romantic feeling or any kind of relationship.   What 8man wants is for people to be genuine.  In this situation, the two has romantic feelings to 8man but they are trying to hide it. If they are trying to hide it, then they are not really being genuine.          Iroha got under his defenses early on, before he knew it he'd developed a bond with her.  Yui was stuck in the friendzone from the start and probably won't be escaping it any time soon.      I know genuine isn't romantic in nature, that is why I think there will be friends end.  I am just commenting that the girls believe it to be romantic but they are missing the point entirely.     but they are trying to hide it. If they are trying to hide it, then they are not really being genuine.  To be genuine in this case is to have an open love triangle. Are those sour grapes?          but they are missing the point entirely.  Why are they missing the point? They should know him well enough by now.    This series really makes no sense. I get the feeling Watari ran out of drama and decided to arbitrarily make shit up on the spot just to drag the series on.   Thanks Spyro   I don't want to watch Yui suffer anymore. But I will.   it's becoming Nisekoi     What? its already clear.     but they are missing the point entirely.   Not really. The girls are just focused at the consequences.   To be genuine in this case is to have an open love triangle. Are those sour grapes?   If it's open, It won't last very long. Even if it is sour grapes, this way no one has to taste it.               Spairo is based, but if someone's not able to take criticism, and specially on the internet while dealing with groups as 4chan, he should just step down for his own sake.  I appreciate his efforts and wish him the best, hopefully he will finish translating the novels. But being on the internet means dealing with retards, so get used to it.      arbitrarily  Not really. The "why doesn't 8man love me" arc is something that's been hanging over the series for multiple volumes now.     She is already wearing her battle armor. No one is gonna make her suffer anymore, including not to be the #1 in 8man's heart.    Can't say I disagree. Watari's handling of Yukino's character was pretty good in the first half of the series but now it feels like he's just using her an outlet for drama. I still love her but holy shit is it frustrating.     They want to believe      Remember, those who suffer more are duly rewarded.     Did we get all the illustration scans yet? I've only seen like 4 of them so far.    Indeed    Characters have problems and that's fine but when you make contrived problems and never explain what they are, use it as a catch all for any drama you want to throw in, and essentially cut off all character development because of it, then it starts pissing me off.  Watari should at least properly explain what a "dependancy issue" is. But no, instead it's simply a thing that exists and we know nothing about it other than the fact that it conveniently makes everything she does disingenuous for added drama.      Fuck you    Nothing is as broken as Nisekoi. If the author isn't deliberately sabotaging the plot I don't know what he is doing.   What character archetypes combine well with the loli archetype in anime/manga?   As always, me under the bed.    vampire   Milf  slut   How would you even have that?    Lolis giving birth to even smaller lolis.    Loli to loli, ashes to ashes.    Adorable.    infinite universe    Genki lolis are the best.   succubus   We'll call it the loliverse.     What character archetypes combine well with the loli archetype in anime/manga?  The smug character archetype.     Alcoholic.   Loli baa-sans  The wise old master.  mountain climbing archetype  this   That would be insanely cute. And they would grow up to become lolis forever.  This is brilliant.      'Mature' loli who has an affair with a married man archetype.   That's no loli.    It's a space station.    Me with no pan    Me showing my drawings.    This   School girl that is secretly a prostitute archetype.  Possessed yandere robot brown elf childhood friend.   me on the right    Hi.      Draw a loli   Call it a mother   Still qualifies as a milf in my book.        Checked.    The loli    I'm the Paladin on the right, Bard pls    It's just a hug, don't worry.    You mean like some sort of double loli?   Tsundere lesbian loli.   But I don't want your damn cracker; and where are your panties? Have you no shame?     Have you no shame?  She's a bard.    Sorceress &lt;3   I don't see how that would work.    As cute bard loli myself, I make sure to never wear any panties around my cute loli friends.    What  said.   Oppai   Thats lewd, anon    me on the left taking a selfie tbh    Swap swordmage and cleric. A cleric would not be caught with such an exposed cunny.    edge and gore   Cunny !

Only if otou-san's dick is between them. It's not yuri if the cunnies dont touch     Threadly reminder that "cunnyposting" has no positive impact on the thread.       What character archetypes combine well with the loli archetype in anime/manga?   Everything. Loli tsunderes, loli moms, loli nerds, loli kings/queens, loli aliens, undead lolis...      p-papa iku ikuuu    Dicks are gross, I just want a cuddle party.    What's the sense of having a priest and a medic in the same roster? Usually priests are medics.   Gave this a read. The scar marks where off-putting at first.   I liked the other girl more.    Medic is a better healer, Priest has buffs and heals.    Me on the left taking a selfie with the second cutest loli in our group.    rip my dick     at first.   I couldn't get over them I tried but nah.  Shit was disgusting        Has this guy ever actually done any loli yuri, or is it just lolis looking at each other suggestively? I'd even take f/f/m    While Rina is cute, I still prefer Yukino   who is this penis piglet?    swordmage  It's called a spellsword      f/f/m  Hes done FFM before.  no yuri, that i know of.       Not in  4e  it isn't.    This one.    Fake lolis are shit    Fake lolicons are shit.    You mean fake fat breasted, grown woman.    Femdom loli x trap  So I can self insert as cute pretty boy being dominated by a sexually aggressive loli    Why is loli being punished?  translate it, weebs      getting mentally destroyed by loli  Ah, heavenly feels.     What is she trying to indicate with her finger?   How does /a/ feel about monstergirl lolis?   I'd rub them all the same    Not as good as human lolis, but still much better than old hags.    I'd pet and cuddle the fuck out of them.    That she was drawn by a shitty artist who didn't know what to do with the hands he sucks at drawing.    I like when monstergirls have weird vaginas that dont look human. When you slap a human vagina on a snake monstergirl or a frog girl or whatever it just looks boring, they need interesting vaginas in order for them to be sexy.    Something like Harpy lolis having cloaca instead of the usual human parts?    What are your thoughts on dwarf lolis? Beards or no beards?    Refer to Outbreak Company.    yeah, its interesting.   The weirder the vagina, the more of an adventure it would seem to fuck such a thing. Which is why i think is why monstergirls are so popular, its the adventure humoring the idea of what it would be like fucking some alien creature. But thats just my opinion.    i dont like lolis with beards.         Which one, Rin or Ophis?  Either way you're wrong.      But how would you know she's a dwarf if she doesn't have a beard?      Where does it end? You got to think about it.    Fuck no I ain't! F.forgive me my beautiful loli daughter.     When the loli starts getting sickly/looking ugly.   Edgy teens like accelerator     Loli². A double layered loli. This is insane, the loli density is too high, it'd theoretically create a black hololi.        You made the right choice    Mr bones.jpg    Don't ever leave my side, I don't know what I would do without you.  It looks like it is me that needs you now.      ohh~ papa~    Never thought of that  yfw the beard grows before scalp hair on a newborn      I want to spoil you so bad. Give you all sorts of exotic cars and exotic candies and stuff.   I fucking hate lolis...   Yeah well loli loves you.    Leopard was the best loli of the year.    But anon.  All lolis are the best of the year. Always     Artist? I recognize the style, but I can't recall the person.    you should check the recent drawthreads. someone drew a few lewds of that character.     Just this once  http://exhentai.org/g/605116/7477a2<wbr>5a63/</wbr>  Never say I didn't love you, my fellow lolicon.      Much obliged, comrade.    No they don't they are incapable of love as they are only color lights on a screen, and have no sentience what so ever. Even if that character on the screen had some sort of emotion simulating AI it's still just a simulation. They are not inoccent, they are not evil, they are not young nor old, they dont exist... Waifu/husbando fags suck it!   Bump?   Or just marks of graphite, charcoal, pastel, paint ect...     ai  Oh it's only pretending to feel then? Yea nah, she's not a real woman, that's why she loves me.       Not sentiant    love       sentient girl   love for anything that isn't money or luxury  Lolis may not be real  yet  but they sure as hell can love.       Waifu/husbando fags suck it!  /cgl/ pls go and stay go     You're forgetting about  3D  lolis   In a world without norms or STDs, would fucking a Loli be possible?    fuck off.     No, fuck you.     Are we getting raided?     No I'm being serious here.    /a/ isnt the place to ask those kinds of questions.    Then you're a shitty crossboarder and should die.    Shirley you can't be serious.    fuck off    No lewd allowed    That still goes under aforementioned forms of visual arts.    No, I made a joke at the wrong time.     <br/>  A full translation doesn't exist huh?  Shh, loli is sleeping  Why is this allowed? https://chan.sankakucomplex.com/pos<wbr>t/show/3674099 Trigger warning for Katefans. </wbr>    sankakucomplex  Are you fucking serious        What's wrong with sankaku?

Awesome.      sheeple     Bitch pls    i suddenly have an intense craving for applejuice   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127105471  http://exhentai.org/g/826203/68cef6<wbr>24d5/</wbr>   g'night /l/  Red Wizard of Thay.    providing sauce for dead people      giving sauce to normies     Curious, do you guys know these off by heart or do you have some magic reverse search that works for partial images? Thanks, by the way.  I-I'm not dead!  Forgive me for not having the entirety of sad panda downloaded and playing on my wall of computers.          ban evading     Oh my that's spooky.   Thinking of the future generations of anons looking at cropped images in the archive. This abides by my principles.   Google works differently for everybody. When in doubt, check sadpanda's frontpage.           Genki tomboy.    ban evading   doesn't know how to search for sauce   is probably a literal cocksucking spermlord          I expected him to ask about the panda, at least he didn't.    Your mistakes are your own to make, tripfag.    They didn't even give me a warning. I'm sorry, I never realised I was supposed to start a thread on /r/, post the same images, and hope the people here, who clearly know what it is, just happen to see the other thread, which is, again, on a different board. I'm working on a partial image recognition suite, I hope it to be done soon. For now, I suffer the shame.        &gt;doesn't know how to search for sauce  No, and I'd love to know how I could. Reverse search turned up nothing, unless there's a better service I don't know of, and they didn't hint at, wait, shit. Look up duplicate posts on the archive, right? Fuck me I'm dumb.         Thinking of the future generations of anons looking at cropped images in the archive. This abides by my principles.  Giving sauce to any random normstain who is just stopping by for a guiltfap isnt propper form. You realize these types of newfolks are likely hypocrites who haet lolicons/these thread, right?    Shh...   loli is sleeping      Dont worry about it.  Everyone's asked for sauce at some point.     I can handle the blame, it's part of being a tripfaggot.   Best advice is to lurk more. You can't look up something on the archive when it is the first time being posted.   And when do you suggest it is proper form? This event will repeat it's cycle until who knows when. The archive exists for a reason.  It depends on him on how he would react to the source, but it's not fair to assume all newfolks are generally the same hypocrites and shitposters we know in these threads. It's not about defending the anon, but we're all newfags once.            You should put her to bed. Lolis need to sleep comfortably.     That's a creature.    Wet    They are very sensitive to sound. Make sure to stay very very quiet.        Here's an interesting idea, we should make a natural park for creatures. That way they can roam free without any fear in a natural environment.  And tourist could come and watch those beautiful creatures from afar/      They have those. They are called "play grounds"    You guys sure are assuming a lot about me.    Murderous psychopath lolis are the best.    Hm. A creature park sounds like a great idea.  ...until they escape their environment and go on a deadly rampage.      Then obviously we build walls to make sure they don't escape.  We wouldn't want them to damage the ecosystem.      Just throw a couple of onii-chans in there, they won't even think about leaving    Wouldn't that risk creating overpopulation issues down the line?   The NEET genius   Nice tumblr gif.      No. Why would that even happen      go to sleep, loli    im the druid with the cat pillow    you're a fluid-druid    Why is this 9 year old so sexy?    Why are oppai lolis so much better than regular lolis?    All 9 year olds are sexy.     no yuri, that i know of.  What a waste.    Best loli h-manga.   I wouldn't know I haven't read it because I can't find it.    Not really.    http://exhentai.org/g/719766/f155fe<wbr>d306/</wbr>    The vaginas are pretty nice.    So puffy    Yuri is boring though, extended foreplay with no main event.     Rubbing puffy vaginas together   Boring      There's no risks, consequenses and very little going on on a social and interpersonal level when both partners are innocent, unaware, incapable of reproduction and engaging in legal activities.    woah, really?    The perfect kind of loli hentia.    Mein bruder.   Which is superior, /a/?  Traps or tomboys?    Reverse traps  Tomboys &gt; traps  Bonus points for spats      So Tomboys then?     See the 2014 /a/ census. Tomboys beat all and traps are actually not that popular.     Tomboys because males are gross.      Tomboys   Girls with the worst part of being a girl removed by having the best parts of a fun male present    Traps   Penises with massive insecurities and hardly the best of either gender   Gee OP I dunno           No     Tomboy dominating traps is the only correct answer      ¿Por que no los dos?    Okay but what about both?  Tomboys  Traps are just girls for fags      Girls who look like girls &gt; girls who look like boys &gt; boys who look like girls         There can be only one.      Tomboys wearing strapons and dominating traps!     Tomboys are best   I think /a/'s definition of tomboy has become too wide.     Clearly you are not familiar with the character    Is this technically both?   I know the character, she might have the attitude, but not the looks.    I need a fucking doujin of that    I'd be fine with a teasing and cuddling doujin but fucking's fine too    She's a lesbian, not a tomboy.   Traps are only good for each other.    Draw a girl   Call it a boy   It is also straight       That's good too. I just want a lwed doujin of a tomboy and a trap.     http://fapservice.com/shishunki-na-<wbr>adam-light-novel-fanservice-compila<wbr>tion-vol-1-6/</wbr></wbr>   Absolutely wrong.     The hell are you talking about  Tomboy is all about the attitude        That's not even a trap  That's a semen demon      Tomboys are the personality of a guy in the body of a cute girl. Traps are the personality of a girl in the body of a cute guy.  It's clear which is superior.       bee   lesbian  what?  Also monkey is a lesbian and a tomboy.         what.          I would a trap but I would marry a tomboy.    I-I never watched past Bake and thought that was monkey, my bad Although I would still not consider monkey a tomboy because she still acts too feminine as a supporting character, leaning in on Araragi's arm while they walk and everything      She's not too feminine. She's just the right amount of feminine.    This is my all time favorite trap x tomboy / reverse trap couple.    You are wrong. Are you implying that all female characters that are athletic, like doing sports and are mostly interested in boy stuff are tomboys?  There are a lot of characters like that, doesn't mean they all are.       Best tomboy   Yes.  Also you're wrong.        Tomboys   They're not equivalent.  One is for closeted gays. The other is for faggots who are already out of the closet.    But which is which?      New chapter never     That is up to you to decide. Just trust your instincts.    This is the correct answer.      Persona 4 was great. It gave you a reverse trap and a tomboy.   do not forget best hermaphrodite   Did she have freckles in the anime? I didn't even notice.    Some traps act just like a tomboy because they look enough like a girl to be a tomboy    Tomboys are girls for fags.      I CANT DECIDE     <br/>     Genderbent characters aren't traps.    The one with more holes.    Well that helps, but the attitude is the most important part.     Tomboys are just fine, but traps will be always superior, even if the vocal minority says otherwise. Shota &gt;= traps &gt; damaged goods &gt; grills.     reverse trap tomboys     Shota &gt;= traps &gt; damaged goods &gt; grills.  This man knows what's up.      Beat Persona 4 Golden a few weeks ago   First time playing a Persona game, and first time playing a MegaTen game   Love Chie and her upbeat tomboyish attitude a cute appearance   Love Naoto and her calm, laid back demeanor and dat voice made of pure sex   Realize that it doesn't matter because fucking piece of shit Marie is the canon romance         futas   What if a tomboy fell in love with a trap?  Better yet, did we even have any series about this type of romance?     tomboys you sick dick craving fuck     Struggling to sauce these. Is the last one Adam in Puberty by any chance?      Literally what the link says fuckwit.     OP series is literally about a tomboy being pursued by two traps     Straight traps are awesome     Best tomboys wear spats  It is known    Since traps are literally homo, i'll go with the tomboy.    &gt;/lgbt/     K I want to see how this goes   Tomboys who want to be cute and girly are best    I still think this counts     Futas who act like traps or futas who act like tomboys?     Futas who act like traps     Looking back, Yukimura winning actually makes sense.    It's the best because they already are cute but don't realize it.    How delusional, you don't seem to realize that the vocal minority is those who like traps     Splash some water when your dick is in her and say that again      Posting Aichi with your shit taste  Fuck you.     Forgot pic      fujoshis last   And all is right with the world         trapfags   monsterfags   gyaru tier   Beautiful.  I'm not a big fan of tomboys but lolis are close enough to the top for this chart to satisfy me completely.           Has there been a good Fujoshi character?    Monkey.  Where is your god now?     Male Ranma doesn't look like a girl. (And better not to tempt anyone to start the discussion of where a dick inside Ranma's vagina would end up in that situation.)      Bio Suzuki, if anyone ever cared about her.    So /a/ would love a deredere loli tomboy oneesan? Does such a thing exist?    NEVER EVER    You gotta believe.      Traps are god tier.    No they're not.      Shotas* are god tier.      Reverse traps are.   Traps are love, traps are life.   MC actually cums in that.  That's a first.         I'm reading it precisely because of that. I knew something was up with that first kiss and losing the wizardry to the brown milf. The manga did not disappoint.  Now if only that disgusting tsundere was erased from existence it'd be 10/10.        I want to  use a double sided dildo to do ass to ass with Totsuka       BOTH!        I envy the mc like no other.  Aside from MC from prunus girl     Where did all these traps suddenly come from?  I can honestly say there are only 2 traps I've seen that I could gay to. Hideyoshi, and Saika. Bridget just never did it for me. In contrast, the tomboy list is much longer.  Do you love twintails?   I couldn't call myself an /a/non if I didn't.      Yeah, especially when they're on delicious shotas  fuck this shitty genderbend show    The hair? Yeah it's bretty gud. The show? No.      Yes very much.   Too bad this show only had like four jokes.   Tail Red or Solar?      Solar     Twirl     muh nigga    Fag.    Of course. Twintails is part of the Trinity of highest perfection, the other two being DFC and ZR.   Flat is best.   Tailred.      Aika    maybe    I bet your room smells like fish from all those whores lying around.   No, because I am not a faggot.  I will admit, I did not understand how glorious twintails were before watching this series. I have since seen the light and accepted that they are the best.   Is it gay if you do it with a genderbent guy?    eh...    I would Solar's solars.    No, anon. The moment they become pregnant they become bonafide women.   We'll be getting a season 2, r-right?  Is this an Aika thread?   Yes     We can hold hope.  Maybe the sales for the book increased a lot.  And maybe once people see that the BDs fixed most of the QUALITY, they will buy it.         Maybe there will also be world peace.     The rest of the BDs when? I don't wanna see the extra QUALITY.       The raws are out and someone did subtitles for them.     um they're all out they've been all out for almost a month now  no new twintails content till next LN  ;_;          Thanks.     solar cuz im not a pedo   Normally yes, but this show was abysmal.  No, I fucking hate twintails. Worst hairstyle.   b-but, m-muh QUALITY  BDs fixed it. Face it, you have no reason not to watch twintails!    But that's the best part! I'll never watch the BDs.   I love twintails and I love pudding.   Personally my moralfaggotry gets in the way when it comes to BDs and makes me have to buy them, and that usually means I wait until there's a set deal out so I don't have to shell out $500 just for 1 series.    Tail Ted.   Shaved head &gt; Twintails    all the girls around are correct  nope     Where are the non meme-fied BD subs? I've been waiting for these to watch the show. Why are the only choices funi and &gt;commie? Where is [P]?    Coalgirls    Thanks     Nevermind, they only have episodes 1-6. Guess I'm going to be waiting longer.      Where is [P]?  Thankfully, coalgirls use [P]. Unfortunately, they're slow to release. Apparently itsP is the only typesetting guy in Kristen's other group; Chihiro, so they're probably working on it together.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127054464  What OVA?   Perfection    Yuno pls     Never to be animated because of the hack job that was S1.     I'm not sure which VA could do Phoenix Guildy and Yuno justice  Hard Mode: One VA to voice both      Both. At the same time. If you believe in twintails, anything is possible.     http://ultimaguil.org/   RIP /m/ Thread      Pretty sure S1 sold acceptably well, just tat the scheduling was ass. The BD release looks pretty good.    I can't decide, but I may lean slightly more towards Solar.    I wonder why it was deleted, janitor over there having a bad day I wonder...  Didn't make a new one though because site, lack of new content being released and general slowing of discussion. As nice as threads are, they're a lot nicer when they're not so slow, those types of threads are better suited for other imageboards or similar, where they aren't at risk for being killed just for not having a post in a day or few.      Acutally around the time it got deleted the thread was moving at a pretty decent pace, as if a bunch of guys tried it out and enjoyed it. All I remember is going to bed one night and finding it 404ed in the morning     Just here to announce that vol 4 spoilers are now complete on the site and that I'll probably upload the next part of the vol 5's first chapter this weekend. Also, how do the new themes look to you guys?   I think it might be because it looked a lot like one anon turned it into his personal livewatch thread. That seems to fly on /v/ but I don't think /a/ is okay with that much less a slow board like /m/.      Both.    my kin    Solar.      Solar.    Solar. Defencelessness is delicious.    Solar is the superior taste     Hidden big tits   Weakness:nape  Top quality.      Solar    The twintails school uniform is so nice    It sure is. Fits Aika espeically well I think.    solar    Well duh, Solar    Solar    No contest.    Tail Red because she's cute and small little girl   Aika is perfect. I instantly like her since the first 1st ep  How about we liven things up with Vol 4 spoilers?   The first chapter starts with the flea guildy fight.   She's been going full demon mode as Blue since their fight with isuna two weeks ago scaring everyone shitless now.   "Ohhh! What beautiful legs! The form a perfectly staight line with your chest!! I pride myself on these legs and here we have a magnificent pair on one such as you!!"   "Here, it's the leg that you love oh so much... Makes you happy doesn't it? Tell me just how grateful you are." Damn you Misuzawa. I did not need this in my life.   Erina tries to get Souji to step on her breasts since Aika's been taking all the guildies for herself   Aika finishes him off using the bloomer elemera to imprint him right in to the ground and following it up with a point blank brake release sans aura pillar.   She has the remaining ultiroids record a message to take back to the base and lets them leave alive. The ultiroids debate amongst themselves on how Aika would just attack once they turn around, running off one by one   The guildies now fear Aika so much that they force themselves to do proper research on her. Her data apparently would increase the load on their computers by 20x.   They had scrapped some tail blue figure plans   Isuna brags about taking Red's first kiss and blows the guildies some air kisses to ease their jealousy. They're not thrilled about it. "What's this!? I've unconsciouly activated my barrier!? I-I'm not defending myself at all!!"   Souji actually scolds Aika for taking things far and the public actually sees them as lovable perverts now.   The twintail news reports don't consider Aika to be human and have designated her as the fastest land mammal alive.   They talk about countermeasures to take if you encounter tail blue. Yellow has fewer in comparison but is treated as a flasher.                  Aika's battle hogging have worsened Erina's stripping tendencies to the point that it's popping up in her normal self. Its gotten so bad that Souji tells her it's okay for her to strip.   Souji still hasn't told the rest that Isuna is the idol they like so much    Aika catches Souji as Tail Red during her morning call   "This again!? Don't tell me you had another weird idea and went to bed like that!"   "No, not today. The transformation just happened on its own... Also, I did come up with that one a long while ago but I gave up on that since it was hard to sleep in the tailgear."   Mouth agape, Aika falls to her knees and her shoulders begin to shake.    "What do I do... Just what do I have to do...?"   I guess she must be tired from rampaging around too much lately.    While Erina's cozying up to Souji on the way to school, Twirl tells Aika to beat her up to ruin their love comedy moment. Aika thought it was a great idea.   Aika and Twirl mix it up with their routine and keep on finding new creative ways to do it   Guildies have made the tail blue figure but everything about it besides her twintails is of bad quality. They've officially started anti blue stragetiizing process.   Since Red is min maxing twintails and Yellow's got a whole arsenal, Aika's really the only getting stronger from defeating them and they can't help but take it as her feeding on them.    Twirl's never used the excelion shorts built in toilet herself and tries to get Souji to finally field test the feature. Souji's already transformed and very tempted.   Twirl's digging the situation so much that she tanks Aika's beatdown without even flinching. It causes the base to shake enough to bother Souji.   Erina wants to "share the pain" with him so she opens up the base's store of sodas and drinks and starts downng them down in single gulps.   Twirl offers the incontinence poison she was trying to slip into aika's food all day to Erina and immediately downs it.                      Souji's so aggravated by this he momentarily concludes that girls go in groups to the toilet because they're "sharing the pain" too.    "If... you could... make something like... that... couldn't you have... made the opposite... twoe..."   "Hip hip hooray! Double hold-ins! Double hold-ins!!"   Twoearle... I owe a lot to you but right now, just this once, won't you let me hit you with a grand blazer.    Aika takes Souji to the toilet and has to undo his pants and underwear for him since he's at his limit. He closes his eyes the whole time and Aika is completely red in the face.   They come back to see twirl convulsing in pain on the floor with all the damage from earlier beatings finally taking their toll and Erina blue in the face at her own limit. Aika has to take her to the toilet too.    Miharu's got a peculiar style of walking that makes it look like she's hovering in addition to her skating style walking. I've had experience with those myself but I could never get the hovering one right.   Aika tells him he cant just splash water over himself and needs to handwash his body now since girl bodies are sensitive. He thinks she's joking since she uses her own hands to break up concrete-hard stuff everyday in her normal form.   Twirl tries to accompany him and Aika tries to stop her.   Twirl insists on the basis that she has large breasts herself while Aika tells her she wouldn't be wash Souji's twintails properly. Cue awkward pause.   Smiling and patting Aika's shoulder, Twirl gives in and says she'll let Aika have this one while she'll just enjoy things from the other side of the magic mirror.   Aika tells Souji to go in ahead and strip. Thinking he's out earshot, she tells Twirl to do the same and apologizes for going there i.e. her lost twintails.   "Apologizing and gently stripping my clothes off at the same time!? Go back to that raunchy anime world you came from!"   She wears string tied panties in case someone ever requests to untie a pair.                    Just like Souji's twintail senses, Aika's apparently developed the ability to tell when someone's thinking about her chest. She tells Souji he can fix his bra problem after he considers how easily her towel would fall off.   Aika hangs twirl upside down by her panties.   Aika understands Twirl's drowning sounds to know where she keeps her shampoo in her labcoat.    Souji inadvertantly said a line his dad said during his youth whilst bantering with his mom. He's mortified when his mom tells him so.    Swan Guildy is training himself by replying to Isuna's texts. He's skiping out on meetings to do so but Sparrow Guildy, Isuna and Hopper Guildy are letting it slide so he can get stronger.   "Title: Dappii~ Body: Hiya Swan Guildy-chan! It's me, Dark Grasper! You can just call me Da-chan(music symbol) Lemme tell you something neat (star symbol) In Da-chan talk Dappii~ means hello~"   Just reading it blows his body into the wall. Sparrow Guildy cheers him on.   Isuna has a giant shark costume made for Meganep so she can be on stage with her and appeal to kids as Meganedon. She's also gone back to normal twintails as opposed to tribraided ones.    Twirl sews up a bra for Solar and Mikoto sets up transfers procedures for a Solar Metca while Souji is marked down for treatment overseas.   Erina has Solar introduce herself to the entire school at an assembly and Souji's medical treatment for Twintailenza gets announced the same way. His classmates are glad to hear he's getting the help he needs. They're still riffing him about this in vol 8.   Solar is of course a huge hit with the school and still gets mobbed by girls.    Arachne guildy runs a dojo for trap affinity elemarians out of his own room and has quite a few students. One of their practices involve putting on tht face powder make up thing(foundation?).   Isuna drops in to tell him about Worm Guildy's and Snail Guildy's deaths.   He takes it really hard as it turns out that he had fallen for his student and cries tears of blood.                     Isuna is shocked and disgusted at the sudden revelation but quickly comes around to it after picturing a scene of flower petals falling around Arachne Guildy and Worm Guildy as the former embraces the latter with all eight of his spider legs.   Scene ends with Arachne Guildy remembering good times with worm guildy whilst holding up his sword, the Girly Boy Rod. I did not get this joke until now.    "Oh my! It's so majestic! Mind if I touch it?" "Fufu. I would not mind at all."    Meanwhile at school Solar is being paraded around on a palanquin the boys clad in Fundoshi are carrying around while the girls do strange dances ahead of them. The whole school's really going all out to celebrate her with all the clubs joining in one by one adding their special touch to the parade.   Twirl feels like she's lost to Solars natural girliness at seeing her press down her skirt on the palanquin.   The boys take the chance to get Erina to approve a Solar fan club. Mikoto scares them with a faustian deal involving them signing her marriage forms in exchange for her as their club supervisor.    Erina's home is the size of a shopping mall fully equipped with facilities like tennis courts and helicopter pads.   Her own room is huge and both she and Emu are discussing her future with Souji inside. She's taken to calling him son-in-law by this point   Emu is asking about how far shes gotten with him and the context of illicit sexual relations completely fly over her head   It takes Emu offering to show Erina how satisfy Souji by leading by example with while she takes notes during.   She calls Erina pathetic when she tells her they haven't done it even once and that it is her duty to invite her man "to the floor".   That said Emu sees that Erina may be objecting to being so forward with Souji but isn't denying that she wants to snag him for herself   Emu strategizes some plans up for Erina. It leads to having her invite them to their beachhouse and Erina learning the secret dance of her people.                  Solar, Day 2. Souji wakes up and gets dressed without looking at his new body by touch. He's completely mastered the feat.   He's more fixated on tying up his twintails the way Aika does. Two minutes is too long and he's set up a training regiment to practice tying them 30x a day.   Aika's trained so hard with her twintails she doesn't need a mirror and does them up perfectly when she wakes up.   Twirl comes in see through negligee, locks the door and gives Souji her once loved Barrettas since she can't bring herself to throw them away even after not being able to wear twintails anymore. Described as not quite plastic or glass and they were designed to quickly do up twintails upon wear.   He wonders why Aika hasn't come in after her like usual and she tells him Anti Aika System No. 4 should have put her to sleep some minutes ago.   Twirl and Souji sit shoulder to shoulder on the bed, the former doing up the latter's twintails.    It's a touching moment for SOuji but then Twirl takes advantage and gets him to strip down quickly acting like she's figured out the cause of the predicament.   Aika stops her just in time. The sleep gas did work on her but she countered it by jabbing her little toe.   Souji still doesn't catch on what Twirl was trying to do.   "But look! My clothes are all off but I still have my twintails tied up!"   "...and? What did you do that for exactly?"   ...She's right... What was the point in doing that...   Aika proceeds to take care of Twirl on Souji's bed.   "Noooooooo! I don't want Aika-san to be the one forcing me down onto the bed completely naked! Noooooooo!"   Miharu quietly exits Souji's closet and excuses herself. She's a little miffed at just how close Twirl was to pulling it.                  Later at school Erina and Mikoto have to publicly ban palanquins and Aika has to pave the way for Souji to move around the school.   Their only sanctuary is the Twintails Clubroom and once they're there Erina starts fidgeting around anxiously taking peeks at Souji.   "...Do you want to strip, Erina?"   "Why is the first thing you think I want to do stripping, Mitsuka-kun!?"   She tries to invite them to the beach but Twirl but her to the punch by an instant.   Aika is unwilling to go. So is Souji since he thinks he'd draw the line at swimsuits.   Erina and Mikoto tell them it's a private beach and their course is set.   Meanwhile at Ultimaguil base, Isuna is using a corridor to practice for her next show.   She's in a school swimsuit and doing fashion catwalks with pride.   Everytime a guildy walks in they go "Oh yeah! I've got something to do in another corridor.", do a 180 and walk away.   Meganep is fretting about what all those eroges she's played has done to her common sense.    Isuna declares they're off to an uninhabited island for her next idol gig.    They find themselves on the Erina's private beach only to realize that private island cottage happens to fall under the term as well. Erina apologizes for her excessive wealth.   They expected Miharu to come but she put on a pained smile and says nobody would want to see an old hag in a swimsuit. Souji wonders how it's any different from her cosplay outfit.   Twirl takes a knock at Aika about accidentally mistaking her for a rock to cover herself with in the sauna. Aika takes it as come-on and shies away from her instead of beating Twirl up like usual. Twirl balks at her reaction.   While shenanigans go on, Souji slinks off into the changing room to get into one of the more reasonable swimsuits Twirl gave him.   Down at the beach the girls get Souji to compliment them on theirs.                      The boys take the chance to get Erina to approve a Solar fan club  Nice.      Girly Boy Rod. I did not get this joke until now.    I'm afraid I have bad news for you. You seem to be even denser than Souji.  Also, consider the implications of "Arachne Guildy was beating up the twintails with his girly boy rod"        He does a double take at Aika. Souji takes pity on her by ignoring all the pads under her bikini top. He does find her legs remarkable bringing up Flea Guildy's praise.   He finds Erina's swimsuit cute, Mikoto's adult and Twirl's beautiful. She's disappointed in that he only said just that even though he was actually stunned by how well it suited her. She's still wearing her labcoat over it too.   Soon the pads in Aika's bra start plopping out from the seams and she drags Twirl away by a rope tied around her waist ala that dragging tire strength training after her shamefur display.   Mikoto is outraged that Souji's the one that looks best in his swimsuit. Erina's even a little jealous.   He undoes his twintails as an apology for trampling over their efforts to look good. They are confused till he explains he didn't want to offend them.   Mikoto calls him out on having twintails in place of a heart. He actually finds what she said to be a good line and plans on getting her to sign away rights to let him use it in a future speech. Mikoto picks up on that through intuition and tries to get him to sign the marriage form along with it.   Mikoto and Erina play with the undone hair and ties it up in their respective low and high twintails.   Souji pledges to master their styles as well and Aika comes running back to make sure he remembers that they have to bring him back to being a boy again.   Mikoto and Erina get into a fight over who gets to put sunburn lotion on him.   Twirl takes the chance to make loli-related innuendos and piss off Aika at how she's an amazoness who'll end up like Mikoto.    Aika pushes Twirl right down neckdeep into the sand with one hand and preps up for some watermelon smashing.               Mikoto calls him out on having twintails in place of a heart  This is deep     Mea Culpa. I'm afraid I'd piss you all of if I were to blog about my life experiences.   Some roughhousing in the sea later by Aika against twirl washes away Souji's bikini   Twirl's reaction is to butterfly stroke over and get mad at him for getting that event when she's been trying to get right timing for the waves to do it to her the whole time.   Aika dives in and comes back up with the top. She goes into dere mode after Souji compares her to a mermaid.   Erina gets Souji to watch her do "pre-swim stretches". It's actually the secret Shindou seduction dance and it drives Souji's twintail lust over the edge and makes him pin down Erina to the ground.   Shocked at first, Erina tells Mikoto not to interfere and timidly says to Souji can do what he wants with her.   He fondles her soft fluffy twintails.   Twirl shows up at the ruckus and Souji gets the urge to tie her hair into twintails but manages to drive back that impulse. Might be because I already read the payoff for this bit but wanting to tie Twirl's hair comes off as a pretty serious moment narratively.   Mikoto sends Souji to the other end of the island to cool off but his twintail senses pick up a familiar refreshing pair of twintails.   He turns into tailred and sneaks up on a Isuna and Meganep talking about the ridiculous show Isuna wants to put on as an idol.   They're going over the stage gag where Meganedon would tsukkomi her wearing goggles and glasses at the same time. Souji is not impressed by Isuna's attempt at playing the fool.   Isuna's accidentally written down Dark Grasper on her school swimsuit namecard and Meganep tears it off to rectify the mistake and it surprises Souji enough to give away his position.   Isuna greets him smugly teasing him about the kiss and correctly guesses that he hasn't told Aika and the rest about her civilian identity as an idol so that Aika wouldn't cause any casualties attacking her on live tv.                  Source?    The rest of the team shows up. Twirls goes nuts over the hole in Isuna's swimsuit and Meganep slaps on big white sticker meant for her cardboard boxes over the cleavage.   Upon noticing how Souji's staring at her, Isuna teases him more about wanting to handle her breasts and Aika claims that it'd be impossible for that to be true given how small they are. Everyone takes a moment to let that jab sink in and nobody takes a pass on tsukkomi'ing her. Souji mentally notes for Isuna to up her gags from learning by Aika's example.   A guildy then washes up to the shore in front of them all of a sudden.   Souji is about to ask who he is but Isuna beats him to the punch. She was not expecting him at all.   Turns out he's an old-timer looking to back-up his boss Levia-Guildy so he travelled by drifting in the sea.   Aika is ready to maul him when he reveals his unit but doesn't when Coelacanth Guildy reveals his actual affinity is Six-packs.   Isuna and Meganep leave the twintails to him and the ultiroids and take off.   Twirl's system couldn't pick up on him since his elemera-using activities were low. She'd be picking up on all human readings too to detect a non-active elemarian like him.   He admits he was actually sensing out a girl who might have a chiseled sixpack but laments on how she ended up training her chest but not her abdomen. He's looking straight at Aika.   She sends him flying. Erina tells her they shouldn't be hitting old people but Aika quotes her grandpa in that "Taking it easy on the elderly is to dishonour them".    Souji recalls that her grandpa kept making up excuses to get out of fighting her at the end. Aika never picked up on that.   He comes dashing right back at her super fast and comments on how she just might have potential after all.   Aika tells him she's done her best to avoid toning her muscles to keep her skin smooth.                 ZR   not superior pantyhose      While Aika and Coelacanth Guildy trade a flurry of chops at each other, Erina is blasting off the Ultiroids. Souji notices she's purging armor without firing her weapons and she tells him she just came to the epiphany that she doesn't need to keep fire her weapons to strip.   Souji panics at her uncovering that and tells her to stop when she she announces she feels like she can take everything off now.   Aika and coelacanth guildy debate the change in the times about what's acceptable for women with regards to sixpacks as the latter gets a powerful blow in.   Souji goes to save her but his strikes are severely weakened and Coelacanth Guildy deflects his blows too easily.   They go for the fusionic buster and blast him away. Souji can't handle the recoil so Aika singlehanded redirects the weapons on their mark.   Coelacanth Guildy uses his parting words to tell Aika to get her sixpacks ripped and she shouts out she'll never let that happen.    Later on Twirl and Aika discuss Souji's outburst earlier and Aika asks about how Twirl's been acting when it comes to twintails.   Aika's noticed that Twirl's helmet is designed to give the impression of twintails without actually tying her hair in twintails and that she keeps her distance from the hairstyle.   Twirl does so that Souji would never think that she wants her twintails back and would keep on fighting with the tailgear without hesitation.   She's fine with not being able to have them again but does bring up the main drawback is that she and Souji will never be able to laugh about how much they both like twintails together.   Aika shyly tells her not to bottle things up and that she's always there if Twirl needs to release her pent up frustrations.   Twirls turns it into yuri innuendo and Aika starts beating her again leading to a wardrobe malfunction. Twirl bemoans always giving her fanservice moments to Aika.                Meganedon is taking off with the kids. Isuna wants to package Meganedon figures with her next album.   When asked about how she should get to Ultimaguil work instead of idoling around so much she says she entrusted it to Arachne Guildy because the trap elemera is budding around the world. She then admits that idoling is fun and her suboordinates are a pain.   Arachne Guildy is bidding his students farewell with the pretext of training alone in the mountains. His students see through it and calls him out on heading out to avenge Worm Guildy.   An absurdly described melodramatic scene involving make-up and tear ensues where they let slip that Snail Guildy accompanied Worm Guildy because he fell for him as well.   Then they own up to them all feeling the same way but bottling up their love in honor of their teacher.   Isuna is overwhelmed by the ridiculousness of the scene and exhausts herself trying to keep quiet outside their room. She's also envious of their Boke levels that she decides to just focus on idoling.    Souji wakes up to an Aika checking up on him early in hopes of him returning back to normal only to discover that Souji's managed to speed up his twintail tying skill to under 30 seconds(thanks to Twirl's barretas). She goes dead-eyed at how he's nonchalant he is about things.   They leave the house only to find Miharu's regulars outside shambling around like zombies waiting for the store to open.   They call Aika by name now and think she's a trap. She gets them to scram when that comes to light.   School's still going crazy for Solar. Even the girls are trying to get close to Souji, one even tries to change into gym clothes.   Aika gets called up for action on the Twirlphone. Onlookers hear the decryption hide it up with her talking like a super slut.               She and Erina go on ahead. Souji hesitates for a bit since he's weakened but decides to go. He tells the crowd he needs to go to the toilet to ditch them and they go crazy at the chance to go with her.   They find Arachne Guildy meditating in a bamboo forest. His natural elemera levels are so high that Twirl's detection system picks him up even though he's doing nothing.   Erina questions him about the cosmetics he's got on and he tells them it's his warrior way to trap it up.   He gives them a poem reading as a farewell gift and they realize that he didn't come to win but to die.   He wants a duel but Aika just tells him they're going to rush him all at once. He answers back by making 50 clones of his pre-trap self, Spider Guildy.   Souji freaks out at all the spider legs. Aika's fine with it since they're not tentacles and Erina's gone into tokuhype mode since he's an insect type monster. He feels stupid for letting it get to him.   The fight and Souji's gear is so badly weakened it starts breaking up on getting hit.   Arachne Guildy corners him and this sends him into his inner world to chat with the Twintails.    Tailred doesn't just spread twintail elemera but also encourages the growth of other elemera as well like say a bunch of boys at Souji's school awakening to trapping it up out of admiration for Tailred.   When he fought the first trap elemarian, his concern wasn't if he'd get busted but if just transforming into Tailred was good enough.   Souji realizes that Solar is the result of him feeling that not being a genuine twintail was going to be his eventual downfall so the tailgear reflected that wish to fix that problem.   Him becoming Solar is akin to being a trap by way of their desire to become their ideal.   He understands his inner twintail is himself and ends the dream with pride.                 He fends off Arachne Guildy's attack just in time and tells them he was just having a chat with the twintails inside of him. Aika reacts by asking herself if smashing him in the head was the only way to fix him at this point.   Arachne Guildy may have come to die but he's not going down easy. Aika and Erina exhaust themselves taking down the clones.   The barettas come out and Twirl tells him to go for it even at the cost of the items.   Riser Chain debuts   Back at base Twirl tells Aika she's entrusted Souji with the most important thing to her right from the start.   Arachne Guildy tries to steal away Aika and Erina's elemera with the ring but Souji brings out faller chain to save them.   Twirl alerts him of the time limits to the power up. Apparently routing all the power through either the top or bottom half of his gear destablizes the gear's energy systems to hazardous levels and he needs to switch back to normal chain before hitting the time limit to reroute the energy evenly.   Arachne Guildy is awed by his twintail love but warns him that if he takes it too far he may just become literal twintails.   "And I wouldn't have it any other way!!". Aika screams not to want that thinking he means it instead of just bantering Arachne Guildy.   Arachne Guildy goes into his Spider Centaur form announces it as his battle form that he never wanted his beloved Worm GUildy to see.   The twintails are way more shocked at the trap on trap elemarian love though.    Aika and Erina seem to feel a little guilty at the realization that they're people too but Souji declares that he's not going to take pity and is going to meet him with everything he's got. Arachne Guildy is grateful to him for doing so.               "My Twintails are bonds!"   Souji ends the fight changing into Faller Chain to make a big aura pillar, flies under arachne guildy and slices off his spider legs before thrusting the swords straight up through his torso.   Arachne Guildy's sword crumbles away and compliments his performance.   "I'm coming to you now Worm Guildy... Please forgive your unworthy teacher for this..."   They warp back to the clubroom and Souji finally transforms back into his real form to the girls' relief.   They're about to head back out but Aika immediately closes it.   It's pandamonium outside with the whole school running around searching for Solar. The clubroom has soundproofing installed apparently.   Souji wonders if he should transform into Solar one more time to quell the panic but the girls stop him from doing so with all their power.    Meanwhile at Ultimagui base, Isuna is watching the new battle footage fanatically.   She pulls off her pants to take off her undies but meganep stops her.   She wants to give Tailred her panties but Meganep isn't about to let that happen.   A message from the leader bursts into the room   They think it's because he's mad at all her idolry but it turns out to be orders to capture a rebel alive.   The picture sent along with the message burns to ashes as Isuna refers to him as the once called strongest ultimaguil warrior and the sole holder of the twintail rivaling ponytail elemera.  END VOL 4                 Impression here, this was noticeably weaker than the other volumes since it didn't really integrate the ultimaguil side all that well into the main story. I can see why they rewrote so many of vol 4's scenario details for the anime since it really came off as a breather volume in spite of how much of Souji's twintail insanity it sets up.   And to be clear, Arachne Guildy did not call up a trapification storm in the novel. I'm sure that was there to give the arc a finale-esque climax.      Him becoming Solar is akin to being a trap by way of their desire to become their ideal.  Is this the literal translation? I really hate to think that the nips would actually use that word     You mean "trap"? It's otokonoko over there.     Arachne Guildy is awed by his twintail love but warns him that if he takes it too far he may just become literal twintails.   "And I wouldn't have it any other way!!"  alpha as fuck      Solar.    I wouldn't say Twintails are worth much by themselves, but they're a perfect quantifier of other values.   bump      Twintails are air to me.    Who /Dark Grasper/ here?   why are the bald guys' legs so looong?   Twintails are a symbol of status.   Tailureddo.    what kind of status?    Twintailed girls belong to the Untouchables.    You forgot megane.   I dropped this out of tight schedule but now I regret it more and more. Should I pick it up again and wait for the BD?   BD are done.     Twintails plus cute boys is the best.    Just because I love twintails doesn't mean I love who they're attached to.    This flatness This perfection        I really don't like that so many flat characters in anime have a complex about it.  So you're flat. Fine. There are men who like that, so what's the problem? Aika is great as she is.  I wish japan would stop giving flat chested characters a breat size complex.         Japan does it because it realizes that flat chests are inferior and its characters know that.    Unless the man they're lusting after is a cowtitfag, it's usually less about what men want and more about the body type they want for themselves. Or because some big breasted slut keeps being smug about it.   pls violate and humiliate me Hime-sama!  Perfection.     Here's your reply, bait-kun.   Living the dream.     Shalom!

Sure it has sentai elements too, but practically every female character is in love with the MC who in turn is too dense to figure out that anyone is interested in him. Twintails is very much a harem.    are you dense too    based sysadmin living the dream       He died right? I hope he did for having such a shit opinion.
