[ Were any of you /a/utists in any anime clubs at any point?<br>How cringey were the members?</br>  Anime is something you discuss on /a/ and not in real life  <br>My cringy weeb girlfriend forced me to go to an anime club meeting once back in highschool.

All this only takes a quick google.</br>  <br>I wish</br>  <br>Reiji has legitimately not done a single thing wrong throughout the entire series.</br>  So why does this guy ALWAYS starts with a perfect hand?  <br><br> watching a children's show </br></br>  <br>it's pg-13</br>  <br>He was za pahfect before Reiji</br>  <br><br>r u 13 m8?</br></br>  <br>Salvation updates the fastiest and that's because hack137 is some Ultra-NEET who scripts cards like lightening and creates decks for them in minutes. Literally has a deck featuring new cards everyday the day the cards were revealed.</br>  <br>I want to say he mishandled the Battle Royale with how much of a bloodbath it was; but it unlocked Yuyas edgy EGAO mode and Yuzu dissapearing is pretty much what let him bring Yuya along to syncro, so even the fuck ups help his plan along</br>  <br>The power of the Cyber style, I love how GX managed to make each deck represent a school subject.<br><br><br> Not watching it <br>Your loss.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>According to who?

Only part he didn't expect was Yugo appearing and being an "ally"</br></br></br>  <br>~~~</br>  <br>Can't be that hard to script new cards when he can probably copypaste the script of a card with similar effects</br>  <br>This, we can pretty much assume that Reiji wanted everything that happened to happen to "weed out" the weak duelists.</br>  <br>No he didn't, since Himika implied their original keikaku. <br> Obelisk come in <br> use Battle Royale to shut down the city and cover it up <br> defeat Obelisk with the Youth Lancer candidates while Shun scouts out the Junior Youth <br> carry on tournament <br><br>But obviously things didn't go that way. Reiji's thing is adapting whatever happens into his keikaku and finding a way to twist it into his favor.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If only this wasn't an anonymous imageboard</br>  <br> No he didn't, since Himika implied their original keikaku <br> Himika </br></br>  <br> Not watching a childrens show </br>  <br>Nigga he said that the only people who would be qualified as Lancers were the ones who fought back Academia utilizing Pendulum Summon, and he was right since everyone except Yugo didn't and died<br><br>Serena is there because she's from Academia and Tsukikage is their bodyguard.</br></br></br>  <br> character designer for Arc-V <br>Thats weird, his manga Yuya looks quite a bit more elf-like than the anime</br></br>  <br>That was only after he saw all the Youth except one get wiped out. The 'Sawatari Generation' were left by default. How would he know beforehand the Obelisk Force's capabilities?</br>  <br>That's because someone else on the staff (Akemi Yokota) takes his sketches and makes ready-for-anime character models with them, while the manga is all Miyoshi's style.</br>  <br>Why is his brother there? Explain that.</br>  <br>The Lancers asked that when they saw Reira at the neetcave and Reiji replied with "He's just as good as i am"</br>  <br>Wouldn't it make more sense for someone that strong to stay home in case Standard gets invaded while the Lancers are away? Also, he'd be with his mom.<br><br>Who he is terrified of. Oh.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, how would Reiji, the king of keikaku, know that a specialized force of duelists working for his father from the Fusion Dimension who successfully destroyed the Xyz Dimension are stronger than these mooks he got from a tournament<br><br>It's not like Sora and Barrett, duelists that he saw with his very own eyes are strong and exceptional at combat and on the battlefield, were anything impressive /sarcasm</br></br></br>  <br>I want a Yuuya</br>  <br>We have enough guys sitting in chairs</br>  is there a more pathetic yugioh protagonist than yuya  <br>There isn't a cuter one that's for sure</br>  <br> king of keikaku <br>He's got what, 3 years of experience and even less when it comes to actually waging war? Compared to his much older dad.<br><br>The Youth candidates weren't randomly chosen, they were the top 8 in their category. It's just that Standard is gimped compared to the other dimensions. <br><br>Reiji says he avoids hopeless battles with no chance of success, so I doubt he threw them all at Obelisk knowing, for sure, that they'd all get carded without even defeating a single Obelisk. But they did confirm to him that the odds against Standard are stacked against them, which is where he started thinking further into the future with the whole Synchro alliance thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yuma</br>  <br>Yusei &gt; Yugi &gt; Yuya=Judai &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yuma</br>  <br>But it was successful<br>It weeded out the strong duelists, gave everyone surefire motivation to go against Fusion, and motivated Yuuya to go egao II</br></br>  <br> The Youth candidates <br>really, what the fuck, these were supposed to be the best of the best and yet they got carded while nobodies of the You Show survived.</br></br>  <br>Yes, because things fall into his favor anyway or he spins it that way after adapting, not because everything stuck perfectly and to the letter of his original plan.</br>  <br> best of the best <br><br>The LDS Teachers were the best of the best and many of them got one-offed by Shun</br></br></br>  <br>Who is the last remaining Xyz and among the best of an already elite rebellion force</br>  <br>Reiji's keikakus are really questionable at this point, I wonder what is he keikakuing with the friendship cup now.</br>  About to start 5Ds  because of Yusei , what am I in for  <br>shoryukens and dropping interesting plot points</br>  <br>Shit</br>  <br>  Yuya=Judai <br>m8</br></br>  <br>Drinking milk in bars, using trash cards that fit you perfectly and a poncho.</br>  <br>My deck has no pathetic cards</br>  Upcoming duels according to 2ch<br><br>1.

Worst characters for worst duelist.</br></br>  <br>Trash opinion that fits you perfectly</br>  <br>finally, sawatari will win. Who is Christian?</br>  <br> 6. Sawatari vs Yuzu <br>The duel that should have happened more than 60 episodes ago if not for EGAO.wav.</br></br>  <br> Sawatari <br> win </br></br>  <br> plot featuring elements of social classism, abusive law enforcement, forming strong bonds with people who aren't family, and appreciation of cards that are not as powerful as others <br> scrap-fisting </br></br>  <br>I was in the same position as you recently (went in liking Yusei) and I enjoyed it <br><br>a lot of people here exaggerate how bad it gets after episode 64, it's still pretty good<br><br>but the first 64 eps are pretty insane</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 6. Sawatari vs Yuzu <br>I hope this is real, Sawatari will lose, but he will restore the Citrus's EGAO just like he did for Yuya</br></br>  <br>And the Obelisk Force are an elite force of the best duelists Academia can produce and I'm pretty sure Reiji knew this since he met them when he was a kid and if his dad has to sent these guys who had to specialize their decks just to counter Serena and took duelists out without the counter deck, they must be powerful<br><br>Reiji knows and stated that you must make sacrifices in war, and sending the Youth Lancers to be slaughtered was a good sacrifice since he used the fight against the Obelisk Force to rally up Standard to get new recruits when they come back</br></br></br>  <br> Sawatari vs Yuzu <br>Plz don't job Yuzu.</br></br>  <br> Sawatari vs Yuzu <br> Sawatari wins and something happens to Yuzu <br> Yuzu.wav and Super Egao mode </br></br></br>  <br> Selena vs Dennis <br>Oh shit son</br></br>  <br>It's from V-Jump</br>  <br> losers get sent somewhere <br><br> They're gonna make Yuzu lose so she can't reunite with Yuya aren't they?</br></br></br>  <br>He still kept 2000LP penalty for lancers</br>  <br>Predictions:<br>Crow<br>Tsukikage<br>Dennis<br>Shun<br>Yuya<br>Yugo<br>Sawatari</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eventually, yeah. <br><br>Then Fusion is going to invade.</br></br></br>  <br>Twincest</br>  <br> Sawatari <br>I want to see him win as much as the next guy but let's be realistic here: never gonna happen</br></br>  <br> Sawatari </br>  <br>Reiji might have updated the penalty system to even affect players (read Fusion dimension), who attempt to ambush 1vs1 duels<br>but most likely Reiji is all about his keikaku and didn't even think about the penalty system</br></br>   Yuzu vs Sawatari <br>Literally my worst nightmare. <br><br>Shitposting city no matter who wins</br></br></br>  <br>If they can't overcome a 2000LP penalty then they're not fit to be Lancers.</br>  <br>Sawatari is the real protector of EGAO.</br>  <br> Nii sama why are they taking penalty? <br> Shi- I mean it's all according to plan, it shapes the character Reira </br></br>  <br>why do they have to have him lose to Yuzu of all people</br>    <br> Crow <br> Shinji <br> Serena <br> Shun <br> Yuya <br> Yugo <br> Yuzu <br><br>Sawatari winning would be cool though.<br>I have a feeling Dennis will throw the match against Serena again. If not he'll probably wreck, but I just want to see Yuzu vs Serena.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, he did kind of kidnap her that one time.<br><br>But he might win, it is Yuzu after all. She's the Joey character, all her duels are toss-ups.</br></br></br>  <br>Eh, I see it as<br><br> Crow <br> Tsukikage <br> Serena <br> Shun <br> Yuya <br> Yugo <br> Yuzu <br><br>I want Dennis to get his rematch as much as the next guy but I'm expecting a Serena VS Yuya/Yugo or a Serena VS Yuzu duel<br><br>Same with Yuzu, I'm expecting a Yuzu VS Yuya or Yuzu VS Serena duel</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> pecs <br>Only adds to the hypothesis: dueling makes you jacked<br><br>Dennis will undoubtedly win against Serena. We've seen Serena duel and beat him while he was holding back already.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yuzu wins <br> all these Yuzufags shitting up the thread for their bland character <br> Sawatarifags will never have their day  <br><br>life is hard</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree with dennis throwing the match</br>  <br>Yeah most probably. So who's Dennis going to duel after? Shun or Yuzu?</br>  <br> Sawatari wins <br> all these Sawatarifags shitting up the thread for their bland character <br> Yuzufags will never have their day <br><br>life is hard</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sawatari is obviously going to win, he's gracefully let other people win so that they can have the spotlight for long enough now. Yuzu is too shit at the game to beat someone who's at the top of LDS, he's a seperate tier from the rest in terms of being a player without argument. Hell, even Reiji probably can't beat him since all the time that Reiji spends on running a company, Sawatari spends on actually practicing.<br><br>We've already seen how charismatic he is, and he's without a doubt the fan favorite of the entire show. The number of bad characters who were carried through his effort is almost countless, and without him the entire show would've plummeted by now. They've deliberately avoided showing the effects of his card so that they can have the grand reveal this time, there is literally 0% chance that he's going to lose. Yuzu has no reason to win, whereas Sawatari has a legacy to uphold so that people can stop underestimating his potential. <br><br>It's sad to see how many people in this general seem to be under the impression that Sawatari is a jobber. He's the opposite of a jobber, he doesn't fuck up just to let other characters look better, he spends his time working together with his opponent in order to create an enjoyable enviroment for everybody. He's mastered all of the summoning mechanics, and by now has probably become the true pioneer of Pendulums. Yuzu can't even compare to is feats and obviously upcoming grand events.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We've also seen enough Entermage and Entermate shilling<br><br>Let's get some fucking Moonlights already</br></br></br>  <br> Sawatari <br> bland </br></br>  <br>Episode 7.<br>She did say she would beat the crap out of him</br></br>  <br>We didn't get to see Underworld Troupe though</br>  <br> Sawatari <br> bland <br>You cannot seriously be pretending like Sawatari doesn't have flavor as a character. He's legitimately fun to have around and actually works off other characters. Yuzu has always been boring as fuck on screen, like there's not a single exception where other characters weren't being more appealing than her.</br></br></br>  <br>All out Dennis vs. Shun would be really interesting to watch</br>  <br> mfw final duel of ARC-V is Yuya vs Sawatari <br> mfw I have no face </br></br>  <br>Alright who let him on the computer again</br>  <br>damn why couldn't they have worked out these matches differently<br><br>I really want to see Yuzu vs. Selena but I really want to see Dennis vs. Shun</br></br></br>  <br>You're already shitting up the thread and the duel hasn't even happened yet.</br>  <br> I don't like it's so it's shitposting <br>I will never understand why Yuzufags are under the impression that she's anything but bland.</br></br>  <br>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br><br><br>Dennis and Shun had their duel  That Shun was obviously going to win <br><br>Dennis has had enough fucking duels man, let the characters who haven't shined actually do something. Serena has had literally two on-screen duels since she appeared, and one of them wasn't even entirely her's.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone else has shit decks, at least Entermages have actual potential.</br>  <br>This is the obvious outcome. Unless Underworld Troupe suddenly get released, Yuzu vs Sawatari isn't even a toss up.</br>  <br> Implying Selena has a chance at winning <br>She's in a rematch against someone who she beat because he was holding back A LOT.<br><br> Sawatari vs Yuzu <br>Fuck : Yoshido IS back. There's no way Yuzu can win this when Sawatari has built up so much losing karma to be paid back. <br><br>Good bye female characters in Arc-V it was fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to hold hands with Melissa Claire!  <br> That Shun was obviously going to win <br>But Dennis was going to win at the end. Sure you can blame it on the penalty but remember that Dennis still hasn't actually used the full extent of his abilities.</br></br>    <br>I really hope you're just taking the piss because you're being a huge faggot even though the duel is weeks away still.</br>  I don't know guys, Tsukikage is kind of lame since we've seen Ninjas already and I want Shun and Shinji to duel since they both have that rebellious trait and have their own respective resistances  OPT  That's two pages, retard.                            Anyone here read D.Gray-Man? I'm about 80 chapters in, it's boring and the scans are eye cancer. Does it get better?

Most examples of serious drama in anime are either from films or older series, such as The Rose of Versailles. Even though we still get more serious films, recently see Giovanni no Shima, there haven't been any equivalents from TV anime in years. And it's not like these series were unknown in the past. They were never a plentiful, but more mature dramas without the ridiculous attempts at humor did exist. For example, Dezaki directed a decent number of them under TMS and Nippon Animation had several through their World Masterpiece Theater series. These types of series have completely disappeared in recent years.  Is Madoka Magica any good?  no  yes  yes  no  no  <br><br>/a/ in two posts.</br></br>  yes  <br> i'm going to ask ransom strangers on teh interwebs if i'll like this [anime] </br>  <br>You suck, that's undeniable</br>  maybe  It was fun to watch with /a/ when it was airing. I've had no desire to rewatch it or see any of the movies though.  I don't know.  Yes  <br>It's mediocre. Definitely not one of Shaft's strongest works but if you have any familiarity in the magical girl genre you'll like it. Keep in mind to not touch the movies. You're better off pretending to those don't exist.</br>  can't be ruled out  <br>Also it was kinda funny when the movie got nominated for an oscar. The articles from butthurt critics were amusing.</br>  Homu turn evil.  Rebellion/Homuwhore ruined it beyond repair. Madoka never loved Homura who never did anything good for anyone.  <br>http://www.ask8ball.net/</br>  It's okay, 6/10. Massively overrated by its deranged fanbase though.  Never forget  <br>It's allright, 9/10.</br>  <br>0/10<br><br>Only delusional Homudegenerates derive any pleasure from its shit story outside of wanting Homura to suffer for once.</br></br></br>  <br>The only character I liked was Kyubey.</br>  <br>It's pretty good. 7/10<br><br><br>Acting sinister isn't necessarily evil.</br></br></br></br>  <br>people here seem to dislike it but i liked it a lot, rebellion too. i thought it was good</br>  <br>It's one of the best shows in the last 10 years</br>  <br>No but killing heaven, torturing souls, having literally no love inside you, and dooming the universe for laughs is.<br><br>Madoka never cared about Homura.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Yes. It's far from flawless, but it holds it's own damn well, and has some solid rewatch value, since almost everything in the beginning has a hidden meaning that makes sense later, and the later events are foreshadowed well in advance, if you know where to look.<br><br>Watch the series first, then move onto the third Movie, since the first two are just recaps of the series, while Rebellion is a proper follow up.<br><br>Enjoy your suffering!</br></br></br></br></br>  What is she thinking?  <br>Kevin</br>  homerun best girl  <br>Fact</br>      <br>You speak truthful words.</br>    <br>Do you have any saved links to said articles?</br>  <br>I hear the judges never even watched it. Anyone know if this is true?</br>  <br>It's alright. There's a bunch of better mahou shoujo anime though.<br><br>Would go so far as to say Prisma Illya is better.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Worst girl. Unloved. Total shit. No character. Dumbass stalker. Ruined the show. Deserves to suffer and die.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It didn't get nominated, it just got submitted. And yes, none of the judges even watched it, but none of the judges watch any of the animation submissions.</br>  <br>you may be an austist, anon. i'm sorry you had to find out this way.</br>  <br>The series is not so God however the movies are great, but you honestly have to watch the entirety of the series to know whats going on, it's 12 episodes so I think you can bear with it and it does have it's momments</br>  <br>Damn it. Going through some threads, I feel dark temptations coming along. Is this how !HOMU felt?</br>  <br>It's excellent, /a/ just likes to hate on it because it's popular and /a/ loves being contrarian. <br>Its fanbase is concentrated autism, though.</br></br>  <br>You already impregnated her. Take responsibility.</br>    <br> implying I wouldn't </br>  10/10 Anime of the Century.  <br>Literally kill her, Madoka. Nobody likes her.</br>  <br>is it worth spending all eternity shunned from heaven and hell?</br>  <br>To act on them?</br>  It's shit by virtue of generating the most autistic /a/ fanbase yet.  <br>This thread went to shit fast.</br>  <br>One the threads a while ago made me rewatch cause someone said madoka canonical doesn't care for homura but it seems like they form a friendship that homura understandably gets obsessive over</br>  <br>OP asked a simple question about a massively popular anime and it was answered. What did you expect would happen afterwards, a sing-a-long?</br>  <br>Where is this from? MAL?</br>  <br> literally falling for one of /a/'s most famous shitposters </br>  <br> cause someone said madoka canonical doesn't care for homura <br>Don't listen to retards and HomuHater imitators.</br></br>  <br>No one really think's that.<br>It's just from some low-life shitposter.</br></br>  When it was coming out people compared it with Evangelion. While they did it for the wrong reasons I think there's a clear connection: both are genre shows that appeal to those who don't like the genre. People who couldn't tolerate super robo loved Eva, and people who can't stand a single transformation sequence loved Madoka. In that sense it's a pleb show, but in a scenario in which being patrician means being a scholar about cheap little children television.  <br><br><br>I hadn't watched it in a while, I thought I missed it the first time</br></br></br>  <br> yes </br>  <br>Did you really miss the naked space hug in Episode 12 where Madoka calls Homura "my best friend"?</br>  <br>Stay on topic.</br>  What's the best mahou shoujo?  <br>Oh boy here we go.</br>  <br>There's only one correct answer.</br>    <br>Ojamajo Doremi</br>  <br><br>The person asked "what's" not "who's".<br>They could mean what is best magical girl anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Cardcaptor sakura is my favorite of the genre</br>  <br>Madoka</br>  <br>Watching it with /a/ ruined it for me. I remember the month of pure hype when the final episodes got delayed because of the earthquake. People came up with crazier and crazier theories about the ending and when the episodes finally aired, it was such a letdown.</br>  <br>All episodes other than 10 were a letdown.</br>  <br>Madoka only pitied her, it wasn't a friendship. The Dokes lied just to be polite.<br><br><br><br><br> implying I am wrong <br>Madoka never cared about Homura.<br><br><br>A white lie, Madoka saw how shit she was and pitied her.<br><br><br><br>Useless characterless garbage worthy of abortion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Either Doremi or Tutu.</br>  <br>Then why was she naked?<br>Madoka wanted Homu's homus</br></br>  <br>They weren't, they had star dresses. Clothes don't go to heaven. Homura got there because she was obsessed and Madoka told her to fuck off.</br>    <br>Here's your Blu-ray.</br>  <br>Still not lewd, Madoka is straight and not attracted to Homushit.<br> nudity means lust <br>No.</br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't implying lust, just proving to you that they were nude, you retard.</br>  <br>Not in the definitive movie canon.<br><br>Madoka always thought Homura was worthless shit.</br></br></br>  What would you do if Umaru-chan was your imouto?  watch anime<br>read manga<br>buy snacks<br><br>she's not that bad, she just needs to clean up after herself</br></br></br></br>  <br>send back to my family and change address</br>  <br>Spank her.

Or if you're watching nothing what is your favorite?<br><br>I just downloaded Mobile Suit Gundam and Zeta. What am I in for, I have never watched a single Gundam.<br><br>Also Finished Ie Naki Ko some time ago and I didn't really like the ending.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Watch every single Gundam in production order up to and including Turn A.<br><br>Then watch GBF and G-Reco.<br><br>You can ignore the rest of the franchise. It's all ranging from mediocre to garbage.</br></br></br></br>  Watched Download: Namu Amida Butsu wa Ai no Uta. It doesn't have any subs sadly, but it was an interesting watch nonetheless. Kinda trippy at some points.<br><br><br> What am I in for <br><br>Two fantastic war stories featuring children and giant robots. If you plan on watching more Gundam after those, don't expect the same tone in the following series, ZZ.</br></br></br></br></br>  Very nearly done with the Urusei Yatsura TV series. Then it's onto the movies and OVAs.  I'm also currently downloading the 1080p rip of Utena and it's nearly finished. I'm wondering how can I permanently add subs the the episodes without having to to that every episode?  <br>If you mean not having to load the sub file every single time, then just save them in same folder with the same filenames as the videos.</br>  <br> every single Gundam in production order up to and including Turn A <br> ignore the rest of the franchise. It's all ranging from mediocre to garbage <br>But Wing, G and X are also mediocre to garbage.<br><br><br>I've tried getting into Urusei Yatsura to satiate a need for more Oshii, but it feels kind of slow. Does it pick up, or should I skip straight to the movies Oshii directed?<br><br><br> What am I in for <br>Basically the two best Gundam series. The animation is of course very dated and there is a fair bit of weekly toy fight in them, but the stories and characters for both series are the best in the franchise.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>G is easily one of the top three best Gundams.<br>X is wasted potential since it was canceled, but it wasn't a bad show.<br>Wing is mediocre but still better than most other AUs.<br><br>Turn A is the best Gundam, and you're going to enjoy it a lot more if you see these three first because of all the references, so they're worth watching just because of that, if anything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't super into 0079 but Zeta is a pretty solid show. I'm currently watching ZZ and  I'm liking it more than both of them. </br>  <br>MKVToolNix. It's also handy for making certain audio or sub tracks the primary ones, if you've downloaded a dual audio release or something.</br>  <br> you're going to enjoy it a lot more if you see these three first because of all the references <br>Pretty much the only reference that matters is DG cells, aside from that you get glimpses of the Gundam X and I think ONE glimpse of an MS from Wing. Nobody needs to see them to enjoy Turn A.<br><br> G is easily one of the top three best Gundams. <br>If you like Dragonball Z maybe. Personally I hate it, but I respect that a lot of people like it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rewatching Serial Experiments Lain.<br><br>I don't know why I do this to myself every year, the ending depresses me for weeks.</br></br></br>  Ie Naki Ko's last episode is what I figured Bahamut's ending reminded me of the other thread.  <br> X <br> mediocre to garbage <br><br>x was good</br></br></br></br>  Speaking of Gundam I finished G about 2 days ago. Was legit as fuck. The last episode was actually really fucking good.<br><br>Why is Allenby so perfect?</br></br>  <br>Why do the best girls always lose?</br>  <br>Anyone else downloaded the Shoujo Kakumei Utena 1997 torrent? wondering if the flac files in there are needed for anything?</br>  Space Runway Ideon<br>the pacing feels really off for some reason, but overall not too bad so far</br>  <br>Best girl won the Jew's Dough in ZZ though.</br>  Just watching some Toei moeshit.    <br> What are some old anime you are currently watching? <br>Was watching Dunbine but the amount of laser spam and the lack of everything else in the later parts lead to a break.<br> I just downloaded Mobile Suit Gundam and Zeta <br> What am I in for <br> I have never watched a single Gundam <br>You start with 0079 you uncultured swine.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   G is good and one of the best Gundam <br> X is good  <br><br>Off to a rocky start.</br></br></br>  <br>You are a weird guy, I found ZZ to be a huge step down from Z</br>  <br>She should have saved and won the best boy in all of Gundam, our lord and savior Glemy.<br>Judau deserved to suffer with Elle, but Elle didn't deserve to suffer with fucking Beecha.</br></br>  <br>Only PHG is allowed to say PHG things.</br>  <br>I watched ZZ immediately after finish Zeta so the change in pacing and the atmosphere was pretty jarring.<br><br>But by the time I finished ZZ, I liked it more than Zeta. <br><br>Also, 4chan is a pretty contrarian site and since Zeta is the most popular Gundam, a lot of people are tired of zetafags and pretend they prefer ZZ instead to annoy them. This attitude comes and goes, especially on /m/.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shut the heck up Basara.</br></br>  <br>I liked Zeta but there's something about it and 0079 that feels really weird. The character interactions felt stilted and didn't flow very well. This wasn't as big a problem for Zeta, though. I feel the lighthearted ZZ flows a lot better and is more enjoyable to watch.</br>  <br>The encodes bakabt have for that are horrible and basically scrub all watercolor texture out of the pretty backgrounds.</br>  <br>Why does this loli have herpes?</br>  Since I've been replaying SRW MX I decided to rewatch Machine Robo: Revenge of Cronos.<br><br>It's still as good as ever.<br>If you want some cheesy 80's robot show it's the probably one of the best of that decade.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Acting completely inhuman and like whacky cartoon characters flowed better?</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  Is Hades Project Zeorymer any good?  <br>It's kinda subpar for a super robot show but yeah it's nice.<br><br>The MC is basically a proto Shinji for most things, the robots are cool and the music is good, the plot and characters tend to go a bit full retard sometimes, especially on the villains' side, also the first episodes are kinda slow but the series build up well around the middle.<br><br>Though each time Zeorymer is activated you'll probably get pretty hype.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KkF<wbr>13YQkPx0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Orguss 02<br><br>The robot stuff is kind of meh, but I like the dark atmosphere</br></br></br>  <br>CCS is better than all of them.</br>  <br> TL;DR Gundam by Tomino Kawaii </br>  I watched this movie called "Birth" last night. The ending was cool but otherwise it was pretty shit. The animators seriously gave no fucks about proportion.  Finished G Gundam and Ashita no Joe 2. G Gundam was really good, enjoyed it far more than any Gundam since 0079 (have been watching in production order since mid-June) though the second half had a lot of "Wow, really?" moments. <br>Ashita no Joe 2 had a rocky start, what with them retconning the entire last 30 episodes of the first series, but I liked the serious tone a lot more than the first series. It didn't have as memorable of a soundtrack as the first series, but it was still very good. The ending was excellent, though Joe's self-destructive actions mirroring Rikiishi's annoyed me and pleased me at the same time.<br><br>Currently watching Wing, will finish the last 9 episodes later today, and it's not as bad as people say. 40 episodes in and there hasn't been anything that really impressed me, but nor has there been anything that I thought was incredibly bad (aside from a few "euugh" reactions to some outstanding QUALITY). It's not bad, just not very good either. The soundtrack lacks the "oomph" G Gundam and Victory had, and there's a lack of any emotionally charged scenes. The world building is commendable though, as the conflict is very clear and defined as opposed to the previous Gundams, excluding G Gundam. The first OP is nice though, and reminds me of Utena's OP for some reason.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ljX<wbr>FL4dyDIk</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gRn<wbr>m-769QLE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>And when I talk about memorable soundtrack for Ashita no Joe, I mean these tracks<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6Bf<wbr>jKgLHET0</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gBK<wbr>B0Ufu7ic</wbr>  [ ]<br>I've had the second ED stuck in my head for weeks now.<br><br>On that note, post your favourite pre-2000 OSTs. I'd be interested to see others' favourites</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only watched Ashita no Joe 2, probably the best Dezaki show closely followed by Space Cobra which has probably the best BD I have seen so far.<br>Man, I love old anime in glorious 1080p.</br></br>  <br>I'm 5 episodes into ZZ and am having trouble getting through it. Can't seem to sit down and watch it like with the first two series last year.</br>  <br>buy dianna soriel is the best girl.</br>  <br>MACHI O TSUTSUMUUUUUUUU<br> <br>WHAT GOING OOOOOOOON</br> </br></br>  <br>Episodes 1-17 have nearly zero plot.</br>  <br>Those are bread jam, anon.</br>  <br>Any better torrent then?</br>  <br>There were raws on nyaa but the torrent is dead now and they were raw in the first place. They might look bad but they're the only option so I'm not the one to bitch really.</br>  <br><br>Oh my, that ending!</br></br>  <br>The 1080p version that HorribleSubs ripped from CR for Ashita no Joe 2 looked beautiful as well, even if it had some of the tell tale signs of being a stream rip. I really want to watch the Space Cobra BDs, since I've only seen the film, which itself looked quite good. Have you seen the TurnA BDs? I'm downloading the 1080p EG encode off of bakabt now, and the screenshots for it look great as well.<br>Why do BD remasters for old shows look so much better than BDs of a lot of recent shows? I don't think I've ever been actually impressed by the visuals or artwork of what people would call "modern anime".</br></br>  <br>2bogi4me</br>  I'm rewatching the D'Arby episode of the Jojo OVA for the umpteenth time. The OVA fights apart from Vanilla Ice feel much more tense and dramatic than the TV anime.  <br><br>I'm actually watching that show, and it wasn't meant as a reaction image.</br></br>  <br>Make sure to watch the first (and if possible the second) Origins OVA after the first coeur of 0079 at the 13 episode mark, it makes the frankly shitty second coeur much better.</br>  <br> Implying Elle is not best girl </br>  <br>boring autistic mecha fights</br>  <br>I'm watching Cowboy Bebop, an anime I never finished, and then I'll probably give Cyber City Oedo 808 a shot. I need to find time to watch VOTOMS' Space Vietnam arc.</br>  <br> Mobile Suit Gundam <br>The birth of Real Robot, corny but decent.<br> Zeta <br>The epitome of Tomino, great world construction and mech design, terrible understanding of human beings and women in general. Char is literally the only sane person in the series.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oniisama e... Is the best dezaki show.</br>  <br>Nice meme opinions, do you parrot everything you see other people say?</br>  Watching Rose of Versailles right now.<br>The parts about von Fersen really annoy me for some reason.</br>  I just finished Turn A.<br><br>That shit was good.<br><br> FUCK POLE, THOUGH! HOW THE FUCK DID THAT GENOCIDAL MONSTER NOT SUFFER FOR ALL THE SHIT SHE PULLED?! YES, I FUCKING MAD!! </br></br></br></br>  <br>That was my honest assessment after watching the show.</br>  <br><br><br>Indeed.<br>They NEVER mention that Char goes insane for some reason for Char's Counterattack.</br></br></br></br>  maison ikkoku and legend of the galactic heroes<br>i started watching logth but got sidetracked and dropped it,then later started watching maison ikkoku and dropped that.. now im watching logth again.<br>maison ikkoku is an alright anime imo. it's not bad but not really top tier either, just alright that<br>legends i like but i haven't watched too many of the series yet. only up to episode 30 or so, still good series.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, I wasn't talking about Char's Counterattack, I was talking about Zeta.</br>  <br>And what comes after ZZ?</br>  <br>Why does that matter? When I talk about MSG Zeta I'm not talking about CCA, or 0079, or the OVAs, or ZZ, or Turn A. I'm talking about Zeta. On it's own.</br>  <br>I guess I should try to get over this hurdle then.</br>  Green Lupin is best Lupin  "Lovely Angels"  <br>It's one of my favorites as well but I feel like the drama in the beginning is way over the top. Probably something I would enjoy more with a second watch.</br>  What show has the best BD remaster? Outlaw Star?  <br><br>It's pretty melodramatic throughout, never taking a step back for more than a episode at a time. The worst offender is Miya and her love, which is near the end of the series. Still, it's my second favorite Dezaki (though I've only seen 4).</br></br>  <br><br>What I said here. </br></br>  <br> great world construction <br>You dont actually believe this, do you? Zeta's biggest flaw apart from the incredibly fast pace and hordes of inconsequential characters is the fact that there was little to no world development or depth at all.</br></br>  <br><br> Zeta <br> Incredibly fast paced <br><br>That's just a stupid thing to say.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the art reminds me of popolocrois</br>  <br>I find its fairly love or hate if you can accept the melodrama and love it's ridiculousness you'll love it. If you can't hate.</br>  <br>Moeshit only started with K-on! and Lucky Star.</br>  <br>Why? They try and squeeze in too much in a 50 episode series, most of which is ultimately made completely irrelevant by every single series made after it.</br>  <br> Pic related <br>It came out in 96 I think, it's still better then some of the crap that's came out recently.<br> I downloaded Gundam 0079 and Zeta Gundam <br> Never watched Gundam, is it good? <br>Those are 2 of the better series out of them all. If you don't mind the older animation. If that's not an issue I'll just say pretty to have you life become amazing</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Given how Dezaki's style only serves to highlight that aspect, it would be hard to stick with it if you couldn't accept it.<br><br><br><br> Zeta was made irrelevant immediately <br> ZZ's major story events are only possible because of Zeta's major story events </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Before anyone asks.  <br>I said "most of which". <br>Haman and Axis-Zeon only appeared in episode 30, and only the events of the last 15 or so episodes were relevant to anything in ZZ. Barely anything that happened in both was relevant to CCA. Even Amuro's love interest, Beltorchika, the focus of several episodes was completely replaced in CCA. There is no overall consistency between the series, because Zeta was poorly thought out.</br></br>  I just finished Macross in  English dub <br>That's about it</br>  <br>  racist designs listed in negatives for G Gundams </br>  <br>Why didn't you post the more accurate one?</br>  <br>Did those two ever fuck? Because Relena had a massive wide-on for Heero.</br>  <br>been working my way through the mecha genre since I've seen so little of it. finished gun/diebuster, now about to start watching giant robo: the animation. I have a hard time getting into franchises with tens of different releases, so gundam is gonna take a while for me to actually pick up</br>  Who likes Vampire Hunter D?<br><br>I don't know if anybody has too strong an opinion on this but, I feel that Vampire Hunter D (1985 film) was inferior to the sequel, ‎Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust.<br><br>And I have yet to read the novels yet.</br></br></br></br>  This is a series that I'm disappointed has never been adapted into an anime.<br><br>That being said, we do have a bunch of live action movies, and tv series.</br></br>  <br> I feel that Vampire Hunter D (1985 film) was inferior to the sequel, ‎Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust. <br><br>Everyone agrees.<br><br>Also, nice relevant trips.</br></br></br></br></br>  I still have to watch Evangelion. I've never, ever, watched it. Currently still going through Gundam G.  <br> on 4chan <br> hasn't watched NGE </br></br>  <br> ~ Little Memole | Little Beret Memoru | Memoru in the Pointed Hat | Wee Wendy | Tongari Boushi no Memoru |  <br> One year ago the pint-sized Memoru and a few hundred of her people crash landed their spaceship on Earth. They've since been living on a lake island, with only the large objects that wash ashore as their knowledge of humans. One day, young Memoru and her friends head towards the sound of beautiful music and find a huge house with an equally huge human girl inside. Memoru wants nothing more than to be this girl's friend, but she soon discovers that the girl is sick. Heartbroken, Memoru cries on her would-be friend's face, miraculously healing her - and thus their friendship begins. Together with her people, Memoru experiences life on Earth with a smile and meets plenty of new companions along the way. <br>Where have you been all my life</br></br></br>    <br>Finally started watching LoGH the other day, it's good so far.</br>  Anyone knows where I can get subs for Sei Jushi Bismarck, Tobikage and subs for the BD rips of SPT Layzner?  <br>A little bit confunsing, the MC, as other anon said, is a proto Shinji and I don't like the ending, but the animation is good (for a somewhat obscure 80's OVA), the mechas are great and the battles are very good</br>  <br>Absolute garbage except when Zeorymer is on screen<br>So like a 4/10 overall. At worst you'll waste two hours laughing your ass off and how much of a dick the villain is.</br></br>  <br> Bismarck <br>Enable subtitles on Saber Rider<br> Tobikage <br>Hong Kong or you can wait for Discotek, I personally have very little faith in them getting it released on a timely fashion<br> Layzner <br>Rip the subs off the DVD .mkvs and apply them to the BDs. The one minute of research I did indicates the timing is slightly off</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Re-watching Orphen  in spanish dub <br>I wonder why they didn't make a second season.</br>  whaddup  <br>Thanks!</br>  I'm going through the Galaxy Express TV series and Ashita no Joe now. They're good, but I think I'll watch something lighter after these. They're not the happiest of series.  <br>Saber Rider is just a joke you know, Saber Rider with subtitles is just going to be subbed Saber Rider. Nobody really gives a shit about Bismarck. At some point in the past the entire series was on youtube subbed but it ain't there no more</br>  I'm watching the first Macross now. <br>Really liking it. The focus on the characters and romance is nice and the fights are cool. <br>The QUALITY is insane, but I guess that's to be expected.<br>That dream episode was fucking trippy.</br></br></br>  <br>Did you enjoy Metal Max Solid: Tactical Valkyrie Action?</br>  Is Dallos any good?  <br>You mean when he was disguised in the enemy ship? Yeah, that was fun. <br>On that note, Max is awesome. Ace pilot, handsome, charming. This nigga's going to steal the show.</br></br>  <br>The novels are alright, Kawajiri is a perfect director for the series, and could really animate them.</br>  <br>He does, he's way better than Hikaru. DYRL Hikaru is way better than the TV version though. By, you know, having an actual personality.<br><br>By the way,  KYUN KYUN </br></br></br>  <br>I didn't like it at all, dropped it halfway through, didn't like any of the characters, especially minmay and the plot seem kinda ridiculous. With the giant aliens vs the tiny humans.<br><br>Too bad, wanted to get into it, could I just watch Do You remember Love?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't remember seeing nothing but the first episode subbed on YT. A shame the only subbed 80's mecha series there is Golion, wich is pretty mediocre at best.</br>  <br>DYRL is the movie right? Is it meant to be a sequel or a sort of Rebuild type thing?</br>  <br> that spoiler <br><br>Goddamnit, couldn't they have used different songs, that one got annoying pretty much after the first time.</br></br></br>  <br>Why would watching a different version of the same plot be different if you find the aliens ridiculous?</br>  <br>I like it. But I just got past the episode where  Focker dies  and they played Silver Moon, Red Moon which I like a lot more.</br>  <br>I blame this series for getting me to fap to chinese cartoons.</br>  <br>Crest of the Stars, my reaction is:<br><br>where have you been all my life?</br></br></br>  <br>prepare urself for an entire episode of kaifun fighting aliens and the transition of the first macross into a kung fu battle series</br>  <br>It's basically a remake of the middle bit of the series. <br><br><br>Okay, no KYUN KYUN, but how about  SHAO PAI LONG </br></br></br></br>  <br>What<br>I thought Kaifun hated fighting<br>what does kung fu have to do with robots</br></br></br>  <br>SHAO<br>PAI<br>LONG</br></br></br>  <br>Even though I don't like I still have that feeling that I want to know how it ends, a movie is certainly easier to watch than another 13 episodes.<br><br>Mind spoiling me how it plays out, I dropped after some of the aliens shrunk themselves and were sent to the Macross.</br></br></br>  <br>The most I can tell you is that the movie doesn't play out the same way and the show goes on for several episodes after the end of the war.</br>  <br>Kaifun is actually Shao Pai Long, the last successor to an ancient Chinese martial art used for assassination. He rejects fighting due to his harsh training but when the Zentradi kill Shammy after she personally sorties to save a giant space fish, he forsakes his beliefs and starts a one man war against the entire fleet while being careful to not expend too much power and accidentally destroy the Macross in the process. This was not popular with the otaku of the 80s, hence the series transition into plane robots and musicexclusively</br>  <br>Ridiculous is the name of the macross game. If you disliked that about sdf, you will not like the rest, save for zero, which is boring garbage.</br>  <br><br>What am I reading</br></br>  <br>Plus is slightly more series than the rest, somehow. And is fantastic.</br>  <br>True, but I don't think anyone who hates sdf deserves plus.</br>  <br> series <br>Fuck me, I meant serious obviously</br></br>  <br> Watch every single Gundam in production order up to and including Turn A. <br>  in production order <br> production order <br>Fuck you</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish this would amp up the space epic stuff and tone down the human boy and his perfect curious noble alien girlfriend stuff faster. I mean sure that's what many love but just don't care a bit and feel slightly misled.</br>  <br>How do all of those lead to Turn A?<br>Especially G.</br></br>  Watched Gunbuster last week, was good as fuck.<br>I want to watch some more 80s mecha.</br>  <br>Turn X literally has Shining Finger</br>  <br>Go watch Ideon<br><br>The TV series then Be Invoked, blurays are out up to episode 20-something right now, and Be Invoked has had blurays for a while.</br></br></br>  <br>What?</br>  So, i've never watched any Gundam. Yes, not even Wing (didn't have Cartoon Network when it aired, had shitty local cable with ten channels)<br><br>What should I watch? Does it matter in what order? I really love the art in pics like OP's and I want more of that.</br></br>  <br/>  Dropped Victory recently, probably the worst Gundam I've seen so far. Going chronologically from 0079 to Reconguista.<br><br>Also picked up Dragon Ball, mostly because of influence it had but also my friend has been hyping up Super. It's pretty fun so far, I expected it to be utter shit.</br></br>  <br>I liked Victory<br>Great mech designs, fight choreography, and music. The characters and story were pretty shallow though.</br></br>  <br>Watch 0079, don't listen to anyone who tells you to just watch the compilation movies. They're a good summary if you watched the series already but don't watch them for a first watch cause they do skip shit.</br>  <br>Considering that I'm almost finished with the damn thing, yeah, it picks up.</br>  <br>fuck outta here hothead</br>  <br>I'll give you designs and music but choreography?<br>It was more creative than last few series thanks to some new elements of mobile suits and pilots utilized them far more but most of the fights are standard Gundam affair which is pretty boring. You get a shot of someone firing then a shot of someone either dodging or getting shot at. Tomino keeps reusing and adding some interesting moments to fight but he can't really depict them properly.</br></br>  <br>I thought the creative parts added to the choreography. Seeing Uso launch a part of the victory to throw off an enemy was cool. There was also that part where an enemy tries to attack the victory from behind, but Uso uses his thrusters to counter it and rotates his head to use the vulcans.<br>It was pretty imaginative compared to the other gundams.</br></br>  I just finished Panzer World Galient. It was alright - mechs with rollerskates can't really go wrong.<br><br>Seeing a villian being justified and somewhat sympathetic was good too - Mardoul was probably the most compelling character in the story. Unlike the standard CHARs seen in mecha anime, he wasn't just crazy. Nor was he a Char.</br></br>  <br>It was imaginative and that can be said about a lot of things Tomino made, I think. But outside of those parts fighting was severely fucked thanks to Tomino's direction.</br>  <br> 666 <br><br>i like this<br><br><br>Also i watched Wings of Homnneaise today for the first time and i was really nice. A bit slow paced sometimes for today maybe but i still liked every second.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Just finished episode episode 16 of Utena. Am I the only one that keeps forgetting that they are middle school students? The way they look and act seems like that of someone much older. <br><br>Also, Nanami is best girl   that episode where she turned into a cow seemed really weird and out of place  </br></br>  <br>Fair enough.<br>From what I've seen Victory is one of the more 'love or hate it' types of Gundams.</br></br>  <br>I thought they were highschool students?</br>  <br>Nope. Utena and Mickey have mentioned being middle school freshmen, and I'm assuming the rest of the characters are around the same age.</br>  <br>Am I the only one who thought that the comedy episodes with Nanami were funny or the comedy in general? Those elephants, man.<br><br>Also, I finished downloading the 1080p rip and put the subs on them, can't wait to rewatch it like this.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, that makes some of the later twists pretty awkward.</br>  <br>If Utena were a highschool student it wouldn't have counted as  rape when Akio sexed her </br>  <br>I agree that they were funny, the fact that she literally turned into a cow was strange to see</br>  <br>I liked the curry episode, but the egg and cowbell episodes were just weird.</br>  i've started watching Nadia, but i can't really get into it. <br><br>also downloaded Slam Dunk in 720p rips, but haven't gotten around to it. Love the OP, tho.</br></br>  <br>Mickey's sister Kozue is already a huge fucking slut in her first year of middle school. So yeah, it's pretty weird</br>  <br>There was a lot of unique tactics in Victory. The shoulder beams and wires on the Zoloats, the washing pole and saber wall, etc. But yes, there was a great deal of the same old of Uso trying to shoot a Mobile Suit and missing a few times until it finally hits. Especially during the initial venture into space, where he's completely unaware of how to handle battles.<br><br><br>Victory had some nice Mobile Suits. Almost all of the grunts look good.</br></br></br></br>  <br> he didn't get the metaphor of her turning into a cow. <br>better quit now, you're watching it wrong.</br></br>  <br>Nadia gets better as the show goes on aside from a lot of the island arc. Prepare for Nadia being a bitch.<br><br>Slam Dunk is fucking fantastic though.</br></br></br>  <br>Nanami was my favourite character. But I still didn't like the cow episode.</br>  <br>I like Ikuni's humor.</br>  <br>man, i remember watching that show on 50mb asf files with those green subtitles.<br>how far we have come...</br></br>  <br>I know it was a metaphor, but it wasn't a very good one. I would've compared her to a dog rather than a cow</br>  <br>I'm 100% sure that I'm never going to watch this because of Nadia, from what I've heard the're seem to be no redeeming qualities about her unless you're a hateful vegetarian.</br>  <br>Nadia adventure bits are pretty good, best parts of the show are shortly before island arc and after uniting with Gratan team and Nautilus. Though Africa is just straight up shit.</br>  <br>Her only things that redeems her a tiny bit is acknowledging that she's a bitch at one point. But she's still a bitch 24/7.</br>    Saber Marionette J series. <br><br>So far Lime a cute</br></br>  waiting for a Trigun bluray release. even the so called 'remastered' dvds still have terrible blending in the video.  <br><br>Watched this today, it wasn't much and it put a nice spin on the original series. Best of all they used the old OST.</br></br>  <br>Trigun Bluray? I thought Badlands Rumble was the only BD for Trigun.</br>  <br><br>Gatchaman, or if you want to see how the US raped it "Battle of the planets". That said it does drag on a fucking bit, actually no..fuck gatchaman, it's too long.</br></br>  <br>that's what the 'waiting' part is about.</br>  <br>Oh, you got my hope up.<br>Still waiting on that full adaptation.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5cs<wbr>4lri-9Xg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of the US raping old series<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=BcY<wbr>5OpBcnZE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Wasn't Force Five from England though?</br>  <br>That explains the horrible accents</br>  I just finishes Tekkaman Blade recently. That was absolute garbage from story to animation despite high rating.  Watching Big O, Cardcaptor Sakura and just started Rose of Versailles. From what I know of the French Revolution and old shoujo, I expect it to end happily for everyone.  <br><br>Macross blew me away for one reason:<br><br> I fully expected the bland, forced romance with the designated heroine to be railroaded through to the end. It's the fucking norm after all.<br><br>But nope. Hikaru realizes he's in the friendzone and gets over it. Finally connects with his superior officer (who learns to deal with her own problems) and they fuck.</br></br> </br></br></br></br>  <br> happily for everyone <br>;_;<br><br>Also, I need my BD's but stupid Amurrica Subs hasn't released a new episode in a while.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it bad that I started singing the Getter Robo theme song during the opening credits?</br>  I clearly heard her say blueberry jam  fucking tell me this is an orange  <br><br>Fix it in aegisub.</br></br>  <br> he's never tasted an Appalachian blue orange <br><br>yankees pls go</br></br></br>  <br>This doesn't change the fact that Zhuge Liang up in Hong Kong tried to tell me that this was an orange</br>  How do I stop being a little girl enthusiast? I am not a lolicon but I tend to like little girl characters over more age appropriate character.  Why stop it? Just be happy with the way you are.  <br>Second</br>  Little girls are a miracle of the universe, embrace them.  <br> little girl <br>She's 80 odd years old by now anon.</br></br>  <br>It is a physical attraction to the body type and behaviors. There are plenty that are older.<br><br><br>I don't want to become a lolicon or a pedo.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you're really not a lolicon then it's just a phase that will eventually pass.</br></br>  The things I would do to her. That delicious body.  <br> am not a lolicon but <br>I have some bad news for you anon.</br></br>  <br><br> become lolicon <br> all of my friends now avoid me because they can read minds <br> lose my attraction to normal women because human sexuality only allows for liking one thing at a time <br> thought police break down my door and send me to jail <br><br>You're right OP, avoid it at all costs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If you have that image saved and don't think it's disgusting, you're already too far gone OP.  <br>How is it disgusting?</br>  <br>It is a nice picture. It is erotic without being dirty. It is well drawn so liking it doesn't make me a pedo. <br><br><br>I thought /a/ would be more sympathetic.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sexualized child/loli. I don't know my attraction is literal manchild tier, it hasn't changed since I was like 10-11.</br></br>  <br>Definitely too far gone</br>  <br>Because it's not Hibiki.</br>  <br><br> it's erotic <br> without making me a pedo <br><br>Paedophilia is the sexual attraction to children, your wording definitely makes you a Paedophile. Of course this is assuming 2d loli=child, which is some part incorrect. <br><br> You can argue that loli softcore isn't even sexual since they're children so they don't have their sex attributes, so only a pedo would find them sexually attractive. I know that's my excuse and it will shut them up due to the extreme stigma/fear around it. I just say it's cute, granted some of it is the actual reason why I have those saved </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hibiki is good, but Akatsuki is fine too.</br>  <br>/a/ is being sympathetic. What you need to hear and understand is that liking what you like and hurting other people are two different things and only one of those is wrong.</br>  <br><br>It's sympathy in the form of helping you realize why you're being silly.</br></br>  <br>Fapping to well drawn art doesn't make someone a pedo. Most people fap due to good art, not because it has body shapes x or y.<br><br><br><br>I don't want to be a lolicon and I want help in not becoming one. I imagine a lot of people on /a/ are in my situation too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with being a lolicon?</br>  <br><br>I like how you completely dodged it. Just accept you're already a lolicon, nothing wrong with that.</br></br>  <br>It is a crime and leads you to like heroines based off of one trait. <br><br><br>I am not a lolicon, I just happen to like little girls.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I am not a lolicon <br> I just happen to like little girls <br><br>But liking little girls makes you a lolicon.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> liking little girls in itself is a crime <br><br>Alright, he's baiting, we can all go home.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it leads to crime. I don't want to become a criminal.<br><br><br>fapping to loli makes you a lolicon. Liking good art that just happens to have loli in it doesn't.</br></br></br></br>  <br> It is a crime <br>Not until the thought police become an actual thing. Do avoid raping actual children though. If you think you'll have a hard time avoiding that, you should probably see a therapist.</br></br>  <br>No, it doesn't. It actually distracts your attraction to real little girls. Keep fapping to 2D and you will also lose any attraction to any 3D girls.</br>  <br>She's the best.</br>  <br> attraction to real little girls <br>I am not attracted to little girls and I am not attracted to anything 3D</br></br>  Why are people still replying when he saw  and brushed it off? It's bait, he's not going to listen.  <br>There you go. Then you're not a criminal. Case closed.</br>  <br>Stop posting pics like this in my thread. It really bothers me.<br><br><br>I am just saying becoming a lolicon is a slippery slope.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Slippery slope to what? Your blogging? Man, that's a serious case indeed.</br>      <br><br/></br>  <br> being ashamed of being a lolicon <br>I can at least tell you this: only non-lolicons think like that.<br>Ergo you are baiting.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Just like all those violent video games that are making the crime rate increase.</br>  <br><br><br>I said to stop posting loli<br><br><br>A slippery slope to becoming a stain on society. I don't want to be one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    What a roundabout way to ask for a loli thread.  <br>What a funny joke.

Post glasses loli please.  <br>Who cares. I don't like pedo or lolicon because of the implications of 3DPD and exclusivity, because I'm really just an overall pervert. Not gonna cry over being called one though. And you probably should have posted this in a loli related thread. This doesn't really seem worth having it's own thread.</br>    <br>Why is Akatsuki so fucking ugly?</br>  <br> is a slippery slope. <br>It certainly is, just like my dick a the moment.<br><br><br>Normies are the biggest stain on society and yet they are the majority.

Yeah that seems right.</br>  <br> How do I stop being a little girl enthusiast? <br>By becoming a full-fledged lolicon.</br></br>      <br>Dont start posting elin you little shit</br>  <br>my bad, picking at random</br>        <br> Why is that tummy so ticklable? <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br>This isn't how spats work but it's definitely how they should work.</br>  Curious to know, what is /a/'s thoughts on 3D CG lolis I mean, more'a'days now more 3DCG shows are popping up?<br>I'm talking about both the anime looking ones and more realistic looking ones, should they be banned? Do you support of free speech in that matter? Do you like it?</br>  <br>Why the hell should they be banned?<br>A well detailed 2D is always superior though.</br></br>  <br> the anime looking ones <br>They should not be banned.<br> more realistic looking ones <br>It's absurd to ban them because nobody gets hurt for creating them. I wouldn't mind if moralfags ban them, but then they'd have more leverage reason to ban unrealistic stuff too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Believe in your dick, OP. It's incapable of lying, and it's never been mistaken. Why would you doubt your dick?<br>And I just saw a Bane banner when appchan failed to load properly. When did we get new banners?</br></br>  <br>Banning is dumb, weeb-like styles &gt; realistic, but 2D is better anyways. That stuff that feels like it's in some sort of 2.5D is bretty gud tho.</br>  I like how lolis can still win here sometimes.  What is the best way to be a faggot  You guys are posting in a Pomf thread.  Perverts! Stop masturbating to me!  <br>Now I might be mistaken, but that looks like the face of someone who wants us masturbating to her.</br>  <br> that looks like the face of someone who wants us masturbating to her. <br><br>Die in a magazine fire.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't.

Little children are not lolis. They are 3D. Lolis are 2D.<br><br>inb4 Loli is derived from Lolita<br><br>Matters not. Its different context. Black is derived from the word Blanc which is describing White. Black = White. Words change over time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hebephilia is by definition normal as girls in the Hebe range can reproduce. Sex and by extension attractions that result in reproduction are always natural and should always be legal.</br>  <br> it's natural so it's okay! <br>Let me guess, atheist?</br></br>  <br>It's just some /co/ or /v/ poster that clicked on this thread because of the lewd OP.</br>  <br>Lolis are 2d abstractions of 3d girls, if you weren't a complete normie you'd know just how similar they can be.</br>  Bla bla bla.<br>If you lust after real living kiddo's, seek fucking help.<br>Otherwise, you're fine.</br></br>  <br>The difference is negligible.<br><br> Words change over time. <br>I'm pretty sure that japs dont differentiate between 2D and 3D when they call someone a "lolicon" though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not the same anon but as long as a girl has curves it's perfectly fine to feel attracted, yes. Being in a relationship with said girl although you're older? Not really, maybe in some rare cases.<br><br>We're talking 2D here. I'm lolicon myself but I've never felt attracted to kids. It's just drawings.<br><br>And what does atheist have anything to do with that? If you believe in stupid shits it's your problem stop forcing it on others.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey if impregnating a 12 year old girl is good enough for god it's good enough for me.</br>  <br> I'm pretty sure that japs dont differentiate between 2D and 3D when they call someone a "lolicon" though. <br>And that's fine, but he did mention context, and we're not japs.</br></br>  <br>  <br> Lolis are 2d abstractions of 3d girls, if you weren't a complete normie you'd know just how similar they can be. <br> muh abstractions <br><br><br>Normie japs don't differentiate. That's same with normie murricans as well. But in otaku circle, there is a clear difference between 2d and 3d.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No...its not normal. They are in EARLY stages of puberty, And its more dangerous to reproduce at that age. Hebe will always be looked at in a very very negative way.</br>  <br> Normie japs don't differentiate. That's same with normie murricans as well. But in otaku circle, there is a clear difference between 2d and 3d. <br>Interesting. You visit jap boards or something?</br></br>  <br>Why though? How is the age gap relevant ? The only thing that should matter is that it's consensual and that both parties are biologically ready.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128038078 <br>Anon please, let that guy enjoy his fetishes in peace, they're okay as long as he doesn't go out in the street and starts doing things to real little girls.  proved that he's a pure person.<br>I'd rather have him (AND ALL OF YOU) keep the 3D talk out of here though.<br><br>Now post some fuckin loliships and be khorosho to each other.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do you type like the kids I jack off to?</br>  <br>No offense but have you already been in a relationship? The age gap will matter no matter how mature you think the girl is. If it's just a sex-based relationship then so be it, it's fine, but in most cases, thus a romantic relationship, it'll most likely end up badly and impact the girl's life negatively.</br>  <br>no .they dun type like tht. Dey type lke this u kno?</br>  <br>Hebephilia has been normal and accepted for pretty much all of human history up until the 1950s. And yes it's early puberty but they can still reproduce which they wouldn't be able to if they weren't biologically meant to be able to.</br>  <br>I want to be in Inazuma's position and just start molesting Ikazuchi all day.</br>  It's not even about being safely able to reproduce or not in the end, it's about sexual attraction. You can't control that, it's NATURAL. I bet you anything you want most people complaining about lolicons aren't fully honest with themselves. If you aren't able to fap/getting aroused to this  or  then you're simply a faggot.  <br>None of those negative psychological effects are intrinsic though, they're extrinsic. It's not really the relationship thats to blame it's the society that surrounds it. In a society that accepted such relationships (see anything not within the last 60-70 years) such problems do not arise.</br>  <br> Hebephilia has been normal and accepted for pretty much all of human history up until the 1950s <br><br>Barely accepted. Hebe goes from 11-14. Even around that age of consent was generally around 14-16.</br></br></br>  <br>What is normal and what is natural are two different things, normal is whatever furthers the existence of the human race, natural is anything that arises from genetics, unnatural is anything learned.</br>  Can't we just post and appreciate lolis?<br>After all, we all do love them, right?</br>  <br>My point is that age 11-18 is really important in a person's life / psychological development. If the partner of said girl is 10y older the relationship will be uneven and the chances of negatively impacting her are really high. Now I am not saying it's right or wrong, I was just advancing a point, thus why I said "not really, maybe in some cases" earlier.<br><br>I am speaking from experience.<br><br><br>Yes, sorry.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, I hate that ugly shitskin.</br>  <br>For starters I meant to type 1940s secondly pretty much all premarital sex was shunned back then, what was more relevant were the lenient marriage laws. Pic related is from 1937.</br>    These little semen demons are the best thing to come out of Kancolle. I've lost track of how many times I've fapped to them.    <br>Yes. Sentiment is clearcut.</br>  <br>Your own negative experience are clearly coloring your views here. I'm still trying to find it but I remember reading a study that compared relationships between teenagers and relationships between teenagers and adults, the study found that there was no significant difference in internal strife or conflict in the relationships and that though the age gap relationships met with more external strife the younger partner rarely showed any signs of serious psychological scarring of anything else similar.</br>  When did /a/ become infested with lolicons?  <br>If you aren't a lolicon then you haven't been browsing /a/ long enough.</br>  <br>In 2003</br>  It's important that you cleanse the disgusting lolicon out of your body. <br><br>Here is a picture of best girl to help you.</br></br>  <br>Leave and take your shit taste with you.</br>  <br>Fuck you, how people don't see Nagato as best ship is beyond me. <br><br>Fucking faggot sack of shit.</br></br></br>  <br>She's a fucking slut.</br>  <br>The boobie Kancolles are good, but the Kancollolis are the best.</br>  <br>Sorry anon I couldn't hear you over all of these delicious lolis.</br>  <br>If she's such a slut why has she never worked your dick?</br>   I am not a lolicon <br> posts a cover to a loli eromanga <br>It's time to come to terms, OP</br></br>  <br><br>The 4chan of my day didn't have lolicons, neckbeards, or pedos.</br></br>  I really don't understand why you all get so worked up about it whenever one of these threads is deleted; considering they're, in essence, identical to the many threads that are also image dumps focused on a certain fetish wherein the only real discussion is about, in this case, how much you want to fug a loli, the various sexual things you'd do with a loli, and joking around about taking loving care of a loli- totally nothing sexual involved  wink wink .<br>Whenever those other threads get deleted, no one really complains because it's like, no shit, they were image dumps with with inherently, and often literally, masturbatory discussion, not really a big surprise. But if a single loli thread gets deleted, oh, then suddenly the mods are on some sort of anti-loli crusade again, and then loli threads start popping up with much greater frequency because whoever makes these threads seems to think that the best way to rebel is to do the exact thing you were punished for about 5 times harder than before.<br><br>Like, I honestly don't have anything against lolicons and I'm ambivalent towards lolis as a whole, I just don't understand. Yeah, I know for some this is some sort of half-baked way of bringing back /l/, but that was years ago, and is having some space to post the same images repeatedly and jack each other off available 24/7 really all that important?</br></br></br>  <br> he hasn't been here since 2002 </br>  <br>That's what you get for being a time traveler and coming here from 2020.</br>  <br>Because I don't look at sluts.</br>  <br>It is just well drawn.

If it has lolis in it then so be it, that doesn't make you a lolicon. <br><br>False flaggers are trying to equate being a little girl enthusiast with being a lolicon now?</br></br></br>  Lolicons are just pedos too beta to accept their feelings.  <br>What strange dimension are you from or are you sure you weren't trying to spell "reddit"?</br>  <br><br> Being sexually attracted to good art regardless of the content <br><br>There is probably a special circle in hell for you too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Many actually are.

In a row too?! Don't you worry about your heart or getting a stroke? I personally have fainted during my 2nd time in the bath tub.</br>  What are the chances that accel has already fucked the original?  Considering he's impotent?<br>Well, maybe he used a strap-on.</br>  This pairing has more chances of happening than Kamikoto if nt13 spoilers are to be believed. And I'm totally okay with it.  <br>To add to this thought, even if it isn't romantic or even a good end (ie Accelerator dies protecting her/the clones) I see Accelerator being far more involved with ALL of the Misakas' conclusion than Touma.</br>  <br> chances of happening <br>It already happened</br></br>  <br>I guess you could say that but I'm talking outside Othinus fucking with the world. It honestly makes more sense than her ending up with Touma</br>  Can we start officially supporting this pairing without being called a crack shipper or troll now? Can that happen if the NT13 spoilers are confirmed true?  <br>AccelxLO OTP</br>  <br>That's cute too but I also like this pairing</br>  <br>Forgot everything about that volume what exactly happened in one of the worlds with them?</br>  <br> What spoilers? </br>  <br>[spoilers] Mikoto gets depressed because she was called a burden to Touma and feels an incredible sense of distance fro him. She goes back to her dorm quietly. Most people think she's accepted she won't win Touma</br>  <br>Accelerator saved all the clones and they were seen close together and assumed to be close friends or lovers</br>  <br>mayonegg edit?</br>  <br>Accel was basically her Touma in the perfect world since he was the one that saved the clones</br>   yfw this pairing would make Touma happy because it would ease some of his Othinus trauma   <br> Accel says something cheeky towards misaka  <br> misaka gets annoyed and fires a railgun out of reflex <br> this time her railgun gets reflected right back at her and she dies </br></br></br>  <br> Most people think she's accepted she won't win Touma <br>With just this? People sure like to troll</br></br>  <br>Yeah, no. The comedy scenes would turn into Accelerator reflecting her attacks away and destroying shit, making the joke "That damn Level 5 couple is a property liability"</br>  <br>But it really does seem that way, unless the spoilers are wrong but the illustrations and photos of text seem to confirm them as legit</br>  <br>But this is the real OTP.</br>  <br> i-it is not like I wanted to hit you or anything BAKA  <br> tsk. D-don't think I was trying to protect you, next time I'll reflect those back at you </br></br>  <br>If there's no way Accelerator can't have one of the Misakas I'd accept this, too. Although I'm sure she prefers Hamazura</br>  <br>Nah they are bros</br>  Accelerator x Mikoto best hate sex.  <br>Not gonna lie him dealing with misaka's bs would be amusing.</br>  <br>Yes. At some point it'd stop being hate sex because they'd enjoy it so much.</br>  <br>Team up again fucking when?</br>  <br>Crazy don't go well with crazy</br>  <br>Accel is probably already sick of all these misaka's.</br>  <br> implying he hasn't developed feelings for all the Misakas and he doesn't know what it means or what to do with it </br>  Still waiting for that moment where Accelerator saves Mikoto, Kamachi.   mikoto is a narutard <br>truly worst misaka</br>  <br>This. <br><br> she gets gravely injured <br> Accelerator is nearby, sees it, flips his shit because it reminds him of the Sisters Project and saves her <br> Mikoto's worldview is flipped upside down  <br><br>Make it happen Kamachi</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mikoto's worldview is flipped upside down <br>More like we get two tsundere tsuntsun at each other</br></br>  <br><br> She goes back to her dorm quietly. <br><br>Is this near the end? It sounds ridiculous to have it happen in the middle but when Magic Gods you never know.<br><br>I mean even scrub magicians have a spell to get people like her away.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But misaka too strong to get harmed in AC.</br>  <br> I mean even scrub magicians have a spell to get people like her away <br><br>If they're quick enough to cast it m8.</br></br></br>  <br>They make the cutest couple</br>  <br>Well he already had a taste of her meat so anything is possible.</br>  Am I the only one?<br>To be honest the manga hints this alot.</br>  <br>She's probably dead in the current index timeline.</br>  Wouldn't Misaka working her way into Accel's life sorta make fucked up sense?<br><br>He's already got Last Order and Worst. At this point he may as well complete the set and get the OG.</br></br>  <br>Considering Accelerator's powers would make him amazing in bed, probably not.<br><br>She still shows interest in other people.</br></br></br>  <br>I know, it just feels like she's gonna die, probably sacrifice herself for some bullshit.<br>I really like her though, and she may be the first girl other than LO to actually worry for Accelerator's well being, and their interactions are cute.</br></br>  <br><br>Taped a popsicle sticks to his dick.</br></br>  <br><br>Sure, it's not like Touma will complain.</br></br>  Zero.  <br>Touma's harem is already big enough He doesn't need Misaka up in his shit. <br><br>It would also spread the Level 5's around the protagonists with Meltdowner/HAMAZUUUURRRAAAA, Mental Out/Touma and Accel/Misaka and Guts/Supremacy of the military court.</br></br></br>  <br>Her powers would make her pretty good in bed too. The two of them fucking would be out of this world sex</br>  <br>That's pretty much what everyone is saying. It would make more sense than her getting with Touma. I have a feeling Touma would cheer them on.</br>  <br> mikoto  <br> losing a fight </br></br>  <br> Mental Out/Touma </br>  <br>let's be real here we don't know where that would have gone had the mind wipe thing hadn't happened</br>   shipping shitsaka with accel <br><br>Disgusting.</br></br>  <br>It would make her a better character. Even Touma would agree</br>  <br> but the illustrations <br>Which one?<br> She goes back to her dorm quietly.

His nickname is Thunder Rod and he will spend a week training with Thor and Uncle Touma in the harsh lands of northern Sweden. <br><br>Their daughter would be a chuuni edgelord. She'd be Terrorist Outfit Biribiri with Accelerator's mad kekekekekeke'ing and plasma generating. Also she wears spats beneath her skirt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cute as fuck</br>  <br><br>We don't know what his actual hair color is.

S2 wasn't stale at all, aside form the 3 shit episodes</br>  <br>I thought it started strongly but ended up as "ugh I'm so gay" and "ugh I wanna fuck Shino" jokes over and over. I guess the whole series had been like that, but I suppose I'm a bit tired of it is all.</br>  <br>The last episode was shit because of that, but it didn't get stale towards the end. The beach episode was the best, or the childhood karen and alice one</br>  I'm willing to bet if anyone currently browsing /a/ made a top 10 list of their favourite anime series, at least half of it would be from the last five years.

They need to shake it up a bit. I liked how they added some new characters, Kuzehashi especially (great dynamics with Karen, my highlight of the season), but in the end her and Honoka ended up having the same old gay shtick as Aya and Yoko or Alice and Shino.

His name is muhammed, according to the brittish tradition.</br>    <br>2004-2008 was objectively the golden age of anime, prove me wrong</br>  what is name of show in OP's post    <br>Kiniro Mosaic</br>  <br> kin-iro <br> not knowing japanese <br> /a/ <br/></br></br></br>    <br>kirino Puzzle</br>  <br> Kirino </br>  <br>We are living in the dark age for lolicons.<br>But it will get even darker.</br></br>    <br> fucking underrated post </br>  <br> implying I don't know Japanese <br>Kinpatsu or whatever the fuck they called it.<br>Either way the show was shit, Kuzehashi was wasted on this trash. Glad that is over, season 3 never.</br></br></br>  <br>Why did you even watch it if you hate it so much?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128076789 <br>delet this</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128076789 <br>Watch your language.</br>  It's not out of the question that a golden age could happen in the future, but not now no.<br><br>2006-2007 alone has been better that the past 8 years of anime that succeeded it.</br></br>  <br><br>This.<br><br>Seriously guys, how can anyone say unironically that this is golden age of anime? Fucking moe shitters.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Absolutely fucking not. So much moe and low cost slice of life and even more half arsed novel adaptations to never be finished than I previously remember.<br><br>granted those have always been around but it seems to be a higher ratio.</br></br></br>  <br> 2007 was 8 years ago <br>I want to get off this ride</br></br>  <br>Coincidentally 2007 and the advent of Lucky Star was when I gave up on it for a long time.</br>  <br>There are no brakes on this ride, anon.</br>  <br><br>It's because it's been inserted everywhere.<br><br>People make the mistake in thinking that 'moeshit' is the problem, but they're only half right. Cute series have always existed, but cute series in the past had their own original storylines and characters which weren't just based on tired templates.<br><br>People love to make generalizations about this sort of thing, but compare cute shows like Wandaba Style, Bottle Fairies, Di Gi Charat, Risky Safety, Galaxy Angel or Nuku Nuku to cute series of today. Underneath the cute exterior they were legitimately good anime with interesting premises or healthy doses of good comedy, yet what we have now always follows the same patterns, the girls are always boring templates of shit we've already seen and the shows always end up as high school slice of life even if the premise was something completely different.<br><br>And other genres are guilty of it too, they're so creatively drained that the only ideas they can come up with are simply colliding two genres together. It's rare you get a series that's purely sci-fi or purely mecha: Instead they try and fuse sci-fi with slice of life, mecha with harem, so on and so forth.<br><br>I'm not saying all anime now is shit, but the series I enjoy are the ones that never try and tack anything extra onto what they already are. They don't use the same overdone templates of character design, art style, personalities or comedy. Unfortunately they're far and few between and you have to step outside of your ideal genre to view them.<br><br>tl;dr - Moe isn't the problem. Shitty anime is the problem. Moe just serves as an automatic Get Out of Jail Free card for anyone who isn't creative or talented enough to make a decent anime. I would love an actually decent cute anime series but instead I find myself watching sports series I wouldn't normally bother with purely because it doesn't feel like someone randomized the past 5 years of anime and packaged it off as something new.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'd say it has been in its current phase for nearly a decade now. People might want to separate things between 10s and 00s anime but really things changed a lot in about 2006 onward. By 2008 we were already in a post Lucky Star, K-on, Hidamari Sketch world so it is stupid to say moe caught on past 2010. <br><br>As it stands I think the things most likely to fizzle out and pass on in relevance is the trend of shitty LN adaptations of magic battle school psuedo harem shit. We will still see a lot of moe and attempts to be the next Madoka in coming years. <br><br>A well done show is a well done show regardless of its themes or genres, it shouldn't matter what is trendy or not relative to good writing/directing/voice work. To mandate that it must be Western pandering manime or some shit to be good is a narrow minded focus; fear of moe shows dominating is immaturity/insecure xenophobia.</br></br></br></br>  <br>you just posted the brakes</br>  <br>More like the end of the tracks.</br>  <br>There's no point of going to a show where everyone is a lesbian, try other one.</br>  <br>Card Captor Sakura could also go there too.<br><br>Mind you I swore off LN adaptations and so far it's reduced the amount of anime I watch by 1/3. <br><br>Then there's avoiding the cute stuff that quite frankly I find insulting to the intelligence, humour anime is very hit and miss. <br><br>I cite Lucky Star because it referenced Haruhi so much anyone watching it now may be asking "How is this funny?" or worse "Is it a reference to that Yuki Nagato anime?".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>CSS was a Mahou Shoujo, I don't think it's the right comparison to make as the audience was different.<br><br>I still enjoy Lucky Star and I think the characters have a lot more personality than others you see today. Lucky Star was more like a group of actual school friends as opposed to K-ON which was more like idealized school life.<br><br>I feel that there is always a strong sense of tongue-in-cheek humor with Lucky Star, but you rarely see that now.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> all anime is shit <br>OK. Just stop watching it.</br></br>  <br> riots and barbarians <br>Sounds like America and its niggers to me.</br></br>  No the golden age was 1994-2002<br><br>This is the silver age<br><br>But with the appropriate additions it could very easily become the golden age</br></br></br></br>  <br> compare cute shows like Wandaba Style, Bottle Fairies, Di Gi Charat, Risky Safety, Galaxy Angel or Nuku Nuku <br>These are all mediocre shows aside from Galaxy Angel with the same shallowness that most moe shows have today. There's just less yuri baiting</br></br>  <br>I actually really want a movie, where in the end Alice and Karen move to England with Shino and Aya and Yoko settle down and get maried and adopt a couple kids, and that teacher with the track suit dies and best sensei is the only sensei we see</br>  <br>Why did you post some jew reaction face anon.</br>  <br> These are all mediocre shows <br><br>Confirmed for not watching</br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget about Honoka</br>  <br>Worse part it is watching Lucky Star it seemed like I was looking at pandering. I should rewatch and see if it was just me being sick of anime at the time.<br><br>K-On looks so sterile and safe, is it as bland as it looks? I understand it's Tea&gt; Keiki &gt; Little bit of music.</br></br></br>  <br>It's just not good anime hombre</br>  <br>Right, she ends up owning her parents Restaurant (Obviously this is all post graduation) And makes fucking bank then opens up a new shop in England and sometimes shes there stalking the shit out of various blondes with Shino and sometimes shes in Japan hanging out with Yoko and Aya</br>  <br>Moe =/= SoL =/= cute which is what you're implying. <br>You seem to be talking about SoL when saying they always follow the same pattern. CGDCT maybe more popular now, but it's not full of boring templates of shit at all. We get a lot of varied settings. You seem to overrating those mediocre shows, Bottle Fairies especially. That shit is bad.</br></br>  <br> CGDCT maybe more popular now, but it's not full of boring templates of shit at all <br><br>How many anime have you watched? I'm going to guess it's not at least 1000. Try watching a decent amount of anime before you make generalizations like that. Bottle Fairy has far more depth than just about any modern equivalent it has.</br></br></br>  <br> K-On looks so sterile and safe, is it as bland as it looks? I understand it's Tea&gt; Keiki &gt; Little bit of music. <br>Yes it is. And that's what it's trying to be.<br>K-on is incredibly comfy, the epitome of escapism.</br></br></br>  <br>why are you such a cunt and do this every time?</br>  Why won't ZUN let ufotable make a Touhou anime?  <br> enjoyable difficulty curve <br>That's one of the best things of DDC and LoLK.</br></br>  <br>Which Touhou doujin is considered the best?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jAd<wbr>iiLLCqhM</wbr>  [ ]<br> Rumia-nee will never be your onee-chan </br></br>  <br>Personal fave<br> http://exhentai.org/g/754753/2707ec<wbr>5fad/</wbr> </br></br>  <br>I don't think any doujin is really "considered" the best.
