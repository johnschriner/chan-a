[ Chinpo Kitan: Ass of Laplace thread<br>New episode soon</br>  Oh yeah, I'm ready for more delicious trap ass<br>Oh, and mysteries or whatever, I guess</br>  <br>stop trying to make me fap to 2d traps japan</br>  jesus, this took awhile to make  <br>It hurts  my dick  that his picture is actually canon.</br>  Is this even good, plot-wise?  <br><br>its sort of comfy and mysterious i cant describe really.</br></br>  Imouto appeared<br><br><br>Not really.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd say it's mediocre, but if you like traps and NTR, that bumps it up to something you'll look forward to every week.</br>  <br> Imouto appeared <br><br>She's not going to die, is she?</br></br></br>  <br>whose?</br>  I am the sexiest.  <br>heheheheh</br>  <br><br>He should have fucked her while she was alive</br></br>  WHY DID I WATCH THIS<br>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA FUUUUUUUUUUUCKKKK I AM SOOOOO ANGRYYYYY AARRRRRRRRRHGGGGGGG</br>  This is actually touching a social issue in Japan. I was kinda blown away to see that theme discussed at all.<br><br>Fuck this "Shikata ga nai" culture, though.</br></br>  Heavy episode, Apart from killing the other people I think most people would kill the murderer if they killed your sister, I know I would.<br><br>Did the right thing, Also this ED is so fucking good.<br><br> No Kobayashi. <br>Aww man.</br></br></br></br></br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/uwjfouixrv.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  <br>Wait what? Kagami is suddenly a killer?</br>  I had a feeling Shadow Man would become 20 faces.<br><br>A true hero.</br></br>  <br>Did you not watch episode 4?</br>  Fucking hell, that was some nice music at the end. Pretty good episode, though I think it was a bit rushed and could have been better as two separate episodes. Poor Kagami keiji...  Nobody cared who I was until I put on the mask  but how did he know where kagami lived?<br><br>how did he even know he had a sister or what she looked like???</br></br>  <br>Superintendent is a public figure, I wouldn't be surprised if his information was public.</br>  Is criminal justice really that fucking bad in Japan?  So was he supposed to be the bad guy? So far he was the only character that actually cared in the show.  Good episode. Of course we all knew what the story was going to be by the first couple of minutes, but it was still pretty well executed.<br><br>Also, reminder that there's an Edogawa Rampo book in the goddess that includes The Caterpillar. The story is quite more fucked up than the episode though. It's kind of the story of someone who suffers the same fate as Sunaga, from his perspective.</br></br>  <br>Go download Confessions of a Dog.<br><br>Right now. I think there's freeleech in asiatorrents.<br><br>tl:dr:  Yeah, and much worse: rampant with corruption and yakuza influence </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course no. The anime exaggerates it strongly, probably in order to make a point. Kind of like how 1984 exaggerates all the dystopian elements related to the government, society, etc.</br>  <br>Depends on how you define "bad".<br><br>But he was definitely overstepping his bounds. Pic related.</br></br></br>  <br>He was a good guy, but still a criminal that killed people.<br><br>So he's a good guy, but deserved to be in jail.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I don't know which to trust.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw guys responsible for the concrete girl incident got off relatively scot-free </br>  <br>In America the cops kill criminals, and people throw a fit and say they shouldn't kill the criminals, not realizing that the direct effect of that is what happens in Japan.</br>  <br>Again, go watch Confessions of a Dog.<br><br>It's based on a real journalistic investigation spanning years on the corruption of the japanese police (though it also details some of its frustrations, as shown in this episode), and it IS true that it got censored in Japan.<br><br>It's also by the director of GOTH.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>... Fuck Japan.</br>  <br><br>And don't forget he reincided<br> For his participation in the crime, Kamisaku served eight years in a juvenile prison before he was released, in August 1999. In July 2004, he was arrested for assaulting an acquaintance, whom he believed to be luring a girlfriend away from him, and allegedly bragged about his earlier infamy. </br></br></br>  <br>Most developed countries in the world don't kill criminals and most of them are safer than America.<br><br>The problem with Japan is the rampant corruption, not letting the criminals live.</br></br></br>  <br>The issue is not cops being unable to kill criminals, as depicted here the issues is the criminals never even going to trial. The death penalty is a different story.<br><br><br>I'll look into it another time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm just saying, if Kagami actually decided to pull out his pistol and blow snake tongue's brains out, he would have gotten to eat cake with his sister</br>  <br>In Jail over the phone.</br>  <br>With Japanese corruption and his partner being a bro, I'm sure he could've passed it as him resisting the arrest.</br>  <br>He would have been in jail and wouldn't have gotten to eat cake with his sister.<br><br>He'd still have a sister though.<br><br>But still, he was a cop. You can't just have cops killing people like that. And no, all the recent niggers like Baby Traytray or Mike the Gentle Giant Brown were killed in self-defense. They don't count. Not to mention the suicidal negress.<br><br>Now, if Sunaga had attacked Kagami, he would have had a legal right to protect himself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe in the US. Japan doesn't have the same laws.</br>  <br>Seriously, go watch Confessions of a Dog.<br><br>Cops in japan get a revolver, and are allowed to use it as long as they're protecting themselves.</br></br></br>   releasing crazy people <br>seriously japan?<br>what's up with the weak plot in this show?</br></br>  <br>The show is actually about boibutt and boipussy.</br>  <br>does he have chronic ulcer?</br>  <br>see  </br>  <br>That's happens everywhere where death sentence isn't an option</br>  <br>When does the full op come out?</br>  <br>Pretty sure she's the reason he became a killer.</br>  <br>19th of August</br>  <br>Where did you find those jap subs?<br>Looking for them for a while</br></br>  <br>Isn't there a cannibal living freely too?</br>  <br>Thanks anon.</br>  <br>Yeah, the dude who ate a girl in France and got famous when he got back to Japan for getting out scott free.<br><br>I saw a documentary on him once... he wrote a book, made an illustration book, and even appeared in some strange AV where a girl had to live with him for like a week or something like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, though to be honest, that was more of a fuckup on France or whatever country that was. Japan didn't really give a fuck because the victim wasn't japanese, and the crime wasn't commited in japan.</br>  <br> almost drop after first episode <br> continue watching because trap shenanigans  <br> feel like shit 3 weeks in a row now after finishing <br>I hate it<br><br><br>Less weak plot, more weak writing.<br><br><br>Except the death sentence and all that IS an option in Japan. There was an execution just over a month ago.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murde<wbr>r_of_Rie_Isogai<br><br>The thing is, and I generally believe in rehabilitation over punishment for criminals, the death sentence or life in prison isn't given out nearly enough for violent crimes. You get Breivik, who killed 77 people, living a rather cushty life in prison instead of getting capital punishment, like he pretty much undoubtedly deserves. The justice system is undeniably fucked up everywhere, and there's no right way of going about things that will please everyone.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's only worth watching if you have read a few Akechi stories.<br>Which in turn are only worth reading if you are familiar with the mystery genre.</br></br>  The episode make me feel bad from the beginning because it was obvious what would happen to the imouto. At least the fatass got punished.  <br>Got some you could link us?<br><br>Only Rampo book I've been able to pirate was Japanese Tales of Mystery and Imagination, and it doesn't have anything Boy Detectives Club-related. But apparently, The Boy Detectives Club, The Early Cases of Akechi Kogoro and The Fiend with Twenty Faces have been published in english.</br></br></br>  <br>It's on IRC.</br>  <br>Channel?</br>  Dame da, zenzen dame da.  Imouto's destiny was so predictable.  <br>didnt make it any less brutal ;_;</br>  Wait, how much time passed since the first episode and this one? Since he was talking with imouto on the phone until recently, right? Why weren't we informed of imouto's death when it actually happened?<br><br>Also people getting out of mental hospital in only a short while after killing several lolis? This is some absurd logic and it kind of annoys me.</br></br>  <br>Indeed, fuck this shit ;_;</br>  <br>Well, fuck.<br><br>Decided to search again, and I found The Early Cases of Akechi Kogoro. On google though, not on IRC though. That adventure only provided 10 copies of Japanese Tales of Mystery and Imagination.<br><br>So yeah, just uploaded The Early Cases of Akechi Kogoro to the goddess, so get it wile it's hot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>apparently you can get away with a lot of shit in japan<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issei<wbr>_Sagawa</wbr></br></br>  <br><br>What the actual fuck</br></br>  <br> Wait, how much time passed since the first episode and this one? Since he was talking with imouto on the phone until recently, right? <br>like 1-2 weeks before ep4<br><br> Why weren't we informed of imouto's death when it actually happened? <br>Rewatch ep4, you can see him acting different from usual, and receiving various concerns from his colleagues</br></br></br></br></br>  No ass this week, only more rage and sadness  <br> like 1-2 weeks before ep4 <br>By that I mean his imouto's murder, not ep1</br></br>  <br>What the fuck. How. This is really fucked up.<br><br><br>I see. Thanks.</br></br></br></br>  Did this show turn into Hotline Miami at the end because wow<br><br>I know this show exaggerates how incompetent the Japanese police are (very slightly) but goddamn if it leads to a rash of violent murders involving escaped evidenced convicted criminals this will be supremely my shit and the cute boy being excited about all that blood is a cherry on top<br><br><br>he's a hobo now, happy end!!!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> be a policeman  <br> be a BR policeman <br> criminals are made of sand, can't hold or hurt 70% of the fuckers you arrest <br><br>l shouldn't have watched this episode, it just ruined my day, it was not the "good pain".</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;be a BR <br>Stay away from Tree of Savior</br></br>  <br>How the fuck you are still alive?</br>  So someone tell me, is this supposed to be light-hearted or are they trying and failing to be serious?<br><br>I mean, we have all those gruesome deaths of likable characters and all those unbelievably cruel murder methods employed by absolute monsters.<br><br>On the other hand, we have that cwazee M.E. and Corpsey, the artsy bullshit and Kobayashi's ass.<br>Not to mention all those tweeests you can see coming from a mile away.<br><br>I'm honestly confused. And just to add to that, this episode had so little Kobayashi that I can't even lean back and enjoy trappy goodness.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This is why I don't like the trap. You think this shit is fun? You think this is a game? No, man. This shit is all pain and anger. Don't misunderstand, I still want to put my penis in its butt.  Good End  Japan has problems with the criminal system due to rampant corruption and a stagnant structure based around the idea of "punishing criminals" while expecting them in most cases to turn themselves in due to their guilt issues rather than actual detective work done by their cops (which are so tied limited in their freedom of action so they cannot also prosecute rampant corruption that it's ridiculous to expect them to be anything but glorified burocrats doing paperwork).<br><br><br>The US on the other hand is the prime example of what happens when you let your Police do ANYTHING they want.<br><br>Both extremes are bound to cause more troubles than they are solving yet to the masses seem perfectly sound (Japan by showing their "low crime rates" and the US by showing toughness on crime).<br><br><br>Not to say that Europe is perfect (and basically a microcosm, you cannot compare Italy and Greece to Germany and Finland) but as general rule you don't see those two extremes there with trigger-happy policemen shooting and/or robbing people on the streets (sorry, "civil forfeiture" is the politically correct word) for not being impressed by a bunch of overweight donut-eaters with a badge nor do you see them being just a bunch of glorified cosplayers that happen to have a license to use live guns they probably don't even know how to use properly</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean "bad end for everybody".<br><br>... that is, everybody other than Kobayashi.</br></br></br>  <br>So are you one of those that takes bribes or that needs to bribe the criminals to not get fired?</br>  <br>That scene is a few neon lights away from going full Hotline Miami</br>  <br>With so much horrible shit and suffering happening, it's quite easy to forget about the trap, even though l started watching it for him, didn't expect real world bullshit to invade my anime and disturb me so much.</br>  This kind of anime and gore kinda reminds me of a certain despair crime solving video game.  <br> ... that is, everybody other than Kobayashi. <br>You don't kill the trap of the golden eggs (金玉)</br></br>  <br>No, I mean, it was a good end, but just for Kobayashi, who got another day of thrills.<br><br>It was a shit end for everybody else.</br></br></br>  <br>Welcome to Noitamina.<br><br>Enjoy the slow descent into despair.</br></br></br>  <br> So someone tell me, is this supposed to be light-hearted or are they trying and failing to be serious? <br>It's actually an awareness campaign to bring light about Japan's jurisdiction</br></br>  <br>Nah, would much rather have seen him tossed into that giant meat grinder. This was harmless. I mean, Kagami had style at least. Dissolving limbs in acid and them slowly killing via chemicals? That's prime nightmare fuel murder right there.<br><br>Though  Loli-bro getting his revenge was hella sweet anyway .</br></br></br>  <br>That... would make a lot of sense actually. That would explain how nobody except the mourners take shit seriously.</br>  <br>It was the loli's dad, not the paper bag dude.</br>  Raged hard.<br>Fuck this show, episode 2 hit me hard, but now this shit? <br>Kagami did nothing wrong.</br></br>  This hit me a lot harder than Episode 3. You don't kill a man's imouto.  <br> The former hell, dollar is almost 4 reals over here, and we're basically being feed on peanuts.</br>  <br>That's nice, I love peanuts.</br>  <br>Lived long enough in Latin America to know some of the inofficial rules.<br><br>At least you are not in Honduras.<br><br>You need to pay "mordidas" to different gangs at each 4th street or you're dead next morning.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This time it was more personal than kagami and his justice</br>  <br> Honduras <br><br>Oh, l just operate on Curitiba, aside from the petty criminals who for no reason shit themselves at the sight of a policeman and end up dropping loot and the occasional northerners, it's quite tame over here.</br></br></br>  KAGAMI DID NOTHING WRONG  I'm just here for the ass. This is not allowed to make me sad  ;_;   <br>Is this medically accurate?</br>  This whole thing hit way too close to home, I didn't expect these feelings from a Game of Laplass<br>Maybe I should go back to my cute girl chinese cartoons</br>  <br>Did your imouto get murdered anon?</br>  <br>He's the guy that murdered someone's imouto and got away scot free</br>  So how does it compare to the shadowman episode? Gotta prepare my heart before watching  I don't remember the last time anime made me feel mad but these last two episodes have been pure rage fuel, fuck this shit.  <br>A lot worse.</br>  <br>Reminder that Europe has based Scotland Yard with literally the best detectives in the world. Hell, all the Japanese motobike cops they love so much get trained in Hendon by the English.</br>    I don't know if I can take this shit anymore. I'm seriously considering dropping this show because it's just too damn sad, not to mention it makes no sense  <br>It makes a lot of sense you dumdum.</br>  <br> A lot worse. <br>ahh damn, just came for the trap butt not suffering.</br></br>  <br>No, just live in a corrupt shithole where criminals are left free to do as they please. Thankfully no one in my family has been affected but I know lots of people who haven't been so lucky</br>  <br>I wanted to watch it before Gakkou Gurashi because if I watched it before going to sleep, I'd just get extremely upset and not be able to sleep. It backfired, since it's been an hour and a half since I finished it and now I'm too upset to even watch Gakkou Gurashi. I suppose I'll rewatch the last ep of NNB afterwards.<br><br>Today's been absolutely saddening for me, first Oyakodon Made With a Golden Egg and now this. <br><br>I just want to protect their smiles, why do innocent imoutos and lolis have to suffer? ;_:</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why don't you save everyone, just put on the mask.</br>  <br> justice system is actually so ludicrously flawed that a child could see there's something wrong <br> character takes justice into their own hands <br> suddenly he's portrayed as the bad guy and condemned to death <br> and literally nothing is ever done to change the system <br>this story would have made a lot more sense in, say, Japan a hundred years ago</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> based on Edogawa Ranpo´s novels <br> expect happy end moeshit anime. </br></br>  <br>I don't think he's 'portrayed as the bad guy' at all. Yes, he gets condemned, and yes, he's a criminal, but he's made as sympathetic as possible in this episode.</br>  <br> as the bad guy <br>Are you drunk?</br></br>  <br> &gt;suddenly he's portrayed as the bad guy <br>But he's portrayed as the good guy by not cheating the system like all the criminals and chose to go down like a man.</br></br>  <br>He knows he is a criminal that broke the law but he isn't seen as a bad guy</br>  <br>Because I don't want to die, bruh</br>  <br>I'm okay with sad anime that makes sense. Like maybe a kid gets cancer, or a murder happens. But an anime that purposely goes out of its way to make me mad by having the same annoying fatass killing all these characters is just taking it too far.</br>   He was released yet again <br> You faggots didn't believe me </br>  <br>Oh boy, you're in for another fun ride with Gakkou then.<br><br>Mr. bones will never leave.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Akechi and the bent over guy certainly seemed to think he had done something wrong. Kind of weird that these public safety officials haven't even considered trying to change the law that lets one guy kill like twenty people and let go every time.</br></br></br>  Shitty Nippon police didn´t protect this smile.  <br>He did do wrong, he became a criminal.</br>  This shit isn't even half as bad or enraging as some other anime out there.<br>You're at lightweight, or you watch too much moe stuff where nothing happens that any sense of danger or drama makes you have a kneejerk reaction.</br>    basically Red Hood   <br>Because taking the justice in your hands is a bad thing in almost every culture you dummy.<br><br> Kind of weird that these public safety officials haven't even considered trying to change the law <br>Where the heck do you live? It sounds amazing if the officers have a word in the important issues.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's alright now, he turned into an armpit-fag</br>  <br>It is going too fast for me so I don't really care.</br>   Limbs can't flutter like that in the wind <br> Oh <br> Oh... </br></br>  RIP  What is the point of this show? I don't get what the message is or what it wants to be about. The random ass shots of a middle school student are also confusing. Does this show want to be taken seriously or not?  <br>It's about how the Japanese law is so full of shit, also homoerotic stuff.</br>  <br>Who even was this guy? They way thet were talking about him made it seem like it was the fat guy. Admittedly though I wasn't paying attention because of how boring this episode was</br>  <br>The guy he arrested earlier in the episode and almost shot</br>  <br>The dude who killed his sister who was also the lizard looking dude he arrested</br>  <br><br>It's like the ADHD crowd back from the UNGO threads</br></br>  <br><br>Jesus, I just finished watching the episode and I forgot he even existed, I thought that fat guy's name was Suruga</br></br>  Does anyone know the name of the song that was playing before the end credits? Searching for the title on the record drew a blank.  <br>Pay attention anon.</br>  <br>Dindu Nuffin.</br>  <br> They didn't even need to go to that lady thief who pisses herself in the first place. </br>  Why are they killing all the moe?<br>What did they do?</br>  <br>He was only released once, 20 was reading on the phone that 5/4 released suspects have been rearrested and the fifth was wanted. He was the fifth.</br>  <br>Where is the goddess?</br>  <br>But didn't he say in the interrogation scene that he had already charged and released before because he was declared mentally ill?</br>  I feel like the show is going too far out of its way to demonize criminals as whacky mass murderers. <br>Would be cooler if it had shades of grey instead of<br>EVERYTHING IS FUCKED VIGILANTE GUY IS BEST</br></br>  <br> They capture him before the show <br> They release him before the show <br> They capture him in episode 3 <br> They release him <br> They capture him again in episode 4 <br> He's walking on the streets in episode 5 </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't get that impression when the MC talks about criminal activity like it's a "game" and this is all "fun".</br>  <br>She gave him info on the real one</br>  <br>MC is crazy as fuck, Why would you believe him?</br>  <br> Why are they killing all the moe? <br> What did they do? <br><br>Refrigerated moe doesn't sit well at all</br></br></br></br>  <br>He is truthful about his opinion as far as we can tell. Why should I not believe him? If this wants to be a serious show about how shitty japanese law enforcement is maybe they shouldn't have a kid who treats it all like a game as the main character.</br>  <br>It's one of the points anon, he's right in everything but the moral part of the show, and that's where other characters like the dude with the glasses enter into play.</br>  Just watched. Holy shit, I'm a mix of raging and emotionally drained as fuck. Shit was fucked up.<br>The worst part is that the outcome was so obvious and it still hits you like a truck. Goddamnit.</br>  <br> &gt;They release him <br> &gt;They capture him again in episode 4 <br> &gt;He's walking on the streets in episode 5 <br>That's not what happened. They let him out to bait Kagami. They were rearresting all of them at the end of the episode.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If they arrested Kagami there, why did they not arrest the fat fuck?<br>He must've been released</br></br>  <br>It's pretty obvious that this show doesn't exist in the real universe. They just made up a bunch of bullshit rules for this universe's law enforcement and then used them to justify people getting killed over and over</br>  <br>What narrative purpose does Akechi being a high school kid even serve? He just seems like an obnoxious Mary Sue wish fulfillment faggot.</br>  <br>Probably has to do with for whatever reason the surveillance let the guy get killed</br>  <br>A messed up justice system is always a sad setting.</br>  I wanted Kagami to be trialed as mentally insane.<br>Just to make him suffer more.<br>A big fuck you.</br></br>  <br> heavily implied that imouto got her limbs melted/mutilated and her eyes gouged out while still alive <br> suffering torso imouto dies on the rope from asphyxiation  <br>FUCK THIS SHOW<br>KAGAMI DINDU NUFFIN</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then he would be out killing their clients.</br>  <br> The worst part is that the outcome was so obvious and it still hits you like a truck. <br><br><br> yeah, it's so obvious that imouto will die <br> just get it over with already <br> wait, this shit is so freaking obvious, it's a bait <br> yeah, imouto won't die <br> Kagami will barely save her <br> imouto is ded <br><br>Fuck this shit. Japan get your shit straight, deal with your crimes. I don't need dead imouto's and otoutos.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is true that Japanese criminal prosecutors will drop a case if they feel that they have a chance of losing and the judge rules in the defendant's favor (only within the last few years has Japan actually started jury trials). If there's a lesser charge that they can get a case air tight on, then they'll do that instead, but obviously it's for a lighter sentence and less harsh crime like improper storage of human remains if they can't get someone for murder. It's also why their prosecution rates are super high</br>  <br>No matter how shitty their system may be there is a 0% chance a repeat offender such as the fat fuck would be allowed to go free<br>Otherwise Nippon would essentially be a third world country</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128812926 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128820017 <br/></br>    <br> nextweek on ranpo kitan </br>  <br>this art makes me want to puke</br>  <br> cops kill criminals <br>Yeah, the wrong ones. No one gives a shit when cops kill spree killers and other murderers.</br></br>  <br>That was one of the time he was previously caught</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128820203 <br> implying I give a shit about your argument over unrelated topics <br/></br>  Catching up on the past couple episodes I missed. Man they sure are ramping up the homoeroticism, aren't they?  <br>Oh well. I find consolation in the fact that he's still fucked up from when Kagami kicked his ass.<br><br>Hell, the chuuni showing off by beating up the landwhale (and dislocating his own hip in the process like a bitch) was unnecessary considering Kagami could have done the same without hurting himself.</br></br></br>  <br>Advert for the death penalty.</br>   draw a girl <br> call it a guy <br><br>stop, men dont have those hips</br></br></br>   yfw   Kagami won and has inspired more people to murder criminals   <br>If the sister was armed this would not have happened.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128820203 <br> you mad <br> :) <br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Born prematurely, and wealthy parents. Both are crimes against the natural order of things.</br>  Kagami and Paper Bag are not heroes we need, but ones we deserve.  <br>Though technically, he is a boy and not yet a man so while it still is retarded for a boy to have those hips, it is less retarded.<br><br>I am surprised people get annoyed over the "draw it a girl, call it a guy" thing. As long as Kobayashi isn't flat out annoying (unlike Hashiba), I could care less if he a trap or not. Then again I do find the focus on his femininity to be dull by now since we've seen it for the first four episodes in a row.<br><br>Lerche seemed to do it right by not focusing on Nagisa's ass every other episode, yet Kobayashi is basically there for fanservice and to be the MC (arguably, Akechi is the MC instead). I just wanted him to take a more active role rather than just letting Akechi handle everything.<br><br>More importantly, they should actually go deeper into the backstories of the main characters (notably Kobayashi and Hashiba) and explain stuff like when did Kobayashi get bored of everything, why is Hashiba his only friend, and why is he so feminine. Considering that trap characters tend to have their femininity related to their backstory somehow.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course he won, the dad of the loli is the one of the first one to take action.</br>  While watching the episode, I knew for sure the sister was going to die. However, considering the whole grotesque, sexual bent of Ranpo novels, I thought for sure he would've been in an implied relationship with her first. It would've made the death even more gut-wrenching.    <br>Looks more like Facebook</br>  <br>Could've at least edited that</br>  <br> there is a 0% chance a repeat offender such as the fat fuck would be allowed to go free <br>On what basis? There's no reason why it wouldn't work again.</br></br>  Hopefully shadow man doesn't get caught now he is the hero we need  <br>Shadow man has done absolutely nothing wrong, though, he just loves little girls<br>If you're talking about fatso's killer, that was the loli's dad</br></br>  <br>Voice sounded like Shadow Man's</br>  <br>Seeing all the shit that goes on in Japan, yes, they are a 3rd world country.</br>  <br>Didn't sound like Koyasu Takehito to me, and I don't remember seeing his name in the credits</br>  <br><br><br>seeing how shadow man is a master of disguise and can change his voice too, it could be him for all we know</br></br></br>  <br>He called the dead girl his daughter, why would he do it now?</br>  <br>I mean, he (the Shadow man) never called the dead girl his daughter like the killer did</br>  <br>It's the father, shadow man wouldn't frame the loli's father as murderer</br>  <br>Full ED when?</br>  Imouto reminds me of megu-nee from gakou. Why must the christmas cakes suffer, /a/? Why can't they just live happily pursuing their dreams?  <br>I doubt imouto was a Christmas cake, she should be like 21~24 years old.</br>   that how should i feel expression. <br>psychopath spotted.</br>  The source material seems pretty good. The author is influenced by Edgar Allen Poe and sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Lots of suffering indeed.  <br>She was fresh into college when he first got hired. Then he became a superintendent, so I assume several years passed, she must be around 30.</br>  Good weather soon anons.  <br>Smile status: non-existent</br>  <br>Akechi contacted him before Kagami became superintendent and he only looked a couple of years younger than he looks now</br>  <br>was she still alive when she was hung up there?</br>  <br><br>Yeah but in the flashbacks we see you can see this  scene, with his hand over the concrete.</br></br>  <br>doujins when?</br>   Horrible, gruesome shit will happen to good people <br> after the kawaii detectives just go in with retarded deductions and do a slap in the wrist of the criminals after all that <br><br>Oh, now they'll go after vigilantes.</br></br></br>  I knew she was dead from the beginning but I still got mad.  <br>But in the other flashback it showed the loli talking to her father, so that still doesn't prove it was the Shadow man. Everything else still points to the father</br>  <br>What if the Shadow Man was her father all along.</br>   just showed this episode to my mother <br><br>l just had to do it.</br></br>    <br> filename <br>Motherfucker</br></br>  <br> That part where you think maybe she's not that fucked up <br> then the wind blows </br></br>  <br> no limbs <br> face full of blood <br>What do you think?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.<br>https://ripeace.wordpress.com/2012/<wbr>09/14/the-murder-of-junko-furuta-44<wbr>-days-of-hell/</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>That's what I'm thinking. Soon the show will turn into that ep of Gotham where everyone just kills one other to acquire the 'power' of the red hood</br>  NOBODY CARED WHO I WAS BEFORE I PUT ON THE MASK  Man fuck this show. As much as I hate lolis dying, everything is just so quirky and strange that I have this bitter conflicting feeling inside of me when I watch this shit.<br>On one hand we have lolis but then on the other I've got a style over substance shit show.<br><br>God I need to take my meds after this.</br></br></br>  <br>Is your mother a shotacon?</br>  <br>All moms are according to my chinese porn comics</br>  Probably already been mentioned, but Edogawa actually had a book called Caterpillar with a guy named Sunaga and his wife's name is Tokiko.  <br>She's a fujoshit who complains Kobayashi's ass was better than hers when she was that young.</br>  <br>Oh now I get it, the sister's the caterpillar since she was trying to transform into a recognized clothes designer. She finally reaches the stage of butterfly when she's left hanging with her dress that flutters in the wind like butterfly wings.</br>  <br>No she's a caterpillar because her legs and arms got cut off and her eyes got ripped out.</br>  <br>kagami is the caterpillar who transformed after being cocooned by rage and justice.</br>  <br>ha I was going for a more beautiful ending to her. I'm still going for that the dress must symbolize wings because a butterfly's body is still shaped long. Or it could mean that she barely emerged as one.</br>  <br>Okay I like this too</br>  <br><br><br>In the source material Sunaga is the caterpillar because he has no limbs and the only functioning things are his eyes.</br></br></br>  <br>At the scene before Kagami finds out she's dead, there's a shot of a butterfly flying over the city. The scene after? A different sort of butterfly flying over the city.</br>  <br>Oh okay. Yeah I noticed the one butterfly but not both</br>  I hope next week we get back to the booty and leave all this suffering behind.  <br>Interesting. I was wondering what the butterfly was doing there.</br>  Isn't a quadruple amputee too light to hang? She surely must have been dead long before the killer put her there, otherwise she would have lived long enough to get saved.  <br>Judging by all the blood on her face, her shit was already fucked up</br>  <br>No booty, only suffering now.</br>  <br>I doubt he treated her properly to prevent her from bleeding out after cutting off her arms and legs.</br>   2015 <br>  crazy cunt escapes from psychiatric hospital, murders someone and goes unnoticed for a while <br>  able to find the house and family of the dude before the police can <br><br>there's always an easy way to fix shit like this:<br>meet these faggots in public again, kill them in a isolated spot, and argue that they were the ones starting the fight, and you were acting in self defense. Since criminals argued that they were mentally incompetent before, and they have a history of violence, everyone will believe you. heh</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She could have been alive during the hanging, and just fluttered in the wind until she choked to death.</br>  <br>Now this is edgy. If you're on the side of justice, you don't kill. It's the one rule that you never break.</br>  I already predicted that the imouto will be dead since he started narrating that flashback. Yet I still shocked and sad when I saw her dead. Why? Fucking great episode  <br>That's... That's not playing fair, Japan. Still pissed about the nukes or something?</br>  <br>Because she was missing limbs from the chest down.</br>  <br>Can you still fuck her?</br>  <br>Probably, she should still have those parts.</br>  <br>How difficult and painful would it be to remove those parts?</br>  What an emotionally stirring episode. I didn't mind how obvious the outcome was but seeing Kagami's decent into darkness and what happened to imouto was heartbreaking. Even now I'm at the verge of tears.  <br> muh edgy <br> muh justice <br><br>fuck off deontologist retard. You can go and candy coat your retarded ideology bullshit all you want but the truth of the matter is all the fuck you're doing is letting murderers back into society, and they're going to murder more innocent people. At the end of it all of your crap the criminals are getting away with their lives and the innocent who have always followed the laws are dying. But hey, as long as your brain feels like it's done the right thing I guess it doesn't matter how many innocent people have to die. After all, those killed by repeat offenders are nothing more than tragedies that you couldn't have prevented eh?</br></br></br></br>  The show is pretty decent, this episode was really rough. I knew the imouto was fucked, but it still hurt to watch.<br><br>Loving the OP and ED a lot. The girl who does the ED is a fairly new artist. She's only 19 and is very cute and weird. Of course she is made to sound better with processing, but her live singing and playing is good as well, kind of raw but she has a lot of potential. I love her adorable poncho/cape getups that she wears.<br><br>She goes by Sayuri, or sometimes Sangetsu Shoujo Sayuri, 酸欠少女さユり (Suffocating Girl Sayuri)<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh<wbr>NeAIOk8I1X2sTUH2sMtBw</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought she would be more goth loli for some reason.</br>  <br><br>Yeah her style seems to be more of that "quirky weird artsy nerd girl" thing. A lot of her original songs seem to be more on the dark sounding side, like the ED, but the official videos she has up are for more pop-sounding, upbeat songs. I think the record company probably doesn't quite know where to go with her yet.</br></br>  <br>Personally, I only find this episode in particular to be pretty decent.<br><br>Everything else in the show a hit or miss. Mostly miss.</br></br></br>  It's not really fair how the killer got to live in the end, the sister should have lived too.  <br>i never asked for this.</br>  <br> Mother and son both lusting after a little boy <br><br>I like this. I like this a lot.</br></br></br>  <br>Death would be better than living like that.</br>  <br>How the fuck can you call that live?</br>   The law can't do anything <br> But the guy who takes the law into his own hands is a fool and arrogant for thinking himself above the rules that judge men <br> He's the bad guy <br>I'm curious, does anyone at all think that people like him who kill horrible murderers and rapists who walk the streets not just in their actions? I mean I'm sure there's some Sweedishcuck who's been brainwashed into thinking that way because any violoence or aggression is bad (even when it's to stop more innocent people from dying to a maniac), but there aren't any real people who actually think that way, right?</br></br></br>  <br>Uh, did you miss the part where he was slowly dissolving in a tub of acid? Death would be merciful at that point.</br>  <br>He's an idiot for the crimes but not considered a bad guy. READ THE FUCKING THREAD.</br>  <br> but not considered a bad guy. READ THE FUCKING THREAD. <br>I meant in fiction in general and with regards to people's opinions on matter, not the context of this show specifically.<br><br>Stop typing in caps like an idiot.</br></br></br></br>  <br> deserved to be in jail. <br>He deserved a license to fire his gun on every scumbag on the streets.</br></br>  <br> laws that everyone ignore.jpg </br>  <br><br><br>Heres the idea pals. <br>Imagine if George Zimmerman was killed in a similar vigilante manner, don't you think a bunch of whities/hispanics would riot or protest over it?<br>Likewise, everytime a poor black baby is mercilessly shot by an officer there is some fucking black lives matter riots.<br><br>The problem is not that violence is intrinsically bad but that wanton violence against supposedly innocent people makes communities and groups of people not trust their environment.<br><br>If everyone knew for a fact that the person was a serial killer I'm sure they wouldn't care, however, the problem is people don't know that. They fear that someone might kill them in false retribution just like some other guy got killed.<br><br>This is why vigilantism is bad in almost all circumstances. It creates a society that doesn't trust their own laws and safety. Sure sure, there are exceptions etc...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Judge Dredd would not have let his Imouto get hurt, instead of some imperial detectives they should just have judges.  <br>he should just crushed one eye and peel off the eyelids of the another.</br>  <br> Heres the idea pals. <br>I'm sure this will apply to the situations we've been describing and won't introduce tons of grey area.<br><br> The problem is not that violence is intrinsically bad but that wanton violence against supposedly innocent people makes communities and groups of people not trust their environment. <br>And there's your problem. You're looki-<br> If everyone knew for a fact that the person was a serial killer I'm sure they wouldn't care <br>Oh so you're awar-<br> however, the problem is people don't know that. They fear that someone might kill them in false retribution just like some other guy got killed. <br>Damnit anon no. We're talking about cases where we no they killed the person but were acquitted due to legal loopholes or insanity pleas.<br><br> This is why vigilantism is bad in almost all circumstances. <br>You're right, the law itself needs to be something better than an ill-functioning pile rules that greedy lawyers manipulate for personal gain and to push their agenda. Imagine if the law didn't believe in things like barring evidence because it was obtained "unethically." Imagine if the objective fucking DNA evidence or digital surveillance we have available could be used without restriction, because somehow uncovering the unabridged truth is a violation of basic rights, and imagine if the death penalty wasn't some long drawn out, flawed and expensive process. Imagine if it was as simple as "We're taking biological and digital evidence, and if it all points to you having killed the innocent person, you get a bullet in your head tomorrow." Wouldn't it be lovely?<br><br>From there, crazy things like letting scumbag lobbyists ruin the healthcare and agricultural industries could even be stopped. The law could actually work to help society instead of let a certain group ruin it from the inside "by the rules."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's stupid. He should only kill on self defense, that's the only way you can regulate the monopoly on violence.</br>  <br>I just realized that she was hung with the dress that won a silver price</br>  <br> He should only kill on self defense <br>That would bar him from killing the monster who killed his innocent sister in cold blood because that wouldn't be killing in defense.</br></br>  <br>There you go anon. Let all the irony, tragedy and despair sink in.</br>  <br> Imagine if the law didn't believe in things like barring evidence because it was obtained "unethically." <br>I imagine that would lead to as many problems as it would solutions, if the requirements for submitting evidence are loosened too much.<br><br> imagine if the death penalty wasn't some long drawn out, flawed and expensive process <br>"A more efficient death penalty" doesn't sound as nice as I thought it would.<br><br> you get a bullet in your head tomorrow. Wouldn't it be lovely? <br>You want to give what can be an unabashedly corrupt system that kind of power?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I imagine that would lead to as many problems as it would solutions, if the requirements for submitting evidence are loosened too much. <br>The restrictions in place now are ridiculous.<br><br> "A more efficient death penalty" doesn't sound as nice as I thought it would. <br>Sure it does. Why put someone on death for a decade?<br><br> You want to give what can be an unabashedly corrupt system that kind of power? <br>No. I'm saying we fix the other corrupt and inefficient parts and THEN give it that power.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The problem is not that violence is intrinsically bad but that wanton violence against supposedly innocent people makes communities and groups of people not trust their environment. <br>But their environment and laws are not worthy of trusting especially when they're setting free criminals constanly<br><br> If everyone knew for a fact that the person was a serial killer I'm sure they wouldn't care, however, the problem is people don't know that. They fear that someone might kill them in false retribution just like some other guy got killed. <br>BUT THEY DO KNOW THAT. In the case where vigilantism does make the news then it will also talk about who the criminal is and what they are guilty of. Also the superintendent in the story was literally shilling out what the criminals did on youtube.<br><br>also the case in the show would be the exception no?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So I'm not the only one with a gay OTP am I?  I think I'm on to something, all the odd number episodes are the suffering ones.<br><br>1. Kobayashi is really a boy (minor suffering)<br>3.lolis<br>5.imouto</br></br></br></br>  Should have hired my team, Kagami. I get the job done.  <br>no more gays since best boy is straight.</br>  So how does this anime compare to Edogawa's original mystery novels? Did they butcher an old dead dude's shit with modern anime or is it actually pretty faithful?<br>Excuse my ignorance, I'm sure this question has been asked before, I just haven't been in these threads</br>    I always wondered why his head seemed too big for his body. Now I see it's like in those comics where a character gets so angry his head gets big. <br><br>Bravo Lerche.</br></br>  <br>Holy shit you're right</br>  <br>In the first few threads I heard it was a butchering. I'm not sure if that opinion still holds though</br>  <br>Instead of Un-Go we are now headed towards full Psycho-Pass</br>  <br>What color...are you?<br><br> SHAKE ME SHAKE ME </br></br></br>  None of that made any sense and the plot is downright dumb but it didn't even matter. This is the most depressing shit I've seen all year.<br><br>Fucking hell, I might have to watch Gakkou Gurashi afterwards to lighten the mood.</br></br>  <br>From what I've heard, the show's stories do not resemble the books at all, picking and choosing which elements from the episodes' respective novels to use as appropriate, but that the weird unnatural vibe and grotesque nature of the show is very much in the spirit of his works.</br>  <br>He's incest.</br>  <br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ak<wbr>PbNt5LX9k</wbr>  [ ] <br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VO<wbr>zFHscSNEU</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>2cute4me</br></br></br></br>  <br> Why put someone on death for a decade? <br>It is better to either go all in or not bother at all, but there have been countless periods throughout history that have expedited the execution process, and a lot people decided it wasn't such a good idea in retrospect. That plus other reasons result in the punitive systems we have today (read Foucault if you want more details on that).<br><br> I'm saying we fix the other corrupt and inefficient parts and THEN give it that power. <br>So just how do we fix the people, as well as the rules they implement, to ensure the omniscient, omnipotent, benevolent being you desire is brought about?<br><br>A world where good things happen to good people, and bad things happen to bad people, is the ideal every society strives for, but never quite pulls off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck off. Incest is great and all but their love is clearly familial.</br>  <br>What was that 2010+ movie where the guy's family got murdered and he did something similar to this?</br>  <br><br>Sounds like Alan Moore's nightmare. I wonder what his family thinks if there's any left</br></br>  <br>Knowing she was going to die was the worst part<br><br>The reveal last week and the knowledge that he was a siscon pretty much confirmed it, but they just kept adding and adding blocks to the story before brutally smashing them down. Knowing that last scene of them together was going to be her last was incredibly depressing.<br><br>I've loved the OP and ED since the start but this episode they really clicked. Especially the ED, it fit so perfectly it's scary.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> imouto looked just like megu-nee </br>  <br> So how does this anime compare to Edogawa's original mystery novels? Did they butcher an old dead dude's shit <br>You can't really say they butcher it because there's nothing in common.</br></br>  <br>I miss that show.</br>  <br> but there have been countless periods throughout history that have expedited the execution process, and a lot people decided it wasn't such a good idea in retrospect. <br>For no good reason that applies in this day and age.<br><br> So just how do we fix the people, as well as the rules they implement, to ensure the omniscient, omnipotent, benevolent being you desire is brought about? <br>Don't design the system to be able to be manipulated by scumbags and greedy lawyers under the pretense of "fairness and due process" and aim for efficiency and accuracy. The technology we have in this day and age would be unimaginable to the people who original came up with the law. Do you know how crazy shit like HPLC and southern blots are for providing evidence?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Agreed, always liked OP and ED from episode one, but especially that ED this episode, man. It really puts another spin on the lyrics. Chilling.</br></br>  <br>I miss it too, but Aku no Hana doomed itself the moment they decided to go with the unconventional rotoscoped animation. Too bad too, it had some potential.</br>  Never forget  <br>No.</br>  <br>head pats are for brother and sister love.<br>Kagami is a good brother and in no way will he think of lewd thoughts about his sister.</br></br>  <br>Head pats are just a step away from hand holding, his sister definitely has a thing for him, and he for her. He just hasn't realized it yet.</br>  <br>I bet you think Lelouch never fapped to Nunnally.</br>  <br> his sister definitely has a thing for him, and he for her. <br>keep being delusional.</br></br>  <br>Go watch Himitsu if you want a cop who wants to fug his sister and leave Kagami alone, man</br>   <br>Almost completely different stories that just share the same titles. Some of the more gruesome themes are shared though. <br><br>Human Chair <br> story is about a chair maker who lives inside the most beautiful chair he has ever made and lets rich people sit on him, only to fall in love with one of the woman who sit on him   I'm purposely not spoiling this okay  <br><br>Shadow Man <br> About a man who lives multiple lives ranging from philanthropist to CEO to famous crime novelist. One day gets hired by a man to become a professional killer (only hunts other criminals though). Eventually has falling out with said man after he grows to dislike killing. That man then gets extremely butthurt and puts a hit on Shadow Man himself.  <br><br>Twenty Faces <br> A phantom thief who is a master of disguise. Extremely narcissistic and kind of a dick, he sends letters stating the exact time he will rob someone. Then after robbing that person at said time, he will take off his disguise if he is still in the room and explain how he did the robbery before jumping out a conveniently placed window. Mysteries involving Twenty Faces revolve around figuring out who he is disguised as this time. Akechi and Kobayashi's rival.  <br><br>Caterpillar <br> about a wife taking care of her husband who came back from the war with all four of his limbs, most of his face, his hearing and voice lost in an explosion. The man is incapable of doing anything but wiggling on the floor, staring at her and eating. The wife is both horrified at his appearance but eventually grows to be a sadistic bully as she realizes how much power she has over him. Sad ending. <br><br>I find it strange that they used made Twenty Faces a serial killer when it makes more sense to have another Edogawa character, Spider Man (he uses poison though, not spider webs), who basically does the exact same thing anime Twenty Faces does for the same reasons.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>From what you've described, seems to me like they are combining Shadow Man, Twenty Faces, and Spider Man into one character so that this show can focus on one main antagonist.</br>  This isn't overly good but it will probably end up being the most memorable show this season.<br><br>Nothing else has such a unique feel to it</br></br>  <br>Law Abiding Citizen?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=J6l<wbr>5-Rup-D4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  Seeing a character crushed and then absolutely lose their shit is one of my favorite things in the world of general storytelling. 10/10 would enjoy episode again.  <br>I'm reading the manga adaption of Caterpillar. This is some fucked up shit.</br>  does anyone else think it's okay to kill criminals? Even something as little as mugging or stealing from someone?<br>I've been robbed like three times already and two of my friends got mugged I think it's fair to kill them so the other criminals would think twice before acting again.</br>  <br>Who's that black haired guy at top left?</br>  <br>Yeah that was great</br>  <br>They're Milky Holmes equivalents. The guy on the top left is Kobayashi</br>  <br>Damn nigga they already were ahead of you in the 16th century. If you punish someone stealing with death then you're just promoting criminals to kill and leave no witness than just stealing. They have better odds of getting away with it if they kill and the punishment is the same.</br>  <br>Don't bother, not canon</br>  <br>I think you should move to a civilized country.</br>  <br>He doesn't exist. That guy literally made him up for that post. <br><br>Everybody knows no such character exists in Milky Holmes.</br></br></br>  <br> If you punish someone stealing with death then you're just promoting criminals to kill and leave no witness than just stealing. <br>that's true</br></br>  <br>There's no sex in the original story. And there's lots of bullying. The ending is mostly the same though</br>  <br>I'm studying for that right now.</br>   a bunch of lolis died earlier on <br> and now a caring imouto died <br>God damn, I can't deal with this. Maybe I should drop the show for the sake of my sanity, that trap butt isn't worth all this suffering.</br></br>  <a href="http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1438330951600.webm" target="_blank">http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1438330951600<wbr>.webm</wbr></a>  <br>Shiiiiit So that was the caterpillar episode huh. <br><br>Wasn't expecting it to be done so sadly.</br></br></br>   Loli deaths <br> Imouto death <br> All of that buildup, knowing she was going to die <br> IN THE FUCKING DRESS <br>This episode made me feel nothing but anger. I don't want to watch cute girls die!<br>I thought this series might have had something meaningful, but it's nothing but trap ass and edgy shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then watch Cuticle Detective, that's something for you.</br>  I knew it was gonna happen but it still hurt. <br><br>I really hope this isn't the last we see of Kagami.</br></br>  Man now I wish Kagami didn't spill the beans and screwed around with the system like in <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/qRK57gaoldg  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I think I'm glad I dropped that show because it felt sillier than what I can stand right from the start. What the fuck happened, though? I thought it was supposed to be a (rather bad) comedy.</br>   "hey, hey, l know you have problems with criminal impunity, but let me tell you about this "twenty faces" vigilante guy"   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2Wg<wbr>t3hRw90w</wbr>  [ ]   I slowly and painfully killed him with chemicals and crushed his limbs <br>YES, GREAT!<br> Just like he did it to my sister <br>FUUUUUUUUUUCKKKKK</br></br></br>  Is Nakamura from novels too? Why is he always holding his sides?  <br> full version <br>Sweet.</br></br>  <br>He lost them when a funny criminal attacked him and got away with it.</br>  <br> but deserved to be in jail <br>He is going to be executed for serial murder.</br></br>  <br>To be honest, that's better for him, he has basically has nothing to live for.</br>  <br>He is the first 20 Faces, isn't he?</br>  Actually surprised the young cop was a killer and not the old Adachi looking guy.  <br>Remember, in Japanese murder-mystery the culprit is always the young cop or the nurse.</br>  Where the fuck are they?<br>How often do they run into rapists/serial killers/murderers/kidnappers? It can't seriously be even once a month can it? That's just too ridiculous. <br>Day 1: Man makes chairs out of women he loves AND IT'S CONSENTUAL<br><br>Day 8: Bag headed guy helps track down fatass kidnapper who killed his loli girlfriend<br><br>Day 15: Twenty faces turns out to be a double agent and not even from the other detective anime that was also good</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Detective Conan runs into a murder daily, shit's just that crazy in Japan I guess</br>   Legally insane due to drunkenness? <br>That's a joke right?</br>  <br> they should actually go deeper into the backstories of the main characters <br>I would go deeper into that backstory.</br></br>  <br> not Gay of Laplass <br>One job.</br></br>  <br>Gay of fapass.</br>  <br>this is only because aoyama focuses on the tricks instead of the setup<br>he also can't progress time for obvious reasons</br></br>  <br>Just carry a firearm and read up on self-defense laws so you don't end up in legal trouble.</br>  <br>I lost my sides.</br>  <br>Not enough Kobayassi this episode. Hopefully next week is better.</br>  i have discovered my super power after years of not falling for traps i realize that mah dick can tell which are traps are traps and which traps and just girls who are suggested to be traps  <br>What's gay about it? He's solving the mysteries.</br>  Is this the last we see of Kagami?   the fatass survives <br>How mad would you be?</br>  <br>i'm pretty sure he is full of holes and bleeds to death.</br>  <br>Shadow Man should save him so they can become a team of super loli protectors.</br>  I can't wait for all the trapfag tears when they reveal that kobayashi is a reverse trap.<br> b-b-b-but they cant do that!! <br>Kobayashi's nipples were censored in that changing room scene, they did this because he's really a girl and they can't be showing girl tits on TV, now can they?<br> b-b-b-but he was a boy in the novels!! <br>They've already taken plenty of liberties with the source material, who's to say they didn't also make kobayashi a girl pretending to be a boy pretending to be a girl.</br></br></br></br>  Is this anime going to be about the main characters chasing vigilantes, who are killing repeated offender murderers that can't be arrested?  <br>Im still waiting for it to come full circle.<br>Then it will be about serial killers that only kill other serial killers that kill serial killers.</br></br>  You can tell everyone on this board watches nothing but cute moeshit where nothing bad ever happens.<br>You have one cute girl dying and suddenly everyone gets their heart wrenched from their chest.</br>  <br>Maybe Nakamura was the original Twenty Faces?</br>  <br>Apart from  Kagami  every murderer so far has been punished.</br>  <br>To be fair, the girl was pretty cute, as was her relationship with her brother.</br>  <br>thought the same. I wouldn't really be surprised if he was.</br>  The Twenty Faces from the opening wears distinctly different clothes from Kagami, i hope he shows up yoo. Maybe, this time he will be a gentleman thief.  <br> He will now only start going after criminal who hurt little girls. <br><br>A true hero.</br></br></br>  <br>They also clearly establish that Kagami is a copycat and there is an original out there. If I recall correctly, the original wasn't ever caught.</br>  <br> He survives in the same way frogman did <br><br>I'm okay with that.</br></br></br>  Why kagami didn't say he was intoxicated so he could get released like others and go kill moar.  <br>Presumably you have to pass tests proving you're fit and sound to become a police officer.</br>  <br>That would be pretty hypocritical of him.</br>  <br>He does not want to abuse the system.</br>  If the government violates constitution by giving special rights to Akechi, why don't then issue someone a license to kill serial murderers?  when is the ost coming out?  <br>Its a sekrit detective club, and maybe the killers were given leniency to cull the japanese even if they are on the way to extinction.</br>  I'll admit it, I cried like a bitch when that fat bastard killed the detective's cute imouto.  <br>It wasn't the fat fuck though, I believe his name was Watanuki. I think the murderer was that guy with a snake tongue.</br>  <br>Lol, can't even tell anymore. My concept of the story blurred after the imouto died.</br>  <br>November 25th</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>So what kind of mask should i put?</br>  <br>It's simple, put on a mask and protect it yourself.</br>  <br>One that doesn't kill you if someone pulls it off hopefully.</br>  <br> What is the point of this show? I don't get what the message is or what it wants to be about. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=q5N<wbr>80tNDCGg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Seconding this guy </br>  <br> Facebook <br>No wonder he went on killing rampage.</br></br>  <br>You mean the glass gay</br>  <br>They are just screenshots with TV closed captioning he picked up on 2chan</br>  <br>that picture makes want to pull out my table of laplace transforms and solve some differential equations If you catch my drift</br>  <br>This is most likely true, but I still can't believe nobody rips these subs. Plus, why would a jap need to enable the captions, unless he's deaf?</br>  <br> Unless he's deaf <br>You answered your own question-</br></br>  <br>I do so for English programs too, there's always someone who's mumbling or has weird accent that you need subs to understand what he/she just said.</br>  <br>Shadow-man going full Tony when?</br>  <br>Banner material right here.</br>    <br>And even number episodes are the one where Manami appears. I still don't know why they even make her a character.</br>  <br>Kek</br>  Is the guy who recommended watching confessions of a dog here? I just watched it and holy shit, if the noodleland police is the same as they're depicted in the movie, then living in there doesn't sound very good now.<br>On second thought, what country's police doesn't do that? There must be something to hide in each one of them.</br>  <br> Not Game of Slapass <br>Jeez.</br></br>  Why did he decide to call himself Twenty Faces?<br>I mean something like Punisher or Abundent Justice would be more proper.</br>  <br>He didn't decide it.</br>  <br>I know it was the first guy who did, but seriously why?</br>   HAYAKU TSURETETTE KURE   <br>Or maybe I'm not dead inside yet like you anon.</br>  <br>Is he a z̵̟͍͍̿ͥ̅̉͞o̵̸̷̵̩̪͗̋̋͒ͧ̌̓̅͋̾̇̊̎̍͌ͥ̀͂<wbr>̹̥̠͇̰̩̤̭͔͚̱̗͈͔̫mͫͭ̌ͮ͐͐͗҉̯̙̮͖̖͘b̈́͒̂̒<wbr>͑̽͏̙̟̱͓̜͔̩̣̟̣̬͎̪̖̳̼i̴̸̡̠̪̖̱̱͛ͨͭͨ̾͊͝<wbr>̝̝͔̠̳̦̥̩͈̣͙̱e̛̽̓́ͬͥ̐ͭͫͩͤ͟͢͏̟̜͎̪̘͇̬ͅ<wbr>̻͍?<br>̢̦̗̘̬̗͖̜͎̞̫̼̆ͨͯ̏ͨ̈́̐̊ͮ͒ͩ̚̚̚͡ͅͅ</br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Because the guy is already famous and Kagami saw him as a righteous hero. Ultimately, he wants criminals to fear and think twice before cheating the system, it's better to use a legend than some new nobody for this kind of cause.</br>  <br>Well, since he's not the original one, and with statement that 20 faces wont die, it set up the possibility of more 20 faces in the future, like Sachiko's dad going Hotline Miami on the fatty.</br>  <br><br>Then again, Why did the original one name himself Twenty Faces?</br></br>  3 Hours to new episode.  On a date with KWSM!  2nd for nao  Nana episode?  <br><br>Why is Rin in Slytherin and Mio not in Hufflepuff?</br></br>  Momoka for sure  <br>Dookie is in puff because she's normal.</br>  <br>Headpats for the suffering old lady</br>  Did they take down the usual stream?  <br>Mio is brave to the point of stupidity and is actually very evil.

BTW, she's a misunderstood sex goddess.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>It's happening</br></br></br></br></br>      <br> Why is Rin in Slytherin <br>Personality-wise I think she'd be a Ravenclaw, but she looks great in green and silver.</br></br>  nana suffering episode?  I'm in love with the Nao Kamiya!  I want to shave Nao's eyebrows.  Hope we will see more Minami in the leader mode  Ravenclaw - Minami,<br>Hufflepuff - Chieri, Kieri, Miura. Mio, <br>Gryffandor - Anya, Ranko, Kanako, Uzuki, Riina<br>Slytherin - Rin, Azu, Rika, Miku</br></br></br>  <br> Hufflepuff <br> not Ranko <br>Come on, shitlord.</br></br></br>  I want to read books with Fumi.  <br>Hufflepuff is a dumping ground for the remedial, unattractive and those with special needs and is where all the losers, aspies and fatties end up.<br>So only Kanako, Ranko and maybe Uzuki can end up here</br></br>  <br>I want to read the Rankonomicon with Fumi.

This is a lot less cool than it sounds. <br> 98% of all Hufflepuffs are either in a huff or puffs. <br> Hufflepuffs are good at finding things. Sadly, this does not include their lunch money after they have been rolled for it by Slytherins or their teeth, after they've been knocked out by Gryffindors. <br> Unlike other houses, Hufflepuffs do not have any active or vocal rivalry with any other house. This is because they rightly cringe and cower in the presence of their betters. <br> Wearing Hufflepuff colors makes you look like a bee's ass. <br> According to legend, the first wizard that mastered the art of counting to potato was a Hufflepuff. <br> The Hufflepuff's favored form of magic is pastamancy, the art of dropping one's spaghetti. <br> Hufflepuff's common room is in Hogwarts' basement, making them literal basement dwellers. <br> Popular Hufflepuff activities include quidditch, feasting and wishing they were in another house. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So, aren't you faggots gonna watch the stream?  <br>aren't you gonna link it?</br>  <br><br>This is defame.<br><br><br><br>5 minutes.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Where and which order should I start this franchise with?<br>It seems like a lot of series are already out and I'm a bit confused.

At least CG is having some kind of direction.</br>  I like that TakeP just basically declared war on Mishiro, but I do hope that the rest of the 346 Producers aren't Mishiro's lapdogs or pussy fucbois in general.<br><br>Hopefully the other Producers get influenced by TakeP and declare Idol Jihad on Mishiro as well.</br></br>    <br> TakeP uses his gacha tickets.jpg <br><br>That's probably the most accurate description you could give</br></br></br>  <br>Hopefully Momoka joins their cause</br>  <br>MayuP (Who I am also assuming to be the Producer of Happy Princess) is probably gonna join the Egao Faction too.</br>  <br>Positive Passion is way better.</br>  <br><br>new majiawa</br></br>  <br><br>If you take away the food, would Kanako die?</br></br>  <br>There might be a chance that Mishiro counters by stealing girls and forming TP and PP<br><br>Right now, we see what kind of war is happening.</br></br></br>  <br>The NOMAKE artist always goes way out of his way to make Anya look adorable, and I love him for that</br>  <br> TakeP uses his gacha tickets.jpg <br> getting trash after gacha <br>Sounds about right.</br></br></br>  <br>Calm down Momokafag.</br>  Still waiting for my one and only.

Yea she's extremely cute, but she's boring.</br>  <br> TakeP uses Cinderella Ball plan on MishirOujo; it's very efective <br> MishirOujo is now wet <br> TakeP takes another turn, uses gatcha tickets </br></br></br>  <br><br>She's secretly a papermaster and Yomiko's student.</br></br>  <br>You don't have to go out of your way to do that.</br>    <br>Tharja in idol form, minus the stalker and infinitely more cute.</br>  <br> Momoka is revealed to be Mishiro's daughter <br> The portrait you see in  might be of Mishiro. </br></br>  Is there an Egao he CAN'T Protect?  This episode looked way worse than the Hibiki episode.  <br>They voiced the wrong curly deko</br>  Wow, TakeP goes idol collecting<br><br>It's both surreal and exciting, even if the pace is slow</br></br>  <br> Is there an Egao he CAN'T Protect? <br><br>I'll give it 7 episodes tops.</br></br></br>  <br>She gets very talkative and gets embarrassed about it + she's extremely cute bookworm</br>  <br> "I'm your final hope" Wizard <br> Not "I can't smile but I can protect the ones who can!" Faiz <br><br><br>At least, no one was stranded on a cliff</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>On one side, I'm happy Anya's getting some NOMAKE recognition, on the other I'm getting depressed that it decreases her chances of getting her own episode, I hope A-1 delivers.</br>  <br><br> his own </br></br>  <br>She'll come<br><br>with me</br></br></br>  Why?  <br> Shoop TakeP on Onii-sama <br> Didn't shoop Kaede on Miyuki <br>YOU HAVE ONE JOB, BRO!</br></br></br>  <br>But at least it had plot.<br><br> me smart woman take best idols <br> you get these cast aways <br> ok </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tatsuya as a producer would be the funniest shit.</br>  <br>Holy shit. What.</br>  <br>I've got a huge thing for shy girls that like books. Bonus points for how she becomes talkative when she's into a conversation. <br>Also, her soothing voice.</br></br>  <br>I love seeing TakeP and AkaP as friends in fanart and stuff</br>  <br><br> Name-dropping a much more successfully anime to cover for shitty and disappointing CG. <br>For what purpose?</br></br></br>  <br>Well, you're in luck since there's ought to be new fanart of TakeP trying to NTR Hibiki off AkaP based on the Anniversary Live.</br>  <br> much more succesful <br> shitty and disappointing CG <br>Yeah, just look at those sales. It's flopping so hard<br><br>LLfags, everyone</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A-1 really doesn't give a fuck about CG. Million Live is on the way and they have a much bigger hand in ML's development and success. They're only doing CG out of obligation, kinda of like if you married somebody who already had a kid.<br><br>Or, another way to put it would be that ML is Dudley Dursley and CG is Harry Potter. Scamco and A-1 the parents.</br></br></br>  <br>It must be nice having your dad work at A-1</br>  Nana feels like some kind of alternate universe of Yukarin, if Yukarin failed to become success.  <br>Not when he's silly dumb muggle scum.</br>  <br> ML: Dudley Dursey <br>Muggle<br> CG: Harry Potter <br>Wizard<br><br>nobody wants to be a Muggle</br></br></br></br></br></br>   megane idol <br> psychic idol <br> kigurumi idol <br> usamin idol <br><br>This is a pretty nice episode</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> nobody wants to be a Muggle <br>I do actually. Magic is dangerous.</br></br>  New voice:<br><br>Ueda Suzuho: 春野ななみ<br>Hamaguchi Ayame: 田澤茉純<br>Namba Emi: 伊達朱里紗</br></br></br></br>  <br>But what about that idol? You know, that one.</br>  <br>The episode basically about gimmick Idols belonging in the trash. I agree with Mishiro.</br>  <br><br>ML is more like Draco Malfoy I think.<br>And CG is already overcoming the odds with its popularity.</br></br></br>  <br>Ninja and samurai idol too</br>  <br> couldn't protect NG's egao <br> couldn't protect his own egao <br> EGAONATION's Queen delivered the job <br><br>Sasuga EGAONATION.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>who?</br>  It's just A-1 being A-1, the 2011 anime was also awful.  <br>REMOVE YUKO<br>REMOVE MEGANE<br>REMOVE SUZUHO</br></br></br>  <br> CG is good because muh sales <br>So ironic.</br></br>  <br>It helps that they made the Producer a fun character</br>  <br>At least it had some animation. It's not that still abuse wasn't prevalent there either, but at least it hadwell animated scenes to make up for it.<br><br>CG has neither.</br></br></br>  <br>We can criticize both for their QUALITY, but truth be told, we're enjoying them. I'm personally enjoying CG more. People who glorify 2011 over CG quality-wise should probably rewatch it.</br>  <br> the 2011 anime was also awful. <br>but what about that chihaya live scene man</br></br>  <br>Maybe but the 2011 it also had terrible characterization and just horrible writing.<br>No amount of quality animation can fix that.</br></br>  <br>Uzuki saved NG and Producer's EGAO<br><br>Kaede provided inspiration for the EGAO Nation</br></br></br>  <br>2 minutes of Yaksoku and 2 minutes of Smoky Thrill don't really make up for 24 episodes of shit. Azusa's episode was good though.</br>  <br>But that's halfway through the second cour. CG hasn't even reached that point yet</br>  <br>TakeP was a revelation, sadly couldn't help to feel that CG anime was a bit lacking compared to 2011 anime.<br>We can feel the love of the staff towards imas in the 2011 anime, especially with Nishigori and co.<br>Whereas Deremas staff seems like they're just barely giving any effort.</br></br></br>  Based Oda Non  <br>I thought the Chihaya arc was godawful. The concert scene was nice I guess but everything that lead up to it was downright stupid.<br>They removed all character until nothing but a sad backstory was left.</br></br>  <br>This. Nostalgiafagging is really hard in this thread</br>  <br>Ｔａｍａｍｉ　ｉｓ　嘉山未紗</br>  <br>To be fair to deremas, another problem is having the same setting and themes, but not trying to retread over the same steps. Not like animas was even that good, but it had the advantage of nothing coming before it. People just have a soft spot for it, because for most people it was their first proper engagement with iDOLM@STER as a franchise.<br><br>I was thinking that LL:Sunshine may have the same problem, but that actually has competent staff working on it. So who knows.</br></br></br>  <br>The thing about the anime is that they over dramatized everyone. So the cause of Chihaya drama was drawn out and awful. I think the resolution was beautiful.</br>  <br>First ep was unbeleivably good, but it eas obvious that it's got to be a strange exception.</br>  <br>I hope we get lots of doujins of Stepmom</br>    iM@S is having a resurgence and Japanese fans are enjoying the danketsu <br>  Meanwhile /@/ makes tinfoil conspiracies about an alleged rift between original iM@S/ML staff and CG </br>  <br> tinfoil conspiracies about an alleged rift between original iM@S/ML staff and CG <br><br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you!</br>  <br>this isn't /@/, here people come just to shitpost</br>  <br>Not yet; she still on "gambarimasu"; she is not ready to take on the EGAONATION's flagship.<br><br>BTW is Nana part of EGAONATION when she can't even protect her own smile?</br></br></br>  Why does the general audience eat up moeshit when there are japanese artists that are quite capable of producing objectively better art?  <br>Because its easy<br>Its the easiest to watch, the easiest to take in and the easiest to make.</br></br>  <br>Everybody knows the answer, now go masturbate in the corner</br>  <br>80% of this board consists of threads about litte girls, just look at the catalog. You're obviously asking this question to the wrong people. While shounenshit has around 15% of the board and the rest is random garbage, moeshitter focus to make the shounen portion even smaller here. What can you get from that? Right that actually quality manga like vagabond won't even have the chance to be genuinly appreciated here as the audience here is retarded either way.</br>  I would honestly love if there was a full on decent anime with that art style,  <br>If that's the case, why do people support artists being lazy?</br>   Reality is tough, so read this manga about cute girls and feel better   <br>Because I like said content.</br>  Because anime isn't the medium for actual artists.  <br>That would be a massive undertaking. Each frame would have to be painstakingly created from scratch and you couldn't use animation tricks like pic related like you can with more cartoony artstyles.</br>  <br> comparing anime art to manga art </br>  <br> Why don't my anime look like they were drawn by Inoue? <br>Because if you tried to animate something in that style, half the staff would kill themselves before completing it.</br></br>  <br>Are you insinuating that moeshit doesn't have a firm grip on the manga market, too?</br>  <br>no, I'm saying that moeshit is a lot easier to animate than something like Vagabond</br>  <br>It really doesn't. Shounenshit does.</br>  <br>are you insinuating that firm grip equals general audience?</br>  <br> half the staff would kill themselves <br>This is acceptable.</br></br>   moeshit <br/>   objectively better <br> art <br><br>I know what you're getting at but come on man, art is subjective.</br></br></br>  <br>Read the novel, peasant.</br>   why does the general audience <br> post pic from a manga <br> audience <br> manga <br><br>Are you confusing anime with manga, anon?<br>Also, you could ask the same thing to western animation, but replace "moeshit" with "wacky, cartoony artstyle".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the most retarded post I've ever read, congratulations</br>  <br>All art has inherently objective and subjective criteria.<br>An artist not only needs to versed in art and aesthetics, but also in crafts.<br><br>The value and quality of an artwork, any artwork, be it prose, poetry, drawings, paintings, building, sculptures, are obviously determined by the aesthetic, but the more you move into abstracted and conceptual art, the more the value is also determined by the way the work is made and how well the artist could do what he envisioned.<br><br>The Bauhaus School and its successors had the right idea about the entire thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fair enough</br>  <br> asking /a/ - we love moeshit a question like that </br>  <br>To a degree. There are objective qualities in a piece (and no, not what you feel like while looking a t a work). If art was truly, only subjective, entirely, then a child's crayon drawing could be equal to a Rembrandt. Things like positioning, symbolism, color choice, lighting, anatomy, image composition, and more are all things that can be measured and appraised objectively.</br>  <br>Is that Yasuo?</br>  <br>you can like both.<br><br>i can read takemitsu zamurai and then read gakkou gurashi afterwards. i don't see the problem.<br>artstyle doesn't necessarily say anything about a manga.</br></br></br></br>  Where are the fucking mods, jesus christ.  <br> Things like positioning, symbolism, color choice, lighting, anatomy, image composition, and more are all things that can be measured and appraised objectively <br>You're an idiot.</br></br>  <br><br>These are subjective values put on by an audience/community and repeat until it's believed to be true.<br><br>But as always, a case of all immaterial thing.<br><br>A child might prefer DBZ to Shakespeare, an adult might feel vice versa, either are really right or wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I also miss the older, hand drawn style, but lets be REAL (hue) here and understand that there is only a few Japanese artists that can produce art of the quality of Vagabond, and they have the benefit of being able to do it without worrying about animating it. You aren't likely going to be able to find a studio's worth of animators with drawing talent equal to Inoue's that can the also animate it successfully.</br>  <br><br>What's with all these faggots going directly for anime when its clear what's being discussed is manga.</br></br>  <br> child's crayon drawing could be equal to a Rembrandt <br>Rembrandt isn't particularly interesting, I'd prefer looking at children's crayon drawings over looking at yet another one of those dull as shit baroque fuckers.<br><br>Matisse and his lot are much more interesting.</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>This is very reminiscent of the pop art movement, but it's about 40 years late to be considered worthwhile.</br>  <br>A sizeable percentage of /a/ literally forgets that manga exists sometimes.</br>  <br>You call them subjective, but all ideas of visual beauty to humans comes from the human eye. There maybe a few people who would say that their first grade art assignment is equal to "Self-Portrait with Turned-Up Collar" but most would not. The majority opinion on this rises from society true, but even before that its root is in what we human as a species will find beautiful.<br><br>Going even beyond this,art is a craft. Crafts can be well made or poorly made, and the determinet of this lies in how well the piece succeeds at what it intends to do. A well built bridge is a bridge that, when compared to other bridges, lasts far longer than average and remains sturdy in situations where the average bridge doesn't. <br><br>What i'm getting at is that the quality of a craft is determined by how you set the range of comparison. A child's drawing could be the peak of all other child's drawings at that age, but if you expand it to the larger art world it will slip back towards the average, or below it. <br><br>It's a hard case to make, because the idea is that who can tell a person what they think is wrong, especially if it concerns personal views of art. But the piece can still be made poorly and have poor composition, even if it touches someone's heart. <br><br>Man this a rambling thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We're going to have to disagree on that then, because although I do also like Matisse, there is a powerful beauty to Rembrandt's work and a lot of it comes from his painting style (which I had the pleasure of seeing up close when a collection of his work came to a nearby art museum).</br>  <br>an art is a good art if it arts well, but the ability to art is subjective, thus the value of art is measurable only through the subjective preferences of humans, thus art is subjective <br><br> artfags </br></br></br>  <br>Before 2007 everyone in Japan loved manime, but they were brainwashed by Kyoani when they released Lucky Star.</br>  <br>For me, art is about communication, the moment when the feeling (generated by the artist) connects with me, it becomes art, how it appears doesn't matter.<br><br>This is why I genuinely like ZUN art and Ryu07 art despite technically they are pretty horrible.</br></br></br>  LIKING "MANIME" OR HATING "MOESHIT" DOESN'T MAKE YOU MANLIER /R9K/ SHITHEADS,  <br>I fucking hate you so much.</br>  <br>That's a good summary of what I verbally shitted out there, but the point is that art has both subjective and objective qualities. You can subjectively prefer are poorly made work, and think a well made work is boring, but that doesn't change the general quality of each piece.</br>  <br> there is a powerful beauty to Rembrandt's work and a lot of it comes from his painting style <br>Nah, it's like everything else before people started experimenting.<br>After a certain level of technical skill in painting, which, admittedly, just about anyone back then had it's all about composition, which honestly isn't very impressive in Rembrandt's works.<br>And also if you want to look at some proper mastery of the style of the times, try one or two hundred years earlier.<br><br><br>tbh I'm just sick of it all</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>name an objective quality</br>  <br>Does liking shit like Lord of The Flies over Eragon make me manlier?<br><br> implying /R9K/ doesn't fawn over moeshit </br></br></br>  <br>Lighting consistency</br>  Who is your favorite weeaboo artist?<br>Mine is  Van Gogh </br>  <br>doesn't affect the ability of an art to art</br>  <br>Where do you newfags even come from?<br><br>To insinuate that CGDCT has some giant portion of the manga or anime market is really funny and obviously shows you are fucking new to anime and /a/ as fuck. <br><br> using moeshit unironically <br> as if there is anything wrong CGDCT </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Vagabond would still be the goddamn same if all the characters are replaced by cute girls.<br><br>And you know it.<br><br>Jap pop culture cute girls aren't "girls" in a sense, more like symbols, symbols that are compatible with everything.</br></br></br></br>  fun things are fun  <br>I disagree and also agree. I agree in that the composition of Rembrandt's works themselves (or at least his self portraits) aren't that interesting, but although the style of much of the barogue art at the time focused on extremes of light and dark and a focus on flesh and its contortions, Rembrandt has a very interesting painting style i don't see in many others. It has a good amount in common with something like pointillism. The other thing to keep in mind is that just because it was a "golden age" of art and the style was widespread, most artists did not have the same level of technical skill.</br>  <br>Lonely weebs whose only source of sexuality is through their non-thratening anime blobs</br>  <br>If you mean how to separate a well made piece from a poorly made one, then yes, lighting consistency is a good thing to check. If you mean conveying emotion or feeling to a viewer, then it is still important, even if those things are subjective.</br>  <br>Thank you :)</br>  <br> the older, hand drawn style <br>The fuck is this mean?<br>You mean people nowadays draw not using their hand?</br></br></br>    <br>Or maybe because cute girls are appealing, maybe.<br><br>I like your opinion.</br></br></br>  <br>Most people here are pedo</br>  <br>The thing with CGDCT is that there's no characterization. All the girls in such manga or anime are just cute for the sake of being cute. That's why they earned the moniker "moeblob", because being cute is literally all these characters have going for them.<br><br>Now, I'm not saying that liking cute things just because they are cute is wrong, but personally I expect a little more from characters in the fiction I choose to indulge in.</br></br></br>  <br>If they can convey emotions, then the well-made piece really isn't superior to the "poorly drawn" one.<br><br>They both get the job done.</br></br></br>  <br>digital painting</br>  Vagabond is very popular though.  <br>Artistry is a combination of technical skill and expression. The greater the skill, the greater the breadth of expression that is possible. Really, it's not a complicated concept to wrap your head around.</br>  <br>I see this response so many times. I will admit I misspoke a bit, as a lot of the modern anime feel comes from the computerized coloring style. Essentially a hand drawn piece would be from a time before the majority of the work was done using computer programs (including drawing tablets and art work software like Photoshop).</br>  <br>I don't know if I'm just crazy but it just seems extremely logical and obvious to think that there's gotta be a combination of subjective and objective so I can't understand why this one anon has such a hard on for arguing this?</br>  <br>If both can achieve the same function, but one requires less skill and effort then that one is superior.</br>  <br>A poorly made piece will have a harder time conveying emotion, and will have less of a range. That said, there will ALWAYS be someone out there who prefers a single solid colored canvas to a da Vinci.</br>  <br>You know he is talking about manga right?</br>  <br>Because we think differently.<br><br>Technical skill i.e. how realistic the art is, doesn't have jackshit to do with the breadth of expression.</br></br></br>  <br>Nice rebuttal. I win.</br>  <br>Which is why minimalism and modern art are things. That said, the goal of a pop art piece is likely to be different than that of a baroque, even if they both mean to convey emotion.</br>  <br>As an elitist board, /a/ surely has lots of morons.</br>  <br>You're missing a crucial point here.<br>Any of those things can easily be ignored if the artist chooses to do so.</br></br>  <br> If both can achieve the same function <br><br>There's no such thing as achieving the same function in art, we're not talking about a company here, a message can be transmitted in different ways, pieces of art can try and convey the same emotion but that doesn't mean that emotion was conveyed in the same way, thats where the subjective part lies.</br></br></br>  <br>I appreciate your input and will take your counter arguments into consideration.</br>  <br>Technical ability isn't limited to realism. It's more like your artistic vocabulary. A writer that knows 40000 words can express himself better than a writer that only knows 10000, all other things being equal. There's no downside to improving your skill.</br>  <br>That's just not even true.<br><br>Ryu07, for example, has no problem in conveying emotion even when his drawing is shit, technically.</br></br></br>  <br>You're confusing technical skill with realism that's the issue. Technicall skill applies the same way for a surreal piece and to an abstract pieces.</br>  <br>Except it does. The more lifelike your art, the better it can convey things like atmosphere.<br><br>Look at this painting, for example. If the artist lacked the technical ability to paint shading and proper lighting, for instance, it wouldn't convey the atmosphere of a serene mountain valley nearly as well.</br></br></br>  <br>The function here is communication.<br><br>If both piece of arts can deliver their messages, but one requires less effort, then that one is the optimal part to take.</br></br></br>  <br>There are pieces that have such amazing technical skill that they can almost be mistaken for photos but lack any form of expression, and there are pieces that are so full of expression but lack any form of technical ability so they aren't able to properly convey it. The goal is to find the middle ground.</br>   Loses/draws almost every fight in all 3 routes, only wins against Caster. <br> Has no Noble Phantasm, admits UBW is just a pseudo Noble Phantasm <br> UBW is only a minor annoyance to most servants. <br> Biggest achievements are being a hard to kill like a cockroach, and frustrating much stronger servants by being a sneaky bastard. <br> Only good at talking trash and threatening other servants as though he is that strong. <br><br><br>Seriously he is great if your only enemy is Gilgamesh, but how do Archerfags convince themselves he is so OP so strong?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Because sociopaths are fun to watch when they try to be good people.  <br>Archerfags are delusional, that's all</br>  He once tried to fight a saint<br><br>Also he's Batman, an inferior player who can get an edge using skills or tactics, but if it was a simple head to head battle would often lose.</br></br>  Nicely animated OP, it has blur effects just like Kuzuki's battle in UBW to create a feeling of motion which will look strange in a frame by frame manner if you look for it, but all it once you'll never tend to notice it.  He's honestly not. People just assume he can UBW and shoot swords at people all willy nilly. His long range caladbolg is basically nuking a servant from orbit, which would be effective versus masters, but Archer is just garbage at fighting most servants that aren't Gil or Caster.  <br> Also he's Batman </br>    <br>the fact that he was granted hero status is already a miracle</br>  <br>Archer&gt;Shirou&gt;Gil&gt;Every other servant.<br>UBW is a stronger GoB and GoB is capable of beating every servant except Emiya.<br>It's not "rock-paper-scissors", it's "scissors-rock-bigger rock" with the bigger rock beating the shit out of the smaller rock and the scissors. <br>Nasu wanted to make Shirou an underdog but failed miserably.</br></br></br></br>  <br>hes a failure who cant even kill himself</br>  <br> batman <br><br> billionaire <br> young <br> virile <br> like 6'4 <br> has access to every public technology and tons of private/government tier technologies <br><br> """""""inferior player"""""""" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That statement only confirms the previous statement, rather than denies it, if that's what you're going for. It might be what you're going for of course since you are confirming it.<br><br>Batman isn't the strongest, fastest, smartest, or most skilled; the various Robin's are better than him at their niche and Lady Shiva is a far better fighter. Yet even if a Robin could score a 9 in their individual category, Batman is a solid 8 in most categories which allows him to be a mixed type who can change his strategies on the fly with a bit of variety.<br><br>Each of Batman's villains also might have something they can outclass him in towards his niche, yet they cannot beat the guy who has the full package. Because Batman is the guy with planning and tactics above all, because he's rich, because he's trained, because he has various methods to aim to his advantage.<br><br>Batman was never the most skilled or the strongest; Dick might be a more skilled fighter, Tim Drake is smarter or more of a detective, and Jason is more edgy.<br><br>He's not Batman because he's the best, but because he's got versatility and always knows how to twist and push the situation to always find a path despite being inferior in a world of super humans.<br><br>Lancelot is a terrible example, he's a super human in a world of super humans; not someone who needs to play it smooth with tactics and knowledge to find a path.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's not a hero if you played the game, he's an improper summon due to a messed up grail.<br><br>In any proper grail it wouldn't be possible to summon him, he's just a CG, not a hero.</br></br></br>  What about EMIYA with Alaya's support?  <br> UBW is a stronger GoB <br>wut<br>UBW can only replicate edge weapons (what fits Shiro Comcept of SWORD) and shield but burns Mana as fuck, all the other treasures like enkidu or whatever else is like clubs, hammers etc, cant</br></br></br>  I mean, archer doesn't really try to fight FIGHT anyone in UBW other than the occasional "guess I'll do my job" type of moment like with caster.  <br><br>Would Archer have won the war if Rin just stayed in the cellar like he asked her to?</br></br>  <br> Lives in world full of superhumans and ungodly immortals <br> parents are DEEEEAAAD </br></br>  <br>ok, ok, he is a tseudo hero and its cause his deal with the world (or gaia, whatever) <br>he stills gets a place in the throne of heroes, but his summons and after life works different than the rest (expect Arthuria cause World pact too)</br></br>  <br>Except you're really, incredibly wrong for reasons so obvious I won't even go into them.</br>  <br> he stills gets a place in the throne of heroes, <br><br>As a guy who's infinitely summoned to kill people throughout time and space, in various worlds.<br><br>Which he hates</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this is why he starts to regret everything and tries his dam best to rewrites past<br><br>still, is a hero, on a time when is 99.9999% impossible for anyone to be granted said status.</br></br></br>  <br>Not everyone gets to make a contract.</br>  is Shielder a new hero class or just in game class?  <br>He's not a hero, he's a Counter Guardian<br><br>It's not that impossible to be a CG, anyone can do it even in the current age if they're willing to sell away their immortal soul for power.<br><br>People don't seem to get the difference here; Heroic Spirit is a status you can only achieve on your own by being so incredible that you overcome fate itself, being a CG isn't anything too complicated if you know how to make the contract.<br><br>Its like making a deal with the devil; its not hard, but you're paying for it forever. No it isn't impossible to be a CG, and no he isn't a hero.<br><br><br>Even Rin knows how to do it offhand, and she indeed did do it in one timeline.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was a class that was cut from the original F/SN<br><br>Its a class as old as all of the others, its from one of the three to five lost routes.<br><br>Her role in the game was taken by Gilgamesh in the end.</br></br></br></br></br>  He did manage to kill Heracles once with that Caladbolg shot  <br>tseudo hero, he got that status cause the pact boost, but instead of dying and spend eternity in the Throne to be copied for the wars, he was put to work as CG. <br><br><br>with enough time, and mana, he should be able to pull the 12-13 kills needed <br><br><br>being a total dick was her role?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Archer's swordsmanship was so good it gave Hercules a sword boner and made him regret being summoned as Berserker.<br><br>Lurk more, newfag OP.</br></br></br>  <br> Would Archer have won the war if Rin just stayed in the cellar like he asked her to? <br>Probably not since his objective is to kill Shirou, but if his objective is to win then it's not impossible although unlikely.</br></br>  <br> being a total dick was her role? <br><br>A stray servant from the previous war; maybe she ate on people between wars to survive, but not in a malicious way? Its like a vampire needs to feed to survive, in order to keep living she had to exist as a stray cat that need to keep going somehow in order to live. If you want to keep living no matter what, you might have to give up on a few things. Was noted to kill her own master, but considering she would have been a heroine, it was probably a Medea type situation where her master was a dick.<br><br>Her existence was like someone who was lost or stray, an abandoned puppy, Shirou would have ended up taking her in as the stray servant.<br><br>We don't know too much beyond this<br><br> Stray Servant [Others] <br> A heroine candidate that vanished without a trace during the plotting stage. <br> She was conceived of as an "abandoned puppy" type heroine, who killed her Master and went on a rampage. <br> As a Servant of the shield, she was going to be a rival to Saber, the Servant of the sword, but… <br> Just like Gilgamesh, she would have been a Servant that had remained behind after the previous Grail War. <br> Unfortunately, though, she had to be cut for the sake of keeping things manageable for the player. <br> After all, around this point, the plot itself was starting to stray. Not only Rider, but even Caster was a potential heroine candidate. It was terrifyingly chaotic. <br> Hmm? Fuji-nee? I don't know what you're talking about, Fuji-nee never had a main route even during the plotting stage.  <br><br>Might sound like a scary type, but I can see a bit that her real situation might have been a reversal, like Medea. Where she was good and tried, but it didn't work out, and she tried to hang on anyway for some reason.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and she indeed did do it in one timeline. <br>What are you basing this on?</br></br>  <br>His swordsmanship isn't "Soo good" like its the strongest, rather Arthur comments its pure, it flows like water, and its beautiful.<br><br>Sasaki's swordsmanship is far more beautiful, but Archer's is also something one marvels at, like its more of a dance than a killing style.</br></br></br>  <br>Was it just his swordsmanship or his tactics and way of fighting in general?<br><br>I would think EMIYA would have trouble one on one against most servants that are specialized in that kind of fighting a la Lancer, Saber, etc. But he could easily deal with them via long-range attacks such as BPs and the bow he used against Saber in H/A (Hrunting?)</br></br></br>  <br>CG TOHSAKA</br>  <br>IF he is already on the long distance snipping but once in close combat, Lancer (both Zero and Fate) and saber are better than him.</br>  <br>Haha what?</br>  <br>Jesus christ that's a completely different fucking world.</br>  <br>Dick's inferior to Bruce in terms of combat. He's the superior acrobat, not the superior fighter.<br><br>Cassandra's the superior fighter.</br></br></br>  <br> its pure <br>Actually that's just poor translation.<br><br>Remember that archer is basically batman. Everything he does is for efficiency. In the VN saber says that Archer's form is while beautiful has few wasted movements flowing like water.<br><br>So not pure as in beautiful, but as in very basic and animalistic.<br>Archer can only move his body the way it moves. He doesn't have prana bursts, can't tank shots, or break the laws of physics like the rest of the servants.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> how do Archerfags convince themselves he is so OP so strong? <br>Because Nasu tells you that he's weak and then proceeds to show you how strong he can be. Just shit writing.</br></br>  <br>Its just another timeline<br><br>Even the end of the story talks about how they're just different timelines brought together, just like the April Fools storyline. Which is kind of a joke on itself considering the end of AF story.<br><br>People sometimes think its "That's an entire different worldverse; F/SN has a world verse, Tsukihime has a worldverse, Extra and Apoc are their own thing entirely separated, Mahoyo is entirely separated, they're all different and seperate", however that's not correct at all and is proven wrong.<br><br>Everything is just alternate timelines of each other on the infinite timeline scale. Everything connects at the root, each individual world-line can work under somewhat different rules, but they are all connected in the same way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Archer loses almost instantly in two routes, yet people just look at one route and go "See"<br><br>While missing a huge point that almost all servants have a route where they do incredible things and almost win, or have a chance of winning. <br><br>Every servant has a route where they'll be shafted, every servant has a route where they do incredible, which is supposed to show you that everyone has a chance based on situation.<br><br>Thus showing that its not power levels that determine anything, but rather situation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> however that's not correct at all and is proven wrong. <br>Well dude holy fuck, the Alaya from capsule servant is nothing from the Alaya in the normalverse. There happy? Christ this is getting autistic.</br></br>  <br>What a piece of garbage, had to force myself through most of this season. A disgrace to Fate/Zero and the majority of season 1.</br>  <br>sevants are like pokemons, there are pokemosn agains which they are really good, others agains which they sux and her and there a couple than can beat the royal crap out of anyone</br>  <br>You just can handle the swag.</br>  <br>Archer pursued saving everyone as a goal, attributing inability to save everyone in lack of power. He pursued the goal of saving everyone endlessly with no regard to himself, with no regard to others, in the end relying on such a thing as a contract with the world as his hope of fulfilling it. However he never achieved it. His job as a Counter Guardian drove home the impossibility of saving everyone, no matter how much power you have. It made him think of his goal as pointless and futile.<br><br>UBW Shirou is NOT "saving everyone". He is "trying to". Within his limits. He knows that he won't always succeed and that there will be situations where he WONT be able to save everyone and he is okay with it as a matter of reality and he is not going to go beyond his own limits in his goal, because unlike for Archer, for UBW Shirou, LIVING by your ideal, TRYING to save everyone is beautiful and enough in itself. So he won't go to self-destructive lengths Archer went, he won't be making any deals with outside forces and he won't try to ACCOMPLISH ideal instead being content with living by it, understanding that ideals are impossible to accomplish(because they are ideals, an utopia)</br></br></br>  Could Archer kill Lancer if he somehow assassinated lancer with Caladbolg?    <br>Got the link of the opening?</br>  <br>A lightweight boxer with masterful technique can still lose to a heavyweight even if he packs more punch per pound.<br><br>Archer is skilled but has weak stats.

So that even if servants could qualify for Assassin, they were not allowed as it was set up to try to force them out of that class.<br><br>It was noted in F/SN that Heracles should be possible to summon as Assassin, but due to the way its set up it is supposed to deny him.<br><br>That was a rule set in place in only that contest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was asking about the lore explanation.<br><br><br>Thanks. Forgot all about that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man I want to see Blackbeard's third level form with the badass coat.</br>  Alexander the great, child form  <br>what a qt</br>  <br>I want to commit a crime</br>  <br>Two in the pink, one in the twink.</br>  <br>To explain the metaphysics why:<br>In the Great Grail ritual of Fuyuki, a catalyst is required to make a servant. In the event no catalyst is given, the summoner themself is made into a catalyst, and given a hero appropriate to their personality and mindset.<br>For Assassin class servants, a catalyst is already provided for you; nothing a magus can do will interfere with that. The word "Assassin" (from Hashashin [from either Hashish-in or Hassans-in], the arabic order) links to Hassan-i Sabbah, no way around it.<br><br>In the Moon Cell, no catalyst is required, one's servant is assigned by the SE.RA.PH. system.<br><br>We have no idea what's going down in Grand Order, but I'm willing to bet catalysts aren't involved there either.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> not webm  <br>one job</br></br>  <br>You know, hell is a lot more entertaining when you're not walking into it.</br>  <br> In the event no catalyst is given, the summoner themself is made into a catalyst, and given a hero appropriate to their personality and mindset. <br><br>That's something assumed by people, but its unconfirmed by Archer in UBW. He's all "No, catalyst is necessary, if you don't provide one the grail will find the closest thing nearby"<br><br>Its noted to date that all summonings in Fuyuki system have been with a catalyst, thus proving Archer's words even more true. People thought Sakura didn't use one or that Uryuu didn't use one, but they did.<br><br>It was noted that Uryuu's family were a family of mages previously even though he didn't entirely believe it. His sister was the one in the family that generation to be born with any magus talent, but he killed her. He fucked around for fun that the book he took from his home was a book of spells and evil, but in a sense it was true, even if it wasn't as direct of a catalyst as can be.<br><br>Note that this is only talking about the Fuyuki system, but to date a catalyst is always necessary there. Instances where it didn't seem like a catalyst was used, it was still used.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   kill Berserker six times <br><br>I really hate how anyone with multiple lives or massive endurance are just there to be punching bags for someone else to look good. Heracles should've steamrolled the competition considering he's as strong as Olympian gods even back when he was mortal.</br></br>  <br>It also just makes everything awkward when talking about power levels.<br><br>Archer killed Berserker six times, when Saber had trouble fighting him at all with out the graveyard advantage. Which kinda makes her look like shit.<br><br>I know circumstances, Nasu, rock paper scissor, w/e.<br><br>Discussing power levels is dumb.<br>Why do we keep doing it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> when Saber had trouble fighting him at all with out the graveyard advantage. <br>Isn't because Shirou Saber is shit while Rin Saber said to steam roll Berserker with ease?</br></br>  <br>Archer is lying out his ass and every other time it comes up before or after corroborates it.<br><br>No, Uryuu's book was not a catalyst. Both Urobuchi and Nasu said Ryuunosuke's personality was what called Gilles de Rais. "The book was a catalyst" is fanon bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>serious archer can kill caster<br>serious archer can kill gilgamesh<br>serious archer can kill saber<br>serious archer can kill rider, but everyone can lol<br>serious archer can kill fake assassin<br>maybe lancer if he does it quick enough<br>probably not berserker unless they had knowledge of his abilities and a plan</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Discussing power levels is dumb. <br> Why do we keep doing it? <br><br>People never get the greatest irony of TM, that power levels never meant anything from the start. Not in the "nasu a shit hack shit piece of shit" sort of way people seem to usually think, but more like "From the start it was a point that luck, strategy, and situation always beats power. If you know about your opponent and have time to plan, you can always overcome them<br><br>Its like how power levels in DBZ, the entire reason Toriyama introduced them was to show how unreliable they are. Yet people didn't get this, and thought "Woah, power level is everything"<br><br>Holy fuck, the irony is top class when F/SN demonstrates hundreds of times that its not power level that's important, and anyone can beat anyone basically yet thousands of threads later people still can't grasp that and instead just pale it off on the excuse "Well Nasu a shitty hack".<br><br>The writing isn't that complex, yet people miss even something this huge. There are a dozen variables that can change each battle, yet people realize the ones they want.<br><br>Like HF showed that Hassan could beat Saber in battle using tactics and experience, yet people bypass that one by going "Well he didn't directly beat her by punching her, it was shadow, so it doesn't count and it can never count, its shit".<br><br>That was directly an example of strategy and terrain being used in a smart way, Shadow would have just as soon killed him, yet people only count what they want.<br><br>Sasaki vs Saber, Lancer vs Archer, Saber vs Berserker in UBW, every fight shows how things can turn out so differently in different situations or why its different in that one situation to give someone more of an edge, yet people argue about power levels as if that's the main thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's hard to tell the gap between, them, the numbered stats Nasu vomits out mean jack shit, and Saber never really got to do much after becoming Rin's servant, she just fought Assassin again, and it kinda went them same, except his sword got bent, and she lucked out.</br>  <br> Archer vs. Assassin<br>Nasu-san CHECK!<br>If it's a straight out death match, then Archer will win. But Assassin is an oddity that fights under different battle conditions from the other Servants. While many Servants are offensive, Assassin is defensive. At a Servant-killing battlefield like Ryuudouji and with Caster's anti-sorcery defensive barrier, sorcery and Noble Phantasm power is decreased significantly. As a result, if it's not a powerful Noble Phantasm, then he won't take a fatal wound. Which means that the battle between the two is clearly swordsmanship. With Archer having his sniping sealed off to him due to the terrain effect, could Archer actually lose...?<br><br>Archer vs Rider<br>Nasu-san CHECK!<br>If you think about it, Archer will win, but at long range, Rider would be? Just like that question, their compatibility is not very good. Since both aren't fixated on the methods of winning, they'd definitely both choose a low-risk and high-return type of warfare.<br>Even if Archer takes out a Saber-class holy sword, he doesn't have enough Prana to draw on to maximize it, so it'd be hard to for him to attack Bellerophon. What determines victory or defeat is whether Aias on its own would be enough to block Bellerophon perhaps...?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Assassin vs True Assassin<br>Nasu-san CHECK!<br>If it's just Servant vs Servant, then without complaint, True Assassin would have the better chance of victory. Right, Kojirou doesn't have any means of breaking through Zabaniya. But there's more to it. The problem of Zabaniya is that it's not immediate death. If a normal heart gets destroyed by it, then the person dies immediately but the opponents are Servants. And especially against Kojirou, who has a strong spirit alignment, even if his heart is destroyed he still will have some fighting power left in him. Right in the interval after TA uses his Noble Phantasm, Assassin could close the gap and use Tsubame Gaeshi. Which means....it would be a draw since both of them would end up dead...?<br><br>Rider vs. Lancer<br>Nasu-san CHECK!<br>The two boasting the most outstanding speed in the game. Rider, able to move like a bullet and race around the battle field vs Lancer, able to counter attackers with a lance with the speed of gods, while standing still. In average speed, Rider is faster, but in immediate maximum output, Lancer will win. While Rider has several different types of Noble Phantasms, Lancer also has protective ability from rune sorcery, hence counter measures from her mystic eyes. Against an expert monster exterminator like Lancer, one who has a monster alignment such as Rider might seem to be in for a tough fight....!?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't Rin Saber pretty much Shirou Saber since Rin had to share mana with Shirou too?</br>  come on it's time to stop these cancer threads  <br> At a Servant-killing battlefield like Ryuudouji and with Caster's anti-sorcery defensive barrier, sorcery and Noble Phantasm power is decreased significantly <br><br>i dont remember they mentioning this on the VN<br><br>RETCON RETCON</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, she was called super super better, but all she really did when she was super mode was nearly lose to Assassin.</br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br>The anti servant battlefield was stressed multiple times, explaining why people can't just go around Assassin or blow him up from afar.<br>The defensive barrier negating magecraft never came up, though.</br></br>  <br>Are you being serious or a joke?</br>  The autism is ripe in this thread.  <br> serious archer can kill gilgamesh <br>wasnt she saving the extra mana to use excalibur?</br></br>  <br> can't go into seed mode </br>  <br>Its not about extra mana<br><br>Saber was called like a hundred times better in stats.<br><br>However if you're talking about why Saber didn't use Excalibur, its because she admits she'd be dead before she could charge it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>more like hte wind thingy</br>  <br>1-Nasu is a hack<br>2- Archer could stand a chance of winning sniping everyone from 40km away instead of playing with swords.</br></br>  <br>Terrain<br><br>She'd be dead in the same way as if she used Excalibur as well, and its doubtful it could kill him.</br></br></br>  <br> serious archer can kill caster <br>He literally had to try not to kill her, so yes.<br> serious archer can kill gilgamesh <br>Sketchy as fuck. UBW is faster than GoB, but it doesn't have spaceships. Also, as always when discussing Goldie Ea &gt; The world.<br> serious archer can kill saber <br>He can go for a mutual kill by confronting excalibur with excalibur, yes. He can kill Saber Alter with the 6-fold attack, yes. He can also snipe her for fucking ever, but any misstep and he is dead. He can't take Saber 1v1 head on.<br> serious archer can kill rider, but everyone can lol <br>Actually, he would be in pretty fucking deep shit. Medusa with sakura has some nice buffs to combat, and once she summons pegasus, she has dragon-level defense, so most of his attacks wouldn't work.<br> serious archer can kill fake assassin <br>Meh. The location limits his angles of attack, and Fakie canonically drove off Berserker, so that would be a pretty tough fit.<br> maybe lancer if he does it quick enough <br>Unless Archer goes full asshole with the Geas exploitation, winning is going to be difficult.<br> probably not berserker unless they had knowledge of his abilities and a plan <br>Well, "serious archer" is already taking in account archer coming in with a plan, if it's just Archer pulling all stops but without a clearly defined plan, he probably would only kill caster. But anyway yeah, Berserker would wreck his shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Excalibur from the base of the stairs would absolutely kill him, the question is if Saber would survive the magical energy expenditure. The defensive terrain and barrier can only do so much, it's not going to halt the second strongest noble phantasm in existence.</br>  <br>Nah, supplying mana aside she's much better as a master. There's a stat sheet that gets posted all the time, take a look at it.</br>  <br>that blast risk killing shinji too, making the whole save plan moot.<br><br>said plan is stupid anyway, who the fucks care for shinji</br></br></br>  This needs to get updated.  <br> He can go for a mutual kill by confronting excalibur with excalibur <br><br>Are you fucking autistic?, The swords he projects are the same one but one rank less<br><br> Then how he can block all the gilgamesh attacks? <br><br>It's Nasu, ain't gonna explain shit, you dumb faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Not him but wtf does Nasu mean</br>  could lancer without geass kill everyone? gae bolg is op as fuck    <br>i read this as <br> that blast risk killing shinji too, making the whole plan to save moot. <br><br>fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br>better be bait</br>  <br>?<br>They ARE decreased by one rank. Until he breaks them, which raises them by one rank again, restoring their original power.<br><br>Not for excalibut though, it is still kinda out of his reach.<br><br>Anyway, it is explicitely stated that he could recreate an excalibur within UBW and that the resulting clash would wipe them both out.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He'd have the fight of his life on his hands dealing with Herakles, one wrong move and he's dead.<br>Gil would never let him use it.<br>Artoria may survive a second time.</br></br></br>  <br>Japanese for lurk more.</br>  <br><br>Nasu means Anus in Japanese</br></br>  <br>If that were the case then she would have done that, she wouldn't even go up the stairs, she would have blasted the grail from half the town away.<br><br>That is not the case<br><br>Which is why she did not do that. Rin said she had enough mana for Saber to use Excalibur at most twice, not once.<br><br>Thinking its the best NP in existence aside from Ea is assuming a lot as well. Even whether Ea is at the top is a question; in the sense that its for sure called in the top class of NPs at least, but not at the very top. People assume Excalibur is the bester because it was originally called comparable to Ea if not a bit weaker. There could be others within that same gap as well however that are comparable in the same way. It never said that it was "directly right below nothing is between them", it just said they're comparable. Even though we know beam mode isn't Ea's real power.<br><br>CCC has a few NPs like that; an Anti Planet NP that can damage even Aristotles as noted, an NP that is the authority of all divine spirits combined to warp reality to the whims of the user with no limit, and something that encompasses all of human history to forceful reincarnate the opponent in a way that's said to be absolute.<br><br>To say Excalibur is the absolute besterest aside from Ea, is an absurd wank. No Garden of Avalon did not say what you think it said, I've read that part as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Anyway, it is explicitely stated that he could recreate an excalibur within UBW and that the resulting clash would wipe them both out. <br>He openly admits he would not "wipe out" Saber at all in their exchange. Their exchange would cause Archer to be blown away and Saber to be untouched.<br>The only reason the threat worked is that the backlash of two holy swords impacting each other would certainly kill Rin and Shirou who were in the reality marble with them.</br></br></br>  <br>Nasu is a servant called Nostradamus</br>  <br> They ARE decreased by one rank. Until he breaks them, which raises them by one rank again, restoring their original power. <br><br>That takes thirty seconds you fuck, no he's not spam breaking shit, that takes way too much energy from him.<br><br>Its noted that Hrunting is a relatively easy one to break, and it still takes him a bit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I swear it's not. Hardly ever go on this board but peruse sometimes like now when im high. But yeah teach me your ways</br></br>  <br>Nasu Kinoko was the scenario creator and lead writer for Type-Moon and Fate/stay night, Tsukihime, Kara no Kyoukai, Mahou Tsukai no Yoru, etc</br>  <br> CCC has a few NPs like that; an Anti Planet NP that can damage even Aristotles as noted, an NP that is the authority of all divine spirits combined to warp reality to the whims of the user with no limit, <br>Those are not real noble phantasms and you know it. The ones to use them are not even real servants.</br></br>  <br>If this isn't some gay bait, either I'm too out of it to remember or I just did not notice him there. Unless he was in HF because I haven't seen that</br>  <br>Even with Geass, Lancer can kill caster, archer, fake and true assassin and rider unless she is mounting pegasus.<br><br>This leaves Gil, which has an coffer full of Cu's weaknesses (even without geass he still has divinity, and I'm sure there must be a spear of leotard slaying somewhere inside GoB), trinkets to avoid the instant death, etc...<br><br>Berserker can straight up soak Gae Bolg hits until the heat death of the universe, so no.<br><br>Saber can win the coin toss, probably repeatedly. And since they both need time to charge up their NP, if they fire at the same time and she survives, Lancer is going to get blasted to oblivion, while he has no way to avoid excalibur.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If Archer projected a beam sword, could he activate it's NP effect well he is actively levitating it?<br><br>Like well he was fighting just have it float above them and then blast someone like an automated sentry?</br></br>  <br> People assume Excalibur is the bester because it was originally called comparable to Ea if not a bit weaker. There could be others within that same gap as well however that are comparable in the same way. It never said that it was "directly right below nothing is between them", it just said they're comparable. Even though we know beam mode isn't Ea's real power. <br>Excalibur is right below Ea's real power in terms of output.<br>Destroying the world does not increase Ea's output, it is a side effect. Excalibur on max output is right beside Ea on max output, just a notch below.<br><br>And Amita Amitabha takes seven turns to activate. It might deal 6 billion damage but it's not practical.</br></br></br></br></br>  I understand rivalries like Seiba vs Gil and Alex vs Darius, I don't get why Jeanne vs AACHA, unless it's just for the white haired brown man in red.  <br> &gt;Berserker can straight up soak Gae Bolg hits until the heat death of the universe, so no. <br><br>People should really learn to check out official word on the subject rather than assuming.<br><br> Q. Lancer, Caster, Assassin, and True Assassins; all with normal attack and Noble Phantasms of B or lower. If they fought against Berserker, wouldn't it be a one-sided fight? Or are there any of them that can match up against him? <br> A: Assassin and True Assassin by themselves wouldn't even be a fight. Lancer can use his runes and Noble Phantasm together to temporarily raise the rank to A, but it'd still be a very disadvantageous fight but "one with some chances". Caster has two front-line Saber-class defenders, so if she uses her high sorcery then she'd be able to deal damage, but that would be limited to 2 to 3 times. Also, in the game, Assassin was able to push Berserker back because of the terrain advantage and support from Caster (weighing down Berserker's body). ...Well, since the compatibility of Assassin and Berserker is horrible, the fact that Berserker was even pushed back is enough to say "whoah, Kojirou's amazing". <br><br>Lancer can kill Heracles entirely, but its a very uphill fight where he doesn't stand a high chance.<br><br>However there are a few chances.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Wait, so I got it backwards...?<br><br>Well, time for meto check the VN. But if you've got the quote, do feel free to post it.</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you but what did he mean by it's Nasu, ain't gonna explain. Sorry just the way he used it threw me off, as if it was an object or something.

Same situation as Apoc.    <br>They were just kinda the odd people out.<br><br>Should have had Lancer instead of Jeanne, but she is a blonde swordswoman, so gets priority.</br></br></br>  <br>So I completely hallucinated the whole "immunizing himself to what killed him once" requiring either a fucking one hit multi-kill, or 12/13 different ways to kill him?<br><br>Unless Lancer can infuse his spear with each rune and it counts as a different way each time...<br><br>But yeah, didn't keep myself up to date with the interviews, my bad.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> "Yes. Do not use your holy sword, Saber. I will have to oppose you if you do. <br> In that case, the ones to disappear would not be us, but the people around us. <br> …Knowing you, you would protect that kid at the cost of your own life. Even I will die if I project the holy sword. <br> In that case, only Emiya Shirou would survive. That would be pointless." <br><br>Apparently it's not that Saber's NP will overpower his, but the cost of using it will kill him.<br>Saber would sacrifice herself for Shirou, otherwise she'd be the last one standing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Saber still had a plenty of mana. Shirou Saber literally had no mana coming from him.</br>  <br>This has to be bait...<br><br>In the off chance that it's not, yes, you're right. The original sentence is "It's magic, I ain't gonna explain shit" it was reworded to suit the situation.</br></br></br>  <br> So I completely hallucinated the whole "immunizing himself to what killed him once" requiring either a fucking one hit multi-kill, or 12/13 different ways to kill him? <br><br>That is still in place, but you've forgotten the whole "Can be killed multiple times at once if you go beyond his threshold of pain enough, when you kill him".<br><br>Caliburn killed him seven times at once, partially charged Excalibur killed him three times.<br><br>Gae Bolg has a chance of killing him all at once, or its just a special situation with this weapon.<br><br>Likely he needs to raise his strength big time to throw his spear hard enough to entirely kill Herc in one go.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   2738 attack <br> 4069 HP <br>What has this shota motherfucker been eating, those stats are absurd</br></br>  <br>That's what threw me off. Or more specifically, how in the name of fuck is she not dying if she doesn't protect Shirou? She outruns the explosion? A bubble of untouched space forms (like the eye of a typhoon) as she is the source of one of the two forces? But then why doesn't she calmly take a few steps sideways, puts Shirou behind her and exclaims "Checkmate motherfucker! -sorry Iri-?"</br>  <br>Promise it's not im sorry I was just really stoned earlier and its 2:48AM where I am and yeah. I hardly have any attention span so everything is wtf to me right now.</br>  <br>It's fucking Romulus it says so write on the card.</br>  <br>Probably a safe space is created behind her noble phantasm, in the same way she was protected momentarily from Enuma Elish in the Fate route.<br>The bubble would be small and envelop around her, and she wouldn't have time to stand right above Shirou, I guess?</br></br>  <br>*right</br>  <br>Well, thanks for the clarification! My bad, I was wrong.<br><br>So it boils down to command spells once again...</br></br></br>  <br> So it boils down to command spells once again... <br><br>No, its more about rune magic to boost himself, and bet it all on one chance to finish this guy all at once, perhaps.<br><br>Command seal doesn't really play into this.<br><br>Its still a low chance, but its "a chance". If he regens from Gae Bolg and becomes immune then he might be stuck, but we also know that Gae Bolg works in a bit of a special way, so its hard to say entirely.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>porn of her when?</br>  <br>Although, a command spell would raise that chance decently.</br>  <br>Don't forget Cu would have to know about God Hand ahead of time to even bother.<br>What's most likely in a clash between the two is him using Gae Bolg without rune enhancement and accomplishing jack shit for being B rank.</br></br>  <br>From the wiki page of Romulus and Remus<br>  Their mother was Rhea Silvia, daughter of Numitor, king of Alba Longa. Before their conception, Numitor's brother Amulius seized power, killed Numitor's male heirs and forced Rhea Silvia to become a Vestal Virgin, sworn to chastity. Rhea Silvia conceived the twins by the god Mars, or by the god Hercules. <br><br>Mars/Ares is the half-brother of Hercules/Heracles so depending on which story Nasu decides to go with he is either the nephew or the son of Herc.</br></br></br></br>  Can the gang of Robin Hoods take on the King of Heroes?  <br>Well, the "do one action really, really, really hard" sounded like a job for a command spell to me.<br>"Lancer, wreck his shit with one spear throw."<br><br>If Lancer is still working for Kirei, that shady priest can even afford to make it double, raising Lancer's odds spectacularly.<br><br>But yeah, on it's own it's, like often with Cu, a coin toss.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Could Iskandar's army?</br>  <br>In CCC they meet and fight a few times<br><br>Gilgamesh acknowledges him in a small way.</br></br></br>  <br>Surely the Robin Hoods won't run in a straight line in a bright desert.</br>  <br>Robin Hood gains a bonus against an army</br>  <br>Well shit, I didn't know that. My bad. That's interesting.</br>  <br>Shirou, Sakura, Issei, etc.</br>  <br> Archer :: Of course I’m a subordinate. But, well, what’s wrong with it? I never had any contract saying “you can’t hand out detailed data on your employer.” I just had a spare moment or two and I looked into it. Bad habits from life just don’t fade, do they. If nothing else, I’ve always been praised for my peeping habit, if I do say so myself. It was free of charge, so I’ll give it to you cheap. In exchange — yeah, that’s about right. The life of the one who ruined this Grail War will do fine. We might’ve been defeated, but this was my master’s battle. …It’s no good for one stupid person’s desires to stomp all over that. <br><br> …was that it? Though BB held his life, he didn’t sell himself. Just like the other Servants, he was showing his loyalty to his Master. <br><br> Gilgamesh :: Your character aside, your Master was a respected military man, was he not. Teaching a man with nothing but his tricks to boast of to see the righteous path…For a rat, you were able to serve a good master. <br><br> Archer :: No way, the old man was a terrible nag, nothing but complaints. He was set to die for his stupid convictions all the way through to the end. But well, it’s the kind of thing you’d think would be a bit much for his age? Playing the knight won’t earn you so much as a penny, and he’d still give his life for it, so how could I laugh at that? …well, you know. I guess in some ways he was too much for me as a Master. <br><br> Gilgamesh :: Hah, so you’re the only one who doesn’t know, then. A cornered rat bites the cat. The “rat” is an ally of the weak who fights against the system — another name for an idiot knight. You, your Master, both of you are most whimsical. There is no living thing as fortunate as a man who can be intoxicated by his own beliefs, is there, Archer. <br><br>He's a guy that despite not being seen as the strongest, managed to piss off each of your servants, BB, and basically everyone else. He's an annoying type of guy that can poke at people quite well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, they would hide and be sneaky basterds. As long as the enemy doesn't have a long range anti-army noble phantasm, they're good.<br><br>They can't do much to some faggot sipping wine on his golden throne upon his golden flying ship, shooting golden treasures out of golden warpgates.<br><br>That's not even counting that hiding yourself is slightly difficult when your opponent has a world destroying attack. Well, technically you'll remain unseen, but it won't do you a fuckload of good.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have any more?</br>  He'd probably be broken as fuck with enough mana from Alaya, but he's a low-tier servant.  <br> Faceless King [Noble Phantasm] <br> No Face May King. Green Archer's hidden Noble Phantasm. <br> Robin Hood is an incarnation of nature, introduced and inherited as a custom of the Celts from the (Spring Festival) Beltane Festival after the establishment of the "May Festival." <br> In this festival, they make a circle and dance around a pillar built in the center of the village square where a boy who is almost a man impersonates the "May King" and a girl who is almost a woman impersonates the "May Queen." <br>This "May King" is a metaphor for Robin Hood. At this festival, the May King magic costume of green skin is just clothing with ordinary brown accents. &gt;Needless to say, with these leaves and brown stems (Green Man), Robin Hood is definitely the incarnation of nature.<br> Wearing the May King costume erases any sign, so that those who wear it naturally melt into that appearance. <br> With this, Robin Hood holds the same level of ability as the Fairy Puck. <br> Said to be stronger than the Bow of Prayer on the back of Green Archer's hand. Disables the reading of each other in battle, a one-sided victory cheat item. <br> Robin is a sniper who hides his figure in this cloak, appearing with Assassin-like behavior. Because it aggravates the Master, Dan, the use of "Faceless King" was forbidden outside of combat. <br> Even in CCC, where it saw a surprising usage, its results were disappointing in Passionlip's hands.  <br><br>This is the NP he was disallowed to use in Extra original due to a command seal<br><br>Its a perfect sort of cheat item, you know its serious business when it says it puts the user at the same level as a fairy in terms of hiding, especially a high level fairy. Even your servant ingame comments that he's pretty much perfectly concealed when he uses it, as they cannot detect him anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> shota <br>she prefers loli, check your privilege</br></br>  <br>Rho Aias is still just a shield.

The average human in Gil's time would be a lot stronger than them.</br>  <br>Mary Antoinette is a rider  of my dick </br>  <br>Just stop posting.

It can't be helped. Rin's perfect.</br>  <br>In Gil's time people didn't have toilet paper.</br>  <br> today's standards are so low that people as weak as Shirou and Bazett are now considered strong </br>  What's the deal with Grand Order and it's long list of Servants?    <br>Then he isn't a Servant he's a CG.</br>  stop posting fanfiction FSN is the only canon  Does he mean Caren or Bazett?  <br>suspension of disbelief sets in when archer does have the disposition to actually take on any servant but doesn't, solely for the sake of plot convenience. his skill set is broke as fuck.</br>  <br>Shiro and Bazzet are powerful, gil grudge was that it was 2 among 7 billions, there were many many many many trash in the world so he wanted to filter it out<br><br>well rather EMIYA is strong, shiro is just rock paper scissor to Gil + Gil Ego</br></br></br>  <br>Shirou has crazy potential, especially his UBW incarnation. He should have more weapons than Archer does at the end of the route.</br>  <br>if it was any other servant than saber, he wouldnt have spaced out and have gotten got like that in those two routes.</br>  <br>He can replicate any noble phantasm, they don't have to be blades but they have a massive mana cost.</br>  <br> Archer loses almost instantly in two routes <br><br>He kills fucking Heracles six times, and his left arm basically saves the world in HF.</br></br></br>  <br>And they say pleasing old men for money is just a meme</br>  <br>She doesn't please old men, she pleases Alaya.</br>  <br>She pleases old men for money to pay her denbts to Alaya.</br>  <br> not posting him praising the sun </br>  <br>Alaya is the will of all old men.</br>  <br>I might be wrong here, but as I remember all he can replicate is shields (but it burns a lot of mana) or whatever fits the idea of SWORD that shiro has (an edge close range weapon) which by being a little louse, let him trace swords, dagger, lances, axes, anything with an edge, but he cant trace blunt weapons, nor anything divine, or from materials shiro dont know about <br><br><br>Potential, thats it, but not at 16, the only reason he could hold it against other master in hte war and shit, was cause that connection that let him absorb (or whatever) archers skills and experience the more he fought him</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not true at all.<br><br>The concept of war didn't even exist in Gil's time much less professional soldiers.<br><br>Everyone was so chill that instead of an angry mob with torches, Uruk just sent an unarmed prostitute to deal with Enkidu.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but that boost gave him an insane jump start. It's said it would take Fate Shirou 10 years to unlock his RM, and this Shirou's already got his. Plus with the weapons and skills from fighting Archer in general, as well as whatever extra knowledge he managed to gleam at The Clock Tower, and he's in an okay state.</br>  <br>If I was participating in a Holy Grail War this is who I would summon just to fuck around with before I am assassinated by someone.</br>  <br>Let's say he decided to win the war first, would he be able to do it?</br>  <br>still doubt it, he only could use the RM cause Rins mana, he can trace individual weapons, but he cant pull UBW on its own,<br><br>even EMIYA, he has to make the pact with World to get the boost that will later on/ eventually get the status of hero. <br><br>shiro on its own, as human being, dont have hte mana or circuits enough to become EMIYA, no without external help/ boost. both Rin and Weaver said so, you can just magically grow your mana pool. thats why legacy and bloodlines were sooooo important in magic world</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bazett.<br>On an FHA note, can anybody explain to me why  Caren loved Avenger? <br><br>That H scene came out of nowhere and shattered the tone, at least, in my eyes.<br><br>Was it rape?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Filling the eroge quota.</br>  <br>Archer was able to cast UBW in life. Fate Shirou, we know will be able to use UBW to its full potential within 20 years. UBW Shirou is far beyond Fate Shirou, and far beyond Archer at this point in his life.<br><br>You're underestimating the guy pretty badly. I mean we know from Nasu that he's supposed to go beyond Archer. It's not stated in what ways exactly, but he's gonna do better.</br></br></br>  <br>It's even more obvious when the whole Master-Servant synergy is brought about. Having a master with ample source of mana or not, being on the same wavelenght or having totally differents strategies in mind.<br>This side of the war take a really big part of the story and is for me a clear attempt at shutting down any try of powerlevel comparison.</br></br>  <br> Archer was able to cast UBW in life. <br>after he got a boost from the pact. <br><br>he got a power up while alive, not after becoming a CG</br></br></br></br>  <br>Q: In Saber Route, Shirou did not encounter Archer's Reality Marble "Unlimited Blade Works" and certainly did not learn it. If he were to train and attempt to develop it by himself, how long would it take?<br><br>A: Ten years to master the basics, another ten years to become proficient at it.<br>... something like that. <br><br>It doesn't matter if it came from the pact or not, we know Shirou is capable of unlocking it and using it proficiently on his own within his own lifetime. UBW Shirou has already got the basics, so he should be pretty solid with it by the time he's in his mid-20s.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did nasu address the same issue regarding HF Shirou?</br>  <br>Unfortunately no. All we have is that if he trains, he should be able to unlock. No time frame on how long it would take.</br>  <br>probably sooner than fate id imagine, since he at least knows he has a reality marble and has seen archers though, he couldn't use it.</br>  Why didn't Lancer disarm Archer 27 times in their second fight?  <br>both were now serious. or her swords break off screen</br>  <br>The anime changed the second fight by quite a bit</br>  <br>It was Lancer's turn to job</br>  <br><br><br>HF Shirou can't summon UBW. He discards it along with his idea of hero of justice. He isn't looking at the same scenery than his counterparts, so he can't reach UBW.<br><br>So unlocking his RM should take him about as long as Fate Shirou, and it wouldn't be UBW.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> HF Shirou can't summon UBW. <br>Shirou can't pull Archer's version of Unlimited Blade Works out of his arm any more than UBW Shirou could access Archer's version of Unlimited Blade Works by watching him invoke it<br>They're different people who have lived different lives, their inner worlds are different. None of Shirous from any route or continuity have the same version of Unlimited Blade Works</br></br></br>  Archer's UBW<br>UBW Shirou's UBW</br>  <br>Fate Shirou's UBW? At least that's the UBW from Last Episode I believe.<br><br>Question would be what HF Shirou's UBW would look like.</br></br></br>  <br>Archer's and UBW Shirou's are so similar however , that Shirou gets to have some sort of control upon the sword in Archer's UBW, and materialize his own version after seeing it a few times and being provided mana by Tohsaka.<br><br>HF Shirou is awesome in all the right ways and my favorite Shirou, but he doesn't have that move, nor show interest in developing it.</br></br></br>  <br>Really? It felt like the most fitting sex scene in all Fate works to me.<br><br> Caren loved Avenger? <br>Her dad is Kotomine Kieri. Is it that surprising that she falls in love with all the evils of the world?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's surprising when the extent of their interaction is;<br> lol u r shit at the organ <br> being a nun sounds shit <br> imma rape you now <br><br>And really? I always felt like HF had the most fitting H scenes. It's why I am absolutely dreading Ufotable's HF. Seeing Sakura sucking Shirou's blood or some dumb shit is going to give me such anal pain.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well that's probably how it's gonna go down. All the versions of FSN they're advertising are the RN version.</br>  <br>Yup</br>  <br> Avenger is under stress <br> he doesn't know how to act around Caren, which makes him even more hostile <br> he makes threats constantly <br> she teases him because she enjoys his pain <br> he snaps and fucks the shit out of her and calms down afterward <br><br>I wouldn't call it rape. It's like she wanted him to do it to relieve himself so she kept tempting him, because he needed it to see clearly. And considering the way she was raised, she probably considered guiding Avenger her job and relieving him is part of that process.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you think Archer is so weak,<br>could Shiki kill Archer?</br></br>  <br> lol u r shit at the organ <br> being a nun sounds shit <br> imma rape you now <br>That's so very japanese.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bow &gt; Knife<br><br><br>Isn't it though? Although neither of them are.<br><br><br>I guess I just didn't pick up on any of that at all until the moment he stripped her down.<br><br>The fact that she was having talons about to burst out of her at any minute made it a lot less sexy, also.<br>I really liked the image of them ascending together, but it was kind of ruined by the earlier scene. Their relationship definitely needed work.<br><br>Also;<br> All these scenes are totally how Shirou would have acted because 0 + 1 = 1 <br> Now I will proceed to bully Caren and sexually assault her : ^ ) <br><br>Okay Nasu</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What does this screen mean?  <br>Need to update to latest version I think.</br>  <br> The fact that she was having talons about to burst out of her at any minute made it a lot less sexy, <br>Are you gay? A nun about to explode while getting fucked like an animal by All the Evils of the World and enjoying it is kinda hot.</br></br>  <br>Fuck. Does it automatically update over Qooapp? I hardly understand how any of this works at all honestly.</br>  <br>Will Sakura and Shirou kiss?</br>  <br>Uninstall it and download and install it again. Even though it says original version on qooapp once you start the game it is updated, at least fo rme.</br>  <br>I am the spider that set this web.-----Welcome to this wonderful killing chamber.</br>  <br>Thank you, anon</br>  This is your departure from this life. You should take a good look at the world you lived in, the world where your regrets will linger.  <br>No he salty because there's more than like 20 people. Because Mesopotamia was a shit hole and the indus valley is where the real nggas were at back then.</br>  <br> dude weed lmao I'm so high xDD <br>Fuck off</br></br>  <br> you'll never see those two broing it up by some strange twist of fate and hunting super monsters <br><br>I'd love to see that just for banter and Archer projecting cool weapons for Shiki to use</br></br></br>  why isn't el cid a servant yet?  <br>HE HATES IT.</br>  <br>Because he beat the shit out of heracles, killing him SIX times. That's something nobody else did in the three route. Well not counting Gilgamesh that killed him completely. <br><br>Saber and Shirou had to get power of plot powerup to finish heracles and in HF Shirou was powered up by ARCHER's arm.<br><br>Also secondary, he sniped the shit out of everyone in HA</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This.<br><br>Put Archer on top of a skyscraper and he becomes fucking top tier.</br></br></br>  <br>Didn't Shirou kill Heracles 9 times with Archer's arm?<br><br>So Archer even outdid himself in a later route.</br></br></br>  <br>It was a corrupted Heracles without his NP</br>  <br>Fuck off, faggot.</br>  yo why the FUCK is this game stuck at 100%  <br>Archer had everything to lose Against Heracles yet he fought and killed him six times. Saber can't do shit Against Heracles melee and she's GODDAMN SABER, Archer is a fucking Archer that's supposed to snipe people and play with tacticts, yet he managed to do more than Saber ever did without Plot power.<br><br>It goes like this<br> Kills berserker 6 times making he regain his lucidness and wish he wasn't insane so that he could fight Archer's swordmanship because it's just fucking Amazing, let's remember again that his class is ARCHER, he wasn't supposed to fight melee against fucking Berserker, he was supposed to snipe and if he did he could've killed him more, fought in bad ground for him and still kicked ass. <br> Did this without using UBW that while Nasu says wouldn't be a big thing against most servants is still a GREAT way of getting a few seconds with swordspam so that he can manage a few batman tactics. And of course gives him free mana projections as long as it's activated. <br>I want to clarify that Nasu says only UBW wouldn't kill servants, it's obviously a different story if the user gets it to work around battle strategies.<br><br> Gave his Arm to Shirou and with that Shirou saved the world, oh and beat motherfucking Berserker. HIS ARM, nobody else's.  <br><br> Sniped everyone in Hollow Ataraxia and made Lancer sleep in the woods for fear of being headshotted. FUCKING LANCER, CU CHULAINN who projectiles are not supposed to work against  <br><br> &gt;Only good at talking trash and threatening other servants as though he is that strong. <br><br>Na fuck off with your shit bait. Secondary shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They did in RN. If they change things up a tad for the movies and not use pure RN, it'll be great.<br><br>Plus, they need to use that new design from GO for her, with her wearing glasses in the HF True epilogue, doing her job as Supervisor. We may even finally see her teacher Dilo, hopefully he is a badass priest, given nearly every church member is.<br><br>And maybe, hope against hope, a mini-story of Shirou and Sakura touring the underground to find Shirou a better body. Maybe these Grand Order cards are from that magic tourney to raise money Rin talked about in True, and she changed her mind. Give Rider a new outfit Sakura, we know you like dressing her up.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sakura is cute as fuck.</br>  <br>Since when were you under the impression that Archer killing Berserker 6 times is itself not plot armor?</br>   I see. Then wait until this is over. I will give her to you after I kill Emiya Shirou. <br>She is mine until then. It cannot be helped if you cannot compromise on that. It will be regrettable, but you will die here, Gilgamesh.<br><br>Archer running his mouth as usual. What if Gilgamesh decided to call his bluff?<br><br>And this Archer without a master, depleted mana and only surviving on independent action.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Archer didn't have anything to lose at that point. His top priority was to fuck Shirou's shit up or die trying.</br>  <br>Yet Gilgamesh king of heroes went out of his way to kill this "Faker" by backstabbing him. Oh and he fucking failed.<br>Same Gilgamesh that isn't supposed to take "Mongrels" seriously, backstabbing one of those "Mongrels" because of FEAR.<br><br>King of shitters</br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw Shielder this whole opening <br><br>jesus christ she's doing strange things for my heart and dick</br></br></br>  Anybody else terrified about the HF film?<br><br>UBW was good, but it's a whole different thing to HF. I literaly cannot see this adaptation going well.</br></br>  <br> UBW was good <br>Yeah it wasn't a good adaptation. <br><br> Anybody else terrified about the HF film? <br>And yes I am. If they try doing it in a few movies it will be guaranteed shit. <br>HF is the longest of all the routes and the best of them all, doing it in 1-3 movies will cut the story in half and feel rushed as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel like UBW was a fair adaptation. What, aside from Archer vs Shirou, wasn't good?</br>  <br> Yeah it wasn't a good adaptation.  <br><br>It was an amazing adaptation. I have no clue what I could have wanted more with it.</br></br></br>  <br>Because he died. It's Shirou's plot armor.</br>  <br>I think he could easily murder all masters, but he knows the whole thing is fucked and you can't actually win</br>  <br>It's funny he himself admits he isn't even close yet you see EMIYAfags trying to argue he can beat Lancelot. He might have a chance, but that chance is as small as the chance Cu would have against Heracles.</br>  <br> Cu against Heracles <br>MUH RUNES</br></br>  Fate/Stay Night is a gateway visual novel of the worst kind. It's a bad VN, a clusterfuck of story and characterization that isn't very well done by any aspect, but which attempts to compensate for its weaknesses by adding in excessive powerlevel faggotry and DARKNESS. The normal anon can see this as the shit it is, and may enjoy it, hate it or be indifferent to it, but all the while recognizing that the VN itself, regardless of their opinion, is plain bad.<br><br>However, these very aspects that try to smear over the shit of its core make it a breeding ground for aspie, unsociable underageb&amp; faggots who engage in every kind of faggotry both online and in the real world. The superpowered characters all trying their hardest to look cool, the Noble Phantasms, ridiculous, color-coded clothes, the whole Servant faggotry and everything about the Fate/Stay Night world fuels their escapist fantasies, while the pity-party character backgrounds, emphasis on heroism, and overall chuuni tone of the VN makes it fit just right with the mary-sueish drives of your average preteen and his sense of unwarranted self-importance towards the world. Exactly the kind of shit that makes little kiddies and underageb&amp; retards eat this shit right the fuck up.<br><br>Fate/Stay Night is basically THE series to attract the most hated VN fanbase known to /a/, which is why, regardless of individual opinions, it is the responsibility of every anon to troll the fuck out of this show and everyone who likes it, and ensure that no Fate/Stay Night threads ever encourage the newfriends to show their faces here.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Mostly Shirou. The story goes around him, if you fuck him up then it just doesn't feel good now does it. The fact that in the end of season 1 he looked like a retard making it his fault for Saber being captured was retarded. Also a personal preference is that they shouldn't have cut the <br> If she is going to move and put Fuji-nee in danger <br> I will _____ Tohsaka <br><br>Medea's master, Illya's backstory. <br>Cutting stuff and adding anime original wasn't needed. <br>Now about Shirou again:<br>The monologues are needed and no 1 episode(after Illya's death) showing Shirou being a retard doesn't explain well to animeonly that he's a retard, you can notice that when Animeonlyfags still don't get what Shirou's problem is. VN readers think this is enough because they already know it but it isn't. My cousin watched it with me and then read the VN when it ended, he went from "this dude is annoying" to "this dude is fucked in the head"<br> <br>Archer vs Shirou is one of the key moments if not THE key moment so it being bad doesn't help either. <br><br>Bad OST, or should I say the OST wasn't there in the moments it should? Dunno how to explain. <br><br>All in all it wasn't bad, but it was mediocre when it could've been much better if they explained shit. <br><br>Oh another personal preference, making as if Gil survived on his own against Shirou when th grail actually saved him from being beheaded was just pandering to Gilfags</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's no way you are gettin me down in that cellar until this thread is fortified so those things can't get in!</br>  <br>so pic related is Archer?</br>  <br>MUHRUNES DAGON</br>  <br>Pandering to Gilfags is neccessary, with FZ fans coming in. The whiplash as they see his character here is still delicious.<br><br>The OST is indeed as bland as most Kaijura stuff is, without any hits like The Battle Is To The Strong. Though I have to say, listening to the OST alone, some songs seemed really good, but I don't remember them from the show at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Hey, never underestimate dead parents!</br>    <br>That utter look of disgust.<br><br> went full bara </br></br></br>  <br>Oh Jesus. I love the complaint of "monologues".<br><br>What monologues. What was missing. You can't just say they should have added monologues without pinpointing what was wrong. Did you want them to just fucking narrate everything? There's a point where you have to realize this is not a book. It's a visual medium. Where didn't they get Shirou's characterization right? Because Nasu's gone on record outright saying the anime is closer to his original vision. If that's the case, you have to start questioning things.<br><br><br> Medea's master, Illya's backstory. <br> Cutting stuff and adding anime original wasn't needed.  <br><br>They gave a character who has a massive presence in UBW a fleshed out backstory, and they did the absolute best they could with Ilya. They connected her story to Zero out of necessity. There was no Fate route to connect the character to the viewers, so they conncted her to Zero, and had sympathy be drawn from her being Kerry's daughter. <br><br> Archer vs Shirou is one of the key moments if not THE key moment so it being bad doesn't help either.  <br><br>Love the consensus here that it was just "bad". What was wrong with it? You gonna bring up giant swords? Get mad that they had the big climactic battle of UBW, in UBW?<br><br> Bad OST, or should I say the OST wasn't there in the moments it should? Dunno how to explain.  <br><br>The OST was written in an entirely different way than your typical anime, so it may seem jarring to you, but it was actually on a pure technical level an achievement. Fukasawa wrote over 400 compositions to the series and gave original music to almost every scene instead of reusing tracks.<br><br>One legitimate complaint is that the music was mixed quieter in the broadcast version. Have you watched the BD episodes?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This does things to my dick.</br>  <br>I can see why she needs such a large shield to protect her from damage. She is almost naked</br>  <br>The whiplash when they see him getting rekt by Sakura in 2 seconds will be better. Also pretty much off-panel. <br><br>Actually that is one of the things I love about HF. It takes everything you know about the war and servants and then just shits on it making things go in a totally different way that nobody would have expected unless they had been spoiled.<br>It's just awesome</br></br></br></br>  <br> Lancelot is a terrible example, he's a super human in a world of super humans; not someone who needs to play it smooth with tactics and knowledge to find a path. <br>Problem is Lancelot skillset allows him to do just that, he can do both keikaku and brute force extremely well. I guess Lancelot is more of a Dr Doom without Magic then?</br></br>  <br>That's only because he is a nerfed shirou, shirou would wreck any servant with ease.</br>  <br> That's something nobody else did in the three route <br>Because almost no one actually fought Berserker, you nut.<br><br>And it was done because of a bunch of A rank NPs that likely ran out, because of single rank downgrades.<br><br>Saber kills Berserker with Caliburn.<br>Gilgamesh kills Berserker with his assortment of A rank NPs.<br>Saber ALTER killed around several as well with one Excaliblast.<br><br>That's a shitty fucking argument. And Dark Berserker had no skin and was dying in HF.<br><br>Saber couldn't do anything because she was shit powered in FSN until Rin becomes her Master or Sakura becomes her Master.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because Nasu's gone on record outright saying the anime is closer to his original vision. If that's the case, you have to start questioning things. <br><br> This is getting me loads of money I will go and say Miura fucked my MC up because i'm retarded xDD - Kinoku Nasu <br><br>You're dumb</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Counter Guardian <br>That's just another type of hero</br></br>  <br> would wreck any servant with ease. <br>Since Nasu said Shiki wins against Shirou, that means Shiki wins against Servants as well, especially after he said MEoDP works against Servants.<br><br> people not understanding that almost every win in FSN was done through situational advantages </br></br></br></br>  <br> Saber kills Berserker with Caliburn <br><br>Saber and Shirou with the power of plot. Ehm, "Miracles" Fuck off. <br><br>Rank downgrades mean shit to Archer because he can break them, there's a reason Berserker who is known for not giving a fuck about attacks dodging Caladbolg II when he sensed it was going to blow him up. <br><br> Saber Alter <br>OH FUCKING SURPRISE, the servant with a master capable of killing Gilgamesh an instant is strong!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't agree with Nasu, so you just say he's lying. That's great.<br><br>You randomly brought up Miura as a boogieman though, so I'm guessing you're one of those dudes from MAL who got super mad that they didn't just put the VN on screen for 23 minutes every week.</br></br></br>  <br> Because Nasu's gone on record outright saying the anime is closer to his original vision. If that's the case, you have to start questioning things. <br>Nasu's a hack, though.</br></br>  <br>It goes like this. <br><br>Shiki Tohno&gt;Shirou but dies after killing him. Why? Overload MEoDP<br><br>Shiki NANAYA&gt;Some servants because his Nanaya blood kicks in making him move near Arcueid levels(she's till faster than him, but that doesn't make him slow) that is something no servant cand do. <br>The fact that he's hellish fast and that his attacks will always kill you means he will end things in a speedblitz.<br>Also reminder that Nanaya is an Assassin, if he needs to killsomeone he will backstab them before they even know what happened</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Breaking shit takes time, around half a minute at the easiest one to break. You can't spam that shit and its only single use.</br>  Hey guys, does anyone have that list of Knights of the Rounds who get Excaliburs and who and who cannot Excaliblast?  <br> He's saying things right, let's call him MALfag <br><br>Fuck off. You're retarded if you can't tell he or anyone else will never ever say the adaptation is bad, fuck not even Ishida Sui said TG adaptation was bad, what's wrong with you people. <br><br>Also you're just putting things in my mouth I never said, I never said anything about putting all the monologues and the VN word by word, stop being a fucking retard. <br>They showing a bit of Shirou's mind in every episode until that point would help explain WHY he is like that.<br><br>Also ignore the fact that animeonly fags still don't understand Shirou's abilities or his personality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> wish he wasn't insane so that he could fight Archer's swordmanship because it's just fucking Amazing <br>Same guy who got stomped by Cu at close combat.<br><br> FUCKING LANCER, CU CHULAINN who projectiles are not supposed to work against  <br>Long range projectiles and shit with AoE does work on him, guess what EMIYA has.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes and Archer is not supposed to fight in Melee, Yet he managed to kill heracles SIX times. <br><br>Stop ignoring feats you mongoloid. What do you think would have happened if Archer fought in his usual style? he probably would've killed him a couple more times.</br></br></br>  <br>Second paragraph, Nasu's statement. These are his words. He thinks the anime got it closer. You can disagree, but just saying "he's lying" doesn't really work as an argument, buddy.<br><br>I wasn't trying to put things in your mouth. I wanted to know, what did you want? "Monologues" is not an argument. What parts were missing? What scenes?<br><br>Frankly I don't think they really missed anything. You just saying anime only people "didn't get it" is anecdotal and pointless. If you pay attention it's all there. They just didn't dumb it down for people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yet he managed to kill heracles SIX times. <br>This shows Heracles is a fucking shit at close combat as a Berserker. The only reason why he is even a threat is God Hand. Killed 6 times by someone who got stomped by Cu and would have died if he had not fought him before.</br></br>  <br>EMIYA fighting how he's supposed to &gt; Cu Chulainn. <br><br> Same guy who got stomped by Cu at close combat <br>You mean the mad berserker that wished he was sane so he could actully FIGHT at close combat instead of swing a giant rock like a fucking retard? <br><br>Oh you're so intelligent anon, of course he got toyed by Cu, Cu is better than Archer at Melee, that doesn't make Archer weaker since he is an ARCHER.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But you're ignoring the fact that LUCID, NOT CRAZY Heracles said he wished he was LUCID AND NOT CRAZY so that he could Fight Archer's amazing swordsmanship. <br><br>If fucking Heracles recognizes you as being a fucking great swordsman then hell yeah you are.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure swordmanship means close combat though.</br>  <br>Oh so you're baiting, nice anon.</br>  <br> EMIYA fighting how he's supposed to <br>Protection from Arrows<br>Servant Speed<br> :^) </br></br></br></br>  <br>EMIYAfags, everyone. Sure, if you consider basic grammar to be bait, then there is nothing to argue here.</br>  <br> This much Heresy <br>I'm going to need to Exterminatus your shit taste.</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>That still won't protect her from my dick though.</br>  <br> If fucking Heracles recognizes you as being a fucking great swordsman then hell yeah you are. <br>Doesn't seem to be that way considering the one he believe to have "amazing swordmanship" got BTFO by another Servant, and Cu, as good as he might be, is not even the best of his era, he is most likely just average.</br></br>    <br>Please tell me it's happening.</br>  <br> yfw that's genderswapped Hitler </br>  I'm guessing FGO is out? Region locked most likely.  <br>Just download it off QooApp, it works outside of Nipland.</br>  <br> Not knowing about based Nobunaga Oda <br> The one who can one-shot Gilgamesh, Heracles, and Cu Chulain. </br></br>  <br> Nobu (ノッブ, Nobbu?) is her given nickname in Fate/GUDAGUDA Order. It is pointed out if 100 million users has registered in Fate/Grand Order, she and Sakura Saber would make an appearance. </br>  <br> Wormslut received a card before Scáthach did </br>  FSN is shit, to be honest. I like the idea but the routes are too clean and streamlined, there is no chaos and characters are conveniently offed anti-climatically for the sake of "the route". All the climaxes feel too easy and straightforward because all of them turn into easypeasy 1-on-1 hero versus antagonists battles. Not saying Nasu is a better writer or whatever, but Zero hard the right by being much messier and having a lot of subplots running parallel at the same time. Not to mention that the climax has basically a 4 way battle.  <br>But can servants beat Gai who is recognized by Madara as the strongest?</br>  <br>I thought it was common knowledge that Rocks and Taijutsu &gt; Uchihas.<br> At least that's what I read in powerlevel threads/ </br></br>  <br>ok</br>  <br> more characters fighting at once means better <br> ignoring all the bits like Rin vs Caster, Shirou vs Kuzuki, Archer vs Lancer, or a ton of other examples <br><br>ok</br></br></br></br>  <br>That all happens too early and the "extra" characters are conveniently killed off to leave room for straightforward final battles like Shirou/Saber vs Kotomine/Gil, Shirou/Gil or Shirou/Kotomine non-shit edition.</br>  <br><br><br>What are these pics from?</br></br></br>  <br>F/GO opening I think.</br>  <br>In UBW alone there are like, three different things going on during the finale. Shirou vs Gil, Saber vs Assassin, and Rin getting Shinji out of the grail.<br><br>Likewise I think HF has two? Rin dealing with Sakura, and Shirou vs Kirei. It certainly isn't all one on one.</br></br></br>  <br>forgot link<br>https://vimeo.com/134987377</br></br>  <br> Fate Zero is sooo goood because theres two big fights going on at the end! <br> Fate is shit because there's only two big fights att he climax! </br></br>  <br>That's not Oscar, is it.</br>  <br> fails to kill <br> rolls over and dies at strongest power level <br>taijutsu users are shit</br></br></br>  <br> Gil <br> Close combat <br>Yeah, nah.</br></br></br>  <br>Gil fights at close combat all the time in CCC.</br>  Evolved Archer is Archer with his answer.<br><br>That's fucking great.</br></br>  <br> Japan only <br> Will never EVER be translated <br><br>Fuck this shit I hope it flops</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why does he remove the cowl? didn't he say that he only does that for battles not worth fighting?</br>  <br>He looks like he should be serving drinks in a gay bar.</br>  <br>Maybe he got hot.

I feel sorry for the enemy already. Nice touch with the Shirou hair though.</br>  <br>No, it's just the new illustration card of Magus Sakura which give her this popularity, she's even growing in me, when I never particulary liked nor disliked her. Very silly yes but her design is gorgeous.</br>  Someone please explain Sakura's mystic code to me. I can't understand what it's supposed to be good for, and Imaginary Numbers is confusing enough on its own already.  <br>Hes not that strong. He's a poor matchup against most servants in straight up fights. He was so weak that he had to make a contract with the world and probably didn't even complete his armoury until spending an eternity in the Throne.<br><br>Even his 'Batman'-like skills are more a result of having already lived through the 5th war once and knowing its in and outs instead of actually being Batman. In CCC when he didn't have any advantage whatsoever, he struggled to keep up with the more OP servants and programs.</br></br></br>  <br>Too bad it's just a redesign for a p2w phone game and is not actually gonna be used for anything.<br><br>Appreciating the design is okay, but the fucking fanfic circlejerk is just cringeworthy.</br></br></br>  <br>That's not saying much, even Gil struggles in CCC.</br>  <br>Gil only struggles against BB in CCC. Gil is by far on a completely different level than the other 3 servants.</br>  <br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Gonna try it even tho I know shit about moonrunes</br></br></br></br>  <br>I heard that that design was made by the illustrator and character designer of Prototype: Fragments. Honestly, I think he's one of the better character designers working at that place, though admittedly I don't think very highly of most of the mainstay artists of TM.</br>   You have to use "energy" to fight <br> Energy refills with time or paying for it <br><br>I forgot it's a fucking cashgrab mobile game of course they were going to do the same stuff as candy crush and other cancer. <br>Uninstalled</br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks average. Who's making this op?<br><br>Saber Vs Gil is odd<br><br>Jeanne a Best though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The novels illustrators are goods overall but yes Nakahara is my favorite TM artist too.<br>Takeuchi would be on part with him if he hadn't that huge sameface problems.<br><br>If you're talking only of the Grand order artists then yes, that's rather mediocre so far if not bad sometime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gil wasn't restricted to a class anymore. It was a buffed version of Gil. He still got BTFO by Gawain.</br>  Who is Shielder?  <br> You're a fucking moron if you think the greatest hero of Ireland is only average. <br>Average when compared to other heroes.</br></br>  <br>Wait a moment... The king of the neet can sword fight against Arturia now? Help.</br>  <br>Not the first time that he has done so.</br>  <br> Guy is even stated to be on the same tier as a Saber summoned in Britain or Heracles summoned in Greece. <br><br> Average when compared to other heroes. </br></br></br>  <br>I am.</br>  Who?<br><br>Also her design is kinda bad, glad she's not another Hisui clone tho</br></br>  <br>Some chinese assassin who is famous for failing to kill the first emperor.</br>  <br>He's good at drawing cute Manaka and pretty boys, so he gets a pass.</br>  Where is Heroic Spirit Shiki?

Even in Fate/HA.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hes not that strong <br><br>Actually is much stronger than people think. He's a decent mid tier with several powers that make him extremely versatile.<br><br>And Caladbolg can kill anything that is not Hercules. The problem is that in UBW he's not interested in winning and makes the retarded for most of his route. He's certainly not Achilles, Siegfried or some other god servant, but personally I think is pretty good.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you saying shit about D R A G O N D I C K?</br>  <br> Some chinese assassin who is famous for failing to kill the first emperor. <br>The one who failed twice right?</br></br>  Archer is Shirou. Shirou cannot defeat any Servant that has mastered a weapon. Therefore Archer cannot defeat any Servant that has mastered a weapon.  <br>I think you did not understand.</br>  <br>Oh, ok. Sorry then.</br>  <br> Berserker will kill his Master <br>wot<br><br> lol Rider <br>If the unforseen events of HF occur then not quite so much lol.<br><br>What the fuck exactly was he doing in FHA?

Holy fuck</br>  <br>Its because the Dragon Blood. His skin is literally the skin of Fafnir.</br>  <br> What the fuck exactly was he doing in FHA? <br>Sniping and fishing.<br><br> Why was he stopping Shirou crossing the bridge except plot device? <br>If I was Archer I'd want to snipe Shirou too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bullshit. That was just a way justified Shirou defeating Gil. Archer can kill a lot of servants with the right circumstances (and the circumstances are what often define the fate of a servant).<br><br>Archer is not that strong in direct combat, but it's not a tournament of martial arts, it is a war. There are classes like assassin and caster just because the direct combat is not the only way to establish itself as winner (it's just the easier) .</br></br></br>  <br>D R A G O N D I C K Thread?</br>  <br>Even Mata Hari and Li Shuwen became Heroic Spirits ffs.</br>  <br> People don't seem to get the difference here; Heroic Spirit is a status you can only achieve on your own by being so incredible that you overcome fate itself, being a CG isn't anything too complicated if you know how to make the contract. <br><br>Most heroes could only become heroes due to the contract as well. I remember the VN made a big deal of Arturia being a very special case for managing to become a hero without doing it, she was considered strange in this regard. (She eventually made the contract specifically to get the grail, but didn't need to do it to become a hero.)</br></br></br>  <br>Caster exists to be easy pickings for the three knight classes.</br>  <br> Most heroes could only become heroes due to the contract as well. <br>This is not stated anywhere. To become an HS requires great feats from a person. That's it. You don't have to make deals to do that.

DM is Standard.</br>  <br>D/D/D can move very fast once you start getting the hang out exactly how you want things to go. Raidraptors and Fluffals are like this to an extent too. <br><br>The meta isn't too bad honestly, a lot of it is very fast paced actually. Nekroz and BA can mill almost their entire decks in just a couple of turns and being able to set up any play they really wish. Tellar and Qlis is about spamming the field and just overwhelming your opponent and with how easy it is to get Infinity out early in Tellars, you can basically control the game at that point. <br><br>Masked HERO is like this to an extent, you can almost always get Dark Law out Turn 1 and control everything from there barring spell/traps screwing you over.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>*Epiode 5</br></br>  <br>Xyz isn't getting cameos and they're not going to waste their time in a ruined world. <br><br>GX, DM is Standard.</br></br></br>  <br>What news?</br>  <br> Xyz isn't getting cameos <br>Why wouldnt they?

It's just boring to play against. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=uQt<wbr>2lKIU9Po</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>The only answer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> AGAINST WINDO HATSUDO <br>All card names should be in engrish</br></br>  <br>If this is anime yugioh rule where the final boss don't have almost always any important backrow and I can literally counter anything and even create a card.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6Cu<wbr>KfrKdBFE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  So guys, what's a good deck to build for someone who just got back into YuGiOh and has a shit ton of cards from up to when the Elemental heros started?  <br><br>Masked Heroes</br></br>  <br>Not sure but the "news" will appear every hour on this screen in Shinjuku</br>  <br>Leo uses D/D/D so he probably has something up his sleeves, at least if Serena's reaction towards Reiji summoning D/D/D was anything to go by.</br>  <br>My friend has one of those, and he OTK'd me on his second turn with my deck I put together from my old cards.</br>  <br> at least if Serena's reaction towards Reiji summoning D/D/D was anything to go by <br>What reaction</br></br>  <br>If you want to use a deck about your cardfu or favourite monster, try to search for cards that help that card and make the deck.<br>If you want to use an archetype you like or you are interested, search for cards that can help that archetype, generic or not, just try to see if it is or not in the banlist.<br>If you want Meta, I reccomend you Qli, Nekroz, BA and Shaddoll, that's are the best until today.</br></br></br>  <br> at least if Serena's reaction towards Reiji summoning D/D/D was anything to go by <br><br>That reminds me that Sora also reacted to Reiji's monsters. Though Sora also noted that "they are completely different" once he started shitting out the D/D/Ds so I guess Leo only uses D/Ds and has some other playstyle with them.</br></br></br>  <br>Masked Heroes, it's the only relevant Hero deck with Stratos gone. <br><br>This one.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd imagine so, Serena's reaction was only to D/D and she had no reaction to the Covenant of the Swamp King. <br><br>It'd make sense, especially if they're going for a callback with Edo "The D", that'd make Leo "The DD" and Reiji "The DDD" and Reiji does look similar enough to Edo what with the silver hair and all, and then you have Leo being involved in Academia/GX.</br></br></br>  <br>Either way, I have to win and I will win if the others Lancers have failed, unless Yuya comes and create a new Dragon with my Ace.

He looks better with the black tank though.</br>  <br>Black clothes are an XYZ thing now.</br>  <br>Well, Yuzu being sent to the Salt Mines is an obvious KEEP YUYA AND YUZU SEPERATED plot device, along with hotel rooms being locked.<br><br>I don't know if Sawatari'll be the one to send her there. If the writers are feeling particularly mean they could have Yuya do it.</br></br></br>  <br>They're all locked up in rooms anyway, it doesn't really matter. Keeping them separate will happen when Academia wrecks the tournament. She might lose in the tournament anyway, but not to Sawatari of all people.</br>  <br> Jack <br> cool <br>Wat?</br></br></br>  <br> but not to Sawatari of all people. <br>She isn't going to duel Sawatari, that shit was just "the duel people wanted to see the most" in a random 2ch thread.</br></br>  <br>But Jack is Synchro though.</br>  <br>I know that, but this was a discussion about a hypothetical. IF the duel happens, she's probably not losing.</br>  <br><br>Just think of all the good character interactions they could have if they were in rooms for three instead of mono accommodation.<br>Yuya easily could've been in the same room as Gon or Sawatari or anybody. <br>What I'd wanted was for him to be in the same quarters as Yugo, that would've led to some cool misunderstanderings.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No time for talk, gotta shill synchros.</br>  <br>Sawatari being a contradictory proud loser is a running gag at this point.<br>Also he only has three monsters.</br></br>  <br>Yet we have time for episodic mopings and MUH JACK and MUH ENTERTAINMENT and MUH TRAITOR and MUH SHITTY TUNER CARD.<br>Character development is still going on, it's just the wrong characters.</br></br>  <br>This. Too much time was wasted on a flashback episode that could have easily been spent on more character interaction. The flashbacks were ridiculously excessive.</br>  <br> Just think of all the good character interactions they could have if they were in rooms for three instead of mono accommodation. <br><br>Chojiro's room would be the best room obv.</br></br></br>  Who wants to bet cup ramen is going to be the key factor in mending Jack and Crow's friendship and restoring Jack's name as the savior of Commons?  <br> yfw Yuya is in a perfect position to beat Yuzu, but he either doesn't go for the attack or just outright surrenders the duel because he doesn't want Yuzu to suffer. <br> yfw Yuya treats his waifu better than any of the previous YGO protagonists did with their own. <br><br><br> IF the duel happens, she's probably not losing. <br><br>IIRC, wasn't something like that said back when we knew Yuzu would duel Dennis? I still think Yuzu will win, but there is no guaranteeing anything, even if Sawatari is the worst duelist of the Lancers and got OTK'd off-screen by Security fodder.<br><br>The only way I see Yuzu losing to Sawatari is if they want to make Yuya suffer more, and make Yuya want to go Edge Mode on the Council. I wonder how he'd treat Sawatari if him winning screwed Yuzu over.<br><br>I personally think Yuzu would win against Sawatari, if only because Sawatari hasn't really done anything and is a complete joke. Granted, Yuzu is absolute shit compared to Yuya, Reiji, Dennis, Shun, Serena and Gongenzaka, especially the first four. She only has two Fusion monsters and got BTFO by Dennis while he was holding back. unlike Gongenzaka who won against Dennis, and Shun who probably would have beat Dennis.<br><br>It doesn't help that if the Obelisk Force didn't specifically bring a counter for Serena like they did, she would have took out all three of them without needing like 6 other people getting involved. Whereas Yuzu would have lost to the three Obelisk Force that almost dueled her, regardless of Yuri even being there. Also, she needed Gongenzaka to tag against Halil and Olga whereas Yuri fodderised both Halil single-handedly, probably without using his Fusion Dragon since Reiji (or at least Yuya/Yugo) would have detected it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>basically the first half of 5D's again</br>  <br>Are you really comparing Yuzu to Yuri of all fucking people in terms of strength? No fucking shit Yuri is stronger, but Yuzu isn't as "absolute shit" as you think, she's pretty strong for someone who doesn't have anything special going on for her deck, we just don't see it much since she hasn't dueled for quite awhile now.</br>  <br>Meh, shit on Yuzu all you want, she'll be strong in the end.</br>  <br> She'll be strong in the end. </br>  Why is Gongenzaka's theme so hype for a dude who never moves? Still if his big thing is defense shouldn't he have a way to prevent piercing damage? Honestly, that's the biggest weakness of his deck.  <br>This guy had it rough. He beat Yuya fair and square and then the faggot literally rewrote his cards in the middle of the duel.</br>  <br>The biggest weakness of his deck is Skill Drain.</br>  <br> Implying DRAGONS didnt posses him </br>  <br>To be fair when your monsters have 3800+Def you don't usually worry about piercing damage as much as protection from destruction effects</br>  <br>Post the bigger one faggot,</br>  <br> rewrote his cards in the middle of the duel <br>That's Yuma. Yuya just adds a couple of effects to existing cards.</br></br>  <br>Yeah that level 9 synchro was pretty unimpressive if that is all it does.</br>  Never forget.  <br/>  <br>I miss those times</br>    <br> these clothes are hot <br> I want to go hide in my cave <br> at least mom thinks I look cool </br></br></br>  <br>How could I forget the best moment in Yugioh?</br>  <br>Now the White Ranger finally looks the part.</br>  <br>chill out on those spikes now.</br>  <br>I don't know what everybody's problem is with the shining draw.<br>Every character has a moment where they draw the one card that can help them gain victory, no matter how unlikely as it may be, and sometimes never use or mention that card again. How is that different to making one up on the spot?<br>This at least gives a reason for this excessive luck to happen, in that rather than luck it's a kind of power that gives them the card they need. In a way it makes more sense.</br></br></br>  <br>Odd-Eyes straight up became a different card. Timegazer and Stargazer's monster effects were different from their current ones.</br>  <br>Because all the magic goes away when it becomes part of the plot and not general badassery</br>  <br>Oh neat, I forgot we saw them.

It's pretty much the same as the old monsters effect.</br>  <br>Majority of YGO doujins since the beginning are gay.<br><br>One of the main character conflicts in season 3 of GX was between MC and a yandere hermaphrodite whose greatest rival was another dude.</br></br></br>  <br> Once per turn, during either player's turn, when a Trap Card that targets exactly 1 Pendulum Monster you control (and no other cards) is activated: You can negate the activation, then Set that card face-down instead of sending it to the Graveyard. <br><br>That's not the same at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you, Chronomancy is noble and pure. Like Ninjabro except taller</br>  <br> Majority of YGO doujins since the beginning are gay. <br>Excepts the ones that transform the boys into girls,  then it's a different kind of gay. </br></br>  With Time gazer and Star gazer on the scales and meteorburst on the field you can attack without worry, however, they only negate cards that target a single pendulum card.

It easily took AOTS twice during the Maiami tournament, and these threads were bursting at the seams with people wondering what would happen next.</br>  <br>The threads were really never that fast. I'm pretty sure the people going OMG HYPE just ruined the show for themselves.</br>  <br>Blame Synchro for Arc-V becoming uneventful.</br>  <br>It was hype as hell. After Shun kicked Sora in the pants people went nuts, and rightfully so. The appearance of Yuto and Yugo, the confirmation of other dimensions and a cardgame war; it was wonderful.</br>  <br>It really wasn't as crazy as you think it was. If you think that shit was crazy, you've clearly never been a part of any big anime airing thread here. Again, people like you only ruined the show for yourselves by getting overhyped.</br>   host Turbo Duel <br> opponents use Xyz </br>  <br>Synchro Arc was such a goddamn mistake.</br>  So what are the odds that Sawatari actually plays the game well and makes it to the second round?<br> He's going to get matched against Yugo or Shun, isn't he? </br>  <br> Synchro was a mistake <br>fixed<br>BUY XYZ</br></br></br>  Let me sum up the events of Synchro Arc thus far<br><br> MC and the Lancers arrive and almost get thrown in Jail <br> They lay low for three episodes to avoid getting thrown in jail <br> They get thrown in jail anyways <br> They dick around to try and escape from jail <br> They fail to escape from jail <br> Now they're in a tournament where the losers get sent to a different jail <br> Also MC can't see his Aibou because reasons <br><br>Only Academia can save us from this awfulness.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I swear to god they're going to find a way to have a tournament in Fusion</br>  <br>He filled 2 threads in one days</br>  <br>They get captured immediately after entering Academia an are into a tournament with either trainee Obelisk Forces or other Fusion dimension natives to see if any are fit to join them and the losers get carded.</br>   destroying people with Kingu.dek in Turbo Duels <br>My penis is most erect.</br>  <br>Besides the point. Yugioh should not be compared to other anime, rather by its own standard.<br>And for little ol' Yugioh to get as many people talking as it did; that's a commendable achievement. <br>And<br> Hype ruins a show <br>If it weren't for hype these threads wouldn't be a daily thing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking Shark really did decide he was a DB character in the second half of the show. But at that point why not, it fit in with everything else that was happening.</br>  <br>Thete's still a lot of reasons to be hyped.<br>Just because the pace has slowed down slightly in favor of a separate subplot is no reason to say the show is dead or dying.<br>I'm still on the edge of my seat for Yuya and Yugo duking it out; I don't care how long I have to wait.</br></br></br>  I have faith in act 3. Gonna be some edgy fucking shit  <br>I actually think Arc V has a very good balance on what is an acceptable amount of edge.</br>  Any update on that special news we were supposed to get?  <br>No, the point is that you seem to only care about the show because of the hype, and not how the show is itself. Hype doesn't ruin a show, overhype does, and that's what you seem to have done to yourself.</br>  <br>Sawatari complained about the weather being too hot.</br>  <br><br>see </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>What the fuck is this shit? It's literally just a weather report? I always fall for this special announcement shit when it's really fucking nothing. Fucking nips get me all the damn time.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Meta Kingu.dek fucking when</br></br>  <br>Well he's right. It's too damn hot outside.</br>  <br>Whose asshole are you pulling these conclusions from? <br>I'm not overhyped at all, I'm just saying the show is great because it manages to maintain that hype, not just thanks to the hype alone.<br>Everyone hates it when an episode ends because it will be seven days until we find out what comes next. That is what hype is, being drawn in and invested in the fantastic show you're watching. And for a show about selling cards to pull that off, that's undeniably impressive. <br>The show is not ruined for me by a long shot. I'm still excited, even through the filler, because I can't wait to see what comes next.<br>That's not overhype in the slightest; that just merry anticipation.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>But the elder council seem to be pretty cool guys</br></br>  <br>So did Nico Smiley. And you know how evil he turned out to be.<br> Surprisingly not at all. </br></br>  <br><br>Imagine her losing to Sawatari though. She'll realize that she lost to the weakest lancer and might suffer from a mental breakdown<br><br> And after all this... I... I didn't change at all! I'm still the same as before! </br></br></br></br>  <br>Naw.<br>The Academia is going to be the boss rush toward the finale.</br></br>  <br>Losing to Sawatari would mean she's gotten even weaker, which would be retarded as fuck.</br>  <br><br>If they want character interaction they can just make people break into other rooms. Which is exactly what Choujiro, Reira and Reiji are gonna do with Yuya next episode. It's really only to keep Yuya and Yuzu seperated. Which makes me think that some GoT tier shit will happen and they won't meet at all. <br>Yuri is gonna steal Yuzu before they meet I'm almost sure of it</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sawatari got stronger. It would make her realize that she can't just stop getting stronger after achieving one new skill</br></br>  <br>You can't lose to a guy that only has three monsters</br>  <br>Sawatari didn't get stronger, he just got a different deck and still hasn't won duels himself. Regardless, if the duel does happen, Yuzu wins even if only by virtue of her cards actually existing in the real game.</br>  <br><br>I'm just reminded of when people said Arc-V went to shit when Michio happened and then when Michio reappeared everyone loved him<br>  Why couldn't you love Eita like that /a/? </br></br></br>  <br><br>You forgot SASSY ROOKIE</br></br>  <br>Nobody liked Eita and the devs knew it. Didn't show in the tournament, didn't show in the opening, out of sight and out of mind.<br>His duel was boring, his gimmick was dumb, his character was irredeemable. Nobody said he killed the show, but he did pilot the only two episodes that are undeniably terrible.</br></br>  <br> Yuzu wins even if only by virtue of her cards actually existing in the real game. <br>Wnning or losing has nothing to do with having your cards printed or not. She will win because she's the protagonist.</br></br>  <br><br>He mastered pendulum summoning and even the LDS trio said Sawatari's plays got impressive. When they decide to print Underworld Troupe he's gonna win some duels, you'll see</br></br>  <br>She will win because nobody can lose to Sawatari unless he's able to pay them. That's the joke.</br>  <br><br> GoT tier shit <br> Synchro was allies of Fusion all along <br> All lancers are killed (except Reira) <br> Yuzu manages to escape <br> Tatsuya is the main character now </br></br></br></br></br></br>  This is the most boring yaoi I've ever watched.  Just wait. Sawatari is gonna curbstomp with this card in one duel sometime or another. Probably when given "shit" cards after being captured (again) in Academia. Then we will get a bunch of Burger support cards released from the anime and I could make my dream deck.  <br>Sawatari has gotten stronger, Synchro is just stronger. A lot of the Standard duelists have been pushed into corners or straight up lost against Synchro duelists.</br>  <br> Sawatari uses Dark Mirror Force <br> Burger ends up cleaning up the scraps <br><br>I'd laugh honestly.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah if their tag duels are anything to go by, Gon and Sawatari seem to be on equal footing. And I consider Gon to be much stronger than Yuzu currently</br></br>  <br>I see Ruris on the top floor.</br>  <br>And they're looking for something...</br>  <br><br>Some of them want to use you</br></br>  Reira in motorcycle, soon  <br>They mistook that shrub for Shun's hair</br>  <br>Keep dreaming sonny</br>  <br><br>Reira Yuya's dick soon</br></br>  <br><br>Yfw Ninjabro can use multiple summoning methods</br></br>  <br><br>Some of them want to be used</br></br>  <br>He's saving the big guns for the little punk that killed his brother.</br>  <br><br>Isn't Dank Mirror Force really good against shaddolls? Wonder why it's not used more often</br></br>  <br> Gon and Sawatari seem to be on equal footing <br>Yeah no. That's silly. Sawatari gets wrecked and has never won by himself. That's as delusional as Sawatari himself. Sawatari isn't better than Yuzu. That's ridiculous.</br></br>  <br>Does getting carded equal actual death? I assumed it worked like the Prison Books from Myst: You get trapped in a different world and are unable to escape bar outside interference.</br>  <br>The way it was rung is that in DM, carded people have their souls locked away. In this, you lose your entire body. That's pretty much death in my books.</br>  <br> That's as delusional as Sawatari himself <br>Sawatari fags tend to be as delusional as he is. That's why they like him.</br></br>  <br>About to marathon this until 5:00 am, what am i in for?</br>  <br>A thrilling ride.</br>  <br>This past week I watched all the episodes of ARC-V up to now. It starts slow but it gets good fast when Yuto and Shun start getting involved in the plot.</br>  <br>Once you get to Episode 7, you'll be hooked. That's what they told me when I considered getting on the ride.</br>  <br>What if Jack learns XYZ?</br>  Pendulum summon OP.  <br><br>It's really not. It's probably one of the most balanced summoning methods and can be fucked over pretty easily.<br>Qlips are an exception, but that's like saying Rituals are OP because Nekroz</br></br></br>  <br>spell shattering arrow works for me when I draw it.</br>  <br>Kizunafag looks so pretty.</br>    <br>Odd Eyes Magicians is showcasing just what Pendulums are capable of, and Igknights are showing how they can turn any deck into a powerful one. There's a long way to go before they're properly broken. <br>I mean the magicians are crazy, but it boils down to essentially having two extra Spell zones to work with.</br></br>  <br><br>They're really only good if you add crazy search effects to them. But any card is broken if you do that.</br></br>  Fusion summoning Caesar into Caesar Ragnarok to and search out a covenant to then summon Caesar from the grave with Temujin again feels so great  Are Mecha Phantom Beasts still good? Any deck ideas?  <br><br>Galaxy Queens Light + Dark Strike Bomber OTK</br></br>  <br>You know what feels great?<br>Wiping the field with Jurrac Impact before summoning Photon Thrasher to fuck your opponents shit. <br>Complex combos are for pussies.</br></br></br>  <br> Complex combos are for pussies. <br><br>-People who can't do complex combos</br></br></br>  <br>Why do complicated things when you can do easy things?</br>  He should just change his name.  <br>To what? Polymer?</br>  <br><br>Ekushizu</br></br>  <br> Yusyn. </br>  <br>It was like that in GX too, I think full bodies/souls went into books during Season 3.</br>  <br> tfw I realized we're running out of Yus slowly thanks to Arc-V </br>  <br>I could never get into the later parts of GX due to Judai/Jaden turning into a full-blown edgelord. It works for Yuya but not for him, just seems off.</br>  <br>Well Judai didn't have a reason to be so up in arms about Johan really other than they both could see Duel Spirits, but the actual reason he's Haou made sense. That and it's one of the best seasons in YGO. <br><br>Either way I was agreeing, I believe it says they're dead in GX too but can be brought back.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe the duel chaser isn't the one that was beaten by Yugo, but instead Enjo disguised. Actually, scratch that, I hope he's 227 and we get a couple of episodes hyping up his revenge, only for him to get replaced by Enjo right before the duel.</br>  Meanwhile with Synchro Yusei...  This child has seen terrible things.  <br> tfw Yusei is probably a spoiled brat who doesn't know the concept of kizuna because he grew up in Tops <br> he probably plays some top tier synchro deck with his dad's money and would throw away cards like Sonic Chick or Junk Warrior </br></br>  <br> he probably plays some top tier synchro deck with his dad's money and would throw away cards like Sonic Chick or Junk Warrior <br> STOP </br></br>  <br> tfw Aki probably went insane and murdered a bunch of innocents for sadistic pleasure because Yusei wasn't around to save her <br> she is probably in a high security prison center, insane asylum, or flat out dead <br> Ruka and Rua never developed the skills to be strong duelists and Rua failed to save his sister from violent thugs and she was kidnapped. <br>It hurts /arc-v/.</br></br></br></br>  What happened to that screen in I don't know where that twitter gave us?  <br>Don't forget that Sherry is likely still part of Yliaster and going around fucking things up.<br><br>Whatever Leo wants to do with the dimensions is likely actually the good guy plan.</br></br></br>  <br>Just Sawatari complaining about the heat.</br>  <br>Yusei and Aki are dating and currently at the skating rink, anon. Fuck the twins, through they fit in Arc-V far more than Jack and Crow and Luna could of finally gotten a fucking deck.</br>  <br>What VAs say arn't canon anon.</br>  <br>Yusei never would have met Aki if he had been a doctor in the Tops. <br><br>Just like KaibaCorp and Kaiba does not exist in Standard, Synchro, and likely Fusion as well. Considering there is no KaibaCorp in Synchro and that the Commons create the D-Wheels not KC, and it's implied that LDS has created all the cards and systems that are used in Standard. <br><br>Which means that Kaiba never fucked up Yugi's grandpa, meaning Duelist Kingdom never happened, meaning Marik eventually pops into play regardless of Battle City, kills Yugi who never developed the skills properly, and takes the Millennium Puzzle, meaning at the end it's Marik vs. Bakura fighting over control and that means Bakura eventually would win due to Zorc. <br><br>Arc-V has fucked up a lot of shit by being split and causing people to not exist.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>based Sawatari<br><br> dunno how it is in Japan but the heat is become more mild over here </br></br></br></br>  <br>It's like in the mid 90s with like 80% humidity in places like Tokyo most of the day. So in all likelihood it probably feels like 105-110 over there, not much different than here sadly.</br>  <br><br>And now in a unit of meassure the rest of the world uses?</br></br>  <br>like 32-33 celsius.</br>  Well at least Arcadia didn't exist because apparently Divine decided to be a turbo duelist and get fucking destroyed by Jack.  <br>Oh... that's like the norm where I live. Nothing too unusual.</br>  <br>How do you know that he is Sayer?</br>  <br>Same here, the problem is just the humidity which makes it feel like it's 40-42C all day. The other day was such shit for me.</br>  <br> Hair <br> Colour scheme <br> Thought Ruler Archfiend </br></br></br>  Why are we talking about shit tier 5ds in an Arc V thread?<br>And don't say because Arc V is 5ds now, that's no excuse for shitting matters up further</br>  <br>But it is 5Ds, just like Fusion will be GX. That doesn't make it bad, but it's good to discuss things considering they are literally in the 5Ds Dimension, which begs the question of where all the other characters are or at least what they're doing. <br><br>What else are we going to talk about?</br></br></br>  <br>Synchro us the current arc so 5D's is going to be brought up alot. Wait until Academia and Heartland as GX and Zexal will be brought up as well.</br>  <br>I think the arcs will follow like this:<br><br>Synchro &gt; Heartland &gt; Return to Standard &gt; Fusion &gt; Unheard dimension that exists due to Leo plot bullshit &gt; Defeat of Leo/Resolution with the Yus/End of ARC-V in Standard.</br></br></br>  <br>I doubt it personally, Xyz would have almost no time to get anything done as the series has been stated to be three seasons.<br><br>Standard was Season 1 at Ep. 1-50<br>Synchro is Season 2 at Ep. 51-66 so far<br>YGO since 5Ds are only about 140-150 episodes each. <br><br>Synchro will probably last to about Ep. 85 at the very least.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But what about Arc V  II? </br>  <br><br>Going by the current scheme all characters seem to be in a similar position just with an altered history. Crow is still in common slums and takes care of children and Jack still is a commons outcast who worked himself up to top. Though I wonder if Crow and Jack used to be friends ecen without Yusei and that's why Crow considers him a traitor.<br>Going with that the Twins still seem to be locked up in their mansion and don't leave ot because they have no reason too and Aki is somewhere underground being experimented on while Yusei and Crimson dragin don't exist.<br>Carly probably suicided out of depression because she never met Kingu</br></br></br></br>  <br>They could just have a mini-arc or something because Heartland is fucking destroyed. It's not like Synchro which is actually populated or Academia which is a training grounds for uber soldaten.</br>  <br><br>There would be absolutely no reason to go to heartland at all</br></br>  <br>It's possible, but I honestly doubt it though, but who knows. That'd be neat, but I still doubt it though, Zexal was only like 140 episodes with Zexal I and II. 5Ds was like 152 episodes or so, GX was like 180 episodes and DM, I don't remember but it was up there. <br><br>Yusei and Crimson Dragon might as well be Yugo and Clear Wing, Clear Wing is even the only dragon shown to warp shit so far too.</br></br></br>  <br>Then why involve an XYZ dimension if you don't fucking bother with it at all? Lancers are from Standard, they go to Synchro to get allies, and then are supposed to push against Fusion to topple Leo's army. I get how there is no reason since most people are dead and they already have a resistance member on their side but come on. If not that then some type of flashblack to Yuto and Shun's life before Fusion invasion because Yuto fucking died way too early.</br>  <br>Probably because like you said, Heartland is gone, and only a handful of people are left just trying to defend their own shit. <br><br>We'll likely get flashbacks to Heartland and the crew when Ruri shows up.</br></br></br>  <br> Then why involve an XYZ dimension if you don't fucking bother with it at all? <br>To show the power of fusion and how it took over a complete dimension.<br>There's literally no reason to go to a place that's been raided and destroyed.</br></br></br>  <br> implying mai waifu would kill herself <br>Do you even know Carly? If she existed in syncho she would be a talented but struggling reporter that will do anything to get ahead and make a name for herself even if it means hurting others on her way to the top. This is what will happen if she never met Jack and see that he is human and has emotions and that any story she writes could harm people emotionally.</br></br>  <br>Carly doesn't exist in Synchro, we have a new reporter now.</br>  <br> There's literally no reason to go to a place that's been raided and destroyed. <br>Did the writers make XYZ literally Fallout because they hated Zexal or something?</br></br>  <br>Maybe they're sending a message to Konami that Xyz and their Rank 4s need to be killed off.</br>  <br>I said "if" anon. It's obvious Melissa is synchro Carly.</br>  <br>I doubt it. XYZ are fine, it's just that Konami cannot balance anything for shit and they like brute force power creeping. But that's a topic for /dng/. I am happy that Dark Rebellion exists however.</br>  <br>Well I'm happy Raidraptors exist too. <br><br>But really though Xyz is like that just because. They probably made the characters and general plot of '4 Dimensions' and then went with decks and then based it from there and Xyz just happened to be the one to take the blow.</br></br></br>  <br>XYZ is most popular so they portayed them as the noble rebels fighting for freedumb and girls.</br>  <br> Did the writers make XYZ literally Fallout because they hated Zexal or something? <br>They did so that we got to see this https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7Oi<wbr>EAzPaAWY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Xyz are the noble rebels fighting each other in a glorious band of freedom and fun  <br> Fusion are a bunch of psychopaths trying desperately to git gud <br> Synchro is a bunch of elitist assholes that are largely irrelevant <br> Standard/Pendulum have a lot of annoying fucks but largely irrelevant too <br><br>It's like I'm really playing the OCG/TCG!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Heartland served as background story for Yuto and Shun. We don't really need to go out of the way to explore it any further. Synchro was the only dimension that was left out of the entire conflict which is why we need an entire arc to bring them in</br></br>  <br><br>No Melissa Claire is Synchro's MC</br></br>  <br>She can be both Synchro Carly and Synchro MC. She's on double duty.</br>  <br><br>I still don't get the meaning of this scene.</br></br>  Only one MC shows up in Arc-V, who do you want it to be?<br><br> Supreme King Judai rules Academia and Yuya teaches him to have fun again <br> Yusei shows up as a doctor to clean up the wounds from the Academia invasion <br> Yuma is the leader of the Resistance  <br><br>I have no idea what Yugi or Atem would do or how they'd show up though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a good reporting subject, capable of great things.</br>  <br> &gt;Yuma is the leader of the Resistance <br>This one because Jaden and Yusei already have BBT. Kaiba and Yugi have the upcoming movie as well but everyone hates Yuma so I don't know.</br></br>  <br> everyone hates Yuma <br>Nah, Japan loves him. Japan loves Zexal as a whole, really.  They have good taste for once. </br></br>  <br>They like Zexal II and only because it goes full on super saiyan shounen levels.</br>  <br><br>No they don't. Even japanese fanartists make Yuma look like a retard when put together with the other MCs</br></br>  <br>They really do. I don't think there'd be such a huge amount of fanart of him if they didn't.</br>  <br>To be fair Yuma is a fucking retard. <br><br>And Japan does love Zexal.<br><br>DM &gt; Zexal II &gt; GX &gt; Zexal I &gt; Arc-V &gt; 5Ds, their ratings from the last I saw, and DM absolutely dwarfs Zexal II, the rest are at least relatively close. Combining Zexal though puts it where Zexal I is on the list and GX above it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>There isn't really more fanart of him than of any other YGO MC</br></br>  <br> japan loves zexal <br>Fucking why? If the cult shit didn't ruin 5D's I would assume it would be one of the more popular series. I can hardly go one YGO forum without someone referring to Zexal as "zezzle", the hate is pretty bad in the fanbase outside Japan.</br></br>  <br>see <br><br>It got full on crazy dumb with it's shit, and kids in Japan love that shit. The western YGO audience is a little different, they just want to see people getting carded and mind crushed.</br></br></br>  <br><br>miniskirt lolis</br></br>  <br>I miss Funnitler</br>  <br>It's a matter of taste.Japan loved Zexal and hated 5Ds.In the USA fans loved 5Ds and hated Zexal.It seems like anime that Japan dislike are loved in the USA,the most famous example of this is G Gundam.</br>  XYZ dimension  When does the new episode comes out ?  <br><br>Sunday</br></br>  Do you think Dennis while remain a spy for Yuri with no changing of sides or will he fold for the Lancers?  <br>He will become final boss</br>  <br>Do you expect to be able to casually drop your Academia training? Training that's been ingrained into you your entire life?<br> Unless Dennis is a brainwashed XYZ resident, in which case probably </br></br>  <br>Goddamnit Yuri, you'd be a big help if you could crash this shitty tournament already. Or I dunno. DO SOMETHING.</br>  <br>One of my shit theories is that he just some type of hired mercenary/spy who pays the highest amount of money/cards. With enough time, he could be the Revolver Ocelot of ARC-V. Fusion probably won't fuck with XYZ as all the other Summoning methods are beneath them which is why I think Dennis may not have been trained at Academia. Yeah he has a Poly but Yuri could've easily sad "Hey Fusion is best method. Use it."</br>  <br>Dennis will make it all the way to the final of the tournament and face Yuya, who's just absorbed Yugo and gotten CWSD. At which point, he'll snap like a rubber band and go crazy, howling for blood and Fusion Summoning all over the place. Yuya eventually defeats him, but then Academia rolls in to fuck everyone's shit up.</br>  <br>So Shun vs Sora 2.0? I don't want him to be a crazy fuck for the hell of it because that's Sora job. We'll just have to wait and see what they'll do with him.</br>  <br>Nah, Dennis is much too composed to lose the plot. He's a professional. <br>He could end up dueling Shun again, though I'd like for either of them to duel Selena.</br></br>  <br> Shun can't bring himself to strike Ruri's likeness because PTSD </br>  <br>He's a bit busy elsewhere right now.</br>  <br> He has mid-battle flashbacks against Selena  <br> We get to see the Ruri </br></br>  <br>Serena better stay a fucking lancer and get better. No more double crossing. First Sora and now Dennis. I know she's a fucked up child soldier but goddamn even Raiden made it out okay as was possible for a child soldier. Your past doesn't justify your present or future but so far she's still has that Academia attitude present despite hating what they did to XYZ.</br>  <br> Yuri tries to invade the Synchro dimension but he telefrags Dennis instead. </br>  <br>It is the only life she's ever known, so her attitude will no doubt stay. Shes been taught how to fight and not much else.<br>But she's obviously free of mind, and she seems hard set on her decision to join the Lancers.</br></br>  <br>Okay that is hilarious. <br>Though the wall would probably constrict his abdomen snd suffocate him.<br> And nothing of value was lost </br></br></br>  <br>What would actually be hilarious is if  they stick the hose from the last panel up his butt. </br>   Yuya vs Yuri and Yuya pulls a DORO MONSTA CARDO moment and overkills/absorbs him. <br>Soon.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-9N<wbr>BvsmQ2Ik</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Overrated scene</br>  <br>Does /a/ hate Breaker now or something?</br>  <br>If anything, Shun vs Sora round 3 will be the DORO MONSTA CARDO moment if Sora told Shun he carded Ruri, and then pretends to rip the card (which is instead Red Ninjabro's card) in front of his face.<br><br>It then leads to Sora getting BTFO by an enraged Shun who only fails to card Sora because either Sora teleports away, or Shun is stopped by someone else (Yuya, Yuzu, or perhaps even Ruri herself). Though if Yuri was dueling Shun, and he bluffed about carding Ruri, he would still beat Shun.</br></br></br>  <br>That would be above and beyond hype</br>  <br>Remember when Breaker was meta?</br>  <br>I would not mind Sora being carded. He is irredeemable.</br>  <br>Yes, and now he's at 3 thankfully. I love my Breaker even if he does nothing other than be an MST on legs.</br>  <br>But Shun has no reason to hate Sora unless he believed his pointless lies.<br>If anything it should be Blu Ninjabro that duels Sora. He did kill his brother after all. Forgiveness would be dishonorable.</br></br>  <br>Fuck, is that Red Demon Warrior?</br>  <br> there will never be a Crimson Soul Warrrior </br>  <br>Remember when monsters looked like shit?</br>  <br>That's just fanart, calm your tits man.</br>  <br> Tsukikage uses XYZ </br>  <br>No</br>  <br>Put a spoiler on that bro.</br>  <br> That guy has some weird eyes <br> Dumb looking hair too <br> Can't imagine him becoming popular  <br>How stupid I was</br></br></br></br>  What deck is Yuri getting?, they only showed his dragon and some random spell card.<br><br>Im going for Shadolls or infernoids.</br></br>  <br>Shun is the best thing that happened to Arc v</br>  <br>I'm going for a deck that doesn't currently exist you fucking mong</br>  <br> new character getting a well established meta deck and not something original. <br>Yuya got Preformapal/Odd-Eyes/Magicians, Yuto has Phantom Knights, Yugo has Speedroids. All of these are new and besides I'd rather not have metadecks in the anime shown heavily because god knows you cannot avoid it IRL.<br><br>Shun is based. I feel so sorry for him yet he presses on just as hard as Academia did when destroying Heartland. Completely owned Sora but his next duel with him sucked (why have Styx in ATK mode?)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shun is up there with the greatest Yugioh characters. <br><br> Wouldn't mind a final boss character having Qlits </br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>This looks like infernoid for me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Too bad his egaopal is not around any more.</br>  <br>Anon, you should check out Kaiser Dragon.</br>  <br>This looks like infernoid for me.<br><br> See, I can make posts that have nothing to do with their images as well </br></br></br>  <br>Shun would be so based in Zexal. Almost exactly like Shark except with a hotter sister.</br>  <br>I know he's not part of the "power trio" that is Yuya/Gon/Yuzu but I think he is ARC-V's Jack Atlas. Almost always badass, has cool appeal for target young audience, and he plays a deck built around awesome an monster/s. He also has about as much passion as Jack while dueling. I wouldn't compare him to Crow just because they run bird decks however.</br>  <br>There is no power trio in Arc V. The characters cycle around too much and work separately far too often for there to be an actual trio.</br>  <br>That's a high bar to set.</br>  <br>Shun is like a combination of Shark and Kaito.</br>  <br>I didn't know Shun was a time traveller. How are his parents in the background?</br>  <br>I suppose not. This cast is pretty expansive right now. I guess I got used to the Yusei/Jack/Crow shit from 5D's so I'm trying to spot out trios even if they may not exist.</br>  I still remember when YUGIoh was actually about YUGI, and how it had an interesting lore and the fucked up hairstyle only belonged to him, unlike ARC-V.  <br>It's kind of a Power Octet.</br>  <br>Atem return to the after life please, and come back when you have news about the movie, that btw, it will have Kaiba as the real and only protagonist.</br>  <br>I really doubt he's their son.</br>  <br>I remember when Yugioh wasn't about Yugi, it was about Yami, and was shit.<br>Necessary, but shit.</br></br>  <br>Yuya needs to egao some more.</br>  <br>Then how do you explain the SEMI-SHINING DURAAAAAW</br>  <br> The only ones EGAOing here are the Entertainment duelists </br>  <br>Dennis is the rarest Pepe</br>  Apparently if you Google image search 'Ninjabro' you get this comfy Tsukikage as one of the results.  <br>That's Barian Chaos Draw.<br><br>Now we know his real parents.</br></br></br>  <br>Rio and Kaito, yes.<br>Shun is much too well put together to be the result of twincest.</br></br>  <br> People still thinking Yuri would play a existing archetype rather than a new one <br>Just like how Sora switched to Shaddolls when he got serious, right?<br><br> you know who Sora is, that meme sucks </br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly, because anime archetypes are defined by their real world effectiveness and not plot and character usage amirite?</br>  Who KINGU deck profile here ?  <br>Mines sucks though.</br>  <br>Why would you bother though?</br>  <br>His undying devotion to his sister is clearly the result of having the siblings as his parents.</br>  <br>However the fact he isn't a gurgling pile of retard strongly suggests he isn't.</br>  How do you deal with the retards in yugioh online?<br>It's like they don't understand basic movements and you have to fucking explain everything.</br>  <br><br>The fact that Shun was born long after his parents died renders both these theories invalid.</br></br>  <br>You mean Dueling Network? Yeah don't do that.<br>Download Ygopro. It has the occasional hiccup, but it's much easier to say you lost because of game error than to say you forfeit after trying to convince an eight year old that overlaying doesn't count as tributing for three hours.</br></br>  <br> Shun was born long after his parents died <br>That's gross.</br></br>  <br>Come again?</br>  <br>DN is like that until you climb the ranks, it's honestly amazing how people can't grasp the simplest of concepts. I can't tell how you infuriating it is having to explain that MST doesn't negate after the zillionth time. <br><br>YGP is definitely a better system, but there is a fraction of the people in comparison to DN and nobody does Tournaments on YGP because of the shit ass spectator mode and the occasional card bugs, especially with newer cards.</br></br></br>  <br> Shun was born long after his parents died <br><br>Are you saying Shun willed himself into existence?</br></br></br>  <br>I want to fuck that card.</br>  <br>Ygopro still have those retard kids that even ask questions when you do a simple pendulum or synchro summon.</br>  <br>WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MAKE RURI<br>IS RURI SHUN'S TULPA???</br></br>  <br>I remember reading some manga about something similar once.This character was born from his mom who was dead for several hundred years. Apparently he was in stasis inside the womb and his power kept his mom's corpse preserved until he came out or something.</br>  <br>I feel like that Fusion Dimension Dragon is gonna be underwhelming considering it's being saved for last while Standard/Pendulum (Odd-Eyes), Synchro (Clear Wing) and Xyz (Dark Rebellion) have been known for a long time already.</br>  <br>Shun is the Tulpa.<br> Ruri invented Shun as an imaginary brother to protect her <br> If he doesn't get her back he cannot continue to exist </br></br></br>  <br>mine is shit too.</br>  <br>Not much you can do about kids, I remember when the TCG first came and I was a kid playing it. We'd play by anime rules, or just summon whatever we felt like at the time just so we could have 'cool duels'. A bit silly, but kids will be kids, especially if they hate losing and are used to getting their way.</br>  <br>Well Clear Wing was a hard counter to Dark Rebellion, so Purple Dildo Fusion Dragon will probably have some insane effect that reduces Att and negates effects of non-Fusion monsters.</br>  <br>Unlike DN however, you can just keep clicking buttons while your opponent shrills for explanations on why you're kicking ass.</br>  <br>I just became totally gay</br>  <br>You've got that backwards, Shun died before his Parents were born.</br>  <br>Odd-Eyes: Offensive Life Point Double Attack<br>Rebellion: Offensive Attack Raise and Lower<br>Clear Wing: Offensive Attack Raise and Effect Negation<br>Fusion: Offensive Attack Raise and Summoning Negation<br><br>Yuzu didn't have her Fusion out so it's effect was likely either negated or the summoning was straight up prevented and that would be a hard counter to all the dragons.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How am I suppose to rank up in DN were these kids call bullshit on everything you fucking do? Like holy shit there are no fucking Yugioh games I can play online and when I tried that shit I get bombed by retards. I don't know if they are kids or not, but one of them got so fucking mad that didn't even try to reduce his fucking lifepoints because I synchro summoned 3 beefy monsters in one turn. <br>Like what the fuck should I do? The retard won't budge. I'm downloading YGpro or whatever as we speak, I really don't know if I'll escape this fate, but I'll try and see, and probably cry some more here.</br>  <br>Call in an admin, wait 25 minutes while he shows up and tries to figure out what is going on, get frustrated and leave. <br><br>Or just boost yourself. Create two accounts, log into both of them, and pop onto the spanish servers late at night since nobody is on those and you'll in most cases connect to yourself.</br></br></br>  <br> yfw there will never be a good online yugioh game </br>  <br>Because the community is fucking shit for the most part. <br><br>The best people I've seen is a kid at my locals who doesn't get mad, he knows what he's doing, he just sadly doesn't know the price of things and assholes try to rip the poor kid off unless I or someone else intervenes. <br><br>Other than that /a/ and a couple people on /dng/ are the only good people I've seen in the entire community. Which is sad.</br></br></br></br></br>  I feel like playing some yugioh now, what's the best yugioh GBA game? I liked the 2006 world wide one but it didn't follow any story.  <br>The card game is fun but it's broken and too expensive. In turn, it generates a shitty community. At least Pokemon TCG, as broke as it is, has a very friendly community because mostly kids and their parents play it and also there is no real desire to win overall unless you want to win Worlds or whatever. I think the edginess of the anime and the ego-fuel dueling is partly to blame; people don't know when to leave their katanas and smugness at home.</br>  <br>GX Duel Academy was good in my opinion, I really liked the flow of it with the exams each month and the changing of dorms, even if there was no concrete story</br>  <br>Play DS ones. GX Spirit Caller is GOAT.</br>  Holy crap, Yugioh tag in Pixiv literally has filled with Traptrix, damn, I know they are popular but shit. Why they always choose dangerous being instead of safe ones? They are like asking for sex before dying, where are the arts of YuyaxYuzu?  <br>Yugioh duel of roses or yugioh dice monsters</br>  <br>Traptrix are genericanimegirls.dek so badly. I hardly like cards like that except a few of them like Downerd Magician and alot of that has to due with the fact that she's very useful in a low Rank deck. Where are my Vampire Ladies, DD Warrior Ladies, and Harpie Queens?</br>   see people now talking about yugioh games <br> have a wii u as a gift <br> only have it for smash <br> interested a tad since i have a bunch of cards and i think im the only one that still cares about this shit <br> go to the wii u store <br> nothing <br><br>what the fuck</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It has a lot to do with it's competitiveness against MTG too, where both sides have their fair share of elitists and thieves, whereas Pokemon doesn't have that as much.<br><br>It's just the sheer size of YGO/MTG that causes all the problems. <br><br>Same reason shit like Aromagirls or Familiars got a lot of art, it's just animegrills.dek.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>YGO games are dead outside of the PSP Tag Force games (Which don't even get localized anymore), most we're getting is I believe a YGO game for PS4 sometime eventually, and maybe a World Championship game for Vita/3DS. <br><br>The video games have basically died because nobody buys them anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>What a coincidence.<br>A new YGO game is coming out TODAY<br> http://www.yugioh-card.com/en/prod<wbr>ucts/legacy_of_the_duelist.html</wbr> <br> http://ygorganization.com/tcg-lega<wbr>cy-of-the-duelist/</wbr> </br></br></br></br>  <br>MTGfags vs YGOfags is so dumb. For what it's worth, I heard MTG is less broke but it's irrelevant as all or most of the problems plaguing the fanbase for Yugioh is related to both playerbase and Konami not be very good at making a balanced card game. This is why I never ever try to compete with the meta because it almost always involves asshole people thinking they are hot shit for being ace at a kid's card game. Everyone needs to take a page out of ENJOY's book.</br>  <br>I always thought that the fact Yuto was in snow and there was the LDS rocket in the OP that Heartland was hit by a nuclear winter.</br>  <br> They are like asking for sex before dying <br>Japan<br><br> tfw loli are most popular in pixiv <br> tfw Downerd don't get the same attention <br> tfw those three you mentioned don't have much attention <br> tfw Harpies are better than Traptrix yet they are having less pictures <br> tfw it's been half of a year since my cardfu got art, and it's not that good to begin with <br>At this rate I may become a drawfag myself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> http://www.yugioh-card.com/en/prod<wbr>ucts/legacy_of_the_duelist.html</wbr> <br> ps4 and xbone <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=TJf<wbr>kBiCdaSs</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Is there any fucking reason why this is not on wii u? This won't even use 1/4 the graphic capabilities of a freaking ps4.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's out NOW.<br>Why is nobody talking about it?<br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hv<wbr>JEhg1bNlE</wbr>  [ ] </br></br></br>  <br>They couldn't have picked a worse text box and font. <br>Literally gave me cancer.</br></br>  <br>Agreed, WotC just know how to make their power creep mean less as time goes on, whereas YGO goes from fucking Army Ant to Demonbane sometimes. <br><br>The meta isn't too bad, it's just broken because of the power creep, then you have the idiots thinking power creep is better for a game as opposed to just balancing all cards around everything else. It's sad when you can mill half your deck in 2 turns and win like it's nothing compared to say some decks like D/D/D where you actually have to make precise plays and build stuff up, like how it should work and did work in the past.<br><br>It doesn't matter, give it another YGO anime series or two and it'll collapse in on itself with the ridiculous effects and power creep.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuya/Yuzu is still getting plenty of art, bruh. In fact, it gets more fanart than any given yaoi pairing tag for Arc-V, if my pixiv-fu is correct.</br>  <br> meta not so bad <br>Game was literally ruined after synchro, xyz, and pendulum summoning. Also didn't help that they made it too hard for retard kids to understand.</br></br>  <br>Vampire Lady used to be my favorite female card as a card. I still have my copy from when I got it in the Zombie Madness deck years ago. There is almost no artwork for this card and it makes me annoyed. Maybe is she was kawaii uggo with a flatchest the nips would cream themselves.</br>  <br><br> literally only aces monsters from anime plus others from anime got model animation <br> MAD </br></br></br>    <br>Models are expensive, what did you expect?</br>  <br>Well I meant by that comment that not all the meta decks are inherently bad, they can be beaten, but yeah I guess it's not saying much honestly. <br><br>They just thought about new summoning methods that'd be cool more than the game so they could sell more cards. They're more a business than a caring industry. I mean look at the new Konami CEO who canceled Silent Hills because Kojima refused to have it go mobile so it would sell more, then played his first video game in MGSV and complained that it was too hard and that you should have the option to buy guns and equipment, offending Kojima even more, which led to his eventual firing, so much so that he had to offer an apology for not understanding that Konami had actual dedicated fans. <br><br>Konami has no idea what they're doing and go in from a complete "This will sell the most, yay investors" mindset instead of trying to appease and fix things.</br></br></br></br></br>  He's back!  <br>Sanji is shit</br>  <br><br>He's a traitorous White Knight Faggot pussy beggar.</br></br>  <br><br> kicks some scrub <br> He's back! </br></br></br>  <br>I think he meant that he finally appeared after a year of being missing</br>  <br><br>Then 'he's back.'</br></br>  <br>oh shit there are devil fruit patterns on his arm</br>  <br>Are you literally autistic?</br>  <br><br>Are you?</br></br>  <br>Geez. <br>The other guys means "the Sanji that wasn't a little bitch is still gone."<br>We know the actual character of Sanji is present in the manga again.</br></br></br>  So who was it Chopper was trying to save this chapter? Law's crew?  <br>what a goddamn retard as if there is a any actual difference between "He's back." and "He's back!". Either way sanji appeared again for who knows how many chapters.</br>  <br>nami's group obviously.</br>  <br><br> as if there is any actual difference between . and ! <br><br>English isn't your first language I see. <br><br><br><br> guys means </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> English isn't your first language I see. <br>There is no difference in the content you autist, both would describe sanji coming back after a year. You're such a fucking nigga</br></br>  <br><br> there is no difference in the content <br><br>Do you know what the difference between an exclamation and a period is?<br><br>Guess nobody did English Lang. in school I see.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  stop arguing semantics with an autistic imbecile that is throwing a tantrum over a fucking exclamation mark  <br> still trying to damage control <br>As I said there is no difference in the content. Emotions are a completly different matter.</br></br>  <br><br> can't refute the point <br> ad hominem <br><br>Good job with that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The difference is one could imply Sanji coming back is a good thing, it implies enthusiasm and strong feelings.<br><br>The other is more 'Oh, Sanji is back.'<br><br>Nigga.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes but Chopper gives us this line after they reunite with Nami's group. So they're potentially still chasing after someone.</br>  <br> Kalifa has a key that they need to rescue Robin <br> Sanji refuses to fight her because he is a sexist <br><br>Why do people like this guy again? If Nami didn't defeat Kalifa, he would be responsible for both Nami's as well as Robin's death.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Blame the parents.</br></br>  <br> Emotions are a completly different matter. <br> speaks about the difference of the emotions anyway <br>You literally said what I did you autist ahahahahaha<br>The content stays the same just like your autism.<br><br><br>There is still nothing suggesting that chopper meant someone else instead of nami's group as sanji even saved them after they talked.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm a rabid sanji hater but to be fair, he says most of the traitorous shit for show<br><br>When it boils down to serious shit he kicks in to gear like right here and protects his nakama<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=cv_<wbr>yExLbaaA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br> ahahahahaha <br><br>nigga I agree he's one retarded motherfucker but...</br></br></br>  <br> ... <br>Who is baiting who at this point?</br></br>  <br> sanji allowed Nami vs Califa to happen <br>He also opened those gates.</br></br>  <br> using diable jambe at fodder </br>  <br><br> Diable Mouton Shot on a mook <br><br>He's going to need Okama Kenpo soon, I feel it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Pretty cheap animation. They know that they shouldn't waste their budget on Sanji.</br></br>  <br>His moveset is really cool, he just needs some good fights. Considering that his abilities aren't even boring.</br>   Originally Oda planned on introducing fishmen as far back as Chapter 3. However, due to his editor he held it back, ending up introducing the concept during the Arlong Park Arc instead. <br><br>So how much influence do the editors have? It makes sense to give some tips to a new author that just started, but do they still change some of the stuff Oda wants to do?</br></br>  <br>In chapter 3 they had a lot of influence since one piece was a fledgling manga that could be cancelled at any time.<br>Now they have as much influence as Oda lets them have from respect.</br></br>   mashima spent so many years ripping off of One Piece <br><br> now its Oda's turn to R.I.P Kaidou of off Zeref </br></br>  <br> but do they still change some of the stuff Oda wants to do? <br>100%. They still tell him if they think that a disicion is complete shit. Also Oda (or was it his Editor?) said in an interview that oda only draws his own idea, but rarely takes one two from others. The thing is, we don't know if they meant the assistants, the ditors or  Kishi. </br></br>  Are there still people who think that Kaido ate 100 Zoan DFs?  <br><br>Mixed signals are always nice, aren't they?</br></br>  <br><br>An immortal wanting to off themselves isn't original though - it's not like Zeref is the first.</br></br>  <br>neither excludes the other.</br>  <br><br>He ate them in loads, so he skipped 2.</br></br>  <br>All of the Supernovas are because of the editors wanting something like them there. <br>They probably also pushed for the Law bromance since he's obscenely popular. <br>They probably also pushed Chopper being a cute sidekick other then a more developed character because merch.</br></br></br>  People say it's a shame he didn't have a proper fight since the crew met up again, but Zoro's fights have been complete shit up to now anyway. Not like it's a problem that Sanji didn't get none.<br>Best fight of the crew up to now has to be Franky Vs Senor Pink</br>  <br> Franky Vs Senor Pink <br>It was a horrible fight that only got redeemed at the end thanks to the flashback.</br></br>  <br>big influence.<br> In Sabaody, Oda didn't intend to introduce supernovas at first, but only 3 hours after the editor advised him to make the story more exciting, Oda wrote a new story in which supernovas appeared. <br><br><br>http://www.apforums.net/showthread.<wbr>php?t=29195&amp;page=39</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well after all if it sells, it sells.</br></br>  Post the face you made when Doffy got BTFO  <br><br> Supernovas at Sabaody might not have happened <br><br>Thank you based editor.</br></br></br></br>  <br>AP cancer please leave</br>  <br>this is a complete oda style explanation <br><br>10/10 would oda</br></br></br>  <br>Why do they have the best theme for the shittiest strawhat.</br>  <br><br>All the Dressrosa fights were pretty bad. When you cannot focus on something because you only see snippets of it, you lose interest. <br><br>I wonder if we will ever see a fight in OP again that isn't constantly interrupted by other shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> They probably also pushed Chopper being a cute sidekick other then a more developed character because merch. <br>That was Toei. Movie 3 was essentially Chopper The Movie.</br></br>  <br>Luffy vs Blackbeard when the time comes, hopefully. Shit will be cash.<br><br> well unlesas we count blackbeard's flashback as an interruption </br></br></br>    <br> they call him sama <br> they all fuck off after Sanji kicked his ass <br> scrub <br><br>Sanji haters are so fucking stupid</br></br></br></br></br>  What if Kaido's powers are like Animal Man from DC? <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima<wbr>l_Man#Powers_and_abilities<br>He can access a morphogenic field that gives him the powers of any animal.. like the strength of a T-Rex or the durability of a cockroach. Basically his body evolves these powers as he needs them and this is why he can't die.</br></wbr></br>  <br> There is still nothing suggesting that chopper meant someone else instead of nami's group as sanji even saved them after they talked. <br>What? This was after Nami and co were saved. Sanji, Nami, Brook, Momo were all in the same place. The people Chopper talked about saving in the beginning of the chapter might've been Nami and co, but Chopper is clearly talking about something else in that panel. There's something else.</br></br>  <br>Vergo vs Law + Smoker and Doffy vs Luffy + Law are the only decent post-ts fights so far. Everything else was subpar as fuck.</br>  <br><br>Are you implying he's not fodder? I like Sanji and all but seriously.</br></br>  <br> when Mr Oda said "Would it be more interesting if bunch of new characters showed up?" <br>It was Oda's idea, he already had the supernovas planned but would have introduced them later, from what is actually said.<br><br>I imagine he respects his editors a lot, they had huge control at the beginning, and his story skyrocketed into success at least somewhat because of them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think we'll get Luffy's flashback of his mom. For some reason Oda still has this as a mystery.</br>  <br>shame Doffi's fight was somehow worsened (at least to me) by Law's giant room he was keeping up all along. That really bothered me. Also Trebol was useless as shit.</br>  <br><br> Frank vs Senor Pink  <br> not decent <br><br>And you call yourself a man?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Bari bari no pistol wasn't based as fuck. <br> implying Law/Luffy and Gear 4th vs Doffy up until the shitty 10min downtime was subpar </br></br>  <br>probably a low executive of Kaidou<br>so not exactly a huge enemy but not even close to fodder</br></br>  <br>He's a Kaido pirate of unknown ranking except he's the highest of ones who are there.<br>I think you are just assuming he's fodder because he got kicked away by Sanji.</br></br>  So in this arc Zoro will meat his real parents, right?  <br>He's one of the weakest Strawhats. He last time he soloed a big enemy was back in Enies Lobby.</br>  <br>That was my thought. Keep in mind they're following a vivre card rather than a log pose so they might be looking for the heart pirates.</br>  <br><br>flashback =/= fight</br></br>  <br><br>I was referring to the fight as well though.</br></br>  <br>That's the point. Why is simple shounen logic to hard to understand for you?<br><br> Sanji/Chopper/Ceasar speak about saving nami/momo/brook <br> Nami and Co. get attacked <br> Sanji SAVES them <br> Chopper calls them after awhile, because he found something/something happened unrelated to saving nami's group <br><br>That's what happened you dense motherfucker</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Great. Sabaody is my favorite arc because of the Supernovas</br>  <br><br>Depends on what you consider fodder then.</br></br>  What the fucking happened on Sanji side?<br>Where the fuck are they right now?<br>Who is this fodder that's attacking them?</br></br>  <br>at least Eines Lobby for the most part showed the fights in their entirety before moving to the next one.<br><br>  toei adding a 3rd sky slicer <br>fuck em</br></br></br></br>  these sanji discussions are fucking unreal. Is it going to be like this until the end of one piece?<br><br>also Akainu should've sent Kizaru to dressrosa</br></br>  <br> Eines <br>germanfag pls</br></br>  <br>nameless mooks that get pulverized by dozens with one attack</br>  <br><br>It's going to be like this until Mr. Prince returns or he doesn't job. <br><br>I hope Oda flicks back to that Big Mom part which he has skipped and Sanji did something.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Meat? Where!?</br>  <br>for example Doflamingo's soldiers were fodder<br>but none of his executives were<br>Sanji could one shot people like Dellinger but he's not fodder</br></br></br>  <br>I can't wait for when he's going to use his new okama powers and people will go batshit insane flooding the threads with 'HAHA to be actually strong he needs to become an okama what a fucking faggot holy shit the weakest strawhat fuck sanji'</br>  <br>His ship role is "cook" and you expect him to compare combatively to someone like Usopp the sniper?<br>Of course he is weaker than the combat oriented crew members, but he's an excellent swimmer, rescues the whole crew repeatedly in non combat ways, fools plots of main antagonists, and can cook foods to make the main combatants of the crew even stronger.</br></br>  <br>Isn't implied she dies early since when we first see him he's already being raised by the bandit lady?</br>  <br><br> Sanji could one shot people like Dellinger <br><br>Not that I don't agree, but uh-oh.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That could have been said of Dragon too until he was suddenly introduced in Logue Town.</br>  <br>there could be lots of reasons for that<br>you seriously lack imagination</br></br>  <br> also Akainu should've sent Kizaru to dressrosa <br><br>Indeed. Kizaru probably would've just killed Doffy when he threatened him (assuming Doffy would've had the balls to do that).</br></br></br>  <br> I can't wait for when he's going to use his new okama powers <br>Literally worst meme.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Although what would've happened to the rest I wonder.<br><br>How would the SH remaining get away from him?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually even in Loguetown I think Dragon being Luffy's dad was still a mystery but I'm not sure.</br>  <br>be careful anon, I can already feel the<br><br> implying Kizaru could defeat Doflamingo <br><br>posts coming at you.<br><br><br>they wouldn't</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> they wouldn't <br> get sent to ID <br> Based Bon gets them out of ID again </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Supernovas would have appeared sooner or latter, Shabaondy would have been shorter but also a lot more boring.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This nigger has the best facial expressions.</br></br>  <br>No, Kizaru is the dog of the tenryubito. He would have killed Law and Luffy and wished Doflamingo luck since he's sanctioned by WG.</br>  <br>Its becuse big mom is luffys mother</br>  <br>Great. We have an attempted thread derail because some faggot can't discuss the topic.<br> hurrrrr ignore the content of the post to focus on grammar. </br></br>  <br> implying Kizaru would send them to ID <br><br>he would probably just murder them on the spot. Taking them to ID? Too much of a bother</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh shit yeah. <br><br>I forgot Sabaody would still carry over.</br></br></br></br>  <br> be careful anon, I can already feel the &gt;implying Kizaru could defeat Doflamingo posts coming at you. <br><br>Not really, even doffyfags are not that stupid</br></br></br>  <br>well some of them were arguing he could have easily defeated Kuzan just a few months ago, it wouldn't surprise me</br>  <br>Only Hakuba seemed to be able to take on, let alone one shot, Dellinger because he had the speed and took him by surprise. That aside Dellinger was pretty fast too and could've probably distracted Sanji a bit before getting one-shotted.</br>  <br>I could see her being alive (although I think she's dead since Dragon seems single) but I doubt she raised Luffy. I mean come on you'd think this would be brought up even a little Sabo or Ace in flashbacks.</br>  <br>it wasn't known but it was certain if you ever read a shonen before<br><br><br>of course she didn't raise him<br>no one said that<br>also I said she could be alive, I still think she's dead</br></br></br></br></br></br>  What if Kaido went to intercept Whitebeard because he knew he would die if he took on the marines and the shichibukai? Kaido didn't want the man who could potentially kill him to die.    <br> implying Kizaru could defeat Doflamingo <br><br>This nigga fucked up Marco shit and casually blast a hole into Whitebeard's chest. Doffy is child play to him.</br></br></br>  <br>Sanji's most badass moments always came when he was covertly sabotaging the enemies plans and fucking shit up behind the scenes.<br> Mr. Prince throughout the Alabasta saga <br> Infiltrating the Sea Train during Water 7 <br> Sneaking off and closing the Gates of Justice during Enies Lobby <br>Oda really needs to start writing Sanji like this again because it's where his character really shines.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They are at similar levels to where both of them wanted to avoid a real fight.<br>Kuzan tried to kill Doffy, Doffy took the attack unblocked undodged and was fine, so even if Kuzan won it wouldn't be through his logia.</br></br>  <br> 40 death sentences <br> Litteraly tortured for who knows how long and with what methods <br> Thinking he would die when taking on the marines and the Shichibukai </br></br></br>  Can we just go back to urouge posting?  <br>Yeah but the post I was replying to talked about Luffy having a flashback, which seems unlikely to me. Although I guess it's still possible since Luffy did only say he thought he didn't have a father, and no didn't have parents.</br>  <br>but of course</br>  <br> He actually thinks it would be a close call <br> Implying it wasn't him just going easy with the shot <br> Unblocked, undodged </br></br></br>  <br>He did nothing to Marco until Marco got distracted by big daddy having a fucking siezure mid combat. Even then it was a VA that cuffed Marco and Kizaru shot him in the back.<br>Kizaru is the least likeable admiral.</br></br>  <br>well it could be more of a Dragon flashback where we see Luffy just a few months old<br><br><br>wev'e already gone to the conclusion that Kaidou's cursing WB because:<br>1. WB died and Kaidou can't, he's jealous<br>2. WB was the only one able to hurt him</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kizaru is the least likeable admiral <br><br>while I do agree he looks like the shadiest one and possibly the most sociopathic, I can't help but like the guy. He's got style.</br></br></br>  <br> going easy on the guy trying to kill his good friend in front of his face after ignoring his warning not to kill him <br>Seems highly unlikely anon.<br>He tried to freeze Doffy's heart and kill him, which is stated. He just could not.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This is from Oda's editor.. <br><br> Q2: How far along is the story right now, percentage-wise? <br><br> A: He told me that the first part of the story, the part prior to the time-skip, was around halfway through. That was about 60 volumes, so maybe we’re at 70%? I don’t think it’s at 80% yet. Something like that. <br><br><br>So OP is about 70% done. I guess things will ramp up soon. A big Kaido arc and the ending arc would just about fill that time up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Kaido might be immortal but we don't know his actual strength yet. He gotten captured plenty of times so maybe he's not all that. Obviously he must have some strength to be a Yonkou but Shanks and Whitebeard may still be able to give him a match  <br> tried to literally smash Robin to pieces when she had done nothing wrong <br> froze the ocean floor so Jinbe wouldn't land in water after Akainu pierced his chest with a magma fist <br> killed Saul in cold blood for trying to stop a genocide <br> joined Blackbeard <br>Where the fuck do you get the idea he'd nerf himself vs someone who ACTUALLY pissed him off?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't mean to quote you there, ignore that.</br>  <br>For some reason I feel like that wouldn't be enough</br>  <br> trusting Oda's or his editor's estimates as facts. </br>  <br>Things change, maybe not the overall plot but new ideas get added etc.</br>  <br>Oda stated in 2014 it would have taken roughly another ten years to finish the whole thing.<br><br>Besides,<br><br> trusting Oda or anyone close to him about estimated times </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I'll get to see the end <br><br>Praise Buggy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He did not state that. He said he felt like he 'could' continue writing one piece for ten more years.<br>That's not the same as saying it has ten years left, it's saying that's the longest he could envision himself writing for it.</br></br>  <br>Its a shame Curly's opponent was Doffy, one of the most OP villains yet.</br>  Why is Sanji's pants still intact after all these fire kicks?  <br>arcs don't make 15% of the entire story</br>  <br>There's no way there's only two arcs left, they haven't even gone to elbaf yet.</br>  <br>I wish Diable Jambe was kept a high-tier power up though, like Asura.</br>  So I was rereading Sabaody and I had totally forgot this panel. Is there still someone but believe Zoro isn't the first mate? How can you not believe based Urogue?  <br><br><br><br>I'm glad you noticed pretending to be a fujoshi faggot wasn't working and came back to your older character to rp, but you should change characters to vary a bit. I'd pick some character that atracts retards and autists, like Kizaru</br></br></br></br>  <br>Obviously Zoro is the first one to join the crew, duh.</br>  <br><br> This speedreader level of comprehension. </br></br>  Who's your Prison School waifu?
