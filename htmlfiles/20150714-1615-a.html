Eight is going to be hard enough for me, I don't know how Kusugu is going to finish the gazillion color requests he took yesterday.</br>  Top this.  <br>mfw when that scene</br>  <br>I just watched this show. I was so fucking mad. I literally stopped watching for a week. The way the light leaves her eyes... holy shit.</br>    <br>I have yet to do anything necessitating such.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=clC<wbr>EmKyUSHw</wbr>  [ ]  ITT: Your reaction to the last anime you watched<br><br> Terraformars </br></br>  <br> Himouto!

And his two major losses have been either pretty brutal or soul-crushing.</br>  <br><br>How are people this stupid? The universe never got fucked up in the first place. If Astral messed with the universe in some way, would he have erased Yuma completely? If Yuma was back in Heartland it would never have gotten fucked up in the first place.<br><br>Arc-V and the previous series have no relations whatsoever except for notable people and places.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yusei is probably first place with only one loss to Kiryu that was interrupted by his D-Wheel breaking</br></br>  This is bunk. No VJump this week. I wanted some spoilers on the new set now that Dimension of Chaos is over and done with.  Who /hagswarm/ here?  <br>I never knew I wanted Kanade x Fumi so much.</br>  <br> Foomy blindly accepts her fate <br> Kiss monster blushing nervously <br>and here I thought she only spilled spaghetti for P</br></br></br>     Kaedefaggots settle down <br> t/u/mblr starts posting instead <br>Disgusting.</br></br>  <br>Have a combo.</br>  Are you a true enthusiast with godlike taste?  <br>i didn't know these were so specific</br>  <br>http://pastebin.com/0i8MZGDb<br>Don't know if this works for iphone, but it did for android.</br></br>    <br>  At least I don't filter netorare </br>   still no Futanari on female tag <br> still no anal focus tag <br>Why even bother living?</br></br>  Are you faglords ready for the next episode with tons of Papi's ass, Smith Legs and HORSE PUSSY? <br><br><br>also  there is any page for the live watch? </br></br></br>  <br>Harpy papi is happy papi</br>  <br>She's in to cucking other people now instead of getting cucked herself</br>  <br><br>This. I want the cloaca-shit meme to end.</br></br>  <br>What about the slimegirl?</br>  Reminder that MC canonically has a small dick.  I WANT OFF THE MADARAME WILD RIDE<br><br>I want Kio to end the manga already. He has already ruined everything that used to be good about Genshiken.</br></br>  <br>Keiko is the only good thing about it now.</br>  Maybe he'll slowly stop releasing chapters and devote all his time to Spotted Flower.  <br>Doesn't Saki have a boyfriend ? what happened when he confessed to her</br>  <br><br> ruin Genshiken <br> draw fugly babies <br><br>choose wisely</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only part of this shitty continuation that was worth reading.</br>    WA SEY WAAAAAA<br>BO BO BO<br>what happened to this great show. are there 500 episodes of it now?</br></br>  sound euphonium was easily 10/10  <br><br>Etotama was fucking shit. Deal with it moefags</br></br>  <br>Exactly the kind of in depth reasoning I expect from fun hating edgelords like yourself</br>  <br> tips meme </br>  <br>Nah,I'm just some shitposting for fun</br>  <br>You should watch Etotama for fun instead</br>  It's fucking finally time for some reverse NTR.  <br>just wait until the ride is over before you get on. Im personally going to wait until the series ends before I take on this wild ride. The better be high levels of suffering when its over</br>  <br>I hope it's just getting started. When will Haruka break anyway?</br>  I don't even understand this shit, the MC asks his wife to have sex with someone else? This has got to be satire.  <br>This is actually a thing. Search cuckold.</br>  <br>I believe this means she's pretty broken. Also, at the end of the chapter those were  divorce papers. </br>  What's the biggest asspull that you've seen in anime?  <br>Is that Madoka?</br>  <br>This so much, and Magi revival of that trap guy. Death for true cheap "feels" is just disgusting.</br>  <br>It's stated in-universe that it's perfect. The only way to escape is to not be captured.</br>  <br>Reminder that the Infinite Tsukuyomi was never about killing anyone, and if everything had gone according to plan there would've been no deaths whatsoever.</br>  <br>Gaara was always able to control sand due to being a ninja. He got his ridiculous stamina and chakra load the same way Naruto did - through his Tailed Beast. The automatic sand shield was explained as the love his mother had for him staining the sand as she died. Quite why there would be a mass of sand in an operating room, I'm not quite sure.</br>   “P-Put some pajamas on already! Why are you butt naked anywho?!” <br><br> “It’s your fault.” Her condemning eyes seemed to look right through him. <br><br> “Oh really now. Let’s hear your reasoning.” <br><br> “You took my clothes off.” <br><br> “Urk! Ahem!” he spluttered. <br><br> “Do you have a cold?” <br><br> “No! It’s because you said something weird!” <br><br> “It was the truth.” <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128052878#p128052878">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This conversation is so generic and stupid that at first I thought it was made up to make fun of shows like that.</br>  Best girl but OP is a faggot.  My thoughts were thus:<br><br>I could not stand the main character. I cannot repeat this enough.<br><br>Whenever either Mashiro or Nanami is mentioned in one of /a/'s interminable "best girl"/"who won" threads, I can't help but remember how much of a whiny, worthless asshat Sorata was.<br><br>I hear he's supposed to be better in the source novel. Is that true?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, he stoped being a pussy and fucked Mashiro everytime he had the chance.<br><br> “Do you really want to have sex that much?” <br><br> “Of course!” <br><br> “Is that the only thing you want to do?” <br><br> “N-No way at all! I-It’s because I love you that I want to do it with you! So don’t say I only want to dothatkind of thing. Definitely not!” he insisted vehemently. He was truly frantic, and his desperation seemed more awkward and unsightly by the second. <br><br> Mashiro was unimpressed. <br><br> “I-I love you, Mashiro!” <br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128052878#p128053315">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Typical Mashiro faggot, everyone. Doing shitty fanfictions for a shit girl. Good job.</br>  Did hinata deserve to win? <br><br>Rereading the series she became a little too obsessive about naruto. To the point where it was unhealthy as fuck. I feel she never grew up in that sense as winning negated the probability of her finding the strength to move on.</br></br>  <br>Troid must have bitched at the other mod for trying to holocaust you Narutards. Be glad you can kill /a/ for good now with your faggotry because of him. Naruto is the MLP of anime/manga, it makes sense that Troid would try to protect it as much as possible.</br>  <br> Giving the Byakugan to the pottery child of Ninja Jesus' 1 and 2 would be like giving a Red Shirt to Space Jesus. <br><br>No, the byakugan was useless because the only ones who had it were a miniboss that got defeated early in the series only to then get relegated to fodder and the love interest that never won a fight.<br><br>Giving it to the new MC would be Kishi forcing himself to give it a power-up or to show it being useful. But that goes against Burrito being the SN lovechild so he doesn't have it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but that's more a case of not being Sasuke or Naruto more than anything. <br><br><br>Even so. If Kishi gave the Byakugan to the kids, they could get retarded power-up hax as well. <br>I'm confident it's just Kishi being a shit writer and jobbing everyone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> kill /a/  <br>Newfag plz</br></br>  <br>That funny considering you're the biggest faggot in thread.</br>  I want to ____ Ritsu's forehead.  shit on</blockquote>]
