[ This is a mom.   Looks like one.    She's not a good mom but she's a good plot vehicle.   This is an aunt.   reminds me of the guy feeding a watermelon to a monkey   THIS IS A DISH  WE NEED TO GO SHAFTER  She definitely looks old enough to be my mom  https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-1/</wbr>   50% yes    Haruno &gt; shit &gt; Yukino    What happened to your body, Haru-san-senpai?      I can't into translation but this is roughly what happen:   8man:"let's calm down for now and talk about this tomorrow, give her a call just in case"    Yukino:"K."    Yukino:"Moshi moshi Nee-san? let's calm down for now and talk about this tomorrow, I gave you a call just in case." (Exact same wording)             That's because the story revolves around the club, not the romance. Romance within the club has been treated as a secondary issue early on, and later on a major problem by the story and the characters throughout the series. As of Vol 11 it still seems to be the case and we're looking at maybe one or two volumes left before the series ends.  8man's romantic development with both club members is pretty weak, and Watari investing precious narrative space on developing him with Iroha only undermines that further. Considering Destinyland was barely 2 volumes ago it would be very questionable both from a pacing and a narrative standpoint if someone from the club were to, for instance, win 8man's heart in Volume 12.     KOUME!  It's eight of clock!  WAKE UP!       of clock   Good morning.   WAKE UP     The 3rd of October can't come soon enough.    Fuck me, I'm late as fuck today.      Who is best shingeki and why is it Annie?   I'm hoping she gets a redemption arc, seeing as her crimes are far less than BR's.    That is a bee.    No. He has nothing in common with Makoto. Makoto is a cute tomboy Idolmaster, Bert is not cute or a tomboy.     her crimes are far less than BR's  Seriously? Annie is responsible for the same amounts of deaths as BR, since she called the titans in Shiganshina and maybe in Trost as well.     That's a bee, not an ant.   King Crimson is based edition  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87     1. Catch the Rainbow 2. Killer Queen 3. Soft &amp; Wet  Honorable mentions: Paisley Park, D4C, Death 13, Black Sabbath, Moody Blues, The Hand, Weather Report       jojo is gay    Gonna have to go for 5 since they're so tight.  1) King Crimson 2) Killer Queen 3) D4C 4) The Emperor 5) Diver Down  For some reason I really like the idea of a gun stand. Sex Pistols is cool but really limited compared to Emperor, so that's why it wins.   Neato, I'll start the tournament on the hour. It'll be JoJo's first, then major villains.   <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127113083#p127113590">Click here</a> to view the full text.                    jojo is fabulous    Aight, thanks for the input   ITT: describe /a/ with a screenshot   Mekakucity Actors      Pork Whaler   God, that takes me back. I'm so glad that wer hardly have tripfags anymore, the only one who's halfway noticable is lelouch, and he's too stupid to even really be an annoyance.        This made me cry     You should try it, puts a comfortable tension on the joints.     ITT: Shows with catchy OP's  I still hear my office mate humming this intro https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=uAR<wbr>n2MCUZN4</wbr>  [ ]      Sono Chi no Sadame is the only catchy one. The rest are solid though.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YGB<wbr>w4uCZ4hA</wbr>  [ ]  There are people in this thread right now who don't want to have a pure time.     jesus why, I can't get this out of my head   Everyone ready to drink Doffyfag tears tomorrow?     activates eye power   another Rayleigh flashback   It didn't work huh   What will you do now Luffy?          Today I will defeat Doflamingo!   That would be one of the biggest trolls in manga history if Oda makes her words come true. Thankfully, she's shit so it won't. Would be worth it for the reactions though.        Madara obliterated the entire cast    Being this fucking new.   So does anyone know where I can read updated One Piece Party chapters? There's supposed to be this chapter where Luffy was asking Law if he had a tattoo on his penis, too...   ITT: OTP   ZR vs Tights    ZR   With tights  What is wrong with you      I once heard that the most extreme japanese school girls go as far as using some water solvent glue product specifically designed to keep socks up.    thighs!= tight Maybe that anon misread the OP  like me.      There's the sheer definition of form of the legs, the slight opacity allowing you to see the skin and feet. If there's butt showing, there's the pantyline. When the contrast of lighter skin and darker tights, or lighter clothes, is made, it's delicious.  Also, tights lend themselves to office outfits, which is its own nook, and in general, tights tend to feel more formal than ZR does, since ZR is a teen and young adult thing.    How odd.         I like ZR the most because you can see some skin of the thighs. fucking fuels my imagination  No thread? Fixed! the cover of the second BD is out. I thought it gonna sell around 10k but now i think it's going to be 12k thanks to Dick Suck   http://kekkaisensen.com/products/bd<wbr>02.html</wbr>       Now you know to never ever download a funi rip ever again.    who is this?     Doctor who appears later in the manga    nice   You will never survive   What is Kumiko saying to Shu1?   Other forums pretty much unanimously support the yuri. Only /a/ has these unruly hetfags, perhaps because they spill over from the SJW backlash on /v/.    That fig is so shitty   Which section would you join and why?   How can you wear those fucking dirty shoes? Are you literally poor or 16 years old?     Wearing shoes inside the house  Pls.    Is Photoshop CS6 enough to scanlate or do I need another program to? Or should I rather use Gimp or something?    scanlations   commercial license       slow  Only if you're using a toaster   commercial license  Why the fuck would you need that for scanlating?    caring about newer versions of PS  The old versions still do everything you could ever want           What's the best program for digital painting and drawing?  What's the best version of PS?    Adobe is moving PS to the cloud  I just downloaded CS6, but at the site I got it I could already download a cracked CC (2015)...        GIMP is just as efficient as Photoshop  I've extensively worked with both and this is just not true. The only reason you are defending this shitty program is your ideology, not the software itself.   you're set for life  Assuming that people will still use the same programs in 20 years, assuming that people will keep developing GIMP, assuming that nobody even less competent than the current developers is going to take over messing everything up even further than it already is and so on and so forth.   You are also implying that it's hard to switch to a different/inferior program once you've learned how to use the current industry leader other programs are copying.         When is P.A. Works going to make their next masterpiece?   Do you have problems with the English grammar?    Tari Tari was comfy and fun.    Everyone praises PA Works for background, but its not them making it. Its subcontractor studio they hide. PA Works achivement is that they use them often and know how to fit them right.  Animation wise PA Works is not among the greatest, but consistency and quality control is high - nearing them to KyoAni standards, also still far.  The main strength of Progressive Animation Works is their digital department and using modern means of animation and effects, quite similar to KyoAni once again.  Their downside - with few exceptions of explicit design/color scheme choices, their graphic animation style is very recognizable regardless of character design/animators because of how lineart and digital coloring and effects are done.  Technically wise, their biggest work was Hanasaku Iroha, which so far they did not yet outdo (since HI had the biggest budged because was funded by local goverment), similarly how KyoAni still did not do anything visually at Hyouka quality.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1Fz<wbr>gMtbmNgY</wbr>  [ ]  That said, they did not do any work that`ll put them to TOP tier of studios yet. Maybe if they get decent budget movie. For comparison, Sunrise:  <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127109414#p127113556">Click here</a> to view the full text.                    It's motherfucking called Glasslip.    Tari Tari is a great show.   No one care Kyoani in this thread.      Will you remember the Etotamas when they're gone?    I don't get it     Take a wild guess.     Very nice work.     Yes, but only because I'll have the character songs downloaded to remind me.    I love that Rabbit has a little apron on her bikini bottom. </blockquote>]
