I don't mind if its lewd or not.  <br><br>but  I could show you if you add me on skype: Indigo.hero </br></br>  <br>You look like a fag.</br>  <br>I don't remember orange bug from Gunbuster</br>  <br>Yeah, no. Just give me a link to your site or some shit.</br>  <br>I propably do, but if I can draw stuff you like, why would it matter?</br>  <br>That is because it is a buster corps bug from Diebuster, the Gunbuster sequel. Them and Eva were all made by Gainax so it makes sense.</br>  Requesting Adlet, anythings fine, preferably something "action-y"  Requesting Guren being caught trying on Shinoa's uniform.  <br>Tumblr is filled with doodles so lemme just link something im currently working on (just needs some adjustments and shades)<br><br> http://i.imgur.com/ubXGGZJ.png </br></br></br>  So you wake up, and go take a shower. You put the water temperature just right and jump in. <br>Now you reach for the shampoo bottle and start squeezing it, but then <br> no shampoo comes out <br>How would your favorite character (or waifu if you want, I don't discriminate) react when this happens</br></br></br>  <br>Is that your best in terms of feet? If you're capable of better, I'd possibly be interested.</br>  <br>This sounds like a neo-waifu thread question.</br>  <br>She'd start screaming and banging her head against the wall until she collapsed</br>  <br>as I said, it's not over yet, so yeah I think I am "capable of better" I'm really okay with spending more time on them if it means that you'll appreciate the final product better. posted my skype here if you're interested </br>   <br>Delivery.<br>Sorry I took so long. I got busy and couldn't draw as much as I wanted.</br></br>  <br>Naisu</br>  <br>Really well done.</br>  <br>OR here, amazing.</br>  Requesting Issei from High School DxD with his full Balance Breaker ( Ddraig and Albion arms) doing Hell And Heaven move from GaoGaiGar<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EnV<wbr>lcBXpTtc</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Requesting Teto with her top opened in a cumshot picture on her face + chest or into her womb, smiling and double peace no ahegao.  I'd like color of this Ayame delivery , IIRC she was wearing the catgirl outfit from Prism Ilya. There's a reference of her   WIP for armored Kotetsu <br>Any comments or concerns would be welcome.</br>  Requesting this fusion chart, thanks in advance.<br>Of Futayo Honda, Angela, and Jun the Swan</br>  I'd like to see these two done<br>http://i.imgur.com/okXtfqC.jpg<br>http://i.imgur.com/Zdixm0Y.jpg<br>sorry if they're rough and all, even clean lines would be nice.</br></br></br>  <br>Looks great. That's some funny shit. Thanks for drawing this.</br>  <br>Who's the drawfag</br>  Began sketching Rena's sprite, I'll continue it later.  <br>That's some nice linework. <br>I still think the fold on the skirt in the crotch are too extreme though. Especially as it looks like you have wind blowing from the other direction.</br></br>  <br>Squatz n' oats, smurf, m'boy! She's achieved trex mode.</br>  <br>Digging the thickness.</br>  <br>I'll rework on the skirt for the lineart anyway, not satisfied of some stuffs already when looking at it, but won't have the occasion to continue working on it 'till tuesday anyway. Even with the wide hips and thighs intended, the legs could be a bit thinner for example.</br>  <br>Glad you like it.<br><br>I don't use a name.</br></br></br>  <br>Well the thick thighs are a matter of preference but the skirt is just not acting like a skirt. <br>I get that you did volume work under there that you want to show off but sometimes you just have to hide all of it.</br></br>  <br>Will you do Rika and Satoko?</br>  <br>I look forward to this.</br>  <br> I don't use a name <br>You. I like you.</br></br>  <br>oh I see do you have an art blog?</br>  <br>Neither, I don't like my stuff enough to post it.</br>  <br>No, that's not planned for now. after cleaning and coloring this one I intended to do at least one pose variation (same position as the original), and I wanted to make the casual clothes versions as well for Rena and Mion.<br><br>And besides her "official" sprite expressions, I always felt like she was lacking some others, mainly when being serious, I think I'll try that too.<br><br>And after that, the next character I want to draw is  Takano </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't like you as much</br>  <br>I'm sorry. I'll get better and more confident.</br>  <br>Deliverin', it's finally done!<br>Thanks to all the anons who helped me along the way.<br>I'm never underestimating backgrounds again<br>I actually finished this morning, but the thread was auto-saging and I passed out before the new thread was made.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good job, drawfag</br>  <br>This is really good.</br>  <br>Nice job, I enjoyed watching that progress.</br>  <br>Aside from what another anon said about the skirt fabric, those hands are way too small in relation to her head (or maybe it's just that her head is a bit too big for her body). There's also something off about her head's placement in relation to her neck. They don't look connected.</br>  <br>Great job drawamigo, that looks wonderful! And seeing the progress sure was interesting, great great.<br>Thank you a lot! Way more than I expected</br></br>  <br>Is she a mini-GTS or is that just a really small torpedo?</br>  <br>Is there any specific height difference between these two?</br>  coloring delivery! only for 1 out of 2 pics though  going to go sleep now<br>i can't link back drawthread 1534 for some reason, it's deleted, i guess. ayamefag didn't post request for the last 2 threads too</br>  <br>Neither character's height is discussed in canon, but I believe Reco is about 5 inches taller than Reimu.</br>  <br>Thanks, I'm still sketching so this might take a while.</br>  I wish Smurf would quit posting his WIP that aren't related to general drawthread's requests. Didn't you try to fish for responses in /ic/ already?  <br>I don't see a problem, drawfags should be about the art, not bending to requester's whims.</br>  <br>But we have a board for that.</br>  Posting the collage pastebin list on request from the WWD thread.<br><br>http://pastebin.com/YrDDnzK2<br><br>Subject to change.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What is this?</br>  <br>heh, didn't even have to request her for her to be on her, I guess that's just how perfect my waifu is</br>  <br> sample <br> artifacts </br></br>  <br>Remove Oora</br>  <br> oora! <br>haha</br></br>  <br>I'm not entirely sure if I want to see her in there or not.</br>  <br>Do not remove Oora.</br>  <br><br>I'm not ycake so can't edit it, but I'm sure he's around the threads somewhere. Either that or he's working on requests for the WWD.</br></br>  <br><br> It can't be that bad, right </br></br>  <br>How was my waifu picked for this exactly?</br>  So, WWD is kill?  <br>No  ? </br>  <br>What, are you not down with Hulkamania?</br>  <br>If whoever made this could please remove kurome from that list, thanks.</br>  <br><br>Tried to access from phone but the catalog doesn't show the drawthread though</br></br>  <br>What are the contents for this collage?</br>  <br>Because some retarded faggot put the title in the name field.<br><br/></br></br>  <br>That's because the idiot who made it didn't put anything in the subject field, search for weekend</br>  <br><br>Ah, thanks a lot!</br></br>  <br>Nice, but I think you missed her tongue</br>  <br>So what's the practical difference between these threads and the WWD threads?</br>  <br>  There isn't really. </br>  <br>WWD has more WWE superstars.</br>  <br>WWD has become somewhat of a spectacle as desperate anons beg for deliveries and start flinging dung at everything that can hold a pencil in its hand</br>  <br> soak-a-slut <br><br> everything is complete </br></br></br>  <br>I'm mostly finished with the sketch now, <br>Is there anything I should change? <br>I'd appreciate it if someone could point out any mistakes, I'm pretty bad at noticing things like that.<br><br><br>From a drawfag perspective, WWD has more general requests, this one often has very specific ones.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>WOW! thank you so much!<br>this looks great so far!<br>Can you have reimu looking up at Reco instead of looking into her shoulder like you have it?<br>Thanks!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not anymore it doesn't, janitors just cleaned fucking house.</br>  <br>Sure, I'm glad you like it so far</br>  <br>so, is a over the whole holding hands thing or are people still upset about that stuff?</br>  <br>It's an old meme anon. Holding hands is the most lewd thing imaginable.<br><br>Better handholding that watching a waifu get dicked by some other bloke.</br></br></br>  <br>Which Akari is that? ARIA?<br>If so remove her please.</br></br>  Requesting Frenda as a magical girl fending off a tentacle monster, but losing badly.<br> Or losing on purpose. </br>  Any hardcore or brutal fucking requests? No animals, though.  <br>doggy with darudayu from pov</br>  <br>You got it</br>  <br>woah that's a cutie, is show by rock good?</br>  <br>its chock full of waifus</br>  <br>If you like cuteness with bad writing, yes.</br>  <br>be sure to have tailpulling</br>  <br>No concerns at all, it's looking great so far</br>  are waifu drawthreads not a thing anymore  <br/>  <br><br/></br>  <br><br><br><br>Not to specifically call you guys out but am I the only one that searches "waifu" to find the WWD?</br></br></br></br>  Requesting fusion of Arata Demon Lord Form, Issei Balence Breaker and Tatsumi Incursio.  <br>If I didn't catch it in the catalog right after it was made I too might've missed it.</br>  <br>No, the person who made the OP was an idiot this week, search for "weekend". OP didn't put waifu or WWD anywhere in the entry post.</br>  <br>Remove Rias Gremory from this, please. I do not want her included because some sack of shit wants to double dip between here and the WWD with his requests, even more so because this is a stupid fetish in the first place.<br><br>Thank you.</br></br></br>  <br>I guess 4chanx searches the name field as well as the rest of the OP.</br>  <br>I didn't request in the WWD, friend. If you'd read the whole post, specifically didn't request in the WWD, I was wishing others well in their own request hunts.<br><br>Moreover, didn't we already have a whole convo about this two threads back? Even the non-dunkfags thought you were being an aspie about it trying to shoot down anyone but you requesting Rias pics for anything, dunk or not.</br></br></br>  <br>Okay good, will probably finish the linework+hatching before the threads done.</br>  <br>I haven't stepped foot into the these threads specifically and solely since I wanted to avoid you because you completely disgust me. Believe it or not, more than one person in the entire world does not like you.<br><br>Do me the personal favor and stay in here. You can request whatever stupid fetishized garbage in here and apparently nobody gives a shit, you'll even get into a collage. Thanks.</br></br></br>  <br>I love you too anon. Your single-minded devotion to filling my womb with your surging hatred makes me doki doki.</br>  <br>You want a mind-broken pregnancy edit or a holy-shit-my-brain-just-broke-from-<wbr>cumming-too-many-times face edit with a close-up impregnation window?</wbr></br>  <br>the second one</br>  <br>Oi fuck off</br>  <br> Marika not on the list </br>  <br>Marika getting pounded in the ass while being pressed against a glass window.</br>   (Cross-thread)<br/>  <br><br>If only those two could be combined...but the world is not ready.</br></br>  <br>OR here, thanks a bunch!</br>  <br>Without any other context, I might have enjoyed seeing Kaede in a dunk tank scenario (certainly not one labeled "soak-a-slut", of course). However, I don't feel comfortable knowing that people proposing the hypothetical collage and its target audience are a group that fetishizes this kind of thing. Please remove her from the list.</br>  <br>It's not fetishistic, just a strange kind of love</br>  <br> it's not fetishistic <br>Who the hell are you kidding? The only reason this shit got kicked out of /d/ is because they considered it "too tame", otherwise you faggots would still be drowned in futashit on that board.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127891311 <br>Is it? Is it really?</br>  <br>I'm not opposed, exactly, but I do kind of have a bad taste in my mouth because of the negative connotations associated with the topic.<br><br>I'm not gonna request her taken out, though.</br></br></br>  Requesting more Deadpool crossovers!

Is there a method to getting motivated to draw? Its super fun learning different things and seeing slight improvements from nothing but the actual act of drawing leaves me horribly empty.  <a href="http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1436383382250.webm" target="_blank">http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1436383382250<wbr>.webm</wbr></a><br> Draw what really happens, what they couldn't air.  Rape. </br>  <br><br>Everybody finds their own ways for motivation, you just have to find yours.</br></br>  <br>I know that feeling, personally, I like to look through my old art notebooks and seeing my progress. It's kind of the feeling of: "I'm going to get better if I just keep going, so I'll just keep drawing until I finish this art notebook too."</br>  <br><br>My life is so shitty that the only refuge I can afford is drawing and masturbating to 2D girls.</br></br>  <br>You could try to pump yourself up, or set a reward for a goal.</br>  Requesting Paladin holding Fighter down and lustfully tonguing her navel, saliva dripping from her mouth and a sense of sexual pleasure on her face as Fighter squirms at her appendage probing her umbilicus.

The LNs are amazing if you haven't read them already.</br>   Akabayashi episode next <br>Looks interesting. Wasn't expecting the yakuza characters to get very much development.</br>  <br>It's like Confederacy of Dunces, just a bunch of stupid people doing stupid things and you laugh as their plots collide</br>  <br>Celty/Shizuo is more a BrOTP.</br>  it's like ppl ITT didn't watch s2. shinra and Celty best  <br> Akabayashi episode next <br>Nice</br></br>  Bloody hell thought there was no thread until i realized the topic was Drrrr and not Durarara.  <br><br>m8 all he has is Varona for a love interest and Akane who has a crush on him, but he treats her too nicely for that. <br><br>Also what are your guys opinions on SH so far?</br></br></br></br>  Subs for ep 2 when?  <br>5 minutes</br>  <br><br>Just noticed the annoyed look she is giving Akane. Nice.</br></br>  Subs when?  I watched the first season of this, haven't really watch anime in a while but should I pick this back up?  <br><br>Sure unless you want to read the LN's instead.</br></br>  <br>Na I'm not that much of a weeb anymore.</br>  <br> weeb <br><br>Do you crossboard by any chance?</br></br></br>  <br>Are you saying you don't use other boards? Of course I do /k/ /v/ /int/ etc</br>  Self-advertisement never be such strong before.<br><br>Also dem yandere triangle. And Mika turn out to know almost everything, probably more than Izaya.</br></br>  <br><br>That probably explains why you used the word weeb to describe.</br></br>  Wow, Vorona<br><br><br>About 90 minutes, +- 30</br></br></br>  Did HS fail to ripp it again or am I blind?  <br><br>Are we likely to get Cencoroll 2 any time soon?</br></br>  Simon is best girl.  <br>CR moved it to 10:00 again.</br>    <br>Probably not.</br>  <br>Since CR already done it 2 weeks in a row, I wonder if this mean the schedule change to 10:00 is permanent.</br>  Dead subs.  <br>They're out on CR so I guess we're waiting for CReep since HS can't get their schedule right</br>    <br><br>OH SHIT thought i was on /vg/ for a second. A fellow cup viewer hey?</br></br>  OUT  Didn't the OVA for Sho have two parts? One was the hotpot, what was the other? When we will be getting them both?  Ryuugamine is becoming even more of a psychopath. And holy shit, Mika x Seiji is the best OTP.  <br>Man they're cute.<br><br>I need a trilby.</br></br></br>  This is getting interesting.   whole episode was about Namie Seiji and Not-Celty <br><br>Meh. Can't say I liked it much.<br>Still, Celty in a schoolgirl uniform, at least.</br></br></br>  <br>Also yahari oregairu was licensed, but I fear that it just serve as an excuse for more the cancerous general threads.</br>  Why does Shinra get the dramatic slow motion walk that fades to white in the OP? What does it mean?  <br>Shinra's a fucking psycho and more important to the plot than you'd think</br>  I went into this season hyped for a fucking psychopath Mikado. <br>When are we getting psychopath Mikado.</br>  <br>Soon</br>  I think I like DRRR too much. I can't even identify why I find it so great, but ever since it started airing again this year, each episode's end leaves an ache in my heart.  <br>just fucking threesome already</br>  <br>I wonder if they'll do all of Baccano</br>  So stalker &gt; rest ?  <br>I see no reason for them not to.</br>  VampxDrrr confirmed?  <br>Why?</br>  <br>stalker &gt; izaya, at the very least. Could've just read his info to get the rest of it.</br>  <br>Izaya is probably aware of the bugs</br>  Seems like we'll get 4 episodes for Vol 7.<br>Next epidode for the Red Demon and Ep 4 for Shizuo/Vorona antics</br>  Is Seiji the most righteous person in the show?  <br> Mika x Seiji <br> Not Namie x Seiji </br></br>  Test.  <br>Only Tom is more sane</br>  <br><br>I really do hope Shizuo becomes a detective with Tom as his sidekick in SH.</br></br>  Am I the only one who like the OP? <br>I don't think the song is that bad, and I'm sucker for OP that sung by the main character.</br>  <br>It's better than I first thought but it's still the worst OP of DRRR.<br>ED is good though</br></br>  <br>I really like it too. Listened to it three times today and now I will listen to it again. I don't think it's worse than the previous OPs, they are all different in good in their own ways.</br>  <br>I like the design of the OP but the song itself is obviously not as good as the previous ones</br>  Is he going to become interesting soon?  <br>It's the same OP problem, as with the first season of DRRRR. You see, the first opening of the second season was setting the mood like "here's some weird shit still going on and YOU WILL FUCKING ENJOY IT" ("you will see some weird shit soon in this city, get FUCKING READY" in the first season) and now we get a boringfest all over again. It just doesn't work for this.</br>  <br>No. He retires by the end of the season and sells the Dollars to Yagiri Corporation.</br>  <br><br>Yes as you see his slow decent into madness as he starts purging cunts.</br></br>  <br>He never was. No matter how much the author tries to.</br>  <br>This is great news! I've read only the 9th novel but the writing was good. Fucking finally after 5 years of waiting.</br>  <br><br>Most of the LN's are already translated so why should i care?</br></br>  <br>Because supporting the author by buying their books? Or is the answer just buy figures to support them?</br>  <br>Because the fantranslations are at best mediocre</br>  <br><br>I frankly don't care about supporting them. Plus the scans of the Yen press translations will be up online a bit after its release anyway.</br></br>  Ending song of the season?  <br>You read poor translations.</br>  Whats the problem with watching anime using vlc. I'm on a linux, what are the alternatives? Mplayer?  <br> linux <br>You mean GNU/Linux.<br>Seriously though, don't make me find the copypasta.<br>Calling GNU/Linux "Linux" is like calling VLC "ffmpeg".</br></br></br></br>  Do not respond. Move along and do your duty.  mpv player.  <br> no fun allowed <br>This is why we can't have nice things on /a/ anymore.<br><br>Let's make this the new meta thread?<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127937778 <br>What's mainly enjoyable for women is clitoral stimulation. Vaginal penetration isn't optimal for that. There's chance of stimulating the g-spot but tough luck I guess. Other than that, having an orifice penetrated is a pretty intrusive emotion. Think about the sheer number of men terrorized by the idea of having something enter their anus, despite prostate stimulation making you cum buckets (most don't know, but even if they did know, and also knew that with lubricant it's also totally painless, they would still be terrorized). Men think that women's "rape fantasies" and "wanting to be dominated" somehow makes them want that penetration, but I'm very strongly inclined to believe that those "rape" and "domination" fantasies are ultimately with gentle and loving men who are just "dominant" in their personality and not as in rough sex. Getting penetrated is just psychologically heavy.<br><br> I thought this was what radfems were arguing for with their slutwalks. <br>Heh, no. Slutwalks signify that a person should be allowed to wear whatever she/he wants to wear, and not have people assume "lol that must mean she wants to get fugged."<br><br><br>Yeah, this should take care of this thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> what's the problem with vlc </br>  <br> linux <br><br>The proper term is GNU.<br>The GNU project started developing an operating system in about '83. They made many central components. The kernel was missing. In about '92 Linux (a kernel) came around and once it was licensed under the GNU license people started using GNU with Linux. This means the operating system is GNU, with Linux as the kernel.<br><br>If you think the kernel is more central/important/big than other parts of an operating system, you're mistaken. In terms of size, surely X.Org is huge as well, and it's very central too, yet you won't hear people call the operating system X.Org, or mention X.Org in the name at all. This is because it's only one component, although it does many things including talking to hardware at the low-level. Similarly, the kernel is just one component that talks to hardware and does some other important low-level things. But none of these are more important than the tasks of GNU components such as GCC/Autotools/Yacc/Bison/etc. (the compiler and related tools used to build everything), Glibc (the C library which virtually *all* software on the system links against, including X.Org), GRUB (the bootloader that loads the kernel in first place), GNU Bash (the login shell!), GNU coreutils/findutils/grep/sed/awk, and many other such tools which make the system POSIX compliant and are necessary for most software and scripts to run on the operating system at all...<br><br>And if you say "but those components can be replaced", then obviously X.Org and Linux can also be replaced. Wayland based systems are on the way, and there is already e.g. Debian GNU/kFreeBSD which is the Debian GNU system running on the FreeBSD project's kernel.<br><br>To summarize, in terms of project/culture GNU is the project and operating system; and in terms of significance and irreplaceability of components, GNU components are definitely not any less important than X.Org and Linux.<br><br>Therefore, it makes most sense to say GNU, not Linux or GNU/Linux.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nothing.<br><br>Some 2008 meme when VLC was bad.

Torvalds is not the authority on what to call systems that consist of the GNU operating system and the Linux kernel.

It can only do exact 2x upscales, but my PC is having no problems doing super-xbr upscaling and Lanczos downscaling without dropping frames, and the result is visibly far superior to Jinc in certain situations like the one in this comparison.

Also less annoying to say.<br><br>Reason explained non-ironically in . It's a meme, but one speaking truth.</br></br>  <br>The Linux Journal speculated that Stallman's advocacy of the combined name stems from frustration that "Linus got the glory for what [Stallman] wanted to do."[42]<br><br>Others[specify] have suggested that, regardless of the merits, Stallman's persistence in what sometimes seems a lost cause makes him and GNU look bad. For example, Larry McVoy (author of the proprietary software BitKeeper, once used to manage Linux kernel development) opined that "claiming credit only makes one look foolish and greedy".[43]<br><br>Many users and vendors who prefer the name "Linux"[specify] point to the inclusion of non-GNU, non-kernel tools such as the Apache HTTP Server, the X Window System, or the KDE workspace in end-user operating systems based on the Linux kernel. As stated by Jim Gettys, originator of X:<br><br> There are lots of people on this bus; I don't hear a clamor of support that GNU is more essential than many of the other components; can't take a wheel away, and end up with a functional vehicle, or an engine, or the seats.

He looks like alot like the original titan.<br><br>I think Isayama may have tipped them off to something.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eren beating Reiner and Mikasa beating Annie will be easy, but how will Armin beat Bert?</br>  <br>You're not the first assuming this, retard.</br>  <br>crying and yelling at him<br>Bertolt is a soft nigga</br></br>  <br>with jokes</br>  <br>Eren/Reiner, Bert/Mikasa, Annie/Armin.</br>  <br>With his super mind powers.</br>  <br>hey it worked here against that bearded titan</br>  <br> Bert/Mikasa <br>No connection between them and it would be boring as fuck to see her just run up on him and slice him out of the titan. Bert is easily stronger than Reiner or Annie, he can't be taken down with swords, but with tactic. Armin is already the humble crybaby out of EMA and he already fucked with Bert once, so he'll do it again.</br></br>  <br>why didn't the bearded titan eat him here? was Armin that annoying?</br>  I actually think Ymir will be the one to take down Bert. <br>Bert'll use his Colossal blowing off steam power, and only the healing ability of Ymir's titan form will allow her to get close enough to climb up the Colossal and rip Bert from its neck.</br>  <br>Also Annie/Mikasa is an obvious one.</br>  <br>Because about 5 seconds later Eren turned into a titan and killed it. Armin's mind just went dead after seeing Eren get eaten and he didn't see Eren's titan form emerge and start killing things.</br>  <br> No connection between them <br>Both are autistic?</br></br>    <br>That makes way more sense than my theory that Armin made all the titans skip over him because he made him think he was a mindless titan just like them somehow</br>  <br>An explosion would kill Ymir. Just drop this fanwanky shit for once, Ymir isn't even strong enough for the CT to care.</br>  Is the 2nd movie out? I wanna see the new scenes  <br>This adds up to those spoilers with Kichiro Moto.</br>  <br>yeah, anime fucked it up for tension's sake</br>  Isayama forgot to draw Keith's beard.  <br/>  <br>Bert and Mikasa have a lot of things in common. I would argue personality and role wise, they're a lot more similar than Annie/Mikasa and Bert/Armin.</br>  <br>The Colossal's steam power isn't an explosion though. I'm talking about the thing he used to keep the soldiers away from him on the wall, not the explosion he used to take Eren out. <br>And it'd fit, because Ymir's titan body would be running hot as well, and have healing powers, and is specially suited for climbing up things.</br></br>  <br> while everyone looking tense Mikasa just stares calmly at Eren's butt </br>  <br>I think it will be either her or Armin. I think Armin is one of the most likely candidates to use the serum they got from Kenny.</br>  <br>BFF confirmed?</br>  <br>He can explode, just drop it. Only Reiner is able to survive this, it even wiped out Eren who is a 15 meter titan, not a 3 meter one.</br>  <br>That's impossible perspective wise.</br>  <br>So Eren is going to steal Reiner's armor technique?</br>  <br>Ymir's not a 3 meter titan, and I never said he couldn't explode. <br><br>Sounds like you're letting your Ymir hate get in the way of actually thinking things through. I blame the shippers who have turned hating Ymir into a meme in these threads.</br></br></br>  <br>They're both taciturns and tend to stare at things, but a fight between them wouldn't be interesting. Mikasa is good at slashing things and Bert can't be killed with just that. Unless he dies in human form, but that would be anticlimactic.</br>  <br>Ymir saved his life, if she wanted to kill him she would have done so long ago.</br>  <br>I don't hate Ymir though. It still doesn't mean she's strong enough to take down the colossal, just think about what you're saying. She was good at threatening him when he couldn't even transform in the forest, but on a real fight she can't beat that. Actually he wouldn't even have to use the exploding ability to defeat her in the first place.</br>  <br>http://kissmanga.com/Manga/Shingeki<wbr>-no-Kyojin/Chapter-071?id=235193</wbr></br>  <br>Can the CT even move around? Is he stable enough? The fact that Reiner had to go against MT instead of Bert kind of makes me suspect that the CT can't take another shifter one-on-one due to balancing issues. The CT's most dangerous attack is his steam but a shifter that can regenerate can withstand that, plus his steam attack would run out eventually as Hanji suggested, after it runs out a fast titan like Ymir could climb up his body and rip him out of the nape of his neck.</br>  <br>Wasn't it mentioned somewhere that CT can't even stand without support? He always looked more like a defensive type of titan to me and also rather slow. Everyone could just easily run away from him, if they wanted to.</br>  <br> Can the CT even move around? <br>Isayama drew him moving around so probably yes. He doesn't have to move around yo beat Ymir though.<br><br> The CT's most dangerous attack is his steam <br>No, that's the explosion. Are you seriously, unironically suggesting Ymir's titan is stronger than the colossal titan? See what this page  is saying again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he wouldn't even have to use the exploding ability to defeat her <br>Why not? Eren was a hair's breadth away from killing him in Trost, in his human form at that. I imagine Ymir in Titan form could deal with him just fine were it not for the explosion.</br></br>  <br> Wasn't it mentioned somewhere that CT can't even stand without support? <br>Nope, that was a theory. He appeared standing in a bunch of Isayama's drawings.<br><br> Everyone could just easily run away from him <br>Easily, even. He's slow as fuck, but if someone manages to go up to his nape he could always just do the explosion thing and bail out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He doesn't have to move around yo beat Ymir though. <br>If he can't move around he can only throw punches that could easily be dodged, especially by a smaller titan with quick movements. But if he can move around then it's a different story, however I think that he's slow due to his size and the shape of his body. <br><br><br> No, that's the explosion <br>It's a steam attack, the only way he can explode is if he falls and that would also mean that Bert has to leave his titan body. The explosion can also be dodged, it's only dangerous if the enemy can't see it coming, but with Bert's size who wouldn't?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't the steam attack just Bert leaving his titan? That's what he did both times it happened.</br>  <br> Eren was a hair's breadth away from killing him in Trost, in his human form at that <br>That was just shitty writing from Isayama's side. The steam gave Hanji enough burns to make her pass out and she wasn't even as close as Eren was. For some miraculous reason, Eren didn't even get a scratch.</br></br>  MT, reiner, bert when?  <br>No, he can stay in it if he wants to, but it has a time limit until all his meat burns off from it.</br>  <br>Because he's a shifter?</br>  <br>He didn't know he was a shifter back then, shouldn't the burning still happen until he decided to heal it? Like how he hit his head when Keith meddled with the belt.</br>  MT<br>Grisha<br>RT<br>AT<br>FT<br>DT<br>CT<br>Rod Titan</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the only way he can explode is if he falls and that would also mean that Bert has to leave his titan body <br>If that's the only case he can do it, then Ymir might have a chance. I think he exploded when he fell because he fell to save Reiner and thus exploded when he reached them, but I could be wrong.</br></br>  <br>You forgot Frieda.</br>    <br>We didn't see enough of her tbh.</br>    <br>Rod wasn't a shifter, he was a mindless colossal titan</br>  <br>BRA can control their healing consciously, but Eren (and Ymir) have only shown involuntary healing so far.</br>  <br> Jeanin20years.jpg </br>  <br>I think they can all control it, but Eren couldn't heal before he knew he was a shifter. His head trauma was proof of that. He should have got burned.</br>  <br>He didn't know he was a shifter when his arm and leg grew back. So far he used pretty much all of his powers without knowing how to use them prior, why should healing be different?</br>  <br>same way he beat him last time.  "we fucked your waifu bert. WE FUCKED YOUR WAIFU </br>  <br> He didn't know he was a shifter when his arm and leg grew back <br>He did though, he even transformed before he regenerated his limbs. I think he would have known if he saw steam coming out of his wounds, the cadets got hurt very often because of their training.</br></br>  <br>He also didn't know how to shift yet unconsciously he knew that he had to injure himself.</br>    Next BSM will have a SnK cover. Please be drawn by Isayama  <br>You think that Bert would even listen to Armin now? If Bert gets a hold of Armin, he's done for.</br>  <br>What if it is Chuugakkou to go with the  anime announcement ?</br>  <br>That is better than nothing.. Thanks!<br><br><br>Hey, this one actually worked! Thanks! .. Though I've already read it off the other thread now, I'll save that site for next month.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Eren has more of a reason to want to kill Bert than Bert has to kill Armin. If Bert tries anything funny, he'd die by Eren's hands.</br>  <br>Eren doesn't want to kill BR anymore. He said it himself.</br>  <br>nah, Armin has caught the bloodlust now. No one is safe.</br>  <br>What do you think he would do if they killed Armin? Stand still?</br>  <br>Definitely not, but it's not like Armin will die anyway.</br>  <br>It could be a live action cover. The movie is coming out next month.</br>  <br>What makes you think that? I think he will be the only one to die out of the main trio.</br>  <br>Just a hunch.</br>  <br> Erwin uses hair products and is very picky about it, only uses Gorilla Snot. <br> All recruits thought Eren ad Armin were fags for each other. <br> There is no technology to print the logos of the militia, so they have a group of chinks embroidering on clandestine basements.. </br></br></br>  <br>I'm more wondering if it was the first King that made him go apeshit in the forest, seeing that smile of Eren in the neck.</br>  There better be some doujins of Keith raping Eren soon.  <br>We don't even have MTBR doujins yet.</br>  <br>Keith raping Grisha in front of Carla. And   Carla raping Keith then  </br>  <br>If Armin dies then who will be Eren and Mikasa's servant boy?</br>  <br>Yeah, it could be a live action cover. That reminds me the first part of the live action movie is premiering this Tuesday in L.A.</br>  <br>Suffering.</br>  In the end, did we see Annie smile in the second recap movie?  <br>I'm surprised Bert drawfags haven't delivered on this yet. They draw for everything else.</br>  Is Armin canonically a pervert?  <br>There are some pics.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>he enjoyed crossdressing as Historia tho</br>  <br>In fanart, maybe.</br>  <br>I hope they catch up when they return in the manga, we don't know enough about MT yet.</br>  <br>I don't see why their would be. MT is most attractive Shingeki and Berp looks like he has down syndrome.</br>  <br>Eren and Historia got kidnapped by Rod Reiss, the true King. Meanwhile, the survey corps made a plan to wash their name and succeeded, turning the power around and making the current ruler fall from his throne. Rod Reiss reveal that the royal family are the heir of the first king, who put everyone between walls made from titans a long time ago. He wants Historia to get the power to control the titans. This power is currently held by Eren, who got it from his father by eating him. His father stole it from one of the members of the Royal family (the black haired chick). Historia becomes half-crazy and Eren get an inferiority conplex, but in the end, Historia refuses to eat Eren and Rod decide to transform into a titan himself. To protect everyone, Eren had to eat a chemical that gave him the armor power. Rod-Titan attacked the wall but got defeated by the survey corps, and finished by Historia, who as the one true heir became Queen. Two months then pass and Eren became good enough to create structure from his armor, leading to the invention of a "guillotine" who kills titans with no man power. He then learned from Keith (the instructor) that his father was from outside the wall, just like the other titans. He now aims to fill up the hole in wall Maria and get to his father's basement.</br>  <br>Don't start. All shingeki's are beautiful in their own way.</br>  <br>Also they figured out the Titans are people who have been transformed, and can be changed back under certain conditions<br>so if you didn't figure that out in the first few chapters then I guess that might be a surprise</br></br>  <br>Wasn't this before the kidnapping ?<br>I mean just after they went through Connie's hometown</br></br>  Was that guy who emerged from Gorilla Warfare supposed to be someone we already know? He was shown like it was some big reveal.  <br>He's a big guy.</br>  <br>He looks very similar to Grisha.<br>His titan form has pointy ears, just like titan forms of Eren and Grisha.<br>Now when we know that Grisha is outsider as well it makes sense.</br></br></br>  <br> Since when were you under the impression that I was dead? <br>Isayama's writing is not THAT bad.</br></br>  <br>Nothing says that he's Grisha, but his relative? That's entirely possible.<br>Grisha's titan form looked differently as well.</br></br>  <br><br> disgusting EM <br>Someone remind me why Spoof is considered to be any good.</br></br></br>  <br> Erwin uses hair products <br>Of course.</br></br>  <br>Some of the other portrayals of the characters are pretty good, but the EMshit is annoying. Mikasa doesn't even act like that toward Eren. I know it's supposed to be a parody of the characters, but if you're going to change a characters personality at least do it for comedic reasons, not for shipperfag delusions.</br>  <br> Mikasa doesn't even act like that toward Eren <br><br>If only she did, at least she wouldn't that much of a pathetic beta.</br></br></br>  <br>That would make her much more annoying though. I rather her get actual character development than cling to Eren any more than she does now.</br>  <br>Maybe she'll get some development from her Asian heritage since she didn't get all that much from the Ackerman subplot.</br>  <br>My bet is that after the Ackerman plot, the Asian bloodline will be explained in 5 pages as "superior Asian blood makes for great warrior spirit"</br>  <br>That's what I'm hoping too. Levi had a closer connection to the Ackerman plot since Kenny was his uncle, but Mikasa's sure to get the spotlight once the Asian clan is brought back into the story.</br>  <br>I don't think we're fully done with the Ackerman subplot. Once the circumstances of Levi's Ackerwakening are revealed it might finally connect to Mikasa.</br>  <br>It's the only thing that panders to BRfags.</br>  <br>How would it connect to Mikasa?</br>  <br>Along with the game, smartpass and Chuugakkou?</br>  <br>We'll probably be seeing the mark that Mikasa's mother gave her popping up again to identify someone we didn't expect as Asian and with all the super powers that Asians undoubtedly have.<br><br>Meanwhile, the basement is filled with test tubes of Eren clones because he's an experiment his father created to safely take advantage of the memories of the First King. Grisha himself couldn't, after all.</br></br></br>  <br>You might be right, anon. I honestly forgot about the awakening aspect of the Ackerman powers in wake of all the Reiss, first king, and Grisha info. It's too bad Isayama didn't show Kenny's awakening moment in his backstory, but Levi's awakening moment might be shown later on if and when he talks to Mikasa about Ackerbusiness. Or was Levi's awakening moment when he beat that thug in the fight and Kenny left? I've seen speculation that Levi's awakening moment was when he went on a killing spree against the titans in ACWNR after Farlan and Isabel's death, but his awakening moment likely wouldn't be in a spinoff and he was already strong enough to be the top dog in the underground and catch Erwin's attention before that.</br>  <br>4koma too.<br><br> It was kind of cute how Armin pointing out Reiner’s relationship with Bertholdt made him flustered. Because of the increased BL levels, are Armin and Jean being aimed for too? Seems dangerous… </br></br></br>  <br>Don't those cater more to BA than BR?</br>  <br>The side material tends to cater to both.</br>  <br> I've seen speculation that Levi's awakening moment was when he went on a killing spree against the titans in ACWNR after Farlan and Isabel's death, <br>Is kinda tricky here. Manga and OVA showed him in control of his mind, while only the VN described the moment like a mass murder and he didn't have recollection of how he did it.</br></br>  <br>It mostly caters to BA, but occasionally also a little BR</br>  <br>It's both, but the homo implications are usually from Reiner's side.</br>  <br>mangacap</br>  <br>I go with the VN version when it comes to ACWNR since that is the original (and arguably the best version) of it. Can ACWNR even be considered canon anymore since in this chapter Keith shut Erwin down on the long range formation, but on the expedition in ACWNR they use Erwin's long range formation and he's still a squad leader then?</br>  <br>Not really. BRfags just take it out of context. Most things seriously pander to BA and sometimes joke about Reiner.</br>  <br>Something along the lines of:<br>1. Someone with more info appears/there's something about the Ackermans in the basement.<br>2. Mikasa has a flashback revealing what Levi told her about his powers during their conversation in chapter 63 after the chapter cuts to Eren and Historia. <br>3.This connects to #1, which then leads to <br>4. another reveal or plot twist.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope is not a mistranslation but Isayama subtly debunking the spin-off so nobody feel hurt.</br>   <br> Or was Levi's awakening moment when he beat that thug in the fight and Kenny left? <br>This is probably what did it. How else could a small boy kill an adult thug? <br><br>I think we're done with the Ackerman thing the moment Kenny died. The LM connection revealed without much fanfare, so I think the focus will continue on Mikasa's Asian side.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what I meant, but it's still pandering. Spoof has pretty much everything pandering to BR, in Chuugakkou the whole school told Reiner to cut the shit and admit he's gay, chibi specials have YH and Armin thinking they're gay. Smartpass not so much, but the shippy stuff in smartpass is more realistic since they're not parodies. The game just shows them as good bros and goes crazy with the powerups and line picks, but nothing really shippy.</br>  <br>What other info could we get though? We already know the history of the Ackerman line.</br>  <br>So, anons nailed when they said the Ackerman thing would be dealt with indifference<br> I'm Ackerman <br> Me too <br> Need to scrub the bathroom <br> Need to see Eren </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the increased BL levels </br>  <br>We don't know much about their powers.</br>  <br>Pretty much. Even I expected more.</br>  <br> Armin and Jean <br> not EAr <br>This is completely OOC.</br></br></br>   july 11 <br> chapter still not out </br>    So I've been thinking. What if Grisha, MT, and Ymir are all siblings? Possibly children of the first king. I say this because all of their titan forms have extremely long arms and pointy ears. Just like the first king. It's kind of hard to tell if Grisha's titan form has long arms because of angles, but they look somewhat elongated. We also know that Grisha is totally from outside the walls. Maybe, Grisha and Ymir (who knows about MT) were turned into mindless titans and were forced to wander outside the walls for years and years. Then, Grisha ate someone and changed back and was found. This would explain how he has no idea what 3DMG or the SL are. Then, some time later, Ymir found BRM and ate Marcel. At this point, she regained her mind and slipped into the walls. Possibly when Bert and Reiner destroyed them.  Carla a cute femEren  <br>It's saying that Reiner could go after Armin and Jean, not that JA is possible.</br>  <br>It means that Reiner would assault them. In the ass. Like he does to Bert.</br>  <br>What the fuck does manlet have to do with Marco?</br>  <br>That would be shit writing in my opinion. Half the cast is already related somehow to each other by coincidence, we don't need more of that. It's really possible though.</br>  <br><br>This is even worse because he only has the hots for Kurista. Anyways nobody except /a/'s Jean wants to buttfuck the Janbo.</br></br>  <br> How else could a small boy kill a adult thug? <br>Gee, we've never seen something like this in the series, have we? I don't think he killed him though. <br>Plus the awakening could have happened before the fight.</br></br></br>  <br>Apparently the anime team disagrees.</br>  <br>JUST</br>  <br>Everyone knows the anime team is shit. Even Isayama despises them.</br>  <br>Homo jokes about Reiner are nothing new. Even Isayama does it.</br>  <br>He only hates them because he knows they are making a superior product out of his material.</br>  <br>Isayama is the one that gives them the filler ideas, the only ones that hate the anime are Arminfags because some EAr scenes were removed and replaced with EM.</br>  <br>The blue box is Scouting Legion. Marco's death made Jean join SL.</br>  <br>Oh, thanks for clarifying.</br>  <br>Kimd of how Isayama monitored the ending of the animu? <br>The EM scenes are exactly why Isayama hates them and it's why he spends time excessively pandering to EArfags.</br></br>  <br>He didn't fully agree with the ending, Araki convinced him that it'll be "cooler" but it was a total fuckup</br>  <br>I'm starting to consider it more and more likely. Both Grisha and Ymir also have eyes unlike any of the other titans. You can't really tell on MT because of all dat fur, but they look like they might be similar to theirs.</br>  <br>I don't think they're related by birth, but they're probably all from the same time period. I think that Ymir was a princess/queen that was forced into her position. MT came along and turned her civilization into titans, which is where she knows him from. Grisha was a research scientist working for whomever MT is working for. MT is an Ackerman, and his giant monkey form is an example of what happens when an Ackerman becomes a titan.</br>  <br>Not eve Araki handled that, Araki said in an interview that the ending scene was outsourced.</br>  <br>The anime team even was embarrassed about the last two episodes.</br>  <br>Or maybe she'll finally learn how to make children.</br>  Wait, where did all this talk about the First King come from?  <br>Does he? I thought the anime team came up with the body dumping filler, which is why they had to change them in the final version.</br>  <br>What extra EM did the anime have other than the ending scene?</br>  <br> beta, blond Ackerman <br>herr Ackerman is best Ackerman</br></br>  <br>The fact that Ymir was a princess/queen is what leads me to believe at least she might be a child of the first king. Maybe MT turned both her and Grisha into mindless titans and then fucked off to start BRA village.</br>  <br>I actually think Ymir is MT's daughter and he did titan experiments on her.</br>  <br>The body dumping scene was the anime team's suggestion and Isayama corrected some inaccuracies. The Annie scene was Isayama's idea, and he said he wanted to add more filler in season 2, which means he at least supervises it.</br>  <br>They replaced Armin with Mikasa in this scene.</br>  <br> Isayama! They want to ruin the manga with anime filler! And you can't reject the filler! <br> I need to make it less embarrassing! <br>"Isayama approves it!"</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I also think this.</br>  <br> The fact that Ymir was a princess/queen is what leads me to believe at least she might be a child of the first king <br>It's possible. Since she's brown and the rest of the Reiss family isn't, she would have to been born to a mistress or something. But then I doubt she would have held a position of significant, like what happened to Historia, which makes me doubt the idea.<br><br>I think the pointy ears has more to do with a generation of titans (i.e. "early models") rather than the bloodline. Grisha may have extracted his own spinal fluid to make the serum for Eren, which kept the older form.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  Since she's brown <br><br>She has black hair and grey ayes. She could be.</br></br></br>  <br>How do we know that the original Reiss line wasn't darker? Maybe after a few generations they took on the look they have now. A lot can change after just a generation or two. Plus, you can't cousin fuck a royal bloodline forever.<br><br>It could be a generation of titans thing though. I never really thought about that one. But, why were there no pointy eared titans entering Shiganshina when the wall was broken if they'd been meandering outside the walls for 100+ years?</br></br></br>  <br>Cry more, I prefer to believe what the author says instead of an obviously butthurt anonymous person online.</br>  <br>Erwin's Papa.</br>  <br> How do we know that the original Reiss line wasn't darker? <br>Well, we've got people saying that Grisha and MT might be her brothers, or that MT is her father, and we know that neither Grisha nor MT are brown people, so it doesn't really hold up.</br></br>  <br> inb4 Erwin turns against Levi because Levi kills papa MT </br>  <br>Ymir isn't brown. She is a bit tan also has black hair and grey eyes. Looks like Rod.</br>  <br> Looks like Rod. <br>You mean Grisha.</br></br>  <br> Ymir isn't brown. <br>She is brown in literally every instance she is drawn colored. She has dark brown hair, caramel eyes, and brown skin. She's not black, but she's not white like Grisha or Rod who are in no way brown at all.</br></br>  <br>At least Grisha and MT can look alike. But Ymir being the imouto?<br>Maybe Ymir was from a group of people who held with pride the titan knowledge, and that enraged MT, so he turned them. And that could be the reason the Reiss forbid any recollection about titans.</br></br>  <br>I think it depends. If Poppy Reiss was white and Mamma Reiss was black (possibly a queen from another wall kingdom) some children could be white and others could be brown.</br>  <br> She is brown in literally every instance she is drawn colored. <br>Not really. She is just a little tanned in the anime.</br></br>  <br>I'm talking about manga version.<br><br>Anime version made Ymir look brown.</br></br></br>  Why the fuck are these threads allowed? It's already the 11th and the retards got their chapter alreayd. God fuck get back to  you sperg mongoloids  <br>Doesn't she have freckles?<br>Not even bullshitting here.<br>But, remember the whole deal with Titans and the sun?<br>People with freckles generally have lower photo protective melanin becoming more susceptible to to UV radiation.Basically, they get tanned far more easily to the point that it's often said that people with freckles shouldn't expose themselves to sunlight too much.</br></br></br></br>   grisha probably ate someone from the shifter village <br> ymir also ate someone from the shifter village <br> bert and reiner are like 10 at this point go and kick in the wall because someone wanted the coordinate <br> Grisha beats them to it and hides the coordinate in his son </br></br></br>  <br>Manga Ymir is white as fuck. Isayama draws her white with black hair and gray eyes, in the colored covers.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br> Maybe Ymir was from a group of people who held with pride the titan knowledge, and that enraged MT, so he turned them. And that could be the reason the Reiss forbid any recollection about titans. <br>This is pretty close to what I've been thinking. She can read the runes from Utgard Keep and looks noticeably different than other characters. It just doesn't make sense to me that she'd be related to the First King. It's possible, but unlikely.<br><br>I still think that Ymir and her people had been living in the area, when the First King and MT showed up to create the walls. At which point they turned her and her people into titans to get them out of the area. Utgard is the remains of part of her civilization.<br><br>Later on, Grisha ran off from where BRA and MT live. He was the coordinate, not Reiss. They discovered the existence of the SL, which made the people within the walls a threat to MT. He would be fine with them, but not with Grisha potentially giving them privileged information about titans or the ability to counteract. So they planned on destroying the walls to smoke him out. That's why BR mentioned that they wouldn't need to destroy anymore if Eren went with them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ymir is Grisha's mum  <br> He was the coordinate, not Reiss. <br>That would be an interesting point. We don't know if the mind wiping ability is equal to control titans. Maybe those are two different abilities from two different Coordinates.</br></br>  <br> That's why BR mentioned that they wouldn't need to destroy anymore if Eren went with them. <br>Well without the coordinate people inside the walls will die anyway.</br></br>  <br>Impossible. Ymir was turned around 70 years ago while the titans have already been around for a 100 years. I think Ymir was a previous monarch from a separate faction and she was overthrown by MT 70 years ago and her people killed or turned into titans.</br>  <br>I don't really believe that one at all. She would have had to have him at like 13 and then immediately turned into a titan for 60 years for this to even be plausible.<br><br> Then again, in the middle ages, people loved fucking their 13 year olds. </br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, Mikasa would have probably been first in line to hug Eren's unconscious body if she hadn't been at the wall at the moment.<br><br>Whatever shipfaggotry will never be as bad as crippled manlet saving the day.</br></br></br>  <br> Ymir was turned around 70 years ago while the titans have already been around for a 100 years. <br>We don't actually know that the walls have been around for 100 years. That's just the recorded history within the walls, which we know is a bunch of bullshit. Titans could have been around for 30 years before the walls were built as well.</br></br>  <br> Later on, Grisha ran off from where BRA and MT live. He was the coordinate, not Reiss. <br>Great, we going "Amnesia"?<br>Grisha stole something or has the knowledge over something very important for MT and BAR.Turned himself amnesiac so he himself wouldn't know.<br><br>The Reiss aren't the coordinate but have the memory power.<br>So Grisha steals that power and hands it to Eren along with his memories and the coordinate to complete the set.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> she was overthrown by MT 70 years ago <br>That doesn't really add up with she said during Utgard. MT was probably not even that invovled with her village.</br></br>  <br>I still think the coordinate ability was originally Ymir's. Remember the drawing in the book.</br>  <br>Her village probably had a different special ability. My guess is turning humans into titans.</br>  <br>I think original coordinate is from Ymir and at some point, someone made a copy of it and handled to Reiss family.</br>  <br>It actually does. She said that she was killed for the greater good.</br>  <br> Remember the drawing in the book. <br>...What drawing in what book?</br></br>  <br>That still doesn't add up with what you said. It also sounded more like she killed herself. Probably to escape from her faith.</br>  <br>The one were frieda told Ymir's story.</br>  <br> Great, we going "Amnesia"? <br>Nah, I don't think it's amnesia. Grisha "didn't remember" things before he even entered the walls and had a chance to steal the Reiss power. And he quite clearly knows whatever it is, since it's in the basement.<br><br>Though I do agree that he groomed Eren specifically to take advantage of both his coordinate power and the Reiss power.</br></br></br></br>  <br>my own theory. Ymir's bloodline are the original coordinate holders. Her fanily branched out and the first king, who held one of the coordibates, created the walls with it. Thr family branch that stayed behind held another coordinate. Grisha is part of this family branch and that explains Eren being so powerful.</br>  <br>The book Frieda was showing to Historia.</br>  <br>Basically:<br>Grisha holds some knowledge or information.<br>BAR and MT want it.That is the coordinate.<br>But he turned amnesiac and doesn't know precisely what it is himself.<br><br>5 years ago, Grisha wanted the memory power, but it doesn't work on himself to find out what he knew.<br>After killing the Reiss, he took their memory power and "handed" it to Eren.<br>By doing so, Eren gains the memories and knowledge of Grisha.<br>The important part, he has yet to unlock.<br><br>Something like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds too far fetched to be honest.</br>  <br> But he turned amnesiac <br>He was just pretending.</br></br>  <br>This. I don't know why people really believe what Grisha said.</br>  <br>Wait, there's people who believe he was actually amnesiac?</br>  <br>Alright but consider this<br><br>Grisha wandered aroubd mindlessly for decades &gt; finds a shifter and eats it &gt; turns back to human &gt; finds shiganshina &gt; gets found by Keith &gt; he has little recollection of where he's from because he was too many years inside a titan</br></br></br>  <br>Titan shifters remembers all. Ymir wandered a lot and she remembered about her past and dreams' when she was a titan.</br>  <br><br>This book? If so, I don't get it. Are you saying that's a picture of Ymir?</br></br>  <br>What I'm saying is that he regaimed his memories as time passed. Ymir coupd have been tje same. No memories of the past, bit by bit they came back, etc.</br>  <br>Impossible. At most it's one of her ancestors.</br>  <br> No memories of the past, bit by bit they came back, etc. <br>Ymir remembers everything from her past, except from the time when she was mindless.</br></br>  So the plot is basically a ripoff of Yamato, right?<br><br> Humanity has been driven to the brink of extinction by the Titans (Gamilas) <br> Grisha (Sasha) sacrifices himself to provide humanity with a weapon equal in power to the enemy's <br> He promises that humanity can be saved if they fight through hostile territory and reach the basement (Iscandar) <br> So the remaining humans embark on a perilous journey to the basement, led by Eren (the Yamato), a human vessel empowered with Titan (alien) technology </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ymir is a million years old, could be her.</br>  <br>He knows too much about titans for this to be the case. Even important people in Ymir's time (like Ymir herself) didn't know much about titans. She still admits that she doesn't know a lot about how her powers work. Grisha on the other hand knows a lot more than he lets on, which he wouldn't be able to figure out if he was just your average guy running around as a titan. Not to mention there aren't exactly shifters running around all over the place. <br><br>Because Grisha is a shifter I think he was someone important in MT's civilization. He's a doctor, so I think he may have studied titans. He then may have stole what he was working on (Titan control powers) and ran off with it.</br></br></br>  <br>It's probably an ancestor of the First King, telling the story of the titans' origin. Maybe it's related to his hatred of the human race?</br>  <br>Probably not.</br>  <br> She still admits that she doesn't know a lot about how her powers work. <br><br>Ymir is lying because she his highly skilled with her titan form. She knows more than she talks. <br><br>She is a smart person and won't spill out everything she knows.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So... can hardened skin Eren break Annie's hardening now so we can see some torture and get some information about something for a change?</br></br>  <br>I dunno. I don't attach too much to it, but it seems to depict a titan and someone giving an offering to it. The only people dumb enough to try to give an apple to a titan would be people that had never seen one before.</br>  <br>More like the opposite, especially if it's not mindless.</br>  <br> evafag? </br>  <br>Consider this</br>  <br>Yeah, I also think Ymir doesn't says her last name because she would be related to Reiss family on any way.</br>  <br>Or she doesn't have one. Just like Grisha.</br>  <br>Exactly. If Ymir is a direct descendant of the first king's brother or sister then she would be a Reiss too. <br><br><br>Yeager, though I think it's made up, he's also a Reiss.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How can she be a Reiss if she has the hots for another Reiss?<br><br>I don't think Isayama intends to have Ymir be related to anyone.</br></br></br>  <br>Consider this, not everyone has to be related.</br>  <br> Everyone's a Reiss, the rest are Ackerman: The Manga </br>  <br>She probably doesn't mind it since they're distantly related. It's like cousins marrying among one another.</br>  <br>But Grisha does have a last name. Or at least he introduced himself to Keith with a full name.</br>  <br>Keith gave him his last name.</br>  <br><br><br>They're wouldn't be that related at all only by last name. You see, there are people who share same last name but isn't directly related.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't think Isayama intends to have Ymir be related to anyone. <br>If Ymir is royalty then you gonna bet she'll turn out to be related to another important character.</br></br>  <br>Shingeki no soap opera.</br>  <br>Yeah if this  isn't the thing then would be this other one </br>  <br> They're wouldn't be that related at all only by last name. You see, there are people who share same last name but isn't directly related. <br>See<br>They're closer related than even Eren and Historia. She would be like, Historia's grandaunt while Eren and Historia just distant cousins.</br></br></br>  <br>This.<br>Not everyone has to be a Reiss or an Ackerman.<br><br>Ymir being a Reiss theory is reaching too much as it is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How is it reaching? We have Ymir appearing in a book read to Historia by her sister, she was probably explaining to her how the Reiss family did their business or something. Ymir being a Reiss is very possible, see</br>  <br>Looks like everyone has to be related now, after it happened one time.</br>  <br>Or that her family were important rulers too and had their own big name. Doesn't have to be related to someone we already know.</br>  <br>Only if you think First king and Ymir's family heirs are brothers. They could be cousins or anything else and still being related. Now, respect Ymir and Historia they would not be.</br>  <br> We have Ymir appearing in a book read to Historia by her sister <br>How the hell is that a picture of Ymir in that book? Now you're definitely stretching.</br></br>  <br>No, it's not. That book could simply show two different important bloodlines.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Think about it, the reason Ymir never revealed her last name is because everyone would recognize her. The reason she was so interested in little Historia, she harbored family feelings towards her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This theory is stupid. We literally know nothing, not even from which family Grisha even is. So yeah, reaching a lot.<br><br><br>You just want everyone to be related.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We definitely can tell that MT and Grisha are related.</br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>No, we can't.</br>  <br>Just for the glasses? I think that is retarded thinking.</br>  <br>They look exactly the same. MT just looks a bit older. <br> same haircut <br> same glasses <br> same facial hair </br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Ymir has a last name or a name related. <br> family feelings towards her while confirmed being in love with her. <br><br>Yiu're an kdiot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, their faction/family could have a thing going on where all their glasses looked the same. <br><br><br>What.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're an idiot* <br><br><br>Fuck phone.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, something like that runs in the genes</br>  <br>Ymir and Levi share a lot in common but we don't say they are related.</br>  <br>How many times have we had to hear that Ymir is also an Ackerman?</br>  <br>This was discussed before, but only because nips started it.</br>  <br>You're definitely blind if you can't see that they look like siblings or even father and son. <br><br><br>Levi and Mikasa look like carbon copies of one another, I wouldn't say that about Ymir. Ymir may not look like her brothers Grisha and MT but that could be because she got her mother's looks or something.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also, Oreo and MT are clearly related to Manlet.</br>  <br>That was just a joke some anons take it seriously. She is not an Ackerman. She is from another bloodline.</br>  <br>Makes sense. Ackerman is Reiss, Reiss is Ackerman. Ymir is a man.</br>  <br>MT is also Levi's dad.</br>  <br>Eh?</br>  Ymir could be a Braus. <br><br><br>Seriously, the whole Ymir being related to someone is a reaching. She's from outside the walls. She could very well be someone important to her own place and not from inside the walls.</br></br></br>  <br>I think Rico is an Ackerman</br>  <br>MT is Erwin and Levi's dad.</br>  <br>Okay, consider this.  The Ackermans are the family that branched out, Ymir Ackerman could happen.</br>  <br> She's from outside the walls <br>She's from Utgard or at least somewhere thereabouts, since she knows that language.</br></br>  <br>Sasha is another titan shifter. And probably the one who would be eaten when the serum get used.</br>  <br>Ymir Hoover. They are both dark and tall and they could pass for Egyptians.</br>  <br>No.<br><br>Utgard language is from outside the walls and lost humanity civilization. The walls were created on the remaining.</br></br></br>  <br>It's also possible that Eren went back in time and is his own grandpa.</br>    <br>Grisha is the father of his father?</br>  <br>Utgarde is the place where Loki lives. We know Loki = MT so the one living at Utgarde was MT in his human form. There, figured out one of the bigger mysteries.</br>  <br>Stop saying that shit. You are supposing too much with Ymir's family being descendant of First king brothers when it's almost obvious Ymir is from another one.</br>  <br> She's from Utgard <br>That would imply that she's from a castle on the outskirts of Wall Rose. Why? Also, I'm sure that herring can only be found at the sea, the walls have no sea.</br></br>  <br><br>Grisha could have known what happens to people who get the first Kings memories and tried to prevent this by blocking them somehow. Whatever he did just doesn't work that specific and blocks a lot of other memories, too.</br></br>    <br>MT was staying in Utgard the whole time, and living there with canned food and drinks from outside the walls, that's why we could see MT leaving from Utgard when the others came to stay there.. <br><br>The rest couldn't understand what kind of food or drink was but Ymir could.<br><br>She's from outside the walls.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The rest couldn't understand what kind of food or drink was but Ymir could <br>Reiner could, which makes sense since he's from MT's place.</br></br>  I jst read the latests chapter and either shadis is lying or the chapter made no fucking sense. Why didn't everyone bring up the fact that grisha was found outside the walls when his own fucking son turned up to be a titan shifter? I get that not that many people knew it, but you'd think someone might have got suspicious. And when did Grisha kill the reiss family? did he leave eren alone in the forest or something? jesus christ what a trainwreck of a chapter    <br> The First King caused this right? <br>The patriarchy?<br><br>Also why start the SNK general with discussing a five year old chapter. Whynot talk about Chapter 71, so many things to discuss happened there??</br></br></br></br>  <br>Now imagine if that piece of bard would be  your penis  instead.  How hot  is that?</br>  <br> Reiner could <br>He says he can't, so unless he's lying I doubt they're from the same place.</br></br>  Let's talk about Ymir instead of Ymir. What do you think Ymir is going to do after the developments of the Ymir in chapter 71?  <br>He was just pretending.</br>  <br>He could? I always had the impression he couldn't, but it makes sense now that you say it.</br>  <br>Of course, the moment he found out Ymiur could read the same language he started suspecting her since there's no way someone who isn't from outside the walls can read the language.</br>  <br>He was lying because if he admitted that would be suspicious. <br><br> tfw no one here has compression reading. </br></br></br>  <br> compression reading. <br> compression </br></br>  <br> why didn't anyone bring up the fact <br>The only ones who knew were Hannes and Keith.<br> when did Grisha kill the reiss family? <br>After he left Shiganshina, before he arrived at Trost.<br> did he leave Eren alone in the forest or something? <br>He led Eren to the forest to turn him into a Titan. He didn't leave him, he was eaten.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> compression reading <br>Is that when you put books and sit on them?</br></br>  <br> I'm from Japan, you faggot. Still you comprehend what I was trying to say.  </br>  Wait, if Ymir and MT and Reiner can read and speak the same language wouldn't that imply that they're all from the same place? Is Ymir from warrior village too?  <br> お前はホモだ </br>  <br> Is Ymir from warrior village too? <br>No, Ymir has referred to her becoming a shifter as stealing something from "them", so she doesn't consider herself one of them.</br></br>  <br>No. It's even hinted people inside the walls spoke that language once. The nobles probably tried to get rid of it, so people won't discover any secrets.</br>  <br> The only ones who knew were Hannes and Keith. <br>and why didn't shadis and hannes say anything? it's kind of a big fucking deal. I'm not sure how many people know about shifters coming from outside, but at least shadis should have been suspicious and said something<br> when did Grisha kill the reiss family? <br>For what reason? he didn't know that his wife was dead yet</br></br></br></br>  <br> wwwwwwあなたもね </br>  <br> It's even hinted people inside the walls spoke that language once <br>Where.</br></br>  <br>Ymir is MT's creator. She is the most important figure of them all actually.</br>  They do look alike.  <br>See .</br>  <br>What I've been saying for years and nobody believe me</br>  <br>The wine bottle next to King Fritz for example.</br>  <br>I always believed you.</br>  <br>Post it.</br>  <br>Shadis doesn't know that there are people living outside the walls so he doesn't know it's relevant. As far as he knows it's just titans out there.<br><br> For what reason? <br>He obviously knew about the Reiss power and wanted it. Or alternatively, to put a stop to it. I suspect that the people outside the walls know the origins of the walls, which includes the Reiss abilities. This is probably related to Bert calling them "Children of the devil", and I think that they (BRA) consider the First King evil. Meanwhile, MT is carrying out the First King's objectives. So when Grisha found out that the Reiss line was still alive, he went after them.</br></br></br></br>  For amerifaggots:<br>https://twitter.com/debaoki/status/<wbr>619940365202620416<br>https://twitter.com/debaoki/status/<wbr>619942050574680064<br>https://twitter.com/debaoki/status/<wbr>619943497840197633</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>Alright.</br>  <br>No, MT created Ymir and then Grisha, see and </br>  <br>Follow'd you man, you have a really informative Twitter man.</br>  <br>No, Levi created everyone. Isayama said his age will be important.</br>  <br> Isayama said his age will be important. <br>Source.</br></br>  <br>what about his corpse? In the flashback it was next to eren</br>  MT is related to Zackly  <br>That entire exchange made no sense to me.</br>  <br>There's more than the ears for MT and Ymir<br> sharp teeth <br> long arms <br> big, dark pouches </br></br></br></br>  <br> what about his corpse? <br>What about whose corpse? Grisha's? He was eaten by Eren. It says that in big bold letters in the manga.</br></br>  <br>That guy already scares me, If he goes titan I would shit my pants.</br>  <br>I would love to see the artwork he creates out of other titans. The man is truly a visionary.</br>  <br>Mate you don't get it. Titan evolution is like human evolution. Ape-like to more human-like. You have Monkey Trouble who's fully ape, then you have Ymir looks like a homo floresiensis or something, then you have Eren and Grisha looking like neanderthals, then you have the Reiss titans look like humans.</br>  <br>his lower half was still intact</br>  <br>Doesn't matter. Eeren ate the nape of his neck.</br>  <br>The reason for why Grisha killed the Reiss is supposed to stay a mystery for now. <br>The only other people from outside the wall were humanity's enemies, revealing Eren's heritage would only put him in an even worse situation, marking him as Annie's accomplice.</br></br>  <br>doesn't mean that grisha's corpse disappeared, the only thing that evaporates is the titan flesh</br>  <br><br>Eren probably moved about, away from the corpse the collapsed.</br></br>  <br>that'd be a lame asspul of an exuce when we saw nothing like that in the flashback</br>  <br>We don't know if he stopped eating at that point.<br>But he had to puke his parts back out again somewhere.</br></br>  <br>It's the most logical explanation as to why Keith didn't see Grisha's corpse. Though wonder why Keith never wondered where Grisha was</br>  <br>that's why I think there wer esome things that didn't make sense in that chapter. I'm hoping that keith is hiding something, as we got a weird focus in his eyes when he said he didn't know anything else.</br>  <br> Your dad took you into the woods one night <br> I only ever found you <br> I decided to tell nobody about this </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, shitty writing or Keith did see Grisha's corpse</br>  <br>I think, maybe, Grisha went to the Reisses for help and they refused. He knew Frieda had the coordinate so he fought her, stole the coordinate and then killed the rest so there won't be witnesses, didn't had time for Rod and ran to Eren to give him the coordinate, for what reason i have no idea.<br><br>He could very well fight them too, not sure why he didn't.</br></br></br>  When will Isayama finally give us a glimpse of Marie?  <br>Who is he going to tell? And why? Carla was dead and Grisha is out of the picture. People were more concerned about the titans attacking the walls. Even if he did tell someone they wouldn't really give a shit. "Oh you found an abandoned kid? Add him to the list, there's lots of them."<br><br><br>There's no indication that titans puke shifters back up after they eat them. More likely they absorb them and then immediately turn human again. The only corpse that should be around would be Eren's titan's corpse.</br></br></br></br>  <br> stole the coordinate and then killed the rest so there won't be witnesses <br>He killed them all because he knows that eventually one of the Reisses would come looking for the coordinate. I remember Rod saying that the power only worked for the Reiss.</br></br>  <br>He could have told Hannes.<br><br> Oh, remember that dude we saved? <br> He left into the woods with his son one night and I only ever found his son </br></br></br></br>  <br> For what reason? he didn't know that his wife was dead yet <br>He also told Eren that he'll show him the basement before he left. Maybe he really just wanted to steal the Reiss memories or power.</br></br>  <br>He could even have told Eren, the fucker<br> hey remember the day your dad took you into the woods? <br> yeah I only found your unconscious body and your father nowhere to be found </br></br></br>  <br>And what would that do? Keith didn't want to cause trouble for Eren because Eren is Carla's son and Keith loved Carla. Keith sure as hell didn't suspect that Eren ate his dad because nobody knew anything about shifters at that point. So in Keith's mind, Grisha just took his son into the forest and abandoned him. And that's not something you want to tell a small child, so he didn't tell Eren anything.</br>  <br> Marie <br>Who?</br></br>  <br>Why not even just ask Eren "What the fuck happened to your dad 10 minutes ago?"</br>  So what did you animeonlyfags think about the reveal of the first episode of Gakkou Gurashi?  I want to fuck the one on the right.  I think it might have been more enjoyable if you guys didn't spoil it.  <br>That they're just really chuuni?</br>  <br> I wish </br>  <br>Kurumi is for hugging.</br>  <br> the reveal </br>  Is there more fanart of the right one? I need it!  <br><br>Best girl order</br></br>  <br>Eighteen year olds.</br>  <br> waroting </br>  <br>1. Look up her name in Cambodian liturgical script.<br>2. Go on Pixiv, enter her name in the search box, and have at it.</br></br>  <br>Thats too much work anon. Please do it for me.</br>  <br>This. Worst part is sourcefags spoiled it in threads unrelated to the show and in the most obnoxious ways possible.</br>    <br><br>Your own fault for having even an ounce of expectation about anon and coming onto /a/.<br>You should have stayed off of /a/ completely.</br></br></br>  <br>there's nothing wrong with being inconsiderate to animeonlyfags</br>  <br>(different anon)<br>Your point is 100% valid, however spoilage is an inevitable fact on /a/. It shouldn't happen, but it does anyway. This is why I at least avoid a topic's threads if I at all care about getting spoiled.<br><br/></br></br></br>    <br>Impeccable  display of shit taste </br>  It looks hella generic. I won't watch it.  <br>I bet you think the crazy bitch is the best girl. Go away bear lover.</br>  <br>3/2/4/1</br>    <br> It looks hella generic. <br>Thats the point. Without spoiling why its supposed to look generic.<br> I won't watch it. <br>Its only 20 minutes friend, give it a go.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I read as far as the  shopping mall  a few months ago.<br>I don't think they hid the reveal much, I mean didn't they mention it in descriptions?</br></br>  <br>the correct order is 4 &gt; 1 &gt; 3 &gt; 2</br>  <br>This is acceptable<br><br>This is not</br></br></br>  <br>Fixed that for you mate</br>  <br>Shovel and Garter are interchangeable for first and second place, but cathat is always 3rd, and titty onee-san is always last.</br>  <br>I meant those as rankings from left to right.</br>  I was looking forward to the reaction of animefags. But then idiots started spamming "le pretending to not know meme" and turned the threads into shitposting central.  So was the part before the TWIST! just to catch the audience off-guard or is the whole "what's-her-face escaping from reality" thing just a gimmick and will the rest be like most of the first episode under the guise of playing along with her delusions?  <br><br>I don't know what to think of it to be honest. Like, I can't tell where they're going with it. I'll be honest I was spoiled by some of you. Is Pink insane and we're supposed to be viewing this from her perspective, or can they all really not tell the difference between themselves and the undead?</br></br>  Yo hold on I just joined these threads and thought this was a cutesy slice of life generic thing from the pictures.  Then I noticed the shovel.   What exactly is going on?   <br> Is Pink insane and we're supposed to be viewing this from her perspective <br>This<br><br>This, its a shame because I fucking love seeing reactions to shit like shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Read the manga/watch the first episode before you get spoiled. Don't come back to any gakkou gurashi threads until then.</br>  <br>leave this thread immediately and download it now</br>  <br>Tabbed and watching it right now.</br>  <br>Shit taste.</br>  <br>Get the fuck out RIGHT now<br><br>Watch the first episode</br></br></br>  <br>Enjoy the SOL of the season</br>  Daily reminder that:<br> &gt;Yuki is slowing recovering from her delusional fiasco <br> Rii is becoming delusional  <br> Miki is starting to show anxiety disorder  <br> Kurumi is dying and suicide flags </br></br></br> <br><br>We're going to see a dead girl pretty soon. Prepare yourselves.</br></br></br>  <br> Liking TitsMcGee <br> Liking   the girl to give up hope the fastest <br>Bears go away</br></br></br>  She knows.  <br> So what did you animeonlyfags think about the reveal of the first episode of Gakkou Gurashi? <br>I've wanted a  deconstruction  of the SoL genre for a while now, and I'm glad I got what I wanted.</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=uS7<wbr>8f4WUbXs</wbr>  [ ]<br>This video pretty much sums it up</br></br>  <br>You mean SoD</br>  <br>She's a member of the gardening club. It's explained in the first episode.</br>  <br>Shovel is without a doubt best but I want to fuck a broken Rii-chan's tits.</br>  <br> your opinion and taste </br>  <br>she has a good bad habit of leaving and then sticking around to ease-drop</br>  SO what's the deal with radio-chan? how the fuck did she get infected inside that bunker? and if she was on meds and they stopped working how come kurumi ins't turning back into a zombie?  Why would they set up camp in a school of all places? Seems like a terrible decision if staying alive is their goal.  <br>Why would you ever like  the most mentally weak girl? </br>  <br>She was probably infected before she locked herself in the bunker. And it's possible she was infected for a lot longer than Kurumi has been so far.<br><br>It's also possible that Kurumi is super special half-dead now who can't be infected but isn't quite alive either but that's just me making up things because I don't want her to die.</br></br></br>  <br>I like who's the best.</br>  <br>The school has solar power and still has resources.</br>  <br>She's sexy, has big boobs and broken girls are fucking hot. It's not that hard to understand.</br>  <br>The outbreak happened while they were at school (note Sakura sensei is with them). So it's no wonder they got stuck in the school and barricade themselves from those flesh eaters.</br>  Made me marathon the manga, what a ride, liking it so far.  <br>That would make sense with fast zombies but we already saw how slowly these zombies move. It would take at least 20 days for them to actually outnumber native Japanese.</br>  <br>Everyone except Kurumi and Miki were on the roof when the outbreak happened. It was easier to just barricade themselves on the higher floors than to take the risk of escaping, especially since they had supplies. Megu-nee probably also knew about the shelter after reading the instructions so she talked them into staying there.<br><br>Also, Yuki was visibly breaking down so Megu-nee came up with the idea of pretending they were a club doing club activities to help Yuki cope.</br></br></br>  <br>forgot the bear ears</br>  <br> The school was actually prepared for such a situation. They are able to have electricity/take baths due to solar power, there's a school shop which has plenty of supplies including toiletries, and although the girls don't know this at the start there's also a bomb shelter in the basement with plenty of food. </br>  <br>my nig</br>  Is it bimonthly? How far are the raws?  <br>Yuuri &gt; Kurumi &gt; slav-chan &gt; Yuki.</br>  <br> She's sexy, has big boobs <br>Being sexy isn't all it takes to be a best girl<br> broken girls are fucking hot. <br>You're fucking weird.<br><br>So Garter/Shovel right?<br><br>Didn't make that image</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What really happened with the Miki situation where she and 11 others were living in that mall?<br><br>I know that one dude was bit but then they showed the page where he was lit on fire? why did they lock everyone else out?</br></br>  Everyone ITT saying shovel is the best<br>This is what the mangaka wants<br>Now all that's left is to kill her<br>And watch the butthurt in the future threads<br><br> Yuki bestgirl </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He was shitfaced, got infected, knocked some candles. Come on anon.</br>  <br>Kurumi &gt; Yuuri = Hatless Yuki &gt; Merely Pretending Yuki &gt; Miki &gt; Delusional Yuuki</br>  1) Garter belt<br>2) Yuki post heli crash<br>3) shovel<br>4) Rii <br><br><br>also anyone think they fucked up big time throwing that gun away?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Now all that's left is to kill her </br>  <br><br>so everyone else got lit on fire too?<br><br>sorry man I read the entire manga real late last night and was rushing thru it</br></br></br></br>  <br> If the schoo lis prepared for such events, then surely that means the company's sponsoring them or something. Like a testing grounds of some kind. They were probably working for some drug, and something went wrong, leading to the events right now. </br>    <br><br><br><br><br><br>http://strawpoll.me/4893979<br>Only one way to solve this problem</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I don't understand why the helicopter pilot killed himself like that.  <br>I can name a few reasons why it's good to throw away the gun.<br>1. Ammo<br>2. Too dangerous<br>3. You can kill zombies with melee weapons anyway</br></br></br></br>  <br> tights + swimsuit <br>Hnnnng</br></br>  I don't want to be one of those autists that complain about realism or whatever but the part where they strap the solar panel on the roof of the car is crazy how would they know how to wire a car to run on that solar panel? is it even possible?  Garter &gt; Twintails &gt; Neko Hat &gt; Long hair  <br>Yuki is actually the best, start from there.</br>  <br>My memory is going full retard but which chapter did they show the use of solar panel?</br>  <br>I was hoping they keep it for protection vs other survivors esp male ones, imo the zombies aren't all that dangerous if a high school girl can take care of multiple ones by herself <br><br>I guess the biggest argument against is the girl's mental state but I wanted miki to have kept it so far she is the most solid</br></br></br>  <br>He got a seizure. He first looks at the postcard they found from the girls but crumples it by making a fist. His hand is shaking when he reaches into the bag, and the girls that the helo is shaking too much. When he gets the syringe in his hand, he makes another fist which destroys the content.</br>  <br> &gt;also anyone think they fucked up big time throwing that gun away? <br>It really was just useless in their hands. They'd never be able to land headshots, the sound would only attract more zombies, and having the gun around just encourages the girls to commit suicide. <br><br>The suicide thing is why they threw it away in the first place.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't think the car is being solar powered, they're just carrying the solar panel with them.</br></br>  <br>Guns are a detriment during a zombie apocalypse. A bow and arrow would be much more practical.</br>  <br>I see, thanks.</br>  <br><br> I would never go through all that trouble. It's just gonna make it more painful when the truth hits her.</br></br>  <br>I thought he got infected. They were handling the items at the facility with gloves and whatnot but something might have been contaminated all the same.</br>  <br>I wanna say around 26 maybe just off the top of my head, you know after their "graduation" and they set out for the university the car they are driving has a massive solar panel on the roof of it, I distinctly remember a overhead shot showing the panel and they talk about it prior to leaving as well, they swap it for radio-chan's rv soon</br>  <br> I don't understand why the helicopter pilot killed himself like that. <br>Seriously? That what you think happened? Are you completely unable to read what happens in scenes that don't flat out tell you with text?</br></br>  <br>Some anon said he was infected instead.</br>  <br>the heli crash scene was not done well 1st time thru I didn't even realize how badly the school and roof got fucked up untill after they go back in</br>  <br>Megu-nee felt like it backfired horribly when Yuki started believing her own fantasy, but in the end she became stronger for it once she did manage to face the truth somewhat.<br><br>They mention that she's been very competent and capable lately even though she still keeps the act up.</br></br></br>  <br><br>OHHHHHHHHHHHH SHIT IMA PICK THIS UP THO. WHAT STUDIO MADE THIS GAT DANG  are the rest of them figments of her imagination, or are they all real survivors and shes just crazy about the rest of the students? </br></br>  <br>No shit<br><br>What do you think caused his seizure?</br></br></br>  <br>The rest of the girls are real  except the teacher. </br>  <br>rest of them are alive bruh aldoe in the manga the dog is ded and unded</br>  <br>She took it just fine</br>  <br>ahh right can't believe I didn't put that together makes sense now</br>  <br>I thought that you fags spammed it so much so everyone already knew about that "reveal". Then again, if I didn't know I probably wouldn't even have watched it.<br><br><br>Right, I have noticed that /a/ can only ruin your enjoyment of the shows with spoilers, trolling, shitposting, shit taste and god knows what else. I have no idea why I still come to this shithole.</br></br></br></br>  <br> being infected cause you to have a seizure <br>What?</br></br>  <br> I'm too stupid to understand whats going on <br> THIS MEANS THE SCENE WASN'T WELL DONE! </br></br>  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/leddit/</br>  <br>he's in the process of turning did you read the note radio chan left she had a sezuire that caused her writing to get all wonky at the end of the note too</br>  <br>She calms down after cleaning up the classroom and finding the album they made.</br>  If only the girls had had the good fortune to be born in America instead of Japan, so there would have been easy access to guns.  <br>Do you think you just RANDOMLY turn just like that? It's still a disease.</br>  <br><br><br>Is English your second language? Do you not read a lot or something? Must everything be spoonfed to you?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure she is just having a nightmare.<br><br>Not that we know the symptoms of long-term medication of the infected.</br></br></br>  <br>They had that survival guide software from the  underground shelter. </br>  <br>fixed that for you</br>  Why did that kid who arranged everyone to barricade themselves in the department store decide to set fire to himself before he turned? Why not just throw himself out the window?  <br>I really can't wait for this scene in the anime.</br>  <br>Also Kurumi was having seizures too.</br>  <br> after cleaning up the classroom <br>That was the cause in the first place</br></br>  <br>that heli crash scene was not well done bruh last night we had a consensus that it was a poorly done segment no need to get all nasty this is /a/ not /sp/ tbh</br>  <br>Because he was drunk and he clearly did it accidentally, holy shit everyone in this thread has brain problems.</br>  So far this show is silly, but not in a funny kind of way. Is it going to remain like this the whole time? It would be nice if something actually happened or they at least talked about something interesting.  <br>Thanks. I just took a quick grab and didn't bother cropping properly.<br><br><br>I meant the clubroom. She and Miki go and clean up in the clubroom and find a ball as well as the album, which calms her down.</br></br></br></br>  <br> can kill a zombie with a broom <br>This zombies seem to be very fragile.</br></br>    <br>it was done poorly doe and we don't know what happened to the others we just assume they burned too?</br>  <br> Is too stupid to understand a scene without being spoonfed <br> bruh <br> tbh <br>Fuck off to whatever shithole you came from you idiot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She smashed its head.</br>  HOw did Yuki immediately know what was going on with Rii and the bear. Her first question wasn't "why did you take my bear," it was "who is that?" As though she immediately knew that Rii had picked up the teddy bear and deluded herself into thinking it was her little sister  <br> last night we had a consensus <br><br>Oh fuck off, I blazed through the manga last night as well and was able to understand what had happened just fine. <br><br> bruh <br> tbh <br> no need to get all nasty <br><br>Where the hell do you think we are?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCK ME SIDEWAYS I JUST NOTICED  the grave marker in the garden at 15:35. Is that for the dog?  What else have I missed?</br>  <br><br>Do you even zombie flicks? Guns tend to just attract more of them and you're limited by ammunition. Melee weapons don't give you those problems and you shouldn't be standing around fighting off hoards of them anyway.</br></br>  <br>WATASHITACHI WA KOKO NI IMASU~</br>  <br>She really is the most mentally weak</br>  <br>It's for  Megu-nee. </br>    <br> 2007 was 8 years ago <br>Kill me please</br></br>  This series has the best  SUFFERING  faces  <br>I was in the threads last night too and there was no such consensus.</br>  <br>It's not for the dog. Just pay attention during the episode, there are 3 or so background things to pick up on including what you saw.</br>  So  when did Megu-nee really die? before the start of the show or when they had to sue the broadcasting station?     <br> Even the subtle suffering faces are amazing. </br>  <br>You've never see any zombie related media have you? Arrows/Crossbows, and melee weapons are the most effective ways to take out a zombie. Guns will just attract everything in a mile radius unless you have a silencer.</br>  <br>Before the start.</br>  <br>Thank you. From now on ill watch super intently for more. Havent found the third yet. This is like a puzzle. Ive been waiting for a show like this.</br>  <br> holy shit everyone in this thread has brain problems. <br>I really do feel like half of the people in this thread are fucking idiots that have no idea how to read picture only scenes.</br></br>  <br>I never asked of this</br>  <br>But she got told it's daijoubu so she is fine now.</br>  <br/>  <br> So far this show is silly <br><br>first. fucking. episode. mate.</br></br></br>  <br>I was a little disappointed that The Walking Dead stopped paying attention to that rule except when it benefited the plot.</br>  <br>Did you finish the episode? What do you mean?</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure she's alive at the start of the manga, and dies  in the chapter where Yuki goes to the toilet and Shovel is getting overrun by all the zombies in the hallway. Sensei is also in the toilet feeling guilty about not reading the emergency manual earlier and gets bitten on her way to the broadcast room to distract the zombies. </br>  <br> But it done not all come true at all </br>  <br><br>When CatHat are walking alone in the hallway there is a part of the scene where it focuses in on the window.  The window is broken. <br><br>Garter not  paying any attention to any of the people in the glassrooms <br><br>RIGHT after the scene with the  grave  there is a pan out shot that  shows the "people" in the field hunched over funny <br><br>HARDTACKS TASTE LIKE  SURVIVAL   Hardtacks are rations <br><br>When the teacher says  IM A CASUALTY? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No, she was dead a long time ago. She just recalled a similar scene, when the outbreak started to spread. </br>  <br>In case you didn't notice garter also wasn't part of the crew in the start of the manga yet there she is. They clearly moved the start of the manga after Megu-nee bought it.</br>  <br>It will never be fine</br>  <br>No shit, Sherlock.<br><br>Do you really have to post things we already know of? Fucking secondary.</br></br></br>  <br> Japan and english. </br>  <br>Looks like someone fast-read the manga.  That Megu-nee scene was a flashback. </br>  <br> dreaded_japanese_cold.png </br>  <br>The series is amazing when it comes to tired looking eyes and dried lips.</br>  <br>The first episode isn't really indicative of later episodes' quality at all, for obvious reasons.<br><br>There are definitely a lot of better ways they could have done this without dragging it out so much, but there's no reason to not stick around because you didn't like the moe SoL shenanigans, future episodes will have a lot more things actually happening</br></br></br>  <br>Did they really? I haven't seen the last two seasons yet.</br>  <br>He was posting it for a new guy asking you little shitbird.</br>  <br> This is like a puzzle. Ive been waiting for a show like this. <br><br>...What shows do you watch normally? Foreshadowing is nothing new.</br></br></br>  Machinist/Warrior/White Mage  <br> spoonfeeding <br><br>Well, there's your problem.</br></br></br>  <br>I was posting it for the guy who didn't catch any of that you asshat.</br>  <br> Machinist is fucking trash DPS so shes not going to be helpful until they buff her. Plus she needs to stop using that fucking knockback skill.  </br>  <br>Fuck off<br><br>People like you are the most cancerous part of /a/</br></br></br>  <br>Im the guy who asked. Im sorry if that offended you but ive watched through this twice now and I dont think I would have noticed some things like the schoolyard bit.</br>  <br>Still mad that Kurumi's VA isn't Taneda Risa.</br>  <br>Don't reply to the shitposters<br><br>I suggest you start reading the manga unless you want major spoilers.</br></br></br>  So wait a minute,  if the dog is kill, how come its food tray got emptied from eating?   Or did the food never exist?   <br>From roughly when they have to leave the farm onwards the incidence of gunfire actually attracting zombies from miles around goes drastically down, if you pay attention.</br>  <br>What if the food were humans all along?</br>   Megu-nee threw the zombie dog out instead of killing it, how useless can she be   <br>Insanity is one hell of a drug</br>  <br>Why do you people keep posting?<br>The dog is not dead in the anime<br>It interacted with the other girls</br></br></br>  <br>They changed things up a bit. The dog's alive here,  but it's death will have more impact. </br>  <br>Clearly this just means the other girls are dead as well</br>  <br>I don't think she really fits Kurumi anyways.</br>  <br>I wonder how she did that.  She would had had to unleash the zombie dog before throwing it away. </br>  <br>yea you understand that the rooftop was devastated afterwords when they get up and show the burned crops at the time doe it was confusing since the heli crashed off to the side and even if there was an explosion doesn't makes sense that it would spread upwards thru the floors<br><br>poorly done scene brehs no matter how you slice it</br></br></br>  <br>She's half American. Americans turn into pussies when it comes to killing dogs.</br>  <br>How fucking daft are you?  They are playing along so that pink hair doesnt snap. Thats why she tries to keep her company and always agrees with what she is doing even though its all fake.  </br>  <br>It's alive.</br>  <br>Do you mean on another new level of Yuki's delusions?</br>    real talk I just read the manga not because I like it but so I can feel superior to others in these threads when talking with anime only bruhs  <br>Why would Miki interrupt imaginary classes to search for an imaginary dog?</br>  <br> So wait if its alive earlier in the episode how does it die? It never went outside and theres no zombos inside. </br>  Why hasn't America nuked Tokyo yet?  <br>no dog is real and alive doesn't make sense for all them to chase the dog around</br>  <br>It only dies in the manga so far. We've yet to see what they'll do with it in the anime.</br>    <br>Why would Miki the dog went missing if Yuki didn't mention anything like that?</br>  Rii didn't really do much for me in the manga, but something about the way she looks in motion really turns me on. She makes me want to stick my dick in crazy.  <br>it was dead in the manga because when they found it it was recently bitten already and turned in a few days</br>  Wached the fist episode, was not impressed by the SoL parts.<br><br>Just binged through the whole manga, an it's extremly good. Why did they change so many things? Miis introduction was extremly important..</br></br>  <br>It is spoiled on every site that has a plot summary</br>  <br>They literally react to what the dog is doing with no prompting from Yuki. They were the ones that started the dog search in the first place, not Yuki.</br>  <br>they most likely did it to speed up the plot, I'm thinking they can have at least one flashback episode for miki's mall adventure tbh</br>  <br> Girls on one piece of paper  <br> Dog on a separate one  <br>Dog death confirmed</br></br></br>  <br> Episode 3 opening. <br> Dog's piece of paper isn't there, the part that was covered was zombie Taromaru. </br></br>  they need to get rid of that dog if it is alive, it's one more mouth to feed and plus he's too much of a wildcard running around and shit  <br>Some people were waiting for the  zombie apocalypse to start. Little do they know that it already started. </br>  <br>SoL was insanely stretched out, they spent an entire episode on the first chapter. If they get a proper pacing and focus less ON THAT FUCKING DOG it should be fine.</br>  <br>Could be that Yuki's still delusional herself and actually sees another person</br>  <br>Please don't mention dongs anymore<br>Bestgirl doesn't like it</br></br>  Before I dedicate to this show I need to know. Is it going to remain like 95% slice of life, or will it do more frequent shifts between the two?   watch the episode <br> pretty good <br> it's an adaptation and not an original anime <br>Fuck this shit, it's just as I expected, people that already read the manga spoiling shit every thread, why is that every good anime has to be adaptation? If it was original anime then these threads sure would be more enjoyable.</br></br></br>  <br>They couldn't think of a more boring thing to "shock" the audience with than zombies.</br>  <br>SoL is pretty much over if they follow the manga plot.</br>  <br>the anime could be going in a diff direction but in the manga there are very little sprinkles of sol left mostly just cute girls doing survivial shit like foraging for food</br>  <br>Delusions doesn't work that way.</br>  <br><br>If you're asking if we see more of Yuki's delusions, or the reality of the situation, it's the latter. We generally don't see through Yuki's eyes very much. Anime might change it up I guess, but I really dobut it.</br></br>  <br>Probably not much. There was some SoL stuff when Miki was introduced, but that wouldn't make sense here since Miki is there from the start in the anime</br>  <br>70% SoL, 10% action, 40% insanity</br>  <br>I hope it becomes more zombie than moeshit at some point</br>  <br>Just read the manga like everyone else. Not every show is made for speculah.</br>  <br>That's not how math works anon</br>  <br>Yes, i'm ok with this</br>  <br><br> That happened to me. The realization of how fucked everything was hit me like a truck. </br></br>  <br>You can read the manga if you want to enjoy the threads. It's a good manga anyway.</br>  <br> Daijoubu </br>  <br><br>I still don't understand why the helicopter burned down half the school, didn't it crash out by the gate?</br></br>  <br>This show is 100% zombie. FIrst episode was just Yukis coping mechanism.</br>  <br>Do you know how fire works?</br>  <br>One panel showed a trail of gasoline to some cars.</br>  <br>that was my question too breh it crashed on the grounds of the school even if there was an explosion that spread it doesn't make sense that the fire could climb all the way up to the roof and burn the crops/solar panels <br><br>it was a poorly done scene</br></br></br>  <br>fire doesn't spread upwards only smoke do</br>  <br><br>But the schoolyard is largely just barren non-flammable earth.<br>And the cars are parked on the literal other side of the school from the garden. School is also built of largely non-flammable concrete.<br>Still can't visualize the fire getting all the way over there.</br></br></br></br>  Whats her disability, /a/?  <br>Animeonlyfag, please.</br>  <br> comparing a screencap from the anime to the manga </br>  <br>This meme isn't even applicable here</br>  <br>Psychosis<br>DID accodring to manga</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127936703 <br>/v/ pls go and stay go</br>  <br><br>Cars are still well away from the building and the tanks shouldn't hold enough gasoline to burn a whole school when they caught fire out on the grounds.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127936703 <br>kill yourself</br>  <br>B-but Bane told me that fire rises.<br><br>Are you telling me that Bane lied to me?</br></br></br>  Reminder that if you want "epic reactions" from animeonly fags you should just fuck off to youtube.  The one thing I didn't like about the manga is  that they found the antidote syringes as well as the hints about the origin of the zombie apocalypse (that company). I prefer my zombie fiction where the origin is not revealed, or has no interaction with the protagonists and where the disease is incurable. THis would also fit in with the sense of hopelessness that the manga has otherwise.   <br> stuterring <br>Go away</br></br>  <br>What about jet fuel?</br>  The character designs look like fatalpulse sometimes.<br><br>Just me?</br></br>  <br>N-n-never</br>  <br>Nope, I thought the same thing.</br>  <br><br><br><br>They could have kept it for a "cleaner" or at least "more impersonal" way of putting people down.<br><br>If they're worried about accidental discharge then just unload it and empty the chamber.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The "twist" has already happened, there is nothing to react to anymore.</br>  <br>It should be deeper than that. There are even booklets and shelters in case of an outbreak, parts of the planet might be isolated altogether.</br>  <br>Yes, stop reading too much porn</br>  <br>Is this why I feel so attracted to Yuki breaking down?</br>  <br>Is gasoline even really flammable like that? I thought it being hugely volatile was largely an urban myth.</br>  I wish it would have come earlier. The moe stuff was so awful I ended up just skipping around after the first 10 minutes.  <br>Yes. There aren't any fat bald men.</br>  Im glad for you manga guys but you have to admit the build up to the reveal was 10x better in the show compared to it just 'happening' in the manga. Especially when its so subtle that people dont notice 9/10 of the things.  i want to fuck shovel-chan  <br>See, if I wanted that kind of story I would watch World War Z again. I'd rather keep on seeing how the girls cope with their personal struggles. I consider the backstory a distraction.</br>  <br>No, it was shit, the dog part was just annoying.</br>  <br>Don't you think that its a little harsh? Telling him to go away because of the way he t-t-t-t-talks?</br>  <br>The end of the episode was good, yes. What I take issue with is the tedious part before it, and all the changes they made compared to the manga.</br>  <br>Which is silly because the first is like saying "sick with illness" and the second has nothing to do with Yuki's symptoms. She's suffering from something like depersonalization-derealization disorder and psychogenic fugue.</br>  <br>I don't understand what you're saying. Rewrite that disaster of a run-on sentence and maybe I will.</br>  Fuck, just finished the first episode and even though I already knew what was going to happen I still even got watery eyes. They nailed it.<br><br>I just remember reading the first two chapters of the manga, I wonder if I should read the rest, the anime just feel so slow once you know what's going to happen. I think I will leave that for later.</br></br>  <br>The author need to end it at some point.</br>  <br>The dog chasing was shit but you cant have a huge twist in the middle of the episode. They needed something to fill the gap. Im sure its all business from here on out.</br>  <br>Why are zombie writers so afraid of shows ending in tragic defeats?</br>  <br>Maybe the copter broke the ground and lit a gas line that went back into the school. <br><br>Or burning pieces of the wreckage flew into the school and lit it. In either case no firefighters around even a small fire in a location unreachable to the girls would be entirely uncontrollable, so it didn't take much to get things going.</br></br></br>  <br>Psychosis is a symptom, not a disease</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the manga will keep focusing on the characters' psyche and use the plot advancements just to push them further towards their breaking point, as it's been so far.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that the point is  the company and government knew that there was a significant chance they would lose control of their "controlled experiment", and prepared shelters accordingly. Which is kind of terrifying in its own right. </br>  <br><br>Tragic defeats are fine, but they lose a lot of their impact if there was absolutely no hope of salvation to begin with.</br></br>  <br>Right, and backstory is another tool that can be used to push the characters. It gives them some sort of goal to work towards rather than just wander around aimlessly</br>  That piano shit at the end ruined the scene. I had soft piano shit unless its like Clannad.   other threads was deleted <br> can't open files anymore <br>Thanks mods, you're shitheads.<br>Archivefags can fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>Was music box<br>I liked it</br></br>  <br>I would have preferred they kept it ominous rather than going for something sad.</br>  <br> piano <br>Retard<br>It was rather nice</br></br></br>  <br>I decided to watch this because I've seen an image with the cute girl with the cat hat.<br>Downloaded the first episode and watched it without knowing anything about it, looking at its synopsis, or checking any of its threads.<br>It seemed like a nice SoL.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It was a xylophone step it up.</br></br>  <br><br>Having them not knowing what's going on, with no hope for a cure/better life is the most depressing thing.<br><br>But either way, the writing has been stellar so far, I'm confident it will remain insteresting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's meant to be sad.</br>  <br>Pshh, anon knows it obviously better</br>  <br>Wasn't there a test on youtube where they basicallly showed that bows can't pierce a skull?</br>  I was already spoiled by /a/.<br><br>But never the less, I read all the manga up to the latest chapter, and it was dogshit.<br>At least I know now that the series will be shitty forced drama which I can drop confidently now.</br></br></br>  <br> forced drama <br>I didn't see any unfair argument</br></br>  <br>they left food, energy and everything else needed, without the shelters there'd be no way they would survive for so long, honestly</br>  <br>This is forced shitpost.</br>  <br> forced drama </br>  <br> forced drama <br>where do you draw the line?</br></br>  I'm so far enjoying the mentally unstable homicidal moe.  <br> forced drama. </br>  So what's this series about? I see post-apocalyptia, various forms of insanity and mental breakdown with moe girls.<br><br>What happened? Nuclear fire, zombies, which one is it?</br></br>  <br>Shovel NTR.</br>  <br>I think it was really well made. Their were some nice subtle hints like the Stephen King book, or how Miki just went straight into the classes without considering the other students and teachers. One of the best first episodes this season.</br>  <br><br>Zombies, man.</br></br>  <br><br>Nuclear zombies that are on fire.</br></br>  <br>why are the sourcefags for this show so fucking obnoxious? Yes we get it, there's a twist but you don't have to remind us every fucking thread</br>  <br>No fucking way. I completely missed that.</br>  Just marathon'd the manga.<br><br> I still don't get how the helicopter pilot got infected. He managed to pilot the heli all the way to the school just fine without any bites.<br><br>And the scene where Kurumi gets ignored by the zombies means she's a sentient undead? The serum didn't work in fully curing her, sure, but it seems like it would have some physiological side-effects.</br></br> </br></br>  <br> implying heads don't have weak points </br>  <br>Yeah, I'm pretty sure your typical Japanese highschool girl can pierce the eye of a zombie with every single shot.</br>  <br>I suppose it's ok to like this just because it's cute girls even though it's literally worse than fucking Walking Dead</br>  <br><br>  I think it's implied that the pilot was infected and using the serum like Kurumi was, but that it lost it's effectiveness eventually and he turned. Which means Kurumi will eventually turn as well, like him and radio lady.  </br></br>  <br> inciting fanbase wars <br>Kill yourself</br></br>  <br>I'm guessing   the serum only delays the turning and isn't a real cure. Same thing happened to the helicopter pilot.  </br>  <br> wah he doesn't like what I like <br>You have shit taste by the way. The only good thing is the artstyle. The "plot" is bad, the character "flaws" are boring and/or unrealistic.<br>Wait, girls can actually drive?<br>Oh no there comes the rescue helicopter, but it crashed!?<br>The manga is stupid all around where the girls always go somewhere alone. ALWAYS.<br>I seriously hope that the anime will just ditch the drama shit and becomes a zombie comedy sol.<br><br><br><br> Oh no they get a cute dog, but it's actually already bitten! ;_; many sad such drama <br> Oh no the cheerful radio host turned into a zombie JUST as we arrived AND made a damatic note. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I see. Moe girls couldn't handle the collapse of the world and death so they broke, huh. <br><br>Delusions and mentally fragile girls ahoy, I presume.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Reminder that  there was more than one person in the helicopter, so maybe the pilot was bitten during the flight. </br></br></br>  <br>The manga is already better than the walking dead.</br>  <br>In other words, it's drama you can't simpathyze with</br>  <br>"Forced drama" doesn't mean anything, and is shitposting.</br>  If the zombie disease spreads by bites and you wouldn't get it from the environment then why did they need to treat the postcards like biohazards?  Just read everything<br><br> mfw chapter 35 <br>I was ready to break down</br></br></br>  <br>Asians are pretty good at archery, anon. Haven't you watched the Olympics?</br>  <br>She knew she was turning and hid herself when she heard them coming<br>Stop asking the manga to pander to your tastes</br></br>  Question: How long: until we get to a beach episode? <br><br>Summer festival with fireworks episode? <br><br>School festival episode?</br></br></br></br>  <br>In other words, drama just becuz cute gurrls r sad ;_;<br><br>fucking stupid, even anohana didn't force the drama like this shit</br></br></br>    <br>Never, never and soon.</br>  WHAT THE FUCK AM I WATCHING, ITS YUUKI YUUNA ALL OVER AGAIN BUT EPISODE 1  <br>I'm fairly sure those are just the zombies it crashed onto.</br>  <br>Asians are, not Japanese highschool girls.</br>  <br>You're supposed to read World War Z, not watch it.<br><br><br>[spoilers]The zombies are actually still semi-conscious as well.[/spoiler]</br></br></br></br>  <br>You get bathing suits at one point, but that's it.<br><br>How long s the anime, 2 cour?

Well, they were actually playing in the canal, but still.</br>  <br>upvote, this shitpost is actually clever</br>    <br> semi-conscious <br><br>Mother of mercy, that's some fucked up shit right there. Ah fuck, that's metal as fuck man. <br><br>Christ.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It was to show you that the medicine loses effectivity over time. <br>I knew that you shitstain, it's just that the timing is too convenient.</br></br>  Why didn't they get some kyudo bows from the school gym to snipe zombies with?  <br>Something is a terrible adaptation if you have to read the source material to know what is going on or to fill apparent plot holes.</br>  <br>The dog was barely a footnote in the manga, it only had around six pages of panel time. Panel time that was purely flashback and was barely played for drama.<br><br>Hell, the dog wasn't important so much as the conversation that followed after about whether or not the girls could kill each other if it was necessary.</br></br></br>  <br> Summer festival with fireworks episode? <br>Yuki proposes that they hold an Obon festival.<br><br> The bonfire is Kurumi's body being burned to make sure she doesn't rise. </br></br></br></br>  <br>D-did you just go all 2deep4u?<br>Please don't do that again.</br></br>  Not even gonna read the fucking thread. I was a retard and read enough spoilers already. I am just gonna stay off 4chan till the season ends.   Does anyone here think Kurumi will actually turn? The signs are all there, but I don't think the manga will actually follow through with it.   <br> MCH DPS <br> trash <br><br>Pick one or get good.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But you don't?<br><br>Also it's been 1 episode.</br></br></br>  <br>If it actually happens, either she'll off herself before then, or one of the other characters will.</br>  <br>Because token glasses girl is not with the party either. At least we got our token loli.</br>  So why did the helicopter guy... do what he did?  <br>That's what happens when you have a character who feels they have to be the cool and calm leader that's there to keep everyone safe.<br>see: Mami<br><br>She really broke after shovel was turning and she was getting ready to put her down.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>  Definitely. Though I wouldn't be surprised if it's dragged out until the end of the series. I don't feel like this is the type of series to cop out like that.

Note how Kurumi just started thrashing about randomly; basically someone else probably has to dose the medicine for you otherwise you're fucked when it comes back, even if you had the serum in your hand.</br></br></br>  <br>fuck</br>  <br>Schools having solar panels isn't exactly unthinkable depending on the location.</br>  <br>It wasn't perfect timing to begin with, you should look at it from the character's perspective rather than symbolism<br>She didn't want to give anyone hope since she was already turning into a zombie, so she just killed herself before meeting them</br></br>  Are there any  boy  characters in this?  <br>How can you faggot have such a shit taste.<br>The manga is trash.<br><br>Read I am a Hero or something</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah we get it, is there anything else you need?</br>  <br>Nope.

It was better back then of course when we didn't have people copy pasting things from reddit, obnoxious retards trying to act superior because they read the manga a week before the anime aired and yelling to other to read the manga, etc.</br></br></br>  <br>Decide to read manga after episode 1.<br><br>But I afraid the way the studio handle the adaptation very well, we will only going downhill.</br></br></br>  <br>SHE IS TALKING ABOUT MIKI YOU DENSE FAGGOT.</br>  <br>There was that one guy in Miki's group who became a zombie and got everyone else killed<br><br>There's also helicopter pilot and Kurumi's senpai, but they're not really "characters" in the first place<br><br><br>Ebin</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You have issues.</br>  <br> we will only going downhill. <br>because the manga is so shitty?</br></br>  <br><br>Stop replying to shitposters</br></br>  Thought it was amazing then spent the whole night reading as much of the manga as I could. Cried internally when I couldn't read more.  <br><br>Stop replying to repliers of shitposting</br></br>  <br>I will when people stop making threads.</br>  <br><br>Go back to your nurutu threads</br></br>  Have they never heard of the Nuremberg Code in Japan? I see human experimentation come up as a topic in so many anime, that I can just assume all anime writers are ignorant college drop outs who just lever learned that this kind of thing is very illegal.  Who is Charlotte?  Nano desu!  I want to cum inside Nao-chan.  good subs when<br>http://pastebin.com/h11nt5ri</br>   Page 8 <br>Don't be in such a rush.</br>  <br><br>GJM-Mezashite is doing this show, though I don't know when's the ETA of Episode 2. Anyone know?</br></br>    What can the idol even do?  <br>get in line</br>  <br>The problem is, if you had her for your waifu she could troll the fuck out of you all day by making herself invisible just to you.</br>  Finally my long awaited Maeda drama, after episode 1 I was kind of afraid this is going to have just bad comedy but now I can feel safe that it's authentic Key title.  <br> Nao going invisible from her being embarrassed for the pleasure of being cummed inside </br>  X man the anime is not bad.  So is Udoh the red man?  <br>They are just member of Gaia</br>  <br>Gaia is more like green peace taken to an another level.</br>   an invisible girl that is always listening to music   and is best girl     character from Castlevania  Who are they?<br><br> you can see long hair dude among them </br></br>  <br>The Occult Research Society.</br>  <br>ZIHEND</br>  <br>Is Kanye going to turn into Magneto?</br>  Do you think the imouto is still a virgin?  <br>Her power is to regenerate her hymen.</br>  <br>The new reaction video for us</br>  Can't she be reported for breaking into a student's locker?  I really hope Sonic gets a girl. He seems like he could be a top tier bro so far, so he deserves it.  <br>You first.</br>  <br>but...</br>  <br>That's not how blackmailing works.</br>  <br> virgin = intact hymen <br>No.</br></br>  if there is such a school full of people with these special powers, how has no one not found out about it yet?  <br>She was able to get MC's medical records in the first episode. I'm pretty sure she has some kind of privileges to conduct the investigations</br>  <br>No, only handful of people have powers there. And it seems like they have some kind of protector. Don't know who yet, though.</br>  <br>I guess the scientsists can do nothing to students of that school for some reason</br>  <br>He attempted murder</br>  I was expecting the first guy with the pictures to be the one with powers and for them to realize this right after finding out that there is no Udo in 2-E class.  <br><br>Did anyone have the translated caption for this image?</br></br>  <br>He should pay for all damage he did.</br>  Kind of makes me want to play Rewrite again.  <br> You know, for someone trying to prevent people to abuse their powers, this dude abuses his powers a lot.</br>  Nips have finished the analysis and it seems like four-eyes paid enough for the sandwiches. Good for hum.  <br>Dem otaku sometimes.</br>  <br>*from abusing their powers</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  Anyone else see Qualia the Purple aspects in this? Like the ebil scientists experimenting on them, the girl who is really trustworthy of their "protectors" and wants to bring others under that "protection", etc.  I want fo fuck Nao while she's invisible.  <br>Any new on the new game the three writter are creating ?<br><br><br>So a girl can suck dick and having anal and still being virgin ? But a girl who lost her hymen while doing gym is not ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to double-team Charlotte with four-eyes while she's invisible.</br>  Does everybody at their school either have powers or potentially have powers? Doesn't that make them a lot easier to identify and take in for experimentation?  <br> They are getting protection, retard.</br>  <br>Did they say they're under the protection of something or their school was hidden?</br>  <br>They're in the school for their own protection. The evil scientists cannot take students that are attending that school for some reason.</br>  <br> lost her hymen while doing gym <br>"I lost it in gym class during partner exercises you're still my first don't worry bby" ;^)</br></br>    <br>I'm really curious about this guy. He talks about how Nao doesn't have any friends because a lot of people are scared of her, but he clearly doesn't. And then Nao talks about how she doesn't trust anyone, but she clearly trusts him to help her out, as well as telling him a lot about her past.<br><br>Is this another Hinata and Yuri friendship?</br></br></br>  <br>True. Even when I slept with my gf her hymen for some reason was still intact after.</br>  <br>She likely forces other people away from herself due to her trauma. And she might just have told only the members of the council (all one of them, now two) about her past because they work together.</br>  I could do without the inevitable full on drama and watch an entire series of recruitment shenanigans.  <br>You can always stop watching in six episodes.</br>  <br><br>Not that anon, but what are you trying to say? Because it's entirely possible to break it without sexual contact.</br></br>  <br> for some reason <br><br>lol ok</br></br></br>  <br>I can't stand how the shadows on the legs are not in compliance</br>  <br>Paid too much by the looks of it.</br>  <br>Okay man, believe whatever you want.</br>  <br>Just pretend she's a nudist beach member or something and has a glowing groin.</br>  <br>So, when is the forced romance between MC and main girl going to start?</br>  <br><br>that's because they only animated a single leg and mirrored it</br></br>  <br>Ever heard of horseback riding?</br>  <br> Well, she already told him about her traumatic past and introduced him to her brother even though she has known him for like one week, and she spent most of that time stalking him and watching him being a total asshole.<br> So, two more episodes.</br></br>  <br> He's the one. <br> Also, the MC's working for the scientist side, infiltrating the school and surveying the students. He possessed himself so that he bypassed the 5 second rule and forgot about his involvement with the scientists. This also eliminates any risk if being caught by Charlotte or having his mind read. <br> I'm the script writer </br></br></br>  <br>That's a myth.
