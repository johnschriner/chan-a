[   <br> 4 posts per ip <br>seems about right</br></br>  Say something good about KyoAni  <br>I manahged to fap to all of their girls</br>  They created Hibike! Euphonium, which was Spring AOTS.  Literally the second best studio around after  SHAFT     <br><br>They are good.</br></br>  <br><br>KyoAni</br></br>  Eupho is one of the best anime ever made.  <br>They find a way.</br>  their the best studio and /a/'s favorite studio  <br>It sucks.</br>  KyoAni takes shit source material like Amaburi and Hibike and turns it into 10/10 masterpieces.<br><br>Truly only GOAT studios can do that.</br></br>  They are Jeff Goldblum's favorite animation studio  <br>this</br>  <br>They stopped with the melty bug face.</br>  Made amaburi  The shows are overrated garbage bu the girls are very waifuable even the crowd chicks are cute.  Everybody above this post is retarded      <br><br>Underrated post.</br></br>  Top tier Christmas Cakes.<br><br>That said, I really wonder how it would look if they tackle stuff like mecha.</br></br>  <br> Amaburi <br> Hibike <br> Masterpieces </br></br></br>  They animate extremely cute and extremely fappable grils  <br>mechas piloted by cakes</br>  <br>They animated my waifu and my home country beautifully</br>  Their shows spawn god-tier pornography. And three years on, Hyouka is still better looking than most anime we get today. That's cool I guess.  <br>Even Anko?</br>  <br>Please anon, I cannot be so more erect.</br>  <br>I'm calling the police.</br>  <br>Fuck you. Don't sexualize the Tamakos. Delete that eyesore from your PC and kill yourself.<br><br>They really do calm and cool anime.</br></br></br>  <br>delete this</br>  The animation quality of their shows is so far above the rest of the industry that it is getting embarassing.  <br>they always find a way and make best waifus</br>  I wish KnK wasn't made digitally. I hate that vectory linework  They animated my waifus.<br><br> Yes, we muslims are allowed to have up to 4 waifus and legal loli marriage. </br></br>  Their commercially unsuccessful anime are really good. It's like they want to reward being a hipster.  <br>Reported</br>  <br>no money to be made in mecha<br> eupho route of showing every other 3 seconds of a fight </br></br>  They have never produced a mediocre show    <br>They draw godly characters with moles.</br>  <br>Every anime you've ever watched in the last 10 or so years was made digitally, you genius.</br>  <br>Actually, K-On! was mediocre. Offensively so.</br>  <br>It depends how you decide to sell it. Let's face it, mecha is all about the pilots and the downtime.</br>  They make some of the best shows. That is, when they don't get deep into /u/ and /y/ bait. Which is not very often unfortunately.  Their shows are beautiful and the girls are girly<br>Their fanservice is generally in good taste</br>  They made Lucky Star.  <br>or they could cg all the actual mecha fighting besides the slow panning shots/raising the mecha out of storage and other pornographic shots</br>  Hyouka is god damn near perfection.  <br> mecha <br> christmas cakes <br> yuri <br> ??? <br> crossange 2 </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Keyframing is still made traditionally, with KnK even the keyframes were made digitally, that's what I meant, it makes it look clean and soulless.</br>  <br>amen</br>  <br> pornographic shots <br> delicious close ups of parts moving. <br>Yes.</br></br></br>  They're dead.  <br>Hyouka, K-ON, Haruhi and Nichijou are all pretty much perfect examples of their respective genres</br>  <br><br> lucky star <br><br>JESUS TITTY FUCKING CRACK SMOKING CHRIST ON A MOPED WHY WOULD YOU HAVE THIS SAVED?!<br><br>SERIOUSLY WHAT KIND OF PERSON SEEKS OUT, DOWNLOADS, SAVES AND REPOSTS AN IMAGE, AN ANIMATED IMAGE, OF A DEER FUCKING A CRYING SCHOOLGIRL?!<br><br>LIKE I KNOW THERE ARE BIZARRE FETISHES AND WEIRD SHIT THAT TURNS PEOPLE ON, AND YOU KNOW I'M TOTALLY COOL WITH THAT, I JUST DON'T LOOK AT IT.

Chuu22 aside from the forced drama it was good, KnK was truly average.</br>  <br>i need the bad pussy</br>  <br> Opinions </br>  Would you fuck a Chuuni, /a/?  Seriously though, can a studio that can only make moe sol shows and fail everytime it tries to make a good story (knk) be considered good ?<br>Kyoani is just a waifu studio</br>  They are the undisputed masters of comfy anime.    <br>Studios that don't suck Aniplex marketing dick are at a disadvantage from the start. Even if they make the Citizen Kane of anime they can't reach new audiences that aren't moebros or fujoladies.</br>  <br> Kyoani's only worth watching show </br>  <br>better than 99% of the other studios, which others actually make original and further subset good</br>  <br>what anime/studio do you like apart from haruhi?let's hear it</br>  <br>Yahari.</br>  <br>I bet you are a normie-tryhard who only watches "good and mature anime"</br>  <br>pls die</br>  <br> reaction image <br/></br>  <br> yfw Yahari sold more than 10k <br> yfw hibike hardly broke 7k with an event ticket <br> yfw hibike will never get a second season </br></br></br>  <br> mfw salesfag <br><br>fuck off</br></br></br>  <br>No. Haruhi is edgy chuunishit for teens COMBINED with slice of life moeshit.<br>So it's 2 cancers on top of each other.<br><br>KyoAni's 2 shows that aren't shit are Hyouka and Hibike. Everything else is sewage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kyoani aims for casuals, they just make a likeable girl and casuals stop caring about the actual plot, it doesn't matter how shitty the anime is people keep watching it because they found a waifu</br>  <br> it's in a language I can't read therefore it's shit  <br>KyoAniggers in a nutshell.</br></br>  i love their girl designs :333  <br> edgy </br>  I really really like Hibike it's so fucking good and I'm glad they didn't just make it into Jazz-on. There was a few episode I felt like I could really relate to so it kinda touched close for me but even so.  <br> KyoAni's 2 shows that aren't shit are Hyouka and Hibike. <br> Hibike </br></br>  I'm rewatching KnK and realizing how much i actually like it. The first time I thought it was a huge convoluted piece of shit like so many others, but the second time through I realize how wrong I was.  <br> hibike <br> not shit </br></br>  <br>good quality taste</br>  <br>Jazz-on would be kinda cool actually</br>   CTRL+F <br> Hibike: 12 matches <br> Euphonium: 3 matches <br> Sound!: phrase not found <br> UFO: phrase not found <br> 響け: phrase not found <br> ユーフォニアム: phrase not found <br>All these fucking EOP</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hibike <br> eop <br>Are you retarded?<br>Don't answer, we already know you are.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know it's bait, but anyways<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/2ch/</br></br>  Managed to save anime last season.  <br>Let me guess, when you don't feel like typing the full "Neon Genesis Evangelion", you refer to the show as "Shinseiki"?</br>  <br>Everyone calls it just Hibike even the japs you dingleberry retard.<br>Go take your Xanax you're overdue.</br></br>  <br> &gt;CTRL+F <br> &gt;Hibike: 12 matches <br> &gt;Euphonium: 3 matches <br> &gt;Sound!: phrase not found <br> &gt;UFO: phrase not found <br> &gt;phrase not found <br> &gt;phrase not found <br> All these fucking EOP <br><br>ワイトピグプリスゴウ</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I don't call it DanMachi I call it Danjon ni Deai o Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka  <br> even the japs <br>[citation needed]</br></br>    Hey look its best girl!

You know KyoAni generally isn't that good at adapting things, so if you haven't played it you really aren't entitled to an opinion.</br></br>  <br>I don't think it's completely shit, but it's definitely worse than everything else.</br>  <br>Interesting compared to Chitanda most certainly, Chitanda is just a generic moeblob 99% of the time</br>  <br>That's how I know you fell asleep watching it.</br>  <br> You know KyoAni generally isn't that good at adapting things <br><br>That's pretty much the only thing they are good at what the fuck?<br><br>Also no, after playing LB and Rewrite I thought I'd give a Key anime adaption a try</br></br></br></br></br>  they will never make a sequel to your favorite show  I like their healthy girls.<br><br>I've only ever met one non-landwhale 16 year old with tits this big, daughter of one of my tutors.</br></br>  <br>The only thing they're good at is animation. They know fuck all about how to implement this animation to accurately portray the source material they are given, and tend to just make shit up. This has always been true, and your short attention span doesn't change it.</br>  <br>Clannad, Kanon, Haruhi, K-On, Lucky Star are much better than their source material.</br>  <br>S3 WGEERE<br><br>S3 WHEAERE<br><br>S3 WHERE THE FUCK SI 33S3 FUCKING WHERE<br><br>WHERE IS S3 FUCK YOU KYONI FUCKING NO TALENT PIECE OF SHIT SUCKA<br><br>NO TALENT<br><br>PATHETIC PIECE OF NO TALENT SHIT WHERE IS MY HARUHI S3</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know how I know you haven't played or read any of those?</br>  <br>Low quality bait bro KyoAni are known for turning turds into gold.</br>  <br>but some of their most acclaimed works have been adaptions and that's not only because they sugarcoated the original material</br>  <br>You mean iron into gold-plated rust.</br>  Hyouka timeskip S2 when?  <br>So who are they supposed to be?</br>  <br>I would put Hibike lower and  Lucky Star  higher but otherwise pretty much agree</br>    <br> Mayaka and Satoshi gets together </br>  <br> Mayaka and Satoshi don't get together </br>  <br>They're made for each other, they even both dress like hipsterish hobos</br>  <br>this is so satisfying</br>  What does K-ON even mean?  <br>けいおん/軽音/Light music</br>  <br>K-ON!<br>けいおん！<br>けいおんぶ<br>軽音部<br>軽い音楽部</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>God damn why are KyoAnis so /fa/</br>  <br>Because that's all they have going for them.</br>  <br>What the hell are these doodles?

It's more interesting if you pick literally anyone else aside from them Shaft and ufoTABLE.</br></br>  <br><br>Pretty much the cap that's been placed on the industry's potential to grow creatively right here.</br></br>  <br><br> Earth Japan Label released some clothes using K-On as publicity, they usually do this with /fa/ anime like Love Live or Nagi-Asu.</br></br>  <br>That's incredible, based Japan</br>  <br><br>Sounds like a lot of anime characters</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Hey, I thought it was disgusting at first too, but you guys would change your tunes once you find yourselves erect halfway through.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Agreed, It seems like Kyoani just put that little extra effort in and make it perfect.</br>  <br>No. The Tamakos, Keions and Nichijous are not to be sexualised.</br>  <br> keions <br> not to be sexualized <br>Okay, Grandpa.</br></br></br>  <br>Amagi was brilliant</br>  <br>woah woah, you saying my nigga Gatoh is a shit writer?<br><br>You got shit taste son.</br></br></br>  Erutaso  <br>They don't have to sexualize their characters.</br>  <br>Well since you haven't watched FMP, which is a fucking classic, your post doesn't count.</br>  <br>Perhaps you should learn to appreciate things because they are nice and not just because you are incapable of stopping yourself from wanking off to everything</br>  One week into the new season and still al, anybody wants to do is keep sucking Kyoani dick. Still don't know why they haven't changed the board and names them or given Kyoani and Shaft their own generals yet.  <br><br>Posts like these are why I find Kyoani fans so annoying.

This will be my first time watching Sympho along with /a/, should be a wild ride.<br><br>And for the love of god let GX get some figures and statues, not just the 20th recolour of bunny Chris.</br></br>  This episode was so great.  Is this likely to be the last season?  <br>Hitch your hopes and dreams to Nana</br>  <br>Depends on sales and how the merch sells.</br>  <br>Well yeah, we can't really go anywhere after that besides introducing more threats. The original three can't really go much further in terms of characterisation, and it's been said this season will have FIS development. After that there's not much left.</br>  <br>1st season was supposed to be a standalone.<br>2nd season was supposed to be last season.<br><br>Iirc the writer got kinda angry when they told him to write this season.</br></br></br></br>  All we saw of her in the first episode was her running and pantsu flashes.  <br>Kaneko loves this shit</br>  <br> Iirc the writer got kinda angry when they told him to write this season. <br><br>Source? If anything the animators were mad at him because he got way to into it and the shit he wrote was too hard to animate. This is the writers baby.</br></br></br>    The new song is great and really fits hibiki  <br>She, uh, really enjoys punching things, huh?</br>  <br>I'm glad the fanservice in this serie is sneak frames and poses instead of going BOING BOING BOING LOOK LOOK *sound effects* like in most anime.</br>  <br>all the fanservice is there <br><br>but the determination to fist is so strong you ignore it and get hyped up that hibiki is being a badass</br></br></br>  <br>You're kidding right</br>  <br>Zenbu is another case.</br>  <br>Moe blob and pure sex goddess.</br>  BIKI STRONK  I want to marry Kirika!

It'll be like watching a pair of CIWSes going at it.</br>  <br>It's fine to check out something people are excited about as long as you go back and start at the beginning afterward.

That said, the last three episodes are still probably the most hype you can get in Symphogear. It was like a non-stop roller-coaster.<br><br>Season 2's high points are episodes 1 and 10, the first episode was perfect, which is probably why they are more or less repeating the pacing with GX's episode one. Episode 10 is a full load of Hibiki getting hot blooded (literally) and Mikugear rampaging with a side order of Chris kicking her ass.<br><br>You can't love Symphogear without loving QUALITY.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Miku, Hibiki and Maria  <br>Quite an odd combination.</br></br>  <br>So do people actually watch the fight scenes with the subtitles turned on?

At most the romans will have trouble actually trying to put up a fight for a while.</br>  Cavalry and wyverns would've probably wrecked them.<br>Why where they outside the castle anyway?</br>  I am expecting Outbreak Company 2, will I be disappointed?  <br>Japan fuck yeah!!<br>https://<span>youtu.be/IhnUgAaea4M  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>This makes me feel happy, cause this is what GATE is all about.<br>It really doesn't even matter what nation you're from, it's just contemporary-era humans (all of us, wherever you're from) kicking ass of tech-inferior alternate world humans who came into the wrong neighborhood and tried to start some shit.</br></br></br>  <br>the only building that looked like one they knew, (at least it looks like a castle), and there were tons of citizens, the empire seems to use roman tactics of striking the civilians to demoralize the people</br>  Someone please tell me that  prince's rabbit slave gets put out of her misery   <br> They also have guns <br>I thought the riot police only carry nonlethal weapons. The Japanese police do have their own SWAT equivalent who have automatic firearms, though.</br></br>  <br>they stepped on the griphon's tail<br>and now the griphon is going to shoot his rockets at them</br></br>    <br>Apparently it's like a fortress, or something.</br>  <br>   prince's rabbit slave <br>She's manipulating him.</br></br>  <br> misery <br>She ain't in misery, man, she's loving every moment of it and waiting for the day  she has a hand in the downfall of the empire. </br></br>  <br> Why where they outside the castle anyway? <br>Imperial Palace is right next to Ginza and is the only large fortified position in the area thanks to it being a former Edo castle.</br></br>  <br>So, like, is it rude to even mention the emperor by title in anime?</br>  <br>The police wouldn't have been enough. I think the manga depicts a larger force<br><br>120k troops were lost in the first 2 fights</br></br></br>  if they weren't anime riot police they easily could. but you all know how retarded anime police is  <br>The Outbreak Company is passively happening around Alnus.<br>Japan gov have more important things to do than actively corrupt their culture</br></br>  <br>National Police Agency's Special Assault Teams actually train with the FBI's SWAT<br><br>http://www.kjclub.com/jp/exchange/p<wbr>hoto/read.php?tname=exc_board_53&amp;ui<wbr>d=5386&amp;fid=5386&amp;thread=1000000&amp;idx=<wbr>1&amp;page=1&amp;number=4103</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  Why they changed her /a/? She was perfect  He had an hard life  <br>Why are the shields suddenly opaque when earlier they were transparent?</br>  <br> So, like, is it rude to even mention the emperor by title in anime? <br>Look at it this way, the Japanese were shocked when Queen Elizabeth's actual room and the Queen herself was shown in the London Olympics footage. In Japan it is actually forbidden to film any part of the palace interior, and basically people only see their emperor once a year when he makes a speech. In Japan the imperial family is still shrouded in secrecy.</br></br>  <br>yet the youngest daughter of the emperor was victim of bully at school</br>  <br>I too also get a boner from these kind of stories.<br>Do you guys know anymore other than this and that book about hell invading?</br></br>  <br>Uniformed police carry handguns. Considering they would work together with Riot Police they would have some guns to use.</br>  <br>Fallout: New Vegas, loosely</br>  <br> yet the youngest daughter of the emperor was victim of bully at school <br>Children don't give a fuck. Kids have one rule, adults have another.</br></br>  <br>He isn't this man right? Or chara design is fucked for him too</br>  <br>Nah I think he was the commander for the force you see before the OP.</br>  <br>Well would you use your title of emperor that is most holy and sacred to fucking stop 10 year old children ?</br>  Could the Romans biological warfare by bringing smallpox to Japan's 100% naive population?  <br>Dark elf</br>  <br>That's some fine shit taste.</br>  Does Japan have some sort of Presidental/Imperial Guard that is directly responsible for guarding places as palaces and such ?  <br> They take a Japanese cold epidemic to the other side. <br><br><br>Ninja Secret Service.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doubt it. It's not exactly like cures to smallpox aren't well known.</br>  <br>Riot police already have a tough time with steel pipes and cocktails.<br><br>The Romans have actual sharp pointed spears and arrows.<br><br>Also, they been trained in actual hand to hand combat and have the mentality to come up to you close and chop your head off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Guys throwing molotovs at Riot police know what armoured cars and tear gas is.</br>  <br>Rori is my second waifu, calm down</br>  <br> Riot police already have a tough time with steel pipes and cocktails. <br>They aren't allowed to harm too much demonstrators, though. And misused LTL weapons can kill.</br></br>  <br>He didn't take part in that attack. He attacked later, when the nips already passed through the gate and set up a base.</br>  <br> they been trained in actual hand to hand combat <br>Modern cop training would trump the fuck out of roman training. As individuals, romans were shit fighters. They excelled in organized units.</br></br>  <br>Eh, but those Romans have experienced worse than riot police.<br><br>They got Dragons and other deadly fantasy creatures to deal with in their own universe that are worse than armored cars like I wouldn't be surprised if they have 20 feet tall scorpions.</br></br></br>  <br> Also, they been trained in actual hand to hand combat <br>Japanese riot cops send their men to be trained intensively in aikido, and to qualify to be sent on the course you have to be already a 3rd dan in judo or karate.</br></br>  GATE makes sense if you pretend Japan won WW2.  <br>She has the merit of worshiping real best girl.</br>  <br>I just really don't like what she did.</br>  <br>Shhhhhh, the Not-Romans can't have ANY advantage in this. It's all about a superior force, both militarily and morally, beating up people and then acting as imperialist as possible with no sense of irony.<br><br>Like, how is this not the most boring shit ever? Oh, the good guys win in a landslide all the time and they are right about everything and they're so pure. The reason we see the opposite so much is because this is fucking monotonous. Good guys win, keep winning, win more, and are always squeaky clean.<br><br>Give me a fucking break.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cops don't experience bayonet training anymore.<br><br>Go read WW2 inspired literature and the authors who been in the war, always made note how shitty and gruesome using a bayonet was on people and that it still gives them nightmares.<br><br>Using a gun to kill someone versus using a blade and feeling your enemy flesh being sliced apart is a very big difference on the impact toward your psyche.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I just rechecked that part of the manga again out of curiousity and yes,it doesn't seems Dulan leaded the troops beyond the gate and his first contact with nips was in Alnus.<br>Unless A-1 is doing something on their own they are different guys indeed.</br></br></br>  <br> like I wouldn't be surprised if they have 20 feet tall scorpions <br>They apparently don't.<br>The not!Romans haven't really dealed with anything larger than wyverns. Even the Ancient dragons that the JSDF end up going against later in the anime haven't been around for a hundred years due to hibernation.<br><br>If the Empire utilized the Bunny warriors, then the police there would have had a much harder time.</br></br></br></br></br>  Exactly how much concentrated assmad is there going to be when a small Japanese girl with a bayonet starts cutting down dozens of swordsmen?  <br> If the Empire utilized the Bunny warriors <br>didn't they genocide them?</br></br>  <br>Thanks to larger numbers and more organized forces, yeah. The bunnies were several tribes, so I assume they weren't as united and were easier to break apart.<br><br>Comparing the human warriors to the bunnies, the bunnies all seemed to be far superior in melee combat.</br></br></br>  <br> dozens of swordsmen? <br>Not just swordsmen. Imperial guard of the fucking SPQR. They justified it by everyone was in shock and half them came fucking naked but still it looks weird.</br></br>  <br>Well, giant scorpion in fiction always like to hang around in deserts.<br><br>There hasn't been a desert environment in the manga yet.</br></br></br>  Wanna bet that little girl's mum will the the slave Itami beats that faggot of a prince near to death over?   Civillians living near the gate in Alnus are getting influenced by nips culture <br> sooner or later civilian travels through the gate will be a thing <br> Monster girls working in the anime industry will be a thing <br> tfw it isn't real </br></br></br>  <br>The slave girl was a student, wasn't she?<br>Anyways, the little girl was also anime-original, and the slave girl was kidnapped before the physical gate actually appeared.</br></br>  <br>Itami doesn't beat him up boob trooper does.</br>  <br>Also riot control training generally involves "don't kill rioters". The reason the elite hand to hand combatants in the Tokyo riot police are trained in aikido in particular is because it has a lot of restraining, locking, unbalancing, and defending which is good for subduing and arresting rioters.</br>  I actually quite liked this first ep, will abide by the 3 ep rule. Seems like a massive rip off of Outbreak Company though.  <br><br>Been a while since I read it. Still, it'd be nice to tie it together by making the mum one he finds.<br><br><br><br>Yah, my bad. He does punch his lights out.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They were the prince dudebros. The imperial guards wear black armour.<br>And she only stab like two and shoot the rest.</br></br>  <br>more like Outbreak Company was the more family friendly GATE rip off</br>  Did they have a total budget of 5$ for this episode or something?<br>Animation looks like shit<br>Also dropped.</br></br>  <br> kidnapped before the physical gate actually appeared <br>How? I thought it was during the invasion.</br></br>  <br>Outbreak Company is less silly when you realize it's easier to indoctrinate backwards societies with culture than believe the JSDF is not only a strong enough military force to launch any kind of sustained military campaign but that Japan strong armed Murrika and Russia into not claiming the gate.</br>  <br>They sent scouts through the dimensiobal hole, but it was small and not stable enough for an army.<br>Empire magician built the Gate to let the army travel through it</br></br>  <br>None of the Empire had a chance to retreat and capture anyone during the invasion.<br>Apparently Hardy punched a hole between dimensions. But this hole wouldn't really let a force pass through, so the Empire used magic to force it up and stabilize it, to pass an army through. But before that, they sent scouts in to take a few citizens to learn a bit about the world they were about to take over. Apparently they didn't learn enough.</br></br>    <br>I thought we find out later in the LN that Hardy made the gate?</br>  <br>Spoiler.  The Gate closes. </br>  <br>Outbreak Company was more dangerous since Japan took a page from the Soviet Union where they attempted to brainwash America with Marxist propaganda and values.<br><br>In Outbreak Company, Japs introduced capitalistic values to the fantasy world population and make kids waste time becoming otaku rather than learning how to become farmers, warriors, etc</br></br></br>  <br>He made the hole connecting the worlds. The Empire made the physical gate for easy access.</br>  <br>Yeah I know where you're coming from. Every single encounter (including JSDF vs other special forces groups) ends in "Holy shit, these Japanese are too good! None of us could have expected THIS! We're helpless against these superior Japanese soldiers!"<br>The dragon arc was kind of interesting because for once the antagonist(s) had the high ground, and there's some tension, but then oh no here come a bunch of sidewinders and artillery shells<br>The Japanese can do THAT? EEEH?<br>Chapter's over everybody</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hardy made the hole, not the gate as far i remember<br><br>Hardy has too much fun too ket that happen</br></br></br>  <br> He <br>I thought Hardy was a chick?</br></br>  <br>Yes, Hardy is a lady</br>  <br> Hardy <br> He </br></br>  <br><br>She is. It's just that (very masculine) name that keeps screwing over my pronouns.</br></br>  <br> but that Japan strong armed Murrika and Russia into not claiming the gate. <br>Err, to claim the Gate means military occupation of Japan's Capital, which means outright invasion of Japan. Are you STUPID?</br></br>  <br>Yeah, riot police don't exactly sign up to stab people in the heart while Roman soldiers do sign up to do that.<br><br>And modern world rioters at most throw random trash cans or rocks so subduing them is doable.<br><br>However, even riot police would have a tough time if a group of protesters all had spears and short swords attached to their waists.<br><br>The danger level has escalated beyond a normal modern day protester.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they fucked up</br>  <br>I need details! Is it current state of VNs?</br>  <br> &gt;They shot the fucking emperor <br>Literally why</br></br>  <br>Which is why Outbreak Company is more believable anon.<br><br>The other world didn't have the American propaganda machine to counter the Soviet culture march so they fell before the onslaught of otaku culture.<br><br>If GATE happened in real Japan the first thing that would happen is murrika announcing their intervention in order to protect their ally, institute a lock down of the district where the gate is present, and build up a fancy new military base.<br><br><br>Apparently you are. The US Military is already in Japan, right now. There are several air bases, a couple naval bases, and a large army base in Nihon.<br><br>There would be no outright invasion. They would just lock down the area, institute martial law, establish a base, an exclusion zone, and put up a joint task force filled with puppet politicians like how they've been doing shit for the last 70 years.<br><br>Not only that but the GATE presents a global security threat. Most First Contact procedures are international.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Basically the gate needs to close because of fifth dimensional friction causing spacetime cataclysms or something. But the chinese and the roman prince do some nonsense and they are forced to close the gate early leaving thousands of JSDF personnel stranded on the other side.</br>  <br><br>That's not the emperor</br></br>  <br>That isn't the Emperor, it's the King of one of their vassal states that was leading the attack to retake the gate. He got caught in a artillery barrage.</br>  <br>Anyway it will be open soon?</br>  <br> Dulan <br> the emperor <br>Dulan isn't the emperor, he is the king of one of conquered country and was appointed by the emperor as Commander of Unified Kingdoms Army, he see in Japan the chance to free his country and people</br></br></br>  <br><br> Is that a plush bunny in Rory's outfit and axe in the top right? <br><br>Nice catch by anon in the previous thread.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean, this manga actually portrayed the US more benevolent than the reality?</br>  <br> There would be no outright invasion. They would just lock down the area, institute martial law, <br>That's military invasion. You have no right to install martial law in a country you don't control. If you want to declare war on Japan then say so, don't assume Japan is a vassal state.</br></br>  <br> If GATE happened in real Japan the first thing that would happen is murrika announcing their intervention in order to protect their ally, institute a lock down of the district where the gate is present, and build up a fancy new military base. <br>If I remember correctly, the justification in the manga for why the Americans were taking a light approach was because they had their hands full with the Iraq War which was somehow far worse and a greater drain on resources than in real life (this was written in like 2006). <br><br>I mean, yeah, in theory the US armed forces are supposed to be maintained at a level able to fight two wars at once (like they did in WWII) plus a small brush fire elsewhere, but in practice that would probably not be true.<br><br>So anyway, for the new anime you can just assume that half the United States Armed Forces Japan was redeployed to fight ISIS and the other half has its hands full making sure the PLAN don't make any funny moves.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Unfortunately, no.<br>Hence why, even if it's straight-up pandering, I pray for this series' success.<br><br>At least to the point where we get more of this stuff. (I know it's already successful, just hasn't started it's own trend like MMO/isekai stories yet)</br></br></br></br>  <br>If the mage have the anime looks from the start, would have picked her. Rolly a best.</br>  <br> Monster Musume To Iru Nichijou is actually a sequel of Gate </br>    <br>It's called the Imperial Household Agency and it basically has more power than the family it supposedly protects.</br>  <br>I am ok with this</br>  lel  <br>Alright, the first episode was pretty bad. But hopefully next one will be a bit better. I think they made Itami seem a bit too good, should've left out the part where he murdered that roman guy.<br><br>Anyways I want to know is the OP and ED alrwady somewhere? They sounded pretty good.</br></br></br>  <br> Alright, the first episode was pretty bad. But hopefully next one will be a bit better. I think they made Itami seem a bit too good, should've left out the part where he murdered that roman guy. <br>The point is Itami does have real skills, He isn't the best, but he qualifies none the less.</br></br>  <br> , should've left out the part where he murdered that roman guy. <br>He's a fucking Ranger. He probably did hat shit on reflex.</br></br>  <br>He's good enough to be a Ranger, even if just barely. He's still a cut above your average JSDF soldier in terms of ability and training, even if he doesn't show it.</br>  <br> As individuals, romans were shit fighters. They excelled in organized units. <br>That's a myth. Roman formations gave the individual plenty of room to fight as an individual, meaning that each soldier had to be a decent fighter at worst.</br></br>  <br><br><br>It just feels out of place. Did he do that in the LN? I've only read the manga and he didn't do it in it, so that explains why it feels odd to me.</br></br></br>  <br>I think they wanted to show how capable he is with it but it kinda backfired. Especially for people who haven't read the manga since a lot of them seem to not even realize he was a soldier all along, which makes it all the more jarring.</br>  <br>That's the author.</br>  <br>the only indication in the anime are the headlines, it really was a really poor exposition but meh</br>  <br>Hell yeah they do. I don't see NG rolling around in this shit.</br>  are there any other manga/anime where fantasy magic world can get wrecked by modern real world?<br><br>Zero no tsukaima is all I can think of.</br></br>  <br> It just feels out of place. Did he do that in the LN? I've only read the manga and he didn't do it in it, so that explains why it feels odd to me. <br>You are not suppose to find out about his Ranger status until later. And anyway he isn't that proud of it, graduating the last in his class isn't something to boast about. And only because the person ahead of him dropped out.</br></br>  <br>I think Monmusu states MGs were hiding among humans for a long time but that can be connected to Hardys mischief. Makes even more sense that they revealed themselves after the Gate opened.<br><br>Also the MG designs in both mangas are virtually identical.</br></br></br>  <br>Jesus they have M113s?</br>  <br>Have we seen Hardy yet? Why is she a dyke?</br>  <br>Yeah, most people apparently don't even pay attention to the headlines.<br><br>Then again neither did I, but I've read the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>The war on drugs has no restraints.</br>  <br>and that's not even that good of an example as very little modern equipment was shown, mostly WWII stuff IRCC.</br>  <br>That reminds me, SWAT 5 when?</br>  <br> tfw losing war on inanimate objects </br>  <br>That bag of weed aint going to kill itself.</br>  <br>it's not their fault that weed is seen as the holy panacea by a bunch of retards</br>  <br>This might get a little /v/ but never. Modern consumers don't want shooters that give you the best score when you haven't shot at all. It just one man armies people want.Look at new Rainbow Six, it's more casual than the new CoD. We'll never get a new SWAT unless they opt for a small kickstarter game.</br>  <br>Some municipalities have Strykers now. It's out of control.</br>  <br>Just give me SWAT 4 with a fresh coat of paint and I'll be fucking dandy.</br>  <br> The war on drugs has no restraints. <br>It's kind of ironic that the view on drugs is so different in the West compared to Asia. I guess the Opium War scarred the entire continent and caused drug-use to be associated with enslavement. In America the talk is all about imprisoning for drug offences. In Asia there isn't any argument; it's heavy prison sentences or execution for trafficking. Taking drugs is Shamefur Dispray. Hence stupid western teenagers are hired to smuggle drugs in Asia and get themselves executed.</br></br>  lolidusa best girl<br>imagine her giving you head while the snakes fondle your balls and ass</br>  <br>Well there are a few  kickstarter  games that emphasize on tacticooling and one of them was made by some of the guys who worked on SWAT. Can't remember the name of the game at all. Still I wouldn't keep my hopes up for tacticool games if I were you.</br>  <br>theres a swat mod for arma 2 and 3 <br>i think someone is even working on a fully fledged police force simulator. for arma 3</br></br>  <br>It isn't a panacea but its derivatives are an effective pain killer, and at its base its no more harmful than alcohol is. Wasting time and money trying to control marijuana when they could be putting that effort towards combating cocaine importation or meth cooking is asinine.</br>  <br> Imperial Household Agency <br>It has an armed section ?</br></br>  <br>Drug use is also associated with HIV due to needle sharing, poverty, and crime.</br>  This loli, man.<br>Poor guy... He got a label of lolicon.</br>    Did /ak/ stop scanlating? Or did the manga go on hiatus? It's been a long time since last update.  <br> Drug use is also associated with HIV due to needle sharing, poverty, and crime. <br>My point is that I find it jarring that drug use, at least to some segment of the West, is considered a symbol of freedom. It took me a lot of time to get use to that. Since in Asia Chemical dependency is slavery and even legitimate medicine can be hard to accept, people want to tough it out rather than taking even drugs there were good for them.</br></br>  <br>apparently according to some guy on japanese 4chan the next volume is out in september.<br>something to do with combined effort with the animation studio and the original artists. <br>although the anime will not feature all of the manga and have some of its own original content apparently.</br></br></br>  <br>I just hope they get to the Italica battle, the fuckers using the Ride of the Valkyries while attacking by air was awesome</br>  <br>Pros:<br>Teargas would be veeery effective against their footmen.<br>The cops are Japanese, ergo superior to anything in the not-roman arsenal in every way.<br>Cons:<br>Dragons and ogres would be unstoppable without heavy fiepower to counter them<br>Rubber batons kinda suck when you're up against people with swords and spears.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I just hope they get to the Italica battle, the fuckers using the Ride of the Valkyries while attacking by air was awesome <br>With 2 cour it is guaranteed that we get both that battle and the Dragon. The question is if they would rush through the entire storyline or not, and they just might.</br></br>  <br>I can see number 11 holds a gun. Plastic bullets ?</br>  <br>I think they would at least end that and go original instead of going to Japan</br>  <br> Ride of the Valkyries <br>I wonder if they'll play it. I mean, they'd have to pay for it right? And I think communication between Japan and America just for one song would be too costy.</br></br>  <br>Japan sort of is a vassal state, it's the closest thing the modern world has to a protectorate. By treaty they're obligated to let America operate in their country to protect both Japanese and American interests. The Gate certainly qualifies as both.</br>  <br>Fear of medical treatments tend to be universal.<br>I find it funny that parts of the West looks down on vaccination while encouraging homeopathy.</br></br>  <br>is it not popular domain? <br>I really don't know</br></br>  <br>Elf girl, nigga.</br>  <br> two <br>Four if I remember correctly.</br></br>  <br> Japan sort of is a vassal state, it's the closest thing the modern world has to a protectorate.

If the result is American invasion of Japan either way, Japan would make it costly instead of just roll over.</br></br>  <br> The dragon arc was kind of interesting because for once the antagonist(s) had the high ground, and there's some tension, but then oh no here come a bunch of sidewinders and artillery shells <br>Strongly agree with this sentiment.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br> implying </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The dragon arc was kind of interesting because for once the antagonist(s) had the high ground, and there's some tension, but then oh no here come a bunch of sidewinders and artillery shells <br> The Japanese can do THAT?

I can't into moon. Can anyone confirm this?</br>  Since Pony Canyon is willing to do S2, its question of time.  <br>He only said やりたい though.</br>  <br>It just says Nakamura said he wants to do S2.<br><br>Hardly a confirmation.</br></br></br>  It's just the producer saying that he'd like to at Anime Expo. We already knew that.  <br>Its legit, but does not mean its in production. Just means Pony Canyon (one of Producers, doing all music publishing for it and stuff), is willing to go for another season. So its up to KyoAni if they`ll want it (which they likely will).</br>  <br>Dreams don't come true unless you wish them out loud.</br>  THANK YOU BASED OBOE-CHAN, you're truly the patron saint of second seasons.  <br>Thanks god</br>  <br>If the producer wants another season and knowing KyoAni wanted to do it in the first place I'm now hopeful for it to happen. Inshallah before Winter 2016.</br>    <br>Its just one of 3 producers (the one responsible for music sales). Shirobako should have taught you its not that easy.</br>  <br>But anon I can't get enough of the Kumiko. I really want to belive a 24 episode season 2 is happening. And that's the announcement they're having next KyoAniDo event.</br>  <br>It's obvious that there will be a second season. I doubt they'll confirm anything anytime soon though.</br>  Euphonium was AOTS no contest, so I'm hoping for more.  Looks like Euphonium might be AOTS for another season.  Please make it 2 cours and 1 movie as a finale  <br>It's not confirmed. Learn 2 Moon before you post threads like this you tard.</br>  <br>the quads demand s2</br>  Hibike feels like the kind of show kyoani typically does 2nd seasons for.  Wheres the KyoAnus sticky?<br><br>Oh wait , there has never been one.<br><br>KEKkai Sensen.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You fucking SHIT OP, My hopes and dreams gone in a instant.</br></br>  <br>Not gone, just unconfirmed.<br>Probably not even decided by kyoani yet.</br></br>  Here's the video.<br>http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/6612<wbr>3452</wbr></br>  Hell yeah  <br> Minute 26 <br> Some feminist bitch complaining about male dominated band clubs <br> Didn't even ask a question <br><br>Holy fuck America get your bitches on a leash already.</br></br></br></br></br>   clickbait the OP <br><br>Do you have a job at Sankakucomplex?</br></br>  Didn't the anime sold like shit?   やりたい <br><br>OBOE-CHAN WILL SAVE US.<br><br>THANK YOU BASED OBOE-CHAN</br></br></br></br>  <br>KyoAni standards, kind of, but sales-wise it did okay. 6k isn't really impressive but many anime can only dream of such sales.<br><br><br>If only. The world needs more Hazuki.</br></br></br></br>  And so the baiting continues.  <br>Quads confirmed S2</br>  How would you improve season 2 to make it sell even better? I found the show boring until episode 5.  <br>Make it focus either exclusively on het or yuri. Don't make the show row on two rivers.</br>  <br><br>More marching band too.</br></br>  名前：名無しさん投稿日：2015年01月01日<br> <br>4chでも言ってたやついたわ<br>そりゃやりたいだろうね<br><br>What does that jap say about us?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> okay, we will try. </br></br>  <br>I've literally never heard that idiom before.</br>  <br>Neither will happen.<br><br>Shuichi has even less presence in volume 2 than he has in volume 1.<br>Reina has more scenes with Kumiko, but they're far less emotional that volume 1 scenes and Reina spends a lot more time obsessing over Taki-Sensei.<br><br>If they wanted to give a conclusive romance ending, they would either need to increase Shuichi's screen time and advance the romantic plot faster, or they would need to drop Reina's love for Taki-Sensei. And since they're deliberately making it ambiguous to mess with fans, they'll probably keep doing it in season two as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Season 1's romantic aspirations were nil. The western viewerbase really wanted to make it a horserace with winners and losers, and the show never tried to do that. Now if they stick to the novels going forward, it will be a singularly developed romantic relationship and no one will get btfo except shipping faggots.</br>  <br> It's obvious that there will be a second season </br>  <br>it was also cheap to produce<br><br>didn't KnK sell even less while also being expensive as fuck to animate?<br>and it still got two movies god damn</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Who gives a shit about romance in the first place?<br><br>all I want is pic related and some good fucking drama</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> they'll probably keep doing it in season two as well. <br><br>God the threads are gonna even be more shittier.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Who gives a shit about romance in the first place? <br><br>Probably 90% of the people watch this show.</br></br></br>  <br> Reina has more scenes with Kumiko, but they're far less emotional that volume 1 scenes and Reina spends a lot more time obsessing over Taki-Sensei. <br><br>Let's not forget that most of her presence even in this season was anime-original. I doubt they're going to double back on that especially now she's gotten popular.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, it feels good to be part of the 10% that doesn't<br>I love the themes, the music ad characters<br><br>don't really care who ends up with whom</br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair no one will if some fags didn't ship and derail the thread with their delusion on the first place.</br>  <br><br>No shitstorm will happen if Kyoani stops putting fuel into the fire. I like how they made Reina relevant early in the story, but the obnoxious yuri pandering needs to stop if they don't plan on yuri-end.</br></br>  <br>Good, good.</br>  <br>That's true, they'll probably add more anime original scenes in season 2, like they did in season 1.<br><br>But the thing is, adding Reina scenes in season 1 wasn't done just so they can "yuri bait". It was done because Reina is the second most important character in this part of the story, right after Kumiko.<br><br>Season/volume 1 is about Kumiko and Reina. Kumiko experiences a lot of character growth because of Reina - she learns to stand up for herself, she realizes she loves her euphonium, she realizes she also wants to become special. All of this happened directly because of Reina. So giving Reina more screen time in the first half of the anime where she had almost none made sense since it made the pacing of the story better and the episode 8 scene didn't come out of nowhere.<br><br>Season/volume 2 is about Asuka, Oboe-chan, and Oboe-chan's friend. Even Kumiko isn't a really important character here, and all Reina scenes are basically "muh Taki". If they were going to add strong yuri scenes like the ones from episode 8 or episode 11, Kyoani would have completely new, important plot points, and not just change things up like they did with e.g. second audition.<br><br>The only way I can imagine Reina playing an important role in season 2 if they decide to include an anime original plot about her slowly getting over Taki-Sensei. But I don't believe Kyoani would do something drastic, especially considering they added even more anime original scenes focusing on Reina's obsession with Taki-Sensei in season one than there were in volume one of the novel.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Reina scenes in season 1 wasn't done just so they can "yuri bait" <br><br>Changing a cheek poke to a finger slide down towards lip isn't bait? And the other 'super intimate' moments in the show? Please this is Kyoani we're talking here. You wish it wasn't yuri bait, but it is.</br></br></br></br>   mfw finally we couldn't know why Asuka was acting weird   <br>It gets explained later in the story, S1 didn't get that far. Go check the archive, spoileranon explained it.</br>  <br>You've got a pretty low opinion of KyoAni writers' abilities if you don't think they'd be able write in Reina as part of the existing plot rather than just tacking on a new story about her. I'd say that kind of adaptation is where KyoAni's writing is strongest, and it's something I'd probably expect from the sequel anyway, finding ways to tie originally disparate elements like Reina and Kumiko's "dates" in with the main plot rather than just being breathers.<br><br>I also think you're kind of overstating novel Reina's importance to Kumiko's character arc as a person rather than just as a concept or ideal.</br></br></br>  <br>I think anyone who doesn't trust KyoAni's writers is just being realistic. They suck ass at doing anything original except for K-On.</br>  <br>I never said Kyoani didn't add more yuri bait, or made the existing yuri bait even more yuri bait-y. What I'm saying is, Reina's increased presence isn't done just because of yuri bait.<br><br><br>I'm sure they'll give her more screen time and try to tie her into this plot by getting her involved, but that wouldn't make her the focus, like she was in season 1. She'll get more screen time, but I don't think she'll get a lot more relevance, unless they shake things up and add anime original stuff.<br><br>I imagine that in season two, Reina will mostly be Kumiko's support character (like the scene in episode 12 where Kumiko was practicing and she brought her water and tried to comfort her) or a comic relief character ("yandere" scene in the same episode). I don't expect a "major" yuri scene comparable to episode 8 or 11 ones in season 2.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Rewatch and accept your otp  <br>Best news possible even if it's unconfirmed, couldn't help but scream YES.</br>  <br>Actually Pony Canyon is the one responsible for disc distributions (BD, DVD), no? Lantis would be the one for music.</br>  <br>I can't get over how fluffy her hair is</br>  <br>Yeah that's expected considering how music rights go. And trust me, there has been a huge upswing in Japan on all the music they showed in the series. I bet the OST will sell over 50K alone. Plus all the publicity with all HS bands playing them.</br>  <br> pic not related </br>  bump for someone translating it  If this has anything to do with the Pony Canyon panel at Anime Expo yesterday, all they said about season 2 of Euphonium was literally "we are in talks". There's no confirmation whatsoever that S2 is happening.  I want to see more Reina obsessing over Taki. That's all I ask for based kyoani gods.  <br>Season 2 is only a question of time. It's fated to happen</br>  <br> 90% <br> only IRC and /u/ degenerates shitting up the thread  <br><br>You are legitimate retarded, anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>KyoAni obviously wants to do it with the S2 hints, and they lead the production committee<br><br>Pony Canyon wants to it<br><br>The only one left is Yamaha.<br><br>So if you want more Hibike, buy Yamaha brass instruments with Hibike stickers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't trust Hanada. At all. If it was Yoshida (K-On, GuP) sure. But Hanada is just plain inconsistent. Chuuni 1 was good. Chuuni 2 sucked. KnK was meh. The only really good thing out him was Steins Gate. <br><br>If they bring Gatoh into this, then well, thing will get a whole lotta lewder.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't trust Hanada. At all. <br>Yeah, me neither.</br></br>  <br>Even Steins Gate had some problems because of him.  Fuck, Zero is going to end up shit, isn't it? </br>  <br><br>So it's basically like the stock answer they'd give any fan asking the question that isn't a confirmation or denial of anything either way but gets people off their back a bit and paying a little attention. Realistically the only answer that could be given.</br></br>  <br><br>You mean shitposting anime of the season with dozens of completely unnecessary threads of people jacking it to the show and memeposting.<br><br>Seriously that shows been over for less than a week now and the new seasons started and the quality level of posting on 4chan already feels like it's improved a fair bit from utterly insufferable to cresting tolerable. I can only imagine what it's going to look like a couple weeks from now.</br></br></br></br>  <br> So if you want more Hibike, buy Yamaha brass instruments with Hibike stickers. <br>Where?</br></br>  So you tell me that this anime is about a school band and... who else??? What is the big deal of it cause the argument is shit.  <br><br>From what I gather it's band + shipping wars. A lot of which involves /u/-bait.</br></br>  <br>The same as any anime that involves competition really. They want to reach the nationals and drama starts from there.</br>  <br>Yes it is.</br>  <br><br> good thing out him was Steins Gate.  <br> Even Steins Gate <br> plebs normalfags first anime  <br><br>Embarrassing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mmm... interesting</br>  You just wait.  How much screen time do you think Oboe and Flute will get in the second season?  <br>That's not true. If you make a wish on a shooting star or when you blow out the birthday candles everyone knows that you can't tell what it is or it won't come true.</br>  Reminder that even if we get S2 all the 3rd years are gone forever.  <br>No.</br>  <br>No they're not, there are still two volumes of the novel before their graduation.</br>  GOMEN ASO BASE?!?!?!  <br>the novel's lore has officialy ended, and it only covers the first year</br>  <br> That hand <br> That back <br> That Not fluffy Kumiko <br>if you're going shitpost at least use good bait</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127593063 <br>hey</br>      <br>I'm really tired of this meme.</br>  <br><br>how can an old guy be this hot?</br></br>  <br/>  I'm an idiot for feeling some shred of hope towards an unconfirmed "we're in talks" rumor.<br>But goddamnit I love Kumiko.<br>Another squeak compilation is too sweet an idea to not get excited for.</br></br>  Can someone please post the girl's shoes?

Reina-chan?<br>why is this so cute?</br>  <br> Noboru-kun? Reina-chan? </br>  <br> Noboru? Reina. </br>  <br>  Isn't this the kind of shit you'd do when you're happy and you've got a friend close to you? <br>9/10 bait.</br></br>    <br>I hope KyoAni fixes her knees in the BD</br>  <br>Prove me wrong you piece of shit. I just watched the episode and it was shit. This whole show is shit.</br>  <br>I'll never understand this sentiment.<br>Fair enough if you like a particular ship, but having it make or break a show for you?<br>Was shipping really the only part of the show you enjoyed?</br></br></br>  <br>Kumiko and Reina's relationship was the highlight. It was crystal clear in the ED too. What the fuck do I get in this end?<br><br>Fuck kyoani.</br></br></br>  Just watched the final episode and was hoping for a season two. I really enjoyed the music in this series. It was really faithfully reproduced. Speaking of, does anyone know the name of the piano interlude that gets played when Kumiko and Reina are together like in episode 8. I play the piano and I'd really like to get the sheet music or atleast a clean version of it.  So /a/, what is a rare Kumiko?  <br>You should've just avoided this anime if you were expecting explicit yuri.<br>The red string wasn't entirely wrong it did fated Kumiko and Reina to meet up and form a relationship again (least that's what I got out of it).</br></br>    <br>A rarely posted picture of Kumiko.<br>I've only seen this one posted once.</br></br>  What is the problem that the moderates AnimeSuki forum.<br>It has a user.<br>It has a User Eragon, he Accuses any User who does not like the genre yuri homophobic.<br>It attacks anyone who does not agree with their opinions</br></br></br>  <br>That ribbon is ridiculous</br>  <br>Wait, technically speaking, fan art of Kumiko doesn't count as real rare Kumiko, right? It's more like a counterfeit Kumiko.</br>  <br>It's cute.</br>  <br>It's distracting.</br>  <br>Do women wear ribbons in real life, or is that just an anime/cartoon thing, like those ridiculous sleeping hats?<br>I can't even imagine how it would look in real life.</br></br>  <br> going to anime forums </br>  <br>What more do you want? The show was never about romance and this is nice enough.<br>Seriously.</br></br>  <br>Some tryhards do yeah</br>  <br> giving antimugino replies </br>  <br>I've seen women wear ribbons but not as big as Yuuko's.</br>  <br>…but also refusing to turn down her offer of kindness, Shuuichi reluctantly wrapped it around his neck. Whether or not it was from Kumiko’s own body heat, its fabric had roughly felt warm to the touch.<br><br>“It suits you.”<br><br>She laughed in a somewhat curious way, and then suddenly placed her hand on his shoulder. Pressed against such force, Shuuichi spontaneously tilted his body towards Kumiko. The lifting of her heels had playfully come into sight. Kumiko stood tip-toed and she held her hand close to his ear, with her lips following suit. This froze Shuuich’s body in place, even while his heart was bouncing — with Kumiko ever so close to him, Shuuichi found her presence difficult to ignore.<br><br>Kumiko’s voice had flowed, with the sigh of her breath tickling his ears, and the sweet fragrance of her shampoo striking his nose. Shuuchi did not move, but he was absolutely certain of the words she had just imparted to him.<br><br>“I love you too, Shuuichi.”</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now do the one where they link their fingers together.</br>  <br>I've seen him posting his anti-yuri copypastas in the Aquarion thread earlier today.</br>  <br>That two-timing strumpet couldn't shut up about how much she loves UFO. What about UFO, Kumiko? What about UFO? I bet she'd fall for anything she can blow.</br>  <br>You don't have to keep posting this.</br>  <br>And that's as much as we'll get. What's the point? kyoani didn't fin a way. Fuck this.</br>  <br>There's yuri in Aquarion now or what</br>  <br>Oboe and Flute seems to have something going on. Plus if we get a season 2 we get more Yuuko/Natsuki shenanigans.</br>  <br>physical and real evidence.<br>different from delusions and hallucinations and fanwank created by fans of yuri Animesuki and /u/</br></br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>The point is that the story isn't about romance at all.<br>Considering this, they got pretty far and this is gay as fuck. It also shows how much they're mutually attracted to each other. You're not 12 right? Kissing and/or sex isn't the only way to depict love between 2 characters.</br></br>  I wanna die, no more hibikes  ;_;   <br>Honestly they really don't give a shit.</br>  <br>What were you expecting? Regardless of what route they want to go down, there was never going to be a conclusive romantic end at this stage. They finished stronger than any of the other character pairs, and they'll doubtless find a way to put more of them in the second season if it gets one.</br>  <br>hibikek indeed</br>  <br> everyone replying to this weak bait trying to fuck up the thread  <br> <br>Jesus /a/ please die.</br></br></br>  Which Karlsland witch is the hottest and why is it Marseille?  That's an awfully weird way of spelling Waltrud, op.    <br>Could you survive a threesome?</br>  <br><br>If it's Marseille and Aurora, probably not.</br></br>  <br> threesome with Marseille and Aurora <br>A guy doesn't deserve so much happiness.</br></br>  Trude is clearly the hottest  <br>What the hell is this anime called and will it give me a boner</br>  I always had a huge hard-on for Trude.  Erica is very warm.<br><br>That's why AC is so important during these summer nights.</br></br>  <br><br>okay then. what if you replaced the guy with some burger tits?</br></br>  You can only dance with one after all.  <br><br>What is it about Trude that makes her so damn perfect? I just can't seem to put it to words.</br></br>  <br>A threesome between 3 busty witches and the guy has to watch? He wouldn't survive either. A leathal case of blue balls.</br>  <br><br>Rudel seems like she might be a bit too forceful of a dancer.<br><br>Heidi's probably nice and slow, but she's got plenty of fall mitigation in case you mess up.</br></br></br></br>  A shame that he never colored this one.    <br>Hate sex with Marseille when?</br>  <br>jesus christ my dick</br>  I want Marseille to ride me, if you know what I mean.  Minna!<br>She may not be as bodacious as Marseille and Aurora, but she has that older lady charm.</br>  <br>I also have trouble pinpointing why she gives me as massive a boner as she does. Maybe personal preference, brown hair in twintails (not too long, not too short), her body is very balanced in shape: great legs, ass and tits. And her voice is pleasingly authoritative and strong without being grating or annoying.</br>  <br><br>Trude is the Karlslandian ideal.</br></br>  <br><br>Would you get a karlsland tattoo?</br></br>  <br><br>Tattoos are terrible things for terrible people.</br></br>  <br>Minna is a top tier waifu.</br>  <br><br>but if the star of afrika has one, then it has to be cool!</br></br>    Track four;<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=FDj<wbr>8sjjWhQg</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br><br>That's nice and simple.</br></br>  <br><br>Alcohol definitely doesn't help.</br></br>  So I heard that June event was incredibly disappointing.    <br>Please go away with this /e/ /c/rap.<br><br>Yeah, that it truly was except for the merchandise collectors.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Can something like this truly be disappointing?<br><br><br><br>Well, you do have nice handwriting.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>There's something about bare shoulders.</br></br>  <br>It's disappointing because i watch anime but don't buy figures.</br>  <br>And Trude has a nice personality unlike Marseille.</br>  <br>I want to sandwich Eila between Aurora and Nipa.<br>She would be envious because of the difference between their breast size.</br></br>  <br> Trude <br> nice personality </br></br>  <br>Yes, she does.</br>    <br>Same here, I just can't get into collecting knowing I'd had to get all the witches and spend over $1000 for them in total, not to mention the space they need.<br>I'm still baffled as to why they brought all the seiyuus for the event if it was just merchandise. I can guess it was fun for them at least and many of the seiyuus are quite well known and SW happens to unite them.</br></br>  <br>Why does she make that face</br>  <br><br>They're delicious.<br><br><br><br>As long as it's not time to wake up.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> /e/ /c/rap <br> in a fuckin strike witches thread <br><br>hahahahah make way for the serious discussion guys</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> hahahahah make way for the serious discussion guys <br><br>Exactly right. And a picture is worth a thousand words so let's discuss via imagery.</br></br></br></br>  What do you guys think of Raisa?    So, Heidi is mine.  <br><br>Her girlfriend is mine  and probably a few other peoples too .</br></br>  Best    <br>Such a lewd uniform.</br>  <br><br>Yes. She should take it off.</br></br>  <br>I want her to rape me.<br>I want to lie my head on her chest in the bed while she hugs me with one arm and smokes.</br></br>  Adult witches - the best kind of witches. So, I like Gundulla Rall.  <br>How adult are we talking here?</br>  Minna, Rall, Heidi, Rudel and Marseille are the top five hottest Karlsland witches in my opinion.  <br><br>Minna is the most beautiful and elegant.</br></br>  <br>Minna looks like she'd be downright wicked in bed.<br><br>Kawaii in the strees senpai in the sheets. 10/10 waifu material.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why do people keep drawing those horrible highlights.</br></br>  <br>Nice work anon.</br>    I haven't even watched strike witches but the yuri doujins are godly  Karlsland Witches&gt;Fuso Witches&gt;Suomi Witches&gt;Romagna Witches&gt;Orussian Witches&gt;Galia Witches&gt;Liberion Witches&gt;shit&gt;Britannia Witches<br><br>Ranking in terms of personality and lewdness of course.</br></br>  <br><br>I think somebody switched the &lt; and &gt; on your keyboard.</br></br>  How would you become her friend?  <br><br>Meet her through Erica.</br></br>  <br>Oh, i don't know OP..<br>Why would she be best...</br></br>  <br><br>Being Heidi's friend would be pretty cool and somewhat romantic, staying up all night to talk about different things while star gazing and drinking fancy tea is what I'd imagine it to be like.<br><br><br><br> Marseille's ass <br>Anon, as much as I like Marseille and her body, you have to admit she has some pretty Godly breasts. Trude's the Karlsland with the nicest ass.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes please</br>  <br> Trude <br> not Minna <br><br>I mean, I know Trude's ass is hard enough to not even jiggle when spanked, but Minna's ass KILLS the enemy.<br><br>It'd be a hard battle between those two.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Both Minna and Trude have fabulous bodies and personalities that the battle is pretty much even between them.</br></br>    <br><br>Oh Minna, she gets lovelier with age.<br><br>Perrine too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Superb taste.</br>  <br><br>Minna x Perrine is true OTP and best crack pairing.</br></br>  <br><br>47 Perrine is full on princess mode.</br></br>  <br>At least 20+. But Gundulla looks likle true adult lady.</br>  <br>Pics?</br>  <br>Glorious mix of superior Gallian and Karlslander genes.</br>    Crack pairing time:<br><br>Minna x Perrine<br>Sanya x Trude<br>Lucchini x Eila<br>Lynne x Shirley<br>Erica x Mio<br>Yoshika x Herself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yoshika x Herself <br><br>Not Yoshika x Micchan's Grandpa.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I think there's an artist you haven't met.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm pretty familiar with some of their stuff.<br><br>We need some artists to do Minna x Perrine though, that's pretty lacking from what I can tell.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You want crack pairing?<br>Minna x Lynne<br>Why you ask? Because they are my absolute favorites.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I approve, I wonder if they did anything on that drive they went together.<br><br>Good taste though, those two are definitely high in my favourites of 501.</br></br></br></br>  As if Fumikami himself had telepathically touched my mind and asked what would the sexiest 2D girl look like.
